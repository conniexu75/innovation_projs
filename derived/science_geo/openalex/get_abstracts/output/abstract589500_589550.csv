The gut epithelium is a principal site for detecting such agents, but precisely how it communicates with neural elements is poorly understood. Serotonergic enterochromaffin (EC) cells are proposed to fulfill this role by acting as chemosensors, but understanding how these rare and unique cell types transduce chemosensory information to the nervous system has been hampered by their paucity and inaccessibility to single-cell measurements. Here, we circumvent this limitation by exploiting cultured intestinal organoids together with single-cell measurements to elucidate intrinsic biophysical, pharmacological, and genetic properties of EC cells. We show that EC cells express specific chemosensory receptors, are electrically excitable, and modulate serotonin-sensitive primary afferent nerve fibers via synaptic connections, enabling them to detect and transduce environmental, metabolic, and homeostatic information from the gut directly to the nervous system."
https://openalex.org/W2702751937,"Immune-checkpoint-blockade (ICB)-mediated rejuvenation of exhausted T cells has emerged as a promising approach for treating various cancers and chronic infections. However, T cells that become fully exhausted during prolonged antigen exposure remain refractory to ICB-mediated rejuvenation. We report that blocking de novo DNA methylation in activated CD8 T cells allows them to retain their effector functions despite chronic stimulation during a persistent viral infection. Whole-genome bisulfite sequencing of antigen-specific murine CD8 T cells at the effector and exhaustion stages of an immune response identified progressively acquired heritable de novo methylation programs that restrict T cell expansion and clonal diversity during PD-1 blockade treatment. Moreover, these exhaustion-associated DNA-methylation programs were acquired in tumor-infiltrating PD-1hi CD8 T cells, and approaches to reverse these programs improved T cell responses and tumor control during ICB. These data establish de novo DNA-methylation programming as a regulator of T cell exhaustion and barrier of ICB-mediated T cell rejuvenation."

Here, we show that GFP+ cells from Bmi1GFP mice are preterminal enteroendocrine cells and we identify CD69+CD274+ cells as related goblet cell precursors. Upon loss of native Lgr5+ ISCs, both populations revert toward an Lgr5+ cell identity. While active histone marks are distributed similarly between Lgr5+ ISCs and progenitors of both major lineages, thousands of cis elements that control expression of lineage-restricted genes are selectively open in secretory cells. This accessibility signature dynamically converts to that of Lgr5+ ISCs during crypt regeneration.

Beyond establishing the nature of Bmi1GFP+ cells, these findings reveal how chromatin status underlies intestinal cell diversity and dedifferentiation to restore ISC function and intestinal homeostasis. Self-renewal of the intestinal epithelium is sustained principally by Lgr5+ stem cells that lie at the bottom of intestinal crypts and replicate daily (Barker et al., 2007Barker N. van Es J.H.

It is unclear if a separate pool of quiescent stem cells is dedicated to replenishing Lgr5+ intestinal stem cells (ISCs) when necessary (Barker, 2014Barker N.

Ambiguous expression domains of Cre recombinase in lineage-tracing studies and of putative molecular markers fuel the uncertainty. Chromatin states can shed useful light on cell populations and on the basis for ISC recovery after ablative injuries. Ideas about a facultative pool of reserve ISCs originated in observations on rare cells that reside mainly in crypt tier 4 and retain S phase labels for long periods, indicating replicative quiescence (Potten, 1998Potten C.S.

Attesting to their stem cell potential, BmiGfp cells generate colonies in culture and increase in number when Lgr5+ ISCs are ablated in vivo (Sangiorgi and Capecchi, 2008Sangiorgi E. Capecchi M.R.

USA. 2012; 109: 466-471Crossref PubMed Scopus (594) Google Scholar), a circumstance in which a Bmi1-expressing population is the source of new ISCs (Tian et al., 2011Tian H. Biehs B. Warming S.

A reserve stem cell population in small intestine renders Lgr5-positive cells dispensable.Nature. 2011; 478: 255-259Crossref PubMed Scopus (849) Google Scholar). One problem in interpreting these data is that Bmi1 is expressed throughout intestinal crypts, including Lgr5+ ISC and transit-amplifying (TA) cells (Itzkovitz et al., 2011Itzkovitz S. Lyubimova A. Blat I.C. Maynard M. van Es J. Lees J. Jacks T. Clevers H. van Oudenaarden A. Single-molecule transcript counting of stem-cell markers in the mouse intestine.Nat.

Yousefi M. Nakauka-Ddamba A. Jain R. Tobias J. Epstein J.A. Jensen S.T. Lengner C.J.

Sci. USA. 2012; 109: 466-471Crossref PubMed Scopus (594) Google Scholar). Therefore, although Bmi1 is often regarded as a specific marker of quiescent ISCs, GFP+ cells in BmiGfp mouse intestines represent a subset of Bmi1-expressing cells (Itzkovitz et al., 2011Itzkovitz S.

A reserve stem cell population in small intestine renders Lgr5-positive cells dispensable.Nature. 2011; 478: 255-259Crossref PubMed Scopus (849) Google Scholar). Identification of crypt cells by chromatin states and new molecular markers may help resolve these open questions. Damage to Lgr5+ ISC triggers crypt regeneration not only from Bmi1+ cells but also from specified enterocytes (Ent) and secretory (Sec) progenitors (Pros) (Tetteh et al., 2016Tetteh P.W. Basak O. Farin H.F. Wiebrands K. Kretzschmar K. Begthel H. van den Born M.

Cell Biol. 2012; 14: 1099-1104Crossref PubMed Scopus (540) Google Scholar). Even LRCs, which were previously thought to represent quiescent ISC (Potten, 1998Potten C.S. Stem cells in gastrointestinal epithelium: numbers, characteristics and death.Philos. Trans. R. Soc. Lond. B Biol. Sci. 1998; 353: 821-830Crossref PubMed Scopus (438) Google Scholar) but are now recognized as precursors of terminal Paneth and some enteroendocrine (EE) cells, contribute to the salvage (Buczacki et al., 2013Buczacki S.J. Zecchini H.I. Nicholson A.M. Russell R. Vermeulen L. Kemp R. Winton D.J. Intestinal label-retaining cells are secretory precursors expressing Lgr5.Nature. 2013; 495: 65-69Crossref PubMed Scopus (554) Google Scholar, Li et al., 2016Li N. Nakauka-Ddamba A. Tobias J.

Mouse label-retaining cells are molecularly and functionally distinct from reserve intestinal stem cells.Gastroenterology. 2016; 151: 298-310Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). This considerable plasticity implies that diverse crypt cells either have similar chromatin states or efficiently overcome a chromatin barrier when recruited to dedifferentiate into ISCs. Judging by the active histone modifications H3K4me2 and H3K27ac, the cis-element profiles of Lgr5+ ISC, Sec-Pro and Ent-Pro are strikingly similar (Kim et al., 2014Kim T.H. Li F. Ferreiro-Neira I. Ho L.L. Luyten A. Nalapareddy K. Long H. Verzi M. Shivdasani R.A. Broadly permissive intestinal chromatin underlies lateral inhibition and cell plasticity.Nature. 2014; 506: 511-515Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). This similarity may explain divergence of the two intestinal lineages by lateral inhibition, but it is unclear how it engenders crypt cell diversity, including Bmi1Gfp cells. Here, we show that BmiGfp cells are preterminal EE cells and identify related goblet cell precursors that express CD69 and CD274. Neither population seems to represent a dedicated pool of quiescent ISCs, but both dedifferentiate rapidly in response to ablation of native ISCs. We identify thousands of genome sites where chromatin is selectively open in Sec-Pro, BmiGfp, and CD69+CD274+ cells, but not in ISCs or Ent-Pros. Although these sites lack strong histone activation marks, they are bona fide enhancers for Sec-restricted genes. Upon loss of native ISCs, the distinctive chromatin signature of Bmi1Gfp and CD69+CD274+ cells reverts dynamically toward that of Lgr5+ cells. This transition reflects the rapid breach of a chromatin barrier when specified crypt cells are enlisted to restore ISC function. In duodenal crypts in BmiGfp mice (Hosen et al., 2007Hosen N. Yamane T. Muijtjens M. Pham K. Clarke M.F. Weissman I.L. Bmi-1-green fluorescent protein-knock-in mice reveal the dynamic regulation of bmi-1 expression in normal and leukemic hematopoietic cells.Stem Cells. 2007; 25: 1635-1644Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar), GFP+ cells lie just above the Lgr5+ ISC and Paneth cell zone (Figure 1A). To determine the lineage of these GFP+ cells, we isolated them by flow cytometry (Figure S1A) and compared their RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) profiles to those of Lgr5+ ISCs (Barker et al., 2007Barker N. van Es J.H.

Notch/gamma-secretase inhibition turns proliferative cells in intestinal crypts and adenomas into goblet cells.Nature. 2005; 435: 959-963Crossref PubMed Scopus (1259) Google Scholar), and Ent-Pros from Atoh1−/− crypts (Kim et al., 2014Kim T.H. Li F. Ferreiro-Neira I. Ho L.L. Luyten A. Nalapareddy K. Long H. Verzi M. Shivdasani R.A. Broadly permissive intestinal chromatin underlies lateral inhibition and cell plasticity.Nature. 2014; 506: 511-515Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar) (Table S1; Figure S1B); high Epcam mRNA levels confirmed the epithelial origin of each population (Figure S1B). We also profiled Lgr5+ ISCs harvested from another mouse strain, Lgr5Dtr-Gfp (Tian et al., 2011Tian H. Biehs B. Warming S. Leong K.G. Rangell L. Klein O.D. de Sauvage F.J. A reserve stem cell population in small intestine renders Lgr5-positive cells dispensable.Nature. 2011; 478: 255-259Crossref PubMed Scopus (849) Google Scholar) and Sec-Pros isolated after genetic disruption of Notch activity (Kim et al., 2014Kim T.H. Li F. Ferreiro-Neira I. Ho L.L. Luyten A. Nalapareddy K. Long H. Verzi M. Shivdasani R.A. Broadly permissive intestinal chromatin underlies lateral inhibition and cell plasticity.Nature. 2014; 506: 511-515Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar) (Figure S1C). Hundreds of transcripts were enriched or present exclusively in Bmi1Gfp cells, such as the Serpina1 cluster, transcription factors (TFs) of the Ets/Fli/Fev family, and especially genes known for EE cell expression (Figures 1B and S1D). In principal-component analysis (PCA), Bmi1Gfp cells accounted for the bulk of variation (Figure 1C). Compared to the other populations, transcripts present selectively (>3-fold, q < 0.05) in Bmi1Gfp cells were depleted in the “Cell cycle” category and enriched for “Quiescence” and “Targets of fusion transcription factor EWSR1-FLI1” (Figure S1E). Thus, Bmi1Gfp cells have an mRNA profile distinct from Lgr5+ ISCs and crypt progenitors. Because one prevalent view is that BmiGfp cells represent quiescent ISCs that periodically replenish the pool of Lgr5+ ISC (Li et al., 2014Li N. Yousefi M. Nakauka-Ddamba A. Jain R. Tobias J.

USA. 2012; 109: 466-471Crossref PubMed Scopus (594) Google Scholar), we sought to determine their position within the crypt hierarchy. We used successive changes in mRNA expression to derive quantitative scores for every possible trajectory among stem, progenitor, and the abundant differentiated villus cell types: enterocytes and goblet cells (STAR Methods; Figure S1F). Among every possible model, those in which BmiGfp cells spawn Lgr5+ ISCs or progenitors gave unfavorable scores; only a model where they originate in Sec-Pros gave a high positive score (Figure 1D). In line with this result, crypts lacking ATOH1, a TF required for Sec specification (Shroyer et al., 2007Shroyer N.F. Helmrath M.A. Wang V.Y. Antalffy B. Henning S.J. Zoghbi H.Y.

Bmi1Gfp cells lacked transcripts classically ascribed to goblet or Paneth cells; rather, they were enriched for canonical EE genes, with the hormone Ghrelin being particularly abundant and specific (Figure S2A). We therefore purified crypt EE and Paneth cells using flow cytometry for CD24 and Ulex europaeus agglutinin (Wong et al., 2012Wong V.W. Stange D.E. Page M.E. Buczacki S. Wabik A. Itami S. van de Wetering M. Poulsom R. Wright N.A. Trotter M.W. et al.Lrig1 controls intestinal stem-cell homeostasis by negative regulation of ErbB signalling.Nat. Cell Biol. 2012; 14: 401-408Crossref PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar), verified the purity of various cell isolates by RT-PCR analysis of established lineage markers (Figure S2B), and profiled transcripts using RNA-seq (Table S1). Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) (Subramanian et al., 2005Subramanian A. Tamayo P. Mootha V.K. Mukherjee S. Ebert B.L. Gillette M.A. Paulovich A. Pomeroy S.L. Golub T.R. Lander E.S. Mesirov J.P.

USA. 2005; 102: 15545-15550Crossref PubMed Scopus (26549) Google Scholar) and trajectory analysis indicated that Bmi1Gfp cells are related most closely to EE cells (Figures 1F and S2C). Moreover, 91% of BmiGfp cells showed high expression of the EE-specific marker CHGA (Figure 1G), and the population is enriched for RNAs encoding many hormones and TFs known to control EE cells (Figures S2D and S2E). These data reveal Bmi1Gfp cells as non-replicating ChgA+ EE cells, with high expression of hormone RNAs and Neurod1 (compared to Neurog3), suggesting advanced differentiation (Li et al., 2012Li H.J. Kapoor A. Giel-Moloney M. Rindi G. Leiter A.B. Notch signaling differentially regulates the cell fate of early endocrine precursor cells and their maturing descendants in the mouse pancreas and intestine.Dev. Biol. 2012; 371: 156-169Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar); our trajectory data suggest preterminal EE maturity (Figure S2C). Bmi1Gfp cells thus do not seem to represent a dedicated pool of reserve ISCs, though they may when necessary dedifferentiate into Lgr5+ ISCs, like other precursors (Buczacki et al., 2013Buczacki S.J.

Notably, no crypt cells have been captured in the act of dedifferentiation. Because our goal was to capture such cells and examine transitional chromatin states, we sought next to identify potentially labile crypt populations in wild-type mice. Noting that some surface marker RNAs express at considerably higher levels in Bmi1Gfp cells than in Lgr5+ ISCs (Figure S3A), we used flow cytometry to test expression of selected such proteins. CD69 and CD274 reproducibly marked ∼9% (n = 7) of viable wild-type EPCAM+ crypt epithelial cells (Figure S3B). These proteins were rarely present alone, and both flow cytometry and immunofluorescence robustly identified a CD69+CD274+ cell population that localized in crypt positions above the Paneth-ISC zone (Figures 2A, 2B, and S3B). Although Cd69 and Cd274 mRNAs are absent from Lgr5+ ISCs (Figure S3A), to exclude any potential overlap of cell types, we treated Lgr5Dtr-Gfp mice with four doses of diphtheria toxin (Tian et al., 2011Tian H. Biehs B. Warming S. Leong K.G. Rangell L. Klein O.D. de Sauvage F.J. A reserve stem cell population in small intestine renders Lgr5-positive cells dispensable.Nature. 2011; 478: 255-259Crossref PubMed Scopus (849) Google Scholar) and harvested crypt cells the following day. Lgr5+ ISCs were lost after toxin treatment as expected (Figure S3C), whereas CD69+CD274+ cells remained (Figure 2B), indicating that the populations are distinct. Moreover, few CD69+CD274+ cells took up bromodeoxyuridine (Figure 2C), revealing that they are largely quiescent. CD69+CD274+ cells were absent from Atoh1−/− intestines and their mRNA profile matched that of Sec-Pro (Figure 2D), indicating that they belong to the Sec lineage. Although Cd69 and Cd274 are expressed in Bmi1Gfp cells (Figure S3A), analysis of all mRNAs present at different levels in various Sec populations suggested that fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS)-sorted Bmi1Gfp and CD69+CD274+ cells are distinct entities. K-means clustering of differential mRNAs confirmed the close relation of Bmi1Gfp to EE cells and revealed that CD69+CD274+ cells most resemble goblet cells (Figure 2E). Indeed, the CD69+CD274+ population lacks Chga, Cck, Ghrl, and other abundant EE transcripts but selectively expresses known goblet cell genes (Pelaseyed et al., 2014Pelaseyed T. Bergström J.H. Gustafsson J.K. Ermund A. Birchenough G.M. Schütte A. van der Post S. Svensson F. Rodríguez-Piñeiro A.M.

Thus, CD69+CD274+ crypt cells represent a wild-type Sec population that is anatomically close to the ISC zone and strongly biased toward goblet cell differentiation. Lineage tracing studies have elegantly revealed the origins of new Lgr5+ ISC, generally days or weeks after injury to the native ISC pool (Barker, 2014Barker N. Adult intestinal stem cells: critical drivers of epithelial homeostasis and regeneration.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2014; 15: 19-33Crossref PubMed Scopus (763) Google Scholar). To detect such a transition in Bmi1Gfp cells, we confirmed that 10 Gy whole-body γ-irradiation eliminates Lgr5+ ISCs, as reported previously (Metcalfe et al., 2014Metcalfe C. Kljavin N.M. Ybarra R. de Sauvage F.J. Lgr5+ stem cells are indispensable for radiation-induced intestinal regeneration.Cell Stem Cell. 2014; 14: 149-159Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (366) Google Scholar), delivered this dose to Bmi1Gfp mice, and isolated GFP+ cells 36 hr later. Because the Lgr5 locus is unmodified in these mice, GFP+ cells originate exclusively in the Bmi1Gfp population, and the short interval enabled capture of cells during their possible conversion to GFP− ISCs. Irradiated Bmi1Gfp mice yielded three to four times more GFP+ cells than unirradiated controls, as reported previously (Tian et al., 2011Tian H. Biehs B. Warming S. Leong K.G. Rangell L. Klein O.D. de Sauvage F.J. A reserve stem cell population in small intestine renders Lgr5-positive cells dispensable.Nature. 2011; 478: 255-259Crossref PubMed Scopus (849) Google Scholar, Yan et al., 2012Yan K.S. Chia L.A. Li X. Ootani A. Su J. Lee J.Y. Su N. Luo Y. Heilshorn S.C. Amieva M.R. et al.The intestinal stem cell markers Bmi1 and Lgr5 identify two functionally distinct populations.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2012; 109: 466-471Crossref PubMed Scopus (594) Google Scholar). After irradiation, Bmi1Gfp cells showed mRNA features that normally signify either Bmi1Gfp cells or Lgr5+ ISCs (but not both); reduced levels of otherwise abundant and specific transcripts, such as the Serpina1 cluster, were particularly evident (Figure 3A). RT-PCR analysis of changes in Bmi1Gfp cells, compared to bulk crypt cells isolated before and after irradiation, demonstrated the specificity of this response (Figures 3B and S3E). Thus, radiation-induced loss of native ISCs forces Bmi1Gfp cells into a genuine transition. To determine whether CD69+CD274+ cells also can revert into ISCs, we were sensitive to the possibility that, beyond eliminating Lgr5+ cells, γ-irradiation might directly affect other cell types. We therefore treated Lgr5Dtr-Gfp mice with diphtheria toxin, which ablates Lgr5+ ISCs selectively (Tian et al., 2011Tian H. Biehs B. Warming S. Leong K.G. Rangell L. Klein O.D. de Sauvage F.J. A reserve stem cell population in small intestine renders Lgr5-positive cells dispensable.Nature. 2011; 478: 255-259Crossref PubMed Scopus (849) Google Scholar). We verified that Lgr5+ ISCs begin to return 2 days after the last dose of toxin and harvested CD69+CD274+ cells 1 day after this final dose, i.e., while GFP+ cells are absent from the crypt (Figure S3C). We observed attenuation of CD69+CD274+ cell-specific genes and clear activation of genes ordinarily expressed only in ISCs (Figure 3C). PCA placed post-toxin cells in a discrete group, related more closely than parental CD69+CD274+ cells to Lgr5+ ISC (Figure 3D), and at least half among a panel of 12 stringently defined ISC-specific genes (Muñoz et al., 2012Muñoz J. Stange D.E. Schepers A.G. van de Wetering M. Koo B.K. Itzkovitz S. Volckmann R. Kung K.S. Koster J. Radulescu S. et al.The Lgr5 intestinal stem cell signature: robust expression of proposed quiescent '+4′ cell markers.EMBO J. 2012; 31: 3079-3091Crossref PubMed Scopus (535) Google Scholar) were reproducibly activated in CD69+CD274+ cells during ISC recovery (Figures 3E and 3F). Similar gain of ISC-specific transcripts was not evident in bulk crypt cells isolated before and after toxin treatment (Figures 3G and S3F). Thus, after ISC loss, mRNA changes in CD69+CD274+ cells represent another authentic and active transition toward ISCs. Of note, only 5 and 33 of the hundreds of transcripts altered after ISC loss in CD69+CD274+ and Bmi1Gfp cells, respectively, correspond to the 212 genes linked to “Cell proliferation” in Gene Ontology. These changes in gene expression and cell identity must have a basis in chromatin. We have reported, however, that the active histone marks H3K4me2 and H3K27ac appear at the same genome sites in specified Sec- and Ent-Pros (Kim et al., 2014Kim T.H. Li F. Ferreiro-Neira I. Ho L.L. Luyten A. Nalapareddy K. Long H. Verzi M. Shivdasani R.A. Broadly permissive intestinal chromatin underlies lateral inhibition and cell plasticity.Nature. 2014; 506: 511-515Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). To confirm these findings at nucleosome resolution, we digested chromatin from Pro cells with micrococcal nuclease and repeated chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing (ChIP-seq) for these histone marks (Table S1). Global analysis of the data confirmed near identity of Sec- and Ent-Pro profiles (Figure S4A), as reflected in the findings at the lineage-restricted Notch1 and Dll1 loci (Figure 4A). These data underscore the need to identify a basis other than active histone marks for differentiation and dediferentiation of intestinal crypt cells.

While BAR domain proteins such as endophilin have been reported in dynamin-independent scission of tubular membrane necks, the cutting mechanism has yet to be deciphered. Here, we combine a theoretical model, in vitro, and in vivo experiments revealing how protein scaffolds may cut tubular membranes. We demonstrate that the protein scaffold bound to the underlying tube creates a frictional barrier for lipid diffusion; tube elongation thus builds local membrane tension until the membrane undergoes scission through lysis. We call this mechanism friction-driven scission (FDS). In cells, motors pull tubes, particularly during endocytosis. Through reconstitution, we show that motors not only can pull out and extend protein-scaffolded tubes but also can cut them by FDS. FDS is generic, operating even in the absence of amphipathic helices in the BAR domain, and could in principle apply to any high-friction protein and membrane assembly."

Apolipoprotein L1 (APOL1) gene variants G1 and G2, but not the reference allele (G0), are associated with an increased risk of CKD in individuals of recent African ancestry. Here we show in two large, unrelated cohorts that decline in kidney function associated with APOL1 risk variants was dependent on plasma suPAR levels: APOL1-related risk was attenuated in patients with lower suPAR, and strengthened in those with higher suPAR levels. Mechanistically, surface plasmon resonance studies identified high-affinity interactions between suPAR, APOL1 and αvβ3 integrin, whereby APOL1 protein variants G1 and G2 exhibited higher affinity for suPAR-activated avb3 integrin than APOL1 G0. APOL1 G1 or G2 augments αvβ3 integrin activation and causes proteinuria in mice in a suPAR-dependent manner. The synergy of circulating factor suPAR and APOL1 G1 or G2 on αvβ3 integrin activation is a mechanism for CKD."
https://openalex.org/W2648229824,"FGF19 acts directly on skeletal muscle to increase its mass, and treatment with the hormone ameliorates muscle atrophy in three mouse models. The endocrine-derived hormone fibroblast growth factor (FGF) 19 has recently emerged as a potential target for treating metabolic disease1. Given that skeletal muscle is a key metabolic organ, we explored the role of FGF19 in that tissue. Here we report a novel function of FGF19 in regulating skeletal muscle mass through enlargement of muscle fiber size, and in protecting muscle from atrophy. Treatment with FGF19 causes skeletal muscle hypertrophy in mice, while physiological and pharmacological doses of FGF19 substantially increase the size of human myotubes in vitro. These effects were not elicited by FGF21, a closely related endocrine FGF member. Both in vitro and in vivo, FGF19 stimulates the phosphorylation of the extracellular-signal-regulated protein kinase 1/2 (ERK1/2) and the ribosomal protein S6 kinase (S6K1), an mTOR-dependent master regulator of muscle cell growth. Moreover, mice with a skeletal-muscle-specific genetic deficiency of β-Klotho (KLB), an obligate co-receptor for FGF15/19 (refs. 2,3), were unresponsive to the hypertrophic effect of FGF19. Finally, in mice, FGF19 ameliorates skeletal muscle atrophy induced by glucocorticoid treatment or obesity, as well as sarcopenia. Taken together, these findings provide evidence that the enterokine FGF19 is a novel factor in the regulation of skeletal muscle mass, and that it has therapeutic potential for the treatment of muscle wasting."
https://openalex.org/W2646486909,"In mice, various instinctive behaviors can be triggered by olfactory input. Despite growing knowledge of the brain regions involved in such behaviors, the organization of the neural circuits that convert olfactory input into stereotyped behavioral output remains poorly understood. Here, we mapped the neural circuit responsible for enhancing sexual receptivity of female mice by a male pheromone, exocrine gland-secreting peptide 1 (ESP1). We revealed specific neural types and pathways by which ESP1 information is conveyed from the peripheral receptive organ to the motor-regulating midbrain via the amygdala-hypothalamus axis. In the medial amygdala, a specific type of projection neurons gated ESP1 signals to the ventromedial hypothalamus (VMH) in a sex-dependent manner. In the dorsal VMH, which has been associated with defensive behaviors, a selective neural subpopulation discriminately mediated ESP1 information from a predator cue. Together, our data illuminate a labeled-line organization for controlling pheromone-mediated sexual behavioral output in female mice."

Contrary to previous reports that PNNs inhibit processes involving plasticity, here we report that the dynamic regulation of PNN expression in the adult auditory cortex is vital for fear learning and consolidation in response to pure tones. Specifically, after first confirming the necessity of auditory cortical activity for fear learning and consolidation, we observed that mRNA levels of key proteoglycan components of PNNs were enhanced 4 hr after fear conditioning but were no longer different from the control groups 24 hr later. A similar pattern of regulation was observed in numbers of cells surrounded by PNNs and area occupied by them in the auditory cortex. Finally, the removal of auditory cortex PNNs resulted in a deficit in fear learning and consolidation."

This mechanism improves the root’s ability to withstand the accompanying environmental stresses and to resume growth when optimal temperatures are restored. All organisms have evolved to cope with various stresses in their environment, ensuring the optimal combination of proliferation and survival. One of the most important and frequently changing environmental stresses that an organism must be able to cope with is temperature stress, which is induced by sub- or supra-optimal temperatures. The negative effects of temperature stress on human, animal, and plant life have been well studied, however, we have little knowledge on how temperature stress impacts the properties of stem cells and/or their niches and how they respond to and recover from its effects. Stem cells and their lineage-committed progenies are vital for the development and growth of multicellular organisms. The quiescence, self-renewal, and differentiation of stem cells are regulated not just by local signals from within the niche, but also by systemic signals from outside the tissue (Hsu and Fuchs, 2012Hsu Y.C.

Stem-cell niches: nursery rhymes across kingdoms.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2007; 8: 345-354Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar). In the model dicot plant Arabidopsis thaliana (Arabidopsis), the root stem cell niche is made of a central organizing center known as the quiescent center (QC) and one layer of adjacent stem cells surrounding it (Scheres et al., 2002Scheres B. Benfey P. Dolan L. Root development.Arabidopsis Book. 2002; 1: e0101Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The behavior and activity of the QC and surrounding stem cells are determined by an auxin maximum in the QC, which is generated and stabilized by PINFORMED (PIN)-mediated auxin transport (Blilou et al., 2005Blilou I.

Both low (4°C) and high (29°C) temperatures have been shown to alter PIN-mediated auxin transport in the Arabidopsis root (Hanzawa et al., 2013Hanzawa T. Shibasaki K. Numata T. Kawamura Y. Gaude T.

Many plants, including Arabidopsis (Gilmour et al., 1988Gilmour S.J. Hajela R.K. Thomashow M.F. Cold Acclimation in Arabidopsis thaliana.Plant Physiol. 1988; 87: 745-750Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), develop a greater ability to withstand freezing after they have been exposed to a short period, usually 1 or 2 days, of chilling stress induced by low but above-freezing temperatures (Hincha and Zuther, 2014Hincha D.K. Zuther E. Plant cold acclimation and freezing tolerance.Methods Mol. Biol. 2014; 1166: 1-6Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar, Sung and Amasino, 2005Sung S. Amasino R.M.

Plant cold acclimation: freezing tolerance genes and regulatory mechanisms.Annu. Rev. Plant Physiol. Plant Mol. Biol. 1999; 50: 571-599Crossref PubMed Scopus (2654) Google Scholar). This relatively quick response, termed cold acclimation, is necessary before plants can survive the colder temperatures of winter and ensures that plants recover and flourish quickly in the spring. Up to now, however, little is known about the adaptive process of cold acclimation in the root stem cell niche, despite the fact that optimum root development and function are essential for bolstering plant growth and crop productivity under climate change (Den Herder et al., 2010Den Herder G.

Food: An underground revolution.Nature. 2010; 466: 552-553Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). Here, we report, using the Arabidopsis root as a model system for study, that chilling stress (at 4°C) leads to DNA damage predominantly in the root stem cells and their early descendants and causes a loss of PIN-mediated auxin maximum in the QC after one round of the division of the columella stem cells (CSCs). To maintain the integrity of QC and root stem cells under chilling stress, an ataxia telangiectasia mutated (ATM), ATM and RAD3-related (ATR), and WEE1-mediated DNA damage response pathway is activated that induces death of newly generated/differentiating columella stem cell daughters (CSCDs) and so disrupts the directional flow of auxin, leading to the re-establishment of auxin maximum in the QC that preserves root stem cells in a quiescent state. This chilling stress-specific sacrifice-for-survival mechanism not only protects the stem cell niche from chilling stress but also improves the root’s ability to withstand the accompanying environmental stresses and to recover when ambient temperatures rise to the optimal levels. To assess the responses of root stem cells to chilling stress, Arabidopsis seedlings were exposed to control (22°C) or low but above-freezing temperature (4°C) for different durations before analysis. After 16 hr at 4°C, CSCDs of ∼20% of seedling roots were found to take up propidium iodide (PI), which is able to enter dead cells but are impermeable to live cells (Figures 1A–1C ). At 24 hr after chilling stress, the percentage of roots with dead CSCDs increased to ∼60% to 70% and until 72 hr, the percentage did not increase significantly (Figure 1C). Over the course of a 72-hr study, chilling stress-induced death of the QC and stem cells was also observed but at a much lower frequency (Figure S1A), suggesting that CSCDs are particularly vulnerable when exposed to chilling stress.Figure S1Chilling Stress Induces Cell Death Preferentially in CSCDs and Rapidly Induces DNA Damage and DNA Damage Response in the Arabidopsis Root, Related to Figure 1Show full caption(A) Chilling stress induces death of different types of cells in the Arabidopsis root tip.

Using terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase (TdT)-mediated 2'-deoxyuridine 5'-triphosphate (dUTP) nick end labeling (TUNEL), we investigated the occurrence of DNA fragmentation in Arabidopsis root cells subjected to chilling stress for 24 hr. Intriguingly, TUNEL-positive nuclei were detected predominantly in root stem cells and their early descendants (Figures 1D and 1E), indicating that these cells are prone to DNA damage induced by chilling stress. Moreover, γ-H2AX foci, a highly sensitive marker for the detection of DNA damage induced by double strand breaks in DNA (Mah et al., 2010Mah L.J. El-Osta A. Karagiannis T.C. gammaH2AX: a sensitive molecular marker of DNA damage and repair.Leukemia. 2010; 24: 679-686Crossref PubMed Scopus (817) Google Scholar), were increasingly observed from 12 hr to 24 hr after chilling stress at 4°C (Figures S1C–S1H), but were less detected in loss-of-function mutants of ATR and ATM that phosphorylate H2AX to yield γ-H2AX in response to DNA damage (Maréchal and Zou, 2013Maréchal A. Zou L. DNA damage sensing by the ATM and ATR kinases.Cold Spring Harb. Perspect. Biol. 2013; 5: a012716Crossref PubMed Scopus (812) Google Scholar) (Figures S1I and S1J). These findings suggest that chilling stress-induced death of CSCDs involves a functional DNA damage response mediated by ATR, ATM, and their downstream targets. Consistent with this hypothesis, in atr, atm-1, and wee1 mutants, which are unable to efficiently transduce DNA damage signals (Culligan et al., 2004Culligan K. Tissier A. Britt A.

Unlike other stem cell daughters, CSCDs do not have the ability to divide and are committed for differentiation (Bennett et al., 2014Bennett T. van den Toorn A. Willemsen V. Scheres B.

We thus hypothesized that differentiating CSCDs are more sensitive to chilling stress-induced DNA damage than undifferentiated or fully differentiated cells. To test this hypothesis, we generated a synthetic tracking system (PIN3::CRE-GR 35S::LoxP-Ter-LoxP-VENUS) that, upon induction by dexamethasone (DEX), marks fully differentiated columella root cap cells with 35S promoter-driven constitutive expression of the fluorescent protein VENUS. As a result, newly generated or newly differentiated columella root cap cells are VENUS-free after removal of DEX, allowing the occurrence of CSC division and the phenotype of newly generated CSCDs to be readily determined. An average increase in the number of VENUS-free columella root cap layer was observed every 24 hr through the 96 hr test at 22°C (Figures 2A and S2A), indicating the occurrence of multiple rounds of CSC division. By contrast, at 4°C only a single round of CSC division could possibly occur (Figures 2B and S2B) and, in agreement with our hypothesis, cell death was observed only when new CSCDs were generated (Figure 2B). Moreover, the death of newly-generated/differentiating CSCDs was not accompanied by a change in the cell-specific expression pattern of CSC (J2341; Figure S3A) and QC (WOX5:: GFP; Figure S3B) markers, indicating that QC cells and CSCs could maintain their identities under chilling stress.Figure S2Auxin Levels in the Root Tip Are Decisive for CSC Division, Related to Figure 2Show full caption(A–F) Quantification of numbers of VENUS-free columella cell layers in roots of PIN3::CRE-GR 35S::LoxP-Ter-LoxP-VENUS seedlings treated with mock (A and B), 1 nM IAA (C and D) or 50 nM yucasin (E and F).

Error bars represent standard error of the mean. (n = 3 biological replicates). Division of cells in the root stem cell niche is regulated by an auxin maximum in the QC and by a local auxin gradient at the root tip, which is generated and stabilized by PIN-mediated auxin transport (Grieneisen et al., 2007Grieneisen V.A. Xu J. Marée A.F. Hogeweg P. Scheres B. Auxin transport is sufficient to generate a maximum and gradient guiding root growth.Nature. 2007; 449: 1008-1013Crossref PubMed Scopus (626) Google Scholar). Chilling stress was previously reported to inhibit PIN2 and PIN3 expression as well as basipetal auxin transport in the Arabidopsis root (Shibasaki et al., 2009Shibasaki K. Uemura M. Tsurumi S. Rahman A. Auxin response in Arabidopsis under cold stress: underlying molecular mechanisms.Plant Cell. 2009; 21: 3823-3838Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar), indicating that the observed phenotypes of CSCs and CSCDs might be due to chilling stress-induced changes in auxin levels and distribution. We found that the single round of CSC division occurred within the first 24 hr of chilling stress was largely blocked by addition of as low as 1 nM indole-3-acetic acid (IAA; a natural auxin) (Figures 2C, 2D, S2A–S2D, S4A, S4B, S4D, S4E, and S4G) and, as a result, a significantly low percentage of CSCD death was observed (Figures 2D and S4H) despite the presence of chilling stress-induced DNA damage (Figure S1N). Conversely, when IAA biosynthesis was inhibited by 50 nM yucasin (Nishimura et al., 2014Nishimura T. Hayashi K. Suzuki H. Gyohda A. Takaoka C. Sakaguchi Y. Matsumoto S. Kasahara H. Sakai T. Kato J. et al.Yucasin is a potent inhibitor of YUCCA, a key enzyme in auxin biosynthesis.Plant J. 2014; 77: 352-366Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar), a higher incidence of CSC division and CSCD death was noted at 4°C (Figures 2E, 2F, S2A, S2B, S2E, S2F, S4A, S4C, S4D, S4F, S4G, and S4I). But ATR, ATM, and WEE1-mediated DNA damage response remained indispensable for the induction of CSCD death (Figures S1B and S1O–S1V). These findings confirm the first part of our hypothesis that chilling stress-induced changes in root tip auxin levels would contribute to the induction of CSC division and CSCD death. More importantly, our results suggest that auxin can be applied to promote the quiescence of CSCs and subsequently prevent the occurrence of CSC division and CSCD death under chilling stress. We next asked whether chilling stress acts through modification of auxin distribution to trigger CSCD death. To this end, we explored the effect of chilling stress and the consequences of CSC division and CSCD death on root tip auxin distributions both in vivo and in silico, using an iterative experimental and computational approach. After 24 hr at 4°C, expression levels of PIN::PIN-GFP and PIN::GUS displayed pronounced changes compared with the controls at 22°C (Figures 3A–3V , see also Model Figures 2 and 3 of Data S1). Chilling stress increased the expression of PIN2::PIN2-GFP (Figures 3C and 3D) and PIN2::GUS (Figures 3O and 3P) but reduced the expression of other PIN::PIN-GFP and PIN::GUS including PIN1::PIN1-GFP (Figures 3A and 3B), PIN3::PIN3-GFP (Figures 3E and 3F), PIN4::PIN4-GFP (Figures 3G and 3H), PIN7:PIN7-GFP (Figures 3I and 3J), PIN1::GUS (Figures 3M and 3N), PIN3::GUS (Figures 3Q and 3R), PIN4::GUS (Figures 3S and 3T), and PIN7:GUS (Figures 3U and 3V). These changes were associated with an overall reduction in the expression of the auxin responsive DR5::GFP (Figures 3K and 3L) while the DR5::GFP expression maximum in the QC was maintained (Figures 3K and 3L). Thus, our results suggest that the primary root of Arabidopsis, when exposed to chilling stress, has the ability to maintain the auxin maximum in the QC, which is essential for the maintenance of the QC and stem cell integrity. We next fed the observed PIN::PIN-GFP and PIN::GUS expression changes into a dual-mechanism model (Mironova et al., 2012Mironova V.V. Omelyanchuk N.A. Novoselova E.S. Doroshkov A.V. Kazantsev F.V. Kochetov A.V. Kolchanov N.A. Mjolsness E. Likhoshvai V.A. Combined in silico/in vivo analysis of mechanisms providing for root apical meristem self-organization and maintenance.Ann. Bot. (Lond.). 2012; 110: 349-360Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar) and simulated the consequences of CSC division and CSCD death on PIN-mediated auxin re-distribution in the root tip exposed to chilling stress (Figures 4A and 4B ; Data S1). Consistent with the experimental findings obtained from the analysis of DR5::GFP expression (Figures 3K and 3L), in silico analysis showed that differential changes in PIN::PIN-GFP and PIN::GUS expression led to a new steady-state equilibrium of auxin distribution in chilling-stressed root, despite an overall decline in auxin levels (Figures 4A and 4B). In this new steady state, however, the division of CSCs caused a loss of auxin maximum in the QC (Figures 4A and 4B), which could be restored only if the death of newly generated/differentiating CSCDs occurred (Figures 4A and 4B). By contrast, CSC division at normal temperature had no effect on the maintenance of auxin maximum in the QC (Figures 4A and 4B). These results together indicate that under chilling stress, the death of newly generated/differentiating CSCDs is necessary for the re-establishment of auxin maximum in the QC. In agreement with our model prediction that CSCD death increases the auxin concentration in the QC (Figure 4B, inset chart), roots with chilling stress-induced CSCD death displayed a higher DR5::GFP (Figures 5A, 5B , and S3C) and WOX5::GFP expression (Figures 5C, 5D, and S3D) in the QC than those without. We thus concluded that CSCD death was the strategy used by the root to sustain the auxin maximum (as indicated by DR5::GFP) in the QC and so maintain the associated QC activity (as indicated by WOX5::GFP) under chilling stress. To further evaluate the role of CSCD death in the maintenance of integrity of QC and root stem cells under chilling stress, we used the DEX-inducible GAL4-VP16-GR (GVG)/UAS system and the artificial microRNA (amiRNA) technology (Schwab et al., 2006Schwab R.

This study was aimed to determine the risk of developing T2DM 10 years after GDM in Sri Lankan women.A retrospective cohort study was conducted in the Colombo district, Sri Lanka. 7205 women who delivered a child in 2005 were identified through Public Health Midwives in the field. Women with antenatal records were interviewed and relevant data were extracted from medical records to identify potential participants. One hundred and nineteen women who had GDM and 240 women who did not have GDM were recruited. Current diagnosis of diabetes was based on history, relevant medical records and blood reports within the past 1 year.The mean duration of follow up was 10.9 (SD = 0.35) years in the GDM group and 10.8 (SD = 0.31) years in the non-GDM group. The incidence density of diabetes in the GDM group was 56.3 per 1000 person years compared to 5.4 per 1000 person years in non GDM group giving a rate ratio of 10.42 (95% CI: 6.01-19.12). A woman having GDM in the index pregnancy was 10.6 times more likely to develop diabetes within 10 years compared to women with no GDM after controlling for other confounding variables. Delivering a child after 30 years, being treated with insulin during the pregnancy and delivering a baby weighing more than 3.5 Kg were significant predictors of development of T2DM after controlling for family history of diabetes mellitus (DM), GDM in previous pregnancies, parity and gestational age at delivery.Women with GDM had a 10-fold higher risk of developing T2DM during a 10-year follow up period as compared to women with no GDM after controlling for other confounding variables."
https://openalex.org/W2723491065,"The relationship between skeletal muscle volume and the prognosis of patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) remains undetermined. We conducted a retrospective study of 72 IBD patients who were admitted to the hospital due to disease exacerbation. We enrolled IBD patients who had undergone abdominal computed tomography and assessed the nutritional indices, such as the Onodera’s prognostic nutritional index (O-PNI) and the controlling nutritional status (CONUT) index. The L3 skeletal muscle index (SMI), which is the ratio of the cross-sectional area of skeletal muscles at the level of the third lumbar (L3) vertebra to the height squared, was used to identify sarcopenia. Sarcopenia, defined as a low SMI, was observed in 42% of all IBD patients (37% with Crohn’s disease (CD) and 48% with ulcerative colitis (UC)). In UC patients, the O-PNI and CONUT values, height, and albumin levels were significantly lower than in CD patients. The SMI strongly correlated with sex, body weight, albumin level, and O-PNI in IBD patients. Multivariate analysis using the Cox regression model demonstrated that the presence of sarcopenia (P = 0.015) and disease type (CD or UC) (P = 0.007) were significant factors predicting intestinal resection. The cumulative operation-free survival rate was significantly lower for sarcopenic patients than in all IBD patients (P = 0.003) and a stratified analysis of CD patients (P = 0.001) using the Kaplan–Meier method and log-rank test. The L3 skeletal muscle area is a prognostic factor for intestinal resection in patients with CD."

In this study, we found and identified a novel strain of Trichoderma asperellum, named GDFS1009. The mycelium of T. asperellum GDFS1009 exhibits a high growth rate, high sporulation capacity, and strong inhibitory effects against pathogens that cause cucumber fusarium wilt and corn stalk rot. T. asperellum GDFS1009 secretes chitinase, glucanase, and protease, which can degrade the cell walls of fungi and contribute to mycoparasitism. The secreted xylanases are good candidates for inducing plant resistance and enhancing plant immunity against pathogens. RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) showed that T. asperellum GDFS1009 produces primary metabolites that are precursors of antimicrobial compounds; it also produces a variety of antimicrobial secondary metabolites, including polyketides and alkanes. In addition, this study speculated the presence of six antimicrobial peptides via ultra-performance liquid chromatography quadrupole time of flight mass spectrometry (UPLC-QTOF-MS/MS). Future studies should focus on these antimicrobial metabolites for facilitating widespread application in the field of agricultural bio-control."

How to obtain functional desirable cell types is one of the fundamental scientific questions in regenerative medicine and holds great promise in biomedical applications. In recent years, lineage reprogramming has emerged as a promising strategy to induce cell fate transition by introducing a combination of cell-type-specific transcription factors, which has made remarkable advances in generating diverse cell types and functional subtypes, bypassing the tumorigenic pluripotent stage. Chemical reprogramming has bloomed as a new approach to generate different functional cell types (Cao et al., 2016Cao N. Huang Y. Zheng J. Spencer C.I. Zhang Y. Fu J.D. Nie B. Xie M. Zhang M.

Compared with the transgenic approach to induce lineage reprogramming, the chemical approach is more promising, because small-molecule compounds are cell permeable, reversible, and easily manufactured and can be fine-tuned in terms of concentration, duration, structure, and combination (Li et al., 2017Li X.

Liu K. Tang S. Ding S. Chemical approaches to cell reprogramming.Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 2014; 28: 50-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). The chemical reprogramming approach provides an alternative methodology for manipulating cell fates, avoiding the risk of genome integration through the use of exogenous transcriptional factors. Very recently, our group has established a robust system to induce pluripotency from mouse somatic cells through a defined three-step chemical induction, in which the first step is to induce a unique epithelial extra-embryonic endoderm (XEN)-like state (Hou et al., 2013Hou P. Li Y. Zhang X. Liu C. Guan J. Li H. Zhao T. Ye J. Yang W. Liu K. et al.Pluripotent stem cells induced from mouse somatic cells by small-molecule compounds.Science. 2013; 341: 651-654Crossref PubMed Scopus (990) Google Scholar, Zhao et al., 2015Zhao Y.

Yang S. et al.A XEN-like state bridges somatic cells to pluripotency during chemical reprogramming.Cell. 2015; 163: 1678-1691Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar): After the first stage of chemical induction, the master genes governing the XEN cell state (Sall4, Sox17, Gata4, and Gata6) are co-activated, contributing to the establishment of a defined XEN-like state. This epithelial XEN-like state clearly dissects the chemically induced pluripotent stem cell (CiPSC)-inducing process into defined stages, and this XEN-like state can be stably captured in culture with ready-to-use characteristics of downregulated hallmark fibroblast genes. These preliminary findings inspired us to further investigate and explore this featured XEN-like state. In this study, we sought to generate functional specified cell types via the XEN-like state, bypassing the pluripotent stage. By fine-tuning the chemical recipe, we proved the principle of inducing functional neurons from the chemically induced XEN-like cells using a stepwise induction strategy. Furthermore, we developed a robust system to expand these XEN-like cells over the long term, retaining genome stability and lineage-specifying competency for at least 20 passages, which provided a scalable system. Using similar principles, hepatocyte-like cells were also induced from XEN-like cells. These findings establish a multifunctional lineage reprogramming route to generate functional cell types conferred by a chemically induced XEN-like cell state. According to our previously established protocol to induce CiPSCs from fibroblasts, XEN-like primary colonies could be induced at an early stage of reprogramming with a seven-compound cocktail (VPA, CHIR99021, 616452, tranylcypromine, forskolin, AM580, and EPZ004777; VC6TFAE) (Zhao et al., 2015Zhao Y.

In this study, we focused on the XEN-like induction and optimized the chemical recipe by replacing each of the seven small molecules with the functional analogs. TD114-2 was identified as a more preferable GSK3-beta inhibitor than CHIR99021 (Kuo et al., 2003Kuo G.H. Prouty C. DeAngelis A. Shen L. O’Neill D.J. Shah C. Connolly P.J. Murray W.V. Conway B.R.

Thus, a small-molecule cocktail was identified to induce XEN-like cells from fibroblasts in a significantly improved manner.

In this study, we further explore the feasibility of inducing other functional cell fates from the XEN-like intermediated state. We set out to induce neuronal-like cells from the intermediate XEN-like state in the following studies.

The separate roles of these chemical inducers, as well as the gradients in the culture medium, were further identified by examining neural-, fibroblast-, and XEN-specific genes (Figure S1C). In addition, TauEGFP-positive cells could also be generated from CHIR-induced (VC6TFAE-induced) XEN-like cells, but with a lower efficiency (Figure 1E). By extending the neuronal specifying period, a number of the induced TauEGFP-positive colonies generated extensive TauEGFP-positive neurite-like branches (Figure 1F), indicating a maturing process. Taken together, these results show that neuronal-like cell fates could be induced from XEN-like cells after further neuronal specification. To explore the induced neuronal properties of these TauEGFP-positive cells, we examined the expression of typical pan-neuronal markers in these cells. Co-immunostaining revealed that the induced TauEGFP-positive cells with extensive neurite growth co-expressed multiple neuronal-specific proteins, including TUJ1, MAP2, NF-H, and surrounding synapsin-positive puncta (Figures 2A–2E). Furthermore, both excitatory glutamatergic neurons and inhibitory GABAergic neurons were generated after an extended neuronal specifying period for ∼18 days, as detected by the co-expression of vGLUT1 (80% efficiency) and the co-expression of GABA (5% efficiency) (Figures 2F and 2G). To better understand the properties of the induced cells, we performed RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) to analyze the expression pattern of the induced neurons. Hierarchical clustering analysis revealed that the induced neurons grouped closely with the primary neurons and distinguished from fibroblasts, with upregulated expression of functional synaptic genes and downregulated expression of fibroblast hallmark genes (Figures 1G and 1H). To further understand the reprogramming process, the genes whose expression was upregulated or downregulated by more than 2-fold or 10-fold compared to fibroblasts were selected for further analysis, respectively (Figures S1D and S1E). As the results revealed, the endogenous neural-fate-specific program was robustly upregulated while the endogenous fibroblast-fate-specific program was robustly downregulated after chemical induction (Figure S1D). Furthermore, upregulated genes were highly enriched in synaptic transmission, ion transport, neuron differentiation, and neuron development, crucial biological processes implicated in neurogenesis (Figure S1E), whereas downregulated genes were involved in cell adhesion, cell migration, and cell growth (Figure S1E). Together, these results demonstrate that these chemically induced neurons have a transcriptional profile resembling that of primary neurons and distinct from that of the original fibroblasts. To examine the electrophysiological functional properties of the induced neurons, we performed whole-cell patch-clamp recordings. By depolarizing the membrane in current-clamp mode, action potentials (APs) were elicited on the induced TauEGFP-positive neurons after a 12+12-day chemical induction (Figure S1F; Table S2A). In addition, in the voltage-clamp mode, fast, inactivating inward and outward currents were also recorded on the induced neurons, corresponding to the opening of voltage-dependent K+ and Na+ channels of these cells (Figure S1F; Table S2A). These results reveal that functional neurons can be induced using XEN-like-state-based chemical reprogramming. To further enhance the functional maturity, induced neuronal-like cells were re-plated onto a pre-existing monolayer culture of primary astrocytes, as previously reported (Li et al., 2015Li X. Zuo X. Jing J. Ma Y. Wang J. Liu D. Zhu J. Du X. Xiong L.

Direct conversion of fibroblasts to functional neurons by defined factors.Nature. 2010; 463: 1035-1041Crossref PubMed Scopus (2269) Google Scholar). After re-plating, induced TauEGFP-positive cells showed more complex neuronal morphologies, indicating a maturing process (Figure S1B). The functional membrane properties of induced cells were further improved (85%, n = 13) (Figures 2I–2K; Table S2A), and spontaneous excitatory postsynaptic currents (EPSCs) were recorded in induced TauEGFP-positive cells (54.5%, n = 11), which could be blocked by the specific receptor antagonists 6-cyano-1007-nitroquinoxaline-2,3-dione (CNQX) and 2-amino-5-phosphonovaleric acid (AP5) (Figure 2L). In addition, the mature neuronal transcriptional factor NEUN was also detected in up to 80% of induced TauEGFP-positive cells (Figure 2H). Furthermore, the functional subtype properties of induced neurons were confirmed by the induction of inward membrane currents by focal application of 100 μM glutamate (Figure 2M). These results reveal that the induced neurons show functional mature properties and are capable of forming functional synapses after further maturation. To further investigate and develop our established methods, we set out to reprogram newborn and adult fibroblasts. By employing the same protocol used to induce embryonic fibroblasts (Figure 1D), XEN-like-derived neurons could be efficiently generated from newborn fibroblasts (postnatal day 3) (Figure S1G; Table S2B). By reprogramming adult fibroblasts derived from >8-week-old mice, XEN-like cells could be induced with low efficiency (Figure S1H), which may have resulted from cell senescence during culturing. By providing two additional small-molecule compounds, vitamin C to suppress cell senescence and enhance cell proliferation and CH55 to enhance reprogramming efficiency, as previously reported (Ye et al., 2016Ye J. Ge J. Zhang X. Cheng L. Zhang Z. He S. Wang Y. Lin H. Yang W. Liu J. et al.Pluripotent stem cells induced from mouse neural stem cells and small intestinal epithelial cells by small molecule compounds.Cell Res. 2016; 26: 34-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar), the efficiency of generating XEN-like cells was significantly improved after a 12-day induction, and neuronal cells were also generated from these XEN-like cells following 12 days of neuronal specification (Figures S1H and 1D). These results reveal that our established methods can also be used to reprogram postnatal fibroblasts. To examine the in vivo functional competency of the induced neurons, we transplanted these resulting TauEGFP-positive neuronal cells into the striatum of adult mice (>8 weeks old). After 4 weeks of transplantation, surviving TauEGFP-positive cell grafts were clearly detected at the injected sites (Figures 2N and 2O). The neuronal identity and maturing properties of the cell transplants were further confirmed by co-immunostaining neuronal-specific genes (Figures 2O and 2P). To further confirm that our transplanted cells actually engrafted, we set out to investigate the possibility of cell-cell fusion after transplantation. Using a method to evaluate the cell-cell fusion by counting the nucleus numbers in single cells (Alvarez-Dolado et al., 2003Alvarez-Dolado M. Pardal R. Garcia-Verdugo J.M. Fike J.R. Lee H.O.

Human papillomavirus 16 E5 induces bi-nucleated cell formation by cell-cell fusion.Virology. 2009; 384: 125-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar), we carefully examined our transplanted brain slices. Grafted TauEGFP-positive neurons uniformly have a single nucleus, and no bi-nucleated or multiple-nucleated TauEGFP-positive cells were detected (Figure 2P). In addition, these grafted TauEGFP-positive cells in fresh brain slices also showed functionally electrophysiological properties (Figure 2Q). Taken together, these results indicate the in vivo functionality of XEN-like-state-derived neuronal cells. To examine the fibroblast origin of the induced neurons, we traced original fibroblasts expressing fibroblast-specific protein 1 (Fsp1) using the Cre-loxP system, as previously reported (Bhowmick et al., 2004Bhowmick N.A.

As the initial fibroblasts were not all tdTomato positive, after chemical induction, ∼30% of induced TauEGFP-positive colonies were tdTomato positive (Figures S2B and S2C). These TauEGFP and tdTomato double-positive cells could also develop into functional neurons after further neuronal specification (Figures S2D–S2F). These results provide direct genetic proof that functional neurons can be induced from fibroblast origins using this chemical induction strategy. We did not detect endogenous expression of hallmark pluripotent and neural progenitor genes throughout the chemical reprogramming process (Figures 3A and S2G; data not shown). To carefully investigate the possibility of inducing neural differentiation from a transient acquisition of the pluripotent state, we traced the endogenous expression of Oct4, as previously reported (Bar-Nur et al., 2015Bar-Nur O. Verheul C. Sommer A.G. Brumbaugh J. Schwarz B.A. Lipchina I. Huebner A.J. Mostoslavsky G. Hochedlinger K.

Biotechnol. 2015; 33: 769-774Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar) (Figure 3B and 3C). No tdTomato-positive colonies were detected after chemical induction, even after establishing a neuronal fate (Figure 3D and 3E). Together, these results reveal that this XEN-like-state-based chemical reprogramming approach for neuronal generation indeed bypasses the acquisition of pluripotency. To further examine the established method, we prepared chemically derived eXEN cell lines (CeXENs) from blastocysts as previously reported (Zhao et al., 2015Zhao Y. Zhao T. Guan J. Zhang X. Fu Y. Ye J. Zhu J. Meng G. Ge J. Yang S. et al.A XEN-like state bridges somatic cells to pluripotency during chemical reprogramming.Cell. 2015; 163: 1678-1691Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar) (Figures S3A and S3B). These CeXENs resembled fibroblast-derived XEN-like cells, expressed the key transcriptional factors governing the XEN state and cell fates toward three germ layers (Figures S3C and S4B), and could be induced to become neuronal cells (Figures S3D and S3E). These results reveal that blastocyst-derived XEN-like cells could also be induced to become neuronal cells by performing similar methods. To further explore the characters of the XEN-like state, we investigated the growth rate of chemically induced XEN-like cells. The induced XEN-like cells grew much faster (∼20 hr for doubling) than original fibroblasts (∼40 hr for doubling), at a rate comparable to CeXEN cells and slower than embryonic stem cells (ESCs) (∼15 hr for doubling) (Figure 4A). We further explored the expandability of these XEN-like intermediates. Using the TD114-2-based culture condition, XEN-like colonies could be expanded over the long term (at least 20 passages tested), even in a single-colony selecting and single-cell digesting manner, at an average ratio of 1:20–30 every 3–4 days (Figures 4B and 4C). Despite their highly expandable properties, no tumorigenesis was detected after injecting XEN-like cells into immunodeficient (severe combined immunodeficiency [SCID]) mice (XEN-like cells at passage 6 and passage 19 tested) (data not shown). In addition, as revealed by results of karyotype and comparative genomic hybridization (CGH) analysis, the long-term expanded XEN-like intermediates retained genetic integrity and genome stability (Figures 4D–4F; Tables S3A–S3D). Most importantly, besides retaining XEN-like expression patterns (Figures 4C and 4G), these expanded XEN-like cells retained their neuronal specifying potential without compromising their neuronal inducing efficiency, even after 20 passages (Figures 4H–4J; Table S2C). The resulting neurons from the long-term passaged XEN-like cells showed functional mature properties, grouped closely to primary neurons, and could be distinguished from fibroblasts in terms of their global expression pattern (Figures 4I and 4K). To understand the lineage plasticity of XEN-like cells, we performed RNA-seq analysis for single-colony-derived XEN-like cell lines. The results revealed that the fibroblast-specific transcriptional program were dramatically downregulated during the stage 1 XEN-like induction (Figure S4A). Furthermore, the results revealed a unique transcriptional character underlying the XEN-like state for co-expressing master genes governing cell fates toward three germ layers (Figure S4B), suggesting the potential lineage plasticity of the XEN-like intermediates. In addition to showing the transcriptional silence of a fibroblast-specific program (Figure S4A), and consistent with the results of the single-colony study, it was revealed by RT-PCR analysis that neuroectoderm-specific and XEN master genes were both upregulated accumulatively during the first stage of chemical induction toward the XEN-like state (Figures 3F and S4B; Table S4). Starting from the later stage of neuronal specification at day 12 (Figure 1D), XEN master genes were robustly downregulated (Figure 3F). To further examine and confirm the roles of the neural and XEN master genes in this featured lineage reprogramming, we knocked down these genes (Sox2 and Gata6) during the reprogramming process, which suppressed the generation of XEN-like colonies and blocked neuronal induction (Figures 3G and 3H), demonstrating the essential roles of these endogenous master genes in chemical reprogramming. Taken together, these results suggest that dynamic transcriptional changes occur during chemical reprogramming and reveal the essential factors for XEN-like-state-based lineage reprograming. To investigate whether the lineage plasticity of XEN-like cells is limited to neural lineage or ectoderm germ layer, we set out to induce XEN-like cells into hepatocytes of endoderm. Using the methods applied to generate neuronal cells, we modified the cultural medium to favor hepatic cell fate specification (Cai et al., 2007Cai J. Zhao Y. Liu Y. Ye F. Song Z. Qin H. Meng S.

https://openalex.org/W2720305698,"Purkinje cells of the primate cerebellum play critical but poorly understood roles in the execution of coordinated, accurate movements. Elucidating these roles has been hampered by a lack of techniques for manipulating spiking activity in these cells selectively—a problem common to most cell types in non-transgenic animals. To overcome this obstacle, we constructed AAV vectors carrying the channelrhodopsin-2 (ChR2) gene under the control of a 1 kb L7/Pcp2 promoter. We injected these vectors into the cerebellar cortex of rhesus macaques and tested vector efficacy in three ways. Immunohistochemical analyses confirmed selective ChR2 expression in Purkinje cells. Neurophysiological recordings confirmed robust optogenetic activation. Optical stimulation of the oculomotor vermis caused saccade dysmetria. Our results demonstrate the utility of AAV–L7–ChR2 for revealing the contributions of Purkinje cells to circuit function and behavior, and they attest to the feasibility of promoter-based, targeted, genetic manipulations in primates."
https://openalex.org/W2714870959,"Circular RNAs (circRNAs) are a unique class of endogenous RNAs which could be used as potential diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers of many diseases. Our study aimed to investigate circRNA profiles in human granulosa cells (GCs) during maternal aging and to uncover age-related circRNA variations that potentially reflect decreased oocyte competence. CircRNAs in GCs from in vitro fertilization (IVF) patients with young age (YA, ≤ 30 years) and advanced age (AA, ≥ 38 years) were profiled by microarray, and validated in 20 paired samples. The correlation between circRNAs expression and clinical characteristics was analyzed in additional 80 samples. Chip-based analysis revealed 46 up-regulated and 11 down-regulated circRNAs in AA samples (fold change > 2.0). Specifically, circRNA_103829, circRNA_103827 and circRNA_104816 were validated to be up-regulated, while circRNA_101889 was down-regulated in AA samples. After adjustment for gonadotropin treatment, only circRNA_103827 and circRNA_104816 levels were positively associated with maternal age (partial r = 0.332, P = 0.045; partial r = 0.473, P = 0.003; respectively). Moreover, circRNA_103827 and circRNA_104816 expressions in GCs were negatively correlated with the number of top quality embryos (r = -0.235, P = 0.036; r = -0.221, P = 0.049; respectively). Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis indicated that the performance of circRNA_103827 for live birth prediction reached 0.698 [0.570-0.825], with 77.2% sensitivity and 60.9% specificity (P = 0.006), and that of circRNA_104816 was 0.645 [0.507-0.783] (P = 0.043). Bioinformatics analysis revealed that both circRNAs were potentially involved in glucose metabolism, mitotic cell cycle, and ovarian steroidogenesis. Therefore, age-related up-regulation of circRNA_103827 and circRNA_104816 might be potential indicators of compromised follicular micro-environment which could be used to predict IVF prognosis, and improve female infertility management."
https://openalex.org/W2684400857,"Light affects sleep and wake behaviors by providing an indirect cue that entrains circadian rhythms and also by inducing a direct and rapid regulation of behavior. While circadian entrainment by light is well characterized at the molecular level, mechanisms that underlie the direct effect of light on behavior are largely unknown. In zebrafish, a diurnal vertebrate, we found that both overexpression and mutation of the neuropeptide prokineticin 2 (Prok2) affect sleep and wake behaviors in a light-dependent but circadian-independent manner. In light, Prok2 overexpression increases sleep and induces expression of galanin (galn), a hypothalamic sleep-inducing peptide. We also found that light-dependent, Prok2-induced sedation requires prokineticin receptor 2 (prokr2) and is strongly suppressed in galn mutants. These results suggest that Prok2 antagonizes the direct wake-promoting effect of light in zebrafish, in part through the induction of galn expression in the hypothalamus."
https://openalex.org/W2684055556,"Bone morphogenetic proteins 9 and 10 (BMP9/BMP10) are circulating cytokines with important roles in endothelial homeostasis. The aim of this study was to investigate the roles of BMP9 and BMP10 in mediating monocyte-endothelial interactions using an in vitro flow adhesion assay. Herein, we report that whereas BMP9/BMP10 alone had no effect on monocyte recruitment, at higher concentrations both cytokines synergized with tumor necrosis factor-α (TNFα) to increase recruitment to the vascular endothelium. The BMP9/BMP10-mediated increase in monocyte recruitment in the presence of TNFα was associated with up-regulated expression levels of E-selectin, vascular cell adhesion molecule (VCAM-1), and intercellular adhesion molecule 1 (ICAM-1) on endothelial cells. Using siRNAs to type I and II BMP receptors and the signaling intermediaries (Smads), we demonstrated a key role for ALK2 in the BMP9/BMP10-induced surface expression of E-selectin, and both ALK1 and ALK2 in the up-regulation of VCAM-1 and ICAM-1. The type II receptors, BMPR-II and ACTR-IIA were both required for this response, as was Smad1/5. The up-regulation of cell surface adhesion molecules by BMP9/10 in the presence of TNFα was inhibited by LDN193189, which inhibits ALK2 but not ALK1. Furthermore, LDN193189 inhibited monocyte recruitment induced by TNFα and BMP9/10. BMP9/10 increased basal IκBα protein expression, but did not alter p65/RelA levels. Our findings suggest that higher concentrations of BMP9/BMP10 synergize with TNFα to induce the up-regulation of endothelial selectins and adhesion molecules, ultimately resulting in increased monocyte recruitment to the vascular endothelium. This process is mediated mainly via the ALK2 type I receptor, BMPR-II/ACTR-IIA type II receptors, and downstream Smad1/5 signaling."

Methods Forty-two patients with AMI successfully treated with primary PCI underwent cardiovascular magnetic resonance after 4–6 days and 3 months. Cine imaging, late gadolinium enhancement, and T1-mapping (MOLLI) was performed at 1.5T. T1 values were measured in the myocardial tissue opposite of the infarct area. Myocardial ECV was calculated from native- and post-contrast T1 values in 35 patients, using a correction for synthetic hematocrit. Results Native T1 of remote myocardium significantly decreased between baseline and follow-up (1002 ± 39 to 985 ± 30ms, p<0.01). High remote native T1 at baseline was independently associated with a high C-reactive protein level (standardized Beta 0.32, p = 0.04) and the presence of microvascular injury (standardized Beta 0.34, p = 0.03). ECV of remote myocardium significantly decreased over time in patients with no LV dilatation (29 ± 3.8 to 27 ± 2.3%, p<0.01). In patients with LV dilatation, remote ECV remained similar over time, and was significantly higher at follow-up compared to patients without LV dilatation (30 ± 2.0 versus 27 ± 2.3%, p = 0.03). Conclusions In reperfused first-time AMI patients, native T1 of remote myocardium decreased from baseline to follow-up. ECV of remote myocardium decreased over time in patients with no LV dilatation, but remained elevated at follow-up in those who developed LV dilatation. Findings from this study may add to an increased understanding of the pathophysiological mechanisms of cardiac remodeling after AMI."

https://openalex.org/W2698587889,"Coral reefs are severely threatened and a principal strategy for their conservation is marine protected areas (MPAs). However the drivers of MPA performance are complex and there are likely to be trade-offs between different types of performance (e.g. conservation or welfare related outcomes). We compiled a global dataset from expert knowledge for 76 coral reef MPAs in 33 countries and identified a set of performance measures reflecting ecological and socio-economic outcomes, achievement of aims and reduction of threats, using spatial or temporal comparisons wherever possible. We wanted to test the extent to which distinct types of performance occurred simultaneously, understood as win-win outcomes. Although certain performance measures were correlated, most were not, suggesting trade-offs that limit the usefulness of composite performance scores. Hypotheses were generated as to the impact of MPA features, aims, location, management and contextual variables on MPA performance from the literature. A multivariate analysis was used to test hypotheses as to the relative importance of these ""drivers"" on eight uncorrelated performance measures. The analysis supported some hypotheses (e.g. benefit provision for the local community improved performance), but not others (e.g. higher overall budget and more research activity did not). Factors endogenous to the MPA (such as size of the no-take area) were generally more significant drivers of performance than exogenous ones (such as national GDP). Different types of performance were associated with different drivers, exposing the trade-offs inherent in management decisions. The study suggests that managers are able to influence MPA performance in spite of external threats and could inform adaptive management by providing an approach to test for the effects of MPA features and management actions in different contexts and so to inform decisions for allocation of effort or funds to achieve specific goals."
https://openalex.org/W2713764291,"The robust glycolytic metabolism of glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) has proven them susceptible to increases in oxidative metabolism induced by the pyruvate mimetic dichloroacetate (DCA). Recent reports demonstrate that the anti-diabetic drug metformin enhances the damaging oxidative stress associated with DCA treatment in cancer cells. We sought to elucidate the role of metformin’s reported activity as a mitochondrial complex I inhibitor in the enhancement of DCA cytotoxicity in VM-M3 GBM cells. Metformin potentiated DCA-induced superoxide production, which was required for enhanced cytotoxicity towards VM-M3 cells observed with the combination. Similarly, rotenone enhanced oxidative stress resultant from DCA treatment and this too was required for the noted augmentation of cytotoxicity. Adenosine monophosphate kinase (AMPK) activation was not observed with the concentration of metformin required to enhance DCA activity. Moreover, addition of an activator of AMPK did not enhance DCA cytotoxicity, whereas an inhibitor of AMPK heightened the cytotoxicity of the combination. Our data indicate that metformin enhancement of DCA cytotoxicity is dependent on complex I inhibition. Particularly, that complex I inhibition cooperates with DCA-induction of glucose oxidation to enhance cytotoxic oxidative stress in VM-M3 GBM cells."
https://openalex.org/W2723569627,"The amyloid precursor protein (APP) has long been appreciated for its role in Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathology. However, less is known about the physiologic function of APP outside of AD. Particularly, whether and how APP may regulate functions of cell surface receptors, including GPCRs, remains largely unclear. In this study, we identified a novel direct interaction between APP and the α2A-adrenergic receptor (α2AAR) that occurs at the intracellular domains of both proteins. The APP interaction with α2AAR is promoted by agonist stimulation and competes with arrestin 3 binding to the receptor. Consequently, the presence of APP attenuates α2AAR internalization and desensitization, which are arrestin-dependent processes. Furthermore, in neuroblastoma neuro-2A cells and primary superior cervical ganglion neurons, where APP is highly expressed, the lack of APP leads to a dramatic increase in plasma membrane recruitment of endogenous arrestin 3 following α2AAR activation. Concomitantly, agonist-induced internalization of α2AAR is significantly enhanced in these neuronal cells. Our study provided the first evidence that APP fine tunes GPCR signaling and trafficking. Given the important role of α2AAR in controlling norepinephrine release and response, this novel regulation of α2AAR by APP may have an impact on modulation of noradrenergic activity and sympathetic tone.-Zhang, F., Gannon, M., Chen, Y., Zhou, L., Jiao, K., Wang, Q.

Neurogenesis, the formation of new neurons within the hippocampus of adult mammals, involves several complex stages including stem cell proliferation, differentiation, migration and network integration. During aging, the number of newly generated neurons continuously declines, and this is correlated with a decline in neuronal plasticity and cognitive behavior. In this study we investigated the involvement of SIRT6 in adult hippocampal neurogenesis. Mice over-expressing Sirt6 exhibit increased numbers of young neurons and decreased numbers of mature neurons, without affecting glial differentiation. This implies of an involvement of SIRT6 in neuronal differentiation and maturation within the hippocampus. This work adds to the expanding body of knowledge on the regulatory mechanisms underlying adult hippocampal neurogenesis, and describes novel roles for SIRT6 as a regulator of cell fate during adult hippocampal neurogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W2671713027,"Pathological proliferation of retinal blood vessels commonly causes vision impairment in proliferative retinopathies, including retinopathy of prematurity. Dysregulated crosstalk between the vasculature and retinal neurons is increasingly recognized as a major factor contributing to the pathogenesis of vascular diseases. Class 3 semaphorins (SEMA3s), a group of neuron-secreted axonal and vascular guidance factors, suppress pathological vascular growth in retinopathy. However, the upstream transcriptional regulators that mediate the function of SEMA3s in vascular growth are poorly understood. Here we showed that retinoic acid receptor–related orphan receptor α (RORα), a nuclear receptor and transcription factor, is a novel transcriptional regulator of SEMA3E-mediated neurovascular coupling in a mouse model of oxygen-induced proliferative retinopathy. We found that genetic deficiency of RORα substantially induced Sema3e expression in retinopathy. Both RORα and SEMA3E were expressed in retinal ganglion cells. RORα directly bound to a specific ROR response element on the promoter of Sema3e and negatively regulated Sema3e promoter–driven luciferase expression. Suppression of Sema3e using adeno-associated virus 2 carrying short hairpin RNA targeting Sema3e promoted disoriented pathological neovascularization and partially abolished the inhibitory vascular effects of RORα deficiency in retinopathy. Our findings suggest that RORα is a novel transcriptional regulator of SEMA3E-mediated neurovascular coupling in pathological retinal angiogenesis.—Sun, Y., Liu, C.-H., Wang, Z., Meng, S.

Subsequently, Mcm10 has been shown to be required for both initiation and elongation during chromosomal DNA replication. However, it is not fully understood how the multiple functions of Mcm10 are coordinated or how Mcm10 interacts with other factors at replication forks. Here, we identified and characterized the Mcm2–7-interacting domain in human Mcm10. The interaction with Mcm2–7 required the Mcm10 domain that contained amino acids 530–655, which overlapped with the domain required for the stable retention of Mcm10 on chromatin. Expression of truncated Mcm10 in HeLa cells depleted of endogenous Mcm10 via siRNA revealed that the Mcm10 conserved domain (amino acids 200–482) is essential for DNA replication, whereas both the conserved and the Mcm2–7-binding domains were required for its full activity. Mcm10 depletion reduced the initiation frequency of DNA replication and interfered with chromatin loading of replication protein A, DNA polymerase (Pol) α, and proliferating cell nuclear antigen, whereas the chromatin loading of Cdc45 and Pol ϵ was unaffected. These results suggest that human Mcm10 is bound to chromatin through the interaction with Mcm2–7 and is primarily involved in the initiation of DNA replication after loading of Cdc45 and Pol ϵ.

Eukaryotic DNA replication is tightly coupled with cell cycle progression to ensure that the entire genome is duplicated only once per cell cycle. Recent analyses using different systems have shown that the process that initiates eukaryotic DNA replication from a large number of origins is highly conserved (1.Masai H. Matsumoto S. You Z.

However, the C-terminal region is not conserved between yeast and human; the domain required for the association with Mcm2–7 has not yet been identified in higher eukaryotes. In this report, we determined the domain of human Mcm10 required for the association with Mcm2–7. This domain was important for supporting the efficient firing of replication origins and the stable chromatin association of Mcm10. Depletion of Mcm10 resulted in the inhibition of initiation and perturbed chromatin loading of RPA, Pol α, and PCNA without affecting the chromatin loading of Cdc45 and Pol ϵ, suggesting that Mcm10 is involved in origin unwinding downstream of the recruitment of Cdc45.

However, we found that Mcm10 was extracted with benzonase, a potent nuclease that degrades all forms of DNA and RNA and is active even at low temperature (<16 °C). The extraction of Mcm10 by benzonase was temperature dependent, and Mcm10 was not extracted efficiently at 30 °C although chromosomes were digested to the mononucleosomal level by an unknown mechanism (data not shown). The nuclease treatment at 30 °C may denature Mcm10 proteins and enhance the hydrophobic interactions with nuclease-resistant structures. To confirm that fractionation was performed properly, the localization of several replication factors as well as lamin B1 was investigated (Fig. 1A). As demonstrated previously, more than half of the Mcm2, Mcm6, and PCNA were free in soluble fractions, whereas the remaining proteins were bound to chromatin and extracted by benzonase treatment (56.Fujita M.

https://openalex.org/W2710342185,"OATP1B3 is a 12 transmembrane domain protein expressed at the basolateral membrane of human hepatocytes where it mediates the uptake of numerous drugs and endogenous compounds. Previous western blot results suggest the formation of OATP1B3 multimers. In order to better understand the function of OATP1B3 under normal physiological conditions, we investigated its oligomerization status. We transiently transfected OATP1B3 with a C-terminal His-, FLAG- or HA-tag in HEK293 cells and used co-immunoprecipitation and a Proximity Ligation Assay to detect interactions between the different constructs. All three constructs retained similar transport rates as wild-type OATP1B3. Immunofluorescence experiments indicated that in contrast to wild-type, His- and FLAG-tagged OATP1B3, where the C-terminal end is on the cytoplasmic side of the membrane, the C-terminal end of HA-tagged OATP1B3 is extracellular. After cross-linking, anti-FLAG antibodies were able to pull down FLAG-tagged OATP1B3 (positive control) and co-transfected His- or HA-tagged OATP1B3, demonstrating the formation of homo-oligomers and suggesting that the C-terminal part is not involved in oligomer formation. We confirmed co-localization of His- and FLAG-tagged OATP1B3 in transfected HEK293 cells with the Proximity Ligation Assay. Transport studies with a non-functional OATP1B3 mutant suggest that the individual subunits and not the whole oligomer are the functional units in the homo-oligomers. In addition, we also detected OATP1B3-FLAG co-localization with OATP1B1-His or NTCP-His, suggesting that OATP1B3 also hetero-oligomerizes with other transport proteins. Using the Proximity Ligation Assay with transporter specific antibodies, we demonstrate close association of OATP1B3 with NTCP in frozen human liver tissue. These findings demonstrate that OATP1B3 can form homo- and hetero-oligomers and suggest a potential co-regulation of the involved transporters."

This study aimed to explore whether tumor location could be identified as another high-risk factor in stage II colorectal cancer by using data identified from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results database. All colorectal cancer patients between 2004 and 2008 were grouped into three according to tumor location. Of 33,789 patients diagnosed with stage II colorectal cancer, 46.8% were right colon cancer, 37.5% were left colon cancer and 15.7% were rectal cancer. The 5-year cancer specific survivals were examined. Right colon cancer was associated with the female sex, older age (> 50), and having over 12 lymph nodes resected. Conversely, rectal cancer was associated with the male sex, patients younger than 50 years of age and insufficient lymph node resection. The characteristics of left colon cancer were between them and associated with Asian or Pacific Islander populations, T4 stage, and Grade II patients. The prognostic differences between three groups were significant and retained after stratification by T stage, histological grade, number of regional nodes dissected, age at diagnose, race and sex. Furthermore, the significant difference of location was retained as an independent high-risk parameter. Thus, stage II colorectal cancers of different locations have different clinic-pathological features and cancer-specific survivals, and tumor location should be recognized as another high-risk parameter in stage II colorectal cancer."

The study of sea snakes collected beyond their typical distribution range provides valuable insight on how climate change affects marine reptile populations. Recently, we collected 12 Laticauda semifasciata (11 females, 1 male) from the waters around southern South Korea—an area located outside its typical distribution range (Japan, China including Taiwan, Philippines and Indonesia). We investigated the genetic origin of Korean specimens by analyzing mitochondrial cytochrome b gene (Cytb) sequences. Six individuals shared haplotypes with a group found in Taiwan-southern Ryukyu Islands, while the remaining six individuals shared haplotypes with a group encompassing the entire Ryukyu Archipelago. These results suggest L. semifasciata moved into Korean waters from the Taiwan-Ryukyu region via the Taiwan Warm Current and/or the Kuroshio Current, with extended survival facilitated by ocean warming. We highlight several contributing factors that increase the chances that L. semifasciata establishes new northern populations beyond the original distribution range."

Since thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) exerts an inductor effect on cholesterol biosynthesis, we aimed to investigate the relationship between TSH mRNA and cholesterol metabolism in human adipose tissue (AT). Cross-sectionally, AT TSH-β (TSHB) mRNA was evaluated in 4 independent cohorts in association with serum total and LDL cholesterol, and AT lipidomics. Longitudinally, the effects of statins and of diet and exercise on AT TSHB mRNA were also examined. The bidirectional relationship between cholesterol and TSHB were studied in isolated human adipocytes. TSHB mRNA was consistently detected in AT from euthyroid subjects, and positively associated with serum total- and LDL-cholesterol, and with AT-specific cholesterol metabolism-associated lipids [arachidonoyl cholesteryl ester, C8-dihydroceramide, N-stearoyl-d-sphingosine, and GlcCer(18:0, 24:1)]. Reduction of cholesterol with statins and with diet and exercise interventions led to decreased TSHB mRNA in human AT, whereas excess cholesterol up-regulated TSHB mRNA in human adipocytes. In addition, recombinant human TSH α/β administration resulted in increased HMGCR mRNA levels in human adipocytes. In mice, subcutaneous AT Tshb expression levels correlated directly with circulating cholesterol levels. In summary, current results provide novel evidence of TSHB as a paracrine factor that is modulated in parallel with cholesterol metabolism in human AT.-Moreno-Navarrete, J.

Thirty animals (227.7 ± 23.8 kg body weight; 18 months old) were housed in individual pens and fed 5 experimental diets, containing 0, 7.5, 15, 22.5 or 30% crude glycerin (DM basis). After 103 d (21 d adaptation) animals were slaughtered and the Longissimus muscle was collected. The characteristics assessed were chemical composition, fatty acid profile, cholesterol, shear force, pH, color, water-holding capacity, cooking loss and sensory properties. The increasing inclusion of crude glycerin in the diets did not affect the chemical composition of the Longissimus muscle (P > 0.10). A quadratic effect was observed when levels of crude glycerin were increased, on the concentration of pentadecanoic, palmitoleic and eicosenoic fatty acids in meat (P < 0.05), and on the activity of the delta-9 desaturase 16 and delta-9 desaturase 18 enzymes (P < 0.05). The addition of crude glycerin increased the gamma linolenic fatty acid concentration (P < 0.01), and altered the monounsaturated fatty acids in Longissimus muscle of animals (Pquad. < 0.05). Crude glycerin decreased cholesterol content in meat (P < 0.05), and promoted higher flavor score and greasy intensity perception of the meat (P < 0.01). The inclusion of up to 30% crude glycerin in Nellore cattle bulls`diets (DM basis) improves meat cholesterol and sensory attributes, such as flavor, without affecting significantly the physical traits, the main fatty acid concentrations and the chemical composition."
https://openalex.org/W2718244370,"Epidemiological studies have indicated that smoking is a pivotal risk factor for the progression of several chronic diseases. Nicotine, the addictive component of cigarettes, has powerful pathophysiological properties in the body. Although the effects of cigarette smoking on corneal re-epithelialization have been studied, the effects of nicotine on corneal wound healing-related neovascularization and fibrosis have not been fully demonstrated. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of chronic administration of nicotine on corneal wound healing following acute insult induced by an alkali burn. BALB/C female mice randomly received either vehicle (2% saccharin) or nicotine (100 or 200 μg/ml in 2% saccharin) in drinking water ad libitum. After 1 week, animals were re-randomized and the experimental group was subjected to a corneal alkali burn, and then nicotine was administered until day 14 after the alkali burn. A corneal alkali burn model was generated by placing a piece of 2 mm-diameter filter paper soaked in 1N NaOH on the right eye. Histopathological analysis and the expression level of the pro-angiogenic genes vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP9) revealed that chronic nicotine administration enhanced alkali burn-induced corneal neovascularization. Furthermore, the mRNA expression of the pro-fibrogenic factors α-smooth muscle actin (αSMA), transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β), and collagen α1 (Col1) was enhanced in the high-concentration nicotine-treated group compared with the vehicle group after corneal injury. Immunohistochemical analysis also showed that the αSMA-positive area was increased in chronic nicotine-treated mice after corneal alkali burn. An in vitro assay found that expression of the α3, α7, and β1 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR) subunits was significantly increased by chemical injury in human corneal fibroblast cells. Moreover, alkali-induced fibrogenic gene expression and proliferation of fibroblast cells were further increased by treatment with nicotine and cotinine. The proliferation of such cells induced by treatment of nicotine and cotinine was reduced by inhibition of the PI3K and PKC pathways using specific inhibitors. In conclusion, chronic administration of nicotine accelerated the angiogenic and fibrogenic healing processes in alkali-burned corneal tissue."

Its enantiomer R-Modafinil (R-MO) is not well studied in regard to cognitive enhancing properties. Hence we studied its effect in a spatial memory paradigm and its possible effects on dentate gyrus long-term potentiation (DG-LTP). Clinically relevant doses of R-MO, vehicle dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) or saline were administered for three days during the hole-board test and in in vivo DG-LTP. Synaptic levels of dopamine receptors D1R, D2R, dopamine transporter (DAT), and its phosphorylated form (ph-DAT) in DG tissue 4 h after LTP induction were quantified by western blot analysis. Monoamine reuptake and release assays were performed by using transfected HEK-293 cells. Possible neurotoxic side effects on general behaviour were also studied. R-MO at both doses significantly enhanced spatial reference memory during the last training session and during memory retrieval compared to DMSO vehicle but not when compared to saline treated rats. Similarly, R-MO rescues DG-LTP from impairing effects of DMSO. DMSO reduced memory performance and LTP magnitude when compared to saline treated groups. The synaptic DR1 levels in R-MO groups were significantly decreased compared to DMSO group but were comparable with saline treated animals. We found no effect of R-MO in neurotoxicity tests. Thus, our results support the notion that LTP-like synaptic plasticity processes could be one of the factors contributing to the cognitive enhancing effects of spatial memory traces. D1R may play an important regulatory role in these processes."
https://openalex.org/W2639376295,"Background 
Transient receptor potential (TRP) ion channels have emerged as key components contributing to vasoreactivity. Propofol, an anesthetic is associated with adverse side effects including hypotension and acute pain upon infusion. Our objective was to determine the extent to which TRPA1 and/or TRPV1 ion channels are involved in mediating propofol-induced vasorelaxation of mouse coronary arterioles in vitro and elucidate the potential cellular signal transduction pathway by which this occurs.


Methods 
Hearts were excised from anesthetized mice and coronary arterioles were dissected from control C57Bl/6J, TRPA1-/-, TRPV1-/- and double-knockout mice (TRPAV-/-). Isolated microvessels were cannulated and secured in a temperature-controlled chamber and allowed to equilibrate for 1 hr. Vasoreactivity studies were performed in microvessels pre-constricted with U46619 to assess the dose-dependent relaxation effects of propofol on coronary microvascular tone.


Results 
Propofol-induced relaxation was unaffected in vessels obtained from TRPV1-/- mice, markedly attenuated in pre-constricted vessels obtained from TRPA1-/- mice and abolished in vessels obtained from TRPAV-/- mice. Furthermore, NOS inhibition with L-NAME or endothelium denuding abolished the proporfol-induced depressor response in pre-constricted vessels obtained from all mice. In the absence of L-NAME, BKCa inhibition with penitrem A markedly attenuated propofol-mediated relaxation in vessels obtained from wild-type mice and to a lesser extent in vessels obtained from TRPV1-/-, mice with no effect in vessels obtained from TRPA1-/- or TRPAV-/- mice.


Conclusions 
TRPA1 and TRPV1 appear to contribute to the propofol-mediated antagonism of U46619-induced constriction in murine coronary microvessels that involves activation of NOS and BKCa."
https://openalex.org/W2690651302,"Coxsackievirus B3 (CVB3) is known to induce acute and chronic myocarditis. Most infections are clinically unapparent but some patients suffer from ventricular arrhythmias (VA) and sudden cardiac death (SCD). Studies showed that acute CVB3 infection may cause impaired function of cardiac ion channels, creating a proarrhythmic substrate. However, it is unknown whether low level CVB3+ expression in myocytes may cause altered cardiac electrophysiology leading to VA.Cellular electrophysiology was used to analyze cellular action potentials (APs) and occurrence of afterdepolarizations from isolated cardiomyocytes of wildtype (WT) and transgenic CVB3ΔVP0 (CVB3+) mice. Further, we studied surface ECGs, monophasic APs, ventricular effective refractory period (VERP) and inducibility of VAs in Langendorff-perfused whole hearts. All used cardiomyocytes and whole hearts originated from male mice.Cellular action potential duration (APD) in WT and CVB3+ myocytes was unchanged. No difference in mean occurrence or amplitude of afterdepolarizations in WT and CVB3+ myocytes was found. Interestingly, resting membrane potential in CVB3+ myocytes was significantly hyperpolarized (WT: -90.0±2.2 mV, n = 7; CVB3+: -114.1±3.0 mV, n = 14; p<0.005). Consistently, in Langendorff-perfused hearts, APDs were also not different between WT and CVB3+ whole hearts. Within both groups, we found a heart rate dependent shortening of ADP90 with increasing heart rate in Langendorff-perfused hearts. VERP was significantly prolonged in CVB3+ hearts compared to WT (WT: 36.0±2.7 ms, n = 5; CVB3+: 47.0±2.0 ms, n = 7; p = 0.018). Resting heart rate (HR) in Langendorff-perfused hearts was not significantly different between both genotypes. Electrical pacing protocols induced no VA in WT and CVB3+ hearts.In CVB3+ mice, prolonged ventricular refractoriness and hyperpolarized resting membrane potentials in presence of unchanged APD were observed, suggesting that low level CVB3 expression does not promote VA by altered cardiac electrophysiology in this type of chronic myocarditis. These findings may suggest that other mechanisms such as chronic myocardial inflammation or fibrosis may account for arrhythmias observed in patients with chronic enteroviral myocarditis."

Thus, muscle atrophic phenotypes, intracellular signaling pathways, and intracellular free amino acid profiles were investigated in human skeletal muscle α-actin (HSA) promoter-driven Fv2E-PERK transgenic (Tg) mice.HSA-Fv2E-PERK Tg mice treated with the artificial dimerizer AP20187 phosphorylates eIF2α in skeletal muscles and leads to severe muscle atrophy within a few days of ligand injection. Muscle atrophy was accompanied by a counter regulatory activation of mTORC1 signaling. Moreover, intracellular free amino acid levels were distinctively altered in the skeletal muscles of HSA-Fv2E-PERK Tg mice.As a novel model of muscle wasting, HSA-Fv2E-PERK Tg mice provide a convenient tool for studying the pathogenesis of muscle loss and for assessing putative therapeutics."

We used responses to the survey, which presented binary discrete-choice situations, to construct a database necessary for a logistic regression model that allowed us to examine how passenger profile, trip characteristics, and stay conditions influenced the use of HSR services on visits to each coastal destination. Results highlighted significant differences in the profiles of tourists who arrived at each destination by HSR and, in turn, that no specific tourist profile is associated with HSR, even for two stations that serve sunny beach destinations. Among its implications, to analyse travellers that HSR can attract, it is vital to consider the specific characteristics of each destination and its current market."
https://openalex.org/W2663036861,"It is well known that aluminium is the principle toxicant killing fish in acidified freshwater systems, and it has been shown that crucian carp (Carassius carassius) can survive exposures to aqueous aluminium levels toxic to most other freshwater fish species. The crucian carp has a remarkable ability to survive anoxic conditions, and the aim of the present study was to reveal if the tolerance to aluminium can be associated with the ability to survive prolonged anoxia. Crucian carps were exposed to either acidic Al-rich water (pH 5.8; 960 μg Al/l), acidic Al-poor water (pH 5.8; 50 μg Al/l) or untreated control water (pH 6.5; 50 μg Al/l). Blood, muscle and gill samples were collected from exposed fish, and closed respirometry was performed to measure critical O2-tension an normoxic O2-consumption. The results show an increased gill surface area in Al-exposed fish, while the critical O2-tension did not change. The normoxic O2-consumption was lower in Al-exposed fish and might be due to a reduced metabolic rate. The results suggest that crucian carp exposed to aluminium do not become hypoxic, since haematocrit, plasma lactate and blood ethanol did not differ from that of control fish after 14 days of exposure. We also observed an initial loss of plasma chloride and sodium, followed by a stabilisation of these ions at a lower level than in control fish. The decrease in plasma ions caused a transient increase in haematocrit and water content in muscle tissue, returning to control levels when the ion concentrations stabilised, suggesting that the water balance was restored. We conclude that the high tolerance to aluminium in crucian carp is associated with its ability to avoid hypoxia as well as an ability to counteract a continuous loss of plasma ions."

https://openalex.org/W2683737661,"PGC1α is a coactivator of many transcription factors and cytosolic phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PCK1) is a key enzyme for gluconeogenesis. PGC1α interacts with the transcription factor PPARγ to stimulate PCK1 expression and thus de novo glucose synthesis. These proteins are not only important for central energy metabolism but also for supplying intermediates for other metabolic pathways, including lipidogenesis and protein synthesis and might therefore be important factors in the ethiopathogenesis of metabolic disorders like diabetes but also in other pathologies like cancer. Since polymorphisms in these proteins have been related to some phenotypic traits in animals like pigs and PGC1α G482S polymorphism increases fat deposition in humans, we have investigated the molecular basis of such effects focusing on a commonly studied polymorphism in pig Pgc1α, which changes a cysteine at position 430 (WT) of the protein to a serine (C430S). Biochemical analyses show that Pgc1α WT stimulates higher expression of human PCK1 in HEK293T and HepG2 cells. Paradoxically, Pgc1α WT is less stable than Pgc1α p.C430S in HEK293T cells. However, the study of different post-translational modifications shows a higher O-GlcNAcylation level of Pgc1α p.C430S. This higher O-GlcNAcylation level significantly decreases the interaction between Pgc1α and PPARγ demonstrating the importance of post-translational glycosylation of PGC1α in the regulation of PCK1 activity. This, furthermore, could explain at least in part the observed epistatic effects between PGC1α and PCK1 in pigs."

This study aimed to estimate the optimal dosing frequency and the required dose for achieving 80% occupancy of the serotonin transporters in the basal ganglia. The dosing frequency was investigated by determining the elimination half-life after a four day oral pre-treatment period with 0.83 mg/kg escitalopram (3 administrations/day) and a subsequent i.v. injection 0.83 mg/kg. Blood samples were taken up to 12 hours after i.v. injection and the concentration of escitalopram in plasma was analysed via LC-MSMS. The dose-occupancy relationship was then determined by performing two PET scans in five adult beagles: a baseline PET scan and a second scan after steady state conditions were achieved following oral treatment with a specific dose of escitalopram ranging from 0.5 to 2.5 mg/kg/day. As the elimination half-life was determined to be 6.7 hours a dosing frequency of three administrations a day was proposed for the second part of the study. Further it was opted for a treatment period of four days, which well exceeded the minimum period to achieve steady state conditions. The optimal dosing regimen to achieve 80% occupancy in the basal ganglia and elicit a therapeutic effect, was calculated to be 1.85 mg/kg/day, divided over three administrations. Under several circumstances, such as insufficient response to other SSRIs, concurrent drug intake or in research studies focused on SERT, the use of escitalopram can be preferred over the use of the already for veterinary use registered fluoxetine, however, in case of long-term treatment with escitalopram, regularly cardiac screening is recommended."
https://openalex.org/W2679418218,"Purpose To assess biomechanical factors in aortic arch geometry contributing to the development of non-penetrating aortic arch injury (NAAI) in multiply injured patients with an Injury Severity Score (ISS) ≥ 16. Material and methods 230 consecutive multiply injured trauma patients with an ISS ≥ 16 admitted to our Level-I trauma center during a consecutive 24-month period were prospectively included of whom 13 presented with NAAI (5.7%). Standardized whole-body CT in a 2x128-detector-row scanner included a head-and-neck CTA. Aortic arch diameters, width, height, angles and thoracic width and height were measured in individuals with NAAI and ISS-, sex-, age-, and trauma mechanism-matched controls. Results There was no difference between groups regarding sex, age, ISS, and aortic diameters. The aortic arch angle in individuals with NAAI (71.3° ± 14.9°) was larger than in healthy control (60.7° ± 8.6°; p*<0.05). In patients with NAAI, the distance between ascendent and descendent aorta was larger (5.2 cm ± 1.9 cm) than in control (2.8 ± 0.5 cm; ***p<0.001). The aortic arch is higher above tracheal bifurcation in NAAI (3.6 cm ± 0.6 cm) than in matched control (2.4 cm ± 0.3 cm; ***p<0.001). Accordingly, the area under the aortic arch, calculated as half of an eliptic shape, is significantly larger in patients with NAAI (15.0 cm2 ± 6.5 cm2) when compared to age- and sex-matched controls without NAAI (5.5 cm2 ± 1.3 cm2; ***p<0.001). Conclusion Besides the magnitude of deceleration and direction of impact, width and height of the aortic arch are the 3rd and 4th factor directly contributing to the risk of developing traumatic NAAI in severely injured patients."
https://openalex.org/W2705339389,"Predicting extrema of chaotic systems in high-dimensional phase space remains a challenge. Methods, which give extrema that are valid in the long term, have thus far been restricted to models of only a few variables. Here, a method is presented which treats extrema of chaotic systems as belonging to discretised manifolds of low dimension (low-D) embedded in high-dimensional (high-D) phase space. As a central feature, the method exploits that strange attractor dimension is generally much smaller than parent system phase space dimension. This is important, since the computational cost associated with discretised manifolds depends exponentially on their dimension. Thus, systems that would otherwise be associated with tremendous computational challenges, can be tackled on a laptop. As a test, bounding manifolds are calculated for high-D modifications of the canonical Duffing system. Parameters can be set such that the bounding manifold displays harmonic behaviour even if the underlying system is chaotic. Thus, solving for one post-transient forcing cycle of the bounding manifold predicts the extrema of the underlying chaotic problem indefinitely."
https://openalex.org/W2706551746,"Proposed distributed reactivity model of dehydration for seedling parts of two various maize hybrids (ZP434, ZP704) was established. Dehydration stresses were induced thermally, which is also accompanied by response of hybrids to heat stress. It was found that an increased value of activation energy counterparts within radicle dehydration of ZP434, with a high concentration of 24-epibrassinolide (24-EBL) at elevated operating temperatures, probably causes activation of diffusion mechanisms in cutin network and may increases likelihood of formation of free volumes, large enough to accommodate diffusing molecule. Many small random effects were detected and can be correlated with micro-disturbing in a space filled with water caused by thermal gradients, increasing capillary phenomena, and which can induce thermo-capillary migration. The influence of seedling content of various sugars and minerals on dehydration was also examined. Estimated distributed reactivity models indicate a dependence of reactivity on structural arrangements, due to present interactions between water molecules and chemical species within the plant."
https://openalex.org/W2717992360,"This work proposes a new approach to determine the spatial location and orientation of an object using measurements performed on the object itself. The on-board triangulation algorithm we outline could be implemented in lieu of, or in addition to, well-known alternatives such as Global Positioning System (GPS) or standard triangulation, since both of these correspond to significantly different geometric pictures and necessitate different hardware and algorithms. We motivate the theory by describing situations in which on-board triangulation would be useful and even preferable to standard methods. The on-board triangulation algorithm we outline involves utilizing dumb beacons which broadcast omnidirectional single frequency radio waves, and smart antenna arrays on the object itself to infer the direction of the beacon signals, which may be used for onboard calculation of the position and orientation of the object. Numerical examples demonstrate the utility of the method and its noise tolerance."
https://openalex.org/W2643436244,"Bacteria in a biofilm colony have the capacity to monitor the size and growth conditions for the colony and modify their phenotypical behaviour to optimise attacks, defence, migration, etc. The quorum sensing systems controlling this involve production and sensing of diffusive signal molecules. Frequently, quorum sensing systems carry a positive feedback loop which produces a switch at a threshold size of the colony. This all-or-none switch can be beneficial to create a sudden attack, leaving a host little time to establish a defence. The reaction-diffusion system describing a basal quorum sensing loop involves production of signal molecules, diffusion of signal molecules, and detection of signal molecules. We study the ignition process in a numerical solution for a basal quorum sensor and demonstrate that even in a large colony the ignition travels through the whole colony in a less than a minute. The ignition of the positive feedback loop was examined in different approximations. As expected, in the exact calculation the ignition was found to be delayed compared to a calculation where the binding of signal molecules was quasistatic. The buffering of signal molecules is found to have little effect on the ignition process. Contrary to expectation, we find that the ignition does not start when the threshold is reached at the center-instead it allows for the threshold to be approached in the whole colony followed by an almost simultaneous ignition of the whole biofilm aggregate."
