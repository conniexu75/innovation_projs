However, poor mechanical stability has hampered progress in moving toward commercialization. Xu et al. designed a mechanical metamaterial that pinches in a small amount when you compress it (see the Perspective by Chhowalla and Jariwala). This is characteristic of materials with a negative Poisson's ratio and dramatically improves mechanical stability. The trick was using three-dimensional graphene structures to template the ceramic aerogels, thus producing a superinsulating material endowed with excellent mechanical properties.

However, isolation of colibactin is difficult, and its mode of action is poorly understood. Wilson et al. studied Escherichia coli that contain the biosynthetic gene island called pks , which is associated with colibactin production (see the Perspective by Bleich and Arthur). They identified the DNA adducts that resulted from incubating pks + E. coli in human cells. To overcome the lack of colibactin for direct analysis, mimics of the pks product were synthesized. From the resulting synthetic adenine-colibactin adducts, it became evident that alkylation via a cyclopropane “warhead” breaks the DNA strands. Similar DNA adducts were then identified in the gut epithelia of mice infected with pks + E. coli. Science , this issue p. eaar7785 ; see also p. 689"

Alam et al. determined high-resolution cryo–electron microscopy structures of ABCB1 bound either to a substrate, the cancer drug Taxol, or to the ABCB1 inhibitor zosuquidar. The conformational changes that facilitate drug transport are caused by hydrolysis of adenosine triphosphate (ATP). The structures show that, although Taxol and zosquidar bind to the same site, subtle structural differences lead to altered conformations of the nucleotide binding domains that are responsible for ATP hydrolysis.

Many current reversible manipulation techniques have limitations preventing their application, particularly in deep areas of the primate brain. Here, we demonstrate that a focused transcranial ultrasound stimulation (TUS) protocol impacts activity even in deep brain areas: a subcortical brain structure, the amygdala (experiment 1), and a deep cortical region, the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC, experiment 2), in macaques. TUS neuromodulatory effects were measured by examining relationships between activity in each area and the rest of the brain using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). In control conditions without sonication, activity in a given area is related to activity in interconnected regions, but such relationships are reduced after sonication, specifically for the targeted areas. Dissociable and focal effects on neural activity could not be explained by auditory confounds."

This expansion leads to the abnormal production of proteins of repeating dipeptides, but their contribution to disease pathogenesis remains unclear. Zhang et al. engineered a mouse model to study the consequences of one of these dipeptides—prolinearginine dipeptide repeat protein, poly(PR)—in the brain. They found that poly(PR) caused neuron loss as well as motor and memory impairments. These detrimental effects resulted from poly(PR)-induced perturbation of heterochromatin function, a tightly packed form of DNA that represses gene expression. Science , this issue p. eaav2606"
https://openalex.org/W2913126315,"Methylation of histone H3 K79 by Dot1L is a hallmark of actively transcribed genes that depends on monoubiquitination of H2B K120 (H2B-Ub) and is an example of histone modification cross-talk that is conserved from yeast to humans. We report here cryo-EM structures of Dot1L bound to ubiquitinated nucleosome that show how H2B-Ub stimulates Dot1L activity and reveal a role for the histone H4 tail in positioning Dot1L. We find that contacts mediated by Dot1L and the H4 tail induce a conformational change in the globular core of histone H3 that reorients K79 from an inaccessible position, thus enabling this side chain to insert into the active site in a position primed for catalysis. Our study provides a comprehensive mechanism of cross-talk between histone ubiquitination and methylation and reveals structural plasticity in histones that makes it possible for histone-modifying enzymes to access residues within the nucleosome core."

We investigated the genetic basis of resistance by comparing the exomes of rabbits collected before and after the pandemic. We found a strong pattern of parallel evolution, with selection on standing genetic variation favoring the same alleles in Australia, France, and the United Kingdom. Many of these changes occurred in immunity-related genes, supporting a polygenic basis of resistance. We experimentally validated the role of several genes in viral replication and showed that selection acting on an interferon protein has increased the protein's antiviral effect."

B2 cells generate specific antibodies against foreign antigens in secondary lymphoid organs. B1 cells, found predominantly in the peritoneal and pleural cavities, instead produce “natural” antibodies as part of the innate immune system. Two models to explain this split exist: the “lineage model,” wherein both subsets have distinct progenitors, and the “selection model,” in which fates are directed by different B cell antigen receptors (BCRs). Graf et al. provide support for the selection model using a transgenic system in which BCR specificities can be changed.

https://openalex.org/W2914174769,"•Punishments and punishment-predictive cues excite LHb neurons•Avoidance learning strengthens hypothalamus-to-LHb excitation•Hypothalamic inputs and AMPAR potentiation underlie avoidance Throughout life, individuals learn to predict a punishment via its association with sensory stimuli. This process ultimately prompts goal-directed actions to prevent the danger, a behavior defined as avoidance. Neurons in the lateral habenula (LHb) respond to aversive events as well as to environmental cues predicting them, supporting LHb contribution to cue-punishment association. However, whether synaptic adaptations at discrete habenular circuits underlie such associative learning to instruct avoidance remains elusive. Here, we find that, in mice, contingent association of an auditory cue (tone) with a punishment (foot shock) progressively causes cue-driven LHb neuronal excitation during avoidance learning. This process is concomitant with the strengthening of LHb AMPA receptor-mediated neurotransmission. Such a phenomenon occludes long-term potentiation and occurs specifically at hypothalamus-to-habenula synapses. Silencing hypothalamic-to-habenulainputs or optically inactivating postsynaptic AMPA receptors within the LHb disrupts avoidance learning. Altogether, synaptic strengthening at a discrete habenular circuit transforms neutral stimuli into salient punishment-predictive cues to guide avoidance.

Altogether, synaptic strengthening at a discrete habenular circuit transforms neutral stimuli into salient punishment-predictive cues to guide avoidance. The sound of a fire alarm guides a rapid action to immediately ensure safety. This is an instance where associating environmental cues to aversive events grants individuals to predict and avoid threats, a primary strategy for survival. Neurons in the lateral habenula (LHb) are instrumental in processing aversive events and guide innate escape behaviors. Unexpected punishments or disappointment phasically excite LHb neurons (Lecca et al., 2017Lecca S. Meye F.J. Trusel M. Tchenio A. Harris J. Schwarz M.K. Burdakov D. Georges F. Mameli M.

Guo Q. Zhou J. Luo M. Learning shapes the aversion and reward responses of lateral habenula neurons.eLife. 2017; 6: e23045Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Importantly, after conditioning, punishment-predictive external cues are also efficient in driving LHb neuronal excitation (Matsumoto and Hikosaka, 2007Matsumoto M. Hikosaka O. Lateral habenula as a source of negative reward signals in dopamine neurons.Nature. 2007; 447: 1111-1115Crossref PubMed Scopus (887) Google Scholar). This suggests that the LHb may support cue-punishment learning. Such process is instrumental for adaptive behavioral strategies, including avoidance, a cardinal mechanism allowing individuals to prevent the predicted punishment (LeDoux et al., 2017LeDoux J.E. Moscarello J. Sears R. Campese V. The birth, death and resurrection of avoidance: a reconceptualization of a troubled paradigm.Mol. Psychiatry. 2017; 22: 24-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). Glutamatergic inputs from brain structures, including the lateral hypothalamus (LH), the medial ventral tegmental area (mVTA), and the entopeduncular nucleus of the basal ganglia (EPN) increase LHb neuronal activity and guide aversive behaviors (Root et al., 2014Root D.H. Mejias-Aponte C.A. Qi J. Morales M. Role of glutamatergic projections from ventral tegmental area to lateral habenula in aversive conditioning.J.

Importantly, such excitatory synapses can undergo activity-dependent synaptic plasticity (Valentinova and Mameli, 2016Valentinova K.

Moreover, in pathological conditions, pre- and postsynaptic modifications of glutamatergic neurotransmission alter LHb neuronal output and ultimately underlie depressive-like states (Lecca et al., 2016Lecca S.

Cocaine-evoked negative symptoms require AMPA receptor trafficking in the lateral habenula.Nat. Neurosci. 2015; 18: 376-378Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Altogether, this evidence supports the notion that synaptic plasticity at discrete inputs onto LHb synapses tunes LHb neurons firing and is causal for specific behavioral outcomes. Long-term potentiation (LTP) of excitatory transmission is crucial for learning processes and enables neuronal networks to represent a memory (Nabavi et al., 2014Nabavi S. Fox R. Proulx C.D. Lin J.Y. Tsien R.Y. Malinow R. Engineering a memory with LTD and LTP.Nature. 2014; 511: 348-352Crossref PubMed Scopus (625) Google Scholar). Yet, whether synaptic adaptations within habenular circuits represent a cellular substrate for associative learning occurring during avoidance remains poorly understood. Here, we examined whether cue-punishment associations and the subsequent cue-driven avoidance (1) engage LHb neuronal dynamics and (2) require pathway-specific synaptic plasticity. Aversive events or their predictors lead to a time-locked phasic excitation of LHb neurons (Matsumoto and Hikosaka, 2007Matsumoto M. Hikosaka O. Lateral habenula as a source of negative reward signals in dopamine neurons.Nature. 2007; 447: 1111-1115Crossref PubMed Scopus (887) Google Scholar). Here, we examined the progression of LHb neuronal dynamics throughout cue-punishment association and avoidance learning. To model cue-punishment associative learning and subsequent cue-guided avoidance, we employed a two-way active avoidance task (LeDoux et al., 2017LeDoux J.E. Moscarello J. Sears R. Campese V. The birth, death and resurrection of avoidance: a reconceptualization of a troubled paradigm.Mol. Psychiatry. 2017; 22: 24-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). During 5 sessions (1 session/day; 30 trials/session), mice experienced a tone (conditioned stimulus [CS], 10 s) followed by a foot shock (unconditioned stimulus [US]). Foot-shock delivery would stop if mice crossed compartments (shuttles; Figure S1A). We examined avoidance learning by computing goal-directed shuttles during the CS. Mice progressively improve their shuttling performance, thereby preventing shock occurrence (learner group [L]; Figure 1A). In contrast, control mice received similar amount of foot shocks and tones (compared to L-mice), but CS and US were never contingent (control group, [C]; Figure 1A). To examine LHb neurons’ activity during avoidance learning, we employed photometric analysis of calcium-mediated fluorescent transients—used as a proxy for neuronal activity (Lecca et al., 2017Lecca S. Meye F.J. Trusel M. Tchenio A. Harris J. Schwarz M.K. Burdakov D. Georges F. Mameli M. Aversive stimuli drive hypothalamus-to-habenula excitation to promote escape behavior.eLife. 2017; 6: e30697Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). We virally expressed the fluorescent Ca2+ sensor GCaMP6f unilaterally in the LHb and implanted a multimodal fiber optic above the injection site to collect the emitted photons (Figures 1B and S1B). Post hoc analysis indicated that ∼69% (2,596/3,729 neurons; 4 mice) of the LHb neuronal population expressed GCaMP6f and was glutamatergic (i.e., EAAC1+; Figures S1C and S1D). During the first training session, calcium fluorescent transients were time locked to foot-shock delivery, with minimal transients evoked during CS presentation (Figures 1A and 1B). During subsequent training days, while cue-punishment association and cue-driven shuttles progressed, fluorescent transients were typically observed in response to both foot shock and CS onset (day 3; Figures 1B, 1C, and S1E). The CS-driven phasic fluorescent responses, measured at the peak, gradually developed over the sessions to become, at day 5, significantly larger than day 1 (Figure 1C). CS-driven fluorescent transients were learning driven and GCamp6f mediated, as they were absent across the five sessions in control mice and GFP-only-expressing learner animals (Figures S1E and S1F). In contrast, the amplitude of US-driven transients remained comparable across training sessions, supporting the stability over time of the photometric signal (Figures S1E and S1G–S1I). Consistently, the ratio CSphotons/USphotons at each session from individual learner mice correlated with the number of shuttle events during the CS (Figure 1D). Finally, single-unit recordings in awake mice corroborated that CS-driven LHb neurons excitation occurs in learner, but not control, mice (Figure S1J). Altogether, these data indicate that the transition from neutral to punishment-valued cues during avoidance learning associates with cue-evoked LHb neuronal excitation. Potentiation of excitatory synapses represents a neurobiological substrate underlying the association between cues and salient experiences. Accordingly, LTP may support the emergence of cue-valued excitation of midbrain dopamine neurons during reward-prediction learning (Stuber et al., 2008Stuber G.D. Klanker M. de Ridder B. Bowers M.S. Joosten R.N. Feenstra M.G. Bonci A. Reward-predictive cues enhance excitatory synaptic strength onto midbrain dopamine neurons.Science. 2008; 321: 1690-1692Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). We therefore tested the prediction that synaptic strengthening of excitatory transmission onto LHb neurons represents a core mechanism for cue-driven avoidance learning. To examine excitatory synaptic transmission onto LHb neurons along the progression of avoidance learning, we performed ex vivo patch-clamp experiments in LHb-containing acute slices from control and learner mice. Evoked excitatory postsynaptic currents (EPSCs) were recorded at different timings during the training—∼1 h after session one (I) and 24 h after sessions one (II), two (III), three (IV), and four (V; Figure 2A). Bath application of the NMDAR antagonist D-2-amino-5-phosphonopentanoate (AP5) and digital subtraction allowed the isolation of synaptically evoked AMPA- and NMDA-mediated currents (+40 mV; Figure 2A). This permitted computing the NMDAR ratio, a validated proxy for postsynaptic strengthening of excitatory transmission (Meye et al., 2015Meye F.J. Valentinova K. Lecca S. Marion-Poll L. Maroteaux M.J. Musardo S. Moutkine I. Gardoni F. Huganir R.L. Georges F. Mameli M. Cocaine-evoked negative symptoms require AMPA receptor trafficking in the lateral habenula.Nat. Neurosci. 2015; 18: 376-378Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). The AMPAR/NMDAR ratio significantly, but transiently, augmented in learner mice compared to control mice (Figure 2A). Namely, it was larger 24 h after training session two (III) and positively correlated with avoidance performance (Figures 2A and 2B). However, AMPAR/NMDAR ratios were lower and comparable between experimental groups 24 h after sessions three and four, as well as after session one, indicating the transient nature of this plasticity (Figure 2A). The increased AMPAR/NMDAR ratio detected 24 h after session two can occur via enhanced AMPAR function and/or number or alternatively via reduction of NMDAR function and/or number (Mameli et al., 2011Mameli M. Bellone C. Brown M.T. Lüscher C. Cocaine inverts rules for synaptic plasticity of glutamate transmission in the ventral tegmental area.Nat. Neurosci. 2011; 14: 414-416Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). To probe the contribution of each glutamate receptor type during avoidance learning, we used uncaging of MNI-glutamate onto LHb dendrites. At +40 mV, a brief (1.5 ms) flash of 405-nm UV light evoked a composite response (AMPAR and NMDAR mediated). Isolation of AMPARs and NMDARs currents unraveled higher AMPAR/NMDAR ratios in learner mice, similarly to the results obtained with extracellular stimulation (Figure 2C). Comparison of AMPAR and NMDAR absolute currents revealed a significant upward shift of AMPAR-EPSCs amplitudes, while NMDAR responses remained comparable across experimental groups (Figure S2A). Avoidance learning (at session III) did not alter EPSCs evoked by high-frequency trains of synaptic stimulation, indicating unaltered presynaptic glutamate release (Figure S2B). Altogether, these data suggest that cue-punishment association, and the consequent development of avoidance, occurs along with a postsynaptic potentiation of AMPAR-dependent transmission onto LHb neurons. We reasoned that, if learning requires such an LTP-like process, animals undergoing avoidance learning would show occluded LTP in vitro. Pairing high-frequency extracellular stimulation with postsynaptic depolarization (1 s at 20 mV) led to LTP in slices from control (and naive) mice (Figures 2D and S2C). This phenomenon required NMDARs, as it was abolished by the presence of the NMDAR antagonist AP5 (Figure S2C). The pairing protocol failed, however, to induce LTP in slices obtained from mice undergoing avoidance learning (III; Figure 2D). Altogether, cue-punishment association and avoidance occur along with transient LTP of postsynaptic AMPAR transmission. The lateral hypothalamus (LH), the medial VTA (mVTA), and the entopeduncular nucleus (EPN) (1) project glutamate-releasing axons to the LHb, (2) activate AMPARs and NMDARs, and (3) promote LHb neuronal firing to drive aversive behaviors (Root et al., 2014Root D.H. Mejias-Aponte C.A. Qi J. Morales M. Role of glutamatergic projections from ventral tegmental area to lateral habenula in aversive conditioning.J.

Neurosci. 2016; 36: 302-311Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). Importantly, unexpected punishments engage the LH-to-LHb pathway to trigger LHb neuronal excitation (Lecca et al., 2017Lecca S. Meye F.J. Trusel M. Tchenio A. Harris J. Schwarz M.K. Burdakov D. Georges F. Mameli M. Aversive stimuli drive hypothalamus-to-habenula excitation to promote escape behavior.eLife. 2017; 6: e30697Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). We examined the possibility that synaptic potentiation in the LHb during avoidance also presents circuit specificity. To this end, we virally expressed the excitatory opsin CoChR (CoChR-EGFP; Klapoetke et al., 2014Klapoetke N.C. Murata Y. Kim S.S. Pulver S.R. Birdsey-Benson A. Cho Y.K. Morimoto T.K. Chuong A.S. Carpenter E.J. Tian Z. et al.Independent optical excitation of distinct neural populations.Nat. Methods. 2014; 11: 338-346Crossref PubMed Scopus (1200) Google Scholar) into the LH, mVTA, or the EPN (Figure 3A). Whole-cell recordings within the fluorescent terminal fields in the LHb, from all these inputs, confirmed the excitatory nature of opto-currents (Figures 3B and S2D). 24 h after training session one and two (II and III), AMPAR/NMDAR ratios at LH-LHb synapses were significantly larger in learner compared to control mice, matching the initial progression of avoidance learning. Instead, optically driven mVTA- and EPN-LHb AMPAR/NMDAR ratios were comparable between groups (Figures 3B and S2E). Notably, AMPARs/NMDARs in control condition were highly variable across inputs, indicating pathway-specific postsynaptic properties. In addition, a fear-conditioning protocol, where CS-US association occurs but in an inescapable condition, failed to change LH-LHb AMPAR/NMDAR ratios (Figure S2F). We find that an optical-high frequency stimulation (HFS) protocol at LH inputs paired with postsynaptic depolarization employing the fast opsins CoChR and Chrimson (Klapoetke et al., 2014Klapoetke N.C. Murata Y. Kim S.S. Pulver S.R. Birdsey-Benson A. Cho Y.K. Morimoto T.K. Chuong A.S. Carpenter E.J. Tian Z. et al.Independent optical excitation of distinct neural populations.Nat. Methods. 2014; 11: 338-346Crossref PubMed Scopus (1200) Google Scholar) led to LTP in control mice (Figure S2G). This phenomenon was absent at EPN inputs and occluded in learner mice (Figures S2G and S2H). These data support the notion that (1) at LH-LHb synapses, AMPAR/NMDAR ratio increases along with LTP (Figure S2I) and (2) learning-driven AMPAR potentiation is circuit specific. To corroborate these results and visualize the locus of expression for avoidance-driven AMPAR potentiation, we employed freeze-fracture replica immunolabeling (Schönherr et al., 2016Schönherr S. Seewald A. Kasugai Y. Bosch D. Ehrlich I. Ferraguti F. Combined optogenetic and freeze-fracture replica immunolabeling to examine input-specific arrangement of glutamate receptors in the mouse amygdala.J. Vis. Exp. 2016; (53853)Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar). Combined with infusion of rAAV2-hSyn-CoChR-EGFP, this approach allows the quantification of membrane AMPARs specifically at synapses formed by LH axons to LHb postsynaptic neurons (Figure 3C). AMPARs (GluA1–4) gold immunolabeling showed no overall difference in density between learner and control mice. However, in learner mice (24 h after session 2), a larger fraction of particles (receptors) within the broader postsynaptic membrane specialization (PSD) areas was observed compared to control animals (Figure 3C). Altogether, this suggests that a larger postsynaptic membrane pool of AMPARs underlies the potentiation of LH-to-LHb excitatory synapses during avoidance learning. We next aimed to probe the necessity of LH inputs for avoidance learning. We tested LH-to-LHb projections requirement by optically reducing their function. We transduced LH neurons with a light-driven chloride pump (orange-red spectrum of activation) via infusion of rAAV2-JAWS-EGFP (Figure 4A). 4 weeks later, we prepared acute brain slices and found that 584-nm light reduced EPSCs within the LHb (Figure S3A). Next, we recorded foot-shock-driven LH-dependent LHb excitation using single units in anesthetized mice (Lecca et al., 2017Lecca S. Meye F.J. Trusel M. Tchenio A. Harris J. Schwarz M.K. Burdakov D. Georges F. Mameli M. Aversive stimuli drive hypothalamus-to-habenula excitation to promote escape behavior.eLife. 2017; 6: e30697Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Light at 638 nm reduced foot-shock excitation in JAWS-expressing mice, but not in GFP-control animals (Figure S3B). These experiments also revealed that light off failed to induce any rebound excitation (Figure S3B). Thus, JAWS activation efficiently reduces presynaptic function of LH terminals onto the LHb. Next, we chronically implanted JAWS-expressing mice with a single fiber optic directed just above the LHb (Figure S3C). We reasoned that breaking the contingency between CS and US by functionally limiting LH-LHb projections would impair the formation of punishment-predictive cues. Shining light at 638 nm to silence LH-to-LHb terminals during CS presentation reduced avoidance learning (Figure 4B). This highlights the necessary role of the LH-LHb projection for the acquisition of avoidance behavioral strategy. Although this provides insights for the circuit requirement of avoidance, it leaves open the existence of causality between AMPAR strengthening and behavior. We predicted that synaptic potentiation of AMPARs is an essential mechanism for avoidance learning. To test this, we employed chromophore-assisted light inactivation with eosin (CALI) to inactivate GluA1-containing AMPARs with precise temporal and spatial resolution (Takemoto et al., 2017Takemoto K. Iwanari H. Tada H. Suyama K. Sano A. Nagai T. Hamakubo T. Takahashi T. Optical inactivation of synaptic AMPA receptors erases fear memory.Nat. Biotechnol. 2017; 35: 38-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Monoclonal antibodies against an extracellular domain of GluA1 (236–286 amino acids [aas]) chemically labeled with eosin produce oxygen singlets in response to 532-nm laser light, thereby damaging synaptic GluA1-AMPARs (CALI-GluA1) (Takemoto et al., 2017Takemoto K. Iwanari H. Tada H. Suyama K. Sano A. Nagai T. Hamakubo T. Takahashi T. Optical inactivation of synaptic AMPA receptors erases fear memory.Nat. Biotechnol. 2017; 35: 38-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Notably, CALI-GluA1 efficiently targets and impairs newly inserted AMPARs, which represent a receptor pool more labile and less anchored to the scaffolding complex (Malinow and Malenka, 2002Malinow R. Malenka R.C. AMPA receptor trafficking and synaptic plasticity.Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 2002; 25: 103-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (2063) Google Scholar, Takemoto et al., 2017Takemoto K. Iwanari H. Tada H. Suyama K. Sano A. Nagai T. Hamakubo T. Takahashi T. Optical inactivation of synaptic AMPA receptors erases fear memory.Nat. Biotechnol. 2017; 35: 38-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). To examine the efficiency of CALI-GluA1 in the LHb, we locally infused the antibody in control and learner mice 4–5 h prior session two (Figure 4C). 1 h after session two, we found that continuous 532-nm laser light onto slices reduced AMPAR currents solely in learner mice (Figure 4C). This suggests that CALI-GluA1 rapidly and efficiently diminishes AMPAR transmission in animals undergoing avoidance learning. Therefore, this intervention offers an opportunity to test causality between strengthened AMPAR transmission and avoidance learning with fine temporal and spatial precision. In order to achieve this, we initially trained a set of mice during session one. The following day, the same mice underwent infusion of either CALI-GluA1 or a control antibody (anti-Myc-eosin, Ctrl-Ab) into the LHb (Takemoto et al., 2017Takemoto K. Iwanari H. Tada H. Suyama K. Sano A. Nagai T. Hamakubo T. Takahashi T. Optical inactivation of synaptic AMPA receptors erases fear memory.Nat. Biotechnol. 2017; 35: 38-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Mice were then implanted with a fiber optic and experienced training session two (Figure S3D). 1 h post-training, we exposed the injected area to 532 nm continuous illumination. The following day, mice were tested on session day three (Figure 4D). All injected animals (“learners“) progressively increased avoidance performance during the initial two sessions (Figure 4D). Illumination left the progression of learning intact in mice infused with Ctrl-Ab. In contrast, CALI-GluA1-L mice failed to further improve their avoidance performance and exhibited a significant reduction in cue-driven avoidance compared to Ctrl-Ab-L mice. CALI-GluA1 did not affect the behavior of control mice (Figure 4D). When examining AMPAR/NMDAR ratio in LHb-containing slices from these same animals, we found that Ctrl-Ab-L mice exhibited high AMPAR/NMDAR ratios. In contrast, CALI-GluA1-L mice presented a significantly lower AMPAR/NMDAR, comparable to those from CALI-GluA1 control mice. Altogether, this indicates that GluA1-mediated synaptic potentiation in the LHb is a requirement for proper avoidance. LHb neurons respond to unpredicted punishments. Here, we show that also punishment-predictive cues excite LHb neuronal population during avoidance learning. This phenomenon parallels the expression of an LTP-like process at lateral hypothalamic-to-LHb excitatory synapses, a synaptic substrate necessary for avoidance. We describe that, during avoidance learning, a transient enhancement of excitatory synaptic transmission onto LHb neurons occurs as a result of AMPAR enrichment at LH-to-LHb synapses. In addition, LHb neurons of learner mice did not show, in contrast to control animals, HFS-LTP in acute brain slices. This suggests that, during the steep initial phase of avoidance learning, LH-to-LHb excitatory synapses undergo potentiation. Such synaptic potentiation, however, does not occur during CS-US association in an inescapable context, an encoding primarily mediated by amygdala neuronal populations (Ciocchi et al., 2010Ciocchi S. Herry C. Grenier F. Wolff S.B. Letzkus J.J. Vlachos I. Ehrlich I. Sprengel R. Deisseroth K. Stadler M.B. et al.Encoding of conditioned fear in central amygdala inhibitory circuits.Nature. 2010; 468: 277-282Crossref PubMed Scopus (667) Google Scholar). Short-term and long-term changes in excitatory transmission within the LHb are also instrumental for punishment-mediated innate escape as well as for behavioral despair in depressive states (Lecca et al., 2017Lecca S. Meye F.J. Trusel M. Tchenio A. Harris J. Schwarz M.K. Burdakov D. Georges F. Mameli M.

Altogether, these data highlight the contribution of glutamatergic transmission for precise LHb-dependent neuronal encoding, ultimately leading to avoidance learning. A feature of this study is the input-specific expression of avoidance learning-induced plasticity. Afferents from the LH, the mVTA, and the EPN onto the LHb contribute to aversion processing and are sufficient to drive aversive behaviors (Root et al., 2014Root D.H. Mejias-Aponte C.A. Qi J.

The avoidance-learning-mediated adaptations, including the increase in AMPAR/NMDAR ratio, occlusion of LTP, and higher AMPARs membrane expression, specifically occur at LH-to-LHb synapses. In addition, silencing LH-to-LHb terminals diminishes avoidance behaviors. What renders the LH-to-LHb an essential substrate for avoidance? cAMP responsive element binding protein (CREB) phosphorylation, crucial for learning processes, occurs during avoidance in the hypothalamus (Saha and Datta, 2005Saha S.

We show that a pair of CdS cluster isomers provides an advantageous experimental platform to study isomerization in well-defined atomically precise systems. The clusters coherently interconvert over an est. 1 eV energy barrier with a 140 meV shift in their excitonic energy gaps. There is a diffusionless, displacive reconfiguration of the inorganic core (solid-solid transformation) with first order (isomerization-like) transformation kinetics. Driven by a distortion of the ligand binding motifs, the presence of hydroxyl species changes the surface energy via physisorption, which determines phase stability in this system. This reaction possesses essential characteristics of both solid-solid transformations and molecular isomerizations, and bridges these disparate length scales."

However, increasing age coupled with changes in the diet can affect the interaction of intestinal microbiota influencing the immune system, which can lead to chronic inflammation. How age and calorie-enriched OBD interact with microbial flora and impact leukocyte profiling is currently under investigated. Here, we tested the interorgan hypothesis to determine whether OBD in young and aging mice alters the gut microbe composition and the splenic leukocyte profile in acute heart failure (HF). Young (2-mo-old) and aging (18-mo-old) mice were supplemented with standard diet (STD, ∼4% safflower oil diet) and OBD (10% safflower oil) for 2 mo and then subjected to coronary artery ligation to induce myocardial infarction. Fecal samples were collected pre- and post-diet intervention, and the microbial flora were analyzed using 16S variable region 4 rRNA gene DNA sequencing and Quantitative Insights Into Microbial Ecology informatics. The STD and OBD in aging mice resulted in an expansion of the genus Allobaculum in the fecal microbiota. However, we found a pathologic change in the neutrophil:lymphocyte ratio in aging mice in comparison with their young counterparts. Thus, calorie-enriched OBD dysregulated splenic leukocytes by decreasing immune-responsive F4/80+ and CD169+ macrophages in aging mice. OBD programmed neutrophil swarming with an increase in isoprostanoid levels, with dysregulation of lipoxygenases, cytokines, and metabolite-sensing receptor expression. In summary, calorie-dense OBD in aging mice disrupted the composition of the gut microbiome, which correlates with the development of integrative and system-wide nonresolving inflammation in acute HF.-Kain, V., Van Der Pol, W., Mariappan, N., Ahmad, A., Eipers, P., Gibson, D.

Our earlier studies highlighted the tumour-suppressor effect of secreted protein acidic and rich in cysteine (SPARC) in OvCa through multi-faceted roles inhibiting cancer cell interactions within the peritoneal milieu. The goal of this study is to investigate the role of SPARC in OvCa interactions with omental adipocytes and its role in OvCa colonization in the omentum. We employed multi-pronged approach using primary omental adipocytes from Sparc knockout mice, genetically engineered human omental adipocytes in 3D co-cultures with OvCa cells, as well as treatment with recombinant SPARC protein. We show that SPARC suppresses multistep cascade in OvCa omental metastasis. SPARC inhibited in vivo and adipocyte-induced homing, proliferation, and invasion of OvCa cells. SPARC suppressed metabolic programming of both adipocytes and OvCa cells and exerted an inhibitory effect of adipocyte differentiation and their phenotypic switch to cancer-associated phenotype. Mechanistic studies revealed that this effect is mediated through inhibition of cEBPβ-NFkB-AP-1 transcription machinery. These findings define a novel and functionally important role of SPARC in OvCa and not only bridge the knowledge gap but highlight the need to consider SPARC protein expression in therapeutic development."

Throughout the works, several efforts were reported to prepare new function of chitosan by chemical modifications for renewable energy, such as fuel cell application. This paper focuses on synthesis of the chitosan derivative, namely, O-nitrochitosan which was synthesized at various compositions of sodium hydroxide and reacted with nitric acid fume. Its potential as biopolymer electrolytes was studied. The substitution of nitro group was analyzed by using Attenuated Total Reflectance Fourier Transform Infra-Red (ATR-FTIR) analysis, Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) and Elemental Analysis (CHNS). The structure was characterized by X-ray Diffraction (XRD) and its thermal properties were examined by using differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and thermal gravimetric analysis (TGA). Whereas, the ionic conductivity of the samples was analyzed by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). From the IR spectrum results, the nitro group peaks of O-nitrochitosan, positioned at 1646 and 1355 cm-1, were clearly seen for all pH media. At pH 6, O-nitrochitosan exhibited the highest degree of substitution at 0.74 when analyzed by CHNS analysis and NMR further proved that C-6 of glucosamine ring was shifted to the higher field. However, the thermal stability and glass transition temperatures were decreased with acidic condition. The highest ionic conductivity of O-nitrochitosan was obtained at ~10-6 cm-1. Overall, the electrochemical property of new O-nitrochitosan showed a good improvement as compared to chitosan and other chitosan derivatives. Hence, O-nitrochitosan is a promising biopolymer electrolyte and has the potential to be applied in electrochemical devices."
https://openalex.org/W2912560052,"Genetic testing for BRCA1, a DNA repair protein, can identify carriers of pathogenic variants associated with a substantially increased risk for breast and ovarian cancers. However, an association with increased risk is unclear for a large fraction of BRCA1 variants present in the human population.

Functional assays are valuable tools to assess the potential pathogenicity of these variants. Here, we systematically probed the effects of substitutions in the C terminus of BRCA1: the N- and C-terminal borders of its tandem BRCT domain, the BRCT-[N-C] linker region, and the α1 and α′1 helices in BRCT-[N] and -[C]. Using a validated transcriptional assay based on a fusion of the GAL4 DNA-binding domain to the BRCA1 C terminus (amino acids 1396–1863), we assessed the functional impact of 99 missense variants of BRCA1. We include the data obtained for these 99 missense variants in a joint analysis to generate the likelihood of pathogenicity for 347 missense variants in BRCA1 using VarCall, a Bayesian integrative statistical model. The results from this analysis increase our understanding of BRCA1 regions less tolerant to changes, identify functional borders of structural domains, and predict the likelihood of pathogenicity for 98% of all BRCA1 missense variants in this region recorded in the population.

The transcriptional activation (TA) assay has been extensively used to evaluate BRCA1 VUS (25Woods N.T. Baskin R. Golubeva V. Jhuraney A. De-Gregoriis G. Vaclova T. Goldgar D.E. Couch F.J. Carvalho M.A. Iversen E.S. Monteiro A.N. Functional assays provide a robust tool for the clinical annotation of genetic variants of uncertain significance.NPJ Genom. Med. 2016; 1 (28781887): 1600110.1038/npjgenmed.2016.1Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). In this validated assay, a fusion of a heterologous DNA-binding domain (yeast GAL4 DBD) and the C terminus of BRCA1 drives the expression of a reporter gene. Pathogenic variants have compromised transcription activation, whereas nonpathogenic variants display activity comparable with the reference “WT” allele. To allow for integration of functional assay results in the multifactorial model a Bayesian two-component mixture model, called VarCall, was developed that generates probabilities of pathogenicity given the functional data (26Iversen E.S. Couch F.J. Goldgar D.E. Tavtigian S.V. Monteiro A.N.A. A computational method to classify variants of uncertain significance using functional assay data with application to BRCA1.Cancer Epidemiol. Biomarkers Prev. 2011; 20 (21447777): 1078-108810.1158/1055-9965.EPI-10-1214Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Recent analysis of 249 missense variants confirmed the importance of the BRCT domains for BRCA1 function, but also revealed regions within the BRCT domains that seemed tolerant to mutations (25Woods N.T. Baskin R. Golubeva V. Jhuraney A. De-Gregoriis G. Vaclova T. Goldgar D.E. Couch F.J. Carvalho M.A. Iversen E.S. Monteiro A.N. Functional assays provide a robust tool for the clinical annotation of genetic variants of uncertain significance.NPJ Genom. Med. 2016; 1 (28781887): 1600110.1038/npjgenmed.2016.1Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Thus, to refine and extend the coverage of missense VUS in the BRCA1 C-terminal we tested 102 variants (99 missense and 3 truncating) probing the functional borders of the BRCT domains, α helices in BRCT-[N] and BRCT-[C], and the linker region between BRCT units. Finally, we conducted a joint analysis including all 347 BRCA1 missense variants tested to date. We tested 102 (99 missense and 3 truncating) VUS in the BRCA1 C-terminal region (aa 1396–1863) not previously analyzed using the TA assay, with a focus on structural features, divided in five groups: (a) 20 variants located at the border region between the disordered region and the BRCT-[N] at residues p.K1648 (to Gln, Glu, Thr, Arg, Ile, and Asn), p.R1649 (to Gly, Thr, Lys, Ile, and Ser), p.M1650 (to Leu, Val, Thr, Arg, and Lys), and p.S1651 (to Ala, Cys, Pro, and Tyr); (b) 67 variants located in the linker region connecting BRCT-[N] and BRCT-[C]; (c) 9 variants in α-helices α1 and α3 in BRCT-[N] and in α′1 and α′3 in BRCT-[C]; (d) 3 deletion mutants to probe the C-terminal border of BRCT domain; and (e) 3 assorted variants documented in the population (p.S1577Y, p.E1609G, and p.G1770E) (Fig. 1) (Table S1). We also examined two approaches for transcription data normalization using internal vector only and ectopic protein expression levels. We interrogated 4 amino acid residue positions at the N-terminal border of BRCT domains (aa 1648–1651). When normalizing against an internal vector control for 20 variants in this group, 19 displayed transcription activity comparable with that of WT BRCA1 protein and variant p.S1651P was the only variant in this set with significantly compromised (<80%) function (Fig. 2A). These results suggest that residue p.S1651 is the first position of the tandem BRCT functional and structural unit sensitive to missense changes. Nonsense variants that result in an 11-amino acid truncation at the C-terminal region of BRCA1 lead to a dysfunctional protein (2Miki Y. Swensen J. Shattuck-Eidens D. Futreal P.A. Harshman K. Tavtigian S. Liu Q. Cochran C. Bennett L.M. Ding W. A strong candidate for the breast and ovarian cancer susceptibility gene BRCA1.Science. 1994; 266 (7545954): 66-7110.1126/science.7545954Crossref PubMed Scopus (5295) Google Scholar). Deletion of eight final amino acid residues may also disrupt tBRCT function (27Carvalho M.A. Marsillac S.M. Karchin R. Manoukian S. Grist S. Swaby R.F. Urmenyi T.P. Rondinelli E. Silva R. Gayol L. et al.Determination of cancer risk associated with germ line BRCA1 missense variants by functional analysis.Cancer Res. 2007; 67 (17308087): 1494-150110.1158/0008-5472.CAN-06-3297Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). To investigate the minimal region needed for BRCA1 activity we generated three nonsense variants: p.I1855X, p.P1856X, and p.Q1857X (Fig. 1B). All three deletions dramatically affected activity and expression levels of the protein carrying the deletion variants (Fig. 2B). This finding indicates that deletion of as few as 7 amino acid residues from the C terminus leads to protein instability, abrogation of BRCT function, and may therefore be pathogenic. We tested 67 variants at 18 residue positions located across the BRCT linker region (Fig. 1B), and 49 variants displayed reduced activity (mean <80% WT activity). Although the majority of these low activity variants localize to secondary structures, every residue position probed (with the exception of 1755 and 1757) had at least one change that impacted function (<80% WT activity) (Fig. 3, A–C). Residue positions present in intervening sequences were more tolerant to changes than residues at the linker helices. In summary, missense changes in the linker region are likely to have an impact on function and most variants impact protein stability. We evaluated nine variants in four α-helices in both BRCT domains (α1, α3, α′1, and α′3) (Fig. 3, D and E). Seven variants had significantly reduced activity indicating the importance of these α-helices, despite the lack of functional impact of most variants previously analyzed (25Woods N.T. Baskin R. Golubeva V. Jhuraney A. De-Gregoriis G. Vaclova T. Goldgar D.E. Couch F.J. Carvalho M.A. Iversen E.S. Monteiro A.N. Functional assays provide a robust tool for the clinical annotation of genetic variants of uncertain significance.NPJ Genom. Med. 2016; 1 (28781887): 1600110.1038/npjgenmed.2016.1Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). We tested two variants described in the population and located in the disordered region (p.S1577Y and p.E1609G) but they did not have an effect on activity (Fig. 3D), as expected. Variant p.G1770E, located in an intervening segment between β′1 and α′1 had a significant impact on function (Fig. 3E). The previous analysis controlled for differences in transfection efficiency in each well by normalizing transcriptional activity, measured by firefly luciferase, by a Renilla luciferase control reporter (driven by HSV thymidine kinase promoter) (Fig. S1A). Protein expression levels of GAL4DBD:BRCA1 variants were assessed by Western blotting (Fig. S1B) to determine whether missense variants caused protein instability but were not used to normalize the results. To test whether using protein levels for normalization would improve the assay accuracy we also assessed each variant's activity normalized by protein levels (GAL4DBD:BRCA1 and β-actin) (Fig. 4). Similar coefficient of variation distributions were obtained when normalizing by vector only (mean = 17.52, S.D. = 17.77) or by vector and protein levels (mean = 16.57, S.D. = 12.3) (Fig. S2A). Thirty-five variants, all located in the BRCT domains, showed discordant results between the two normalization methods (Fig. 4, A–D) when using the 80% threshold of activity. Of those, 33 variants were called defective when normalizing by vector only but similar to WT when normalizing to vector and protein levels due to low levels of expression (Fig. S1). However, although these variants were discordant using the arbitrary 80% activity threshold, after the generation of likelihood of pathogenicity by VarCall (see below), only five variants were discordant, indicating that this threshold may be too stringent. Expression of these variants was consistently low in independent experiments suggesting these amino acid changes lead to protein instability rather than reflecting errors during transient transfections. Consistent with this, seven of 15 selected variants with compromised expression in mammalian cells also failed to express in stable yeast transformants (Fig. S2B). We selected variants p.V1740E and p.H1746D, which showed instability in mammalian cells but are stably expressed in yeast to assess reporter function. Both variants showed markedly reduced reporter transcription activation function, even when reaching steady state levels comparable with WT (Fig. S2C). Taken together, these results indicate that normalization using protein levels may lead to inflated activity levels when lower levels of expression are due to instability caused by the amino acid changes, which ultimately lead to defective function, and not due to errors during transient transfections. Next, we incorporated the results obtained for the 99 missense variants in the present study into the VarCall algorithm in a joint analysis with data from published variants to estimate the likelihood of pathogenicity of 347 variants (25Woods N.T. Baskin R. Golubeva V. Jhuraney A. De-Gregoriis G. Vaclova T. Goldgar D.E. Couch F.J. Carvalho M.A. Iversen E.S. Monteiro A.N.

The output from VarCall represents the likelihood of pathogenicity given the effects on the functional capacity of the variant as previously described (Fig. 5A) (Table S3). We previously developed a “functional class” (fClass) scoring scheme (25Woods N.T. Baskin R. Golubeva V. Jhuraney A. De-Gregoriis G. Vaclova T. Goldgar D.E. Couch F.J. Carvalho M.A. Iversen E.S. Monteiro A.N. Functional assays provide a robust tool for the clinical annotation of genetic variants of uncertain significance.NPJ Genom. Med. 2016; 1 (28781887): 1600110.1038/npjgenmed.2016.1Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar) using the posterior probability calculation of a variant being pathogenic in the TA assays (PrDel) output by VarCall to generate functional classifications (fClass): PrDel ≤ 0.001 as fClass 1 (nonpathogenic), 0.001 < PrDel ⩽ 0.05 as fClass 2 (likely not pathogenic), 0.05 > Pr-Del ⩽ 0.95 as fClass 3 (uncertain), 0.95 < PrDel ⩽ 0.99 as fClass 4 (likely pathogenic), and PrDel > 0.99 as fClass 5 (pathogenic). According to this scheme, 347 variants were assessed and only 13 variants remain as VUS (Table 1) (Fig. 5B) (for variant labels and details see Fig. S3). Of the 99 variants tested in this article only six remain as VUS (Table 1).Table 1Improvement in classification of BRCA1 missense variants Open table in a new tab To assess the performance of VarCall we used a reference panel of 49 known variants classified by the multifactorial model (6Lindor N.M. Guidugli L. Wang X. Vallée M.P. Monteiro A.N. Tavtigian S. Goldgar D.E. Couch F.J. A review of a multifactorial probability-based model for classification of BRCA1 and BRCA2 variants of uncertain significance (VUS).Hum. Mutat. 2012; 33 (21990134): 8-2110.1002/humu.21627Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar) (Table S4). For this assessment we combined IARC Class 1 with 2 (nonpathogenic and likely nonpathogenic) and IARC Class 4 with 5 classes (likely pathogenic and pathogenic). The assay displayed sensitivity of 0.95 (95% CI = 0.72–1.00) and specificity of 1.00 (95% CI = 0.84–1.00) when including a missense variant whose pathogenicity is due to splicing defects (p.R1495M). When using a panel of variants excluding this variant, with prior knowledge of splicing defects, sensitivity improves to 1 (95% CI = 0.78–1.0), confirming that the model can be used to classify VUS reliably given the functional data. The contributions of the present data set (n = 99) are not limited to the proposed classification of these individual variants but also will provide refinement of previous classifications when the VarCall is run with the complete dataset (n = 347). Indeed, not only the fraction of VUS decreased significantly but also more variants are now classified as fClass 1 (Table 1) (Fig. 5B). The improvement of functional classifications with the present dataset can be visualized in Fig. 5B, which tracks how variants previously assigned fClasses (P1–5) are now assigned to fClasses after the addition of the present dataset (N1–N5). Note that 100% of variants assigned to P1 remained in the corresponding N1 fClass and also 100% of variants in P5 remain in N5. Thus, nonpathogenic (fClass 1) and pathogenic (fClass 5) assignments were stable (Fig. 5B). Importantly, all variants in P4 were further refined to N5 as did a large fraction (85%) of variants in P2, which were further refined to N1 (Fig. 5B). All BRCT related features (β sheets, α helices, loops and turns, BRCT-[N], BRCT-[C], linker, and tandem BRCTs) were sensitive to missense changes with similar fraction of fClass 4 and 5 (mean = 0.43; median = 0.43; range = 0.35–0.48) (Fig. 5C, Table S5). Notably, no variant in the disordered region (n = 95) had a significant impact on function. The data presented above corresponds to a single functional assay. Thus, it is conceivable that variants that have no functional impact on transcription might be defective in different assays. We compiled published data for missense variants from 35 functional assays that assess variants in the C terminus of BRCA1 (aa 1315–1863) (Table S6). Using the reference panel (Table S4) we calculated specificity and sensitivity for this region of the protein for 24 assays for which there was at least three pathogenic and 3 nonpathogenic reference variants tested (Table 2) (for full table, see Table S7).Table 2Functional assays for BRCA1 variants (aa 1315–1863) a Refers to tracks in Table S6.b Variants tested in region aa 1315–1863.c Documented variants (aa 1315–1863) are those reported in BRCA Exchange database (n = 206) (42) follows individual studies' cut-offs for classification. Open table in a new tab a Refers to tracks in Table S6. b Variants tested in region aa 1315–1863. c Documented variants (aa 1315–1863) are those reported in BRCA Exchange database (n = 206) (42) follows individual studies' cut-offs for classification. All assays displayed high specificity (range 0.80–1.00) but a more variable sensitivity (range 0.63–1.00) with lower sensitivity found for yeast-based or protein stability assays, presumably due to a subset of pathogenic variants that are stabilized at lower temperatures and variants that do not affect protein stability, respectively (Table 2). Notably, the transcription assay described here achieves, for this region of the protein, the highest sensitivity and specificity of all assays, surpassing other functional assays assessing other canonical functions of BRCA1 such as homologous recombination (HR) (Table 2). Next, we determined the concordance between VarCall classification for transcription activation and homologous recombination assays (Tracks 18–23; Table S6). There were 60/70 variants (86%) scored by VarCall with at least one additional homologous recombination assay result in complete agreement. Three additional variants had agreement between VarCall and at least one HR assay (Fig. 6, A and B). However, due to a small sample size there was limited overlap with variants assessed in the present study (three, all concordant). To assess the variants in the present study we compared results from high throughput mutagenesis and cell viability for which there 87 variants classified by both methods. Concordance was also very high with 97% (84"

Methods We studied platelet counts in 1,760 cirrhotic patients undergoing invasive procedures at our hospital between January 2014 and December 2017. In addition, we studied 25 patients who were administered lusutrombopag before invasive procedures between June 2017 and January 2018. Effectiveness of lusutrombopag to raise platelet counts and to avoid transfusion and treatment-related adverse events were analyzed. Results In 1,760 cirrhotic patients without lusutrombopag prior to invasive procedures, proportion of patients whose platelet counts <50,000/μL and needed platelet transfusions were 66% (n = 27/41) for radiofrequency ablation, 43% (n = 21/49) for transarterial chemoembolization, and 55% (n = 21/38) for endoscopic injection sclerotherapy / endoscopic variceal ligation, respectively. In 25 cirrhotic patients treated by lusutrombopag prior to the invasive procedures, platelet counts significantly increased compared with baseline (82,000 ± 26,000 vs. 41,000 ± 11,000/μL) (p < 0.01). Out of 25 patients, only 4 patients (16%) needed platelet transfusion before the invasive procedures. The proportion of patients with low platelet count and who needed platelet transfusions was significantly low in patients treated with lusutrombopag compared to those not treated with lusutrombopag (16% (4/25) vs. 54% (69/128), p = 0.001). Platelet counts after lusutrombopag treatment and prior to invasive procedures were lower in patients with a baseline platelet count ≤30,000/μL (n = 8) compared with those with a baseline platelet count >30,000/μL (n = 17) (50,000 ± 20,000 vs 86,000 ± 26,000/μL, p = 0.002). Patients with a baseline platelet count ≤30,000/μL with spleen index (calculated by multiplying the transverse diameter by the vertical diameter measured by ultrasonography) ≥40 cm2 (n = 3) had a lower response rate to lusutrombopag compared to those with spleen index <40 cm2 (n = 5) (0% vs. 100%, p = 0.02). Hemorrhagic complication was not observed. Recurrence of portal thrombosis was observed and thrombolysis therapy was required in one patient who had prior history of thrombosis. Conclusions Lusutrombopag is an effective and safe drug for thrombocytopenia in cirrhotic patients, and can reduce the frequency of platelet transfusions."

We aimed to identify crucial genes associated with DDP resistance in ovarian cancer and uncover potential mechanisms. Two sets of gene expression data were downloaded from Gene Expression Omnibus, and bioinformatics analysis was conducted. In our study, the differentially expressed genes between DDP-sensitive and DDP-resistant ovarian cancer were screened in GSE15709 and GSE51373 database, and chromosome condensation 2 regulator (RCC2) and nucleoporin 160 were identified as 2 genes that significantly up-regulated in DDP-resistant ovarian cancer cell lines compared with DDP-sensitive cell lines. Moreover, RCC2, Ral small GTPase (RalA), and Ral binding protein-1 (RalBP1) expression was found to be significantly higher in DDP-resistant ovarian cancer tissues than in DDP-sensitive tissues. RCC2 plays a positive role in cell proliferation, apoptosis, and migration in DDP-resistant ovarian cancer cell lines in vitro and in vivo. Furthermore, RCC2 could interact with RalA, thus promoting its downstream effector RalBP1. RalA knockdown could reverse the effects of RCC2 overexpression on DDP-resistant ovarian cancer cell proliferation, apoptosis, and migration. Similarly, RalA overexpression could alleviate the effects of RCC2 knockdown in DDP-resistant ovarian cancer cells. Taken together, RCC2 may function as an oncogene, regulating the RalA signaling pathway, and intervention of RCC2 expression might be a promising therapeutic strategy for DDP-resistant ovarian cancer.-Gong, S., Chen, Y., Meng, F., Zhang, Y., Wu, H., Li, C., Zhang, G. RCC2, a regulator of the RalA signaling pathway, is identified as a novel therapeutic target in cisplatin-resistant ovarian cancer."
https://openalex.org/W2914029207,"Wheat Grain Yield (GY) and quality are particularly susceptible to nitrogen (N) fertilizer management. However, in rain-fed Mediterranean environments, crop N requirements might be variable due to the effects of water availability on crop growth. Therefore, in-season crop N status assessment is needed in order to apply N fertilizer in a cost-effective way while reducing environmental impacts. Remote sensing techniques might be useful at assessing in-season crop N status. In this study, we evaluated the capacity of vegetation indices formulated using blue (B), green (G), red (R) and near-infrared (NIR) bands obtained with a consumer-grade camera to assess wheat N status. Chlorophyll Content Index (CCI) and fractional intercepted PAR (fIPAR) were measured at three phenological stages and GY and biomass were determined at harvest. Indices formulated using RG bands and the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) were significantly correlated with both CCI and fIPAR at the different phenological stage (0.71 < r < 0.81, P < 0.01). Moreover, indices formulated using RG bands were capable at differentiating unfertilized and fertilized plots. In addition, RGB indices and NDVI were found to be related to both crop biomass and GY at harvest, particularly when data were obtained at initial grain filling stage (r > 0.80, P < 0.01). Finally, RGB indices and NDVI obtained with a consumer-grade camera showed comparable capacity at assessing chlorophyll content and predicting both crop biomass and GY at harvest than those obtained with a spectroradiometer. This study highlights the potential of standard and modified consumer-grade cameras at assessing canopy traits related to crop N status and GY in wheat under Mediterranean conditions."
https://openalex.org/W2914206429,"Human autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) is characterized by bilateral renal cysts that lead to a decline in kidney function. Previous studies reported aquaporin (AQP)-3 expression in cysts derived from collecting ducts in ADPKD. To study the role of AQP3 in cyst development, we generated 2 polycystic kidney disease (PKD) mouse models: kidney-specific Pkd1 knockout mice and inducible Pkd1 knockout mice, each without and with AQP3 deletion. In both models, kidney sizes and cyst indexes were significantly reduced in AQP3-null PKD mice compared with AQP3-expressing PKD mice, with the difference seen mainly in collecting duct cysts. AQP3-deficient kidneys showed significantly reduced ATP content, increased phosphorylated (p)-AMPK, and decreased p-ERK and p-mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR). In a matrix-grown Madin-Darby canine kidney cyst model, AQP3 expression promoted cyst enlargement and was associated with increased expression of hypoxia-inducible factor 1-α and glucose transporter 1 and increased glucose uptake. Our data suggest that the slowed renal cyst enlargement in AQP3 deficiency involves impaired energy metabolism in the kidney through AMPK and mTOR signaling and impaired cellular glucose uptake. These findings implicate AQP3 as a novel determinant of renal cyst enlargement and hence a potential drug target in ADPKD.-Wang, W., Geng, X., Lei, L., Jia, Y., Li, Y., Zhou, H., Verkman, A.

We investigated the effect of paternal HFD on the hepatic transcriptomic and metabolic signatures of female grand-offspring. Paternal HFD strongly impacted the liver transcriptome of the second-generation offspring. Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) revealed grandpaternal-HFD altered the TNF-α signaling via NFκB pathway, independent of the grand-offspring's diet. Reduction in the hepatic cytokine levels, including the TNF-α, as well as NFκB content and activity, suggest that the basal inflammatory response in F2 rats is disturbed. GSEA also show altered expression of various genes annotated to the fatty acid metabolism. Grandpaternal-HFD reduced G0/G1 switch gene 2 (G0S2) expression, concomitant with reduced hepatic triglyceride content in F2 rats. In conclusion, the hepatic transcriptome is altered in grand-offspring from HFD-fed grandfathers. Altered TNF-α/NFκB signaling and levels of inflammatory cytokines indicate grandpaternal HFD impacts hepatic immunometabolism. Overall, our findings indicate that paternal exposure to environmental factors transgenerationally reprograms metabolism in a tissue-specific manner, affecting the development and health of future generations.-De Castro Barbosa, T., Alm, P.

Impulsivity is a major factor contributing to this transmission risk behavior; however comprehensive studies within female, prison, and Asian populations are scarce. This cross-sectional study aims to delineate the contributions of different aspects of impulsivity to risk behavior, among female inmates living in a prison in Jakarta (N = 214). The relationships between various aspects of impulsivity, risk behaviors and seropositivity were tested using analyses of variance and logistic regression analyses. Motor impulsivity was related to alcohol use, reward-related impulsivity to drug use, and cognitive/goal-directed impulsivity to sexual risk behavior. Finally, goal-directed impulsivity was also directly associated with seropositivity. Specific aspects of impulsivity are associated with different types of risk behavior in Indonesian female prisoners, which can be relevant for future studies on infection prevention strategies for such a population."

The 5-year disease-specific survival rate was 58.9% (95% Cl 55.0-62.8%). High AZIN2 expression was associated with mucinous histology (p = 0.002) and location in the right hemicolon (p = 0.021). We found no association with age, gender, stage, or histological tumor grade. High tumor expression of AZIN2 predicted an unfavorable prognosis (p<0.0001, log-rank test), compared to low AZIN2 expression. Cox multivariable analysis identified AZIN2 as an independent factor of an unfavorable prognosis in CRC. The strongest AZIN2 expression was seen in invasive tumor cells having morphological features of epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT). Induction of EMT in HT-29 CRC cells lead to upregulated expression of endogenous AZIN2. Given that AZIN2 is a regulator of vesicle transport and secretion, we overexpressed human AZIN2 cDNA in T84 CRC cells, and found strongly enhanced accumulation of CD63-positive exosomes in the culture medium. These findings indicate that AZIN2 expression is a signature of EMT-associated secretory phenotype that is linked to an adverse prognosis in CRC."
https://openalex.org/W2912002604,"Neuronal polarization depends on the interaction of intracellular chemical and mechanical activities in which the cytoplasmic protein, talin, plays a pivotal role during neurite growth. To better understand the mechanism underlying talin function in neuronal polarization, we overexpressed several truncated forms of talin and found that the presence of the rod domain within the overexpressed talin is required for its positive effect on neurite elongation because the neurite number only increased when the talin head region was overexpressed. The tension in the talin rod was recognized using a Förster resonance energy transfer-based tension probe. Nerve growth factor treatment resulted in inward tension of talin elicited by microfilament force and outward osmotic pressure. By contrast, the glial scar-inhibitor aggrecan weakened these forces, suggesting that interactions between inward pull forces in the talin rod and outward osmotic pressure participate in neuronal polarization. Integrin activation is also involved in up-regulation of talin tension and osmotic pressure. Aggrecan stimuli resulted in up-regulation of docking protein 1 (DOK1), leading to the down-regulation of integrin activity and attenuation of the intracellular mechanical force. Our study suggests interactions between the intracellular inward tension in talin and the outward osmotic pressure as the effective channel for promoting neurite outgrowth, which can be up-regulated by integrin activation and down-regulated by DOK1.-Wang, Y., Zhang, X., Tian, J., Shan, J., Hu, Y., Zhai, Y., Guo, J. Talin promotes integrin activation accompanied by generation of tension in talin and an increase in osmotic pressure in neurite outgrowth."
https://openalex.org/W2914943322,"Classical cystathionine β-synthase-deficient homocystinuria (HCU) is a life-threatening inborn error of sulfur metabolism. Treatment for pyridoxine-nonresponsive HCU involves lowering homocysteine (Hcy) with a methionine (Met)-restricted diet and betaine supplementation. Betaine treatment efficacy diminishes significantly over time due to impairment of betaine-Hcy S-methyltransferase (BHMT) function. Little is known regarding the regulation of BHMT in HCU. Using a betaine-responsive preclinical mouse model of HCU, we observed that this condition induces a 75% repression of BHMT mRNA, protein and enzyme activity, and significant depletion of hepatic betaine levels. BHMT repression was proportional to plasma Hcy levels but was not observed in mouse models of homocystinuria due to either methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase or Met synthase deficiency. Both Met supplementation and chemically induced glutathione depletion exacerbated hepatic BHMT repression in HCU mice but not wild-type (WT) controls. Conversely, cysteine treatment normalized hepatic BHMT expression in HCU mice but had no effect in WT control animals. Taurine treatment induced BHMT expression in HCU mice by 5-fold and restored maximal lowering of Hcy levels during long-term betaine treatment with a concomitant normalization of inflammatory cytokine expression and a significantly improved coagulative phenotype. Collectively, our findings indicate that adjuvantial taurine treatment has the potential to significantly improve clinical outcomes in HCU.-Maclean, K. N., Jiang, H, Phinney, W. N., Keating, A.

https://openalex.org/W2912507826,"In this work, we analyse factors explaining the distribution and range regression of Dupont's lark in Spain, the only European country in which this threatened alaudid is present. Dupont's lark is an extremely elusive and scarce species, distributed across a reduced and strongly fragmented range, showing a metapopulational structure with unknown dispersive and connective mechanisms. We used maximum entropy modelling (Maxent) on nearly 15,000 Dupont's lark observations (1985-2015) to assess the probability of presence at a 1 km resolution across its European range. Moreover, we tested the probability of extinction by comparing pre- and post-2000 observations by means of a GLM over a subset of cells with presence-absence data. We obtained strong model fitting (AUC = 0.919), in which species occurrence was explained by low values of plant productivity (NDVI), climate (high temperature range and medium annual precipitation), land use (increasing with sclerophyllous scrubland), flat topography and human disturbance (associated with low human population density). The species also tolerates dry farming, but not other farm types or forest cover. The probability map identified two main regions known as the species' core areas: the steppes of the Iberian System and the Ebro Valley. The North Plateau is characterised by a dispersed structure of small and very fragmented patches of suitable habitat, while a succession of discontinuous probability patches form an Eastern Corridor connecting the central core areas to the southernmost populations. Finally, the model identified small and isolated patches of high probability of presence along the eastern coastline. The species tends to occur in the best available areas but, at the same time, the model revealed a large area of suitable but unoccupied habitat. Our results correct the previous estimation of occupation area from 1,480 to 1,010.78 km2, a reduction of 26.22%. The current distribution of Dupont's lark is almost completely covered by Important Bird Areas (IBAs), highlighting their importance for bird conservation, but only 44.89% is included in Natura 2000 Special Protection Areas (SPAs). A comparison of pre- and post-2000 periods revealed a range contraction of 44%. Probability of extinction increased with higher temperature range and lower annual precipitation, and with decreases in population density, which suggests that this species is extremely vulnerable to both climate change and rural abandonment, due to its dependence on traditional grazing. These results suggest the need for a re-evaluation of the conservation status of Dupont's lark in Spain. They urge the preservation of not only current extant populations, but also the unoccupied suitable areas that could be critical for metapopulation structure, and the development of policies addressing the preservation of traditional grazing."
https://openalex.org/W2952063041,"It is known that cortical networks operate on the edge of instability, in which oscillations can appear. However, the influence of this dynamic regime on performance in decision making, is not well understood. In this work, we propose a population model of decision making based on a winner-take-all mechanism. Using this model, we demonstrate that local slow inhibition within the competing neuronal populations can lead to Hopf bifurcation. At the edge of instability, the system exhibits ambiguity in the decision making, which can account for the perceptual switches observed in human experiments. We further validate this model with fMRI datasets from an experiment on semantic priming in perception of ambivalent (male versus female) faces. We demonstrate that the model can correctly predict the drop in the variance of the BOLD within the Superior Parietal Area and Inferior Parietal Area while watching ambiguous visual stimuli."

However, the physiological mechanisms underlying cellular quiescence remain largely unknown. In the present study, we used embryos of the crustacean Artemia in the diapause stage, in which these embryos remain quiescent for prolonged periods, as a model to explore the relationship between cell-membrane potential (Vmem) and quiescence. We found that Vmem is hyperpolarized and that the intracellular chloride concentration is high in diapause embryos, whereas Vmem is depolarized and intracellular chloride concentration is reduced in postdiapause embryos and during further embryonic development. We identified and characterized the chloride ion channel protein cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) of Artemia (Ar-CFTR) and found that its expression is silenced in quiescent cells of Artemia diapause embryos but remains constant in all other embryonic stages. Ar-CFTR knockdown and GlyH-101–mediated chemical inhibition of Ar-CFTR produced diapause embryos having a high Vmem and intracellular chloride concentration, whereas control Artemia embryos released free-swimming nauplius larvae. Transcriptome analysis of embryos at different developmental stages revealed that proliferation, differentiation, and metabolism are suppressed in diapause embryos and restored in postdiapause embryos. Combined with RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) of GlyH-101–treated MCF-7 breast cancer cells, these analyses revealed that CFTR inhibition down-regulates the Wnt and Aurora Kinase A (AURKA) signaling pathways and up-regulates the p53 signaling pathway.

Our findings provide insight into CFTR-mediated regulation of cellular quiescence and Vmem in the Artemia model. Cellular quiescence is a sleep-like and reversible state in which growth, proliferation, and other cellular activities are arrested. This state is thought to be homogenous and induced by diverse anti-mitogenic signals (1Coller H.A. Sang L. Roberts J.M.

Cellular quiescence also explains how some species produce embryos in a state of diapause or dormancy, which often enables their offspring to survive remarkably harsh environmental conditions (6Stuart J.A. Brown M.F. Energy, quiescence and the cellular basis of animal life spans.Comp. Biochem. Physiol. A Mol. Integr.

Development, reproduction, and metabolic activities are highly suppressed in this state, meaning that embryos are protected until the environmental conditions become favorable, at which point the cell cycle resumes (8Lubzens E. Cerda J. Clark M. Dormancy and Resistance in Harsh Environments. Springer, New York2010Crossref Google Scholar). Entry of cells into quiescence is often associated with dramatic changes in metabolism (9Valcourt J.R. Lemons J.M. Haley E.M. Kojima M. Demuren O.O. Coller H.A.

In addition, the cell membrane potential (Vmem) becomes hyperpolarized (10Sundelacruz S. Levin M. Kaplan D.L. Role of membrane potential in the regulation of cell proliferation and differentiation.Stem Cell Reviews. 2009; 5 (19562527): 231-24610.1007/s12015-009-9080-2Crossref PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar, 11Wright S.H.

Vmem, which refers to the voltage across the plasma membrane, is a key bioelectric property of nonexcitable cells (12Yang M. Brackenbury W.J. Membrane potential and cancer progression.Front. Physiol. 2013; 4 (23882223): 185Crossref PubMed Scopus (357) Google Scholar). Hyperpolarization of the resting Vmem is accompanied by decreased proliferation of astrocytes isolated from the developing spinal cord and hippocampus of rats (13Ransom C.B. Sontheimer H.

These observations led us to speculate that Vmem plays a critical role in cellular quiescence. However, there have been few reports on the relationship between cellular quiescence and Vmem. Ion channels establish the resting Vmem of all cells by determining the gradients of major ions, such as sodium, potassium, calcium, and chloride, across the cell membrane (15Brodwick M.S.

Chloride, which is the most abundant anion in all organisms, has multiple functions, including regulation of cell volume, signal transduction, cell death/survival, and intracellular pH and is believed to contribute to Vmem (16Inagaki C.

Structural studies described that CFTR is composed of a regulatory R domain and two repeated domains, each of which consists of a hydrophobic membrane-spanning domain (MSD) and a cytosolic hydrophilic region for binding to ATP (NBD) (19Sheppard D.N.

The present study demonstrates that Vmem was hyperpolarized and the intracellular chloride concentration was high in diapause embryos, whereas Vmem was depolarized and the intracellular chloride concentration was reduced in postdiapause embryos and during further embryonic development. CFTR of Artemia (Ar-CFTR) was silenced in diapause embryos, leading to inhibition of chloride outflow and consequently hyperpolarization. Transcriptome analysis indicated that proliferation, differentiation, and metabolism were suppressed in diapause embryos and that the Wnt and AURKA signaling pathways were down-regulated and the p53 signaling pathway was up-regulated upon inhibition of CFTR. Our findings provide evidence that modulation of Vmem by CFTR regulates cellular quiescence. Artemia possesses two independent reproductive pathways, ovoviviparous and oviparous, as a strategy to survive fluctuating environmental conditions. Under favorable conditions, embryos mature in the ovisac (uterus) and are released into the environment as free-swimming nauplius larvae via the ovoviviparous pathway (Fig. 1A, panels 1 and 2). By contrast, under unfavorable conditions, mature females produce and release encysted embryos that exist in a state of obligate dormancy, called diapause, via the oviparous pathway (Fig. 1A, panels 3 and 4). Cells in diapause embryos can remain quiescent and not divide for many years (27Browne R.A. Sorgeloos P. Trotman C.N.A. Artemia Biology. CRC Press, Boca Raton, FL1991: 37-73Google Scholar). Signals received from favorable environmental stimuli terminate diapause. This induces embryos to enter a state, followed by hatching of swimming nauplii after 18–24 h (Fig. 1A, panels 5–7). Western blotting analysis showed that expression of cell proliferation markers, phosphorylation histone H3 at Ser10 (pH3S10) and phosphorylation of retinoblastoma at Thr356 (pRbT356), was greatly reduced in diapause and postdiapause embryos (Fig. 1B). This finding suggests that the cell cycle has ceased at the diapause and postdiapause stages but not at other developmental stages. Furthermore, immunofluorescence analysis showed that the proliferation markers Ki67 and proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) were expressed in postdiapause embryos but not in diapause embryos (Fig. 1C). These results indicate that cells are quiescent in Artemia diapause embryos. This study focused on Vmem in Artemia during diapause formation. We isolated cells from embryos at each developmental stage (Fig. S1) and measured Vmem using DiBAC4(3), a Vmem-sensitive dye (Fig. 1D). Cells were considered depolarized when Vmem became less negative and hyperpolarized when Vmem became more negative. Vmem was relatively constant during ovoviviparous development; however, cells were extremely hyperpolarized from the prediapause stage to the diapause stage and depolarized in the postdiapause and nauplii stages. We measured the intracellular chloride concentration at each developmental stage using MQAE, a chloride-sensitive fluorescent dye. The fluorescence intensity of this dye decreases as the intracellular chloride concentration increases. Almost no fluorescence was observed in cells of diapause embryos (Fig. 1E), indicating that the intracellular chloride concentration was high. Taken together, these results indicate that cells in diapause embryos are quiescent and hyperpolarized with a high intracellular chloride concentration. To investigate the regulation of Vmem during diapause formation, we characterized Ar-CFTR. A candidate for Ar-CFTR was identified using the tblastn algorithm with human CFTR as the input. The full-length Ar-CFTR mRNA is 4924 bp, with a 4635-bp ORF encoding a protein of 1545 amino acids (aa) (Fig. S2). The calculated molecular mass and pI of Ar-CFTR are 173.02 kDa and 7.43, respectively. Structure analysis showed that Ar-CFTR contains two MSDs, MSD1 (aa 316–581) and MSD2 (aa 981–1255); two nucleotide-binding domains, NBD1 (aa 625–825) and NBD2 (aa 1302–1522); and a regulatory domain, R (aa 638–963), which are conserved in typical CFTRs (Fig. S3A). The amino acid sequence of the R domain of Ar-CFTR shows low overall sequence similarity (<30%) with those of the R domains of CFTRs in other species. However, the amino acids predicted to interact with serine and play a role in phosphorylation-dependent activation of this channel in vivo are conserved in Ar-CFTR, including Ser686, Ser700, Ser712, Ser737, and Ser768 in the KXS/RXXS motif (Fig. S3B). Phylogenetic analysis suggested that Ar-CFTR is grouped with CFTR expressed in the arthropod Daphnia pulex (Fig. S3C). Polyclonal antibodies specific to Ar-CFTR detected a band of ∼173 kDa in Artemia. The mRNA level of Ar-CFTR at each developmental stage was analyzed by real-time quantitative PCR (qPCR). mRNA expression of Ar-CFTR was ∼2–4-fold lower in diapause embryos than in embryos at other stages of the ovoviviparous pathway (Fig. 2A). Similarly, protein expression of Ar-CFTR was ∼7–10-fold lower in diapause embryos than in embryos at other developmental stages according to analysis performed using ImageJ (Fig. 2B). Furthermore, immunofluorescence analysis showed that Ar-CFTR was barely detected in diapause embryos but was observed at the cellular membrane in prediapause embryos, postdiapause embryos, and hatched nauplii (Fig. 2C). Thus, down-regulation of Ar-CFTR may be important for cellular quiescence during diapause formation in Artemia. To elucidate the role of Ar-CFTR in the regulation of diapause formation in Artemia, Ar-CFTR was knocked down by RNAi. A dsRNA designed based on the Ar-CFTR cDNA sequence was injected prior to ovarian development. Real-time qPCR and Western blotting analyses revealed that the mRNA and protein levels of Ar-CFTR were more than 80% lower in animals injected with Ar-CFTR dsRNA (Ar-CFTRi) than in those injected with GFP dsRNA (GFPi) (Fig. 3, A and B). An average of 75% of ovoviviparous Artemia injected with Ar-CFTR dsRNA released diapause embryos, whereas all of those injected with GFP dsRNA produced free-swimming nauplii (Fig. 3C). Western blotting and immunofluorescence analyses showed that expression of pH3S10, pRbT356, Ki67, and PCNA was reduced upon Ar-CFTR knockdown (Fig. 3, D and E). Furthermore, the diapause-specific proteins p26 and artemin (35Clegg J.S. Jackson S.A. Liang P. MacRae T.H.

Next, we investigated whether knockdown of Ar-CFTR induces hyperpolarization by increasing the intracellular chloride concentration. As expected, analysis of the fluorescence intensity of MQAE showed that Ar-CFTR knockdown increased the intracellular chloride concentration (Fig. 3F). Moreover, the fluorescence intensity of DiBAC4(3) was markedly reduced upon Ar-CFTR knockdown (Fig. 3G), indicating that silencing of Ar-CFTR induces hyperpolarization. To further verify the function of Ar-CFTR, we soaked nauplius-destined Artemia adults in 40‰ seawater containing 30 μm GlyH-101, a CFTR inhibitor. 30 μm was chosen according to a result of a dose-dependent experiment (Fig. S4A). Average 85% of ovoviviparous Artemia adults treated with GlyH-101 produced diapause embryos, whereas control Artemia adults treated with 30 μm DMSO released nauplii (Fig. 4A). Analysis of the chloride concentration and Vmem showed that inhibition of Ar-CFTR by GlyH-101 induced hyperpolarization by preventing chloride outflow (Fig. 4, B and C). The induced hyperpolarization was validated by analysis of a patch clamp recording (Fig. S5). Inhibition of Ar-CFTR by GlyH-101 also decreased the intracellular potassium and sodium concentrations, which were lower in diapause embryos than in prediapause and postdiapause embryos (Fig. S6). These findings indicate that CFTR regulates Vmem and thereby controls cellular quiescence during diapause formation. In addition, GlyH-101 treatment decreased expression of pH3S10, pRbT356, Ki67, and PCNA but increased that of p26 and artemin (Fig. 4, D and E). To investigate the function of Ar-CFTR in termination of cellular quiescence in diapause embryos, we treated decapsulated postdiapause embryos with 100 μm GlyH-101 to suppress Ar-CFTR activity during hatching. 100 μm was chosen according to the results of a dose-dependent experiment (Fig. S4B). Development of GlyH-101–treated embryos was arrested at the pre-emergence stage, before resumption of cell division (Fig. 5A). However, swimming nauplii hatched from control postdiapause embryos treated with DMSO after 24 h. In addition, removal of GlyH-101 resulted in average of 80% released nauplii, a rate that is similar to the natural hatching rate of Artemia in its natural environment (Fig. 5A). The results indicated that Ar-CFTR is required for termination of cellular quiescence. Fluorescence analysis using the bioelectricity reporter DiBAC4(3) and the chloride-sensitive dye MQAE revealed that Vmem remained hyperpolarized, and the chloride concentration remained high upon continuous treatment with GlyH-101 (Fig. 5, B and C). However, Vmem was depolarized, and chloride outflow was increased following removal of GlyH-101 (Fig. 5, B and C). Western blotting analysis revealed that levels of pH3S10 and pRbT356 increased after the pre-emergence stage and were high in nauplii in the control group. However, the levels of these two proliferation markers were low in the presence of GlyH-101 and increased after removal of GlyH-101 (Fig. 5D). Together, these results indicate that Ar-CFTR controls cellular quiescence during diapause formation by mediating chloride outflow and thereby modulating Vmem. To characterize the molecular signatures of quiescent cells and analyze downstream signaling pathways of CFTR, RNA-Seq of diapause embryos was performed. Genes that were differentially expressed between nauplius-destined ovoviviparous embryos, diapause-destined oviparous embryos (prediapause), diapause embryos, and postdiapause embryos are presented in a heat map (Fig. 6A). In total, 9573, 9458, and 6356 genes were differentially expressed between nauplius-destined ovoviviparous embryos and diapause embryos, between prediapause and diapause embryos, and between postdiapause and diapause embryos, respectively (Fig. 6B). In addition, expression of 3167 genes, including markers of diapause (p26, artemin, and ArHsp22) and cell division (Ki67 and PCNA), was higher or lower in diapause embryos than in ovoviviparous, prediapause, and postdiapause embryos. These results reveal the key molecular characteristics of quiescent cells in diapause embryos. Gene ontology (GO) enrichment analysis was performed of genes that were differentially expressed between diapause and postdiapause embryos. This revealed that expression of genes associated with proliferation, differentiation, and metabolism was suppressed in diapause embryos (Fig. 6C). Genes related to metabolism, including those associated with oxidative phosphorylation, the carbohydrate metabolic process, the cholesterol metabolic process, polysaccharide digestion, the fatty–acyl-CoA metabolic process, the aerobic electron transport chain, and autophagy, as well as genes related to cell proliferation, including those associated with the mitotic cell cycle, RNA polymerase II transcription factor activity, and translation regulator activity, were down-regulated in diapause embryos. By contrast, genes associated with chitin binding, cuticle development, negative regulation of cellular metabolic processes, and lipid storage were up-regulated in diapause embryos. Analysis of related pathways and genes showed that the Wnt and AURKA signaling pathways were down-regulated, and the p53 signaling pathway was up-regulated in diapause embryos (Fig. S7). To identify the signaling pathways by which CFTR-regulated hyperpolarization controls cellular quiescence, we treated MCF-7 cells with 10 μm GlyH-101 to inhibit CFTR. 10 μm was chosen according to a result of a dose-dependent experiment (Fig. S4C). Immunofluorescence analysis of the proliferation marker Ki67, EdU incorporation analysis, and Western blotting analysis of pH3S10 and pRbT356 indicated"

In no-choice and choice feeding tests, we observed that the 3rd instar larvae consumed decreased area of leaves treated with ginsenosides, and the antifeedant activities of total ginsenosides, PDS, and PTS against the 3rd instar larvae were time and dose-dependent, with higher activities at 48 h. 100 mg/ml PDS had relative higher antifeedant activity (88.39 ± 3.43% in no-choice and 80.9±4.36% in choice) than total ginsenosides and PTS at all time intervals, except at 48 h in no-choice test. In further experiments, we found PPD ginsenosides (Rb1, Rb2, Rc, and Rd) had relative higher time and dose dependent antifeedant activities than PPT ginsenosides (Re and Rg1).Our results suggested the insecticidal action of total ginsenosides, PDS, and PTS on O. furnacalis.

Intriguingly, their potential as cAMP-dependent signal transducers remains uncharacterized. We recently reported that type I PKA regulatory subunits (RIα) interact with phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate–dependent Rac exchange factor 1 (P-REX1), a chemotactic Rac guanine exchange factor (RacGEF). Because P-REX1 is known to be phosphorylated and inhibited by PKA, its interaction with RIα suggests that PKA regulatory and catalytic subunits may fine-tune P-REX1 activity or those of its target pools.

In the inactive PKA holoenzyme, the intrinsic kinase activities of the catalytic subunits are inhibited by their association with regulatory subunits.

This surprising finding is an outgrowth of the same laboratory’s prior study, which used a yeast 2-hybrid screen to demonstrate that a fragment of P-REX1 containing two PDZ domains (P-REX1–PDZ1–PDZ2) acted as “bait” to capture its “prey,” which corresponded to a C-terminal fragment of PKA-RIα (3Chávez-Vargas L.

However, this is not the case for pull-downs performed using beads to which the cAMP antagonist (Rp)-8-AHA–cAMPS is immobilized. Importantly, (Rp)-8-AHA–cAMPS binds PKA-RIα assembled within the PKA holoenzyme, but fails to reproduce the action of natural cAMP to liberate PKA-RIα upon holoenzyme dissociation. Thus, P-REX1 most likely binds to free PKA-RIα generated as a consequence of cAMP-induced holoenzyme dissociation.

Using HEK293 cells transfected with a CNBD-B–R335K PKA-RIα mutant that is insensitive to cAMP, it is reported that unlike wild-type PKA-RIα, this mutant interacts with P-REX1 in a pull-down assay using P-REX1–PDZ1–PDZ2 as the bait (1Adame-García S.R.

Because this assay is performed using cells not treated with cAMP, the CNBD-B–R335K mutation might result in a binding gain-of-function that supports a cAMP-independent interaction of P-REX1 and PKA-RIα. However, additional functional assays demonstrate that the mutant PKA-RIα does not support P-REX1 activation in the absence of added cAMP (1Adame-García S.R. Cervantes-Villagrana R.D.

Therefore, for wild-type PKA-RIα, it seems likely that binding of cAMP to CNBD-B is in fact necessary for stimulated P-REX1 GEF activity. Findings obtained using mutant Δ366–379 PKA-RIα that is missing 14 amino acids in the C-tail of CNBD-B further illuminate the role that cAMP plays as a determinant of P-REX1 GEF activity. This mutant is cAMP-insensitive, and it is designated as ACRO because it is found in patients with acrodysostosis (ACRDYS) skeletal dysplasia. For HEK293 cells not treated with cAMP, the ACRO mutant binds strongly to P-REX1–PDZ1–PDZ2 (1Adame-García S.R. Cervantes-Villagrana R.D. Orduña-Castillo L.B. del Rio J.C. Gutkind J.S. Reyes-Cruz G.

The author’s explanation for these findings is that the Δ366–379 truncation of CNBD-B alters its C-tail structure so that it binds to and constitutively activates P-REX1 (1Adame-García S.R.

Thus, the overall findings provide a new paradigm by which cAMP exerts a nonconventional action to control cellular function. How is it possible to explain the seemingly paradoxical opposing actions of PKA to either enhance GEF activity through direct binding of PKA-RIα to P-REX1 or to instead down-regulate GEF activity through phosphorylation of P-REX1?

This would mean that opposing PKA catalytic subunit activity phosphorylates P-REX1 so that it is sequestered in an inactive state that must be dephosphorylated before it can be directly activated by PKA-RIα (Fig. 1). Thus, there is cycling of P-REX1 between nonphospho and phospho states so that the balance of this cycling dictates up- or down-regulation of P-REX1 GEF activity in response to increased levels of cAMP (1Adame-García S.R. Cervantes-Villagrana R.D. Orduña-Castillo L.B. del Rio J.C. Gutkind J.S. Reyes-Cruz G. Taylor S.S.

Potentially, this pool of P-REX1 is under tight regulatory control by Ser/Thr protein phosphatases localized within cytosolic microdomains that maintain P-REX1 in its unphosphorylated state so that it can be directly activated by PKA-RIα (Fig. 1). A critically important question that remains to be determined is whether this new and nonconventional model of PKA-RIα action can generally be applied to other forms of cAMP signaling that are PKA-mediated. More speculatively, there may exist intricate signal transduction cross-talk in which G protein–coupled receptors and/or growth factor receptors modulate cAMP-dependent control of P-REX1. In fact, P-REX1 GEF activity is already established to be under the control of G protein βγ subunits, PIP3, and mTOR signaling pathways (2Welch H.C.

https://openalex.org/W2912392894,"Background A hospitalized-based cohort study suggested that elevated C-reactive protein (CRP) levels are associated with radiographic sacroiliitis progression in ankylosing spondylitis (AS) patients. However, data from community-based populations are limited. Objective We sought to determine the association between elevated CRP levels and AS diagnosis in a prospective community-based study of 129,681 Chinese adults over a follow-up period of 8 years. Methods We measured the plasma CRP concentration at baseline and every 2 years thereafter with the high-sensitivity (hs)-CRP test. Incident AS cases were confirmed on the basis of modified New York diagnostic criteria after review of medical records. We used Cox proportional-hazard models to calculate hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs) for AS on the basis of hs-CRP concentrations, adjusting for age, sex, education, income, cigarette smoking, alcohol intake, physical activity, body mass index, blood-pressure status, blood glucose status, total cholesterol, history of cardiovascular disease, and use of antihypertensives, lipid-lowering agents, and aspirin. Results During 1,033,609 person-years (average 7.97 ± 1.36 years per person) of follow-up, we identified 55 incident AS cases. Baseline hs-CRP was positively associated with the risk of future AS. Compared with hs-CRP <1 mg/L, the HR was 1.28 (95% CI 0.54–3.08) for hs-CRP of 1.00–2.99 mg/L, 4.71 (95% CI 2.26–9.81) for hs-CRP of 3.00–9.99 mg/L, and 19.8 (95% CI 9.6–40.9) for hs-CRP ≥10.00 mg/L (P-trend <0.001) after adjustment for potential confounders. We found similar results after excluding AS cases that occurred in the first 2 years of follow-up, and using the cumulative average hs-CRP concentration as a predictor. Conclusion This is the first study in a community-based cohort to demonstrate that CRP plasma concentrations predict the risk of future AS, thus providing a test that is easy to routinely perform in the clinic to assess for AS risk."
https://openalex.org/W2913649332,"Published compact and extended models of the glucose-insulin physiologic control system are compared, in order to understand why a specific functional form of the compact model proved to be necessary for a satisfactory representation of acute perturbation experiments such as the Intra Venous Glucose Tolerance Test (IVGTT). A spectrum of IVGTT's of virtual subjects ranging from normal to IFG to IGT to frank T2DM were simulated using an extended model incorporating the population-of-controllers paradigm originally hypothesized by Grodsky, and proven to be able to capture a wide array of experimental results from heterogeneous perturbation procedures. The simulated IVGTT's were then fitted with the Single-Delay Model (SDM), a compact model with only six free parameters, previously shown to be very effective in delivering precise estimates of insulin sensitivity and secretion during an IVGTT. Comparison of the generating, extended-model parameter values with the obtained compact model estimates shows that the functional form of the nonlinear insulin-secretion term, empirically found to be necessary for the compact model to satisfactorily fit clinical observations, captures the pancreatic reserve level of the simulated virtual patients. This result supports the validity of the compact model as a meaningful analysis tool for the clinical assessment of insulin sensitivity."
https://openalex.org/W2912286817,"Purpose This study aims to describe factors associated to treatment continuity and psychiatric relapses in patients treated with Long Acting Injectable antipsychotics (LAIs) in Bologna Community Mental Health Centers (CMHCs). Methods New LAI treatments administered between July 1, 2010 and June 30, 2015 in CMHCs were selected. The cohort was followed-up for 6 months; predictors of continuity and psychiatric admissions were investigated by using logistic regression- and Cox- analysis respectively. Results Among the cohort of 1 070 patients, only 222 (21%) continued LAI treatment during the follow-up. LAI continuity was higher with first generation agents (OR: 1.71, 95%CI 1.18–2.49) and in case of previous psychiatric hospitalizations (OR 2.00, 95%CI 1.47–2.74). Incidence of psychiatric hospital admissions showed a sharp reduction in the follow-up compared with 6-month period before initiation (from 458 to 212), and was associated with previous psychiatric hospitalizations (HR 3.20, 95%CI 2.22–4.59), immigration (HR 3.13, 95%CI 1.28–7.69) and LAI discontinuation (HR 1.14, 95%Cl 1.01–1.97). Conclusions Psychiatric hospital admission before LAI initiation was the main predictor both of LAI continuity and hospitalization during the follow-up."
https://openalex.org/W2912522977,"In economics, models of decision-making under risk are widely investigated. Since many empirical studies have shown patterns in choice behavior that classical models fail to predict, several descriptive theories have been developed. Due to an evident phenotypic heterogeneity, obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD) patients have shown a general deficit in decision making when compared to healthy control subjects (HCs). However, the direction for impairment in decision-making in OCD patients is still unclear. Hence, bridging decision-making models widely used in the economic literature with mental health research may improve the understanding of preference relations in severe patients, and may enhance intervention designs. We investigate the behavior of OCD patients with respect to HCs by means of decision making economic models within a typical neuropsychological setting, such as the Cambridge Gambling Task. In this task subjects have to decide the amount of their initial wealth to invest in each risky decision. To account for heterogenous preferences, we have analyzed the micro-level data for a more informative analysis of the choices made by the subjects. We consider two influential models in economics: the expected value (EV), which assumes risk neutrality, and a multiple reference points model, an alternative formulation of Disappointment theory. We find evidence that (medicated) OCD patients are more consistent with EV than HCs. The former appear to be more risk neutral, namely, less sensitive to risk than HCs. They also seem to base their decisions on disappointment avoidance less than HCs."
https://openalex.org/W2913288155,"Current efforts to assess human health response to chemicals based on high-throughput in vitro assay data on intra-cellular changes have been hindered for some illnesses by lack of information on higher-level extracellular, inter-organ, and organism-level interactions. However, a dose-response function (DRF), informed by various levels of information including apical health response, can represent a template for convergent top-down, bottom-up analysis. In this paper, a general DRF for chronic chemical and other health stressors and mixtures is derived based on a general first-order model previously derived and demonstrated for illness progression. The derivation accounts for essential autocorrelation among initiating event magnitudes along a toxicological mode of action, typical of complex processes in general, and reveals the inverse relationship between the minimum illness-inducing dose, and the illness severity per unit dose (both variable across a population). The resulting emergent DRF is theoretically scale-inclusive and amenable to low-dose extrapolation. The two-parameter single-toxicant version can be monotonic or sigmoidal, and is demonstrated preferable to traditional models (multistage, lognormal, generalized linear) for the published cancer and non-cancer datasets analyzed: chloroform (induced liver necrosis in female mice); bromate (induced dysplastic focia in male inbred rats); and 2-acetylaminofluorene (induced liver neoplasms and bladder carcinomas in 20,328 female mice). Common- and dissimilar-mode mixture models are demonstrated versus orthogonal data on toluene/benzene mixtures (mortality in Japanese medaka, Oryzias latipes, following embryonic exposure). Findings support previous empirical demonstration, and also reveal how a chemical with a typical monotonically-increasing DRF can display a J-shaped DRF when a second, antagonistic common-mode chemical is present. Overall, the general DRF derived here based on an autocorrelated first-order model appears to provide both a strong theoretical/biological basis for, as well as an accurate statistical description of, a diverse, albeit small, sample of observed dose-response data. The further generalizability of this conclusion can be tested in future analyses comparing with traditional modeling approaches across a broader range of datasets."
https://openalex.org/W2913711386,"Comparisons of physical fitness measures between children or within group measures over time are potentially confounded by differences in body size. We compared measures of strength (handgrip) and aerobic fitness (running-speed [20m shuttle-run]) of 10.0–15.9 year-olds from Dar es Salaam, Tanzania (n = 977) with schoolchildren from England (n = 1014) matched for age and sex. Differences in fitness were analyzed using general linear models, with allometric scaling for body size (mass and stature) and further adjustments for physical activity. Mean handgrip of Tanzanians was lower than English youth (F = 165.0, P<0.001, ηp2 = .079). The difference became trivial when run-speed was scaled for body size (ηp2 = .008). Running-speed of the English children was higher than in Tanzanians (F = 16.0, P<0.001, ηp2 = .014). Allometric scaling for accentuated this between-county difference in running-speed (ηp2 = .019) but when adjusted for physical activity between-country differences in running-speed were trivial (ηp2 = .008). These data contradict those studies showing poor muscular fitness in African youth and highlight the need for appropriate scaling techniques to avoid confounding by differences in body size. In contrast to those from rural areas, our sample of contemporary urban Tanzanians were less aerobically fit than European youth. Differences were independent of body size. Lower aerobic fitness of urban Tanzanian youth may be due to reported physical activity levels lower than those of English youth and lower still than previously reported in rural Tanzania."

https://openalex.org/W2914159149,"It has been an exciting and productive conference. As a fifth-year Ph.D. student, I am less nervous when I present my work than I used to be, and I finally feel I fit in as a scholar. But when my abstract was accepted in the fall, I had to consider something completely unrelated to my science: whether I could afford to go. Carefully, I did the math. Registration, fees, air travel, lodging, and food would exceed $1000. My fellowship comes with $1200 that I can use for conference travel, among other project-related expenses. On top of that, the conference granted my presentation a $500 travel award. I should be able to cover the costs—eventually.

> “I incur these expenses in a sometimes-scary bet against [my] bank account.” 

I can't access these funds until after the conference, long after paying for registration and flights. So, for the past 3 months, I have been out a significant chunk of cash. This is money that I can't really spare, as most of my modest graduate stipend goes to day-to-day necessities—including food, housing, and utilities. I'll submit my reimbursement forms as soon as possible once I get home. But I know from experience that sometimes payments are extremely delayed, even after the forms are filed. All I can do is hope the process will go smoothly this time—and know that I'll have to advocate for myself and micromanage every step if it doesn't.

Still, I count myself luckier than some. I can draw on savings I was able to build up while I was in college. I attended a budget-conscious institution in my home state, cobbled together scholarship funds to cover my tuition and fees without help from my parents, lived in cheap apartments, and worked multiple jobs so that I could save. That means that these days, though sometimes I have to get creative, I can generally make conference expenses work. But I incur these expenses in a sometimes-scary bet against the bank account I use to pay my rent and keep my apartment warm.

Requiring students to ante up conference funds up front without the hope of being reimbursed for months makes academia less welcoming for scientists who are financially disadvantaged. Yet universities and funding agencies seem unwilling or unable to do much to change the system. Perhaps changing the status quo requires too much work. Maybe it's not a priority because many students come from privileged backgrounds that insulate them from the issue. Students for whom this is a real problem may feel ashamed to ask for help and be treated as an exception.

I've tried to work with administrators to find reasonable solutions, but the results have been mixed at best. Last summer, for example, I had the opportunity to attend a prestigious weeklong conference, supported by a competitive grant. But, as always, all funds were due up front at registration. Assuming the financial and psychological burden of these expenses—thousands of dollars—felt like more than I could take on, especially after already putting in substantial time and intellectual effort to secure the grant.

After negotiating with administrators, I thought I came up with a solution. The granting institution set up an account with the hospital that housed my lab so that I could pay my expenses directly with the funds I had been awarded. But when I tried to register for the conference, I hit an unexpected snag: All payments needed to be made by credit card. I nearly cried. Embarrassingly, the balance due exceeded my card's limit. After some desperate emails, an administrator agreed to extend the credit line on an existing department card so that I could use it. But she made sure I understood that this was not something they normally did and that I shouldn't make a habit of these types of requests.

As for my most recent conference expenses, I was relieved to find out a few weeks ago that I'd receive a check for my $500 travel grant on site at the conference. I probably won't receive my reimbursement for the rest of the conference expenses until April (assuming all goes well). Until then, I'm gearing up to devote a significant amount of mental energy to keeping a careful eye on my bank account and credit cards.
