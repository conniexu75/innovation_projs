https://openalex.org/W2005307596,"For the past three centuries, the effects of humans on the global environment have escalated. Because of these anthro-pogenic emissions of carbon dioxide, global climate may depart significantly from natural behaviour for many millennia to come. It seems appropriate to assign the term ‘Anthropocene’ to the present, in many ways human-dominated, geological epoch, supplementing the Holocene—the warm period of the past 10–12 millennia."
https://openalex.org/W2159226773,"The number of steps any classical computer requires in order to find the prime factors of an $l$-digit integer $N$ increases exponentially with $l$, at least using algorithms known at present. Factoring large integers is therefore conjectured to be intractable classically, an observation underlying the security of widely used cryptographic codes. Quantum computers, however, could factor integers in only polynomial time, using Shor's quantum factoring algorithm. Although important for the study of quantum computers, experimental demonstration of this algorithm has proved elusive. Here we report an implementation of the simplest instance of Shor's algorithm: factorization of ${N=15}$ (whose prime factors are 3 and 5). We use seven spin-1/2 nuclei in a molecule as quantum bits, which can be manipulated with room temperature liquid state nuclear magnetic resonance techniques. This method of using nuclei to store quantum information is in principle scalable to many quantum bit systems, but such scalability is not implied by the present work. The significance of our work lies in the demonstration of experimental and theoretical techniques for precise control and modelling of complex quantum computers. In particular, we present a simple, parameter-free but predictive model of decoherence effects in our system."
https://openalex.org/W1990113288,"Inappropriate or prolonged inflammation is the main cause of many diseases; for this reason it is important to understand the physiological mechanisms that terminate inflammation in vivo. Agonists for several Gs-protein-coupled receptors, including cell-surface adenosine purinergic receptors, can increase levels of immunosuppressive cyclic AMP in immune cells; however, it was unknown whether any of these receptors regulates inflammation in vivo. Here we show that A2a adenosine receptors have a non-redundant role in the attenuation of inflammation and tissue damage in vivo. Sub-threshold doses of an inflammatory stimulus that caused minimal tissue damage in wild-type mice were sufficient to induce extensive tissue damage, more prolonged and higher levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines, and death of male animals deficient in the A2a adenosine receptor. Similar observations were made in studies of three different models of inflammation and liver damage as well as during bacterial endotoxin-induced septic shock. We suggest that A2a adenosine receptors are a critical part of the physiological negative feedback mechanism for limitation and termination of both tissue-specific and systemic inflammatory responses."

These channels are believed to be involved in many physiological processes that include renal water conservation, neuro-homeostasis, digestion, regulation of body temperature and reproduction. Members of the water channel superfamily have been found in a range of cell types from bacteria to human. In mammals, there are currently 10 families of water channels, referred to as aquaporins (AQP): AQP0–AQP9. Here we report the structure of the aquaporin 1 (AQP1) water channel to 2.2 Å resolution. The channel consists of three topological elements, an extracellular and a cytoplasmic vestibule connected by an extended narrow pore or selectivity filter. Within the selectivity filter, four bound waters are localized along three hydrophilic nodes, which punctuate an otherwise extremely hydrophobic pore segment. This unusual combination of a long hydrophobic pore and a minimal number of solute binding sites facilitates rapid water transport. Residues of the constriction region, in particular histidine 182, which is conserved among all known water-specific channels, are critical in establishing water specificity. Our analysis of the AQP1 pore also indicates that the transport of protons through this channel is highly energetically unfavourable."

https://openalex.org/W1976122633,"The genetic and molecular basis of morphological evolution is poorly understood, particularly in vertebrates. Genetic studies of the differences between naturally occurring vertebrate species have been limited by the expense and difficulty of raising large numbers of animals and the absence of molecular linkage maps for all but a handful of laboratory and domesticated animals. We have developed a genome-wide linkage map for the three-spined stickleback (Gasterosteus aculeatus), an extensively studied teleost fish that has undergone rapid divergence and speciation since the melting of glaciers 15,000 years ago1. Here we use this map to analyse the genetic basis of recently evolved changes in skeletal armour and feeding morphologies seen in the benthic and limnetic stickleback species from Priest Lake, British Columbia. Substantial alterations in spine length, armour plate number, and gill raker number are controlled by genetic factors that map to independent chromosome regions. Further study of these regions will help to define the number and type of genetic changes that underlie morphological diversification during vertebrate evolution."
https://openalex.org/W2118392371,"Drought and high salinity induce the expression of many plant genes. To understand the signal transduction mechanisms underlying the activation of these genes, we carried out a genetic screen to isolate Arabidopsis mutants defective in osmotic stress-regulated gene induction. Here we report the isolation, characterization, and cloning of a mutation, los6, which diminished osmotic stress activation of a reporter gene. RNA blot analysis indicates that under osmotic stress the transcript levels for stress-responsive genes such as RD29A, COR15A,KIN1, COR47, RD19, andADH are lower in los6 plants than in wild type plants. los6 plants were found to have reduced phytohormone abscisic acid (ABA) accumulation and to be allelic to the ABA-deficient mutant, aba1. LOS6/ABA1 encodes a zeaxanthin epoxidase that functions in ABA biosynthesis. Its expression is enhanced by osmotic stress. Furthermore, we found that there exists a positive feedback regulation by ABA on the expression of LOS6/ABA1, which may underscore a quick adaptation strategy for plants under osmotic stress. Similar positive regulation by ABA also exists for other ABA biosynthesis genes AAO3 and LOS5/ABA3 and in certain genetic backgrounds, NCED3. This feedback regulation by ABA is impaired in the ABA-insensitive mutantabi1 but not in abi2. Moreover, the up-regulation of LOS6/ABA1, LOS5/ABA3,AAO3, and NCED3 by osmotic stress is reduced substantially in ABA-deficient mutants. Transgenic plants overexpressing LOS6/ABA1 showed an increasedRD29A-LUC expression under osmotic stress. These results suggest that the level of gene induction by osmotic stress is dependent on the dosage of the zeaxanthin epoxidase enzyme.

In this approach, Arabidopsisplants expressing the firefly luciferase gene under the control of the stress- and ABA-responsive RD29A promoter were used to screen for mutants with altered gene regulation by osmotic stress, cold, and/or ABA. In this report, we describe the isolation, cloning, and characterization of a mutation isolated in this screen. This mutation was designated as los6 (for low expression of osmotic stress-responsive genes6). Compared with wild type plants, los6 mutant plants exhibit reduced luminescence induction by osmotic stress.los6 plants were found to be ABA-deficient. Genetic analysis and cloning indicated that LOS6 is allelic toABA1 and encodes a zeaxanthin epoxidase (ZEP). Analysis ofLOS6/ABA1 gene expression reveals a very intriguing phenomenon (i.e. the expression ofLOS6/ABA1 is significantly enhanced by exogenous ABA). Importantly, in los6 mutant plants, osmotic stress up-regulation of LOS6/ABA1 is reduced severalfold, whereas the expression level under ABA treatment is similar to that of the wild type. We found similar regulation of two other ABA biosynthesis genes LOS5/ABA3 andAAO3 by ABA. These observations uncover a positive feedback loop in the regulation of expression of ABA biosynthesis genes. In addition, we found that ABA regulation of ABA biosynthesis genes is partially impaired in the ABA-insensitive mutant abi1 but not in abi2. In addition, we show that overexpression ofLOS6 leads to increased gene induction by osmotic stress.

https://openalex.org/W2092105439,"The much-studied Murchison meteorite is generally used as the standard reference for organic compounds in extraterrestrial material. Amino acids and other organic compounds important in contemporary biochemistry are thought to have been delivered to the early Earth by asteroids and comets, where they may have played a role in the origin of life. Polyhydroxylated compounds (polyols) such as sugars, sugar alcohols and sugar acids are vital to all known lifeforms-they are components of nucleic acids (RNA, DNA), cell membranes and also act as energy sources. But there has hitherto been no conclusive evidence for the existence of polyols in meteorites, leaving a gap in our understanding of the origins of biologically important organic compounds on Earth. Here we report that a variety of polyols are present in, and indigenous to, the Murchison and Murray meteorites in amounts comparable to amino acids. Analyses of water extracts indicate that extraterrestrial processes including photolysis and formaldehyde chemistry could account for the observed compounds. We conclude from this that polyols were present on the early Earth and therefore at least available for incorporation into the first forms of life."

https://openalex.org/W2005861641,"The muscular work of galloping in horses is halved by storing and returning elastic strain energy in spring-like muscle-tendon units.These make the legs act like a child's pogo stick that is tuned to stretch and recoil at 2.5 strides per second. This mechanism is optimized by unique musculoskeletal adaptations: the digital flexor muscles have extremely short fibres and significant passive properties, whereas the tendons are very long and span several joints. Length change occurs by a stretching of the spring-like digital flexor tendons rather than through energetically expensive length changes in the muscle. Despite being apparently redundant for such a mechanism, the muscle fibres in the digital flexors are well developed. Here we show that the mechanical arrangement of the elastic leg permits it to vibrate at a higher frequency of 30-40 Hz that could cause fatigue damage to tendon and bone. Furthermore, we show that the digital flexor muscles have minimal ability to contribute to or regulate significantly the 2.5-Hz cycle of movement, but are ideally arranged to damp these high-frequency oscillations in the limb."

Under normal physiological conditions, AF2 binding of the NH2-terminal FXXLF motif is favored over binding the LXXLL motifs of p160 coactivators, which likely contributes to the weak AR AF2 transcriptional activity in mammalian cells (7He B.

GAL4 peptide fusion plasmids were created using two complementary oligonucleotides that were phosphorylated by T4 polynucleotide kinase, denatured, annealed at room temperature, and cloned at NdeI/XbaI in pGAL0. Oligonucleotides coding for the FXXLF or LXXLL motifs typically contained coding sequence for 7 additional flanking amino acids, with peptides ranging in size from 11 to 21 amino acids.

Human hepatocellular carcinoma HepG2 cells (American Type Culture Collection) were maintained in 5% CO2 at 37 °C in Eagle's minimum essential medium (Invitrogen) containing 10% fetal bovine serum (Hyclone), 0.1 mm nonessential amino acids, 1 mm sodium pyruvate, 2 mml-glutamine, and penicillin/streptomycin. For peptide interaction assays, HepG2 cells were plated at 2 × 105 cells/well of 12-multiwell tissue culture plates. The next day medium was exchanged with 0.8 ml of fresh culture medium. DNA for transfection was prepared for 4 wells each following the Effectene protocol (Qiagen). Wild-type or mutant pCMVhAR, pCMVhGR, VP16PRA, or VP16-ERα-LBD (0.05 μg) or VPAR507–919 (0.15 μg) was combined with 0.05 μg of GAL4-peptide DNA/well and 0.1 μg of 5XGAL4Luc3/well in 75 μl of EC buffer/well, 1 μl of enhancer/well, 1 μl of Effectene/well, and 0.4 ml of media/well, and 400 μl was added to the plates. The next day cells were washed in phosphate-buffered saline and the media replaced with serum-free medium lacking phenol red. Hormones were added as indicated, and cells were incubated overnight at 37 °C. The next day cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline and harvested in 220 μl of lysis buffer (25 mm Tris phosphate, pH 7.8, 2 mm EDTA, 1% Triton X-100), and 0.1 ml was analyzed using a Monolight 2010 (Analytical Luminescence Laboratories) or LumiStar Galaxy (BMG Labtechnologies) luminometer. Human epithelioid cervical carcinoma HeLa cells were maintained in Eagle's minimum essential medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and 2 mml-glutamine and penicillin/streptomycin. HeLa cells (3.5 × 105cells/6-cm dish) were transfected using Effectene as described above except using 0.25 μg each of VPAR507–919, GAL4-peptide, and 5XGAL4Luc3, 150 μl of EC buffer/plate, and 4 μl each of enhancer and Effectene/plate in 1 ml of media were added to plates containing 3 ml of fresh media.

GST fusion proteins were expressed in XL1-Blue Escherichia coli cells treated with 0.5 mm isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside for 3 h after log phase growth. Bacteria were sonicated in 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm EDTA, 0.1 m NaCl, 0.02m Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, centrifuged, and the supernatant was incubated with glutathione-agarose beads (Amersham Biosciences, Inc.) for 1 h at 4 °C (7He B.

In vitro translated proteins were labeled with 25 μCi of [35S]methionine (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) using the TNT T7 Quick Coupled Transcription/Translation System (Promega) in the presence and absence of 1 μm DHT. Beads were centrifuged, washed five times, and boiled in SDS. Input lanes contained ∼10% of that used for the binding reactions. Transient transcriptional activity of wild-type and mutant AR was determined in the presence and absence of cotransfecting expression vectors for the putative AR coactivators.

Dissociation half-times of [3H]R1881 (methyltrienolone, 70–87 Ci/mmol, PerkinElmer Life Sciences) from AR were determined at 37 °C in monkey kidney COS-1 cells using 4 × 105 cells/well in 6-well plates transfected with 2 μg of wild-type or mutant pCMVhAR DNA/well using DEAE-dextran (19He B.

Cells were incubated for 2 h at 37 °C with 5 nm [3H]R1881 in the presence and absence of a 100-fold excess unlabeled R1881.

Relative expression levels of the GAL4-peptide fusion proteins were determined by immunoblot analysis. COS-1 cells (1.2 × 106 cells/10-cm dish) were transfected using the Effectene kit protocol. On the 2nd day, 8 ml of medium was added to each plate, and the DNA was suspended in 0.3 ml of EC buffer (Qiagen). The DNA for each plate was combined with 16 μl of enhancer and 10 μl of Effectene reagent and added to the cells in 1 ml of medium. Peptide detection by immunoblot was increased by the addition of 1 μm MG132 (Sigma), a proteosome inhibitor, 24 h prior to cell harvest. Addition of MG132 did not significantly alter the interaction assay results. Nuclear extracts of transfected COS cells were prepared as described previously (30Schreiber E. Matthias P. Muller M.M. Schaffner W. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 176419Crossref PubMed Scopus (3918) Google Scholar). Protein concentrations were determined using the Bio-Rad protein assay with bovine serum albumin as standard. Proteins (10 μg) were separated on 12% acrylamide gels containing SDS, and the GAL4-peptide fusion proteins were detected using the anti-GAL4-DNA binding domain monoclonal antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.). Previous studies in our laboratory showed that the AF2 region of the AR ligand binding domain binds preferentially in the presence of androgen an AR NH2-terminal FXXLF motif (23FQNLF27) compared with the LXXLL motifs of the p160 coactivators (18He B.

In each case the FXXLF sequences are in regions selected previously by yeast two-hybrid screens. Regions of the recruited fragments (underlined) and the position and sequence of the FXXLF motif regions are shown in Fig.1. Interaction of the AR coactivator FXXLF motifs with the AR ligand binding domain was tested in the absence and presence of 10 nm DHT using two-hybrid peptide assays (29Chang C. Norris J.D. Gron H. Paige L.A. Hamilton P.T. Kenan D.J. Fowlkes D. McDonnell D.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 8226-8239Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) in HeLa or HepG2 cells with GAL4-peptide fusions. Expression of the GAL4-peptide fusions was verified on immunoblots of nuclear extracts from cells treated for 24 h with MG132, a proteosome inhibitor (Fig.2 A). Results are shown for COS cell expression, but similar results were obtained using HeLa cells. Peptide detection in both cases required the addition of MG132, but treatment with MG132 did not alter the interaction results (data not shown). Androgen-dependent interactions were detected which increased luciferase activity by 8–48-fold in two-hybrid assays between VPAR507–919 (AR DNA and ligand binding domain) and the GAL4-FXXLF fusion peptides with sequences from AR (GAL-AR-(16–36)), ARA54 (GAL-ARA54-(447–465)), and ARA70 (GAL-ARA70-(321–340)) (Fig. 2 B). Mutation of FXXLF to FXXAA in GAL-AR-(16–36) eliminated the interaction based on loss of luciferase activity in the two-hybrid assay (Fig. 2 B). The results indicate a requirement for the FXXLF binding motif in the AR-interacting peptide. Decreasing the size of the AR FXXLF peptide sequence from residues 16–36 to 20–30 increased the magnitude of the interaction of the GAL4-AR-FXXLF peptide, with luciferase activity increasing from 8- to 31-fold in the two-hybrid assay (Fig.2 B). This result provided the first indication that amino acid residues flanking the AR FXXLF sequence influence the interaction with AF2. No interaction was observed in the two-hybrid peptide assay using either of the two GAL-ARA55-FXXLF peptides, providing further evidence that sequences within and flanking the FXXLF motif influence the extent of binding. Similarly, no luciferase activity resulted from any of the GAL-peptides alone because there was no transcriptional activity detected in the absence of androgen (see Figs. 2, B and C, and3). In a positive control, we observed an 84-fold DHT-dependent interaction with a GAL-D11-FXXLF peptide (D11FX). The D11 peptide contains an LXXLL motif that interacts with AR (29Chang C. Norris J.D.

Interaction was also detected between VPAR507–919 and the third LXXLL motif sequence of TIF2 but not with the second LXXLL motif (Fig. 2 B).Figure 3Interaction of coactivator fragments with AR.

Data shown are representative of three independent experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To investigate further the interactions of the FXXLF motif sequences, the two-hybrid assay was performed in HepG2 cells using full-length AR instead of the DNA and ligand binding domain fragment. Each of the GAL4-FXXLF peptides with sequence derived from AR, ARA70, ARA54, and the D11-FXXLF peptide interacted with the AR, with an increase in luciferase activity of 35–228-fold (Fig.2 C). No interaction or background activity was observed using AR and the empty GAL0 vector control or when the GAL-AR-(16–36)-FXXLF sequence was mutated to FXXAA (Fig. 2 C). In this assay there were weaker interactions detected with the GAL-ARA55 fusion peptides containing the first or second FXXLF sequence. The third LXXLL motif of TIF2 in residues 738–756 increased luciferase activity in the two-hybrid assay by 3-fold, whereas again, no interac"
https://openalex.org/W1990863079,"The transcription factor c-Myb is subject to several types of post-translational modifications, including phosphorylation, acetylation, and ubiquitination. These modifications regulate the transcription and transforming activity as well as the proteolytic stability of c-Myb. Here we report the covalent modification of c-Myb with the small ubiquitin-related protein SUMO-1. Mutational analysis identified two major sumolation sites (Lys499 and Lys523) in the negative regulatory domain. Interestingly, the single mutation K523R completely abolished modification of c-Myb with SUMO-1, suggesting that sumolation of Lys523 is required for modification of other lysines in c-Myb. In accordance with this observation, we found that the SUMO-1-conjugating enzyme Ubc9 interacted only with a region surrounding Lys523 (also called the PEST/EVES motif). Experiments aimed at determining the proteolytic stability of sumolated and unmodified forms of c-Myb revealed that at least two covalently attached SUMO-1 molecules dramatically increased the stability of c-Myb. However, mutations of the SUMO-1 modification sites did not alter its stability, suggesting that a mechanism(s) other than competition of ubiquitin and SUMO-1 for the same lysine is involved in the stabilization of sumolated c-Myb protein. Finally, the K523R mutant of c-Myb, entirely deficient in sumolation, was shown to have an increased transactivation capacity on a Myb-responsive promoter, suggesting that SUMO-1 negatively regulates the transactivation function of c-Myb. Thus, modification of c-Myb with SUMO-1 represents a novel mechanism through which the negative regulatory domain can exert its suppressing activity on c-Myb transactivation capacity. The transcription factor c-Myb is subject to several types of post-translational modifications, including phosphorylation, acetylation, and ubiquitination. These modifications regulate the transcription and transforming activity as well as the proteolytic stability of c-Myb. Here we report the covalent modification of c-Myb with the small ubiquitin-related protein SUMO-1. Mutational analysis identified two major sumolation sites (Lys499 and Lys523) in the negative regulatory domain. Interestingly, the single mutation K523R completely abolished modification of c-Myb with SUMO-1, suggesting that sumolation of Lys523 is required for modification of other lysines in c-Myb. In accordance with this observation, we found that the SUMO-1-conjugating enzyme Ubc9 interacted only with a region surrounding Lys523 (also called the PEST/EVES motif). Experiments aimed at determining the proteolytic stability of sumolated and unmodified forms of c-Myb revealed that at least two covalently attached SUMO-1 molecules dramatically increased the stability of c-Myb. However, mutations of the SUMO-1 modification sites did not alter its stability, suggesting that a mechanism(s) other than competition of ubiquitin and SUMO-1 for the same lysine is involved in the stabilization of sumolated c-Myb protein. Finally, the K523R mutant of c-Myb, entirely deficient in sumolation, was shown to have an increased transactivation capacity on a Myb-responsive promoter, suggesting that SUMO-1 negatively regulates the transactivation function of c-Myb. Thus, modification of c-Myb with SUMO-1 represents a novel mechanism through which the negative regulatory domain can exert its suppressing activity on c-Myb transactivation capacity. negative regulatory domain small ubiquitin-related modifier-1 glutathione S-transferase The c-Myb transcription factor is a nuclear phosphoprotein that has an important function in the regulation of proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis of immature hematopoietic cells (1Oh I.H. Reddy E.P. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 3017-3033Crossref PubMed Scopus (420) Google Scholar). The critical role of c-Myb in normal hematopoiesis was most convincingly shown in a knockout experiment in which homozygous mutation of c-myb was embryonically lethal (2Mucenski M.L McLain K.

It was originally identified as a transforming gene through its truncated versions v-myb and v-myb-ets, which were transcribed from two avian viruses, avian myeloblastosis virus and E26, respectively. Oncogenic v-Myb suffers several mutations and truncations at both the amino and carboxyl termini compared with its endogenous cellular c-Myb counterpart (3Wolff L. Crit. Rev. Oncog. 1996; 7: 245-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 4Lipsick J.S. Wang D.M. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 3047-3055Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Oncogenic activation of c-myb can also be achieved in animal models following integration of replication-competitive retroviruses into the c-myb locus. This results in removal of either the amino- or carboxyl-terminal portions of c-Myb, and many experiments have shown that these lesions contribute to the increased oncogenicity of the mutant form (3Wolff L. Crit. Rev. Oncog. 1996; 7: 245-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). The c-Myb protein is composed of three functional domains: an amino-terminal DNA-binding domain, a central transactivation domain, and a carboxyl-terminal negative regulatory domain (4Lipsick J.S. Wang D.M. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 3047-3055Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). c-Myb binds specifically to DNA through a DNA-binding domain that recognizes the consensus sequence 5′-PyAAC(G/T)G-3′ (5Biedenkapp H.

Cell. 1989; 58: 85-93Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar) interacts with the coactivator CBP, a histone acetyltransferase that can bridge c-Myb to the basal transcription machinery of RNA polymerase II (8Dai P.

Schreek S. Luscher B. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 2771-2780Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). The transactivation and transforming activities of Myb are modulated through the negative regulatory domain (NRD)1 (10Sakura H. Kanei-Ishii C. Nagase T. Nakagoshi H. Gonda T.J. Ishii S. Proc. Natl.

Post-translational modifications such as phosphorylation, acetylation, and ubiquitination play an important role in the regulation of c-Myb activity and proteolytic stability (16Luscher B.

Acetylation of several lysine residues in the NRD by the histone acetyltransferases p300 and CBP was identified recently. This post-translational modification enhances binding of the CBP coactivator and increases the DNA-binding and transactivation activity of c-Myb (18Tomita A. Towatari M. Tsuzuki S. Hayakawa F.

Chem. 2001; 276: 3674-3682Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). In vivo, c-Myb has been shown to be phosphorylated at serines 11 and 12 by casein kinase II (16Luscher B. Christenson E. Litchfield D.W. Krebs E.G. Eisenman R.N. Nature. 1990; 344: 517-522Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of these residues results in a lower DNA-binding affinity (16Luscher B. Christenson E. Litchfield D.W. Krebs E.G. Eisenman R.N. Nature. 1990; 344: 517-522Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar, 21Oelgeschlager M. Krieg J. Luscher-Firzlaff J.M. Luscher B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 5966-5974Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). In addition, phosphorylation of serine 528 in the PEST/EVES motif, located in the NRD, down-regulates the transactivation capacity without affecting its DNA-binding affinity (22Miglarese M.R. Richardson A.F. Aziz N. Bender T.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 22697-22705Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). The NRD is also subject to covalent modification with polyubiquitin chains on an unidentified lysine residue(s), and ubiquitinated c-Myb is recognized and rapidly degraded by the 26S proteasome proteolytic system (20Bies J. Wolff L. Oncogene. 1997; 14: 203-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 23Feikova S. Wolff L. Bies J. Neoplasma (Bratisl.). 2000; 47: 212-218PubMed Google Scholar). Deletion analysis of the c-Myb NRD identified two instability regions responsible for its very short half-life (24Bies J. Nazarov V. Wolff L. J. Virol. 1999; 73: 2038-2044Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, our recent results suggest that proteolytic stability of c-Myb is modulated through phosphorylation of the carboxyl terminus of c-Myb. Inhibitors of Ser/Thr phosphatases rapidly induce hyperphosphorylation-dependent conformational changes in the NRD, followed by accelerated proteolytic breakdown (25Bies J. Feikova S. Bottaro D.P. Wolff L. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 2846-2854Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar,26Bies J. Feikova S. Markus J. Wolff L. Blood Cells Mol. Dis. 2001; 27: 422-428Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). In addition to ubiquitin, severalubiquitin-like (Ubl) proteins have been found to be covalently attached to target proteins (27Melchior F. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2000; 16: 591-626Crossref PubMed Scopus (656) Google Scholar, 28Muller S. Hoege C. Pyrowolakis G. Jentsch S. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 2: 202-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (652) Google Scholar). The SUMO-1 protein belongs to the Ubl family. It was first discovered in the yeastSaccharomyces cerevisiae and named SMT3 (29Meluh P.B. Koshland D. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1995; 6: 793-807Crossref PubMed Scopus (354) Google Scholar). It was later identified as an interacting partner of several proteins with different functions in yeast two-hybrid screens and named PIC1 (30Boddy M.N. Howe K. Etkin L.D. Solomon E. Freemont P.S. Oncogene. 1996; 13: 971-982PubMed Google Scholar), sentrin (31Okura T. Gong L. Kamitani T. Wada T. Okura I. Wei C.F. Chang H.M. Yeh E.T. J. Immunol. 1996; 157: 4277-4281PubMed Google Scholar), and UBL1 (32Shen Z. Pardington-Purtymun P.E. Comeaux J.C. Moyzis R.K. Chen D.J. Genomics. 1996; 36: 271-279Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). Shortly thereafter, two groups reported that a ubiquitin-related protein termed GMP1 (33Matunis M.J. Coutavas E. Blobel G. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 1457-1470Crossref PubMed Scopus (961) Google Scholar) or SUMO-1 (34Mahajan R. Delphin C. Guan T. Gerace L. Melchior F. Cell. 1997; 88: 97-107Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1010) Google Scholar) covalently attaches to RanGAP1. In recent years, there was an enormous expansion of reported SUMO-1 target proteins (28Muller S. Hoege C. Pyrowolakis G. Jentsch S. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 2: 202-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (652) Google Scholar). In contrast to ubiquitination, which usually marks protein for rapid degradation, sumolation is involved in the regulation of protein function through changes in protein-protein interaction, subcellular localization, and stabilization by antagonizing ubiquitination (27Melchior F. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2000; 16: 591-626Crossref PubMed Scopus (656) Google Scholar, 28Muller S. Hoege C. Pyrowolakis G. Jentsch S. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 2: 202-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (652) Google Scholar). Here we report a novel post-translational modification of the c-Myb NRD by the covalent attachment of at least three molecules of the SUMO-1 protein. We have shown that sumolation modulates the proteolytic stability and transactivation activity of c-Myb. Thus, these results provide another way through which the NRD affects c-Myb activity. Cloning of the wild-type full-length c-Myb construct (FL-Myb) and carboxyl-terminally truncated forms (CT3-MybΔ118aa, CT4-MybΔ151aa, CT5-MybΔ223aa, and CT6-MybΔ266aa) into the eukaryotic expression vector pcDNA3.1(+) was described previously (24Bies J. Nazarov V. Wolff L. J. Virol. 1999; 73: 2038-2044Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). An amino-terminally truncated form of c-Myb lacking the first 74 amino acids (NT-MybΔ74aa) was constructed by PCR using a sense primer (ATGCGGATCC ATGGATGAGCAGTGCCAACACC, with the unique BamHI site underlined and the ATG codon in italics) and an antisense primer (CCAAACCCCATCAAATGATTG). ABamHI/EcoRI-digested PCR product was used to replace the complete amino terminus of full-length c-Myb in pcDNAFL-Myb. All c-Myb Lys-to-Arg mutants (FL-MybK499R, FL-MybK523R, FL-MybK611R, and FL-MybK499R,K523R) were generated by site-directed mutagenesis using the QuikChangeTMsite-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) following the manufacturer's instructions. The introduction of specific mutations was confirmed by dideoxy sequencing using the BigDyeTMTerminator Version 2.0 Ready Reaction Cycle sequencing kit (Applied Biosystems) on an automatic Model 310 Genetic Analyzer (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Vectors used in the yeast two-hybrid assay (CM2, CM3, CM4, CM5, CM6, CM7, and CM8) were constructed by amplification of specific regions from the c-Myb NRD using an upstream primer containing the unique restriction endonuclease siteEcoRI and a down- stream primer containing aBamHI site. PCR products were subsequently cloned in frame downstream of the activation domain of the Gal4 transcription factor in the pGADT7 vector (CLONTECH) and verified by automated DNA sequencing. Plasmids encoding the FL-MybS528A (pRmb3SVS528A) and FL-MybS528D (pRmb3SV.9) mutants of c-Myb (22Miglarese M.R. Richardson A.F. Aziz N. Bender T.P. J. Biol.

Virology. 1996; 224: 224-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar) were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) and 10% fetal calf serum. Murine T-cell lymphoma cells (VL-3) were maintained in RPMI 1640 medium, 10% fetal calf serum, 50 μm β-mercaptoethanol, 100 μmminimal Eagle's medium nonessential amino acids, and 1 mm sodium pyruvate. Murine erythroleukemia cells (DS19; a kind gift from S. Ruscetti, NCI-Frederick Cancer Research and Development Center, Frederick, MD) and SV40-transformed monkey kidney cells (COS-7; American Type Culture Collection) were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium and 10% fetal calf serum. Murine myeloid M1 cells (kindly provided by B. Hoffman, Temple University, School of Medicine, Philadelphia, PA) were incubated in RPMI medium 1640 and 10% horse serum. All tissue culture media were supplemented with 2 mg/ml glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin (Invitrogen). For transient transfections, COS-7 cells were plated at a density of 3 × 105cells/100-mm tissue culture dish 1 day prior to transfection. The next day, the medium was replaced, and cells were cultured for 1 h. Transfection was carried out with 3 μg of plasmid DNA/dish using the EffecteneTM transfection reagent (QIAGEN Inc.) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Expression of the transfected gene was analyzed 36 h post-transfection. Cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline and disrupted in cold lysis buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 50 mm NaCl, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% SDS, and 0.5% sodium deoxycholate) supplemented with a mixture of protease inhibitors (CompleteTM, Roche Molecular Biochemicals) and 10 mm iodoacetamide (Fluka). Cell lysates were sonicated for 30 s and clarified by centrifugation at 13,000 rpm for 15 min at 4 °C. The c-Myb protein was immunoprecipitated with rabbit antiserum raised against the bacterial fusion protein GST-c-Myb(I) (37Bies J. Hoffman B. Amanullah A. Giese T. Wolff L. Oncogene. 1996; 12: 355-363PubMed Google Scholar). Immunoprecipitated proteins or whole cell lysates were fractionated by SDS-PAGE on an 8% gel and electrophoretically transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane (Protran, Schleicher & Schüll). Immunoblots were incubated with anti-c-Myb monoclonal antibody (a kind gift of Tim Bender) or anti-FLAG monoclonal antibody M2 (Sigma) and visualized with SuperSignal West Pico chemiluminescent substrate (Pierce) in accordance with the manufacturer's instructions. Cells (2 × 106 to 1 × 107) were starved for 15 min in 1 ml of methionine/cysteine-free medium, metabolically labeled for 45 min with 400 μCi of Tran35S-label (ICN), washed free of radioactive amino acids (pulse), and incubated in prewarmed complete medium supplemented with 10% serum (chase). At the indicated time points, the cells were disrupted in cold lysis buffer and immunoprecipitated with rabbit anti-c-Myb polyclonal antiserum raised against the bacterial fusion protein GST-c-Myb(I) (37Bies J. Hoffman B. Amanullah A. Giese T. Wolff L. Oncogene. 1996; 12: 355-363PubMed Google Scholar). All precipitates were extensively washed with radioimmune precipitation assay buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 150 mmNaCl, 0.1% SDS, 1% Nonidet P-40, and 1% sodium deoxycholate), electrophoresed under reducing conditions on an 8% polyacrylamide gel, and visualized by fluorography. Exposed preflashed x-ray films were quantitatively analyzed using a Model 222-020 UltroScan XL laser densitometer (Amersham Biosciences, Inc.). To identify a region located in the c-Myb NRD that interacts with murine Ubc9, the Matchmaker two-hybrid kit (CLONTECH) was used in accordance with the manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, yeast strain PJ69-2A (MATα, trp1–901,leu2-3,112, ura3-52,his3-200, gal4Δ, gal80Δ,LYS2::GAL1 UAS -GAL1 TATA -HIS3,GAL2 UAS -GAL2 TATA -ADE2,MEL1) was cotransformed with pGBT9-Ubc9 and with constructs carrying different regions of the c-Myb NRD fused in frame to the Gal4 activation domain of the pGADT7 vector. Interaction of Ubc9 with a specific subregion of the c-Myb NRD was identified by growth of yeast clones on selective medium lacking tryptophan, leucine, histidine, and adenosine. Transformation efficacy for each experiment was evaluated by scoring the colonies on selective medium lacking tryptophan and leucine. COS-7 cells were plated at a density of 2 × 105 cells/well in six-well tissue culture plates and grown overnight prior to transfections. Transfections were carried out using the EffecteneTM transfection reagent according to the manufacturer's instructions. To assess c-Myb transcriptional activity, COS-7 cells were cotransfected with the empty vector pcDNA3.1(+) (Invitrogen) or expression vectors encoding wild-type c-Myb (FL-Myb) or a mutant form of c-Myb (FL-MybK523R) (0.5 μg of each) and with 100 ng of Myb-responsive reporter plasmid p5xMRE-A-luc (containing five copies of themim-1A Myb-responsive element (MRE) upstream of minimal herpes simplex virus thymidine kinase and the firefly luciferase gene) and 30 ng of pRL-TK Renilla luciferase vector (Promega). After transfection, cells were grown for 24 h and processed for both firefly and Renilla luciferase activities using the Dual-Luciferase® reporter assay system (Promega) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Transfection efficiency was evaluated using Renillaluciferase activity. Expression of the c-Myb protein was evaluated by Western blotting using cell extracts diluted in radioimmune precipitation assay buffer. Each transfection experiment was performed in triplicate and repeated two times. The c-Myb protein is a short-lived transcription factor, rapidly degraded via the ubiquitin/26 S proteasome degradation pathway (20Bies J. Wolff L. Oncogene. 1997; 14: 203-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). We have shown previously that, at least in myeloid cells, instability domains are located in two regions of the NRD domain (24Bies J. Nazarov V. Wolff L. J. Virol. 1999; 73: 2038-2044Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). While studying the proteolytic processing of the unstable forms of endogenous c-Myb (either full-length or amino-terminally truncated Myb) in a myeloid progenitor cell line (M1) as well as in monocytic tumor cell lines (30-3-14, 30-4-18, 30A-1-2, 30A-3-12, and 30A-3-14), we observed several Myb-immunoreactive proteins migrating above the major form of c-Myb (Fig. 1 A). The mobility and intensity of these bands depended on the size and quantity of endogenous c-Myb, respectively, suggesting that these Myb-immunoreactive species represent either differentially spliced forms of c-myb or c-Myb post-translational modifications. We ruled out the possibility that these bands were c-Myb-co-immunoprecipitating proteins because the mobilities of these Myb-immunoreactive species were, in every instance, strictly related to the size of the parental endogenous c-Myb protein (Fig. 1 A). In addition, saturation of rabbit anti-c-Myb polyclonal serum (40Sampson D.A. Wang M. Matunis M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 21664-21669Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (399) Google Scholar) with the part of the fusion protein used for immunization of rabbits (the first 325 amino-terminal amino acids) completely blocked immunoprecipitation of both the normal-size c-Myb and slower migrating bands (data not shown). These data strongly support the contention that these novel bands are either modified forms of the c-Myb protein or its alternatively spliced forms. Slower migrating c-Myb-immunoreactive bands were also detected in erythroid and lymphoid cells (Fig.1 B), indicating that Myb-immunoreactive species are not restricted to the myeloid cell lineage. Several mechanisms could account for the slower migrating bands immunoprecipitated from hematopoietic cells. To determine whether at least some of the slower migrating bands could represent post-translational modifications of c-Myb, we transiently transfected plasmid encoding full-length c-Myb into COS-7 cells, metabolically labeled them, and immunoprecipitated c-Myb. In this experimental setup, there is no alternative splicing of c-myb; thus, all slower migrating Myb-immunoreactive forms represent post-translationally modified c-Myb. Slower migrating Myb-immunoreactive forms could be detected only in cells transfected with FL-Myb, but not in cells transfected with an empty vector (pcDNA3.1) or a plasmid encoding a carboxyl-terminally truncated form of c-Myb (CT6-MybΔ266aa) (Fig.1 C). This experiment indicated that an intact carboxyl terminus is required for detection of the Myb-immunoreactive protein species in cells. Several recent reports identified novel post-translational modifications of nuclear transcription factors in which the ubiquitin-like protein SUMO-1 was covalently attached to specific lysines in the target protein (28Muller S. Hoege C. Pyrowolakis G. Jentsch S. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 2: 202-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (652) Google Scholar, 29Meluh P.B. Koshland D. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1995; 6: 793-807Crossref PubMed Scopus (354) Google Scholar). Thus, to determine whether the slower migrating Myb-immunoreactive forms were SUMO-1-modified c-Myb proteins, we analyzed COS-7 cells that were transiently transfected with constructs encoding FL-Myb and FLAG-tagged SUMO-1. c-Myb was immunoprecipitated from the transfected cells and analyzed by Western immunoblotting with anti-FLAG and anti-c-Myb monoclonal antibodies as described under “Materials and Methods.” As shown in Fig.2 A, anti-FLAG antibody recognized at least three bands in the immunoprecipitates from cells transfected with both the FL-Myb- and FLAG-SUMO-1-encoding constructs. None of these bands were detected in COS-7 cells transfected with constructs encoding either FL-Myb or FLAG-SUMO-1 alone. Anti-c-Myb monoclonal antibodies were used to confirm that a similar amount c-Myb was expressed in and immunoprecipitated from COS-7 cells transfected with the FL-Myb-encoding construct. Anti-c-Myb monoclonal antibodies also detected a SUMO-1-modified form migrating ∼20 kDa above the non-sumolated parental form of c-Myb (Fig. 2 A; the endogenous form of SUMO-1-modified c-Myb is marked with a closed arrowhead, and FLAG-SUMO-1-modified c-Myb is marked withopen arrowheads). Transfection efficiency was evaluated by Western immunoblotting of total cellular proteins. Anti-FLAG antibodies readily detected a ladder of bands representing the SUMO-1-conjugated cellular proteins only in cells transfected with FLAG-SUMO-1. Anti-c-Myb monoclonal antibodies detected the FL-Myb protein (75-kDa form) only in cells transfected with the FL-Myb construct (Fig.2 B). Although more than one modified c-Myb species was detected with anti-FLAG antibody, only one modified form was detected with c-Myb antibody in the experiment depicted in Fig. 2 A. This could be due to reduced sensitivity after stripping off anti-FLAG antibody. To determine whether we could detect more c-Myb-modified bands if the blot was not stripped, we performed another experiment in which Western blotting, using c-Myb-reactive antibody, was carried out on a fresh blot. This time, as shown in Fig. 2 C, we detected at least two modified forms that had similar mobility to those detected with anti-FLAG antibody (Fig. 2 A). To confirm that the slower migrating bands were indeed sumolated forms of c-Myb and not other co-immunoprecipitated sumolated proteins, we transfected COS-7 cells with the FLAG-SUMO-1 construct and either full-length (FL-Myb) or amino-terminally truncated (NT-MybΔ74aa) c-Myb. As in the previous experiment, the transfected cells were lysed, immunoprecipitated with anti-c-Myb antiserum, and analyzed by Western immunoblotting using anti-FLAG monoclonal antibody. As shown in Fig. 2 D, the mobility of all Myb-immunoreactive bands detected by anti-FLAG immunoblotting correlated directly with the size of the transfected c-Myb proteins. Thus, this experiment provides strong evidence that slower migrating forms are sumolated forms of c-Myb. The data presented in Fig. 2 confirm that slower migrating Myb-immunoreactive bands are indeed SUMO-1-conjugated c-Myb species. Despite the fact that the calculated size of SUMO-1 is ∼11.5 kDa, SUMO-1-conjugated proteins run on SDS-PAGE as if they have an additional 20 kDa for each covalently attached SUMO-1 molecule (34Mahajan R. Delphin C. Guan T. Gerace L. Melchior F. Cell. 1997; 88: 97-107Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1010) Google Scholar). Unlike ubiquitin, which usually forms multimeric chains (polyubiquitin) attached to the target lysine of modified protein, SUMO-1 can be covalently attached to a single lysine only in a monomeric form (29Meluh P.B. Koshland D. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1995; 6: 793-807Crossref PubMed Scopus (354) Google Scholar,38Tatham M.H. Jaffray E. Vaughan O.A. Desterro J.M. Botting C.H. Naismith J.H. Hay R.T. J. Biol.

Thus, our results suggest that at least three different lysines are modified in c-Myb by covalent attachment of three molecules of SUMO-1. To map the target lysine residues for SUMO-1 modification of c-Myb, we tested a series of carboxyl-terminal deletion mutants in the in vivoSUMO-1 conjugation assay using COS-7 cells. Lysates from COS-7 cells transiently transfected with either FL-Myb or carboxyl-terminally truncated mutants of c-Myb and FLAG-tagged SUMO-1 were immunoprecipitated with anti-c-Myb antiserum, and immune complexes were separated on a gel and analyzed by Western immunoblotting with anti-FLAG and anti-c-Myb monoclonal antibodies.

Although the mechanism is unknown, export of mature mRNA from the nucleus is a critical regulatory step in gene expression. Analyses of hnRNP proteins have shown that many of these proteins are required for this essential cellular process. In this study, we characterize the <i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</i> Nab2 protein, which was first identified as a poly(A) RNA-binding protein (Anderson, J. T., Wilson, S. M., Datar, K. V., and Swanson, M. S. (1993) <i>Mol. Cell. Biol.</i>13, 2730–2741). Our work indicates that poly(A) RNA export from the nucleus is dependent upon a functional Nab2 protein; correspondingly, export of Nab2p from the nucleus is dependent upon ongoing RNA polymerase II transcription. Furthermore, we show that Nab2p is modified within its RGG domain by the type I protein-arginine methyltransferase, Hmt1p. Our experiments demonstrate that arginine methylation is required for the export of Nab2p from the nucleus and therefore establish an <i>in vivo</i> effect of this modification. Overall, these experiments provide evidence that Nab2p is an hnRNP protein that is required for poly(A) RNA export and whose export from the nucleus is regulated by Hmt1p."

However, an activated SHP2 still needs to associate with Gab1 to mediate Erk activation. It was unclear whether SHP2 is required to dephosphorylate a negative phosphorylation site on Gab1 or whether SHP2 needs the Gab1 pleckstrin homology (PH) domain to target it to the plasma membrane. We found that expression of a fusion protein consisting of the Gab1 PH domain and an active SHP2 (Gab1PH-SHP2ΔN) induced constitutive Mek1 and Erk2 activation. Linking the active SHP2ΔN to the PDK1 PH domain or the FRS2β myristoylation sequence also induced Mek1 activation. Mek1 activation by Gab1PH-SHP2ΔN was inhibited by an Src inhibitor and by Csk. Significantly, Gab1PH-SHP2ΔN induced Src activation. Gab1PH-SHP2ΔN expression activated Ras, and the Gab1PH-SHP2ΔN-induced Mek1 activation was blocked by RasN17. These findings suggest that Gab1PH-SHP2ΔN activated a signaling step upstream of Src and Ras. The SHP2 tyrosine phosphatase activity is essential for the function of the fusion protein. Together, these data show that the Gab1 sequence, besides the PH domain and SHP2 binding sites, is dispensable for Erk activation, suggesting that the primary role of Gab1 association with an activated SHP2 is to target it to the membrane.

Although this EGF signaling pathway is well known, it does not completely account for the mechanism of Erk activation by EGF. Several laboratories have reported that the protein tyrosine phosphatase (PTPase) activity of SHP2 is required for Erk activation by EGF and other growth factors (2Yamauchi K. Milarski K.L.

However, because the SHP2 substrate that controls Erk activation has not been identified, the mechanism for the requirement of SHP2 PTPase activity in Erk activation remains unexplained. SHP2 is a PTPase with two Src homology-2 (SH2) domains (N-SH2 and C-SH2) located in the N-terminal region and two potential Grb2 SH2 domain binding sites located in the C-terminal region (see Fig. 1) (7Tonks N.K. Neel B.G. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2001; 13: 182-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (464) Google Scholar). SHP2 is basally inactive due to auto-inhibition by its N-SH2 domain. It can be activated by binding to tyrosine-based activation motifs or by deletion of the N-SH2 domain (8Hof P. Pluskey S. Dhe-Paganon S. Eck M.J. Shoelson S.E.

Gab1 is a multisite docking protein that contains an N-terminal pleckstrin homology (PH) domain, multiple tyrosine phosphorylation sites, and two Grb2 SH3 domain binding sites (see Fig. 1).

We recently found that Tyr-627 and Tyr-659 of Gab1 constitute a bisphosphoryl tyrosine-based activation motif that mediates binding and activation of SHP2 in EGF-stimulated cells (15Cunnick J.M. Mei L. Doupnik C.A. Wu J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 24380-24387Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). Furthermore, an activated SHP2 must also associate with Gab1 in EGF-stimulated cells to permit Erk activation (15Cunnick J.M. Mei L. Doupnik C.A. Wu J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 24380-24387Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). However, it was unclear why physical association of an activated SHP2 with Gab1 is required for Erk activation by EGF. Interestingly, expression of a chimeric protein consisting of an SHP2-binding-defective Gab1 and an N-SH2 domain deletion mutant of SHP2 (Gab1FF-SHP2ΔN) induced Erk2 activation (15Cunnick J.M. Mei L. Doupnik C.A. Wu J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 24380-24387Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). This observation suggests either that SHP2 dephosphorylates a negative phosphorylation site on Gab1 to activate Erk MAP kinase or that SHP2 needs Gab1 to bring the activated PTPase to the proximity of its substrate. In this study, we demonstrate that Gab1 sequence, besides the PH domain, is dispensable for Mek1-Erk2 activation by the Gab1-SHP2 chimera. Furthermore, linking the active SHP2 to the PDK1 PH domain or to the FRS2β/SNT-2 myristoylation sequence can also cause constitutive activation of the Erk MAP kinase signaling pathway. Significantly, expression of the Gab1 PH domain-active SHP2 chimera (Gab1PH-SHP2ΔN) activates c-Src and Ras, and inhibition of c-Src or Ras blocks Mek1 activation by Gab1PH-SHP2ΔN. This finding suggests that the primary role of Gab1 association with an activated SHP2 in the Erk activation pathway is to target the PTPase to the membrane to activate a signaling step upstream of Src and Ras. The following constructs have been described (13Cunnick J.M. Dorsey J.F. Munoz-Antonia T. Mei L. Wu J. J. Biol.

HA-tagged H-Ras, H-RasN17, and H-RasV12 were obtained from Guthrie cDNA Resource Center. GST-Raf-RBD fusion protein was prepared as described (18Wei S. Gilvary D.L. Corliss B.C. Sebti S. Sun J.

The Grb2 expression vector was constructed by subcloning a 2.3-kb EcoRI-XhoI fragment from pKLS12 (19Suen K-L. Bustelo X.R. Pawson T. Barbacid M. Mol. Cell.

A Ser-17 to Asn mutant of Rap1A (Rap1AN17) was made by polymerase chain reaction from a human Rap1A cDNA (American Type Culture Collection) and cloned into pCDNA3.1. A HA-tagged c-Src expression vector was made by subcloning the human c-Src coding sequence into a pCDNA3-HA vector. A plasmid for expression of a fusion protein consisting of the Gab1 PH domain and SHP2ΔN (Gab1PH-SHP2ΔN) was made from Gab1FF-SHP2ΔN by deleting the coding sequence for amino acids 177–625 of Gab1 (see Fig.1). A plasmid for the PTPase-inactive Gab1PH-SHP2ΔN-CS was made from Gab1PH-SHP2ΔN by mutating Cys-463 of SHP2 to Ser. Gab1PH-SHP2ΔN-Δcat was made by replacing the SHP2ΔN coding sequence in Gab1PH-SHP2ΔN with the corresponding sequence from SHP2-Δcat (13Cunnick J.M. Dorsey J.F. Munoz-Antonia T. Mei L. Wu J. J. Biol.

Similarly, Gab1PH-SHP2ΔN-FF was prepared from Gab1PH-SHP2ΔN by replacing the SHP2ΔN coding sequence with the corresponding sequence from an SHP2 with double Tyr-to-Phe mutations at Tyr-546 and Tyr-584 (provided by Dr. Lin Mei). The coding sequence for amino acids 423–559 of PDK1 was amplified from a mouse PDK1 cDNA (American Type Culture Collection) (20Dong L.Q. Zhang R. Langlais P. He H. Clark M. Zhu L. Liu F. J. Biol.

The DNA fragment was used to replace the Gab1 PH domain coding sequence in Gab1PH-SHP2ΔN to generate a plasmid for PDK1PH-SHP2ΔN (see Fig. 1). A plasmid for myristoylated SHP2ΔN (myr-SHP2ΔN) was made by replacing the Gab1 PH domain coding sequence in Gab1PH-SHP2ΔN with the coding sequence for amino acids 1–26 of FRS2β (22Xu H. Lee K.W.

All constructs were confirmed by DNA sequencing. HEK293 and COS-7 cells were grown in Dulbecco's Modified Eagle Medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (FCS). Transfection was performed with LipofectAMINE (Invitrogen). Typically, cells grown in 60-mm plates were incubated with DNA (2 μg of total)-LipofectAMINE (12 μl) complexes in serum-free medium for 5 h. The DNA complexes were then removed from the medium. The cells were starved in DMEM/0.1% FCS for 20 h and then used for experiments.

HA-Mek1, HA-Erk2, or HA-Src was immunoprecipitated with a monoclonal antibody against the HA tag (Covance). Mek1 kinase activity was determined by an immune complex kinase assay with [γ-32P]ATP using a recombinant, kinase-defective Erk2 (KR) as substrate. Erk2 activity was determined in the immune complex with [γ-32P]ATP using myelin basic protein as substrate. Src kinase activity was determined in the presence of [γ-32P]ATP by autophosphorylation and by the use of acid-denatured enolase as exogenous substrate. Detailed conditions for these kinase assays have been given (15Cunnick J.M. Mei L. Doupnik C.A. Wu J. J. Biol.

COS-7 cells in 60-mm plates were transfected with the plasmid for Gab1PH-SHP2ΔN, PDKPH-SHP2ΔN, or myr-SHP2ΔN. Transfected cells were starved for 20 h in 0.1% FCS. After washing twice with phosphate-buffered saline, cells were scraped into 1 ml of hypotonic buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 10 mm NaCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mmNa3VO4, 2 μg/ml leupeptin, and 100 μg/ml phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) and incubated on ice for 15 min. The cells were homogenized by passage through a 21-gauge needle. Nuclei and whole cells were removed by centrifugation at 1,000 ×g for 3 min. Membranes were isolated from the cleared lysates by centrifugation at 100,000 × g for 60 min at 4 °C in a tabletop ultracentrifuge (Beckman). The supernatants were retained (cytosolic fraction), and the pellets were resuspended in hypotonic buffer (membrane fraction) (26Atkinson P.H.

It was found that expression of a fusion protein consisting of an SHP2-binding-defective Gab1 (mutations of Tyr-627 and Tyr-659 to Phe) and an active SHP2 (Gab1FF-SHP2ΔN) induced Erk2 activation in COS-7 cells (15Cunnick J.M.

Gab1 contains several known tyrosine phosphorylation sites and Grb2 SH3 domain binding sites between the PH domain and Tyr-627 (Fig. 1) (27Lehr S. Kotzka J. Herkner A. Klein E. Siethoff C. Knebel B.

To determine whether these docking sites are essential for Erk activation by the fusion protein, we deleted the region between the Gab1 PH domain and Phe-627 in Gab1FF-SHP2ΔN to generate Gab1PH-SHP2ΔN (Fig. 1). Gab1PH-SHP2ΔN and HA-Erk2 were co-expressed in HEK293 and COS-7 cells, and Erk2 activity was determined (Fig.2). Consistent with previous observations, Gab1FF-SHP2ΔN activated Erk2 in these cells (Fig. 2,B–E). Interestingly, expression of Gab1PH-SHP2ΔN resulted in constitutive Erk2 activation to a higher extent than Gab1FF-SHP2ΔN. Similarly, comparison of Mek1 activity in COS-7 cells transfected with Gab1PH-SHP2ΔN and Gab1FF-SHP2ΔN showed that the constitutive Mek1 activity was about 2-fold higher in cells transfected with the Gab1 PH domain fusion protein than the full-length Gab1 fusion protein (Fig. 2, F and G). Therefore, the Gab1 sequence between the PH domain and Tyr-627 is not required for Erk2 or Mek1 activation by the fusion protein. Because constitutive Erk2 activation appeared to up-regulate expression of the exogenous HA-Erk2 but not HA-Mek1 and because Mek1 activation correlates with Erk2 activation in the cells, we used Mek1 activity as a measure for activation of the Mek1-Erk2 signaling pathway in subsequent experiments. To determine whether constitutive Mek1 activation by Gab1PH-SHP2ΔN is affected by the amount of serum in the medium, transfected cells were incubated for 20 h in DMEM containing 0, 0.1, or 10% FCS. Fig. 3shows that the Mek1 activity in empty vector-transfected cells was minimal in the continuous presence of 10% FCS, as it was in 0 or 0.1% FCS. Gab1PH-SHP2ΔN caused constitutive Mek1 activation without major differences when these cells were incubated with 0, 0.1, or 10% FCS. Data presented in Figs. 2 and 3 indicate that linking an active SHP2 to the Gab1 PH domain is sufficient to induce constitutive Mek1-Erk2 activation. The Gab1 PH domain is known to target Gab1 to the plasma membrane (29Rodrigues G.A. Falasca M. Zhang Z. Ong S.H. Schlessinger J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 1448-1459Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar). We therefore tested whether targeting an active SHP2 to the plasma membrane through other sequences could induce Mek1 activation. For this purpose, we replaced the Gab1 PH domain sequence in Gab1PH-SHP2ΔN with the PDK1 PH domain sequence to generate the PDK1PH-SHP2ΔN construct or with the FRS2β N-terminal myristoylation sequence to produce the myr-SHP2ΔN construct (Fig. 1). The PDK1 PH domain binds phosphoinositides with high affinity (21Currie R.A. Walker K.S. Gray A. Deak A. Casamayor A. Downes C.P. Cohen P. Alessi D.R. Lucocq J. Biochem. J. 1999; 337: 575-583Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar). FRS2 is a fibroblast growth factor receptor substrate that binds SHP2 in response to fibroblast growth factor and nerve growth factor (30Hadari Y.R. Kouhara H. Lax I. Schlessinger J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 3966-3973Crossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar). Like Gab1PH-SHP2ΔN, PDK1PH-SHP2ΔN and myr-SHP2ΔN induced constitutive Mek1 activation, whereas SHP2ΔN had no effect (Fig.4, A–C). These data indicate that the Gab1 PH domain can be replaced with the PDK1 PH domain or the FRS2β myristoylation sequence for Mek1 activation. Fig. 4 Dshows that Gab1PH-SHP2ΔN and PDK1PH-SHP2ΔN were found in both membrane and cytosolic fractions, whereas myr-SHP2ΔN was found only in the membrane. These results suggest that Mek1 can be activated by targeting SHP2ΔN to the plasma membrane. To assess the possibility that Src tyrosine kinase may be involved in the Gab1PH-SHP2ΔN-induced Mek1 activation pathway, we incubated the transfected cells with an Src tyrosine kinase inhibitor, PP1. Alternatively, cells were co-transfected with Csk, which phosphorylates and inactivates c-Src. Fig.5, A–C, shows that incubation of cells with PP1 resulted in 85% inhibition of Mek1 activation by Gab1PH-SHP2ΔN, whereas co-transfection of cells with Csk and Gab1PH-SHP2ΔN led to 61% inhibition of Mek1 activation by Gab1PH-SHP2ΔN. These results suggest that Src tyrosine kinase activity is involved in the Gab1PH-SHP2ΔN-induced Mek1 activation pathway. To determine whether Gab1PH-SHP2ΔN expression resulted in Src activation, we assayed Src tyrosine kinase activity in cells transfected with different amounts of Gab1PH-SHP2ΔN plasmid. Fig. 5,D and E, shows that a low Src tyrosine kinase activity was detected in control cells that have been transfected with the empty vector. Both autophosphorylation and substrate phosphorylation activities of Src tyrosine kinase were increased with increasing amounts of Gab1PH-SHP2ΔN plasmid used in transfection. To evaluate whether the SHP2 PTPase activity is involved in Gab1PH-SHP2ΔN-induced Src activation, we compared Src tyrosine kinase activity in cells transfected with Gab1PH-SHP2ΔN and a PTPase-inactive construct of Gab1PH-SHP2ΔN (Gab1PH-SHP2ΔN-CS, see below). As shown in Fig. 5,F and G, expression of Gab1PH-SHP2ΔN resulted in Src activation, but expression of Gab1PH-SHP2ΔN-CS did not lead to Src activation. Thus, the SHP2 PTPase activity is required for Src activation by Gab1PH-SHP2ΔN. To determine whether Gab1PH-SHP2ΔN causes MEK1 activation through a Ras-dependent mechanism, we co-expressed dominant negative RasN17 or Rap1AN17 with Gab1PH-SHP2ΔN and HA-Mek1 in COS-7 cells. As shown in Fig.6, A and B, RasN17 completely blocked Mek1 activation by Gab1PH-SHP2ΔN, whereas Rap1AN17 only slightly affected Mek1 activation by Gab1PH-SHP2ΔN. Therefore, Gab1PH-SHP2ΔN-mediated Mek1 activation is Ras-dependent. To measure Ras activation, we employed the GST-Raf-RBD fusion protein pull-down assay (18Wei S. Gilvary D.L. Corliss B.C. Sebti S. Sun J. Straus D.B. Leibson P.J. Trapani J.A. Hamilton A.D. Weber M.J. Djeu J.Y. J. Immunol. 2000; 165: 3811-3819Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Fig. 6, C and D, shows that the constitutively active RasV12 was bound to GST-Raf-RBD, whereas the constitutively inactive RasN17 was not, validating the methodology. Control cells transfected with pCDNA3.1FG (empty vector) had a small amount of GST-Raf-RBD-bound wild-type Ras. Transfection of COS-7 cells with Gab1PH-SHP2ΔN resulted in an average of a 3-fold (n = 4) increase of the wild-type Ras bound to GST-Raf-RBD (Fig. 6, C and D). This result indicates that expression of Gab1PH-SHP2ΔN induces Ras activation. At least three distinct MAP kinases (Erk, Jnk, and p38) are downstream of Ras (31Chang L. Karin M. Nature. 2001; 410: 37-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (4420) Google Scholar). Erk, Jnk, and p38 selectively phosphorylate transcriptional factors Elk1, c-Jun, and CHOP, respectively, leading to activation of their transcriptional activity. Using the PathDetect trans-reporting systems for Elk1, c-Jun, and CHOP, we tested whether Gab1PH-SHP2ΔN activates one or more of these reporter activities. Fig. 7shows that expression of Gab1PH-SHP2ΔN resulted in a 16-fold activation of the Elk1-trans-reporter activity, confirming activation of the Mek1-Erk2 pathway by Gab1PH-SHP2ΔN. The increases in c-Jun-trans-reporter and CHOP-trans-reporter activities by Gab1PH-SHP2ΔN were marginal. Thus, Gab1PH-SHP2ΔN selectively activates the Erk2-Elk1 signaling pathway. To determine the mechanism by which Gab1PH-SHP2ΔN causes Mek1 activation, we prepared three mutants of Gab1PH-SHP2ΔN. Gab1PH-SHP2ΔN-CS has a Cys-to-Ser mutation in the catalytic Cys-463 of rat SHP2 PTPase (5Bennett A.M. Hausdorff S.F. O'Reilly A.M. Freeman R.M. Neel B.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 1189-1202Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar). Gab1PH-SHP2ΔN-FF has two Tyr-to-Phe mutations in the two potential Grb2 binding sites (Tyr-546, Tyr-584) in the C-terminal region of rat SHP2 (5Bennett A.M. Hausdorff S.F. O'Reilly A.M. Freeman R.M. Neel B.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 1189-1202Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar). Gab1PH-SHP2ΔN-Δcat has a 29-amino acid (amino acids 450–478) deletion in the SHP2 catalytic domain (13Cunnick J.M. Dorsey J.F. Munoz-Antonia T. Mei L. Wu J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 13842-13848Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). Fig. 8 shows that Mek1 activity was elevated 7.2-fold in COS-7 cells transfected with the wild-type Gab1PH-SHP2ΔN fusion protein in these experiments, whereas no constitutive Mek1 activity was detected in cells transfected with SHP2ΔN or Grb2. Mutations at Tyr-546/Tyr-584 of SHP2 in Gab1PH-SHP2ΔN reduced the Mek1 activity to 2.6-fold above basal. Although Gab1PH-SHP2ΔN-FF activated Mek1 to a lower level than that by Gab1PH-SHP2ΔN, Mek1 activation by Gab1PH-SHP2ΔN-FF was consistently detectable (Fig. 8). In contrast, removal of the SHP2 PTPase activity by the catalytic Cys-463 to Ser mutation or by deletion of 29 amino acids in the catalytic domain completely eliminated the ability of the fusion protein to activate Mek1 (Fig. 8). These results indicate that Tyr-546/Tyr-584 of SHP2 contribute to Mek1 activation by Gab1PH-SHP2ΔN, but they are not essential. In contrast, SHP2 PTPase activity is required for Mek1 activation by the fusion protein. To determine whether Grb2 is associated with Gab1PH-SHP2ΔN and whether Tyr-546 and Tyr-584 of SHP2 mediate this association, COS-7 cells were transfected with plasmids for Gab1PH-SHP2ΔN or Gab1PH-SHP2ΔN-FF together with a Grb2 expression vector (Fig.9). Grb2 immunoprecipitates from these cells were then analyzed by immunoblotting for the presence of Gab1PH-SHP2ΔN and Gab1PH-SHP2ΔN-FF (Fig. 9). Fig. 9, Aand C, shows that Grb2 and the two fusion proteins were expressed in transfected cells. Fig. 9 B shows that Gab1PH-SHP2ΔN but not Gab1PH-SHP2ΔN-FF was detected in the Grb2 immunoprecipitates. Tyrosine phosphorylation of Gab1, Gab1FF-SHP2ΔN, and Gab1PH-SHP2ΔN in COS-7 cells was weak but detectable after long exposure of the film, whereas no tyrosine phosphorylation was found in Gab1PH-SHP2ΔN-FF (Fig. 9 D). This result suggests that Tyr-546 and/or Tyr-584 were weakly phosphorylated in the cells and therefore could serve as the Grb2 docking sites. SHP2 association with Gab1 is required for Erk activation by EGF (15Cunnick J.M. Mei L. Doupnik C.A. Wu J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 24380-24387Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). The activated SHP2 may dephosphorylate a specific negative phosphorylation site on Gab1 or on a Gab1-associated protein. Alternatively, the activated SHP2 may require the Gab1 PH domain to translocate it to the plasma membrane to dephosphorylate a membrane-associated substrate. The data presented in this study illustrate that physical association of an activated SHP2 with the Gab1 PH domain is sufficient to activate the Erk MAP kinase pathway. Furthermore, the Gab1 PH domain can be replaced with other membrane-targeting sequences. These results indicate that the primary function of Gab1 association with an activated SHP2 in Erk MAP kinase activation is for the Gab1 PH domain to target the activated SHP2 to the membrane rather than for SHP2 to dephosphorylate a specific phosphorylation site on Gab1. In agreement with this conclusion, it was found that SHP2 binding to another membrane-anchored docking protein, FRS2, could mediate fibroblast growth factor-stimulated Erk MAP kinase activation (30Hadari Y.R. Kouhara H. Lax I. Schlessinger J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 3966-3973Crossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar). Although the critical SHP2 PTPase substrate remains to be identified, our experiments suggest that it functions upstream of Src and Ras. Mek1 activation by Gab1PH-SHP2ΔN was inhibited by PP1 and Csk, indicating that the Src tyrosine kinase was involved in Mek1 activation by Gab1PH-SHP2ΔN. Importantly, expression of Gab1PH-SHP2ΔN in COS-7 cells resulted in activation of Src tyrosine kinase in a process that requires the SHP2 PTPase activity. However, it remains to be determined whether Src is a direct substrate of Gab1PH-SHP2ΔN or whether Gab1PH-SHP2ΔN acts on a regulatory step upstream of Src. Our PathDetect trans-reporting assays suggest that Gab1PH-SHP2ΔN selectively activates the Erk-Elk1 pathway. It is possible that an additional signal is required for Jnk and p38 activation, which is not activated by Gab1PH-SHP2ΔN. However, a previous study (6Deb T.B. Wong L. Salomon D.S. Zhou G. Dixon J.E. Gutkind J.S. Thompson S.A. Johnson G.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 16643-16646Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar) found that SHP2 mutants specifically blocked Erk, but not Jnk, activation by EGF. Thus, selective activation of the Erk-Elk1 signaling pathway by Gab1PH-SHP2ΔN is likely due to specific regulation of the Erk MAP kinase pathway by SHP2. Our SHP2 mutation experiments suggest that targeting Grb2 to the membrane contributes to Erk activation by the Gab1PH-SHP2ΔN fusion protein. However, targeting Grb2 to the membrane by Gab1PH-SHP2ΔN, similar to the recruitment of Grb2 to autophosphorylated EGF receptor in EGF-stimulated cells, does not appear to be sufficient for Erk activation. In both cases, SHP2 PTPase activity is required. This observation reinforces the significance of SHP2 PTPase activity in the regulation of Erk activation. Activation of Mek1 and Erk2 by SHP2ΔN fusion proteins is constitutive, indicating that membrane-associated SHP2ΔN is able to bypass the signal desensitization mechanism. Interestingly, cells grown in 10% FCS, which is able to induce Mek1 activation, do not appear to have constitutive Mek1 activity. Therefore, our observation that membrane-associated SHP2ΔN can cause constitutive Mek1 activation suggests that the SHP2 substrate plays a very important role in preventing constitutive Erk activation, which would predictably have undesirable cellular consequences.

HIF-1 is a critical regulator of the physiological adaptive response to hypoxia, since it activates genes regulating, among other processes, angiogenesis, erythropoiesis, and glucose metabolism. HIF-1 has also been described to be involved in tumor angiogenesis and ischemic diseases such as myocardial ischemia or stroke (reviewed in Refs. 2Wenger R.H. J. Exp.

Whereas ARNT is constitutively expressed, HIF-1α expression is induced in hypoxic cells with an exponential increase in expression as cells are exposed to decreased oxygen partial pressures. As determined in HeLa cells, the highest HIF-1α protein levels are reached at 0.5% oxygen (4Jiang B.H. Semenza G.L. Bauer C. Marti H.H. Am. J.

Further activation of HIF-1 involves nuclear translocation, dimerization with ARNT, DNA binding, and recruitment of transcriptional co-activators. These processes are regulated at least in part by posttranslational modifications. It has been demonstrated that phosphorylation of HIF-1α via the Ras/Raf-MEK-p42/44 and the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase-PTEN-Akt-GSK3 kinase pathways eventually results in elevated expression and/or transcriptional activity of HIF-1 (18Richard D.E.

The interaction of HSP90 with the ligand binding domain of AhR is important for maintaining the receptor in a high affinity ligand binding and repressed conformation (28Carver L.A. Jackiw V.

Poellinger L. Pongratz I. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 2594-2607Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). As shown by in vitro pull-down assays, HSP90 can also bind HIF-1α (32Gradin K. Toftgard R. Poellinger L. Berghard A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 13511-13518Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). This observation has been confirmed by co-immunoprecipitation studies using an artificial enhanced green fluorescent protein-HIF-1α fusion protein ectopically overexpressed in heterologous COS-7 cells (33Minet E. Mottet D. Michel G. Roland I. Raes M. Remacle J. Michiels C. FEBS Lett. 1999; 460: 251-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar). However, because HSP90 is capable of binding many proteins, the functional significance of these observations remained unknown. In particular, the effect of physiological activation of HSPs by heat on HIF-1 activity has not been reported so far.We therefore investigated the impact of heat shock (as evidenced by HSP90 induction and activation) in vivo and in vitro on the regulation of cellular HIF-1α expression, protein modifications, and subcellular localization as well as HIF-1 DNA binding and trans-activation activity. Our data indicate a novel role of HSP90 in the stabilization of HIF-1α, which is not related to proteasome function or posttranslational modification of HIF-1α by phosphorylation.DISCUSSIONEarly work on hypoxia-inducible gene expression suspected mechanisms comparable with those elicited by the general stress response, most prominently represented by the heat-shock response. However, with the discovery of HIF-1 it became evident that the specific hypoxic response is distinct from the heat-shock response (38Maxwell P.H. Pugh C.W. Ratcliffe P.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 2423-2427Crossref PubMed Scopus (360) Google Scholar). Thus, we were surprised to find heat induction of HIF-1α in mice exposed to elevated temperatures. It seems unlikely that heat-induced HIF-1α expression is simply mediated by hypoxia due to an increased oxygen consumption, since the temperature effects were similar in standard polystyrol cell culture dishes and in Petriperm dishes, in which the cells grow attached to oxygen-permeable silicone membranes. As previously shown in our laboratory, this prevents hypoxic effects caused by high cell densities or increased metabolic rates (39Metzen E. Wolff M. Fandrey J. Jelkmann W. Respir. Physiol. 1995; 100: 101-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). More important, the protein pattern of HIF-1α induced by heat was clearly distinct from the pattern induced by hypoxia; while heat induced mainly the native form of HIF-1α (HIF-1αa), hypoxia induced a series of additional bands with lower electrophoretic mobilities (HIF-1αb and HIF-1αc), which were prone (HIF-1αc) or resistant (HIF-1αb) to phosphatase treatment. Although we can not fully exclude the possibility that secondary hypoxia plays an additional role for heat-induced HIF-1α induction in vivo, our data indicate that the mechanism of heat-induced HIF-1α expression in vivo appears to be similar to the mechanism found in vitro, since also the HIF-1αa form is induced by heat in vivo. Thus, heat-induced protein expression is mainly due to protein stabilization and to a lesser extent dependent on protein modifications. In line with this notion, Jewell et al. (5Jewell U.R. Kvietikova I. Scheid A. Bauer C. Wenger R.H. Gassmann M. FASEB J. 2001; 15: 1312-1314Crossref PubMed Scopus (446) Google Scholar) reported that immediately after the onset of hypoxia, the high mobility (native) form of HIF-1α became first detectable on Western blots, whereas following prolonged exposure additional (modified) forms with lower electrophoretic mobility became apparent.The treatment with the HSP90 inhibitors novobiocin or geldanamycin prevented heat-induced as well as hypoxia-induced HIF-1α expression. Geldanamycin and novobiocin specifically bind to ATP-binding pockets of HSP90, blocking the ATP-dependent maturation process of HSP90-dependent complexes in an intermediate state by interfering with the association of HSP90 with Hsc70 and finally the recruitment of the co-chaperone p23 that has been reported to stabilize the interaction between HSP90 and HSP90-regulated proteins (40Marcu M.G.

Cancer Inst. 2000; 92: 242-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (369) Google Scholar). Occupancy of the ATP binding pocket by ansamycin drugs prevents refolding of mature proteins and causes the degradation of HSP90-regulated proteins (42Whitesell L. Sutphin P. An W.G. Schulte T. Blagosklonny M.V. Neckers L. Oncogene. 1997; 14: 2809-2816Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar, 43Loo M.A. Jensen T.J. Cui L. Hou Y. Chang X.B. Riordan J.R. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 6879-6887Crossref PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar). Thus, the chaperone activity of HSP90 is involved in HIF-1α stabilization, and an increase in HSP90 protein by heat might stabilize HIF-1α even under normoxic conditions.HSP90 is a highly conserved and abundant protein in the cytosol of both eukaryotic and prokaryotic cells (22Buchner J. FASEB J. 1996; 10: 10-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (380) Google Scholar, 23Pirkkala L. Nykanen P. Sistonen L. FASEB J. 2001; 15: 1118-1131Crossref PubMed Scopus (811) Google Scholar). It represents the most abundant heat shock protein under normal conditions and is up-regulated by various stress conditions including heat. HSP90 functions as a general molecular chaperone in vitro and in vivo, acts in concert with many other heat shock and nonheat shock proteins, and shows a broad substrate specificity. The chaperone complex HSP90-p23 has impact on the regulation of a variety of bHLH transcription factors including AhR and Sim as well as various protein kinases such as pp60v-src, steroid hormone receptors, and the tumor suppressor p53 (24Kallio P.J.

Chem. 1997; 272: 18694-18701Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). Many of these proteins are activated by binding of ligands. HSP90 is thought to stabilize these proteins and maintain them in an activable form. Especially for bHLH transcription factors like AhR and Sim, the release of HSP90 appears to be required for activation, since only the repressed, non-DNA-binding forms of the receptors show interaction with HSP90. Although a protein interaction of HSP90 with HIF-1α has been described previously (33Minet E. Mottet D. Michel G. Roland I. Raes M. Remacle J. Michiels C. FEBS Lett. 1999; 460: 251-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar, 36Gradin K. McGuire J. Wenger R.H. Kvietikova I. Whitelaw M.L. Toftgard R. Tora L. Gassmann M. Poellinger L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 5221-5231Crossref PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar), the functional meaning of this interaction was not clear so far. We show for the first time that the heat-induced stabilization of HIF-1α is linked to the function of HSP90. The correlation of HSP90 and heat-induced as well as constitutive HIF-1α expression in the animal experiments suggests a general role of HSP90-mediated stabilization of HIF-1α also in vivo. In accordance with the depressing function of HSP90 for other bHLH transcription factors, the heat-induced HIF-1α was functionally inactive as demonstrated by DNA-binding and reporter gene assays as well as by the lack of target gene expression. This suggests that additional posttranslational modifications of HIF-1α are required to activate these functions.Heat induction of HIF-1α was sufficient to induce nuclear translocation of the HIF-1αa form. Concomitantly, a tremendous induction and nuclear accumulation of HSP90 was observed. Thus, it is tempting to speculate that HSP90 itself inhibited the DNA binding activity of the native HIF-1α-ARNT complex. Following hypoxic induction, however, HIF-1α becomes activated by phosphorylation (and/or other modifications), which might prevent the interaction with HSP90. Accordingly, heat did not inhibit DNA-binding or reporter gene activation under hypoxic conditions. Similar data have been reported for the function of HSP90 in glucocorticoid receptor regulation. Applying heat stress to both cell cultures or whole organisms led to considerable loss of cytosolic glucocorticoid binding capacity that coincided with a decreased amount of the glucocorticoid receptor protein present in the cytosolic fraction and its increase in the nuclei (45Anderson R.L. Kraft P.E. Bensaude O. Hahn G.M. Exp. Cell Res. 1991; 197: 100-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar, 46Sanchez E.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 17-20Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 47Cvoro A. Dundjerski J. Trajkovic D. Matic G. J. Steroid Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1998; 67: 319-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Since we were able to demonstrate a slight nuclear accumulation of HSP90 after hypoxic versus normoxic exposure at normothermic temperature, one could postulate a physiologic role of the HSP90-HIF-1α interaction for the hypoxic activation of HIF-1. In analogy to AhR and Sim, HSP90 could support the conformational maturation of HIF-1α and protect it from proteasomal degradation. This hypothesis is further substantiated by the study of Minet et al. (33Minet E. Mottet D. Michel G. Roland I. Raes M. Remacle J. Michiels C. FEBS Lett. 1999; 460: 251-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar), who demonstrated that inhibition of the function of HSP90 with geldanamycin impaired CoCl2-induced HIF-1α activation as determined by reporter gene assays in transiently transfected cells. In agreement with this model, we found that the HSP90 inhibitor geldanamycin was able to inhibit hypoxic stabilization of HIF-1α.In summary, our studies imply that HSP90 plays a functional role in HIF-1 regulation by physiologic variations of both environmental parameters, oxygen partial pressure and temperature. The hypoxia-inducible factor-1 (HIF-1)1 is a heterodimeric transcription factor composed of the two subunits HIF-1α and HIF-1β, both belonging to the basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH)-Per/arylhydrocarbon receptor (AhR) nuclear translocator (ARNT)/Sim (PAS) protein superfamily (1Wang G.L. Jiang B.H. Rue E.A. Semenza G.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 5510-5514Crossref PubMed Scopus (4974) Google Scholar). HIF-1β is identical to the previously described ARNT protein. HIF-1 is a critical regulator of the physiological adaptive response to hypoxia, since it activates genes regulating, among other processes, angiogenesis, erythropoiesis, and glucose metabolism. HIF-1 has also been described to be involved in tumor angiogenesis and ischemic diseases such as myocardial ischemia or stroke (reviewed in Refs. 2Wenger R.H. J. Exp. Biol. 2000; 203: 1253-1263Crossref PubMed Google Scholar and 3Semenza G.L. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2001; 13: 167-171Crossref PubMed Scopus (868) Google Scholar). Whereas ARNT is constitutively expressed, HIF-1α expression is induced in hypoxic cells with an exponential increase in expression as cells are exposed to decreased oxygen partial pressures. As determined in HeLa cells, the highest HIF-1α protein levels are reached at 0.5% oxygen (4Jiang B.H. Semenza G.L. Bauer C. Marti H.H. Am. J.

FASEB J. 2001; 15: 1312-1314Crossref PubMed Scopus (446) Google Scholar). Recent studies have shown that HIF-1α is modified by oxygen-dependent prolyl hydroxylation (6Jaakkola P. Mole D.R. Tian Y.M.

Further activation of HIF-1 involves nuclear translocation, dimerization with ARNT, DNA binding, and recruitment of transcriptional co-activators. These processes are regulated at least in part by posttranslational modifications. It has been demonstrated that phosphorylation of HIF-1α via the Ras/Raf-MEK-p42/44 and the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase-PTEN-Akt-GSK3 kinase pathways eventually results in elevated expression and/or transcriptional activity of HIF-1 (18Richard D.E.

EMBO J. 1993; 12: 4169-4179Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). HSP90 interacts with two different sites of AhR, one in the bHLH domain and the other in the PAS B domain (26Whitelaw M.L.

Biol. 1995; 15: 756-765Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The interaction of HSP90 with the ligand binding domain of AhR is important for maintaining the receptor in a high affinity ligand binding and repressed conformation (28Carver L.A. Jackiw V. Bradfield C.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 30109-30112Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 29Pongratz I. Mason G.G. Poellinger L. J. Biol.

A. 1995; 92: 4437-4441Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the HSP90 chaperone complex seems to regulate the intracellular localization of the AhR (31Kazlauskas A. Sundstrom S. Poellinger L. Pongratz I. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 2594-2607Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). As shown by in vitro pull-down assays, HSP90 can also bind HIF-1α (32Gradin K. Toftgard R. Poellinger L. Berghard A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 13511-13518Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). This observation has been confirmed by co-immunoprecipitation studies using an artificial enhanced green fluorescent protein-HIF-1α fusion protein ectopically overexpressed in heterologous COS-7 cells (33Minet E. Mottet D. Michel G. Roland I. Raes M. Remacle J. Michiels C. FEBS Lett. 1999; 460: 251-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar). However, because HSP90 is capable of binding many proteins, the functional significance of these observations remained unknown. In particular, the effect of physiological activation of HSPs by heat on HIF-1 activity has not been reported so far. We therefore investigated the impact of heat shock (as evidenced by HSP90 induction and activation) in vivo and in vitro on the regulation of cellular HIF-1α expression, protein modifications, and subcellular localization as well as HIF-1 DNA binding and trans-activation activity. Our data indicate a novel role of HSP90 in the stabilization of HIF-1α, which is not related to proteasome function or posttranslational modification of HIF-1α by phosphorylation.

In agreement with this model, we found that the HSP90 inhibitor geldanamycin was able to inhibit hypoxic stabilization of HIF-1α.In summary, our studies imply that HSP90 plays a functional role in HIF-1 regulation by physiologic variations of both environmental parameters, oxygen partial pressure and temperature. Early work on hypoxia-inducible gene expression suspected mechanisms comparable with those elicited by the general stress response, most prominently represented by the heat-shock response. However, with the discovery of HIF-1 it became evident that the specific hypoxic response is distinct from the heat-shock response (38Maxwell P.H. Pugh C.W. Ratcliffe P.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 2423-2427Crossref PubMed Scopus (360) Google Scholar). Thus, we were surprised to find heat induction of HIF-1α in mice exposed to elevated temperatures. It seems unlikely that heat-induced HIF-1α expression is simply mediated by hypoxia due to an increased oxygen consumption, since the temperature effects were similar in standard polystyrol cell culture dishes and in Petriperm dishes, in which the cells grow attached to oxygen-permeable silicone membranes. As previously shown in our laboratory, this prevents hypoxic effects caused by high cell densities or increased metabolic rates (39Metzen E. Wolff M. Fandrey J. Jelkmann W. Respir. Physiol. 1995; 100: 101-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). More important, the protein pattern of HIF-1α induced by heat was clearly distinct from the pattern induced by hypoxia; while heat induced mainly the native form of HIF-1α (HIF-1αa), hypoxia induced a series of additional bands with lower electrophoretic mobilities (HIF-1αb and HIF-1αc), which were prone (HIF-1αc) or resistant (HIF-1αb) to phosphatase treatment. Although we can not fully exclude the possibility that secondary hypoxia plays an additional role for heat-induced HIF-1α induction in vivo, our data indicate that the mechanism of heat-induced HIF-1α expression in vivo appears to be similar to the mechanism found in vitro, since also the HIF-1αa form is induced by heat in vivo. Thus, heat-induced protein expression is mainly due to protein stabilization and to a lesser extent dependent on protein modifications. In line with this notion, Jewell et al. (5Jewell U.R. Kvietikova I. Scheid A. Bauer C. Wenger R.H. Gassmann M. FASEB J. 2001; 15: 1312-1314Crossref PubMed Scopus (446) Google Scholar) reported that immediately after the onset of hypoxia, the high mobility (native) form of HIF-1α became first detectable on Western blots, whereas following prolonged exposure additional (modified) forms with lower electrophoretic mobility became apparent. The treatment with the HSP90 inhibitors novobiocin or geldanamycin prevented heat-induced as well as hypoxia-induced HIF-1α expression. Geldanamycin and novobiocin specifically bind to ATP-binding pockets of HSP90, blocking the ATP-dependent maturation process of HSP90-dependent complexes in an intermediate state by interfering with the association of HSP90 with Hsc70 and finally the recruitment of the co-chaperone p23 that has been reported to stabilize the interaction between HSP90 and HSP90-regulated proteins (40Marcu M.G. Chadli A. Bouhouche I. Catelli M. Neckers L.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 37181-37186Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (442) Google Scholar, 41Marcu M.G. Schulte T.W. Neckers L. J. Natl. Cancer Inst. 2000; 92: 242-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (369) Google Scholar). Occupancy of the ATP binding pocket by ansamycin drugs prevents refolding of mature proteins and causes the degradation of HSP90-regulated proteins (42Whitesell L. Sutphin P. An W.G. Schulte T. Blagosklonny M.V. Neckers L. Oncogene. 1997; 14: 2809-2816Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar, 43Loo M.A. Jensen T.J. Cui L. Hou Y. Chang X.B. Riordan J.R. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 6879-6887Crossref PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar). Thus, the chaperone activity of HSP90 is involved in HIF-1α stabilization, and an increase in HSP90 protein by heat might stabilize HIF-1α even under normoxic conditions. HSP90 is a highly conserved and abundant protein in the cytosol of both eukaryotic and prokaryotic cells (22Buchner J. FASEB J. 1996; 10: 10-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (380) Google Scholar, 23Pirkkala L. Nykanen P. Sistonen L. FASEB J. 2001; 15: 1118-1131Crossref PubMed Scopus (811) Google Scholar). It represents the most abundant heat shock protein under normal conditions and is up-regulated by various stress conditions including heat. HSP90 functions as a general molecular chaperone in vitro and in vivo, acts in concert with many other heat shock and nonheat shock proteins, and shows a broad substrate specificity. The chaperone complex HSP90-p23 has impact on the regulation of a variety of bHLH transcription factors including AhR and Sim as well as various protein kinases such as pp60v-src, steroid hormone receptors, and the tumor suppressor p53 (24Kallio P.J. Pongratz I. Gradin K. McGuire J. Poellinger L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 5667-5672Crossref PubMed Scopus (335) Google Scholar, 25Shue G. Kohtz D.S. J. Biol.

EMBO J. 1993; 12: 4169-4179Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar, 44Segnitz B. Gehring U. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 18694-18701Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). Many of these proteins are activated by binding of ligands. HSP90 is thought to stabilize these proteins and maintain them in an activable form. Especially for bHLH transcription factors like AhR and Sim, the release of HSP90 appears to be required for activation, since only the repressed, non-DNA-binding forms of the receptors show interaction with HSP90. Although a protein interaction of HSP90 with HIF-1α has been described previously (33Minet E. Mottet D. Michel G. Roland I. Raes M. Remacle J. Michiels C. FEBS Lett. 1999; 460: 251-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar, 36Gradin K. McGuire J. Wenger R.H. Kvietikova I. Whitelaw M.L. Toftgard R. Tora L. Gassmann M. Poellinger L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 5221-5231Crossref PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar), the functional meaning of this interaction was not clear so far. We show for the first time that the heat-induced stabilization of HIF-1α is linked to the function of HSP90. The correlation of HSP90 and heat-induced as well as constitutive HIF-1α expression in the animal experiments suggests a general role of HSP90-mediated stabilization of HIF-1α also in vivo. In accordance with the depressing function of HSP90 for other bHLH transcription factors, the heat-induced HIF-1α was functionally inactive as demonstrated by DNA-binding and reporter gene assays as well as by the lack of target gene expression. This suggests that additional posttranslational modifications of HIF-1α are required to activate these functions. Heat induction of HIF-1α was sufficient to induce nuclear translocation of the HIF-1αa form. Concomitantly, a tremendous induction and nuclear accumulation of HSP90 was observed. Thus, it is tempting to speculate that HSP90 itself inhibited the DNA binding activity of the native HIF-1α-ARNT complex. Following hypoxic induction, however, HIF-1α becomes activated by phosphorylation (and/or other modifications), which might prevent the interaction with HSP90. Accordingly, heat did not inhibit DNA-binding or reporter gene activation under hypoxic conditions. Similar data have been reported for the function of HSP90 in glucocorticoid receptor regulation. Applying heat stress to both cell cultures or whole organisms led to considerable loss of cytosolic glucocorticoid binding capacity that coincided with a decreased amount of the glucocorticoid receptor protein present in the cytosolic fraction and its increase in the nuclei (45Anderson R.L. Kraft P.E. Bensaude O. Hahn G.M. Exp. Cell Res. 1991; 197: 100-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar, 46Sanchez E.R. J. Biol.

Biol. 1998; 67: 319-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Since we were able to demonstrate a slight nuclear accumulation of HSP90 after hypoxic versus normoxic exposure at normothermic temperature, one could postulate a physiologic role of the HSP90-HIF-1α interaction for the hypoxic activation of HIF-1. In analogy to AhR and Sim, HSP90 could support the conformational maturation of HIF-1α and protect it from proteasomal degradation. This hypothesis is further substantiated by the study of Minet et al. (33Minet E. Mottet D. Michel G. Roland I. Raes M. Remacle J. Michiels C. FEBS Lett. 1999; 460: 251-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar), who demonstrated that inhibition of the function of HSP90 with geldanamycin impaired CoCl2-induced HIF-1α activation as determined by reporter gene assays in transiently transfected cells.

In summary, our studies imply that HSP90 plays a functional role in HIF-1 regulation by physiologic variations of both environmental parameters, oxygen partial pressure and temperature. We thank J.

Here we show that doxorubicin (Dox), a drug used in antitumor therapy, triggered a marked accumulation of p53 and induced CD95gene expression and apoptosis in proliferating human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs). Transfection and site-directed mutagenesis experiments using the CD95 promoter fused to an intronic enhancer indicated the requirement for a p53 site for Dox-induced promoter activation. Furthermore, the p53 inhibitor pifithrin-α (PFT-α) blocked both promoter inducibility and protein up-regulation of CD95 in response to Dox. Up-regulated CD95 in Dox-treated cells was functional in eliciting apoptosis upon incubation of the cells with an agonistic CD95 antibody. However, Dox-mediated apoptosis was independent of CD95/CD95L interaction. The analysis of apoptosis in the presence of PFT-α and benzyloxycarbonyl-Val-Ala-dl-Asp-fluoromethylketone revealed that both p53 and caspase activation are required for Dox-mediated apoptosis of HUVECs. Finally, Dox triggered Bcl-2 down-regulation, cytochrome c release from mitochondria, and the activation of caspases 9 and 3, suggesting the involvement of a mitochondrially operated pathway of apoptosis. These results highlight the role of p53 in the response of primary endothelial cells to genotoxic drugs and may reveal a novel mechanism underlying the antitumoral properties of Dox, related to its ability to induce apoptosis in proliferating endothelial cells.

Dox has been used to treat a variety of cancers, and, as in the case of other DNA-damaging agents, it induces the accumulation of the p53 tumor suppressor protein. This results in cell cycle arrest and may lead to apoptosis (15.Clarke A.R. Purdie C.A. Harrison D.J. Morris R.G. Bird C.C. Hooper M.L. Wyllie A.H.

Despite this, very little is known about the mechanisms that regulate CD95 gene expression in endothelial cells. To address this issue we have searched for stimuli that induce CD95 expression and found that Dox promoted apoptosis in human primary endothelial cells and was a potent inducer of CD95. In these cells, Dox induced a sustained accumulation of p53, which regulated both CD95 gene expression and the apoptotic process. However, although Dox-induced CD95 protein was able to trigger apoptotic signals, it was not involved in the apoptosis induced by the drug. Our findings show that Dox induced apoptosis through a mitochondrially operated p53-dependent pathway, and it is noteworthy that significant apoptosis was only seen in subconfluent endothelial cells These findings support a major role for p53 in the regulation of CD95 and apoptosis of primary endothelial cells exposed to genotoxic drugs.The preferential effect of Dox inducing apoptosis on proliferating endothelial cells may reveal a novel mechanism underlying the antitumoral activity of Dox. If Dox is able to selectively trigger apoptosis in proliferating cells “in vivo,” this could result in selective killing by the drug of endothelial cells involved in neovascularization, including that required for the growth and dissemination of tumors. We also discuss the potential advantages and disadvantages that would be derived from the use of p53 inhibitors for the prevention of the side effects of Dox in wound healing or ovulation.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESCell Culture and ReagentsHUVECs were isolated from umbilical veins as previously described (26.Munoz C.

The cells were used between passages 4 and 9. J-HM1–2.2 Jurkat cells expressing the human muscarinic acetylcholine type 1 (HM1) receptor were grown in RPMI 1640 medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% FCS. Doxorubicin (Dox), the calcium ionophore A23187, phorbol-12,13-dibutyrate, 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenyl-indole, and carbamylcholine chloride (Carbachol) were purchased from the Sigma Chemical Co. The agonistic anti-CD95 CH11 mAb (IgM) was purchased from Upstate Biotechnology (Lake Placid, NY). Antagonistic anti-CD95 DX2 mAb (IgG1), anti-CD95 ligand NOK-1 mAb (IgG1), and the matrix metalloprotease inhibitor KB8301 were from PharMingen. The generic caspase inhibitor benzyloxycarbonyl-Val-Ala-dl-Asp-fluoromethylketone (z-VAD-FMK) was from Bachem, and the specific p53 inhibitor pifithrin-α (PFT-α) was from Calbiochem. TNF-α (3.2 × 107 units/mg) was from Wichem.Determination of Apoptotic CellsSubconfluent HUVECs were plated in 24-well tissue culture plates (4 × 104cells/plate) precoated with 0.5% gelatin. Attached cells were detached from the culture plates with a trypsin solution containing 3 mm EDTA (tryspin/EDTA). These cells were then collected together with floating cells, washed once with cold phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), and incubated with 200 μl of staining buffer (0.1% sodium citrate, 0.02 mg/ml RNase, 0.3% Nonidet P-40, 0.05 mg/ml propidium iodide) for 30 min on ice. Then, 300 μl of staining buffer (without RNase and propidium iodide) was added and hypodiploid apoptotic cells were determined by cytofluorometric analysis of DNA content in a FACScan cytofluorometer (Becton Dickinson).Flow CytometryHUVECs were plated in six-well tissue culture plates (3 × 105 cells/plate) precoated with 0.5% gelatin. They were then treated as described under “Results,” detached with 3 mm EDTA, washed once with cold PBS, and then incubated with one of the following antibodies for 30 min on ice: anti-CD95 mouse monoclonal IgG antibody DX2 (1 μg/ml), the anti-CD95L mAb NOK-1 (IgG1) (2 μg/ml), or the anti-ICAM-1 mAb RR1/1. After this incubation, cells were washed once with cold PBS and then incubated with fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated rabbit anti-mouse Ig (1/50, Dako) for 30 min on ice. Cells were again washed with cold PBS and resuspended in PBS. Flow cytometry was performed on a FACScan cytometer and analyzed with CellQuest software (Becton Dickinson).mRNA AnalysisTotal RNA was isolated from attached HUVECs with the Ultraspect system (Biotecx Laboratories, Inc), in accordance with the manufacturer's instructions. cDNAs were synthesized using an RNA PCR kit (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) from 2 to 4 μg of total RNA. PCR reactions were performed using the following primers: human CD95 sense, 5′-GGGTGAAGAGAAAGGAAGTACAG-3′, human CD95 antisense, 5′-CCTTGGAGGCAGAATCATGA-3′; human CD95L sense, 5′-CAGGACTGAGAAGAAGTAAAACCG-3′, human CD95L antisense, 5′-CTCCAAAGATGATGCTGTG-3′; human β-actin sense, 5′-TGACGGGGTCACCCACACTGTGCCCATCTA-3′, and human β-actin antisense, 5′-CTAGAAGCATTTGCGGTGGACGATGGAGGG-3′. The PCR products obtained were 615, 440, and 661 bp, respectively. Cycle conditions of the PCR reactions were 60 s at 95 °C, 60 s at 55 °C, and 60 s at 72 °C for 35, 40, or 25 cycles for CD95, CD95L, or β-actin, respectively. Amplified cDNAs were separated by agarose gel electrophoresis, and bands were visualized by ethidium bromide staining.Plasmid Constructs and Transient-transfection AssaysGenomic fragments of the CD95 upstream regulatory region spanning 391 bp from the ATG site of the CD95 gene was amplified by PCR of human genomic DNA. These sequences were then cloned into the BglII site of the pXP2 luciferase reporter plasmid to generate the pCD95 391 Luc construct. This plasmid was used as the parental construct to generate the pI-CD95 391 Luc by cloning a 500-bp enhancer region from the first intron of the CD95 gene (17.Muller M. Wilder S. Bannasch D. Israeli D. Lehlbach K. Li-Weber M. Friedman S.L. Galle P.R. Stremmel W. Oren M. Krammer P.H. J. Exp. Med. 1998; 188: 2033-2045Crossref PubMed Scopus (724) Google Scholar) into the BamHI site of the pXP2 polylinker (upstream of the promoter region). The 500-bp fragment was also amplified from genomic cDNA using the primers ENHFAS5′: cgggtccGTGAGCCCTCTCCTGCCCGGGT and ENHFAS3′: cgggatcCCTGAAGGCTGCAGGCTCTCTCC. The pmI-CD95 391 Luc plasmid, harboring mutations within the p53 sites of the intronic enhancer, was generated by site-directed mutagenesis of the pI-CD95 391 Luc with a QuikChange kit from Stratagene. Mutations were introduced using the following sense oligonucleotides: 5′-AACTCCTGGAGGGGCCCTGACAAG-3′ and 5′-CCCTGACAATAAAAGCCAAAGGT-3′ and their respective antisense oligonucleotides (mutated nucleotides are in boldface). The pBHA-941Luc plasmid including a 941-bp fragment of the upstream regulatory region of the ICAM-1 promoter has been described previously (26.Munoz C. Castellanos M.C. Alfranca A. Vara A.

The reporter plasmid pG13 Luc (p53 Luc), containing 13 tandem copies of the p53-responsive element, was kindly donated by Dr. B. Vogelstein (Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, Baltimore, MD) (27.el-Deiry W.S. Kern S.E. Pietenpol J.A. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Nat. Genet. 1992; 1: 45-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (1736) Google Scholar). The pCDNA3-hBCL-2 plasmid, containing the cDNA for the human Bcl-2 human gene, was kindly provided by Dr. Jacint Boix (University of Lleida, Spain). The pEGFP-spectrin expression vector was kindly provided by Dr. R. F. Kalejta (Princeton University, Princeton, NJ) (28.Kalejta R.F. Shenk T. Beavis A.J. Cytometry. 1997; 29: 286-291Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). The pKBF-Luc construct includes a trimer of the NF-κB motif from the H-2Kb gene, placed upstream of a herpes simplex virus thymidine kinase minimal promoter driving the luciferase reporter gene (29.Yano O. Kanellopoulos J. Le Kieran M. Bail O. Israel A. Kourilsky P. EMBO J. 1987; 6: 3317-3324Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar).For transient transfection experiments, HUVECs were plated in 100-mm tissue culture dishes (1.5 × 106 cells/plate) the day before transfection. Cells were transfected in 4 ml of Dulbecco's minimal essential medium containing 10% FCS, with 10 μg of the indicated luciferase reporter plasmid by the calcium phosphate procedure as previously described (30.Armesilla A.L.

Briefly, cells were incubated with precipitated DNA until a mild cytopathic effect was observed (4.5–9 h). Cells were then washed twice with PBS and detached with trypsin/EDTA from the culture dishes. After centrifugation, cells were resuspended in OPTI-MEM (Invitrogen) containing 0.5% FCS, and split among six-well (35-mm) tissue culture plates precoated with 0.5% gelatin. After 24 h, transfected cells incubated with or without z-VAD-FMK were treated with different agents for an additional period of 14 h. Cells were then detached with trypsin/EDTA, washed with PBS, and lysed. Luciferase activity was measured according to the instructions of the Luciferase System kit (Promega) in a Sirius luminometer (Berthold, Germany). The expression of Renilla luciferase was used as an internal control for the efficiency of transfection. A total of 0.1 μg of Renilla luciferase expression vector pRLCM (Promega) was used in co-transfection experiments. In these experiments, 1/10 of cells co-transfected with both types of luciferase plasmid were plated in 24-well tissue culture plates, and the cells were treated in the same way as those plated on six-well tissue culture plates. After lysis with passive lysis buffer, Renilla luciferase activity was measured with the Dual luciferase assay kit (Promega).Subcellular Fractionation and Western Blot AnalysisAfter treatment, subconfluent attached HUVECs grown in 35-mm culture dishes were detached with trypsin/EDTA and collected together with floating cells. They were then washed with cold PBS, resuspended in 40 μl of Laemmli buffer, and sonicated. For the detection of cytochrome c release, cells were detached, and washed with PBS, and the pellet was resuspended in 50 μl of cold lysis buffer (25 mm Tris-HCl pH 6.8, 250 mm sucrose, 1 mm EDTA, 0.005% digitonin, 1 mm DTT, 0.1 mm PMSF, 1 mm benzamidine, and 1 μg/ml each of aprotinin, leupeptin, and pepstatin) for 30 s on ice. Lysates were centrifuged, and the supernatant containing the cytosolic fraction was removed and separated from mitochondria. Cytosolic proteins were mixed with Laemmli buffer and sonicated. For detection of p53 protein, 10 μg of whole cell extract were resolved on 8% SDS-PAGE minigels. For all other proteins, 60 μg of extract (cytosolic or whole) was resolved on 12% SDS-PAGE minigels. Proteins were transferred onto Immobilon membranes (Millipore), and the blots were blocked with 5% w/v skimmed milk in PBS/0.05% Tween 20 (PBST) for 1 h at room temperature. Blots were then washed three times for 10 min with PBST and incubated in PSBT, 1% w/v milk at 4 °C overnight with the indicated antibodies: anti-Bcl-2 (1:500, DAKO), anti-caspase-3 (1:1000, New England BioLabs), anti-PARP (1:4000, Roche Molecular Biochemicals), anti-caspase-9 (1:250, New England BioLabs), anti-p53 (1:3000, Ab-7,Calbiochem), or anti-cytochrome c mAb (1 μg/ml, PharMingen). Blots were again washed three times for 10 min with PBST and then incubated with the corresponding horseradish peroxidase-coupled goat anti-rabbit or anti-mouse secondary antibody (1:2000, DAKO). After three washes with PBST and once with PBS, blots were visualized with the Amersham Biosciences, Inc. enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) detection reagents. Detection of α-tubulin (anti-α-tubulin, 1:40000, Sigma) was used to control for loading of protein.Nuclear Extracts and EMSAsFor nuclear protein extraction, HUVECs grown in 150-mm dishes were detached and then lysed with 400 μl of hypotonic buffer (10 mm HEPES (pH 7.6), 10 mm KCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, 0.1 mm EGTA, 1 mm DTT, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (PMSF), 10 mm Na2MoO4, 2 μg/ml each of pepstatin, leupeptin, and aprotinin, 0.75 mmspermidine, 0.15 mm spermine, and 1 μg/ml pepstatin) containing 0.6% of Nonidet P-40. Nuclei were then centrifuged and incubated in 50 μl of buffer C (20 mm HEPES (pH 7.6), 0.4 mm KCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm DTT, 0.5 mm PMSF, 10 mmNa2MoO4, and 2 μg/ml each of pepstatin, leupeptin, and aprotinin) for 30 min in a rocking platform. Nuclei were centrifuged at 15,000 × g for 10 min, and the supernatants containing the nuclear extracts were immediately stored at −80 °C. The protein concentration was quantified by the Bradford procedure.Electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSAs) were performed by incubating nuclear proteins (2–3 μg) with 1 μg of poly(dI-dC) DNA carrier and 3 μl of 5× DNA binding buffer (10% (w/v) polyvinylethanol, 12.5% (v/v) glycerol, 50 mm Tris (pH 8), 2.5 mm EDTA, 2.5 mm DTT) in a final volume of 15 μl on ice for 10 min. Then 2 μl (1 ng/μl) of32P-labeled double-stranded oligonucleotide (108 cpm/μg) was added to the reaction mixture, and it was incubated at room temperature for 30 min. For competition experiments, a 30-fold molar excess of unlabeled oligonucleotide was added before the addition of the probe. Where indicated, nuclear extracts were incubated at room temperature for 10 min before addition of the probe with the following antibodies: 2–4 μl of anti-p53 antiserum PAb421; 1 μl of antiserum 1226, raised against the p65 NFκB subunit; or 1 μl of antiserum 1141, raised against the p50 NFκB subunit. DNA-protein complexes were resolved by electrophoresis on 4% nondenaturing polyacrylamide gels. The sequences of the oligonucleotides (5′ to 3′) used in these experiments were as follows: ctagCTCCCCAACCCGGGCGTTCCCCAGCGAGG (human NFκB sequence −306 to −278 of the 391-bp fragment of CD95 promoter (32.Chan H.

Memon S.A. Birrer M.J. Ashwell J.D. Zacharchuk C.M. J. Immunol. 1994; 153: 2046-2051PubMed Google Scholar). The pGL3 Basic vector (2.1 μg) was added as a DNA carrier in a total volume of 0.140 ml, and transfection was performed by the calcium phosphate procedure in 35-mm tissue culture dishes. After treatment, the cells were washed with PBS, fixed with 3.7% formaldehyde for 15 min, and washed for a further 10 min with 50 mm NH4Cl blocking solution in PBS. Cells were then washed with PBS, permeabilized with a 0.1% Triton X-100 for 10 min, washed again with PBS, and stained with 1 μg/ml 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenyl-indole solution for 2 min. The cells were examined under a fluorescence microscope, and GFP-positive cells were scored after counting a minimum of 1000 total cells for each condition. The efficiency of transfection in Bcl-2- and β-galactosidase-expressing cells, determined in aliquots of transfected cells just before the addition of Dox, was similar (10–12%).Data AnalysesData are presented as means ± S.E. of several determinations. Differences between groups were tested for significance using Student's t test. Analysis of cell cycle by flow cytometry was performed by counting a total population of at least 5000 cells. In these assays similar results were obtained in at least three independent experiments, and the significance determined by the χ2 test.RESULTSDoxorubicin Induces Apoptosis in Subconfluent HUVECsPrevious studies have shown that different genotoxic drugs induce apoptosis in many types of cells (34.Fulda S.

To analyze whether Dox affected the viability of primary endothelial cells, we performed FACS analysis on propidium iodide-stained HUVECs and determined the fraction of hypodiploid apoptotic cells following Dox treatment. These experiments showed the presence of apoptotic cells after 36-h treatment, with a further increase by 48 h. In addition, this cell cycle analysis demonstrated a marked accumulation of Dox-treated cells in the G2/M phase after a 24-h treatment (Fig. 1A). Because we observed variability in the percentage of apoptotic cells induced by Dox in different experiments, we analyzed whether cell confluence could influence the sensitivity of HUVECs to Dox. As shown in Fig. 1B, cell confluence significantly affected the strength of Dox-mediated apoptosis in HUVECs. Dox failed to induce apoptosis of confluent cells (100%) after a 30-h treatment, and only a slight increase in the number of sub-G1 apoptotic cells (10–12%) was observed by 48 h under these conditions. However, in cells plated at low cell density (40% confluence) apoptosis was observed after 30 h, and an extensive number of sub-G1apoptotic cells (up to 70%) was detected after 48 h (Fig. 1B).Doxorubicin Induces CD95 Expression and Apoptosis through a p53-dependent Mechanism in HUVECsDox has been shown to up-regulate CD95 expression in a number of cells that can become sensitized to death through CD95/CD95L interactions (34.Fulda S.

https://openalex.org/W2015136689,"The formation of multimeric complexes by membrane-type 1 matrix metalloproteinase (MT1-MMP) may facilitate its autocatalytic inactivation or proMMP-2 activation on the cell surface. To characterize these processes, we expressed various glutathione S-transferase/MT1-MMP fusion proteins in human HT-1080 fibrosarcoma cells and SV40-transformed lung fibroblasts and analyzed their effects on MT1-MMP activity and potential homophilic interactions. We report here that MT1-MMP is expressed on the cell surface as oligomeric 200–240-kDa complexes containing both the active 60-kDa and autocatalytically processed 43-kDa species. Overexpression of a glutathione S-transferase/MT1-MMP fusion protein containing the transmembrane and cytoplasmic domains of MT1-MMP inhibited the phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate-induced autocatalytic cleavage of endogenous MT1-MMP to the 43-kDa species, but not proMMP-2 activation. On the other hand, a similar fusion protein with the hemopexin, transmembrane, and cytoplasmic domains inhibited proMMP-2 activation in a dominant-negative fashion. These results suggest that both the autocatalytic cleavage of MT1-MMP and proMMP-2 activation may be regulated by oligomerization through the cytoplasmic and hemopexin domains. Indeed, either domain, when attached to the cell membrane by a transmembrane domain, formed stable homophilic complexes. Copurification of MT1-MMP with these fusion proteins correlated with their cell-surface co-localization. Thus, MT1-MMP oligomerization through the hemopexin, transmembrane, and cytoplasmic domains controls its catalytic activity. The formation of multimeric complexes by membrane-type 1 matrix metalloproteinase (MT1-MMP) may facilitate its autocatalytic inactivation or proMMP-2 activation on the cell surface.

Cell. 1997; 91: 439-442Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1132) Google Scholar). Either excessive or deficient proteolysis is associated with a number of pathological conditions. For example, during tumor invasion and metastasis, neoplastic cells utilize proteolytic and invasive mechanisms in a spatially and temporally controlled, but abnormally regulated fashion (2Stetler-Stevenson W.G. Yu A.E. Semin. Cancer Biol. 2001; 11: 143-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (358) Google Scholar). In normal tissues, a considerable molar excess of proteinase inhibitors either derived from plasma or secreted by the same tissue cells protects the surrounding ECM from degradation (3Sternlicht M.D. Werb Z. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2001; 17: 463-516Crossref PubMed Scopus (3226) Google Scholar). Focal proteolytic activity may be achieved when proteinases are compartmentalized and activated in the immediate pericellular environment where proteinase inhibitors have limited access. Thus, cell-surface localization of proteinases via a transmembrane domain or binding to cell-surface receptors represents an important regulatory mechanism to target and concentrate proteolytic activity. Membrane-type matrix metalloproteinases are a subset of MMPs that are associated with cell membranes by type I or II transmembrane domains or by a glycosylphosphatidylinositol anchor (4Nagase H.

Rabbit polyclonal antibodies against the hinge region of MT1-MMP (Ab815) were from Chemicon International, Inc. (Temecula, CA). Affinity-purified rabbit polyclonal antibodies against synthetic peptides corresponding to the intracellular domain of MT1-MMP (Ab-2) or the catalytic domain (amino acids 155–177) of MT1-MMP (Ab-3) have been described (21Lehti K.

Human HT-1080 fibrosarcoma cells (CCL-121, American Type Culture Collection, Manassas, VA), human embryonic lung fibroblasts (CCL-137, American Type Culture Collection), and SV40-transformed human WI-38 lung fibroblasts (VA-13, CCL-75.1) were cultivated and treated with chemicals (20 nm PMA, 50 μg/ml ConA, and 1 μm BB-3103) as described (27Lehti K. Lohi J. Valtanen H. Keski-Oja J. Biochem. J. 1998; 334: 345-353Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). Cell-conditioned media and cell lysates were prepared as described (27Lehti K. Lohi J. Valtanen H. Keski-Oja J. Biochem. J. 1998; 334: 345-353Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). When a low background of endogenous MT1-MMP was desired, the transfection experiments were carried out in VA-13 cells, which express significantly lower levels of endogenous MT1-MMP. In studies in which the function of endogenous MT1-MMP was analyzed, we used mainly HT-1080 cells, which express easily detectable levels of the protein. The cloning of constructs ΔCyt and ΔTM as well as full-length MT1-MMP cDNA has been described (7Pei D. Weiss S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 9135-9140Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (364) Google Scholar, 21Lehti K. Valtanen H. Wickstrom S. Lohi J. Keski-Oja J. J. Biol.

Protein Expression Purif. 2000; 19: 66-73Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). A 801-bp fragment corresponding to coding sequence forSchistosoma japonicum GST was amplified by PCR using the pAcSecG2T baculovirus transfer vector (Pharmingen, San Diego, CA) as a template and ligated to the pSignal eukaryotic expression vector (31Saharinen J. Taipale J. Keski-Oja J. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 245-253Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar) derived from pcDNA3 (Invitrogen), generating the pc3GST plasmid encoding GST. Fragments of MT1-MMP cDNA (bases 1433–1906 and 1005–1906) were amplified by PCR and cloned into the pc3GST plasmid. The resulting ΔCat/Pex and ΔCat constructs encode non-catalytic fusion proteins of GST and amino acid residues 296–582 and 438–582 of MT1-MMP, respectively (illustrated in Fig.1). For TM/Cyt, a fragment containing bases 1692–1868 (corresponding to amino acids 525–582) of MT1-MMP and a hemagglutinin epitope sequence at the 5′-end was amplified by PCR and ligated to pSignal. All constructs were verified by sequencing. Cells were cultured in six-well plates until they reached 50–80% confluence and transfected using 2 μg of plasmid DNA and 5 μl of FuGENE 6 transfection reagent (Roche Molecular Biochemicals, Mannheim, Germany) for each transfection according to the manufacturer's instructions. Stable transfectants were selected with 0.6 mg/ml G418 (Invitrogen) in complete medium. Expression of recombinant MT1-MMPs by transfected cell clones was analyzed by immunoblotting. SDS-PAGE was carried out using 4–15% gradient or 7.5 and 10% standard Laemmli polyacrylamide gels (Bio-Rad). The proteins were then transferred to nitrocellulose membranes, and their immunodetection was performed as described (26Lohi J. Lehti K. Westermarck J. Kahari V.M. Keski-Oja J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 239: 239-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). Aliquots of the cell-conditioned medium were analyzed by gelatin zymography and reverse zymography as described (26Lohi J. Lehti K. Westermarck J. Kahari V.M. Keski-Oja J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 239: 239-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). Cells were cultured on glass coverslips, treated with PMA and BB-3103, washed with phosphate-buffered saline, and fixed. The cells were then labeled with the indicated anti-MT1-MMP or anti-GST antibodies followed by rhodamine- or fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated secondary antibodies (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, Inc., West Grove, PA), and the fluorescence images were obtained as described (21Lehti K. Valtanen H. Wickstrom S. Lohi J. Keski-Oja J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 15006-15013Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). Cell-surface biotinylation and metabolic labeling were carried out as described (27Lehti K. Lohi J. Valtanen H. Keski-Oja J. Biochem. J. 1998; 334: 345-353Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). For cross-linking experiments, metabolically labeled (50 μCi/ml [35S]methionine) or surface-labeled (0.2 mg/ml sulfosuccinimidobiotin) cells were incubated with the non-permeant thiol-cleavable cross-linker 3,3′-dithiobis(sulfosuccinimidyl propionate) (1 mm) for 1 h on ice, washed, and lysed. Aliquots of the lysates were subjected to immunoprecipitation with Ab-2 (raised against the cytoplasmic domain of MT1-MMP), followed by SDS-PAGE under nonreducing or reducing (50–100 mm dithiothreitol) conditions and detection by fluorography or horseradish peroxidase-conjugated streptavidin as described (27Lehti K. Lohi J. Valtanen H. Keski-Oja J. Biochem. J. 1998; 334: 345-353Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). Alternatively, the cell-surface proteins were cross-linked with the non-cleavable cross-linker bis(sulfosuccinimidyl) suberate (0.5 mg/ml). The cells were then washed and lysed, and aliquots of cell lysates were fractionated by SDS-PAGE under reducing conditions and analyzed by immunoblotting as indicated. To analyze the processing time courses of cell surface-biotinylated MT1-MMP proteins, the cells were surface-biotinylated as described above, shifted to 37 °C for increasing time periods (0–180 min) to allow processing, lysed, and subjected to immunoprecipitation. For GST pull-down analyses, the non-catalytic GST/MT1-MMP fusion proteins were captured from the cell lysates with glutathione-Sepharose and washed. The bound proteins were eluted with Laemmli sample buffer, fractionated by SDS-PAGE under nonreducing or reducing conditions, and analyzed by immunoblotting with anti-MT1-MMP or anti-GST antibodies. Aliquots of cell lysates corresponding to equal number of cells were used for SDS-PAGE, immunoprecipitation, and GST pull-down analysis. To test the hypothesis that MT1-MMP functions through a multimeric complex, we first analyzed cell-surface MT1-MMP by biotinylation and cross-linking with non-permeant reagents, followed by immunoprecipitation and detection with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated streptavidin (27Lehti K. Lohi J. Valtanen H. Keski-Oja J. Biochem. J. 1998; 334: 345-353Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). On the HT-1080 cell surface, cross-linked endogenous MT1-MMP was detected under nonreducing conditions as 200–240-kDa complexes (Fig.2 A, upper panel,lane 1). PMA treatment or MT1-MMP overexpression resulted in increased levels of the ∼200-kDa complexes (Fig. 2 A,upper panel, lanes 2–4). Minor protein bands of ∼150 kDa were also detectable under these conditions. In contrast, cross-linked endogenous MT1-MMP on the surface of CCL-137 fibroblasts appeared to be predominantly in ∼150-kDa complexes with or without PMA treatment (Fig. 2 A, upper panel, lanes 5 and 6), which are incapable of activating proMMP-2 (26Lohi J. Lehti K. Westermarck J. Kahari V.M. Keski-Oja J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 239: 239-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar, 27Lehti K. Lohi J. Valtanen H. Keski-Oja J. Biochem. J. 1998; 334: 345-353Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). Dissociation of the cross-linked complexes by reduction revealed that the cell-surface complexes of PMA-treated or MT1-MMP-overexpressing HT-1080 cells were composed of both the active 60-kDa and proteolytically inactive 43-kDa species (Fig. 2 A,lower panel, lanes 2–4), arguing that these MT1-MMP species are present on the cell surface as high molecular mass complexes. To resolve the composition of these complexes, we labeled MT1-MMP-overexpressing HT-1080 cells with [35S]methionine and performed cross-linking and immunoprecipitation as described above. We then fractionated the precipitated proteins by SDS-PAGE (7.5%) under nonreducing conditions and subsequently subjected a gel lane to a second SDS-PAGE (10%) under reducing conditions. In addition to the 200–240-kDa complexes, the precipitates contained 63-, 60-, and 43-kDa species representing the pro-, active, and inactive MT1-MMP monomers, presumably from intracellular compartments that are inaccessible to cross-linking (Fig. 2 B, horizontal lane,−DTT). Reduction caused dissociation of the cross-linked complexes mainly to the 60- and 43-kDa monomeric forms of MT1-MMP (Fig.2 B, +DTT). The 60- and 43-kDa forms were released from the ∼240-kDa complexes, whereas the ∼200-kDa complexes consisted mainly of the inactive 43-kDa forms (Fig. 2 B). No other major protein bands were detected from the dissociated complexes. These data suggest that MT1-MMP molecules assemble into homo-oligomeric complexes on the HT-1080 cell surface, where the 43-kDa forms are generated. Identification of MT1-MMP oligomers on the cell surface led us to hypothesize that interactions between cytoplasmic or extracellular domains of adjacent MT1-MMP molecules could regulate the autocatalytic intermolecular processing in trans. To test this hypothesis, we designed GST fusion constructs encoding N-terminally truncated non-catalytic MT1-MMP mutants (Fig. 1). All functional extracellular domains were deleted from ΔCat/Pex, which contains amino acid residues 438–582, corresponding to the transmembrane and cytoplasmic domains of MT1-MMP fused to the C terminus of GST. A similarly constructed fusion protein (ΔCat) contains residues 296–582 of MT1-MMP, corresponding to the hinge, hemopexin-like, transmembrane, and cytoplasmic domains fused to GST (Fig. 1). The plasmids coding for ΔCat/Pex and ΔCat and a control plasmid coding for GST were transfected into VA-13 and HT-1080 cells, and stable cell clones were generated by G418 selection and dilution cloning. Positive cell clones were identified by immunoblotting. Expression of TIMP-2 and MMP-2 was examined by reverse and direct gelatin zymography, respectively (data not shown). Three independent clones for each construct, which expressed similar levels of TIMP-2 and MMP-2, were used in the experiments. To induce autocatalytic processing of endogenous MT1-MMP to the 43-kDa forms, we treated VA-13 cells and stable VA-13 cell clones expressing GST, ΔCat/Pex, or ΔCat with PMA. We purified these GST/MT1-MMP fusion proteins using glutathione-Sepharose and characterized glutathione-Sepharose-bound and -unbound fractions of the cell lysates by immunoblotting with Ab-2 (raised against the cytoplasmic domain) (Fig. 3 A, lanes 2–8). Ab-2 detects both endogenous MT1-MMP and the fusion proteins. GST was detected using anti-GST antibodies (Fig.3 A, lane 1). The ΔCat/Pex and ΔCat proteins bound to glutathione-Sepharose migrated as ∼42- and 65-kDa protein bands, respectively (Fig. 3 A, lanes 3 and4). In the lysates of PMA-treated control cells and cells expressing GST, endogenous MT1-MMP was detected as active 60-kDa and inactive 43-kDa forms (Fig. 3 A, lanes 5 and8). In contrast, overexpression of either of the mutants prevented PMA-induced processing of endogenous 60-kDa MT1-MMP to the 43-kDa forms (Fig. 3 A, lanes 6 and 7). Low levels of ΔCat/Pex migrating right below the 43-kDa form and ΔCat migrating just above the 60-kDa form of MT1-MMP were retained in the corresponding glutathione-Sepharose-adsorbed cell lysates (Fig.3 A, lanes 6 and 7). To further analyze the effects of ΔCat/Pex on the processing of cell-surface MT1-MMP, we performed a time course experiment. Cell-surface proteins were labeled with sulfosuccinimidobiotin on ice, and the cells were shifted to 37 °C for up to 180 min to allow processing of biotinylated proteins (Fig. 3 B). At the indicated time points, the cells were lysed, and the lysates were immunoprecipitated with Ab-2. As described previously (27Lehti K. Lohi J. Valtanen H. Keski-Oja J. Biochem. J. 1998; 334: 345-353Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar), control cells expressed MT1-MMP as the 60-kDa mature form on the cell surface (Fig. 3 B, upper left panel). PMA treatment caused processing of this form to the N-terminally cleaved 43-kDa species within 40 min (Fig. 3 B, lower left panel). In contrast, the majority of the 60-kDa species remained unprocessed in cells expressing the ΔCat/Pex mutant under similar conditions (Fig.3 B, upper and lower right panels). Together, these results indicate that overexpression of the transmembrane/cytoplasmic domains is sufficient to interfere with the processing of MT1-MMP to the inactive ∼43-kDa form. We have reported previously that the autocatalytic processing of MT1-MMP to the 43-kDa form correlates with proMMP-2 activation in fibroblastic cells (26Lohi J. Lehti K. Westermarck J. Kahari V.M. Keski-Oja J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 239: 239-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar,27Lehti K. Lohi J. Valtanen H. Keski-Oja J. Biochem. J. 1998; 334: 345-353Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). The inhibition of the autocatalytic processing by ΔCat/Pex and ΔCat suggested that these mutants could interfere also with MT1-MMP-mediated proMMP-2 activation. To test this hypothesis, we treated HT-1080 cells overexpressing these mutants with PMA or ConA and analyzed their impact on proMMP-2 activation by zymography. PMA- or ConA-treated HT-1080 cells converted proMMP-2 to the intermediate 64-kDa and active 62-kDa forms as expected (Fig.4, lanes 5 and 6). Unexpectedly, ΔCat/Pex fusion protein expression had only a minimal effect on PMA-induced proMMP-2 activation: it affected only the second autocatalytic cleavage of the intermediate 64-kDa form that leads to the generation of the fully activated 62-kDa enzyme (Fig. 4, lane 2 versus lane 5). However, the ΔCat fusion protein, which also contains the hemopexin domain, completely prevented MT1-MMP-mediated proMMP-2 activation in PMA-treated cells (Fig. 4,lane 8). In contrast, the ΔCat mutant failed to inhibit proMMP-2 activation in ConA-treated cells (Fig. 4, lane 9), presumably because ConA stimulates clustering of cell-surface glycoproteins, including MT1-MMP. Because competitive inhibition of MT1-MMP hemopexin domain interactions by the ΔCat mutant inhibited PMA-induced proMMP-2 activation, we consider these interactions critical for proMMP-2 activation. To assess whether ΔCat/Pex and ΔCat interact directly with endogenous MT1-MMP, we purified the GST fusion proteins from ΔCat/Pex- and ΔCat-expressing HT-1080 cells using glutathione-Sepharose. The bound proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE under reducing and nonreducing conditions and analyzed by immunoblotting. We used anti-GST antibodies to detect only the fusion proteins, Ab-2 (raised against the cytoplasmic domain of MT1-MMP) to detect both fusion proteins and membrane-bound MT1-MMP species (data not shown), Ab815 to detect ΔCat mutants and endogenous MT1-MMP, and Ab-3 to detect only endogenous MT1-MMP. Treatment of the cells with PMA or ConA had minor effects on the levels of purified ΔCat/Pex (Fig.5 A, lanes 1–4). However, endogenous MT1-MMP was copurified with ΔCat/Pex in PMA- or ConA-treated cells (Fig. 5 A, lanes 6–8), but not in untreated cells (lane 5). In contrast, endogenous MT1-MMP was copurified with ΔCat under all conditions tested (Fig.5 B, lanes 1–5, Ab815 andAb-3). PMA treatment slightly enhanced the copurification of endogenous MT1-MMP (Fig. 5 B, lane 2,Ab815 and Ab-3), whereas simultaneous treatment with PMA and BB-3103 significantly enhanced the levels of both ΔCat and copurified endogenous MT1-MMP (lane 4). From these results, we concluded that interactions of both the transmembrane/cytoplasmic and hemopexin domains regulate MT1-MMP oligomerization. Under nonreducing conditions, ΔCat/Pex and ΔCat migrated mainly as ∼90- and 130-kDa bands, respectively, corresponding to disulfide-bonded dimers (Fig. 5 A,lower panel, lanes 1–4; for ΔCat, data not shown). A minor ∼100-kDa band was detected above the 90-kDa ΔCat/Pex dimers by anti-GST antibodies in PMA- and ConA-treated cells (Fig. 5 A, lower panel, lanes 2–4), in parallel to the detection of endogenous MT1-MMP as an ∼100-kDa band (lanes 6–8), arguing the formation of covalent dimers between endogenous MT1-MMP and ΔCat/Pex. The dominant-negative effects of the ΔCat/Pex and ΔCat mutants on MT1-MMP-mediated proteolytic events by forming complexes with full-length MT1-MMP suggested that they would co-localize at the sites of potential proteolytic activity. To test this hypothesis, we carried out double immunofluorescence analysis of non-permeabilized HT-1080 cells expressing the GST fusion proteins ΔCat/Pex and ΔCat with anti-GST and anti-MT1-MMP antibodies (Fig.6 A). Endogenous MT1-MMP partially co-localized with ΔCat, whereas no significant co-localization with ΔCat/Pex was detected at the cell surface (Fig.6 A, upper panels). Treatment of cells with PMA"

Gankyrin interacts with both free and regulatory complex-associated S6 ATPase and is not stably associated with the 26 S particle. Deletional mutagenesis shows that the C-terminal 78 amino acids of the S6 ATPase are necessary and sufficient to mediate the interaction with gankyrin. Deletion of an orthologous gene in Saccharomyces cerevisiae suggests that it is dispensable for cell growth and viability. Overexpression and precipitation of tagged gankyrin from cultured cells detects a complex containing co-transfected tagged S6 ATPase (or endogenous S6) and endogenous cyclin D-dependent kinase CDK4.

The 20 S cylinder contains three chambers: two distal antechambers and a central chamber containing the catalytic threonine residues (8.Groll M. Ditzel L. Lowe J. Stock D. Bochtler M. Bartunik H.D.

Bochtler M. Bartunik H.D. Huber R. Nature. 1997; 386: 463-471Crossref PubMed Scopus (1948) Google Scholar); the ends of these antechambers need to be opened for substrate proteins to enter into the catalytic core for proteolysis. The RC can be subdivided into a “base” and a “lid” complex (10.Glickman M.H. Rubin D.M. Coux O. Wefes I. Pfeifer G. Cjeka Z. Baumeister W. Fried V.A. Finley D.

The base contains six ATPases, which belong to the AAA (ATPases associated with diverse cellularactivities) superfamily of ATPases together with the non-ATPase RPN1 and RPN2 subunits.

The ATPases of the RC may be involved in substrate unfolding for entry into the catalytic core of the 26 S proteasome.

Sobek A. Hendil K.B. Buri J. Briand Y. Schmid H.-P. Biochem. J. 1997; 326: 93-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Formally, the 26 S proteasome may have both proteolytic and nucleolytic activities and is already acknowledged as the cellular counterpart of the ribosome. In this study we have used a combination of genetic and biochemical approaches relying on protein-protein interactions to discover an ankyrin-repeat protein that specifically associates with the C terminus of the proteasomal S6 ATPase. We have previously shown that the interacting protein, called gankyrin, when overexpressed transforms NIH3T3 cells and is oncogenic in nude mice. Overexpression of gankyrin increases both the phosphorylation and degradation of the retinoblastoma protein (Rb) in vivo (27.Higashitsuji H. Itoh K. Nagao T. Dawson S. Nonoguchi K. Kido T. Mayer R.J. Arii S. Fujita J. Nature Medicine. 2000; 6: 96-99Crossref PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar). These findings have recently been extended to show the importance of gankyrin in a rodent model of hepatocarcinogenesis (28.Park T.J. Kim H.S. Byun K.H. Jang J.J. Lee Y.S. Lim I.K. Mol. Carcinog. 2001; 30: 138-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). We have presented a preliminary report on gankyrin (29.Dawson S. Hastings R. Takayanagi K. Reynolds S. Low P. Billett M. Mayer R.J. Mol. Biol. Rep. 1997; 24: 39-44Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and here we show that gankyrin specifically interacts with the S6 ATPase and is present in complexes in cells containing CDK4 and the S6 ATPase. The yeast strain HF7c (MATa, ura3–52, his3–200, lys2–801, ade2–101, trp1–901, leu2–3, 112, gal4–542, gal80–538, LYS2::GAL1-HIS3, URA3::(GAL4 17mers) 3-CYC1-lacZ(30.Feilotter H.E. Hannon G.J. Ruddell C.J. Beach D. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 1502-1503Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar)) was used for all transformations and assays involving the two-hybrid system. Strain DF5 (Mata/Matα, ura3–52/ura3–52, leu2–3, 112/leu2–3, 112, trp1-1(am) /trp1–1(am), his3Δ200/his3 200, lys2–801/lys2–801(31.Finley D. Ozkaynak E. Varshavsky A. Cell. 1987; 48: 1035-1046Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (633) Google Scholar)) was used to generate all deletion strains used in this study. Saccharomyces cerevisiae was grown in either rich (YPD), synthetic dropout (SD), or sporulation broth according to standard procedures (32.Sherman F. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 194: 3-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (2544) Google Scholar). Total yeast genomic DNA was prepared by the glass bead/phenol/chloroform extraction/ethanol precipitation procedure (33.Hoffman C.S. Winston F. Gene. 1987; 57: 267-272Crossref PubMed Scopus (2052) Google Scholar). Yeast were transformed by the lithium acetate method (34.Gietz D. Stjean A. Woods R.A. Schiestl R.H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 1425Crossref PubMed Scopus (2898) Google Scholar) and grown at 30 °C on appropriate selective media. The β-galactosidase chromogenic filter assays were performed by transferring yeast colonies onto No. 5 Whatman filter discs. Yeast cells were lysed by immersion of the filters for 10–15 s in liquid nitrogen followed by thawing at room temperature. The lysed yeast-overlaid filters were then placed onto presoaked identical filters in Petri dishes. The filters were equilibrated in Z buffer (100 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7, 10 mm KCl, 1 mm MgSO4) supplemented with 50 mm β-mercaptoethanol and 0.07 mg ml−1 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl β-d-galactoside. Filters were incubated at 30 °C for up to 6 h for color development. Human S6 ATPase cDNA was amplified from total HeLa cell RNA by reverse transcription PCR using Pfu DNA polymerase (Stratagene) and primers containing a 5′EcoRI and a 3′ SalI site. S6 cDNA was gel-purified, A-tailed by incubation for 30 min at 72 °C in 1 × Taq polymerase buffer containing 2 mm ATP and cloned into the T-tailed EcoRV site (35.Marchuk D. Drumm M. Saulino A. Collins F.S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 1154Crossref PubMed Scopus (1130) Google Scholar) of pBluescript SK− (pSK-T−) to give plasmid pHSS6. S6 cDNA was excised using EcoRI and SalI restriction endonucleases, gel-purified, and cloned into the corresponding sites of the GAL4 DNA binding domain vector, pGBT9, yielding plasmid pGBS6. S6 cDNA was sequenced to confirm PCR fidelity. An adult human MatchMaker™ brain cDNA library (CLONTECH, Palo Alto, CA) cloned into the GAL4 activating domain vector, pGAD10, was used to screen for S6-interacting proteins. Interacting plasmids were isolated by growing a His+/β-galactosidase+ colony in synthetic SD-leu medium overnight, lysing the cells with acid-washed glass beads (33.Hoffman C.S. Winston F. Gene. 1987; 57: 267-272Crossref PubMed Scopus (2052) Google Scholar), and transforming E. coli HB101 with the crude plasmid DNA isolated. S4, S7, S6′, S8 and S10b ATPase cDNAs (36.Richmond C. Gorbea C. Rechsteiner M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 13403-13411Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar) were PCR-amplified as described for S6 cDNA from total HeLa RNA using Pfu DNA polymerase and the appropriate primers. S4 cDNA was prepared carrying 5′ SmaI and 3′PstI sites, S6′ and S7 were prepared carrying 5′EcoRI and 3′ SalI sites, S8 was prepared carrying 5′ and 3′ BamHI sites, and S10b was prepared containing 5′ and 3′ EcoRI sites. PCR-amplified cDNAs were gel-purified, A-tailed, and cloned into pSK-T− yielding plasmids pHSS4, pHSS7, pHSS6′, pHSS8, and pHSS10b, respectively. All clones were DNA-sequenced to confirm identity and PCR fidelity. Individual ATPase cDNAs were excised using either EcoRI/SalI (S6′ and S7), SmaI/PstI (S4), BamHI (S8), or EcoRI (S10b), gel-purified and subcloned into the corresponding sites in the GAL4 DNA binding domain vector, pAS2-1 (CLONTECH), to give plasmids pASS4, pASS6′, pASS7, pASS8, and pASS10b. S6 deletion cDNAs were constructed by Pfu DNA polymerase-mediated PCR using pHSS6 as a template. Deletions S6Δ1, S6Δ2, S6Δ3, and S6Δ4 were constructed to produce cDNAs expressing fragments of S6 from residues 1–340, 1–280, 1–229, and 1–114, respectively. Deletions S6Δ5, S6Δ6, S6Δ7, S6Δ8, and S6Δ9 were constructed to produce cDNAs expressing S6 fragments containing residues 116–418, 340–418, 200–418, 224–418, and 275–418, respectively. Each cDNA was gel-purified, A-tailed, and cloned into pSK-T− yielding plasmids pHSS6Δ1–Δ9. cDNAs were excised using EcoRI/SalI restriction endonucleases, gel-purified, and ligated into the corresponding sites of two-hybrid vectors pGBT9 and pAS2–1 to give plasmids pGBS6Δ1-Δ4 and pASS6Δ5–Δ9, respectively. All constructs were confirmed by DNA sequencing. For analysis of gankyrin interactions with S6 deletions, ∼100 ng of each construct was co-transformed with the gankyrin-expressing GAL4-activating clone, p73Int2, into yeast strain HF7c and cultured for 3 days on selective SD medium lacking the auxotrophic amino acid markers, leucine and tryptophan. After 3 days, a single colony from each co-transformant pair was re-streaked onto SD medium lacking leucine, tryptophan, and histidine to assess for interaction between each construct and gankyrin. Plasmids containing wild-type S6 ATPase and S6 deletions Δ1–Δ9 for in vitro transcription/translation were prepared by EcoRI/SalI excision of the respective cDNA from two-hybrid plasmids pGBS6, pGBS6Δ1–Δ4, and pASS6Δ5–Δ9, gel purification and ligation, in frame, into plasmid pCITE4a (Novagen, Madison, WI) yielding plasmids pCITES6WT and pCITES6Δ1–Δ9. Plasmids pHSS4, pHSS6, or pHSS6′ were utilized for production of the S4, S6, or S6′ proteasomal ATPases, respectively. All plasmids were prepared by alkaline lysis. Transcription/translation in the presence of 35S-labeled methionine in the STP3 System (Novagen) was carried out according to the manufacturer's instructions. The35S-labeled proteins were kept at 4 °C until required. Gankyrin cDNA was excised from the plasmid p161632 with EcoRI, gel-purified, and sub-cloned in frame into the corresponding restriction site of the GST fusion vector, pGEX4T-2 (Amersham Biosciences, Inc.) to give plasmid pGXGankyrin. GST fusion constructs containing N-(GankDelN and GankDelN1) or C-terminal (GankDel56 and GankDel6) deletions have been described previously (27.Higashitsuji H. Itoh K. Nagao T. Dawson S. Nonoguchi K. Kido T. Mayer R.J. Arii S. Fujita J. Nature Medicine. 2000; 6: 96-99Crossref PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar). GST-gankyrin (or the various deletion proteins) was induced in E. coli DH5α for 3 h at 25 °C by the addition of isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside (100 μm final concentration) to a 100-ml bacterial culture (A600 ≈ 0.5). Production of the expected GST proteins was confirmed by α-GST Western blotting. After induction, bacteria were pelleted for 20 min at 3000 × g and resuspended in 20 ml of ice-cold binding buffer (10 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.5, 140 mm NaCl, 0.1% Nonidet P-40). Bacteria were lysed by freeze-thawing for 5 min in liquid nitrogen followed by thawing for 10 min at 37 °C. The lysis procedure was repeated three times. The freeze-thawed bacteria were then subjected at 4 °C to three 20 s rounds of sonication (7 μ amplitude), and the bacterial debris was pelleted by centrifugation at 15,000 ×g for 30 min at 4 °C. Supernatants were stored frozen at −20 °C in 100-μl aliquots until needed. Free GST lysates were prepared in a similar manner from E. coli DH5α transformed with a pGEX4T-2 vector that did not contain the gankyrin cDNA. Free GST and GST fusion proteins were purified on glutathione (GSH)-Sepharose 4B (Amersham Biosciences, Inc.) according to the manufacturer's recommendations and dialyzed against binding buffer. Purified proteins were quantitated by the Bradford assay (37.Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (217317) Google Scholar). For the binding analyses, 6 μg of either GST or the various GST-gankyrin constructs diluted to 1 ml with binding buffer were incubated with 50 μl bed volumes of GSH-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences, Inc.) pre-equilibrated in binding buffer for 60 min at 4 °C. GSH-Sepharose was then washed four times with 1 ml of ice-cold binding buffer at 4 °C. Reticulocyte lysates (40 μl) containing35S-labeled proteins were diluted in ice-cold binding buffer (or binding buffer containing 5 mm MgATP, 1:25), added to immobilized GST or GST-gankyrin constructs and incubated for 2 h with continuous shaking at 4 °C. After binding, each GSH-Sepharose preparation was washed four times in 1 ml of ice-cold binding buffer (or binding buffer containing 5 mm MgATP). All traces of liquid were removed from each Sepharose preparation by aspiration. Each gel sample was resuspended in 50 μl of SDS-PAGE (38.Laemmli E.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207461) Google Scholar) loading buffer and boiled for 5 min. After electrophoresis, gels were fixed in 10% acetic acid, 10% methanol and equilibrated in 1m sodium salicylate, pH 7.5, as a scintillant before drying. Dried gels were subjected to fluorography at room temperature for 24 to 48 h using Kodak BioMax MR film (Kodak). The YGR232w gene was amplified from 50 ng of total yeast DNA using oligonucleotide primers that spanned a KpnI site 818 bp upstream of the ATG codon (YGR2325) and a HindIII site 417 bp downstream of the stop codon (YGR2323) using a proof-reading thermostable polymerase as recommended by the manufacturer (Pfu Turbo, Stratagene). The 1921-bp product was digested with KpnI and HindIII and cloned into pUC18. The same product was also digested with KpnI and SphI, and the 794-bp 5′ flank of YGR232w was cloned into pUC18. To amplify the 3′ end of YGR232w, the YGR2323 primer described above was used in conjunction with another primer designed to create an XmaI site 131 bp upstream of the YGR232w stop codon (YGR232Xma). The resulting 548-bp product was digested with XmaI and HindIII and cloned into pUC18. To create the deletion allele, the URA3 gene was ligated, as a SphI-XmaI fragment, between the SphI site 24 bp upstream of the YGR232w ATG codon and the engineered XmaI site 131 bp upstream of the stop codon, thus removing 81% of the 5′ end of the open reading frame (ORF). The 3′ 131bp of the ORF was left intact so as not to disturb the adjacent convergently transcribed PHO81 gene. This plasmid was digested with KpnI and HindIII, and the linear DNA was used to transform the diploid strain DF5 to disrupt the YGR232w gene by homologous recombination (39.Rothstein R. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 194: 281-301Crossref PubMed Scopus (1105) Google Scholar). Ura+ colonies were isolated, and the correct recombination event was confirmed by Southern blot analysis on BglII-digested genomic DNA using the 794-bp KpnI-SphI 5′ flank of YGR232w as a probe. A ygr232w::URA3/ygr232w::URA3homozygous diploid strain was constructed by mating haploid ygr232w::URA3 strains of opposite mating types and selecting diploids with a micromanipulator. Gankyrin cDNA carrying 5′ and 3′ NotI sites was amplified from plasmid p161632 using Pfu polymerase. Amplified cDNA was gel-purified, A-tailed, and cloned into pSK-T− yielding plasmid pGANKN5N3. cDNA was excised using NotI restriction endonuclease, gel-purified, and ligated into the corresponding site of a modified pcDNA3.1zeo+ plasmid to give plasmid pZHFNGANK expressing His6-FLAG-gankyrin (HF-gankyrin). Plasmid pCMV5LS6, expressing N-terminally HA-tagged S6 ATPase (HA-S6), was constructed by excision of S6 cDNA from plasmid pGBS6 with restriction enzymes EcoRI and SalI, gel purification, and ligation into the vector pCMV5L. pZHFNGANK was used as a PCR template to amplify, using Pfu polymerase, gankyrin cDNA carrying 5′ EcoRI and 3′ SalI sites. The cDNA was TA-cloned as described above and ligated into EcoRI/SalI digested vector pCMV5L yielding plasmid pCMV5LGANK. Wild-type human CDK4 cDNA was PCR-amplified, using Pfupolymerase, from the plasmid template pKSCDK4 carrying both 5′ and 3′NotI sites. The cDNA was TA-cloned and ligated into the NotI-digested modified pcDNA3.1zeo+ plasmid used in the construction of pZHFNGANK yielding plasmid pZHFNCDK4. All PCR-amplified cDNAs were confirmed by DNA sequencing. Human HEK293 and U2OS cells were used for both transient and stable transfection experiments. Cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum in a humidified 5% CO2 incubator at 37 °C. Transfection reactions were carried out using calcium phosphate precipitation. Stable transfectants were selected by culturing transfected cells for 3–4 weeks in the presence of 300 μg ml−1 Zeocin. Western blot analysis indicated that the HEK293 clone 6D1 gave the highest levels of gankyrin expression, and this clone was used in all studies described here involving stable gankyrin-expressing cells. Lysate from human erythrocytes was obtained as described (40.Seeger M. Gordon C. Ferrell K. Dubiel W. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 263: 423-431Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar) except using “low detergent” lysis buffer containing 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.2), 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm NaN3, 1 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, and 10% glycerol. Separation of human erythrocyte lysate on a DEAE column, pooling of DEAE fractions containing most of the 26 S proteasome/19 S regulator, performing and calibrating 10–40% glycerol gradients with antibodies against 26 S proteasome/19 S regulator antibodies have been outlined previously (40.Seeger M. Gordon C. Ferrell K. Dubiel W. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 263: 423-431Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). After glycerol gradient fractionation, shown in Fig. 3A, fractions 5–9 were pooled and loaded on an FPLC ResourceQ column. After extensive washing the remaining proteins were eluted with a linear gradient from 50 mm to 1 m KCl. Fractions 1–60 were collected and checked for 26 S proteasome/19 S regulator by immunoblotting. Fractions 27–44 containing most of the 26 S proteasome/19 S regulator were pooled and loaded on an FPLC MonoQ. Proteins were eluted with a linear gradient from 50 mm to 1m of KCl. At about 300 mm KCl, a single peak elutes (fractions 17, 18, and 19), which was analyzed (see Fig. 3, B and C). Western blot analysis and nondenaturing electrophoresis were performed as described (41.Henke W. Ferrell K. Bech-Otschir D. Seeger M. Schade R. Jungblut P. Naumann M. Dubiel W. Mol. Biol. Rep. 1999; 26: 29-34Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Affinity-purified α-gankyrin antibody was used at a dilution of 1:100. The anti-CSN3, anti-CSN5, anti-S4, and anti-S10a antibodies have been described previously (41.Henke W. Ferrell K. Bech-Otschir D. Seeger M. Schade R. Jungblut P. Naumann M. Dubiel W. Mol. Biol. Rep. 1999; 26: 29-34Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Nondenaturing electrophoresis was performed with 5 μl of fraction 19 (Fig. 3C) on 4–15% gradient gels using the Phast-Gel system (Amersham Biosciences, Inc.). After electrophoresis, gels were analyzed by immunoblotting. Cells (∼ 2 × 105) were lysed in 0.5 ml of “standard” lysis buffer (1% Nonidet P-40, 1% sodium deoxycholate, 150 mm NaCl, 10 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.2) by freeze-thawing (4 times) and debris removed by centrifugation. Lysates were incubated together with the recommended quantity of antibody for 2 h with agitation at 4 °C. Immune complexes were precipitated by the addition of 20 μl of protein A/G-agarose beads (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), incubation for 1 h with agitation at 4 °C followed by centrifugation. Precipitated immune complexes were washed three times with 1 ml of lysis buffer, excess buffer was removed by aspiration, and the immune complexes were eluted by the addition of 50 μl of Laemmli loading buffer. Nickel chelate precipitation via a poly-His tag was performed using the HisTagCatcher Kit (CytoSignal Research Products) according to the manufacturer's recommendations. Affinity-purified complexes were analyzed by electrophoresis on polyacrylamide gels followed by blotting onto nitrocellulose membrane and detection with specific antisera and enhanced chemiluminesence. Anti-CDK4 antibody was obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA). Rat monoclonal anti-HA antibody was obtained from Roche Molecular Biochemicals. Mouse monoclonal anti-FLAG (M2) antibody was obtained from Sigma-Aldrich. The gankyrin cDNA was isolated in a yeast two-hybrid screen against an adult human brain cDNA library using the human S6 ATPase as bait. The cDNA sequence is identical to a recently described cDNA encoding a protein called gankyrin (27.Higashitsuji H. Itoh K. Nagao T. Dawson S. Nonoguchi K. Kido T. Mayer R.J. Arii S. Fujita J. Nature Medicine. 2000; 6: 96-99Crossref PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar), found in complexes with the retinoblastoma protein, and will hereafter be referred to by that name. Analysis of the primary amino acid sequence reveals that the protein is composed of tandem elements of the so-called “ankyrin repeat,” a 32-amino acid unit first observed in the cytoskeletal protein, ankyrin (42.Hall T.G. Bennett V. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 10537-10545Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To assess the interaction between gankyrin and the S6 ATPase, in vitro binding assays were performed using a GST fusion of gankyrin and in vitro translated35S-labeled proteasomal ATPases in the presence and absence of ATP. Radiolabeled ATPases were incubated with GST-gankyrin protein-linked glutathione-Sepharose beads. The radiolabeled S6 ATPase was selectively retained by gankyrin with no interaction observed between S6 and GST alone (Fig. 1). The interaction exhibited specificity toward the S6 ATPase; no binding was detected with the two other ATPases used in the assay (S4 and S6′; Fig. 1). No influence of ATP was observed on the binding of S6 ATPase to gankyrin (data not shown). To assess the interaction in a mammalian cell culture system, transient co-transfection and nickel chelate pull-down analyses of gankyrin-containing complexes was performed. HEK293 cells stably expressing HF-gankyrin were transiently transfected with plasmid pCMV5LS6 expressing HA-tagged S6 (HA-S6) and cells harvested 48 h post-transfection. HF-gankyrin-containing complexes were isolated using a nickel chelate pull-down and analyzed by Western blotting using an α-HA monoclonal antibody to detect HA-S6. Fig. 2A shows that HA-S6 ATPase is precipitated exclusively in cells that also express HF-gankyrin (lane 4). S6 ATPase transfected into HEK293 cells stably expressing the poly-His-FLAG tag alone or the parent cell line was not detectable in the absence of HF-gankyrin (Fig. 2A, lanes 2 and 6, respectively). Transfected HF-gankyrin was also able to interact with endogenous S6 ATPase. HEK293 cells stably expressing HF-gankyrin were lysed as described previously and analyzed by nickel affinity pull-down followed by Western blotting using a mouse monoclonal antibody raised against human S6 ATPase. Fig. 2B clearly shows that endogenous S6 ATPase can be co-purified with HF-gankyrin under the conditions used. We followed the fate of gankyrin during the preparation of various protein complexes from human erythrocytes (26 S proteasome, 19 S regulator, 26 S proteasome lid) by Western blotting using an affinity-purified anti-gankyrin antibody.

https://openalex.org/W2163104842,"BCR/ABL tyrosine kinase generated from the chromosomal translocation t(9;22) causes chronic myelogenous leukemia and acute lymphoblastic leukemia. To examine the roles of BCR/ABL-activated individual signaling molecules and their cooperation in leukemogenesis, we inducibly expressed a dominant negative (DN) form of Ras, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, and STAT5 alone or in combination in p210 BCR/ABL-positive K562 cells. The inducibly expressed DN Ras (N17), STAT5 (694F), and DN phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (Δp85) inhibited the growth by 90, 55, and 40%, respectively. During the growth inhibition, the expression of cyclin D2 and cyclin D3 was suppressed by N17, 694F, or Δp85; that of cyclin E by N17; and that of cyclin A by Δp85. In addition, N17 induced apoptosis in a small proportion of K562, whereas 694F and Δp85 were hardly effective. In contrast, coexpression of two DN mutants in any combinations induced severe apoptosis. During these cultures, the expression of Bcl-2 was suppressed by N17, 694F, or Δp85, and that of Bcl-XL by N17. Furthermore, although K562 was resistant to interferon-α- and dexamethasone-induced apoptosis, disruption of one pathway by N17, 694F, or Δp85 sensitized K562 to these reagents. These results suggested that cooperation among these molecules is required for full leukemogenic activities of BCR/ABL."
https://openalex.org/W1996401524,"Activation of insulin-like growth factor I receptor (IGF-IR) kinase is an important site of control of IGF-I-linked intracellular signaling pathways. One potentially important regulatory variable is IGF-IR dephosphorylation. It has been shown that SHP-2, a tyrosine phosphatase, can bind to the activated IGF-IR in vitro; however, its role in IGF-IR dephosphorylation in whole cells is unknown. These studies were undertaken to determine whether SHP-2 was a candidate for mediating IGF-IR dephosphorylation. The IGF-IR in smooth muscle cells was dephosphorylated rapidly beginning 10 min after ligand addition, and this was temporally associated with SHP-2 binding to the receptor. IGF-I stimulated SHPS-1 phosphorylation and the subsequent recruitment of SHP-2. In cells expressing a SHPS-1 mutant that did not bind SHP-2 there was no recruitment of SHP-2 to the IGF-IR. Cells expressing a catalytically inactive form of SHP-2 showed SHP-2 recruitment to SHPS-1, but this did not result in SHPS-1 dephosphorylation, and there was a prolonged IGF-IR phosphorylation response after IGF-I stimulation. These studies indicate that IGF-IR stimulates phosphorylation of SHPS-1 which is critical for SHP-2 recruitment to the plasma membrane and for its recruitment to the IGF-IR. Recruitment of SHP-2 to the receptor then results in receptor dephosphorylation. The regulation of this process may be an important determinant of IGF-IR-mediated signaling.

Mol. Endocrinol. 1996; 10: 631-641Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar), and the activated IGF-IR transmits downstream signals via tyrosine phosphorylation of these molecules. Activation of these tyrosines is not only critical for the downstream signaling, but also for sustained stimulation of IGF-I-stimulated biologic responses. Mutation of specific tyrosines in the receptor has been shown to result in attenuation of the ability of IGF-I to stimulate DNA synthesis, cell migration, and inhibition of apoptosis (6Baserga R. Cancer Res. 1995; 55: 249-252PubMed Google Scholar). Most important is the triple tyrosine motif that is phosphorylated rapidly in response to catalytic activation of the receptor, and mutation of any of these residues results in loss of signaling and IGF-I responsiveness (7Blakesley V.A. Scrimgeour A. Esposito D. LeRoith D. Cytokine Growth Factor Rev. 1996; 7: 153-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). The tyrosine phosphorylation status of proteins in growth factor signaling pathways is maintained by a balance between the activity of tyrosine kinases and tyrosine phosphatases. Because phosphorylation of these tyrosines in the receptor β subunit is so important for IGF-I signaling it has been assumed that dephosphorylation of the receptor would result in appropriate regulatory control of this signaling stimulus. The time course of phosphorylation of tyrosine kinase-containing growth factor receptors has been shown to be biphasic with an early peak resulting in activation of the signaling intermediates within 0–10 min of ligand occupancy of the receptor followed by a slower phase of receptor dephosphorylation usually proceeding over the next 10–30 min. One candidate phosphatase for dephosphorylation of the IGF-IR is the tyrosine phosphatase SHP-2 (Syp, PTP-1D, SHPTP2). SHP-2 is a nontransmembrane phosphotyrosine phosphatase that contains two SH-2 domains (8Freeman Jr., R.M. Pltuzky J. Neel B.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Growth hormone (GH) activation of GH receptor has been shown to result in binding of SHP-2 to the GH receptor and tyrosine phosphorylation of SHP-2 (14Stofega M.R. Wang H. Ullrich A. Carter-Su C. J.

In addition to binding and interacting with SHP-2, activated GH, insulin, and growth factor receptors have also been shown to stimulate the phosphorylation of a transmembrane protein termed SHPS-1 (Sirp α, Bit) (14Stofega M.R.

After phosphorylation of two tyrosines that are contained in the intracellular domain of SHPS-1, SHP-2 is recruited from the cytoplasm to the plasma membrane, and its binding to SHPS-1 activates its phosphatase activity (18Fujioka Y.

Mutation of these tyrosines in SHPS-1 results in the failure of SHP-2 to be recruited to the membrane (21Takada T. Matozaki T. Takeda H. Fukanaga K. Noguchi T. Fujioka Y. Okazaki I. Tsuda M. Yamao T.

The recruitment of SHP-2 to SHPS-1 has been shown to correlate with the negative effect of SHPS-1 on insulin signaling (19Kharitonenkov A. Chen Z. Sures I. Wang H. Schilling J. Ullrich A. Nature. 1997; 386: 181-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (540) Google Scholar), and in the case of the GH receptor, loss of SHP-2 recruitment to SHPS-1 has been shown to result in prolonged GH receptor phosphorylation (22Stofega M.R. Argetsinger L.S. Wang H. Ullrich A. Carter-Su C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 28222-28229Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Based on these prior observations, we attempted to determine whether SHP-2 dephosphorylates the IGF-IR after IGF-I-induced receptor activation, to identify the role of SHPS-1 in recruitment of SHP-2 to the activated receptor, and to determine the consequences of blocking this recruitment using mutagenesis. Human IGF-I was a gift from Genentech (South San Francisco, CA). Polyvinylidene difluoride filters were purchased from Millipore Corporation (Bedford, MA). Autoradiographic film was obtained from Eastman Kodak. Fetal bovine serum, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, penicillin. and streptomycin were purchased from Invitrogen. The IGF-IR β chain antibody was purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). The polyclonal SHP-2 antibody and the monoclonal, horseradish peroxidase-linked, phosphotyrosine antibody (RC20) were purchased from Transduction Laboratories (Lexington, KY). Two SHPS-1 polyclonal antibodies were used. The first was obtained from Transduction Laboratories and was raised to the entire cytoplasmic domain of SHPS-1 (SHPS-1fl) the second was raised our laboratory in rabbits using a synthetic peptide containing the C-terminal 20 amino acids of the SHPS-1 cytoplasmic tail as an immunogen (SHPS-1tr). All other reagents were purchased from Sigma unless otherwise stated. Porcine aortic SMCs (pSMCs) were isolated as described previously (23Gockerman A. Jones J.I. Prevette T. Clemmons D.R. Endocrinology. 1995; 136: 4168-4173Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 4.5 g/liter glucose, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 10% fetal bovine serum in 10-cm tissue culture plates. The cells were used between passage 5 and 16. Full-length human SHP-2 and SHPS-1 were cloned by reverse transcription-PCR from a cDNA library that had been derived from human fibroblast mRNA (GM10, Human Genetic Cell Repository, Camden, NJ). For SHP-2 the 5′-primer sequence used corresponded to nucleotides 133–158 of the human SHP-2 sequence but with the addition, at the 5′-end, of nucleotides encoding the FLAG peptide. The 5′-primer sequence was 5′-ATG GAC TAC AAA GAC GAC GAC GAC AAA ACA TCG CGG AGA TGG TTT CAC CCA AA-3′. The bases encoding the FLAG peptide are underlined. The 3′-primer sequence used was complementary to nucleotides 1882–1911 and was 5′-TCA TCT GAA ACT TTT CTG TTG CAT-3′. After DNA sequencing to confirm that the correct sequence had been amplified the PCR product was subcloned into pMEP4 expression vector (Invitrogen). To clone SHPS-1 the 5′-primer sequence used corresponded to nucleotides 17–35 of human SHPS-1 (5′-CAG CCG CGG CCC ATG GAG CC-3′), and the 3′-primer sequence was complementary to nucleotides 1502–1524 (5′-CAA ACC ACG GTC CCA TTC TGA-3′). After DNA sequencing to confirm that the correct sequence had been amplified the PCR product was subcloned into the pMEP4 expression vector. PCR was used to incorporate a replacement of Cys459 by Ser in the catalytic site of SHP-2 (SHP-2 C-S). This mutation was shown previously to result in a dominant negative catalytically inactive form of SHP-2 (23Gockerman A. Jones J.I. Prevette T. Clemmons D.R. Endocrinology. 1995; 136: 4168-4173Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 24Imai Y. Busby W.H. Clarke J.B. Horwitz G. Rees C. Clemmons D.R. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 100: 2596-2605Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Two cDNA fragments encoding the SHP-2 DNA were generated. The first fragment was made using the same 5′-primer as that used to clone full-length SHP-2; the 3′-primer was complementary to nucleotides 1474–1497, but it also contained 3 additional bases at the 3′-end of the DNA sequence which introduced an HpaI cleavage site. The primer sequence was 5′-GTT * AAC GAC CGG CCC TGC ATC CAT GAT-3′. The additional 3 bases are underlined, and the site of the HpaI cleavage is marked *. The fragment was generated using a 5′-primer sequence corresponding to nucleotides 1498–1525, but it also contained a 3-base extension at the 5′-end to generate an SnaB1 cleavage site, and it included 2-base substitutions (TGC-TCA) to encode the Cys459 → Ser mutation. The sequence was 5′-TAC * GTA CAC TC#A# AGT GCT GGA ATT GGCCGG A-3′. The additional 3 bases are underlined, and the point ofSnaB1 cleavage is marked with *. The base changes encoding the Cys → Ser substitution are indicated with #. The 3′-primer was the same as that used to clone the full-length SHP-2. The two PCR products were then cloned into the pcDNA 3.1 V5 His vector (Invitrogen). After amplification the two fragments were digested and separated from the vector. The first fragment was digested at BamHI in the polylinker of the vector, 5′ to the introduced DNA sequence and at the introduced HpaI site. The second fragment was digested at the Xho site in the vector polylinker sequence 3′ to the introduced DNA sequence and at the introduced SnaB1 site. The DNA fragments were then ligated at the compatible blunt ends generated by theHpaI and SnaB1 digestions, and the DNA sequence encoding the full-length SHP-2 incorporating the Cys → Ser substitution was cloned into the pcDNA 3.1 V5 His vector. After amplification and sequencing the modified sequence was subcloned into the pMEP4 expression vector. PCR was used to generate a truncated form of SHPS-1 (SHPS-1tr) that terminated at amino acid 463 resulting in the loss of the two C-terminal tyrosine residues (Tyr 449/Tyr475) that had been shown to be required for SHP-2 binding (23Gockerman A. Jones J.I. Prevette T. Clemmons D.R. Endocrinology. 1995; 136: 4168-4173Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The 5′-primer used was the same as that used to clone the full-length SHPS-1, and the 3′-primer that was used was complementary to nucleotides 1390–1416 except that it contained base substitutions to incorporate a stop codon at the end of the sequence (at position 1414–1416). The sequence was 5′-CTA GGG CTG CGG GCT GGT CTG AAT GCT-3′. The introduced stop site is underlined. The modified DNA sequence was cloned into the pcDNA 3.1 V5 His vector. After sequencing and amplification it was subcloned into the pMEP4 expression vector. The pSMCs (passages 4 and 5) were transfected with the various pMEP4 expression vectors. In all cases transfections were performed using the poly-l-ornithine method as described previously (24Imai Y. Busby W.H. Clarke J.B. Horwitz G. Rees C. Clemmons D.R. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 100: 2596-2605Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Hygromycin-resistant pSMCs were selected and maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium-H containing 15% fetal bovine serum and 100 μg/ml hygromycin. Transfected pSMCs were used in subsequent experiments between passages 6 and 20. Cells were incubated overnight in SFM and then exposed to 100 ng/ml IGF-I for the appropriate length of time before lysis in ice-cold lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.25% sodium deoxycholate, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 1 mm sodium fluoride, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μg/ml pepstatin A, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, and 1 μg/ml aprotinin). The lysates were clarified by centrifugation at 14,000 × g for 10 min. Immunoprecipitation was then carried out as described below. The supernatants were incubated overnight at 4 °C with the appropriate antibody (IGF-IR, SHP-2, or SHPS-1 using a 1:500 dilution). Immune complexes were then precipitated by adding protein A-Sepharose and incubating for a further 2 h at 4 °C. The samples were then centrifuged at 14,000 ×g for 10 min and the pellets washed four times with lysis buffer. The pellet was resuspended in 45 μl of reducing Laemmeli buffer, boiled for 5 min, and the proteins separated by SDS-PAGE, 8% gel. After SDS-PAGE the proteins were transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane. The membranes were blocked in 1% bovine serum albumin in Tris-buffered saline with 0.1% Tween (TBST) for 2 h at room temperature. The membranes were incubated with one of four primary antibodies (IGF-IR, SHP-2, SHPS-1, or RC20 all at a dilution of 1:500) overnight at 4 °C and then washed three times in TBST. Binding of the peroxidase-labeled antibody was visualized using enhanced chemiluminescence following the manufacturer's instructions (Pierce) and either exposure to autoradiographic film or detection using the GeneGnome CCD imaging system (Syngene U. K. Ltd.). Band intensities were measured by scanning densitometry and analyzed using NIH Image, version 1.61. Student's t test was used to compare differences between treatments. The results that are shown are representative of at least three separate experiments. After a 5-min stimulation of quiescent pSMCs with IGF-I there was a 13 ± 1-fold (mean ± S.E., n = 3) increase in IGF-IR phosphorylation. After a 10-min treatment with IGF-I there was a further 1.3 ± 0.12-fold (n = 3) increase in IGF-IR phosphorylation. By 20 min there was a 2.1 ± 0.25-fold (n = 3) decrease in receptor phosphorylation compared with the level of phosphorylation which is detectable at 10 min. A representative experiment in shown in Fig.1. In Fig. 2 it can be seen that there was little SHP-2 associated with the IGF-IR in the basal state and after 5 min of IGF-I stimulation. However, after a 10-min stimulation there was detectable SHP-2 association, and at 20 min there was a marked 16 ± 4.5-fold increase (n= 3) in SHP-2 association with the IGF-IR. These results suggest that there is a correlation between the time at which the phosphorylation state of the IGF-IR is decreasing and the time at which the SHP-2 tyrosine phosphatase association increases. Because SHP-2 is predominantly a cytosolic protein, it must be recruited to the plasma membrane before it can bind to the IGF-IR. The phosphorylation of SHPS-1 and its subsequent recruitment of SHP-2 from the cytosol have been shown to be stimulated by various growth factors. Fig.3 shows that as with other growth factors IGF-I stimulated a rapid increase in SHPS-1 phosphorylation. Maximum IGF-I stimulated phosphorylation of SHPS-1 occurred after a 5-min incubation (6.6 ± 0.7-fold; n = 3), and this was followed by a 2.6 ± 1.1-fold (n = 3) decrease in SHPS-1 phosphorylation by 10 min. We next examined whether SHP-2 was recruited to SHPS-1 after IGF-I-stimulated SHPS-1 phosphorylation. Fig.4 shows that there was no detectable SHP-2 association with SHPS-1 in the basal state, but SHP-2 was recruited to SHPS-1 after a 5-min exposure to IGF-I. The association of SHP-2 with SHPS-1 decreases rapidly, and association is barely detectable at 10 min. The recruitment of SHP-2 to SHPS-1 and then its subsequent rapid disassociation suggested that this was a potential mechanism by which SHP-2 could be recruited to the plasma membrane and then become available to bind to the IGF-IR. The SHP-2 binding site on SHPS-1 has been identified as the two C-terminal tyrosine residues (23Gockerman A. Jones J.I. Prevette T. Clemmons D.R. Endocrinology. 1995; 136: 4168-4173Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To examine whether SHP-2 recruitment to IGF-IR required that SHP-2 first be recruited from the cytosol to SHPS-1 we expressed a truncated form of SHPS-1 which lacked the two C-terminal tyrosine residues (SHPS-1tr) and examined SHP-2 recruitment to both SHPS-1 and the IGF-IR after IGF-I stimulation. Fig.5 A shows that after immunoprecipitation and immunoblotting with the SHPS-1 antibody raised to the entire cytoplasmic tail, comparable levels of SHPS-1 protein were detected in SHPS-1tr cells and in cells transfected with the empty vector alone. However, Fig. 5 B shows that no SHPS-1 protein can be detected in cells expressing SHPS-1tr when the antibody raised to the C-terminal region of SHPS-1 was used to immunoblot, whereas abundant SHPS-1 protein can be detected in cells transfected with the empty vector alone. This suggests that the truncated form of SHPS-1 is acting in a dominant negative manner. In Fig. 5 C it can be seen that despite levels of SHPS-1 protein in the cells expressing SHPS-1tr comparable to levels in cells expressing the empty vector, there was no recruitment of SHP-2 to SHPS-1 in cells expressing the truncated form of the protein, whereas cells transfected with the empty vector showed abundant SHP-2 bound to SHPS-1 after 5 min of IGF-I stimulation. This blot was exposed to film for 24 h to show that there was no SHP-2 association in the cells expressing truncated SHPS-1. To confirm that loss of SHPS-1 recruitment of SHP-2 would alter SHP-2 association with IGF-IR we utilized the cells expressing the truncated form of SHPS-1. In Fig.6 it can be seen that after IGF-I stimulation there was no recruitment of SHP-2 to the IGF-IR in cells expressing the truncated form of SHPS-1. This blot was exposed to film for 24 h to confirm that there was no SHP-2 association. Recruitment of SHP-2 to the IGF-IR in cells expressing the empty vector alone is also shown. The rapid decrease in SHPS-1 phosphorylation and loss of SHP-2 association with SHPS-1 are consistent with phosphorylated SHPS-1 being a substrate for SHP-2 phosphatase (18Fujioka Y. Matozaki T. Noguchi T. Iwamatsu A. Yamao T. Nobuaki T. Tsuda M. Takada T. Kasuga M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 6887-6899Crossref PubMed Scopus (382) Google Scholar, 20Noguchi T. Matozaki T. Fujioka Y. Yamao T. Tsuda M. Takada T. Kasuga M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 27652-27658Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). To prove that the recruitment of SHP-2 to SHPS-1 and its subsequent release were required for SHP-2 association with and dephosphorylation of the IGF-IR we expressed a catalytically inactive form of SHP-2 (SHP-2 C-S), which cannot dephosphorylate SHPS-1. We then examined the time course of IGF-IR dephosphorylation in these cells. Fig. 7 A shows that the transfected cells express FLAG-tagged SHP-2 C-S and that the cells transfected with the empty vector alone do not. In Fig. 7 B,top panel, it can be seen that in cells expressing the catalytically inactive form of SHP-2, SHPS-1 was phosphorylated after 5 min of stimulation with IGF-I; however, unlike cells that contain wild type SHP-2, cells expressing the SHP-2 C-S mutant showed no decrease in SHPS-1 phosphorylation at 10 min. Fig. 7 B, middle panel, demonstrates that in contrast to the cells transfected with the empty vector alone, the cells expressing SHP-2 C-S showed no dissociation of SHP-2 from SHPS-1 over the time course that was examined. This was confirmed further by showing that when IGF-I-R was immunoprecipitated followed by immunoblotting for SHP-2, no SHP-2 could be detected (data not shown). This shows that retention of SHP-2 binding to SHPS-1 was associated with a loss of binding to the IGF-IR. Fig. 7 C shows that after a 5-min exposure to IGF-I, cells expressing the C-S mutant or cells transfected with an empty vector showed a marked increase in IGF-IR phosphorylation. After 10 min there is a significant reduction in IGF-IR phosphorylation in the empty vector cells but no change in cells expressing the C-S mutant, and these cells show a further increase in receptor phosphorylation at the 20-min time point. These data suggest that in the absence of SHP-2 release from SHPS-1 there is no recruitment of SHP-2 to the IGF-IR and no receptor dephosphorylation. The increase in IGF-IR phosphorylation which occurs after ligand binding is transient and is followed by a rapid decline in the level of IGF-IR phosphorylation. Because there are no significant changes in IGF-IR protein levels over this time this suggests that there are activation and recruitment of a tyrosine phosphatase to the receptor.In vitro studies have shown that a catalytically inactive form of SHP-2 can bind directly to tyrosine-phosphorylated forms of both the insulin and IGF-IR (10Rocchi S. Tartare-Deckert S. Sawka-Verhelte D. Gamha A. Van Obberghen E. Endocrinology. 1996; 137: 4944-4952Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar). Those studies suggested indirectly that SHP-2 could dephosphorylate both receptors after it bound because only a phosphatase-inactive form of SHP-2 formed a stable complex and did not dephosphorylate either receptor (10Rocchi S. Tartare-Deckert S. Sawka-Verhelte D. Gamha A. Van Obberghen E. Endocrinology. 1996; 137: 4944-4952Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar). From the studies presented here we propose that the recruitment of SHP-2 to the IGF-IR via SHPS-1 is responsible for the decrease in IGF-IR phosphorylation after IGF-I-induced receptor activation and is therefore an important regulator of IGF-I signaling. This was first suggested by our data demonstrating an association between the time at which the IGF-IR phosphorylation was decreasing and the time at which the SHP-2 phosphatase associated with the receptor. This conclusion is supported further by our data demonstrating that in cells expressing a truncated form of SHPS-1, SHP-2 is not recruited to the IGF-IR and by the detection of sustained IGF-IR phosphorylation in cells expressing the catalytically inactive form of SHP-2 which is not released from SHPS-1. SHPS-1 has recently been identified as a transmembrane glycoprotein with three immunoglobulin-like domains, four potential tyrosine phosphorylation sites, and SH-2 binding motifs in its cytoplasmic domain (17Tsuda M.

Binding of the two SH-2 domains within SHP-2 to these high affinity binding sites on SHPS-1 increases SHP-2 association and activates the phosphatase by releasing the N-terminal SH-2 domain from constraining the phosphatase active site (25Pluskey S.

SHPS-1 phosphorylation not only provides a binding site for SHP-2, but it is also a substrate for the phosphatase, resulting in dephosphorylation of SHPS-1 and therefore loss of the SHP-2 binding sites (18Fujioka Y.

It has been proposed that once SHP-2 has been recruited to SHPS-1, after its activation and the subsequent dephosphorylation of SHPS-1, it is available to associate with other plasma membrane-associated proteins (21Takada T. Matozaki T. Takeda H. Fukanaga K. Noguchi T. Fujioka Y. Okazaki I. Tsuda M. Yamao T. Ochi F. Kasuga M. J. Biol.

Chem. 2000; 275: 28222-28229Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). As has been shown for the insulin, platelet-derived growth factor, and the epidermal growth factor receptors (16Stofega M.R. Herrington J. Billestrup N. Carter-Su C. Mol. Endocrinol. 2000; 14: 1338-1350Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), we show here that IGF-I can stimulate an increase in SHPS-1 phosphorylation, and this results in an increase in the association of SHP-2. The time course of maximal SHPS-1 phosphorylation and SHP-2 recruitment after IGF-I stimulation precedes maximal IGF-IR phosphorylation and SHP-2 recruitment by the receptor. This further supports the conclusion that recruitment of SHP-2 to the IGF-IR via SHPS-1 is the mechanism by which SHP-2 is recruited to the receptor. This conclusion is strongly supported by our data showing that in cells expressing a truncated form of SHPS-1, in which the two tyrosines (Tyr449 and Tyr475) that are known to be the binding site for SHP-2 have been deleted (21Takada T. Matozaki T. Takeda H. Fukanaga K. Noguchi T. Fujioka Y. Okazaki I. Tsuda M. Yamao T. Ochi F. Kasuga M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 9234-9242Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar), SHP-2 is not recruited to either SHPS-1 or to the IGF-IR. The importance of the release of SHP-2 from SHPS-1 is substantiated further by the data demonstrating a lack of SHP-2 recruitment to the IGF-IR in cells expressing the catalytically inactive form of SHP-2. In these cells SHPS-1 is not dephosphorylated, SHP-2 is not released, and IGF-IR phosphorylation is prolonged. Thus stimulation of SHPS-1 phosphorylation after ligand occupancy of IGF-IR and the subsequent dephosphorylation of SHPS-1 by SHP-2 are critical steps that are required for the IGF-IR dephosphorylation response to be initiated. SHP-2 has been shown to bind various signaling molecules and depending upon the molecule and the experimental approach taken, it has been shown to have both positive and negative effects on signaling by intracellular mediators that have been activated by tyrosine kinase receptors. Expression of a mutated form of IRS-1 which does not bind SHP-2 results in enhanced insulin-stimulated tyrosine phosphorylation of IRS-1, which in turn increased the association of PI-3 kinase with IRS-1 and enhanced insulin-stimulated protein synthesis (28Myers Jr., M.G. Mendez R. Shi P. Pierce J.H. Rhoads R. White M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 26908-26914Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). Similarly, mutation of the SHP-2 binding site in the GH receptor prolongs GH-stimulated tyrosine phosphorylation of the GH receptor and the signaling proteins JAK2 and STAT 5B (29Milarski K.L. Saltiel A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 21239-21243Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Overexpression of SHPS-1 has been shown to result in a decrease in insulin-stimulated DNA synthesis, and this result was attributed to its phosphorylation and recruitment of SHP-2 (19Kharitonenkov A. Chen Z. Sures I. Wang H. Schilling J. Ullrich A. Nature. 1997; 386: 181-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (540) Google Scholar). However, other studies using dominant negative mutants and anti-SHP-2 antibodies have suggested that SHP-2 may play an important positive role in IGF-I and other growth factor-stimulated cell proliferation through activation of mitogen-activated protein kinase, although the signaling components that are dephosphorylated by SHP-2 which mediate these effects have not been identified (20Noguchi T.

This appears to occur upstream of RAS activation and at least for some growth factors involves SHP-2 recruitment to GAB-1-like tyrosine-phosphorylated docking proteins (24Imai Y. Busby W.H.

It would seem therefore that SHP-2 can play a dual role in growth factor signaling, and its activity would appear to be dependent upon its subcellular localization and binding partners. However, as demonstrated in our studies the IGF-IR and a previously published study for the GH receptor (22Stofega M.R. Argetsinger L.S. Wang H. Ullrich A. Carter-Su C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 28222-28229Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar), SHP-2 recruitment to SHPS-1 clearly contributes to the ability of SHP-2 to effect receptor dephosphorylation. Because it has been shown previously that integrin ligand occupancy can regulate SHP-2 localization and activation (17Tsuda M. Matozaki T. Fukanaga K. Fujioka Y. Imamoto A. Noguchi T. Takada T.

The regulation of SHP-2 association with the IGF-IR and hence IGF-IR phosphorylation levels by αVβ3 ligand occupancy is an attractive hypothesis to explain our observation that blocking αVβ3 ligand occupancy reduces IGF-IR phosphorylation (39Zheng B. Clemmons D.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 11217-11222Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). Identification of factors other than SHPS-1 which regulate SHP-2 subcellular localization and therefore its binding partners and activation action will be important for understanding the role of other variables such as αVβ3integrin ligand occupancy in regulating IGF-I signaling.

We previously showed that in vitro cyst development ofEntamoeba invadens requires the addition of defined amounts of multivalent galactose-terminated molecules, such as mucin, to the cultures. The amoeba surface lectin that binds mucin is presumed to convey transmembrane signals when clustered by the ligand, but the signaling molecules that function downstream of the lectin are not known. We report here that Entamoebaencystation was induced in the absence of galactose ligand when catecholamines were added to the encystation medium. Micromolar amounts of both epinephrine and norepinephrine induced encystation. Of a variety of synthetic catecholamine agonists tested, only β1-adrenergic receptor agonists supported encystation, whereas α- and β2-adrenergic receptor agonists did not. Only β1-adrenergic receptor antagonists inhibited encystation, and did so even when exogenous catecholamines were not added, indicating that catecholamine binding is required for encystation and suggesting an endogenous source of the ligand. High performance liquid chromatography analysis of Entamoebaextracts showed that the amoebae themselves contain catecholamines and at least one of these is released when the cells are stimulated to encyst with galactose-terminated ligands. The presence of catecholamine binding sites on the surface of amoeba trophozoites was confirmed using radiolabeled catecholamine antagonist. Amoeba encystment was inhibited by addition of β1-adrenergic receptor antagonist to cells that were stimulated to differentiate with either galactose ligand or catecholamines, but not with dibutyryl cAMP. This suggests that the amoeba catecholamine receptor functions downstream of the galactose lectin and upstream of adenylyl cyclase. This enteric protozoan parasite, therefore, contains the components of an autocrine catecholamine ligand-receptor system that may act in conjunction with a galactose lectin to regulate differentiation into the infectious cyst stage.

Morphological and biochemical changes associated with differentiation of the trophozoite into the cyst (encystation) have been described (1McConnachie E.W. Parasitology. 1955; 45: 452-481Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 2McConnachie E.W. Parasitology. 1969; 59: 41-53Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 3Eichinger D. BioEssays. 1997; 19: 633-639Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar), but little is known about the stimuli that trigger this differentiation process. No axenic in vitro system currently exists for studying encystation of the human-infecting parasite Entamoeba histolytica; however, such a system exists forEntamoeba invadens, a parasite of reptiles. These two organisms have the same two-stage life cycle and pathogenic potential toward their vertebrate hosts (4Meerovitch E. J. Parasitol. 1961; 47: 791-794Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar), and form quadrinucleated, chitinaceous cysts with osmotically resistant cyst walls (1McConnachie E.W. Parasitology. 1955; 45: 452-481Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). E. invadens will readily encyst in vitro in response to carbon source deprivation (5Vazquezdelara-Cisneros L.G. Arroyo-Begovich A. J. Parasitol. 1984; 70: 629-633Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar), hypoosmotic shock (6Avron B. Stolarsky T. Chayen A. Mirelman D. J. Protozool. 1986; 33: 522-525Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar), or a combination of the two stimuli (7Sanchez L. Enea V. Eichinger D. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1994; 67: 125-135Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). One requirement for maximal encystation to occur in vitro is the presence of 5% adult bovine serum (ABS)1 in the encystation medium (8Rengpien S. Bailey G.B. J. Parasitol. 1975; 61: 24-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar); dialyzed serum will also suffice, suggesting a role for a large molecular weight molecule (8Rengpien S. Bailey G.B. J. Parasitol. 1975; 61: 24-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). We have shown that specific concentrations of galactose-terminated glycoproteins, such as asialofetuin (ASF), or mucin, the major glycoprotein comprising the mucus layer of the colon, can substitute for the 5% serum and trigger the differentiation of the trophozoite to the cyst form (9Coppi A. Eichinger D. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1999; 102: 67-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Mucin binds to Entamoeba trophozoites (10Chadee K. Petri W.A.J. Innes D.J. Ravdin J.I. J. Clin.

Petri W.A.J. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1998; 9: 2069-2079Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar), but the downstream signaling systems that interact with the lectin are not defined. During in vitro encystation, the motile E. invadens trophozoites form large multicellular aggregates within the first 2 h after they are transferred into encystation induction medium (5Vazquezdelara-Cisneros L.G. Arroyo-Begovich A. J. Parasitol. 1984; 70: 629-633Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Within these aggregates the trophozoites will eventually differentiate to the cyst form. Encystation appears to be dependent upon this aggregation; millimolar amounts of free galactose, which inhibit aggregation, also prevent differentiation of the trophozoites to cysts (14Cho J. Eichinger D. J. Parasitol. 1998; 84: 705-710Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Whether the parasite forms such aggregatesin vivo is unknown. A common soil amoeba,Dictyostelium discoideum, forms large masses of 105 or more cells when its food supply of bacteria is depleted (15Gross J.D. Microbiol. Rev. 1994; 58: 330-351Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A number of diffusible factors are involved in signaling between D. discoideum cells during the aggregation phase that precedes differentiation (16Mehdy M.C. Firtel R.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1985; 5: 705-713Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar, 17Clarke M.L. Yang J. Kayman S. Dev. Genet. 1988; 9: 315-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 18Jain R. Yuen I.S. Taphouse C.R. Gomer R.H. Genes Dev. 1992; 6: 390-400Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Additionally, a large number of Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria, as well as fungi, secrete signaling molecules (so-called autoinducers) that induce changes in gene expression, which can result in differentiation (19Gruenheid S. Finlay B.B. Trends Microbiol. 2000; 8: 442-443Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar, 20Day W.A.J. Maurelli A.T. Infect.

Catecholamines are biogenic amines that contain a catechol nucleus (a benzene ring with two adjacent hydroxyl substituents) and an amine group. In mammalian systems the catecholamines (dopamine, norepinephrine, and epinephrine) function as hormones and neurotransmitters that regulate a variety of physiologic functions, including heart rate, blood pressure, and levels of circulating glucose (22Malven P.V. Mammalian Neuroendocrinology. CRC Press, Ann Arbor, MI1993Google Scholar). In both plants and animals, these compounds are synthesized from tyrosine in the order: dopamine → norepinephrine → epinephrine. In mammalian systems, cell surface receptors that selectively bind catecholamines are divided into two major classes, dopaminergic and adrenergic. Adrenergic receptors can be divided into three types, α1, α2, and β, and each of these can be further divided into several subtypes, based on pharmacological differences and amino acid sequence (23Docherty J.R. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 1998; 361: 1-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar, 24Johnson M. Am. J. Respir. Crit. Care Med. 1998; 158: S146-S153Crossref PubMed Scopus (348) Google Scholar). Hartmannella vermiformis, a nonpathogenic free-living amoeba that plays a major role in the continuous environmental presence and amplification of Legionella pneumophila, the causative agent of Legionnaire's disease (26Fields B.S. Trends Microbiol. 1996; 4: 286-290Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (444) Google Scholar), will encyst when one of a variety of bioactive amines, including catecholamines, are added to a non-nutrient medium (25Verma A.K. Raizada M.K. Krishna Murti C.R. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1974; 23: 57-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Uptake of epinephrine by these cells is inhibited by the β-adrenergic receptor (β-AR) antagonist propranolol, which also inhibits differentiation of the amoeba into the cyst form (27Verma A.K. Krishna Murti C.R. Indian J. Biochem. Biophys. 1976; 13: 71-74PubMed Google Scholar). A differentiation response similar to that obtained with these bioactive amines is also seen after the addition of dibutyryl cyclic AMP to the cultures (28Raizada M.K. Krishna Murti C.R. J. Cell Biol. 1972; 52: 743-748Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar), indicating the involvement of adenylyl cyclase in the regulation ofHartmannella differentiation. These results imply the presence of a β-AR on the Hartmannella surface, but the characterization of such a receptor, and the source of its ligands, have not been reported. Here we show that the enteric amoeba, E. invadens, also encysts in response to the binding of catecholamines. Trophozoite stages of both E. invadens and E. histolyticacontain dopamine, norepinephrine, and epinephrine, and E. invadens trophozoites release epinephrine upon transfer to encystation medium that contains a ligand for the amoeba surface galactose lectin. E. invadens binds catecholamines via a β1-adrenergic receptor on the trophozoite surface, and this catecholamine ligand-receptor system acts downstream of the galactose lectin and upstream of adenylyl cyclase.

E. histolytica was maintained at 35 °C in 50-ml culture flasks containing 50 ml of BYI-S-33 medium supplemented with 15% ABS. Trophozoites were harvested from 50-ml cultures in BYI-S-33 and washed with 50 ml of ice-cold 100% LG (BYI without glucose). The amoebae were resuspended in various encystation media to yield a final concentration of 5 × 105trophozoites/ml in 5-ml glass screw-cap tubes and incubated at 25 °C for 48 h. The tubes were chilled in ice/water for 10 min, and the total number of cells (trophozoites and cysts) was determined using a hemacytometer. The cells were harvested by centrifugation, resuspended in 0.1% Sarkosyl, and incubated on ice for 10 min. The remaining detergent-resistant cysts were counted, and the percentage of encystation was determined. Cultures consisting of trophozoites incubated in complete encystation medium (47% LG containing 5% ABS), and in encystation medium lacking serum, were established for all encystation experiments as controls to monitor encystation efficiency. All encystation experiments were performed more than once using duplicate or triplicate cultures for each induction condition. Data are presented as mean ± S.E.

The sample was heated at 100 °C for 5 min and then centrifuged at 15,000 × g for 15 min at room temperature to remove protein. The supernatant was stored at −20 °C until analysis. For analysis of medium from high and low cell density cultures,E. invadens trophozoites were harvested from 50-ml cultures in BYI-S-33 and washed with ice-cold AWB. The amoebae were resuspended in BYI-S-33 (without serum) to yield final concentrations of 3 × 104 trophozoites/ml (low density) or 3 × 105 trophozoites/ml (high density).

After a 2-h incubation at 25 °C, the tubes were chilled in ice/water for 10 min, and the amoebae were pelleted by centrifugation. The medium was analyzed for catecholamines as described above. Samples were prepared as previously described (31Merali S. Clarkson Jr., A.B. J. Chromatogr. B Biomed. Appl. 1996; 675: 321-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar) with some modifications. Briefly, 5 μl of trophozoite lysates or media were mixed with 75 μl of borate buffer by vortexing. Twenty microliters of the AccQ-Fluor reagent (N-hydroxysuccinimidyl-6-aminoquinoyl carbamate) was then added to give a final volume of 100 μl, and the sample was vortexed vigorously. Samples were also spiked with 10 μl of 1 mmaqueous solutions of (−)-epinephrine, (−)-norepinephrine, or (±)-dopamine to verify the presence of the three different catecholamine peaks. These samples were prepared as above with the exception of the addition of 65 μl of borate buffer. An internal standard, 2 μl of 1 mm 1,7-diaminoheptane, was included in every injection. All derivatized samples were analyzed within 1 h of preparation, and each sample was analyzed in triplicate. The Waters HPLC used for analysis of trophozoite lysates included a quaternary pump (model 625), a system controller (model 600E), an autosampler (model 715), and a fluorescence detector (model 470). Waters Millenium software was used to control the system, collect data, and calculate peak area values. A 5-μm silica particle C8 Symmetry column (3.9 × 150 mm, inner diameter) with a 100-Å pore size (Waters) was used for separation. The elution buffer consisted of 0.14m sodium acetate, 0.017 m triethylamine-HCl, pH 5.05 (eluent A). Fluorescence excitation was at 250 nm, and emission was detected at 395 nm. Elution was at 1.0 ml min−1. The mobile phase gradient was as previously described for polyamine analysis (31Merali S. Clarkson Jr., A.B. J. Chromatogr. B Biomed. Appl. 1996; 675: 321-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar), except the last step was a linear gradient starting at 83% eluent A, 17% acetonitrile extending to 60% eluent A, 40% acetonitrile over 20 min. The suitability of the analytical system was assured by demonstrating that (−)-epinephrine, (−)-norepinephrine, (±)-dopamine, and an internal standard were resolved from each other and from all other potentially interfering peaks in the biological sample. To demonstrate linearity, a series of standard aqueous solutions for each of the three catecholamines ((−)-epinephrine, (−)-norepinephrine, and (±)-dopamine) ranging from 1.25 to 50 nmol were used to construct calibration curves. Linear curves with r values greater than 0.99 (r > 0.99) were obtained for each catecholamine standard. The internal standard, 2 μl of 1 mm1,7-diaminoheptane, was included in every injection. Each sample was analyzed in triplicate. E. invadens and E. histolyticatrophozoites were harvested from 50-ml cultures in BYI-S-33 by centrifugation and washed with ice-cold AWB. Trophozoites were resuspended at 3 × 105/ml in either BYI medium or 100% LG encystation medium containing either 5% ABS or 1 μg/ml ASF. After a 15-min incubation at room temperature, the tubes were placed on ice. [3H](−)-CGP 12177 was added to a final concentration of 40 pm in the presence or absence of 500 μm (±)-metoprolol and incubated on ice for 30 min. (Previous time-course experiments had indicated that equilibrium under these conditions is reached after 15 min.) The cells were bound to Whatman GF/B glass fiber filters, washed twice with 3 ml of ice-cold AWB, and dried overnight. Filters were subsequently counted in 3 ml of Betaplate Scint in an LKB model 1214 scintillation counter. For saturation binding experiments, E. invadens and E. histolytica trophozoites were harvested from cultures grown in BYI-S-33 as described above and induced to encyst in 100% LG encystation medium containing 1 μg/ml ASF or 5% ABS for 15 min at room temperature. Trophozoites were chilled on ice, harvested, and resuspended in fresh medium containing various concentrations of [3H](−)-CGP 12177 and incubated on ice for 30 min. The cells were bound to glass fiber filters, washed, dried, and counted as described above. For competition binding experiments, E. invadens tropohozoites were harvested from cultures grown in BYI-S-33 as described above, and induced to encyst in 47% LG medium containing 1 μg/ml ASF for 15 min at room temperature. Trophozoites were chilled on ice, harvested, and resuspended in fresh medium. [3H](−)-CGP 12177 was added to a final concentration of 8 pm in the presence or absence of 500 μm(±)-alprenolol, (±)-propranolol, (±)-metoprolol, or (−)-timolol, and incubation was continued on ice for 30 min. The cells were processed over glass fiber filters as above. We had previously found that efficient (≥90%)in vitro encystment of E. invadens required the presence in the cyst induction medium of ligands for a cell surface galactose lectin (9Coppi A. Eichinger D. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1999; 102: 67-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar), and that much lower levels (10–25%) of cyst formation occurred in their absence. To determine whether catecholamines were recognized by E. invadens and acted at a step subsequent to the required lectin-ligand interactions, catecholamines were added to cyst induction medium that was made without the bovine serum source of the galactose ligand(s). (+)-Epinephrine functionally substituted for serum and induced the same high levels of cyst formation normally obtained with complete encystation medium (Fig. 1). Titration of (+)-epinephrine in the serum-free encystation medium gave a biphasic curve with levels of maximum encystation at 5 μm and 5 mm. (−)-Epinephrine was effective at slightly lower concentrations (100–500 nm) (Fig. 1), reflecting the higher stimulatory activity of the purer (minus)-isomer of this compound. (−)-Norepinephrine supported maximal encystation at 1 μm and 1 mm (Fig. 1). Background levels of encystation were obtained with lower micromolar amounts of this compound, whereas higher millimolar amounts were amebicidal (data not shown). Addition of (+)-dopamine or 3-(3,4-dihydroxyphenyl)alanine (l-DOPA) to the serum-free induction medium was either toxic to the amoebae or yielded ∼50% levels of encystation through a concentration range of 100 nm to 1 mm (data not shown). To obtain maximal levels of encystment in vitro, the density of E. invadens trophozoites in encystment medium must be between 2 × 105/ml and 5 × 105/ml (8Rengpien S. Bailey G.B. J. Parasitol. 1975; 61: 24-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). To determine whether exogenous epinephrine could overcome this trophozoite density requirement, cultures at optimal (3 × 105/ml) or suboptimal (3 × 104/ml) densities were supplied with either 5 μm or 5 mm (±)-epinephrine. A concentration of 5 μm(±)-epinephrine supported maximal levels of differentiation of only the high density culture, whereas 5 mm (±)-epinephrine induced maximal or near maximal encystment of both high and low density cultures (Fig. 2). Epinephrine and norepinephrine are ligands for both α- and β-ARs (32Cooper J.R. Bloom F.E. Roth R.H. The Biochemical Basis of Neuropharmacology.7th Ed. Oxford University Press, New York1996: 226-292Google Scholar). To start to define the specificity of the presumedE. invadens AR, we tested adrenergic agonists that exhibit known α- and β-receptor specificities. At concentrations from 10 nm to 100 μm, the α-AR agonistl-phenylephrine did not stimulate levels of encystation much above background (Fig. 3), and higher amounts were amebicidal. In contrast, the β-AR agonist isoproterenol supported maximal levels of encystation at a concentration of 100 nm. The encystation levels obtained with this compound were similar to those obtained with induction medium containing either serum or 5 μm exogenous epinephrine. Approximately 50-fold less isoproterenol than epinephrine was required to elicit maximal encystation, consistent with the known increased potency of the synthetic compound in other adrenergic receptor systems (24Johnson M. Am. J. Respir. Crit. Care Med. 1998; 158: S146-S153Crossref PubMed Scopus (348) Google Scholar). To demonstrate the presence in the ameba of a particular subtype of β-AR, we tested the β1-specific agonist dobutamine. Dobutamine induced greater than 90% encystation at a concentration of 1 μm (Fig. 3). The selectivity of the putative AR involved in ameba encystation was further addressed by testing the ability of AR subtype-selective antagonists to block encystation that was induced by addition of either serum or exogenous catecholamines. The α-AR antagonist phentolamine had little inhibitory effect on encystation in either type of medium even at 500 μm(Table I). In contrast, the β-AR antagonists alprenolol and propranolol substantially inhibited encystation in both types of medium. Encystation levels were less than 50% of control when these antagonists were added at 25 to 100-fold molar excess over the exogenously added epinephrine. The β2-AR antagonist ICI-118,551 did not inhibit encystation, whereas the β1-AR antagonists metoprolol and timolol (Table I), as well as CGP-20712A (data not shown), very effectively inhibited encystation. The levels of encystation that occurred in the presence of timolol or metoprolol were below the “background” levels that were obtained with serum-free medium to which no exogenous catecholamines were added. This suggested that even the background encystation was occurring in a catecholamine-dependent manner and that therefore the binding of catecholamines to a β1-AR on the amebae is necessary for (in vitro) differentiation of this enteric parasite.Table IEffect of α- and β-adrenergic receptor antagonists on E. invadens encystationAntagonistPercentage of encystation47% LG with serum47% LG with epinephrineNone93.1 ± 0.8088.8 ± 0.82Phentolamine (α)84.6 ± 2.0578.0 ± 1.70Alprenolol (β)44.8 ± 2.7539.1 ± 2.90Propranolol (β)45.9 ± 0.3036.2 ± 1.65Metoprolol (β1)13.7 ± 1.509.5 ± 2.70Timolol (β1)10.4 ± 1.2512.2 ± 1.25ICI-118,551 (β2)87.0 ± 0.1084.6 ± 1.45 Open table in a new tab While exploring the ability of various effector molecules to bypass the galactose lectin requirement and stimulate encystation, we had previously found that dibutyryl cAMP (db-cAMP) would efficiently substitute for the galactose ligand and stimulate E. invadens encystation (data not shown). To begin to understand the functional connections between the three signaling or effector systems that can induce encystation, we examined the ability of β1-AR antagonist metoprolol to block encystation that was induced with mucin (20 μg/ml), epinephrine (5 μm), or db-cAMP (100 μm). Metoprolol (250 μm) blocked 74% of the mucin-induced encystation, all of the epinephrine-induced encystation, and none of the db-cAMP-induced encystation (Fig. 4), indicating that the putative ameba β1-AR acted downstream of the lectin and upstream of adenylyl cyclase. The synthetic catechol-like compound CGP 12177 is hydrophilic, does not traverse plasma membranes of intact cells, and therefore selectively binds to catecholamine receptors on the surface of cells (33Heithier H. Hallmann D. Boege F. Reilander H. Dees C. Jaeggi K.A. Arndt-Jovin D. Jovin T.M. Helmreich E.J.M. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 9126-9134Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). [3H]CGP 12177 ([3H]CGP) bound in a saturable manner to live E. invadens trophozoites at 4 °C, and the binding was inhibited by the presence of 500 μm metoprolol (TableII). Trophozoites exposed to different media displayed differing amounts of [3H]CGP binding capacity. Trophozoites in vegetative growth medium containing serum (BYI/ABS) bound less [3H]CGP than trophozoites in the same medium containing ASF in place of serum (BYI/ASF). Metoprolol (500 μm) inhibited ≥70% of the [3H]CGP binding to amebae in BYI-based media. Trophozoites transferred to encystation medium containing serum (100% LG/ABS) for 15 min bound ∼30% more [3H]CGP as cells in BYI/ABS, and an additional increase in binding was observed with cells transferred to 100% LG containing ASF. As before, ≥75–80% of the binding to the cells in the encystation medium was inhibited by 500 μm metoprolol. Saturation binding analysis of [3H]CGP to trophozoites exposed to the medium (100% LG/ASF) that most closely mimicked encystation induction conditions, and resulted in the highest level of CGP 12177 binding, yielded a K d of 2.35 ± 0.59 pm, and a B max value of 98.93 ± 6.6 fmol/mg protein (Fig. 5).Table IIBinding of the β-adrenergic receptor antagonist [3H](−)-CGP 12177 to the surface of E. invadens and E. histolytica trophozoitesBinding conditionsE. invadensE. histolyticafmol CGP bound/ mg proteinBYI + 5% ABS21.124.2BYI + 5% ABS + metoprolol (500 μm)12.3BYI + ASF (1 μg/ml)25.914.1BYI + ASF (1 μg/ml) + metoprolol (500 μm)7.90.7100% LG + 5% ABS34.532.1100% LG + 5% ABS + metoprolol (500 μm)7.27.8100% LG + ASF (1 μg/ml)44.643.4100% LG + ASF (1 μg/ml) + metoprolol (500 μm)8.712.1 Open table in a new tab [3H]CGP also bound in a saturable manner to live E. histolytica trophozoites at 4 °C, and the binding was inhibited in the presence of 500 μm metoprolol (Table II).

This study addresses the nature of the relevant endopeptidase activity in rat liver that is responsible for most receptor-mediated insulin degradation in vivo. The endosomal activity was shown to be aspartic acid protease cathepsin D (CD), based on biochemical similarities to purified CD in 1) the rate and site of substrate cleavage, 2) pH optimum, 3) sensitivity to pepstatin A, and 4) binding to pepstatin A-agarose. The identity of the protease was immunologically confirmed by removal of greater than 90% of the insulin-degrading activity associated with an endosomal lysate using polyclonal antibodies to CD. Moreover, the elution profile of the endosomal acidic insulinase activity on a gel-filtration TSK-GEL G3000 SWXL high performance liquid chromatography column corresponded exactly with the elution profile of the immunoreactive 45-kDa mature form of endosomal CD.

In liver parenchyma the endosomal degradation of internalized insulin is thought to occur after acidification of the endosomal lumen by a soluble enzyme termed endosomal acidic insulinase (EAI) (2Authier F.

Endocrinology. 2001; 142: 276-289Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar), although this protease has yet to be identified. EAI, which was easily extracted by hypotonic shock from hepatic endosomes, displayed an acidic pH optimum for insulin binding and degradation (2Authier F. Rachubinski R.A. Posner B.I. Bergeron J.J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 3010-3016Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 3Di Authier F. Guglielmo G.M. Danielsen G.M. Bergeron J.J.M. Biochem.

Endocrinology. 2001; 142: 276-289Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). The events leading to the endosomal proteolysis of internalized insulin by EAI involve initial binding of the C-terminal region of the B chain of insulin to EAI followed by two initial proteolytic cleavages at PheB24-PheB25 and PheB25-TyrB26 peptide bonds (11Authier F. Danielsen G.M. Kouach M. Briand G. Chauvet G. Endocrinology. 2001; 142: 276-289Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). This is followed by the hydrolysis of seven peptide bonds in the C terminus of the insulin B chain and, in the central region of the insulin A and B chains, via an ordered sequential pathway. The high IC50value of insulin for EAI (2–4 × 10−5m) and the high proteolytic activity and affinity of EAI for insulin B chain and a B22–30 insulin fragment suggest that EAI is a nonspecific peptidase whose physiological substrates other than insulin within the endosomal apparatus have yet to be defined (11Authier F. Danielsen G.M. Kouach M. Briand G. Chauvet G. Endocrinology. 2001; 142: 276-289Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). In support of this, we have recently demonstrated that cathepsin B, a general cysteine protease, down-regulates internalized epidermal growth factor and glucagon within rat liver endosomes (5Authier F.

Previous attempts to purify and identify EAI have been made using the radiolabeled peptide [125I-TyrA14]insulin to measure endosomal hydrolysis of insulin by monitoring the increase in soluble counts after precipitation of radioactive insulin with cold trichloroacetic acid (2Authier F. Rachubinski R.A. Posner B.I. Bergeron J.J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 3010-3016Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 3Di Authier F. Guglielmo G.M. Danielsen G.M. Bergeron J.J.M. Biochem. J. 1998; 332: 421-430Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Based on the trichloroacetic acid precipitation assay, endosomal proteolysis of [125I-TyrA14]insulin was partially inhibited by chelating agents, thiol reagents, pepstatin A, leupeptin, and bacitracin (2Authier F. Rachubinski R.A. Posner B.I. Bergeron J.J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 3010-3016Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, none of the protease inhibitors was individually capable of completely inhibiting [125I-TyrA14]insulin proteolysis, suggesting the contribution of more than one protease to the processing of radioactive insulin. Later, using an alternate approach based on reverse-phase (RP) HPLC and mass spectrometry analysis in which hydrolysis was measured by the generation of degradation products from unlabeled HI, we elucidated the entire structure of nine early insulin intermediates generated within hepatic endosomes, all of which contained the A14 tyrosine residue in their sequence and displayed a molecular mass higher than 3125 Da (11Authier F. Danielsen G.M. Kouach M. Briand G. Chauvet G. Endocrinology. 2001; 142: 276-289Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Indeed, all of the early insulin intermediates identified in this study were not trichloroacetic acid-soluble (11Authier F. Danielsen G.M. Kouach M. Briand G. Chauvet G. Endocrinology. 2001; 142: 276-289Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Consequently, the trichloroacetic acid solubility of radioactive products, which greatly underestimates actual degradation, reflects additional and/or further processing of transient insulin intermediates and their late transformation into short end products and/or free amino acids by endosomal proteases that are possibly distinct from EAI. These concerns were addressed in this study by using native HI as the substrate and RP HPLC to improve the specificity of the degradation assay and identify the nature of EAI. An early time point of HI digestion was always chosen for RP HPLC analysis, when the two primary products A1–21-B1–24 and A1–21-B1–25 insulin were the most abundant. These improvements in the methodology used to evaluate the proteolytic activity have allowed us to identify the role of the aspartic acid protease cathepsin D in the endosomal processing of insulin.

Endosomal fractions isolated after the injection of HI were suspended at 1.5 mg/ml in 62.5 mm Tris/HCl, pH 6.8, 2% SDS, 10% glycerol, 2% β-mercaptoethanol and heated at 100 °C for 2 min. Samples were then subjected to SDS-PAGE, followed by Western blotting to determine the integrity and phosphotyrosine content of the internalized insulin receptor. Electrophoresed samples were transferred to nitrocellulose membranes (0.45 × 10−6m) for 60 min at 380 mA in transfer buffer containing 25 mmTris base and 192 mm glycine. The membranes were blocked by a 3-h incubation with 5% skim milk or 2% bovine serum albumin (for phosphotyrosine immunoblots) in 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 300 mm NaCl, and 0.05% Tween 20. The membranes were then incubated with primary antibody (rabbit polyclonal antisera against either mouse cathepsin D R291 diluted 1:1500, human BACE diluted 1:1000 or rat cathepsin L R958 diluted 1:200, affinity-purified polyclonal antibodies to insulin receptor diluted 1:1000, monoclonal anti-phosphotyrosine diluted 1:2500) in the above buffer for 16 h at 4 °C. After incubation, the blots were washed 3 times with 0.5% skim milk or 0.2% bovine serum albumin (for phosphotyrosine immunoblots) in 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 300 mmNaCl, and 0.05% Tween 20 over a period of 1 h at room temperature. The bound immunoglobulin was detected using horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG for the polyclonal antibody or horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG for the monoclonal anti-phosphotyrosine antibody. Soluble endosomal extract (ENs) (≈1 ng) was incubated for varying lengths of time at 37 °C with 5 × 10−5m human insulin, insulin A chain, or insulin B chain in 200 × 10−6liters of 50 mm citrate-phosphate, pH 4, in the presence or absence of protease inhibitors. The samples were then acidified with acetic acid (15%) and immediately loaded onto a RP HPLC column. In some experiments, ENs was immunodepleted of active insulin-degrading enzyme, cathepsin L, cathepsin B, or cathepsin D before the digestion step by incubating ENs (0.15 mg/ml) with antibodies coated to protein G-Sepharose for 16 h at 4 °C in 800 × 10−6liters of 20 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7. The fractions were then centrifuged for 5 min at 10,000 ×g av, and the resultant supernatants were adjusted to pH 4 with citrate-phosphate buffer and used in the HI degradation assay. The reaction was terminated by the addition of 15% acetic acid and immediately assayed by RP HPLC. Native HI, insulin A chain, and insulin B chain were also digestedin vitro with bovine cathepsin D. Insulin peptides (5 × 10−5m) were incubated with 0.025 units/ml cathepsin D in 0.1 m citrate-phosphate, pH 4. After 5–60 min of incubation at 37 °C, the proteolytic reaction was stopped by adding acetic acid (15%), and the samples were immediately analyzed by RP HPLC. RP HPLC was performed on a Beckman Coulter System Gold model 127 liquid chromatograph equipped with a Rheodyne sample injector fitted with a 500-μl loop and a microBondapak C18 column (Waters, 0.39 × 30 cm; 10−5 m particle size). Samples were chromatographed using a mixture of 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid in water (solvent A) and 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid in acetonitrile (solvent B) with a flow rate of 1 ml/min. Elution was carried out using two sequential linear gradients of 0–15% solvent B (5 min) and 15–39% solvent B (32 min) followed by an isocratic elution of 39% solvent B (13 min). Eluates were monitored on-line for absorbance at 214 nm with a LC-166 spectrophotometer (Beckman Coulter). ENs (0.15 mg/ml) was incubated for 15 h at 4 °C with pepstatin A-agarose in 20 mm citrate-phosphate buffer, pH 7. After centrifugation at 20,000 × g avfor 5 min, the resultant supernatant was tested for its ability to degrade 10−6m HI in 300 mmcitrate-phosphate buffer, pH 4, at 37 °C for varying amounts of time, and samples were immediately analyzed by RP HPLC. ENs was loaded onto a TSK-GEL G3000 SWXL HPLC column (Tosoh Corp., 0.78 × 30 cm) equilibrated at 4 °C with 50 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 6. The column was washed with 30 ml of sodium phosphate buffer, pH 6, using a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min. Eluates were monitored on-line for absorbance at 214 nm with an LC-166 spectrophotometer (Beckman Coulter). Each fraction (0.5 ml) was immediately adjusted to pH 4 with 0.5 m citrate-phosphate buffer and evaluated for insulin-degrading activity by incubating with 5 × 10−5m HI at 37 °C for 10 min. The reaction was stopped by the addition of 15% acetic acid, and samples were analyzed by RP HPLC or subjected to SDS-PAGE followed by Western blotting to determine their cathepsin D content. In some experiments, fractions eluted from the gel-filtration HPLC column that contained insulin-degrading activity with the highest specific activity (fraction 20; see Fig. 4 A) were incubated for 15 h at 4 °C with pepstatin A-agarose in 75 mmcitrate-phosphate buffer, pH 7. After centrifugation at 20,000 ×g av for 5 min, the bound proteins were subjected to SDS-PAGE and Western blot analysis. Samples were prepared and analyzed using ion spray mass spectrometry and HPLC electron spray ionization mass spectrometry coupling as previously described (11Authier F. Danielsen G.M. Kouach M. Briand G. Chauvet G. Endocrinology. 2001; 142: 276-289Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Primary hepatocytes were isolated from male Sprague-Dawley rats weighing 180–200 g. Hepatocytes were prepared by collagenase perfusion and purified by Percoll gradient centrifugation (26Seglen P.O. Gordon P.B. Poli A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1980; 630: 103-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar) as modified by Balavoine et al. (27Balavoine S. Feldmann G. Lardeux B. Eur. J. Biochem. 1990; 189: 617-623Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Viability was >85% by trypan blue exclusion. Hepatocytes were suspended in William's E medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 1% penicillin/streptomycin, and 1% glutamine and plated on type-I collagen-coated glass coverslips. Hepatocytes grown on glass coverslips were washed once with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) before incubation with serum-free William's E medium containing 2 μm human insulin. After 20 min at 37 °C, cells were washed 3 times with PBS and fixed with 3% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 20 min. Fixed cells were treated with 100 mm NH4Cl for 15 min, washed with PBS, permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100 in PBS for 4 min, and blocked by a 20-min incubation with 10% horse serum in PBS. Staining consisted of mouse monoclonal antibody to human insulin (diluted 1:100) (Sigma), mouse monoclonal antibody to rat EEA1 (diluted 1:200) (Transduction Laboratories), and rabbit polyclonal antibody to mouse cathepsin D R291 (diluted 1:100) as the primary reagents, followed by Alexa Fluor 488-conjugated goat anti-mouse (diluted 1:100) (Molecular Probes) and Texas Red-conjugated goat anti-rabbit (diluted 1:400) (Jackson Immunoresearch). Laser-scanning confocal microscopy was done with a Zeiss LSM 510 confocal (Axiovert 100 M) inverted microscope equipped with a Zeiss X63/1.4 NA oil immersion objective lens (plan-Apochromat). Fluorescent images were acquired with argon (wavelength 488 nm) and helium neon (wavelength 543 nm) lasers. Simultaneous images corresponding to Alexa Fluor 488 and Texas Red fluorescence were obtained using the multi-tracking function of the microscope. As a substrate, radiolabeled HI may lack many structural features of the natural EAI substrate that might be important in directing protease interaction and cleavage.

Here we show that a repeated sequence in the cytoplasmic tail of synaptophysin mediates the formation of a protein complex containing the GTPase dynamin. The formation of this complex requires a high Ca2+ concentration, suggesting that it occurs preferentially at the sites of SV exocytosis. Coimmunoprecipitation of a dynamin-synaptophysin complex from brain extracts is promoted by dissociation of vesicle-associated membrane protein 2 from synaptophysin. This finding suggests that dynamin only associates with synaptophysinin vivo after vesicle-associated membrane protein 2 (VAMP2) enters the SNARE complex. GTP binding releases dynamin from synaptophysin, possibly serving to regulate dynamin selfassembly during endocytosis. Our results suggest that synaptophysin plays a role in SV recycling by recruiting dynamin to the vesicle membrane. Synaptophysin is a synaptic vesicle (SV) protein of unknown function.

Science. 1987; 238: 1142-1144Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). In addition to synaptophysin, SVs contain the closely related protein synaptoporin (3Knaus P. Marqueze-Pouey B. Scherer H.

Cell Biol. 1995; 131: 1801-1809Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). The function of these proteins is currently unknown. Synaptic transmission, synaptic plasticity, and SV number are unaffected in synaptophysin knockout mice (6McMahon H.T. Bolshakov V.Y. Janz R. Hammer R.E. Siegelbaum S.A. Sudhof T.C. Proc. Natl. Acad.

Hammer R.E. Unni V. Siegelbaum S.A. Bolshakov V.Y. Neuron. 1999; 24: 687-700Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar). The molecular basis for these defects is unknown. The only protein known to interact directly with synaptophysin is vesicle-associated membrane protein 2 (VAMP 2) (9Calakos N. Scheller R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 24534-24537Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 10Edelmann L. Hanson P.I. Chapman E.R. Jahn R. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 224-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar), which mediates vesicle fusion via SNARE complex formation with syntaxin and SNAP 25. Synaptophysin-VAMP 2 complexes purified from synaptosomal extracts do not contain syntaxin 1 or SNAP 25, suggesting that VAMP 2 dissociates from synaptophysin prior to entering the SNARE complex (10Edelmann L. Hanson P.I. Chapman E.R. Jahn R. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 224-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar). These data raise the possibility that the association of VAMP 2 with synaptophysin serves to regulate the availability of VAMP 2 for SNARE complex formation. This hypothesis is supported by a study demonstrating an inverse correlation between the basal rate of SV exocytosis and the extent of synaptophysin-VAMP 2 association (11Bacci A. Coco S. Pravettoni E. Schenk U. Armano S. Frassoni C. De Verderio C. Camilli P. Matteoli M. J. Neurosci. 2001; 21: 6588-6596Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Synaptophysin has also been shown to bind cholesterol, which appears to be required for SV formation (12Thiele C. Hannah M.J. Fahrenholz F. Huttner W.B. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 42-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (450) Google Scholar). This observation suggests a function for synaptophysin in the biogenesis of SVs, a role that had been proposed previously based on the ability of synaptophysin to induce the formation of small clear vesicles in non-neuronal cells (13Leube R.E. Leimer U. Grund C. Franke W.W. Harth N. Wiedenmann B. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 127: 1589-1601Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). To help understand synaptophysin function, we sought to identify synaptophysin binding partners. In this report, we describe a Ca2+-dependent interaction between synaptophysin and dynamin I, a GTPase required for SV endocytosis (14Schmid S.L. McNiven M.A. De Camilli P. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1998; 10: 504-512Crossref PubMed Scopus (354) Google Scholar,15Hinshaw J.E. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2000; 16: 483-519Crossref PubMed Scopus (579) Google Scholar). Our results suggest that synaptophysin may function in vesicle recycling. Indeed, this hypothesis is supported by recent in vivo experiments performed in the squid giant synapse (16Daly C.

The various GST fusion proteins were expressed in Escherichia coli and purified on glutathione-agarose beads. A washed synaptosome fraction was prepared from the cerebral cortex of 6–8-week-old Sprague-Dawley rats essentially as described previously (18Huttner W.B. Schiebler W. Greengard P. De Camilli P. J. Cell Biol. 1983; 96: 1374-1388Crossref PubMed Scopus (879) Google Scholar). Synaptosomes were extracted in 50 mm NaCl, 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 1% Triton X-100, and a protease inhibitor mixture (CompleteTM protease inhibitor without EDTA, Roche Molecular Biochemicals) for 1 h at 4 °C and then clarified by centrifugation at 15,000 × g for 10 min. Synaptosomal extracts at a protein concentration of ∼7.5 mg/ml (unless stated otherwise) were incubated in a volume of 1 ml with ∼50 μg of the indicated GST fusion proteins immobilized on 20 μl of glutathione-agarose beads (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.) for 2–3 h at 4 °C. Binding reactions generally contained either 2 mm EGTA or CaCl2 unless noted otherwise. After binding, the beads were washed three times with 1 ml of extraction buffer containing EGTA or Ca2+. Bound proteins were eluted by boiling in SDS gel sample buffer and resolved on an SDS gel. To test the effect of nucleotides on the ability of dynamin to bind to synaptophysin (Fig. 5 A), synaptosomal extracts were incubated with GST-SYP in the presence of Ca2+ and either no nucleotide or 10 μm GDP or 100 μmGTPγS. All samples contained 1 mm Mg2+. To test whether GTP could release dynamin from synaptophysin (Fig.5 B), synaptosomal extracts were incubated with GST-SYP in the presence of Ca2+. The beads containing the dynamin-synaptophysin complexes were then washed three times with buffer containing no nucleotide or 10 μm GDP, 100 μm GTP, or 100 μm GTPγS. All wash buffers contained 1 mm Mg2+. After washing, the amount of dynamin remaining bound to synaptophysin was assessed by immunoblot. Synaptosomes were extracted in 0.15m NaCl, 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 1% Triton X-100, and a protease inhibitor mixture without EDTA for 1 h at 4 °C and then clarified at 15,000 × g for 10 min. Synaptosomal extracts at a protein concentration of ∼2.5 mg/ml in a volume of 1 ml were precleared with 15 μl of protein A or protein G-agarose beads (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.) for 1 h. Extracts were then incubated at 4 or 30 °C for 30 min in the presence of 2 mm EGTA or 2 mm CaCl2, 2 mm MgCl2 as indicated in the legend to Fig. 4. The Ca2+/Mg2+ treatment served to dissociate synaptophysin from VAMP, the dissociation does not require the addition of ATP (19Prekeris R. Terrian D.M. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 137: 1589-1601Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar)). Extracts were then placed on ice and immunoprecipitated with 3 μg of a monoclonal antibody against dynamin I (D25520, Transduction Laboratories), 10 μl of a rabbit antiserum against VAMP 2 (SV006, Stressgen Biotechnology), or 1–2 μl (ascites fluid) of a monoclonal antibody against syntaxin I (HPC-1, Sigma). Immunoglobulins were collected with 15 μl of either protein A- or protein G-agarose beads for 1 h at 4 °C. Immunoprecipitates were washed three times with 1 ml of extraction buffer containing EGTA or Ca2+. Bound proteins were eluted and resolved on an SDS gel. The following antibodies were used in immunoblots at the indicated concentrations: monoclonal antibody against dynamin I (D25520, Transduction Laboratories) at 0.5 μg/ml; monoclonal antibody against synaptophysin (SY38, Roche Molecular Biochemicals) at 0.5 μg/ml; monoclonal antibody against syntaxin 1 (HPC-1, Sigma) at 1:1000 dilution; polyclonal antibody against VAMP 2 (SV006, Stressgen Biotech) at 1:1000 dilution (Fig. 4 A); monoclonal antibody against VAMP 2 (10Edelmann L. Hanson P.I. Chapman E.R. Jahn R. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 224-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar) (Cl 69.1, a gift of R. Jahn) at 1:2000 dilution (Fig. 4 C); and a polyclonal antibody against synaptojanin (20de Heuvel E. Bell A.W. Ramjaun A.R. Wong K. Sossin W.S. McPherson P.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 8710-8716Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar) (a gift of P. McPherson) at 1:500 dilution. The blocking of membranes, washing of membranes, and detection of signals were done as described previously (21Daly C. Ziff E.B. J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 2365-2375Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To investigate whether synaptophysin associates with synaptic proteins other than VAMP 2, a fusion protein of GST and the 89 amino acid C terminus of synaptophysin (GST-SYP) was immobilized on beads and incubated with a synaptosomal extract. Because Ca2+ is known to modulate many protein-protein interactions in synapses, the binding was done in the presence of EGTA or Ca2+. Synaptosomal proteins that bound to GST or GST-SYP were eluted, resolved on an SDS gel, and visualized by Coomassie Blue staining. In the presence of Ca2+ but not EGTA, GST-SYP bound to a protein of approximately 100 kDa (Fig.1 B). This protein, which was not bound by GST in the presence of either EGTA or Ca2+(Fig. 1 B), was subsequently identified by immunoblot as dynamin I, a neuron-specific GTPase required for synaptic vesicle endocytosis (14Schmid S.L. McNiven M.A. De Camilli P. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1998; 10: 504-512Crossref PubMed Scopus (354) Google Scholar, 15Hinshaw J.E. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2000; 16: 483-519Crossref PubMed Scopus (579) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1 C). GST-SYP did not bind to the synaptic proteins syntaxin 1A and synaptojanin, confirming the specificity of the interaction (Fig. 1 C). To determine the concentration of Ca2+ required for the association of dynamin with synaptophysin, synaptosomal extracts were incubated with GST-SYP in the presence of EGTA or Ca2+ at concentrations of 50, 100, 200, 300, 400, or 500 μm. Bound proteins were eluted and subjected to immunoblot with anti-dynamin antibody (Fig.2 A). The binding of dynamin was very low at 50 μm Ca2+, increased a little at 100 μm, and then increased dramatically at 200 μm after which binding leveled off (Fig. 2 A). Thus, the association of dynamin and synaptophysin requires a high Ca2+ concentration with half-maximal binding occurring at approximately 150 μm (Fig. 2 B). This level of Ca2+ closely matches that which is present in microdomains at sites of SV exocytosis (22Llinas R. Sugimori M. Silver R.B. Science. 1992; 256: 677-679Crossref PubMed Scopus (699) Google Scholar) as a result of the physical association of voltage-gated calcium channels with the SV fusion machinery (23Sheng Z.H. Westenbroek R.E. Catterall W.A. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 1998; 30: 335-345Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). Thus, our results suggest that the association of dynamin with synaptophysin is restricted to sites of SV exocytosis, consistent with the possibility that this complex has a role in vesicle recycling. Because dynamin has been shown to bind Ca2+ with low affinity (24Liu J.P. Zhang Q.X. Baldwin G. Robinson P.J. J. Neurochem. 1996; 66: 2074-2081Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar), the effect of Ca2+ on the formation of the dynamin-synaptophysin complex probably occurs through an effect of Ca2+ on dynamin conformation, although other possibilities can be envisioned. Synaptic vesicles contain two proteins that are structurally related to synaptophysin, synaptoporin-synaptophysin II (3Knaus P. Marqueze-Pouey B. Scherer H. Betz H. Neuron. 1990; 5: 453-462Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar, 4Bixby J.L. Brain Res. Mol. Brain Res. 1992; 13: 339-348Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar) and synaptogyrin (5Stenius K. Janz R. Sudhof T.C. Jahn R. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 131: 1801-1809Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Synaptophysin has a 58% amino acid identity with synaptophysin II (3Knaus P. Marqueze-Pouey B. Scherer H. Betz H. Neuron. 1990; 5: 453-462Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar) but has little sequence homology to synaptogyrin (5Stenius K. Janz R. Sudhof T.C. Jahn R. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 131: 1801-1809Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). The C termini of synaptophysin and synaptophysin II are divergent with the exception of the five juxtamembrane amino acids, KETGW, and the last eight amino acids, PTSF(S/N)NQ(M/I) (Fig.3 A,underlined). The synaptophysin C terminus is characterized by nine repeats of a degenerate pentapeptide with the consensus YG(P/Q)QG (2Sudhof T.C. Lottspeich F. Greengard P. Mehl E. Jahn R. Science. 1987; 238: 1142-1144Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar) (Fig.3 A,boxed). GST fusion proteins containing the C termini of synaptophysin II and synaptogyrin were tested for their ability to pull down dynamin from brain extract in the presence of EGTA or Ca2+. The C termini of both synaptophysin II and synaptogyrin associated with dynamin in a Ca2+-dependent fashion but much less efficiently than synaptophysin (Fig. 3 B). Thus, these three SV proteins are not entirely redundant with respect to this function, as dynamin associates preferentially with the cytoplasmic tail of synaptophysin. To map the synaptophysin sequence required for association with dynamin, we employed a series of truncated GST-SYP fusion proteins. Each was tested for its ability to bind dynamin from brain extract in the presence of Ca2+. A progressive removal of the YG(P/Q)QG repeats resulted in a progressive loss of dynamin binding (Fig. 3 C). Thus, the ability of the synaptophysin C terminus to associate with dynamin is dependent on a region of approximately 60 amino acids that is composed almost entirely of the nine YG(P/Q)QG repeats. The precise requirements for the formation of the dynamin-synaptophysin complex will require more extensive mutagenesis of the synaptophysin C terminus. However, this result may explain the ability of synaptophysin II and synaptogyrin to associate with dynamin albeit with much lower affinity (Fig. 3 B). Both synaptophysin II and synaptogyrin have sequences that are related to the synaptophysin repeats, for example, YGSSG and YSQQA in synaptophysin II and YQSQG in synaptogyrin (Fig.3 A). It has been shown recently that the synaptophysin-VAMP 2 complex can be dissociated in synaptosomal extracts by incubation at 30 °C in the presence of Ca2+ and Mg2+ (19Prekeris R. Terrian D.M. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 137: 1589-1601Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). Although the mechanism underlying this effect is undefined, it seems likely that the addition of Ca2+ to the extract activates a process that is normally triggered in vivo by depolarization-induced Ca2+influx (19Prekeris R. Terrian D.M. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 137: 1589-1601Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). A period of strong synaptic activity, by promoting synaptophysin-VAMP 2 dissociation, would thereby replenish the pool of SVs in which VAMP 2 is free to enter the SNARE complex. Because dynamin presumably binds synaptophysin after SNARE complex formation, it seemed possible that the disruption of synaptophysin-VAMP 2 complexes in synaptosomal extracts might release synaptophysin to bind dynamin. The incubation of synaptosomal extracts at 30 °C for 30 min in the presence of Ca2+ but not in the presence of EGTA almost completely dissociated synaptophysin from VAMP 2 as assessed by coimmunoprecipitation of synaptophysin with anti-VAMP 2 antibody (Fig.4 A). As shown in Fig.4 B, following incubation of extracts at 30 °C in the presence of Ca2+ but not in the presence of EGTA, synaptophysin coimmunoprecipitated with dynamin. Thus, under conditions in which synaptophysin dissociates from VAMP 2, a dynamin-synaptophysin complex forms. Anti-dynamin antibody did not immunoprecipitate syntaxin 1 in the presence of either EGTA or Ca2+, and anti-syntaxin 1 antibody did not immunoprecipitate either synaptophysin or dynamin, demonstrating the specificity of the immunoprecipitations (Fig.4 B). As shown in Fig. 4 C, after incubation of extracts at 4 °C in the presence of Ca2+, the synaptophysin-VAMP 2 complex remained intact, and anti-dynamin antibody coimmunoprecipitated very little synaptophysin. In contrast, after incubation at 30 °C in the presence of Ca2+, the synaptophysin-VAMP 2 interaction was disrupted, and at the same time the amount of synaptophysin coimmunoprecipitated by anti-dynamin antibody increased significantly (Fig. 4 C). This finding suggests that in addition to requiring Ca2+, the interaction of dynamin with synaptophysin is promoted by dissociation of synaptophysin from VAMP 2. This result indicates that synaptophysin forms two distinct complexes in nerve terminals, one with VAMP 2 and one with dynamin. The fact that the association of synaptophysin and dynamin is dependent on dissociation of synaptophysin and VAMP 2 is consistent with a role for the dynamin-synaptophysin complex in a step of the SV cycle after SNARE complex formation. Dynamin function in endocytosis requires that it dissociate from the proteins responsible for recruiting it to the membrane and then self-assemble into a ring around the vesicle neck (14Schmid S.L. McNiven M.A. De Camilli P. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1998; 10: 504-512Crossref PubMed Scopus (354) Google Scholar, 15Hinshaw J.E. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2000; 16: 483-519Crossref PubMed Scopus (579) Google Scholar). The binding of GTP by dynamin has been proposed to play a role in this redistribution presumably by inducing a change in dynamin conformation (25Damke H. Baba T. Warnock D.E. Schmid S.L. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 127: 915-934Crossref PubMed Scopus (1031) Google Scholar, 26Hinshaw J.E. Schmid S.L. Nature. 1995; 374: 190-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (653) Google Scholar). Thus, we examined the effect of nucleotides on the dynamin-synaptophysin complex. Because of the high intrinsic rate of GTP hydrolysis exhibited by dynamin (14Schmid S.L. McNiven M.A. De Camilli P. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1998; 10: 504-512Crossref PubMed Scopus (354) Google Scholar, 15Hinshaw J.E. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2000; 16: 483-519Crossref PubMed Scopus (579) Google Scholar), GTPγS was used to test the properties of GTP-bound dynamin. As shown in Fig.5 A, the binding of dynamin to GST-SYP was dramatically inhibited by GTPγS but not by GDP, indicating that dynamin can associate with synaptophysin in its unoccupied or GDP-bound state but not in its GTP-bound state. In contrast, the association of dynamin with amphiphysin was unaffected by GTPγS (Fig. 5 A,right). To test whether GTP binding releases dynamin from synaptophysin after complex formation has occurred, dynamin was bound to GST-SYP in the absence of nucleotide after which the complex was washed with buffer containing no nucleotide or either GDP or GTP. Washing in the presence of GTP specifically released prebound dynamin from the complex (Fig.5 B,left). This finding suggests that the change in dynamin conformation induced by GTP binding promotes its dissociation from synaptophysin. To test whether the release of dynamin from synaptophysin requires GTP hydrolysis, the wash was performed with GTPγS instead of GTP (Fig. 5 B,middle). GTPγS also released dynamin from synaptophysin, indicating that GTP binding but not GTP hydrolysis is required for release. In contrast, the amphiphysin-dynamin complex was unaffected by the GTP wash (Fig.5 B,right). The sensitivity of the synaptophysin-dynamin complex to the GTP-induced change in dynamin conformation suggests a possible mechanism for regulated release of dynamin from synaptophysin after recruitment to SVs. This outcome might serve to free dynamin for self-assembly and subsequent vesicle fission. The results presented in this report indicate that dynamin interacts with synaptophysin in a Ca2+-dependent fashion. In addition, we show that the interaction is modulated by dissociation of synaptophysin from VAMP and by GTP binding to dynamin. Given the well established function of dynamin in endocytosis (14Schmid S.L. McNiven M.A. De Camilli P. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1998; 10: 504-512Crossref PubMed Scopus (354) Google Scholar, 15Hinshaw J.E. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2000; 16: 483-519Crossref PubMed Scopus (579) Google Scholar), it seems most probable that the association of dynamin with synaptophysin plays a role in vesicle recycling by targeting dynamin to the SV membrane. Indeed, we have recently shown that injection of the synaptophysin C terminus into the squid giant synapse results in a block of vesicle recycling (16Daly C. Sugimori M. Moreira J.E. Ziff E.B. Llinas R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 6120-6125Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). The results presented here suggest that the recycling block results from a disruption of the dynamin-synaptophysin complex. Several important questions regarding the role of a dynamin-synaptophysin complex in SV recycling remain to be addressed. First, do dynamin and synaptophysin interact directly, or does the association require additional synaptic proteins? Attempts to reconstitute a Ca2+-dependent interaction between GST-SYP and dynamin purified from rat brain have yielded inconclusive results (data not shown). One possible explanation for this is that a required protein is missing from the binding reaction. Coomassie Blue staining of the synaptic proteins which bind to the synaptophysin C terminus reveals that dynamin is the major protein (Fig. 1 B). However, another protein(s) essential for the interaction might be present in very low amounts or obscured by the GST-SYP fusion protein. Alternatively, the interaction may be dependent on a particular conformation or post-translational modification of dynamin, which is lost in the purification process. A second question concerns the relatively low amount of dynamin that associates with the GST-SYP fusion protein (Fig. 1 B). Several factors may contribute to this result. Given the wide array of SH3 domain proteins with which dynamin can interact (27Slepnev V.I. De Camilli P. Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2000; 1: 161-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (421) Google Scholar), it is possible that only a small pool of dynamin in the synapse is available to bind synaptophysin. Alternatively, as mentioned above, post-translational modifications might limit the pool of dynamin in a brain extract which is competent to associate with synaptophysin. For example, the dynamin phosphorylation state is known to be dramatically regulated by synaptic activity (28Robinson P.J. Sontag J.M. Liu J.P. Fykse E.M. Slaughter C. McMahon H. Sudhof T.C. Nature. 1993; 365: 163-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar, 29Liu J.P. Sim A.T. Robinson P.J. Science. 1994; 265: 970-973Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). Clearly, further investigation is required to define the parameters that control the formation of the dynamin-synaptophysin complex. However, despite these uncertainties, we have demonstrated that dynamin and synaptophysin can be coimmunoprecipitated from brain extracts, strongly suggesting that these proteins can form a complex in vivo. One of the most intriguing aspects of the dynamin-synaptophysin complex is its dependence on a high Ca2+ concentration (Fig. 2). This finding suggests that the formation of the complex is restricted to sites of SV exocytosis, at which high Ca2+concentrations are found (22Llinas R. Sugimori M. Silver R.B. Science. 1992; 256: 677-679Crossref PubMed Scopus (699) Google Scholar). Although dynamin does not possess a conventional Ca2+ binding site, it has been shown to directly bind Ca2+ (24Liu J.P. Zhang Q.X. Baldwin G. Robinson P.J. J. Neurochem. 1996; 66: 2074-2081Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). In addition, Ca2+ has been shown to modulate the activity of dynamin in liposome vesiculation assays (30Cousin M.A. Robinson P.J. J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 949-957Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 31Spiwoks-Becker I. Vollrath L. Seeliger M.W. Jaissle G. Eshkind L.G. Leube R.E. Neuroscience. 2001; 107: 127-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar), indicating that Ca2+ can regulate dynamin function. Furthermore, these experiments suggested that dynamin binds Ca2+ with low affinity, implying that Ca2+modulation of dynamin function occurs preferentially around vesicle release sites. Taken together, these results suggest the possibility that the Ca2+ dependence of the dynamin-synaptophysin association reflects a Ca2+-induced change in dynamin conformation. We have shown that the dynamin-synaptophysin complex is dissociated by GTP (Fig. 5), suggesting that it is sensitive to dynamin conformation. It is unclear what fraction of dynamin in vivo is normally GTP bound. Although cytosolic GTP concentrations are generally high, dynamin has a very low affinity for GTP and has a high intrinsic GTPase activity (14Schmid S.L. McNiven M.A. De Camilli P. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1998; 10: 504-512Crossref PubMed Scopus (354) Google Scholar, 15Hinshaw J.E. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2000; 16: 483-519Crossref PubMed Scopus (579) Google Scholar). Thus, it is not unreasonable to propose that there is a pool of dynamin at the synapse which is bound to GDP or not bound by nucleotide, and is therefore competent to associate with synaptophysin. Presently, it is unclear as to what is the functional significance of the GTP regulation of the dynamin-synaptophysin complex. One possibility is that it promotes dynamin release from synaptophysin after recruitment to the vesicle, allowing dynamin self-assembly and subsequent endocytosis. This model assumes that after recruitment to the vesicle, dynamin would rapidly associate with GTP. It is possible that the association of dynamin with synaptophysin or with lipids in the vesicle membrane promotes GTP binding, although at present there is no evidence in support of this hypothesis. The most critical question concerning the dynamin-synaptophysin complex is what is its importance to SV recycling? The evidence supporting a functional role for the complex is that injection of the synaptophysin C terminus into the squid giant synapse preterminal disrupts vesicle recycling (16Daly C. Sugimori M. Moreira J.E. Ziff E.B. Llinas R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 6120-6125Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). It is presently unknown to what extent a synaptophysin-dependent recycling pathway plays a significant role in other synapses. If there is more than one mechanism to recruit dynamin to vesicles (i.e. besides the well characterized amphiphysin (14Schmid S.L. McNiven M.A. De Camilli P. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1998; 10: 504-512Crossref PubMed Scopus (354) Google Scholar)), different synapses might rely to varying degrees on a mechanism that requires synaptophysin. In addition, a single synapse under different stimulation conditions might rely preferentially on different endocytic mechanisms. An analysis of synaptophysin knockout and synaptophysin-synaptogyrin double knockout mice has not thus far revealed a role for synaptophysin in vesicle recycling (6McMahon H.T. Bolshakov V.Y. Janz R.

Neuron. 1999; 24: 687-700Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar). For instance, hippocampal synapses in synaptophysin knockout mice do not exhibit any decrease in the number of SVs (7Eshkind L.G. Leube R.E. Cell Tissue Res. 1995; 282: 423-433Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar) as might be expected if synaptophysin is essential for vesicle recycling. However, the clathrin-dependent recycling pathway in which dynamin is recruited to vesicles via amphiphysin (14Schmid S.L. McNiven M.A. De Camilli P. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1998; 10: 504-512Crossref PubMed Scopus (354) Google Scholar) is presumably functional at these synapses and serves to maintain the vesicle pool. In addition, as mentioned above, it is possible that the loss of synaptophysin affects vesicle recycling at a particular subset of synapses. Further work will be required to evaluate the importance of the dynamin-synaptophysin complex in SV recycling at various synapses. While this manuscript was under review Spiwoks-Becker et al. (31Spiwoks-Becker I. Vollrath L. Seeliger M.W. Jaissle G. Eshkind L.G. Leube R.E.

Cytol. 1995; 162: 455-484Crossref Scopus (52) Google Scholar); replication origins are often situated close to matrix/scaffold attachment regions (11Dijkwel P.A. Hamlin J.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 5398-5409Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar, 12Amati B.B. Gasser S.M. Cell. 1988; 54: 967-978Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar, 13Amati B.B.

A. 1998; 95: 14757-14762Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). In this regard, it is of interest to ascertain how replication initiation proteins such as the origin recognition complex (ORC),1 CDC6, and MCM interact with non-chromatin nuclear structures. The ORC, consisting of six subunits ORC1 to -6, was originally identified as binding specifically to definitive origin sequences in budding yeast (15Bell S.P. Stillman B. Nature. 1992; 357: 128-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (999) Google Scholar). Subsequent studies with yeast andXenopus egg extracts suggested stepwise assembly of ORC, CDC6, and MCM, a six-member protein complex, onto chromatin to form prereplication complexes (reviewed in Refs. 16Diffley J.F.X. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 2819-2830Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar and 17Fujita M. Front. Biosci. 1999; 4: 816-823Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). An additional protein(s) is also required for the prereplication complex formation (18Maiorano D. Moreau J. Méchali M. Nature. 2000; 404: 622-625Crossref PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar, 19Nishitani H. Lygerou Z. Nishimoto T. Nurse P. Nature. 2000; 404: 625-628Crossref PubMed Scopus (370) Google Scholar). However, the mode of organization remains largely unknown, especially in higher eukaryotes. For example, in the Xenopusegg extract system, it is unknown how ORC interacts with DNA, and so far physical interactions have not been detected among ORC, CDC6, and the MCM complex (20Coleman T.R. Carpenter P.B. Dunphy W.G. Cell. 1996; 87: 53-63Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar, 21Rowles A. Chong J.P.J. Brown L. Howell M. Evan G.I. Blow J.J. Cell. 1996; 87: 287-296Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). In addition, in mammalian cells, it is also controversial whether a stable ORC hexamer is present. To understand the regulation of DNA replication in mammalian cells, we have been analyzing the spatiotemporal organization of ORC, CDC6, and MCM proteins. We previously developed a method that enables us to remove about 70% of chromatin from HeLa cell nuclei by DNase I digestion under relatively physiological conditions. Using this method, it has been shown that human MCM heterohexamers are associated with the removable chromatin, whereas ORC1 and CDC6 proteins bind to nuclease-resistant structures (22Fujita M. Kiyono T. Hayashi Y. Ishibashi M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 10928-10935Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar, 23Fujita M. Yamada C. Goto H. Yokoyama N. Kuzushima K.

Chem. 2000; 275: 5904-5910Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). As described above, it would be intriguing if ORC1 and CDC6 were associated with non-chromatin nuclear structures. However, this has hitherto not been addressed adequately (for details, see “Results”). We here used a method in which viable HeLa cells are first cross-linked with the cell-permeable protein-protein cross-linker dithiobis(succinimidylpropionate) (DSP; Ref. 25Bäumert H.G. Fasold H. Methods Enzymol. 1989; 172: 584-609Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar), and then chromatin is extensively stripped. We thereby could show an association of ORC1 and CDC6 protein with non-chromatin nuclear structures in viable cells. We have further extended analyses to dissect the relative organization in nuclei of ORC1, ORC2, CDC6, and MCM proteins. HeLa cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 8% fetal calf serum and synchronized in early S phase with 2.5 mmhydroxyurea or 15 μm aphidicolin treatment for 14–18 h or in G2/M phase with 50 ng of nocodazole treatment for 14–18 h. Cells in mid to late G1 phase were obtained as described previously (23Fujita M. Yamada C. Goto H. Yokoyama N. Kuzushima K. Inagaki M. Tsurumi T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 25927-25932Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). MG132 (carbobenzoxy-Leu-Leu-Leu-CHO) dissolved in Me2SO at 20 mm was added to cultures at a final concentration of 20 μm. As a control, cells treated with 0.1% Me2SO were also prepared. HeLa cells in 100-mm plates were washed three times with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) at room temperature and mixed with 10 ml of cross-link buffer (23Fujita M. Yamada C. Goto H. Yokoyama N. Kuzushima K. Inagaki M. Tsurumi T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 25927-25932Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar), and DSP dissolved in Me2SO was added to a final concentration of 200 μg/ml. The plates were gently swirled for 10 min at room temperature, and the reaction was quenched by adding 10 ml of TE buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 1 mm EDTA). The cells were then further washed twice with ice-cold PBS. DSP-treated cells were lysed for 5 min on ice with 1 ml of ice-cold 0.1% TX-100mCSK buffer (22Fujita M. Kiyono T. Hayashi Y. Ishibashi M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 10928-10935Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar) without dithiothreitol and ATP. Multiple protease inhibitors, 200 μm Na3VO4 and 20 mmNaF were also added to the buffer. The cells were then subjected to centrifugation to obtain Triton X-100-extractable fractions. The extracted nuclei were further extracted with 0.5 m NaCl, Nonidet P-40 buffer (0.5 m NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6) and centrifuged to obtain the salt-extractable fractions. The Triton- and salt-extracted nuclei were digested with 1000 units/ml DNase I (10 units/μl, Roche Molecular Biochemicals) in 0.1% TX-100mCSK containing 2 mmMgCl2 and the multiple protease inhibitors at 25 °C for 30 min, and then NaCl was added to a final concentration of 0.5m. The samples were then centrifuged to obtain the solubilized chromatin fraction and the remaining non-chromatin nuclear structures. The samples were added to the same volumes of 2× SDS sample buffer (26Fujita M. Kiyono T. Hayashi Y. Ishibashi M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 4349-4354Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar) and boiled. A thioredoxin fusion protein containing amino acids 1–145 of human ORC2 was produced in Escherichia coliaccording to the manufacturer's instruction (Invitrogen). Rabbits were injected with the purified fusion protein, and anti-ORC2 antibodies were affinity-purified from the antiserum, as described (23Fujita M. Yamada C. Goto H. Yokoyama N. Kuzushima K. Inagaki M. Tsurumi T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 25927-25932Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar, 26Fujita M. Kiyono T. Hayashi Y. Ishibashi M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 4349-4354Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). With Western blotting, anti-ORC2 antibodies recognized a protein migrating at ∼70 kDa in whole cell lysates from HeLa cells, the mobility of which on SDS-PAGE was as expected for ORC2. The antibodies also could immunoprecipitate the 70-kDa protein. Together, we concluded that the 70-kDa protein is ORC2 (data not shown). Preparation and specificity of the anti-human MCM7 and CDC6 rabbit polyclonal antibodies were described previously (23Fujita M. Yamada C. Goto H. Yokoyama N. Kuzushima K. Inagaki M. Tsurumi T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 25927-25932Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar, 26Fujita M. Kiyono T. Hayashi Y. Ishibashi M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 4349-4354Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Anti-HA rat (3F10) or mouse (HA.11) monoclonal antibodies were purchased from Roche Molecular Biochemicals and Berkeley Antibody Co., respectively, and an anti-PCNA mouse monoclonal antibody (PC10) was from DAKO. For immunoprecipitation after in vivo DSP cross-linking, HeLa cells in 100-mm plates were lysed on ice in 0.1% TX-100mCSK buffer. The soluble fraction was separated by centrifugation, and SDS was added to a final concentration of 0.15%. The nuclear pellet was resuspended into 100 μl of radioimmune precipitation buffer (26Fujita M. Kiyono T. Hayashi Y. Ishibashi M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 4349-4354Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar) containing 1.5% SDS, diluted with NET gel buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 0.1% Triton X-100, 1 mm EDTA), and sonicated. Separate aliquots of the lysates were immunoprecipitated with antibody-fixed beads. For immunoprecipitation with anti-HA antibody, 0.1%TX-100mCSK-extracted nuclei isolated as described above were resuspended into 1 ml of 250NTT buffer (250 mm NaCl, 0.5% Triton X-100, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5), and the nuclear extracts were clarified by centrifugation. Separate aliquots of the extracts were then mixed with the anti-HA antibody 3F10 and further incubated after the addition of protein G-agarose beads. The beads were washed with 250NTT buffer. Immunoblotting was performed as described previously (26Fujita M. Kiyono T. Hayashi Y. Ishibashi M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 4349-4354Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Antibody binding was visualized using the ECL system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). All staining procedures were carried out at room temperature except for extraction and incubation with primary antibodies. Cells grown in culture chambers (Nunc) were washed with PBS, fixed for 10 min with 3.7% formaldehyde, and then permeabilized with methanol for 2 min. When extracted with Triton X-100 before formaldehyde fixation, cells were first washed with ice-cold PBS and then treated on ice twice with 0.1%TX-100mCSK containing multiple protease inhibitors. When stained after DSP treatment and subsequent chromatin extraction, cells in the culture chambers were processed as described above before formaldehyde fixation. The fixed cells were blocked for 1 h in 10% normal goat serum in PBS and incubated overnight at 4 °C with primary antibodies diluted in PBS containing 5% normal goat serum. The anti-ORC2, CDC6, and MCM7 rabbit polyclonal antibodies and affinity-purified rabbit antibodies against Epstein-Barr viral BZLF-1 protein as a negative control were used at 1 μg/ml. The anti-HA and PCNA murine monoclonal antibodies and control IgG were used at 5 μg/ml. The samples were then incubated with secondary antibodies for 1 h. These were affinity-purified and cross-adsorbed goat anti-rabbit or mouse IgG antibodies conjugated with AlexaFluor 488 or 594 (Molecular Probes). Neither of the control antibodies yielded specific signals in either single-staining or double-staining experiments. All washes after antibody incubation were done with PBS containing 0.1% Tween 20. The samples were mounted in Vectashield (Vector Laboratories). Image acquisition was performed using a Bio-Rad Radiance 2000 confocal laser-scanning microscope equipped with a PlainApo 60 × 1.4 NA oil-immersion objective. Images were processed and assembled in an Apple G3 computer using Adobe Photoshop 5.0. An oligonucleotide having 5′-HindIII site/Kozak/initiation methionine/2×HA/BamHI site-3′ sequences (5′-AGCTTGCCACCATGTACCCCTACGATGTGCCCGATTACGCCTACCCCTACGATGTGCCCGATTACGCCG-3′) and its complementary oligonucleotide were synthesized, annealed, and introduced into pBluescript to generate pBS2HA. pBSORC1 in which the human ORC1 cDNA is inserted into EcoRV site of pBluescript was provided by Dr. Ohtani. A BamHI site (5′-GGATCC-3′) was introduced into the ORC1 cDNA in place of 5′-ATGGCA-3′sequence encoding the first methionine and the second alanine by oligonucleotide-directed mutagenesis (QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit; Stratagene). The cDNA was then excised with BamHI and cloned into pBS2HA. The sequence of the resultant 2HA-ORC1 cDNA was confirmed by sequencing. The cDNA was excised with HindIII and XbaI and cloned into pTRE2, Tet system expression vector (CLONTECH). The plasmid pTRE2/2HA-ORC1 was co-transfected with the pTKhyg into HeLa Tet-off cells expressing tTA (CLONTECH). Two days later, cells were plated in selective medium containing 250 μg/ml hygromycin B and 100 μg/ml G418. A significant part of CDC6 protein is associated with nuclear components resistant to nuclease-directed solubilization under relatively physiological conditions (23Fujita M. Yamada C. Goto H. Yokoyama N. Kuzushima K. Inagaki M. Tsurumi T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 25927-25932Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar), whereby about 30% of total chromatin remains (22Fujita M. Kiyono T. Hayashi Y. Ishibashi M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 10928-10935Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Therefore, there are two interpretations; one is that the bound CDC6 is associated with non-chromatin nuclear structures, the other is that they bind to nuclease-resistant-specific chromatin region such as heterochromatin. In general, there are three biochemical operations that can define non-chromatin nuclear structures (reviewed in Ref. 2Cook P.R. J. Cell Sci. 1988; 90: 1-6PubMed Google Scholar). To remove chromatin, all the methods employ digestion with nuclease, but different procedures are used to elute the digested chromatin. One procedure is high salt extraction (for the nuclear matrix; Refs. 27Berezney R. Coffey D.S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1974; 60: 1410-1417Crossref PubMed Scopus (786) Google Scholar and28Capco D.G. Wan K.M. Penman S. Cell. 1982; 29: 847-858Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar). However, some proteins may coagulate under high salt conditions and be thereby artificially detected as matrix elements, and some proteins that are associated with the matrix in vivo may be stripped by salt extraction. Second is ionic-detergent extraction after stabilizing the matrix by heating or with CuSO4 (for the scaffold; Ref. 29Mirkovitch J. Mirault M.-E. Laemmli U.K. Cell. 1984; 39: 223-232Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (857) Google Scholar). This may also be associated with problems. The mildest procedure is electroelution of the chromatin under relatively physiological conditions (for the nucleoskeleton; Refs. 8Jackson D.A. Cook P.R. EMBO J. 1986; 5: 1403-1410Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar and 9Hozák P. Hassan A.B. Jackson D.A. Cook P.R. Cell. 1993; 73: 361-373Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (392) Google Scholar). Our fractionation procedure is a simplified version of this method. With all these methods, the trivial possibility also remains that insolubility of matrix-related proteins merely results from their nonspecific aggregation by exposing cells to nonphysiological buffer. It is also a problem that CDC6 appears to be solubilized with nuclease when cells are processed under hypotonic conditions (30Méndez J. Stillman B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 8602-8612Crossref PubMed Scopus (755) Google Scholar). It is known that “the nuclear matrix” is not seen when nuclei are thus prepared, but it is also very possible that nonphysiological hypotonic conditions alter the native nuclear architecture (2Cook P.R. J. Cell Sci. 1988; 90: 1-6PubMed Google Scholar). We considered that the in vivo protein-protein cross-linking method could overcome these limitations. If the CDC6 proteins are associated with non-chromatin nuclear structures in vivo, they could be covalently cross-linked to the structures by treating viable cells with a permeable protein-protein cross-linker. Consequently, the bound protein would become resistant to chromatin stripping. If they bind to specific chromatin but not to the structures, then they would be extracted with chromatin. We chose DSP as a permeable chemical protein-protein (but not DNA-protein) cross-linker. In asynchronous HeLa cells, 50–60% of the CDC6 protein is present as a Triton X-100-extractable form, and the remainder is bound to nuclei (Fig. 1 A; Ref. 23Fujita M. Yamada C. Goto H. Yokoyama N. Kuzushima K. Inagaki M. Tsurumi T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 25927-25932Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). This ratio was not significantly changed when cells were treated with DSP (Fig.1 A). Therefore, the treatment does not generate nonspecific protein aggregation leading to the artificial insolubility. Without cross-linking, almost all of the Triton-insoluble CDC6 was readily extracted with the buffer containing 0.5 m NaCl (Fig.1 A) so that CDC6 is not a classical nuclear matrix protein. In contrast, about 70% of the insoluble CDC6 (40∼30% of total CDC6) became resistant to the salt extraction with DSP treatment (Fig.1 A), indicating that they are covalently cross-linked to salt-insoluble nuclear protein(s). To investigate whether they are linked to chromatin or non-chromatin nuclear structures, the Triton- and salt-extracted nuclei were digested with DNase I followed by further salt extraction. This treatment stripped ∼95% of core histones (Fig. 1 A) and DNA (not shown). Nevertheless, most of the bound CDC6 remained in the resultant nuclear pellets (Fig.1 A). Immunofluorescence staining after the fractionation showed that the cross-linked CDC6 proteins are indeed present in nuclear dots (Fig. 7). We conclude that significant amounts of CDC6 proteins are associated with non-chromatin nuclear structures in viable HeLa cells. These fractions were also examined for MCM7 proteins, which are present in two different forms, Triton X-100-extractable and Triton-insoluble forms (Fig. 1 A; Refs. 22Fujita M. Kiyono T. Hayashi Y. Ishibashi M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 10928-10935Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar and 26Fujita M. Kiyono T. Hayashi Y. Ishibashi M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 4349-4354Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). The insoluble MCM7 was extracted with 0.5 m NaCl as well as CDC6. However, contrary to the CDC6 case, only 10–20% of the insoluble MCM7 became resistant to the salt extraction even after cross-linking, and half of this resistant form was released with chromatin by DNase I digestion (Fig. 1 A). The data are consistent with the conclusion obtained with our original fractionation method that most of the MCM complexes are associated with chromatin not affixed to non-chromatin nuclear structures (22Fujita M. Kiyono T. Hayashi Y. Ishibashi M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 10928-10935Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar).Figure 7Relationship between ORC1 and ORC2, CDC6 or MCM proteins in G1 phase HeLa cell nuclei assessed by immunostaining and confocal microscopic analyses after DSP cross-linking and chromatin extraction. G1-phase HO-2 cells were treated with DSP and then chromatin-extracted as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The processed cells were fixed with formaldehyde and then immunostained simultaneously for 2HA-ORC1 (red) and ORC2, CDC6, or MCM7 (green).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To further confirm our cross-linking method as appropriate, we also examined whether MCM3 and MCM7 are cross-linked in vivo. Triton X-100-extractable and the remaining nuclear fractions were prepared from HeLa cells treated with DSP. The nuclei were then solubilized with SDS and sonication. SDS was also added to the Triton-extractable fractions. These lysates were then immunoprecipitated with anti-MCM7 antibodies. Because MCM hexameric complexes are disrupted with SDS (22Fujita M. Kiyono T. Hayashi Y. Ishibashi M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 10928-10935Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar), anti-MCM7 antibodies do not co-precipitate MCM3 protein without cross-linking. However, with DSP, MCM3 became efficiently co-precipitated with MCM7 (Fig. 1 B). These data further support the utility of our in vivocross-linking method and also strengthen the conclusion of MCM3-MCM7 interactions in viable cells and not in the cell extracts. There remains some controversy as to behavior of CDC6 protein during S phase. Exogenously overexpressed CDC6 is translocated into cytoplasm depending on phosphorylation by CDK2 (31Saha P. Chen J. Thome K.C. Lawlis S.J. Hou Z. Hendricks M. Parvin J.D. Dutta A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 2758-2767Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar, 32Petersen B.O. Lukas J. Sørensen C.S. Bartek J. Helin K. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 396-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (345) Google Scholar). Such relocation is also observed for endogenous CDC6 (23Fujita M. Yamada C. Goto H. Yokoyama N. Kuzushima K. Inagaki M. Tsurumi T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 25927-25932Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). However, it has been also suggested that nuclear-bound CDC6 still remains in S phase (23Fujita M. Yamada C. Goto H. Yokoyama N. Kuzushima K. Inagaki M. Tsurumi T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 25927-25932Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar, 33Williams G.H. Romanowski P. Morris L. Madine M. Mills A.D. Stoeber K. Marr J. Laskey R.A. Coleman N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 14932-14937Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar). To revisit this problem, we examined their localization in HeLa cells by confocal microscope analyses after immunostaining with the anti-CDC6 antibodies. Immunostaining was performed after extracting cells with Triton X-100 before formaldehyde fixation as well as after directly fixing cells with formaldehyde. When formaldehyde-fixed G1 HeLa cells were stained with anti-CDC6 antibodies, nearly homogenous signals were observed in nuclei (Fig. 2 A), as we reported previously (23Fujita M. Yamada C. Goto H. Yokoyama N. Kuzushima K. Inagaki M. Tsurumi T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 25927-25932Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). In contrast, when cells were Triton-extracted before the fixation, focal staining was noted in the nuclei (Fig.2 A). The data together with the data described above (Figs.1 A and 7) suggest that some CDC6 proteins may assemble into foci on non-chromatin nuclear structures. When HeLa cells in early S phase were formaldehyde-fixed and stained with the anti-CDC6, prominent cytoplasmic localization was observed (Fig. 2 A) as we reported previously (23Fujita M. Yamada C. Goto H. Yokoyama N. Kuzushima K. Inagaki M. Tsurumi T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 25927-25932Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). However, focal staining in nuclei was also visible, and the nuclear foci were more clearly observed when cells were first Triton-extracted (Fig. 2 A). Data for CDC6 obtained with DSP-treated asynchronous HeLa cells (Fig.1 A) may represent mainly the situation in G1phase, since ∼60–70% of asynchronous HeLa cells are in G1 phase. To confirm whether CDC6 is still associated with non-chromatin nuclear structure in S phase, we analyzed hydroxyurea-treated early S phase HeLa cells with the in vivo cross-linking method with DSP. Data shown in Fig.2 B indicate that CDC6 proteins are associated with non-chromatin nuclear structures even in S phase. Again, immunofluorescence staining after the fractionation showed that the cross-linked CDC6 proteins are indeed in the nuclei of S phase HeLa cells (Fig. 8). It is thus conceivable that in HeLa cells, the nuclear CDC6 foci assembled in G1 phase persist even after S phase, whereas the soluble form is translocated, although there may be differences among different cell lines in the efficiency with which CDC6 is exported in S phase. Thus, the CDC6 translocation contributes to prohibition of rereplication, but it might be dispensable. Consistent with this notion, a recent report with Xenopusegg extracts demonstrates that unphosphorylatable mutant CDC6 can support normal DNA replication without its nuclear export (34Pelizon C. Madine M.A. Romanowski P. Laskey R.A. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 2526-2533Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). It has been reported that total levels of human ORC1 proteins are constant during cell cycle and that they also bind to nuclear components resistant to nuclease-directed solubilization (24Tatsumi Y.

We propose to name this gene rumA and accordingly name the protein product as RumA for RNA uridine methyltransferase. ribosomal RNA methyl 5-methyluridine open reading frame S-adenosyl methionine high performance liquid chromatography pseudouridine 4-morpholineethanesulfonic acid Most stable RNAs contain post-transcriptionally modified nucleotides that are derivatives of the four common nucleotides (1Bjork G.R.

Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 27: 196-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar). The enzymes that carry out these modifications are often position-specific, and the specificity is largely determined by the tertiary structure of the RNA (3Becker H.F. Motorin Y. Sissler M.

Approximately 1% of a bacterial genome is devoted to encoding RNA modification enzymes.Escherichia coli 16 S rRNA1 has a total of 11 modifications of which 10 are methylated nucleotides, whereas 23 S rRNA has a total of 23 modifications of which 14 are methylated nucleotides (2Rozenski J.

The Ribosome: Structure, Function, Antibiotics, and Cellular Interactions. ASM Press, Washington, D. C.2000: 175-189Google Scholar). Most rRNA modifications are clustered near the functionally important regions of ribosome and are thus speculated to have important functions. For the 24 methylated nucleotides found in E. coli rRNA, only six methyltransferases responsible for seven methylated nucleotides have been characterized. In 16 S rRNA, Fmu methylates the C5 of C967 (8Gu X.R. Gustafsson C. Ku J. Yu M. Santi D.V. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 4053-4057Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 9Tscherne J.S. Nurse K.

Gene (Amst.). 1985; 38: 65-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar), and RsmC methylates the N2 of G1207 in 16 S rRNA (11Tscherne J.S. Nurse K. Popienick P. Ofengand J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 924-929Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). In 23 S rRNA, RrmA methylates the N1 of G745 (12Gustafsson C. Persson B.C. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 359-365Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), RlmB methylates the 2′-O-ribose of G2251 (13Lovgren J.M. Wikstorm P.M. J. Bacteriol. 2001; 183: 6957-6960Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar), and RrmJ methylates the 2′-O-ribose of U2552 (14Caldas T. Binet E. Bouloc P. Costa A. Desgres J. Richarme G. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 16414-16419Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). A common modification found in RNA is the substitution of 5-methyluridine (m5U) for uridine. Two m5Us have been identified at positions 747 and 1939 in E. coli 23 S rRNA. U747 is located in the conserved loop of hairpin 35 in domain II of large subunit rRNA. This loop lines the polypeptide exit channel and makes tertiary contacts with domain V (15Ban N. Nissen P. Hansen J. Moore P.B. Steitz T.A. Science. 2000; 289: 905-920Crossref PubMed Scopus (2813) Google Scholar). U1939 is also present in a conserved loop. In the crystal structure of the 70 S ribosome in complex with tRNAs, the U1939 loop is seen protruding into the major groove of the A-site tRNA near the end of the acceptor stem (16Yusupov M.M. Yusupova G.Z. Baucom A. Lieberman K. Earnest T.N. Cate J.H. Noller H.F. Science. 2001; 292: 883-896Crossref PubMed Scopus (1672) Google Scholar). A highly conserved m5U is found at position 54 in tRNA, and the modification is catalyzed by the enzyme, RUMT (also called TrmA) (17Greenberg R. Dudock B. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 8296-8302Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 18Gu X. Santi D.V. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 2999-3002Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 19Kealey J.T. Gu X. Santi D.V.

A. 1992; 89: 3995-3998Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Sequence homology searches using the RUMT sequence as probe identified two E. coli open reading frames (ORFs), namelyybjF and ygcA, which were predicted to encode m5U methyltransferases (21Gustafsson C. Reid R. Greene P.J. Santi D.V. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 3756-3762Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). This report also suggested that the two ORFs would encode the enzymes responsible for the modifications at positions 747 and 1939. In this study, we describe the cloning of ygcA and the purification and characterization of its protein product. We have demonstrated that the product ofygcA is the 23 S rRNA m5U1939 methyltransferase. In view of its established function, we propose to renameygcA as rumA and the protein product as RumA. Restriction enzymes were from New England Biolabs. SP-Sepharose, phenyl-Sepharose, and [3H-Me]S-adenosyl methionine (AdoMet) were purchased from Amersham Biosciences, Inc. Hydroxyapatite was obtained from Bio-Rad. DEAE-ion exchange paper, DE81, was from Whatman. Plasmid p67YF0 was a gift from Prof. O. C. Uhlenback (Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry, University of Colorado, Boulder, CO), and plasmids pWK1 and pCW1 were gifts from Prof. J. Ofengand (Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, School of Medicine, University of Miami, Miami, FL). DNA and RNA oligonucleotides were purchased from Invitrogen and Dharmacon Research, Inc., respectively. Nuclease P1 and alkaline phosphatase were from Roche Molecular Biochemicals. Nucleoside standards and other chemicals were purchased from Sigma. The rumA (ygcA) ORF was amplified from E. coli genomic DNA by PCR using the N-terminal primer 5′-TACTTGCCATGGCGCAATTCTACTCTG-3′ and the C-terminal primer 5′-CGTACGCGGATCCTATTTAACGCGCGAGAAAA-3′. The PCR product was digested with NcoI and BamHI and ligated with the similarly restricted plasmid pET 15b (Novagen). The ligated product was transformed in E. coli DH5α. Clones were identified by PCR on the whole cells using the T7 promoter primer 5′-TAATACGACTCACTATA-3′ and the C-terminal primer used above. Plasmids were isolated from the clones containing the desired PCR product and confirmed by DNA sequencing performed at the Biomolecular Resource Center, UCSF (San Francisco, CA). The resultant construct was named pRJR. Molecular biology procedures have been described elsewhere (22Sambrook J. Russell D.W. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual.3rd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY2001Google Scholar). pRJR was transformed intoE. coli BL21(DE3) pLysS cells. Cells were grown at 37 °C in Luria Bertani medium containing ampicillin (100 μg/ml) to an optical density of 0.6 at 600 nm. Isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside was added to a final concentration of 1 mm, and cells were grown for an additional 3 h before harvesting. The cell pellet was suspended in buffer A (20 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.0, in 10% glycerol) containing 50 mm NaCl and the protease inhibitor mixture (Complete-Mini™, Roche Molecular Biochemicals) was added. Cells were lysed by two passes through a French press at 16,000 p.s.i., and debris was removed by centrifugation at 15,000 × gfor 15 min. The supernatant was loaded on a SP-Sepharose column, equilibrated with 100 mm NaCl in buffer A, and the column was washed before eluting with a gradient of 100–700 mmNaCl in buffer A. Fractions containing RumA were identified by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and pooled. The pooled fractions were diluted 1:1 with buffer A and loaded onto a hydroxyapatite column equilibrated with 50 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.0, in 10% glycerol. The column was washed and then eluted with a gradient of 100–450 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.0, in 10% glycerol. Fractions containing RumA were pooled, and 3 m(NH4)2SO4 was added to the pool to bring the (NH4)2SO4 concentration to 1 m. This pool was loaded onto a column of phenyl-Sepharose equilibrated with 1 m(NH4)2SO4 in buffer A. The column was eluted with a gradient of 0.6–0 m(NH4)2SO4 in buffer A. Fractions were pooled and concentrated using a Centriprep concentrator (Amicon). The purified protein was analyzed by N-terminal sequencing for 10 cycles of Edman degradation at the Beckman Center, Stanford University. Unmodified RNA substrates were synthesized by runoff transcription of appropriate plasmids using MEGAscript in vitro transcription kit (Ambion, TX). p67YF0 (23Sampson J.R. Uhlenbeck O.C. Proc. Natl.

Ofengand J. Biochemistry. 1987; 26: 2353-2364Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar) digested with AflII, and pCW1 (25Weitzmann C.J. Cunningham P.R. Ofengand J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 3515-3520Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar) digested with Bsu 36I were used as templates for the syntheses of tRNA, 16 S rRNA, and 23 S rRNA, respectively. Ammonium acetate was added to a final concentration of 0.5 m, and the reaction mixture was extracted successively with phenol and chloroform and precipitated with 1 volume of isopropyl alcohol. Transcripts were dissolved in water and separated from any remaining unincorporated nucleotides by passing through Nuc-away spin columns (Ambion, TX). Chemically synthesized RNA oligonucleotides were purchased from Dharmacon Research Inc., and were deprotected using their recommended procedure. After deprotection, RNA was dried using a Speed Vac concentrator and dissolved in water before use. Concentrations of tRNA, 16 S rRNA, and 23 S rRNA were calculated using the reported A 260 unit values of 1600, 67, and 40 pmol, respectively (26Gu X. Ofengand J. Santi D.V. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 2255-2261Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Concentrations of synthetic RNA, 23 S fragment-(736–760), and 23 S fragment-(1930–1969) were calculated using A 260 unit value of 3860 and 2536 pmol, respectively, as provided by the manufacturer. The extinction coefficient of RumA at 280 nm was determined using the method of Gill and von Hippel (27Gill S.C. von Hippel P.H. Anal. Biochem. 1989; 182: 319-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (5073) Google Scholar) assuming all the cysteines were in the thiol form. Absorption spectra were recorded on a HP8452A diode array spectrophotometer. The measured ε280 value for the native protein was 41,500 m−1 cm−1. Methylation assays were done by minor modifications of the procedure of Gu et al. (18Gu X. Santi D.V. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 2999-3002Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Methylation reaction mixtures contained 1 μm RNA, 50 μm [3H-Me]AdoMet (1 Ci/0.2 mmol), 400 units/ml of RNasin, and 0.25 μm enzyme in reaction buffer (200 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 80 mmNH4Cl, 4 mm magnesium acetate, and 12 mm dithiothreitol). The reaction was performed at 37 °C and quenched at the desired time points by adding 20 μl of aliquots to 0.5 ml of 100 mm glycine-HCl buffer, pH 2.3. This mixture was adsorbed on DEAE papers, and the papers were washed with glycine-HCl buffer followed by ethanol and counted for tritium. Kinetic constants were measured by pseudo first order Michaelis-Menten kinetics. To obtain the K m for RNA, AdoMet concentration was kept at 150 μm, and initial velocities were measured at varying concentrations of RNA (23 S rRNA fragment-(1930–1969)) from 0.5 to 14 μm. To obtain theK m for AdoMet, RNA concentration was kept at 25 μm, and initial velocities were measured at varying concentrations of AdoMet from 2 to 160 μm. Enzyme concentration was 0.13 μm. In vitro transcribed 23 S rRNA was methylated using [3H-Me]AdoMet, extracted with phenol and precipitated twice with ethanol. The [3H-Me]-methylated RNA was digested with nuclease P1 followed by calf intestine alkaline phosphate. Unlabeled 3-methyluridine, 5-methyluridine, and 5-methylcytidine were added to the digested RNA, and the mixture was separated on a Hewlett Packard 1090 HPLC system equipped with a reverse-phase C18 ion-pair column (Beckman) using the following conditions: solvent A, 0.25m NH4(OAC), pH 6.0; solvent B, 40% CH3CN; gradient: 0 min, 0% B; 10 min, 5% B; 25 min, 15% B; 30 min, 50% B; flow rate: 1 ml/min. Column eluant was monitored at 260 nm, 1-ml fractions were collected and counted in 5 ml of scintillation mixture (26Gu X. Ofengand J. Santi D.V. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 2255-2261Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). In vitro transcribed 23 S rRNA was methylated using [3H-Me]AdoMet as described above. 12 pmol of methylated RNA and a 66-fold molar excess of DNA oligonucleotide complementary to the region 737–757 (5′-TAATTTTTCAACATTAGTCGG-3′) or 1929–1949 (5′-CCGACAAGGAATTTCGCTACC-3′) were added to 110 μl of hybridization buffer (40 mm MES, pH 6.0, 400 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 80% (v/v) formamide), heated at 90 °C for 10′, annealed at 52 °C overnight, and cooled slowly to room temperature. The hybridization mixture was diluted 10-fold in nuclease reaction buffer (20 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA) and digested with 200 units of RNase T1 for 30 min at room temperature. The RNase-digested material was diluted 4-fold with 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, adsorbed on DEAE paper, washed with a solution of 10 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.5, 200 mm NaCl, and counted for adsorbed radioactivity. A control experiment with no DNA oligonucleotide was also performed. Site-directed mutagenesis was performed on plasmid pCW1 encoding 23 S rRNA using the QuikChange kit (Stratagene). Mutagenic primers for the U747C mutation were 5′-GACCGAACCGACTAATGTCGAAAAATTAGCGGATGAC-3′ and 5′-GTCATCCGCTAATTTTTCGACATTAGTCGGTTCGGTC-3′, and mutagenic primers for the U1939C mutation were 5′-GGTCCTAAGGTAGCGAAACTCCTTGTCGGGTAAGTTC-3′ and 5′-GAACTTACCCGACAAGGAGTTTCGCTACCTTAGGACC-3′. The site of mutation is underlined. The presence of the mutation was confirmed by DNA sequencing. Metal analysis was performed by inductively coupled plasma emission spectroscopy at the Garatt-Callahan Company (Millbrae, CA). The protein sample was extensively dialyzed against 50 mm ammonium acetate buffer. The dialysis buffer was stirred for 2 h with 10 g/liter Chelex-100 sodium form (Bio-Rad) to remove divalent cations and filtered. All glassware was washed with 20% HNO3 and rinsed with Chelex-treated water. The rumA (ygcA) ORF was cloned into pET 15b using PCR. DNA sequence analysis revealed a single base mutation, nucleotide T78G. The mutation was at the wobble position and did not affect the resulting amino acid sequence. This variation in sequence could be because of a PCR error or polymorphism in the population. Cells containing the clone expressed a 50-kDa protein upon induction with isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside. This 50-kDa protein band, which was visible on SDS-PAGE, was absent in the lysate of the cells collected prior to the induction (data not shown). Protein was purified using successive chromatography steps of SP-Sepharose, hydroxyapatite, and phenyl-Sepharose columns as described under “Experimental Procedures.” A yield of approximately 2.5 mg of purified protein was obtained from one liter of E. coliculture. The purity of the protein was estimated by SDS-PAGE to be >95% (Fig. 1). The purified protein was subjected to 10 cycles of Edman degradation. The N-terminal sequencing of the protein yielded the sequence AQFYSAKRRT. The experimentally obtained sequence matched the sequence in the data base (Swiss-Prot accession number P55135) with the exception that the N-terminal initiator methionine was absent. The N-terminal methionine is often cleaved from mature proteins when the residue following it has a small side chain (29Hirel P.H. Schmitter M.J. Dessen P. Fayat G. Blanquet S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 8247-8251Crossref PubMed Scopus (672) Google Scholar) such as the alanine in RumA. In vitro transcribed 23 S rRNA, 16 S rRNA, and yeast tRNAPhe were assayed as possible substrates for catalysis by RumA (Fig. 2). Only reactions with 23 S rRNA showed significant methylation activity. Approximately 0.8 mol of methyl group was incorporated/mol 23 S rRNA. A value close to 1 mol of methylation/mol 23 S rRNA was obtained when a high concentration of enzyme was used (data not shown). There was no detectable methylation of tRNA, and <0.02 mol of methyl group was incorporated/mol 16 S rRNA under the conditions examined. These results indicate that 23 S rRNA is the preferred substrate for RumA, and most probably, it is modified at only one position. 23 S rRNA was methylated [3H-Me] using AdoMet and was enzymatically hydrolyzed to constituent nucleosides. This nucleoside mixture along with exogenously added 3-methyluridine, 5-methyluridine, and 5-methylcytidine as standards was analyzed on reverse-phase HPLC (Fig. 3). The m5U peak eluted at approximately 17 min. More than 90% total radioactivity co-eluted with the m5U peak. This result established that m5U or ribothymidine is the product of the RumA-catalyzed modification. E. coli 23 S rRNA contains two m5Us at positions 747 and 1939. The site modified by RumA was identified by nuclease protection assay and by the reaction of the enzyme with the site-specific mutants of the substrate RNA. Methylated [3H-Me]23 S rRNA was hybridized with 21-residue single-stranded DNA oligonucleotides complementary to either the U747 region or the U1939 region and digested with RNase T1. The RNA protected from digestion was monitored by a DEAE filter binding assay (Fig.4). When the oligonucleotide complementary to the sequence 1929–1949 of 23 S rRNA was used for hybridization, >85% radioactivity was protected and retained on the filter, whereas only 25% radioactivity was retained when oligonucleotide complimentary to the region of U747 was employed for hybridization. In a control experiment in which no oligonucleotide was used, ∼10% radioactivity was retained on the DEAE filter. These results suggested that U1939 or its neighboring residues is harboring the [3H-Me]methyl group. To verify the position of the modified nucleotide, we constructed two single mutants of 23 S rRNA in which either uridine 747 or uridine 1939 was mutated to cytidine. The ability of these two mutants to serve as substrate for RumA was assayed (Fig. 5). In 23 S rRNA U747C, 0.75 mol of methyl group was incorporated/mol of RNA under the conditions examined. There was no detectable methylation of 23 S rRNA U1939C. These results confirmed that U1939 and not U747 is the target for methylation by RumA. We obtained two synthetic fragments of E. coli 23 S rRNA corresponding to sequence 736–760 and 1930–1969, respectively. These fragments were designed based on the structure of the homologous regions of the 50 S subunit of ribosome from Haloarcula marismortui (15Ban N. Nissen P. Hansen J. Moore P.B. Steitz T.A. Science. 2000; 289: 905-920Crossref PubMed Scopus (2813) Google Scholar) and were predicted to have an independently folded structure. We tested these two fragments for their ability to serve as substrates for RumA (Fig.6). The fragment corresponding to the 23 S rRNA sequence 736–760 was not methylated by the enzyme. The RNA oligonucleotide corresponding the 23 S rRNA sequence 1930–1969 was a good substrate for the enzyme and could be fully modified at a rate equivalent to that observed with full-length 23 S rRNA. The apparent K m values for the 40-mer RNA oligonucleotide and AdoMet were 3 and 26 μm, respectively, and the apparent k cat was approximately 0.06 s−1. Purified preparations of RumA were brownish-yellow, indicating the presence of a bound prosthetic group that was identified empirically by the absorption spectrum and was further confirmed by metal analysis employing inductively coupled plasma emission spectroscopy. The absorption spectrum of the enzyme (Fig. 7) showed the usual protein aromatic band at 280 nm. There was also a shoulder at around 325 nm, a broad longer wavelength absorption band from approximately 350 to 400 nm, and a long tail extending well beyond 500 nm. This spectrum is reminiscent of that reported for aconitase (30Emptage M.H. Dreyers J.L. Kennedy M.C. Beinert H. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 11106-11111Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), which contains an iron-sulfur cluster. The spectral similarity between RumA and aconitase suggested the presence of bound iron in the enzyme. The extinction coefficient at 350 nm was measured as 13,100m−1 cm−1. A RumA preparation was dialyzed against divalent metal free ammonium acetate buffer and analyzed for the presence of 19 different metal ions by inductively coupled plasma emission spectroscopy. The results confirmed the presence of iron in the sample. The stoichiometry was calculated as 1.9 equivalents of iron/mol of enzyme based on the measured ε280 value of 41,500 m−1 cm−1. No other divalent cation was detected in the sample. The only other metal observed was sodium, which was a result of the treatment of the dialysis buffer with the sodium form of Chelex 100. The dialysis buffer analyzed as a control also contained sodium and no other metal ion. Mass spectrometry ruled out the presence of any other prosthetic groups such as pyridoxal phosphate, which might have conferred the yellow color (data not shown). This report demonstrates that RumA is an AdoMet-dependent methyltransferase whose substrate is 23 S rRNA. The enzyme does not act upon tRNA or 16 S rRNA. Nucleoside analysis showed the presence of m5U, indicating that RumA methylates the C-5 of the uridine ring. The target nucleotide for the enzyme was identified as U1939 by a RNase protection assay and more conclusively by methylation assays on site-specific mutants of 23 S rRNA. The enzyme is able to efficiently utilize a 40-mer RNA fragment and does not require a complete 23 S rRNA nor any ribonucleoprotein particle for its activity. It was suggested previously that the product of ygcA ORF (RumA) was an AdoMet-dependent methyltransferase (31Koonin E.V. Tatusov R.L. Rudd K.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 11921-11925Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar), and it was further predicted that RumA was an m5U-methyltransferase that would act on 23 S rRNA (21Gustafsson C. Reid R. Greene P.J. Santi D.V. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 3756-3762Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). The results in this study confirm the predictions made by the bioinformatics-based approach. An intriguing finding of this work is the presence of two bound iron atoms in each monomer of RumA. This is the first report of a methyltransferase that binds iron. The mechanism of the tRNA m5U54 methyltransferase, RUMT, has been investigated in detail (19Kealey J.T. Gu X. Santi D.V. Biochimie (Paris). 1994; 76: 1133-1142Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). The catalytic mechanism of RUMT involves a nucleophilic attack at the C-6 of the uridine by the thiolate of Cys-324, direct SN2 transfer of the methyl group from AdoMet to the C-5 of uridine followed by the abstraction of the proton at C-5 and finally the β-elimination of the enzyme to yield m5U. Amino acid sequence comparison of RumA with RUMT shows that Cys-389 is the catalytic nucleophile of RumA, and sequence similarity throughout the catalytic domain strongly suggests that the two enzymes share a common mechanism. This mechanism does not invoke involvement of metal ions in the reaction. Hence, it is unlikely that iron is required for the methyltransferase reaction. AdoMet-dependent methyltransferases have a modular architecture where a common catalytic core and a variable substrate recognition module unite to facilitate the catalysis of a wide variety of substrates (32Fauman E.B. Blumenthal R.M. Cheng X. Cheng X. Blumenthal R.M. S-Adenosylmethionine-dependent Methyltransferases: Structures and Functions. World Scientific Publishing Co., Singapore1999: 1-38Crossref Google Scholar, 33Reid R. Greene P.J. Santi D.V. Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 27: 3138-3145Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). The alignment of RUMT, RumA, and other putative m5U RNA methyltransferases shows that the catalytic domain containing the AdoMet binding motifs and the catalytic cysteine is in the C-terminal region of these sequences (21Gustafsson C. Reid R. Greene P.J. Santi D.V. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 3756-3762Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). The N-terminal extension of RumA contains a sequence motif, C-5X-C-2X-C (residues 81–90), which may be the iron-binding site. Similar motifs have been documented as the signature of the iron-sulfur binding region in ferredoxins (Prosite accession number PDOC 00175) (34Hofmann K. Bucher P. Falquet L. Bairoch A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 27: 215-219Crossref PubMed Scopus (1006) Google Scholar) and other Fe-S proteins (35Flint D.H. Allen R.M. Chem. Rev. 1996; 96: 2315-2334Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). This iron-binding motif is conserved in sequences with high homology to RumA and other putative rRNA m5U methyltransferases, but it is absent in RUMT and other putative tRNA m5U methyltransferases. 2S. Agarwalla, unpublished observation. BLAST searches on Swiss Protein and trembl databases were performed at the Swiss Institute of Bioinformatics using BLAST network service on 12/06/01. RumA, E. coli ORF ybjF, and RUMT sequences were used as probes. Nineteen sequences from three searches with scores higher than 175 were aligned using the software T-COFFEE (www.ch.embnet.org/software/TCoffee.html). It is possible that the iron-binding site forms part of the RNA recognition domain. Several RNA modifications and modification enzymes have been well characterized, but the knowledge of their biological role is mostly obscure. Certain tRNA modifications have been reported to increase the fidelity and efficiency of translation (36Bjork G.R. Durand J.M. Hagervall T.G. Leipuviene R. Lundgren H.K. Nilsson K. Chen P. Qian Q. Urbonavicius J. FEBS Lett. 1999; 452: 47-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). In many cases, deletion mutants for these enzymes did not show significant growth rate defects when grown in either minimal or rich media. These mutants, however, had a selective disadvantage when grown in competition with the wild-type cells (7Ofengand J. Rudd K.E. Garret R.A. The Ribosome: Structure, Function, Antibiotics, and Cellular Interactions. ASM Press, Washington, D. C.2000: 175-189Google Scholar). trmA-encoding tRNA m5U54 methyltransferase and rluD(yfiI)-encoding pseudouridine (Ψ) synthase for Ψ1911, 1915, and 1917 have been found to be essential for the viability and/or growth of cells (20Persson B.C.

RNA. 1998; 4: 1407-1417Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). However, the deficiency in these deletion strains could be resurrected by substitution with genes encoding inactive mutants (20Persson B.C. Gustafsson C. Berg D.E. Bjork G.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 3995-3998Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar, 39Gutgsell N.S. Del Campo M.D. Raychaudhuri S. Ofengand J. RNA. 2001; 7: 990-998Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). These reports indicated the possibility of yet unknown second function for some of the RNA-modifying enzymes. The physiological relevance of RumA and m5U1939 is unknown, however it is tempting to propose an association with the RelA-dependent “stringent response.” This proposal is based in part on the location of U1939 in the ribosome. In the 70 S ribosome structure, the conserved loop containing U1939 tucks into the major groove at the end of the acceptor stem of the A-site tRNA (16Yusupov M.M. Yusupova G.Z. Baucom A. Lieberman K. Earnest T.N. Cate J.H. Noller H.F. Science. 2001; 292: 883-896Crossref PubMed Scopus (1672) Google Scholar), and hence it is strategically located for sensing the presence of uncharged tRNA at this site in the ribosome. During amino acid starvation, the presence of uncharged tRNA at the A-site activates the ribosome bound RelA, resulting in the increased levels of the nucleotide (p)ppGpp, the mediator of the stringent response (40Chatterji D. Ojha A.K. Curr. Opin. Microbiol. 2001; 4: 160-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar). Moreover, rumA and relA are contiguous genes on the E. coli chromosome separated by <50 bases and transcribed in the same direction (28Blattner F.R. Plunkett G. Bloch C.A. Perna N.T. Burland V. Riley M. Collado Vides J. Glasner J.D. Rode C.K. Mayhew G.F. Gregor J. Davis N.W. Kirkpatrick H.A. Goeden M.A. Rose D.J. Mau B. Shao Y. Science. 1997; 277: 1453-1474Crossref PubMed Scopus (6056) Google Scholar). The identification of the methyltransferase gene for m5U1939 has paved the way for further studying the physiological role of this modification situated at an important site of the ribosome.

Inositol-containing compounds play critical and diverse biological roles including signal transduction and second messenger signaling, stress response, and cell wall biogenesis (3Arganoff B.W.

The biosynthesis of inositol follows a common pathway involving first the conversion of glucose 6-phosphate to 1-l-myo-inositol-1-phosphate (MIP) catalyzed by MIP synthase, followed by dephosphorylation catalyzed by MIP phosphatase (5Majumder A.L. Johnson M.D. Henry S.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1348: 245-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). The synthesis of MIP is both the first committed and rate-limiting step in this pathway (5Majumder A.L. Johnson M.D. Henry S.A. Biochim. Biophys.

Significant biosynthesis of inositol has been detected in organs where a significant blood barrier exists, such as the testes or brain (7Hasegawa R. Eisenberg Jr., F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Recent in vivo results in yeast suggest that valproate, a drug used in the treatment of depression, bipolar disorder, and seizure disorder, may act by inhibition of MIP synthase, thus lowering neuronal inositol pools similar to the action of lithium (16Vaden D.L.

A significant collection of both biochemical and chemical data have coalesced to the reaction path first proposed by Loewus and colleagues (Fig. 1 b) (5Majumder A.L. Johnson M.D. Henry S.A. Biochim.

Several inhibitor studies are consistent with the idea that the enzyme first binds the open acyclic tautomer of the substrate glucose 6-phosphate, followed by oxidation to the C5-keto intermediate (intermediateB in Fig. 1 b) (32Tian F. Migaud M.E. Frost J.W. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1999; 121: 5795-5796Crossref Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Frost and co-workers (32Tian F. Migaud M.E. Frost J.W. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1999; 121: 5795-5796Crossref Scopus (24) Google Scholar) proposed that enolization is promoted by proton extraction via the substrate phosphate, consistent with the phosphate binding in a transoid conformation. Intramolecular aldol cyclization followed by rereduction of the C5-ketone completes the formation of the product. None of the intermediates have been isolated or trapped, suggesting that all intermediates are tightly bound and not released until the final reduction to myo-inositol 1-phosphate (33Loewus M.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1977; 252: 7221-7223Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 34Barnett J.E. Corina D.L. Biochem. J. 1968; 108: 125-129Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 35Sherman W.R. Stewart M.A. Zinbo M. J. Biol. Chem. 1969; 244: 5703-5708Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The enzyme thus catalyzes three distinct steps, an oxidation, intramolecular aldol cyclization, and finally reduction in the same active site with no apparent dissociation of intermediates. Major questions still remain regarding the mechanism of this enzyme, especially regarding the nature of the aldol cyclization. Typically, enzymes that utilize an aldol cyclization reaction can be categorized as either a type I or type II aldolase. In terms of yeast MIP synthase, it is neither a type I aldolase, which involves a covalent Schiff base intermediate, nor a type II aldolase, which involves a divalent cation such as zinc or manganese acting as Lewis acid (11Mauck L.A. Wong Y.H. Sherman W.R. Biochemistry. 1980; 19: 3623-3629Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 36Loewus M.W. Loewus F. Plant Sci.

Acta. 1981; 660: 299-305Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Instead, the enzyme is activated 5-fold by ammonium ions (18Chen L.J. Zhou C. Yang H.Y. Roberts M.F. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 12415-12423Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). On the other hand, MIP synthase from Archaebacteria fulgidus requires divalent cations and therefore is thought to be a type II aldolase. This is quite surprising, considering the high sequence homology between the enzymes (53% similarity) (18Chen L.J. Zhou C. Yang H.Y. Roberts M.F. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 12415-12423Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). It is far more common to find enzymes with completely divergent sequences and even completely different three-dimensional structures using identical mechanisms than the converse. To better understand the molecular details of this complex and critical biological transformation, we have determined the structures of yeast MIP synthase bound to NAD to 2.4 Å and bound to NADH and the tight binding inhibitor (K I = 6 × 10−6m) (32Tian F. Migaud M.E. Frost J.W. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1999; 121: 5795-5796Crossref Scopus (24) Google Scholar) 2-deoxyglucitol 6-phosphate (dgtolP) to 2.2 Å. These represent the first structures of any MIP synthase. The structural details of the MIP synthase active site may also lead to the development of better inhibitors of the enzyme having valproate-like psychotherapeutic benefits. The yeast MIP synthase enzyme was isolated, purified, and crystallized as previously described by Stein and Geiger (40Stein A.J. Geiger J.H. Acta Crystallogr. Sec. D. 2000; 56: 348-350Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). The structure was solved by multiwavelength anomalous dispersion phasing at the selenium edge. A three-wavelength multiwavelength anomalous dispersion data set was collected on beamline 19-ID of the Structural Biology Center (Advanced Photon Source, Argonne, IL), and the data were processed using HKL2000 (TableI) (41Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol..276. Academic Press, Inc., New York1996Google Scholar). 18 of the 22 possible selenium positions were located using automated Patterson search routines implemented in SOLVE (42Terwilliger T.C. Berendzen J. Acta Crystallogr. Sec. D. 1999; 55: 849-861Crossref PubMed Scopus (3219) Google Scholar). Heavy atom refinement and calculation of the resulting interpretable electron density map was also performed using SOLVE. After solvent flattening using the CCP4 package, the map was traced using O and TURBO-FRODO and refined using CNS (43Jones T.A. Zou J.Y. W. C.S. Kjelgard M. Acta Crystalogr. Sec.

After multiple rounds of refinement, the final model at 2.4 Å has an R and R-free value of 20.5 and 24.3% respectively. The final model contains residues 10–351 and 410–533 for both molecules in the asymmetric unit and 543 water molecules. All but six (1.1%) residues lie within the most favored or allowed regions of the Ramachandran plot. The parameters evaluated by PROCHECK (46Laskowski R.A. Macarthur M.W. Moss D.S. Thornton J.M. J.

The inhibitor-bound complex was crystallized like the native except that both 10 mm dgtolP and 20 mm NAD were added to the protein solution at least 12 h before crystallization trials were initiated. High resolution data were collected and processed as described above to a nominal resolution of 2.2 Å (TableII). After an initial round of refinement using CNS, clear electron density was evident for the inhibitor, NADH, and most of the previously disordered region (residues 352–409) in a 1.2ς contoured map calculated at 2.5-Å resolution. Subsequent rounds of rebuilding, refinement, and resolution extension resulted in the final structure. The reduction of NAD to NADH and oxidation of C5 to the ketone was discernible in the electron density map. The final model contains residues 9–533, 618 water molecules, NADH, dgtolP, and one ammonium ion (per monomer). It has an R and R-free value of 20.8 and 27.6%, respectively. 97.8% of the entire structure lie within the most favored or allowed regions of the Ramachandran plot.

Johnson M.D. Henry S.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1348: 245-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar, 47Migaud M.E. Frost J.W. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1996; 118: 495-501Crossref Scopus (17) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 2, the tetramer has 222 symmetry with a noncrystallographic 2-fold axis relating the two molecules in the asymmetric unit and a crystallographic 2-fold axis relating the two molecules at thetop of Fig. 2 (the red and bluemonomers) with those at the bottom (the two green monomers). The interface between the noncrystallographic dimer (the dimerization interface) is both large and intricate, burying 11,700 Å2of surface area between the two. Interactions are made throughout the molecule, from the top of the structure to the bottom. Although not as involved as the dimerization interface, the interface between the dimers is also significant, burying about 6,000 Å2 of surface area. All the interactions in this interface emanate from the juxtaposition of two large β-sheets, one from each dimer. The surface is composed mostly of hydrophobic residues, making it unlikely that there is any dissociation of the tetramer. The MIP synthase monomer can be divided into three major domains, each with its own distinct function (Fig. 3 a). A central domain consisting of the N and C termini makes the majority of contacts between monomers across the noncrystallographic 2-fold and stabilizes the relative orientation of the other two domains. A domain reminiscent of an NAD-binding or Rossmann fold domain (encompassing residues 66–326) contains a parallel five-stranded β-sheet, four surrounding helices, and two additional extensions, one that completely surrounds the adenine of NAD preventing ready dissociation of the nucleotide (residues 149–215) and one insertion between the first and second strands of the Rossmann fold (residues 93–140) that folds into the central domain of the enzyme. The third domain (encompassing residues 327–441) contains the β-sheet involved in the tetramerization interface and the catalytic domain. Numerous interactions between these three domains create a rigid overall structure with little possibility for relative motion between these domains. Inspection of Fig. 1 a indicates that although all eucaryotic MIP synthases are highly conserved throughout their length and will almost certainly have very similar structure throughout, a significant portion of the N terminus is missing in the A. fulgidus enzyme. This will lead to differences in the structure of the central domain of this enzyme relative to that seen here. The fold of MIP synthase bears some resemblance to that of diaminopimilate dehydrogenase, especially the structure and relative position of the catalytic domain and the Rossmann fold domain (48Scapin G. Cirilli M. Reddy S.G. Gao Y. Vederas J.C. Blanchard J.S. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 3278-3285Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 49Scapin G. Reddy S.G. Blanchard J.S. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 13540-13551Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Diaminopimilate dehydrogenase is a dimer in solution and shares a similar dimerization interface with MIP synthase as well. Interaction of MIP synthase with NAD is similar to that seen in other Rossmann fold NAD-binding enzymes. NAD runs across the bottom of the parallel β-sheet of the nucleotide-binding domain. Instead of the more common GXGXXG motif, MIP synthase has a GXGGXXG motif (GLGGNNG, encompassing residues 72–78) in the loop connecting the β3 strand and α1 helix. This loop makes interactions with the phosphodiester backbone as seen in other structures. The amide of the nicotinamide is rotated to the phosphodiester side and makes a tight hydrogen bond with the phosphodiester backbone, serving to stabilize this orientation. Numerous interactions between NAD and the enzyme are observed throughout the nucleotide-binding and catalytic domains of MIP synthase. In turn, most of these residues are highly conserved among the eucaryotic enzymes. The nucleotide binding domains of the archaebacterial enzymes are less highly conserved, and many of the interacting residues are different in these enzymes. The significance of these differences must await the structure determination of these enzymes. The 2.4-Å structure of MIP synthase as purified fromE. coli (40Stein A.J. Geiger J.H. Acta Crystallogr. Sec. D. 2000; 56: 348-350Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar) revealed partial NAD occupancy in the NAD-binding domain and allowed us to define the catalytic region of the enzyme based on the position of the nicotinamide. Surprisingly, the nicotinamide was completely exposed on the surface of the structure with no discernible active site cleft or cavity surrounding it (Fig.3 b). Additionally, we were unable to locate electron density for 58 residues, from 352 to 409. These residues represent the most conserved region of the enzyme, sharing 73% identity fromArchaebacteria to humans. The beginning and end of this region are located near the putative catalytic region defined by the position of the nicotinamide. In an effort to shed light on this unusual combination of observations, we grew crystals of MIP synthase in the presence of 10 mm dgtolP (Fig. 1 b). We were able to obtain crystals using conditions identical to those previously used, with identical unit cell dimensions and space group, although the diffraction was improved by almost 0.2 Å to 2.2-Å resolution. Electron density for the inhibitor was found in the vicinity of the putative active site, and additional unambiguous electron density was found for every residue in the disordered region from 352 to 409. These residues create an entire subdomain that folds around the inhibitor, completely encapsulating it (Fig.4 a). Once this subdomain is ordered, there is no access to the interior of the active site, even for a solvent molecule (Fig. 4 b). Thus, a rather large cavity is created within the structure of the enzyme. We conclude that the formation of the MIP active site represents an extreme example of induced fit, where the substrate nucleates the folding of its own active site and its complete encapsulation within the enzyme. Whereas it would appear from the two structures we have on hand that this subdomain is ordered exclusively by inhibitor binding, we cannot rule out the possibility that at least some of the region may be stabilized by full occupancy of NAD. Stabilization by NAD may be of particular importance for α13, because it makes the lion's share of NAD contacts in the newly ordered domain (Fig.1 a). Although there is little change in the structure of the rest of MIP synthase upon inhibitor binding, the loop that includes residues 191–198 is an exception, since the folding of the new catalytic domain forces this loop to flip out and create space for the newly ordered region (Fig. 4 c). Several new contacts are made between this loop and the newly ordered subdomain as shown in Fig.4 c. The inhibitor, dgtolP, is bound to the enzyme in an extended conformation, with the phosphate group in a transoid conformation relative to the inhibitor carbon backbone (Fig. 5,a and b). This conformation is consistent with several inhibitor studies conducted by Frost and co-workers (32Tian F. Migaud M.E. Frost J.W. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1999; 121: 5795-5796Crossref Scopus (24) Google Scholar). First, although there are many examples of exclusively acyclic substrate mimics that make good inhibitors of the enzyme, no exclusively cyclic mimics of the substrate bind the enzyme with any affinity (32Tian F. Migaud M.E. Frost J.W. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1999; 121: 5795-5796Crossref Scopus (24) Google Scholar). The conclusion from these studies was that MIP synthase binds exclusively the acyclic form of the substrate, glucose 6-phosphate. This was unexpected, because the equilibrium favors the cyclic tautomer by at least 100:1. Second, while 2-deoxy-d-glucitol 6-(E)-vinylhomophosphonate, an (E)-vinyl-phosphonate substrate mimic, strongly inhibits yeast MIP synthase, the (Z)-enantiomer has no affinity for the enzyme (32Tian F. Migaud M.E. Frost J.W. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1999; 121: 5795-5796Crossref Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Given these data, it is not surprising to find dgtolP bound in an acyclic, extended conformation with the phosphate in a transoid conformation. Consistent with the biochemical data, we find dgtolP to be oxidized to the C5-ketone derivative and the NAD to be reduced to NADH (32Tian F. Migaud M.E. Frost J.W. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1999; 121: 5795-5796Crossref Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Evidently, we have a mimic of the first intermediate in the reaction pathway, after the first oxidation, but before enolization and intramolecular aldol cyclization. The dgtolP is well nestled in the cavity, with each of the hydroxyl groups hydrogen-bonded to a highly conserved residue of MIP synthase. In fact, all but one of these residues is completely conserved in all MIP synthases. The exception is Gln325, which is conserved in all eucaryotic MIP synthases but is changed to Glu230 in the A. fulgidus enzyme. This residue interacts with O1 of the inhibitor, which would be an aldehyde oxygen in the substrate. It is possible that the substrate is bound in a less extended conformation, at least in the Archaebacterialenzyme, since the aldehyde would not hydrogen bond to the glutamate unless the glutamate was protonated. A large hydrophobic surface consisting of residues Leu352, Leu360, Ile400, and Ile402 aligns one side of the binding cavity. These hydrophobic residues are completely conserved throughout evolution. Since valproate (2-propylpentanoic acid) is quite hydrophobic, it is likely that this surface plays an important role in its binding to the enzyme. Further mutational and biochemical assays are necessary to confirm this proposal. A relatively large 4ς peak of electron density was located proximal to the phosphate group of the inhibitor and the residues Asp438 and Asn354 (Fig. 5, a andb). This peak is not seen in the unbound structure, since Asn354 is disordered. Based on its proximity both to Asp438 and the phosphate, we postulate that this density is due to a monovalent cation, probably an ammonium ion. We believe this to be ammonium, because ammonium ions increase the rate of the enzyme 5-fold and because ammonium ions are present in the crystallization solution (40Stein A.J. Geiger J.H. Acta Crystallogr. Sec. D. 2000; 56: 348-350Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). This putative ammonium ion is roughly tetrahedrally coordinated to Asp438, Asn354, a phosphate oxygen, and O6 of the inhibitor. It is interesting to note that while Asp438 is absolutely conserved in all MIP synthases fromArchaebacteria to human, Asn354, while absolutely conserved in eucaryotic MIP synthases, is occupied by Asp259 in A. fulgidus. We postulate that the addition of a second charged ligand changes the cation specificity from monovalent to divalent and may explain why A. fulgidus MIP synthase requires a divalent cation such as Zn2+ or Mn2+ for activity. There are two other enzymes that have both NAD and a metal ion in their active site: dehydroquinate synthase and alcohol dehydrogenase. When the nicotinamide rings of these two enzymes are overlaid, the metal ion positions are almost identical. Further, when the nicotinamide rings of dehydroquinate synthase and MIP synthase are overlaid, the position of the ammonium ion is within 1.5 Å of the dehydroquinate synthase and alcohol dehydrogenase zinc atoms. This is despite the fact that none of these enzymes have any structural or sequence similarity throughout their length. Given this positional similarity, we expect that the ammonium ion we see in MIP synthase has a role that is analogous to that seen in the other two enzymes, which is to act as a Lewis acid stabilizing negative charge on an oxygen atom. DgtolP binding by MIP synthase involves both residues that were ordered in both structures and additional residues that become ordered upon inhibitor binding (Figs. 1 a and 5 a). Whereas Gln325, Lys412, Asp438, and Lys489 were ordered in the unbound enzyme, Lys369 and Asn354 lie within the refolded subdomain (Fig. 5 a). Five hydrogen bonds are made between inhibitor and enzyme: Gln325 to O1 of dgtolP, Lys489 to O3, Lys412 to O4 and O5, and Lys369 to a phosphate oxygen of dgtolP. The rest of the interactions are hydrophobic in nature and define a hydrophobic core of the subdomain consisting of both enzyme and inhibitor. The conformation of dgtolP in the dgtolP·MIP synthase structure is clearly not representative of the conformation of the substrate during the aldol cyclization. We have performed a simple rearrangement of dgtolP in an attempt to mimic the conformation necessary for cyclization. To perform this modeling, we have assumed that the phosphate and C6 remain fixed and repositioned the inhibitor in a conformation consistent with the stereochemistry of the reaction. We have additionally arranged the 5-keto group to be oriented with the nicotinamide of NAD in a position consistent with the final reduction step. We have also assumed that the structure of the enzyme is unchanged. The result of this modeling is striking (Fig.5 c). Absolutely conserved residues now surround the modeled inhibitor and make hydrogen bonds with all of the OH groups. In addition, the 5-keto group is well positioned to interact with the ammonium ion, and Lys369 is in close contact with O1 of the inhibitor. Other new interactions with the inhibitor include bonds Ser323 to O3 and O4 of the inhibitor and Asp438to O5. The interaction between Lys489 to O3 remains the same. Based on this modeling, we have proposed a mechanism for the transformation catalyzed by MIP synthase (Fig.6). The first step involves oxidation at C5 with the substrate molecule in an extended conformation similar to that seen in our structure. Subsequently, the substrate is reoriented to the conformation shown in Fig. 6 where the phosphate-mediated enolization occurs. The developing negative charge on O5 is stabilized by the ammonium cation to catalyze this process. Nucleophilic attack by C6 on C1 is promoted by Lys369 stabilization of the developing negative charge on O1. Subsequent protonation at O1, possibly mediated by Lys369, and reduction of C5 by NAD, yields the myo-1-l-inositol phosphate product. MIP synthase is therefore an example of a type III aldolase, where a monovalent cation acts as the Lewis acid in the aldol condensation. In the case of the A. fulgidus enzyme, we envision a similar mechanism, except that the ammonium ion is replaced with a zinc or manganese divalent cation, making this more characteristic of a type II aldolase. All of the other residues interacting with the substrate and proposed to be involved in the mechanism are absolutely conserved in fulgidus as well as virtually all other MIP synthases whose sequences are known. Given the presence of the divalent cation at this position, we would expect the residues corresponding to 350–354 in A. fulgidus (255–259) to be ordered even in the absence of inhibitor or substrate. This would, however, still leave significant access to the active site. Verification of this proposal must await both mutational enzymology and further enzyme-inhibitor structural results. The concept of induced fit where “the substrate causes an appreciable change in the three-dimensional relationship of the amino acids in the active site” (50Koshland Jr., D.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1958; 44: 98-105Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) was proposed more than 40 years ago by Koshland (50Koshland Jr., D.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1958; 44: 98-105Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 51Koshland D.E. Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. Eng. 1995; 33: 2375-2378Crossref Scopus (491) Google Scholar). An exhaustive search of domain movements in proteins categorizes all of these movements as either hinge movements or shear movements (52Gerstein M. Lesk A.M. Chothia C. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 6739-6749Crossref PubMed Scopus (704) Google Scholar). The structures of NAD-bound and inhibitor/NAD-bound MIP synthase have revealed an extraordinary example of induced fit that complies with neither of these mechanisms. Instead, a folding event occurs where almost 60 residues become ordered upon binding to the inhibitor. Once folded, the enzyme fully encapsulates its substrate, leaving no access to the active site without unfolding some or all of this subdomain. Although there are examples of ligand-induced structural organization, such as the formation of two helices upon DNA binding in the leucine zipper proteins (53Benevides J.M. Li T.S. Lu X.J. Srinivasan A.R. Olson W.K. Weiss M.A. Thomas G.J. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 548-556Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 54Pabo C.O. Sauer R.T. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1992; 61: 1053-1095Crossref PubMed Scopus (1222) Google Scholar), it is highly unusual to see a refolding event of the magnitude seen here in an enzyme with a small molecule substrate. This binding mechanism seems counterintuitive but allows the enzyme to completely encapsulate its substrate in three dimensions. Encapsulation appears to be necessary for catalysis of this complex transformation. It also invites the possibility that small molecules can be used as protein folding scaffolds, both naturally and in protein engineering applications. We gratefully acknowledge J. W. Frost and C. Hansen for helpful discussions and C. Hansen for verification of the MIP synthase sequence. We also acknowledge R. Zhang for assistance in data collection at the SBC 19-ID beamline at Argonne National Laboratory."

Both Sp1 and Sp3 are abundant and ubiquitous, whereas Sp4 is mainly expressed in neuronal tissues and Sp5 exhibits a dynamic and highly restricted expression pattern during embryogenesis. This protein family shares three highly conserved zinc finger DNA binding motifs that recognize GC or GT/CACC boxes present in many promoters. Sp1 was first viewed as a constitutive transcriptional activator regulating basal expression of many cellular and viral genes. However, it is now established that Sp1 activity is modulated in response to numerous signals and that this factor plays a critical role in cell growth and differentiation. Sp1 mediates the induction of dihydrofolate reductase (6Black A.R. Jensen D. Lin S.Y. Azizkhan J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 1207-1215Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar) and thymidine kinase (7Rotheneder H. Geymayer S. Haidweger E. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 293: 1005-1015Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar) genes associated with DNA synthesis and is therefore intricately linked to growth/cell cycle progression. In line with this, the ectopic expression of truncated Sp1 prolongs the S phase and reduces the growth rate (8Chen F. Zhang F. Rao J. Studzinski G.P. Anticancer Res. 2000; 20: 661-667PubMed Google Scholar). Conversely, Sp1 mediates cell division arrest by up-regulating the expression of genes coding for negative regulators of the cell cycle such as p2lWaf1/Cip1, in p53-dependent growth control (9Torgeman A. Mor-Vaknin N. Zelin E. Ben-Aroya Z. Lochelt M. Flugel R.M. Aboud M. Virology. 2001; 281: 10-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar) or p53-independent pathway of terminal differentiation (10Biggs J.R. Kudlow J.E. Kraft A.S. J. Biol.

Sp1's manifold roles can be reconciled if one integrates the multiple time-ordered regulations to which this factor is itself submitted. First, Sp1 is a direct target of numerous cell cycle regulators, which activate or repress its activity. For instance, cyclin A (13Borja P.F. Collins N.K. Du P. Azizkhan-Clifford J. Mudryj M. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 5737-5747Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar, 14Haidweger E. Novy M. Rotheneder H. J. Mol.

It is of interest that cyclin D1 and retinoblastoma protein modulate Sp1 cross-talk with the basal transcriptional machinery through their direct association with the TATA-box-associated protein TAFII250 (15Adnane J.

Second, Sp1 exerts its transcriptional activation with the help of a growing list of inducible specific transcription factors such as nuclear factor-κB (23Krehan A. Ansuini H. Bocher O. Grein S.

Tjian R. Nature. 1999; 397: 446-450Crossref PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar). Third, Sp1 undergoes two types of inducible post-translational modifications that influence its activity. Sp1 contains a number of potentialO-linked glycosylation sites (32Jackson S.P. Tjian R. Cell. 1988; 55: 125-133Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (649) Google Scholar) and changes in glycosylation influence the stability of the factor (33Han I. Kudlow J.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 2550-2558Crossref PubMed Scopus (377) Google Scholar) as well as its interactions with other proteins (34Roos M.D. Su K. Baker J.R. Kudlow J.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 6472-6480Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). Sp1 also has multiple serine and threonine phosphorylation sites, the steady-state phosphorylation of which relies on several kinases and phosphatases. Many examples of growth/cell cycle-related increases in phosphorylated Sp1 activity have been reported. Thus, serum stimulation of human fibroblasts up-regulates Sp1 in mid-G1 by inducing its association to a kinase activity (6Black A.R. Jensen D. Lin S.Y. Azizkhan J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 1207-1215Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). Moreover, cyclin A-cyclin-dependent kinase complex enhances Sp1 activity (14Haidweger E. Novy M. Rotheneder H. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 306: 201-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). In addition, cell infection by SV40 or human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1)1 enhances Sp1 activity by means of a DNA-dependent protein kinase (DNA-PK) (35Chun R.F. Semmes O.J. Neuveut C. Jeang K.T. J. Virol. 1998; 72: 2615-2629Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 36Jackson S.P. MacDonald J.J. Lees-Miller S. Tjian R. Cell. 1990; 63: 155-165Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (517) Google Scholar). Conversely, decreased activity of phosphorylated Sp1 can also occur, as in the case of the casein kinase II (CKII)-mediated inhibition observed upon terminal differentiation of the liver (37Armstrong S.A. Barry D.A. Leggett R.W. Mueller C.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 13489-13495Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar, 38Zhang S. Kim K.H. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1997; 338: 227-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). It is noteworthy that the serine/threonine phosphatase I (PP1) counteracts Sp1 phosphorylation in a positive manner (39Daniel S. Zhang S. DePaoli-Roach A.A. Kim K.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 14692-14697Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar), but the phosphatase inhibitor okadaic acid has a negative effect (39Daniel S. Zhang S.

FEBS Lett. 1997; 417: 325-328Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Despite accumulating data on modulations of Sp1 expression and function in growing or differentiating cells, no study has yet described what occurs in normal fully dividing cells. In this report, we intended to fill this gap by following Sp1 behavior in human primary T lymphocytes triggered via CD2 plus CD28 costimulation to sustained division and reversal to quiescent survival (41Kahn-Perles B. Lipcey C. Lecine P. Olive D. Imbert J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 21774-21783Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Our results strongly suggest that Sp1 is dephosphorylated and up-regulated by phosphatase 2A (PP2A) concurrently to active cell division. Furthermore, we show that Sp1 remains dephosphorylated throughout cell cycle except for mitosis. T cell purification from peripheral blood and activation were performed as previously described (42Costello R. Lipcey C. Algarte M. Cerdan C. Baeuerle P.A. Olive D. Imbert J. Cell Growth Differ. 1993; 4: 329-339PubMed Google Scholar). Primary T cells were maintained in RPMI, 10% fetal calf serum (FCS). Stimulations were performed with a combination of the following mAbs used at saturating concentrations. Anti-CD2 mAb 39Cl.5 (rat IgG2a) and 6F10.3 (mouse IgG1) were used as purified mAbs at 10 μg/ml each. Anti-CD28 248 (mouse IgM), and anti-CD3 289 (mouse IgG2a) were obtained from Dr. A. Moretta (Cancer Institute, Genova, Italy) and were used either as ascitic fluid (1/400 dilution) or as purified mAb (10 μg/ml). T cell activation was controlled by proliferation assays and CD25/IL-2Rα expression. Re-stimulation of primary T cells was performed, between day 12 and 15 after initial CD2+CD28 triggering, with recombinant IL-2 (360 IU/ml, Chiron). In vivo treatment of cells with phosphatase inhibitors or cell synchronizing agents was performed overnight on dividing populations, as indicated in figure legends. The IL-2-dependent human T cell line Kit225 (43Hori T. Uchiyama T. Tsudo M. Umadome H. Ohno H. Fukuhara S. Kita K. Uchino H. Blood. 1987; 70: 1069-1072Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) was maintained in RPMI 1650, 10% FCS, 2 mml-glutamine (complete RPMI) plus 360 IU/ml recombinant IL-2. The cells were arrested in a quiescent state by washing them four times in medium alone and culturing them in complete RPMI without IL-2 for 24 h (for transient transfection assays) or for 2 days (for biochemical analysis). NIH/3T3 cells were grown in DMEM, 10% FCS, 2 mml-glutamine (complete DMEM) and arrested in a quiescent state by washing them 4 times in medium alone and culturing them in DMEM, 0.5% FCS for 48 h. Cell cycling was assessed following propidium iodide staining of the cells as follows. Briefly, cells were fixed with ice-cold 70% ethanol, treated (30 min, 37 °C) with RNase A (250 μg/ml) and propidium iodide (15 μm), and analyzed for G1, S, and G2/M phases with a Becton Dickinson FACSCan and CellQuest software. Sorting according to cycle progression was performed following in vivo labeling (l h, 37 °C) of viable cells with Hoechst 33342 (10 μm) and propidium iodide (15 μm) with a Becton Dickinson Vantage cell sorter. Cytosolic and nuclear extracts were prepared as previously described (42Costello R. Lipcey C. Algarte M. Cerdan C. Baeuerle P.A. Olive D. Imbert J. Cell Growth Differ. 1993; 4: 329-339PubMed Google Scholar), except for additional protease and phosphatase inhibitors. Briefly, pelleted nuclei were resuspended in 50 μl (per 107 cells) of buffer C (50 mm Hepes, pH 7.8, 50 mm KCl, 300 mm NaCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 10% (v/v) glycerol) supplemented with inhibitor mix M (10 mm sodium fluoride, 1 mm sodium molybdic acid, 1 μmpepstatin, 74 μm antipain, 50 μm calpain inhibitor 1, 100 μml-1-tosylamido-2-phenylethyl chloromethyl ketone, 25 μm E64D, 10 μm leupeptin, and 4 mm Pefabloc® SC). Protein concentration was measured with a commercial kit (Bio-Rad) by the method of Bradford (44Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (216440) Google Scholar). Nuclear extracts were used, as such, for Western blots and EMSA analyses or diluted 1/5 with buffer C′ (50 mm Hepes, pH 7.8, 0.1 mm EDTA, and 0.6% Nonidet P-40) supplemented with inhibitor mix M plus 1.2 mm sodium orthovanadate, pH 7.0, and 12 mm sodium pyrophosphate, for immunoprecipitations. Nuclear extracts, first pre-cleared with protein A-Sepharose (50 μl of sedimented beads) and normal rabbit serum (1/500 dilution) for 30 min at 4 °C, were treated with immunoprecipitating antibodies (2 h, 4 °C) and next by protein A-Sepharose (50 μl, 30 min, 4 °C). Immunoprecipitates were washed four times in buffer C"" (50 mm Hepes, pH 7.8, 150 mm NaCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, 0.5% Nonidet P-40) supplemented with inhibitor mix M plus 1 mm sodium orthovanadate and 10 mmpyrophosphate. Proteins bound to washed protein A-Sepharose beads were eluted and reduced by warming the samples at 95 °C for 3 min in sample buffer and then fractionated by SDS-PAGE. Pre-stained protein markers (Biolabs) were run in parallel. Proteins extracted from whole cells by direct boiling of dry cell pellets in sample buffer were similarly fractionated. Immunoblotting was performed as previously described (41Kahn-Perles B. Lipcey C. Lecine P. Olive D. Imbert J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 21774-21783Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). For quantification, films were analyzed by densitometry using a Bio Image whole band analyzer (Millipore Co.). Whole cell extracts (40 mm Tris, pH 6.8, 1% SDS, 2.5% β-mercaptoethanol) were diluted 10-fold in 50 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, buffer, supplemented with 150 mm NaCl, 10 mm NaF, 4 mm Pefabloc® SC, 10 μmleupeptin, and, when indicated, 50 mm N-acetyl-d-glucosamine, in a total volume of 500 μl. Wheat germ agglutinin (WGA) agarose beads (Amersham Biosciences, Inc.) were then added (50 μl sedimented), and the mixture was shaken for 45 min at 4 °C. After four washes in the previous buffer, sedimented beads were boiled and bound proteins were fractionated by SDS-PAGE as described above. Anti-Sp1 (sc-59X), Sp3 (sc-644X), and Sp4 (sc-645X) polyclonal antibodies were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA) or kindly provided by Dr. Suske (Institut für Molekularbiologie und Tumorforschung, Marburg, Germany) for anti-Sp1 and anti-Sp3 or from our own facilities for anti-Sp4. Anti-cyclin A monoclonal antibody was from Sigma. Anti-p85 phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase catalytic subunit was from Upstate Biotechnology, Inc. Anti-PP2A catalytic α subunit was from Transduction Laboratories. Anti-Stat5b and anti-phospho-StatA/B polyclonal antibodies were from R&D Systems and Upstate Biotechnology, Inc., respectively. Anti-CKII α and β subunit polysera were generous gifts from Dr. Litchfield (Manitoba Institute, Winnipeg, Canada). Oligonucleotides were end-labeled, annealed and purified as previously described (41Kahn-Perles B. Lipcey C. Lecine P. Olive D. Imbert J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 21774-21783Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Reactions with indicated amounts of nuclear proteins were performed in a 20-μl final volume of binding buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 60 mm KCl, 2 mm EDTA, 5 mmdithiothreitol, 4% Ficoll, and 50 μg/ml poly(dI·dC)) containing 50,000 cpm probe, for 30 min at 4 °C. Unlabeled double-stranded competitor or specific antiserum was pre-incubated with cell extracts for 20 min at 4 °C prior to addition of the probe. Binding reaction mixtures were separated on a 5% nondenaturing polyacrylamide gel, and, following electrophoresis, dried gels were exposed as described previously (41Kahn-Perles B. Lipcey C.

Ghysdael J. Gouilleux F. Kahn-Perles B. Imbert J. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 2086-2097Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar) with CAT reporter genes and expression vectors, as indicated in figure legends. Following transfection, cells were maintained in culture for 20 h either in presence (360 IU/ml) or in absence of recombinant IL-2. Cell lysis and CAT assays were performed with the CAT enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kit (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) according to the manufacturer's instructions with 50 μg of cell extracts. Stimulation of human primary T lymphocytes with CD2+CD28 mAbs induces sustained cell proliferation, IL-2 secretion, and high IL-2 receptor α chain (IL-2Rα) expression (42Costello R. Lipcey C. Algarte M. Cerdan C. Baeuerle P.A. Olive D. Imbert J. Cell Growth Differ. 1993; 4: 329-339PubMed Google Scholar, 49Cerdan C. Martin Y. Courcoul M. Brailly H. Mawas C. Birg F. Olive D. J.

Moreover, actively dividing cells ultimately reverse to quiescence about 2 weeks after initial triggering and then survive for several days. In this respect, costimulation of T lymphocyte via CD2+CD28 provides a valuable model to uncover the evolution of Sp1 expression and activity from a quiescent state to cell growth, active proliferation, and proliferation arrest. We first analyzed the time-course modulation of Sp1 expression in parallel to that of the cell cycle marker cyclin A. This analysis was done several times on T lymphocyte populations from different healthy donors. Immunoblots performed with nuclear cell extracts with polyclonal anti-Sp1 and monoclonal anti-cyclin A antibodies (Fig.1 A for representative analysis) showed that Sp1 electrophoretic migration underwent a major change (compare lanes 1 and 5), concomitant with the up-regulation of cyclin A expression and thus with cell division. Thus, novel fast-migrating forms were detected that were also present in T lymphocytes triggered to division via CD3/T cell receptor or CD3/T cell receptor+CD28 (data not shown). This change was transient because Sp1 from T cells reverted to quiescence migrated similarly to Sp1 from freshly purified resting cells (lane 7). In addition, quantification of Sp1 signal from whole cell extracts, normalized to that of the loading charge control phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase p85, indicated that this protein was overexpressed to a mean of 5-fold from resting to actively dividing cells (data not shown). We reported in a previous study of the modulation of Rel/nuclear factor-κB proteins that the nuclear expression of c-Rel subunit is dramatically increased in dividing T lymphocytes (41Kahn-Perles B. Lipcey C. Lecine P. Olive D. Imbert J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 21774-21783Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). We therefore investigated whether the changes in expression of nuclear Sp1 and c-Rel were time-related. We found that c-Rel maximal expression preceded Sp1 modifications and cyclin A maximal expression (compare lanes 4 and5 in Fig. 1 A). Given that CD2+CD28-induced T lymphocyte proliferation is mostly sustained by T cell autocrine/paracrine secretion of IL-2 (51Costello R. Cerdan C. Pavon C. Brailly H. Hurpin C. Mawas C. Olive D. Eur. J. Immunol. 1993; 23: 608-613Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar), Sp1 modifications are likely to result from the activation of the IL-2/IL-2R pathway. We thus tested whether T lymphocytes that had reversed to quiescence on day 13 could re-divide following secondary IL-2 triggering and, if so, whether Sp1 expression resembled that of fully dividing CD2+CD28-triggered populations. As illustrated by cyclin A expression, IL-2-stimulated T lymphocytes could re-enter cell cycle and Sp1 protein recovered a migration pattern similar to that observed in the first division round (Fig. 1 B, left panel). Because Sp1 conversion to fast-migrating forms is only partial, we investigated whether it might be restricted either to CD4- or to CD8-positive T cell populations (52Whitmire J.K. Ahmed R. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 2000; 12: 448-455Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar) that both grow and divide following primary anti-CD2+CD28 or secondary IL-2 triggering (data not shown). IL-2-stimulated dividing CD4+ and CD8+ cells (38 and 57%, respectively, for the represented donor) were thus sorted to above 95% purity and whole cell extracts analyzed as previously. As shown in Fig.1 B (right panel), Sp1 had a similar expression in both populations. Given this homogeneous response, we used our IL-2-synchronized re-stimulation protocol to define when Sp1 modifications proceeded along the IL-2/IL-2R transduction pathway. The early activation steps were assessed by the appearance of Stat5 tyrosine-phosphorylated forms (53Leonard W.J. O'Shea J.J. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1998; 16: 293-322Crossref PubMed Scopus (1480) Google Scholar) detected with an anti-pStat A/B polyclonal antibody, and cell division by the expression of cyclin A. As illustrated in Fig. 1 C, Sp1 modifications were most delayed compared with pStat induction (30 min) and concomitant with cyclin A maximal up-regulation (72 h). Sp1 changes observed in dividing T lymphocytes might either be T-specific or else apply to any proliferating cells. NIH/3T3 fibroblasts can be arrested in a quiescent state or synchronously re-induced to enter cell cycle, according to FCS concentration in culture medium. We thus analyzed the time-course expression of Sp1 in re-stimulated NIH/3T3 cells. As shown in Fig.2 A, representative of one of several individual experiments, and quantified in Fig. 2 B, the proportion of Sp1 slower migrating forms started to decrease from 20 h after serum addition. At this time a great proportion of the cells had entered cell cycle, as assessed by the high cyclin A expression and by the increased proportion of cells in S or G2/M phases (lane 3). Notably, change in Sp1 migration persisted after 34 h when a majority of cells had reversed to G0/G1 phase (lane 4) after division, suggesting that it was independent of cell cycle progression. To further analyze Sp1 expression all through the cell cycle, we undertook to sort G0/G1, S and G2/M lymphocytes from anti-CD2+CD28-stimulated dividing populations or treat these populations with cell cycle blocking agents. As shown in Fig. 3 A, extracts from G0/G1 and G2/M (sorting 1,left upper panel) or G0/G1 and S (sorting 2, right upper panel) enriched populations displayed similar Sp1 migration profiles, despite the expected variations in cyclin A expression (lower panel). No change was found either (Fig. 3 B, upper and lower panels) following synchronization of cells in late G1with mimosine (54Krek W. DeCaprio J.A. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 254: 114-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Thus, as for NIH/3T3 fibroblasts, Sp1 modifications appear concurrent to overall cell cycle progression and not restricted to certain phases. However, because mitotic cells only represent a very small population of growing cultures, biochemical changes occurring in mitosis cannot be appreciated without prior enrichment. We therefore used the metaphase synchronizing agent nocodazole (54Krek W. DeCaprio J.A. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 254: 114-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar) to recover an enriched M phase population (Fig. 3 C, upper panel). Interestingly, extracts from nocodazole-treated populations showed a profound modification in Sp1 migration profile with diminished faster migrating forms and strongly increased slower migrating ones (Fig. 3 C, lower panel). Thus, Sp1 appears to undergo particular posttranslational changes during mitosis compared with G0/G1, S, and G2phases. Lower molecular weight Sp1 forms might arise from deglycosylation and/or dephosphorylation. We first followed Sp1 glycosylation by its capacity to bind to WGA lectin (32Jackson S.P. Tjian R. Cell. 1988; 55: 125-133Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (649) Google Scholar). Binding specificity was controlled in the presence of the competitive sugarN-acetyl-d-glucosamine. As shown in Fig.4, Sp1 slow and fast migrating forms, detected in resting and dividing cells respectively (lanes 1and 4), bound equally well to WGA beads (lanes 2and 5). Thus, no global deglycosylation was detected. Notice in comparison that Sp1-related factor Sp3 did not bind to WGA beads and therefore did not appear to be glycosylated. Inducible dephosphorylation of Sp1 was suggested by its reversion to a resting-like migration profile in extracts from dividing cells cultured in the presence of okadaic acid phosphatase inhibitor (Fig. 4,lanes 7 and 8). Because okadaic acid binds to the catalytic subunits of PP1 and PP2A family proteins (although wit"

Deleting the C-terminal domain down to the first 57 amino acids has no detectable growth defect. Thus, the critical part of Rpb9 is limited to a N-terminal half that contacts the lobe of the second largest subunit (Rpb2) and forms a β-addition motif with the “jaw” of the largest subunit (Rpb1).

In contrast, rpb9 mutants are lethal in cells lacking the histone acetyltransferase activity of the RNA polymerase II Elongator and SAGA factors. In a two-hybrid test, Rpb9 physically interacts with Tfa1, the largest subunit of TFIIE. The interacting fragment, comprising amino acids 62–164 of Tfa1, belongs to a conserved zinc motif.

The remarkably similar organization of these two enzymes leaves no doubt as to the strong mechanistic conservation of the transcription process. This similarity was anticipated from the sequence homology existing between the β′βα2ω bacterial core enzyme and 5 of the 10 core subunits of Pol II. Rpb1 and Rpb2 are homologues of β′ and β, the Rpb3/Rpb11 heterodimer corresponding to the bacterial α2 dimer, and ω is distantly related to Rpb6 (3Minakhin L. Bhagat S. Brunning A. Campbell E.A.

On the other hand, Pol II contains five small subunits (Rpb5, Rpb8, Rpb9, Rpb10, Rpb12) not found in the bacterial enzyme. These subunits also belong to the core structure of Pol I and Pol III or are related to it, in the case of Rpb9. Except for Rpb8, they are also akin to archaeal polypeptides (4Langer D. Hain J.

Rpb9 is highly conserved in evolution, and the yeast subunit can be replaced in vivo by its human counterpart (17McKune K. Moore P.A. Hull M.W. Woychik N.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 6895-6900Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). However, animal mutants (Drosophila melanogaster) are lethal (18Liu Z. Kontermann R.E. Shulze R.A. Petersen G. Bautz E.K.F. FEBS Lett. 1993; 335: 73-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (2) Google Scholar), whereas yeast null mutants have only a limited growth defect (19Woychik N.A. Lane W.S. Young R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 19053-19055Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Rpa12, Rpb9, and Rpc11 have a related organization in Pol I, Pol II, and Pol III, respectively. These three subunits are essentially made of two zinc-binding domains. Moreover, Rpa12 and Rpb9 hold equivalent positions in the spatial structure of Pol I and Pol II, at the edge of their DNA channels in the “upper” side, which is occupied mainly by the second largest subunit (2Cramer P.

We therefore decided to examine more closely the growth properties of the rpb9 mutant altered in its N-terminal and C-terminal zinc domains and to look for partners of that subunit with other components of the RNA polymerase II transcription complex. Our data revealed a functional connection of Rpb9 with the histone acetyltransferase activity of the Pol II Elongator and SAGA complex and a physical association between Rpb9 and TFIIE. The C-terminal zinc fold of Rpb9 is entirely dispensable in vivo, despite its high sequence conservation. These data will be discussed in the light of models currently proposed for the control of Pol II elongation (21Conaway J.W. Shilatifard A. Dvir A. Conaway R.C. Trends Biochem.

Open table in a new tab Rpb9 is made of three distinct domains in the spatial structure of Pol II (2Cramer P. Bushnell D.A. Konrberg R.D. Science. 2001; 292: 1863-1876Crossref PubMed Scopus (985) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig.1 A, each of these domains interacts with a different region of the two large subunits (Rpb1 and Rpb2). The N-terminal zinc fold (Zn1, positions 1–39) contacts the Rpb2 lobe. The β sheet linker (β4, positions 40–52) forms a strong β-addition motif with β28 on the Rpb1 jaw. The C-terminal zinc ribbon (Zn2, positions 53–122) interacts with the Rpb2 funnel (Fig.1 A). An invariant DPTLPR motif on the zinc ribbon has been reported to be critical for the binding of Rpb9 to Pol II in vitro (33Hemming S.A. Edwards A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 2288-2294Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). rpb9-Δ mutants have a partial growth defect (19Woychik N.A. Lane W.S. Young R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 19053-19055Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and are sensitive to nucleotide-depleting drugs (15Hemming S.A. Jansma D.B. Macgregor P.F. Goryachev A. Friesen J.D. Edwards A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 35506-35511Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Fig.2 shows that large C-terminal deletions (rpb9-1,57, rpb9-1,66, rpb9-1,70, and rpb9-1,74) are indistinguishable from wild type in term of growth and drug sensitivity. The fact that these deletions always retain the β4 sheet (e.g. rpb9-1,57) but that a more extensive deletion (rpb9-1,47) eliminating the latter region behaves like a null mutant (15Hemming S.A. Jansma D.B. Macgregor P.F. Goryachev A. Friesen J.D. Edwards A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 35506-35511Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar) underscores the importance of the Rpb9-β4/Rpb1-β28 addition motif. In contrast, the DPTLPR motif noted above is deleted in rpb9-1,57 and is thus fully dispensable in vivo. Deleting the N-terminal zinc domain (rpb9-32,122) leads to a null phenotype as already described (15Hemming S.A. Jansma D.B. Macgregor P.F. Goryachev A. Friesen J.D. Edwards A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 35506-35511Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). In the light of the Pol II structure, the main function of Rpb9 may therefore be to hold the Rpb2 lobe (through its interaction with the N-terminal zinc domain of Rpb9) and the Rpb1 jaw (through the β-addition motif mentioned above). As shown Fig. 1 B, the target domain recognized by Rpb9 on the Rpb2 fold is evolutionarily conserved in Pol II. Interestingly, this domain is immediately adjacent to a universally conserved motif shared by all bacterial, archaeal, and eukaryotic enzymes. The mild growth defect of rpb9-Δmutants suggests that other components of the Pol II elongation machinery may be functionally redundant with that subunit. Indeed, the lethality of rpc11 mutants lacking the corresponding Pol III subunit led to the speculation that the latter may combine functions carried separately by Rpb9 and the TFIIS elongation factor in Pol II (7Chédin S. Riva M. Schultz P. Sentenac A. Carles C. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 3857-3871Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). A minor synthetic phenotype was reported betweenppr2-Δ (lacking TFIIS) and rpb9-Δ (15Hemming S.A. Jansma D.B. Macgregor P.F. Goryachev A. Friesen J.D. Edwards A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 35506-35511Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). In our hands, however, rpb9 ppr2-Δ double mutants were indistinguishable from their rpb9-Δ parent (Fig.3 A). Moreover, norpb9 mutant was obtained in a systematic screen based on synthetic lethality with ppr2-Δ (23Davie J.K. Kane C.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 5960-5973Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). The fact thatrpb9-Δ and ppr2-Δ have no additive phenotype implies that the physiological effects of TFIIS on Pol II are mediated by the Rpb9 subunit itself. This is coherent with in vitrodata (9Awrey D.E. Weibacher R.G. Hemming S.A. Orlicky S.M. Kane C.M. Edwards A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 14747-14754Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar) showing that TFIIS promotes read-through and RNA cleavage by Pol II but that this effect is, to a large extent, absent in a mutant form of Pol II lacking the Rpb9 subunit. The Elongator is a transcription factor distinct from TFIIS but also affecting the elongation properties of yeast Pol II. This multisubunit protein is endowed with a histone acetyltransferase activity carried by the Elp3 catalytic subunit (34Wittschieben B.O. Otero G. de Bizemont T. Fellows J. Erdjument-Bromage H. Ohba R. Li Y. Allis C.D. Tempst P. Svejstrup J.Q. Mol. Cell. 1999; 4: 123-128Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (396) Google Scholar). elp3-Δ mutants have minor growth defects but are fully lethal when combined with rpb9-Δ (Fig.3 B). elp3-Δ is also lethal withgcn5-Δ deletions of the catalytic subunit of the SAGA complex (35Grant P.A. Duggan L. Cote J. Roberts S.M. Brownell J.E. Candau R. Ohba R. Owen-Hughes T. Allis C.D. Winston F. Berger S.L. Workman J.L. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 1640-1650Crossref PubMed Scopus (890) Google Scholar). rpb9-Δ itself is synthetic lethal withgcn5-Δ and fails to grow when combined with mutants lacking the Ada2, Ada3, or Spt3 subunits of SAGA (Fig. 3 B).elp3-Δ and rpb9-Δ are both epistatic withsas3-Δ (lacking the histone acetyltransferase component of the Nu3A factor (36John S. Howe L. Tafrov S.T. Grant P.A. Sternglanz R. Workman J.L. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 1196-1208PubMed Google Scholar) and hpa2-Δ mutants inactivated for the HpaII histone acetyltransferase (Ref. 37Wittschieben B.O. Fellows J. Du W. Stillman D.J. Svejstrup J.Q. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 3060-3068Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar and Fig.3 B)). In summary, our data show a strong synergy between Rpb9, Elp3, and Gcn5, indicating that they are redundant for the same biological function. Deleting the C-terminal domain of Rpb9 (rpb9-1,57) has no detectable effect on gcn5-Δ or elp3-Δ(data not shown). This C-terminal deletion is therefore phenotypically silent by all criteria (growth tests, drug sensitivity, and synthetic lethality) tested so far. The synergy observed here is not a general property of histone acetyltransferases. Intriguingly,gcn5-Δ (but not elp3-Δ) also strongly affects the growth rate of a rpa12-Δ mutant lacking the Pol I counterpart of Rpb9 (Fig. 3 C). This observation buttresses the parallelism already noted between these two subunits. These synthetic lethal effects are not a general consequence of Pol I or Pol II defects because other conditional mutants of Pol I (rpa49-Δ (38Liljelund P. Mariotte M. Buhler J.M. Sentenac A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 9302-9305Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar)) or Pol II (rpb1–1 (39Nonet M. Scafe C. Sexton J. Young R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 1602-1611Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar)) are not at all or are hardly affected in a gcn5-Δ context, as shown Fig. 3 D for rpb1–1. In addition, gcn5-Δ and elp3-Δ are also epistatic with the ppr2-Δ mutation inactivating TFIIS, in keeping with the viability of ppr2-Δ rpb9-Δ double mutants found in this study (data not shown). The data presented above indicate a functional connection between Rpb9 and two chromatin factors associated with RNA Polymerase II but by no means imply a direct physical interaction with these factors. On the other hand, the fact that Rpb9 is located at the outer surface of the spatial Pol II structure (2Cramer P. Bushnell D.A. Konrberg R.D. Science. 2001; 292: 1863-1876Crossref PubMed Scopus (985) Google Scholar) makes it a likely target of Pol II transcription factors. In an attempt to identify physical partners of Rpb9, we therefore used a GAL4BD::RPB9 fusion as bait in a two-hybrid screening based on a library of yeast genomic fragments (32Fromont-Racine M. Rain J.C. Legrain P. Nat. Genet. 1997; 16: 277-282Crossref PubMed Scopus (721) Google Scholar). Our previous work on other Pol I, Pol II, and Pol III subunits (16Van Mullem V. Landrieux E. Vandenhaute J. Thuriaux P. Mol. Microbiol. 2002; (in press)PubMed Google Scholar, 28Flores A. Briand J.F. Boschiero C. Gadal O. Andrau J.C. Rubbi L. Van Mullem V. Goussot M. Marck C. Carles C. Thuriaux P. Sentenac A. Werner M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 7815-7820Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar,29Briand J.F. Navarro F. Rematier P. Boschiero C. Labarre S. Werner M. Shpakovski G.V. Thuriaux P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 6056-6065Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar) has documented the relevance of this method as a way of mapping interaction domains in the transcription machinery. This two-hybrid approach yielded one interesting candidate that encoded an internal fragment of Tfa1, the largest subunit of the heterodimeric TFIIE transcription factor (Fig.4 A). This interaction is specific of Rpb9 because Tfa1 does not interact with Rpa12 and was never isolated when screening the same library with other RNA polymerase subunits (28Flores A. Briand J.F. Boschiero C. Gadal O. Andrau J.C. Rubbi L. Van Mullem V. Goussot M. Marck C. Carles C. Thuriaux P. Sentenac A. Werner M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 7815-7820Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar, 29Briand J.F. Navarro F. Rematier P. Boschiero C. Labarre S. Werner M. Shpakovski G.V. Thuriaux P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 6056-6065Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). The two-hybrid response initially obtained with the entire Rpb9 subunit was rather weak, but a strong signal was observed when using an N-terminal deletion removing the first 32 amino acids (GAL4BD::rpb9-33,122). The latter observation implies that the N-terminal zinc domain of Rpb9 is not required for this interaction. However, attempts to more precisely identify which part of Rpb9 is critical have not been conclusive, because neither the N-terminal zinc domain nor the C-terminal zinc ribbon alone were competent for this interaction. Tfa1 itself is evolutionarily conserved on its N-terminal half, whereas the C-terminal half is not, and it can be deleted with only a minor growth defect (27Kuldell N.H. Buratowski S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 5288-5298Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 40Sakurai H. Ohishi T. Fukasawa T. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 15936-15942Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). The fragment recognized by Rpb9 (positions 62–164) corresponds to the conserved part and includes a typical zinc-binding motif. Mutations that are expected to strongly distort that motif such as tfa1-C127W are viable with a conditional growth defect (27Kuldell N.H. Buratowski S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 5288-5298Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). They also do not alter the two-hybrid response of the GAL4BD::RPB9 fusion, indicating that the integrity of the zinc motif is probably not required for this interaction (Fig. 4 B). Intriguingly, tfa1-C127Wis strongly sensitive to mycophenolate. Moreover, it is synthetic lethal with rpb9-Δ (Fig. 4, C andD). This lethality is not a general consequence of Pol II-defective mutants, because rpb1-1 mutants (growing slowly and leading to a strong and rapid arrest at 37 °C (39Nonet M. Scafe C. Sexton J. Young R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 1602-1611Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar)) are not affected by tfa1-C127W (data not shown). Yeast TFIIE directly binds the Pol II core enzyme (41Bushnell D.A. Bamdad C. Kornberg R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 20170-20174Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar) and co-purifies with at least one form of Pol II holoenzyme (42Pan G. Aso T. Greenblatt J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 24563-24571Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). The two-hybrid interaction found here evidently suggests that TFIIE binding is mediated by Rpb9 via its Tfa1 subunit. To explore this point, we immunopurified Pol II (using a Rpb3::3HA tag) in wild-type and rpb9-Δ strains expressing an epitope-tagged form of Tfa1 (Tfa1::13MYC). Because rpb9-Δ has no effect on the subunit composition of the purified Pol II ((9), differences in the co-purification pattern of Tfa1 can confidently be ascribed to Rpb9 itself. Fig. 5 shows that Tfa1::13MYC co-purifies with the immunoprecipitated Pol II, that rpb9-Δ strongly impairs this co-purification, and that the mutant enzyme nevertheless retains some Tfa1 binding. Taken together, these data strongly suggest that TFIIE binds Pol II by at least two contact points, one of which involves a direct interaction between Rpb9 and the conserved N-terminal part of Tfa1. Rpb9 is formed of two zinc domains that are strongly conserved from yeast to man (17McKune K. Moore P.A. Hull M.W. Woychik N.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 6895-6900Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar) and define two separate folds in the spatial structure of Pol II (2Cramer P. Bushnell D.A. Konrberg R.D. Science. 2001; 292: 1863-1876Crossref PubMed Scopus (985) Google Scholar). In vitro, this subunit controls elongation at the level of the cleaving RNase activity (9Awrey D.E. Weibacher R.G. Hemming S.A. Orlicky S.M. Kane C.M. Edwards A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 14747-14754Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). This elongation defect is consistent with the strong sensitivity ofrpb9 null mutants to nucleotide-depleting drugs (15Hemming S.A. Jansma D.B. Macgregor P.F. Goryachev A. Friesen J.D. Edwards A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 35506-35511Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). However, the C-terminal zinc ribbon of Rpb9 can be entirely deleted, down to the first 57 amino acids of Rpb9, without any detectable growth defect and with no increased sensitivity to nucleotide-depleting drugs. Thus, only two elements of Rpb9 are critical for its biological activity, its N-terminal zinc fold (position 1–39), which interacts with the Rpb2 “lobe” in the Pol II spatial structure (2Cramer P. Bushnell D.A. Konrberg R.D. Science. 2001; 292: 1863-1876Crossref PubMed Scopus (985) Google Scholar), and a β4 “linker” sheet forming a β-addition motif with β28 on the Rpb1 “jaw.” This supports the existence of a mobile lobe-Rpb9-jaw module, as predicted from a comparison of the two structures adopted by Pol II crystals (2Cramer P. Bushnell D.A. Konrberg R.D. Science. 2001; 292: 1863-1876Crossref PubMed Scopus (985) Google Scholar). The fact that the contact between Rpb9 and the Rpb1 funnel can be disrupted with no detectable effect is surprising given the high conservation of the funnel and that it physically connects Rpb9 to the catalytic pocket of the enzyme. There is a striking parallel with the Rpa12 Pol I subunit in Schizosaccharomyces pombe (20Imazawa Y. Imai K. Yao Y. Yamamoto K. Hisatake K. Muramatsu M. Nogi Y. Mol. Gen. Genet. 2001; 264: 852-859Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar) and inS. cerevisiae (16Van Mullem V. Landrieux E. Vandenhaute J. Thuriaux P. Mol. Microbiol. 2002; (in press)PubMed Google Scholar). In particular, a rpa12deletion retaining the first 60 amino acids of the S. cerevisiae subunit has a wild-type growth and drug sensitivity pattern and suffices to incorporate the mutant subunit into Pol I (16Van Mullem V. Landrieux E. Vandenhaute J. Thuriaux P. Mol. Microbiol. 2002; (in press)PubMed Google Scholar). This parallel is also underscored by the common sensitivity ofrpb9 and rpa12 mutants to nucleotide-depleting agents and by the fact that both are lethal or nearly lethal in agcn5-Δ context (see below). TFIIE is an essential component of Pol II initiation, required during the synthesis of the first few nucleotides and then ejected from the elongating enzyme (43Holstege F.C.P. Tantin D. Carey M. Van der Vliet P.C. Timmers H.T.M. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 810-819Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar, 44Zawel L. Kumar K.P. Reinberg D.

This factor is known to directly bind Pol II (41Bushnell D.A. Bamdad C. Kornberg R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 20170-20174Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar), and electron microscope crystallography has located this factor in front of the Pol II DNA channel (46Leuther K.K.

In this study, we found that Rpb9 physically interacted with the large subunit of TFIIE (Tfa1) in a two-hybrid assay, and that this binding involves a conserved domain also present in the human TFIIEα subunit. rpb9−Δmarkedly reduces the co-immunopurification of Tfa1 with Pol II. Moreover, this mutant becomes lethal when combined with a temperature-sensitive allele of Tfa1, tfa1-C127W. These data strongly suggest that the interaction between Rpb9 and Tfa1 is physiologically relevant, allowing Pol II to recruit TFIIE at the edge of the DNA channel. It is tempting to speculate that the association-dissociation of TFIIE is determined by a conformational change in mobile lobe-Rpb9-jaw module hypothesized previously (2Cramer P. Bushnell D.A. Konrberg R.D. Science. 2001; 292: 1863-1876Crossref PubMed Scopus (985) Google Scholar). RNA polymerases are endowed with an RNA cleavage activity that cleaves the 3′-end of the transcript in halted elongation complexes and presumably determines the processivity of transcription. The catalytic site of cleavage has not been identified. As discussed elsewhere (47Rozenfeld S. Thuriaux P. EMB0 Rep. 2001; 2: 598-603Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar), polymerization and cleavage could be two mutually exclusive forms of the magnesium-binding domain located in the catalytic pocket of Pol II. A Pol III mutant lacking Rpc11 has no cleavage activityin vitro (7Chédin S. Riva M. Schultz P. Sentenac A. Carles C. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 3857-3871Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). TFIIS activates this cleavage activity when recruited on Pol II (13Reines D. Mote Jr., J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 1917-1921Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar) in a way that largely depends on the presence of Rpb9 (9Awrey D.E. Weibacher R.G. Hemming S.A. Orlicky S.M. Kane C.M. Edwards A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 14747-14754Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Unlike rpb9, rpc11 mutants are lethal, which led to the speculation that, in Pol III, Rpc11 may combine functions separately carried by Rpb9 and TFIIS in Pol II (7Chédin S. Riva M. Schultz P. Sentenac A. Carles C. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 3857-3871Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). We show here that the growth defect of rpb9-Δ is not aggravated in ppr2-Δ cells lacking TFIIS. In vivo then, Rpb9 and TFIIS have no additive effects on elongation. Nevertheless, it would be interesting to examine the in vitro properties of the elongating complex in these double mutants. Our data reveal yet another facet of Pol II elongation by showing thatrpb9-Δ cells fail to grow when lacking the histone acetyltransferase activity of either the Elongator (34Wittschieben B.O. Otero G. de Bizemont T. Fellows J. Erdjument-Bromage H. Ohba R. Li Y. Allis C.D. Tempst P. Svejstrup J.Q. Mol.

Allis C.D. Winston F. Berger S.L. Workman J.L. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 1640-1650Crossref PubMed Scopus (890) Google Scholar). These factors may have partially overlapping functions (37Wittschieben B.O. Fellows J. Du W. Stillman D.J. Svejstrup J.Q. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 3060-3068Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar), but the Elongator is thought to be associated specifically with an elongating form of Pol II (34Wittschieben B.O. Otero G. de Bizemont T. Fellows J. Erdjument-Bromage H. Ohba R. Li Y. Allis C.D. Tempst P. Svejstrup J.Q. Mol. Cell. 1999; 4: 123-128Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (396) Google Scholar). Gcn5, the catalytic subunit of SAGA, acetylates lysine 14 of histone H3 and lysines 8 and 16 of histone H4 (48Kuo M.H. Brownell J.E. Sobel R.E. Ranalli T.A. Cook R.G. Edmondson D.G. Roth S.Y. Allis C.D. Nature. 1996; 383: 269-272Crossref PubMed Scopus (514) Google Scholar). The physiological substrate of the Elongator catalytic subunit, Elp3, is not known (to the best of our knowledge) but may also involve histone tails. Synthetic lethality need not imply a physical interaction between Rpb9 and the Elongator or SAGA factors but clearly means that there is a functional synergy between these proteins. In fact, a simple interpretation of our data is that hypoacetylated histones are an obstacle to elongation, due to the persistence of nucleosomes on the DNA template. It is known that nucleosomal templates are a poor substrate for the elongating enzyme (21Conaway J.W. Shilatifard A. Dvir A. Conaway R.C. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2000; 25: 375-380Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar, 49Izban M.G. Luse D.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 13647-13655Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Rpb9 may thus help the elongating Pol II to overcome these obstacles. This, however, is probably not a direct consequence of the RNA cleaving activity because ppr2-Δ mutants have no effect onelp3-Δ or gcn5-Δ. Rpb9 may be part of a general mechanism allowing Pol II to sense the state of DNA (and, in particular, its degree of nucleosome packaging) prior to elongation (21Conaway J.W. Shilatifard A. Dvir A. Conaway R.C. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2000; 25: 375-380Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar) as befits the position of this subunit at the edge of Pol II, ahead of the DNA template (2Cramer P. Bushnell D.A. Konrberg R.D. Science. 2001; 292: 1863-1876Crossref PubMed Scopus (985) Google Scholar). The related Pol I (Rpa12) (6Nogi Y. Yano R. Dodd J. Carles C. Nomura M. Mol. Cell.

Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 3857-3871Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar) probably have a very similar function. Our observation that Rpb9 contributes to the binding of TFIIE onto Pol II also makes sense in this context given the role played by that factor in the transition from initiation to elongation (44Zawel L. Kumar K.P. Reinberg D. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 1479-1490Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar, 45Kugel J.F. Goodrich J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Chien C.T. Sternglanz R. Fields S. BioTechniques. 1993; 14: 920-924PubMed Google Scholar). The molecular basis of this transition is unknown, but it probably requires a major change in Pol II conformation, associated with the opening or closing movements between the upper (Rpb2) and lower (Rpb1) sides of the DNA channel (22Gnatt A.L. Cramer P. Fu J. Bushnel D.A. Kornberg R.D. Science. 2001; 292: 1876-1882Crossref PubMed Scopus (755) Google Scholar). By holding together the lobe of Rpb2 and the jaw of Rpb1, the N-terminal half of Rpb9 could evidently play a major role in these conformational changes. How this ultimately controls the conformation of the catalytic pocket and whether this involves the conserved zinc ribbon of Rpb9 must await further investigations. We are especially grateful to Jean-Christophe Andrau for pointing out to us the existence of a two-hybrid response between Tfa1 and Rpb9. We thank Claire Boschiéro, Olivier Gadal, Sylvie Labarre, and Benoit Van Driessche for their help during this work, Steeve Buratowski for Tfa1 mutants, and Roger Sayre and Christian Marck for the RASMOL and DNA STRIDER software."

Several studies have demonstrated that TNF confers insulin resistance by promoting phosphorylation of serine residues on IRS-1 and IRS-2 (14Kanety H. Feinstein R. Papa M.Z. Hemi R. Karasik A. J.

This impairs the interaction of the IRS proteins with the IR and diminishes their ability to undergo insulin-induced tyrosine phosphorylation (16Paz K. Hemi R. LeRoith D. Karasik A. Elhanany E.

The effects of TNF are mimicked by treating cells with sphingomyelinase (SMase) or after addition of cell-permeable ceramide analogs suggesting that TNF may utilize the sphingomyelin pathway to impair insulin action (16Paz K.

These include oxidative agents (19Rudich A. Tirosh A. Potashnik R. Hemi R. Kanety H. Bashan N. Diabetes. 1998; 47: 1562-1569Crossref PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar), osmotic shock (20Chen D. Fucini R.V. Olson A.L. Hemmings B.A. Pessin J.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 4684-4694Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and translational inhibitors like anisomycin (AN) (21Aguirre V. Uchida T. Yenush L. Davis R. White M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 9047-9054Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1157) Google Scholar). Recently it has been demonstrated that AN, similar to TNF, mediates serine phosphorylation of IRS-1 and a concomitant reduction of insulin signaling (22Rui L. Aguirre V. Kim J.K. Shulman G.I. Lee A. Corbould A. Dunaif A. White M.F. J. Clin. Invest. 2001; 107: 181-189Crossref PubMed Scopus (477) Google Scholar). However, the nature of the IRS kinases, stimulated by TNF or other stress inducers, remains unknown. TNF and AN activate several serine/threonine kinases, including ERK1/2, JNK, PI3K and IKKβ (23Kyriakis J.M. Avruch J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 24313-24316Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1024) Google Scholar, 24Wallach D. Varfolomeev E.E. Malinin N.L. Goltsev Y.V. Kovalenko A.V. Boldin M.P. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1999; 17: 331-367Crossref PubMed Scopus (1122) Google Scholar), which were all implicated in mediating serine/threonine phosphorylation of IRS proteins. TNF-induced IRS phosphorylation in 3T3-L1 adipocytes is mediated by kinases of the MEK1/2-ERK1/2 pathway (22Rui L. Aguirre V. Kim J.K. Shulman G.I. Lee A. Corbould A. Dunaif A. White M.F. J. Clin. Invest. 2001; 107: 181-189Crossref PubMed Scopus (477) Google Scholar, 25Engelman J.A. Berg A.H. Lewis R.Y. Lisanti M.P. Scherer P.E. Mol. Endocrinol. 2000; 14: 1557-1569Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), whereas kinases of the PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway mediate IRS phosphorylation in myotubes (26Ozes O.N. Akca H. Mayo L.D. Gustin J.A. Maehama T. Dixon J.E. Donner D.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 4640-4645Crossref PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar). TNF has also been shown to induce activation of IKKβ. Accordingly, inhibition of IKKβ prevents serine phosphorylation of IRS proteins induced by high fat diet, TNF or phosphatase inhibitors, whereas it improves insulin-stimulated tyrosine phosphorylation of IRS proteins, indicating that IKKβ or its downstream effectors serve as IRS kinases (27Yuan M. Konstantopoulos N. Lee J. Hansen L. Li Z.W. Karin M. Shoelson S.E. Science. 2001; 293: 1673-1677Crossref PubMed Scopus (1614) Google Scholar). Finally, TNF induces complex formation between JNK and IRS-1, suggesting that JNK might also mediate TNF-induced serine phosphorylation of IRS proteins and insulin resistance (21Aguirre V. Uchida T. Yenush L. Davis R. White M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 9047-9054Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1157) Google Scholar, 22Rui L. Aguirre V. Kim J.K. Shulman G.I. Lee A. Corbould A. Dunaif A. White M.F. J. Clin. Invest. 2001; 107: 181-189Crossref PubMed Scopus (477) Google Scholar). Thus, it appears that cellular stress stimulates multiple pathways leading to the induction of insulin resistance.In the present study we provide evidence that TNF and other inducers of cellular stress like AN and cycloheximide utilize a common mechanism for the induction of insulin resistance, which involves a ligand-independent transactivation of ErbB2/ErbB3, two members of the EGF receptor family (28Yarden Y. Sliwkowski M.X. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 2: 127-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (5535) Google Scholar, 29Prenzel N. Fischer O.M. Streit S. Hart S. Ullrich A. Endocr. Relat. Cancer. 2001; 8: 11-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (555) Google Scholar). This activates PI3K and its downstream serine/threonine kinases, induces serine/threonine phosphorylation of IRS proteins, and promotes insulin resistance. Because NDFβ1, the natural ligand of ErbB3, acts in a similar manner, by stimulating PI3K activity and impairing insulin signaling, it suggests that transactivation of receptor tyrosine kinases by cellular stress might be the underlying cause for the induction of insulin resistance.DISCUSSIONThe present study provides evidence that cellular stress, triggered by the inflammatory cytokine TNF or by translational inhibitors such as AN and CHX, activates the ErbB2/ErbB3 receptors, thereby leading to the activation of a PI3K-regulated pathway. This induces serine phosphorylation of IRS-1 and IRS-2 proteins and causes an impairment of insulin action.Several lines of evidence support such a mechanism. First, we could demonstrate that TNF, SMase, CHX, or AN treatment activated ErbB2 and ErbB3. Moreover, activation of ErbB2 and ErbB3 paralleled the suppression in insulin signaling. Tyrosine-phosphorylated ErbB2/ErbB3 proteins could be detected within 10 min of TNF, SMase, CHX, and AN treatment, whereas the inhibition of insulin-induced tyrosine-phosphorylated IRS-1 and -2 followed a similar time course. Second, specific inhibitors of the ErbB2 tyrosine kinase, AG825 and PD168393, prevented both the stress-induced activation of ErbB2 and ErbB3 as well as the suppression of insulin signaling. The inhibition of tyrosine phosphorylation of ErbB3 by ErbB2 inhibitors indicates that ErbB2 activates both ErbB3 and PI3K. Thus, in response to cellular stress, ErbB2 transphosphorylates the kinase-impaired ErbB3 through heterodimerization, leading to recruitment and activation of PI3K (Fig.7). Likewise, activation of ErbB2/ErbB3 heterodimers by NDFβ1, the natural agonist of ErbB3, mimics the inhibitory effect of TNF, SMase, and AN on insulin signaling. NDFβ1, similar to stress stimuli, induced PI3K activity through association of the p85 subunit of PI3K with tyrosine-phosphorylated sites, which reside predominantly on ErbB3 within the ErbB2/ErbB3 heterodimers. Inhibition of PI3K activity, either indirectly by specific inhibitors of ErbB2 or directly by wortmannin and LY294002, effectively prevented the serine phosphorylation of IRS proteins and the decrease in their insulin-induced tyrosine phosphorylation. Taken together, these findings underline the significance of the ErbB2/ErbB3-stimulated PI3K pathway to the induction of insulin resistance by TNF and other stress stimuli.IRS proteins play a central role in regulation of insulin action. Although phosphorylation of IRS proteins on tyrosine residues propagates insulin's signals (2Yenush L. White M.F. Bioessays. 1997; 19: 491-500Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar, 4Myers Jr., M.G. White M.F. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol.

Chem. 1997; 272: 29911-29918Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (447) Google Scholar). Serine phosphorylation can induce the dissociation of IRS proteins from the insulin receptor (IR), hinder tyrosine phosphorylation sites, release the IRS proteins from intracellular complexes that maintain them in close proximity to the receptor, induce IRS proteins degradation, or turn IRS proteins into inhibitors of the IRK. This inhibits insulin signaling and may induce a state of insulin resistance (reviewed in Ref. 41Zick Y. Trends. Cell Biol. 2001; 11: 437-441Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar).A major role to the induction of insulin resistance is attributed to cytokines like TNF (13Moller D.E.

Platelet-derived growth factor inhibits insulin-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of IRS-1 in 3T3-L1 adipocytes, and PI3K inhibitors abrogate this effect (42Ricort J.M. Tanti J.F. Van Obberghen E.

In the same cells EGF reduces tyrosine phosphorylation of IRS-1 via an MEK-ERK1/2-dependent pathway (25Engelman J.A. Berg A.H. Lewis R.Y. Lisanti M.P. Scherer P.E. Mol. Endocrinol. 2000; 14: 1557-1569Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Recently, communication between cytokines and growth factors signaling systems has emerged as an important mechanism that enables cells to integrate a multitude of signals from its environment (28Yarden Y. Sliwkowski M.X. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 2: 127-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (5535) Google Scholar, 29Prenzel N. Fischer O.M. Streit S. Hart S. Ullrich A. Endocr. Relat. Cancer. 2001; 8: 11-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (555) Google Scholar). Several studies have demonstrated that TNF transactivates the EGF receptor and employs its signaling pathways to transduce the cytokine's effects. For example, transactivation of the EGF receptor by TNF plays a pivotal role in TNF-induced NF-κB activation (45Hirota K. Murata M. Itoh T. Yodoi J. Fukuda K. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 25953-25958Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar), whereas TNF and interleukin-1β inhibit apolipoprotein B secretion via the EGF receptor signaling pathways (46Murthy S. Mathur S.N. Field F.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 9222-9229Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar).The EGF/ErbB family of receptor tyrosine kinases includes the EGF receptor (ErbB1), ErbB2, ErbB3, and ErbB4 (28Yarden Y. Sliwkowski M.X. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 2: 127-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (5535) Google Scholar, 29Prenzel N. Fischer O.M. Streit S. Hart S. Ullrich A. Endocr. Relat. Cancer. 2001; 8: 11-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (555) Google Scholar). Signaling requires the formation of homodimeric or heterodimeric complexes of these receptors. ErbB2 does not have a ligand-binding capacity, but it is the preferred dimerization partner for the other members. ErbB3 has a severely impaired intrinsic kinase activity; therefore heterodimerization is a crucial step for ErbB3-mediated signal transduction. It is noteworthy that ErbB3 has six putative phosphotyrosine binding sites for PI3K and potently activates this enzyme (28Yarden Y. Sliwkowski M.X. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 2: 127-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (5535) Google Scholar, 29Prenzel N. Fischer O.M. Streit S. Hart S. Ullrich A. Endocr. Relat. Cancer. 2001; 8: 11-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (555) Google Scholar). The present study demonstrates that TNF and AN transactivate ErbB2 and ErbB3 and utilize their signaling pathways to inhibit insulin signaling in Fao cells. The activation of ErbB2 and ErbB3 leads to stimulation of a PI3K-regulated pathway that mediates the inhibition of insulin signaling through serine phosphorylation of IRS-1 and IRS-2. This phosphorylation impairs the association of the IRS proteins with the IR and thereby diminishes their ability to undergo insulin-induced tyrosine phosphorylation and to further recruit downstream effectors.The nature of the IRS kinases located downstream of PI3K that induce insulin resistance is under extensive investigation. The PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway was shown to mediate TNF inhibition of insulin signaling through phosphorylation of serines 636 and 639 of IRS-1 (26Ozes O.N. Akca H. Mayo L.D. Gustin J.A. Maehama T. Dixon J.E. Donner D.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 4640-4645Crossref PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar). In addition, mTOR-mediated phosphorylation on serines 632, 662, and 731 of IRS-1, induced by platelet-derived growth factor in 3T3-L1 adipocytes, was found to inhibit insulin-stimulated tyrosine phosphorylation of IRS-1 and its ability to bind PI3K (44De Li J. Fea K. Roth R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 9351-9356Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). Inhibition of tyrosine phosphorylation of IRS proteins by AN and SMase in Fao cells is blocked by rapamycin, 2R. Hemi and H. Kanety unpublished observations. an inhibitor of mTOR, suggesting that a PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway, stimulated through ErbB2/ErbB3 activation, is required to mediate the inhibitory effects of these cellular stressors. However, because SMase, a downstream effector of TNF, increases the cellular content of ceramide, TNF might also trigger a ceramide-activated kinase such as PKCζ that might serve as an IRS kinase (16Paz K.

Indeed, PKCζ, a downstream effector of PI3K, is activated upon prolonged insulin treatment of cultured cells leading to IRS phosphorylation (47Liu Y.F. Paz K. Herschkovitz A. Alt A. Tennenbaum T.

Quon M.J. J. Biol.

Cell Biol. 2001; 11: 437-441Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). Recent studies shifted the spotlight to IKKβ, a downstream target of PKCζ (27Yuan M. Konstantopoulos N. Lee J. Hansen L. Li Z.W. Karin M. Shoelson S.E. Science. 2001; 293: 1673-1677Crossref PubMed Scopus (1614) Google Scholar, 49Kim J.K. Kim Y.J. Fillmore J.J. Chen Y. Moore I. Lee J. Yuan M. Li Z.W. Karin M Perret P. Shoelson S.E. Shulman G.I. J. Clin. Invest. 2001; 108: 437-446Crossref PubMed Scopus (611) Google Scholar). Inhibition of IKKβ by high doses of salicylates prevents serine/threonine phosphorylation of IRS proteins induced by TNF, high fat diet, or phosphatase inhibitors, whereas it improves insulin-stimulated tyrosine phosphorylation of IRS proteins, indicating that IKKβ or its downstream effectors serve as IRS kinases. The c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase (JNK) promotes insulin resistance by associating with IRS-1 and phosphorylating Ser-307, which inhibits insulin-stimulated tyrosine phosphorylation of IRS-1 (21Aguirre V. Uchida T. Yenush L. Davis R. White M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 9047-9054Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1157) Google Scholar). However, JNK itself is unlikely to serve as an insulin- or TNF-stimulated IRS kinase, because its activity is insensitive to inhibitors that block phosphorylation of Ser-307 in response to these stimuli (22Rui L. Aguirre V. Kim J.K. Shulman G.I. Lee A. Corbould A. Dunaif A. White M.F. J. Clin. Invest. 2001; 107: 181-189Crossref PubMed Scopus (477) Google Scholar). Taken together, these studies suggest that several serine/threonine kinases, downstream of PI3K, are potential IRS kinases. Activation of PI3K cascades either by growth factors like insulin, platelet-derived growth factor, and NDFβ1 or by inflammatory cytokines and translational inhibitors like TNF and AN, respectively, may lead to insulin resistance through IRS phosphorylation by these kinases.The mechanism(s) underlying the activation of ErbB proteins by TNF and AN remain poorly understood. TNF transactivates the ErbB1 receptor in a thiol-sensitive manner in NIH3T3 cells, and this enhances NF-kB activity (45Hirota K. Murata M. Itoh T. Yodoi J. Fukuda K. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 25953-25958Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Similarly, we have found that the TNF- and AN-induced transactivation of ErbB2/ErbB3 in Fao cells is suppressed byN-acetyl-l-cysteine. 3R. Hemi, A. Karasik and H. Kanety, manuscript in preparation. This antioxidant prevented the activation of the PI3K/Akt pathway by the cellular stressors and restored insulin sensitivity.3These findings suggest that reactive oxygen intermediates may play a role in the activation of ErbB2/ErbB3 by TNF and AN, thus leading to PI3K activation and IRS proteins phosphorylation. Several studies have suggested that reversible inactivation of protein tyrosine phosphatases by stress stimuli (e.g. UV radiation, hyperosmotic shock, and TNF), due to oxidation of reactive cysteine residues in their catalytic domain, modulate the activation state of ErbB1 or ErbB2 receptors (29Prenzel N. Fischer O.M. Streit S. Hart S. Ullrich A. Endocr. Relat. Cancer. 2001; 8: 11-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (555) Google Scholar, 50Knebel A. Rahmsdorf H.J. Ullrich A. Herrlich P.

Alternatively, activation of non-receptor tyrosine kinases was suggested to mediate the activation of ErbB proteins by different cellular stressors (52Carpenter G. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 146: 697-702Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar). The tyrosine kinase Pyk2 has been implicated in the activation of ErbB2/ErbB3 by SMase in Fao cells (38Emkey R. Kahn C.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 31182-31189Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar), whereas Src kinases were suggested to mediate ErbB1 activation by H2O2 (53Wang X. McCullough K.D. Wang X. Carpenter G. Holbrook N. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 28345-28371Google Scholar) and heat shock (54Lin R.Z. Hu Z. Chin J.H. Hoffman B.B. J. Biol.

Attempts to identify the upstream pathways that link TNF and AN to ErbB2/ErbB3 transactivation are currently underway.Stress conditions like acute infection, burn, or trauma are associated with alterations in carbohydrate metabolism that include enhanced glucose uptake and utilization, increased glucose production, depressed glycogenesis, glucose intolerance, and insulin resistance (55Barry A.M.

Two classes of glycolytic aldolases can be distinguished that use different mechanisms to cleave the same substrate: Class I aldolases, present in higher eucaryotes and plants, catalyze their reaction mechanism via a Schiff base formation with a keto substrate whereas Class II aldolases, present in eubacteria and lower eucaryotes, require a divalent metal ion as a cofactor (2Rutter W.J. Fed. Proc. Fed. Am. Soc. Exp. Biol. 1964; 23: 1248-1257Google Scholar). The catalytic mechanism of Class I fructose-1,6-bisphosphate aldolase has been well established in terms of reaction mechanism intermediates (3Rose I.A. Warms J.V.B. Kuo J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 692-701Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and the forward reaction can be represented by the following minimal reaction (Reaction FR1) consistent with the kinetic data (4Rose I.A.

Tchola O. Horecker B.L. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1962; 9: 38-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar) with the keto substrates, Fru-P2,1 Fru-P, and DHAP. In this forward reaction, Schiff base formation with Fru-P2, E=DG, is thought to occur through transient formation of a dipolar carbinolamine-1 (4Rose I.A. Warms J.V.B. Biochemistry. 1985; 24: 3952-3957Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar,6Ray B.D. Harper E.T. Fife W.K. J. Am. Chem.

Proton exchange with the dipolar carbinolamine results in the neutral species-2, which upon further protonation of the hydroxyl becomes dehydrated forming the protonated imine form of the Schiff base-3 (8Avigad G. Englard S. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1972; 158: 337-346Crossref Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Proton abstraction of the Fru-P2 O4 hydroxyl initiates a rearrangement resulting in cleavage of the substrate C3–C4 bond and enamine formation in the active site yielding intermediate E–D·G (1Rose I.A.

Folding of each subunit polypeptide chain corresponds to that of a β-barrel structure with the active site located deep in the β-barrel center and is shown in Fig.1. Amino acid residues in the active site interior are highly conserved throughout evolution whereas peripheral active site residues differ among aldolases (15Kelley P.M. Tolan D.R. Plant Physiol. 1986; 82: 1076-1081Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The residue responsible for nucleophilic attack on the keto substrate in Schiff base formation has been identified as Lys-229 (5Grazi E. Rowley P.T. Cheng T. Tchola O. Horecker B.L. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1962; 9: 38-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar), situated in the active site interior (17Blom N. Sygusch J. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1997; 4: 36-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar), whereas Lys-107 on the active site periphery has been shown from protection experiments to bind the C6-phosphate of Fru-P2 (16Anai M. Lai C.Y. Horecker B.L. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1973; 156: 712-719Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Mutagenesis experiments of conserved active site residues have also implicated Arg-148 in C6-phosphate binding (24Choi K.H. Mazurkie A.S. Morris A.J. Utheza D. Tolan D.R. Allen K.N. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 12655-12664Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar) whereas structural studies have shown that Ser-271 promotes C1-phosphate binding (17Blom N. Sygusch J. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1997; 4: 36-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). In contrast, the active site residues that are implicated in the proton transfers linking the covalent intermediates along the reaction trajectory have not been unambiguously identified. In the absence of structural data on covalent intermediate complexes, investigation of amino acid likely to be involved in proton exchanges has been guided by spatial proximity to Lys-229. Mutations of conserved residues Asp-33 and Lys-146, which are also within hydrogen bonding of each other, significantly comprised catalytic activity and, based on kinetic characterization, were postulated in mediating C3–C4 bond cleavage (18Morris A.J.

In the structure of the Michaelis complex with DHAP, however, both residues are within hydrogen bonding distance of the incoming keto oxygen (17Blom N. Sygusch J. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1997; 4: 36-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar) suggesting rather roles in Schiff base formation. Indeed, point mutation Lys-146 → Arg results in Schiff base formation becoming rate-determining (19Morris A.J. Davenport C.R. Tolan D.R. Protein Eng. 1996; 9: 61-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Alanine substitutions of active site residues, Glu-34 and Arg-42, by contrast do not significantly reduce activity or binding (24Choi K.H. Mazurkie A.S. Morris A.J. Utheza D. Tolan D.R. Allen K.N. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 12655-12664Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Mutations of conserved residue Glu-187, adjacent to both Lys-146 and Lys-229 in the active site, significantly compromised activity and perturbed the rate of Schiff base formation of an aromatic inhibitor with Lys-146 (22Blonski C. Demoissac D. Périé J. Sygusch J. Biochem. J. 1997; 323: 71-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Structural data from the Michaelis complex of substrate bound to rabbit liver aldolase places Glu-187 within hydrogen bonding distance of both Fru-P2 O4 hydroxyl as well as Lys-229. 2N. Blom, A. White, J. Allard, and J. Sygusch, manuscript submitted. Structural studies performed with Fru-P2 in complex with human muscle isozyme or an inactive point mutant, K146A, were, however, not unequivocal and did not allow definitive functional assignment of active site residues (23Dalby A.

The structural and enzymatic data alludes to a significant role by Glu-187 in the reaction mechanism of class I aldolase that warrants further investigation. A role by Glu-187 in catalyzing proton transfers would be consistent with its central location in the active site. Not only is Glu-187 within hydrogen bonding distance of possible proton donors, Lys-146 and Lys-229, but it is also within hydrogen bonding distance of a proton acceptor, conserved active site residue Glu-189. Functionality of Glu-187 was explored by assessing the impact of a series of point mutations that drastically diminish proton transfer capability. Isosteric point mutations, E187Q, E189Q, and K229M, and side-chain deletion mutants, E187A and E189A, were analyzed by combination of enzymological and crystallographic techniques. Activity profiling as a function of pH and solvent isotope effects were used to assay proton transfer capability while chemical trapping of intermediates in the presence of labeled [32P]DHAP and [1-32P]Fru-P2 (3Rose I.A. Warms J.V.B. Kuo J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 692-701Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and carbanion oxidation data were used to determine the formation of covalent intermediates in Glu-187 mutants. Structural studies on three point mutations, E187A, E187Q, and K229M, whose activities were significantly compromised, were also determined to assess active site integrity and possible conformational rearrangements. The structural and biochemical analysis indicates that Glu-187 is the base responsible for promoting cleavage of the C3–C4 bond in substrate and has a significant role, together with Lys-146, in turnover of cationic Schiff base intermediates. Indeed, a conserved glutamate residue is found in 2-keto-3-deoxy-6-phosphogluconate (KDPG) aldolase, which also possesses a β-barrel subunit fold, within hydrogen bonding distance of the active site lysine responsible for Schiff base formation and has been implicated in both Schiff base formation as well as bond cleavage (25Allard J. Grolchulski P. Sygusch J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 3679-3684Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Expression and purification of recombinant rabbit muscle aldolase and corresponding point mutations were performed as reported previously (26Berthiaume L. Tolan D.R. Sygusch J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 10826-10835Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Purification was based on substrate affinity elution from carboxymethyl-Sepharose stationary phase and using gel filtration for protein clean up. Aldolase cleavage assay was measured by following NADH oxidation at 340 nm at 22 °C using a coupled assay system, triose-phosphate isomerase and glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, and detected using a Lambda 2 spectrophotometer (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) (27Racker E. J. Biol. Chem. 1952; 196: 347-351Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The rate of substrate cleavage was determined by measuring the decrease in absorbance/minute at 340 nm. Specific activity assays were initiated by addition of substrate to a cuvette containing aldolase made up in 100 mm TEA-HCl, pH 7.6, 1 mm EDTA, 0.42 mm NADH, and coupling enzymes 1 μg/ml triose-phosphate isomerase and 10 μg/ml glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase. The cleavage rate of Fru-P2 was measured over a substrate concentration range of 10 μm to 1 mm Fru-P2, using 0.3 μg in the case of the wild type enzyme, 10–300 μg for point mutants E187A, E187Q, E189A, and E189Q, and 2 mg of enzyme for point mutation K229M. Kinetic parameters were determined from double-reciprocal plots. Aldolase concentration was determined by absorbance using extinction coefficient, ε280 (1%) = 0.91 ml·mg−1·cm−1. Activity profiles as a function of pH were performed using 50 mm Tris-HAc buffer at varying concentrations of Fru-P2 to determine kinetic parameters, V max and K m, as a function of pH. Measurements in all activity assays were made in duplicate. Estimated errors in kinetic parameters were on approximately ±20% of estimated value. The enamine carbanion intermediate can be oxidized by hexacyanoferrate(III) and is quantitative with enamine concentration (28Healy M.J. Christen P. Biochemistry. 1973; 12: 35-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). The rate of hexacyanoferrate(III) reduction was followed by a decrease in absorption at 420 mm as previously described (26Berthiaume L. Tolan D.R. Sygusch J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 10826-10835Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Steady-state oxidation rates were measured in the presence of 1 mm Fru-P2 whereas equilibrium oxidation rates were determined in the presence of 1 mm DHAP using 0.3 μg in the case of the wild type enzyme, 10–300 μg for point mutants E187A, E187Q, E189A, and E189Q, and 1 mg of enzyme for point mutation K229M. Estimated errors in oxidation rates were on average ±20% of estimated value. To evaluate D2O kinetic solvent isotope effects, enzyme activity measurements were performed in D2O using 50 mm Tris-HAc buffer, pH 7.5, and the effect of D2O on pH was corrected for. Substrate and Tris-HAc buffer was made up as a concentration in D2O, and coupling enzymes were diluted in D2O prior to usage. Together this amounted to less than a 5% reduction in D2O concentration in the activity assay. Recombinant aldolase enzymes were dialyzed against three successive changes of D2O for at least 1 h each until measured activity became stable. Enzyme dialyzed against similar three successive changes of H2O was used for control. Covalent enzyme-substrate intermediates were characterized by acid precipitation and chemical lability of the precipitated species (3Rose I.A. Warms J.V.B. Kuo J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 692-701Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The end-point assays used a 10- to 100-fold excess of substrate with respect to 0.5–1.5 nmol of enzyme. Protocols for determination of the concentration of the intermediates E=DG, E–D, and E=DH were as previously reported (3Rose I.A. Warms J.V.B. Kuo J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 692-701Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 7Highbarger L.A. Gerlt J.A. Kenyon G.L. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 41-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar, 9Kuo D.J. Rose I.A. Biochemistry. 1985; 24: 3947-3952Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Recombinant rabbit muscle aldolase preparations were incubated with either labeled [32P]DHAP (40–60 cpm/pmol) or [1-32P]Fru-P2 (55–65 cpm/pmol) at pH 7.5 in 50 mm TEA-HAc buffer at 20 °C. Labeled inorganic phosphate was estimated at ∼0.1–0.2% of labeled Fru-P2and ∼10% of labeled DHAP. To each reaction mixture, 100 μg of bovine serum albumin was added to minimize nonspecific losses of labeled intermediates. The concentration of labeled Fru-P2was 1 mm for native enzyme and 0.4 mm for mutant enzymes. Enzyme preparations were used fresh and corresponded to a maximal activity of 16 units/mg for native enzyme (see Table IIbelow). Under these conditions, the native recombinant enzyme is maximally active and kinetically homogeneous (3Rose I.A. Warms J.V.B. Kuo J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 692-701Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Imine and carbinolamine complexes of aldolase with Fru-P2 and DHAP were isolated in the protein precipitate and recovered as Fru-P2 and DHAP after mild acid extraction of the protein precipitate (3Rose I.A. Warms J.V.B. Kuo J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 692-701Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Pi produced in the acid quench is derived from the eneamine intermediate (9Kuo D.J. Rose I.A. Biochemistry. 1985; 24: 3947-3952Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar) and was quantitatively extracted into 2-methyl-1-propanol as the acid molybdate complex (29Berenblum I. Chain E. Biochem. J. 1938; 32: 295Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Precipitation of the reaction mixture was performed with cold 1m trichloroacetic acid and centrifugation for 1–2 min at 4 °C. Extraction of the protein pellet with 0.5 n NaOH for 2 min at 37 °C released 32Pi, and alkali label counts were used to calculate the concentration of ketamine,E=DH, whereas residual counts in the pellet reflected the concentration of ketamine, E=DG, in the forward reaction. Minimum incubation times were 3 s using labeled Fru-P2and 20 s with labeled DHAP to allow full conversion of DHAP gem diol form to the free keto form. In the forward steady-state reaction, 1 mm [1-32P]Fru-P2 concentration was used with native recombinant enzyme to ensure that total Fru-P2 concentration remained in excess with respect to enzyme over the 3-s assay interval. Controls performed used identical protocols with enzyme omitted.Table IIKinetic parameters and solvent isotope effects of Fru-P2cleavage reaction for recombinant mutant aldolases of active site residues Glu-187, Glu-189, and Lys-229 assayed at pH 7.6Enzymek catK mD2ok cat2-aSolvent isotope effect represented by ratio ofk catH2O/k catD2O.s−1μmNative recombinant42.2 ± 0.85.1 ± 1.92.7E187Q0.03 ± 0.00313.4 ± 1.12.9E187A0.12 ± 0.0156.2 ± 0.61.4E189Q1.69 ± 0.0910.9 ± 1.52.6E189A36.9 ± 1.55.7 ± 1.13.7K229M<10−5ND2-bND, not determined.ND2-a Solvent isotope effect represented by ratio ofk catH2O/k catD2O.2-b ND, not determined. Open table in a new tab Kinetic trapping experiments using mutant aldolases were conducted under identical conditions as the native recombinant enzyme. To assess steady-state levels in the forward reaction in E187A and E187Q mutants, trapping experiments were also carried out for 1 and 20 min, respectively. Chase solutions diluted carrier 10-fold, except in the case of forward reaction with Glu-187 mutants where the dilution was 25-fold. All kinetic trapping experiments were performed in triplicate from at least two different enzyme preparations, and results were averaged. Fluctuation in replicates was 1–2% of average value for a given preparation. Backgrounds were significantly lower in precipitates used to estimate ketamine populations compared with enamine populations, which are derived from supernatants that had larger background counts due to the presence of inorganic phosphate. Errors in intermediate populations were estimated at ∼15% and ∼25%, respectively, for ketamine and enamine populations based on values obtained from different enzyme preparations and are shown below in Tables IV and V. Rate constants, k, characterizing time taken to reach steady state in Glu-187 mutants, were obtained by solving the relation At = A∞[1 − exp (−kt)], whereA t and A ∞ represent intermediate concentrations at time t and t= ∞, respectively, such that, k=−1l lnA∞−AlA∞Equation 1 Table IVForward reaction steady state with recombinant aldolases showing stoichiometries of covalent intermediates trapped in the presence of saturation concentration of [1-32P]Fru-P2 and chased with cold Fru-P2 (10 mm)EnzymeKetamine Fru-P2EneamineKetamine DHAPPre-chasePost-chasePre-chasePost-chasePre-chasePost-chaseNative4-aFor native recombinant enzyme, 1 mm [1-32P]Fru-P2 was used in reaction mixture and chased with 10 mm of cold Fru-P2.

Triose-P isomerase and glycerol-P dehydrogenase used for triose-P detection in the steady-state forward reaction were increased with respect to concentrations used previously (3Rose I.A. Warms J.V.B. Kuo J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 692-701Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In commercial preparations of triose-P isomerase (Roche Molecular Biochemicals), lag in triose-P turnover correlated with higher ketamine (E=DG) accumulating on the native enzyme. Increasing concentration of triose-P trapping enzymes to 3× of previous values minimized this accumulation. Even greater concentrations had no further significant effect. Crystals for recombinant mutant aldolases were obtained using vapor diffusion technique and/or batch crystallization (10Sygusch J. Beaudry D. Allaire M. Proc. Natl Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 7846-7850Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). Crystal growth experiments using mutant Glu-187 proteins were also performed in microgravity by a step gradient liquid-liquid diffusion method (31Sygusch J. Coulombe R. Cassanto J.M. Sportiello M.G. Todd P. J. Cryst. Growth. 1996; 162: 167-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Protein crystallization experiments were performed on NASA Shuttle flight STS-86 and involved a sliding block technology that superposes, following block activation, two fluid half-wells that were initially separated. The initial protein solution contained 40% saturated ammonium sulfate and 10 mg/ml concentration of protein and was allowed to equilibrate for 10 min in microgravity against an equal solution (150 μl) of 50% saturated ammonium sulfate to induce nucleation and then transferred to a second solution containing 43% saturated ammonium sulfate. This technology is best performed in a microgravity environment, because it is based on free liquid-liquid interface diffusion of a precipitant solution against a protein solution. Superposition allows diffusion to occur, inducing nucleation and crystal growth. Ground control crystals for both mutants were grown by batch method on the ground as described previously (10Sygusch J. Beaudry D. Allaire M. Proc. Natl Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 7846-7850Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). In each case, this exemplified protein crystal growth under best laboratory conditions. Protein crystals were recovered for both Glu-187 mutants at the end of the 10-day microgravity mission. Microgravity-grown crystals of mutant E187A yielded a visible diffraction pattern to 2.1-Å resolution compared with best ground controls, which diffracted to only 2.4-Å resolution. Crystals of mutant E187Q did not show substantial resolution difference with respect to growth in a microgravity environment. Crystals grown of both mutants independent of gravitational environment attained a maximum size of ∼1.2 × 0.8 × 0.2 mm, were cut to 0.5-mm maximum dimension, and were mounted in glass capillaries for intensity data collection. Unit-cell parameters and crystal data are summarized in Table I below. All data were collected from a single crystal using a Siemens X-100 multiwire detector mounted on a Rikagu RU-200 rotating anode generator. Data reduction was performed with the XGEN package (32Howard A.J. XGEN User Guide, Version 1.0.1990Google Scholar).

https://openalex.org/W2061397578,"Extracellular nucleotides such as ATP have been shown to regulate ion transport processes in a variety of epithelia. This effect is mediated by the activation of plasma membrane P2Y receptors, which leads to Ca2+ signaling cascade. Ion transport processes (e.g. activation of apical calcium-dependent Cl− channels) are then stimulated via an increase in [Ca2+]i. Many polarized epithelia express apical and/or basolateral P2Y receptors. To test whether apical and basolateral stimulation of P2Y receptors elicit polarized Ca2+ signaling and anion secretion, we simultaneously measured the two parameters in polarized epithelia. Although activation of P2Y receptors located at both apical and basolateral membranes evoked an increase in [Ca2+]i, only apical P2Y receptors-coupled Ca2+ release stimulated an increase in anion secretion. Moreover, the calcium influx evoked by apical and basolateral P2Y receptor stimulation is predominately via the basolateral membrane domain. It appears that the apical P2Y receptor-regulated Ca2+ release and activation of apical Cl−channels is compartmentalized in polarized epithelia with basolateral P2Y-stimulated Ca2+ release failing to activate anion secretion. These data suggest that there may be two distinct ATP-releasable Ca2+ pools, each coupled to apical and basolateral membrane receptor but linked to the same calcium influx pathway located at the basolateral membrane.

P2Y receptor stimulation results in the activation of Ca2+-dependent Cl− secretion in various types of epithelia, such as human airway epithelia (3Mason S.J. Paradiso A.M. Boucher R.C. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1991; 103: 1649-1656Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar), rat sertoli cells (4Ko W.H. Chan H.C. Chew S.B. Wong P.Y. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1998; 512: 471-480Crossref Scopus (24) Google Scholar), mouse cortical-collecting duct cells (5Thomas J. Deetjen P. Ko W.H. Jacobi C. Leipziger J. J. Membr. Biol. 2001; 183: 115-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar), and both human and equine sweat gland epithelia (6Bovell D.L. Clunes M.T. Elder H.Y. Wong H.Y. Ko W.H. Eur. J.

In many cases, the P2Y receptors are located on the apical membranes. It has been proposed that ATP and possibly other nucleotides may be released across the apical membrane of stimulated epithelia (8Homolya L. Steinberg T.H. Boucher R.C. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 150: 1349-1360Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar, 9Reisin I.L. Pratt A.G. Abraham E.H. Amarat J.F. Gregory R.J. Ausiello D.A. Cantiello H.F. J. Biol.

Physiol. 1998; 275: C1391-C1406Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The released nucleotides activate the P2Y receptors either in the membranes of the nucleotide-releasing cell itself or of adjacent cells. Therefore, it is possible that these apical P2Y receptors may act as autocrine and/or paracrine regulators of epithelial transport (11Parr C.E. Sullivan D.M. Paradiso A.M. Lazarowski E.R. Birch L.H. Olsen J.C. Erb L. Weisman G.A. Boucher R.C. Turner J.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 3275-3279Crossref PubMed Scopus (356) Google Scholar, 12Schwiebert E.M. Egan M.E. Hwang T.H.

Cell. 1995; 81: 1063-1073Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (593) Google Scholar).There is, however, a paucity of information on the mechanisms of stimulus-secretion coupling in polarized epithelia that expressed both apical and basolateral P2Y receptors. It is now emerging that certain types of P2Y receptor (e.g. P2Y2) are coupled to multiple signal transduction pathways in which changes in [Ca2+]i is not obligatory (13;14). More importantly, the functional expression of at least some P2Y receptor subtypes appears to be a feature of the polarized phenotype. These receptors may not be detected in isolated non-polarized cells that have been grown on glass coverslips. Therefore, simply using the methods traditionally applied to single cells (e.g.microspectrofluorimetry, patch clamping) may fail to reveal how extracellular nucleotides regulate anion secretion in polarized epithelia.In this study, a technique that allows us to monitor nucleotide-evoked short-circuit current (I SC)1 and [Ca2+]i concurrently in a polarized epithelium was employed. The Ca2+-mediated Cl− secretion activated by various nucleotides was explored in an equine sweat gland epithelial cell line with emphasis on the polarized Ca2+mobilization and influx in response to apical versusbasolateral P2Y receptor stimulation. Previous studies have shown that the cultured cells will form polarized monolayer on permeable support (15Ko W.H. Chan H.C. Chew S.B.C. Wong P.Y.D. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1996; 493: 885-894Crossref Scopus (12) Google Scholar) and express both apical purine and pyrimidine receptors (7Ko W.H. Wilson S.M. Wong P.Y.D. Br. J.

Pharmacol. 1998; 124: 832-838Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar) that are linked to internal Ca2+ release and capacitative calcium entry (17Ko W.H. Chan H.C. Wong P.Y. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1996; 497: 19-29Crossref Scopus (24) Google Scholar).DISCUSSIONAs in other epithelia, P2Y receptors expressed in equine sweat gland epithelia are linked through G proteins to phospholipase C, resulting in the generation of IP3 and hence the mobilization of Ca2+ from internal stores (22Ko W.H. O'Dowd J.J.M. Pediani J.D. Elder H.Y. Bovell D.L. Jenkinson D.M. Wilson S.M. J. Exp. Biol. 1994; 190: 239-252PubMed Google Scholar). The emptying of internal stores activates a persistent Ca2+influx through plasma membrane (17Ko W.H. Chan H.C. Wong P.Y. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1996; 497: 19-29Crossref Scopus (24) Google Scholar). This type of Ca2+influx has been termed “capacitative Ca2+ entry” or more recently “store-operated Ca2+ entry” (23Berridge M.J. Biochem. J. 1995; 312: 1-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (1045) Google Scholar, 24Parekh A.B. Penner R. Physiol. Rev. 1997; 77: 901-930Crossref PubMed Scopus (1285) Google Scholar, 25Putney Jr., J.W. Ribeiro C.M. Cell Mol. Life Sci. 2000; 57: 1272-1286Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Previous studies have identified the functional expression of apical purinoceptors (P2Y2) and pyrimidinoceoptors (P2Y4 and/or P2Y6) when the cells are grown on permeable supports. P2X receptors are not involved in mediating the nucleotide responses (16Wilson S.M. Law V.W. Pediani J.D. Allen E.A. Wilson G. Khan Z.E. Ko W.H. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1998; 124: 832-838Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). This cell line also represents the simplest calcium-dependent secretory system in which cAMP-dependent Cl− secretion (i.e. cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator function) is absent (15Ko W.H. Chan H.C. Chew S.B.C. Wong P.Y.D. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1996; 493: 885-894Crossref Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Transepithelial secretion can only be activated by calcium-mobilizing agonists, such as extracellular ATP, UTP, UDP, and bradykinin (16Wilson S.M. Law V.W. Pediani J.D. Allen E.A. Wilson G. Khan Z.E. Ko W.H. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1998; 124: 832-838Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar).When grown on permeable support, epithelial cells usually adopt a polarized phenotype in which secretion is mediated by the complex coordination of various receptors, ion channels, Ca2+influx pathway, and others located on specialized cellular domains. Our previous findings suggest that it is important to measure both parameters, namely [Ca2+]i and anion secretion simultaneously in a polarized epithelium. Firstly, it is because the expression of certain P2Y receptor subtypes does only occur when the epithelial cells are cultivated on permeable supports, which allows polarized differentiation (14McAlroy H.L.

Down-regulation of UDP-activated receptor, probably P2Y6, during culture on glass coverslips has also been suggested in tracheal epithelial cells isolated from P2Y2-receptor-deficient mice (29Homolya L. Watt W.C. Lazarowski E.R. Koller B.H. Boucher R.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 26454-26460Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). Secondly, the activation of Cl− secretion by extracellular ATP can occur without the involvement of [Ca2+]i, i.e. the Ca2+-independent pathway (30Guo X. Merlin D. Harvey R.D. Laboisse C. Hopfer U. Am. J. Physiol. 1995; 269: C1457-C1463Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 31Guo X. Merlin D. Harvey R.D. Laboisse C. Hopfer U. J Membr.

Our recent study also suggests such a Ca2+-independent regulation of anion secretion by extracellular ATP exists in equine sweat gland and colonic epithelia (13Ko W.H. Law V.W. Wong H.Y. Wilson S.M. J. Membr. Biol. 1999; 170: 205-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar, 14McAlroy H.L. Ahmed S. Day S.M. Baines D.L. Wong H.Y. Yip C.Y. Ko W.H. Wilson S.M. Collett A. Br. J. Pharmacol. 2000; 131: 1651-1658Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Therefore, to better correlate the role of intracellular Ca2+ (both Ca2+ release and influx) with secretory activity in polarized epithelia, we adopted a technique to monitor both parameters simultaneously.A previous study (7Ko W.H. Wilson S.M. Wong P.Y.D. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1997; 121: 150-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar) using conventional Ussing chamber devices demonstrates that basolateral application of ATP could only elicit a small and variable I SC. Therefore, it was concluded that the P2Y receptors are essentially confined to the apical membrane (7Ko W.H. Wilson S.M. Wong P.Y.D. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1997; 121: 150-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). In this study in which both [Ca2+]i andI SC were monitored simultaneously, it has been shown that both sides of the epithelium contained P2Y receptors coupled to internal Ca2+ release. However, only apical ATP stimulation can exert an effect on anion secretion even though high concentrations of basolateral ATP could elicit an increase in [Ca2+]i similar to that of apical stimulation. Other nucleotides (UTP and UDP) elicited the same asymmetric patterns. Differing effects of apical versus basolateral ATP on ion transport have been reported in other epithelia such as rat epididymis (33Wong P.Y.D. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1988; 95: 1315-1321Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). In epididymal cells, apical but not basolateral ATP stimulated Cl− transport. However, the two parameters, namely [Ca2+]i and Cl− secretion, were not measured simultaneously in most of the studies. Therefore, basolateral P2Y receptors might exist in these epithelia. However, it was not detected when secretory activity was used as the only functional read-out of receptor stimulation. Moreover, the receptor-coupled second messenger pathway such as [Ca2+]i was not measured simultaneously.With the simultaneous measurement technique, the differential effects of apical versus basolateral ATP on anion secretion and intracellular calcium release can be examined in detail. First, it is interesting to find out whether unilateral ATP administration stimulated P2Y receptors and tapped internal Ca2+ pools that are associated with the plasma membrane ipsilateral but not contralateral to the stimulated receptors. The results show that even pretreated with apical ATP under Ca2+-free condition, basolateral ATP can still release Ca2+ from internal pools, but this was not accompanied by a substantial increase in anion secretion. It appears that the apical and basolateral ATP-releasable internal Ca2+ pools are separate. It may be that separate Ca2+ pools are associated with apical or basolateral P2Y receptors. Thus, the signal generated in the apical membrane can access only the pool coupled to the apical membrane. The resultant localized release of Ca2+ then activates adjacent Cl−channels that are also located on the same membrane domain. The data are conceptually in agreement with the explanation about the inability of basolateral ATP to activate anion secretion. Recently, similar results were obtained in normal and cystic fibrosis airway epithelia (34Paradiso A.M. Ribeiro C.M. Boucher R.C. J. Gen. Physiol. 2001; 117: 53-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). By using similar technique, Paradiso and his co-workers (34Paradiso A.M. Ribeiro C.M. Boucher R.C. J. Gen. Physiol. 2001; 117: 53-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar) found that intracellular Ca2+ regulation of the Ca2+-sensitive anion conductance via CaCC is compartmentalized in both cystic fibrosis and normal airway epithelia with basolaterally released Ca2+ failing to activate CaCC in both epithelia (34Paradiso A.M. Ribeiro C.M. Boucher R.C. J. Gen. Physiol. 2001; 117: 53-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). However, it is equally possible that ATP causes a localized release of Ca2+ from the same Ca2+store. Further experiments have to be conducted to clarify this point. Nonetheless, the basolateral ATP-releasable Ca2+ pool was not accessible by apical P2Y receptor stimulation. Pretreating the epithelia with Tg under Ca2+-free condition also fails to affect the mobilization of Ca2+ by basolateral ATP. 2C. H.-Y. Wong and W.-h. Ko, unpublished data. In pancreatic and salivary gland cells, the internal Ca2+ pool is highly compartmentalized and that compartmentalization is achieved in part by polarized expression of Ca2+ channels (35Lee M.G. Xu X. Zeng W. Diaz J. Wojcikiewicz R.J. Kuo T.H. Wuytack F. Racymaekers L. Muallem S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 15765-15770Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar). On the contrary, it has been demonstrated that the endoplasmic reticulum acts as one continuous Ca2+ pool in pancreatic acinar cells, and Ca2+ released from the apical endoplasmic reticulum terminals is quickly replenished from the bulk of the rough endoplasmic reticulum at the base (36Park M.K. Petersen O.H. Tepikin A.V. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 5729-5739Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar, 37Petersen O.H. Tepikin A. Park M.K. Trends Neurosci. 2001; 24: 271-276Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar).Another possibility to explain the inability of basolateral ATP to activate onion secretion is that Ca2+ may not be the “ultimate” signaling molecule that is solely responsible for the activation of Cl− channels. Once the P2Y receptor is stimulated by ATP, it will activate phospholipase C to breakdown phosphatidylinositol bisphosphate into IP3 and diacylglycerol. Therefore, other potential signaling molecules such as diacylglycerol or protein kinase C along the phospholipase C pathway may also be involved in the stimulation of CaCC. Basolateral ATP, in contrast, may not be able to generate the signaling molecule(s) (or the concentration is too low) required for channel activation. Finally, basolateral ATP may activate an unidentified inhibitory pathway that suppresses Cl− secretion. It is important to undertake further experiments to establish the mechanism of this differential effect as it may be an important component of a poorly understood mechanism that permit ion transport.In polarized human nasal epithelia, it has been demonstrated that extracellular ATP stimulated a membrane-restricted regulation of Ca2+ release and influx (38Paradiso A.M. Mason S.J. Zazarowski E.R. Boucher R.C. Nature. 1995; 377: 643-646Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Ca2+ influx of similar magnitude was demonstrated on both sides of the epithelium. The activation of plasma membrane Ca2+ influx by ATP was confined to the membrane ipsilateral to receptor stimulation. This finding demonstrates that the regulation of CCE could be a membrane-restricted phenomenon. Both internal Ca2+ release and activation of the Ca2+ influx pathway were confined to the membrane of receptor activation. In contrast, although the ATP-activated Ca2+ release is membrane-restricted in equine sweat gland epithelia, Ca2+ influx is not. Experiments in which the epithelia were stimulated with apical or basolateral ATP and external Ca2+ was removed and/or replaced confirmed that the nucleotide-evoked [Ca2+]i signals were initiated by the mobilization of cytoplasmic Ca2+ and followed by Ca2+ influx (i.e. CCE). Interestingly, although the receptors controlling Ca2+entry were on the apical or basolateral membrane, the Ca2+influx occurred primarily across the basolateral membrane. In further experiments, thapsigargin was used to deplete internal Ca2+stores, and similar results were obtained.As a result, in the equine sweat gland epithelia, the store-operated Ca2+ entry pathway is primarily located in the basolateral membrane and can be activated by apical and basolateral ATP or by receptor-independent depletion of intracellular Ca2+ stores with thapsigargin. It is interesting that similar results were also found in polarized MDCK-C7 cells in which the Ca2+ influx, which could be activated by extracellular ATP or thapsigargin, was exclusively located in the basolateral membrane (39Gordjani N. Nitschke R. Greger R. Leipziger J. Cell Calcium. 1997; 22: 121-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Recently, it has been suggested that the localization of CCE in the basolateral membrane is a more general characteristic of all polarized epithelial tissues. For example, recent data from human colonic T84, bronchial epithelial cells 16HBE14− (40Kerstan D. Thomas J. Nitschke R. Leipziger J. Cell Calcium. 1999; 26: 253-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar), and human airway epithelial Calu-3 cells (41Ito Y. Son M. Kume H. Yamaki K. Toxicol. Appl. Pharmacol. 2001; 176: 101-109Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar) also support the finding that CCE entry pathway in polarized epithelial cells may be confined to the basolateral side. How does the activation of apical P2Y receptors induce a CCE located in the contralateral membrane? There are two leading hypotheses about the activation of CCE, namely “diffusible messenger” and “conformational coupling” (23Berridge M.J. Biochem. J. 1995; 312: 1-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (1045) Google Scholar, 24Parekh A.B. Penner R. Physiol. Rev. 1997; 77: 901-930Crossref PubMed Scopus (1285) Google Scholar, 25Putney Jr., J.W. Ribeiro C.M. Cell Mol. Life Sci. 2000; 57: 1272-1286Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). According to the former hypothesis, the CCE could be activated by a diffusible messenger, the so called “calcium influx factor” (42Randriamampita C. Tsien R.Y. Nature. 1993; 364: 809-814Crossref PubMed Scopus (785) Google Scholar), that is generated by the emptying of apical or basolateral ATP-releasable calcium pools. Alternatively, both apical or basolateral receptor-activated Ca2+ pools have to be in direct contact with the neighboring basolateral membrane in which the Ca2+ influx channels are located. Recent findings strongly suggest that the control of CCE involves the interaction between IP3receptors in the internal stores and one of the candidates for plasma membrane calcium channels, the hTrp3 (human transient receptor potential 3) protein (43Kiselyov K. Xu X. Mozhayeva G. Kuo T. Pessah I. Mignery G. Zhu X. Birnbaumer L. Muallem S. Nature. 1998; 396: 478-482Crossref PubMed Scopus (558) Google Scholar, 44Kiselyov K. Mignery G.A. Zhu M.X. Muallem S.

A. 2001; 98: 11777-11782Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar).In summary, this study indicates that P2Y receptor, calcium signals, and activation of Cl− channels are compartmentalized in the apical membrane domain. Recent studies also show a “membrane-delimited” cAMP signaling in the apical membrane of airway epithelial cells (47Huang P. Lazarowski E.R. Tarran R. Milgram S.L. Boucher R.C. Stutts M.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 14120-14125Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar) and regulation of Na+-H+ exchanger isoforms by P2 receptors in the rat submandibular gland duct (48Lee M.G. Schultheis P.J. Yan M. Shull G.E. Bookstein C. Chang E. Tse M. Donowitz M. Park K. Muallem S. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1998; 513: 341-357Crossref Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Therefore, without a global activation of intracellular signaling pathway(s), selective activation of apical P2Y receptors could lead to fluid and electrolyte secretion. This may be useful and important as a global increase in Ca2+ (or other cellular messengers) is detrimental and affects many other cellular functions. Extracellular nucleotides such as ATP and UTP have been documented in a large number of cell types to elicit a variety of biological responses through binding to specific membrane receptors termed P2Y receptors (1Dubyak G.R. El-Moatassim C. Am. J. Physiol. 1993; 265: C577-C606Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 2Ralevic V. Burnstock G. Pharmacol. Rev. 1998; 50: 413-492PubMed Google Scholar). P2Y receptor stimulation results in the activation of Ca2+-dependent Cl− secretion in various types of epithelia, such as human airway epithelia (3Mason S.J. Paradiso A.M. Boucher R.C. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1991; 103: 1649-1656Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar), rat sertoli cells (4Ko W.H. Chan H.C. Chew S.B. Wong P.Y. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1998; 512: 471-480Crossref Scopus (24) Google Scholar), mouse cortical-collecting duct cells (5Thomas J. Deetjen P. Ko W.H. Jacobi C. Leipziger J. J. Membr. Biol. 2001; 183: 115-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar), and both human and equine sweat gland epithelia (6Bovell D.L. Clunes M.T. Elder H.Y. Wong H.Y. Ko W.H. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 2000; 403: 45-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar, 7Ko W.H. Wilson S.M. Wong P.Y.D. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1997; 121: 150-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). In many cases, the P2Y receptors are located on the apical membranes. It has been proposed that ATP and possibly other nucleotides may be released across the apical membrane of stimulated epithelia (8Homolya L. Steinberg T.H. Boucher R.C. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 150: 1349-1360Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar, 9Reisin I.L. Pratt A.G. Abraham E.H. Amarat J.F. Gregory R.J. Ausiello D.A. Cantiello H.F. J. Biol.

Physiol. 1998; 275: C1391-C1406Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The released nucleotides activate the P2Y receptors either in the membranes of the nucleotide-releasing cell itself or of adjacent cells. Therefore, it is possible that these apical P2Y receptors may act as autocrine and/or paracrine regulators of epithelial transport (11Parr C.E. Sullivan D.M. Paradiso A.M. Lazarowski E.R. Birch L.H. Olsen J.C. Erb L. Weisman G.A. Boucher R.C. Turner J.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 3275-3279Crossref PubMed Scopus (356) Google Scholar, 12Schwiebert E.M. Egan M.E. Hwang T.H. Fulmer S.B. Allen S.S. Cutting G.R. Guggino W.B. Cell. 1995; 81: 1063-1073Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (593) Google Scholar). There is, however, a paucity of information on the mechanisms of stimulus-secretion coupling in polarized epithelia that expressed both apical and basolateral P2Y receptors. It is now emerging that certain types of P2Y receptor (e.g. P2Y2) are coupled to multiple signal transduction pathways in which changes in [Ca2+]i is not obligatory (13;14). More importantly, the functional expression of at least some P2Y receptor subtypes appears to be a feature of the polarized phenotype. These receptors may not be detected in isolated non-polarized cells that have been grown on glass coverslips. Therefore, simply using the methods traditionally applied to single cells (e.g.microspectrofluorimetry, patch clamping) may fail to reveal how extracellular nucleotides regulate anion secretion in polarized epithelia. In this study, a technique that allows us to monitor nucleotide-evoked short-circuit current (I SC)1 and [Ca2+]i concurrently in a polarized epithelium was employed. The Ca2+-mediated Cl− secretion activated by various nucleotides was explored in an equine sweat gland epithelial cell line with emphasis on the polarized Ca2+mobilization and influx in response to apical versusbasolateral P2Y receptor stimulation. Previous studies have shown that the cultured cells will form polarized monolayer on permeable support (15Ko W.H. Chan H.C. Chew S.B.C. Wong P.Y.D. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1996; 493: 885-894Crossref Scopus (12) Google Scholar) and express both apical purine and pyrimidine receptors (7Ko W.H. Wilson S.M. Wong P.Y.D. Br. J.

(Lond.). 1996; 497: 19-29Crossref Scopus (24) Google Scholar). DISCUSSIONAs in other epithelia, P2Y receptors expressed in equine sweat gland epithelia are linked through G proteins to phospholipase C, resulting in the generation of IP3 and hence the mobilization of Ca2+ from internal stores (22Ko W.H. O'Dowd J.J.M. Pediani J.D. Elder H.Y. Bovell D.L. Jenkinson D.M. Wilson S.M. J. Exp. Biol. 1994; 190: 239-252PubMed Google Scholar). The emptying of internal stores activates a persistent Ca2+influx through plasma membrane (17Ko W.H. Chan H.C. Wong P.Y. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1996; 497: 19-29Crossref Scopus (24) Google Scholar). This type of Ca2+influx has been termed “capacitative Ca2+ entry” or more recently “store-operated Ca2+ entry” (23Berridge M.J. Biochem. J. 1995; 312: 1-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (1045) Google Scholar, 24Parekh A.B. Penner R. Physiol. Rev. 1997; 77: 901-930Crossref PubMed Scopus (1285) Google Scholar, 25Putney Jr., J.W. Ribeiro C.M.

Previous studies have identified the functional expression of apical purinoceptors (P2Y2) and pyrimidinoceoptors (P2Y4 and/or P2Y6) when the cells are grown on permeable supports. P2X receptors are not involved in mediating the nucleotide responses (16Wilson S.M. Law V.W. Pediani J.D. Allen E.A. Wilson G. Khan Z.E. Ko W.H. Br. J.

https://openalex.org/W2072201362,"Estrogen receptor-α (ERα) can induce the expression of genes in response to estrogen by binding to estrogen response elements in the promoters of target genes. There is growing evidence that ERα can alter patterns of gene expression in response to ligand by regulating the activity of other factors through a direct protein-protein interaction. To identify other factors that are regulated by ERα, a yeast two-hybrid screen was performed that identified a novel Cys2His2 zinc finger protein named ZER6. The ZER6 protein contains a Kruppel-associated box domain and six Cys2His2 zinc fingers. Transcripts from theZER6 gene can have alternate 5′ exons and encode either a p71 or p52 isoform. The p52-ZER6 protein interacts strongly with ERα in the presence of 17β-estradiol, whereas the p71-ZER6 isoform has a HUB-1 amino-terminal domain that inhibits the interaction with ERα. A consensus ZER6 binding element was defined using PCR-assisted binding site selection. In COS-1 cells, both the p52 and p71 isoforms can activate transcription through the ZER6 binding element; however, in the presence of ERα, transactivation by the p52 isoform is specifically repressed. Overexpression of the p52 isoform was able to abrogate activation by p71-ZER6. Expression of ZER6 was largely restricted to the mammary gland with a lower level of expression in the kidney. We conclude that ZER6 is a novel zinc finger transcription factor in which regulation of transcription in hormone-responsive cells can be controlled by the relative level of expression of two distinct isoforms.

These nuclear receptors are members of the steroid-thyroid-retinoic acid superfamily of transcription factors (5Mangelsdorf D.J. Thummel C. Beato M. Herrlich P. Schütz G. Umesono K. Blumberg B.

Annu. Rev. Genet. 1991; 25: 89-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar). This mechanism of transactivation by ERα induces the expression of a set of target genes in hormone-responsive tissues and tumors.

The promoters of these genes are directly activated by ERα, and induction of target gene expression is dependent upon the ability of ERα to bind to DNA.Over the past several years, data have been accumulating demonstrating that ERα can alter the expression of genes independent of direct DNA binding. One mechanism that has been proposed is through the ability of ERα to regulate the activity of other nuclear transcription factors by mechanisms involving direct protein-protein interactions. In many cases the interactions between ERα and other nuclear factors have been shown to be ligand-dependent. One example of this alternate mechanism of gene regulation is the effect of ERα on expression of genes regulated by AP1(13). ERα and ERβ have been shown to interact with AP1 with differential ligand activation. In experiments in HeLa cells, ERα stimulated an AP1 reporter plasmid in the presence of estrogen or anti-estrogens. However, ERβ demonstrated activation of transcription mediated by AP1 only in the presence of anti-estrogens. In another report, ligand-activated ERα was shown to repress transactivation by members of the pro-apoptotic forkhead transcription factor family related to FKHR (14Schuur E.R. Loktev A.V. Sharma M. Sun Z. Roth R.A. Weigel R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 33554-33560Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). In ERα-positive MCF7 cells, alterations in cell cycle induced by FKHRL1 were abrogated by estradiol. Another study found that steroid receptors could regulate cell cycle and apoptosis through a small fraction of receptors that may be present in the cell membrane (15Kousteni S. Bellido T. Plotkin L.I. O'Brien C.A. Bodenner D.L. Han L. Han K. DiGregorio G.B. Katzenellenbogen J.A. Katzenellenbogen B.S. Roberson P.K. Weinstein R.S. Jilka R.L. Manolagas S.C. Cell. 2001; 104: 719-730Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In this model of regulation, ligand-activated ERα, ERβ, or androgen receptor were able to attenuate apoptosis through activation of the Src/Shc/extracellular signal-regulated kinase pathway. These studies indicate that ERα can modulate the expression of genes controlled by transcription factors that are not thought to be influenced by steroid hormones. Through direct protein-protein interactions, ERα has the potential of altering the function of a wide range of nuclear factors.Understanding the mechanisms through which ERα regulates gene expression is an important step toward developing new therapies for diseases of hormone-responsive tissues. Using a yeast two-hybrid screen, we have identified additional proteins that interact with ligand-activated ERα. One of these genes was found to be a novel Cys2His2 zinc finger protein called ZER6, which has a Kruppel-associated box (KRAB) domain and six zinc finger motifs. Transcripts from the ZER6 gene have alternative 5′ exons, which encode two related isoforms: p71-ZER6 and p52-ZER6. The p71 isoform contains a HUB-1 domain, which was previously identified to be important for repression of long terminal repeat-mediated transactivation (16Okumura K. Sakaguchi G. Naito K. Tamura T. Igarashi H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 5025-5032Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). The p52 isoform of ZER6 interacts strongly with ERα in the presence of 17β-estradiol, whereas the p71 isoform demonstrated no binding to ERα. PCR-assisted binding site selection was used to define a consensus ZER6 binding element (ZBE). Although both isoforms were able to transactivate through the ZBE, activation by p52-ZER6 was repressed in cells expressing ERα. In ERα-positive cells, overexpression of the p52 isoform was able to abrogate activation by p71-ZER6. The pattern of expression of ZER6 was analyzed by hybridization to an array of RNA from different human tissues. The expression of ZER6 was largely restricted to the mammary gland with lower levels of expression also noted in the kidney. We conclude that ZER6 is a novel mammary-specific zinc finger transcription factor with two isoforms, one of which is repressed through a direct interaction with ERα.DISCUSSIONIn the presence of estrogen, ERα forms a homodimer that is able to activate transcription by binding to estrogen response elements in the promoters of target genes (6Gronemeyer H. Annu. Rev. Genet. 1991; 25: 89-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar). The specific transcriptional response to ERα ligands varies with the cell line and is dependent upon the repertoire of ERα cofactors or corepressors expressed in the cell (21Onate S.A. Tsai S.Y. Tsai M.J. O'Malley B.W. Science. 1995; 270: 1354-1357Crossref PubMed Scopus (2042) Google Scholar, 22Smith C.L. Onate S.A. Tsai M.J. O'Malley B.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 8884-8888Crossref PubMed Scopus (368) Google Scholar, 23Shibata H. Spencer T.E. Onate S.A. Jenster G. Tsai S.Y. Tsai M.J. O'Malley B.W. Recent Prog. Horm. Res. 1997; 52: 141-164PubMed Google Scholar). Over the last several years, it has become clear that ERα can have effects on gene expression independent of the DNA binding function of the receptor. This alternate pathway of gene regulation is dependent upon the ability of ERα to affect the function of other nuclear factors through direct protein-protein interactions. In this report, we described a novel Cys2His2 zinc finger protein, ZER6, with two isoforms (p71-ZER6 and p52-ZER6), which demonstrate differential ligand-dependent interaction with ERα. Although both isoforms were able to activate transcription through a ZBE, transactivation by p52-ZER6 was repressed in the presence of ERα. Hence, in hormone-responsive cells, regulation of transcription by ZER6 can be controlled by the relative level of expression of the two isoforms.The Cys2His2 zinc finger is one of the most common motifs found in eukaryotic DNA-binding proteins (24Laity J.H. Lee B.M. Wright P.E. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2001; 11: 39-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (1041) Google Scholar). Zinc finger proteins containing four or more finger domains are usually able to form stable, sequence-specific DNA interactions (25Wolfe S.A. Nekludova L. Pabo C.O. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biomol. Struct. 2000; 29: 183-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (767) Google Scholar, 26Desjarlais J.R. Berg J.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 11099-11103Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). ZER6 contains six complete Cys2His2 zinc finger domains, and it would be expected that the protein would be able to bind DNA with a core motif of 15–18 nucleotides (27Klug A. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 293: 215-218Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). The amino acids at positions −1, 2, 3, and 6 of the α-helix in each finger are most critical in determining the sequence specificity of the DNA binding motif (25Wolfe S.A. Nekludova L. Pabo C.O. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biomol. Struct. 2000; 29: 183-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (767) Google Scholar). The residues at −1, 3, and 6 are positioned to make contact with the primary DNA strand, whereas the residue at position 2 contacts the complimentary strand. Neighboring finger domains coordinately interact with the DNA sequence with each finger making contact with 3 nucleotides of the primary DNA strand. This arrangement offers the possibility of designing zinc finger proteins with defined DNA sequence specificity (27Klug A. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 293: 215-218Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar, 28Nagaoka M. Sugiura Y. J. Inorg. Biochem. 2000; 82: 57-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 29Imanishi M. Hori Y. Nagaoka M. Sugiura Y. Eur. J. Pharmacol. Sci. 2001; 13: 91-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Although the data are not yet available to make precise predictions, some amino acid residues have been defined to have preferences for specific nucleotides. In the case of ZER6, the α helix of fingers F3 through F5 will create a binding pocket with the residues RREHNR at positions 6, −1, 2, 3, 6, and −1. This arrangement of residues at these key locations is very similar to the α helix structure created by fingers 1–3 of Zif268 with the sequence RRDHTR (25Wolfe S.A. Nekludova L. Pabo C.O. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biomol. Struct. 2000; 29: 183-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (767) Google Scholar). The glutamic acid residue at position 2 in ZER6 is very similar to aspartic acid residue in Zif268. Based on the similarity in this region, one might expect this region of ZER6 to have DNA specificity similar to that of the analogous region of Zif268. This region of Zif268 binds the core motif 5′-GTGGG, and this sequence motif is indeed found in the ZBE identified by PCR-assisted binding site selection. Although the α helix structure of the other ZER6 fingers suggests a GC-rich binding site, data to allow a prediction of DNA interactions for the other fingers of ZER6 are incomplete. Combining the structural information of this novel zinc finger protein with the DNA binding specificity will provide additional information to help develop a robust model of zinc finger-DNA interactions.A search for the ZER6 binding element was performed in the eukaryotic promoter data base (www.epd.isb-sib.ch/), which contains promoter sequence information on 1390 eukaryotic promoters from −499 to +100 relative to the gene cap site. The promoter region of three genes (serum albumin, histocompatibility antigen-γ, and an early embryonic gene called H19) contained an exact match for the sequence 5′-GGGTGGGGGTGGG. Because there is likely to be some degeneracy in sequence specificity, a search was performed with less stringency with a particular interest in genes known to be expressed in the breast or kidney. The insulin-like growth factor II (IGF-II) gene from human and rat contains multiple copies of sequences closely related to the ZBE, with the closest match being 5′-GGGTGGGGGTAGGG-3′. This finding is interesting because tamoxifen has been shown to stimulate expression from the IGF-II promoter (30Roy R.N. Gerulath A.H. Cecutti A. Bhavnani B.R. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 2000; 165: 173-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). If the IGF-II promoter was targeted by ZER-6, it is conceivable that the ERα-ZER6 interaction might be disrupted by tamoxifen thereby releasing active p52-ZER6. The mouse renin-1 gene promoter was found to contain the sequence 5′-CTGGGGGTGGAG-3′. Renin is synthesized in the renal juxtaglomerular apparatus, and these data are consistent with the possibility that renin expression is regulated by ZER6. It is not known if the expression of these other potential ZER6 target genes is altered by estrogen.A BLASTp analysis of the ZER6 proteins identified a domain in the amino-terminal region, which was partially contained in p52-ZER6, with homology to the KRAB domains (31Dang D.T. Pevsner J. Yang V.W. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 2000; 32: 1103-1121Crossref PubMed Scopus (361) Google Scholar). The KRAB domains are common features of many zinc finger proteins and are associated with transcriptional regulation. The region of p71-ZER6 that is not contained in the p52 isoform demonstrated a region of striking homology with HUB-1(16). Over a region of 139 amino acids (from amino acid 33 to 171), there is 74% identity and 84% homology with the HUB-1 repressor domain. The HUB-1 gene was cloned based on the ability for the protein to bind to the U5RE of human T-cell lymphotrophic virus type I. HUB-1 is a zinc finger protein with five finger domains that was shown to repress long terminal repeat-mediated transactivation. We hypothesize that the HUB-1 domain is involved in orchestrating protein-protein interactions involved in generating transcriptional complexes. In the case of ZER6, this domain inhibited the ability of ZER6 to interact with ERα, which allowed the p71 isoform to escape repression in hormone responsive cells. To date, HUB-1 and ZER6 are the only two proteins with this motif and as more data are accumulated, this domain may define a subset of KRAB-related zinc finger proteins.Alternate splicing of the 5′ end of ZER6 transcripts is one mechanism that can regulate expression of the p52 and p71 isoforms. The structure of the majority of transcripts obtained by 5′-RACE using RNA from MCF7 cells would encode the p52 isoform. This conclusion is supported by the fact that several of the clones contained the entire open reading frame and the most amino-terminal methionine residue in those clones correspond to initiation of p52-ZER6. Only 1 of the 14 5′-RACE clones encoded the p71-ZER6 isoform, which indicates that mRNAs with this structure are in the minority. Although transcripts encoding the p71 isoform may arise from alternate splicing, initiation by an alternative promoter is a distinct possibility. An alternate ZER6promoter transcribing an mRNA that encodes p71-ZER6 would provide an additional mechanism to control the ratio of the p71 and p52 isoforms. Clearly, the two isoforms have different mechanisms controlling ZER6-mediated transactivation. The implications of the transcriptional data derived from reporter assays indicate that the p52 isoform is repressed by ERα. In addition, overexpression of p52 can have a dominant-negative effect that can repress transactivation by the p71 isoform (see Fig. 9 D). One potential mechanism for the dominant-negative effect might be competitive binding of the ZBE in target genes. Alternatively, the two isoforms may compete for a limiting co-activator. Identification of ZER6 target genes and mechanisms of regulating activation and repression by the two isoforms will be important areas for further investigation. Two human estrogen receptors (ERs)1 have been identified: ERα and ERβ (1Green S. Walter P. Kumar V. Krust A. Bornert J.M. Argos P. Chambon P.

These nuclear receptors are members of the steroid-thyroid-retinoic acid superfamily of transcription factors (5Mangelsdorf D.J. Thummel C. Beato M. Herrlich P. Schütz G. Umesono K. Blumberg B. Kastner P. Mark M. Chambon P. Evans R.M. Cell. 1995; 83: 835-839Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (6028) Google Scholar). In the classic model of transactivation by the receptor, ligand-activated ERα forms a homodimer, which is able to bind specific DNA regulatory sequences in the promoters of ERα target genes called estrogen response elements (6Gronemeyer H. Annu. Rev. Genet. 1991; 25: 89-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar). This mechanism of transactivation by ERα induces the expression of a set of target genes in hormone-responsive tissues and tumors. Several ERα target genes have been described in hormone-responsive breast tumors including progesterone receptor (7Kastner P. Krust A. Turcotte B. Stropp U. Tora L. Gronemeyer H. Chambon P.

The promoters of these genes are directly activated by ERα, and induction of target gene expression is dependent upon the ability of ERα to bind to DNA. Over the past several years, data have been accumulating demonstrating that ERα can alter the expression of genes independent of direct DNA binding. One mechanism that has been proposed is through the ability of ERα to regulate the activity of other nuclear transcription factors by mechanisms involving direct protein-protein interactions. In many cases the interactions between ERα and other nuclear factors have been shown to be ligand-dependent. One example of this alternate mechanism of gene regulation is the effect of ERα on expression of genes regulated by AP1(13). ERα and ERβ have been shown to interact with AP1 with differential ligand activation. In experiments in HeLa cells, ERα stimulated an AP1 reporter plasmid in the presence of estrogen or anti-estrogens. However, ERβ demonstrated activation of transcription mediated by AP1 only in the presence of anti-estrogens. In another report, ligand-activated ERα was shown to repress transactivation by members of the pro-apoptotic forkhead transcription factor family related to FKHR (14Schuur E.R. Loktev A.V. Sharma M.

Zinc finger proteins containing four or more finger domains are usually able to form stable, sequence-specific DNA interactions (25Wolfe S.A. Nekludova L. Pabo C.O. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biomol.

In the presence of estrogen, ERα forms a homodimer that is able to activate transcription by binding to estrogen response elements in the promoters of target genes (6Gronemeyer H. Annu. Rev. Genet. 1991; 25: 89-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar). The specific transcriptional response to ERα ligands varies with the cell line and is dependent upon the repertoire of ERα cofactors or corepressors expressed in the cell (21Onate S.A. Tsai S.Y. Tsai M.J. O'Malley B.W. Science. 1995; 270: 1354-1357Crossref PubMed Scopus (2042) Google Scholar, 22Smith C.L. Onate S.A. Tsai M.J. O'Malley B.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 8884-8888Crossref PubMed Scopus (368) Google Scholar, 23Shibata H. Spencer T.E. Onate S.A. Jenster G. Tsai S.Y. Tsai M.J. O'Malley B.W. Recent Prog. Horm. Res. 1997; 52: 141-164PubMed Google Scholar). Over the last several years, it has become clear that ERα can have effects on gene expression independent of the DNA binding function of the receptor. This alternate pathway of gene regulation is dependent upon the ability of ERα to affect the function of other nuclear factors through direct protein-protein interactions. In this report, we described a novel Cys2His2 zinc finger protein, ZER6, with two isoforms (p71-ZER6 and p52-ZER6), which demonstrate differential ligand-dependent interaction with ERα. Although both isoforms were able to activate transcription through a ZBE, transactivation by p52-ZER6 was repressed in the presence of ERα. Hence, in hormone-responsive cells, regulation of transcription by ZER6 can be controlled by the relative level of expression of the two isoforms. The Cys2His2 zinc finger is one of the most common motifs found in eukaryotic DNA-binding proteins (24Laity J.H. Lee B.M. Wright P.E. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2001; 11: 39-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (1041) Google Scholar). Zinc finger proteins containing four or more finger domains are usually able to form stable, sequence-specific DNA interactions (25Wolfe S.A. Nekludova L. Pabo C.O. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biomol. Struct. 2000; 29: 183-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (767) Google Scholar, 26Desjarlais J.R. Berg J.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 11099-11103Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). ZER6 contains six complete Cys2His2 zinc finger domains, and it would be expected that the protein would be able to bind DNA with a core motif of 15–18 nucleotides (27Klug A. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 293: 215-218Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). The amino acids at positions −1, 2, 3, and 6 of the α-helix in each finger are most critical in determining the sequence specificity of the DNA binding motif (25Wolfe S.A. Nekludova L. Pabo C.O. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biomol. Struct. 2000; 29: 183-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (767) Google Scholar). The residues at −1, 3, and 6 are positioned to make contact with the primary DNA strand, whereas the residue at position 2 contacts the complimentary strand. Neighboring finger domains coordinately interact with the DNA sequence with each finger making contact with 3 nucleotides of the primary DNA strand. This arrangement offers the possibility of designing zinc finger proteins with defined DNA sequence specificity (27Klug A. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 293: 215-218Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar, 28Nagaoka M. Sugiura Y. J. Inorg. Biochem. 2000; 82: 57-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 29Imanishi M. Hori Y. Nagaoka M. Sugiura Y. Eur. J. Pharmacol. Sci. 2001; 13: 91-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Although the data are not yet available to make precise predictions, some amino acid residues have been defined to have preferences for specific nucleotides. In the case of ZER6, the α helix of fingers F3 through F5 will create a binding pocket with the residues RREHNR at positions 6, −1, 2, 3, 6, and −1. This arrangement of residues at these key locations is very similar to the α helix structure created by fingers 1–3 of Zif268 with the sequence RRDHTR (25Wolfe S.A. Nekludova L. Pabo C.O. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biomol. Struct. 2000; 29: 183-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (767) Google Scholar). The glutamic acid residue at position 2 in ZER6 is very similar to aspartic acid residue in Zif268. Based on the similarity in this region, one might expect this region of ZER6 to have DNA specificity similar to that of the analogous region of Zif268. This region of Zif268 binds the core motif 5′-GTGGG, and this sequence motif is indeed found in the ZBE identified by PCR-assisted binding site selection. Although the α helix structure of the other ZER6 fingers suggests a GC-rich binding site, data to allow a prediction of DNA interactions for the other fingers of ZER6 are incomplete. Combining the structural information of this novel zinc finger protein with the DNA binding specificity will provide additional information to help develop a robust model of zinc finger-DNA interactions. A search for the ZER6 binding element was performed in the eukaryotic promoter data base (www.epd.isb-sib.ch/), which contains promoter sequence information on 1390 eukaryotic promoters from −499 to +100 relative to the gene cap site. The promoter region of three genes (serum albumin, histocompatibility antigen-γ, and an early embryonic gene called H19) contained an exact match for the sequence 5′-GGGTGGGGGTGGG. Because there is likely to be some degeneracy in sequence specificity, a search was performed with less stringency with a particular interest in genes known to be expressed in the breast or kidney. The insulin-like growth factor II (IGF-II) gene from human and rat contains multiple copies of sequences closely related to the ZBE, with the closest match being 5′-GGGTGGGGGTAGGG-3′. This finding is interesting because tamoxifen has been shown to stimulate expression from the IGF-II promoter (30Roy R.N. Gerulath A.H. Cecutti A. Bhavnani B.R. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 2000; 165: 173-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). If the IGF-II promoter was targeted by ZER-6, it is conceivable that the ERα-ZER6 interaction might be disrupted by tamoxifen thereby releasing active p52-ZER6. The mouse renin-1 gene promoter was found to contain the sequence 5′-CTGGGGGTGGAG-3′. Renin is synthesized in the renal juxtaglomerular apparatus, and these data are consistent with the possibility that renin expression is regulated by ZER6. It is not known if the expression of these other potential ZER6 target genes is altered by estrogen. A BLASTp analysis of the ZER6 proteins identified a domain in the amino-terminal region, which was partially contained in p52-ZER6, with homology to the KRAB domains (31Dang D.T. Pevsner J. Yang V.W. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 2000; 32: 1103-1121Crossref PubMed Scopus (361) Google Scholar). The KRAB domains are common features of many zinc finger proteins and are associated with transcriptional regulation. The region of p71-ZER6 that is not contained in the p52 isoform demonstrated a region of striking homology with HUB-1(16). Over a region of 139 amino acids (from amino acid 33 to 171), there is 74% identity and 84% homology with the HUB-1 repressor domain. The HUB-1 gene was cloned based on the ability for the protein to bind to the U5RE of human T-cell lymphotrophic virus type I. HUB-1 is a zinc finger protein with five finger domains that was shown to repress long terminal repeat-mediated transactivation. We hypothesize that the HUB-1 domain is involved in orchestrating protein-protein interactions involved in generating transcriptional complexes. In the case of ZER6, this domain inhibited the ability of ZER6 to interact with ERα, which allowed the p71 isoform to escape repression in hormone responsive cells. To date, HUB-1 and ZER6 are the only two proteins with this motif and as more data are accumulated, this domain may define a subset of KRAB-related zinc finger proteins. Alternate splicing of the 5′ end of ZER6 transcripts is one mechanism that can regulate expression of the p52 and p71 isoforms. The structure of the majority of transcripts obtained by 5′-RACE using RNA from MCF7 cells would encode the p52 isoform. This conclusion is supported by the fact that several of the clones contained the entire open reading frame and the most amino-terminal methionine residue in those clones correspond to initiation of p52-ZER6. Only 1 of the 14 5′-RACE clones encoded the p71-ZER6 isoform, which indicates that mRNAs with this structure are in the minority. Although transcripts encoding the p71 isoform may arise from alternate splicing, initiation by an alternative promoter is a distinct possibility. An alternate ZER6promoter transcribing an mRNA that encodes p71-ZER6 would provide an additional mechanism to control the ratio of the p71 and p52 isoforms. Clearly, the two isoforms have different mechanisms controlling ZER6-mediated transactivation. The implications of the transcriptional data derived from reporter assays indicate that the p52 isoform is repressed by ERα. In addition, overexpression of p52 can have a dominant-negative effect that can repress transactivation by the p71 isoform (see Fig. 9 D). One potential mechanism for the dominant-negative effect might be competitive binding of the ZBE in target genes. Alternatively, the two isoforms may compete for a limiting co-activator. Identification of ZER6 target genes and mechanisms of regulating activation and repression by the two isoforms will be important areas for further investigation."
