The activation of NF-κB protects cells against TNF-induced apoptosis. Heat-shock proteins (Hsps) are chaperone molecules that confer protein stability and help to restore protein native folding following heat shock and other stresses. The most abundant Hsp, Hsp90, is also involved in regulating the stability and function of a number of cell-signaling molecules. Here we report that RIP is a novel Hsp90-associated kinase and that disruption of Hsp90 function by its specific inhibitor, geldanamycin (GA), selectively causes RIP degradation and the subsequent inhibition of TNF-mediated IκB kinase and NF-κB activation. MG-132, a specific proteasome inhibitor, abrogated GA-induced degradation of RIP but failed to restore the activation of IκB kinase by TNF, perhaps because, in the presence of GA and MG-132, RIP accumulated in a detergent-insoluble subcellular fraction. Most importantly, the degradation of RIP sensitizes cells to TNF-induced apoptosis. These data indicate that Hsp90 plays an important role in TNF-mediated NF-κB activation by modulating the stability and solubility of RIP. Thus, inhibition of NF-κB activation by GA may be a critical component of the anti-tumor activity of this drug.

Trends Cell Biol. 1995; 5: 392-399Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (734) Google Scholar). Many of these TNF-mediated processes can be regulated by either one of the two TNF receptors TNFR1 and TNFR2, both of which belong to the TNF/nerve growth factor receptor superfamily (3.Nagata S.

However, apoptosis is mainly induced through TNFR1, and this receptor is also known as a death receptor because it contains a death domain (5.Tartaglia L.A. Goeddel D.V. Immunol.

TNF-induced activation of transcription factor NF-κB and c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) as well as induction of apoptosis are mediated through TNFR1. The distinct signal transduction pathways that regulate these three TNFR1-mediated responses have been elucidated recently (8.Hsu H. Xiong J. Goeddel D.V.

It is known that the binding of TNF to TNFR1 leads to the trimerization of TNFR1 and the recruitment of the TNFR1-associated death domain protein (TRADD) into the receptor complex (8.Hsu H. Xiong J. Goeddel D.V. Cell. 1995; 81: 495-504Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1734) Google Scholar). TRADD subsequently serves as a platform to recruit other proteins into the complex. At least three proteins, FAS-associated death domain protein (FADD/MORT1), TNFR-associated factor 2 (TRAF2), and the receptor interacting protein (RIP), have been shown to interact directly with TRADD (8.Hsu H.

While FADD/MORT1 is essential for TNF-induced apoptosis, the recruitment of RIP and TRAF2 are responsible for activation of NF-κB and JNK, respectively (11.Liu Z.G Hsu H. Goeddel D.V. Karin M.

The indispensable role of RIP in TNF-induced NF-κB activation was recently demonstrated in RIP−/− mice (17.Kelliher M.A Grimm S. Ishida Y. Kuo F. Stanger B.Z. Leder P. Immunity. 1998; 8: 297-303Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (914) Google Scholar). Consistent with an earlier finding that NF-κB activation protects cells from TNF-induced apoptosis, murine embryo fibroblast cells derived from RIP−/− mice are hypersensitive to apoptosis following TNF treatment (17.Kelliher M.A Grimm S. Ishida Y. Kuo F. Stanger B.Z. Leder P. Immunity. 1998; 8: 297-303Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (914) Google Scholar).Transcription factor NF-κB is composed of either homo- or heterodimers of Rel family members (23.Siebenlist U. Franzoso G. Brown K. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1994; 10: 405-455Crossref PubMed Scopus (2008) Google Scholar, 24.Baeuerle P.A. Baltimore D. Cell. 1996; 87: 13-20Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2917) Google Scholar). Inactive NF-κB is restricted to the cytoplasm because its interaction with inhibitory proteins termed IκBs masks its nuclear translocation signal (24.Baeuerle P.A. Baltimore D. Cell. 1996; 87: 13-20Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2917) Google Scholar). Following stimuli such as the proinflammatory cytokines TNF and interleukin-1, IκBs are phosphorylated by IκB kinase (IKK), resulting in their rapid, proteasome-dependent degradation. Recently, the IKK complex has been identified, and some subunits of this complex have been cloned (25.DiDonato J.A. Hayakawa M. Rothwarf D.M. Zandi E. Karin M. Nature. 1997; 388: 548-554Crossref PubMed Scopus (1896) Google Scholar, 26.Regnier C.H. Song H.Y. Gao X. Goeddel D.V. Cao Z. Rothe M.

The degradation of IκBs leads to the release of NF-κB and allows NF-κB to translocate into the nucleus where it transcriptionally activates its target genes. Besides being a pivotal mediator of immune and inflammatory responses, NF-κB activation protects cells from many types of apoptosis and promotes cell survival and transformation (11.Liu Z.G Hsu H.

Consistent with these observations, elevated NF-κB activity has been detected in several types of cancer (33.Mori N. Fujii M. Ikeda S. Yamada Y. Tomonaga M. Ballard D.W. Yamamoto N.

Nature. 1996; 381: 571-579Crossref PubMed Scopus (3089) Google Scholar). Hsp90 is one of the most abundant Hsps, and because it regulates stability and function of a unique complement of signal transduction proteins, this chaperone is involved in a variety of important biological processes including hormone signaling, cell cycle control, and development (37.Csermely P. Schnaider T. Soti C. Prohaszka Z. Nardai G. Pharmacol. Ther. 1998; 79: 129-168Crossref PubMed Scopus (890) Google Scholar, 38.Rutherford S.L. Lindquist S.

Cell. 1997; 89: 239-250Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1232) Google Scholar). GA-induced disruption of the interaction between Hsp90 and its client proteins, including the tyrosine kinase v-Src, the serine-threonine kinase Raf, mutant p53 proteins, and the glucocorticoid receptor, results in protein destabilization and degradation, usually mediated by the proteasome (37.Csermely P. Schnaider T. Soti C. Prohaszka Z. Nardai G. Pharmacol. Ther. 1998; 79: 129-168Crossref PubMed Scopus (890) Google Scholar, 40.Neckers L. Mimnaugh E. Schulte T.W. Handb. Exp. Pharmacol. 1999; 136: 9-42Crossref Google Scholar).Because certain TNF-mediated events have been reported to be sensitive to GA (45.White J.R. Lee J.C. Agents Actions. 1993; 39: 73-76Crossref Scopus (14) Google Scholar, 46.Gross V. Andus T. Daig R. Aschenbrenner E. Scholmerich J. Falk W. Gastroenterology. 1995; 108: 653-661Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar, 47.Ding S.-Z. Cho C.-H. Lam S.-K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 240: 561-565Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar), we investigated whether disruption of Hsp90 function by GA blocks TNF-induced NF-κB activation. We report here that the death domain kinase RIP interacts with Hsp90 and that this interaction is sensitive to GA. Interruption of Hsp90/RIP association destabilizes RIP and abolishes TNF-induced NF-κB activation without affecting other TNF mediated responses, thereby increasing cellular sensitivity to TNF-induced apoptosis.RESULTSTo test whether GA blocks TNF-induced NF-κB activation, HeLa cells were treated with GA for 14 h before treatment with TNF. Because phosphorylation-dependent degradation of IκBα is essential for NF-κB activation following TNF treatment, we first examined the protein level of IκBα by Western blotting. As shown in Fig. 1 A, in the absence of GA pretreatment, IκBα was degraded within 10 min of TNF addition and returned to its normal level after 1 h of treatment. In contrast, no TNF-stimulated decrease in IκBα level was detected if cells were previously treated with GA (Fig. 1 A). Treatment with GM, an analog of GA that does not inhibit Hsp90 function, had no effect on the ability of TNF to stimulate the degradation of IκBα (Fig.1 A). To confirm that the signaling pathway by which TNF induces NF-κB activation is blocked by GA, we also measured the activity of IKK by in vitro kinase assay using an exogenous GST-IκB peptide fragment as substrate (25.DiDonato J.A. Hayakawa M. Rothwarf D.M. Zandi E. Karin M. Nature. 1997; 388: 548-554Crossref PubMed Scopus (1896) Google Scholar). Consistent with the result in Fig. 1 A, GA treatment also abolished TNF-induced IKK activation because the phosphorylation of GST-IκB by IKK after TNF treatment was abolished (Fig. 1 B). To determine whether GA had any effect on other TNF-induced responses, we also performed anin vitro kinase assay to examine TNF-induced JNK activation after GA treatment (using an exogenous GST-c-Jun peptide as substrate). In contrast to IKK activation, TNF-induced JNK activation was unaffected by GA (Fig. 1 C). Similar observations were also made in HEK293 cells (data not shown). Finally, we monitored the effect of GA on TNF-induced NF-κB activation by studying cells transiently transfected with a NF-κB-responsive reporter plasmid. Although TNF treatment caused a 5-fold increase in reporter activity, pretreatment with GA abrogated this induction (Fig. 1 D, top panel). In contrast, TNF-induced c-Jun transcriptional activity is not affected by GA treatment (Fig. 1 D, bottom panel).Although many TNF-stimulated responses can be mediated by either TNFR1 or TNFR2, in HeLa and HEK293 cells the major functional TNF receptor is TNFR1. Several TNFR1 adaptor molecules have been identified as key components of TNF signaling pathways, especially the death domain kinase RIP and the TNF receptor-associated protein TRAF2, which are responsible for TNF-dependent activation of NF-κB and JNK, respectively (11.Liu Z.G Hsu H. Goeddel D.V. Karin M. Cell. 1996; 87: 565-576Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1778) Google Scholar, 17.Kelliher M.A Grimm S. Ishida Y. Kuo F. Stanger B.Z. Leder P.

To investigate which step within the signal transduction pathway of TNF-induced NF-κB activation is affected by GA, we examined the protein levels of TNFR1, TRAF2, and RIP after GA treatment (14 h). Although TNFR1 and TRAF2 protein levels remained essentially unchanged, RIP protein almost completely disappeared after GA treatment (Fig.2 A). The decrease of RIP level after GA treatment is not due to masking of the epitope recognized by the monoclonal anti-RIP antibody used for Western blot analysis because identical results were obtained with a polyclonal anti-RIP antibody (data not shown). The effect of GA on RIP was both dose- and time-dependent (Figs. 2, B and C, and4 A). Furthermore, the inhibition of IKK activity correlated with the decrease of RIP protein level following GA (Fig.2 C).Figure 2Geldanamycin treatment causes a dramatic decrease in endogenous RIP protein level in HeLa cells. A, HeLa cells were treated with 0.5 μm GA for 14 h and collected for sequential Western blotting with anti-RIP, anti-TRAF2, and anti-TNFR1 antibodies. Nontreated cells were used as a control.B, HeLa cells were treated with different concentrations of GA for 14 h and collected for Western blotting with anti-RIP antibody.C, HeLa cells were treated with 0.5 μm GA for the indicated time periods, followed by 5 min. of TNF treatment. For each sample, the IKK complex was immune-precipitated with anti-IKKβ antibody, and an in vitro kinase assay was performed as described in Fig. 1. IKKβ and RIP protein levels were measured in cell lysates by Western blot.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Because GA destabilizes several tyrosine and serine-threonine kinases including v-Src and the mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase Raf (41.Whitesell L.

Neckers L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 24585-24588Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (424) Google Scholar), we tested whether the decrease of RIP level in the presence of GA was due to RIP destabilization. HeLa cells were incubated with either GA or cycloheximide for 14 h (CHX; used as a control for general protein synthesis inhibition), and protein levels of RIP, TRAF2, and Myc were measured. As shown in Fig.3 A, whereas GA treatment decreased RIP level, CHX treatment had no effect, suggesting that GA-mediated RIP depletion was due to enhanced RIP instability. In contrast, although GA had no effect on Myc levels, CHX caused the disappearance of Myc protein, which is known to have a short half-life (Fig. 3 A). Neither GA nor CHX had any effect on TRAF2 (Fig.3 A). We also performed reverse transcription-PCR experiments with two RIP-specific primers to check RIP mRNA levels and found no difference before or after GA treatment (data not shown). These data suggested a specific effect of GA on RIP protein stability. To confirm the hypothesis that GA destabilizes RIP, we measured RIP protein half-life by [35S]methionine/[35S]cysteine pulse-chase analysis in the presence and absence of GA (Fig.3 B). Exposure of cells to GA clearly resulted in a markedly decreased RIP protein half-life. In control cells, a true half-life could not be determined, even when the chase period was extended to 8 h (data not shown), whereas in GA-treated cells the half-life of RIP protein was estimated to be 2.5 h.Figure 3Geldanamycin treatment shortens RIP protein half-life. A, HeLa cells were incubated with either 0.5 μm GA or 10 μg/ml CHX for 14 h, and RIP, TRAF2, and Myc protein levels were determined by Western blotting.B, RIP protein stability was determined in the presence and absence of GA by [35S]methionine pulse-chase analysis, as described under “Experimental Procedures.”View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)The kinases v-Src and Raf form a stable complex with Hsp90, and GA destabilizes v-Src and Raf proteins by interfering with Hsp90 function (41.Whitesell L.

Neckers L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 24585-24588Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (424) Google Scholar). To test whether RIP interacts with Hsp90 and to examine the possible effects of GA on this interaction, we immune-precipitated RIP and analyzed resultant blots for Hsp90 and Hsp90-associated co-chaperone proteins. Because we only detected a small decrease in RIP protein level 6 h after exposure to GA (Fig.4 A), we performed RIP immune-precipitation assays at 0, 2, and 6 h after GA treatment. As shown in Fig. 4 B (left panel), Hsp90 co-precipitated with RIP in untreated cells and GA-treated cells. As a control, anti-HA antibody was used to perform the immune-precipitation experiment with untreated cell extract, and no Hsp90 was pulled down (Fig. 4 B, right panel). Because GA disrupts Hsp90 function by preventing recruitment of the co-chaperone p23 into an Hsp90 complex while instead favoring Hsp90 association with Hsc70 (51.Johnson B.D. Schumacher R.J. Ross E.D. Toft D.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 3679-3686Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar), we examined whether such changes could be observed in the composition of RIP-Hsp90 complexes following GA treatment. By sequentially blotting the same membrane shown in Fig. 4 B (left panel) with anti-Hsc70 and anti-p23 monoclonal antibodies, we found that although the Hsc70 content of RIP immune-precipitates increased by 6 h after GA treatment, the presence of p23 in this complex dramatically decreased, despite comparable amounts of RIP precipitated in each assay. The total level of Hsp90, p23, and Hsc70 in these cell extracts remained unchanged (data not shown). These data support the hypothesis that GA alters the composition of Hsp90-containing multichaperone complexes associated with client proteins concurrent with the destabilization of these client proteins (39.Scheibel T.

To investigate whether the proteasome also mediated GA-stimulated RIP depletion, we examined the ability of several protease inhibitors to block RIP degradation in the presence of GA. In the first experiment, the specific proteasome inhibitor MG-132 was added to the culture medium 1 h before treating cells with GA. Cells were collected in Laemmli buffer, and whole cell lysate was used for Western blotting to determine RIP content. As shown in Fig.5 A, the presence of MG-132 antagonized GA-stimulated RIP degradation. As a control for MG-132 efficiency in this experiment, its effect on TNF-induced IκBα degradation was examined by Western blotting cell lysate with anti-IκBα antibody. MG-132 completely blocked TNF-stimulated degradation of IκBα (Fig. 5 B, right panel). Interestingly, when cells were collected in a buffer containing nonionic detergent and only a soluble protein extract was used for Western blotting, we failed to detect RIP recovery from GA treatment when MG-132 was added (Fig. 5 B, left panel). This suggested that RIP became insoluble when its interaction with Hsp90 was disrupted by GA. To confirm the insolubility of RIP in the presence of GA and the proteasome dependence of GA-stimulated RIP degradation, we examined RIP levels in a detergent-insoluble cell extract following treatment of cells with GA and a number of protease inhibitors (Fig.5 C). The proteasome inhibitorsN-acetyl-leu-leu-norleucinal, MG-132, and MG-115 all protected RIP from GA-stimulated degradation but caused the kinase to appear in the detergent-insoluble fraction, whereas three lysosome inhibitors, chloroquine (CQ), ammonium chloride, and bafilomycin as well as the caspase inhibitor benzyloxycarbonyl-Val-Ala-Asp (ZVAD) were unable to protect RIP from GA (Fig. 5 C). None of the protease inhibitors tested had any effect in themselves on either RIP levels or RIP solubility (Fig.5 C and data not shown).Figure 5Geldanamycin-stimulated RIP degradation is mediated by the proteasome. A, HeLa cells were treated with the proteasome inhibitor MG-132 (25 μm) 1 h before and during overnight treatment with 0.5 μm GA. Cells were collected in 60 μl Laemmli buffer and subjected to Western blotting analysis for RIP content. B, cells treated as inA were collected in TNESV buffer, and the presence of RIP protein in the detergent-soluble lysate fraction was monitored by Western blotting with anti-RIP antibody (left panel). In theright panel, cells were treated with 10 ng/ml TNFα for 20 min with/without pretreatment of 25 μm MG-132. The detergent-soluble lysate fraction was then analyzed for IκBα protein content by Western blotting with anti-IκBα antibody.C, in the left panel, HeLa cells were treated with the lysosome inhibitor bafilomycin (Bf, 0.1 μm) 1 h before and during overnight treatment with GA. Cells were collected in Laemmli buffer and processed for RIP determination as in A. In the right panel, HEK293 cells were exposed to several protease inhibitors for 1 h before addition of GA (1 μm), and cells were lysed in TNESV buffer 14 h after GA addition. Equal protein (50 μg) from Nonidet P-40-insoluble fractions was analyzed for RIP content. The final concentration and specificity of the protease inhibitors used was as follows: N-acetyl-leu-leu-norleucinal (LLnL, proteasome), 100 μm; chloroquine (CQ, lysosome), 200 μm; MG-132 and MG-115 (proteasome), 10 μm; NH4Cl (lysosome), 20 mm; benzyloxycarbonyl-Val-Ala-Asp (ZVAD) (caspase), 50 μm.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)These results indicate that GA inhibits TNF-induced NF-κB activation subsequent to the destabilization of RIP and stimulation of its proteasome-dependent degradation. Next, we asked whether prevention of RIP degradation by MG-132 was sufficient to restore TNF-induced NF-κB activation in the presence of GA. To address this question, we measured IKK activity following TNF treatment, since this kinase is downstream of RIP in the TNF-dependent signaling cascade leading to NF-κB activation. HA-IKKβ was transiently transfected into HeLa cells, and after exposure to different stimuli, cells were collected for examination of HA-IKKβ expression by Western bl"

This cytoskeletal reorganization results in an intense motogenic activity. Using porcine endothelial cells expressing one or the other type of the VEGF receptors, VEGFR1 or VEGFR2, or human umbilical vein endothelial cells pretreated with a VEGFR2 neutralizing antibody, we show that VEGFR2 is responsible for VEGF-induced activation of the stress-activated protein kinase-2/p38 (SAPK2/p38), phosphorylation of focal adhesion kinase (FAK), and enhanced migratory activity. Activation of SAPK2/p38 triggered actin polymerization whereas FAK, which was phosphorylated independently of SAPK2/p38, initiated assembly of focal adhesions. Both processes contributed to the formation of stress fibers. Geldanamycin, an inhibitor of HSP90 blocked tyrosine phosphorylation of FAK, assembly of focal adhesions, actin reorganization, and cell migration, all of which were reversed by overexpressing HSP90. We conclude that VEGFR2 mediates the physiological effect of VEGF on cell migration and that two independent pathways downstream of VEGFR2 regulate actin-based motility. One pathway involves SAPK2/p38 and leads to enhanced actin polymerization activity.

VEGF encompasses a family of structurally related proteins that includes placental-derived growth factor (PlGF), VEGF-A, VEGF-B, VEGF-C, VEGF-D, and VEGF-E. Human VEGF-A monomers exist as 5 different isoforms of which VEGF165 is the most abundant (1.Thomas K.A. J. Biol.

Within the human arterial wall, VEGF is produced by vascular smooth muscle cells upon activation by various stimuli including oxidative stress and angiotensin II, and it modulates endothelial cell functions via a paracrine pathway (3.Brogi E.

An autocrine loop involving the production of VEGF by endothelial cells is also activated under specific stressful conditions such as hypoxia (3.Brogi E. Wu T. Namiki A. Isner J.M.

VEGF is expressed and secreted by many tumors and it contributes to tumor expansion associated with neo-vascularization (7.Barleon B. Siemeister G. Martiny-Baron G. Weindel K. Herzog C. Marme D. Cancer. Res. 1997; 57: 5421-5425PubMed Google Scholar). VEGF exerts its effects after binding to two homologous membrane tyrosine kinase receptors, VEGFR1 (fms-like tyrosine kinase-1, also called flt-1) and VEGFR2 (kinase insert domain containing receptor/fetal liver kinase-1, also called KDR/Flk1) (8.Mustonen T.

Both receptors are composed of seven extracellular Ig-like domains containing the ligand-binding site, a single short transmembrane-spanning sequence, and an intracellular region containing the tyrosine kinase domain and the COOH-terminal tail (2.Tischer E.

VEGFR2 is considered as a positive regulator of endothelial cell proliferation whereas VEGFR1 is recognized as a negative regulator (11.Hiratsuka S. Minowa O. Kuno J. Noda T. Shibuya M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 9349-9354Crossref PubMed Scopus (884) Google Scholar). Both receptors are essential during mouse development since null homozygotes of VEGFR2 or VEGFR1 die at embryonic day 8.5–9 for VEGFR1 and day 8.5 for VEGFR2 (12.Fong G. Rossant J. Gertsenstein M.

Nature. 1995; 376: 62-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (3338) Google Scholar). Neuropilin-1, a co-receptor for VEGF, enhances the binding of VEGF to VEGFR2 in endothelial cells but is not directly involved in mediating the VEGF signal since it lacks a proper intracellular domain (14.Giraudo E. Primo L. Audero E. Gerber H.P. Koolwijk P. Soker S. Klagsbrun M. Ferrara N. Bussolino F. J. Biol.

Like other tyrosine kinase receptors, VEGFR2 and VEGFR1 undergo ligand-induced dimerization that activates their intrinsic tyrosine kinase activity. This results in autophosphorylation of the receptors on specific tyrosine residues followed by connection of the Tyr(P) residues to adapter and signaling proteins that contain Src homology domain 2 or PTB domains. The connection of the specific Tyr(P) residues to the adapter proteins constitutes an essential step in delivering the message to specific downstream signaling cascades. Y1213 and Y1169 on VEGFR1 bind, respectively, to the p85 subunit of phosphatidylinositol-3-phosphate kinase in yeast cells (16.Cunningham S.A. Waxham M.N. Arrate P.M. Brock T.A. J. Biol.

Shibuya M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 238: 487-491Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Expression of VEGFR2 in sinusoidal endothelial cells or NIH-3T3 cells results in the phosphorylation of phospholipase Cγ following its binding to the phosphorylated Y801 and Y1175 of the receptor (18.Cunningham S.A.

VEGF also activates ERK, SAPK2/p38, and JNK/SAPK1 MAP kinases, a group of protein kinases that transduce and orchestrate most signals originating from the cell environment into a vast array of cellular responses (19.Breier G.

The activation of ERK by VEGF has been shown to involve VEGFR2 in porcine aortic endothelial (PAE) cells, and Shc, Grb2, and Nck are presumably implicated in the process (24.Kroll J. Waltenberger J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 32521-32527Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (388) Google Scholar). VEGF also activates focal adhesion kinase (FAK) in endothelial cells and cardiomyocytes, an effect that appears to play a critical role in adhesive interactions between cells and extracellular matrix (25.Abedi H.

Members of the HSP90 family are abundant and constitutively expressed chaperones that play important roles in signal transduction by allowing signaling molecules to reach and maintain active conformational states. This includes the nuclear receptors for steroid hormones and many proteins that are associated with the plasma membrane such as members of the Src family, the MAP kinase kinase kinase Raf, the MAP kinase kinase MEK, and the βγ subunits of heterotrimeric G proteins (28.Xu Y. Lindquist S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 70-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 29.Pratt W.B. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol.

The in vivo functions of HSP90 require ATP binding and ATP hydrolysis by intrinsic ATPase activity (30.Obermann W.M. Sondermann H. Russo A.A. Pavletich N.P. Hartl F.U. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 901-910Crossref PubMed Scopus (489) Google Scholar). Inhibiting ATP binding with geldanamycin, an ansamycin derivative, or radicicol, a macrocytic anti-fungal agent, specifically suppresses the ATPase activity of HSP90 and disrupts its functions (30.Obermann W.M. Sondermann H. Russo A.A. Pavletich N.P. Hartl F.U. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 901-910Crossref PubMed Scopus (489) Google Scholar). In particular, inhibition of HSP90 by geldanamycin blocks the assembly of HSP90 heterocomplexes and destabilizes preformed heterocomplexes (31.Pratt W.B. Proc. Soc. Exp. Biol. Med. 1998; 217: 420-434Crossref PubMed Scopus (413) Google Scholar). Recently, HSP90 has been shown to be rapidly recruited to the eNOS complex in endothelial cells exposed to VEGF activating the enzyme and yielding the production of NO (32.Garcia-Cardena G. Fan R. Shah V. Sorrentino R. Cirino G. Papapetropoulos A. Sessa W.C. Nature. 1998; 392: 821-824Crossref PubMed Scopus (858) Google Scholar). HSP90 and possibly NO thus appears as plausible essential molecules in the cascades of events implicated in coupling the VEGF receptors to signaling pathways and further downstream biological events such as cell proliferation and cell migration. In the case of cell migration, this suggests that NO or HSP90 might be involved in pathways modulating actin dynamics and formation of focal adhesions, two essential components of the motile process (33.Carlier M.F. Pantaloni D. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 269: 459-467Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar, 34.Huttenlocher A. Sanborg R.R. Horwitz A.F. Curr. Opin.

Cell Biol. 1998; 140: 211-221Crossref PubMed Scopus (416) Google Scholar). In particular, migrating endothelial cells exhibit well formed focal adhesions and actin stress fibers aligned in the direction of cell migration (36.Madri J.A. Pratt B.M. Yannariello-Brownn J.

Cell. 1994; 5: 349-361Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). Here we report that VEGFR2 is responsible for the activation of actin-based motility induced by VEGF. We also show that VEGFR2-driven cell migration requires the concerted activation of two independent but complementary mechanisms: a SAPK2/p38-dependent actin polymerizing activity and a geldanamycin-dependent tyrosine phosphorylation of FAK and proper assembly of focal adhesions. Actin polymerization and focal adhesion assembly both allow the actin reorganization required for cell migration. [32P]ATP (3000 Ci/mmol) was purchased from NENTM Life Science Products, Boston, MA.

The umbilical vein was cannulated, washed with Earle's basic salt solution, and perfused for 10 min with collagenase (1 mg/ml) in Earle's basic salt solution at 37 °C. After perfusion, the detached cells were collected, the vein was washed with 199 medium and the wash-off pooled with the perfusate. After washing, cells were plated on gelatin-coated 75-cm2 culture dishes in 199 medium containing 20% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (FBS), endothelial cell growth supplement (60 μg/ml), glutamine, heparin, and antibiotics. Subcultures were obtained by trypsination and were used at passages <5. The identity of HUVEC as endothelial cells was confirmed by their polygonal shape and by detecting their immunoreactivity for factor VIII related antigens. For kinase assays, HUVEC were incubated for 16–24 h in endothelial cell growth supplement-free medium containing 5% FBS before addition of VEGF. PAE/VEGFR2 and PAE/VEGFR1 are two well characterized porcine aortic cell lines that stably express VEGFR2 (PAE/VEGFR2) or VEGFR1 (PAE/VEGFR1) following transfection with a modified vector pcDNAI carrying VEGFR1 or VEGFR2 cDNAs. VEGF binds to PAE/VEGFR1 with a K dof 16 pm and to PAE/VEGFR2 with a K d of 750 pm. No significant VEGF binding is observed in untransfected wild type PAE cells (45.Waltenberger J. Claesson-Welsh L.

PAE cells were plated 24 h before lipofection (330,000 cells/60-mm dishes), and incubated with 2.75 μg of plasmids (VEGFR2, c-myc-tagged ERK2, LT-tagged-MAPKAP K2, HSP90, HSP70, GFP, FRNK) with a ratio of 4:1 of Tfx50 from Promega for 2 h in the absence of serum. Cells were then overlaid with 4 ml of complete medium and assays were performed 24 h post-transfection. After stimulation, cells were scraped and extracted in kinase lysis buffer (20 mm MOPS, pH 7.0, 10% glycerol, 80 mm β-glycerophosphate, 5 mmEGTA, 0.5 mm EDTA, 1 mmNa3VO4, 5 mmNa4P2O7, 50 mm sodium fluoride, 1% Triton X-100, 1 mm benzamidine, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) for kinase assay or in F buffer (150 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.1% Triton X-100, 0.1% sodium deoxycholate, 2 mm EDTA, 2 mm EGTA, 1 mm Na3VO4, 1 μm leupeptin, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) for FAK immunoprecipitation.

Undiluted anti-p38, anti-ERK2, anti-MAPKAP K2/3 antibodies, anti-FAK, or anti-HSP90 were added in limiting concentrations and the mixtures were incubated for 1 h. Ten μl of protein A-Sepharose (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, Baie d'Urfée, Quebec) 50% (v/v) in buffer I or F, were added and the mixtures incubated for 30 min. Samples were centrifuged for 15 s and washed 3 times with 300 μl of buffer I/F. In some experiments supernatants were collected before the first wash. Immunoprecipitates were directly used for kinase assays. For co-immunoprecipitation experiments with polyclonal anti-HSP90 antibody, extracts were processed, as for FAK immunoprecipitation, and samples were analyzed through SDS-PAGE and Western blotting with appropriate antibodies. MAPKAP K2/3 activity, a physiological target of p38/SAPK2 was assayed as a measure of the in vivoactivity of SAPK2/p38 (46.Huot J. Houle F. Rousseau S. Deschesnes R.G. Shah G.M. Landry J. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 1361-1373Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar). MAPKAP kinase-2/3, ERK2, and p38 activities were assayed in immune complexes using appropriate substrates. MAPKAP kinase 2/3 activity was assayed using recombinant HSP27 as substrate (38.Huot J. Lambert H. Lavoie J.N. Guimond A. Houle F. Landry J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 227: 416-427Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). The assays were done in 25 μl of kinase buffer K: 100 μm ATP, 3 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP (3000 Ci/mmol), 40 mm p-nitrophenyl phosphate, 20 mm MOPS, pH 7.0, 10% glycerol, 15 mmMgCl2, 0.05% Triton X-100, 1 mmdithiothreitol, 1 μm leupeptin, 0.1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 0.3 μg of protein kinase A inhibitor. The kinase activity was assayed for 30 min at 30 °C and was stopped by adding 10 μl of SDS-PAGE loading buffer. Immunoprecipitated ERK2 and SAPK2/p38 were assayed analogously using, respectively, myelin basic protein and ATF2-GST as substrates (48.Rousseau S. Houle F. Landry J. Huot J. Oncogene. 1997; 15: 2169-2177Crossref PubMed Scopus (723) Google Scholar). Kinase assay buffer K containing 10 mm MgCl2was used for ERK2. Assay medium for p38 contained 50 mmHepes, pH 7.4, 50 mm β-glycerophosphate, 50 mm MgCl2, 0.2 mmNa3VO4, 4 mm dithiothreitol, ATF2-GST, and [γ-32P]ATP (3000 Ci/mmol). The activity of the kinases was quantified by measuring the incorporation of radioactivity into the specific substrate after SDS-PAGE. In certain experiments, SAPK2/p38 activity was also evaluated by Western blotting using antibody that recognizes the phosphorylated form of SAPK2/p38 (New England Biolabs). Proteins were separated through 7.5% SDS-PAGE and transferred onto nitrocellulose as described previously (47.Lavoie J.N. Lambert H. Hickey E. Weber L.A. Landry J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 505-516Crossref PubMed Scopus (568) Google Scholar). After reacting membrane with anti-phosphotyrosine (PY-20), or anti-FAK, proteins were detected using an ECL detection kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Cell migration was assayed using a modified Boyden chamber assay as described previously (45.Waltenberger J. Claesson-Welsh L. Siegbahn A. Shibuya M. Heldin C.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 26988-26995Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 48.Rousseau S. Houle F. Landry J. Huot J. Oncogene. 1997; 15: 2169-2177Crossref PubMed Scopus (723) Google Scholar). Briefly, exponentially growing cells were harvested with trypsin, counted, centrifuged, and resuspended at 0.5 × 106cells/ml in migration buffer (199 medium, 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 1.0 mm MgCl2, 0.5% bovine serum albumin). Cells were then added on an 8.0-μm pore size gelatinized polycarbonate membrane separating the two chambers of a 6.5-mm Transwell (Costar). After 1 h of adhesion, either 1% bovine serum albumin, as a negative control (lower chamber) or VEGF (lower chamber) were added. When indicated, geldanamycin, radicicol,l-NAME, anti-VEGFR2 antibodies or SB203580, or the vehicle (0.25% dimethyl sulfoxide), previously diluted in migration buffer, were added to both chambers 15 to 60 min before VEGF. After 2 h, cells on the upper face of the membrane were scraped using a cotton swab and cells on the lower face fixed with 3.7% formaldehyde and stained with Mayer's hematoxylin solution. The number of migrated cells on the lower face of the filter was counted in five fields under ×100 magnification. Assays were done in triplicates and repeated at least twice. NOS activity was evaluated by measuring the conversion of l-arginine to citrulline by using the NOS detect™ assay kit obtained from Stratagene (La Jolla, CA). HUVEC were plated 24 h before assay in 6-well plates and made quiescent for the last 12 h. After treatment, hypotonic lysis was performed and protein concentration was adjusted to 10 μg/ml. The extracts were incubated in reaction mixture containing [3H]arginine with 10 mm NADPH, 6 mm CaCl2, 0.1 μm calmodulin. The reaction mixture was incubated for 1 h at 37 °C and loaded on resin. The flow-through containing [3H]citrulline was collected and aliquots transferred to scintillation vials. The radioactivity was quantified using a liquid scintillation counter. F-actin detection was done as previously reported (41.Huot J. Houle F. Marceau F. Landry J. Circ. Res. 1997; 80: 383-392Crossref PubMed Scopus (496) Google Scholar, 46.Huot J. Houle F. Rousseau S. Deschesnes R.G. Shah G.M. Landry J. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 1361-1373Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar). HUVEC were plated on gelatin-coated slides. They were then fixed with 3.7% formaldehyde and permeabilized with 0.1% saponin in phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.5. F-actin was detected using FITC-conjugated phalloidin (33.3 μg/ml) diluted 1:50 in phosphate buffer. Vinculin was detected using the hVIN-1 monoclonal antibody. Vinculin antigen-antibody complexes were detected with biotin-labeled anti-mouse IgG and were revealed with Texas Red-conjugated streptavidin. For phosphotyrosines (PY-20) and paxillin labeling, cells were permeabilized with 0.1% Triton and incubated overnight with the respective antibodies at 4 °C in presence of 0.1% Triton. The labeling was then revealed as for vinculin. Cells were examined by confocal microscopy with a Bio-Rad MRC-1240 imaging system mounted on a Nikon Diaphot-TDM equipped with a 60× objective lens with a 1.4 numerical aperture (47.Lavoie J.N. Lambert H. Hickey E. Weber L.A. Landry J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 505-516Crossref PubMed Scopus (568) Google Scholar). F-actin levels were determined by confocal microscopy using the Histogram Bio-Rad Comos software as described previously (41.Huot J. Houle F. Marceau F. Landry J. Circ. Res. 1997; 80: 383-392Crossref PubMed Scopus (496) Google Scholar, 47.Lavoie J.N. Lambert H. Hickey E. Weber L.A. Landry J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 505-516Crossref PubMed Scopus (568) Google Scholar). Data are mean ± S.E. or S.D. Statistical analysis was made by using the Student t test.p < 0.05 was considered as significant. The SAPK2p38 MAP kinase pathway is a stress-activated kinase cascade that is strongly activated by VEGF, a motogenic factor that activates two tyrosine kinase receptors, VEGFR1 and VEGFR2 (Fig.1 C). We investigated which VEGF receptor was involved in activating SAPK2/p38 and cell migration. The ability of VEGFR1 and VEGFR2 to mediate the activation of SAPK2/p38 and ERK was evaluated in HUVEC exposed for 5 min to 5 ng/ml VEGF in the presence or absence of a VEGFR2 blocking antibody (VEGFR2 ba) that does not cross-react with VEGFR1 (42.Witte L.

Pytowski B. Hicklin D.J. Bohlen P. Witte L. Cancer Res. 1998; 58: 3209-3214PubMed Google Scholar). In the experiments, ERK activation was assayed as a reference control for VEGF-induced stimulation of VEGFR2 (24.Kroll J. Waltenberger J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 32521-32527Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (388) Google Scholar). Results showed that the antibody inhibited in a dose-dependent manner the VEGF-induced activation of both ERK and MAPKAP K2/3, a physiological target of SAPK2/p38 that we used as a measure of SAPK2/p38 activity (Fig. 1 A). A binding but non-blocking specific VEGFR2 antibody (VEGFR2 bnb) did not inhibit either MAPKAP K2/3 or ERK activation by VEGF (Fig. 1 A). PlGF, a member of"

Physiol. 1998; 275: C1-C24Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Because H2O2 is a small, diffusible, and ubiquitous molecule that can be synthesized, as well as destroyed, rapidly in response to external stimuli, it fulfills the important criteria for an intracellular messenger. The mechanism of receptor-mediated generation of H2O2 has been studied extensively in phagocytic cells, in which O⨪2 is produced via the one-electron reduction of O2 by a multicomponent NADPH oxidase system (28.Thelen M. Dewald B. Baggiolini M. Physiol. Rev. 1993; 73: 797-821Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar). The O⨪2 is then spontaneously or enzymatically dismutated to H2O2. The NADPH oxidase complex includes two cytosolic components (p47 phox and p67 phox) and two transmembrane flavocytochrome b components (gp91 phox and p22 phox). In addition, the small GTP-binding protein Rac (either Rac1 or Rac2) is required for activation of NADPH oxidase. In contrast, the mechanism of H2O2 generation in nonphagocytic cells remains unclear. Evidence suggests that the system responsible for H2O2 (O⨪2) production in nonphagocytic cells is structurally and genetically distinct from, but functionally similar to, the NADPH oxidase system of phagocytes (29.Pagano P.J. Clark J.K. Cifuentes-Pagano M.E. Clark S.M. Callis G.M. Quinn M.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 14483-14488Crossref PubMed Scopus (406) Google Scholar, 30.Emmendorffer A. Roesler J. Elsner J. Raeder E. Lohmann-Matthes M.L. Meier B. Eur. J. Haematol. 1993; 51: 223-227Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Consistent with this notion, overproduction of Rac1 in fibroblasts was associated with increased production of H2O2 (31.Sundaresan M., Yu, Z.X. Ferrans V.J. Sulciner D.J. Gutkind J.S. Irani K. Goldschmidt-Clermont P.J. Finkel T. Biochem. J. 1996; 318: 379-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (437) Google Scholar, 32.Joneson T. Bar-Sagi D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 17991-17994Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar) and a homolog of gp91-phox was found in several nonphagocytic cells (33.Suh Y.A. Arnold R.S. Lassegue B. Shi J. Xu X. Sorescu D. Chung A.B. Griendling K.K. Lambeth J.D. Nature. 1999; 401: 79-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (1263) Google Scholar). The binding of growth factors to their receptors results in receptor autophosphorylation on specific tyrosine residues. These phosphotyrosine residues initiate cellular signaling by acting as high affinity binding sites for the Src homology 2 domains of various effector proteins. In the PDGF β receptor (PDGFβR), seven autophosphorylation sites have been identified as specific binding sites for Src family tyrosine kinases (Tyr579 and Tyr581), phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) (Tyr740 and Tyr751), the GTPase-activating protein of Ras (GAP) (Tyr771), Src homology 2 domain-containing protein-tyrosine phosphatase-2 (SHP-2) (Tyr1009), and phospholipase C-γ1 (PLC-γ1) (Tyr1021). A series of PDGFβR mutants was previously constructed that includes a kinase-deficient [kinase(−)] mutant and receptors in which the binding sites for PI3K, GAP, SHP-2, and PLC-γ1 were changed individually or in various combinations to phenylalanine (34.Valius M. Kazlauskas A. Cell. 1993; 73: 321-334Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (568) Google Scholar). To characterize the mechanism of H2O2production in nonphagocytic cells, we have now measured PDGF-dependent H2O2 generation in human hepatoma HepG2 cells expressing these various PDGFβR mutants. Our data indicate that PDGFβR-dependent H2O2 production requires both the intrinsic kinase activity of the receptor as well as the activation of PI3K. Experiments with a dominant negative mutant of Rac1 (N17Rac1) also suggest that Rac1 participates in the PDGFβR-induced production of H2O2 in HepG2 cells. Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, modified Eagle's medium (MEM) without phenol red, Opti-MEM, fetal bovine serum, antibiotic-antimycotic mixture, and LipofectAMINE were obtained from Life Technologies, Inc.; expression plasmids encoding dominant negative Akt (Akt K179M) and constitutively activated Akt (Myr-Akt), PDGF-BB, and rabbit antibodies to Rac1 were from Upstate Biotechnology; LY294002 was from Bio-Mol, and 2′,7′-dichlorofluorescin diacetate was from Molecular Probes. Adenovirus encoding a dominant negative Rac1 (Ad.N17Rac1) was kindly provided by T. Finkel (NHLBI, NIH, Bethesda, MD). Expression plasmids encoding dominant negative mutants of Rho family proteins N17Cdc42 (pEXV-Cdc42N17) and N19RhoA (pEXV-RhoAN19) were kindly provided by J. H. Kim (KJIST, Kwhangju, Korea), and the expression plasmid encoding p110-CAAX (pCMVp110-CAAX) was provided by J. Downward (Cambridge University, UK). Construction of the various PDGFβR mutants shown in Fig. 1 and of the HepG2 cells expressing these mutants has been described previously (34.Valius M. Kazlauskas A. Cell. 1993; 73: 321-334Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (568) Google Scholar). The cells were maintained at 37 °C under an atmosphere of 5% CO2 in culture dishes containing Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. Intracellular production of H2O2 was assayed as described previously (8.Bae Y.S. Kang S.W. Seo M.S. Baines I.C. Tekle E. Chock P.B. Rhee S.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 217-221Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1085) Google Scholar). In brief, at various times after stimulation with PDGF-BB (100 ng/ml), dishes of confluent cells were washed with MEM lacking phenol red and then incubated in the dark for 5 min in Krebs-Ringer solution containing 5 μm 2′,7′-dichlorofluorescin diacetate. This compound is converted by intracellular esterases to 2′,7′-dichlorofluorescin, which is then oxidized by H2O2 to the highly fluorescent 2′,7′-dichlorofluorescein (DCF). Culture dishes were transferred to a Zeiss Axiovert 135 inverted microscope that was equipped with a x20 Neofluor objective and Zeiss LSM 410 confocal attachment, and DCF fluorescence was measured with an excitation wavelength of 488 nm and emission at 515–540 nm. To avoid photooxidation of 2′,7′-dichlorofluorescin, the fluorescence image was collected by a single rapid scan (4-line average, total scan time of 4.33 s), with identical parameters (such as contrast and brightness) for all samples. After collection of the fluorescence image, the cells were imaged by digital interference contrast. Five groups of 10–20 cells each were randomly selected from each sample, and the mean relative fluorescence intensity for each group of cells was then measured by Karl Zeiss vision system (KS400, version 3.0) and averaged. All experiments were repeated at least five times. HepG2 cells were plated at a density of 2 × 105/well in culture dishes and allowed to recover for 24 h. Adenovrus infection was performed at an multiplicity of infection of 200. After adenovirus infection for 72 h, the cells were then washed with MEM without phenol red, exposed for 30 min to PDGF-BB (100 ng/ml), and subjected to assay of H2O2 production. Western blot analysis of Myc-tagged form of N17Rac was performed using an antibody to rac1 (35.Kim K.-S. Takeda K. Sethi R. Pracyk J.B. Tanaka K. Zhou Y.F., Yu, Z.-X. Ferrans V.J. Bruder J.T.

Cell. 1993; 73: 321-334Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (568) Google Scholar) previously constructed the series of PDGFβR mutants shown in Fig. 1. The kinase(−) mutant was generated by mutating Lys634 to Arg; the F740/751 mutant by replacing the residues that constitute the PI3K binding site (Tyr740 and Tyr751) with Phe; the F771 mutant by replacing the GAP binding site (Tyr771) with Phe; the F1021 mutant by replacing the PLC-γ1 binding site (Tyr1021) with Phe; the F740/751/771 mutant by replacing Tyr740, Tyr751, and Tyr 771 with Phe; and the F5 mutant by replacing the five tyrosine residues Tyr740, Tyr751, Tyr 771, Tyr1009 (the SHP-2 binding site), and Tyr1021with Phe (Fig. 1). In addition, the ability of F5 to signal via PI3K was selectively restored by changing Phe740 and Phe751 in this mutant back to Tyr, thereby generating Y740/751 (Fig. 1). Similarly, the ability of F5 to signal via PLC-γ1 was restored by changing Phe1021 in this mutant back to Tyr, generating Y1021 (Fig. 1). The wild-type and mutant PDGFβR proteins were expressed, with the use of a retroviral expression vector, in HepG2 cells, which do not express detectable amounts of endogenous PDGFβ receptors. The level of PDGFβR expression was approximately 5 × 105 receptors/cell for both wild-type and mutant receptors (34.Valius M. Kazlauskas A. Cell. 1993; 73: 321-334Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (568) Google Scholar). The production of H2O2 by HepG2 cells was measured with a fluorescence-based assay with 2′,7′-dichlorofluorescin diacetate and laser-scanning confocal microscopy. Stimulation of HepG2 cells expressing wild-type PDGFβR with PDGF resulted in a time-dependent increase in the intensity of DCF fluorescence, with the maximal, 3.5-fold increase apparent 10–30 min after stimulation; fluorescence had returned to the baseline value after 60 min (Fig. 2 A). In contrast, cells expressing the kinase(−) or F5 mutant receptors failed to produce H2O2 in response to PDGF (Fig. 2,B and C). These results suggest that PDGF-induced H2O2 production requires the kinase activity of PDGFβR as well as at least one of the five tyrosine phosphorylation sites mutated in F5. We next measured PDGF-induced H2O2 production in cells expressing other PDGFβR mutants (Fig.3). Whereas PDGF had no effect on H2O2 production in cells expressing F740/751 or F740/751/771 mutants, it increased H2O2production in cells expressing the F771 or F1021 mutants to an extent similar to that observed in cells expressing the wild-type receptor. Cells expressing Y740/751 (equivalent to F5 in which the PI3K binding site has been restored) showed a response to PDGF that was slightly greater than that of cells expressing the wild-type receptor. However, cells expressing Y1021 (equivalent to F5 in which the PLC-γ1 binding site has been restored) did not generate H2O2in response to PDGF. These results thus indicate that activation of PI3K, but not of GAP, SHP-2, or PLC-γ1, is necessary for H2O2 production in response to PDGF. The essential role of PI3K was further supported by the observation that prior incubation with 10 μm LY294002, a specific inhibitor of PI3K, completely blocked the PDGF-induced increase in H2O2 production in HepG2 cells expressing wild-type or Y740/751 PDGF receptors (Fig.4). Similar inhibition was also observed with wortmannin, another inhibitor of PI3K (data not shown). Prior incubation with the inhibitors had no effect on the basal level of H2O2 production. PDGF also induced a transient increase in H2O2 production, with the maximal, 6-fold increase apparent 5–10 min after stimulation, in NIH 3T3 cells, and this effect was also abolished by 10 μm LY294002 (data not shown). We further examined whether activation of PI3K is sufficient to produce H2O2 by transiently expressing in HepG2 cells the catalytic p110 subunit of PI3K with c-Myc epitope and farnesylation signal (CAAX) sequences at the NH2 and COOH termini, respectively. It was previously shown that even modest expression of the membrane-targeted p110 (p110-CAAX) is sufficient to trigger activation of downstream events (36.Khwaja A. Rodriguez-Viciana P. Wennstrom S. Warne P.H. Downward J. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 2783-2793Crossref PubMed Scopus (931) Google Scholar, 37.Bae Y.S. Cantley L.G. Chen C.-S. Kim S.-R. Kwon K.-S. Rhee S.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 4465-4469Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar). Expression of p110-CAAX in HepG2 cells expressing F5 mutant receptor resulted in a 3-fold increase in H2O2 production, and the effect was blocked by prior incubation of cells with LY294002 or wortmannin (Fig.5). To investigate the role of Rac1 in PI3K-dependent H2O2 production, we infected HepG2 cells expressing the Y740/751 receptor either with recombinant adenovirus encoding N17Rac1, a dominant negative mutant of Rac1 (Ad.N17rac), or control adenovirus (35.Kim K.-S. Takeda K. Sethi R. Pracyk J.B. Tanaka K. Zhou Y.F., Yu, Z.-X. Ferrans V.J. Bruder J.T. Kovesdi I. Irani K. Goldschmidt-Clermont P. Finkel T. J. Clin. Invest. 1998; 101: 1821-1826Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). Expression of N17Rac1 in the infected HepG2 cells was confirmed by immunoblot analysis (Fig.6 A). Whereas HepG2 cells expressing the Y740/751 receptor infected control adenovirus showed an increase in H2O2 production in response to PDGF, those infected with recombinant adenovirus encoding N17Rac1 (Ad.N17rac) did not (Fig. 6 B). Similar results were observed after infection of cells expressing wild-type PDGFβR with the recombinant adenovirus encoding N17Rac1 (data not shown). In contrast, expression of dominant negative mutants of other Rho-family members (N19RhoA or N17Cdc42) did not affect the PDGF-induced increase in H2O2 production in HepG2 cells expressing wild-type PDGFβR (data not shown). The binding of peptide growth factors to their specific receptors results in receptor autophosphorylation at several tyrosine residues, thereby triggering the recruitment of Src homology 2 domain-containing effector enzymes that include Src, PI3K, GAP, SHP-2, and PLC-γ1 (34.Valius M. Kazlauskas A. Cell. 1993; 73: 321-334Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (568) Google Scholar,38.Klinghoffer R.A. Duckworth B. Valius M. Cantley L. Kazlauskas A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 5905-5914Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). The interaction of growth factors with their receptors also induces a transient increase in the intracellular concentration of H2O2 (5.Sattler M. Winkler T. Verma S. Byrne C.H. Shrikhande G. Salgia R. Griffin J.D. Blood. 1999; 93: 2928-2935Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 6.Lo Y.Y.C. Cruz T.F. J. Biol.

J. 1995; 307: 549-556Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). In the present study, the role of the receptor-associated effectors in H2O2production was investigated with HepG2 cells expressing various PDGFβR mutants. The PDGFβR was well suited for this study because the effector enzymes bind only when the receptor is phosphorylated at specific tyrosine residues (34.Valius M. Kazlauskas A. Cell. 1993; 73: 321-334Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (568) Google Scholar). Mutation of these tyrosine residues individually prevents association of a specific effector without affecting the binding of other enzymes to the receptor mutant. In the case of other growth factor receptors, either the effector enzymes bind less specifically at multiple tyrosine residues or their binding sites are not well defined. Our results suggest that, among the effector enzymes PI3K, GAP, SHP-2, and PLC-γ1, only the binding of PI3K to PDGFβR is necessary for PDGF-induced H2O2 production. The absence of the binding sites for GAP, SHP-2, and PLC-γ1 in the Y740/751 receptor mutant was actually associated with a slight, but reproducible, increase in the extent of PDGF-induced H2O2production relative to that apparent with the wild-type receptor. This observation is consistent with the results of a previous study showing that PLC-γ1 and GAP negatively regulate the PDGF-induced activation of PI3K (38.Klinghoffer R.A. Duckworth B. Valius M. Cantley L. Kazlauskas A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 5905-5914Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Given that phosphorylation of Tyr740 and Tyr751 is required to generate the binding site for PI3K, it follows that the intrinsic kinase activity of PDGFβR is also required for PDGF-induced generation of H2O2. We previously also showed that an epidermal growth factor receptor mutant lacking kinase activity did not induce an increase in H2O2 production in response to epidermal growth factor (8.Bae Y.S. Kang S.W. Seo M.S. Baines I.C. Tekle E. Chock P.B. Rhee S.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 217-221Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1085) Google Scholar). In contrast, the observation that a membrane-bound NADPH oxidase prepared from human fat cells produced H2O2 in the absence of ATP in response to insulin suggested that this growth factor is able to induce H2O2 production independently of the kinase activity of its receptor (39.Krieger-Brauer H.I. Kather H. J. Clin. Invest. 1992; 89: 1006-1013Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). Activation of PI3K appears to be sufficient to produce H2O2 as indicated by the observation that expression of p110-CAAX induced H2O2production. One of the major events following PI3K activation is the phosphorylation and activation of Akt, a serine/threonine kinase (40.Rameh L.E. Cantley L.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 8347-8350Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (830) Google Scholar). Therefore, we determined whether Akt is involved in PDGF-induced H2O2 production. Transient expression of either a dominant negative Akt mutant in HepG2 cells expressing Y740/751 receptor or a constitutively active Akt in HepG2 cells expressing F5 receptor had no effect on H2O2 production (data not shown). These results suggest that Akt is not involved in the PDGF-induced H2O2 production. It was previously shown that the blockage of the growth factor-induced H2O2 increase by catalase in vascular smooth muscle and A431 cells resulted in a marked decrease in tyrosine phosphorylation of various proteins including the growth factor receptors (7.Sundaresan M., Yu, Z.X. Ferrans V.J. Irani K. Finkel T. Science. 1995; 270: 296-299Crossref PubMed Scopus (2285) Google Scholar, 8.Bae Y.S. Kang S.W. Seo M.S. Baines I.C. Tekle E. Chock P.B. Rhee S.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 217-221Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1085) Google Scholar). At the present time, we do not know why PDGFRs (F740/751, F740/751/771, and F5) that fail to induce H2O2 production were fully autophosphorylated in HepG2 cells (34.Valius M. Kazlauskas A. Cell. 1993; 73: 321-334Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (568) Google Scholar, 38.Klinghoffer R.A. Duckworth B. Valius M. Cantley L. Kazlauskas A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 5905-5914Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). It is possible that in HepG2 cells, H2O2 production makes a smaller contribution to receptor tyrosine phosphorylation as compared with vascular smooth muscle and A431 cells. An essential role for Rac in activation of the NADPH oxidase complex has been well established in phagocytes (28.Thelen M. Dewald B. Baggiolini M. Physiol. Rev. 1993; 73: 797-821Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar). Rac also appears important in this regard in nonphagocytic cells, as indicated by the observations that transient expression of an active form of Rac1 (V12Rac1) in NIH 3T3 cells itself resulted in an increase in H2O2 production and that expression of N17Rac1 inhibited the increase in H2O2 concentration induced by PDGF, epidermal growth factor, tumor necrosis factor-α, or interleukin-1 (31.Sundaresan M., Yu, Z.X. Ferrans V.J. Sulciner D.J. Gutkind J.S. Irani K. Goldschmidt-Clermont P.J. Finkel T. Biochem. J. 1996; 318: 379-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (437) Google Scholar). Our observation that N17Rac1 blocked the Y740/751 receptor-induced generation of H2O2 indicates that Rac1 acts downstream of PI3K in the signaling pathway that leads to activation of NADPH oxidase. Moreover, signaling by this pathway appears independent of activation of GAP, SHP-2, and PLC-γ1. Additional evidence suggests that Rac functions downstream of PI3K (41.Hawkins P.T. Eguinoa A.

Chem. 1999; 274: 8347-8350Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (847) Google Scholar). Thus, the exchange of Rac-bound GDP for GTP catalyzed by guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs) is stimulated by phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate (PI(3,4,5)P3), a product of the action of PI3K. A family of GEF proteins that mediate the activation of Rac-related proteins has been identified. All members of this family, including Vav, Sos, and Pix, contain a pleckstrin homology domain that binds inositol-containing phospholipids such as PI(4,5)P2 and PI(3,4,5)P3 (44.Rameh L.E. Cantley L.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 8347-8350Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (847) Google Scholar, 45.Leevers S.J. Vanhaesebroeck B. Waterfield M.D. Curr. Opin.

Zhu K. Kubiseski T.J. Liu G.A. Pawson T. Zheng Y. Rosen M.K. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1998; 5: 1098-1107Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). PI(4,5)P2, when bound to the pleckstrin homology domain of Vav, inhibited activation of Vav GEF activity by the protein-tyrosine kinase Lck, whereas PI(3,4,5)P3 enhanced phosphorylation and activation of Vav by Lck (42.Han J. Luby-Phelps K. Das B. Shu X. Xia Y. Mosteller R.D. Krishna U.M. Falck J.R. White M.A. Broek D. Science. 1998; 279: 558-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (708) Google Scholar). Thus, the activation of PI3K might serve to convert a Vav inhibitor to an activator, resulting in a rapid transformation of inactive, GDP-bound Rac to its active, GTP-bound form. Sos possesses two distinct domains that allow it to function as a GEF for both Ras and Rac; the Rac GEF activity requires the binding of activated Ras to the Ras GEF domain of Sos as well as the binding of PI(3,4,5)P3 to the pleckstrin homology domain (43.Nimnual A.S. Yatsula B.A. Bar-Sagi D. Science. 1998; 279: 560-563Crossref PubMed Scopus (387) Google Scholar). Although not yet demonstrated, the GEF activity of Pix is also likely dependent on a product of PI3K. The mechanism by which GTP-bound Rac increases the production of superoxide (and thus H2O2) in nonphagocytic cells is not clear. In phagocytes, activated Rac1 associates directly with p67-phox to stimulate NADPH oxidase (48.Diekmann D. Abo A. Johnston C. Segal A.W. Hall A. Science. 1994; 265: 531-533Crossref PubMed Scopus (344) Google Scholar, 49.Nisimoto Y. Freeman J.L.R. Motalebi S.A. Hirshberg M. Lambeth J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 18834-18841Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Although the NADPH oxidase system in nonphagocytic cells is not well characterized, a similar interaction might occur. In summary, we have shown that the activation of PI3K is required for PDGF-induced H2O2 production. The essential role of PI3K is likely to provide PI(3,4,5)P3 for the activation of Rac, a component of the H2O2-generating system in both phagocytes and nonphagocytic cells."

These receptors elicit their actions by binding to hormone response elements (HREs)1 in the promoters of target genes and regulating transcription in response to lipophilic ligands. HREs are typically composed of two 6-base pair half-sites that may be arranged as direct, inverted, or everted repeats (2.Mangelsdorf D.J. Evans R.M.

The HRE for a given receptor is determined by the nucleotide sequence of the half-sites, the orientation and spacing of those half-sites, and the nucleotide sequence flanking the half-sites (2.Mangelsdorf D.J.

The nuclear hormone receptor superfamily can be divided into the following two major classes: type I or classic steroid receptors (which include estrogen, progesterone, glucocorticoid, and mineralocorticoid receptors) and type II or non-steroid receptors (which include the retinoic acid, retinoid X, thyroid hormone, and vitamin D receptors) (1.Mangelsdorf D.J.

Type II receptors show a larger variety of modes of DNA binding. Most type II receptors bind DNA as a heterodimer with the 9-cis-retinoic acid receptor (RXR) (1.Mangelsdorf D.J. Thummel C. Beato M.

The HRE recognized by a monomer consists of a single half-site with additional sequence requirements upstream of the half-site called the 5′-extended half-site (8.Wilson T.E. Fahrner T.J. Johnston M. Milbrandt J. Science. 1991; 252: 1296-1300Crossref PubMed Scopus (481) Google Scholar, 9.Wilson T.E. Paulsen R.E. Padgett K.A. Milbrandt J. Science. 1992; 256: 107-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar). HREs that are recognized by homodimers are typically inverted or direct repeats (10.Cooney A.J. Tsai S.Y. O'Malley B.W. Tsai M.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 4153-4163Crossref PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar, 11.Yan Z.H. Medvedev A. Hirose T. Gotoh H. Jetten A.M. J. Biol.

When a nuclear hormone receptor is bound to an HRE, it may activate or repress transcription depending on the presence of ligand, cell type, promoter, response element, or other signals. Recent studies demonstrate that HREs contain “signaling information” that the receptor must “interpret” to determine the activity of a receptor bound to that site. For example, the glucocorticoid receptor (GR) can activate transcription when bound to certain glucocorticoid response elements (GREs) or repress transcription when bound to other GREs (Ref.13.Starr D.B. Matsui W. Thomas J.R. Yamamoto K.R. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 1271-1283Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar and references therein). Yamamoto and co-workers (13.Starr D.B. Matsui W. Thomas J.R. Yamamoto K.R. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 1271-1283Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar) identified a mutant GR (K461A) that activated transcription when bound to all GREs tested, implying that this residue was critical for interpreting the signal from the GRE. Another example of context-dependent activation is the liver-X receptor (LXR). LXR activates transcription when bound as a heterodimer with RXR to a direct repeat of the sequence AGTTCA spaced by 4 base pairs (DR4T element or LXR element) (14.Willy P.J. Umesono K. Ong E.S. Evans R.M. Heyman R.A. Mangelsdorf D.J. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 1033-1045Crossref PubMed Scopus (923) Google Scholar, 15.Willy P.J. Mangelsdorf D.J. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 289-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). However, LXR/RXR is unable to activate through a DR4 element with the sequence AGGTCA (DR4G element), even though LXR/RXR binds to DR4T and DR4G with similar affinities (14.Willy P.J. Umesono K. Ong E.S. Evans R.M. Heyman R.A. Mangelsdorf D.J. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 1033-1045Crossref PubMed Scopus (923) Google Scholar, 15.Willy P.J. Mangelsdorf D.J. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 289-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). Thus, HREs represent not only a specific binding site for nuclear receptors but can also significantly affect the function of the receptor. The FXR (NR1H4) (16.Nuclear Receptors Nomenclature CommitteeCell. 1999; 97: 161-163Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (951) Google Scholar) was originally isolated from a rat liver cDNA library by degenerate PCR, utilizing primers to the highly conserved DNA binding domain of nuclear hormone receptors (17.Forman B.M. Goode E. Chen J. Oro A.E. Bradley D.J. Perlmann T. Noonan D.J. Burka L.T. McMorris T. Lamph W.W. Evans R.M. Weinberger C.W. Cell. 1995; 81: 687-693Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (978) Google Scholar). The FXR cDNA was found to be homologous (94% identity) to a previously identified mouse receptor called RXR-interacting protein 14 (RIP14) (17.Forman B.M. Goode E. Chen J. Oro A.E. Bradley D.J.

Mol. Endocrinol. 1995; 9: 72-85Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These receptors are expressed in liver, kidney, gut, and adrenal cortex of adult rats and mice and in several embryonic tissues (17.Forman B.M. Goode E. Chen J. Oro A.E. Bradley D.J. Perlmann T. Noonan D.J. Burka L.T. McMorris T. Lamph W.W. Evans R.M. Weinberger C.W. Cell. 1995; 81: 687-693Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (978) Google Scholar, 18.Seol W. Choi H.-S. Moore D.D. Mol. Endocrinol. 1995; 9: 72-85Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Sequence comparison indicates that FXR is closely related to the ecdysone receptor (EcR) from Drosophila, particularly in the DNA-binding domain where they share 81% identity (17.Forman B.M. Goode E. Chen J. Oro A.E. Bradley D.J. Perlmann T. Noonan D.J. Burka L.T. McMorris T. Lamph W.W. Evans R.M. Weinberger C.W. Cell. 1995; 81: 687-693Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (978) Google Scholar). The EcR is known to function as a heterodimer with ultraspiracle (USP), theDrosophila homolog of RXR (19.Thomas H.E. Stunnenberg H.G. Stewart A.F. Nature. 1993; 362: 471-475Crossref PubMed Scopus (445) Google Scholar, 20.Yao T.P. Forman B.M. Jiang Z. Cherbas L. Chen J.D. McKeown M. Cherbas P. Evans R.M.

Cell. 1992; 71: 63-72Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (616) Google Scholar). The EcR/USP heterodimer binds to and transactivates through an EcR element (EcRE) that consists of an inverted repeat with 1-base pair spacing (IR-1) (19.Thomas H.E. Stunnenberg H.G. Stewart A.F. Nature. 1993; 362: 471-475Crossref PubMed Scopus (445) Google Scholar, 20.Yao T.P. Forman B.M. Jiang Z. Cherbas L. Chen J.D. McKeown M. Cherbas P. Evans R.M.

Cell. 1992; 71: 63-72Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (616) Google Scholar). TheDrosophila heat shock protein 27 (hsp27) promoter contains an IR-1 that functions as an EcRE (22.Riddihough G. Pelham H.R.B. EMBO J. 1987; 6: 3729-3734Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Based on homology between FXR (or RIP14) and EcR, it was shown that FXR/RXR or RIP14/RXR bound to the hsp27-EcRE (17.Forman B.M. Goode E. Chen J. Oro A.E. Bradley D.J. Perlmann T. Noonan D.J. Burka L.T. McMorris T. Lamph W.W. Evans R.M. Weinberger C.W. Cell. 1995; 81: 687-693Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (978) Google Scholar, 18.Seol W. Choi H.-S. Moore D.D. Mol. Endocrinol. 1995; 9: 72-85Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). RIP14/RXR was also shown to bind to several other elements including the retinoic acid response element from the hRARβ2 promoter (an imperfect direct repeat with 5-base pair spacing; DR-5), synthetic DR-2, DR-4, and DR-5 elements (18.Seol W. Choi H.-S. Moore D.D. Mol. Endocrinol. 1995; 9: 72-85Crossref PubMed Google Scholar); however, it is not known whether these various motifs also function as positive or negative transcriptional elements involved in the regulation of gene expression by FXR. A detailed investigation of the DNA sequences necessary for binding and activation of transcription by FXR/RXR has not been reported. FXR/RXR was originally shown to activate reporter genes with multiple copies of the EcRE upstream of a heterologous promoter in response to the isoprenoid farnesol or the related insect isoprenoid Juvenille Hormone III. Based on these observations, the receptor was named the farnesoid X-activated receptor (17.Forman B.M. Goode E. Chen J. Oro A.E. Bradley D.J. Perlmann T. Noonan D.J. Burka L.T. McMorris T. Lamph W.W. Evans R.M. Weinberger C.W. Cell. 1995; 81: 687-693Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (978) Google Scholar). Surprisingly, RIP14 was not activated by farnesol (23.Zavacki A.M. Lehmann J.M. Seol W. Wilson T.M. Kliewer S.A. Moore D.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 7909-7914Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). In contrast, both FXR and RIP14 can be activated by all-trans-retinoic acid or a synthetic retinoid (TTNPB) (23.Zavacki A.M. Lehmann J.M. Seol W. Wilson T.M. Kliewer S.A. Moore D.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 7909-7914Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). More recently, a number of bile acids, including chenodeoxycholic acid (CDCA), have been shown to bind to and potently transactivate FXR and RIP14 (24.Parks D.J. Blanchard S.G. Bledsoe R.K. Chandra G. Consler T.G. Kliewer S.A. Stimmel J.B. Wilson T.M. Zavacki A.M. Moore D.D. Lehmann J.M. Science. 1999; 284: 1365-1368Crossref PubMed Scopus (1857) Google Scholar, 25.Makishima M.

Hollister K. Sowers L.C. Forman B.M. Mol. Cell. 1999; 3: 543-553Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1304) Google Scholar). Neither farnesol, Juvenille Hormone III, nor all-trans-retinoic acid have been shown to bind directly to either FXR or RIP14, although TTNPB has been shown to displace CDCA from FXR (24.Parks D.J. Blanchard S.G. Bledsoe R.K. Chandra G. Consler T.G. Kliewer S.A. Stimmel J.B. Wilson T.M. Zavacki A.M. Moore D.D. Lehmann J.M. Science. 1999; 284: 1365-1368Crossref PubMed Scopus (1857) Google Scholar). The FXR/RXR heterodimer can also be activated by RXR-specific ligands (including 9-cis-retinoic acid) through the RXR moiety (17.Forman B.M. Goode E. Chen J. Oro A.E. Bradley D.J. Perlmann T.

We identified an IR-1 element as a high affinity binding site and functional response element for FXR/RXR. In addition, a number of non-consensus IR-1 and DR sequences were shown to function as response elements for FXR/RXR when placed upstream of a minimal promoter. We identified naturally occurring IR-1 elements in the promoters of several genes that both bind FXR/RXR in vitro and confer transcriptional activation by FXR ligands in vivo. These results suggest that FXR may regulate expression of these genes. Consistent with this hypothesis, we demonstrate that FXR ligands increase the mRNA levels of at least one of these genes and that overexpression of FXR further increases these levels. These studies will assist in the identification of genes and pathways regulated by FXR. Full-length cDNA for FXR (pKS-OR2) was kindly provided by Dr. Cary Weinberger (NIEHS, National Institutes of Health). FXR (amino acids 111–469) was amplified by PCR using pKS-OR2 as the template and primers incorporating a BamHI site upstream and an XhoI site downstream of the indicated coding region. This fragment was subcloned intoBamHI/XhoI-digested pRSET B (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) to generate pRSET-FXRΔ110. Mammalian expression vectors for FXR (pCMX-FXR) and hRXRα (pCMX-hRXRα) were kindly provided by Dr. Ron Evans (Salk Institute, La Jolla, CA). Full-length hRXRα was amplified by PCR using pCMX-hRXRα as the template and subcloned into pRSET B, as described above, to generate pRSET-hRXRα. NH2-terminal histidine-tagged FXRΔ110 and histidine-tagged hRXRα were expressed using pRSET-FXRΔ110 and pRSET-hRXRα in Escherichia coli (strain BL21(DE3)pLysS) (Novagen). Cultures were grown to an A 600 of 0.6 and then induced with 1 mmisopropylthio-β-d-galactoside for 2.5 h. Induced cells were collected and resuspended in MCAC-0 (20 mm Tris, pH 7.9, 0.5 m NaCl, 1 mm PMSF, 1.0 μg/ml leupeptin, 0.7 μg/ml pepstatin) and then sonicated three times. Lysates were centrifuged at 27,000 × g, and the supernatant (crude extract) was loaded onto a nickel affinity column (Novagen). Columns were washed thoroughly with MCAC-40 (20 mm Tris, pH 7.9, 40 mm imidazole, 0.5m NaCl, 1 mm PMSF, 1.0 μg/ml leupeptin, 0.7 μg/ml pepstatin), and proteins were eluted with MCAC-200 (20 mm Tris, pH 7.9, 200 mm imidazole, 0.5m NaCl, 1 mm PMSF, 1.0 μg/ml leupeptin, 0.7 μg/ml pepstatin). Five 1-ml fractions were individually dialyzed against 25 mm HEPES, pH 7.6, 2 mmMgCl2, 20% glycerol, 1 mm EDTA, 100 mm KCl, 1 mm DTT, 1% Nonidet P-40, 200 μm PMSF, 0.7 μg/ml pepstatin, and 1.0 μg/ml leupeptin. The SAAB technique was performed essentially as described (27.Blackwell T.K. Weintraub H. Science. 1990; 250: 1104-1110Crossref PubMed Scopus (760) Google Scholar). Briefly, a randomized single-stranded oligonucleotide template (SAAB template, 5′-agtggaattcgcgaagataaggtcannnnnnnnnnnggagaccagtaggggtaccaccc-3′) (see Fig. 1 A), a 5′ SAAB primer (5′-agtggaattcgcgaagataag-3′), and a 3′ SAAB primer (5′-gggtggtacccctactgg-3′) were purchased (Life Technologies, Inc.). Double-stranded randomized templates were generated by annealing the 3′ SAAB primer to the SAAB template and extending with Klenow fragment of DNA polymerase (Life Technologies, Inc.) at 37 °C for 1 h. The double-stranded SAAB templates were separated from single-stranded oligonucleotides by electrophoresis on a 15% polyacrylamide gel, excised, and eluted in 0.5 ml of 0.5 m ammonium acetate, 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EDTA, and 0.1% SDS at 37 °C for 12 h. Templates were then precipitated with ethanol, resuspended, and then reprecipitated using sodium acetate and ethanol. For first round selection, random templates were end-labeled with T4 polynucleotide kinase (New England Biolabs) and [γ-32P]ATP (NEN Life Science Products). Labeled double-stranded templates were mixed with approximately 50 ng of FXRΔ110 and 25 ng of hRXRα proteins (described above) and incubated in binding buffer (10 mm HEPES, pH 7.6, 0.5 mmDTT, 40 mm NaCl, 2.5 mm MgCl2, 0.05% (v/v) Nonidet P-40, 10% (v/v) glycerol, 50 ng/μl poly(dI-dC) (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), 2.5 mg/ml non-fat milk) for 1 h at room temperature. The ratio of FXRΔ110 to hRXRα was 2:1 in order to favor formation of FXR/hRXRα heterodimers rather than hRXRα homodimers. DNA-protein complexes were separated on a 6% non-denaturing polyacrylamide gel at 4 °C for 2 h. The gel was dried and visualized by autoradiography. An oligonucleotide probe containing a single EcRE, a known binding site for FXR/hRXRα, served as a marker for migration of the FXR·hRXRα·DNA complex. The FXR·hRXRα·DNA complex was excised based on migration of the positive control. The SAAB-selected oligonucleotides (S.O.s) were eluted in 0.5 ml of 0.5 m ammonium acetate, 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EDTA, and 0.1% SDS at 37 °C for 3 h. Glycogen (10 μg) was added, and the S.O.s were extracted twice with phenol:chloroform:isoamyl alcohol (25:24:1) and precipitated with ethanol. The S.O.s were resuspended in H2O and then reprecipitated using sodium acetate and ethanol. Approximately one-fifth of the S.O. pool was amplified by PCR using standard conditions. PCR products were purified on a 15% polyacrylamide gel as described above. These purified amplified templates were labeled for subsequent rounds of selection by PCR; approximately 5 ng of templates were amplified by one cycle of PCR with 100 ng each SAAB 5′ primer and SAAB 3′ primer, 30 μCi of [α-32P]dCTP, 0.25 mm each dATP, dTTP, and dGTP in standard PCR buffer. Unincorporated [α-32P]dCTP was removed by gel filtration on BioSpin 6 columns (Bio-Rad), and approximately 100 pg of labeled template was used for the next round of selection (EMSA). After three rounds of selection, selected oligonucleotides were subcloned by TA cloning into the pCR2.1-TOPO cloning vector (Invitrogen). Twenty-six clones were picked and sequenced using the T7 Sequenase version 2.0 kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Single-stranded oligonucleotides were purchased (Life Technologies, Inc.), annealed, and analyzed by 15% non-denaturing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. For EMSAs, double-stranded oligonucleotides were labeled with T4 polynucleotide kinase (New England Biolabs) and [γ-32P]ATP (NEN Life Science Products) and unincorporated ATP removed by gel filtration on Bio-Spin 6 columns (Bio-Rad).

Sequences corresponding to half-sites are capitalized. All IR-1 “mutant” oligonucleotides were identical to IR-1-CON, except where indicated in the figures. All EcRE mutant oligonucleotides were identical to hsp27-EcRE-WT, except where indicated in the figures. Oligonucleotides for hsp27-EcRE-WT, PLTP, CPT II, and PNMT were identical to sequences found in the “natural” promoters. For EMSAs, partially purified FXRΔ110 and hRXRα were incubated in binding buffer (10 mm HEPES, pH 7.6, 0.5 mm DTT, 2.5 mm MgCl2, 0.05% (v/v) Nonidet P-40, 10% (v/v) glycerol, 50 ng/μl poly(dI-dC) (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), 2.5 mg/ml non-fat milk, and 50 mm NaCl on ice for 15 min. Labeled probe (20,000 cpm, 1.5 fmol) was added, and the binding reaction was incubated at room temperature for 30 min. Complexes were resolved by 4% non-denaturing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis at 4 °C for 2 h. The gel was dried and analyzed by PhosphorImaging (ImageQuantTM software, Molecular Dynamics). Double-stranded oligonucleotides (described above) were ligated intoBamHI/BglII digested pTK-Luc. Plasmids were selected in which two copies of the binding site were oriented in the same direction. For pTK-2x(IR-1) constructs, the binding sites were oriented such that the extended half-site (tttt in consensus) was downstream of the IR-1. For pTK-2x(EcRE), -(PLTP), -(CPT II), and -(PNMT), binding sites were oriented as found in their natural promoters. HepG2 cells were maintained in minimal essential medium (Life Technologies, Inc.), 1 mm sodium pyruvate, 2 mml-glutamine, 0.1 mmnon-essential amino acids, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, 0.25 μg/ml fungizone, and 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS). FAO cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Life Technologies, Inc.), 1 mm sodium pyruvate, 2 mml-glutamine, 0.1 mmnon-essential amino acids, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, 0.25 μg/ml fungizone, 4% calf serum, and 4% FBS. HepG2 cells were transiently transfected with 2 μg of pTK-Luciferase reporter plasmids (described above), 1 μg of pCMV-β-galactosidase, 50 ng each of pCMX-FXR and pCMX-hRXRα, and 3 μg of pTKCIII (carrier plasmid) per 60-mm dish using the MBS Mammalian Transfection Kit (Stratagene) with minor modifications. Following transfection, cells were grown in medium containing 10% charcoal resin-stripped (super-stripped) FBS and either 5 μm4-[E-2-(5,6,7,8-tetrahydro-5,5,8,8-tetramethyl-2-naphthalenyl)-1-propenyl]benzoic acid (TTNPB) (Biomol, PA), 100 μm 5β-cholanic acid-3α,7α-diol (chenodeoxycholic acid) (Sigma), 100 nmLG10153 (RXR-selective agonist) (Ligand Pharmaceuticals, Inc., CA), or Me2SO carrier alone, as indicated in the figures.

Although iron is the second most abundant metal in the earth's crust, it is not readily bioavailable, because iron is largely present as poorly soluble complexes of ferric hydroxide. Therefore, organisms from microbes to man have developed mechanisms for obtaining iron from the environment. The budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae has two characterized systems of elemental iron uptake, a low affinity system encoded by FET4 (1.Dix D.R. Bridgham J.T. Broderius M.A. Byersdorfer C.A. Eide D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 26092-26099Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and a high affinity system encoded byFET3 and FTR1 (2.Askwith C. Eide D. Van Ho A. Bernard P.S. Li L. Davis-Kaplan S. Sipe D.M. Kaplan J. Cell. 1994; 76: 403-410Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (588) Google Scholar, 3.Stearman R. Yuan D.S. Yamaguchi-Iwai Y. Klausner R.D. Dancis A. Science. 1996; 271: 1552-1557Crossref PubMed Scopus (582) Google Scholar). Both transport systems require the action of surface reductases (FRE1 andFRE2) to reduce Fe(III) to the more soluble Fe(II) (4.Dancis A. Klausner R.D. Hinnebusch A.G. Barriocanal J.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 2294-2301Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar,5.Georgatsou E. Alexandraki D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 3065-3073Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). Reduction followed by transport of elemental iron is only one of the strategies that organisms use to accumulate iron. Most bacteria and fungi synthesize and secrete siderophores, low molecular weight compounds that specifically bind ferric iron. Siderophores bind ferric iron with high affinity, and the siderophore-iron complex can be captured by specific cellular transport systems. Most bacteria and fungi synthesize at least one type of siderophore but may express transporters specific to that siderophore as well as to siderophores secreted by other species (6.Byers B.R. Arceneaux J.E.L. Sigel A. Sigel H. Iron Transport and Storage in Microorganisms, Plants, and Animals. 35. Marcel Dekker, New York1998: 37-66Google Scholar). Prokaryotic mechanisms of siderophore uptake are well described (7.Braun V. Hantke K. Koster W. Met. Ions Biol. Syst. 1998; 35: 67-145PubMed Google Scholar), but much less is known about eukaryotic siderophore utilization (8.Leong S.A. Winkelmann G. Sigel A. Sigel H. Iron Transport and Storage in Microorganisms, Plants, and Animals. 35. Marcel Dekker, New York1998: 147-186Google Scholar). Although neither budding nor fission yeast secrete siderophores, they are capable of taking up siderophore-bound iron (9.Neilands J.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 26723-26726Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1231) Google Scholar, 10.Lesuisse E. Raguzzi F. Crichton R.R. J. Gen. Microbiol. 1987; 133: 3229-3236PubMed Google Scholar). The high affinity transport system for elemental iron in S. cerevisiae is under the control of the iron-dependent transcriptional regulator, Aft1p (11.Yamaguchi-Iwai Y. Dancis A. Klausner R.D. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 1231-1239Crossref PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar, 12.Yamaguchi-Iwai Y. Stearman R. Dancis A. Klausner R.D. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 3377-3384Crossref PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar). Through the use of cDNA microarrays representing virtually the entire genome of S. cerevisiae, we have identified genes that are regulated according to iron availability and Aft1p expression. Here, we report that four homologous members of the major facilitator superfamily of transporters are transcriptionally regulated by Aft1p. One of these,ARN3, is identical to SIT1, a gene reported to have a role in ferrioxamine B-mediated iron transport (13.Lesuisse E. Simon-Casteras M. Labbe P. Microbiology. 1998; 144: 3455-3462Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). Ferrioxamine B is a hydroxamate-type siderophore that is synthesized and secreted in its iron-free form, desferrioxamine B (DFO),1 by several species of actinomycetes (14.Albrect-Gary A. Crumbliss A.L. Sigel A. Sigel H. Iron Transport and Storage in Microorganisms, Plants, and Animals. 35. Marcel Dekker, New York1998: 239-328Google Scholar). Here we demonstrate that both ARN3 andFET3 can facilitate the uptake of DFO-bound iron (DFO-Fe). We further demonstrate that although Fet3p is localized to the cell surface, Arn3p is found predominantly in intracellular, post-Golgi vesicles. Strain DBY7286 (MATa ura3 GAL) and congenic aft1 mutants were used for cDNA microarray analysis and were constructed as described (15.Philpott C.C. Rashford J. Yamaguchi-Iwai Y. Rouault T.A. Dancis A. Klausner R.D. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 5026-5036Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). All other strains were constructed in YPH499 MATa ura3-52 lys2-801(amber) ade2-101(ochre) trp1-Δ63 his3-Δ200 leu2-Δ1(Yeast Genetic Stock Center, Berkeley, CA). PCR-mediated gene disruption was used to generate deletions of the ARN genes (16.Schneider B.L. Steiner B. Seufert W. Futcher A.B. Yeast. 1996; 12: 129-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). The following primers were used to amplify the HISG-URA3-HISG cassette from the plasmid pMPY-ZAP: for ARN1, 5′-GGGAATGGAACACGAGTTGAATCCTGAGACTCATAACGATTCCAACTCCGACTCCTCACTATAGGGCGAATTGG-3′ and 5′-CGTGTCGACATATTCGCCATCCTCGATGTATTCCACAGCAACAGTATCAGTCCTAAAGGGAACAAAAGCT-3′; for ARN2, 5′-GTAATGAACTGATGGTTGATGAAAAGAGGATGACGATTCGTCGCCCAGAGATGCTCACTATAGGGCGAATTGG-3′ and 5′-CCAGTCATTGATAGGATCATCTTCCTTGGTTTGGACATATTCTCTGTCAGGTAACCTAAAGGGAACAAAAGCTGG-3′; for ARN3, 5′-GACCCTGGTATTGCTAATCATACCCTCCCCGAGGAATTTGAAGAGGTTGTCCTCACTATAGGGCGAATTGG-3′ and 5′-CCAAACCTATGATACATAAAATCTTTTGAACATAGCGGTAAGACATGACTAAAGCCTAAAGGGAACAAAAGCT-3′; and for ARN4, 5′-TGACAATTTAGACGATAAAAGCACTGTCTGCTACAGCGAAAAGACAGATAGCCTCACTATAGGGCGAATTGG-3′ and 5′-TATCCAATTACACGACGGAGCCATGATTGTTGTTTGATTTTGAGCTTCTCTTCTAAAGGGAACAAAAGCT-3′. Deletions were confirmed by PCR and 5-fluoroorotic acid-resistant clones were selected. Construction of double, triple, and quadrupleARN deletion mutants was performed by repeated PCR-based gene disruption and by mating and sporulating single deletion strains. Deletion of FET3 was performed as described (3.Stearman R. Yuan D.S. Yamaguchi-Iwai Y. Klausner R.D. Dancis A. Science. 1996; 271: 1552-1557Crossref PubMed Scopus (582) Google Scholar). The strainYPH499 FET3-HA FTR1-myc, which constitutively overexpresses integrated copies of HA-tagged FET3 and myc-tagged FTR1 under the control of the phosphoglycerate kinase promoter, was constructed as described (17.Stearman R. Dancis A. Klausner R.D. Gene (Amst.). 1998; 212: 197-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). The ARN3-HA strain, which expresses a triple copy of the HA epitope fused to the carboxyl terminus of Arn3p, was constructed by PCR epitope tagging as described using the plasmid pMPY-3xHA (18.Schneider B.L. Seufert W. Steiner B. Yang Q.H. Futcher A.B. Yeast. 1995; 11: 1265-1274Crossref PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar) and the following primers: 5′-TTGAAAAATAAATTCTTTACGCACTTTACAAGCAGTAAAGATAGGAAAGATGAACAAAAGCTGGAGCTCCAC-3′ and 5′-ACTATGTAGTAGCTATATGTGCATGTATGAAATTATTTGGGTGAGATAATACTATAGGGCGAATTGGGTACC-3′. Integration of the HA epitope was confirmed by PCR and by Western blotting. The plasmid pARN3-HA was constructed by extracting genomic DNA from the ARN3-HA strain and digesting it with NruI andPstI. After electrophoresis, DNA fragments from 3.0 to 5.0 kb were extracted (GELase, Epicentre Technologies), ligated intoPstI- and SmaI-digested pRS415 (Stratagene), and used to transform Escherichia coli DH5-α. Clones were screened by colony hybridization using a 0.46-kb EcoRV fragment of ARN3, and positive clones were further analyzed by restriction mapping. Plasmid-encoded expression of Arn3p-HA was confirmed by Western blotting. Rich medium (YPD) and defined medium (SD) were prepared as described (19.Sherman F. Guthrie C. Fink G. Guide to Yeast Genetics and Molecular Biology. 194. Academic Press, New York1991: 3-20Google Scholar). Defined iron media were prepared as described (15.Philpott C.C. Rashford J. Yamaguchi-Iwai Y. Rouault T.A. Dancis A. Klausner R.D. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 5026-5036Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Strains were cultured in the exponential phase of growth for more than five generations in either SD complete medium or defined iron media with 20 μm (low iron), 100 μm (optimal iron), or 500 μm (high iron) added ferrous ammonium sulfate. Low iron and high iron culture conditions were selected in which the rate was of growth was moderately but not severely (< 2-fold difference when compared with the optimal iron condition) affected by iron limitation or excess (data not shown). Cultures were harvested at a uniform cell density of 1 × 107 cells/ml. Total RNA was extracted using Trizol (Life Technologies, Inc.) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Probe preparation, microarray production, hybridization, and data analysis were performed as described (20.DeRisi J.L. Iyer V.R. Brown P.O. Science. 1997; 278: 680-686Crossref PubMed Scopus (3707) Google Scholar, 21.Spellman P.T. Sherlock G. Zhang M.Q. Iyer V.R. Anders K. Eisen M.B. Brown P.O. Botstein D. Futcher B. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1998; 9: 3273-3297Crossref PubMed Scopus (3915) Google Scholar). Yeast were grown to mid-log phase in SD medium or defined iron media containing the indicated amount of ferrous iron. Total RNA was extracted using Trizol (Life Technologies, Inc.), and Northern blot analysis was performed as described (11.Yamaguchi-Iwai Y. Dancis A. Klausner R.D. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 1231-1239Crossref PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar). Probes for the ARN genes were as follows: for ARN1, a 1.15-kb HincII fragment; for ARN2, a 0.8-kbNdeI fragment; for ARN3, a 0.46-kbEcoRV fragment; and for ARN4, a 0.7-kbAlwNI fragment. Restriction fragments were isolated from a PCR-amplified product corresponding to the open reading frame of eachARN gene. For the plate assay, modified synthetic complete media were used in which copper and iron were omitted and 1 μm copper sulfate and 100 μm bathophenanthroline sulfonate (BPS, a ferrous iron chelator that is not taken up by yeast) were added. Trace amounts of iron are supplied by agar (Difco). Desferrioxamine B+ plates also included 100 μm of the mesylate derivative of DFO (Desferal, Sigma). Yeast strains were grown for 24 h on plates of defined-iron media (approximately 10 μm iron) to deplete intracellular iron stores. Cells were then suspended in water at 2 × 106 cells/ml, plated in serial 10-fold dilutions, and incubated at 30 °C for 3 days prior to imaging. Ferrous iron uptake assays were performed as described using 1 μm55Fe, except that washes were omitted and cells were spun through a column of 10% bovine serum albumin before scintillation counting (22.Dancis A. Yuan D.S. Haile D. Askwith C. Elde D. Moehle C. Kaplan J. Klausner R.D. Cell. 1994; 76: 393-402Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (568) Google Scholar). For DFO uptake assays, 1 μm ferric55Fe and 1 μm DFO were used. Strains were grown to mid-log phase in defined iron media containing 10 μm ferrous ammonium sulfate to induce the expression of Arn3. Cells were washed and prepared for immunofluorescence microscopy as described (3.Stearman R. Yuan D.S. Yamaguchi-Iwai Y. Klausner R.D. Dancis A. Science. 1996; 271: 1552-1557Crossref PubMed Scopus (582) Google Scholar). Primary antibody was affinity purified HA.11 (BAbCo) at 1:500, and secondary antibody was Cy3-conjugated polyclonal anti-mouse IgG from donkey (Jackson Immunoresearch) at 1:500. Cells were imaged on a Nikon photomicroscope equipped with 100×/1.3NA objective with Nomarski optics. Images were acquired using IP Labs software and a CCD camera (Princeton Instruments). Susceptibility to external protease in living cells was performed essentially as described (23.Nothwehr S.F. Conibear E. Stevens T.H. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 129: 35-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). Washed cells were resuspended at 2 × 107 cells/ml and incubated for 1 h with 2 mg/ml proteinase K or for 20 min with 0.7 mg/ml Pronase prior to lysis. Cells were lysed on ice in 1.85 m NaOH and 1% 2-mercaptoethanol for 10 min followed by precipitation on ice in 25% trichloroacetic acid for 30 min. Precipitates were resuspended in SDS sample buffer containing 0.1 m Tris base before SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Western blotting was performed using a 1:2000 dilution of HA.11 ascites (BAbCo). The secondary antibody consisted of anti-mouse IgG conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) diluted 1:3000 and was detected by chemiluminescence (Pierce), according to the manufacturer's protocols. Cell cultures were grown to an A 600 of 1.0 in iron limiting conditions (CM + BPS 40 μm). Briefly, cells were washed, spheroplasted, and processed as described previously (24.Radisky D.C. Babcock M.C. Kaplan J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 4497-4499Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). Membranes were applied to an 0–25% Iodixanol (Life Technologies) gradient, which was centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 2 h and then fractionated. Samples from each fraction were loaded on a 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, which was transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane. The localization of fractions containing mitochondria, vacuoles, endoplasmic reticulum, and late endosomes was determined by Western analysis using antibodies against mitochondrial porin (Molecular Probes), carboxypeptidase Y (Molecular Probes), dolichol phosphate mannose synthetase (Molecular Probes), and Pep12 (a gift of Dr. Scott Emr, UCSD), respectively. The refractive index of each fraction was determined by a Bausch and Lomb refractometer. cDNA microarray analysis was performed to examine the yeast genome for new genes involved in iron metabolism (20.DeRisi J.L. Iyer V.R. Brown P.O. Science. 1997; 278: 680-686Crossref PubMed Scopus (3707) Google Scholar, 21.Spellman P.T. Sherlock G. Zhang M.Q. Iyer V.R. Anders K. Eisen M.B. Brown P.O. Botstein D. Futcher B. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1998; 9: 3273-3297Crossref PubMed Scopus (3915) Google Scholar). This technique allows each gene in the yeast genome to be analyzed for differences in mRNA transcript levels when a pair of strains or culture conditions is compared. We compared mRNA obtained from yeast expressing a constitutively active allele of AFT1,AFT1–1 up, and a congenic strain with theAFT1 gene deleted, aft1Δ. Expression ofAFT1–1 up results in high levels of transcription of the genes of high affinity iron uptake, and a failure of these genes to be repressed by exogenous iron (11.Yamaguchi-Iwai Y. Dancis A. Klausner R.D. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 1231-1239Crossref PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar). Conversely, inaft1Δ strains, transcription of genes involved in high affinity iron uptake is greatly reduced, even under conditions of iron depletion. Genes were identified in microarrays that were more highly expressed in an AFT1–1 up strain than in theaft1Δ strain. Similar comparisons were made betweenAFT1–1 up and wild type strains and between wild type strains grown in reduced amounts of iron or increased amounts of iron (Fig. 1 A). Four of the genes identified in this fashion, YHL040C, YHL047C, YEL065W, and YOL158C, were chosen for further study. These genes are predicted to encode highly homologous members of a subfamily of the major facilitator superfamily of transporters (25.Pao S.S. Paulsen I.T. Saier Jr., M.H. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 1998; 62: 1-34Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 26.Nelissen B. De Wachter R. Goffeau A. FEMS Microbiol. Rev. 1997; 21: 113-134Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 27.Goffeau A. Park J. Paulsen I.T. Jonniaux J.L. Dinh T. Mordant P. Saier Jr., M.H. Yeast. 1997; 13: 43-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). Two other members of this subfamily, YKR106W and YCL073C, were not differentially expressed in the arrays. The DNA regions upstream of the open reading frames of YHL040C, YHL047C, YEL065W, and YOL158C were analyzed, and all were found to contain AFT1 consensus binding sites (12.Yamaguchi-Iwai Y. Stearman R. Dancis A. Klausner R.D. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 3377-3384Crossref PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar) within 500 nucleotides of the start codon, as would be expected forAFT1-regulated genes (Fig. 1 B). These genes were designated ARN1, 2, 3, and4, respectively. A comparison of the predicted amino acid sequences of these genes (Fig.1 C) revealed that the overall sequence identity ranges from 26 to 53%, with ARN1 and ARN2 showing the greatest sequence identity and ARN4 the least. The predicted proteins have 14 membrane-spanning domains, and both the amino and carboxyl termini are predicted to be cytosolic. To confirm the results of the cDNA microarrays, iron- and AFT1-dependent regulation of the mRNA levels ofARN1–4 were examined by Northern blot analysis (Fig.2). The transcript profile for all fourARN genes was found to be similar. In the wild type strain,ARN transcript levels were high when cells were grown in iron-limited media and greatly reduced when higher concentrations of iron were present (lanes 1–7). The effects of expression of different AFT1 alleles on ARN transcript levels was examined in cells grown in iron replete media (lanes 8–10). In these media, AFT1-dependent transcription is low, as are high affinity iron uptake and surface reductase activities (data not shown). ARN transcript levels were low in both AFT1 and aft1Δ strains (lanes 8 and 9). In contrast, ARNtranscripts were abundant in an AFT1–1 up strain (lane 10). These results suggest that transcription ofARN1–4 is a direct consequence of AFT1activation and is not a secondary result of iron deprivation. ARN3 was reported to be involved in the transport of the hydroxamate siderophore DFO-Fe (13.Lesuisse E. Simon-Casteras M. Labbe P. Microbiology. 1998; 144: 3455-3462Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). To determine the genetic requirements for growth with DFO-Fe as an iron source, we examined the capacity of DFO-Fe to supply iron to yeast strains with deletions in ARN genes (Fig.3). Both ARN + andarnΔ strains showed decreased growth on iron-limited media. A deletion in the high affinity iron transport system (fet3Δ; Fig. 3 B) resulted in no detectable growth in iron-limited medium. Both ARN+ andarn-deleted strains grew well in iron-limited medium when DFO-Fe was added as an iron source (Fig. 3 C). Strains with a functional high affinity iron transport system also were able to grow in DFO-Fe medium when the ARN genes were deleted in combination (pairs, triplets, or quadruplicate; data not shown). Deletion of FET3 had no effect on growth in DFO-Fe media in an ARN + strain or when ARN1,2, or 4 was deleted (Fig. 3 D). Deletion of ARN3 in a fet3Δ strain, however, completely prevented growth on DFO-Fe. Expression of ARN3 by either a high or low copy number plasmid completely restored growth on DFO-Fe medium, whereas expression of ARN1 from a high copy number plasmid did not complement the growth deficit (data not shown). These data suggest the existence of two independent systems for the transport of iron bound to DFO: one system that requires the high affinity iron transporter composed of FET3 andFTR1 and a second system that requires ARN3. We measured the cellular uptake of iron as Fe(II) and as DFO-Fe(III) in ARN deletion strains (Fig. 4). Deletion of individual ARN genes had no effect on the rate of Fe(II) uptake in strains expressing FET3 (Fig. 4 A). In contrast, the rate of uptake of iron from DFO-Fe was similar in wild type cells and Δfet3 cells but was reduced 4-fold inarn3Δ cells and was virtually undetectable in anarn3Δ fet3Δ strain (Fig. 4 B). Again, these data indicate that uptake of DFO-bound iron is dependent on eitherFET3 or ARN3. Transport of iron through the high affinity system occurs at the plasma membrane. Both components of the high affinity iron transport system, the permease (Ftr1p) and oxidase (Fet3p), have been localized to the plasma membrane by immunological methods (3.Stearman R. Yuan D.S. Yamaguchi-Iwai Y. Klausner R.D. Dancis A. Science. 1996; 271: 1552-1557Crossref PubMed Scopus (582) Google Scholar, 28.Askwith C.C. Kaplan J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 22415-22419Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 29.De Silva D.M. Askwith C.C. Eide D. Kaplan J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 1098-1101Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). We performed indirect immunofluorescence to determine whether DFO-mediated iron transport occurs at the plasma membrane. Strains were constructed in which the chromosomal copy of ARN3 carried a triple-copy of the HA epitope at the carboxyl terminus or which contained an integrated copy of an overexpression cassette of HA-tagged FET3 and Myc epitope-tagged FTR1 (Fig. 5). We confirmed that the epitope-tagged version of ARN3 was functional by cloning the HA-tagged allele into a low copy number plasmid and observing complementation of both the growth defect on DFO and the uptake defect of DFO-Fe iron of an Δarn3 Δfet3strain (data not shown). When the strains were grown in media containing limiting amounts of iron to induce ARN3expression, HA-tagged Arn3p was not detected on the plasma membrane but rather in multiple, small, intracellular vesicles that tended to cluster at the periphery of the cell (Fig. 5, A–E). In contrast, HA-tagged Fet3p was detected predominantly on the plasma membrane, although some intracellular signal was detected as well (Fig.5, G–I). The cellular localization of Arn3p may have been altered by fixation and antibody binding procedures. Unfortunately, when green fluorescent protein was fused to either the amino- or carboxyl terminus of ARN3, the cleaved green fluorescent protein moiety appeared in the lumen of the vacuole, thus precluding the visualization of Arn3p in living cells (data not shown). To determine whether Arn3p was expressed on the plasma membrane, we treated intact cells with extracellular proteases and analyzed lysates by Western blotting (Fig.6). As expected, Fet3p-HA was sensitive to extracellular proteases and was detected as an approximately 16-kDa fragment after protease digestion (lanes 9 and10). In contrast, Arn3p-HA was highly resistant to extracellular protease (lanes 5 and 6) but was completely degraded by protease in the presence of detergent (lane 8). The susceptibility of Arn3p-HA to external protease was not altered when cells were grown in the presence of DFO, suggesting that Arn3p is not recruited to the plasma membrane in the presence of its transport substrate. These data confirm that the majority of Fet3p is localized to the plasma membrane in living cells and suggests that the majority of Arn3p is sequestered in an intracellular compartment. To characterize the Arn3p-containing intracellular vesicles, we fractionated Arn3p-HA-expressing cells and separated subcellular organelles by density gradient centrifugation. Western blot analysis demonstrated that Arn3p-HA was not associated with vacuoles (Cpy1), endoplasmic reticulum (Dpm1), or mitochondria (Fig.7, Porin). The distribution of Arn3p, however, was coincident with that of Pep12p, a protein enriched in late endosomes/prevacuoles (30.Becherer K.A. Rieder S.E. Emr S.D. Jones E.W. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1996; 7: 579-594Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar). These results confirm the immunofluorescence studies and indicate that Arn3p is localized primarily in intracellular vesicles. We have used microarray technology to identify four highly homologous genes that are regulated by the iron-dependent transcription factor Aft1p. Although one of the genes, ARN3(SIT1), was previously reported to exhibit anAFT1-independent pattern of iron regulation and not to contain an AFT1 consensus binding site (13.Lesuisse E. Simon-Casteras M. Labbe P. Microbiology. 1998; 144: 3455-3462Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar), our results show that ARN3 is iron- and AFT1-regulated. Transcriptional regulation by AFT1 was confirmed by Northern analysis, and inspection of upstream sequences indicate an Aft1p consensus binding site for each of the ARN genes (12.Yamaguchi-Iwai Y. Stearman R. Dancis A. Klausner R.D. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 3377-3384Crossref PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar, 31.Lin S.J. Pufahl R.A. Dancis A. O'Halloran T.V. Culotta V.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 9215-9220Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (357) Google Scholar). The ARN genes were grouped as members of the major facilitator superfamily of transporters on the basis of their predicted amino acid sequences (25.Pao S.S. Paulsen I.T. Saier Jr., M.H. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 1998; 62: 1-34Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 26.Nelissen B. De Wachter R. Goffeau A. FEMS Microbiol. Rev. 1997; 21: 113-134Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 27.Goffeau A. Park J. Paulsen I.T. Jonniaux J.L. Dinh T. Mordant P. Saier Jr., M.H. Yeast. 1997; 13: 43-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). Walker A and Walker B motifs are absent, indicating that these potential permeases are not ATP-binding cassette-type transporters and likely require proton symport to energize the transport of substrate. Members of this gene family have 12–14 membrane-spanning domains and function as uniporters, symporters, and antiporters of a variety of small molecules, including drugs, sugars, and amino acids. The ARN genes are predicted to have 14 transmembrane domains, a less common feature of the major facilitator superfamily transporters that is shared by the multidrug proton antiporter subfamily. Interestingly, these two subfamilies also transport the largest substrates of any of the major facilitator superfamily subfamilies, as siderophores are approximately 500–1000M r and the larger drugs 400–500M r. Very little is known about siderophore uptake in eukaryotes, although the process has been studied in detail in prokaryotes (7.Braun V. Hantke K. Koster W. Met. Ions Biol. Syst. 1998; 35: 67-145PubMed Google Scholar). In theE. coli K-12 strain, a single siderophore, enterobactin, is synthesized and secreted, whereas six different iron-siderophore uptake systems have been identified, each one specific for a different siderophore. The sequence and predicted structure of the ARN family of transporters, however, do not resemble those of prokaryotic siderophore transporters; presumably eukaryotes have evolved distinct mechanisms for siderophore-mediated iron uptake. The fungus Ustilago maydis exhibits two different pathways of siderophore-mediated iron uptake (32.Ardon O. Weizman H. Libman J. Shanzer A. Chen Y. Hadar Y. Microbiology. 1997; 143: 3625-3631Crossref Scopus (25) Google Scholar, 33.Ardon O. Nudelman R. Caris C. Libman J. Shanzer A. Chen Y. Hadar Y. J.

Xenosiderophores, such as ferrioxamine B, as well as the native siderophore ferrichrome A, do not cross the plasma membrane but are bound at the cell suface where the iron is reduced extracellularly before entering the cell. The capacity of microbes to take up iron from siderophores that are secreted by other species appears to be well conserved and likely provides a selective advantage in a natural environment where many species compete for nutrients. Our studies indicate that S. cerevisiae has two different systems of DFO-mediated iron transport: one that requires theFET3-dependent, high affinity, iron transport system and a second that requires ARN3. In the first system, DFO-Fe could act as a substrate for surface reductases, releasing Fe(II), which is then taken up by the high affinity iron transport system. This transport system is independent of the ARNgenes. The second transport system for DFO-Fe only becomes apparent in the absence of Fet3p. This transport system is specific forARN3; deletion of the other highly homologous ARNgenes either singly or in combination does not lead to a defect in DFO-Fe transport. Our finding that Arn3p (and other ARN family members; data not shown) is primarily localized to endosome-like vesicles indicates that ARN3-dependent uptake differs fromFET3-dependent uptake. Arn3p was localized by immunofluorescence and biochemical techniques to intracellular vesicles. Although our data cannot exclude the possibility that a small amount of Arn3p localized to the cell surface, it clearly shows that the bulk of the protein is present in an intracellular organelle. This result suggests two possibilities: 1) that Arn3p localizes briefly to the cell surface, where it facilitates DFO-Fe tranport, before being internalized or 2) that DFO-Fe is delivered to Arn3p in an intracellular, metal-exchanging compartment. The entry of DFO-Fe could occur by fluid phase endocytosis, or alternatively, DFO-Fe chelates may be recognized by specific binding proteins at the plasma membrane, which are then internalized. In either case, the site of iron release may be the intracellular vesicle. A precedent for this system of intravesicular iron release occurs in mammalian transferrin-dependent iron uptake (34.Aisen P. Met. Ions Biol. Syst. 1998; 35: 585-631PubMed Google Scholar). In this system, the “siderophore” is transferrin, which binds with high affinity to Fe(III) in the extracellular fluid. Diferric transferrin then binds to the transferrin receptor on the plasma membrane, and the complex is internalized via receptor-mediated endocytosis. Iron is released from transferrin within the endocytic vesicle and reduced, Fe(II) is transported across the endosomal membrane by the permease DMT1. If siderophore-iron uptake in budding yeast is similar to transferrin-iron uptake in mammalian cells, then a testable prediction is that an intracellular ferrireductase may exist. Studies that test this prediction are in progress. We thank Robert Stearman and Richard Klausner for the gift of plasmids."

FEN1 apparently tracks along the flap from the 5′-end to the cleavage site. Proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) stimulates FEN1 cleavage 5–50-fold. To determine whether tracking, binding, or cleavage is enhanced by PCNA, we tested a variety of flap substrates. Similar levels of PCNA stimulation occur on both a cleavage-sensitive nicked substrate and a less sensitive gapped substrate. PCNA stimulates FEN1 irrespective of the flap length. Stimulation occurs on a pseudo-Y substrate that exhibits upstream primer-independent cleavage. A pseudo-Y substrate with a sequence requiring an upstream primer for cleavage was not activated by PCNA, suggesting that PCNA does not compensate for substrate features that inhibit cleavage. A biotin·streptavidin conjugation at the 5′-end of a flap structure prevents FEN1 loading. The addition of PCNA does not restore FEN1 activity. These results indicate that PCNA does not direct FEN1 to the cleavage site from solution. Kinetic analyses reveal that PCNA can lower the K m for FEN1 by 11–12-fold. Overall, our results indicate that after FEN1 tracks to the cleavage site, PCNA enhances FEN1 binding stability, allowing for greater cleavage efficiency.

Reconstitution reactions in vitro with either calf or human FEN1 illustrate the need for this nuclease during Okazaki fragment processing (6.Turchi J.J. Huang L. Murante R.S. Kim Y. Bambara R.A.

Chem. 1998; 273: 8842-8848Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, a null mutant of the FEN1 homolog (RAD27/RTH1) exhibits slow growth, methyl methanesulfonate sensitivity, and hyper-recombination (9.Sommers C.H. Miller E.J. Dujon B. Prakash S. Prakash L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 4193-4196Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). These phenotypes are consistent with participation of FEN1 in both DNA replication and repair. Analysis of the complex substrate specificity of FEN1 aids in understanding its biological function. As a 5′-exonuclease, FEN1 can cleave either DNA or RNA-DNA primers annealed to templates (10.Huang L. Rumbaugh J.A. Murante R.S. Lin R.J.R. Rust L. Bambara R.A. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 9266-9277Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). The presence of a primer bound immediately upstream of the cleavage site may stimulate, inhibit, or not affect FEN1 cleavage depending on the local sequence (10.Huang L. Rumbaugh J.A. Murante R.S. Lin R.J.R. Rust L. Bambara R.A. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 9266-9277Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Remarkably, FEN1 cleaves substrates with an unannealed 5′-tail or flap structure more efficiently than exonuclease substrates (11.Harrington J.J. Lieber M.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 4503-4508Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Cleavage of a flap structure occurs at or near the point where the flap is annealed to the template strand. A specific feature of the FEN1 cleavage mechanism is that the nuclease appears to track on the flap to reach the cleavage site (2.Harrington J.J. Lieber M.R.

This arch may be utilized by the nuclease to recognize the 5′-end of an unannealed flap and to track along the flap structure. Mutational analyses of the loop region in the M. jannaschii FEN1 indicate that this physical structure is critical for both the binding and cleaving of flap substrates (17.Hwang K.Y. Baek K. Kim H.Y. Cho Y. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1998; 5: 707-713Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). PCNA has been found to be a potent stimulator of FEN1 cleavage activity (13.Wu X. Li J. Li X. Hsieh C.L.

Biophys. Acta. 1991; 1088: 11-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). It is a toroidal homotrimer that is assembled around double-stranded DNA to form a sliding clamp (22.Kelman Z. Oncogene. 1997; 14: 629-640Crossref PubMed Scopus (721) Google Scholar). Biochemical and genetic analyses have shown that FEN1 interacts with a hydrophobic cleft located on the front face of the PCNA toroid (13.Wu X. Li J. Li X. Hsieh C.L. Burgers P.M. Lieber M.R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 2036-2043Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar, 20.Li X. Li J. Harrington J. Lieber M.R. Burgers P.M.J. J. Biol.

Interaction of PCNA with both polymerases and FEN1 suggests that it recruits FEN1 to the protein complex at the replication fork in vivo (25.Hosfield D.J. Frank G. Weng Y. Tainer J.A. Shen B. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 27154-27161Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). PCNA also interacts with the regulatory protein p21Cip1, which is induced when chromosomal DNA is damaged (26.Waga S. Hannon G.J. Beach D. Stillman B. Nature. 1994; 369: 574-578Crossref PubMed Scopus (1587) Google Scholar, 27.Podust V.N. Podust L.M. Goubin F. Ducommun B. Hübscher U.

Chem. 1997; 272: 24522-24529Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). Because p21Cip1 uses the same binding site on PCNA as replication proteins, it has been postulated that binding of this regulatory protein inactivates the replication complex while the chromosomal DNA is being repaired (23.Chen U.

Reconstitution reactions have revealed more about how FEN1 is employed in DNA metabolism. Okazaki fragment processing involves the coordinated action of a DNA polymerase, RNase HI, FEN1, PCNA, and DNA ligase I (3.Bambara R.A. Murante R.S. Henricksen L.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 4647-4650Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar). On the lagging strand of a replication fork, RNase HI removes the initiator RNA primer on an Okazaki fragment leaving a single 5′-ribonucleotide. FEN1 subsequently removes the 5′-ribonucleotide, and the resulting nick is sealed by DNA ligase I. Base excision repair pathways are responsible for replacing thousands of damaged nucleotides/mammalian cell/day (31.Lindahl T. Nature. 1993; 362: 709-715Crossref PubMed Scopus (4342) Google Scholar). One of the pathways, long patch base excision repair, utilizes many of the components of Okazaki fragment processing including FEN1 (8.Kim K. Biade S. Matsumoto Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 8842-8848Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar, 32.DeMott M.S. Shen B. Park M.S. Bambara R.A. Zigman S. J. Biol.

Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 3575-3580Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). Bases altered by ionizing radiation, oxidation, or alkylating agents are often targeted. During the repair process, the damaged base is removed by a DNA N-glycosylase to create an abasic site. An apurinic/apyrimidinic endonuclease then cleaves on the 5′-side of the abasic sugar by making a nick with a deoxyribose phosphate at the 5′-side. The damaged residue and additional downstream nucleotides are lifted to form a flap, and the abasic residue is endonucleolytically removed as part of an oligomer (8.Kim K. Biade S. Matsumoto Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 8842-8848Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar, 32.DeMott M.S. Shen B. Park M.S. Bambara R.A. Zigman S. J. Biol.

The resulting short gap is filled and ligated to complete the repair process. PCNA has been found to facilitate excision in long patch base excision repair through interactions with FEN1 (37.Gary R. Kim K. Cornelius H.L. Park M.S. Matsumoto Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 4354-4363Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). Hübscher and colleagues have shown that PCNA stimulation of FEN1 was inhibited on a linear flap substrate with biotin·streptavidin conjugated to the upstream region of the template (24.Jonsson Z.O. Hindges R. Hübscher U. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 2412-2425Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar). Conjugation of a biotin·streptavidin moiety to the downstream region did not result in any inhibition (24.Jonsson Z.O. Hindges R. Hübscher U. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 2412-2425Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar). This indicates that PCNA enters the template upstream of the flap for stimulation. The subsequent interaction with FEN1 and the stimulation reaction is the subject of our investigation. Given the complex mechanism of FEN1 cleavage, PCNA may affect the tracking, binding, or catalytic properties of FEN1. Determining how a protein on the double-stranded primer template upstream of the flap stimulates a protein thought to enter the substrate by tracking on the flap will be important for elucidating the biological relevance of this interaction. All oligonucleotides were synthesized by Genosys Biotechnologies (The Woodlands, TX). Radionucleotides [γ-32P]ATP (6000 Ci/mmol) and [α-32P]dCTP (6000 Ci/mmol) were obtained from New England Nuclear. The acrylamide sequencing gel mix and T4 polynucleotide kinase were from Roche Diagnostics. Sequenase (version 2.0) was obtained from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. Micro Bio-Spin 30 chromatography columns were from Bio-Rad. All other reagents were the best available commercial grade. Recombinant human FEN1 was expressed and purified fromEscherichia coli utilizing the T7 expression plasmid pET-FCH (38.Bornarth C.J. Ranalli T.A. Henricksen L.A. Wahl A.F. Bambara R.A. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 13347-13354Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Recombinant PCNA was expressed in E. coli using the expression vector pT7/PCNA (39.Fien K. Stillman B. Mol. Cell.

Biol. 1992; 12: 155-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). Purified enzymes were dialyzed into a storage buffer (20% glycerol, 30 mm KCl, 30 mm HEPES (pH 7.6) (diluted from a 1 m stock), 0.01% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 1 mm EDTA) and stored at −80 °C. Oligomer sequences are listed in Table I, and the primer-template substrates were constructed as described in the figure legends. In all substrates, the 3′-end regions of the downstream primers share homology with the 5′-ends of their respective templates. Once annealed, these primers create substrates with unannealed 5′-tails as illustrated in the figures. Each respective upstream primer was annealed to the proper template to create a nick or a gap at the base of the unannealed 5′-tail of the downstream primer. Prior to annealing, the 5′-radiolabeled primers were generated utilizing [γ-32P]ATP and T4 polynucleotide kinase according to the manufacturer's instructions. Downstream primer D6 was annealed to T2 and radiolabeled at the 3′-end using [α-32P]dCTP and Sequenase (version 2.0). Unincorporated radionucleotides were removed with Micro Bio-Spin 30 chromatography columns. All radiolabeled primers were purified by gel isolation from either a 12 or 15% polyacrylamide, 7 m urea denaturing gel prior to annealing. Substrates were annealed by mixing 0.5 pmol of the respective downstream primer with 2 pmol of the corresponding template in annealing buffer (10 mm Tris base, 50 mmKCl, and 1 mm EDTA (pH 8.0)) to a final volume of 50 μl. The mixture was heated to 65 °C for 10 min and allowed to cool to room temperature. If present, a corresponding upstream primer (10 pmol) was added and annealed by incubating at 37 °C for 1 h.Table IOligonucleotide sequences (5′-3′)Downstream PrimersaThe underlined nucleotide represents the first position annealed to a template.

Open table in a new tab Reactions containing the indicated amounts of substrate, FEN1, and PCNA were performed in a buffer containing 30 mm HEPES (pH 7.6), 5% glycerol, 40 mm KCl, 0.1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, and 8 mm MgCl2. Reactions were incubated at 37 or 25 °C as indicated in the figure legends, terminated with 20 μl of formamide dye (90% formamide (v/v) with bromphenol blue and xylene cyanol), and heated to 95 °C for 5 min. After separation on a 12% polyacrylamide, 7 m urea denaturing gel, products were detected by autoradiography or PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics) analysis. For the biotin·streptavidin assay, the initial reaction mixtures lacked Mg2+. The substrate was incubated with enzyme either before or after the addition of streptavidin. Reactions contained 100 fmol of FEN1. Streptavidin, added in a 50-fold molar excess over substrate, was complexed with the biotinylated substrate by placing the reaction at 37 °C for 10 min. MgCl2 was then added to 8 mm, and enzyme activity was assayed as described above. Assays were performed at least in triplicate. FEN1 cleavage kinetics were performed at 25 °C according to the standard conditions described in the enzyme assay. Varying concentrations of DNA substrate (5, 10, 15, and 20 fmol) comprised of D4:U3:T1 and a constant amount of FEN1 (5 fmol) were utilized. Assays were performed at least in triplicate. Reactions in the absence of PCNA were initiated by sequentially combining standard reaction buffer, substrate, and enzyme. In the reactions with PCNA, 5 pmol of PCNA were added prior to the addition of FEN1. Samples were mixed, and 20-μl aliquots were removed at 0, 0.5, 1, 2, 4, and 8 min. The initial velocity was determined by measuring the substrate and product intensities on a 12% polyacrylamide, 7 m urea denaturing gel by means of PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics) analysis. The general expression for the velocity of the reaction is v =d[P]/dt, where [P] = product concentration in nm. The product concentration was calculated using the equation [P] = {IP /(IS +IP)} × [substrate], whereIP = product intensity,IS = starting material intensity, and substrate concentration is expressed in nm. Velocity is expressed as converted substrate concentration (nM)/time (s). K mand V max values were calculated by directly fitting the data to the Michaelis-Menten equation. Reactions were performed in a buffer containing 30 mm HEPES (pH 7.6), 5% glycerol, 40 mm KCl, 0.1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, and 8 mm CaCl2 in a final reaction volume of 20 μl. Reactions were incubated at 25 °C for 8 min. After separation on a 0.7% agarose gel in 0.1× TBE (8.9 mm Tris base, 8.9 mm boric acid, and 0.2 mm EDTA (pH 8.0)), products were visualized using a PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics). Previous studies have demonstrated that PCNA stimulates FEN1 cleavage activity on flap substrates (13.Wu X. Li J. Li X. Hsieh C.L. Burgers P.M. Lieber M.R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 2036-2043Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar, 20.Li X. Li J. Harrington J. Lieber M.R. Burgers P.M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 22109-22112Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar). These substrates commonly have a nick between the 3′-end of the upstream primer and the annealing point of the downstream primer. On many substrates, creating a short gap between the upstream primer and the base of the flap inhibits FEN1 cleavage (40.Murante R.S. Huang L. Turchi J.J. Bambara R.A. J. Biol.

We considered that PCNA might overcome the inhibitory effects of a gap. If so, PCNA would stimulate FEN1 cleavage activity on a gapped substrate to the level observed for a nicked substrate with PCNA. Alternatively, PCNA might stimulate little, if at all, on the gapped substrate. Because Hübscher and colleagues proposed that PCNA enters a substrate upstream of the flap for stimulation of FEN1 (24.Jonsson Z.O. Hindges R. Hübscher U. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 2412-2425Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar), complete double-stranded structure upstream of the flap may be required for PCNA to affect FEN1. Fig.1 A is a time course showing the stimulation of FEN1 cleavage by PCNA on a 25-nucleotide flap substrate with a nick separating the upstream primer and the base of the flap. FEN1 cleavage yields 25- and 26-nucleotide products (lanes 1–6). The addition of PCNA resulted in an approximate 8-fold stimulation of cleavage (lanes 7–12). Decreasing the size of the upstream primer to make a 1-nucleotide gap greatly decreased the susceptibility of the substrate to cleavage by FEN1. As seen in Fig. 1 B, PCNA stimulated FEN1, and in fact, the approximate 16-fold stimulation is an even greater percentage than that observed on the flap substrate with a nick. However, the overall amount of substrate converted to product was significantly reduced when compared with the cleavage of the substrate containing a nick. FEN1 cleavage results in 22- and 26-nucleotide products for the 25-nucleotide flap substrate with a gap. The 22-nucleotide product is likely caused by the flap transiently annealing in the gap region to form an alternate flap structure. Surprisingly, the addition of PCNA does not lead to a specific increase in the formation of the cleavage product that results from cleavage at the base of the flap. Therefore, the addition of PCNA does not alter the specificity of FEN1 cleavage of the flap. The interesting implication of this observation is that PCNA is not required to slide to a position directly over the gap before interacting with FEN1. If PCNA must move to the base of the flap prior to cleavage, the structure required to generate the 22-nucleotide product would be blocked from forming. These results show that the PCNA stimulation mechanism is operative on a gapped substrate, but PCNA cannot compensate for the decreased cleavage efficiency caused by the absence of a nick. We considered that the flap structure itself might participate in the stimulation reaction. If so, stimulation would be more effective when the FEN1·PCNA complex interacts with the appropriate flap length. Substrates with varying flap lengths were analyzed to determine whether the length of the flap affected PCNA stimulation of FEN1. Fig. 2 illustrates PCNA stimulation of FEN1 cleavage of substrates with 25-, 4-, and 1-nucleotide flap lengths. In addition, a substrate with a fully annealed downstream primer was analyzed. The addition of PCNA to the reactions led to an increase in product formation. The level of stimulation ranged from 12- to 16-fold with no noticeable trend among the substrates. This analysis of substrates with long or short flaps and one without a flap shows that PCNA stimulates FEN1 cleavage irrespective of the flap length. In fact, the stimulation seen with the fully annealed substrate shows that the portion of the FEN1 reaction cycle that involves tracking on the flap is probably not the point of stimulation. Pseudo-Y substrates are flap structures lacking an upstream primer. In certain contexts, removal of the upstream primer virtually eliminates the ability to serve as a substrate for FEN1-directed cleavage (2.Harrington J.J. Lieber M.R. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 1235-1246Crossref PubMed Scopus (373) Google Scholar, 11.Harrington J.J. Lieber M.R. J. Biol.

Chem. 1994; 269: 1191-1196Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Such a substrate, called upstream primer- dependent, is shown in Fig.3 A. The pseudo-Y structure could not be activated by PCNA (lanes 3–5). In the presence of the upstream primer, FEN1 experienced efficient PCNA stimulation (lanes 8–10). The stimulatory effect seen for PCNA inlanes 8–10 is much greater than the effect observed inlanes 3–5. This shows that PCNA cannot efficiently activate an inert substrate. It also demonstrates that PCNA cannot substitute for an upstream primer. In the case of the upstream primer-independent substrate (41.Murante R.S. Rumbaugh J.A. Barnes C.J. Norton J.R. Bambara R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 25888-25897Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar), PCNA stimulates cleavage product formation regardless of the presence of an upstream primer. However, removal of the upstream primer alters the cleavage specificity (Fig. 3 B). Examination of the sequence at the 3′-end of the template reveals the absence of secondary structures. This interesting observation shows that entry of PCNA onto the upstream primer template does not require that this short region be double-stranded DNA. Furthermore, a double-stranded structure does not appear to be necessary to orient PCNA so that it can interact with the FEN1 nuclease for stimulation. To further analyze the mechanism involved in PCNA stimulation of FEN1, two of the previously tested flap substrates were utilized in an enzyme titration assay. A molar excess of PCNA over FEN1 was maintained for each FEN1 concentration. At very high concentrations of FEN1, the level of PCNA stimulation is less than that observed at lower concentrations of nuclease (Fig. 4). For example, when 100 fmol of FEN1 are utilized in the reactions with either substrate, PCNA stimulation is approximately 2-fold. This is a greatly reduced percentage of stimulation as compared with the 5–20-fold values measured at lower FEN1 concentrations. This result shows that the mechanism of PCNA-directed stimulation involves making the FEN1 molecules act as if they were present at a higher concentration. This observation is consistent with PCNA improving the binding of FEN1 to the substrate. Quantitative analysis of the effects of PCNA on FEN1 reaction parameters can be achieved by measuring theK m (Michaelis constant) andV max (limiting velocity) with respect to the flap substrate concentration. A large change in theK m value would suggest that PCNA alters FEN1 binding. A lower K m value would indicate that the sites of cleavage are occupied by nuclease molecules for a greater portion of time. At any point in the reaction, a larger amount of FEN1 is bound, providing more opportunity to generate the cleavage product. Alternatively, a large change in the V max value would suggest that PCNA directly improves the efficiency of the FEN1 cleavage reaction. Table II gives the K m andV max values that were determined from the Michaelis-Menten equation. The addition of PCNA leads to an approximate 2-fold increase in V max and an 11–12-fold decrease in K m. The moderate increase inV max suggests that PCNA alters the conformation or orientation of FEN1, resulting in a small improvement in the rate of catalysis. The large decrease in K m suggests that the major effect of PCNA is to stabilize FEN1 binding to the substrate. This could be accomplished by binding FEN1 molecu"

We used this model to identify domains within the large β4 cytoplasmic domain that are involved in the interaction of α6β4 with ErbB-2, invasion, and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) activation. For this purpose, we expressed deletion mutants of β4 that lacked either all or portions of the β4 cytoplasmic domain in NIH3T3/ErbB-2 cells. We also used an ecto-domain mutant in which most of the extracellular domain of β4 was replaced with a c-Myc tag. These transfectants were examined for their ability to invade Matrigel and their ability to activate PI3K, as well as for the ability of α6β4 to co-immunoprecipitate with ErbB-2. The results obtained revealed that a region of the β4 cytoplasmic domain between amino acids 854 and 1183 is critical for the ability of α6β4 integrin to increase invasion. Interestingly, the extracellular domain of β4 is not necessary for α6β4to stimulate invasion. The association of α6β4 with ErbB-2 is dependent upon the β4 cytoplasmic domain and can occur in the absence of α6β4 heterodimerization. Finally, we observed strong activation of PI3K with β4 wild type and with those β4 deletion mutants that were able to stimulate invasion upon the expression in NIH3T3/ErbB-2 cells. In conclusion, our results establish that there is cooperation between α6β4 and ErbB-2 in promoting PI3K-dependent invasion and implicate a specific region of the β4 cytoplasmic domain (amino acids 854–1183) in this event.

The interaction between integrins and their ligands is involved in the regulation of many cellular functions, including embryonic development, cell proliferation, as well as tumor growth and metastasis. Integrins are composed of α and β transmembrane subunits that heterodimerize to form different receptors. A single α subunit (e.g.αv or α6) can associate with different β subunits, (β1, β3, β5, or β1, β4, respectively), promoting different ligand binding specificity (1.Hemler M.E. Annu. Rev.

The importance of α6β4 in malignancy is also indicated by the finding that its expression correlates with the progression of squamous, ovarian, thyroid, gastric, and colorectal carcinomas (22.Kimmel K.A.

Function and signaling properties of α6β4in carcinoma cells are influenced by its association with growth factor receptors. Specifically, we demonstrated that α6β4 co-immunoprecipitates with ErbB-2 in human mammary and ovarian carcinoma cell lines and that ligation of this integrin increases ErbB-2 phosphorylation (28.Falcioni R. Antonini A. Nisticò P. Di Stefano S. Crescenzi M. Natali P.G. Sacchi A. Exp. Cell. Res. 1997; 236: 76-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). Moreover, we also observed that overexpression of ErbB-2 and α6β4 in NIH3T3 cells increased their invasive capacity (28.Falcioni R. Antonini A. Nisticò P. Di Stefano S. Crescenzi M. Natali P.G. Sacchi A. Exp. Cell. Res. 1997; 236: 76-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). In the present study, we sought to identify the portion of β4 involved in the interaction with ErbB-2 and possibly involved in the development of a more aggressive phenotype. With this aim, we generated different NIH3T3 transfectants that concomitantly overexpress ErbB-2 oncogene and wild type or deletion mutants of β4 integrin. In vitro invasion assays demonstrated that the portion of β4 protein involved in the invasive capacity resides in 329 cytoplasmic residues between the amino acids 824 and 1183. Biochemical analysis indicated that ErbB-2/β4 interaction is abolished uniquely when the entire cytoplasmic domain of β4 is deleted. Thus, we were able to exclude that the interaction of ErbB-2 and β4 is responsible for increased malignancy of NIH3T3/ErbB-2/β4cells. The study of the mechanisms by which β4 cooperates with ErbB-2 to promote increased malignancy showed that the α6β4 integrin activates the PI3K pathway when both ErbB-2 and β4 are overexpressed.

Filippo Giancotti (Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, New York) kindly provided the cDNAs encoding the full-length and truncated β4 molecules. Selection of neomycin-positive clones was carried out using 500 μg/ml of G418 (Life Technologies, Inc.). The rat monoclonal antibody (mAb)1 439-9B and the mouse mAb 450-11A to the human β4 and the rat mAb 135-13C to α6 integrin subunits, respectively, were purified as described previously (21.Falcioni R.

Tom Carey (University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI) kindly donated the anti-human β4 integrin mAb A9 (31.Van Vaes C. Kozarsky K.F. Warren A.B. Kidd L. Paugh D. Liebert M. Carey T.E. Cancer Res. 1991; 51: 2395-2402PubMed Google Scholar). The anti-mouse β4 integrin mAb 346-11A was prepared and purified from ascitic fluid and used as negative control (32.Kennel S.J. Foote L.J. Flynn K.M. Cancer Res. 1986; 46: 707-712PubMed Google Scholar). Purified anti-mouse IgG was from Cappel (Durham, NC). The mouse mAbs to the human ErbB-2 protein used in Western blotting experiments were from Transduction Laboratories (Lexington, KT) or from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). Peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse or anti-rabbit IgG were from Bio-Rad. The anti-phosphotyrosine (anti-Tyr(P)) mouse mAb 4G10 was from Upstate Biotechnology, Inc. (Upstate Biotechnology Inc., Lake Placid, NY). Anti-human and anti-mouse β4 integrin mAbs 439-9B and 346-11A were purified by high performance liquid chromatography and cross-linked to activated immune affinity supports Affi-Gel 10/15 (Bio-Rad). In brief, 4 mg of purified mAb was combined with 1 ml of Affi-Gel in 0.1 m buffer carbonate, pH 8.5, at 4 °C for 4 h. The beads were then washed with Tris-HCl 0.1 m, pH 8, and suspended in PBS containing 0.03% sodium azide (NaN3). NIH3T3 transfectants were lysed in 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1% Nonidet P-40, 10% glycerol, 137 mm NaCl, 1 mm CaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, aprotinin (5 μg/ml), leupeptin (10 μg/ml), and pepstatin A (4 μg/ml). Repeated experiments were also performed in the presence of 10 mm CHAPS (Pierce), instead of 1% Nonidet P-40, to disrupt nonspecific protein-protein interactions. Lysates were clarified by centrifugation, and the immune complexes were purified by affinity chromatography using mAbs cross-linked to Affi-Gel (bead-conjugated antibodies). Immunoprecipitations from cells labeled with lactoperoxidase and carrier-free125I showed that the antibodies recognize the appropriate molecules (data not shown). In brief, as described previously (21.Falcioni R. Sacchi A. Resau J. Kennel S.J. Cancer Res. 1988; 48: 816-821PubMed Google Scholar), 2 × 106 cells were labeled with 1 mCi of125I in the presence of 10 μl of lactoperoxidase (2 mg/ml in 50% of glycerol) (Calbiochem, La Jolla, CA) and 5 μl of a 1:1000 dilution of H2O2 (30%). After labeling, cells were washed with PBS and solubilized in lysis buffer containing 5 mg/ml BSA, 1% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm NaN3, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (Sigma), 5 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml aprotinin (Sigma), and 10 mm EDTA. The lysates were clarified by centrifugation (30,000 ×g) for 3 h at 4 °C and solubilized proteins (1 × 107 cpm) were immunoprecipitated. The immunoprecipitates were analyzed by SDS-PAGE, and autoradiography was performed with X-Omat RP film (Kodak). Direct immunoprecipitations were performed using primary antibodies collected with 50 μl of Protein G-agarose beads (Pierce) suspended in lysis buffer (50% v/v). Total cell lysates were added to the bead-conjugated antibodies, and protein complexes were washed at 4 °C in lysis buffer, boiled, and analyzed by SDS-PAGE. To assay PI3K activity, after serum starvation for 24 h the cells were washed and lysed in 10 mmHepes, pH 7.5, 0.15 m NaCl, 10% glycerol in the presence of protease and phosphatase inhibitors. Nuclei were removed by centrifugation at 12,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C. After lysis, aliquots of cell extracts containing equivalent amounts of protein were incubated overnight at 4 °C with anti-Tyr(P) mAb 4G10 (Upstate Biotechnology, Inc.) and protein G (Pierce). The beads were washed twice with lysis buffer (10 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 0.15m NaCl, 10% glycerol, and 1% Nonidet P-40); twice with 0.5 m LiCl; twice with 10 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 0.15 m NaCl, and 0.2% Nonidet P-40; and once with 10 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 0.15 m NaCl. After removal of the last wash, the beads were suspended in 30 μl of 30 mmHepes, pH 7.5, and 30 μl of kinase buffer containing 10 μg (20 μl) of l-α-phosphatidylinositol from bovin liver (Sigma) sonicated in 10 mm Hepes and 1 mm EDTA, 80 μm ATP (Roche Molecular Biochemicals), 20 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP (6000 Ci/mmol), 10 mmMgCl2, and 400 μm adenosine (Sigma) and incubated for 25 min at room temperature. The reaction was stopped by the addition of 100 μl of 1 m HCl, and 200 μl of 1:1 mixture of chloroform and methanol were added. The organic phase was then washed twice with 300 μl of 1:1 mixture of methanol and HCl. The lipid extracts (20 μl of each reaction) were then resolved by thin layer chromatography plates (TLC Silica gel) (Merck) in chloroform, methanol, and ammonium hydroxide. Dried TLC sheets were developed by autoradiography. Total cell lysates or immune complexes obtained by affinity chromatography or indirect immunoprecipitation were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and transferred onto nitrocellulose membrane (Bio-Rad) or Immobilon-P transfer membrane (Millipore, Bedford, MA). The blots were probed with the following antibodies: 2 μg/ml of anti-ErbB-2 mAb (Clone 3B5) or 2 μg/ml of purified mouse anti-human c-Myc mAb (Clone 9E10). Filters were washed and developed with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies and enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Autoradiographies were performed with Hyperfilm ECL (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The expression levels of ErbB-2 and α6β4 integrin receptors were detected by flow cytometric analysis of stained cells. Cells harvested using citrate saline buffer (0.134 m KCl, 0.015 msodium citrate) were washed twice with cold PBS containing 0.002% EDTA and 10 mm NaN3 (washing buffer). Samples of 1 × 106 cells were incubated for 1 h at 4 °C with saturating concentrations of primary antibodies diluted in PBS containing 0.5% BSA. Control cells were incubated with unrelated antibodies. Cells were then washed three times with washing buffer (PBS containing 0.5% BSA) and incubated for 1 h at 4 °C with 50 μl of fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated secondary antibodies (F(ab′)2 (Cappel, West Chester, PA)) diluted 1:20 in PBS/BSA. After three washes, the cells were suspended in 1 ml of washing buffer. Cell suspensions were analyzed by a flow cytometer (Epics XL analyzer, Coulter Corporation, Miami, FL) after addition of 5 μl of propidium iodide (1 mg/ml stock solution) to exclude nonviable cells. At least 1 × 104 cells/sample were analyzed. Chemoinvasion assays were carried out in a Boyden chamber as described (33.Albini A. Iwamoto Y. Kleinman H.K. Martin G.R. Aaronson S.A. Kozlowsky J.M. Ewan R.N.A Cancer Res. 1987; 47: 3239-3245PubMed Google Scholar). In brief, 8-mm polycarbonate filters (Nucleopore, Concorezzo, Italy) were coated with Matrigel kindly provided by Dr. A. Albini (Genova, Italy). Optimal Matrigel concentration (12.5 μg/filter from a 250 μg/ml dilution of Matrigel in distilled, cold water) was accurately determined in preliminary experiments. The cells harvested by trypsin-EDTA treatment were washed with serum free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 0.1% BSA, and 5 × 105 cells were layered on the top well of a Boyden chamber. The chambers were incubated at 37 °C, 5% CO2 for 8 h in the presence of Balb/3T3 conditioned medium (added as chemo-attractant) or in the presence of 0.1% BSA (added as negative control). In some assays, the cells were preincubated for 30 min before addition to the Matrigel-coated wells with wortmannin (Biomol, Plymouth Metting, PA). Cells migrated on the lower surface of the filters were fixed in ethanol and stained with Toluidine blue. Five independent fields were counted at 160× with a Zeiss microscope. Each assay was carried out in quadruplicate and repeated at least three times. The ability of the cells to adhere to the filters was verified by staining the upper side of the filters. We previously demonstrated that the expression of the β4 integrin subunit in NIH3T3 cells, transformed by the ErbB-2 oncogene, stimulates their in vitro invasion (28.Falcioni R. Antonini A. Nisticò P. Di Stefano S. Crescenzi M. Natali P.G. Sacchi A. Exp. Cell. Res. 1997; 236: 76-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). To identify specific domains in the β4 subunit that confer this invasive potential, we expressed deletion mutants of β4 in NIH3T3/ErbB-2 cells (Fig. 1). These deletion mutants lacked either all (L) or portions (B, C, and D) of the β4cytoplasmic domain. In addition, we used an ecto-domain mutant (F) in which most of the extracellular domain of β4 was replaced with a c-Myc tag. In agreement with data previously reported (10.Spinardi L. Ren Y.L. Sanders R. Giancotti F.G. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1993; 4: 871-884Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar), all of these mutants were highly expressed on the cell surface of the transfected cells (data not shown). Clones of these transfectants expressing comparable surface expression of the β4subunit were chosen for functional and biochemical analyses. The expression levels of β4 protein corresponding to F deletion mutant were assessed by Western blot analysis using a mouse anti-human c-Myc antibody (Fig. 2). Immunoprecipitation of surface-labeled proteins confirmed the expression of wild type and truncated β4 proteins on the cell surface of selected clones (data not shown).Figure 2Western blot analysis using a mouse anti-human c-Myc antibody of the clones obtained after selection of NIH3T3/ErbB-2 cells transfected with deleted β4 F cDNA.

At least two clones from each of the NIH3T3/ErbB-2/β4 transfectant were used for this purpose. In agreement with our previous finding (28.Falcioni R. Antonini A. Nisticò P. Di Stefano S. Crescenzi M. Natali P.G. Sacchi A. Exp. Cell. Res. 1997; 236: 76-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar), expression of the wild type β4 subunit increased invasion of NIH3T3/ErbB-2 cells by 2.5-fold. Interestingly, expression of the β4 C, D, and F mutants resulted in a similar increase in invasion (Table I). However, expression of the β4 L and B mutants did not enhance the invasiveness of NIH3T3/ErbB-2 cells. Two important conclusions can be drawn from these data. First, the extracellular domain of β4 does not appear to be necessary for α6β4 to stimulate invasion based on the results obtained with the β4 F mutant. Second, a portion of the β4 cytoplasmic domain between amino acids 854 (the site of the β4 B deletion) and 1183 (the site of the β4 C deletion) is critical for the ability of the α6β4 integrin to stimulate invasion. However, the β4 mutated proteins we used contain very large deletions, leaving open the possibility for the domains of the β4 protein, upstream of the 854 amino acid, to stimulate invasion but which at the same time require cooperation with the other downstream domains. We also cannot exclude that such deletions, causing conformational changes of the molecules, could prevent their interaction with intermediate signaling molecules responsible for stimulating invasion.Table IChemoinvasive ability of the NIH3T3 transfectantsWortmanninCell lines−+Cells/fieldP*Cells/fieldP*NIH3T3/ErbB-248 ± 1750 ± 150.886NIH3T3/ErbB-2/β4 wild type112 ± 120.006<1NIH3T3/ErbB-2/β4 L42 ± 80.61NDNIH3T3/ErbB-2/β4 B56 ± 50.478NDNIH3T3/ErbB-2/β4 C108 ± 70.005<1NIH3T3/ErbB-2/β4 D112 ± 120.011<1NIH3T3/ErbB-2/β4 F130 ± 150.003<1NIH3T3 transfectants were assayed for their ability to invade Matrigel in the absence or presence of the PI3K inhibitor wortmannin (100 nm.

ND, not determined. Given our previous demonstration of a physical association between α6β4 and ErbB-2, we attempt to determine whether this association is necessary for the ability of α6β4 and ErbB-2 to promote invasion. Specifically, we examined the ability of ErbB-2 to co-immunoprecipitate with α6β4 heterodimers that contained specific deletions in the β4 subunit. To this purpose, these α6β4 heterodimers were purified by affinity chromatography using either 439-9B mAb, which recognizes an epitope present in the extracellular domain of β4 or 450-11A mAb, which recognizes an epitope in the β4cytoplasmic domain. As negative control, we used 346-11A mAb, which is specific for mouse β4. The presence of ErbB-2 in the β4 integrin immune complexes was determined by immunoblotting. Using this approach, we detected the 185-kDa ErbB-2 protein in the β4 immune complexes obtained from extracts of NIH3T3/ErbB-2 cells that expressed the intact α6β4 heterodimer (Fig.3, lane 1), as expected (28.Falcioni R. Antonini A. Nisticò P. Di Stefano S. Crescenzi M. Natali P.G. Sacchi A. Exp. Cell. Res. 1997; 236: 76-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). In addition, an ErbB-2/β4 complex was detected in extracts obtained from clones 19 and 21 of cells expressing the extracellular domain deletion of β4 (β4 F) (Fig. 3). In these immune complexes, purified by an anti-β4 mAb specific for the cytoplasmic domain of the molecule, the anti-ErbB-2 mAb was able to detect a 185-kDa protein (Fig. 3, lanes 2 and 3). Moreover, the co-immunoprecipitation of ErbB-2 and β4 F truncated protein was detected after reprobing the same blot with an anti-c-Myc mAb (Fig. 3, lanes 5 and 6). The same anti-c-Myc antibody did not recognize the β4 wild type protein (lane 4). Similar experiments performed using extracts from NIH3T3/ErbB-2 cells expressing truncated proteins β4 C (clones 9 and 17) and D (clones 3 and 25) revealed that all these β4 truncated proteins co-immunoprecipitate with the ErbB-2 protein (Fig. 4, lanes 1, 3, 5, and 7, respectively). The mAb specific for the mouse β4 integrin (negative control) did not co-immunoprecipitate ErbB-2 from the same extracts (Fig. 4, lanes 2, 4, 6, and8). Fig. 5 shows immune complexes from extracts of NIH3T3/ErbB-2 cells transfected with truncated proteins β4 B (clones 11 and 14) and L (clones 5 and 4). The truncated β4 B protein still co-precipitated with ErbB-2 (Fig. 5, lanes 3 and4), whereas β4 L protein, which was deleted from the entire cytoplasmic domain, did not co-precipitate with ErbB-2 (Fig. 5, lanes 6 and 7). As controls, the ErbB-2 protein was detected in immune complexes derived from lysates of NIH3T3/ErbB-2 cells expressing wild type β4 protein (Fig.5, lane 2) but not from lysates of NIH3T3/ErbB-2 cells (Fig.5, lane 1 and 5). These data show that only the deletion of the entire β4 cytoplasmic domain abrogates co-immunoprecipitation of ErbB-2 and β4. Moreover, the finding that the β4 F protein, which is unable to form α6β4 heterodimers (10.Spinardi L. Ren Y.L. Sanders R. Giancotti F.G. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1993; 4: 871-884Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar) but is still able to retain the ability to co-precipitate with ErbB-2 indicates that the α6 subunit is not involved in the ErbB-2/β4interaction.Figure 4Association of the β4 mutant C and D molecules with ErbB-2.

In the present study, we have demonstrated that signals through gp130 increase the expression of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) in cardiac myocytes via the signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) 3 pathway. After activation of gp130 with leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF), expression of VEGF mRNA rapidly increased with a peak at 3 h in cultured cardiac myocytes. Cardiotrophin-1 also enhanced VEGF mRNA expression in a dose-dependent manner. VEGF protein production and secretion to the medium were also enhanced by LIF and cardiotrophin-1 but not by interleukin-6. Adenovirus transfer of the dominant-negative form of STAT3 to cultured cardiac myocytes inhibited induction of VEGF expression induced by LIF, but neither PD98059 nor wortmannin was affected. In murine hearts, intravenous administration of LIF augmented expression of VEGF mRNA; however, the hearts of transgenic mice overexpressing dominant-negative STAT3 showed reduced expression of VEGF mRNA that was not induced after LIF stimulation. These data provide the first evidence that a STAT family protein functions as a regulator of angiogenic growth factors and suggest that gp130/STAT signaling in cardiac myocytes can control vessel growth during cardiac remodeling.

Glycoprotein (gp)1 130 is a signal transducer and a common receptor subunit of interleukin (IL)-6-related cytokines (1.Kishimoto T. Taga T. Akira S. Cell. 1994; 76: 253-262Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1250) Google Scholar). Stimulation of gp130 leads to the activation of the Janus kinase (JAK)/signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) pathway. Following the activation of JAK, STAT proteins are phosphorylated on tyrosine residues, translocate to nuclei, and activate the transcription of target genes (2.Taga T. Kishimoto T. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1997; 15: 797-819Crossref PubMed Scopus (1306) Google Scholar). STAT proteins are reported to be involved in regulating cell survival, proliferation, and differentiation (3.Darnell J.E.J. Science. 1997; 277: 1630-1635Crossref PubMed Scopus (3401) Google Scholar). Signals through gp130 also play an important role in the regeneration or remodeling of various tissuesin vivo. For example, hepatocyte regeneration was found to be impaired in IL-6-deficient mice (4.Kopf M. Baumann H. Freer G. Freudenberg M. Lamers M. Kishimoto T. Zinkernagel R. Bluethmann H. Kohler G. Nature. 1994; 368: 339-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (1520) Google Scholar), and coexpression of IL-6 and its receptor causes regenerative hyperplasia in the liver (5.Schirmacher P. Peters M. Ciliberto G. Blessing M. Lotz J. Meyer zum Buschenfelde K.H. Rose-John S. Am. J. Pathol. 1998; 153: 639-648Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). In cardiac myocytes, gp130 stimulation results in the activation of downstream signaling pathways, including the JAK/STAT, mitogen-activated kinase (MAPK) (6.Kunisada K. Hirota H. Fujio Y. Matsui H. Tani Y. Yamauchi-Takihara K. Kishimoto T. Circulation. 1996; 94: 2626-2632Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar), and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3-K) pathways (7.Oh H. Fujio Y. Kunisada K. Hirota H. Matsui H. Kishimoto T. Yamauchi-Takihara K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 9703-9710Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). Pathophysiologically, gp130/STAT is activated through the autocrine/paracrine system of IL-6 related cytokines, including cardiotrophin-1 (CT-1), in response to mechano-stretch, hypoxia, and other cytokines such as IL-1β and tumor necrosis factor-α (8.Pan J. Fukuda K. Saito M. Matsuzaki J. Kodama H. Sano M. Takahashi T. Kato T. Ogawa S. Circ. Res. 1999; 84: 1127-1136Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar, 9.Hishinuma S. Funamoto M. Fujio Y. Kunisada K. Yamauchi- Takihara K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 264: 436-440Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). It is also reported that the activation of STAT transduces hypertrophic signals coupled with the positive regulation of cell survival in vitro (10.Fujio Y. Kunisada K. Hirota H. Yamauchi-Takihara K. Kishimoto T. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 99: 2898-2905Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar, 11.Kunisada K. Tone E. Fujio Y. Matsui H. Yamauchi-Takihara K. Kishimoto T. Circulation. 1998; 98: 346-352Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). Taken together, these data suggest that the gp130/STAT system plays an important role in cardiac remodeling, such as hypertrophy triggered by extracellular stress. Recently it has been shown that cardiac-specific disruption of gp130 results in cardiomyopathy in response to mechano-stress with an increase in apoptosis (12.Hirota H. Chen J. Betz U.A.K. Rajewsky K. Gu Y. Ross J.J. Muller W. Chien K.R. Cell. 1999; 97: 189-198Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (590) Google Scholar). Thus the inactivation of STAT3 resulting from the loss of gp130 may be a key event in the transition from cardiac hypertrophy to heart failure. Although the molecular mechanisms for the onset of dilated cardiomyopathy in cardiac-specific gp130 knockout mice remains unidentified, perturbed vascular function may contribute to the cardiomyopathy. This hypothesis arises from the observations that impaired vasculature caused by disruption of VEGF (13.Carmeliet P. Ng Y.-S. Nuyens D. Theilmeier G. Brusselmans K. Cornelissen I. Ehler E. Kakkar V.V. Stalmans I. Mattot V. Perriard J.-C. Dewerchin M. Flameng W. Nagy A. Lupu F. Moons L. Collen D. D'Amore P.A. Shima D.T. Nat. Med. 1999; 5: 495-502Crossref PubMed Scopus (563) Google Scholar) or the sarcoglycan complex in vascular smooth muscle cells (14.Coral-Vazquez R. Cohn R.D. Moore S.A. Hill J.A. Weiss R.M. Davisson R.L. Straub V. Barresi R. Bansal D. Hrstka R.F. Williamson R. Campbell K.P. Cell. 1999; 98: 465-474Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar) leads to cardiac dysfunction, possibly because of ischemic stress-induced reduction in cell viability. In other words, proper vascular growth is essential for normal cardiac development and remodeling. Based on this reasoning, we explored the possibility that signals through gp130 regulate vascular growth factors in heart via STAT pathways. In the present study, we demonstrate that stimulation of gp130 up-regulates VEGF expression both in vitro andin vivo and that STAT3 is required for gp130-mediated VEGF induction. These data suggest that activation of gp130 can play a pivotal role in regulating interactions between myocytes and the endothelium through a VEGF signaling mechanism. This mechanism may function to coordinate vessel growth with cardiac remodeling.

The care of all animals in the present study was in accordance with Osaka University Animal Care guidelines. Primary cultures of cardiac myocytes were prepared from the ventricles of 1–2 -day-old Wister rats (Kiwa Dobutsu, Wakayama, Japan) as described previously (6.Kunisada K. Hirota H. Fujio Y. Matsui H. Tani Y. Yamauchi-Takihara K. Kishimoto T. Circulation. 1996; 94: 2626-2632Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). In brief, hearts were treated with trypsin and collagenase for 30 min. Isolated cells were collected by centrifugation and resuspended in M-199 containing 10% fetal calf serum. Cultures were enriched with myocytes by preplating for 40 min to deplete the population of nonmyocytes. Nonattached cells were plated onto plastic culture dishes at an appropriate cell density and cultured in M-199 supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum at 37 °C in 95% air/5% CO2. These cells consisted of >90% myocytes analyzed by immunofluorescent microscopy using anti-sarcomeric-specific α-actinin antibody. Cells, attached during preplating, were cultured as nonmyocytes and were maintained for 4 days with medium changed every 2 days. Nonmyocytes isolated from the hearts were passaged twice and used for the assay. Nonmyocytes culture consists of >95% fibroblasts. The recombinant replication-defective adenovirus expressing dominant-negative form of STAT3 (dnSTAT3) was prepared as described previously (11.Kunisada K. Tone E. Fujio Y. Matsui H. Yamauchi-Takihara K. Kishimoto T. Circulation. 1998; 98: 346-352Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). The recombinant viruses were purified and concentrated as described previously (15.Becker T.C. Noel R.J. Coats W.S. Gomez-Foix A.M. Alam T. Gerard R.D. Newgard C.B. Methods Cell Biol. 1994; 43: 161-189Crossref PubMed Scopus (562) Google Scholar). 36 h after plating, cardiac myocytes were transfected with adenovirus vectors in M-199 with 10% fetal calf serum at a multiplicity of infection of 20 and incubated for 12 h. After removal of viral suspension, cardiac myocytes were serum-starved for 8 h and stimulated with reagents. Transfection efficiency, analyzed by Lac-Z gene expression in cultured cardiac myocytes, is constantly >90% by this method. Adenovirus vector expressing β-galactosidase was used as a control. A 5.5-kilobase (kb) fragment of murine α-myosin heavy chain (α-MHC) gene promoter (generously provided by Dr. Jeffrey Robbins, Children's Hospital Research Foundation, Cincinnati, OH) and a 2.3-kb murine dnSTAT3 cDNA (generously provided from Dr. S. Akira, Osaka University, Osaka, Japan) were subcloned into pBluescriptIISK(+) plasmid. The plasmids were digested with BamHI to generate 8.4-kb DNA fragment consistent with α-MHC gene promoter, dnSTAT3 cDNA, and poly(A) of the human growth hormone. Transgenic mice (BCF1 strain) were generated as described elsewhere (16.Ikawa M. Yamada S. Nakanishi T. Okabe M. FEBS Lett. 1998; 430: 83-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). To identify exogenous gene, genomic DNA was extracted from the tail tissues of 3-week-old mouse pups. Screening of transgenic mice carrying cardiac-specific overexpression of dnSTAT3 (dnSTAT3 TG) was performed by polymerase chain reaction analysis using a set of primers, 5′-GATGCGACCAACATCCTGGTG-3′ and 5′-GGACATCGGCAGGTCAATGGT-3′, which correspond to the sequences obtained from exon 21 and exon 23 of the murine STAT3 gene (17.Akira S.

Polymerase chain reaction condition was 96 °C for 4 min, followed by 30 cycles of 96 °C for 1 min, 58 °C for 1 min, and 72 °C for 2 min. The length of amplified DNA was 201 base pairs. Transgenic mice carrying cardiac-specific overexpression of wild type STAT3 (wtSTAT3 TG) were generated as described previously (18.Kunisada K. Negoro S. Tone E. Funamoto M. Osugi T. Yamada S.

Total RNA was prepared with the acid guanidinium isothiocyanate-phenol-chloroform method (19.Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (63232) Google Scholar). Rat VEGF cDNA was obtained by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction methods using specific oligonucleotides primers (sense, 5′-AAGCCAGCACATAGGAGAGATGAG-3′; antisense, 5′-TCACCGCCTTGGCTTGTCACATCT-3′) synthesized based on the nucleotide sequence according to GenBankTM (accession numberAF062644). Polymerase chain reaction fragment was subcloned into pCR2.1, and the nucleotide sequence was confirmed. VEGF cDNA was labeled with [α-32P]dCTP with a PRIME IT II labeling kit. Total cellular RNA (8 μg) was separated on 1.5% formaldehyde-agarose gel and transferred to a nylon membrane in the presence of 20× SSC (300 mm sodium chloride and 300 mm sodium citrate, pH 7.0). Prehybridization was performed at 42 °C for 1 h in 650 mm sodium chloride, 100 mm sodium PIPES, pH 6.8, 5× Denhardt's solution, 0.1% SDS, 10 mg/ml of denatured salmon sperm DNA, and formamide at a final concentration of 50%. After 12 h of hybridization, the membrane was washed twice with 2× SSC and 0.1% SDS at 60 °C. Autoradiography was performed at −80 °C. The intensity was analyzed by densitometry (Immuno Reader NJ-2000) (InterMed Inc.). 10 μg of proteins were separated in 7.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gel and electrophoretically transferred onto a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane with transfer buffer (25 mm Tris, 190 mm glycine, and 20% methanol). Membrane was blocked with 5% skim milk and probed with anti-STAT3 antibody at a 1:1000 dilution for 1 h. ECL system was used for the detection. Concentration of VEGF in the cultured medium was analyzed by using a VEGF ELISA kit (Quantikine M mouse VEGF; R & D Systems) according to the manufacturer's instruction. In brief, cardiac myocytes (5 × 105cells/well) were cultured in 1 ml of serum-depleted medium and treated with reagents. Conditioned medium (50 μl) was added onto each well of microtiter plate, which is precoated with anti-mouse VEGF polyclonal antibody, and incubated for 2 h. Each well was washed with wash buffer and incubated with 100 μl of enzyme-linked polyclonal antibody specific for mouse VEGF for 2 h. Following washes, a substrate solution was added to each well. After incubation for 30 min at room temperature, enzyme reaction was stopped, and intensity was measured at 450 nm using Immuno Reader NJ-2000 (InterMed Inc.). For the measurement of VEGF contents in the hearts, mice were injected either with LIF or vehicle and sacrificed 3 h later, and the hearts were homogenated in 10 volumes of lysis buffer (50 mm HEPES, 100 mm sodium fluoride, 2 mm sodium orthovanadate, 4 mm EDTA, 100 units/ml aprotinin, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1% Triton X-100, and 0.1% SDS). Crude extracts were prepared by centrifugation at 15000 rpm for 10 min, and VEGF concentrations were measured as described above. VEGF contents were normalized with protein concentration, assessed with BCA Protein Assay Kit (Pierce). Data are presented as the means ± S.E. Statistical analyses were performed using unpaired Student'st tests. A value of p < 0.05 was considered significant. To investigate whether IL-6-related cytokines regulate VEGF mRNA expression, we performed Northern blot analyses of LIF-stimulated cardiac myocytes. After 8 h of culture in serum-depleted medium, cardiac myocytes were stimulated with 103 units/ml LIF for the time indicated (Fig.1). Enhancement of VEGF mRNA expression was detected within 1 h with a maximum level at 3 h (140% increase) followed by a decrease within 24 h in cardiac myocytes. On the other hands, no enhancement of VEGF mRNA expression was detected in response to LIF stimulation in nonmyocytes (data not shown). As shown in Fig. 2, LIF also induced VEGF mRNA expression in a dose-dependent manner.Figure 2LIF affects dose-dependent effect on VEGF expression. A, cultured cardiac myocytes were stimulated with various concentrations of LIF for 3 h. VEGF mRNA expression was examined by Northern blot analysis. Experiments were performed three times with similar results. Representative data were demonstrated. B, the relative intensity of the band for VEGF mRNA was assessed as the ratio to the intensity of the band for 28 S using densitometry.

Cardiac myocytes were starved from serum for 8 h and stimulated by replacement with fresh medium containing various concentrations of LIF for 24 h. As shown in Fig. 2 C, LIF augmented VEGF protein production in cardiac myocytes in a dose-dependent manner. Consistent with the VEGF mRNA expression, no enhanced VEGF protein expression was detected in the culture medium from LIF-treated nonmyocytes (data not shown). Because CT-1 activates the LIF receptor (20.Pennica D. Shaw K.J. Swanson T.A. Moor M.W. Shelton D.L. Zioncheck K.A. Rosenthal A. Taga T. Proni N.F. Wood W.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 271: 10915-10922Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (419) Google Scholar) followed by gp130 activation, we analyzed the effects of CT-1 on the expression of VEGF. As shown in Fig. 3 A, CT-1 also induced VEGF mRNA expression in a dose-dependent manner in cardiac myocytes. Moreover, as in the case with LIF, enhancement of VEGF mRNA accompanied an increase in protein (Fig. 3 B). On the other hand, IL-6 showed no effect on VEGF expression in either mRNA (data not shown) or protein levels, which is consistent with the finding that the IL-6 receptor is expressed at low levels in cultured cardiac myocytes (21.Wollert K.C. Chien K.R. J. Mol. Med. 1997; 75: 492-501Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Activation of gp130 is known to result in the activation of downstream signaling pathways, including JAK/STAT, MAPK, and PI3-K (6.Kunisada K. Hirota H. Fujio Y. Matsui H. Tani Y. Yamauchi-Takihara K. Kishimoto T. Circulation. 1996; 94: 2626-2632Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar, 7.Oh H. Fujio Y. Kunisada K. Hirota H. Matsui H. Kishimoto T. Yamauchi-Takihara K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 9703-9710Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). To identify the downstream effector for gp130-mediated VEGF induction, the effects of dnSTAT3, PD98059, and wortmannin on VEGF induction were examined. First, cultured cardiac myocytes were transfected with adenovirus vectors expressing dnSTAT3 or β-galactosidase and stimulated with LIF. As shown in Fig.4 A, transduction of β-galactosidase had no effect on the expression level of VEGF mRNA, whereas transduction of dnSTAT3 inhibited LIF-induced VEGF mRNA expression. To examine the involvement of other pathways in VEGF gene regulation, PD98059, a specific MEK-1 inhibitor, was used. As shown in Fig.4 B, pretreatment with PD98059 had no effect on LIF-mediated VEGF induction, suggesting that the MAPK pathway is not a major regulatory pathway under these conditions. Wortmannin, a PI3-K inhibitor, also did not affect LIF-mediated VEGF mRNA induction (data not shown). Finally, transfection of dnSTAT3 inhibited LIF-induced VEGF protein induction (Fig. 4 C). To evaluate the importance of STAT3 in VEGF induction in vivo, we examined the effect of LIF on VEGF expression in adult murine heart. 8-week-old mice were treated intravenously either with LIF (1 × 103 units/0.1 ml) or with an equal volume of PBS, and the hearts were excised at various time points. As shown in Fig.5, enhancement of VEGF mRNA expression was detected within 1 h of LIF administration and reached it maximum level at 3 h. To clarify the involvement of STAT3 in VEGF regulation in vivo, transgenic mice with cardiac-specific overexpressing dnSTAT3 under control of the α-MHC promoter (Fig.6 A) were examined. Protein extracts were prepared from the hearts of 8-week-old control littermates (WT) or transgenic mice carrying dnSTAT3 (dnSTAT3 TG) and immunoblotted with anti-STAT3 antibody. As shown in Fig. 6 B, a 10-fold increase in STAT3 protein was observed in dnSTAT3 TG hearts compared with that in WT. LIF (1 × 103 units) was then injected into both animals, and VEGF mRNA expression was examined in the hearts after 1 h. As shown in Fig. 6 C, little or no remarkable induction of VEGF mRNA expression was observed in dnSTAT3 TG after LIF treatment. Similar results were obtained using a second line of dnSTAT3 transgenic animals (data not shown). Furthermore, transgenic mice with cardiac-specific overexpressing wild type STAT3 (wtSTAT3 TG) were generated and analyzed the concentration of VEGF protein in the heart. As shown in Fig.7, 20% increase of VEGF protein was observed in wtSTAT3 TG hearts compared with that in WT at basal level, and enhancement of VEGF induction was observed after LIF stimulation in wtSTAT3 TG hearts. IL-6 related cytokines bind to their specific receptors, followed by the activation of gp130 (1.Kishimoto T. Taga T. Akira S. Cell. 1994; 76: 253-262Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1250) Google Scholar). Signals through gp130 are known to activate STATs, MAPK, and PI3-K (6.Kunisada K. Hirota H. Fujio Y. Matsui H. Tani Y. Yamauchi-Takihara K. Kishimoto T. Circulation. 1996; 94: 2626-2632Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar, 7.Oh H. Fujio Y. Kunisada K. Hirota H. Matsui H. Kishimoto T. Yamauchi-Takihara K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 9703-9710Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar) and known to transduce hypertrophic and anti-apoptotic signals in cardiac myocytes (10.Fujio Y. Kunisada K. Hirota H. Yamauchi-Takihara K. Kishimoto T. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 99: 2898-2905Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar, 11.Kunisada K. Tone E. Fujio Y. Matsui H. Yamauchi-Takihara K.

Pharmacol. 1996; 93: 149-162PubMed Google Scholar). Recently, it was reported that transgenic mice with cardiac-specific overexpression of STAT3, a downstream effector of gp130, manifested mild cardiac hypertrophy at the age of 12 weeks and recovered from doxorubicin-induced cardiomyopathy (18.Kunisada K. Negoro S. Tone E. Funamoto M. Osugi T. Yamada S. Okabe M. Kishimoto T. Yamauchi-Takihara K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 315-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar). Here we propose a new function for gp130 signaling, the regulation of angiogenic growth factors. In the present study, we demonstrated that signals through gp130 rapidly up-regulate VEGF expression in cardiac myocytes both in vitro and in vivo. Using an adenoviral vector expressing dnSTAT3, we showed that STAT3 is essential for VEGF induction in vitro. To address whether the STAT3-dependent signaling pathway is essential for VEGF induction in the heart, we generated transgenic mice expressing dominant-negative STAT3 from a myocardial-specific promoter. dnSTAT3 TG hearts showed reduced basal VEGF mRNA expression and little or no remarkable increase after LIF stimulation, indicating that STAT3 plays an important role in the transcriptional regulation of VEGFgene in cardiac myocytes in vivo. Because the transgene is driven by the α-MHC promoter, reduction of VEGF mRNA expression in hearts is likely to be derived from cardiac myocytes not from cardiac fibroblasts. Furthermore, it should be noted that VEGF mRNA is down-regulated in naive dnSTAT3 TG hearts, suggesting physiological significance of the STAT3 pathway in adult hearts. The biological relevance of this signaling pathway was also supported by the experiments using wtSTAT3 TG hearts, which showed higher levels of VEGF protein with enhanced expression in response to LIF (Fig. 7), implying that STAT3 mediates VEGF induction in vivo. VEGF is a potent angiogenic growth factor, and heterozygous deletion of the VEGF gene results in embryonic lethality (23.Ferrara N. Carver-Moore K. Chen H. Dowd M. Lu L. O'Shea K.S. Powell-Braxton L. Hillan K.J. Moore M.W.N. Nature. 1996; 380: 439-442Crossref PubMed Scopus (3062) Google Scholar). Recently, disruption of VEGF isoform has been reported to induce heart failure because of ischemia, which is in turn induced by impaired vascular structure. This suggests that VEGF expression is essential for postnatal heart development (13.Carmeliet P. Ng Y.-S. Nuyens D. Theilmeier G. Brusselmans K. Cornelissen I. Ehler E. Kakkar V.V. Stalmans I. Mattot V. Perriard J.-C. Dewerchin M. Flameng W. Nagy A. Lupu F. Moons L. Collen D. D'Amore P.A. Shima D.T. Nat. Med. 1999; 5: 495-502Crossref PubMed Scopus (563) Google Scholar). However, despite the reduction in VEGF expression, dnSTAT3 TG did not show any abnormality in the hearts (data not shown). The difference in cardiac phenotype between the VEGF isoform knockout mice and dnSTAT3 TG may be explained by the difference between the two experimental systems. In our transgenic strategy, dominant-negative STAT3 is driven by the α-MHC promoter and activated after birth (24.Palermo J. Gulick J. Colbert M. Fewell J. Robbins J. Circ. Res. 1995; 78: 504-509Crossref Scopus (117) Google Scholar), whereas the VEGF deletion occurs before birth. Another explanation for the difference is that STAT3-mediated VEGF induction is not required for the heart development but essential under stress conditions. This speculation is supported by a recent report that cardiac-specific gene targeting of gp130 resulted in little cardiac abnormality during development but generated dilated cardiomyopathy in response to mechanical stress (12.Hirota H. Chen J. Betz U.A.K. Rajewsky K. Gu Y. Ross J.J. Muller W. Chien K.R. Cell. 1999; 97: 189-198Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (590) Google Scholar). To evaluate the pathological significance of STAT3 in VEGF regulation in vivo, it would be helpful to determine whether a reduction of VEGF contributes to the onset of heart failure in gp130 conditional knockout mice. Our observations would also give a new insight into the role of STAT3 in tumorgenesis. Recently it was shown that STAT3 is involved in the transformation by v-Src (25.Turkson J. Bowman T. Garcia R. Caldenhoven E. De Groot R.P. Jove R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 2545-2552Crossref PubMed Scopus (594) Google Scholar, 26.Bromberg J.F. Horvath C.M. Besser D. Lathem W.W. Darnell J.J.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 2553-2558Crossref PubMed Scopus (571) Google Scholar) and that the constitutively active form of STAT3 functions as an oncogene (27.Bromberg J.F. Wrzeszczynska M.H. Devgan G. Zhao Y. Pestell R.G. Albanese C. Darnell Jr., J.E. Cell. 1999; 98: 295-303Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2517) Google Scholar). Importantly, cells expressing an active form of STAT3 form solid tumor in vivo. Because the formation of solid tumor larger than 2 mm3requires tumor angiogenesis for continuous growth and maintenance (28.Folkman J. N. Engl. J. Med. 1995; 333: 1757-1763Crossref PubMed Scopus (2251) Google Scholar), it is possible that activation of STAT3 leads to the tumor angiogenesis, at least in some cases. In summary, signals though gp130 induce VEGF via STAT3 in cardiac myocytes both in vitro and in vivo. This represents the first identification of STAT family proteins as regulators of an angiogenic growth factor. We thank C. Kusunoki for secretarial assistance."

We have utilized the ability of cells to contract floating collagen gels to determine the effect of fibronectin polymerization on mechanical tension generation by cells. Our data indicate that fibronectin polymerization promotes cell spreading in collagen gels and stimulates cell contractility by a Rho-dependent mechanism. Fibronectin-stimulated contractility was dependent on integrin ligation; however, integrin ligation by fibronectin fragments was not sufficient to induce either tension generation or cell spreading. Furthermore, treatment of cells with polyvalent RGD peptides or pre-polymerized fibronectin did not stimulate cell contractility. Fibronectin-induced contractility was blocked by agents that inhibit fibronectin polymerization, suggesting that the process of fibronectin polymerization is critical in triggering cytoskeletal tension generation.

Fibronectins. Springer-Verlag, New York1990Crossref Google Scholar). The polymerization of soluble fibronectin into insoluble fibrils within the extracellular matrix is a dynamic, cell-dependent process that is mediated by a series of events involving the actin cytoskeleton and integrin receptors (2.Magnusson M. Mosher D.F. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 1998; 18: 1363-1370Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar). The adhesion of cells to fibronectin via integrin receptors has been shown to be important in the regulation and coordination of such complex processes as cell growth, differentiation, and migration (1.Hynes R.O. Fibronectins. Springer-Verlag, New York1990Crossref Google Scholar). Ligation of integrins with extracellular matrix molecules, including fibronectin, induces the clustering of actin and actin-binding proteins to focal adhesions, which serves to mechanically couple the extracellular matrix with the actin cytoskeleton (3.Chicurel M.E. Chen C.S. Ingber D.E. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1998; 10: 232-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (452) Google Scholar). Recent studies suggest that the interaction of cells with the extracellular matrix form of fibronectin triggers changes in cell cycle progression (4.Sottile J. Hocking D.C. Swiatek P.J. J.

Commun. 1997; 4: 413-424Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar) that are distinct from those generated by the interaction of cells with nonpolymerized fibronectin. The mechanism by which the matrix form of fibronectin gives rise to cellular phenotypes distinct from protomeric fibronectin is unknown. Studies aimed at understanding the effect of extracellular matrix on cell function indicate that cells respond to fibronectin-coated beads with a local reinforcement of cytoskeletal links that are proportional to the strength of the force on the integrin (10.Choquet D. Felsenfeld D.P. Sheetz M.P. Cell. 1997; 88: 39-48Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1074) Google Scholar). Similarly, cytoskeletal stiffness has been shown to increase in proportion to the stress applied to integrin receptors (11.Wang N. Butler J.P. Ingber D.E. Science. 1993; 260: 1124-1127Crossref PubMed Scopus (2470) Google Scholar). Other studies suggest that cell spreading and migration (12.Pelham Jr., R.J. Wang Y.-L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 13661-13665Crossref PubMed Scopus (2473) Google Scholar) as well as cytoskeletal assembly (13.Tomasek J.J. Haaksma C.J. Eddy R.J. Vaughan M.B. Anat. Rec. 1992; 232: 359-368Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar) are regulated by the mechanical stiffness of the adhesive substrate. Taken together, these data suggest a model in which extracellular matrix fibronectin modulates cell function through local alterations in cytoskeletal organization that are mediated in part by changes in the rigidity of the insoluble fibronectin matrix. The cell-mediated polymerization of soluble fibronectin into an insoluble extracellular matrix is a tightly controlled process that can be rapidly up- or down-regulated (14.Allen-Hoffman L.B. Mosher D.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 14361-14365Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 15.Checovich W. Mosher D. Arterioscler.

As such, the process of polymerizing an insoluble fibronectin matrix may serve as a distinct control mechanism by which the organization of the actin cytoskeleton remains tightly coupled to the organization of the extracellular environment. The present study was undertaken to determine whether the polymerization of fibronectin into an insoluble extracellular matrix specifically influences the organization of the actin cytoskeleton by strengthening the linkage between the integrin and the cytoskeleton. Tension generation due to increases in cytoskeletal contractility may be determined directly by imbedding cells into three-dimensional, floating collagen gels and measuring the degree of gel contraction over time (18.Lee K.-M. Tsai K.Y. Wang N. Ingber D.E. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 274: H76-H82Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In this well-characterized model of wound contraction, cells anchored in the collagen matrix organize and contract collagen fibrils (19.Bell E. Erhlich H.P. Buttle J. Nakatsuji T. Science. 1981; 211: 1052-1054Crossref PubMed Scopus (862) Google Scholar, 20.Bellows C.G. Melcher A.H. Aubin J.E. J. Cell Sci. 1982; 58: 125-138Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 21.Stopak D.

To determine the role of fibronectin deposition on actin organization and mechanical tension generation, fibronectin-null cells were imbedded into floating, native type I collagen matrices and the ability of fibronectin polymerization to stimulate cell spreading and integrin-mediated collagen gel contraction was assessed. Our data indicate that fibronectin polymerization stimulates cell spreading within collagen matrices and triggers a significant increase in cytoskeletal contractility. The increase in contractility induced by fibronectin was dependent on integrin ligation; however, integrin-binding fragments of fibronectin were not sufficient to induce either tension generation or cell spreading. Fibronectin-induced contractility was inhibited by agents that inhibit fibronectin polymerization, suggesting that the process of fibronectin polymerization is critical in triggering cytoskeletal tension generation. In addition, fibronectin-induced contractility was inhibited by pretreatment of cells with C3 exotransferase, suggesting a role for RhoA in the contractile response of cells to fibronectin polymerization. Taken together, these data suggest that the polymerization of a fibronectin matrix triggers integrin-mediated cytoskeletal reorganization and enhanced cell contractility through a mechanism involving the activation of RhoA. Gel electrophoresis supplies were from Bio-Rad. Lipofectin, GRGDSP, and GRGESP peptides were obtained from Life Technologies Inc. Laminin (purified from Engelbreth-Holm-Swarm tumors) and type I rat tail collagen were purchased from Upstate Biotechnology (Lake Placid, NY). Vitronectin was purified from fibronectin- and fibrinogen-depleted human plasma as described previously (25.Yatohgo T. Izumi M. Kashiwagi H. Hayashi M. Cell Struct.

These media do not require serum supplementation. Thus, the fibronectin-null cells were cultured under conditions where no exogenous source of fibronectin or other extracellular matrix protein is present. Human plasma fibronectin was isolated from Cohn's fraction I and II (a gift of Dr. Kenneth Ingham, American Red Cross, Rockville, MD) essentially as described previously (26.Miekka S.I. Ingham K.C. Menache D. Thromb. Res. 1982; 27: 1-14Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar). Figure 1shows a schematic diagram of the various fibronectin fragments used in this study. The 70-kDa amino-terminal fragment of fibronectin was generated by limited digestion with cathepsin D, followed by gelatin affinity chromatography, as described previously (27.McKeown-Longo P.J. Mosher D.F. J. Cell Biol. 1985; 100: 364-374Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar). To cleave the 70-kDa fragment into the 27-kDa heparin-binding and 40-kDa gelatin-binding fragments, the 70-kDa fragment was digested with trypsin, as described (28.Balian G. Click E.M. Bornstein P. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 3234-3236Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The 40-kDa gelatin-binding fragment was isolated from the 27-kDa fragment by retention on gelatin affinity columns (28.Balian G. Click E.M. Bornstein P. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 3234-3236Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The 60-kDa gelatin-binding fragment was prepared by limited digestion of fibronectin with human leukocyte elastase and purified by retention on gelatin-Sepharose followed by anion exchange on DEAE-Sephacel (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), as described (29.McDonald J.A. Kelley D.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 8848-8858Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The 120-kDa cell-binding fragment was prepared by digestion of fibronectin with chymotrypsin and was isolated from the unbound fractions of sequential gelatin- and heparin-Sepharose affinity columns, as described (30.Pierschbacher M.D. Hayman E.G. Ruoslahti E. Cell. 1981; 26: 259-267Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar). The 160/180-kDa cell- and gelatin-binding fragments were generated by limited digestion with trypsin and isolated by retention on gelatin-Sepharose, as described (27.McKeown-Longo P.J. Mosher D.F. J. Cell Biol. 1985; 100: 364-374Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar). Purity of fragments was assessed by SDS-PAGE1 and fragments were frozen at −80 °C until use. A fragment from the first type III repeat of fibronectin, III-1C, was produced as a recombinant fusion protein containing six histidine residues at the carboxyl terminus, as described previously (8.Morla A. Zhang Z. Ruoslahti E. Nature. 1994; 367: 193-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar). Briefly, polymerase chain reaction (PCR) (31.Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar) was used to amplify human fibronectin cDNA (a gift of Dr. Jean Thiery, Institut Curie, Paris, France) encoding amino acids 600–674. Amino acids were numbered from the amino-terminal pyroglutamic acid (32.Petersen T.E. Skorstengaard K. Vibe-Pedersen K. Mosher D.F. Fibronectin. Academic Press, New York1989: 1-24Google Scholar). The primers used for amplification have been described previously (8.Morla A. Zhang Z. Ruoslahti E. Nature. 1994; 367: 193-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar). The PCR product was cloned into the bacterial expression vector, pQE-12 (Qiagen, Santa Clarita, CA). PCR-amplified DNA was sequenced to ensure that no base changes had been introduced during amplification. III-1C was expressed in M15 bacteria and purified on Ni-NTA resin (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Full length rat fibronectin cDNA and a 3′ cDNA clone in which the coding sequence for the RGD site was deleted (33.Schwarzbauer J. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 113: 1463-1473Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar) were generous gifts of Dr. Jean Schwarzbauer (Princeton University, Princeton, NJ). Full length fibronectin cDNA lacking the coding sequence for the RGD site was generated by ligating an RsrII-XbaI fragment from the ΔRGD fibronectin with wild type fibronectin cDNA from which the corresponding RsrII-XbaI fragment was removed. The resulting cDNA encodes for full length fibronectin lacking the RGD site. Recombinant wild type and ΔRGD fibronectin were expressed in insect cells using a baculovirus expression system essentially as described (34.Sottile J. Wiley S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 17192-17198Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Insect cells were infected with recombinant viruses, and conditioned medium was collected 44 h after infection. Insect cells do not produce detectable fibronectin and were maintained in defined media (SF-900-II, Life Technologies) lacking serum supplementation. Thus, recombinant fibronectins were produced under conditions where no nonrecombinant source of fibronectin was present. Purity of III1-C and recombinant fibronectins was assessed by SDS-PAGE, and aliquots were stored at −80 °C before use. 9D2 hybridoma cells were a gift from Dr. Deane Mosher (University of Wisconsin, Madison, WI). The epitope recognized by 9D2 is found within the III-1 module of fibronectin (35.Chernousov M.A. Fogerty F.J. Koteliansky V.E. Mosher D.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 10851-10858Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Ascites was generated by TSD Bioservices (Newark, DE). Immunoglobulins (IgGs) and Fab′ fragments were purified as described previously (36.Hocking D.C. Smith R.K. McKeown-Longo P.J. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 133: 431-444Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Nonimmune mouse F(ab′)2 fragments (Cappel, Durham, NC) were similarly reduced, alkylated, and dialyzed against PBS to produce Fab′ fragments. Purity was assessed by SDS-PAGE and aliquots were stored at −80 °C prior to use. Anti-integrin β1 (Ha2/5), α1 (Ha31/8), α2 (Hma2), α5 (5H10–27), and αv (H9.2B8) subunit antibodies were obtained from Pharmingen (San Diego, CA). Antibodies directed against the gelatin-binding domain (IST-10) and III-5 module (IST-5) of fibronectin were obtained from Chemicon International (Temecula, CA). The anti-fibronectin polycolonal antibody was purchased from Sigma. Purified hamster IgM, hamster IgG, and rat IgG2a were purchased from Pharmingen. Fibronectin-null cells were harvested from monolayer culture by treatment with 0.08% trypsin (Life Technologies) and 0.5 mm EDTA. Trypsin activity was neutralized with an equal volume of 10 mg/ml soybean trypsin inhibitor. Cells were washed one time with 1 mg/ml soybean trypsin inhibitor in PBS and then resuspended in a 1:1 mixture of Cellgro/AimV. Native type I collagen gels were prepared by mixing collagen, 0.1n NaOH, 2× concentrated Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM; Life Technologies) and 1× DMEM on ice such that the final mixture contained 0.8 mg/ml collagen and 1× DMEM (37.Rodt S.A. Reed R.K. Ljungstrom M. Gustafsson T.O. Rubin K. Circ. Res. 1994; 75: 942-948Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Fibronectin-null cells were added to the neutralized type I collagen solutions at 2 × 105 cell/ml. Control wells (no cells) received an equal volume of media alone. Fibronectin and fragments were added to the collagen solutions prior to the addition of cells. To form prepolymerized fibronectin, 20 nm soluble fibronectin was incubated for 30 min at 20 °C with 62.5 μm III-1C (8.Morla A. Zhang Z. Ruoslahti E. Nature. 1994; 367: 193-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar) prior to its addition to the collagen solution. Control cells were incubated with either 20 nmfibronectin or 62.5 μm III-1C incubated under identical conditions. In some experiments, aliquots of cells were incubated with anti-integrin antibodies for 30 min prior to their addition to the collagen solution. To form floating gels, aliquots (0.1 ml/well) of the collagen/cell mixtures were added to wells of 96-well tissue culture plates (Corning/Costar, Corning, NY) precoated with 2% BSA. The collagen/cell mixtures were allowed to polymerize for 1 h at 37 °C in 8% CO2. Following this incubation,100 μl of Cellgro/Aim V was added to wells and the edges of the wells were scored to ensure that the gels were not attached to the wells. In experiments not shown, DMEM was substituted for Cellgro/AimV and similar levels of contraction were observed. To determine the extent of contraction, gels were incubated for various periods of time at 37 °C in 8% CO2 and then removed from the wells and weighed. Collagen gel contraction was measured as a decrease in gel weight, using a Mettler AE260 balance with a sensitivity of 0.1 mg (37.Rodt S.A. Reed R.K. Ljungstrom M. Gustafsson T.O. Rubin K. Circ. Res. 1994; 75: 942-948Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 38.Tingstrom A. Heldin C.-H. Rubin K. J. Cell Sci. 1992; 102: 315-322Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Data are reported as a percentage of the weight of polymerized gels not containing cells (original gel weight); the weight of polymerized collagen gels without cells was typically 50 mg. Each datum point was calculated as the mean ± S.E. of quadruplicate samples. All experiments were performed at least two or more times. Statistical comparison between experimental conditions was performed using the Student's t test for unpaired samples. Differences described as significant in the text arep < 0.01, unless otherwise indicated. Fibronectin polymerization by fibronectin-null cells was determined by imbedding cells in collagen gels in the presence of 40 nmfibronectin, in the absence and presence of 50 μg/ml 9D2 IgG (35.Chernousov M.A. Fogerty F.J. Koteliansky V.E. Mosher D.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 10851-10858Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) or nonimmune mouse IgG. Following a 24-h incubation, gels were removed from the wells and added directly to 2× SDS-PAGE gel buffer (final concentration: 4% SDS and 20% glycerol in 0.05 m Tris, pH 6.8). Some samples were reduced with 2% β-mercaptoethanol. Samples were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting, as described previously (39.Hocking D.C. Sottile J. McKeown-Longo P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 19183-19191Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To pretreat cells with pertussis toxin, monolayer cultures of fibronectin-null cells were washed 2× with DMEM and incubated overnight with 25 ng/ml pertussis toxin diluted in DMEM (40.Grinnell F. Ho C.-H. Lin Y.-C. Skuta G. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 918-923Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). Control cells were incubated with DMEM alone. Cells were then harvested as indicated above. To pretreat cells with C3 exotransferase, Lipofectin was used as a delivery vehicle (40.Grinnell F. Ho C.-H. Lin Y.-C. Skuta G. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 918-923Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar, 41.Kreisberg J.I. Ghosh-Choudhury N. Radnick R.A. Schwartz M.A. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 273: F283-F288PubMed Google Scholar). C3 exotransferase and Lipofectin were diluted in DMEM, incubated for 1 h at 20 °C, and then diluted with additional DMEM to give a final concentration of 2 μg/ml C3 exotransferase and 10 μg/ml Lipofectin. Fibronectin-null cells that had grown to 70% confluence in a monolayer were washed 2× with DMEM and incubated overnight at 37 °C with either C3 exotransferase/Lipofectin, Lipofectin alone, or DMEM. Following this incubation, the media was removed and cells were incubated an additional 1 h with Cellgro/AimV. Cells were then harvested as indicated above. Fibronectin-null cells imbedded in collagen gels were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in Small's cytoskeletal buffer (42.Small J.V. Celis J.E. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 1978; 16: 308-325Google Scholar) for 1 h at 20 °C, rinsed several times with Small's buffer, and then permeabilized for 5 min at −20 °C with ice-cold acetone. Gels were washed 3× with Small's buffer, blocked with 10 mg/ml glycine and 1% BSA, and then stained for actin using FITC-phalloidin (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR). Gels were mounted in o-phenylenediamine, examined using an Olympus BX60 microscope equipped with epifluorescence, and photographed using a digital camera (Spot, Diagnostic Instruments, Sterling Heights, MI). To determine the effect of fibronectin on cytoskeletal tension generation, fibronectin-null cells were imbedded in floating collagen matrices in the absence and presence of increasing concentrations of intact fibronectin. Most adherent cells, including fibroblasts and endothelial cells, continually produce an extensive endogenous fibronectin matrix. Fibronectin-null cells do not produce any detectable fibronectin but are capable of assembling a fibronectin matrix when cultured in the presence of exogenously added fibronectin (4.Sottile J. Hocking D.C. Swiatek P.J. J. Cell Sci. 1998; 111: 2933-2943Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, in this system, the levels of extracellular matrix fibronectin can be precisely manipulated in order to determine the exact role of fibronectin polymerization on cytoskeletal organization. In the absence of fibronectin, fibronectin-null cells imbedded in collagen gels retained approximately 75–50% of the original gel weight. This corresponds to basal levels of contraction of between 25–50% (Figs. Figure 2, Figure 3, Figure 4 and Figure 6, Figure 7, Figure 8, Figure 9, Figure 10, Figure 11). Coincubation of fibronectin-null cells with plasma fibronectin triggered a further, dose-dependent decrease in gel weight (Fig. 2 A); the addition of 80 nm of fibronectin (40 μg/ml) to collagen-imbedded cells resulted in an 83.9 ± 1.6% decrease in gel weight (Fig. 2 A). The decrease in gel weight that occurs as a result of fluid extrusion has previously been shown to parallel the extent of collagen gel contraction (37.Rodt S.A. Reed R.K. Ljungstrom M. Gustafsson T.O. Rubin K. Circ. Res. 1994; 75: 942-948Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 38.Tingstrom A. Heldin C.-H. Rubin K. J. Cell Sci. 1992; 102: 315-322Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Similar results were also obtained by measuring the diameter of contracted gels (data not shown). A similar, significant decrease in collagen gel weight was also observed following addition of fibronectin to human embryonic dermal fibroblasts (data not shown). These data indicate that the interaction of cells with fibronectin stimulates cell contraction.Figure 2Effect of fibronectin on collagen gel contraction. Fibronectin-null cells (2 × 105cell/ml) were mixed with neutralized type I collagen (0.8 mg/ml) on ice in the absence and presence of increasing concentrations of fibronectin (A) or a 40-nm concentration of either fibronectin (Fn), vitronectin (Vn), or laminin (Ln) or an equal volume of PBS (B). Cell/collagen mixtures were added to BSA-coated tissue culture wells and allowed to polymerize at 37 °C for 1 h after which time serum-free media was added.

https://openalex.org/W2072042874,"Recognition of the 5'-cap structure of mRNA by eIF4E is a critical step in the recruitment of most mRNAs to the ribosome. In Caenorhabditis elegans, approximately 70% of mRNAs contain an unusual 2,2,7-trimethylguanosine cap structure as a result of trans-splicing onto the 5' end of the pre-mRNA. The characterization of three eIF4E isoforms in C. elegans (IFE-1, IFE-2, and IFE-3) was reported previously. The present study describes two more eIF4E isoforms expressed in C. elegans, IFE-4 and IFE-5. We analyzed the requirement of each isoform for viability by RNA interference. IFE-3, the most closely related to mammalian eIF4E-1, binds only 7-methylguanosine caps and is essential for viability. In contrast, three closely related isoforms (IFE-1, IFE-2, and IFE-5) bind 2,2, 7-trimethylguanosine caps and are partially redundant, but at least one functional isoform is required for viability. IFE-4, which binds only 7-methylguanosine caps, is most closely related to an unusual eIF4E isoform found in plants (nCBP) and mammals (4E-HP) and is not essential for viability in any combination of IFE knockout. ife-2, ife-3, ife-4, and ife-5 mRNAs are themselves trans-spliced to SL1 spliced leaders. ife-1 mRNA is trans-spliced to an SL2 leader, indicating that its gene resides in a downstream position of an operon."
https://openalex.org/W2031913409,"The c-myc protooncogene product (c-Myc) is a transcription factor and is rapidly induced in resting cells following various mitogenic stimuli. c-Myc is thus suggested to play an important role in the transition from quiescence to proliferation. Despite numerous studies, including those on the connection between cyclin E/cyclin-dependent kinase 2 and c-Myc, little has been clarified about c-Myc in terms of the cell cycle regulation. Here we show that c-Myc can directly bind to the carboxyl-terminal region of the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p21 cip1/waf1/sdi1 and thus partially relieves the p21 of the inhibitory effect on DNA synthesis directed by the proliferating cell nuclear antigen-dependent DNA polymerase δ. As for transcription, on the other hand, the p21 binding to the Myc box II region of c-Myc blocks c-Myc-Max complex formation on the E-box and thereby suppresses the transcriptional activation from the E-box by c-Myc. These results suggest that c-Myc activates DNA replication via inactivation of p21 and that p21, vice versa, represses the transcriptional activity of c-Myc. The balance of the reciprocal inactivation between c-Myc and p21 may determine the course of cellular processes such as cell proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis.

As for the E-box-containing genes that regulate the cell cycle, the cdc25A gene, which encodes protein phosphatase activating cyclin-dependent kinase 2 and 4 (CDK2 and CDK4),1 leading to cell cycle progression, is a good candidate for c-Myc-Max, although the expression levels of cdc25A genes were reported to be the same in c-myc-positive and c-myc-negative (null) Rat-1 cells (19.Bush A. Mateyak M. Dugan K. Obaya A. Adachi S. Sedivy J. Cole M. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 3797-3802Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). Other genes without an E-box therein, including genes of cdc2, cyclin A, cyclin E, and ARF/p19, have been reported to be up-regulated by c-myc, and the cyclin D1 gene was up- or down-regulated by c-myc in different experimental systems (5.Prendergast G.C. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 2913-3016Crossref Scopus (5) Google Scholar, 6.Amati B. Alevizopoulos K. Vlach J. Front. Biosci. 1998; 3: D250-D268Crossref PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar). The mechanisms by which c-myc regulates these genes, however, still remain unclear. The roles of c-Myc in the cell cycle progression were recently further clarified by the results of experiments using c-myc null cells, in which both alleles of the c-myc gene were deleted by a homologous recombination and neither the L-myc nor the N-myc gene was expressed (20.Mateyak M.K. Obaya A.J. Adachi S. Sedivy J.M. Cell Growth Differ. 1997; 8: 1039-1048PubMed Google Scholar). Cell cycle analysis of these c-myc null cells revealed a prolonged G1 phase without any change in the S phase, suggesting that c-Myc has an effect on cell growth (20.Mateyak M.K. Obaya A.J. Adachi S. Sedivy J.M. Cell Growth Differ. 1997; 8: 1039-1048PubMed Google Scholar). In addition to the cell cycle regulation, c-Myc has various functions, including cell differentiation, apoptosis induction, and cell oncogenesis. Various c-Myc-associated proteins that may contribute to the respective functions of c-Myc have been identified. Max (21.Lüscher B. Eisenman R.N.

Bhatia K. Magrath I.T. Dang C.V. Dalla-Favera R. Science. 1994; 264: 251-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar, 31.Beijersbergen R.L. Hijmans E.M. Zhu L. Bernards R.

Considering both the c-Myc-regulating genes and c-Myc-associated proteins with regard to cell cycle movement, c-Myc is assumed to be a positive regulator of G1-specific-CDKs, in particular, cyclin E-CDK2. Deregulated expression of c-myc is correlated to high levels of expression of both cyclin A and cyclin E genes (4.Dang C.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 1-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (1395) Google Scholar, 5.Prendergast G.C. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 2913-3016Crossref Scopus (5) Google Scholar, 6.Amati B. Alevizopoulos K. Vlach J. Front. Biosci. 1998; 3: D250-D268Crossref PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar), and direct induction of cyclin E mRNA by c-mychas been reported (6.Amati B. Alevizopoulos K. Vlach J. Front. Biosci. 1998; 3: D250-D268Crossref PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar). There are at least three possible mechanisms by which c-myc enhances CDK functions. The first is inactivation of CDK inhibitors such as p27 and probably p21 and p57. The c-myc expression leads to a decrease in the p27 level and interference in the p27 function (41.Vlach J. Hennecke S. Alevizopoulos K. Conti D. Amati B. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6595-6604Crossref PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar). The second is induction ofcdc25A expression, and the third is deregulation of cyclin E expression (42.Steiner P. Philipp A. Lukas J. Godden-Kent D. Pagano M. Mittnacht S. Bartek J. Eilers M. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 4814-4826Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). Ectopic or constitutive expression of either c-myc or cyclin E prevents growth arrest induced by p16, an inhibitor of cyclin D-CDK4 that inhibits phosphorylation of Rb family proteins of pRb, p107, and p130. Interaction between c-Myc and p107, therefore, leads to the assumption that c-Myc is a functional target of cyclin D-CDK4. In this study, we screened the known cell cycle-regulating proteins that bind to c-Myc, and we found that p21, a CDK inhibitor, directly binds to the transactivation domain of c-Myc via the PCNA-binding region. c-Myc partially rescued the DNA polymerase δ-PCNA activity inhibited by p21, and p21 abrogated the c-Myc-Max complex formation followed by E-box-dependent transcription. Complementary DNA fragments of cyclins, CDKs, and CDK inhibitors were generated by the polymerase chain reaction with the following primers: 5′-GGGGATCCATG plus four codons corresponding to each cDNA (amino acids 2–5)-3′ and 5′-GGGTCGAC plus five anti-codons corresponding to each cDNA (stop codon to last four amino acids)-3′. All template cDNAs for polymerase chain reaction were of human origin except CDK4 (mouse) and were gifts from other laboratories. The generated fragments were digested withBamHI and SalI and subcloned into theBamHI–SalI site of pGEX-6P-1 (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The same fragments were also subcloned into theBamHI–XhoI site of pcDNA3 (Invitrogen). The polymerase chain reaction inserts and insert-vector junctions were verified by DNA sequence analysis. Full-length or deletion mutants of c-myc coding sequences from the corresponding pGAD424-c-myc plasmids (39.Taira T. Maëda J. Onishi T. Kitaura H. Yoshida S. Kato H. Ikeda M. Tamai K. Iguchi-Ariga S.M.M. Ariga H. Genes Cells. 1998; 3: 549-565Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar) were subcloned into theEcoRI–SalI site of the pMal-Pre vector. pMal-Pre is a modified vector for pMal-cRi (expression vector for maltose-binding protein (MBP)-tagged protein (New England Biolabs)), in which the factor Xa cleavage sequence was replaced by the recognition sequence for PreScission protease (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Glutathione S-transferase (GST) fusion proteins were expressed in Escherichia coli BL21 (DE3) and purified using glutathione beads. c-Myc proteins were purified with maltose beads fromE. coli BL21 (DE3) transformed with the pMal-Pre plasmids after PreScission (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) protease cleavage of the MBP portion. GST fusion proteins (20 pmol) were incubated with c-Myc protein (20 pmol) in a binding buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 150 mm NaCl, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm EDTA, and 2.5 mg/ml gelatin) for 2 h at 4 °C. The GST proteins were immobilized on glutathione-Sepharose for 30 min at 4 °C and washed extensively with the binding buffer seven times. Co-immunoprecipitation was performed using 293 cell lysates co-infected with Ad-c-myc and Ad-p21 viruses (43.Leone G. DeGregori J. Sears R. Jakoi L. Nevins J.R. Nature. 1997; 387: 422-426Crossref PubMed Scopus (401) Google Scholar) in a lysis buffer (20 mm Tris (pH 7.5), 150 mm NaCl, 0.2% Nonidet P-40, 2 mm EDTA, 2 mm dithiothreitol). Antigen-antibody complexes were immobilized on protein G-Sepharose for 30 min at 4 °C and washed extensively with the lysis buffer five times. The bound proteins were separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (7.5 or 12.5% polyacrylamide gel containing SDS for c-Myc or p21 detection, respectively) and transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane. After blocking with 5% non-fat milk, membranes were incubated with an anti-c-Myc monoclonal antibody (C-33; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA)) or an anti-Cip1 monoclonal antibody (C24420; Transduction Laboratories). To detect c-Myc mutants lacking the N-proximal regions, another anti-c-Myc antibody (9E10) (44.Evan G.I. Lewis G.K. Ramsay G. Bishop J.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1985; 5: 3610-3616Crossref PubMed Scopus (2166) Google Scholar) was used. Reacted proteins were detected by horseradish peroxidase-anti-mouse IgG antibody and an ECL (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) system. Quantitation was performed using Molecular Imager (Bio-Rad). A reaction mixture (5 μl) containing 30 mm HEPES (pH 7.5), 7 mmMgCl2, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 250 pmol of poly(dA)-oligo(dT) (20:1), 0.05 mm [α-32P]TTP (3000 cpm/pmol), calf thymus polymerase δ, PCNA (20 ng), and various amounts of c-Myc mutant proteins was incubated at 37 °C for 30 min (45.Tsurimoto T. Stillman B. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 3883-3889Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). The incorporated dTMP was measured as a DE81 paper-adsorbed count after washing with 0.5m Na2HPO4. The binding reactions contained 0.5 ng of the radiolabeled E-box sequence (CCCCCACCACGTGGTGCCTGA), 25 mm HEPES (pH 7.5), 50 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm EDTA, 5% glycerol, 10 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, and the indicated amount of protein. A reaction mixture (15 μl) was incubated at 20 °C for 20 min. The resulting protein-DNA complexes were resolved on 4% polyacrylamide gels containing 0.25× TBE (22.5 mmTris, 22.5 mm H3BO4, and 0.63 mm EDTA) at 4 °C. CV-1 and 293 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. CV-1 cells were transfected with plasmids by the standard calcium phosphate precipitation procedure. Two μg of a CAT reporter plasmid and 1 μg of pCMV-β-gal along with 1 μg of pSRα-c-Myc and increasing amounts of the p21 expression vector (0.5 and 4 μg) was co-transfected. The amount of cytomegalovirus promoter in the transfection was kept constant by using an empty pCMV vector. After normalization of the transfection efficiency with β-galactosidase activity, a CAT assay was performed. To investigate unidentified roles of c-Myc in cell cycle control, we screened various cell cycle regulators for association with c-Myc by use of in vitro pull-down assays. CDKs, cyclins, and CDK inhibitors, as indicated in Fig.1 a, were expressed in E. coli as GST-tagged fusion proteins, purified, and trapped on glutathione beads. Max, reported to be a heterodimeric partner of c-Myc (21.Lüscher B. Eisenman R.N. Genes Dev. 1990; 4: 2025-2035Crossref PubMed Scopus (362) Google Scholar, 22.Blackwood E.M. Eisenman R.N. Science. 1991; 251: 1211-1217Crossref PubMed Scopus (1480) Google Scholar, 23.Blackwood E.M. Lüscher B. Eisenman R.N. Genes Dev. 1992; 6: 71-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar), was also expressed as a GST fusion protein and was similarly treated. A tag-free recombinant full-length c-Myc was released by PreScission protease from an MBP-fused c-Myc and applied on the beads coupled with GST proteins. After extensive washing of the beads, proteins still bound to the beads were blotted with an anti-c-Myc antibody (C-33; Santa Cruz Biotechnology). The c-Myc protein was detected only in the eluates from the beads binding Max or p21 cip1/waf1/sdi1, and p21 cip1/waf1/sdi1 was thus implicated as a c-Myc-associating protein whose binding activity was comparable with that of Max. To examine the in vivoassociation between c-Myc and p21, 293 cells were double-infected with recombinant adenoviruses expressing c-Myc or p21 (43.Leone G. DeGregori J. Sears R. Jakoi L. Nevins J.R. Nature. 1997; 387: 422-426Crossref PubMed Scopus (401) Google Scholar). The cell extract was immunoprecipitated with either an anti-p21 (C24420; Transduction Laboratories) or the anti-c-Myc antibody or nonspecific IgG and reciprocally blotted by the other antibody (Fig. 1 b). The signal of p21 was observed in the precipitate with the anti-c-Myc antibody (Fig. 1 b, lane 3) but not in the precipitate with IgG (Fig. 1 b, lane 2), and c-Myc was detected in the precipitate with the anti-p21 antibody (Fig. 1 b, lane 6) but not in the precipitate with IgG (Fig. 1 b,lane 5). c-Myc and p21, which directly interactedin vitro, were hence thought to be involved in the same complex in vivo. To define the domain of c-Myc required for the interaction with p21, we performed in vitro pull-down assays. A series of c-Myc deletion mutants as well as the wild-type c-Myc were expressed inE. coli as MBP fusion proteins and released from MBP by PreScission protease. The c-Myc proteins were applied to the glutathione beads coupled with GST, GST-tagged p21, or GST-tagged Max, and the proteins bound to the beads were analyzed as in Fig.1 a. Among the mutants lacking the N-proximal regions, Δ42 and Δ103 bind to GST-p21 but not to GST alone (Fig.2 a, middle panel, lanes 3–6). The results suggested that the transactivation domain of c-Myc containingmyc boxes 1 (MBI) and 2 (MBII) is required for the interaction with p21. All of the N-proximal mutants preserved the basic/helix-loop-helix/leucine zipper (bHLHLZ) structure and thereby bound to GST-Max (Fig. 2 a, lower panel). The N-proximal half of c-Myc (Δ10), lacking bHLHLZ, associated with p21 as efficiently as did the wild-type c-Myc (Fig. 2 b, lanes 2 and 4) but completely lost the binding activity to p21 when MBII was deleted (Fig. 2 b, lane 10). The deletion of MBI, on the other hand, did not greatly affect the binding activity (Fig. 2 b, lane 6). MBII of c-Myc was thus thought to be required for the binding to p21. The region of p21 essential for the interaction with c-Myc was similarly examined by in vitro pull-down assays. A series of deletion mutants of p21 were prepared as GST-tagged proteins and bound to glutathione beads. The recombinant MBP-free c-Myc or PCNA was applied to the beads, and the proteins that had bound to the beads were blotted with the anti-c-Myc antibody (C-33) or an anti-PCNA antibody (sc-56; Santa Cruz Biotechnology) (Fig.3). Among the p21 mutants tested, only p21(87–164) and p21(139–164) associated with c-Myc as efficiently as did the wild-type p21 (Fig. 3 b, upper panel, lanes 2, 4, and7). The results suggested that amino acids 139–164 in the C-proximal half of p21 are required for the interaction with c-Myc. The suggested region, amino acids 139–164, of p21 contains the domains reported for the association with PCNA and cyclin (cyclin 2),i.e. amino acids 141–152 and 153–159, respectively (46.Chen J. Jackson P.K. Kirschner M.W. Dutta A. Nature. 1995; 374: 386-388Crossref PubMed Scopus (512) Google Scholar,47.Fotedar R. Fitzgerald P. Rousselle T. Cannella D. Doree M. Messier H. Fotedar A. Oncogene. 1996; 12: 2155-2164PubMed Google Scholar). PCNA bound to the c-Myc-interacting mutants (Fig. 3 b,lower panel, lanes 2,4, and 7). To another mutant, p21-(1–158), which carried the PCNA binding domain but lacked the cyclin 2 binding domain, PCNA interacted as strongly as it did to the wild-type p21, while the interaction between c-Myc and p21-(1–158) was much weaker than that between c-Myc and the wild-type p21 (Fig. 3 b,lane 8). The mutant p21-(149–164), lacking the PCNA binding domain but carrying the cyclin 2 binding domain, was faintly bound by c-Myc but not by PCNA (Fig. 3 b,lane 9). The results indicated that c-Myc shared the interacting domain on p21 with PCNA but that the c-Myc/p21 association required, in addition to the PCNA binding domain, several amino acids on the C-proximal side overlapping the cyclin binding domain. A mutant of p57, p57-(221–316), carrying the sequence required for interaction with PCNA (48.Watanabe H. Pan Z.Q. Schreiber-Agus N. DePinho R.A. Hurwitz J. Xiong Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 1392-1397Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar), was also prepared as a GST-tagged protein, immobilized on the beads, and subjected to similar pull-down assays with c-Myc or PCNA. PCNA, but not c-Myc, bound to p57-(221–316) (Fig. 3 b, lane 10). This result also suggested that the PCNA binding sequence is not sufficient for the c-Myc binding to p21. Since c-Myc and PCNA shared the binding domain on p21, we examined the two proteins for competitive binding to p21. The GST-tagged p21 was immobilized on glutathione-Sepharose beads, and either the recombinant c-Myc or PCNA was applied to the beads together with increasing amounts of the other protein. After extensive washing, proteins bound to the beads were blotted with either the anti-c-Myc antibody or the anti-PCNA antibody (Fig. 3 c). The binding of both c-Myc and PCNA to p21 was decreased by increasing amounts of the other protein. c-Myc and PCNA were thus thought to competitively interact with p21 on the overlapping domain of p21. To verify the physiological significance of the c-Myc/p21 interaction, the activity of p21 as an inhibitor of PCNA-dependent DNA polymerase δ-directed DNA synthesis was examined in the presence of c-Myc in vitro (Fig. 3 d). Two c-Myc mutants, c-MycΔ10 with the p21 binding activity and c-MycΔ177 without the activity (see Fig. 2), were prepared as MBP-fused proteins and released by PreScission protease. The PCNA-dependent DNA synthesis was >90% inhibited by PCNA (Fig. 3 d, lanes 1 and 2), and the inhibition was partially released by the addition of c-MycΔ10 (Fig. 3 d,lanes 3–8), but not of c-MycΔ177 (Fig.3 d, lanes 9–14), to the system. The results suggested that the c-Myc mutant with the p21 binding activity interfered with the p21-PCNA complex formation, thus releasing the PCNA inactivation by p21 and activating DNA replication as a result, while the other c-Myc mutant lacking the p21 binding activity did not yield such phenomena. c-Myc was hence implied to act as an activator of DNA replication via inactivation of p21. The addition of c-MycΔ10 did not fully restore the DNA synthesis activity. For full restoration, factors other than c-Myc may be also required, or the intact c-Myc appropriately processed in vivo might function more efficiently. c-Myc was thus thought to bind to p21 to inhibit its suppressing function of DNA synthesis. We then examined whether the c-Myc/p21 interaction also affected the function of c-Myc. c-Myc associates with Max to activate the transcription of a series of c-Myc-responsive genes containing the consensus target sequence CACGTG or E-box. Transient transfection experiments were performed to examine the effect of p21 on the E-box-dependent transactivation by c-Myc. Expression vectors for various proteins including the wild type (p21(WT)) and a mutated p21 (p21-(1–138)) lacking the c-Myc binding activity were transfected to CV-1 cells together with a c-Myc expression vector and a reporter plasmid containing the CAT gene linked to either 4× E-box (4×E) or 4× mutated E-box (4×E mut). Two days after transfection, the cell lysate was prepared and examined for CAT activity. The CAT activity due to 4×E was increased 5-fold by the c-Myc expression vector (Fig. 4 a,upper panel, lanes 1 and2). Co-transfection of the expression vector for the wild-type p21 suppressed the c-Myc-mediated transactivation (Fig.4 a, upper panel, lanes 7 and 8). It was reported that an excess amount of Max suppresses the transcription activity of c-Myc (49.Kretzner L. Blackwood E.M. Eisenman R.N. Nature. 1992; 359: 426-429Crossref PubMed Scopus (379) Google Scholar). Compared with Max (49.Kretzner L. Blackwood E.M. Eisenman R.N. Nature. 1992; 359: 426-429Crossref PubMed Scopus (379) Google Scholar) and the Rb-related p107 (30.Gu W. Bhatia K. Magrath I.T. Dang C.V. Dalla-Favera R. Science. 1994; 264: 251-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar, 31.Beijersbergen R.L. Hijmans E.M. Zhu L. Bernards R. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 4080-4086Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar), both of which are c-Myc-associating proteins, the suppression by p21 was stronger than that by p107 (Fig. 4 a, upper panel,lanes 5 and 6) but smaller than that by Max (Fig. 4 a, upper panel,lanes 3 and 4). A c-Myc binding-deficient mutant of p21, p21-(1–138), on the other hand, did not suppress the transactivation by c-Myc (Fig. 4 a,upper panel, lanes 9 and10). The results suggested that p21 suppressed the transactivation of c-Myc by binding to the protein. Other CDK inhibitors such as p15 INK4b, p16 INK4a, p27 KIP1 or p57 KIP2 did not suppress the transactivation (Fig. 4 a, upper panel,lanes 11–18). The transcription from the mutated E-box was not affected by the expression vector for c-Myc, Max, p107, or p21 (Fig. 4 a, lower panel). To further confirm that p21 represses the c-Myc-mediated transactivation by direct protein-protein interaction, possible effects of p21 on the DNA-binding activity of the c-Myc-Max complex were examined by electrophoretic mobility shift assays. Various combinations of the recombinant c-Myc, Max, GST-Mad, and p21 were incubated with labeled oligonucleotides corresponding to the E-box as a probe. No nucleoprotein complex was observed in the incubation of the probe with p21 by itself (Fig. 4 b, lanes 2–4). The formation of the Max-Max homodimer or GST-Myc-Max heterodimer on the E-box probe was not affected by the addition of excess amounts of p21 (Fig. 4 b, lanes 5–8 and13–16). The c-Myc-Max heterodimer, on the other hand, was decreased by the addition of p21 in a dose-dependent manner, and, moreover, the Myc-Max homodimer appeared instead (Fig.4 b, lanes 9–12). The results suggested that p21 interfered with the association between c-Myc and Max, although Max bound to the bHLHLZ structure in the C-terminal region of c-Myc and p21 interacted with c-Myc via MBII in the N-proximal region. The heterodimer formation between Max and c-Myc mutants, Δ177 and Δ337, which did not interact with p21, was not affected by p21 (Fig. 4 c, lanes 3–10). Various deletion mutants of p21 as well as p27 were then prepared as GST-tagged proteins and added to the incubation of c-Myc, Max, and the E-box probe. The p21 mutants capable of binding to c-Myc, p21-(139–164) and p21-(87–164), abrogated the c-Myc-Max complex (Fig. 4 d, lanes 11–14), while neither the p21 mutants lacking the c-Myc binding activity, p21-(1–90) and p21-(87–138), nor GST alone nor p27 affected the c-Myc-Max complex formation (Fig. 4 d, lanes 3–10). The association between p21 and c-Myc was thus implied to result in the repression of the E-box-dependent transactivation by c-Myc. These results suggested that p21 is a repressor for the c-Myc transactivation via abrogation of the c-Myc-Max heterodimer formation on the E-box. We have shown that the CDK inhibitor p21 cip1/waf1/sdi1 (p21) directly binds to c-Myc and that p21 thus interferes with the interaction between c-Myc and other proteins such as Max. c-Myc,vice versa, inhibited the association between p21 and PCNA. c-Myc was hence thought to promote DNA replication via inactivation of p21 by releasing the protein from PCNA, while p21 was thought to repress the c-Myc-dependent transactivation by inhibiting the c-Myc/Max interaction. These results implying reciprocal inactivation between c-Myc and p21 may explain the previous observation of SV40 DNA replication being stimulated in vivo by c-Myc (50.Classon M. Henriksson M. Sumegi J. Klein G. Hammaskjold M.L. Nature. 1987; 330: 272-274Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 51.Classon M. Henriksson M. Klein G. Sumegi J. Oncogene. 1990; 5: 1371-1376PubMed Google Scholar) but inhibited in vitro by p21 (52.Waga S. Hannon G.J. Beach D. Stillman B. Nature. 1994; 369 (568): 574Crossref PubMed Scopus (1591) Google Scholar). c-Myc may stimulate the SV40 DNA replication by depriving p21 from the p21-PCNA complex and thus activating PCNA. A transient increase of p21 in cells following growth factor stimuli might result in release of c-Myc from the transactivation complex with Max, and thus c-Myc may turn toward its functions in DNA replication. c-Myc may also release CDK2 from p21 and thus lead to cell cycle progression via E2F activation or directly to the triggering of the initiation of DNA replication. The amounts of c-Myc and p21 in cells change during the cell cycle. In G1, the amount of p21 is higher than that of c-Myc, and the amount of p21 is smaller than that of c-Myc during the S phase of the cell cycle (for a review, see Ref. 6.Amati B. Alevizopoulos K. Vlach J. Front. Biosci. 1998; 3: D250-D268Crossref PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar and references therein). It is therefore speculated that the amounts of both proteins are almost the same at a transition point between G1 and S phases. The balance determined by the reciprocal inactivation between c-Myc and p21 may play an important role in the cell cycle regulation. The mutual regulation between c-Myc and p21 suggested here strongly implied inseparable links between DNA replication and transcription, a most important switch protein for which is c-Myc.

B-MYB, similarly to other members of the family, binds to DNA through the consensus sequence (C/T)AACNG, resulting in transactivation of consensus site-bearing promoters. In practice, however, it has been quite difficult to detect B-MYB-dependent transactivation because of variable response in different cell types (8.Tashiro S. Takemoto Y. Handa H. Ishii S. Oncogene. 1995; 10: 1699-1707PubMed Google Scholar). The leading hypothesis describes B-MYB as a constitutively repressed molecule that requires post-translational modifications to disclose its activity. In this regard, several groups (9.Saville M.K. Watson R.J. Oncogene. 1998; 17: 2679-2689Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar, 10.Sala A. Kundu M. Casella I. Engelhard A. Calabretta B. Grasso L. Paggi M.G. Giordano A. Watson R.J. Khalili K. Peschle C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 532-536Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar) have shown that phosphorylation of the B-MYB protein induced by the CDK2/cyclin A kinase results in activation of the B-MYB transactivating function. Activation is also achieved by truncation of the carboxyl terminus of the B-MYB molecule (11.Lane S. Farlie P. Watson R. Oncogene. 1997; 14: 2445-2453Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 12.Ziebold U. Bartsch O. Marais R. Ferrari S. Klempnauer K.H. Curr. Biol. 1997; 7: 253-260Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Although cyclin-induced phosphorylation relieves inhibition exerted by the carboxyl terminus, a B-MYB mutant deleted at the carboxyl terminus is activated by enforced expression of CDK2/cyclin A (11.Lane S. Farlie P. Watson R. Oncogene. 1997; 14: 2445-2453Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). This suggests that, in addition to relieving intramolecular repression, phosphorylation may enhance B-MYB cross-talk with putative co-activators or may inhibit binding of co-repressors. This hypothesis is corroborated by evidence suggesting that the B-MYB transactivating function depends on the cellular context and that it correlates with the binding of cellular proteins to specific B-MYB domains (8.Tashiro S. Takemoto Y. Handa H. Ishii S. Oncogene. 1995; 10: 1699-1707PubMed Google Scholar). Numerous reports have established a fundamental requirement for B-MYB expression during the growth and survival of normal and tumorigenic cell lines, whereas ectopic expression of a B-MYB transgene results in a perturbed cell cycle and differentiative pattern (13.Sala A. Calabretta B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 10415-10419Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar, 14.Lin D. Fiscella M. O'Connor P.M. Jackman J. Chen M. Luo L.L. Sala A. Travali S.

These results correlate well with circumstantial evidence suggesting that abnormal B-MYBexpression may contribute to tumorigenesis. For example, B-MYB is overexpressed during the progression of human small cell lung carcinoma, and high B-MYB expression is predictive, independently from other markers such as N-MYC, of poor survival of child bearing neuroblastoma tumors (19.Hibi K. Liu Q. Beaudry G.A. Madden S.L. Westra W.H. Wehage S.L. Yang S.C. Heitmiller R.F. Bertelsen A.H. Sidransky D. Jen J. Cancer Res. 1998; 58: 5690-5694PubMed Google Scholar, 20.Raschella‘ G. Cesi V.

A current hypothesis is that B-MYB may activate sets of genes involved in the regulation of the cell cycle and/or DNA synthesis. Klempnauer and co-workers (21.Mink S. Kerber U. Klempnauer K.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 1316-1325Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar) have shown that the v-MYB DNA-binding domain, which consists of three imperfect reiterations shared among all MYB proteins, interacts with the mammalian transactivator C/EBPβ. C/v-MYB and MYB-like proteins from mammalian to yeast also interact with regulatory proteins through the conserved tryptophan repeat structure (22.Pfitzner E. Kirfel J. Becker P. Rolke A. Schule R.

As a basis of the present study, we hypothesized that proteins binding to the B-MYB DNA-binding domain may function as regulatory molecules, contributing to B-MYB transcriptional activity. To address this issue, a hybrid protein consisting of GST fused to the B-MYB DNA-binding domain was used as bait and mixed with HL60 cell lysate to isolate binding proteins. A nuclear protein of 110 kDa, which was identified as poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP),1 bound to the GST-B-MYB fusion protein. PARP is associated with chromatin and catalyzes the transfer of poly(ADP)-ribose units to acceptor proteins. Interestingly, PARP and B-MYB share several characteristics. Both proteins are nuclear, and transcription of their genes is down-regulated during mammalian cell differentiation, and they are both able to suppress in vitro induced differentiation when expressed ectopically in mammalian cells (15.Raschell G. Negroni A. Sala A. Pucci S. Romeo A. Calabretta B. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 8540-8545Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar, 17.Bies J. Hoffman B. Amanullah A. Giese T.

Meckling-Gill K.A. Biochem. J. 1995; 308: 131-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Among other functions attributed to PARP is apoptosis regulation and DNA repair (28.Jeggo P.A. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: 49-51Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 29.Pieper A.A. Verma A. Zhang J. Snyder S.H. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 1999; 20: 171-181Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (471) Google Scholar). Recent studies have implicated PARP in the regulation of gene transcription through association with specific transcription factors. PARP can behave both as an inhibitor or stimulator of the bound transcription factors, suggesting that its biological role may depend on the availability of specific partners, the cell type, and the differentiative and/or proliferative status of the cell. For example, PARP binds to and inactivates the DNA-binding function of p53, and it is a suppressor of RAR/RXR signaling (30.Kumari S.R. Mendoza-Alvarez H. Alvarez-Gonzalez R. Cancer Res. 1998; 58: 5075-5078PubMed Google Scholar, 31.Miyamoto T. Kakizawa T. Hashizume K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 2644-2649Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). On the other hand, PARP increases the on-rate binding of nuclear proteins to thePAX-6 gene enhancer, resulting in increased gene transcription, and it is a co-activator of the AP2 transcription factor (32.Plaza S. Aumercier M. Bailly M. Dozier C. Saule S. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 1041-1051Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 33.Kannan P., Yu, Y. Wankhade S. Tainsky M.A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 27: 866-874Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Furthermore, PARP associates with OCT-1, enhancing its recruitment onto DNA (34.Nie J. Sakamoto S. Song D. Qu Z. Ota K. Taniguchi T. FEBS Lett. 1998; 424: 27-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Here we show that endogenous B-MYB and PARP co-immunoprecipitate from nuclear extracts of HL60 cells. Overexpression of PARP and B-MYB results in synergistic activation of a MYB-responsive promoter, suggesting that PARP is a B-MYB-specific co-activator. The human osteosarcoma tumor cell line SAOS2 was obtained from ATCC and was cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 15% fetal calf serum. The human hematopoietic HL60 cell line was cultured in RPMI 1640 medium with 10% fetal calf serum. An EcoRI-BamHI fragment (900 base pairs) containing the DNA-binding domain of human B-MYB, was cloned into pGEX2T (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and cut withEcoRI-BamHI to generate pGST-B-MYB-DBD. This construct encodes the glutathioneS-transferase protein (GST) in-frame with the B-MYB DNA-binding domain. The construction was verified by sequencing. Bacteria strain BL21 was used for producing the GST-B-MYB-DBD fusion protein. After induction for 2 h with 0.1 mmisopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside, the bacteria were harvested and resuspended in phosphate-buffered saline. The cells were treated by several cycles of sonication on ice and centrifuged. The supernatant, containing soluble recombinant protein, was incubated with glutathione-agarose beads (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) for 1 h at 4 °C, washed three times with phosphate-buffered saline, and used directly for protein binding assays. 50 × 10−6 exponentially growing HL60 cells were cultured for 3 h in methionine- and cysteine-free RPMI medium supplemented with 10% dialyzed fetal bovine serum (Life Technologies, Inc.) containing pro-Mix [35S]methionine and -cysteine cell labeling mix (NEN Life Science Products). Labeled cells were lysed in 1 ml of Buffer 1 (20 mm KOH-Hepes, pH 8.0, 25 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 5 mmdithiothreitol, protease inhibitors) and centrifuged at 1500 rpm for 5 min at 4 °C. The supernatant, containing the cytoplasmic fraction, was stored for further analysis, whereas the nuclear pellet was incubated in 1 ml of Buffer 2 (20 mm KOH-Hepes, pH 8.0, 0.1 mm EDTA, 5 mm MgCl2, 0.5m NaCl, 20% glycerol, protease inhibitors) for 10 min at 4 °C and cleared by centrifugation. Both cytoplasmic and nuclear extracts were pre-cleared by mixing 100 μl of GST-Sepharose beads (50% slurry, Santa Cruz Biotechnology) in binding buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 0.03% Nonidet P-40, 2 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm ZnSO4, 20 mm β-mercaptoethanol). After rocking for 1 h at 4 °C, the beads were discarded and the supernatants recovered. Aliquots of 0.5 ml of pre-cleared lysates were incubated with 20 μl of glutathione-Sepharose beads loaded with 4 μg of GST-B-MYB-DBD with or without 3 μg of a synthetic double-stranded oligonucleotide containing the MYB-binding site (tcgacacatt ataacgg ttttttagc). As further controls, we mixed lysates with GST-A-MYB-DBD (a kind gift of Martino Introna) and GST. The beads were washed five times with 1 ml of binding buffer, and the bound proteins were eluted with SDS sample buffer and analyzed on a 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel. PARP protein was translatedin vitro from the pSPARP plasmid (a kind gift of Dr. Perry Kannan) with the TNT kit according to manufacturer's instructions (Promega). A total of 1 × 109 HL60 cells were lysed. After pre-clearing with GST-coated beads, nuclear extracts were adsorbed with GST-B-MYB-DBD beads. After washings, the bound proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE and visualized by Coomassie Blue staining. In-gel digestion was followed by mass spectrometry analysis performed by the Protein Analysis Laboratory at the University of Davis, CA. Nuclear HL60 cell lysates were pre-cleared with 50 μl of protein A-Sepharose and immunoprecipitated with PARP polyclonal or monoclonal antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology or Biomol), B-MYB (10.Sala A. Kundu M. Casella I. Engelhard A. Calabretta B. Grasso L. Paggi M.G. Giordano A. Watson R.J. Khalili K. Peschle C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

After five washes, samples were run on an SDS-polyacrylamide gel and transferred to nitrocellulose. Western blot was performed with B-MYB or PARP antibody in Blotto (5% dry-milk in phosphate-buffered saline) plus 0.1% Nonidet P-40. After washings and incubation with secondary antibody coupled to peroxidase, the filter was developed using a chemiluminescent substrate according to manufacturer's instructions (ECL-plus, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). SAOS2 cells were transfected in 30-mm plates according to the calcium-phosphate precipitation method, as described (10.Sala A. Kundu M. Casella I. Engelhard A. Calabretta B. Grasso L. Paggi M.G. Giordano A. Watson R.J. Khalili K. Peschle C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 532-536Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). pCMV-B-MYB (14.Lin D. Fiscella M. O'Connor P.M. Jackman J.

Saitta B. De Luca P. Cervellera M.N. Casella I. Lewis R.E. Watson R. Peschle C. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 1333-1339Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar), pcDNA3-PARPwt, pcDNA3-C908R, or M890V (31.Miyamoto T. Kakizawa T. Hashizume K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 2644-2649Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar) were transfected at a 1:1 ratio (1 μg each). Since B-MYB transactivates viral promoters through MYB and SP1 sites (36.Sala A. Saitta B. De Luca P. Cervellera M.N. Casella I. Lewis R.E. Watson R. Peschle C. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 1333-1339Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar), we avoided the use of plasmids commonly used for transfection normalization. For this reason, each experimental point was performed in triplicate, and experiments were repeated at least three times. Luciferase assay was carried out with a kit according to manufacturer's instructions (Promega). Light emission was evaluated with the aid of a scintillation counter and expressed as counts per min. In order to identify proteins interacting with the amino terminus of the B-MYB protein, HL60 cells were metabolically labeled with [35S]methionine, and nuclear or cytoplasmic protein lysates were prepared. Protein lysates were incubated with GST-B-MYB fusion protein, and cellular proteins binding to GST-B-MYB were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and autoradiography. Several cytoplasmic and nuclear proteins bound to the bait, and a nuclear protein of approximately 110 kDa (p110) was consistently eluted in multiple independent experiments. The B-MYB/p110 interaction was specific, since p110 bound the A-MYB DNA-binding domain, which is 75% identical to the B-MYB domain, with much lower affinity, and it did not bind to GST (Fig. 1, panel N). Several cytoplasmic proteins bound the fusion proteins, and a 22-kDa protein was consistently co-eluted with both A-MYB and B-MYB (Fig. 1,panel C). The identity of this cytoplasmic protein was not investigated further. A preparative gel was loaded with the eluate from GST-B-MYB protein mixed with nuclear lysates from 109 HL60 cells. Protein microsequencing determined that the 110-kDa protein was PARP. To identify positively PARP as the interacting protein, the eluted material was loaded onto an SDS-PAGE mini-gel and subjected to Western blot analysis with a PARP-specific monoclonal antibody. Indeed, eluate from GST-B-MYB, but not from GST alone, contained PARP protein that was recognized by the PARP antibody (Fig.2 A). To corroborate the hypothesis that PARP and B-MYB are able to form a stable heterodimerin vitro, we mixed [35S]methionine-labeled PARP with GST-B-MYB fusion protein. In vitro translated PARP bound efficiently to B-MYB, but not to GST, as detected by pull-down experiments (Fig. 2 B). The B-MYB/PARP interaction is existing naturally in the living cell, since Western blot analysis showed that the PARP antibody, but not the control antibody, was able to co-immunoprecipitate B-MYB protein from HL60 nuclear extracts (Fig.3 A). Consistent with this result, a B-MYB-specific polyclonal antibody was able to co-immunoprecipitate PARP protein from HL60 cells (Fig. 3 B).Figure 3An endogenous PARP·B-MYB complex is found in nuclear extracts of HL60 cells. Immunoprecipitation/Western blot analysis was performed as described under “Material and Methods.” Identical amounts of HL60 nuclear lysates were immunoprecipitated with the relevant antibody, as indicated above the figures, and subjected to Western blot analysis with a B-MYB (A) or a PARP polyclonal antibody (B).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Since PARP is binding to the B-MYB DNA-binding domain, it is likely that the interaction may affect B-MYB transactivating function. To address this point, we co-transfected a luciferase reporter plasmid, containing aMYB-binding site, with expression vectors encoding forPARP and B-MYB. Transfection of PARPalone decreased basal transcription, perhaps due to its suppressive activity on RNA polymerase II (37.Oei S.L. Griesenbeck J. Schweiger M. Ziegler M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 31644-31647Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). In sharp contrast, co-expression of PARP and B-MYB resulted in synergistic activation of the MYB-responsive promoter (Fig.4 A). To investigate whether the enzymatic activity of PARP is required in the co-activating function, we took advantage of two enzyme-dead mutants (C908R and M890V) carrying an amino acid substitution at the catalytic domain (38.Rolli V. O'Farrell M. Murcia J.M. Murcia G. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 12147-12154Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Although at different levels, both PARP mutants were able to cooperate with B-MYB suggesting that poly(ADP)-ribosylation activity is not required for the co-activating function of PARP (Fig.4 B). Growing experimental evidence suggests that transcription factors are regulated by physical association with co-activators and co-repressor molecules interacting with multifunctional protein domains. The DNA-binding domain of MYB proteins, the so-called tryptophan repeat structure, has the potential of mediating contact with both DNA and proteins. In this report we show that PARP binds to the B-MYB-DNA-binding domain and enhances its transactivating activity. Interestingly, another member of the MYB family, A-MYB, binds PARP with less efficiency, suggesting that PARP may selectively modulate B-MYB, but not A-MYB, activity (Fig. 1). Although the c-MYB and A-MYB proteins show a 90% amino acid identity in the DNA-binding domain region, homology between A-MYB and B-MYB is only 75%, perhaps explaining the different affinity for PARP displayed by the two proteins (2.Nomura N. Takahashi M. Matsui M. Ishii S. Date T. Sasamoto S. Ishizaki R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1988; 16: 11075-11089Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). Several reports have suggested that PARP can behave as an inhibitor or stimulator of transcription (reviewed in Ref. 39.Damours D. Desnoyers S. D'Silva I. Poirier G. Biochem. J. 1999; 342: 249-268Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It has been shown that poly(ADP)-ribosylation is required for both inhibition and stimulation of activated transcription and that PARP enzymatic activity is greatly enhanced by DNA strand breaks (30.Kumari S.R. Mendoza-Alvarez H. Alvarez-Gonzalez R. Cancer Res. 1998; 58: 5075-5078PubMed Google Scholar, 31.Miyamoto T. Kakizawa T. Hashizume K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 2644-2649Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar, 39.Damours D. Desnoyers S. D'Silva I. Poirier G. Biochem. J. 1999; 342: 249-268Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). PARP participates to DNA-damage surveillance through association with the DNA polymerase-α-primase complex, and PARP is required for DNA polymerase activity (40.Dantzer F. Nasheuer H.P. Vonesch J.L. de Murcia G. Menissier-de Murcia J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 1891-1898Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). In the present study we provide evidence that PARP co-activates B-MYB and that poly(ADP)-ribosylating activity is not required for this function, since PARP proteins devoid of enzymatic activity retain the ability of cooperating with B-MYB (Fig.4 B). Collectively, existing data suggest a model in which, in the presence of DNA damage, PARP is activated and brought to DNA, favoring repair and gene silencing (41.Althaus F.R. Kleczkowska H.E. Malanga M. Muntener C.R. Pleschke J.M. Ebner M. Auer B. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 1999; 193: 5-11Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 42.Dantzer F. Schreiber V. Niedergang C. Trucco C. Flatter E. De La Rubia G. Oliver J. Rolli V. Menissier-de Murcia J. de Murcia G. Biochimie (Paris). 1999; 81: 69-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar). On the other hand, during the normal cell cycle, PARP may be recruited by transactivator proteins, such as B-MYB, to regulate positively gene transcription. Since PARP enzymatic activity does not plays a role, it is likely that the physical interaction occurring between PARP and the B-MYB DNA-binding domain is essential for the synergistic effect. Truncation of the carboxyl terminus of B-MYB activates B-MYB transactivating activity, suggesting that B-MYB is a constitutively repressed molecule (1.Sala A. Watson R. J. Cell. Physiol. 1999; 179: 245-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). B-MYB transactivating function also can be enhanced by cyclin A/CDK2 kinase- induced phosphorylation (1.Sala A. Watson R. J. Cell. Physiol. 1999; 179: 245-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Repressor molecules bound to different B-MYB-domains (or negative intramolecular interactions) may be neutralized by phosphorylation of B-MYB protein and/or by interaction with cofactor molecules such as PARP, resulting in a conformational change and increased transactivating capacity. Also, cofactor molecules may favor the cross-talk between B-MYB and the basal transcription machinery. In preliminary experiments we have been able to show that the PARP/B-MYB interaction is increased in the presence of an oligonucleotide containing an MYB-binding site (data not shown). This suggests that a multiprotein complex containing PARP and B-MYB may cooperatively bind to the MYB-binding site at target promoters resulting in synergistic gene activation. The mechanistic interactions occurring between B-MYB and PARP are worthy of further investigations to define the exact role of PARP in activated transcription regulation. Studies have suggested that abnormal expression of the B-MYBgene may be implicated in the progression of human neoplasias, perhaps through its ability to stimulate transcription of genes related to cell cycle progression and/or apoptosis resistance (1.Sala A. Watson R. J. Cell. Physiol. 1999; 179: 245-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 19.Hibi K. Liu Q. Beaudry G.A. Madden S.L. Westra W.H. Wehage S.L. Yang S.C. Heitmiller R.F. Bertelsen A.H.

https://openalex.org/W2051940183,"Plasmodium falciparum,the causative agent of the most lethal form of human malaria, is incapable of de novo purine synthesis, and thus, purine acquisition from the host is an indispensable nutritional requirement. This purine salvage process is initiated by the transport of preformed purines into the parasite. We have identified a gene encoding a nucleoside transporter from P. falciparum,PfNT1, and analyzed its function and expression during intraerythrocytic parasite development. PfNT1 predicts a polypeptide of 422 amino acids with 11 transmembrane domains that is homologous to other members of the equilibrative nucleoside transporter family. Southern analysis and BLAST searching of TheInstitute for Genomic Research (TIGR) malaria data base indicate that PfNT1 is a single copy gene located on chromosome 14. Northern analysis of RNA from intraerythrocytic stages of the parasite demonstrates thatPfNT1 is expressed throughout the asexual life cycle but is significantly elevated during the early trophozoite stage. Functional expression of PfNT1 in Xenopus laevis oocytes significantly increases their ability to take up naturally occurringd-adenosine (K m = 13.2 μm) and d-inosine (K m = 253 μm). Significantly, PfNT1, unlike the mammalian nucleoside transporters, also has the capacity to transport the stereoisomer l-adenosine (K m > 500 μm). Inhibition studies with a battery of purine and pyrimidine nucleosides and bases as well as their analogs indicate that PfNT1 exhibits a broad substrate specificity for purine and pyrimidine nucleosides. These data provide compelling evidence thatPfNT1 encodes a functional purine/pyrimidine nucleoside transporter whose expression is strongly developmentally regulated in the asexual stages of the P. falciparum life cycle. Moreover, the unusual ability to transport l-adenosine and the vital contribution of purine transport to parasite survival makes PfNT1 an attractive target for therapeutic evaluation. Plasmodium falciparum,the causative agent of the most lethal form of human malaria, is incapable of de novo purine synthesis, and thus, purine acquisition from the host is an indispensable nutritional requirement. This purine salvage process is initiated by the transport of preformed purines into the parasite. We have identified a gene encoding a nucleoside transporter from P. falciparum,PfNT1, and analyzed its function and expression during intraerythrocytic parasite development. PfNT1 predicts a polypeptide of 422 amino acids with 11 transmembrane domains that is homologous to other members of the equilibrative nucleoside transporter family. Southern analysis and BLAST searching of TheInstitute for Genomic Research (TIGR) malaria data base indicate that PfNT1 is a single copy gene located on chromosome 14. Northern analysis of RNA from intraerythrocytic stages of the parasite demonstrates thatPfNT1 is expressed throughout the asexual life cycle but is significantly elevated during the early trophozoite stage. Functional expression of PfNT1 in Xenopus laevis oocytes significantly increases their ability to take up naturally occurringd-adenosine (K m = 13.2 μm) and d-inosine (K m = 253 μm). Significantly, PfNT1, unlike the mammalian nucleoside transporters, also has the capacity to transport the stereoisomer l-adenosine (K m > 500 μm). Inhibition studies with a battery of purine and pyrimidine nucleosides and bases as well as their analogs indicate that PfNT1 exhibits a broad substrate specificity for purine and pyrimidine nucleosides. These data provide compelling evidence thatPfNT1 encodes a functional purine/pyrimidine nucleoside transporter whose expression is strongly developmentally regulated in the asexual stages of the P. falciparum life cycle. Moreover, the unusual ability to transport l-adenosine and the vital contribution of purine transport to parasite survival makes PfNT1 an attractive target for therapeutic evaluation. tubovesicular membranes P. falciparum nucleoside transporter gene P. falciparum nucleoside transporter The Institute for Genomic Research polymerase chain reaction open reading frame 4-nitrobenzyl-6-thioinosine transmembrane group of overlapping clones Nearly half the world's population lives in tropical and subtropical areas where malarial parasites are endemic, and 300–500 million people worldwide are afflicted with the disease annually (1.World Health Organization Wkly. Epidemiol. Rec. 1997; 72: 269PubMed Google Scholar).Plasmodium falciparum, the etiologic agent of the most severe form of malaria in humans, is responsible for 1.5–2.7 million deaths per year, >1 million of which occur in children <5 years of age (1.World Health Organization Wkly. Epidemiol. Rec. 1997; 72: 269PubMed Google Scholar). P. falciparum is an obligate intracellular protozoan parasite that undergoes a number of developmental stages in the human host and multiplies asexually in the red blood cell to effect its clinical symptoms and lethal outcome. Chemotherapy for malaria is available but is complicated both by drug toxicity and widespread drug resistance (1.World Health Organization Wkly. Epidemiol. Rec. 1997; 72: 269PubMed Google Scholar). The need for more efficacious and less toxic agents, particularly rational drugs that exploit pathways and targets unique to the parasite, is therefore acute. A dramatic metabolic discrepancy between P. falciparum and the mammalian host involves purine metabolism. Whereas mammals synthesize purine nucleotides de novo, all protozoan parasites investigated to date (2.Berens R.L. Krug E.C. Marr J.J. Marr J.J. Müller M. Purine and Pyrimidine Metabolism. Academic Press, Inc., New York1995: 89-117Google Scholar), including P. falciparum(3.Gero A.M. O'Sullivan W.J. Blood Cells (N. Y.). 1990; 16: 467-484PubMed Google Scholar), lack an intact purine biosynthetic pathway. Hence, parasites are entirely reliant on their host for preformed purines, and consequently, each parasite genus expresses a unique complement of purine transporters and salvage enzymes that enable purine acquisition from its host. A number of purine salvage enzymes have been described forPlasmodium spp. (2.Berens R.L. Krug E.C. Marr J.J. Marr J.J. Müller M. Purine and Pyrimidine Metabolism. Academic Press, Inc., New York1995: 89-117Google Scholar, 3.Gero A.M. O'Sullivan W.J. Blood Cells (N. Y.). 1990; 16: 467-484PubMed Google Scholar, 4.Reyes P. Rathod P.K. Sanchez D.J. Mrema J.E.

Ng A.L. Winzor D.J. Emmerson B.T. de Jersey J. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1999; 98: 29-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar) and structurally (6.Shi W. Li C.M. Tyler P.C. Furneaux R.H. Cahill S.M. Girvin M.E. Grubmeyer C. Schramm V.L. Almo S.C. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 9872-9880Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). The intracellular milieu for P. falciparum is unusual in that human erythrocytes lack an intact purine (or pyrimidine) biosynthetic pathway and have limited nucleotide requirements (3.Gero A.M. O'Sullivan W.J. Blood Cells (N. Y.). 1990; 16: 467-484PubMed Google Scholar). During its intraerythrocytic life cycle, P. falciparumdivides rapidly, and the acquisition of purines for nucleic acid synthesis becomes imperative. Accordingly, malaria infection dramatically enhances the ability of erythrocytes to salvage purines (3.Gero A.M. O'Sullivan W.J. Blood Cells (N. Y.). 1990; 16: 467-484PubMed Google Scholar, 7.Gero A.M. Bugledich E.M. Paterson A.R. Jamieson G.P. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1998; 27: 159-170Crossref Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 8.Gati W.P. Lin A.N.

Acta. 1995; 1236: 249-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). To salvage preformed purines, P. falciparum must first import these essential nutrients into the parasitized erythrocyte. This is a complex process that requires purine translocation across a number of membranes, including the parasite plasma membrane, the parasitophorous vacuolar membrane, and possibly the erythrocyte membrane, depending upon whether purines are salvaged from the erythrocyte or from plasma. Although little is known about purine transport in Plasmodium spp., nucleosides appear to enter parasitized erythrocytes by three or more pathways: (i) by a saturable, high affinity adenosine transport system (8.Gati W.P. Lin A.N. Wang T.I. Young J.D. Paterson A.R. Biochem. J. 1990; 272: 277-280Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar, 9.Upston J.M. Gero A.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1236: 249-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar); (ii) by a nonsaturable, anion selective-type channel that also transportsl-nucleosides as well as polyols, neutral amino acids, sugars, and cations (10.Kirk K. Horner H.A. Elford B.C. Ellory J.C. Newbold C.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 3339-3347Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar); and (iii) through the tubovesicular membranes (TVM),1 an interconnected network extending from the parasitophorous vacuolar membrane to the periphery of the infected erythrocyte (11.Lauer S.A. Rathod P.K. Ghori N. Haldar K. Science. 1997; 276: 1122-1125Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). Differentiation among these sundry proposed pathways for nucleoside entry into P. falciparum is hampered by the lack of molecular clones encoding key components of the permeation pathway. Recently, Penny et al. (12.Penny J.I. Hall S.T. Woodrow C.J. Cowan G.M. Gero A.M. Krishna S. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1998; 93: 81-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar) demonstrated that nucleoside and nucleobase uptake capabilities can be conferred upon Xenopus laevis oocytes after microinjection of poly(A)+ RNA isolated from P. falciparum asexual stages. We now report the isolation and functional characterization of the first molecular component of the nucleoside permeation pathway of P. falciparum. This gene, PfNT1, was identified by searching The Institute for GenomicResearch (TIGR) malaria data base with the sequence of human and other parasite nucleoside transporters (13.Griffiths M. Beaumont N. Yao S.Y. Sundaram M. Boumah C.E. Davies A. Kwong F.Y. Coe I. Cass C.E. Young J.D. Baldwin S.A. Nat. Med. 1997; 3: 89-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (357) Google Scholar, 14.Vasudevan G.

Quantitation of poly(A)+ RNA from various intraerythrocytic stages revealed that PfNT1 expression is developmentally regulated throughout the intraerythrocytic life cycle, and functional studies inXenopus oocytes confirmed that PfNT1 is a high affinity, saturable nucleoside transporter exhibiting a broad substrate specificity for purine and pyrimidine nucleosides and theirl-stereoisomers. These findings reveal that PfNT1 is a unique member of the equilibrative nucleoside transporter family and imply that this permease may be a novel therapeutic target for malaria. Radiolabeled nucleosides,d-[5-3H]ribose and nonradiolabeledl-adenosine were purchased from Moravek Biochemicals (Brea, CA). d-[6-3H]glucose was purchased from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. Restriction endonucleases were obtained from New England Biolabs, Inc. (Beverly, MA), Roche Molecular Biochemicals, or Life Technologies, Inc. Oligonucleotides were custom-synthesized by Sigma-Genosys Biotechnologies, Inc. (The Woodslands, TX). All other chemicals, materials, and reagents used in these studies were of the highest grade commerically available and bought from either Aldrich or Sigma. P. falciparum clones, 3D7 and W2 were maintained as described (16.Trager W. Jensen J.B. Science. 1976; 193: 673-675Crossref PubMed Scopus (6185) Google Scholar), except that the serum component in the culture medium was replaced with AlbuMAX. 3D7 and W2 are chloroquine-sensitive and chloroquine-resistant field isolates, respectively (17.Mamoun C.B.

PfNT1 was identified by BLAST searching of TIGR malaria data base with nucleoside transporter sequences for the human equilibrative nucleoside transporter, hENT1 (13.Griffiths M. Beaumont N. Yao S.Y.

Lipman D.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 215: 403-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (70747) Google Scholar). Significant homology was found with a sequence on chromosome 14, and preliminary sequence data for P. falciparum chromosome 14 were obtained from the TIGR website. Sequencing of chromosome 14 was part of the International Malaria Genome Sequencing Project and was supported by awards from the Burroughs Wellcome Fund and the U.S. Department of Defense. The polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was employed to isolatePfNT1 genomic clones from P. falciparum DNA prepared from the W2 isolate, and a PfNT1 cDNA was isolated from a cDNA library (ITG2F6 isolate) prepared in the cloning vector λZAP II (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA), which was constructed and generously provided by Dr. Richard G. Nelson of the University of California, San Francisco. The genomic DNA was extracted from parasites as described (17.Mamoun C.B. Gluzman I.Y. Goyard S. Beverley S.M. Goldberg D.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 8716-8720Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). The PfNT1 open reading frame (ORF) was amplified from genomic DNA and the cDNA library with Taq DNA polymerase (Promega, Madison, WI). The sense primer, 5′-TCTGGATCC ATGAGTACCGGTAAAGAGTCATCTAAAGC-3′ (PfNT5′S1), contained a BamHI site (underlined) preceding the Met initiation codon (boldface), and the antisense primer, 5′-TTCTCTAGATTTCTCTTCAATTTTTATTTATTTATT-3′ (PfNT3′AS-27), was preceded by an XbaI site (underlined) upstream from the termination codon (boldface). After 25 cycles of denaturation at 94 °C for 30 s, annealing at 58 °C for 50 s, and extension at 72 °C for 2 min, the PCR products were ligated into the PCR®2.1-TOPO® vector (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA.). The PfNT1 sequences were determined in both directions by automated DNA sequencing performed by the Core Facility located within the Department of Molecular Microbiology and Immunology at the Oregon Health Sciences University. Pairwise amino acid sequence alignments with other nucleoside transporter proteins were performed using the algorithm of Needleman and Wunsch (19.Needleman S.B. Wunsch C.D. J. Mol. Biol. 1970; 48: 443-453Crossref PubMed Scopus (7807) Google Scholar), and multisequence alignments were performed using the Feng-Doolittle algorithm (20.Feng D.F. Doolittle R.F. J. Mol. Evol. 1987; 25: 351-360Crossref PubMed Scopus (1535) Google Scholar). Membrane topologies were predicted on the basis of hydrophobicity by standard methods (21.Kyte J. Doolittle R.F. J. Mol.

Chem. 1986; 15: 321-353Crossref PubMed Scopus (1199) Google Scholar). Genomic DNA was isolated from the 3D7 isolate as reported (17.Mamoun C.B. Gluzman I.Y. Goyard S. Beverley S.M. Goldberg D.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 8716-8720Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Restriction enzyme-digested P. falciparum DNA was blotted onto Nytran filters (NEN Life Science Products) and hybridized to a fragment of PfNT1. The probe was amplified from genomic DNA or cRNA prepared from clone 3D7 using standard PCR conditions (23.Maniatis T. Fritsch E.F. Sambrook J. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1982: 7.19-7.22Google Scholar), Klentaq polymerase (Sigma), and oligonucleotide primers 5′-GAGTACCGGTAAAGAGTCATC-3′ (PfNT-5) and 5′-ATGGTGGGTAGCTACATTGTG-3′ (PfNT-3). The P. falciparum 3D7 clone was synchronized twice with sorbitol, and 10 plates were collected from ring, early trophozoite, late trophozoite, early schizont, and late schizont stages during the 48-h growth cycle of the parasite. At each time point, cells were harvested at 10% parasitemia, 2% hematocrit. Cell pellets were lysed for 5 min in 5 volumes of 0.2% saponin prepared in phosphate-buffered saline, and the parasite pellet was then stored at −80 °C until use. Total cellular RNA was prepared by the guanidine thiocyanate method (24.Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (63190) Google Scholar). RNA was subjected to denaturing agarose electrophoresis, transferred to a nylon membrane (Hybond-N+; Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), and probed with oligonucleotide primers PfNT-5 and PfNT-3 used in the Southern blot analysis. Signals were normalized by hybridization to probes corresponding to P. falciparum 5 S rRNA: 5′-CACGGACCAAGGAGTCTAGC-3′ (5S5′) and 5′-TCGCTTTGGTGTCGGTTCCC-3′ (5S3′). P. falciparum clone 3D7 was synchronized twice using sorbitol. The radiolabelsd-[2,8-3H]adenosine andl-[2,8-3H]adenosine (50 μCi/ml) were added to the different stages of the parasite culture at 15% parasitemia in 200-μl volumes. Cell pellets were washed twice with 12 ml of cold phosphate-buffered saline and resuspended in 1.0 ml of 5% cold trichloroacetic acid. After precipitation on ice for 30 min and centrifugation at 12,000 × g for 60 min, the trichloroacetic acid precipitate was dissolved at 37 °C for 1 h in 500 μl of 0.1 n NaOH. A 250-μl volume was added to 3 ml of scintillation fluid suitably acidified to neutralize the NaOH. Counts were measured by liquid scintillation spectrometry. Stage V-VI oocytes were harvested fromX. laevis and defolliculated with collagenase (Sigma) as described (15.Chiang C.W. Carter N. Sullivan Jr., W.J. Donald R.G.K. Roos D.S.

Denuded oocytes were incubated at 16 °C in Krebs-Ringer saline buffer (96 mm NaCl, 2 mmKCl, 1.8 mm CaCl2, 1 mmMgCl2, 5 mm HEPES, pH 7.5) supplemented with 2.5 mm sodium pyruvate, 0.5 mm theophylline, 50 μg/ml gentamycin, and 1.5% horse serum (Life Technologies). The W2PfNT1 coding sequence was subcloned into theBamHI/EcoRI sites of the pOG-1 oocyte expression vector that encompasses the 5′- and 3′-untranslated regions of theX. laevis β-globin gene (26.Krieg P.A. Melton D.A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1984; 12: 7057-7070Crossref PubMed Scopus (1082) Google Scholar). The PfNT1-OG-1 plasmid was linearized with NotI, and capped cRNA was synthesized by the mMessage mMachineTM T7 (Ambion, Inc., Austin, TX). Oocytes were microinjected with 5–20 ng of cRNA 1 day after defolliculation. Uptake into oocytes of d-[2,8-3H]adenosine (37.5 Ci/mmol),l-[2,8-3H]adenosine (44 Ci/mmol),d-[2,8-3H]inosine (31.3 Ci/mmol),d-[methyl-3H]thymidine (24.1 Ci/mmol), l-[methyl-3H]thymidine (5.1 Ci/mmol), d-[5-3H]ribose (20 Ci/mmol),d-[6-3H]glucose (31 Ci/mmol), or [8-14C]hypoxanthine (56 mCi/mmol) was determined 3 days post-injection at ambient temperature in unsupplemented Krebs-Ringer saline, pH 7.5. K m value determinations were performed at various concentrations ofd-[2,8-3H]adenosine (0.38 Ci/mmol),d-[2,8-3H]inosine (0.31 Ci/mmol), andl-[2,8-3H]adenosine (0.088 Ci/mmol). Inhibition profiles were performed at 5 μmd-[2,8-3H]adenosine (3.8 Ci/mmol) with 500 μm competitor, except for dipyridamole (10 μm), 4-nitrobenzyl-6-thioinosine (NBMPR) (10 and 50 μm), and furosemide (10, 100, and 500 μm). Uptake experiments were terminated by the removal of oocytes from radiolabeled buffer and washing each oocyte three times in ice-cold Krebs-Ringer saline. Each oocyte was solubilized in 200 μl of 5% SDS, and incorporation of radiolabel was quantified by liquid scintillation spectrometry. The PfNT1 ORF was identified on contig PNG2538 of chromosome 14 after TBLASTN searching of TIGR malaria data base with peptide sequences from human and parasite nucleoside transporters as query sequences (13.Griffiths M. Beaumont N. Yao S.Y. Sundaram M. Boumah C.E. Davies A. Kwong F.Y. Coe I. Cass C.E. Young J.D. Baldwin S.A. Nat. Med. 1997; 3: 89-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (357) Google Scholar, 14.Vasudevan G.

PfNT1 from the W2 isolate differed from the 3D7 sequence in the malaria data base by a single C > G transversion at position 1154 of thePfNT1 ORF. Thus, amino acid 385 is a Phe in the W2 strain and a Leu in the 3D7 line. This Phe-385 → Leu substitution was confirmed by sequencing three independent full-length PfNT1PCR fragments from the W2 strain. The length of the PfNT1ORF from the ITG2F6 cDNA clone was identical to the genomicPfNT1 clones from 3D7 and W2. There were two sequence differences observed between the 3D7 and ITG2F6 PfNT1 ORFs, a T > C transition at position 107 and a G > A transition at position 385. These alterations translate into Phe-36 [arrow] Ser and Val-132 [arrow] Ile in the PfNT1 clone from the ITG2F6 isolate. The ITG2F6 clone was not characterized further. PfNT1 encodes a polypeptide of 422 amino acids that exhibits significant homology with other members of the equilibrative nucleoside transporter family, including human hENT1 (13.Griffiths M.

This result is consistent with the BLAST search data, which, thus far, reveal the presence of only one PfNT1 gene within the malarial genome. Low stringency Southern blots, however, did reveal other weakly hybridizing bands within P. falciparum genomic DNA (data not shown). Northern blot analysis with total RNA isolated from different asexual stages of the P. falciparum life cycle suggested thatPfNT1 is expressed as a 1.7-kb transcript in all intraerythrocytic stages but is significantly elevated in the early trophozoite stage of the parasite (Fig.4 A). This stage-specific expression was confirmed by reprobing the same blot with the P. falciparum elongation factor 1α and 1β cDNAs (PfEF-1α and PfEF-1β) that also exhibit elevated expression in the early trophozoite stage (33.Vinkenoog R.

To verify that each lane contained equivalent amounts of RNA, the Northern blot was normalized to the constitutively expressed P. falciparumrRNA (Fig. 4 A). The elevation of the PfNT1transcript in the early trophozoite stage correlated with a marked increase in the incorporation ofd-[2,8-3H]adenosine into the nucleic acids ofP. falciparum-parasitized erythrocytes harboring predominantly ring and early trophozoite parasites (Fig.4 B).

Chem.271, 30479–30486, 1996). Hepatic glucokinase is inhibited by a 68-kDa glucokinase regulatory protein (GKRP) that is expressed in molar excess. To establish the relative control exerted by glucokinase and GKRP, we applied metabolic control analysis to determine the flux control coefficient of GKRP on glucose metabolism in hepatocytes. Adenovirus-mediated overexpression of GKRP (by up to 2-fold above endogenous levels) increased glucokinase binding and inhibited glucose phosphorylation, glycolysis, and glycogen synthesis over a wide range of concentrations of glucose and sorbitol. It decreased the affinity of glucokinase translocation for glucose and increased the control coefficient of glucokinase on glycogen synthesis. GKRP had a negative control coefficient of glycogen synthesis that is slightly greater than unity (−1.2) and a control coefficient on glycolysis of −0.5. The control coefficient of GKRP on glycogen synthesis decreased with increasing glucokinase overexpression (4-fold) at elevated glucose concentration (35 mm), which favors dissociation of glucokinase from GKRP, but not at 7.5 mm glucose. Under the latter conditions, glucokinase and GKRP have large and inverse control coefficients on glycogen synthesis, suggesting that a large component of the positive control coefficient of glucokinase is counterbalanced by the negative coefficient of GKRP. It is concluded that glucokinase and GKRP exert reciprocal control; therefore, mutations in GKRP affecting the expression or function of the protein may impact the phenotype even in the heterozygote state, similar to glucokinase mutations in maturity onset diabetes of the young type 2. Our results show that the mechanism comprising glucokinase and GKRP confers a markedly extended responsiveness and sensitivity to changes in glucose concentration on the hepatocyte.

Landes Publishers, Austin, TX1995: 21-40Google Scholar). Its importance has been confirmed by the finding that mutations in its gene cause a form of diabetes known as maturity onset diabetes of the young type 2 (MODY-2),1 which is characterized by mild hyperglycemia, decreased glucose-induced insulin secretion, impaired hepatic glycogen storage, and dominant inheritance (3.Hattersley A.T. Diabetic Med. 1998; 15: 15-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar), and by studies on hepatic glucokinase knockout mice (4.Postic C. Shiota M. Niswender K.D. Jetton T.L. Chen Y. Moates J.M.

Hepatic glucokinase is Regulated by a 68-kDa regulatory protein (GKRP) (5.Van Schaftingen E. Detheux M. Veiga-da-Cunha M.

J. 1993; 294: 551-556Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar), and no physiological situations are known in which hepatic glucokinase is expressed in the absence of its regulatory protein. GKRP is located mainly in the nucleus of hepatocytes, whereas glucokinase translocates between the nucleus and the cytoplasm (8.Brown K.S. Kalinowski S.S. Megill J.R. Durham S.K. Mookhtiar K.A. Diabetes. 1997; 46: 179-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Glucokinase binds GKRP in the nucleus at low glucose concentrations and translocates to the cytoplasm at elevated glucose or fructose concentrations (8.Brown K.S. Kalinowski S.S. Megill J.R. Durham S.K. Mookhtiar K.A. Diabetes. 1997; 46: 179-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar, 9.Agius L. Peak M. Biochem.

This translocation can be reconstituted in nonhepatic cells by co-expressing glucokinase and GKRP (11.De la Iglesia N. Veiga-da-Cunha M. Van Schaftingen E. Guinovart J.J. Ferrer J.C. FEBS Lett. 1999; 456: 332-338Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). It is not yet known whether mutations in human GKRP contribute to some forms of diabetes (12.Hayward B.E. Warner J.P. Dunlop N. Fantes J. Intody S. Leek J. Markham A.F. Bonthron D.T. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 1996; 25: 140-145Crossref Scopus (6) Google Scholar). Loss of function mutations have been described for most enzymes involved in glucose metabolism. In virtually all cases, with the exception of glucokinase, effects on the phenotype are observed only in the homozygous mutant (recessive inheritance) (13.Kacser H. Burns J.A. Genetics. 1981; 97: 639-666Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Glucokinase thus represents a very rare, if not unique, case of dominant inheritance among metabolic enzymes. Kacser and Burns (13.Kacser H. Burns J.A. Genetics. 1981; 97: 639-666Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) provided a mechanistic explanation for dominance and recessivity of loss of function mutations of metabolic enzymes based on the flux control coefficient of the wild type enzyme, which represents the fractional change in pathway flux that results from a fractional change in enzyme concentration (14.Kacser H. Burns J.A. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 1979; 7: 1149-1160Crossref PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar, 15.Fell D.A. Biochem. J. 1992; 286: 313-330Crossref PubMed Scopus (632) Google Scholar). Enzymes with flux control coefficients much smaller than unity are predicted to show recessive inheritance because a 50% decrease in activity is expected to have a negligible effect on metabolic flux and hence on the phenotype. The widespread occurrence of recessivity and low control coefficients is consistent with this hypothesis. Likewise, the very high control coefficient of glucokinase on hepatic glycogen synthesis (16.Agius L. Peak M. Newgard C.B. Gomez-Foix A.M. Guinovart J.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 30479-30486Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar) is consistent with the dominant inheritance of glucokinase mutations in MODY-2 and the impaired hepatic glycogen synthesis in this condition (17.Velho G. Petersen K.F. Perseghin G. Huang J-H. Rothman D.L. Pueyo M.E. Cline G.W. Froguel P. Shulman G.I. J. Clin. Investig. 1996; 98: 1755-1761Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). The control coefficient of an enzyme or protein is thus indicative of whether loss of function mutations of the protein are likely to affect the phenotype in the heterozygous state (13.Kacser H. Burns J.A. Genetics. 1981; 97: 639-666Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, the aims of this study were to determine the control coefficient of GKRP on hepatic glycogen metabolism and to determine the effects of changes in the ratio of expression of GKRP and glucokinase on the control coefficients of the two proteins and thereby evaluate the contribution of GKRP to the glucose sensory mechanism of the hepatocyte. Our results show that the mechanism comprising glucokinase and GKRP confers a markedly enhanced responsiveness and sensitivity to glucose on the hepatocyte. DEAE-Sepharose, CH-Sepharose 4B, 1-ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)carbodiimide, sorbitol 6-phosphate, glucose 6-phosphate dehydrogenase fromLeuconostoc mestenteroides, and all other enzymes were from Sigma.

Viral titers were determined that resulted in protein overexpression of between 30% and 2-fold above endogenous levels for GKRP and between 30% and 4-fold above endogenous levels for glucokinase at 18 h after treatment. Hepatocytes were isolated by collagenase perfusion of the liver of male Wistar rats (body weight, 180–250 g) fed ad libitum (21.Agius L. Peak M. Alberti K.G.M.M. Biochem.

They were suspended in minimal essential medium (MEM) containing 7% (v/v) neonatal calf serum and seeded at a density of 4 × 104cells/cm2 in 24-well plates for metabolic studies and glucokinase determination, in 6-well plates for GKRP determination, or on gelatin-coated coverslips for immunostaining. After cell attachment (2–3 h), the medium was replaced by serum-free MEM containing the adenoviruses or control medium. After an additional 2 h, the medium was replaced by serum-free MEM containing 10 nmdexamethasone, and the cells were cultured for 16–18 h before use for metabolic studies. Unless stated otherwise, the MEM contained 5 mm glucose. Cells cultured on 13-mm coverslips were washed in PBS, fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS (30 min), and washed in PBS (11.De la Iglesia N.

They were then washed in PBS, water, and ethanol and mounted onto microscope slides with Mowiol containing 2.5% diazabicyclo[2,2,2]octane (Aldrich). Images of stained cells were obtained using a Bio-Rad-600 Laser Scanning Confocal Microscope equipped with a 15 mW krypton-argon laser. The 568 nm line was used to excite the Texas Red fluorophore. For each field, a series of 1-μm optical sections were combined to produce a single image. For metabolic studies (Figs. 4 and 5) and control coefficient determinations (Figs. Figure 6, Figure 7, Figure 8), parallel incubations were performed for determination of glucose metabolism and the activities of glucokinase and GKRP. Incubations for determination of glucose phosphorylation ([2-3H]glucose), glycolysis ([3-3H]glucose), or glycogen synthesis ([U-14C]glucose) were for 3 h in MEM containing the substrates indicated and radiolabelled glucose (2 μCi/ml) and 2 μm cycloheximide to inhibit further protein overexpression (16.Agius L.

On termination of the incubations, the medium from experiments with [3H]glucose was collected into 0.1m HCl for determination of 3H2O (23.Agius L. Biochem.

On termination of the incubations, the hepatocyte monolayers were incubated in permeabilization medium that contained 300 mm sucrose, 3 mm Hepes, 5 mm MgCl2, 2 mm DTT, and 0.04 mg/ml digitonin, pH 7.2. After 8 min, this medium was collected for determination of the free glucokinase activity. The residual (bound fraction) was extracted in 150 mm KCl, 3 mmHepes, 2 mm DTT, and 0.04 mg/ml digitonin, pH 7.2. Glucokinase was assayed by the glucose 6-phosphate dehydrogenase coupled assay (16.Agius L. Peak M. Newgard C.B. Gomez-Foix A.M. Guinovart J.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 30479-30486Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar), and the free glucokinase activity was expressed either as milliunits/milligram of protein or as a percentage of total (free + bound) activity. The assay based on the inhibition of purified glucokinase was a modification of an assay described previously (7.Vandercammen A. Van Schaftingen E. Biochem. J. 1993; 294: 551-556Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Hepatocyte monolayers in 6-well plates were washed twice with 150 mm NaCl and extracted (1 ml/well) by brief sonication in medium containing 25 mm KCl, 25 mm Hepes, 25 mm glucose, 2 mm DTT, 0.2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 0.04 mg/ml digitonin. The extracts were sedimented (13,000 × g, 15 min), and the supernatants were fractionated on DEAE-Sepharose mini-columns (2.5 cm) by elution with stepwise KCl concentrations (0, 50, 75, 100, 200, and 500 mm) as described in Ref. 7.Vandercammen A. Van Schaftingen E. Biochem. J. 1993; 294: 551-556Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar. This fractionation separates GKRP from glucokinase and thus enables the assay of GKRP in the absence of interference from endogenous glucokinase (7.Vandercammen A. Van Schaftingen E. Biochem. J. 1993; 294: 551-556Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). The assay mixture for determination of GKRP contained 25 mm KCl, 1 mm ATP-Mg2+, 5 mm glucose, 0.5 mm NAD, 1 mmMgCl2, 1 mm DTT, 0.05% bovine serum albumin, 25 mm Hepes, pH 7.1, 1.2 units/ml glucose 6-phosphate dehydrogenase (Leuconostoc mesenteroides), and 6 milliunits/ml purified rat liver glucokinase. The assay was performed in the absence or presence of 100 μm sorbitol 6-phosphate. The activity of GKRP (in Units) was determined from the inhibition of glucokinase activity in the presence of sorbitol 6-phosphate, where 1 Unit represents the activity that causes 50% inhibition of glucokinase activity in an assay volume of 1.0 ml under the above-mentioned assay conditions. GKRP was also determined by Western blotting as described previously (10.Agius L. Peak M. Van Schaftingen E. Biochem. J. 1995; 309: 711-713Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). The glucokinase used for assay of GKRP was prepared by overexpression of rat liver glucokinase in hepatocytes using AdCMV-GKL followed by purification by glucosamine affinity chromatography and DEAE-Sephadex. Hepatocyte monolayers in 6-well plates were treated for 2 h with high titers (>30 plaque-forming units/cell) of AdCMV-GKL. They were then cultured in fresh MEM containing 10 nm dexamethasone and 100 nm insulin for 3 days. This results in glucokinase expression >100-fold above endogenous activity. Glucokinase was extracted by permeabilizing the hepatocytes with digitonin (0.05 mg/ml) in 80 mm KCl, 20 mm potassium phosphate, 1 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EDTA, 5% glycerol, 2 mm DTT, and 100 mm sucrose, pH 7.0. The digitonin extract was pre-cleared (15,000 × g), and glucokinase was purified by affinity chromatography usingN-hexylglucosamine-Sepharose prepared by couplingd-glucosamine to CH-Sepharose 4B in the presence of 1-ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)carbodiimide as described previously (25.Miwa I. Mitsuyama S. Toyoda Y. Murata T. Okuda J. Prep. Biochem. 1990; 20: 163-178PubMed Google Scholar) and diluted with unsubstituted Sepharose 4B (26.Holroyde M.J. Chesher J.M.E. Trayer I.P. Walker D.G. Biochem. J. 1976; 153: 351-361Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). After elution with 1 m glucose, the glucokinase was purified and concentrated by DEAE-Sepharose chromatography. The preparation had a specific activity of 150–200 units/mg protein (using bovine serum albumin as standard). The control coefficients ( CEJ) of GKRP or glucokinase were determined for glycogen synthesis or glycolysis. The control coefficient is defined as the fractional change (+, increase; −, decrease) in metabolic flux (J) that results from a fractional change in enzyme activity (e):CEJ=δJ/Jδe/eEquation 1 where J is the flux through the pathway, ande is the total activity of GKRP or glucokinase (14.Kacser H.

Control coefficients were determined from the slope of log J(glycolysis or glycogen synthesis) against log e (total activity of GKRP or glucokinase) as described previously (16.Agius L. Peak M.

For determination of the control coefficient of GKRP, hepatocytes were treated with either 3 or 5 titers of AdCMV-GKRP, and for determination of the control coefficients of glucokinase, 4 titers of AdCMV-GK were used. In experiments in which the control coefficients of both glucokinase and GKRP were determined, hepatocytes were treated with 3 titers of AdCMV-GKRP, in each case without or with four titers AdCMV-GK. Results are expressed as the means ± S.E. for the number of cell preparations indicated. Statistical analysis was performed by using the paired t test. The activity of GKRP in hepatocyte extracts was determined from the inhibition of purified glucokinase in the presence of sorbitol 6-phosphate, which enhances binding of GKRP to glucokinase (7.Vandercammen A.

J. 1993; 294: 551-556Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar) after fractionation of the hepatocyte extracts on DEAE-Sepharose as described previously (7.Vandercammen A. Van Schaftingen E. Biochem. J. 1993; 294: 551-556Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). GKRP eluted at 75–100 mm KCl in fractions 7–10 (Fig. 1 A), and glucokinase activity eluted in fractions 12 and 13 (data not shown). Treatment of hepatocytes with AdCMV-GKRP resulted in an increase in GKRP activity of between 37% and 2-fold above endogenous activity (Fig. 1 B), an increase in immunostaining in the nucleus (Fig. 2), and a more intense band by Western blot analysis (data not shown). The endogenous GKRP content of untreated hepatocytes in this study was 0.68 ± 0.15 Units/mg cell protein, and the glucokinase activity was 19.8 ± 3.7 milliunits/mg. Assuming an activity of 0.2 Units/pmol for GKRP (27.Rosa J.L. Perez J.X. Detheux M. Van Schaftingen E. Bartrons R. Hepatology. 1997; 25: 324-328Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and 10 milliunits/pmol for glucokinase, this corresponds to a GKRP/glucokinase molar ratio of 1.8 ± 0.18 (means ± S.E.,n = 7) in untreated hepatocytes.Figure 2Confocal images of untreated hepatocytes (a) and hepatocytes treated with AdCMV-GKRP (b) immunostained for GKRP. Scale bar, 50 μm.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) In the experiments shown in Fig.3, glucokinase and GKRP were overexpressed simultaneously by treatment of hepatocytes with either varying titers of AdCMV-GK alone (open symbols) or in the additional presence of 3 titers (50, 100, and 200 μl/ml) of AdCMV-GKRP. Overexpression of GKRP by up to 2-fold above endogenous activity decreased free (Fig. 3 A) and increased bound (Fig.3 B) glucokinase, confirming that the overexpressed protein binds glucokinase in the intact hepatocyte. Binding of glucokinase to GKRP in intact hepatocytes is decreased by elevated glucose concentrations and by precursors of fructose 1-phosphate such as sorbitol (9.Agius L. Peak M. Biochem. J. 1993; 296: 785-796Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar, 10.Agius L. Peak M. Van Schaftingen E. Biochem. J. 1995; 309: 711-713Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 28.Agius L. Biochem. J. 1994; 298: 237-243Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Control hepatocytes and cells treated with AdCMV-GKRP with approximately 2-fold overexpression of GKRP (1.5 ± 0.16versus 0.7 ± 0.1 units/mg) were incubated with varying glucose concentration (Fig. 4). GKRP overexpression caused a decrease in free glucokinase activity, glucose phosphorylation, glycolysis, and glycogen synthesis (Fig. 4,A–D). The concentration of glucose that caused a half-maximal effect on free glucokinase activity was 36 mmin cells treated with AdCMV-GKRP compared with 25 mm for untreated cells (Fig. 4 A). Increased glucokinase binding and inhibition of glucose phosphorylation, glycolysis, and glycogen synthesis by GKRP overexpression were also observed when hepatocytes were incubated with 7.5 mm glucose and varying concentrations of sorbitol (Fig.5, A–D). Plots of rates of glycolysis or glycogen synthesis against the corresponding free glucokinase activity (Fig. 5, E and F) show that the inhibition of glycolysis and glycogen synthesis can be explained by increased binding of glucokinase. The flux control coefficient of an enzyme (or protein) with respect to a particular metabolic pathway is a measure of the fractional response of pathway flux (J) to a fractional change in the concentration of the protein. The control coefficients of GKRP on glycolysis and glycogen synthesis were determined from the slope of double logarithmic plots of rates of metabolic flux against GKRP activity (Fig.6). These plots were linear for glycogen synthesis but not for glycolysis (Fig. 6), indicating that the control coefficient of GKRP on glycolysis decreases with GKRP overexpression over the range of protein overexpression studied. GKRP had a greater negative control coefficient on glycogen synthesis than on glycolysis (Table I). The control coefficient on glycogen synthesis was slightly greater than unity (−1.2). A control coefficient of unity (negative) signifies that a fractional increase in protein concentration is associated with a proportional decrease in flux. The control coefficient on glycolysis was lower in the presence of sorbitol or elevated glucose (Table I).Table IControl coefficients of GKRP on glycolysis and glycogen synthesisSubstrateGlycolysis CGKRP JGLYGlycogen synthesis C GKRO JGS7.5 mmglucose−0.50 ± 0.06−1.2 ± 0.16ap < 0.01, glycogen synthesisversus glycolysis.7.5 mm glucose + 200 μm sorbitol−0.25 ± 0.06bp < 0.03, versus corresponding values at 7.5 mm glucose.35 mm glucose−0.27 ± 0.07bp < 0.03, versus corresponding values at 7.5 mm glucose.−1.1 ± 0.16ap < 0.01, glycogen synthesisversus glycolysis.Hepatocytes treated with different titers of AdCMV-GKRP were incubated for 3 h in medium with the substrates indicated and either [3-3H]glucose or [U-14C]glycogen for determination of glycolysis and glycogen synthesis, respectively.

Control coefficients were determined from the slope (initial slope for glycolysis) of double logarithmic plots of rates of glycolysis or glycogen synthesis against GKRP activity. Results are the means ± S.E. for either three (glycolysis) or seven (glycogen synthesis) experiments. In another series of experiments, hepatocytes were treated with combinations of both AdCMV-GK (4 titers to overexpress glucokinase) and AdCMV-GKRP (3 titers to overexpress GKRP) to determine the control coefficient of GKRP at basal glucokinase and at elevated glucokinase activity. The control coefficient of GKRP on glycogen at 7.5 and 35 mm glucose was determined at each glucokinase level as shown in Fig. 6 B. Although there was no difference between 7.5 and 35 mm glucose in the control coefficient of GKRP on glycogen synthesis in cells with endogenous glucokinase activity (Fig. 7 and Table I), with increasing glucokinase activity, the control coefficient of GKRP on glycogen synthesis decreased at 35 mm glucose but not at 7.5 mm glucose (Fig. 7). In the same series of experiments described in the previous paragraph, the flux control coefficient of glucokinase was determined at endogenous levels of GKRP and at overexpressed levels from double logarithmic plots of glycogen synthesis (at 7.5 and 35 mm glucose) against total glucokinase activity. As shown in Fig. 8, the control coefficient of glucokinase was greater at 7.5 mm than at 35 mmglucose, and overexpression of GKRP increased the control coefficient of glucokinase at both 7.5 and 35 mm glucose. The liver has a major role in the control of blood glucose homeostasis. Glucokinase, the main glucose-phosphorylating enzyme in hepatocytes, and its inhibitor, GKRP, together are key components of the glucose sensory mechanism. The objective of this study was to gain a deeper understanding of the advantages conferred on the cell by this complex mechanism of regulation. To this end, we overexpressed GKRP by up to 2-fold above endogenous activity using recombinant adenovirus. This produced a functional protein that localized in the nucleus and inhibited glucokinase activity both in vitro and in the intact cell in vivo. Twofold overexpression of GKRP did not block the translocation of glucokinase by either elevated glucose concentration or sorbitol. However, it decreased the affinity of glucokinase translocation and glucose phosphorylation for glucose. The initial observation that the affinity of glucose phosphorylation for glucose in hepatocytes is lower than can be explained by the sigmoidal kinetics of glucokinase (S0.5, 20 versus 8 mm) was made by Bontemps et al. (29.Bontemps F. Hue L. Hers H.-G. Biochem. J. 1978; 174: 603-611Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). The discovery of GKRP by Van Schaftingen (30.Van Schaftingen E. Eur. J. Biochem. 1989; 179: 179-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar) provided an explanation for the low affinity of glucose phosphorylation for glucose in intact hepatocytes based on competitive inhibition of glucokinase by GKRP. The present study demonstrates that in cells with 2-fold overexpression of GKRP, the concentration of glucose causing a half-maximal effect on glucokinase translocation was increased by 44% (36 versus25 mm). This clearly establishes that the affinity of the hepatocyte for glucose depends on the ratio of GKRP:glucokinase and decreases with increasing ratio. Overexpression of GKRP also inhibited glycolysis and glycogen synthesis. This inhibition correlated with the free glucokinase activity, confirming that it can be explained by glucokinase binding to GKRP. Metabolic control analysis is a very powerful analytical approach for quantitative description and understanding of how control is distributed among the component enzymes of a metabolic pathway in the intact cell, and accordingly of the magnitude of the control exerted by a particular enzyme (14.Kacser H. Burns J.A. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 1979; 7: 1149-1160Crossref PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar, 15.Fell D.A. Biochem. J. 1992; 286: 313-330Crossref PubMed Scopus (632) Google Scholar, 31.Cornish-Bowden A. Fundamentals of Enzyme Kinetics. Portland Press, London and Miami, FL1995: 249-256Google Scholar). It defines the quantitative relation between metabolic flux and the activities or concentrations of enzymes that are components of the pathway or compete for substrate (32.Heinrich R. Rapaport T.A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1974; 42: 89-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (995) Google Scholar, 33.Kacser H. Burns J.A. Symp. Soc. Exp. Biol. 1973; 27: 65-104PubMed Google Scholar). In the case of glucokinase, the activity is a function of the total glucokinase concentration and the proportion that is bound to GKRP. The latter is determined by the concentration of GKRP and also by the concentrations of glucose (9.Agius L. Peak M. Biochem. J. 1993; 296: 785-796Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar) and fructose 1-phosphate (34.Niculescu L. Veiga-da-Cunha M. Van Schaftingen E. Biochem. J. 1997; 321: 239-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). It has been proven by the summation theorem that the sum of the flux control coefficients of all the component enzymes in relation to a metabolic pathway must equal unity (33.Kacser H. Burns J.A. Symp. Soc. Exp. Biol. 1973; 27: 65-104PubMed Google Scholar). We have shown previously that glucokinase has a very high control coefficient (greater than unity) on glycogen synthesis from glucose (16.Agius L. Peak M. Newgard C.B. Gomez-Foix A.M. Guinovart J.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 30479-30486Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar), and we suggested two possible explanations for this high control coefficient. First, it could be due to a substrate cycle between glucokinase and glucose 6-phosphatase. This would require a comparable and negative control coefficient of glucose 6-phosphatase. This was found not to be the case because glucose 6-phosphatase has a low control coefficient (−0.3) on glycogen synthesis (18.Aiston S. Trinh K.Y. Lange A.J. Newgard C.B. Agius L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 24559-24566Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Second, it could be due to the compartmentation of glucokinase in association with GKRP. In this study, we were able to test the latter hypothesis directly by measuring the control coefficient of GKRP. The results provide direct support for this hypothesis. Four findings emerged from the control analysis experiments: 1) the negative control coefficient of GKRP on glycogen synthesis was greater than unity, 2) GKRP overexpression increases the control coefficient of glucokinase on glycogen synthesis, 3) a moderate increase in glucokinase overexpression was associated with a decrease in control coefficient of GKRP at high (35 mm) glucose concentration but not at low (7.5 mm) glucose concentration (taken together, these results suggest that the control coefficients of both glucokinase and GKRP on glycogen synthesis are a function of the ratio of the two proteins), and 4) GKRP has a greater control coefficient on glycogen synthesis than on glycolysis. A key finding from this study is the high (negative) control coefficient of GKRP on glycogen synthesis. This suggests that the negative control coefficient of GKRP is the major determinant of the high control coefficient of glucokinase in such a way that the high positive control coefficient of glucokinase is counterbalanced by the negative control coefficient of GKRP. There are no known physiological situations in which hepatic glucokinase is expressed in the absence of GKRP. In all physiological and experimental conditions studied to date, GKRP is present in molar excess relative to glucokinase (7.Vandercammen A. Van Schaftingen E. Biochem. J. 1993; 294: 551-556Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar, 27.Rosa J.L. Perez J.X. Detheux M. Van Schaftingen E. Bartrons R. Hepatology. 1997; 25: 324-328Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The high control coefficient of GKRP suggests that the ratio of expression of glucokinase and GKRP is finely balanced to maintain maximum or near maximum control by both proteins. The increase in control coefficient of glucokinase with increasing GKRP overexpression is consistent with this hypothesis. Because the concentration of GKRP determines the free glucokinase activity, a moderate increase in GKRP by about 2-fold decreases the free glucokinase and thereby increases its control coefficient and capacity for regulation. The greater decrease in the flux control coefficient of GKRP with increasing glucokinase overexpression at high glucose concentration (35 mm) compared with 7.5 mm glucose is also consistent with the hypothesis that there is an optimal ratio of GKRP:glucokinase that ensures maximum control by the two proteins. Because elevated glucose concentrations favor increased dissociation of glucokinase and GKRP, the more rapid decline in flux control coefficient of GKRP at increasing glucokinase can be explained by the lower affinity of GKRP for glucokinase at high glucose concentrations. The lack of decrease in the flux control coefficient of GKRP with increasing glucokinase overexpression at 7.5 mm glucose can be explained by two factors: 1) the lack of decrease in control coefficient of GKRP on glycogen synthesis at 7.5 mm glucose at increasing GKRP overexpression (linear response in Fig. 6 B), and 2) the lower affinity of glucokinase translocation for glucose at elevated GKRP over expression. The finding that GKRP has a greater control coefficient on glycogen synthesis than on glycolysis was not surprising because both glucokinase and glucose 6-phosphatase have higher control coefficients on glycogen synthesis compared with glycolysis (18.Aiston S. Trinh K.Y. Lange A.J. Newgard C.B. Agius L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 24559-24566Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). This is most likely due to differences in the glucose 6-phosphate dependence of the two pathways. The linear inhibition of glycogen synthesis as compared with the nonlinear inhibition of glycolysis with increasing GKRP overexpression may be explained by the absolute dependence of glycogen synthase activation on glucose 6-phosphate produced by glucokinase (35.Villar-Palasi C. Guinovart J.J. FASEB J. 1997; 11: 544-558Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar, 36.Seoane J. Gomez-Foix A.M. O'Doherty R.M. Gomez-Ara C. Newgard C.B. Guinovart J.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 23756-23760Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). In metabolic pathways that are regulated by cooperative feedback inhibition of enzymes, flux control is shifted downstream of the inhibitory metabolite (37.Thomas S. Mooney P.J. Burrell M.M. Fell D.A. Biochem. J. 1997; 322: 119-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). The present study, combined with our previous finding on the control coefficient of glucokinase (16.Agius L. Peak M. Newgard C.B. Gomez-Foix A.M. Guinovart J.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 30479-30486Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar), suggests that a high degree of control of hepatic glycogen synthesis resides before the formation of glucose 6-phosphate. This is consistent with the role of this metabolite in feed-forward activation of glycogen synthase (35.Villar-Palasi C. Guinovart J.J. FASEB J. 1997; 11: 544-558Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar, 36.Seoane J. Gomez-Foix A.M. O'Doherty R.M. Gomez-Ara C. Newgard C.B. Guinovart J.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 23756-23760Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar) and the lack of feedback inhibition of glucokinase by hexose 6-phosphate (18.Aiston S. Trinh K.Y. Lange A.J. Newgard C.B. Agius L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 24559-24566Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Based on the above findings, three conclusions are drawn from this study: 1. GKRP has a high control coefficient on glycogen synthesis and glycolysis. Because we have shown that glucokinase also has a very high control coefficient on hepatic glycogen synthesis (16.Agius L. Peak M. Newgard C.B. Gomez-Foix A.M. Guinovart J.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 30479-30486Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar), we conclude that small changes in either protein will have a large metabolic impact. This is the case for glucokinase because impaired hepatic glycogen synthesis has been shown in diabetic MODY-2 subjects who are heterozygous for glucokinase mutations. On the basis of our results, we predict that mutations in GKRP that affect its binding to glucokinase may have a significant impact on glucose utilization by the liver in the heterozygote state, similar to those shown for MODY-2. 2. Another important conclusion from this study is that changes in the molar ratio of GKRP:glucokinase within the physiological range will affect the sensitivity (S0.5) of the liver cell to glucose. Therefore, by changing the ratio between the components of the system, the cell can adapt to different conditions. This seems to be the casein vivo. Fasting and insulin deficiency are associated with a more rapid decay of glucokinase relative to GKRP, with a consequent increase in the GKRP:glucokinase ratio relative to the normal fed state (7.Vandercammen A. Van Schaftingen E. Biochem. J. 1993; 294: 551-556Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Our results indicate that under these conditions, the affinity of the hepatocyte for glucose is decreased. Conversely, the more rapid increase in glucokinase compared with GKRP during refeeding (7.Vandercammen A. Van Schaftingen E. Biochem. J. 1993; 294: 551-556Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar) would be associated with an increase in glycogen synthesis because of the high control coefficient of glucokinase and the increased affinity for glucose, resulting in a markedly amplified response. 3. Our results show in a quantitative way that the mechanism comprising glucokinase and GKRP confers on the hepatocyte a versatile mechanism to adjust glucose phosphorylation far beyond the sensitivity and responsiveness possible by a single sigmoidal enzyme alone. This mechanism represents a step forward in the design of enzymatic systems with increased responsiveness and ability to respond to an extended range of substrate concentrations.

However, before it can be allosterically regulated, protein kinase C must first be processed by three ordered phosphorylations, the first of which is modification of the activation loop catalyzed by the phosphoinositide-dependent kinase-1 (PDK-1). Here we use limited proteolysis to show that 1) newly synthesized protein kinase C adopts a conformation in which its pseudosubstrate sequence is removed from the active site, and 2) this exposure is essential to allow PDK-1 to phosphorylate the enzyme. Precursor (unphosphorylated) protein kinase C βII obtained by 1) in vitro transcription and translation, 2) expression of a phosphorylation-deficient mutant (T500V), or 3) in vivo labeling with a pulse of [35S]cysteine/methionine is cleaved at the amino-terminal pseudosubstrate by the endoproteinase Arg-C. In marked contrast to mature (phosphorylated) enzyme, proteolysis occurs in the absence of lipid activators, revealing that precursor protein kinase C has its pseudosubstrate sequence removed constitutively. Additionally, we show that PDK-1 is unable to phosphorylate protein kinase C when the active site is sterically blocked by a peptide substrate. Neither can mature enzyme be dephosphorylated when the active site is blocked by binding either the pseudosubstrate sequence or a heterologous substrate. Thus, the accessibility of the activation loop to both phosphorylation and dephosphorylation requires an exposed pseudosubstrate. In summary, newly synthesized protein kinase C adopts a conformation in which its pseudosubstrate sequence is removed from the active site, rendering the activation loop accessible to phosphorylation by PDK-1.

Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 161-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (851) Google Scholar). In the first regulatory mechanism, protein kinase C isozymes are rendered catalytically competent by a series of ordered phosphorylation events, the first of which has recently been shown to be catalyzed by PDK-11 (2.Chou M.M.

Biol. 1998; 8: 1366-1375Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar). PDK-1 phosphorylates a segment near the entrance to the active site referred to as the activation loop; the phosphorylated position corresponds to Thr500 in the conventional protein kinase C βII (5.Keranen L.M. Dutil E.M. Newton A.C. Curr. Biol. 1995; 5: 1394-1403Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (395) Google Scholar). This phosphorylation serves to correctly position residues for catalysis and triggers the autophosphorylation of two conserved positions at the carboxyl terminus, a turn motif (Thr641 in protein kinase C βII), and a hydrophobic motif (Ser660 in protein kinase C βII) (6.Behn-Krappa A. Newton A.C. Curr. Biol. 1999; 9: 728-737Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). The phosphorylated “mature” species localizes to the cytosol where it is maintained in an inactive conformation by an autoinhibitory pseudosubstrate sequence (7.House C. Kemp B.E. Science. 1987; 238: 1726-1728Crossref PubMed Scopus (791) Google Scholar, 8.Orr J.W. Keranen L.M. Newton A.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 15263-15266Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In the second regulatory mechanism, generation of diacylglycerol causes mature (phosphorylated) protein kinase C to translocate to the plasma membrane where it undergoes a conformational change in which the pseudosubstrate sequence is removed from the active site (8.Orr J.W. Keranen L.M. Newton A.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 15263-15266Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Freed of steric constraints, protein kinase C is able to phosphorylate targets and elicit a cellular response. Dual regulation, first by phosphorylation to “prime” the enzyme and second by cofactor binding to remove autoinhibition, allows for ultra-sensitive regulation of activity. Autoinhibitory sequences regulate the activity of a large number of kinases, including the archetypal kinase, protein kinase A, where binding of cAMP to the regulatory subunit of this kinase causes dissociation of the catalytic subunit (9.Taylor S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 8443-8446Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Such conformational regulation of kinase activity by intra- or intermolecular autoinhibitory sequences provides an exquisite switch to kinase function. However, conformational regulation of substrates can be equally critical in controlling phosphorylation activity. In particular, conformational changes, which expose phosphorylation sites, can dictate whether or not phosphorylation takes place. Akt (protein kinase B) and p70 S6 kinase are two examples of kinases whose activity is regulated by conformation-dependent phosphorylation. Similar to protein kinase C, these kinases are regulated by phosphorylation at the activation loop by PDK-1 (10.Alessi D.R. Janes S.R. Downes C.P. Holmes A.B. Gaffney P.R.J. Reese C.B. Cohen P. Curr.

Science. 1998; 279: 707-710Crossref PubMed Scopus (731) Google Scholar). This phosphorylation depends on specific conformational changes that render the activation loop accessible to phosphorylation. In the case of Akt, binding of polyphosphoinositides to its pleckstrin homology domain is required to expose the activation loop phosphorylation site (13.Alessi D.R. Deak M. Casamayor A. Caudwell F.B. Morrice N. Norman D.G. Gaffney P. Reese C.B. MacDougall C.N. Harbison D. Ashworth A. Bownes M. Curr.

Activation loop phosphorylation of S6 kinase by PDK-1 also requires a distinct conformational change: this kinase is first phosphorylated on a set of proline residues located within its carboxyl-terminal pseudosubstrate sequence. This set of phosphorylation events is essential to allow PDK-1 phosphorylation, presumably by exposing the activation loop (12.Pullen N. Dennis P.B. Andjelkovic M. Dufner A. Kozma S.C.

Allosteric regulation of substrates of PDK-1 may be particularly critical because the intrinsic catalytic activity of PDK-1 does not appear to be tightly regulated (18.Belham C. Wu S. Avruch J. Curr. Biol. 1999; 9: R93-R96Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). In this communication, we addressed whether the phosphorylation of protein kinase C by PDK-1 is conformationally regulated. We show that 1) the pseudosubstrate of protein kinase C does not occupy the active site when the enzyme is in the unphosphorylated conformation and 2) this open conformation is critical in allowing PDK-1 to phosphorylate the activation loop and initiate the maturation of the enzyme. Once protein kinase C is fully phosphorylated, the pseudosubstrate sequence gains occupancy of the active site, locking the enzyme in an inactive conformation. In the presence of diacylglycerol, protein kinase C translocates to the membrane, resulting in renewed release of the pseudosubstrate from the active site. Thus, the pseudosubstrate plays two roles: a novel one in which it regulates the phosphorylation of precursor enzyme and the well characterized one in which it regulates the activity of the mature enzyme.

A histidine-tagged construct of the catalytic domain of protein kinase C βII (residues 286–673; histidine tag at the amino terminus) was expressed in E. coli and purified on Probond nickel resin (Invitrogen) and stored at −20 °C in 50 mm Tris buffer, pH 7.5, 1% Triton X-100, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, and 150 mm Imidazole. Recombinant protein phosphatase 1 catalytic subunit α isoform (CS1) purified from E. coliwas a generous gift from Dr. Anna DePaoli-Roach (Indiana University). Polyclonal antibodies against the carboxyl terminus of protein kinase C βII were from Calbiochem and Santa Cruz Biotechnology. A polyclonal antibody (P500) directed against the phosphorylated activation loop of protein kinase C βII was generated by immunizing rabbits with a phosphopeptide based on the sequence: Asp494-Gly495-Val496-Thr497-Thr498-Lys499-phospho-Thr500-Phe501- Cys502-Gly503-Thr504-Pro505-Asp506. The specificity for the activation loop phosphate has been previously described (2.Chou M.M. Hou W. Johnson J. Graham L.K. Lee M.H. Chen C.-S. Newton A.C. Schaffhausen B.S. Toker A. Curr. Biol. 1998; 6: 1069-1077Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Google Scholar). A polyclonal antibody against a peptide comprising residues 645–673 of protein kinase C βII was provided by Eli Lilly. The cDNA for rat protein kinase C βII was a gift from Daniel E. Koshland, Jr. (University of California, Berkeley) and that for rat protein kinase C α was from Yusuf Hannun (Medical University of South Carolina). All other chemicals were reagent grade. Protein kinase C βII was transcribed and translated using the TNT® T7 Quick Coupled Transcription/Translation System (Promega). Protein kinase C βII DNA in pcDNA3 (200 ng) was added to 80 μl of TNT® Quick Master Mix in the presence of 20 μCi of [35S]methionine (translation grade) and nuclease-free water (Promega) for 90 min at 30 °C. Samples were then subjected to proteolysis as described below. COS7 cells were transfected with 5 μg of protein kinase C βII (pcDNA3) or T500V protein kinase C βII (pcDNA3) using the Superfect transfection method (Qiagen). DNA was added to 300 μl of serum-free DMEM and 30 μl of Superfect reagent and incubated at 22 °C for 5 min. The DNA-containing mixture was added to cells plated at 70% confluency on 10-cm tissue culture dishes containing 3 ml of DMEM + 10% fetal bovine serum. Cells were incubated for 3 h at 37 °C and then washed with DMEM + 10% fetal bovine serum. Cells were pulsed after 24 h as described below or harvested after 48 h in 600 μl of lysis buffer containing 20 mm HEPES buffer, pH 7.5, 1% Triton X-100, 1 mm DTT, 300 μm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 200 μm benzamidine, 40 μg ml−1 leupeptin, and 100 nm microcystin. Lysates were centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 20 min at 4 °C; supernatants were stored in 50% glycerol at −20 °C. COS7 cells were plated on a 10-cm tissue dish and transfected with protein kinase C α DNA as described above. At 24 h post-transfection, cells were incubated in methionine/cysteine-deficient DMEM + 10% fetal bovine serum for 15 min at 37 °C and then pulsed with 7 mCi of [35S]methionine/cysteine for 7 min at 37 °C. Cells were then washed with DMEM + 10% fetal bovine serum containing 5 mm unlabeled methionine and 5 mm unlabeled cysteine and lysed in 1 ml of lysis buffer containing 20 mmHEPES buffer, pH 7.5, 1% Triton X-100, 1 mm DTT, 300 μm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 200 μmbenzamidine, 40 μg ml−1 leupeptin, and 100 nm microcystin. Cell lysates were centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 20 min at 4 °C, and protein kinase C α in the supernatant was immunoprecipitated with protein kinase C α antibodies (Transduction Laboratories) as described (2.Chou M.M. Hou W. Johnson J. Graham L.K. Lee M.H. Chen C.-S. Newton A.C. Schaffhausen B.S. Toker A. Curr. Biol. 1998; 6: 1069-1077Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Google Scholar). In vitro translated protein kinase C βII (described above) was incubated with 2 units ml−1 of Arg-C for 1–60 min at 30 °C. Aliquots were removed at indicated times into 1/5 volume SDS-PAGE sample buffer. COS7 cell lysates containing protein kinase C βII or T500V protein kinase C were incubated with 0, 10, 20, or 35 units ml−1 Arg-C in 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 1 mm DTT, and 600 nm microcystin in the presence or absence of 140 μm phosphatidylserine, 3.8 μmdiacylglycerol vesicles, and 100 μm CaCl2 for 30 min at 30 °C. Reactions were terminated by the addition of 1/5 volume SDS-PAGE sample buffer. Protein A/G-agarose beads with bound immunoprecipitated pulse-chased protein kinase C were treated with 2.5 units ml−1 Arg-C in 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 1 mm DTT, and 600 nm microcystin in the presence or absence of 140 μm phosphatidylserine, 3.8 μm diacylglycerol, and 100 μmCaCl2 for 10 min at 30 °C. Reactions were quenched by the addition of 1/5 volume SDS-PAGE sample buffer. All samples were separated by SDS-PAGE (7%) and electrophoretically transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane. In vitro translated and pulse-labeled protein kinase C were visualized by exposing membrane on a Bio-Rad Molecular Imager System screen for 18 or 72 h, respectively. A Western blot of in vitro translated samples was then performed by probing the membrane with Santa Cruz Biotechnology protein kinase C βII primary antibodies, incubating with peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies, and detecting labeling with chemiluminescence. Protein kinase C βII (20 nm) was incubated with the catalytic subunit of protein phosphatase 1 (25 units ml−1) in 20 mm HEPES buffer, pH 7.5, containing 200 μm MnCl2, 1 mm DTT, 0.5 mm CaCl2, and 0.04 mm EDTA in the presence or absence of 140 μmphosphatidylserine and 4 μm diacylglycerol for 20 min at 22 °C. Where indicated, reactions were carried out in the presence of 100 μg ml−1 of protamine sulfate or selective peptide. Reactions were quenched by the addition of 1/5 volume SDS-PAGE sample buffer and analyzed by SDS-PAGE (7%) and silver staining (21.Poehling H.-M. Neuhoff V. Electrophoresis. 1981; 2: 141-147Crossref Scopus (176) Google Scholar). In one experiment, histone H1 was phosphorylated by protein kinase C and used as a substrate for the catalytic subunit of protein phosphatase 1. Purified protein kinase C catalytic domain (30 nm) was incubated with 25 nm purified PDK-1 in the presence of 10 mmHEPES, pH 7.5, 500 μm ATP, 50 μmMgCl2, 1 mm DTT, and 0, 80, 175, or 350 μm selective peptide for 1 h at 30 °C. Reactions were quenched by the addition of 1/5 volume SDS-PAGE sample buffer, separated by SDS-PAGE (7%), and electrophoretically transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride. Western blots were performed by probing membrane with indicated primary antibodies, incubating with peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies, and detecting labeling with chemiluminescence. Molecular modeling studies suggested that the phosphorylation site on the activation loop of protein kinase C is effectively masked when the pseudosubstrate is bound in the substrate-binding cavity (22.Orr J.W. Newton A.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 27715-27718Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Specifically, an invariant basic residue (Lys29 in protein kinase C βII) within the pseudosubstrate sequence lies over the phosphorylation site (Thr500 in protein kinase C βII). The apparent blocking of this key regulatory switch by the pseudosubstrate led us to explore whether the pseudosubstrate is, in fact, out of the active site in precursor (unphosphorylated) protein kinase C. To this end, we used the endoproteinase Arg-C as a tool to probe whether the pseudosubstrate of newly synthesized protein kinase C is exposed. We have previously shown that this protease cleaves Arg19 of the pseudosubstrate sequence of protein kinase C βII when the enzyme is in the active but not inactive conformation (8.Orr J.W. Keranen L.M. Newton A.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 15263-15266Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 23.Orr J.W. Newton A.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 8383-8387Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The amino terminally truncated product migrates with a molecular mass approximately 4 kDa smaller than that of the native enzyme on SDS-PAGE (8.Orr J.W. Keranen L.M. Newton A.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 15263-15266Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Newly synthesized, unphosphorylated protein kinase C (precursor protein kinase C) was obtained by three independent methods. First, we examined the protease sensitivity of the activation loop mutant, T500V, expressed in COS7 cells. The lack of negative charge at the activation loop site prevents autophosphorylation at the two carboxyl-terminal phosphorylation sites (6.Behn-Krappa A. Newton A.C. Curr. Biol. 1999; 9: 728-737Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). Therefore, similar to precursor protein kinase C, the T500V mutant is not phosphorylated at any of the threein vivo positions. The Western blot in Fig.1 A shows that treatment of the T500V mutant with endoproteinase Arg-C resulted in the removal of ∼4 kDa. This cleavage occurred at the amino terminus of the enzyme because the product was recognized by an antibody directed toward the carboxyl terminus of protein kinase C βII (residues 660–673). The T500V mutant was proteolyzed both in the presence or absence of phosphatidylserine and diacylglycerol (Fig. 1 A, top panel, lanes 1–4 and 5–8, respectively). The rate of proteolysis was not significantly different with or without lipid (compare lanes 4 and 8 where the ratio of native:cleaved protein kinase C is similar). In contrast, cleavage of wild-type (fully phosphorylated) protein kinase C expressed in COS7 cells is dependent on the presence of phosphatidylserine and diacylglycerol (Fig. 1 A, bottom panel;lanes 1–4). The requirement of wild-type enzyme for lipid activators (Fig. 1 A, bottom panel; lanes 5–8) is consistent with previous studies showing that the enzyme must be in the active conformation in order for the pseudosubstrate to be proteolytically labile (23.Orr J.W. Newton A.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 8383-8387Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, the phosphorylation-defective mutant, T500V, has a constitutively exposed pseudosubstrate. In a second approach, the precursor conformation was obtained byin vitro transcription/translation of protein kinase C βII. The expressed protein is not processed by phosphorylation; it co-migrates with dephosphorylated enzyme and is not recognized by phospho-specific antibodies (24.Edwards A.S. Faux M.C. Scott J.D. Newton A.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 6461-6468Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Treatment of the in vitrotranscribed/translated protein kinase C with Arg-C, in the absence of phosphatidylserine and diacylglycerol, resulted in the time-dependent generation of a proteolytic product, which migrated with an apparent molecular mass 4 kDa smaller than the starting material (Fig. 1 B, top panel). This proteolytic product was labeled by antibodies generated against a peptide derived from the carboxyl terminus of protein kinase C (lower panel) but not antibodies directed against the first 19 amino acids of the protein (data not shown). Thus, the proteolytic site was at the amino terminus, consistent with the characterized cleavage at the pseudosubstrate. Lastly, we investigated the endoproteinase Arg-C sensitivity of newly synthesized protein kinase C from pulse-labeled COS7 cells expressing wild-type protein kinase C α.Lanes 1–3 in Fig. 1 C show [35S]methionine/cysteine-labeled protein kinase C one minute after pulse labeling COS7 cells. Protein kinase C obtained in this manner has the same electrophoretic mobility as both the in vitro transcribed/translated, unphosphorylated protein kinase C and the phosphorylation-deficient mutants of protein kinase C (data not shown). This precursor form is chased into the fully phosphorylated, activable form with a half-time of 20 min. 2E. M. Dutil and A. C. Newton, manuscript in preparation. Thus, the pulse-labeled protein kinase C in Fig. 1 C represents precursor protein kinase C that has not yet been processed by phosphorylation. Fig. 1 C shows that this unphosphorylated species is proteolyzed both in the presence (lane 2) and absence (lane 3) of phosphatidylserine and diacylglycerol to a product which migrates approximately 4 kDa faster than untreated enzyme. Consistent with the analysis of pulse-labeled precursor protein kinase C, incubation of crude cell lysates with Arg-C resulted in a lipid-independent proteolysis of the faster migrating unphosphorylated protein kinase C and a lipid-dependent proteolysis of the slower migrating phosphorylated protein kinase C (data not shown). These data reveal that precursor, unphosphorylated protein kinase C adopts a conformation in which the pseudosubstrate is removed from the active site. We next explored the conformational and steric requirements necessary for the phosphorylation sites of protein kinase C to be accessible. We have previously shown that the pseudosubstrate must be exposed in order for protein kinase C to be dephosphorylated by either protein phosphatase 1 or protein phosphatase 2A (25.Dutil E.M. Keranen L.M. DePaoli-Roach A.A. Newton A.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 29359-29362Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Mass spectrometric analysis established that protein phosphatase 1 dephosphorylates all three in vivo phosphorylation sites, resulting in a large increase in electrophoretic mobility (equivalent to ∼4 kDa), whereas protein phosphatase 2A dephosphorylates the activation loop (Thr500) and hydrophobic site (Ser660) resulting in an intermediate shift in electrophoretic mobility (equivalent to ∼2 kDa). In this study, we investigated whether occupancy of the active site masked the phosphorylation sites. Fig. 2 shows that the catalytic subunit of protein phosphatase 1 was unable to dephosphorylate purified protein kinase C βII in the absence of lipid activators (lane 2). However, the presence of phosphatidylserine and diacylglycerol resulted in dephosphorylation of the enzyme, as evidenced by the increase in electrophoretic mobility (lane 3). This lipid-dependent dephosphorylation was quantitatively blocked in the presence of protamine sulfate (lane 5). Similarly, the presence of another substrate, a heptapeptide based on the MARCKS protein, also inhibited dephosphorylation (lane 7). Under the conditions of the assay, the heptapeptide had no significant effect (± 3%) on the activity of protein phosphatase 1 toward dephosphorylation of 32P-phosphorylated histone; protamine reduced histone phosphorylation by 50%. In addition, dephosphorylation of the in vitro autophosphorylation sites on protein kinase C was unaffected by the presence of peptide and only partially inhibited (30%) by the presence of protamine (data not shown). Thus, the ability of the peptide to reduce the dephosphorylation of protein kinase C was specific to the in vivo sites, including the activation loop, and not the in vitro sites. Although it is not possible to entirely rule out some direct effects of protamine on phosphatase activity, the quantitative inhibition of dephosphorylation of the in vivo protein kinase C sites but only partial inhibition of histone phosphorylation or in vitro autophosphorylation sites suggests affects beyond merely inhibiting the phosphatase. Thus, occupancy of the active site by either pseudosubstrate (lane 2) or substrate (lanes 5 and 7) reduced dephosphorylation. We next examined whether pseudosubstrate exposure was essential for the first step in the processing of protein kinase C, phosphorylation by PDK-1 on the activation loop. Specifically, we examined whether the ability of PDK-1 to phosphorylate precursor protein kinase C was impaired by occupancy of the active site. We used the catalytic domain of protein kinase C, expressed in E. coli, for these experiments because this form of the enzyme is not phosphorylated at any of the three in vivo positions and is an effective substrate for PDK-1 (4.Dutil E.M. Toker A. Newton A.C. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: 1366-1375Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar). In the absence of the protein kinase C substrate, the selective peptide, PDK-1, effectively phosphorylated the activation loop of the catalytic domain of protein kinase C (Fig.3 A, lane 1) as assessed using an antibody that specifically labels phosphorylated Thr500 (Fig. 3 A, upper panel). However, increasing concentrations of selective peptide resulted in increased inhibition of activation loop phosphorylation by PDK-1 (Fig.3 A, lanes 2–4). The selective peptide had no effect on the intrinsic activity of PDK-1; the autophosphorylation of PDK-1 was unaffected by the peptide (Fig. 3 B). Nor did PDK-1 directly phosphorylate the selective peptide (data not shown). Thus, the inhibition of activation loop phosphorylation did not result from the selective peptide affecting PDK-1 activity or from substrate competition. These data reveal that peptide binding to the unphosphorylated kinase domain prevents PDK-1 phosphorylation of the activation loop. Although the mechanism of substrate binding to unphosphorylated kinase domain is not known, these data suggest that the pseudosubstrate must be removed from the active site in order for PDK-1 to phosphorylate the activation loop. This study reveals exquisite conformational control of protein kinase C not only by allosteric activators, but also by phosphorylation. Specifically, we show that 1) precursor, unphosphorylated protein kinase C, adopts a conformation in which the pseudosubstrate is removed from the active site and 2) this conformation is required to free steric hindrance at the active site and allow PDK-1 to catalyze the initial phosphorylation event on the activation loop. Once protein kinase C is phosphorylated, the pseudosubstrate is able to block the active site, presumably by occupying the substrate-binding cavity. The conformation of the pseudosubstrate of the phosphorylated enzyme is then under allosteric control by lipid activators."

Gel filtration chromatography, SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and N-terminal amino acid sequencing indicated that the native lectin, designated P. squamosus agglutinin, is composed of two identical 28-kDa subunits associated by noncovalent bonds. P. squamosus agglutinin agglutinated human A, B, and O and rabbit red blood cells but precipitated only with human α2-macroglobulin, of many glycoproteins and polysaccharides tested. The detailed carbohydrate binding properties of the purified lectin were elucidated using three different approaches,i.e. precipitation inhibition assay (in solution binding assay), fluorescence quenching studies, and glycolipid binding by lectin staining on high-performance thin layer chromatography (solid-phase binding assay). Based on the results obtained by these assays, we conclude that although the P. squamosus lectin binds β-d-galactosides, it has an extended carbohydrate-combining site that exhibits highest specificity and affinity toward nonreducing terminal Neu5Acα2,6Galβ1,4Glc/GlcNAc (6′-sialylated type II chain) of N-glycans (2000-fold stronger than toward galactose).

Hughes R.C. Monsigny M. Osawa T. Sharon N. Nature. 1980; 285: 66Crossref Scopus (642) Google Scholar). They are ubiquitous in the biosphere, having been found in viruses, bacteria, fungi, plants, and animals (2.Kocourek J. Liener I.E. Sharon N. Goldtein I.J. The Lectins: Properties, Functions and Applications in Biology and Medicine. Academic Press, Orlando, FL1986: 1-32Crossref Google Scholar). Lectins of known specificity recognizing sialic acid serve as valuable reagents in glycobiological research. They can be employed for the detection and preliminary characterization of sialic acid-containing glycoconjugates on the surface of cells and for assaying the incorporation of sialic acid into complex carbohydrates in biosynthetic studies. In their immobilized form, these lectins can be used for the resolution and isolation of sialic acid-containing glycoconjugates. Lectins are found in greatest quantity and are most readily purified from plant sources, especially higher plants, although relatively few sialic acid-binding lectins have been identified in the plant world (including fungi), which lacks sialic acid. During the last decade, there has been a growing interest in fungal lectins, largely due to the discovery that some of these lectins exhibit antitumor activities, e.g. Volvariella volvacea lectin shows antitumor activity against sarcoma S-180 cells (3.Lin J.Y.

We report herein the purification and characterization ofPolyporus squamosus lectin (designated PSA), a Neu5Acα2–6Galβ1–4Glc/GlcNAc-specific lectin present in the carpophores (fruiting bodies) of this member of the Polyporaceae family. Carpophores of P. squamosus (Huds.) Fr. were collected in late summer 1998 from a decaying Ulmus stump in Ann Arbor, Michigan.

Except for asialofetuin, asialoglycoproteins were prepared by heating the corresponding native glycoproteins in 0.1 mhydrochloric acid at 80 °C for 1 h, followed by dialysis and lyophilization; the removal of sialic acid was confirmed by the thiobarbituric acid assay (11.Warren L.

Methyl 3-O-β-d-galactopyranosyl-2-acetamido-2-deoxy-β-d-glucopyranoside (Galβ1, 3GlcNAcβ1-OMe) and methyl 4-O-β-d-galactopyranosyl-2-acetamido-2-deoxy-β-d-glucopyranoside (Galβ1, 4GlcNAcβ1-OMe) were synthesized in this laboratory. Molecular mass standards used in SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) (i.e. BenchMark protein ladders) and alkaline phosphatase substrate package (i.e.5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolylphosphate p-toluidine salt and nitroblue tetrazolium chloride) were from Life Technologies, Inc. All procedures were conducted at 4 °C. The fruiting bodies from P. squamosus (fresh weight, 80 g) were homogenized and extracted overnight with 400 ml of extraction buffer (10 mm sodium phosphate, 0.15m NaCl, 0.135 mm CaCl2, 0.04% sodium azide, pH 7.2 (PBS), containing 10 mm thiourea, 0.25 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 1 g/liter ascorbic acid). The homogenate was squeezed through two layers of cheesecloth and centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 30 min. To the supernatant solution was added solid ammonium sulfate to 25% saturation. After standing overnight, the precipitate was removed by centrifugation, and the supernatant solution was applied directly onto a β-d-galactosyl-Synsorb 100 column (18 × 1.2 cm; bed volume, 80 ml), which had been equilibrated with 10 mmPBS (pH 7.2) containing 1 m ammonium sulfate. The column was washed with the same solution until the absorbance at 280 nm of the effluent had fallen below 0.01. The affinity-adsorbed lectin was desorbed with 0.2 m lactose in 10 mm PBS, collected, dialyzed extensively against distilled water, and lyophilized (designated crude PSA). Approximately 18 mg of crude lectin was obtained from 80 g of fresh fruiting body. Crude lectin was reconstituted in 50 mm phosphate buffer, pH 7.8, and percolated slowly through a DEAE-Sephacel column (17 × 1.2 cm, bed volume 75 ml) preequilibrated and eluted with the same buffer (50 mm phosphate buffer, pH 7.8). The elution was monitored by absorbance at 280 nm until it become negligible, whereupon the adsorbed protein was eluted with 1 m sodium chloride. Both the DEAE-unbound (pass through) and DEAE-bound peak fractions were collected, dialyzed against distilled water, lyophilized, reconstituted in 10 mm PBS, pH 7.2, and tested for electrophoretic homogeneity and agglutination activity. Protein concentration was determined by the method of Lowry et al. (12.Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), using bovine serum albumin as a standard. Native gel electrophoresis using a 12.5% slab gel was carried out in alkaline buffer system (Tris/glycine, pH 8.3) (13.Davis B.J. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1964; 121: 404-427Crossref PubMed Scopus (15957) Google Scholar). SDS-PAGE in the presence and absence of β-mercaptoethanol using a 12.5% slab gel was conducted in Tris/tricine buffer system as described by Schagger and von Jagow (14.Schagger H. von Jagow G. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 166: 368-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (10481) Google Scholar). The hemagglutinating activity of the lectin was determined by a 2-fold serial dilution procedure using formaldehyde-treated (15.Nowak T.P. Barondes S.H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1975; 393: 115-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar) human and rabbit erythrocytes as described previously (16.Crowley J.F. Goldstein I.J. Methods Enzymol. 1982; 83: 368-373Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). The hemagglutination titer was defined as the reciprocal of the highest dilution still exhibiting hemagglutination. The molecular mass and molecular structure of the purified PSA was determined by gel filtration and SDS-PAGE performed in the presence and absence of β-mercaptoethanol. Gel filtration chromatography of the lectin was carried out on a Bio-Gel P-150 column (1.45 × 120 cm; bed volume, 198 ml) operating at room temperature in PBS, pH 7.2, with or without 0.2m lactose, at a flow rate of 10 ml/h. Fractions of 10 min/tube (approximately 1.7 ml/tube) were collected and monitored atA 280. The column was calibrated with the following standard proteins: bovine γ-globulin (158 kDa), bovine serum albumin (67 kDa), chicken ovalbumin (45 kDa), equine myoglobin (17 kDa), and vitamin B-12 (1.35 kDa). Blue dextran 2000 was used for determination of the void volume of the column. The amino acid composition and the N-terminal sequence of the purified lectin were analyzed by the Protein and Carbohydrate Structure Core facility on this campus as described previously (17.Mo H.Q. Van Damme E.J.M. Peumans W.J. Goldstein I.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 7666-7673Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar,18.Mo H.Q. Goldstein I.J. Glycoconjugate J. 1994; 11: 424-431Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). Tryptophan was estimated spectrophotometrically in 6 mguanidine hydrochloride (19.Edelhoch H. Biochemistry. 1967; 6: 1948-1954Crossref PubMed Scopus (3007) Google Scholar). Sulfhydryl groups were estimated by release of 2-nitro-5-mercaptobenzoic acid (ε0 = 13, 600m−1 cm−1 at 410 nm) from 5,5′-dithiobis(2-nitrobenzoic acid). Quantitative precipitation assays were performed by a microprecipitation technique as described previously (17.Mo H.Q. Van Damme E.J.M. Peumans W.J. Goldstein I.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 7666-7673Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, varying amounts of glycoproteins or polysaccharides, ranging from 0 to 100 μg, were added to 10 μg of purified PSA in a total volume of 160 μl of PBS, pH 7.2. After incubation at 37 °C for 1 h, the reaction mixtures were stored at 4 °C for 48 h. The precipitates formed were centrifuged, washed three times with 150 μl of ice-cold PBS, dissolved in 0.05 m NaOH, and determined for protein content by Lowry's method using bovine serum albumin as standard. For hapten inhibition assays, increasing amounts of various haptenic saccharides were added to the reaction mixture consisting of 10 μg of the purified lectin and 5 μg of α2-macroglobulin in a final volume of 160 μl of PBS, pH 7.2. After incubation at 37 °C for 1 h and storage at 4 °C for 48 h, the precipitated proteins were centrifuged, washed, and determined. The percentage of inhibition was calculated, and inhibition curves were constructed. The minimum concentration of each haptenic sugar required for 50% inhibition was obtained from corresponding complete inhibition curves. The biotinylation of the purified lectin was achieved using EZ-Link NHS-LC-Biotin according to the manufacturer's instructions, except that 0.2 mlactose was added to the reaction mixture to protect the carbohydrate-binding sites. After coupling, the lectin activity was ascertained by hemagglutination assay. Two identical sets of glycolipids were separated chromatographically in parallel on the same aluminum-backed silica gel 60 HPTLC plate (Merck, Darmstadt, Germany) using chloroform/methanol/water (65:25:4, by volume) for neutral glycolipids or chloroform/methanol/aqueous 0.25% KCl (50:40:10, by volume) for gangliosides as developing solvent. The reference chromatogram was chemically visualized by spraying the plate with orcinol reagent. The lectin staining was performed as follows: after drying, the plates were blocked by overlaying with 1% gelatin in PBS containing 0.1% NaN3 and incubating overnight at room temperature. The plates were then overlaid with biotin-labeled lectin diluted in PBS containing 1% bovine serum albumin and 0.05% Tween 20, and incubated at 37 °C for 2 h. After rinsing the plates five times with 10 mm Tris/HCl buffer, pH 9.5, containing 0.05% Tween 20, they were overlaid with alkaline phosphatase-streptavidin diluted with 0.1 m Tris/HCl, pH 9.5, containing 100 mm NaCl and 5 mm MgCl2, incubated at 37 °C for 1 h, washed five times with the same buffer, and finally visualized with 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolylphosphate-nitroblue tetrazolium chloride. Asialofetuin, 2.5 mg (40 nmol) in 1.0 ml of 50 mm MES buffer, pH 6.0, containing 10 mm MnCl2, 0.15M NaCl, 10% glycerol, 2 μmol of CMP-sialic acid, and 10 milliunits of rat liver α2,6-sialyltransferase (Roche Molecular Biochemicals, 8 units/mg of protein) was incubated 24 h at 37o, followed by addition of another 1 μmol of CMP-sialic acid and 5 milliunits of sialyltransferase. After an additional 24 h of incubation, the reaction mixture was passed through a column (1 × 15 cm) of BioGel P-10. Fractions containing protein were pooled, dialyzed against distilled water, and lyophilized. The resialylated fetuin contained 3.1 mol of sialic acid/mol of protein, compared with a negligible amount (<0.1 mol of sialic acid/mol of protein) in the asialofetuin and approximately 10 mol of sialic acid/mol of protein in native fetuin. Ultraviolet absorbance spectra were recorded on a Shimadzu model UV160U spectrophotometer; fluorescence spectra were recorded on an ISA JodinYvon-Spex Fluoromax-2 spectrofluorometer. In a survey of mushrooms for hemagglutination activity by Pemberton (20.Pemberton R.L. Mycol. Res. 1994; 98: 277-290Crossref Scopus (44) Google Scholar), it was found that the extract of P. squamosus exhibited strong hemolytic activity. In the present study, by using hemolysis-resistant, formaldehyde-treated erythrocytes, we observed that the crude extract of P. squamosus contained a lectin(s) that agglutinated rabbit and human erythrocytes, irrespective of blood group type (type B erythrocytes were agglutinated slightly better than those of types A and O). The hemagglutinating activity was inhibited byd-galactose and d-galactose-related carbohydrates, such as d-fucose, l-arabinose, melibiose, and lactose. Because the hemagglutination activity of the crude extract of P. squamosus was inhibited by d-galactose and lactose, β-d-galactosyl-Synsorb was used as an affinity absorbent for isolation of the lectin. As shown in Fig.1, upon nondenaturing PAGE at pH 8.3, the lectin preparation obtained from affinity chromatography on β-d-galactosyl-Synsorb showed two protein bands, which we later found could be separated from each other by ion exchange chromatography on DEAE-Sephacel in 0.05 m phosphate buffer, pH 7.8 (Fig. 1). Under these conditions, the major portion of the lectin activity was not retained on the DEAE column. This DEAE-unbound fraction was electrophoretically pure (designated purified PSA). The minimal concentration of the purified lectin required for the agglutination of formaldehyde-treated human type B erythrocytes was 0.6 μg/ml. Removal of divalent metal ions by extensive dialysis of this fraction against buffer containing 1.25 mm EDTA had little effect on its agglutination activity. The DEAE-bound fraction exhibited about 30 times lower agglutinating activity, 19 μg/ml being required for agglutination; therefore, in the present study, characterization of only the DEAE-unbound fraction was pursued. Upon gel filtration chromatography on Bio-Gel P-150, the purified lectin eluted as a single, symmetric peak, irrespective of the presence of 0.2m lactose, at an elution volume corresponding to an apparent molecular mass of 52 kDa (not shown). On the other hand, upon SDS-PAGE, with or without β-mercaptoethanol, purified PSA gave a single band with an apparent mass of 28 kDa (Fig.2). Taken together, these data suggest that at neutral pH, the lectin exists as a homodimer of 28-kDa subunits associated by noncovalent bonds. No neutral carbohydrate was detected using the phenol-sulfuric acid assay. As shown in Table I, purified PSA contains an extremely high proportion of hydrophobic amino acids (Ala, Ile, Leu, Val, and Phe) that account for one-third of the total amino acids, high contents of acidic and hydroxyl amino acids (Asx and Glx account for 22%; Ser and Thr, 14%), and relatively high amounts (11.5%) of aromatic amino acids, accounting for the high absorbency at 280 nm of the lectin (A 1% = 29.0). The lectin also contains two residues each of methionine and cysteine. No free sulfhydryl groups were detected by reaction with 5,5′-dithiobis(2-nitrobenzoic acid); together with the observation that β-mercaptoethanol has no effect on SDS-PAGE migration, the presence of an intrachain disulfide linkage is indicated. A single N-terminal amino acid sequence, H2N+-PFEGHGIYHIPSVNTANVRI, was determined. A search of the protein data base revealed no significant homology of this N-terminal sequence to any sequence in the data base.Table IAmino acid composition of purified P. squamosus agglutininAmino acidMol %Residues/subunitAsx14.538Glx7.5320Ser6.5117Gly10.728His1.333Arg2.717Thr7.7220Ala9.6025Pro3.509Tyr2.948Val5.7115Met0.892Cys0.65aEstimated by 5,5′-dithiobis(2-nitrobenzoic acid) after denaturation (6 m guanidine HCl) and reduction.2Ile4.2511Leu7.6520Phe5.5214Lys4.9413Trp3.18bEstimated spectrophotometrically by the method of Edelhoch (19).8Total residues260Calculated molecular mass, 28,150–28,200 kDaa Estimated by 5,5′-dithiobis(2-nitrobenzoic acid) after denaturation (6 m guanidine HCl) and reduction.b Estimated spectrophotometrically by the method of Edelhoch (19.Edelhoch H.

Open table in a new tab Inasmuch as the hemagglutinating activity of the crude extract of P. squamosus was specifically inhibited by galactose and the lectin was initially isolated by affinity chromatography on β-d-galactosyl-Synsorb, various glycoproteins were chemically desialylated to expose their penultimated-galactosyl residues and tested for their ability to precipitate the lectin. However, none of these asialoglycoproteins formed a detectable precipitate with the lectin. The galactomannan fromCassia alata, which contains multiple terminal α-d-galactosyl residues, also failed to precipitate with the lectin. To our great surprise, of the many native glycoproteins tested, including fetuin, transferrin, thyroglobulin, α1-acid glycoprotein, bovine mucin, and ovine submaxillary mucin, only human α2-macroglobulin, but not its desialylated form, gave a pronounced precipitation reaction with the lectin. Therefore, human α2-macroglobulin was employed as a precipitant in the inhibition assays. The results of sugar hapten inhibition are shown in TableII. Among the monosaccharides tested, only d-galactose, its derivatives, andd-galactose-related carbohydrates (i.e. d-fucose and l-arabinose) were inhibitory, whereas epimers of d-galactose (i.e. d-talose (C-2 epimer), d-gulose (C-3 epimer), and d-glucose (C-4 epimer)) were all noninhibitory up to 100 mm. However, the most striking observation was that both Neu5Acα2, 6Galβ1,4Glc (6′-sialyllactose) and Neu5Acα2,6Galβ1,4GlcNAc (6′-sialylLacNAc), but not their α2,3 isomers, were very strong inhibitors, being 2000-fold more inhibitory than d-galactose and 250–300 times stronger than lactose and LacNAc. Neither free N-acetylneuraminic acid, its p-nitrophenyl glycoside, nor its α2,8-linked polymer (colominic acid) was inhibitory.Table IIInhibition of precipitation of P. squamosus agglutinin with α2-macroglobulin by oligosaccharidesSugaraN-Acetyl-glucosamine,d-arabinose, 2-deoxy-ribose, l-fucose,d-mannose, l- and d-rhamnose,l- and d-ribose, l- andd-xylose, cellobiose, chitobiose, gentiobiose, maltose, isomaltose, sucrose and trehalose were all noninhibitory up to 200 mm (cellobiose to saturation).IC50bMinimum concentration required for 50% inhibition of the PSA/α2-macroglobulin precipitation reaction, unless otherwise noted.Relative potencymmGalactose30[1]GalαMe450.67GalβMe152.0p-nitrophenyl α-d-galactoside142.1p-nitrophenyl β-d-galactoside5.35.7d-Fucose400.752-Deoxy galactose640.47GalNAc100 (3.4%)cMaximum concentration tested (percentage of inhibition observed).<0.3l-Arabinose100 (15%)<0.3Me-β-l-arabinopyranoside100 (16%)<0.36-OMe-d-Gal330.9d-Talose (C-2 epimer)100 (0%)0d-Glucose (C-3 epimer)100 (0%)0d-Glucose (C-4 epimer)100 (0%)0Lactose4.07.5LacNAc4.37.0p-nitrophenyl β-lactoside3.58.6Galβ1,4GlcNAcβMe3.87.9Galβ1,3GlcNAcβMe6.05.0T disaccharide (Galβ1,3GalNAc)6.24.8Galβ1,6Gal4.86.3Galβ1,4Gal10 (15%)<3.0Galβ1,4Man5.06.0Galβ1,3Ara9.03.3Galβ1,4Fru (Lactulose)7.04.3Galβ1,4GlcOH (Lactitol)191.6Lactobionic acid (Galβ1,4GlcCOOH)850.35Galα1,4Gal40 (13%)<0.75Melibiose (Galα1,6Glc)800.38Raffinose (Galα1,6Glcα1,2Fru)740.41Galacturonic Acid100 (10%)<0.3Gal-6-SO317.51.7Gal-6-PO4100 (13.5%)<0.3NeuAcα2,6Lactose0.0161875NeuAcα2,6LacNAc0.0142143NeuAcα2,3Lactose0.1 (0%)≪300NeuAcα2,3LacNAc1.75 (0%)≪17N-acetylneuraminic acid200 (0%)0p-nitrophenyl-α-sialoside10 (0%)≪3Colominic acid1 mg/ml(0%)a N-Acetyl-glucosamine,d-arabinose, 2-deoxy-ribose, l-fucose,d-mannose, l- and d-rhamnose,l- and d-ribose, l- andd-xylose, cellobiose, chitobiose, gentiobiose, maltose, isomaltose, sucrose and trehalose were all noninhibitory up to 200 mm (cellobiose to saturation).b Minimum concentration required for 50% inhibition of the PSA/α2-macroglobulin precipitation reaction, unless otherwise noted.c Maximum concentration tested (percentage of inhibition observed). Open table in a new tab A panel of neutral glycosphingolipids and gangliosides with well defined carbohydrate structures (Table III) was also used to investigate the binding specificity of purified PSA. The chromatograms are shown in Fig. 3. Of the neutral glycosphingolipids tested, only lactosylceramide was bound by the lectin. This result is in good agreement with the results obtained by precipitation inhibition assays, in which lactose is a fairly good inhibitor of the PSA/α2-macroglobulin precipitation reaction, but oligosaccharides similar to those found in the other neutral glycolipids were not inhibitory. On the other hand, all gangliosides tested failed to react with the lectin. It is especially noteworthy that GM3, which contains the lactosylceramide moiety but is substituted by α2,3-linked Neu5Ac at the β-linked galactosyl residue, also failed to react with the lectin, further confirming that this lectin is exclusively specific for α2,6-linked Neu5Ac.Table IIIThe carbohydrate structures of neutral and acidic glycosphingolipidsName (trivial name)Carbohydrate structureNeutral glycosphingolipids Lactosyl ceramide (Lac-cer, CDH)Galβ1,4Glcβ1,1Cer Globotriosyl ceramide (Gb3, Ceramide trihexoside, CTH)Galα1,4Galβ1,4Glcβ1,1Cer Globotetraosyl ceramide (Globoside, Gb4)GalNAcβ1,3Galα1,4Galβ1,4Glcβ1,1Cer Globopentaosyl ceramide (Forssman glycolipid, Gb5)GalNAcα1,3GalNAcβ1,3Galα1,4Galβ1,4Glcβ1,1CerGangliosides (acidic glycosphingolipids) MonosialogangliosidesGM3Neu5Acα2,3Galβ1,4Glcβ1,1CerGM2GalNAcβ1,4(Neu5Acα2,3)Galβ1,4Glcβ1,1CerGM1Galβ1,3GalNAcβ1,4(Neu5Acα2,3)Galβ1,4Glcβ1,1Cer DisialogangliosidesGD3Neu5Acα2,8Neu5Acα2,3Galβ1,4Glcβ1,1CerGD1aNeu5Acα2,3Galβ1,3GalNAcβ1,4(Neu5Acα2,3)Galβ1,4Glcβ1,1CerGD1bGalβ1,3GalNAcβ1,4(Neu5Acα2,8Neu5Acα2,3)Galβ1,4Glcβ1,1Cer Open table in a new tab Changes in absorbance or fluorescence spectra were examined as probes for binding studies. It had been observed that p-nitrophenyl α-d-mannoside, upon binding to the mannose/glucose-specific lectin concanavalin A, undergoes a small but definite spectral change with a maximum decrease in absorbance at 317 nm, apparently due to interaction of an aromatic residue with the chromophore (21.Hassing G.S. Goldstein I.J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1970; 16: 549-556Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Accordingly, we looked for such a spectral change with both pNPβGal and pNPβLac upon reaction with PSA, but none was observed (data not shown). Another indication of the interaction of an aromatic aglycon with residues in the lectin is the complete quenching of fluorescence of methylumbelliferyl α-d-mannoside (excitation at 320 nm, emission peak at 375 nm) upon binding to concanavalin A (22.Dean B.R. Homer R.B. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1973; 322: 141-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Again, however, fluorescence of methylumbelliferyl β-d-galactoside was unaffected by titration with PSA, suggesting that an aromatic residue of the protein is not in a position near the binding site to interact with the chromophore or fluorophore of these β-galactosides. We also examined the effects of ligands on the intrinsic fluorescence of tryptophanyl residues of the protein, as measured by excitation at 280 nm and emission at 300–400 nm. Free monosaccharides, free oligosaccharides, or methyl glycosides had no effect on the intrinsic fluorescence peak at 340 nm. As expected because of its strong UV absorbance, all p-nitrophenyl glycosides quenched intrinsic fluorescence and caused a slight shift in the emission peak toward longer wavelengths. However, we observed that quenching bypNPβGal or pNPβLac was significantly greater than that caused by a nonreactive p-nitrophenyl glycoside, such as p-nitrophenyl α-d-mannoside, at the same concentration. Furthermore, addition of competing oligosaccharides, such as lactose or LacNAc, reversed this additional quenching in a saturable manner, indicating that it is caused by thep-nitrophenyl β-galactosides binding in the vicinity of a fluorophoric group on the lectin. We thus refer to this phenomenon as “specific quenching.” Thus, intrinsic fluorescence titration of oligosaccharide ligands in the presence of a fixed amount of pNPβGal yielded apparent inhibition constants (IC50 values) for the titrant from a plot of 1/ΔF versus 1/[L], where ΔF is the increase in peak fluorescence caused by the titrant at a concentration of [L], in a manner analogous to Lineweaver-Burk plots. The ordinate intercept gives the reciprocal of the maximum fluorescence change ΔF max (in arbitrary fluorescence units), which is a function of concentration and binding affinity of the quenching probe. TableIV summarizes data for several oligosaccharides and chromophoric probes. At a lectin concentration of 0.09 mg/ml (3.2 μm in monomers) and pNPβGal of 100 μm, the maximum fluorescence chan"

However, a phospholamban Asn27 → Ala (N27A) mutant, which maintained a normal pentamer to monomer ratio, was shown to act as a superinhibitor of SERCA2a Ca2+ affinity. To determine whether the pentameric N27A mutant is superinhibitory in vivo, transgenic mice with cardiac-specific overexpression of mutant phospholamban were generated. Quantitative immunoblotting revealed a 61 ± 6% increase in total phospholamban in mutant hearts, with 90% of the overexpressed protein being pentameric. The EC50 value for Ca2+ dependence of Ca2+ uptake was 0.69 ± 0.07 μm in mutant hearts, compared with 0.29 ± 0.02 μm in wild-type hearts or 0.43 ± 0.03 μm in hearts overexpressing wild-type PLB by 2-fold. Myocytes from phospholamban N27A mutant hearts also exhibited more depressed contractile parameters than wild-type phospholamban overexpressing cells. The shortening fraction was 52%, rates of shortening and relengthening were 46% and 38% respectively, and time for 80% decay of the Ca2+ signal was 146%, compared with wild-types (100%).

Furthermore, in vivo echocardiography showed a depression in the ratio of early to late diastolic transmitral velocity and a 79% prolongation of the isovolumic relaxation time.

The regulatory role of PLB in basal cardiac contractility and its effects in mediating β-adrenergic stimulation were elucidated by the generation and characterization of a PLB null mouse (5.Luo W. Grupp I.L. Harrer J. Ponniah S. Grupp G. Duffy J.J. Doetschman T. Kranias E.G. Circ. Res. 1994; 75: 401-409Crossref PubMed Scopus (630) Google Scholar). Ablation of PLB was associated with a significant increase in the affinity of SERCA2a for Ca2+, accelerated relaxation rates, and enhanced contractility in isolated myocytes, perfused hearts, and intact animals (5.Luo W.

Kranias E.G. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 272: H785-H790PubMed Google Scholar). The mechanism by which PLB mediates its regulatory effects in vivo is under active investigation. The 52 amino acids in PLB are proposed to form cytosolic domain IA, composed of amino acids 1–20, cytosolic domain IB, composed of amino acids 21–30, and transmembrane domain II, composed of amino acids 31–52 (9.Fujii J. Ueno A. Kitano K. Tanaka S. Kadoma M. Tada M. J. Clin. Invest. 1987; 79: 301-304Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). Based on in vitro reconstitution and expression studies, electrostatic and hydrophobic interactions between PLB cytoplasmic domain IA and SERCA2a play an important role in functional association and modulate the transmembrane inhibitory interactions (10.Toyofuku T. Kurzydlowski K. Tada M. MacLennan D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 3088-3094Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The hydrophobic transmembrane domain II is the inhibitory domain of PLB, which regulates the affinity of SERCA2a for Ca2+ (11.Sasaki T. Inui M. Kimura Y. Kuzuya T. Tada M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 1674-1679Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 12.Kimura Y. Kurzydlowski K. Tada M. MacLennan D.H. J. Biol.

Domain IB has been suggested to function in long range coupling between domains IA and II (12.Kimura Y. Kurzydlowski K. Tada M. MacLennan D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 21726-21731Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar), but recent studies have shown that this domain may also be involved in regulatory interactions between PLB and SERCA2a (13.Kimura Y.

Transmembrane interactions among PLB monomers favor pentamer formation in hydrophobic environments, as revealed by PLB migration patterns in SDS-polyacrylamide gels (12.Kimura Y. Kurzydlowski K.

Kranias E.G. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 1994; 140: 185-193Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar), electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy (20.Cornea R.L. Jones L.R. Autry J.M. Thomas D.D.

Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 3954-3962Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Alanine-scanning mutagenesis of PLB, followed by co-expression of the mutant forms with SERCA2a, indicated that some monomeric mutants such as I40A (100% monomer) or L37A (94% monomer) were far more effective in decreasing the affinity of SERCA2a for Ca2+ than wild-type PLB (18.Kimura Y.

Chem. 1997; 272: 15872-15880Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). Thus, it was proposed that monomeric PLB is the active inhibitory form of the protein (18.Kimura Y. Kurzydlowski K. Tada M. MacLennan D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 15061-15064Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar, 22.Autry J.M. Jones L.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 15872-15880Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar) and that gain of inhibitory function for monomeric mutants is due to mass action effects of the increased content of monomeric PLB (18.Kimura Y. Kurzydlowski K. Tada M. MacLennan D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 15061-15064Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar). Further in vitro expression studies have shown that mutants N27A, Q29A, and N30A in PLB domain IB also gain inhibitory function (13.Kimura Y. Asahi M. Kurzydlowski K. Tada M. MacLennan D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 14238-14241Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). The N27A mutation is especially potent, diminishing the apparent Ca2+ affinity of SERCA2a by almost an order of magnitude, but containing only about 10% monomer (13.Kimura Y. Asahi M. Kurzydlowski K. Tada M. MacLennan D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 14238-14241Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). It was suggested that the N27A mutant gains function through a stronger affinity for the Ca2+ pump and diminished dissociation of the inhibited PLB/SERCA2a complex (13.Kimura Y. Asahi M. Kurzydlowski K. Tada M. MacLennan D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 14238-14241Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). To determine whether the pentameric N27A mutant PLB is also superinhibitory in vivo, and to evaluate the physiological effects of expressing such a highly inhibitory form of PLB, transgenic mice overexpressing the N27A mutant PLB were generated. The mutant PLB migrated primarily as pentamers on SDS-PAGE. Overexpression of relatively low levels (61%) of the mutant PLB was associated with superinhibition of SERCA2a Ca2+ affinity and contractile parameters at the subcellular, cellular, organ, and intact animal levels. Our results suggest that this pentameric PLB mutant is able to superinhibit SERCA2a Ca2+ affinity in vivo, and that PLB domain IB may play an important role in its regulatory function in vivo. Rabbit SERCA2a and PLB wild-type or N27A mutant cDNAs were prepared as described previously (13.Kimura Y. Asahi M. Kurzydlowski K. Tada M. MacLennan D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 14238-14241Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar), ligated into the PMT2 vector (23.Kaufman R.J. Davies M.V. Pathak V.K. Hershey J.W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 946-958Crossref PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar), and co-transfected (8 μg of each cDNA/dish) into the human embryonic kidney cell line 293 (HEK-293 cells) using the calcium phosphate precipitation method (24.Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. John Wiley & Sons, New York1990Google Scholar). Cells were harvested 48 h after transfection, and microsomes were prepared and assayed for Ca2+ transport activity as described previously (10.Toyofuku T. Kurzydlowski K. Tada M. MacLennan D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 3088-3094Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 12.Kimura Y. Kurzydlowski K. Tada M. MacLennan D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 21726-21731Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). Two-step PCR methodology was employed to introduce the PLB N27A mutation into mouse PLB cDNA (25.Bowman S. Tischfield J. Stambrook P. Technique J. Methods Cell Mol. Biol. 1990; 2: 254-260Google Scholar). The pIBI 31 vectors containing the fusion gene (α-MHCp-PLB cDNA-SV40 poly(A) signal), used previously to generate transgenic mice with cardiac-specific overexpression of wild-type or mutant PLB (26.Chu G. Dorn G.W., II Luo W. Harrer J.M. Kadambi V.J. Walsh R.A. Kranias E.G. Circ. Res. 1997; 81: 485-492Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 27.Kadambi V.J. Ponniah S. Harrer J.M. Hoit B.D. Dorn G.W., II Walsh R.A. Kranias E.G. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 97: 533-539Crossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar), was used as template. In the first round of PCR, the 5′ end PLB mutant primer with the site-directed PLB Asn27 (AAT) to Ala (GCT) mutation (ACG TCA G GC TCT CCA GAA C) and the 3′ end T7 primer were used to amplify a minor product harboring the PLB mutation. In the subsequent PCR, the minor product was used as template, with a 5′ end primer corresponding to part of the α-MHC 1 promoter (CAC ATA GAA GCC TAG CCC ACA C) and a 3′ end T7 primer. This resulted in amplification of a 0.9-kb final product containing the PLB cDNA with the N27A mutation and SV40 poly(A) signal. The 0.9-kb fragment was cleaved by SalI and ligated into the pIBI31 fusion gene vector, which had been digested with SalI to release the same 0.9-kb fragment containing the wild-type PLB cDNA. Therefore, the mutant PLB cDNA replaced the wild-type PLB cDNA. Positive colonies were identified byNotI and HindIII digestions and DNA sequencing. The complete 6.4-kb fragment of α-MHCp-PLB N27A mutant cDNA-SV40 poly(A) was released from the pIBI31 vector by KpnI andHindIII digestions. Pronuclear microinjection of fertilized eggs from FVB/N mice was performed by standard methods (27.Kadambi V.J. Ponniah S. Harrer J.M. Hoit B.D. Dorn G.W., II Walsh R.A. Kranias E.G. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 97: 533-539Crossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar). The transgenic mice were identified by PCR methodology and Southern blot analysis of genomic DNA isolated from tail biopsies, as described previously (26.Chu G. Dorn G.W., II Luo W. Harrer J.M. Kadambi V.J. Walsh R.A. Kranias E.G. Circ. Res. 1997; 81: 485-492Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 27.Kadambi V.J. Ponniah S. Harrer J.M. Hoit B.D. Dorn G.W., II Walsh R.A. Kranias E.G. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 97: 533-539Crossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar). The transgene expression was determined by Northern blot analysis of total cardiac RNA (28.Koss K.L. Ponniah S. Jones W.K. Grupp I.L. Kranias E.G. Circ. Res. 1995; 77: 342-353Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). All of the mice used were 10–12 weeks old. Protein levels were determined by quantitative immunoblotting (29.Chu G. Luo W. Slack J.P. Tilgmann C. Sweet W.E. Spindler M. Saupe K.W. Boivin G.P. Moravec C.S. Matlib M.A. Grupp I.L. Ingwall J.S. Kranias E.G. Circ. Res. 1996; 79: 1064-1076Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). For the quantitation of PLB and PLB phosphorylated at Ser16 or Thr17, the following primary antibodies were used: a mouse monoclonal antibody to PLB (no. MA3-922, Affinity Bioreagents Inc); and rabbit polyclonal antibodies to PLB phosphoserine peptide or PLB phosphothreonine peptide (no. 010-12/010-13, PhosphoProtein Research). Binding of primary antibody was detected by peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies and ECL detection reagents (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Oxalate-supported Ca2+ uptake in cardiac homogenates was measured by a modified Millipore filtration technique (5.Luo W. Grupp I.L. Harrer J. Ponniah S. Grupp G. Duffy J.J. Doetschman T. Kranias E.G. Circ. Res. 1994; 75: 401-409Crossref PubMed Scopus (630) Google Scholar). Mouse left ventricular myocytes were isolated as described previously (30.Chu G. Li L. Sato Y. Harrer J.M. Kadambi V.J.

Briefly, the hearts were perfused in a Langendorff mode using Tyrode buffer (pH 7.3), which contained a combination of collagenase I and II (Worthington, 0.5 mg/ml) at 37 °C. The isolated myocytes were perfused in 1.8 mmCa2+-Tyrode at room temperature and field-stimulated at 0.5 Hz. Cardiomyocyte mechanics and Ca2+ transients were measured as described previously (26.Chu G. Dorn G.W., II Luo W. Harrer J.M. Kadambi V.J. Walsh R.A. Kranias E.G. Circ. Res. 1997; 81: 485-492Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 30.Chu G. Li L. Sato Y. Harrer J.M. Kadambi V.J. Hoit B.D. Bers D.M. Kranias E.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 33674-33680Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Isolated cardiomyocytes were loaded with 4.5 μm Fura-2 AM for 20 min at room temperature. Fluorescence was measured, with excitation wavelength at 340 nm and 380 nm alternatively and emission wavelength at 510 nm. At least 3 cells/heart were chosen for replicate measurements, and each animal was considered as a single n. Data were analyzed by Felix computer software (Photon Technology International). The responses of the cardiomyocyte mechanics and Ca2+transients to isoproterenol stimulation were studied by suspending cardiomyocytes in 1.8 mm Ca2+-Tyrode and various concentrations of isoproterenol. Retrograde aortic Langendorff heart perfusions were performed as described previously (8.Kiss E. Edes I. Sato Y. Luo W. Liggett S.B. Kranias E.G. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 272: H785-H790PubMed Google Scholar, 30.Chu G. Li L. Sato Y. Harrer J.M. Kadambi V.J. Hoit B.D. Bers D.M. Kranias E.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 33674-33680Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Briefly, the hearts were perfused with modified Krebs-Henseleit buffer at 37 °C. The heart rate and left ventricular pressure were monitored continuously by a pressure transducer, which was hooked to a computerized heart performance analyzer (HPA-τ, MicroMed, Inc). In a separate set of experiments, the perfused hearts were paced with 10-V square pulse via platinum electrodes coupled to a Grass S4 stimulator. The electrodes were attached to the right ventricle via the pulmonary artery. Cardiac ultrasound studies were performed using an Interspec Apogee CX-200 ultrasonograph (Interspec-ATL, Ambler, PA), as described previously (7.Hoit B.D. Khoury S.F. Kranias E.G. Ball N. Walsh R.A. Circ. Res. 1995; 77: 632-637Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar). Mice were lightly anesthetized with 2.5% avertin (0.01 ml/g) and were allowed to breathe spontaneously. Two-dimensional targeted M-mode echocardiography (conducted through a 9-MHz annular array imaging transducer) and color flow-directed pulsed-wave Doppler (using a 5–7.5-MHz pulsed-wave Doppler transducer) were performed at base line and after the administration of isoproterenol (2.0 μg/g, intraperitoneally). Left ventricular dimensions, fractional shortening, velocity of circumferential shortening and mitral and aortic spectral Doppler waveforms were analyzed as reportedly previously (7.Hoit B.D. Khoury S.F. Kranias E.G. Ball N. Walsh R.A. Circ. Res. 1995; 77: 632-637Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar). Data are presented as mean ± S.E. The number n indicates the number of mice unless otherwise stated. Statistical analysis was performed by one-way or two-way analysis of variance, followed by Student-Newman-Keuls' test for multiple comparisons. Values of p < 0.05 were considered as statistically significant. The N27A mutant PLB cDNA or wild-type PLB cDNA was coexpressed with SERCA2a in HEK-293 cells, and Ca2+ uptake assays were performed using microsomal fractions isolated from transfected cells. Wild-type PLB diminished the apparent affinity of SERCA2a for Ca2+, and shifted the K Ca (expressed in pCa units) to the right from 6.56 ± 0.01 to 6.23 ± 0.04. Mutant PLB further inhibited the affinity of SERCA2a for Ca2+compared with wild-type PLB (K Ca: 5.54 ± 0.41) and functioned as a superinhibitor in vitro (Fig.1). To determine whether the N27A mutant PLB can superinhibit SERCA2a Ca2+ affinity and cardiac contractility in vivo, transgenic mice were generated by pronuclear microinjection of the mouse PLB cDNA harboring the mutation N27A (AAT to GCT). Cardiac-specific expression of the N27A mutant PLB was driven using the α-MHC promoter (31.Subramaniam A. Jones W.K. Gulick J. Wert S. Neumann J. Robbins J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 24613-24620Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Northern blot analysis indicated transgene expression in two lines (lines 29 and 91) (data not shown). The protein expression levels of mutant PLB were assessed by quantitative immunoblots of cardiac homogenates. Transgenic line 29 hearts expressed 161 ± 6% of the PLB levels present in wild-type hearts (100 ± 9%) (Fig.2 A). There was a similar ratio of PLB pentamers to monomers (90.5%) compared with wild-types (90.8%) (Fig. 2 A). PLB in the transgenic hearts could be dissociated into monomers upon boiling prior to SDS-PAGE, similar to wild-type hearts. There were no significant changes in the SERCA2a protein levels in the transgenic hearts (Fig. 2 B). When the apparent PLB/SERCA2a ratio was calculated, it was found to be 1.51 ± 0.25 in transgenic hearts compared with 1.00 ± 0.20 in wild-type hearts (Fig. 2 C). Line 91 expressed 140 ± 12% of the PLB levels present in wild-type hearts and the apparent PLB/SERCA ratio was 1.24 ± 0.10. To examine whether the overexpressed mutant PLB interacts functionally with SERCA2a in SR vesicles, the initial rates of ATP-dependent, oxalate-facilitated SR Ca2+ uptake were measured in heart homogenates. There were no significant differences in the maximal rates of SR Ca2+ uptake between wild-types and transgenics. The EC50 value for Ca2+ dependence of Ca2+ uptake in transgenic hearts overexpressing mutant PLB was significantly higher (0.69 ± 0.07 μm), compared with wild-type hearts (0.29 ± 0.02 μm) (Fig.3). Hearts overexpressing wild-type PLB by 2-fold were also assayed in parallel, and the EC50 value for Ca2+ dependence of Ca2+ uptake was 0.43 ± 0.03 μm, consistent with our previous findings (27.Kadambi V.J. Ponniah S. Harrer J.M. Hoit B.D. Dorn G.W., II Walsh R.A. Kranias E.G. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 97: 533-539Crossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar). Thus, the inhibition of the apparent Ca2+affinity of SR Ca2+ uptake was much higher in hearts overexpressing mutant PLB by 1.6-fold than those overexpressing wild-type PLB by 2-fold. A supershift in the apparent Ca2+affinity of SR Ca2+ uptake was also obtained in line 91 (EC50: 0.53 ± 0.03 μm;n = 3), which expressed lower level of mutant PLB than line 29. Line 29 was then propagated for further characterization studies. Overexpression of wild-type PLB has been shown to result in significant depression of cardiomyocyte function (27.Kadambi V.J. Ponniah S. Harrer J.M. Hoit B.D. Dorn G.W., II Walsh R.A. Kranias E.G. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 97: 533-539Crossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar). To determine whether the superinhibitory effect of the mutant PLB on SERCA2a Ca2+ affinity would be associated with superinhibition of cardiomyocyte mechanics and Ca2+transients, left ventricular myocytes were isolated from wild-type and transgenic mice, as well as from mice overexpressing wild-type PLB by 2-fold. The shortening fraction appeared to be more depressed in transgenic myocytes overexpressing N27A mutant PLB (52%) than in myocytes overexpressing wild-type PLB (68%), compared with wild-type controls (100%) (p = 0.067). The maximal velocities of cardiomyocyte shortening and relengthening were also more depressed in transgenic myocytes overexpressing mutant PLB (+dL/dt: 46%; −dL/dt: 38%) than in transgenic cells overexpressing wild-type PLB (+dL/dt: 64%; −dL/dt: 64%) compared with controls (100%) (Fig.4). To determine whether the observed alterations in myocyte mechanics reflected alterations in Ca2+ handling, cardiomyocytes were loaded with 4.5 μm Fura-2 AM. The base-line Ca2+ signals and peak amplitudes were not different among all three groups. However, the time to 80% decay of the Ca2+ signal (T80) was prolonged by 46% in transgenic cardiomyocytes overexpressing mutant PLB and by 27% in transgenic cardiomyocytes overexpressing wild-type PLB, compared with controls (Fig. 5). The depressed mechanical and Ca2+ kinetic parameters in transgenic cardiomyocytes overexpressing mutant PLB by 1.6-fold were significantly different from those in transgenic cardiomyocytes overexpressing wild-type PLB by 2-fold.Figure 5Ca2+ transients of isolated cardiomyocytes at base line and under isoproterenol stimulation.Isolated cardiomyocytes from wild-type hearts (WT,n = 5) and transgenic hearts overexpressing either mutant PLB (MU, n = 5) or wild-type PLB (2xWT, n = 4) were loaded with 4.5 μm Fura2-AM for 20 min at room temperature, and subsequently paced at 0.5 Hz. The effects of 100 nmisoproterenol were also obtained (Iso, +). A, peak amplitude (340 nm/380 nm ratio);B, time to 80% decay of the Ca2+ signal (T80). Values are mean ± S.E.

To determine whether the superinhibitory effects of mutant PLB could be relieved by β-agonists, cardiac myocytes were superfused with sequential concentrations of isoproterenol and their mechanical responses were assessed. Maximal stimulation of these parameters was obtained at 100 nm isoproterenol, and the degree of stimulation relative to non-stimulated values in each group was similar. Administration of isoproterenol (100 nm) resulted in complete reversal of the inhibitory effects in cardiomyocytes overexpressing wild-type PLB (Figs. 4 and 5), consistent with our previous findings (27.Kadambi V.J. Ponniah S. Harrer J.M. Hoit B.D. Dorn G.W., II Walsh R.A. Kranias E.G. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 97: 533-539Crossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar). However, in transgenic cardiomyocytes overexpressing N27A mutant PLB, the maximally stimulated mechanical and Ca2+ kinetic parameters remained depressed (+dL/dt: 62%; −dL/dt: 60%; T80: 133%), compared with the maximally stimulated values in controls (100%) (Figs. 4 and 5). The alterations observed at the cardiomyocyte level prompted further examination of the effects of mutant PLB overexpression at the organ level. Thus, hearts from transgenic mice were perfused in parallel with wild-type controls, using the Langendorff mode (Table I). The heart rate was depressed, and the end diastolic pressure was higher in transgenic hearts. The maximal rates of left ventricular pressure development and decline were depressed (+dP/dt: 59%; −dP/dt: 64%), and the times to peak pressure (TTP) and half relaxation (RT1/2) were prolonged (TTP: 162%; RT1/2: 148%) in transgenic hearts compared with controls (100%). These data suggested that the N27A mutant PLB transgenic hearts exhibited depressed systolic and diastolic function.Table IContractile parameters of Langendorff perfused hearts from transgenic mice and wild-type littermates at base line and at pacing rates of 480 bpmUnpacedPacedWTMUWTMUn7645HR (beats/min)471 ± 18305 ± 31*484 ± 2483 ± 1LVSP (mmHg)61.3 ± 1.162.9 ± 1.364.1 ± 2.060.7 ± 0.8EDP (mmHg)4.0 ± 0.57.0 ± 1.0*4.5 ± 0.410.8 ± 1.1**+dP/dt (mmHg/s)3642 ± 862136 ± 139*4054 ± 1472729 ± 139**−dP/dt(mmHg/s)2567 ± 841635 ± 120*2817 ± 121814 ± 182**TTP (ms)30.1 ± 1.048.7 ± 3.4*31.1 ± 2.039.2 ± 1.3**RT1/2 (ms)19.5 ± 0.328.8 ± 1.2*20.8 ± 1.327.8 ± 2.0**Wild-type (WT) and transgenic hearts overexpressing mutant PLB (MU) were perfused without pacing (unpaced) or upon ventricular pacing at 480 bpm (paced), which was similar to the intrinsic heart rate of wild-types.

Nonetheless, the information on the caspase family has been limited to mammals, Drosophila, and nematodes. To examine the structure and characterization of the Xenopus caspase family, we have cloned the cDNAs encoding caspase-2 and -6–10 in addition to caspase-1 and -3, which we characterized previously (Yaoita, Y., and Nakajima, K. (1997) J. Biol. Chem.272, 5122–5127). First, the existence of these caspases in frog suggests that the caspase cascades clarified in mammals are conserved at least from Amphibia. Interestingly, Xenopus caspase-1, -8, and -10 (especially caspase-8) showed a lower degree of identity to human equivalents than the other caspases. Second, mRNAs of many caspases increased during the climax of metamorphosis in regressing organs, tail, and intestine, where programmed cell death occurs, but not in apoptotic tail-derived cultured cells (XLT-15-11) treated with thyroid hormone, showing that new RNA synthesis of caspases is dispensable to programmed cell death. Third, comparison of human andXenopus caspase sequences implies that some proposed regulations of human caspases are not conserved in frog.

Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1991: 47-60Google Scholar). One of the classical examples is resorption of the anuran tail during metamorphosis, which is triggered by a surge of thyroid hormone and coincides with the up-regulation of thyroid hormone receptors (4.Yaoita Y. Shi Y.B. Brown D.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 7090-7094Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar, 5.Yaoita Y. Brown D.D. Genes Dev. 1990; 4: 1917-1924Crossref PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar). The tadpole tail, which is twice as long as the body, disappears completely in several days with characteristic features of apoptosis such as nuclear chromatin condensation and cytoplasmic blebs (6.Kerr J.F. Harmon B. Searle J. J. Cell Sci. 1974; 14: 571-585Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Apoptosis is also observed when a myoblastic cell line (XLT-15) derived from Xenopus tadpole tail undergoes death after treatment with thyroid hormone (1.Yaoita Y. Nakajima K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 5122-5127Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Gills and larval intestinal epithelial cells also degenerate during metamorphosis (7.Dodd M.H.I. Dodd J.M. Lofts B. Physiology of the Amphibia. III. Academic Press, New York1976: 467-599Crossref Google Scholar). A large body of evidence supports the idea that apoptosis is mediated by the sequential and coordinated activation of several caspases (cysteine/aspartic acid-specific proteases), which cleave key substrates after aspartic acid residues (8.Yuan J. Shaham S. Ledoux S. Ellis H.M. Horvitz H.R. Cell. 1993; 75: 641-652Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2257) Google Scholar, 9.Li P. Nijhawan D. Budihardjo I. Srinivasula S.M. Ahmad M. Alnemri E.S.

Cell. 1997; 88: 355-365Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4561) Google Scholar). Over 12 human caspases that share similarities in sequence and activity have been identified. Caspases are synthesized as inactive zymogens composed of a prodomain and large and small subunits. There are two well characterized pathways of apoptosis: the process triggered by the interaction between the Fas receptor and its ligand (11.Nagata S. Curr. Biol. 1996; 6: 1241-1243Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar) and cell death starting from the release of cytochromec from mitochondria into the cytoplasm (9.Li P. Nijhawan D. Budihardjo I. Srinivasula S.M. Ahmad M. Alnemri E.S. Wang X. Cell. 1997; 91: 479-489Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (6261) Google Scholar). Upon binding of the Fas ligand to the receptor, oligomers are formed that bring together in close vicinity the intracellular C-terminal death domains, to which the death domain of FADD (Fas-associated protein with death domain) binds through protein-protein interaction. Then, procaspase-8 associates with the receptor-FADD complex by interaction between the death effector domains of FADD and procaspase-8, resulting in the cleavage and activation of caspase-8. Active caspase-8 released from the complex causes the sequential activation of the downstream caspases, including caspase-3, -6, and -7, culminating in apoptotic cell death. In the second pathway, various stimuli of cell death induce the release of cytochrome c from mitochondria; the cytochromec binds to a cytosolic protein, Apaf-1. This Apaf-1-cytochrome c complex self-associates through its CED-4 homology domain (12.Srinivasula S.M. Ahmad M. Fernandes Alnemri T. Alnemri E.S. Mol. Cell. 1998; 1: 949-957Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (969) Google Scholar) and binds to procaspase-9 by the interaction of caspase recruitment domains, resulting in transactivation of caspase-9. The activated caspase-9 initiates the caspase cascade (9.Li P. Nijhawan D. Budihardjo I. Srinivasula S.M. Ahmad M. Alnemri E.S. Wang X. Cell. 1997; 91: 479-489Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (6261) Google Scholar). Although the caspase family appears to play a pivotal role in programmed cell death beyond species, the information on caspases has been limited to mammals (human and mouse), Drosophila, andCaenorhabditis elegans and to few reports on chicken (13.Johnson A.L. Bridgham J.T. Bergeron L. Yuan J. Gene (Amst.). 1997; 192: 227-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar) and Xenopus (1.Yaoita Y. Nakajima K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 5122-5127Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar) caspases. In this paper, we report the comprehensive study of the structure, expression, cytotoxic activity, and activation of the Xenopus laevis caspase family members. A directionally oriented cDNA library of stage 62 tadpole tail was constructed using the Directional Cloning Toolbox and the Time Saver cDNA synthesis kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) with the ZAP Express vector (Stratagene) according to the manufacturer's instructions. A 2-μg aliquot DNA from this cDNA library containing ∼106 plaque-forming units was used as a substrate for polymerase chain reaction (PCR)1 amplification as described (14.Fernandes Alnemri T. Litwack G. Alnemri E.S. Cancer. Res. 1995; 55: 2737-2742PubMed Google Scholar) with some modifications. The primary amplification (30 cycles: 94 °C for 40 s, 50 °C for 1 min, and 72 °C for 2 min) was performed with T3 vector-specific primer (Stratagene) and a degenerative primer ((G/T)C(G/A)CAIA(G/A/C)IG(A/T/C)(T/C)TG(G/A/T)AT(G/ A)AACCA) complementary to the peptide WFIQ(A/S)(L/V)C(A/E). A 1-μl aliquot of the primary amplification product was used as a substrate for a secondary amplification under the same conditions as the previous reaction except for 55 °C annealing with the two nested primers: a second vector-specific primer (GCAGGTCGACACTAGTGG) located in polylinker sequence and primer X (CCIC(G/T)(G/A)CAIGC(T/C)TGIATIA(A/T)(G/A)AA(G/A/T/C)AI(T/C)TT(G/A/T/C)GG(T/C)TT), complementary to peptide KPK(I/L)F(F/I)IQACRG. The secondary PCR products were ligated to the pGEM-T vector (Promega). Screening by DNA sequencing of 20 clones resulted in the identification of partial cDNAs of Xenopus caspase-6, -7, and -10. A Xenopus caspase-9 DNA fragment was amplified by PCR using the genomic DNA of X. laevis as a template, primer X, and primer Y (TI(G/T)(G/T)I(G/T)(G/T)IAT(A/T/C)(T/C)TI(A/T)(G/C)ICA(T/C)GG), encoding the sequence (I/V)(C/V)(C/V)IL(S/T)HG, which is conserved inXenopus caspase-10 and human caspase-8 and -9. Similarly, aXenopus caspase-8 DNA fragment was prepared by PCR amplification performed using the genomic DNA, primer Y, and the 3′-primer (CC(T/C)TG(G/A)CAIGC(T/C)TGIAT(G/A)AA(G/A)AAIAI(T/C)TTIGG(T/C)TT), complementary to peptide KPK(L/V)FFIQACQG. A Xenopuscaspase-2 cDNA fragment was amplified from cDNA of stage 62 tadpole tail using the 5′-primer (CA(G/A)AA(T/C)AA(G/A)CC(G/A/T/C)AA(G/A)ATGTT(T/C)TT(T/C)AT(A/T/C)CA) and the 3′-primer (TG(G/A)AA(T/C)TCIGTICCIGGIGC(G/A)TAICC(T/C)TC), which encode peptides QNKPKMFFIQ and EGYAPGTEFH, respectively. These PCR products were cloned, sequenced, and identified asXenopus caspase-9, -8, and -2 genes. Using these DNA fragments as probes, cDNA libraries of stage 58 total tadpole (4.Yaoita Y. Shi Y.B. Brown D.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 7090-7094Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar) and stage 62 tadpole tail were screened. 2.3-kb (Xenopus caspase-2), 2.6-kb (Xenopus caspase-6), 1.6-kb (Xenopus caspase-7), 2.0-kb (Xenopuscaspase-8), 2.0-kb (Xenopus caspase-9), and 2.2-kb (Xenopus caspase-10) cDNA fragments were obtained and characterized by nucleotide sequencing. Xenopus caspase-2, -6, -8, and -10 had an in-frame stop codon upstream of the initiator methionine. The 5′-fragment of Xenopus caspase-9 cDNA was obtained by the anchor PCR method (15.Frohman M.A. Dush M.K. Martin G.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 8998-9002Crossref PubMed Scopus (4341) Google Scholar) using a anchor primer (GTCGACATCGATCTCGAG(T)18), a 5′-reverse transcription primer (ACTGGGGCATTTGGAACC), and a 5′-amplification primer (CTCACGATTCTCTCTACGG) and was ligated to the 3′-partial cDNA through the common EcoRI site to construct the full-lengthXenopus caspase-9 cDNA (see Fig. 1 E). There was no size difference between PCR products from cDNA of tadpole tail and from the full-length Xenopus caspase-9 cDNA using primers located in the 5′- and 3′-untranslated regions (CTCGAGATGGAGCAGGAA and ATCCCAAACCGAATCCTGG, respectively). The predicted amino acid sequence of the Xenopus caspase-8 cDNA clone in the phage cDNA library contains QAFQG instead of the pentapeptide QACQG observed in human caspase-8. The fragments ofXenopus caspase-8 cDNA were amplified by PCR from nine pools of phage obtained as positive clones after the first screening of cDNA libraries using caspase-8 primers (GGCTGTGACGGAGAAGAG and GGTCTTGATTTGTGTAAGTTG), which are located ∼300 base pairs away on both sides of the pentapeptide-encoding region. Their sequence determination revealed that PCR products from six of nine pools encoded QAFQG and that those from the other pools dictated QACQG, although the PCR fragment amplified from stage 62 tail cDNA using caspase-8 primers contained only nucleotide sequence encoding QACQG. However, we could not isolate any phage clone carrying cDNA encoding QACQG. The full-length construct ofXenopus caspase-8 was obtained by PCR amplification from cDNA of stage 62 tail using primers GGGAATTCGCAACATGAGTGACCTG and GGATGCATGGTTACATGGCATTAGGA, which contain the initiation and termination codons, respectively, of the Xenopus caspase-8 cDNA phage clone encoding QAFQG. Total RNA was extracted from cells and tadpole organs using guanidinium thiocyanate (16.Chirgwin J.M. Przybyla A.E. MacDonald R.J. Rutter W.J. Biochemistry. 1979; 18: 5294-5299Crossref PubMed Scopus (16652) Google Scholar), purified by cesium chloride centrifugation, electrophoresed, blotted, and hybridized as described (5.Yaoita Y. Brown D.D. Genes Dev. 1990; 4: 1917-1924Crossref PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar). The Xenopus elongation factor-1α cDNA (a gift from Dr. P. A. Krieg) (17.Krieg P.A. Varnum S.M. Wormington W.M. Melton D.A. Dev. Biol. 1989; 133: 93-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (342) Google Scholar) was also used as a probe to standardize the amount of RNA. All Xenopus caspase cDNAs were cloned into the expression vector pcDNA1/Amp (Invitrogen) under the cytomegalovirus immediate-early promoter. The cell lines used were XLT-15 (1.Yaoita Y. Nakajima K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 5122-5127Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar) and its subline XLT-15-11, which has a shorter doubling time and expresses transfected DNA 10 times more efficiently than the parental cell line. The ratios of the normal nucleus number to the control were similar (∼60%) in both XLT-15 and XLT-15-11 cells treated with 10 nm T3 at 25 °C for 3 days. 2K. Nakajima and Y. Yaoita, unpublished data. The cells were maintained in 67% L-15 medium supplemented with 10% thyroid hormone-depleted fetal calf serum (18.Samuels H.H. Stanley F. Casanova J. Endocrinology. 1979; 105: 80-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (557) Google Scholar) at 20 °C. Cells were allowed to grow to 20–30% confluence before transfection. For GFP assay, 0.1 μg of GFP expression vector pEGFP-N2 (CLONTECH) as a marker gene with 0.8 μg of pcDNA1/Amp or one of theXenopus caspase gene expression constructs was cotransfected into XLT-15-11 cells in a Primaria 6-cm culture dish (Becton Dickinson) using 3 μl of FuGENE-6 transfection reagent (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) according to the instructions of the manufacturer, and transfected cells were cultured at 25 °C. Two days after transfection, apoptotic cells were identified by visual inspection of GFP-positive cells with a Zeiss Axiovert 135 TV inverted fluorescence microscope (19.Sánchez I. Xu C.J. Juo P. Kakizaka A. Blenis J. Yuan J. Neuron. 1999; 22: 623-633Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (373) Google Scholar). The same experiment was performed several times, with >200 cells counted for each determination. Affinity labeling was performed as described previously (20.Yamashita K. Takahashi A. Kobayashi S. Hirata H. Mesner Jr., P.W. Kaufmann S.H. Yonehara S. Yamamoto K. Uchiyama T. Sasada M. Blood. 1999; 93: 674-685Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To investigate whether Amphibia shares the same set of caspases with human, we have clonedXenopus caspase genes by PCR using DNA primers designed from conserved amino acid sequences. Comparisons of Xenopus and human caspases are shown in Figs. 1 and2. The active-site motif pentapeptide QACXG (where X is R, Q, or G) is shared in all human and Xenopus caspases. All known aspartic acid residues adjacent to the cleavage sites are conserved, except two sites that are located between the prodomains and catalytic protease domains in caspase-1 and -8. Almost all cleavage sites contain an acidic amino acid (aspartic or glutamic acid) at the P4 or P3 position. Although two processing sites located between the large and small subunits of caspase-9 are conserved, the sequence (P2–P4 amino acids) adjacent to the upstream site is completely different in the two species. Since this site is cut by procaspase-9 in the presence of Apaf-1 (12.Srinivasula S.M. Ahmad M. Fernandes Alnemri T. Alnemri E.S. Mol. Cell. 1998; 1: 949-957Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (969) Google Scholar), its recognition sequence might be divergent from those of conventional caspases. Xenopus caspase-9 contains the same four amino acids (Fig. 1 E, closed diamonds) in the caspase recruitment domain as human caspase-9, where mutations inactivate or reduce the interface interaction with Apaf-1 (21.Qin H. Srinivasula S.M. Wu G. Fernandes Alnemri T. Alnemri E.S. Shi Y. Nature. 1999; 399: 549-557Crossref PubMed Scopus (362) Google Scholar), implying the existence of the same interaction with an as yet unidentified frog Apaf-1. The amino acid identities in prodomains and catalytic protease domains between Xenopus and human caspases are summarized in TableI. The catalytic protease domains of caspase-2, -3, -6, -7, and -9 share >57% identity betweenXenopus and human, whereas those of caspase-1, -8, and -10 have <50% identity. Moreover, only three and four of nine amino acids adjacent to substrate P2–P4 amino acids are conserved betweenXenopus and human in caspase-8 and -10, respectively, whereas in the other caspases, more than six amino acids are identical (Fig. 1). These data indicate that both caspase-8 and -10 are more divergent between amphibians and mammals than the other caspases.Table ISummary of amino acid sequence identities between Xenopus and human caspasesComparison between:XCaXC, Xenopus caspase; hC, human caspase; CPD, catalytic protease domain.-1/hC-1XC-2/hC-2XC-3/hC-3XC-6/hC-6XC-7/hC-7XC-8/hC-8XC-8/hC-10XC-9/hC-9XC-10/hC-10XC-10/hC-8Prodomain34.146.222.928.629.037.233.754.842.732.8CPD46.864.557.965.766.235.634.858.148.239.2The numbers represent the percentage of identity of the sequences compared in a prodomain and a catalytic protease domain.a XC, Xenopus caspase; hC, human caspase; CPD, catalytic protease domain. Open table in a new tab The numbers represent the percentage of identity of the sequences compared in a prodomain and a catalytic protease domain. The reasons for the identification of Xenopus caspase-8 and -10 are as follows. 1) Xenopus caspase-10 shows the highest identity to human caspase-10. 2) Only caspase-10 among the human caspases contains THG located 40 amino acid residues upstream of pentapeptide QACQG instead of SHG, of which S is one of the amino acids adjacent to the substrate P2–P4 amino acids; and Xenopuscaspase-10 also shares the same amino acid sequence. 3)Xenopus caspase-8 is more similar to human caspase-8 than it is to human caspase-10, although Xenopus caspase-10 is more homologous to human caspase-8 in the catalytic protease domain than isXenopus caspase-8. 4) Xenopus caspase-8 and human caspase-8 have two possible cleavage sites between the large and small subunits, but both Xenopus caspase-10 and human caspase-10 contain only one processing site. It is possible thatXenopus caspase-8 and -10 might be duplicated genes as a result of doubling chromosomes during evolution since X. laevis is allotetraploid. It seems unlikely because we have cloned two different caspase-1 and -2 cDNAs that share 79.5 and 85.6% identities, respectively,2 whereas Xenopuscaspase-8 and -10 show only 31% identity. However, we cannot completely exclude the possibility that Xenopus caspase-8 and -10 do not correspond to the human counterparts. It has been shown that metamorphosis transforms most, if not all, organs and tissues in a tadpole especially after stage 58 (7.Dodd M.H.I. Dodd J.M. Lofts B. Physiology of the Amphibia. III. Academic Press, New York1976: 467-599Crossref Google Scholar) and that the stages at which maximal cell death is observed are different in different organs. The degeneration of tail muscle segments proceeds very rapidly after stage 63, and tail is resorbed completely until stage 66 (22.Nieuwkoop P.D. Faber J. Normal Tadpole of Xenopus laevis. North-Holland Publishing Co., Amsterdam1956Google Scholar), whereas the limbs differentiate and grow. In the intestine, the apoptotic degeneration of larval epithelial cells is most frequently observed at stages 59–61, and the proliferation of adult epithelial cells occurs in a predetermined order (23.Ishizuya Oka A. Shimozawa A. Anat. Anz. 1987; 164: 81-93PubMed Google Scholar, 24.Ishizuya Oka A. Shimozawa A. J. Morphol. 1992; 213: 185-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Although the central nervous system (brain and spinal cord) undergoes cell death of the mesencephalic fifth nucleus (the proprioceptors of the jaw musculature) at stage 62 (25.Kollros J.J. Thiesse M.L. J. Comp. Neurol. 1985; 233: 481-489Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar), no conspicuous change takes place except topographical changes during the climax of metamorphosis (22.Nieuwkoop P.D. Faber J. Normal Tadpole of Xenopus laevis. North-Holland Publishing Co., Amsterdam1956Google Scholar). Caspase mRNA expression was examined in these organs during metamorphosis and in T3-treated myoblast cell lines derived from tadpole tail (Fig. 3). As has been observed, caspase probes hybridized to transcripts of 2.0 kb (caspase-1), 2.5 kb (caspase-2), 3.7 and 1.6 kb (caspase-3), 2.2 kb (caspase-6), 1.5 kb (caspase-7), 2.5 kb and 3.0 kb (caspase-8), 2.7 kb (caspase-9), and 2.3 kb (caspase-10). Expression of all cloned caspases increased in the intestine. Expression of all caspases except caspase-9 and -10 increased in the tail, whereas caspase expression did not change in the hind limb or the central nervous system. Both XLT-15 and the subline XLT-15-11 expressed constant levels of caspase mRNAs despite T3 treatment, except for caspase-3 mRNA, which increased in T3-treated XLT-15 cells (1.Yaoita Y. Nakajima K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 5122-5127Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Although the expression of caspase-1 fluctuated during tail regression,2in general, it increased somewhat. Many reports have demonstrated that the elevated expression of a caspase by transfection of the gene into cultured cells induces apoptotic cell death (26.Miura M. Zhu H. Rotello R. Hartwieg E.A. Yuan J. Cell. 1993; 75: 653-660Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1332) Google Scholar, 27.Alnemri E.S. J. Cell. Biochem. 1997; 64: 33-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar). To compare the cytotoxic activity of caspases, Xenopuscaspase genes in expression vector were transfected into XLT-15-11 cells with a reporter gene (pEGFP-N2), and apoptotic cells were identified by the morphology of GFP-positive cells (Fig.4). The overexpression of caspases with a long prodomain (caspase-1, -2, -8, -9, and -10) caused greater cell death than that of caspases with a short prodomain (caspase-3, -6, and -7) (Fig. 5), as reported previously (28.Colussi P.A. Harvey N.L. Shearwin-Whyatt L.M. Kumar S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 26566-26570Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar).Figure 5Cell death-inducing activity by overexpression of Xenopus caspase in XLT-15-11 cultured cells. The GFP expression construct (pEGFP-N2) with a vector or one of the Xenopus caspase (xC) gene expression constructs was transiently transfected into XLT-15-11 cells as described in the legend to Fig. 4. The percentage of apoptotic round cells in GFP-expressing cells was determined 2 days after transfection. More than 200 cells were counted for each determination. Data are the means ± S.E.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To identify an activated caspase in the caspase-overexpressing cells, we used an affinity labeling method that enabled us to detect the large subunits of processed caspases without preparing antibodies againstXenopus caspases. If an caspase overexpressed by transfection of its gene is activated during the cell death process (including spontaneous cell death) and the active form of this caspase has an affinity for Z-EK(bio)D-aomk, the caspase should be modified covalently by the reagent. The extracts from cells transfected with the caspase-1, -3, -6, or -7 gene showed signals by labeled active caspases (Fig. 6 A). We interpreted these signals as follows based on the predicted cleavage sites by comparison of human and Xenopus caspase sequences (Fig. 1) and the molecular masses of the large subunits from the affinity labeling experiment. The single bands at 17.7 and 19.0 kDa (Fig. 6 A, lanes 6 and 7) observed in the extracts of cells transfected with the caspase-6 or -7 gene correspond to the large subunits of transfected gene products processed by cutting at Asp35 and Asp192 of caspase-6 and at Asp31 and Asp209 of caspase-7, respectively. Cleavage at three sites (Asp16, Asp36, and Asp186) of caspase-3 produced 18.8- and 17.1-kDa polypeptides from the large subunit (Fig. 6 A, lane 5). The processing at Asp104 and Asp296 of caspase-1 generated two polypeptides, 29.8 kDa (a prodomain plus a large subunit) and 21.4 kDa (a large subunit). The other signal (19.0 kDa) might represent cleavage of an endogenous caspase-7 (Fig.6 A, lane 3). The extracts from adherent cells overexpressing caspase-1, -3, -6, or -7 contained much less labeled active caspase than the extracts from adherent plus floating cells,2 which indicates that most of the signal was derived from floating dead cells (29.Samejima K. Tone S. Kottke T.J. Enari M. Sakahira H. Cooke C.A. Durrieu F. Martins L.M. Nagata S. Kaufmann S.H. Earnshaw W.C. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 225-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Cells transfected with the caspase-3, -6, or -7 gene included a small amount of apoptotic floating cells, in which the overexpressed caspase was activated, modified, and detected by affinity labeling. On the other hand, the extracts from cells introduced with the caspase-2, -8, -9, or -10 gene showed no additional signal as compared with the vector-transfected cell extract (Fig. 6 A). In each case, the affinity labeling reagent Z-EK(bio)D-aomk might not bind to the active caspase efficiently, yet cell death might be induced before sufficient amounts of endogenous caspase-3, -6, and -7 for detection are processed. To estimate which caspases are activated in T3-treated XLT-15 and XLT-15-11 cells, their cell extracts were reacted with the affinity labeling reagent. The T3 treatment augmented the intensity of several signals, including two polypeptides that comigrated with processed caspase-6 and -7 (Fig. 6 B). The intensity of a signal (17.1 kDa) that might correspond to processed caspase-3 increased in the T3-treated XLT-15 cell extract, but not in dying XLT-15-11 cells. Numerous lines of evidence have established that caspases play a central role in apoptosis and that this cell death pathway has been conserved throughout the evolution of eukaryotes.

Although it is distant from the 2′-phosphoryl group of NADP+, replacement of the C-terminal tyrosine (Tyr308 in the pea enzyme) by Trp, Phe, Gly, and Ser produced enzyme forms in which the preference for NADPH over NADH was decreased about 2-, 10-, 300-, and 400-fold, respectively.

The vast majority of these oxidoreductases show a strong preference for one of the pyridine nucleotides. In general, NADP-dependent and NAD-dependent dehydrogenases are involved in reductive anabolic pathways and oxidative catabolic pathways, respectively. Crystallographic studies have shown that many pyridine nucleotide-dependent dehydrogenases have similar dinucleotide binding domains known as a Rossmann fold (1.Lesk A.M. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1995; 5: 775-783Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). The structural determinants responsible for coenzyme specificity in these enzymes are thought to be those regions that recognize the distinct features of the two dinucleotides, i.e. the 2′-OHversus the 2′-phosphate group of the adenosine ribose. Attempts to redesign the coenzyme specificity of dehydrogenases by site-directed mutagenesis of the 2′-phosphate binding pocket have revealed that a single residue appears to be of primary importance but that several nearby residues are also involved in determining coenzyme preference (2.Scrutton N.S.

A discouraging reality is that the shift in specificity is often achieved at the expense of catalytic potency (i.e. the loss in the effectiveness with the natural substrate is much greater than the gain in effectiveness of the new substrate). Here, we identify a second structural feature distant from the 2′-phosphate binding region that is required for coenzyme discrimination in ferredoxin-NADP+ reductase (FNR; EC1.18.1.2),1 the enzyme responsible for storing light energy as reducing equivalents of NADPH during photosynthesis (for reviews see Refs. 12.Zanetti G.

FASEB J. 1997; 11: 133-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). The three-dimensional structures of FNR from spinach and the cyanobacterium Anabaena PCC 7119 have been described at high resolution (14.Karplus P.A. Daniels M.J. Herriott J.R. Science. 1991; 251: 60-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (460) Google Scholar, 15.Bruns C.M. Karplus P.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 247: 1125-1145Crossref Scopus (171) Google Scholar, 16.Serre L.

The flavoprotein molecule is made up of two structural domains, each containing approximately 150 amino acids. The C-terminal domain harbors the residues involved in NADP+binding, whereas one molecule of the prosthetic group FAD is tightly bound to the N-terminal domain through a combination of noncovalent interactions (14.Karplus P.A. Daniels M.J. Herriott J.R. Science. 1991; 251: 60-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (460) Google Scholar, 15.Bruns C.M. Karplus P.A. J. Mol.

Biol. 1996; 263: 20-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). The two-domain structure of FNR can be regarded as the basic module for a large structural family of flavin-dependent electron transferases, with more than 20 nonequivalent members identified so far (17.Correl C.C. Ludwig M.L. Bruns C.M. Karplus P.A. Protein Sci. 1993; 2: 2112-2133Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). The FNR family comprises both NADP- and NAD-dependent oxidoreductases. In Fig.1, the “fingerprint” sequence regions involved in pyridine nucleotide binding for selected members of the family are shown. A distinguishing feature of many members of the family is the presence of an aromatic residue (Tyr, Trp, or Phe), whose side chain lies close and parallel to the re-face of the isoalloxazine ring of flavin in the active site, preventing access to the nicotinamide ring of NAD(P)(H). Recently, replacement of the C-terminal Tyr of pea FNR (Tyr308) with Ser or Gly generated mutants displaying a highly enhanced affinity for NADP+. This allowed us to solve crystal structures of the complexes of FNR with NADP(H) (25.Deng Z. Aliverti A. Zanetti G. Arakaki A.K. Ottado J. Orellano E.G. Calcaterra N.B. Ceccarelli E.A. Carrillo N. Karplus P.A. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1999; 6: 847-853Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar), showing the productive binding of the nicotinamide ring in the active site (Fig.2). The increased binding of NADP+ by these FNR mutants led us to hypothesize that removal of the aromatic side chain of the C-terminal residue would promote enhanced binding of NAD+. Here, we report that these mutants form stable complexes with NAD+ and have a greatly enhanced ability to use NADH as an electron donor for catalysis. Our results indicate that the aromatic C-terminal residue of FNR plays a key role in modulating pyridine nucleotide discrimination.Figure 2The NADPH-binding site on FNR.

Absorption spectra recordings were performed on Hewlett-Packard 8452A or 8453 diode array spectrophotometers. Extinction coefficients of the FNR forms were determined by resolving the FAD from the apoprotein by treatment with 0.2% (w/v) sodium dodecyl sulfate and spectrophotometrically quantitating the released FAD (27.Aliverti A.

To determine difference spectra and dissociation constants of the FNR complexes with NAD(P)+and analogs, the various reductase mutants were spectrophotometrically titrated with the corresponding ligands. FNR samples were diluted in 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.7 (at 25 °C) to a final concentration of ∼20 μm. Absorption spectra were recorded after successive additions of nucleotide. Difference spectra were computed by subtracting from each spectrum, the spectrum recorded in the absence of the ligand, taking dilution into account. Absorption values at several different wavelengths were plotted and analyzed as described in Ref. 27.Aliverti A. Bruns C.M. Pandini V. Karplus P.A. Vanoni M.A. Curti B. Zanetti G. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 8371-8379Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar. NADPH-ferricyanide diaphorase activity was determined as described previously (28.Aliverti A. Deng Z. Ravasi D.

NADH-ferricyanide reductase activity was assayed under the same conditions but omitting the regeneration system for the reduced pyridine nucleotide. For the estimation of kinetic parameters of the diaphorase reactions, measurements were carried out at several different concentrations of NADPH or NADH, at a fixed saturating concentration (1 mm) of potassium ferricyanide. Kinetic data were fitted to the enzyme mechanism models using the Hewlett-Packard 89512A enzyme kinetics software. The K3Fe(CN)6 reductase activity was chosen for kinetic characterization of the FNR reductive half-reaction because for the wild-type reductase the rate-limiting step in this reaction is the reduction of FAD by NADPH (27.Aliverti A.

We therefore determined the kinetic parameters of the Tyr308 mutants in both the NADPH- and NADH-ferricyanide reductase reactions assayed under the same conditions (Table I). With the exception of FNR-Y308F, all mutants showed a decrease in k catin the NADPH-dependent activity, with FNR-Y308G and FNR-Y308S displaying the lowest values. With regard to theK m of the enzyme for NADPH, the Phe and Trp replacements produced moderate decreases (about 5-fold), whereas the Gly and Ser replacements led to 25- and 55-fold decreases, respectively (Table I). All mutants showed a significantly higher catalytic efficiency (k cat/K m) with respect to wild-type pea FNR. The most efficient enzyme was the FNR-Y308F with a 6-fold enhancement in its catalytic efficiency (TableI).Table IKinetic parameters of the NAD(P)H-K3Fe(CN)6 diaphorase reactions catalyzed by wild-type and mutant forms of plant FNRFNR formNADPHNADHNADPH/NADH specificityaCalculated as (k cat/K m)NADPH/(k cat/K m)NADH.k catK mk cat/K mk catK mk cat/K me − eq s −1μme − eq s −1μm −1e − eq s −1μme − eq s −1μm −1Spinach wild type50035145.511,0000.0005028,000Pea wild type49024208.816,0000.0005536,000Y308W1805.13519.411,4000.001720,600Y308F5304.11302305,2000.0452,900Y308G510.98523607400.49106Y308S320.44734304500.9577All apparent standard errors were less than 10% of the estimates, and the values reported for mutant enzymes were significantly different from those of wild-type FNR with p < 0.01.a Calculated as (k cat/K m)NADPH/(k cat/K m)NADH. Open table in a new tab All apparent standard errors were less than 10% of the estimates, and the values reported for mutant enzymes were significantly different from those of wild-type FNR with p < 0.01. To probe the hypothesis that these mutants would show less discrimination against NAD(H), we measured the ferricyanide reductase activity of the Tyr308 mutants using NADH as electron donor. Interestingly, the FNR variants with the lowerk cat values in the NADPH-dependent reaction turned out to be the ones displaying the highest NADH-dependent activities (Table I). In the latter reaction, the FNR-Y308S showed a k cat value 2 orders of magnitude higher than that of the wild-type enzyme and comparable with the k cat of the wild-type FNR with NADPH as a substrate. This observation strongly supports the idea that the decrease in k cat for the NADPH-dependent diaphorase reaction of the Gly and Ser mutants was caused by tight binding of the NADP+ product during enzyme turnover (25.Deng Z. Aliverti A. Zanetti G. Arakaki A.K. Ottado J. Orellano E.G. Calcaterra N.B. Ceccarelli E.A. Carrillo N. Karplus P.A. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1999; 6: 847-853Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). The FNR-Y308G displayed kinetic parameters similar to those of the Ser mutant, whereas the FNR-Y308F, which was very efficient as an NADPH-dependent catalyst, also showed a remarkably high k cat in the NADH-dependent reaction. As foreseen, theK m of FNR for NADH was indeed affected by mutations of Tyr308 with a pattern similar to that observed for NADPH. Whereas substituting Phe for Tyr produced only a 3-fold change in the K m value for NADH, replacement with Gly or Ser caused a 20- and 35-fold decrease, respectively, as compared with the wild-type value (Table I). Thus, the catalytic efficiency for the NADH-dependent reaction was increased by about 3-, 80-, 900-, and 1700-fold in the Trp, Phe, Gly, and Ser mutants, respectively. The most convenient measure of the discrimination of an enzyme between two competing substrates is the ratio of the catalytic efficiencies (k cat/K m) with each substrate (30.Fersht A. Structure and Mechanism in Protein Science: A Guide to Enzyme Catalysis and Protein Folding. W. H. Freeman and Company, New York, NY1998: 116-117Google Scholar). This ratio is very high (about 32,000) for wild-type spinach or pea FNR, indicating strong preference for NADPH, but declines sharply with nonaromatic mutations of Tyr308to reach a value of just 77 in the case of FNR-Y308S (Table I). All amino acid replacements of Tyr308, including the conservative Tyr to Phe substitution, resulted in significant changes in the near ultraviolet and visible spectra of the bound flavin (data not shown, but see Ref. 25.Deng Z. Aliverti A. Zanetti G. Arakaki A.K. Ottado J. Orellano E.G. Calcaterra N.B. Ceccarelli E.A. Carrillo N. Karplus P.A. Nat. Struct.

The interaction of these mutants with various nucleotide analogs was investigated by monitoring changes in the visible region of the flavin absorption spectrum. The intensity of the peak at about 510 nm in the difference spectra of the complexes correlates with the nicotinamide ring stacking on there-face of the isoalloxazine (25.Deng Z. Aliverti A.

Therefore, titration experiments could provide information not only on the affinity of the various FNR forms for the ligands but also on the extent of nicotinamide positioning in the active site near the isoalloxazine ring. The Tyr308 mutants were thus titrated with NADP+, NAD+, thio-NADP+, 2′-P-AMP, and 2′-P-ADP-ribose. Selected difference spectra for complexes between various FNR mutants and ligands are displayed in Fig.3 (B–E) and compared with those of the wild-type enzyme (Fig. 3 A). NADP+binding elicited difference spectral changes that were similar in shape in all FNR variants but more intense in the mutants (Fig. 3). Thio-NADP+ causes spectral changes of higher intensity than NADP+ upon binding to wild-type FNR (Fig. 3 A and Ref. 28.Aliverti A. Deng Z. Ravasi D. Piubelli L. Karplus P.A. Zanetti G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 34008-34016Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar), presumably reflecting a greater active site occupancy of the thionicotinamide ring as compared with nicotinamide. The same behavior was observed, although to a lower extent, with both the FNR-Y308W (Fig.3 B) and the FNR-Y308F (Fig. 3 C). On the contrary, thio-NADP+ elicited essentially the same spectral perturbations as NADP+ upon binding to the FNR-Y308S, indicating that the nicotinamide ring of NADP+ already interacts at full occupancy in the active site in the complex of this mutant (Fig. 3 E). The FNR mutants were also tested with NAD+, and, interestingly, binding of this nucleotide elicited difference spectral changes similar to those of the NADP+ complexes (Fig. 3, C–E). Assuming that the FNR-Y308S complex with NADP+ has 100% occupancy of the productive nicotinamide binding mode and that the spectral changes induced by productive nicotinamide binding are not dependent on the mutations or the cofactor used, then the occupancies of all complexes can be estimated by comparison with the Δε510 of the FNR-Y308S-NADP+ complex (TableII). The nicotinamide occupancies for the NAD+ complexes of FNR-Y308G (79%), FNR-Y308S (78%), and FNR-Y308F (26%) correlate well with the k catvalues of these mutants in the NADH-ferricyanide reductase activity (Table I).Table IIDegree of nicotinamide ring occupancy of the binding site as calculated from the extinction coefficient values at the peak near 510 nm of the difference spectra elicited by pyridine nucleotide binding to the various pea FNR formsFNR formNicotinamide occupancyaPercentage of nicotinamide ring binding site occupancy, with 100% referring to NADP+ occupancy of FNR-Y308S (Δε510 = 3.99 mm−1cm−1).NADP−complexThio-NADP+ complexNAD+ complex%Wild type1437NDbND, not determined.Y308W4056NDbND, not determined.Y308F8510326Y308G84NDbND, not determined.78Y308S10010479a Percentage of nicotinamide ring binding site occupancy, with 100% referring to NADP+ occupancy of FNR-Y308S (Δε510 = 3.99 mm−1cm−1).b ND, not determined.

FNR-Y308W was the only mutant for which reliable K d values for NADP+ and thio-NADP+ could be obtained. Complexes of the other mutants with these nucleotides were so tight that only an upper limit of 0.2 μm for their dissociation constants could be estimated. This feature can be appreciated by analysis of theinset in Fig. 3, where selected titration curves are reported. The K d for the NAD+ complex of wild-type FNR is too high to be measured with the methods employed, but reliable K d values could be obtained for the Phe, Gly, and Ser mutants, ranging from about 9 mm for the Phe mutant to less than 0.2 mm for the Ser mutant (TableIII).Table IIIDissociation constants for the complexes of pea FNR forms with pyridine nucleotidesFNR formK dNADP+thio-NADP+NAD+μmWild type9.3 ± 2.93.90 ± 0.2NDaND, not determined.Y308W5.5 ± 0.70.62 ± 0.38NDaND, not determined.Y308F<0.2bActual values not determinable by the fitting procedure.<0.2bActual values not determinable by the fitting procedure.8600 ± 790Y308G<0.2bActual values not determinable by the fitting procedure.NDaND, not determined.500 ± 30Y308S<0.2bActual values not determinable by the fitting procedure.NDaND, not determined.190 ± 7a ND, not determined.b Actual values not determinable by the fitting procedure.

With the realization that these mutants might show enhanced nicotinamide binding, the FNR-Y308S was recently used to obtain the three-dimensional structure of highly stabilized NADP(H) complexes, providing a comprehensive structural picture of the interaction between FNR and its substrate (Fig. 2 and Ref. 25.Deng Z.

Structural and difference spectroscopy data implied that NADP(H) binds to FNR in a bipartite manner, i.e. that the two moieties of the dinucleotide can bind to the enzyme in a partially independent way, according to the following equation.FNR+NADP+↔FNR­NADP+(A)↔FNR­NADP+(AN)Equation 1 where (A) represents the binary FNR-NADP+complex with the dinucleotide bound only through the 2′-P-AMP portion and (AN) represents the complex involving also the interaction of the NMN moiety (25.Deng Z. Aliverti A. Zanetti G. Arakaki A.K. Ottado J. Orellano E.G. Calcaterra N.B. Ceccarelli E.A. Carrillo N. Karplus P.A. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1999; 6: 847-853Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). In wild-type FNR, the enzyme-NADP+ complex is mainly stabilized by interactions involving the adenosine moiety of the dinucleotide, whereas the nicotinamide ring does not contribute significantly to the binding energy (32.Batie C.J. Kamin H. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 11214-11223Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, in the NADP+ complex of wild-type FNR, the adenosine moiety fully occupies its binding site, whereas the nicotinamide moiety binds at a very low occupancy, i.e.(A) ≫ (AN) (28.Aliverti A.

The latter complex is destabilized because the energetic cost of displacing the Tyr308 side chain outweighs the energetic gain due to of nicotinamide binding (25.Deng Z. Aliverti A. Zanetti G. Arakaki A.K. Ottado J. Orellano E.G. Calcaterra N.B. Ceccarelli E.A. Carrillo N. Karplus P.A. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1999; 6: 847-853Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). The physiological role of leaf FNR is to store the photosynthetic energy as NADPH, and it is clearly tailored to avoid reduction of NAD+. Indeed, for wild-type FNR, NAD(H) is a very poor substrate, and much of this is due to its low affinity (33.Shin M Arnon D.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1965; 240: 1405-1411Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Previous analyses of NADPH/NADH specificity of NAD(P)-dependent dehydrogenases have quite reasonably focussed exclusively on the pocket that binds the 2′-phosphate group, i.e. the distinguishing trait between the two pyridine nucleotides (2.Scrutton N.S.

Biophys. 1998; 358: 104-115Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). However, based on considerations of the bipartite binding model (Equation 1), we hypothesized that the pea FNR Tyr308 mutants would show enhanced binding of NAD+, because the increased affinity for the nicotinamide portion of the coenzyme would drive the binding of the whole dinucleotide. The expectation was borne out dramatically because even the most conservative mutant, FNR-Y308F, deprived only of the hydroxyl group on the phenyl ring, showed a 10-fold decrease in coenzyme specificity, with the nonaromatic mutants reaching up to a 400-fold decrease. Interestingly, this specificity drop is entirely due to a large increase in catalytic efficiency with NADH as electron donor, because in vitro catalytic efficiency with NADPH was slightly but significantly increased in all mutants. This increase in the k cat/K m values for NADPH is due to a decrease in the K m for the nucleotide consistent with the mutations nearly exclusively affecting binding affinity rather than orientation. Indeed, the effect of the various mutations on the K m values parallels that onK d of the corresponding FNR-NADP+complexes. We have previously shown that positioning of the nicotinamide ring of NADP(H) is critical for hydride transfer (27.Aliverti A. Bruns C.M. Pandini V. Karplus P.A. Vanoni M.A. Curti B. Zanetti G. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 8371-8379Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 28.Aliverti A. Deng Z. Ravasi D. Piubelli L. Karplus P.A. Zanetti G. J. Biol.

Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 6374-6380Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Mutations at position 308 facilitate nicotinamide-isoalloxazine stacking and are then expected to increase hydride transfer rate rather than to inhibit it. Indeed, the high NADH-dependent diaphorase activities shown by the Gly and Ser mutants confirm that hydride transfer is not impaired. Thus, the negative effect of the Gly and Ser mutations onk cat must be explained by a large decrease in product release rate because of a greatly enhanced affinity of these mutants for NADP+. As a consequence, the rate-limiting step of the reductive half-reaction changes from hydride transfer to NADP+ release. The impressive increase in the catalytic efficiencies for NADH oxidation displayed by the Tyr308 mutants as compared with wild-type FNR (up to 1,700-fold), is due to a simultaneous increase ink cat and a decrease in K mvalues. As in the case of NADPH, the decreased K mvalues of the FNR mutants correlate well with their increased affinity for NAD+. We interpret the progressive increase ink cat observed when replacing Tyr308with Trp, Phe, Gly, and Ser, in terms of a progressive increase in the nicotinamide ring occupancy, as measured by difference spectroscopy on the NAD+ complexes of these mutants (Fig. 3 and Table II). The >1,000-fold lower affinity for NAD+ exhibited by all FNR forms prevents product release from becoming rate-limiting and thus from negatively affecting k cat. A result that deserves further discussion is the lowk cat value of wild-type FNR in the NADH-ferricyanide reductase activity and the fact that replacing Tyr308 can increase this value. It was not possible to obtain a direct measure of nicotinamide occupancy in the complex between wild-type FNR and NAD+, because of the exceedingly high K d of this complex. However, the trend observed in the case of the mutants for which the information is available (Table II) suggests a very low occupancy level for the NAD+complex of wild-type FNR. Thus, the interaction with the 2′-phosphate of the coenzyme is required not only for K d values compatible with catalysis but also for anchoring the substrate in an orientation that enhances proper nicotinamide positioning in the active site, as is required for rapid hydride transfer. In the absence of this anchor, we postulate that the AMP portion of the NADH molecule binds in an orientation that does not allow facile entry of the nicotinamide into the active site. The observation that the Gly and Ser mutants display NADH-dependent k cat values approaching those of wild-type FNR with NADPH as electron donor can be explained on the basis of the fact that when the nicotinamide becomes the dominant binding moiety, it is no longer being misplaced by the interaction of the AMP portion of the dinucleotide. In conclusion, the results reported here illustrate a most interesting example of how enzymes could solve the problem of discriminating between very similar substrate analogs such as NADP(H) and NAD(H). In the case of FNR, discrimination benefits from the establishment of strong, specific contacts with the characteristic groups of each substrate (the 2′-OH or the 2′-phosphate of the adenosine ribose) and from weakening of the interactions with those traits common to both nucleotides, such as the nicotinamide ring. Both mechanisms contribute to developing a decisive preference for NADP(H) in this group of electron transferases and providing an additional rationale to the conservation of an aromatic residue in positions equivalent to Tyr308 in many members of the FNR structural family that use NADP(H) as the preferred or exclusive coenzyme (Fig. 1 and Refs. 17.Correl C.C. Ludwig M.L. Bruns C.M. Karplus P.A. Protein Sci. 1993; 2: 2112-2133Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholarand 34.Karplus P.A. Bruns C.M. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 1994; 26: 89-99Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Furthermore, what is distinct about these results is that the specificity change is due to enhancement of the activity with NADH while making no impairment of the catalytic efficiency with NADPH. It is likely that by combining the Y308S mutation with additional amino acid replacements at the 2′-phosphate-binding site itself (in particular S228D) (11.Shiraishi N. Croy C. Kaur J. Campbell W.H. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1998; 358: 104-115Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 14.Karplus P.A. Daniels M.J. Herriott J.R. Science. 1991; 251: 60-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (460) Google Scholar), it will be possible to produce an NAD+-specific ferredoxin reductase with an activity approaching the NADP+-specific ferredoxin reductase activity of wild-type FNR. As a more general conclusion, the data here presented lead to the suggestion that when engineering proteins to discriminate between two similar ligands, it is even reasonable to target those interactions that are common to both."

This procedure released apoB-48, but not integral membrane proteins, from microsomes of McA-RH7777 cells. Upon gradient ultracentrifugation, the extracted apoB-48 migrated in the same position as the dense apoB-48-containing lipoprotein (apoB-48 HDL (high density lipoprotein)) secreted into the medium. Labeling studies with [3H]glycerol demonstrated that the HDL-like particle extracted from the microsomes contains both triglycerides and phosphatidylcholine. The estimated molar ratio between triglyceride and phosphatidylcholine was 0.70 ± 0.09, supporting the possibility that the particle has a neutral lipid core. Pulse-chase experiments indicated that microsomal apoB-48 HDL can either be secreted as apoB-48 HDL or converted to apoB-48 VLDL. These results support the two-step model of VLDL assembly. To determine the size of apoB required to assemble HDL and VLDL, we produced apoB polypeptides of various lengths and followed their ability to assemble VLDL. Small amounts of apoB-40 were associated with VLDL, but most of the nascent chains associated with VLDL ranged from apoB-48 to apoB-100. Thus, efficient VLDL assembly requires apoB chains of at least apoB-48 size. Nascent polypeptides as small as apoB-20 were associated with particles in the HDL density range. Thus, the structural requirements of apoB to form HDL-like first-step particles differ from those to form second-step VLDL.

Thus, intracellular VLDL is associated with a network of chaperones involved in protein folding. Pulse-chase and subcellular fractionation studies showed that apoB-48 VLDL did not accumulate in the rough endoplasmic reticulum. This finding indicates either that the two steps of apoB lipoprotein assembly occur in different compartment or that the assembled VLDL is transferred rapidly out of the rough endoplasmic reticulum.

Havel R.J. J. Cell Biol. 1976; 69: 241-263Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar). Based on these results, a two-step model for the assembly of VLDL was proposed. Dynamic evidence for this model was obtained by pulse-chase studies of apoB-100 and apoB-48 (2.Borén J. Rustaeus S. Olofsson S.-O. J. Biol.

The first step occurs during the translation of apoB and gives rise to a partially lipidated form of apoB (2.Borén J. Rustaeus S. Olofsson S.-O. J. Biol.

In the case of apoB-100, this partially lipidated particle appeared to be loosely associated with the ER membrane (5.Rustaeus S. Stillemark P. Lindberg K. Gordon D. Olofsson S.-O. J. Biol.

The secretion of this dense, apoB-48-containing, HDL-like lipoprotein varied inversely with that of VLDL (2.Borén J. Rustaeus S. Olofsson S.-O. J. Biol.

However the exact localization of the brefeldin A-sensitive mechanism in the assembly pathway remains to be elucidated. Cotranslational or early post-translational degradation of apoB is important in regulating the amount of apoB that passes through the first step (10.Zhou M. Wu X. Huang L.S. Ginsberg H.N. J. Biol.

Recent results indicate that apoB is completely translocated to the lumen of the ER (12.Shelness G.S. Morris-Rogers K.C. Ingram M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 9310-9318Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), suggesting that the early post-translational degradation follows the pathway described for misfolded proteins (i.e. the protein is retracted through the translocation channel) (13.Cresswell P. Hughes E.A. Curr. Biol. 1997; 7: 552-555Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, there is strong evidence that the degradation involves nascent as well as full-length apoB chains (14.Zhou M. Fisher E.A. Ginsberg H.N. J. Biol.

Studies of VLDL assembly have been hampered by the fact that much of the apoB present in the cell remains associated with the microsomal membrane after carbonate extraction of the luminal proteins and therefore cannot be analyzed. Recently, we developed a procedure that extracts virtually all of the apoB-100 from the microsomal membranes without releasing integral membrane proteins (5.Rustaeus S. Stillemark P. Lindberg K.

Cyanogen bromide-activated Sepharose 4B was from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, and α-cyano-4-OH cinnamic acid was from Aldrich (Milwaukee, WI). Antibodies to chaperones (binding protein, protein disulfide isomerase, glucose regulatory protein 94, and calreticulin) were purchased from Affinity BioReagents (Golden, CO). McA-RH7777 cells were cultured as described previously (2.Borén J. Rustaeus S. Olofsson S.-O. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 25879-25888Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) in Eagle's minimum essential medium containing 20% fetal calf serum, 1.6 mm glutamine, 8.0 mmNaHCO3, 1.6 mm sodium pyruvate, 140 mg/ml streptomycin, 140 IU/ml penicillin, and 60 mg/ml nonessential amino acids in 5% CO2 at 37 °C. The cultures were split twice a week and fed daily. The cells were pulse labeled and chased as described (2.Borén J. Rustaeus S. Olofsson S.-O. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 25879-25888Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Cells and the microsomal fraction were isolated as described (18.Boström K. Borén J. Wettesten M. Sjöberg A. Bondjers G. Wiklund O. Carlsson P. Olofsson S.-O. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 4434-4442Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The luminal content of the vesicles was separated from the vesicle membranes by the sodium carbonate method (19.Fujiki Y. Hubbard A.L. Fowler S. Lazarow P. J. Cell Biol. 1982; 93: 97-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (1385) Google Scholar), as modified (2.Borén J. Rustaeus S. Olofsson S.-O. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 25879-25888Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The following protease inhibitors were used: 0.1 mmleupeptin, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm pepstatin A, 5 mm N-acetyl-Leu-Leu-norleucinal, and aprotinin (100 kallekrein-inhibitory units/ml). In some experiments, the luminal content of the microsomal vesicles was extracted with the deoxycholate/carbonate procedure described recently by Rustaeuset al. (5.Rustaeus S. Stillemark P. Lindberg K. Gordon D. Olofsson S.-O. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 5196-5203Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). The total microsomal fraction was obtained (18.Boström K. Borén J. Wettesten M. Sjöberg A. Bondjers G. Wiklund O. Carlsson P. Olofsson S.-O. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 4434-4442Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and fractionated on a sucrose gradient. A 3.8-ml linear sucrose gradient (32.5–40%, w/v) was layered on a cushion of 0.5 ml of 65% sucrose (w/v), and the sample was layered on top of the gradient. All solutions contained 3 mm imidazole, pH 7.4, with the same protease inhibitors as used for metabolic labeling. The gradients were centrifuged in a Beckman Vti-65.2 vertical rotor at 50,000 rpm for 3 h at 12 °C. The gradient was unloaded from the bottom into 22 fractions. NADPH cytochrome c reductase and galactosyl transferase were used as marker enzymes for the ER and the Golgi apparatus, respectively (20.Borén J. Wettesten M. Sjöberg A. Thorlin T. Bondjers G. Wiklund O. Olofsson S.-O. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 10556-10564Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Gradient fractions were also assayed by Western blot for calnexin, a marker for the rough ER. Lipoproteins in the microsomal lumen or in the medium were separated by sucrose gradient ultracentrifugation (2.Borén J. Rustaeus S. Olofsson S.-O. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 25879-25888Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The gradient was formed by layering, from the bottom of the tube, 2 ml of 49% sucrose, 2 ml of 25% sucrose, 5 ml of the sample in 12.5% sucrose (the sucrose was in phosphate-buffered saline), and 3 ml of phosphate-buffered saline. All solutions contained 0.1 mm leupeptin, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm pepstatin A, 5 mm N-acetyl-Leu-Leu-norleucinal, aprotinin (100 kallekrein-inhibitory units/ml), and 0.5 mm EDTA. The gradients were centrifuged in a Beckman SW40 rotor at 35,000 rpm for 65 h at 12 °C and unloaded from the bottom of the tube into 12–13 fractions. ApoB was immunoprecipitated from the cells, medium, and sucrose gradient fractions as described (2.Borén J. Rustaeus S. Olofsson S.-O. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 25879-25888Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 21.Wettesten M. Boström K. Bondjers G. Jarfeldt M. Norfeldt P.-I. Carrella M. Wiklund O. Borén J. Olofsson S.-O. Eur. J. Biochem. 1985; 149: 461-466Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Immunoaffinity chromatography of apoB-containing fractions extracted from the microsomes or present in the culture medium was carried out as described (18.Boström K. Borén J. Wettesten M. Sjöberg A. Bondjers G. Wiklund O. Carlsson P. Olofsson S.-O. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 4434-4442Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). SDS-PAGE, autoradiography, and determination of the radioactivity in proteins separated in the gels were performed as detailed elsewhere (21.Wettesten M. Boström K. Bondjers G. Jarfeldt M. Norfeldt P.-I. Carrella M. Wiklund O. Borén J. Olofsson S.-O. Eur. J. Biochem. 1985; 149: 461-466Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Lipids from McA-RH7777 cells were extracted as described by Olegård and Svennerholm (22.Olegård R. Svennerholm L. Acta Paediatr. Scand. 1970; 59: 637-647Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar) with slight modifications (23.Andersson M. Wettesten M. Borén J. Magnusson A. Sjöberg A. Rustaeus S. Olofsson S.-O. J. Lipid Res. 1994; 35: 535-545Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Phosphatidylcholine and triglycerides were separated by thin layer chromatography with chloroform:methanol:water (65:25:4 v/v) followed by petroleumether:diethylether:acetic acid (80:20:1 v/v). The spots were visualized by iodine, scraped off, and extracted with 1 ml of chloroform:methanol 1:2 (phosphatidylcholine) or chloroform (triglycerides). The extracted lipids were dried under nitrogen in a conical tube, solubilized in 20 μl of ethanol, and analyzed by enzymatic assays. As standards, pure phosphatidylcholine and triglycerides were chromatographed and processed in parallel with the sample. The recovery of triglycerides and phosphatidylcholine during the chromatography and extraction steps was 94 ± 16% (mean ± S.D.; n = 5) and 65 ± 4% (n = 5). The recovery of triglycerides was also tested with radioactive tracer added to the cell homogenate; this experiment showed a recovery of 94 ± 8% (n = 4). The intra-assay variation was 4.5% for triglycerides and 8.1% for phosphatidylcholine. Phosphatidylcholine and triglycerides were radiolabeled by incubating the cells for various periods with [3H]glycerol (0.6 μCi/ml of culture medium). Cells were extracted, phosphatidylcholine and triglycerides were separated as described above, and specific radioactivity was determined (dpm/mg). In some experiments, apoB-containing lipoproteins were isolated by immunoaffinity chromatography from the luminal content or the medium. During the extraction of the lipids from these fractions, unlabeled phosphatidylcholine and triglycerides were added as carriers. The lipids were separated as described above, and the spots corresponding to triglycerides and phosphatidylcholine were scraped into scintillation vials; 1 ml of cyclohexane was added, and the radioactivity was determined in the presence of Ready-Safe scintillation mixture. Proteins associated with microsomal lipoproteins were isolated and identified as follows. Rat liver microsomes were isolated (23.Andersson M. Wettesten M. Borén J. Magnusson A. Sjöberg A. Rustaeus S. Olofsson S.-O. J. Lipid Res. 1994; 35: 535-545Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and the luminal content was extracted with sodium carbonate (19.Fujiki Y. Hubbard A.L. Fowler S. Lazarow P. J. Cell Biol. 1982; 93: 97-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (1385) Google Scholar). The extract (6 ml) was overlayered with 29 ml of phosphate-buffered saline (8 mm disodium hydrogen phosphate, 1.5 mmpotassium dihydrogen phosphate, 137 mm sodium chloride, and 2.7 mm potassium chloride, pH 7.4, d = 1.006 g/ml). After centrifugation for 22 h at 40,000 rpm in a Beckman Ti-60 rotor at 4 °C, the gradients were fractionated from the top. The upper one-third of the tube (d < 1.006 g/ml) was collected. Pooled fractions of this supernatant (corresponding to three to five rat livers) were loaded onto a Mono Q column equilibrated with 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.8, with 300 mm sucrose, 1 mm EDTA, 2 mmdeoxycholate, 0.5% Triton X-100, 6 m urea, and 40 mm sodium carbonate. The column was eluted with a linear gradient of sodium chloride (0–250 mm) at a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min. Fractions (0.5 ml) were collected, and the proteins in each fraction were separated by SDS-PAGE on 10% gels. Gels were stained with silver. Fractions containing the same protein patterns were combined, concentrated, and subjected to SDS-PAGE on 3–15% gradient gels. The gels were stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue, and the bands were cut out, destained with 50 μl of a mixture of 50% ammonium bicarbonate (25 mm) and 50% acetonitrile, dried, and digested for 15 min with 0.1–0.2 mg of trypsin in 20 μl of 50% ammonium bicarbonate (25 mm) and 50% acetonitrile. Ammonium bicarbonate (25 mm, pH 8) was added to cover the gels, and incubation was continued for 12 h at 37 °C. Fragments were extracted with 10–50 μl of a mixture of 75% acetonitrile and 5% trifluoroacetic acid (in water). Mass spectra were obtained on a TofSpec-E time-of-flight mass spectrometer (Micromass; Manchester, UK) equipped with a time-lagged focusing unit; TOF2UI version 3.4 was used for data collection and OPUS version 3.4 for data analysis. α-Cyano-4-OH cinnamic acid (10 mg/ml in water/acetonitrile, 50/50, v/v) was used as matrix without further purification. The α-cyano-4-OH cinnamic acid solution (0.5 ml) was mixed with the gel extract (0.5 ml) on the target and allowed to dry at room temperature. Spectra were collected in reflectron mode at an accelerating voltage of 20 kV with a 600-ns delayed extraction and a pulse of approximately 2.4 kV. Approximately 200 nitrogen laser pulses (3 ns, 337 nm) were carried out on each sample. For external calibration, a mixture of ACTH and angiotensin II was used (protonated 2465.2 and 1046.5, respectively). The peptide mass fingerprinting software program MS-Fit was run over the Internet. Monoisotopic masses were used for the searches; mass tolerance was ± 200 ppm. To determine the effects of deoxycholate/carbonate extraction (5.Rustaeus S. Stillemark P. Lindberg K. Gordon D. Olofsson S.-O. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 5196-5203Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar) on integral microsomal proteins, we first generated a monoclonal antibody against riboforin. BALB/c mice were immunized with solubilized microsomal membrane proteins from rat liver (23.Andersson M. Wettesten M. Borén J. Magnusson A. Sjöberg A. Rustaeus S. Olofsson S.-O. J. Lipid Res. 1994; 35: 535-545Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Positive hybridomas were identified by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay with the antigen (solubilized rat liver microsomes) and analyzed by Western blot of solubilized rat liver microsomes. One hybridoma reacted with a 60-kDa protein and was recloned to monoclonality. The immunoglobulins were isolated from the hybridoma culture medium and coupled to cyanogen bromide-activated Sepharose 4B as recommended by the manufacturer (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and used for immunoadsorption experiments (23.Andersson M. Wettesten M. Borén J. Magnusson A. Sjöberg A. Rustaeus S. Olofsson S.-O. J. Lipid Res. 1994; 35: 535-545Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Using this immunoadsorbent, we recovered the 60-kDa protein that reacted with the monoclonal antibody. This protein was cut out of the Coomassie-stained gel, digested with trypsin, and analyzed by mass spectrometry as described above. A data search identified the protein as rat riboforin. In contrast to ordinary sodium carbonate extraction, the deoxycholate/carbonate procedure (5.Rustaeus S. Stillemark P. Lindberg K. Gordon D. Olofsson S.-O. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 5196-5203Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar) extracted virtually all of the apoB-48 (93 ± 1%; n = 5) from the microsomes. As judged from immunoblot studies of calnexin (see Ref. 5.Rustaeus S. Stillemark P. Lindberg K. Gordon D. Olofsson S.-O. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 5196-5203Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar) and riboforin (Fig. 1 A) deoxycholate/carbonate extraction did not release integral membrane proteins. Upon gradient ultracentrifugation, the major amount of apoB-48 extracted by the deoxycholate/carbonate method migrated in the HDL density range (Fig. 1 B). Using a modified gradient, we compared the densities of secreted apoB-48 and deoxycholate/carbonate-extracted apoB-48. The major amount of the secreted apoB-48 was present in the VLDL and the HDL density regions, as described previously (2.Borén J. Rustaeus S. Olofsson S.-O. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 25879-25888Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). ApoB-48 that banded in the HDL density region (apoB-48 HDL) migrated in the same position as the apoB-48 extracted from the microsomes (Fig. 1 C); we will refer to this form of apoB-48 as intracellular apoB-48 HDL. Thus, intracellular apoB-48 HDL and secreted apoB-48 HDL have very similar buoyant densities, and each migrated in the gradient in the expected position for a lipoprotein (in comparison with a nonlipidated protein of similar molecular weight) (Fig. 1 C, III). Thus, the membrane-associated apoB-48, like apoB-100 (5.Rustaeus S. Stillemark P. Lindberg K. Gordon D. Olofsson S.-O. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 5196-5203Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar), was extracted from the microsomes as a tentative lipoprotein. To determine if intracellular apoB (both B-100 and B-48)-containing HDL is associated with lipids and contains a lipid core, we began by estimating the incubation time needed to obtain steady-state labeling of the phosphatidylcholine and triglyceride pools of the cell. The cells were incubated with [3H]glycerol (0.6 μCi/ml of culture medium) for 0, 1, 2, 5, 8, and 22 h. After each incubation, phosphatidylcholine and triglycerides were isolated, and the specific radioactivity (dpm/mg) was determined. Triglycerides reached a plateau after 8 h; phosphatidylcholine plateaued between 1 and 8 h, after which the specific radioactivity decreased (data not shown). We therefore incubated the cells for 8 h with [3H]glycerol (0.6 μCi/ml culture of medium). The specific radioactivities of the total phosphatidylcholine (4,025 dpm/μg of lipid) and triglyceride (2,044 dpm/μg of lipid) pools of the cell were determined. The apoB-containing lipoproteins in the HDL density region of the deoxycholate/carbonate extract of the microsomes were isolated by immunoaffinity chromatography, and the radioactivity in phosphatidylcholine and triglycerides was determined. Assuming that the specific radioactivity of the glycerolipids in this apoB fraction was the same as that of the total cell, we estimated the weight ratio between triglycerides and phosphatidylcholine in intracellular apoB HDL to be 0.85 ± 0.15 (n = 3; molar ratio, 0.70 ± 0.09), indicating less triglyceride than phospholipid. Thus, intracellular apoB HDL has an immature lipid core. The labeled cells were also chased for 2 h, and apoB HDL in the medium was isolated by gradient ultracentrifugation followed by immunoaffinity chromatography. Analyzed as described above, the weight ratio between triglycerides and phosphatidylcholine was 0.27 ± 0.10 (n = 3; molar ratio 0.22 ± 0.08), indicating that this particle has a lipid core. Next, we performed pulse-chase experiments to follow the turnover of intracellular apoB-48 HDL and correlated the findings with VLDL assembly and the appearance of apoB-48 HDL in the medium. The cells were pulse labeled with [35S]methionine/cysteine for 10 min and chased for 0–120 min. Radioactive apoB-48 was first seen in the microsomal intracellular apoB-48 HDL (Fig.2). Not until maximal apoB-48 radioactivity was reached in this fraction did any significant amount of apoB-48 radioactivity appear in the VLDL fraction. In fact, the decrease in the apoB-48 radioactivity which followed this maximum accounted for the increased radioactivity in apoB-48 VLDL and in secreted apoB-48 HDL. To determine the length of apoB required for VLDL assembly, we performed pulse-chase studies of nascent apoB chains. To obtain a continuous series of apoB polypeptides of different lengths which could be tested in the assembly process, we truncated apoB with cycloheximide, detached the nascent polypeptides from the ribosomes with puromycin, and chased them through the secretory pathway of the cell into the medium (4.Borén J. Graham L. Wettesten M. Scott J. White A. Olofsson S.-O. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 9858-9867Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The cells were pulse labeled for 10 min and chased for 0–30 min. After each chase period, the cells were treated with cycloheximide and puromycin and then chased for another 180 min in the presence of cycloheximide and puromycin to allow the nascent chains to form lipoproteins and be secreted into the medium. The medium (containing full-length apoB-100/48 as well as the nascent apoB polypeptides that were released into the secretory pathway and secreted during the 180-min chase) was subjected to gradient ultracentrifugation. ApoB was recovered from each fract"

PPIases are divided into the following three structurally distinct classes: cyclophilins, FK506-binding proteins, and parvulins. The parvulin class comprises eukaryotic enzymes that were shown to be essential for growth, such as the PIN1 from human (1.Lu K. Hanes S. Hunter T.

These enzymes preferentially recognize substrates with a phosphorylated serine or threonine N-terminal to the proline residue (5.Yaffe M. Schutkowski M. Shen M. Zhou X. Stukenberg P. Rahfeld J.-U.

Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 706-720Crossref PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar). Most recently, the human PIN1 protein was also found to interact with the microtubule-associated protein tau (9.Lu P.-J. Wulf G. Zhou X.Z. Davies P. Lu K.P. Nature. 1999; 399: 784-788Crossref PubMed Scopus (623) Google Scholar). However, classification has become more complex with the isolation of the human Par14 parvulin enzyme that does not depend on substrate phosphorylation (10.Uchida T. Fujimori F. Tradler T. Fischer G. Rahfeld J. FEBS Lett. 1999; 446: 278-282Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar), much like the bacterial parvulin Par10 (11.Rahfeld J.-U. Rücknagel K.P. Schelbert B. Ludwig B. Hacker J. Mann K. Fischer G. FEBS Lett. 1994; 352: 180-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). For clarity, the phosphorylation-dependent class of eukaryotic parvulin PPIases will be designated PIN-type PPIases. Further members of the PIN-type PPIase class are the DODO from Drosophila melanogaster (12.Maleszka R. Hanes S.D. Hackett R.L. De Couet H. Gabor Miklos L.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 447-451Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar), the PINA from Aspergillus nidulans(7.Crenshaw D. Yang J. Means A. Kornbluth S. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 1315-1327Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar), and the SSP1 from Neurospora crassa (13.Kops O. Eckerskorn C. Hottenrott S. Fischer G. Mi H. Tropschug M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 31971-31976Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar).All the PIN-type PPIases have high sequence similarity in the catalytic domain, in particular a cluster of basic amino acids (lysine 63, arginine 68, and arginine 69 in the human PIN1) that are thought to be responsible for the site-specific PPIase activity (5.Yaffe M. Schutkowski M. Shen M. Zhou X. Stukenberg P. Rahfeld J.-U. Xu J. Kuang J. Kirschner M. Fischer G. Cantley L. Lu K.

Cell. 1997; 89: 875-886Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (604) Google Scholar). In addition to the catalytic domain, PIN-type PPIases have a WW domain of 38–40 amino acid residues (14.Sudol M. Chen H. Bougeret C. Einbond A. Bork P. FEBS Lett. 1995; 369: 67-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar, 15.Sudol M. Bork P. Einbond A. Kastury K. Druck T. Negrini M. Huebner K. Lehman D. J. Biol.

Structure. 1996; 4: 495-499Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar) at their N terminus. Two invariant tryptophans and a high content of proline and hydrophobic aromatic residues characterize WW domains. The WW domain of the human PIN1 has recently been shown to bind phosphorylated peptides and mitotic phosphoproteins through interaction with P-Ser and phosphothreonine (17.Lu P.-J. Zhou X. Shen M. Lu K. Science. 1999; 283: 1325-1328Crossref PubMed Scopus (586) Google Scholar). The WW domain binding activity is required for PIN1 to interact with its substrate in vitro and to perform its essential function in vivo (17.Lu P.-J. Zhou X. Shen M. Lu K. Science. 1999; 283: 1325-1328Crossref PubMed Scopus (586) Google Scholar).Here we describe the isolation and characterization of anArabidopsis thaliana PIN1 homologue. The plant PIN-type PPIase has a characteristic catalytic domain but no N-terminal WW protein-protein-binding domain or comparable module. We demonstrate thein vitro P-Ser-dependent PPIase activity of the PIN1At by using two-dimensional nuclear magnetic resonance (2D-NMR) spectroscopy.DISCUSSIONWe report the characterization of an A. thaliana PPIase PIN1At that shares a high degree of sequence similarity with the catalytic core of PIN-type PPIases. Globally, PIN1At resembles most closely the prototypic E. coli Par10 parvulin (11.Rahfeld J.-U. Rücknagel K.P. Schelbert B. Ludwig B. Hacker J. Mann K. Fischer G. FEBS Lett. 1994; 352: 180-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar), because they do not contain any N- or C-terminal extensions. All other members of the PIN-type parvulin family have an additional WW domain at their N terminus. Structurally, this small domain is linked to the PPIase domain in human PIN1 by a flexible linker of 8 amino acids in human PIN1 (1.Lu K. Hanes S. Hunter T. Nature. 1996; 380: 544-547Crossref PubMed Scopus (793) Google Scholar, 6.Ranganathan R. Lu K. Hunter T. Noel J.

In the crystal structure of human PIN1, an interdomain cavity separating the N-terminal WW domain from the catalytic PPIase domain was observed with scaffolding helix α1 contributing a total of 9 residues to its wall and creating a 23-Å deep internal surface opposite to the hydrophobic pocket of the WW domain (6.Ranganathan R. Lu K. Hunter T. Noel J. Cell. 1997; 89: 875-886Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (604) Google Scholar). Until now, this helical insertion into the core PPIase fold has been found only in the PPIase domains of PIN1, ESS1, DODO, and SSP1, which all possess an N-terminal WW domain. The described PIN1At protein lacks the N-terminal domain but contains a sequence that is highly homologous to the PIN1 α1 helix. Furthermore, preliminary structural data by circular dichroism and conformational13Cα chemical-shift deviations from random coil values are consistent with this stretch being in a helical conformation. Functionally, the role of a protein-protein interaction module was initially recognized for the WW domains (14.Sudol M. Chen H. Bougeret C. Einbond A. Bork P. FEBS Lett. 1995; 369: 67-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar), but only very recently has it been shown that the PIN1 WW domain interacts specifically with a number of proteins phosphorylated on one or more serine or threonine residues (17.Lu P.-J. Zhou X. Shen M. Lu K. Science. 1999; 283: 1325-1328Crossref PubMed Scopus (586) Google Scholar). This interaction is essential for its in vivoactivity, because neither the N-terminal WW domain or the C-terminal PPIase domain could replace the essential function of ESS1/PTF1 in yeast. Moreover, all WW mutants of PIN1 that did not bind phosphoproteins failed to support cell growth in this assay, underlining its functional importance. The role of this binding has been proposed to be the processive isomerization of heavily phosphorylated protein substrates of PIN1 by an enhanced recruitment of the PIN1 near its substrates (17.Lu P.-J. Zhou X. Shen M. Lu K. Science. 1999; 283: 1325-1328Crossref PubMed Scopus (586) Google Scholar). From both the absence of a WW domain and the presence of a hydrophobic α1 helix in PIN1At, we might speculate that the latter could engage in hydrophobic interactions with other proteins, thereby favoring close proximity between the catalytic domain and its potential substrates. Despite the global resemblance to the E. coli parvulin due to the lack of the WW domain, PIN1AT does show specificity for peptide substrates with P-Ser preceding proline, as is the case for all other PIN-type PPIases. Furthermore, a peptide similar to the optimal PIN1 peptide substrate was found to be a good substrate for PIN1At. Mechanistically, this observation is consistent with the presence of a cluster of basic amino acids in PIN1At (lysine 15 and arginine 20 and 21), implicated in the phosphate specificity in human PIN1 (5.Yaffe M. Schutkowski M. Shen M. Zhou X. Stukenberg P. Rahfeld J.-U. Xu J. Kuang J. Kirschner M. Fischer G. Cantley L. Lu K. Science. 1997; 278: 1957-1960Crossref PubMed Scopus (674) Google Scholar, 6.Ranganathan R. Lu K. Hunter T. Noel J. Cell. 1997; 89: 875-886Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (604) Google Scholar). This potential anion-binding site could even be reinforced in PIN1At by the presence of a fourth basic residue, the lysine 22 that substitutes a strictly conserved proline residue in the other PIN-type PPIases. Unlike the experimental evidence for the human PIN1 PPIase activity, obtained on the basis of an indirect chymotrypsin-coupled assay, we used a direct functional assay based on the observation of interconverted molecules during the mixing time of a 2D EXSY NMR experiment. The well resolved signals for the cis and trans isomers of the peptide substrate showed that the uncatalyzed rate constant is too slow to be detectable. In the presence of 10 μm PIN1At, we measured an interconversion rate of 1 s−1. This value is comparable with the 1.3 s−1 rate measured in an analogous fashion for the cis/trans isomerization enhancement of the proline peptide bond of calcitonin by cyclophilin (24.Kern D. Drakenberg T. Wikström M. Forsén S. Bang H. Fischer G. FEBS Lett. 1993; 323: 198-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar) and illustrates a similar catalytic efficiency of cyclophilins and parvulins. At this moment, we only dispose of data regarding thein vitro activity on a small peptide, but the in vivo protein substrates of the human PIN1 could well be conserved in A. thaliana. PIN1 and the mitotic protein monoclonal antibody MPM2 was shown to bind similar epitopes (5.Yaffe M. Schutkowski M. Shen M. Zhou X. Stukenberg P. Rahfeld J.-U. Xu J. Kuang J. Kirschner M. Fischer G. Cantley L. Lu K. Science. 1997; 278: 1957-1960Crossref PubMed Scopus (674) Google Scholar). The same antibody also recognizes plant antigens, suggesting the conservation in plants of an epitope that could be a PIN1At substrate (27.Traas J. Beven A. Doonan J. Cordewener J. Shaw P. Plant J. 1992; 2: 723-732Crossref Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Further experiments are now needed to prove whether PIN1At is involved in the plant cell cycle and to find out how the absence of a WW domain influences the PIN1At activity and function. The question can even be raised whether there is another phosphorylation-dependent parvulin with a WW domain in A. thaliana, similar to the isoforms known for cyclophilins and FK5O6-binding proteins or whether PIN1At is a new type of phosphorylation-dependent parvulin, specific or not, to plant organisms. Peptidyl prolyl cis/trans isomerases (PPIases)1 are enzymes that catalyze the cis/trans isomerization of the peptide bond preceding proline, an intrinsically slow process. PPIases are divided into the following three structurally distinct classes: cyclophilins, FK506-binding proteins, and parvulins. The parvulin class comprises eukaryotic enzymes that were shown to be essential for growth, such as the PIN1 from human (1.Lu K. Hanes S. Hunter T. Nature. 1996; 380: 544-547Crossref PubMed Scopus (793) Google Scholar) or the Saccharomyces cerevisiae ESS1/PTF1 (2.Hanes S. Shank P. Bostian K. Yeast. 1989; 5: 55-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar, 3.Hani J. Stumpf G. Domdey H. FEBS Lett. 1995; 365: 198-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar, 4.Hani J. Schelbert B. Bernhardt A. Domdey H. Fischer G. Wiebauer K. Rahfeld J.-U. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 108-116Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). These enzymes preferentially recognize substrates with a phosphorylated serine or threonine N-terminal to the proline residue (5.Yaffe M. Schutkowski M. Shen M. Zhou X. Stukenberg P. Rahfeld J.-U. Xu J. Kuang J. Kirschner M. Fischer G. Cantley L. Lu K. Science. 1997; 278: 1957-1960Crossref PubMed Scopus (674) Google Scholar, 6.Ranganathan R. Lu K. Hunter T. Noel J. Cell. 1997; 89: 875-886Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (604) Google Scholar) and interact with a subset of phosphoproteins that are involved in the completion of mitosis, such as the CDC25 phosphatase and the polo-like kinase PLX1 (7.Crenshaw D. Yang J. Means A. Kornbluth S. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 1315-1327Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar, 8.Shen M. Stukenberg P. Kirschner M. Lu K. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 706-720Crossref PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar). Most recently, the human PIN1 protein was also found to interact with the microtubule-associated protein tau (9.Lu P.-J. Wulf G. Zhou X.Z. Davies P. Lu K.P. Nature. 1999; 399: 784-788Crossref PubMed Scopus (623) Google Scholar). However, classification has become more complex with the isolation of the human Par14 parvulin enzyme that does not depend on substrate phosphorylation (10.Uchida T. Fujimori F. Tradler T. Fischer G. Rahfeld J. FEBS Lett. 1999; 446: 278-282Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar), much like the bacterial parvulin Par10 (11.Rahfeld J.-U. Rücknagel K.P. Schelbert B. Ludwig B. Hacker J. Mann K. Fischer G. FEBS Lett. 1994; 352: 180-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). For clarity, the phosphorylation-dependent class of eukaryotic parvulin PPIases will be designated PIN-type PPIases. Further members of the PIN-type PPIase class are the DODO from Drosophila melanogaster (12.Maleszka R. Hanes S.D. Hackett R.L. De Couet H. Gabor Miklos L.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 447-451Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar), the PINA from Aspergillus nidulans(7.Crenshaw D. Yang J. Means A. Kornbluth S. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 1315-1327Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar), and the SSP1 from Neurospora crassa (13.Kops O. Eckerskorn C. Hottenrott S. Fischer G. Mi H. Tropschug M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 31971-31976Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). All the PIN-type PPIases have high sequence similarity in the catalytic domain, in particular a cluster of basic amino acids (lysine 63, arginine 68, and arginine 69 in the human PIN1) that are thought to be responsible for the site-specific PPIase activity (5.Yaffe M. Schutkowski M. Shen M. Zhou X. Stukenberg P. Rahfeld J.-U. Xu J. Kuang J. Kirschner M. Fischer G. Cantley L. Lu K. Science. 1997; 278: 1957-1960Crossref PubMed Scopus (674) Google Scholar, 6.Ranganathan R. Lu K. Hunter T. Noel J. Cell. 1997; 89: 875-886Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (604) Google Scholar). In addition to the catalytic domain, PIN-type PPIases have a WW domain of 38–40 amino acid residues (14.Sudol M. Chen H. Bougeret C. Einbond A. Bork P. FEBS Lett. 1995; 369: 67-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar, 15.Sudol M. Bork P. Einbond A. Kastury K. Druck T. Negrini M. Huebner K. Lehman D. J. Biol.

Structure. 1996; 4: 495-499Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar) at their N terminus. Two invariant tryptophans and a high content of proline and hydrophobic aromatic residues characterize WW domains. The WW domain of the human PIN1 has recently been shown to bind phosphorylated peptides and mitotic phosphoproteins through interaction with P-Ser and phosphothreonine (17.Lu P.-J. Zhou X. Shen M. Lu K. Science. 1999; 283: 1325-1328Crossref PubMed Scopus (586) Google Scholar). The WW domain binding activity is required for PIN1 to interact with its substrate in vitro and to perform its essential function in vivo (17.Lu P.-J. Zhou X. Shen M. Lu K. Science. 1999; 283: 1325-1328Crossref PubMed Scopus (586) Google Scholar). Here we describe the isolation and characterization of anArabidopsis thaliana PIN1 homologue. The plant PIN-type PPIase has a characteristic catalytic domain but no N-terminal WW protein-protein-binding domain or comparable module. We demonstrate thein vitro P-Ser-dependent PPIase activity of the PIN1At by using two-dimensional nuclear magnetic resonance (2D-NMR) spectroscopy. DISCUSSIONWe report the characterization of an A. thaliana PPIase PIN1At that shares a high degree of sequence similarity with the catalytic core of PIN-type PPIases. Globally, PIN1At resembles most closely the prototypic E. coli Par10 parvulin (11.Rahfeld J.-U. Rücknagel K.P. Schelbert B. Ludwig B. Hacker J. Mann K. Fischer G. FEBS Lett. 1994; 352: 180-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar), because they do not contain any N- or C-terminal extensions. All other members of the PIN-type parvulin family have an additional WW domain at their N terminus. Structurally, this small domain is linked to the PPIase domain in human PIN1 by a flexible linker of 8 amino acids in human PIN1 (1.Lu K. Hanes S. Hunter T. Nature. 1996; 380: 544-547Crossref PubMed Scopus (793) Google Scholar, 6.Ranganathan R. Lu K. Hunter T. Noel J. Cell. 1997; 89: 875-886Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (604) Google Scholar) or separated by a poly(Q) stretch from its catalytic domain in the N. crassa homolog SSP1 (13.Kops O. Eckerskorn C. Hottenrott S. Fischer G. Mi H. Tropschug M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 31971-31976Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar).

https://openalex.org/W2066093002,"The apoptosis-linkedgene ALG-2 encodes a Ca2+-binding protein of the penta EF-hand family. To investigate the Ca2+ binding properties of the recombinant ALG-2 protein, we have cloned ALG-2 cDNA from mouse liver mRNA. Sequence analysis showed that two types of clones were present. One (named ALG-2,5) corresponds to the published ALG-2 sequence (Vito, P., Lacana, E., and D'Adamio, L. (1996) Science 271, 521–525); the second (named ALG-2,1) is 6 nucleotides shorter, and the corresponding protein lacks the amino acid residues Gly121 and Phe122. Both transcripts are present in mouse tissues in the same 2:1 molar ratio. The ALG-2,5 and ALG-2,1 recombinant proteins are fully soluble in the metal-free form but can be precipitated from bacterial lysates by Ca2+. In the presence of Tween the Ca2+ binding profiles display two high affinity sites with [Ca2+]0.5 values of 1.2 and 3.1 μm for ALG-2,5 and ALG-2,1, respectively,plus one low affinity site. Using the yeast two-hybrid system we demonstrate that both proteins have a strong tendency to form homo- and heterodimers. In contrast to ALG-2,5, the ALG-2,1 isoform does not interact with the target protein AIP-1, earlier described to play a role in apoptosis (Vito, P., Pellegrini, L., Guiet, C., and D'Adamio, L. (1999) J. Biol. Chem. 274, 1533–1540). We propose that the minor sequence difference between ALG-2,5 and ALG-2,1 affects the Ca2+ binding properties and function of the proteins.

(1999) J. Biol. Chem. 274, 1533–1540). We propose that the minor sequence difference between ALG-2,5 and ALG-2,1 affects the Ca2+ binding properties and function of the proteins. In many experimental systems it has been shown that an increased intracellular Ca2+ concentration, generated for instance by ionophores, induces apoptotic cell death (1.Nicotera P. Bellomo G. Orrenius S. Chem. Res. Toxicol. 1990; 3: 484-494Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). Transiently elevated Ca2+ concentrations are required for several pathways leading to apoptosis such as glucocorticoid-mediated (2.McConkey D.J. Nicotera P. Hartzell P. Bellomo G. Wyllie A.H. Orrenius S. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1989; 269: 365-370Crossref PubMed Scopus (524) Google Scholar) and T-cell receptor-mediated (3.McConkey D.J. Hartzell P. Amador-Perez J.F. Orrenius S. Jondal M. J. Immunol. 1989; 143: 1801-1806PubMed Google Scholar) T-cell death. Removal of extracellular Ca2+ or buffering of intracellular Ca2+ can prevent DNA fragmentation and apoptotic body formation (1.Nicotera P. Bellomo G. Orrenius S. Chem. Res. Toxicol. 1990; 3: 484-494Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). Ca2+-dependent nucleases seem to be involved in apoptosis (4.Cohen J.J. Duke R.C. J. Immunol. 1984; 132: 38-42PubMed Google Scholar, 5.Wyllie A.H. Morris R.G. Smith A.L. Dunlop D. J. Pathol. 1984; 142: 67-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (1439) Google Scholar). It has been demonstrated that calmodulin (6.Frankfurt O.S. Sugarbaker E.V. Robb J.A. Villa L. Cancer Lett. 1995; 97: 149-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar) and its target proteins such as calcineurin (7.Shibasaki F. Kondo E. Akagi T. McKeon F. Nature. 1997; 386: 728-731Crossref PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar, 8.Wang H.G. Pathan N. Ethell I.M. Krajewski S. Yamaguchi Y. Shibasaki F. McKeon F. Bobo T. Franke T.F. Reed J.C. Science. 1999; 284: 339-343Crossref PubMed Scopus (962) Google Scholar), Ca2+-dependent kinases (9.Yano S. Tokumitsu H. Soderling T.R. Nature. 1998; 396: 584-587Crossref PubMed Scopus (534) Google Scholar, 10.Cohen P. Klee C.B. Calmodulin. 5. Elsevier Science Publishers B.V., Amsterdam1988Google Scholar, 11.Kawai T. Nomura F. Hoshino K. Copeland N.G. Gilbert D.J. Jenkins N.A. Akira S. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 3471-3480Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar), as well as the Ca2+-dependent protease calpain (12.Squier M.K. Sehnert A.J. Sellins K.S. Malkinson A.M. Takano E. Cohen J.J. J. Cell. Physiol. 1999; 178: 311-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar) play important roles in programmed cell death. However, the molecular pathways triggering Ca2+-dependent apoptosis have been poorly investigated. One promising mediator of Ca2+ regulated apoptosis, the ALG-2 protein, was discovered in a “death trap” assay using T-cell receptor-mediated apoptosis as a model system (13.Vito P. Lacana E. D'Adamio L. Science. 1996; 271: 521-525Crossref PubMed Scopus (455) Google Scholar). Transfection of a variety of cells including T-cells, fibroblasts, and epithelial cells with an antisense ALG-2 construct inhibits apoptosis induced by several stimuli such as staurosporin and dexamethasone. Because in the ALG-2 depleted clones protected from apoptosis caspases were normally activated following T-cell receptor engagement, it was concluded that the ALG-2 protein acts either downstream of caspases or in a caspase-independent way (14.Lacana E. Ganjei J.K. Vito P. D'Adamio L. J. Immunol. 1997; 158: 5129-5135PubMed Google Scholar). ALG-2 expression is not enhanced in apoptotic cells, indicating that its activity is regulated by protein modification or by ligand interaction. The ALG-2 protein was highly conserved during evolution with 70% of sequence identity between human and nematodes (15.Krebs J. Biometals. 1998; 11: 375-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). From sequence comparisons it appeared that the ALG-2 protein contains five EF-hands, with two of them being functional in45Ca2+ overlay experiments (13.Vito P. Lacana E. D'Adamio L. Science. 1996; 271: 521-525Crossref PubMed Scopus (455) Google Scholar), and furthermore it shares homology with members of the PEF (penta EF-hand) family, which includes sorcin (16.Van der Bliek A.M. Meyers M.B. Biedler J.L. Hes E. Borst P. EMBO J. 1986; 5: 3201-3208Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar), grancalcin (17.Boyhan A. Casimir C.M. French J.K. Teahan C.G. Segal A.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 2928-2933Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), calpain light chain (18.Blanchard H. Grochulski P. Li Y. Arthur J.S. Davies P.L. Elce J.S. Cygler M. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1997; 4: 532-538Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar), yeast hypothetical protein of 38.4 kDa (19.Maki M. Narayana S.V. Hitomi K. Biochem. J. 1997; 328: 718-720PubMed Google Scholar), and peflin (20.Kitaura Y. Watanabe M. Satoh H. Kawai T. Hitomi K. Maki M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 263: 68-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). These proteins contain a glycine-rich N-terminal region proposed to play an important role in Ca2+-dependent membrane binding (19.Maki M. Narayana S.V. Hitomi K. Biochem. J. 1997; 328: 718-720PubMed Google Scholar). At high protein concentrations recombinant ALG-2 can be precipitated by Ca2+ (21.Maki M. Yamaguchi K. Kitaura Y. Satoh H. Hitomi K. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1998; 124: 1170-1177Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). The nonionic detergent Triton X-100 (1%) prevents this precipitation, suggesting an involvement of hydrophobic interactions in the Ca2+ induced precipitation. Indeed ALG-2 exhibits a Ca2+-dependent exposure of a hydrophobic surface as monitored with a fluorescent hydrophobicity probe (21.Maki M. Yamaguchi K. Kitaura Y. Satoh H. Hitomi K. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1998; 124: 1170-1177Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Thus, it is likely that ALG-2 activation is initiated by Ca2+ binding and may lead to hydrophobic interactions with target(s). Recently, two reports on the interaction of ALG-2 with a target protein either named Alix (22.Missotten M. Nichols A. Rieger K. Sadoul R. Cell Death Differ. 1999; 6: 124-129Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar) or AIP-1 (23.Vito P. Pellegrini L. Guiet C. D'Adamio L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 1533-1540Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar) were published. Alix/AIP-1 interaction with ALG-2 was shown to be Ca2+-dependent in the submicromolar range. Because truncated AIP-1, which is still able to bind ALG-2, can block apoptosis, it was postulated that AIP-1 cooperates with the ALG-2 protein to mediate the Ca2+-dependent signaling leading to cell death. Here we report that two transcripts of ALG-2 are present in mouse tissues. We have expressed the two ALG-2 isoforms inEscherichia coli and compared several biophysical properties of the purified proteins. Despite the difference of only 2 amino acids, the ALG-2 isoforms differ significantly in their Ca2+binding properties and in their ability to interact with AIP1. Total RNA was isolated from freshly prepared adult mouse liver according to the method of Chomczynski and Sacchi (24.Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (63143) Google Scholar). cDNA was synthesized using oligo(dT) as a primer with standard procedures. This cDNA served as a template for PCR 1The Abbreviations used are: PCR, polymerase chain reaction; nt, nucleotide(s); bp, base pairs. using primers containing either the ALG-2 ATG start codon or its translation TAA stop codon with the following sequence: Primer 1 (ATG), 5′-GCCGCGTTGCCGCTGTGCATCAGCATATG-3′; Primer 2 (TAA), 5′-TGCCGTGGATCCTGTTCTCAAGGCCTGGTTA-3′. Primer 1 contains anNdeI site (underlined), and primer 2 contains aBamHI site (underlined). The PCR product was digested withNdeI and BamHI followed by ligation with pGEMEXII (Promega). The ALG-2 insert of several clones was sequenced by the dideoxy chain termination method (25.Sanger F. Nicklen S. Coulson A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 5463-5467Crossref PubMed Scopus (52599) Google Scholar). Both ALG-2 proteins were expressed in the E. coli, strain BL-21 (DE3). Expression of the ALG-2 proteins was induced at A 600 0.7 by 0.5 mmisopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside. The bacteria were harvested after 2.5–3 h by centrifugation at 8400 × gfor 15 min, resuspended in 0.01 vol (of bacteria culture) of a buffer containing 2.4 m sucrose, 40 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, and 10 mm EDTA and incubated at 4 °C for 30 min. Lysis was carried out at 4 °C overnight by the addition of 0.04 volume of a solution containing 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 100 mm KCl, 1 mm EDTA, 0.1 mg/ml lysozyme (Sigma), 1 mm dithiothreitol. The lysate was clarified by centrifugation at 34,500 × g for 30 min. The ALG-2 protein was then precipitated from the supernatant by addition of 5 mm CaCl2 for 10 min on ice followed by centrifugation at 17,200 × g for 15 min. The precipitate was washed with 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, 1 mm CaCl2 and dissolved in 0.05 volume (of original bacterial culture) of a buffer containing 5 mmEDTA, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, at 4 °C. The supernatant after a further centrifugation step (17,500 ×g for 15 min) was subjected to anion exchange chromatography using a PE 4.6/100 (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) column and an Aekta (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) chromatographic system. Following injection of the sample (up to 50 ml) the column was washed with one sample volume of buffer A (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, 1 mm EDTA) followed by a gradient from 0 to 35% buffer B (buffer A + 500 mm NaCl) in totally 22 ml. The column was finally washed with 100% buffer B. The protein concentration was estimated by the Lowry colorimetric test (26.Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The purity of the proteins was analyzed by 12% polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Metal-free protein samples desalted by Sephadex G-25 gel filtration in 5 mm ammonium bicarbonate and subsequently lyophilized were subjected to matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight (MALDI-TOF) mass spectrometry with myoglobin and aldolase as internal standards. CD spectra were acquired with a Jasco J-715 spectropolarimeter on 2.5 mg/ml protein solutions in 5 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.5, in the presence of 0.5% Tween, a detergent that remains optically transparent in the 180–250 nm range. The optical path was 0.1 mm. The secondary structure content was evaluated with a program that fits the experimental data in the 190–250 nm spectral range to 22 reference spectra (27.Johnson W.C. Proteins. 1999; 35: 307-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (623) Google Scholar). Ca2+ binding was measured at 25 °C on 20–25 μm protein by the flow dialysis method (28.Colowick S.P. Womack F.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1969; 244: 774-777Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) in a buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm KCl. Because the detergent Tween prevented efficiently protein precipitation, even at 50 μm protein, flow dialysis experiments were carried out both in the presence and in the absence of 0.5% Tween present in both the stationary protein compartment and in the perfusate. Processing of data and evaluation of the binding constants were as described (29.Cox J.A. Celio M. Guidebook to the Calcium-binding Proteins. Oxford University Press, Oxford1995: 1-12Google Scholar). For the synthesis of the ALG-2 specific RNA probe the template plasmid pALG271 was constructed as follows: the 271-bp fragment of the ALG-2,5 cDNA (bp 224–494) was amplified by PCR with primers containing XbaI and KpnI restriction sites (underlined), respectively: forward primer, 5′-ATGGTCTAGATTTAACCCAGTGACTG-3′; reverse primer, 5′-GATCTGGTACCGTCCTTGCCTGTC-3′. PCR amplification was performed using a 10:1 Gold Taq (Perkin Elmer):Pfu1 (Stratagene) polymerase mixture. The PCR product was eluted from an agarose gel, digested with XbaI andKpnI, and cloned into the pSP72 vector (Promega). The pALG271 construct was verified by dideoxy chain termination sequencing (25.Sanger F. Nicklen S. Coulson A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 5463-5467Crossref PubMed Scopus (52599) Google Scholar). The 32P-labeled antisense ALG-2 RNA probe was synthesized by the in vitro transcription method (MaxiScript kit, Ambion) using T7 polymerase and the pALG-271 template linearized with XbaI. The probe was purified from a 8 murea/5% polyacrylamide gel. RNA was isolated by the guanidine-thiocyanate method (24.Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (63143) Google Scholar) from mouse tissues. 10 μg of total RNA was hybridized with the ALG-2 probe using the RPAII kit (Ambion) according to the manufacturer's protocol. After RNase digestion, the products were separated on a 5% polyacrylamide gel containing 8m urea in TBE buffer. The gel was exposed with an AGFA x-ray film at −80 °C with intensifying screens for 1–3 days. Quantification of signals was performed by PhosphoImager scanning. The open reading frame of ALG-2,5 or ALG-2,1 was cloned in-frame with either the GAL-4 DNA binding or the transactivating domain into the EcoRI site of the pAD GAL4 or pBD GAL4 yeast expression vectors (Stratagene) by blunt end ligation. The TH28 (AIP1) cDNA inserted in pcDNA3 (23.Vito P. Pellegrini L. Guiet C. D'Adamio L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 1533-1540Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar) was kindly provided by Dr. P. Vito. The plasmid was digested with NotI, flushed with the Klenow fragment of DNA polymerase I, and redigested with XbaI. The pAD GAL4 plasmid was digested withSalI, flushed with the Klenow enzyme, redigested withXbaI, and ligated with the TH28 insert. All protein coding parts of the plasmids were sequenced. Expression of the fusion proteins in yeast was confirmed by Western blotting with a polyclonal anti-mouse ALG-2 antibody raised in rabbits (described elsewhere). The p53 and pSV40 control plasmids were from Stratagene. The Saccharomyces cerevisiae strain YRG-2 (Matα ura3-52 his3-200 ade2-101 lys2-801 trp1-901 leu2-3 112 gal4-542 gal80-538LYS2::UASGAL1-TATAGAL1-HIS3 URA3::UASGAL4 17-mers (x3) - TATACYC1-lacZ) (Stratagene) was used for all two-hybrid experiments. The HIS3/LEU2/TRP1/URA3 phenotype of the YRG-2 yeast strain was verified as recommended by the manufacturer's protocol. Yeast cultures were grown at 30 °C in either YPD medium (2% peptone, 1% yeast extract, 2% glucose) or SD minimal medium (0.67% nitrogene base, 18.2% d-sorbitol, 2% glucose) supplemented with amino acids. A single yeast colony was inoculated in 250 ml of YPD medium and grown untilA 600 1.3. Yeast cells were harvested by centrifugation at 1500 × g for 5 min at +4 °C, washed with double-distilled H2O and with 1 md-sorbitol, pelleted as above, and resuspended on ice in 1 ml of 1 md-sorbitol. The cells (80 μl of the suspension) were transformed with 5 μg of supercoiled plasmid DNA by electroporation at 1500 V, 25 microfarad, 200 Ω in 0.2 cm cuvettes using the Bio-Rad Gene Pulser II. Cells were immediately placed on ice, resuspended in 1 ml of 1 md-sorbitol, transferred into 15-ml tubes, and incubated at 30 °C for 1.5 h with shaking. 100 μl of the cell suspension were plated onto SD-agar plates lacking Trp and Leu and grown for 3–4 days at 30 °C. Single colonies were streaked either onto selective SD-agar plates lacking Trp, Leu, and His or on a nitrocellulose membrane (Hybond-C; Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and incubated for 3 or 1 days, respectively, at 30 °C. The filter β-galactosidase assay was performed according to the manual of Stratagene (HybriZAP two-hybrid vector kit). β-Galactosidase activity in solution was analyzed using the Galacton-Star reporter assay kit (Tropix Inc.) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Because ALG-2 transcripts are present in relatively high abundance in mouse liver (13.Vito P. Lacana E. D'Adamio L. Science. 1996; 271: 521-525Crossref PubMed Scopus (455) Google Scholar), ALG-2 cDNA was cloned by PCR amplification using liver mRNA as a template. The PCR product containing the complete coding sequence was cloned into the bacterial expression vector pGEMEXII. Sequencing of several clones revealed that two forms of ALG-2 transcripts exist (Fig.1). One, named ALG-2,5, was identical to the published sequence (13.Vito P. Lacana E. D'Adamio L. Science. 1996; 271: 521-525Crossref PubMed Scopus (455) Google Scholar), whereas the second (ALG-2,1) lacked 6 base pairs corresponding to the amino acid residues Gly121 and Phe122 in the linker region between the 3rd and 4th EF-hand of the ALG-2,5 protein. 10 clones were further analyzed by PCR with primers adjacent to the six differing base pairs. Five clones gave rise to a PCR product of 55 bp and 5 clones yielded in 61 bp indicative of the ALG-2,1 and ALG-2,5 forms (results not shown). Further support for the existence of two ALG-2 isoforms was provided by the presence of both sequences in human and mouse EST DNA data bases. In preliminary experiments using Northern blot analysis, we have shown that brain, kidney, and ovaries express high amounts of ALG-2 RNA (not shown). To investigate whether indeed two transcripts are present in these tissues the RNase protection assay was carried out. An ALG-2 specific probe was designed to protect a 263-nucleotide fragment of the ALG-2,5 transcript and two fragments of 194 and 63 nucleotides, respectively, corresponding to the ALG-2,1 transcript. We found that both RNA species are transcribed (Fig. 2) in a molar ratio of 2:1 (ALG-2,5 to ALG-2,1) as monitored by PhosphoImager scanning. Initial experiments revealed that the recombinant ALG-2 proteins can be selectively precipitated by millimolar Ca2+concentrations from bacterial lysates. Ca2+-dependent precipitation was therefore used for the purification of the recombinant proteins. The proteins were precipitated twice with 5 mm CaCl2 followed by anion exchange chromatography in a salt gradient (Fig.3). This led to a high purity of the ALG-2 proteins, with a final yield of 5–10 mg of purified protein/liter of bacterial culture. Amino acid analysis was carried out to verify the protein preparations. The experimental values of the molecular masses determined by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight mass spectrometry were 21,533 ± 6 and 21,739 ± 9 for ALG-2,1 and ALG-2,5, respectively. These values correspond precisely to the theoretical molecular masses of the proteins, whose N-formyl Met is post-translationally cleaved off from the N terminus (theoretical values are 21,532 and 21,736 for ALG-2,1 and ALG-2,5, respectively). The two isoforms have the same mobility in SDS-containing gels and display a molecular mass of 22 kDa. Their UV spectra are slightly different but show the abundance of Trp and Tyr residues (data not shown). A molecular extinction coefficient at 278 nm of 39,200 m−1 cm−1 was used to determine the protein concentration for both isoforms. In the presence of 0.5% Tween neither of the isoforms precipitates upon addition of Ca2+ at protein concentrations up to 50 μm. Circular dichroism on the metal-free and Ca2+ loaded forms of ALG-2,1 and ALG-2,5 in the presence of this detergent showed that the proteins display similar far UV spectra (data not shown). The results of the secondary structure predictions according to Ref. 27.Johnson W.C. Proteins. 1999; 35: 307-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (623) Google Scholar are summarized in TableI. Ca2+ binding or dissociation only slightly modify the secondary structure of both ALG-2 isoforms, a feature also observed in several other Ca2+-binding proteins, such as calretinin (30.Schwaller B. Durussel I. Jermann D. Herrmann B. Cox J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 29663-29671Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar) or S100 proteins (31.Heizmann C.W. Cox J.A.

Although the low affinity site seems to be identical among the two ALG-2 isoforms with a K D of 300 μm, there are two marked differences concerning the high affinity sites: (i) the Ca2+ sensitivity of ALG-2,5 is higher than that of ALG-2,1 with a [Ca2+]0.5value of 1.2 versus 3.1 μm, respectively, and (ii) the Hill coefficient, n H, of the ALG-2,5 curve is 1.1, that of ALG-2,1 is 1.9. In the absence of detergent the proteins consistently precipitate during the titration, thus demonstrating an increase in the complexity of the binding phenomena. The isotherms are quite different (Fig. 4,rectangles and circles); ALG-2,1 displays a single set of three sites with a [Ca2+]0.5 of 28 μm and n H = 1.6, and ALG-2,5 possesses two sites with a [Ca2+]0.5 of 5.5 μm and n H of 2.0, plusone site with a K D of 330 μm. Thus, the precipitation perturbs the Ca2+ binding properties of ALG-2,1 much more than those of ALG-2,5. The binding isotherms are not affected by the presence of 2 mm Mg2+, indicating that the functional EF-hands in ALG-2 are of the Ca2+-specific type as found in calmodulin (32.Nelson M.R. Chazin W.J. Biometals. 1998; 11: 297-318Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). Note that in the presence of Tween the high affinity sites have a 5–10-fold higher affinity for Ca2+ than in the absence of the detergent. The increased affinity in the presence of detergent likely reflects the fact that the energetically unfavorable exposure of hydrophobic patches to the polar solvent is mostly abolished if the detergent occupies these hydrophobic patches. In conclusion, both ALG-2 isoforms show Ca2+ affinities in the low micromolar range. This is comparable with values found for Ca2+ modulated proteins, such as calmodulin (10.Cohen P. Klee C.B. Calmodulin. 5. Elsevier Science Publishers B.V., Amsterdam1988Google Scholar), which serve as mediators in intracellular signal transduction. Therefore, our results indicate that ALG-2 has a potential to act in Ca2+triggered pathways leading to apoptosis. Interestingly, ALG-2,1 has a lower Ca2+ affinity than ALG-2,5, indicating that the two proteins might be recruited during Ca2+ transients in a different fasion. From the primary structure it is obvious that EF-hands 1 and 3 are the canonical ones and that all other sites contain aberrations. Vitoet al. (13.Vito P. Lacana E. D'Adamio L. Science. 1996; 271: 521-525Crossref PubMed Scopus (455) Google Scholar) studied Ca2+ binding to deletion mutant proteins that contained either site 1 or 3 and observed that efficient Ca2+ binding occurs only if both EF-hands are present. Lo et al. (33.Lo K.W. Zhang Q. Li M. Zhang M. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 7498-7508Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar) inactivated site 1, site 3, or both by point mutations and demonstrated that Ca2+ binding induced conformational changes in each of the single mutant proteins but not in the proteins with two mutated sites. Combining these results with our direct binding data, we suggest that EF-hands 1 and 3 are the high affinity sites in the ALG-2 isoforms. The low affinity site is more difficult to localize because both sites 2 and 4 contain a positively charged residue in the Z position, a Ca2+-coordinating position, which normally provides an oxygen atom from a side chain carbonyl group. EF-hand domain 5 contains an insertion of two amino acid residues and glutamine in the −Z position, which is not generally found in functional EF-hands. Future mutational analysis will allow a precise localization of the sites and an evaluation of their importance for the function of the ALG-2 proteins. In the absence of available structural information the difference in Ca2+ binding properties of the ALG-2 isoforms is difficult to explain. The amino acid residues Gly121 and Phe122 are located in the linker region beyond the 3rd EF-hand, thus the lack of these residues in the ALG-2,1 protein cannot directly affect the Ca2+-binding site. More likely this “deletion” causes some conformational changes in the ALG-2,1 protein, which might be critical for intramolecular interactions and EF-hand integrity resulting in lower Ca2+affinity as compared with ALG-2,5. However, the final conclusion can be made only based on the three-dimensional structure of the ALG-2 isoforms. It is well documented that proteins of the PEF family can form homodimers (34.Zamparelli C. Ilari A. Verzili D. Vecchini P. Chiancone E. FEBS Lett. 1997; 409: 1-6Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 35.Teahan C.G. Totty N.F. Segal A.W. Biochem. J. 1992; 286: 549-554Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar) or heterodimers (36.Sorimachi H. Ishiura S. Suzuki K. Biochem. J. 1997; 328: 721-732Crossref PubMed Scopus (620) Google Scholar). ALG-2 contains an abortive fifth EF-hand motif that functions as a dimerization site in the related protein, calpain light chain (18.Blanchard H. Grochulski P. Li Y. Arthur J.S. Davies P.L. Elce J.S. Cygler M. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1997; 4: 532-538Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). Lo et al. (33.Lo K.W. Zhang Q. Li M. Zhang M. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 7498-7508Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar) have recently shown by gel filtration chromatography and chemical cross-linking that ALG-2,5 can occur in a monomeric or dimeric form. The dimerization of ALG-2,5 was detected by the two-hybrid screening of a mouse cDNA library (22.Missotten M. Nichols A. Rieger K. Sadoul R. Cell Death Differ. 1999; 6: 124-129Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). Here, we have applied the yeast two-hybrid system (37.Fields S. Song O. Nature. 1989; 340: 245-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (4852) Google Scholar) to investigate homo- and heterodimerization of the ALG-2 isoforms. Both, ALG-2,5 and ALG-2,1 cDNA were cloned in-frame with either the GAL4 DNA-binding domain or the transcriptional activation domain. The hybrid proteins were expressed in different combinations in the YRG-2 yeast strain harboring integrated lacZ and HIS3 reporter genes under the control of the GAL4 upstream activating sequence. The interaction phenotype was scored by the ability of the transformed yeast to grow on a synthetic medium without histidine and by β-galactosidase activity (Fig. 5). We found that both ALG-2 isoforms form homo- and heterodimers with similar and rather high efficiency as compared with the interaction between p53 and SV40 large T-antigen, which served as a positive control. Despite the fact that ALG-2 was cloned by functional screening (13.Vito P. Lacana E. D'Adamio L. Science. 1996; 271: 521-525Crossref PubMed Scopus (455) Google Scholar), the molecular mechanism and mode of regulation of its action still remain unknown. So far, one target protein named AIP1 (23.Vito P. Pellegrini L. Guiet C. D'Adamio L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 1533-1540Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar) or Alix (22.Missotten M. Nichols A. Rieger K. Sadoul R. Cell Death Differ. 1999; 6: 124-129Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar) was identified in a two-hybrid screen. This protein seems to cooperate with ALG-2 in the control of apoptosis in different cell systems. To check whether the two ALG-2 isoforms equally recognize the same target, the ALG-2 interacting domain of AIP1, TH28 (23.Vito P. Pellegrini L. Guiet C. D'Adamio L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 1533-1540Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar), fused to the GAL4 transcriptional activation domain, was expressed in yeast either with the ALG-2,5 or ALG-2,1 GAL4 DNA-binding domain fusion constructs. The expression level of the hybrid proteins was nearly identical in all analyzed clones as monitored by immunoblotting (data not shown). The yeast transformed with ALG-2,5 and TH28 had a HIS3+lacZ+ phenotype indicating interaction, whereas the ALG-2,1/TH28 transformants did not grow on a selective medium lacking histidine and remained white in the filter β-galactosidase assay (not shown). Liquid β-galactosidase assays confirmed the absence of enzyme activity (Fig. 5), hence the absence of interaction between ALG-2,1 and AIP1. From the quantification of the β-galactosidase activity in yeast lysates it appeared that the efficiency of ALG-2 homo- and heterodimerization is much higher (15 fold) than the efficiency of ALG-2,5/TH28 (AIP1) interaction. Based on these results we speculate that the ALG-2,1 isoform might down-regulate the ALG-2,5/AIP1 complex formation via heterodimerization with ALG-2,5. Alternatively, ALG-2,1 could have its own interacting partner(s) and therefore may possess biological activities different from those of ALG-2,5. Dr. P. Vito is acknowledged for providing us with AIP1 cDNA. We also thank Christian Hansen for construction of the pAD TH28 plasmid and Dr. J. Mollerup for critical reading of the manuscript."

Of the 45 selected variants sequenced, 25 ribozymes carried a common mutation at nucleotides 224 and 225 of RNase P catalytic RNA from Escherichia coli (G224G225 → AA). These selected ribozymes exhibited at least 10 times higher cleavage efficiency (k cat/K m) than that derived from the wild type ribozyme. Our results suggest that the mutated A224A225 are in close proximity to the substrate and enhance substrate binding of the ribozyme. When these ribozyme variants were expressed in herpes simplex virus 1-infected cells, the levels of thymidine kinase mRNA and protein were reduced by 95–99%. Our study provides the first direct evidence that RNase P ribozyme variants isolated by the selection procedure can be used for the construction of gene-targeting ribozymes that are highly effective in tissue culture. These results demonstrate the potential for using RNase P ribozymes as gene-targeting agents against any mRNA sequences, and using the selection procedure as a general approach for the engineering of RNase P ribozymes.

For example, both hammerhead and hairpin ribozymes have been shown to cleave viral mRNA sequences and inhibit viral replication in cells infected with human viruses, while a ribozyme derived from a group I intron has been used to repair mutant mRNAs in cells (4.Pal B.K.

Thus, ribozymes can be used as a tool in both basic and clinical research, such as in studies of tumorigenesis and antiviral gene therapy. RNase P is a ribonucleoprotein complex responsible for the 5′ maturation of tRNAs (10.Altman S. Kirsebom L.A. Gesteland R.F. Cech T.R. Atkins J.F. The RNA World. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1999: 351-380Google Scholar, 11.Frank D.N. Pace N.R. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 153-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (395) Google Scholar). It catalyzes a hydrolysis reaction to remove a 5′ leader sequence from tRNA precursors (ptRNA)1 and several other small RNAs. In Escherichia coli, RNase P consists of a catalytic RNA subunit (M1 RNA) and a protein subunit (C5 protein) (10.Altman S. Kirsebom L.A. Gesteland R.F. Cech T.R. Atkins J.F. The RNA World. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1999: 351-380Google Scholar, 11.Frank D.N. Pace N.R. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 153-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (395) Google Scholar). In the presence of a high concentration of salt, such as 100 mm Mg2+, M1 RNA acts as a catalyst and cleaves ptRNAs in vitro in the absence of C5 protein (12.Guerrier-Takada C. Gardiner K. Marsh T. Pace N. Altman S. Cell. 1983; 35: 849-857Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2035) Google Scholar). Extensive studies with both phylogenetic and biochemical analyses have established models for the secondary and three-dimensional structures of RNase P catalytic RNAs (13.Chen J.L. Nolan J.M. Harris M.E. Pace N.R. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 1515-1525Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar, 14.Haas E.S. Brown J.W. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 4093-4099Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar, 15.Haas E.S. Brown J.W. Pitulle C. Pace N.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 2527-2531Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar, 16.Massire C. Jaeger L. Westhof E. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 279: 773-793Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). These models provide a framework to identify the putative active site and substrate binding site, and to study the mechanism of RNase P catalytic RNAs. Studies on substrate recognition by RNase P have revealed that a small model substrate can be cleaved efficiently by M1 ribozyme (Fig.1 A). This model substrate contains a structure equivalent to the acceptor stem, the T-stem, the 3′ CCA sequence, and the 5′ leader sequence of a ptRNA molecule. Accordingly, M1 catalytic RNA can cleave a mRNA sequence if the mRNA substrate forms a hybrid complex with its complementary sequence (external guide sequence) (Fig.1 A) (17.Forster A.C. Altman S. Science. 1990; 249: 783-786Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar). Moreover, a sequence-specific mRNA-cleaving ribozyme, M1GS RNA, can be constructed by linking a guide sequence covalently to M1 RNA (Fig. 1 A) (18.Frank D. Harris M. Pace N.R. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 10800-10808Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 19.Liu F. Altman S. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 471-480Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). In this reaction, the ribozyme uses its guide sequence to bind to its substrate through base pairing interactions and then docks the substrate into the active site, followed by cleavage and finally by product dissociation (Fig.1 B). We have previously shown that a M1GS ribozyme cleaved the mRNA sequence encoding the thymidine kinase (TK) of herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV-1) (19.Liu F. Altman S. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 471-480Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar, 20.Liu F. Altman S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 2690-2696Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). When the ribozyme was expressed in mammalian cells infected with HSV-1, both the viral TK mRNA and protein levels were reduced by 75% (19.Liu F. Altman S. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 471-480Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). While little is known about the rate-limiting step of M1GS RNA cleavage reaction in cultured cells, studies on hammerhead and hairpin ribozymes suggest that binding of the ribozyme to its target RNA appears to be rate-limiting in vivo (4.Pal B.K. Scherer L. Zelby L. Bertrand E. Rossi J.J. J. Virol. 1998; 72: 8349-8353Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 9.zu Putlitz J., Yu, Q. Burke J.M. Wands J.R. J.

Science. 1993; 262: 1566-1569Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). Extensive studies have been carried out to develop strategies to express these ribozymes that colocalize with the substrates within a particular cellular compartment, and to design ribozymes to target the mRNA regions that are accessible to binding (4.Pal B.K. Scherer L. Zelby L. Bertrand E. Rossi J.J. J. Virol. 1998; 72: 8349-8353Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 9.zu Putlitz J., Yu, Q. Burke J.M. Wands J.R. J.

Chem. 1998; 273: 23524-23533Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). These studies have led to significant improvements of the efficacies of hammerhead and hairpin ribozymes in cellular environments. In our previous studies, M1GS RNA was targeted to a region of TK mRNA that is accessible to modification by dimethyl sulfate in cell culture and also accessible to ribozyme binding (19.Liu F. Altman S. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 471-480Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar, 25.Kawa D. Wang J. Yuan Y. Liu F. RNA. 1998; 4: 1397-1406Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Moreover, the ribozyme was expressed primarily in the nuclei by using the promoter of small nuclear U6 RNA (19.Liu F. Altman S. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 471-480Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar, 23.Bertrand E. Castanotto D. Zhou C. Carbonnelle C. Lee N.S. Good P. Chatterjee S. Grange T. Pictet R. Kohn D. Engelke D.

Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 8006-8010Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). This design would increase the probability for the constructed RNase P ribozyme to locate and bind to its target mRNA sequence. Under such conditions, it is possible that the rate of the RNase P ribozyme cleavage in culture cells is dictated by the overall cleavage rate (k cat/K m) of the ribozyme. If this is the case, increasing the catalytic efficiency of the ribozyme may lead to more effective inhibition of the target mRNA expression in cultured cells. In the present study, we employed an in vitro selection procedure (27.Burke J.M. Berzal-Herranz A. FASEB J. 1993; 7: 106-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 28.Gold L. Allen P. Binkley J., D., B. Schneider D. Eddy S.R. Tuerk C. Green L. MacDougal S. Tasset D. Gesteland R.R. Atkins J.F. The RNA World.

Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1993: 511-533Google Scholar) to isolate highly active M1GS ribozymes from an M1 RNA pool that contained random mutations. Some of the selected ribozymes exhibited at least 10 times higher cleavage efficiency (k cat/K m) than that derived from the wild type ribozyme. When these selected ribozyme variants were expressed in cells infected with HSV-1, a reduction of 95–99% in TK expression was observed. These studies demonstrate the feasibility of developing effective RNase P ribozymes for gene-targeting applications. Ribozyme and Substrate Constructs—All oligonucleotides and the biotinylated RNA substrate tk46 (5′-Biotin-GACCCCUGCCAUCAACACGCG21TCTGCGTTCGAC33 CAGGCTGCGCGGU-3′) were synthesized using a DNA oligonucleotide synthesizer. The 13-nucleotide-long targeting sequence of tk46 (positions 21–33) base pairs with the guide sequence of M1GS RNAs (Fig. 1 C). The sequences upstream and downstream from the targeting sequence are the 5′ leader sequence of 20 nucleotides and 3′ tail sequence of 13 nucleotides, respectively. Plasmid pFL117 and pC102 that contain the DNA sequences encoding the wild type M1 RNA and ribozyme mutant C102, respectively, have been described previously (19.Liu F. Altman S. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 471-480Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar, 31.Kim J.J. Kilani A.F. Zhan X. Altman S. Liu F. RNA. 1997; 3: 613-623PubMed Google Scholar). Plasmid pFL120, pS5, and pTyr contained the DNA sequences that encode the RNA substrate tk46, S5, and ptRNATyr, respectively (19.Liu F. Altman S. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 471-480Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar, 32.Kilani A.F. Liu F. RNA. 1999; 5: 1235-1247Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Substrate S5 was derived from tk46 by replacing every uridine of tk46 with a cytosine and changing C34 to U34. The DNAs that coded for tk46-3 and S5-3 were generated by PCR to replace the entire 13-nucleotide-long 3′ tail sequence of tk46 and S5, respectively, with a thymidine nucleotide. The DNA sequences that code for RNA tk46-5 and tk46-3 were constructed by PCR using pFL120 as the template, AF25 as the 5′ primer, and oligonucleotides olitk46-5 (5′-CCGCGCAGCCTGGTCGAACGCAGACTATAGTGAGTCGTATTA-3′) and olitk46-3 (5′-AGTCGAACGCA-3′) as the 3′ primers, respectively. The DNA sequences that encoded ribozyme C102-R6 and C102-R29 were generated by PCR using oligonucleotide AF25 (5′-GGAATTCTAATACGACTCACTATAG-3′) as the 5′ primer, oligonucleotide C102 (5′-TATGACCATGATTACGCCAAGCTTCAGGTGAAACTGACCGA GAATCATCCTGCTAGCGTGGACAGTCA-3′) as the 3′ primer, pR6 and pR29 as the templates, respectively. The DNA sequences coding for the ribozymes that target substrate S5 and S5-3 were generated by PCR using the DNA sequences coding for the ribozymes that target tk46 as the templates, and AF25 and S5-3-GS (5′-GTGGTGCCCGCGCCCGACTATGACCATG-3′) as the 5′ and 3′ primers, respectively. The procedure to generate the pool of mutagenized M1 RNA sequences is similar to that described previously to generate variant sequences of group I intron ribozymes (33.Joyce G.F. Inoue T. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 711-722PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, plasmid pC102 (31.Kim J.J. Kilani A.F. Zhan X. Altman S. Liu F. RNA. 1997; 3: 613-623PubMed Google Scholar) was digested with E. coli exonuclease III (United States Biochemical Corp.) and annealed to three oligonucleotides, FL111, FL112, and FL113. FL111 (5′-TTCCCCCCCAGGCGTTAcctggcaccctgccctatggagcccggactttcctcCCCTCCGCCCGTC-3′), FL112 (5′-GCCGTACCTTATGAACCcctatttggccttgctccgggtggagtttaccgTGTTACGGACTGTTAC-3′), and FL113 (5′-AAGCTTCAGGTGAAACTGACCgacaagccgggttctgtcgtggacagtcattcatctAGGCCAGCAATCGCT-3′) had 10% probability of mutation in the regions corresponding to positions 61–96, 223–260, and 328–363 of M1 RNA, respectively (Fig.2 A). In these oligonucleotides, the mutated positions (represented as lowercase letters in the sequence) were synthesized in the presence of 90% of the nucleotides specified by the lowercase letter and 3.3% each of the three other nucleotides. T4 DNA polymerase and ligase were added to generate the full-length of DNA sequences that code for the ribozyme. Finally, these DNA molecules were amplified by PCR with 5′ primer Oligo101 (5′-GGAATTCTAATACGACTCACTATAGAAGCTGACCAGACAGTCGCC-3′) and 3′ primer Oligo31 (5′-GTG GTGTCTGCGTTCGACTATGACCATG-3′). Ribozyme molecules were synthesized in vitro from the DNA template with T7 RNA polymerase. Ribozymes (10–100 pmol) that contained randomized mutations were annealed in the annealing buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 100 mm NH4Cl) to the same amount of biotinylated tk46 RNA (Fig. 2 B). This substrate contained a 5′ TK mRNA sequence of 46 nucleotides which has been shown to be accessible to M1GS RNA binding in both human 143tk−cells and murine NIH3T3 cells (19.Liu F. Altman S. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 471-480Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Mg2+ions, which are essential for M1 RNA and RNase P catalysis (12.Guerrier-Takada C. Gardiner K. Marsh T. Pace N. Altman S. Cell. 1983; 35: 849-857Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2035) Google Scholar, 34.Gardiner K.J. Marsh T.L. Pace N.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 5415-5419Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), were omitted from the annealing buffer to prevent cleavage. The streptavidin column (Affinitip) (Genosys Biotechnologies, Inc. Woodlands, TX) was preconditioned according to manufacturer's recommendations with the annealing buffer. The annealed complexes of the ribozyme and 5′-biotinylated tk46 were allowed to bind to a streptavidin column, and all unbound ribozymes were washed away. Mg2+ ions were also omitted from the washing buffer to prevent cleavage. Reaction buffer (buffer A: 50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 100 mm NH4Cl, 100 mmMgCl2) that contained MgCl2 was added to the column to allow the cleavage reaction to proceed. M1 RNA was shown to exhibit optimal cleavage activity in buffer A (12.Guerrier-Takada C. Gardiner K. Marsh T. Pace N. Altman S. Cell. 1983; 35: 849-857Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2035) Google Scholar). Only active ribozymes cleaved their substrates and released themselves from the column, while the ribozymes that were less active remained bound. On average, 10% of the total pool of ribozymes bound to the streptavidin column following annealing to the biotinylated substrate, out of which only 0.05–5% was eluted from the column upon addition of the magnesium-containing cleavage buffer and incubation at 37 °C. Finally, the effluent from the column was loaded on a denaturing gel and active ribozyme molecules were recovered from the gel. cDNA was then synthesized from these RNA molecules with primer Oligo31 in the presence of avian myeloblastosis virus reverse transcriptase and further amplified by error-prone PCR procedures (35.Cadwell R.C. Joyce G.F. PCR Methods Appl. 1992; 2: 28-33Crossref PubMed Scopus (833) Google Scholar) in the presence of primers Oligo101 and Oligo31. The cDNA molecules were then used as the templates for synthesis of ribozyme molecules for the next round of selection. During selection, the activity of the population of each generation was monitored by measuring the overall rate of cleavage (k cat/K m) under single turnover conditions (see “Kinetic Analyses” for assay conditions). This procedure was repeated nine times, until no apparent enhancement of the cleavage rate of the ribozyme population was observed after a short period of incubation (5 min). Incubation times for cycles 1 through 2 , cycles 3 through 4, cycles 5 through 6, and cycles 7–9 were 720, 120, 30, and 5 min, respectively. Following nine cycles of selection, the cDNA was cloned into pUC19 and sequenced. The cleavage reactions of substrates tk46 and ptRNATyr by different ribozymes were carried out in buffer A (50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 100 mmNH4Cl, 100 mm MgCl2) and single-turnover kinetic analyses to determine the values ofk cat/K m were performed as described previously (19.Liu F. Altman S. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 471-480Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar, 31.Kim J.J. Kilani A.F. Zhan X. Altman S. Liu F. RNA. 1997; 3: 613-623PubMed Google Scholar, 32.Kilani A.F. Liu F. RNA. 1999; 5: 1235-1247Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Briefly, analyses were performed with a trace amount of radioactive substrate and an excess of ribozyme. The concentration of radioactive substrate was less than 0.1 nm, and the concentrations of ribozyme tested ranged from 0.5 to100 nm. Variants of the amount of substrate did not affect the observed cleavage rate (k obs) at a fixed excess ribozyme concentrations and the reaction followed pseudo-first-order kinetics. Pseudo-first-order rate constants of cleavage (k obs) were assayed at each ribozyme concentration by the slope of a plot: ln[(Ft −Fe)/(1 − Fe)]versus time using Kaleidagraph program (Synergy Software, Reading, PA). Ft and Fe represent the fraction of the substrate at time t and the end point (>10 h) of the experiments, respectively. The values of the overall cleavage rate (k cat/Km) were calculated by the slope of a least-squares linear regression (Kaleidagraph) of a plot of the values of k obs versus the concentrations of the ribozymes. The experimental procedures to determine the apparent reaction rate constant k app were carried out as described previously (32.Kilani A.F. Liu F. RNA. 1999; 5: 1235-1247Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Briefly, equimolar amounts of substrates and ribozymes were incubated in buffer B (16.6 mm PIPES, 40 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.0, 100 NaCl, 100 mmCaCl2) at 37 °C for 10 min to allow binding. After binding, the bound ribozyme-substrate complexes were separated from the unbound substrates using G-50 Sephadex gel filtration columns (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). The eluate was examined in 5% polyacrylamide nondenaturing gels for the presence of labeled ribozyme-substrate complexes and the concentrations of the complexes were quantitated by a Storm 840 PhosphorImager. Then ribozyme-substrate complexes were diluted in different concentrations (2–70 nm) and incubated in buffer C (16.6 mm PIPES, 40 mmTris-HCl, pH 6.0, 100 NaCl, 100 mm MgCl2) at 37 °C. Aliquots were withdrawn from reaction mixtures at regular intervals (from 0 to 160 min). The cleavage products were separated on 15% denaturing gels, autoradiographed, and quantitated with a Storm 840 PhosphorImager. The apparent rate constant,k app, was calculated by the slope of the plot of ln(S 0/St)versus time, where S 0 equals the initial substrate concentration and St equals the substrate concentration at a given time point. The values obtained were the average of three experiments. Substrates S5 and S5-3, which contained the photoactive 4-thiouridine, were synthesized in the presence of 4-thio-UTP by T7 RNA polymerase. UV cross-linking was carried out as described previously (32.Kilani A.F. Liu F. RNA. 1999; 5: 1235-1247Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar, 36.Wyatt J.R. Sontheimer E.J. Steitz J.A. Genes Dev. 1992; 6: 2542-2553Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). Briefly, radiolabeled RNA substrates (20–50 nm) were incubated with ribozymes (20–50 nm) in buffer D (50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 100 mm NH4Cl, 100 mmCaCl2) for 5 min at 25 °C. Then, the reaction mixture was exposed to UV light (365 nm) on ice for 15 min. The cross-linked species were separated in denaturing gels and further purified. Primer extension analyses of the cross-linked species were carried out using primer AK3(265–282) (5′-ACGGGCCGTACCTTATG-3′). The primer extension products were separated in denaturing gels and quantitated with a Storm 840 PhosphorImager. The procedures to measure the equilibrium dissociation constants (K d) of complexes of the ribozymes and the substrates were modified from Pyle et al.(37.Pyle A.M. McSwiggen J.A. Cech T.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. 1990; 87: 8187-8191Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). In brief, various concentrations of ribozyme (0.0005–50 nm) were preincubated in buffer E (50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 100 mm NH4Cl, 100 mmCaCl2, 3% glycerol, 0.1% xylene cyanol, 0.1% bromphenol blue) for 10 min before mixing with an equal volume of 1–10 pm substrate RNA preheated under identical conditions. The samples were incubated for 10–120 min to allow binding, then loaded on a 5% polyacrylamide gel, and run at 10 watts. The electrophoresis running buffer contained 100 mm Tris-Hepes, pH 7.5, and 10 mm MgCl2 (37.Pyle A.M. McSwiggen J.A. Cech T.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. 1990; 87: 8187-8191Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). The value ofK d was then extrapolated from a graph plotting percentage of product bound versus ribozyme concentration. The values were the average of three experiments. Retroviral constructs RvM1-TK, RvΔM1-TK, RvC102-TK, RvC102-R6, RvC102-R29, RvR6, and RvR29 were constructed by placing the DNA sequences that coded for M1-TK, ΔM1-TK, C102-TK, C102-R6, C102-R29, R6, and R29 under the control of the U6 promoter in the LXSN retroviral vector, respectively (19.Liu F. Altman S. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 471-480Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar, 38.Miller A.D. Rosman G.J. BioTechniques. 1989; 7: 980-990PubMed Google Scholar). Cells that contained the M1GS-retroviral DNA sequence were generated as described previously (19.Liu F. Altman S. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 471-480Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar, 38.Miller A.D. Rosman G.J. BioTechniques. 1989; 7: 980-990PubMed Google Scholar). Those cells that expressed high levels of ribozymes were cloned and expanded in media that contained 600 μg/ml neomycin (G418). The level of M1GS RNA expression in individual cell clone was determined by an RNase protection assay with a probe complementary to the 5′ region of M1 RNA sequence (nucleotides 1–60) (19.Liu F. Altman S. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 471-480Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Only those cell clones that expressed similar levels of ribozymes were used for subsequent experiments. Finally, aliquots of the cell clones were either frozen for long-term storage in liquid nitrogen or used for further studies in tissue culture. Approximately 106 cells in a T25 flask were either mock-infected or infected with HSV-1 in 1.5 ml of Medium 199 at a multiplicity of infection as specified under “Results.” At 8 h after infection, cells were harvested and RNA and protein extracts were prepared as described previously (39.Liu F. Roizman B. J. Virol. 1991; 65: 5149-5156Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The RNA probes used to detect TK mRNA and the transcripts of the α47, Us10, and Us11 genes were synthesized from pTK129 and pTK141, respectively. Plasmid pTK129 and pTK141 were constructed, respectively, by placing the 87-nucleotide-long BglII-MluI fragment from pTK101 and the 181-nucleotide-long BamHI-AccI fragment from pRB4059 under the control of bacteriophage T3 RNA polymerase promoter. These two fragments correspond to the sequences encoding the 5′ sequence of TK mRNA and of the overlapping transcripts for HSV-1 α47, Us10, and Us11 genes, respectively (40.McGeoch D.J. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 1989; 43: 235-265Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). RNase protection assays were performed as described previously (19.Liu F. Altman S. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 471-480Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). The protected RNA products were separated in 8% urea/polyacrylamide denaturing gels, and quantitated with a Storm 840 PhosphorImager. The denatured, solubilized polypeptides from cell lysates were separated on 9% (v/v) SDS-polyacrylamide gels cross-linked withN,N′-methylenebisacrylamide. The separated polypeptides were transferred electrically to nitrocellulose membranes and reacted in an enzyme-linked immunoassay with either anti-mouse or anti-rabbit IgG conjugated with alkaline phosphatase in addition to the antibodies against HSV-1 TK or ICP35. The membranes were subsequently stained with a chemiluminescent substrate with the aid of a Western chemiluminescent substrate kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and quantitated with a Storm 840 PhosphorImager. Quantitation was performed in the linear range of RNA and protein detection. The RNA substrate tk46 used in the selection experiments contains a 5′ TK mRNA sequence of 46 nucleotides (Fig. 1 C). This sequence has been shown to be accessible to modification by dimethyl sulfate and, in addition, to ribozyme binding in mammalian cell culture (19.Liu F. Altman S. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 471-480Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). A pool of ribozyme variants was constructed by introducing mutations into three discrete regions of M1 RNA with a 10% probability of mutation from the wild type M1 RNA sequence. The three regions (i.e. nucleotides 61–96, 223–260, and 328–363) included most of the positions that are conserved among all known RNase P catalytic RNAs and are probably involved in catalysis (Fig.2 A) (13.Chen J.L. Nolan J.M. Harris M.E. Pace N.R. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 1515-1525Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar, 15.Haas E.S. Brown J.W. Pitulle C. Pace N.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Previous studies have indicated that ribozyme variants with mutations at some of these regions exhibited higher cleavage activity than the wild type ribozyme (10.Altman S. Kirsebom L.A.

C102, the ribozyme used to construct the mutant pool, contained several point mutations (e.g.A347C348 → CU, C353C354C355G356 → GGAU) at the catalytic domain (P4 helix) (31.Kim J.J. Kilani A.F. Zhan X. Altman S. Liu F. RNA. 1997; 3: 613-623PubMed Google Scholar). This mutant was at least 104-fold less active than M1 RNA in cleaving a ptRNA (31.Kim J.J. Kilani A.F. Zhan X. Altman S. Liu F. RNA. 1997; 3: 613-623PubMed Google Scholar). Con"

It mainly functions by interacting with cellular transcription factors and the KIX domain of the p300/CBP coactivators. Tax can also repress the transcription of cellular genes through the basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) protein family. To investigate the molecular mechanisms of this Tax-mediated inhibition, we analyzed its effect on the transcriptional activity of the myogenic MyoD protein, which was used as a paradigm of bHLH factors. In this study, we show that overexpression of the p300 coactivator in transient transfection assays was sufficient to rescue MyoD repression by Tax. Furthermore, an N-terminal domain of p300 (amino acids 379–654) containing the region of KIX serving as the Tax binding site was found, when overexpressed, to potentiate Tax-mediated transactivation of HTLV-1 proviral as well as MyoD-dependent transcription, and to antagonize the inhibition by Tax of the transcriptional activity of MyoD. These results revealing the presence of an N-terminal MyoD binding site were confirmed by in vitro protein-protein interaction assays that demonstrate that MyoD binds to the KIX domain of p300 and that Tax competes with MyoD binding in a nonreciprocal manner. These observations provide evidence that Tax binding to the KIX domain of p300 prevents bHLH proteins from contacting this N-terminal domain of the coactivator, thus resulting in their transcriptional repression. As bHLH proteins are implicated in many developmental fate decisions, especially during thymopoiesis, Tax-mediated inhibition of their transcriptional activity may contribute to the induction of HTLV-1-linked leukemogenesis.

Biological and molecular studies have underlined the essential role of the viral regulatory Tax protein in the virus life cycle and in the development of HTLV-1-linked pathologies. This 40-kDa nuclear phosphoprotein behaves as a transcriptional activator that up-regulates proviral transcription, driven by the HTLV-1 5′ long terminal repeat (LTR). In addition, Tax has been shown to activate the expression of an array of cellular genes, most of them being implicated in T cell activation and proliferation (for reviews, see Refs. 7.Yoshida M. J. Acquired Immune Defic. Syndr. Hum. Retrovirol. 1996; 13, Suppl. 1: 63-68Crossref Scopus (24) Google Scholar and 8.Yoshida M. Suzuki T. Fujisawa J. Hirai H. Curr. Top. Microbiol. Immunol. 1995; 193: 79-89PubMed Google Scholar). Tax also induces cell proliferation by altering the activity of cell cycle regulators (9.Neuveut C. Low K.G. Maldarelli F. Schmitt I. Majone F.

Finally, Tax down-regulates the expression of cellular genes, such as lck, DNA polymerase β, and tumor suppressor genes NF-1 and p53 (13.Koga Y. Oh-Hori N. Sato H. Yamamoto N. Kimura G. Nomoto K. J. Immunol. 1989; 142: 4493-4499PubMed Google Scholar, 14.Feigenbaum L. Fujita K. Collins F.S. Jay G. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 3280-3285Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 15.Jeang K.-T. Widen S.G.

Thus, the involvement of Tax in altering cell cycle progression is correlated with its physical interaction with cyclin D, the mitotic checkpoint regulator MAD1, the cyclin-dependent kinases Cdk4 and Cdk6, and the Cdk inhibitor p16INK4a (9.Neuveut C.

Likewise, Tax stimulates transcription by interacting with a number of different transcription factors, such as cyclic AMP response element-binding protein/activating transcription factor (CREB/ATF), NF-κB, and p67 serum-responsive factor (20.Zhao L.-J. Giam C.-Z. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 11445-11449Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar, 21.Fujii M. Chuhjo T. Minamino T. Masaaki N. Miyamoto K. Seiki M.

Oncogene. 1993; 8: 2391-2397PubMed Google Scholar). By interacting with CREB/ATF, Tax favors the recruitment of these Tax-CREB/ATF complexes to the three 21-base pair repeats located in the U3 region of the 5′ LTR. These Tax response elements, which contain nonconsensus CREB response elements, are involved in Tax-activated proviral transcription (20.Zhao L.-J. Giam C.-Z. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 11445-11449Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar,24.Giebler H.A. Loring J.E. van Orden K. Colgin M.A. Garrus J.E. Escudero K.W. Brauweiler A. Nyborg J.K. Mol. Cell.

Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 7070-7074Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar). This transactivation also requires the recruitment by Tax of the related multifunctional cellular coactivators CBP (CREB-binding protein) and p300. This recruitment is favored by the high affinity binding of Tax to a region contained in the KIX domain located in the N terminus of these coactivators (28.Yan J.P. Garrus J.E. Giebler H.A. Stargell L.A. Nyborg J.K. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 281: 395-400Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 29.Kwok R.P. Laurance M.E. Lundblad J.R. Goldman P.S. Shih H. Connor L.M. Marriott S.J. Goodman R.H. Nature. 1996; 380: 642-646Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar). Furthermore, by contacting the GC-rich DNA sequences flanking the Tax response element, Tax allows the formation of a stable quaternary complex Tax response element-CREB/ATF-Tax-CBP/p300 (24.Giebler H.A. Loring J.E. van Orden K. Colgin M.A. Garrus J.E. Escudero K.W. Brauweiler A. Nyborg J.K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 5156-5164Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar, 30.Lenzmeier B.A. Giebler H.A. Nyborg J.K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 721-731Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, Tax functions as an adaptor between CREB/ATF and the coactivators CBP/p300, bypassing the need for CREB/ATF phosphorylation. An analogous mechanism was proposed for the Tax-dependent activation through the NFκB pathway (31.Bex F. Yin M.-J. Burny A. Gaynor R.B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 2392-2405Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Tax interacts directly with p50 and RelA and with the p300 coactivator, and serves as a bridging molecule between DNA-bound NFκB and p300 (22.Lacoste J. Lanoix J. Pepin N. Hiscott J. Leukemia. 1994; 8, Suppl. 1: 71-76Google Scholar, 29.Kwok R.P. Laurance M.E. Lundblad J.R. Goldman P.S. Shih H. Connor L.M. Marriott S.J. Goodman R.H. Nature. 1996; 380: 642-646Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar).Concerning the molecular mechanisms by which Tax serves as a transcriptional inhibitor, the few studies devoted to this issue have shown that Tax represses the expression of cellular genes through the basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) transcription factors, which bind to the consensus sequence (CANNTG), referred to as E-box (15.Jeang K.-T. Widen S.G. Semmes O.J., IV Wilson S.H. Science. 1990; 247: 1082-1084Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar, 16.Lemasson I. Robert-Hebmann V. Hamaia S. Duc Dodon M. Gazzolo L. Devaux C. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 1975-1983Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 17.Uittenbogaard M.N. Giebler H., A. Reisman D. Nyborg J.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 28503-28506Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Indeed, deletion of the E-box in the promoter of the lck gene inhibits the trans-repressing effect of Tax (16.Lemasson I. Robert-Hebmann V. Hamaia S. Duc Dodon M. Gazzolo L. Devaux C. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 1975-1983Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, to date, the bHLH factors implicated in the transcription of these genes have not been identified. Consequently, to approach the molecular mechanisms of the Tax-mediated inhibition of the bHLH-dependent transcriptional activity, we have relied on the myogenic bHLH factor MyoD encoded by a master gene activating muscle-specific genes (32.Davis R.L. Weintraub H. Lassar A.B. Cell. 1987; 51: 987-1000Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2437) Google Scholar). During myogenesis, this protein up-regulates the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p21, thus inducing permanent cell cycle arrest. MyoD also activates muscle-specific gene transcription, through E-box binding as an heterodimer with ubiquitous bHLH (E12 and E47) proteins (for reviews, see Refs. 33.Lassar A.B. Munsterberg A. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1994; 6: 432-442Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar and 34.Lassar A.B. Skapek S.X. Novitch B. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1994; 6: 788-794Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar). Recently, a number of studies have reported that the CBP/p300 coactivators potentiate MyoD dependent transcription and that MyoD-CBP/p300 interactions are critical for MyoD activity during muscle cell differentiation (35.Eckner R. Yao T.P. Oldread E. Livingston D.M. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 2478-2490Crossref PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar, 36.Sartorelli V. Huang J. Hamamori Y. Kedes L. Mol. Cell.

EMBO J. 1997; 16: 369-383Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar).In the present study, we first show that Tax inhibits the transcriptional activity of MyoD and demonstrate that Tax-CBP/p300 interactions are critical for Tax repression of MyoD-dependent transcription. Indeed, p300, when overexpressed, is able to overcome the inhibitory effect of Tax. We also find that a 275-amino acid (aa) N-terminal domain of p300 encompassing aa 379–654 (p300379–654) potentiates MyoD transcriptional activity and counteracts Tax-mediated inhibition of MyoD-dependent transcription. Finally, Tax and MyoD compete for binding to the 226 aa KIX domain of p300 (encompassing aa 436–662) overlapping the Tax binding region (29.Kwok R.P. Laurance M.E. Lundblad J.R. Goldman P.S. Shih H. Connor L.M. Marriott S.J. Goodman R.H. Nature. 1996; 380: 642-646Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar, 31.Bex F. Yin M.-J. Burny A. Gaynor R.B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 2392-2405Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). These results reveal the presence of a MyoD binding site in the KIX domain. They indicate that Tax inhibits MyoD-dependent transcription by competing with MyoD for binding to this N-terminal domain. They propose that Tax, by preventing the binding of bHLH factors to the p300/CBP coactivators, behaves as a transcriptional repressor.DISCUSSIONStudies of the lymphoproliferative effects of HTLV-1 infection have revealed the pivotal role of the viral tax gene product. Indeed, this 40-kDa nuclear phosphoprotein has been shown totrans-activate not only proviral transcription, but also the expression of several cellular genes. This transcriptional activation is mediated through its interactions with cellular transcription factors, including members of the CREB/ATF and the NFκB/Rel family, as well as the serum response factor (7.Yoshida M.

Previous observations have shown that thistrans-repressing effect on the expression of p56 lck, p53, or the β-polymerase genes occurs via E-box sequences recognized by the bHLH transcription factors (15.Jeang K.-T.

Chem. 1995; 270: 28503-28506Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar), which comprise ubiquitous and cell type-specific proteins. Among the latter, the best studied factor is the myogenic bHLH MyoD protein. When introduced into fibroblasts, MyoD commits these cells to acquire the muscle phenotype (32.Davis R.L. Weintraub H. Lassar A.B. Cell. 1987; 51: 987-1000Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2437) Google Scholar) by binding to E-boxes present in the enhancer of muscle-specific genes (see Refs. 33.Lassar A.B. Munsterberg A. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1994; 6: 432-442Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar and 34.Lassar A.B. Skapek S.X. Novitch B. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1994; 6: 788-794Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar for reviews). In this present study, we have addressed the molecular mechanisms of the Tax-mediated repression of the transcriptional activity of MyoD. We observed that both Tax and MyoD bind to the KIX domain of the coactivator p300. We then demonstrate that Tax binding to the KIX domain of p300 prevents MyoD from contacting this N-terminal domain of the coactivator, thus resulting in the repression of the transcriptional activity of this bHLH protein.The observed Tax-dependent transcriptional inhibition is not linked to an impairment of MyoD binding to E-box sequences, as we (data not shown) and others did not observe such an effect by electrophoretic mobility shift assay analysis (16.Lemasson I. Robert-Hebmann V. Hamaia S. Duc Dodon M. Gazzolo L. Devaux C. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 1975-1983Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 50.Wagner S. Green M.R. Science. 1993; 262: 395-399Crossref PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar). Furthermore, in monohybrid experiments, Tax was shown to inhibit the transcriptional activation mediated by the Gal4-MyoD fusion protein, indicating that this inhibitory effect is exclusively due to an alteration of protein-protein interactions. No direct interaction of Tax with MyoD could be demonstrated by in vivo co-immunoprecipitation assays (data not shown). This correlates with the lack of interactions observed between Tax and the bHLH proteins using the double-hybrid system in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. 2I. Lemasson and J. M. Mesnard, personal communication. Thus, Tax-MyoD interactions cannot account for this Tax-mediated inhibitory effect.Consequently, we next investigated whether the interaction of Tax with the transcriptional coactivator p300 is involved in the repression of the transcriptional activity of MyoD. We first showed that p300 overexpression antagonizes the Tax trans-repressing effect. This observation therefore underlines that the interaction of Tax with the coactivator appears to be necessary and sufficient to promote the inhibitory effect of this viral regulatory protein. We have next used, in transient transfection assays, a vector expressing a region of p300, containing amino acids 379–654 (p300379–654) overlapping the KIX domain which contains the Tax binding region (29.Kwok R.P. Laurance M.E. Lundblad J.R. Goldman P.S. Shih H. Connor L.M. Marriott S.J. Goodman R.H. Nature. 1996; 380: 642-646Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar). We found that the overexpression of this polypeptide derived from the N terminus of p300 potentiates MyoD-dependent transcription and counteracts Tax-induced repression of the transcriptional activity of the bHLH protein. The ability of this subdomain to activate MyoD-dependent transcription strongly suggests that it contains a MyoD binding site. Indeed, the p300379–654domain is part of a larger N-terminal domain, which has been shown to represent an autonomous transcriptional activation region, due to its interaction with TATA-binding proteins (37.Yuan W. Condorelli G. Caruso M. Felsani A. Giordano A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 9009-9013Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar), and to contain a putative MyoD binding site (36.Sartorelli V. Huang J. Hamamori Y. Kedes L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 1010-1026Crossref PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar). We indeed showed that a MyoD binding site is present in a region (encompassing amino acids 436–662 of p300) corresponding to the KIX domain (29.Kwok R.P. Laurance M.E. Lundblad J.R. Goldman P.S. Shih H. Connor L.M. Marriott S.J. Goodman R.H. Nature. 1996; 380: 642-646Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar). The direct interaction of MyoD with this p300 subdomain was observed either with MyoD present in extracts from myotubes, or with a recombinant bacterially purified MyoD-His protein. Finally, we observed that Tax inhibits MyoD binding to this N-terminal MyoD binding site and thereby makes the coactivator unavailable to this bHLH transcription factor. A similar observation was recently reported showing that Tax inhibits the transcriptional activity of ubiquitous bHLH proteins by interfering with the recruitment of CBP/p300 onto E-boxes (51.Suzuki T. Uchida-Toita M. Yoshida M. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 4137-4143Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). This and our observations therefore underline that Tax functions in the inhibition of the transcriptional activity of bHLH proteins by preventing their access to coactivators.Such a competition between two transcription pathways using the same coactivator has already been found to occur in a mutually exclusive manner (cross-coupling), mainly as a consequence of the limiting amount of CBP/p300 in cells. This competition does not require an identical or overlapping binding site on the coactivator and has been described for several cellular pathways, such as the nuclear receptor and AP-1, p53 and E2F, NFκB and p53, NFκB and nuclear receptor, NFκB and Stat2, Jak-Stat and AP-1 pathways (52.Lee C.-W.

Likewise, Tax, when overexpressed, was found to repress the transcriptional activity of c-Myb and c-Jun, whereas the overexpression of the two cellular factors led to the inhibition of Tax-mediated transcription (58.Golgin M.A. Nyborg J.K. J. Virol. 1998; 72: 9396-9399Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 59.Van Orden K. Yan J.P. Ulloa A. Nyborg J.K. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 3766-3772Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Both cellular factors and the viral protein have been shown to interact with the KIX domain of CBP and to compete for KIX binding in vitro. In the present study, we show that a cross-coupling mechanism is not operating between MyoD and Tax. Indeed, despite the ability of MyoD to interact with the KIX domain of p300, this bHLH protein is unable to compete with Tax for KIX binding. This observation correlates with the indication that MyoD is unable in vivo to antagonize the transcriptional activity of Tax.Collectively, these findings led us to propose the following model for Tax inhibition of MyoD-dependent transcription (Fig.7). In a muscle gene enhancer, one molecule of p300 is able to interact with two MyoD/E2A heterodimers by its two binding sites, one in the C/H3 region and the other in the KIX domain. Indeed, several E-boxes are present in the enhancer of muscle genes, (such as those from MCK, MLC, MHC genes). Likewise, a MyoD enhancer activates the minimal tk promoter only when at least two E-boxes are present (39.Weintraub H. Davis R. Lockshon D. Lassar A.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 5623-5627Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). Moreover, the ternary p300/MyoD/E-box complex can be observed by electrophoretic mobility shift assay, only when the DNA probe used contains two neighboring E-boxes (35.Eckner R. Yao T.P. Oldread E. Livingston D.M. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 2478-2490Crossref PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar). Consequently, the HTLV-1 Tax protein represses MyoD-dependent transcription because of its ability to disrupt the MyoD-p300 interaction at only one binding site of MyoD to p300. The same model may apply to explain the inhibition of MyoD-dependent transcription by DNA virus oncoproteins, like E1A or large T antigens of SV40 and polyoma viruses. These oncoproteins bind to the C/H3 domain, thus competing with MyoD for p300 binding (60.Lundblad J.R. Kwok R.P. Laurance M.E. Harter M.L. Goodman R.H. Nature. 1995; 374: 85-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (531) Google Scholar, 61.Sandmöller A. Meents H. Arnold H.H. Mol. Cell.

Nature. 1988; 332: 553-557Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Accordingly, the competition of these oncoproteins with MyoD for p300 binding is linked to their ability to prevent the interaction of one molecule of p300 with two MyoD/E2A heterodimers bound to two neighboring E-boxes.During muscle cell differentiation, the MyoD protein acts on both levels of cell proliferation and differentiation. MyoD induces the expression of the cyclin inhibitor p21 on one hand, and initiates a transcriptional cascade leading to the expression of muscle-specific genes on the other hand (see Refs. 33.Lassar A.B. Munsterberg A. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1994; 6: 432-442Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar and 34.Lassar A.B. Skapek S.X. Novitch B. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1994; 6: 788-794Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar for reviews). Thus, by inhibiting the activity of a protein such as MyoD, Tax simultaneously promotes cell proliferation and inhibits cell differentiation, further strengthening that this regulatory protein acts at multiple control levels to induce cell immortalization (for a review, see Ref. 11.Mesnard J.M. Devaux C. Virology. 1999; 257: 277-284Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). We could also hypothesize that, by a similar mechanism, Tax interferes with the transcriptional activity of other bHLH transcription factors involved in the control of the proliferation and differentiation pathways of HTLV-1 target T cells. Therefore, the present observations may provide clues on mechanisms linking HTLV-1 infection, Tax-mediated T cell transformation, and HTLV-1-associated leukemogenesis. Indeed, we and others have proposed that target cells for the leukemogenic activity of this retrovirus may be recruited among immature thymocytes (65.Maguer V. Cassé-Ripoll H. Gazzolo L. Duc Dodon M. J. Virol. 1993; 69: 5529-5537Crossref Google Scholar, 66.Maguer-Satta V. Gazzolo L. Duc Dodon M. Blood. 1995; 86: 1444-1452Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 67.Feuer G. Fraser J.K. Zack J.A. Lee F. Feuer R. Chen I.S. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 4038-4044Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, the bHLH transcription factors are known to play a pivotal role in T cell development. For example, the number of thymocytes in E2A knockout mice is dramatically reduced and these mice develop malignant T cell lymphoma, at 2 months (68.Bain G. Engel I. Robanus Maandag E.C.

Together, these intermediate signals stimulate a variety of downstream biological pathways, such as glycogen synthesis, glucose transport, gene expression, and mitogenesis.

Gab-1 shares functional and structural homology with the IRS family of proteins, including an N-terminal pleckstrin homology (PH) domain, several tyrosine phosphorylation sites, and two potential SH3 binding proline-rich regions.

Previous studies in our laboratory have demonstrated a specific role for IRS-1 in insulin and IGF-1-mediated signaling (23.Kahn C.R. Krieger D.T. Bardin C.W. Current Therapy in Endocrinology. B. C. Decker Publishers, Philadelphia1983Google Scholar). Thus, although there is a high degree of homology and structural similarity among the IRS family members, cells with a homozygous deficiency of IRS-1 show a reduced mitogenic response that cannot be recovered by the overexpression of IRS-2 (23.Kahn C.R. Krieger D.T. Bardin C.W. Current Therapy in Endocrinology. B. C. Decker Publishers, Philadelphia1983Google Scholar). These data highlight the potential for specific IRS proteins to uniquely mediate distinct downstream biological events. In the present study, we have investigated the role of Gab-1 in mediating IGF-1 signaling by overexpressing Gab-1 in IRS-1-deficient 3T3 fibroblasts by retroviral mediated gene transfer. Our studies revealed that Gab-1 overexpression produces a unique pattern of downstream signals in IRS-1-deficient fibroblasts, despite an absence of detectable IGF-1-stimulated tyrosine phosphorylation, suggesting a novel role and mechanism for this substrate in insulin/IGF-1 action. Human recombinant IGF-1 was purchased from Peprotech Inc.(Rocky Hill, NJ). The Gab-1 cDNA was a generous gift of Albert Wong (Kimmel Cancer Institute, Philadelphia, PA). Polyclonal antibodies to Gab-1 and IRS-2 and monoclonal antibody to phosphotyrosine were a generous gift from Morris F. White (Joslin Diabetes Center, Boston, MA). Antibodies to MAP kinase and IRS-1 were prepared as described previously (24.Cheatham B. Wang L. Bruning J.C. Diabetes. 1996; 44, Suppl. 1 (abstr.): 81Google Scholar). The cDNA for murineegr-1 was generously provided by B. Spiegleman (Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, MA). Sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS)-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) reagents were from Bio-Rad; medium and supplements were purchased from Life Technologies, Inc.; fetal bovine serum was from Sigma; and nitrocellulose used for Western blots and nylon membrane used for Northern blots were purchased from Schleicher & Schuell. Female mice from breeding pairs of IRS-1+/− mice were sacrificed at day 16.5 postconception. Embryos were dissected from the uterus, and extra embryonic membranes, as well as viscera and heads, were removed. The embryos were soaked overnight in 0.25% trypsin-EDTA at 4 °C. Meanwhile, the genotype of the embryos was determined by using DNA extracted from the removed tissues by polymerase chain reaction as described previously (25.Araki E. Lipes M.A. Patti M.E. Brüning J.C. Haag III, B.L. Johnson R.S. Kahn C.R. Nature. 1994; 372: 186-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (1095) Google Scholar). The following day, the tryptic digest was activated at 37 °C for 15 min and then inactivated by the addition of 10 ml of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% fetal bovine serum. Cells were then suspended by extensive pipetting, counted, and plated at a density of 106/cm2 in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. Adherent cells were allowed to reach confluency once and then passaged according to the 3T3 protocol of Todaro and Green (26.Todaro G.J. Green H. J. Cell Biol. 1963; 17: 299-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (2004) Google Scholar). The reconstitution of IRS-1 in IRS-1−/− 3T3 cell lines was achieved as described previously (23.Kahn C.R. Krieger D.T. Bardin C.W. Current Therapy in Endocrinology. B. C. Decker Publishers, Philadelphia1983Google Scholar). To overexpress Gab-1 in IRS-1−/− 3T3 cell lines, a retroviral expression vector was constructed by inserting a blunt-ended XbaI and HpaI fragment from pBSGab-1 into the SnaBI site of pBabe. The correct orientation of the insert was monitored by BamHI digestion and partial sequence analysis. BOSC 23 cells were transiently transfected with 20 μg of plasmid DNA/10-cm diameter dish. Cells were refed 12–16 h after transfection, and Polybrene (8 μg/ml)-supplemented virus-containing supernatant was transferred to the target cells 48 h after transfection. After an overnight infection period, target cells were refed. Selection was begun by using 2.5 μg of puromycin (Sigma)/ml 48 h after infection. A C-terminal fragment of human Gab-1 (amino acids 600–694) was expressed as a glutathioneS-transferase fusion protein. This purified fragment was then used as antigen for the immunization of rabbits. For stimulation of IGF-1- and EGF-mediated responses, cells were serum-starved overnight in medium containing 0.1% bovine serum albumin and then exposed to IGF-1 or EGF at a final concentration of 10 nm or 20 ng/ml, respectively, unless noted otherwise, in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 0.1% bovine serum albumin for the indicated times. Protein extracts were prepared using buffer A (50 mm HEPES (pH 7.5), 150 mmNaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 2 mmNa3VO4, 20 mmNa4P2O2, 100 mm NaF, 1% Triton X-100, 2 mm phenylmethylsulphonyl fluoride, 20 μg of aprotinin/ml) for 15 min at 4 °C, and insoluble protein was removed by centrifugation at 12,000 rpm in a microcentrifuge. Protein content was measured by the method of Bradford. The extract was then resolved directly in SDS-polyacrylamide gels after boiling in Laemmli SDS sample buffer or subjected to immunoprecipitation with the indicated antibodies. For immunoprecipitation, 1 mg of cellular protein was incubated with the indicated antibodies for 2 h at 4 °C. Immunocomplexes were collected by adding 50 μl of a 50% slurry of protein A-Sepharose (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) in phosphate-buffered saline for 1 h at 4 °C. After two washes in buffer A containing 0.1% SDS, protein complexes were liberated from beads by boiling in SDS sample buffer for 3 min. Proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose. Immunodetection was performed after the membranes were blocked for 2 h at room temperature in 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 137 mm NaCl, 0.05% Tween-20, 3% bovine serum albumin followed by incubation with the appropriate antibody at the indicated concentration for 2 h at room temperature. Specifically bound primary antibodies were detected with 125I-protein A and autoradiography. Two hundred micrograms of cellular protein was subjected to immunoprecipitation with a polyclonal antiserum to ERK-1 and ERK-2, and immunocomplexes were collected with protein A-Sepharose beads. After two washes in lysis buffer and two washes in 50 mm HEPES, 10 mm MgCl2(pH 7.4), beads were resuspended in 30 μl of reaction buffer, and the reactions were started by the addition of 2 μCi of [γ]ATP, 100 μm ATP, 2 μm protein kinase C inhibitor (Sigma), and 5 μg of myelin basic protein (Sigma). Reactions were allowed to proceed for 15 min at 30 °C and stopped by the addition of 12 μl of 5× Laemmli sample buffer; the reaction mixtures were boiled for 5 min, resolved by SDS-PAGE (12% gel), electroblotted onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes, and exposed to autoradiography. Bands of labeled substrates were quantified with a Molecular Dynamics densitometer. Northern blot analysis was performed according to standard techniques in denaturing formaldehyde containing agarose gels. After stimulation with 10 nm IGF-1 for the indicated time, total cellular RNA was isolated by using RNAzol B; 10–20 μg of RNA was subjected to electrophoresis in 1% agarose gels. Ethidium bromide staining of the gels confirmed equal loading and integrity of the RNA. After transfer to nylon membrane, blots were hybridized with the indicated probe. A probe specific for IRS-1 was generated by the directional cloning of anEcoRI/SalI fragment corresponding to the C-terminal 1010 base pairs of murine IRS-1 into pBluescript. A probe specific for IRS-2 was generated by polymerase chain reaction amplification of the C-terminal 970 base pairs (3100–4070) of murine IRS-2 and subsequent cloning into the PCRII cloning vector. A Gab-1-specific probe corresponding to the first 1679 base pairs of human Gab-1 was constructed by XhoI digestion of pBSGab-1 and subsequent vector religation. Egr-1 expression was assessed using a full-length cDNA to the human egr-1gene. All probes used for Northern blot analysis were labeled using a random primed labeling kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). After an overnight incubation at 42 °C, blots were washed three times in 1× SSC (1× SSC is 0.15 m NaCl plus 0.015 m sodium citrate), 0.1% SDS for 20 min each time at room temperature and for 30 min in 0.1× SSC, 0.1%SDS at 52 °C. Filters were air dried and subjected to autoradiography. Cells were plated at a density of 2 × 105/well in 24-well dishes. After 1 day, the medium was changed to Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 0.1% insulin-free bovine serum albumin for 72 h. The cells were then stimulated with the indicated concentrations of IGF-1 for 16 h and pulsed with 2 μCi of [methyl-3H]thymidine (NEN Life Science Products )/well for 1 h at 37 °C. After two washes with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline, cells were lysed for 1 h in 0.1% SDS. Trichloroacetate-precipitable DNA was then counted for incorporated radioactivity. All assays were performed in triplicate. IRS-1-deficient 3T3 cells were established from embryonic fibroblasts derived from IRS-1-deficient mice (23.Kahn C.R. Krieger D.T. Bardin C.W. Current Therapy in Endocrinology. B. C. Decker Publishers, Philadelphia1983Google Scholar). As described previously, these cells have a reduced response to IGF-1-stimulated mitogenesis and early gene expression (23.Kahn C.R. Krieger D.T. Bardin C.W. Current Therapy in Endocrinology. B. C. Decker Publishers, Philadelphia1983Google Scholar). To investigate the potential role of Gab-1 in IGF-1-mediated signaling, we overexpressed Gab-1 (KO+Gab-1) or IRS-1 (KO+IRS-1) in these IRS-1−/− 3T3 cell lines by retroviral mediated gene transduction. By Northern blot analysis, no IRS-1 message could be detected in IRS-1 KO or KO+Gab-1 cells using a probe specific for IRS-1, whereas in KO cells reconstituted with IRS-1 using retroviral mediated gene transfer, a transcript of 9.0 kilobases corresponding to the human IRS-1 mRNA could be easily detected (Fig. 1 A). Northern blot analysis using an IRS-2-specific probe indicated that all cell lines expressed equivalent levels of IRS-2 message. On parallel blots of total RNA, no Gab-1 message was detected in IRS-1−/−cells either before or after IRS-1 expression using a probe specific for human Gab-1. By contrast, a 4.2-kilobase transcript corresponding to Gab-1 mRNA was easily detected in KO cells transfected with Gab-1. The level of protein expression of IRS-1, IRS-2, and Gab-1 was assessed by Western blot analysis on cell lysates of the same cells. Consistent with Northern blot analysis, immunoblotting using an antibody specific to the C-terminal region of IRS-1 confirmed the absence of IRS-1 protein in KO and KO+Gab-1 cells as well as the reconstitution of IRS-1 in KO+IRS-1 cell lines (Fig.1 B). By contrast, all cell lines expressed equivalent levels of IRS-2 protein, as determined by Western blot analysis with anti-IRS-2 antibodies. Immunoblots probed with an antibody raised against the C terminus of Gab-1 indicated the presence of low endogenous expression of Gab-1 in KO and KO+IRS-1 cells and a 3.4-fold overexpression of human Gab-1 when compared with KO and KO+IRS-1 cell lines. These data confirm the reconstitution of IRS-1 and the overexpression of Gab-1 in KO+IRS-1 and KO+Gab-1 cell lines, respectively, and indicate that no alterations in the level of IRS-2 protein expression resulted from the reconstitution of IRS-1 or overexpression of Gab-1. To determine whether Gab-1 is capable of becoming phosphorylated on tyrosine residues in response to IGF-1 stimulation, whole cell lysates from IGF-1 and EGF stimulated KO; KO+IRS-1 and KO+Gab-1 cell lines were subjected to immunoprecipitation using antiphosphotyrosine antibody and immunoblotting with anti-Gab-1 antibodies. In KO+Gab-1 cells, some basal tyrosine phosphorylation of Gab-1 could be observed (Fig.2 A). Stimulation with EGF rapidly and markedly increased the level of Gab-1 phosphorylation (18.Holgado-Madruga M. Emlet D.R. Moscatello D.K. Godwin A.K. Wong A.J. Nature. 1996; 379: 560-563Crossref PubMed Scopus (601) Google Scholar,19.Lehr S. Kotzka J. Herkner A. Klein E. Siethoff C. Knebel B. Noelle V. Bruning J.C. Klein H.W. Meyer H.E. Krone W. Muller-Wieland D. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 151-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). In addition, this phosphorylation resulted in decreased mobility of the protein on SDS-PAGE. In contrast, the level of tyrosine phosphorylation was not augmented in response to IGF-1 stimulation, and no mobility shift of the protein was observed. Similar results were obtained when whole cell lysates prepared from IGF-1-stimulated cell lines were subjected to immunoprecipitation with anti-Gab-1 antibody followed by immunoblotting with antiphosphotyrosine (data not shown). Consistent with these findings, IGF-1 stimulation failed to increase the association of Gab-1 with SH2 domain containing adapter proteins such as Grb-2 and the p85 regulatory subunit of PI 3-kinase (data not shown). To determine the level of IGF-1-stimulated IRS-1 and IRS-2 tyrosine phosphorylation and to confirm the absence of tyrosine-phosphorylated Gab-1 in response to IGF-1, whole cell lysates from IGF-1 stimulated KO; KO+IRS-1 and KO+Gab-1 cells were subjected to immunoprecipitation and immunoblotting using antiphosphotyrosine antibody. As previously observed, KO cells lack IRS-1 tyrosine phoshorylation and the only high molecular weight phosphoprotein detected corresponded to IRS-2, as indicated by its relatively retarded mobility on SDS-gels. In KO+IRS-1 cells, IGF-1 stimulation resulted in a marked increase in IRS-1 tyrosine phosphorylation and lower levels of IRS-2 tyrosine phosphorylation. In KO+Gab-1cells, IGF-1 stimulation resulted in the tyrosine phosphorylation of IRS-2 comparable to that seen in KO cells, but no tyrosine phosphorylated proteins were detected in the appropriate molecular weight range of Gab-1 (Fig. 2 B). Thus, although Gab-1 is capable of undergoing tyrosine phosphorylation in response to EGF stimulation in 3T3 cells, it does not undergo tyrosine phosphorylation in response to IGF-1 stimulation. In addition, these data indicate that the overexpression of Gab-1 does not alter the extent or ability of IRS-2 to become tyrosine phosphorylated in response to IGF-1 stimulation, i.e. it does not appear to be a competitive substrate for the IGF-1 receptor. An important pathway activated by IGF-1 stimulation and involved in gene expression and the mitogenic response is the activation of the MAP kinase signaling cascade. Upon receptor activation, phosphorylated IRS-1, IRS-2, and SHC bind to the SH2 domain of the adapter molecular Grb-2, which in turn binds the guanine nucleotide exchange factor SOS, allowing for activation of Ras and initiation of a signaling cascade of serine/threonine kinases, including Raf, mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase, ERK-1, and ERK-2. To assess the potential impact of Gab-1 in mediating signaling via this pathway, we performed in vitro kinase assays using anti-MAP kinase immunoprecipitates and myelin basic protein as a substrate. As can be seen in Fig. 3, the MAP kinases ERK-1 and ERK-2 were activated to the same extent and also followed the same time course in response to IGF-1 in all cell lines. These data indicate that both Gab-1 and IRS-1, although capable of binding Grb-2 and activating the MAP kinases, had no apparent effect on the level and time course of IGF-1-stimulated activation of ERK-1 and ERK-2. Mice made IRS-1 deficient by targeted gene knockout exhibit intrauterine and postnatal growth retardation because of resistance to the actions of IGF-1 and insulin. In culture, IRS-1-deficient 3T3 cells also exhibit a decrease in IGF-1-mediated egr-1 and c-fos expression (23.Kahn C.R. Krieger D.T. Bardin C.W. Current Therapy in Endocrinology. B. C. Decker Publishers, Philadelphia1983Google Scholar). To assess the potential role for Gab-1 in mediating immediate-early gene expression, IGF-1-stimulated expression of the immediate-early gene egr-1 was assessed by Northern blot analysis. As previously reported, KO cells showed a markedly reduced expression of egr-1 in response to IGF-1 stimulation over a 60-min time course (Fig.4 A). This deficit inegr-1 expression could be restored by the reconstitution of IRS-1 in KO+IRS-1 cells. Quantification of three independent experiments revealed a 50–60% reduction ofegr-1 induction in KO cells when compared with KO+IRS-1 cells. Interestingly, Gab-1 overexpression was also capable of restoring the defects in egr-1 expression observed in KO cells to levels 80–90% that of KO+IRS-1cells. These data indicate the potential existence of a common pathway(s) mediated by both IRS-1 and Gab-1, which is necessary for IGF-1-stimulated activation of the immediate-early geneegr-1 (23.Kahn C.R. Krieger D.T. Bardin C.W. Current Therapy in Endocrinology. B. C. Decker Publishers, Philadelphia1983Google Scholar). Finally, to address whether overexpression of Gab-1 was capable of restoring IGF-1-stimulated cell cycle progression, we determined the level of IGF-1-stimulated incorporation of [methyl-3H]thymidine into DNA in KO, KO+IRS-1, and KO+Gab-1 cell lines. As previously observed, [methyl-3H]thymidine labeling in response to IGF-1 was decreased by 70% in KO cells, and reconstitution of IRS-1 restored the potential to enter S phase (Fig.5). Surprisingly, overexpression of Gab-1 markedly increased IGF-1-stimulated S-phase progression at every point in the dose-response curve. At the higher concentrations of IGF-1 tested, KO+Gab-1 cells exhibited a 4.2-fold higher incorporation of [methyl-3H]thymidine labeling as compared with KO+IRS-1 cells (Fig. 5) and by 3-fold when compared with results obtained from wild type 3T3 fibroblast cell lines (data not shown). Thus, Gab-1 is uniquely capable of potently stimulating cell cycle progression. A variety of studies have demonstrated that Gab-1 acts downstream of several receptor protein-tyrosine kinases, including the insulin and EGF receptors, by binding SH2 domain-containing signaling molecules following receptor-mediated phosphorylation. These studies indicate that Gab-1 functions as a substrate-signaling platform, like other members of the IRS family of proteins; however, the potential role of Gab-1 vis à vis other IRS proteins in mediating the pleiotropic effects of insulin and IGF-1 has not been investigated. In the current study, we have attempted to determine the potential role of Gab-1 in IGF-1-mediated signaling, taking advantage of cells in which this pathway is reduced by the absence of IRS-1 (23.Kahn C.R. Krieger D.T. Bardin C.W. Current Therapy in Endocrinology. B. C. Decker Publishers, Philadelphia1983Google Scholar). The tyrosine phosphorylation of IRS proteins requires a two-fold mechanism for the selective interaction with activated insulin and IGF-1 receptors. Analysis of IRS-1 using the yeast two-hybrid system has implicated the N-terminal PH and PTB domains of IRS-1 in mediating receptor recognition, and this has been confirmed in mutagenesis studies in which these domains have been deleted (20.Yenush L.

Based on studies in 32D cells, Myers et al. (27.Myers Jr., M.G. Grammer T.C. Brooks J. Glasheen E.M. Wang L.M. Sun X.J. Blenis J. Pierce J.H. White M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 11715-11718Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar) have concluded that of these two domains, the PH domain is required for sensitive receptor coupling. These studies have also demonstrated that this domain is critical for insulin-stimulated phosphorylation of IRS-1 and the activation of downstream signaling pathways including the activation of PI 3-kinase and the phosphorylation of p70s6 kinase (27.Myers Jr., M.G. Grammer T.C. Brooks J. Glasheen E.M. Wang L.M. Sun X.J. Blenis J. Pierce J.H. White M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 11715-11718Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Although the exact mechanism by which the PH domain functions in insulin receptor-IRS protein recognition is unclear, the data suggest that the PH domain of IRS proteins may mediate protein-protein interactions or bind phospholipids in the membrane, which may target IRS proteins to the plasma membrane and coordinate receptor interaction (27.Myers Jr., M.G. Grammer T.C. Brooks J. Glasheen E.M. Wang L.M. Sun X.J. Blenis J. Pierce J.H. White M.F. J. Biol.

Chem. 1994; 14: 10217-10220Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar). Although the PH domain of Gab-1 appears to function homologously to the PH domains of other IRS proteins based upon its ability to couple chimeric IRS-1 phosphorylation to the insulin receptor, in the context of Gab-1 the PH domain alone does not appear to be sufficient to mediate recognition by the insulin and IGF-1 receptors (20.Yenush L.

Wong A.J. Park M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 1784-1799Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). This hypothesis is supported by recent data that suggest that the PH and PTB domains of IRS proteins function cooperatively to mediate receptor recognition (33.Eck M.J. Dhe-Paganon S. Trub T. Nolte R.T. Shoelson S.E. Cell. 1996; 85: 695-705Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar). One of the first steps in insulin signaling involves the autoactivation of the receptor by phosphorylation of tyrosines 1146, 1150, and 1151 in its catalytic cleft, and phosphorylation of tyrosine 960 in its juxtamembrane region (34.White M.F. Shoelson S.E. Keutmann H. Kahn C.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 2969-2980Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 35.Hubbard S.R. Wei L. Ellis L. Hendrickson W.A. Nature. 1994; 372: 746-754Crossref PubMed Scopus (958) Google Scholar). The latter phosphorylation leads to recruitment of IRS-1 to the activated receptor and the interaction of the PTB domain of IRS-1 with phosphorylated NPXY motifs in the juxtamembrane region of the receptor. The IGF-1 receptor contains an analogous NPXY motif in its intracellular subunits, suggesting that PTB domain interaction at least partially mediates the association with this receptor. The lack of tyrosine phosphorylation of Gab-1 in response to IGF-1 stimulation in the current study suggests that the absence of a conventional PTB domain in Gab-1 may not allow for its recognition by the IGF-1 receptor. This hypothesis is supported by the failure of the yeast two-hybrid system to detect the interaction of Gab-1 with the insulin receptor (36.Weidner K.M. Di Cesare S. Sachs M. Brinkmann V. Behrens J. Birchmeier W. Nature. 1996; 384: 173-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (505) Google Scholar). Although Gab-1 lacks a conventional PTB domain, Gab-1 may potentially interact with receptor tyrosine kinases via two other mechanisms. Recently, a proline-rich interaction domain in Gab-1 has been identified that mediates the interaction with the c-Met receptor (36.Weidner K.M. Di Cesare S. Sachs M. Brinkmann V. Behrens J. Birchmeier W. Nature. 1996; 384: 173-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (505) Google Scholar). In addition, because the SH3 domains of Grb-2 can bind Gab-1, Grb-2 may also serve to recruit Gab-1 to the activated receptor (37.Fixman E.D. Holgado-Madruga M. Nguyen L. Kamikura D.M. Fournier T.M. Wong A.J. Park M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 20167-20172Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar,38.Nguyen L. Holgado-Madruga M. Maroun C. Fixman E.D. Kamikura D.

Despite the lack of apparent tyrosine phosphorylation, Gab-1 can participate in downstream signaling from the IGF-1 receptor. Immediate-early gene products often encode transcription factors that have been implicated in cellular growth and differentiation. Waterset al. (40.Waters S.B. Yamauchi K. Pessin J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 22231-22234Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) have shown that expression of IRS-1 antisense RNA causes a reduction of insulin-stimulated activity of a luciferase gene under the control of the c-fos serum response element, the same element that has been implicated in conferring insulin sensitivity to the c-fos promoter (39.Thompson M.J. Roe M.W. Malik R.K. Blackshear P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 21127-21135Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 40.Waters S.B. Yamauchi K. Pessin J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 22231-22234Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Our previous data in the IRS-1-deficient fibroblasts also provide evidence that expression of the c-fos and egr-1 genes depend on IRS-1 (23.Kahn C.R. Krieger D.T. Bardin C.W. Current Therapy in Endocrinology. B. C. Decker Publishers, Philadelphia1983Google Scholar). In addition, the restoration of egr-1 expression in Gab-1 overexpressing cells indicates that Gab-1 is capable of regulating immediate-early gene expression. These data are of even greater interest considering that the IGF-1-stimulated activation of the MAP kinases is normal in IRS-1-deficient and Gab-1-overexpressing cells. Our data provide evidence for an IRS-1- or Gab-1-dependent pathway activating the egr-1promoter despite the normal activation of the MAP kinases ERK-1 and ERK-2. Thus the cell lines described here provide a unique system with which to further define the pathways for Gab-1-dependentegr-1 expression. Gab-1 also appears to be uniquely capable of enhancing IGF-1-stimulated mitogenesis. These results are supported by data that indicate that the overexpression of Gab-1 is capable of enhancing anchorage-dependent and -independent growth rates (18.Holgado-Madruga M. Emlet D.R. Moscatello D.K. Godwin A.K. Wong A.J. Nature. 1996; 379: 560-563Crossref PubMed Scopus (601) Google Scholar). In addition, Holgado-Madruga et al. (22.Holgado-Madruga M. Moscatello D.K. Emlet D.R. Dietrich R. Wong A.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 12419-12424Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar) have shown that PC-12 cells overexpressing Gab-1 had a reduced requirement for the amount of nerve growth factor necessary to prevent apoptosis. Mutants of Gab-1 lacking PI 3-kinase binding sites exhibited increased levels of apoptosis, indicating that Gab-1-associated PI 3-kinase activity was required for the inhibition of apoptosis. In addition, the overexpression of Gab-1 in several cell systems leads to increased transforming potential indicating that Gab-1 may have a profound effect on regulation of the cell cycle. Taken together, these data indicate that Gab-1 is capable of both enhancing cell growth and promoting cell survival through the prevention of apoptosis. The absence of alterations in MAP kinase activity in KO, KO+IRS-1, and KO+Gab-1 fibroblasts suggests that many IRS family members may not be required for the normal activation of the Ras/MAP kinase pathway. The role of Gab-1 in MAP kinase activation may differ depending on the cell type. Several groups have reported differential activation of the MAP kinases in several cell systems (18.Holgado-Madruga M. Emlet D.R. Moscatello D.K. Godwin A.K. Wong A.J. Nature. 1996; 379: 560-563Crossref PubMed Scopus (601) Google Scholar, 21.Takahashi-Tezuka M. Yoshida Y. Fukada T. Ohtani T. Yamanaka Y. Nishida K. Nakajima K. Hibi M. Hirano T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 4109-4117Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar, 36.Weidner K.M. Di Cesare S. Sachs M. Brinkmann V. Behrens J. Birchmeier W. Nature. 1996; 384: 173-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (505) Google Scholar). For example, Holgado-Madruga et al. (18.Holgado-Madruga M. Emlet D.R. Moscatello D.K. Godwin A.K. Wong A.J. Nature. 1996; 379: 560-563Crossref PubMed Scopus (601) Google Scholar) have found that Gab-1 and SOS form separate complexes with Grb-2 indicating that Gab-1 may compete with SOS for Grb-2 binding. In this way, Gab-1 may potentially regulate the activation of the MAP kinase pathway. The absence of IGF-1-stimulated Gab-1 phosphorylation may potentially negate this effect and allow for the normal activation of the MAP kinase pathway. Alternatively, the level of overexpression of Gab-1 in our system is not sufficient to compete with SOS for Grb-2 binding, and therefore, no alterations in MAP kinase activation are observed. In conclusion, we have demonstrated that Gab-1 is not phoshorylated by the IGF-1 receptor, but overexpression of Gab-1 in IRS-1-deficient cells can restore the IGF-1-stimulated expression of the immediate-early gene egr-1 and markedly enhances the ability of the cells to enter S-phase. Further studies are required to determine the exact mechanism by which Gab-1 participates in the regulation of these biological end points. We thank T. L. Azar, C. Remillard, and J.

This enzyme in plants is localized in plastids and is believed to be composed of biotin carboxyl carrier protein, biotin carboxylase, and carboxyltransferase made up of α and β polypeptides, although the enzyme has not been purified yet. Accumulated evidence shows that pea plastidic acetyl-CoA carboxylase is activated by light and the activation is caused by light-dependent reduction of carboxyltransferase, but not of biotin carboxylase, via a redox cascade. To understand the reductive activation of carboxyltransferase at the molecular level here, we obtained the active enzyme composed of decahistidine-tagged (His tag) α and β polypeptides through the expression of the pea plastidic carboxyltransferase gene in Escherichia coli. Gel filtration showed that the molecular size of the recombinant carboxyltransferase is in agreement with that of partially purified carboxyltransferase from pea chloroplasts. The catalytic activity of the recombinant enzyme was similar to that of native carboxyltransferase. These results indicate that the molecular structure and conformation of recombinant carboxyltransferase resemble those of its native counterpart and that native carboxyltransferase is indeed composed of α and β polypeptides. This recombinant enzyme was activated by dithiothreitol, a known reductant of S-S bonds, with a profile similar to that of its native counterpart. The recombinant enzyme was activated by reduced thioredoxin-f, a signal transducer of redox potential in chloroplasts under irradiation. Thus, this enzyme was redox-regulated, like that of the native carboxyltransferase. Acetyl-CoA carboxylase regulates the rate of fatty acid synthesis.

Because of the complexity of this enzyme in plants, its molecular studies have been started just recently (1.Sasaki Y. Konishi T. Nagano Y. Plant Physiol. (Rockv.). 1995; 108: 445-449Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). Plants, with an exception of Gramineae, have two forms of ACCase: the eukaryotic form, composed of a large multifunctional polypeptide in cytosol, and the prokaryotic form, composed of four different polypeptides in plastids (1.Sasaki Y. Konishi T. Nagano Y. Plant Physiol. (Rockv.). 1995; 108: 445-449Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar, 2.Ohlrogge J. Browse J. Plant Cell. 1995; 7: 957-970Crossref PubMed Scopus (1258) Google Scholar). Gramineae have the eukaryotic form both in cytosol and plastids (3.Konishi T. Sasaki Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 3598-3601Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar, 4.Konishi T. Shinohara K. Yamada K. Sasaki Y. Plant Cell Physiol. 1996; 37: 117-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). Plant fatty acids are mainly synthesized in plastids, and the prokaryotic form of ACCase regulates the rate of fatty acid synthesis in most plants (2.Ohlrogge J. Browse J. Plant Cell. 1995; 7: 957-970Crossref PubMed Scopus (1258) Google Scholar). In leaves, fatty acid synthesis is modulated by light/dark, presumably by regulation of plastidic ACCase (5.Sauer A. Heise K.-P. Z. Naturforsch. 1984; 39: 268-275Crossref Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Chloroplasts have a light-signal transduction pathway via a redox cascade, which is used to regulate enzymes of the reductive pentose phosphate cycle (6.Buchanan B.B. Annu. Rev. Plant Physiol. 1980; 31: 341-374Crossref Google Scholar). Under light, electrons from photosystem I are shuttled through the electron transport chain to ferredoxins and are transferred to thioredoxins by ferredoxin-thioredoxin reductase and then to target enzymes, reducing disulfide bonds of cysteines in the enzymes and changing their catalytic activities. We previously proposed that such a redox cascade is involved in the light/dark modulation of pea plastidic ACCase and that the reductive activation of the ACCase by thioredoxin links light and fatty acid synthesis (7.Sasaki Y. Kozaki A. Hatano M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 11096-11101Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). This proposition was supported byin vivo evidence that the plastidic ACCase in light is indeed in an active reduced form and that in the dark is in an inactive oxidized form (8.Kozaki A. Sasaki Y. Biochem. J. 1999; 339: 541-546Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Light and redox sensitivity of the ACCase was also observed for spinach chloroplasts (9.Hunter S.C. Ohlrogge J.B. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1998; 359: 170-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) Pea plastidic ACCase is a multienzyme complex probably composed of biotin carboxyl carrier protein (BCCP), biotin carboxylase, and carboxyltransferase complex made up of two pairs of α and β polypeptides. Of these four polypeptides, β polypeptide is encoded by the chloroplast genome (10.Sasaki Y. Hakamada K. Suama Y. Nagano Y. Furusawa I. Matsuno R. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 25118-25123Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and the other three polypeptides are encoded by the nuclear genome (2.Ohlrogge J. Browse J. Plant Cell. 1995; 7: 957-970Crossref PubMed Scopus (1258) Google Scholar). ACCase catalyzes two different half-reactions, biotin carboxylase (Step 1) and carboxyltransferase reactions (Step 2) to form malonyl-CoA,BCCP+Mg2+­ATP+HCO3−⇄BCCP­CO2−+Mg2+­ADP+PiSTEP 1 BCCP­CO2−+acetyl­CoA⇄BCCP+malonyl­CoASTEP 2Of these two reactions, the carboxyltransferase reaction is redox-regulated (8.Kozaki A. Sasaki Y. Biochem. J. 1999; 339: 541-546Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). The α and β polypeptides in pea have 2 and 11 cysteine residues, respectively. One or more of these cysteines are potential regulatory residues. Plastidic ACCase as well as its carboxyltransferase have not been purified yet. The molecular mass of pea ACCase has been estimated from gel filtration to be about 700 kDa (10.Sasaki Y. Hakamada K. Suama Y. Nagano Y. Furusawa I. Matsuno R. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 25118-25123Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 11.Shorrosh B.S. Savage L.J. Söll T. Ohlrogge J.B.

(Rockv.). 1999; 119: 961-978Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar), but its molecular composition has not been confirmed. For characterization of ACCase and for identification of regulatory cysteine residues, it is important to express plastidic carboxyltransferase in Escherichia coli. Although cDNA encoding the α polypeptide (11.Shorrosh B.S. Savage L.J. Söll T. Ohlrogge J.B. Plant J. 1996; 10: 261-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar) and DNA encoding the β polypeptide (10.Sasaki Y. Hakamada K. Suama Y. Nagano Y. Furusawa I. Matsuno R. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 25118-25123Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) of plastidic carboxyltransferase have been isolated, the recombinant carboxyltransferase has not yet been obtained, probably because of abnormal properties of the two polypeptides. Enzymes composed of two different subunits are successfully obtained by coexpressing the two polypeptides in E. coli using a plasmid (13.Yang Y.R. Schachman H.K. Protein Sci. 1993; 2: 1013-1023Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar, 14.Qian D. Zhou D. Ju R. Cramer C.L. Yang Z. Plant Cell. 1996; 8: 2381-2394PubMed Google Scholar, 15.Blanchard C.Z. Waldrop G.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 19140-19145Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). By using such a strategy, here we report the expression of active plastidic carboxyltransferase in E. coli. We examined the catalytic and regulatory properties of the recombinant enzyme and compared them with those of the native carboxyltransferase from chloroplasts. The cDNAs for the α and β polypeptides of carboxyltransferase, designatedaccA and accD cDNAs, respectively, were obtained by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using RNA from pea (Pisum sativum cv. Alaska) seedling as template. RNA was reverse-transcribed with specific reverse primers foraccA, PA03 (5′-CCGCTCGAG TTCTCC TTAAGAGAAGTTGCGATTTACACCAAC-3′) or for accD, PD05 (5′-CCGCTCAGC TTAAGTCAAAGGAACGAAACC-3′) using superscript RNaseH reverse transcriptase (Life Technologies, Inc.) according to the method described elsewhere (16.Carninci P. Nishiyama Y. Westover A. Itoh M. Nagaoka S. Sasaki N. Okazaki Y. Muramatsu M. Hayashizaki Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 520-524Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). PA03 and PD05 haveXhoI and BlpI restriction sites (underlined), respectively, and stop codons (bold). In addition, PA03 has a ribosome binding site (italic). The first-strand cDNAs were used for the following PCR amplification. The accA was amplified using the primers PA03 and PA01 (5′-TCATATGAAGTTGAGGAAGGTGAAGAGG-3′). PA01 is designed to express the α polypeptide from an accurate N-terminal residue without transit peptide and has the NdeI restriction site (underlined). The accD cDNA was amplified using the primers PD05 and PD04 (5′-CCGCTCGAGATGATAAATGAAGACCCATCTAG-3′). PD04 hasXhoI restriction site (underlined). PCR was performed for 35 cycles with a temperature profile of 10 s at 94 °C, 30 s at 55 °C, and 4 min at 72 °C using Pyrobest DNA polymerase (TAKARA). The amplification products were purified by electrophoresis on 1% agarose gels and subsequent extraction using the Sephaglas BandPrep kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Purified PCR products were inserted into the EcoRV site of pZErO-2 vector (Invitrogen). The inserted sequences of the resultant plasmids, pZA and pZD, were determined by the dideoxy chain termination method using an automatic DNA sequencer (model LIC-400, LI-COR Inc.). The sequence ofaccD fragment amplified by reverse transcription-PCR was also verified by direct sequencing. DNA sequences of pea (cv. Alaska) accA differed by five nucleotides from the reported sequences of pea (cv. Miranda)accA (accession number: Z 31559). The accA sequence data will appear in the DDBJ/EMBL/GenBank nucleotide sequence data bases under the accession number AB 029556. The strategy for construction of expression vector pHisAD is summarized in Fig. 3. For the coexpression of the α and β polypeptides to produce the carboxyltransferase complex in the cell, accA cDNA andaccD cDNA were polycistronically inserted into pET-19b vector containing a decahistidine-tagged (His tag), which allows a fused protein to be purified by a nickel column. The pET-19b vector is designed for fused protein to be cleaved by the protease enterokinase. Briefly, the accA fragment was isolated by digestion of pZA with NdeI and XhoI, and the accD fragment was isolated from pZD by digestion with XhoI andBlpI. First, the accD fragment was ligated intoXhoI/BlpI sites of pET-19b, and then theaccA fragment was ligated to XhoI/NdeI sites of pET-19b vector carrying the accD fragment. In the resultant pHisAD, a His tag was designed to be fused to the N terminus of the α polypeptide. The β polypeptide and His-tag α polypeptide of pea carboxyltransferase were expressed in E. coli BL 21(DE3) cells (Novagen) containing pHisAD (Fig. 3). Cells containing the plasmid were grown exponentially in LB medium containing ampicillin (100 μg/ml) at 37 °C with shaking (250 rpm). At anA 600 of 0.7–0.9, isopropyl β-d-thiogalactoside was added to a final concentration of 1 mm, and the temperature was lowered to 20 °C upon induction. The cultures were incubated for an additional period of 18–20 h at 20 °C with shaking (150 rpm). The cells were harvested by centrifugation at 8,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C and stored at −80 °C. The cell paste from a 2-liter culture was suspended in 200 ml of binding buffer containing 5 mm imidazole, 500 mm NaCl, 0.1% Triton X-100, and 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.9) and was lysed by sonication. The sonicated lysate was centrifuged at 48,000 × g for 20 min. Purification of recombinant His-tag proteins followed the Novagen protocol supplied for the use of pET His-tag systems. The supernatant (crude extract) was applied onto a nickel column (0.25 ml) and recycled about 10 times within 16–20 h. The column was washed with 30 ml of washing buffer containing 60 mm imidazole, 500 mm NaCl, and 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.9). The recombinant proteins were eluted with a solution (3 ml) containing 150 mm imidazole, 500 mm NaCl, and 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.9). This eluate was dialyzed against 50 mm Tricine-KOH (pH 8) and used for activity measurement. The activity was stable at 4 °C at least for 1 month and at −80 °C for several months. From chloroplasts containing 24 mg of chlorophyll, ACCase fractions were prepared by gel filtration as described elsewhere (10.Sasaki Y. Hakamada K. Suama Y. Nagano Y. Furusawa I. Matsuno R. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 25118-25123Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The pooled ACCase fractions were separated by anion exchange chromatography (RESOURCE Q (1 ml), Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) with a linear gradient of 0–0.5 m NaCl in a buffer containing 50 mm Tricine-KOH (pH 8) and 1 mm EDTA. At this step, ACCase was dissociated into biotin carboxylase with BCCP and carboxyltransferase, and these two complexes were eluted at different NaCl concentrations. Carboxyltransferase eluted at about 0.35m NaCl was again separated by RESOURCE Q to remove contaminated biotin carboxylase with BCCP. The carboxyltransferase was concentrated by ammonium sulfate (50% saturation) precipitation and used as the native carboxyltransferase. Both recombinant carboxyltransferase and native carboxyltransferase were precipitated by the addition of ammonium sulfate (50% saturation) and dissolved into 0.07 ml of a buffer containing 50 mm Tricine-KOH (pH 8), 1 mm EDTA, and 0.5 mm DTT, and dialyzed. Fifty microliters (20–25 μg of protein for recombinant enzyme or 150 μg of protein for native enzyme) of this dialysate was separated with a Superdex 200 column using a SMART system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE (7.5% (w/v) gel) and transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane. The blots were probed with anti-(carboxyltransferase α or β) IgG and then with goat anti-rabbit IgG conjugated to peroxidase (Bio-Rad) diluted 1:3000; the blots were developed with an immunostaining system (Konica) or an enhanced chemiluminescence kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Anti-carboxyltransferase α polypeptide IgG was prepared against Glutathione S-transferase-fused accA protein by immunizing the rabbits. Glutathione S-transferase-fusedaccA protein was prepared according to the Amersham Pharmacia Biotech protocol. Anti-carboxyltransferase β polypeptide IgG was prepared as described previously (10.Sasaki Y. Hakamada K. Suama Y. Nagano Y. Furusawa I. Matsuno R. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 25118-25123Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Pea plants (P. sativum cv. Alaska) were grown with a cycle of 16 h of light and 8 h of darkness. Intact chloroplasts were isolated from the leaves of 9-day-old seedlings with a Percoll gradient. The isolated chloroplasts were ruptured by a lysis buffer (50 mm Tricine-KOH (pH 8), 1 mm EDTA, 10 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mmbenzamide, and 5 mm ε-amino-n-caproic acid) as described before (10.Sasaki Y. Hakamada K. Suama Y. Nagano Y. Furusawa I. Matsuno R. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 25118-25123Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The lysed chloroplasts were centrifuged for 20 min at 50,000 × g. The supernatant (5 ml) obtained from chloroplasts containing 5 mg of chlorophyll was diluted by 3 volumes of immunoprecipitation buffer containing 50 mmTris-HCl (pH 7.5), 140 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 0.1% Triton X-100 (w/v), and 3.6 μl (50 μg) of anti-carboxyltransferase β IgG was added. The mixture was incubated for 1 h at 25 °C and then for 15 h at 4 °C. To this mixture, 50 μl of a 5% suspension of protein A-Sepharose CL-4B (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, binding capacity, 20 mg IgG/ml beads) was added and incubated for 1 h at 25 °C and then for 1 h at 4 °C with gentle rotation. The beads were recovered by brief centrifugation and washed with immunoprecipitation buffer for three times. The proteins bound to the beads were released by treatment with SDS loading buffer for 3 min at 100 °C. Carboxyltransferase activity was measured by the reverse reaction method as described elsewhere (8.Kozaki A. Sasaki Y. Biochem. J. 1999; 339: 541-546Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). The carboxyl transfer from [2-14C]malonyl-CoA to biotin methyl ester was measured. The resultant [14C]acetyl-CoA was evaporated, and the residual [2-14C]malonyl-CoA was determined. A carboxyltransferase fraction in a total of 50 μl of reaction mixture (100 mm Tricine-KOH (pH 8), 10 mm biotin methyl ester, 125 μm malonyl-CoA (0.64 kBq), 37.5 μg of bovine serum albumin) was incubated at 30 °C. After 0 and 20 min of incubation, 20 μl of the mixture was transferred to a tube containing 5 μl of 6 N HCl to terminate the reaction. The mixture was heated to dryness at 98° C for 20 min, dissolved in 25 μl H2O, and applied to Whatman 3MM paper (1 × 1 cm). The difference between radioactivity at time zero and after 20 min of incubation was designated as carboxyltransferase activity. Recombinant spinach thioredoxin-f was a gift from P. Shürmann (Universite de Neuchatel, Switzerland). Reduced thioredoxin-f was prepared by incubation with 6.4 mm dithiothreitol (DTT) at 30 °C for 20 min, and excess DTT was removed by gel filtration. Carboxyltransferase α polypeptide is encoded by a nuclear genome, and its gene is accA. The deduced amino acid sequence from accA cDNA has a transit peptide to enter into chloroplasts at the N terminus. To express the α polypeptide inE. coli, we must determine the accurate N-terminal amino acid sequences of this polypeptide and remove the sequence encoding the transit peptide from the pea accA cDNA. Carboxyltransferase β polypeptide is encoded by the chloroplast genome, and its gene is accD. The alignment of the amino acid sequence deduced from various plant accD shows that the N-terminal sequence is divergent and not always conserved. In addition, two possible initiation methionines has been found within 12 amino acid residues in the open reading frame of pea accD (17.Nagano Y. Matsuno R. Sasaki Y. Curr. Genet. 1991; 20: 431-436Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar), and it is necessary to know which methionine is the true initiation site. To identify N-terminal amino acid sequences of both α and β polypeptides, we immunoprecipitated carboxyltransferase in the chloroplast extract by anti-carboxyltransferase β polypeptide IgG, separated the precipitates on SDS-PAGE, and analyzed the amino acid sequences of each polypeptide. We found two bands with an apparent molecular mass of 98 and 87 kDa in the region of molecular mass larger than the IgG heavy chain (about 52 kDa). The 98 and the 87 kDa bands were identified to be α and β polypeptides, respectively (10.Sasaki Y. Hakamada K. Suama Y. Nagano Y. Furusawa I. Matsuno R. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 25118-25123Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 11.Shorrosh B.S. Savage L.J. Söll T. Ohlrogge J.B. Plant J. 1996; 10: 261-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1-A). The N-terminal amino acid sequences of these bands thus determined were aligned with the deduced sequences from the accA cDNA and the accD gene (Fig. 1 B). The cleavage site of the transit peptide of α polypeptide was the 50th amino acid residue, which was in agreement with the site predicted by the method described previously (18.Gavel Y. von Heijne G. FEBS Lett. 1990; 261: 455-458Crossref PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar). Because pea accA encodes a polypeptide of 875 amino acid residues (11.Shorrosh B.S. Savage L.J. Söll T. Ohlrogge J.B. Plant J. 1996; 10: 261-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar), the α polypeptide is composed of 825 amino acid residues and has a molecular mass of 91,379 Da. A accA cDNA encoding a full-length α polypeptide that does not have a transit peptide was used for constructing the expression plasmid. Of two possible initiation methionines, the first one was found in the immunoprecipitates of the β polypeptide, and the polypeptide, which is composed of 590 amino acid residues (17.Nagano Y. Matsuno R. Sasaki Y. Curr. Genet. 1991; 20: 431-436Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar), starts from the first methionine. Chloroplast mRNA is sometimes modified by RNA editing (19.Sugiura M. Hirose T. Sugita M. Annu. Rev. Genet. 1998; 32: 437-459Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). To find the RNA editing site of pea accD transcript, we compared the nucleotide sequences of the cDNA with those of the accD gene (Fig. 2 A). Only one editing site, cytosine to uracil change, was found at nucleotide position +800. This corresponded to the second nucleotide position of the 267th codon, UCG (serine) codon. The UCG triplet (serine) in the gene was converted to the UUG triplet (leucine) in its mRNA, and the 267th codon for a leucine residue was created by RNA editing. The leucine residue contributes to the conservation of accD protein among most chloroplasts, Cyanobacteria, and E. coli, suggesting that this leucine residue is critical for the protein function. Because of the presence of an editing site, we used a cDNA, but not a chloroplast DNA, encoding the full-length β polypeptide for constructing the expression plasmid. The molecular mass of the β polypeptide was 67,142 Da, different from that deduced from its DNA, although the apparent molecular mass on SDS-PAGE is 87 kDa (10.Sasaki Y. Hakamada K. Suama Y. Nagano Y. Furusawa I. Matsuno R. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 25118-25123Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The cDNAs encoding α and β polypeptides described above were polycistronically inserted into the pET-19b vector (Fig. 3). The cDNA for the α polypeptide was ligated to the sequences for His tag. For coexpression of the β polypeptide with the α polypeptide, a 12-base pair intercistronic region that contains a ribosomal binding site and anXhoI site was inserted between the genes for the α and the β polypeptides. Thus, an expression plasmid, pHisAD, was constructed. When bacteria containing pHisAD (Fig. 3) were grown at 37 °C after induction, the gene for α polypeptide was expressed as inclusion bodies, and the gene for β polypeptide was only slightly expressed as inclusion bodies. To obtain a soluble enzyme, we lowered the temperature after the induction to 20 °C and obtained a small amount of soluble carboxyltransferase. The soluble fraction was bound to the nickel column, and carboxyltransferase activity was eluted with 150 mm imidazole. The control experiments using bacteria containing the pET-19b vector only did not show any carboxyltransferase activity. On SDS-PAGE, the active fraction purified with a nickel column gave a major band with a molecular mass of 102 kDa and two minor bands of 72 kDa and 87 kDa (Fig. 4). The α polypeptide fused to His tag is composed of 849 amino acids, and its molecular mass is 94,256 Da. The 102-kDa band reacted with anti-carboxyltransferase α polypeptide IgG, and the 87-kDa band reacted with anti-carboxyltransferase β polypeptide IgG. The immunoreactive 102-kDa and 87-kDa bands were identified as the α and β polypeptides, respectively. The 72-kDa band (Fig. 4 A) was ascribable to a protein in E. coli nonspecifically bound to nickel column. These results indicated that a fraction of His-tag α polypeptide was associated with β polypeptide, and the resultant complex had carboxyltransferase activity. The abundance of α polypeptide exceeds that of β polypeptide (Fig. 4 A) suggested that there was a difference in expression of the two polypeptides, and a certain amount of the α polypeptide was not associated with the β polypeptide. A minor band of 84 kDa detected by anti-β carboxyltransferase polypeptide IgG was probably a degradation product of β polypeptide. The average yield of this His-tag carboxyltransferase fraction was 0.34 mg of protein from 5 g ofE. coli cells. The yield was very low compared with that ofE. coli recombinant carboxyltransferase (15.Blanchard C.Z. Waldrop G.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 19140-19145Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar), but we could obtain enough of the enzyme to characterize its properties. Digestion with protease, enterokinase, to remove the His tag resulted in several degradation products in addition to the 98-kDa protein of the α polypeptide (data not shown), and it was difficult to obtain enough of the His tag-free carboxyltransferase. Because the presence of His tag did not hinder the catalytic activity of the enzyme, the His-tag carboxyltransferase was left intact. We confirmed that the sequences of cDNAs encoding β polypeptides in pHisAD agreed with published sequences (accession number for accD: X56315) except for the editing site at +800 of accD and confirmed that the polymerase chain reaction did not introduce any mutation. We separated the partially purified recombinant enzyme by gel filtration with a Superdex 200 column in the presence of DTT. Coomassie Brilliant Blue staining of the separated fractions revealed two peaks of 102-kDa His-tag α polypeptide at fractions 12 and 22 and one peak of the 87-kDa β polypeptide at fraction 12 (Fig.5 A). A peak of carboxyltransferase activity was found at fraction 12. Immunoblotting revealed the presence of α and β polypeptides in this fraction. These results indicated that the carboxyltransferase composed of α and β polypeptides existed in fraction 12, and α polypeptide aggregates, probably dimers, were also present in fraction 22. Coomassie Brilliant Blue staining showed that the band intensity of the α polypeptide at fraction 12 was slightly denser than that of the β polypeptide, like that of the native enzyme (Fig. 1), suggesting that the molecular composition of recombinant carboxyltransferase and native counterpart in planta is the same with respect to α and β polypeptides. To compare the molecular size of the recombinant carboxyltransferase with its native counterpart, we similarly analyzed the partially purified carboxyltransferase fraction (Fig. 5 B). The major peak of carboxyltransferase activity and its components were found in fraction 12. These results indicated that the apparent molecular size of the recombinant His-tag carboxyltransferase was similar to that of the native counterpart. Similar and reproducible results were obtained for the recombinant and native enzymes in the absence of DTT (data not shown). The molecular size of the recombinant carboxyltransferase at fraction 12 estimated from the standard protein was 490 kDa. Because the carboxyltransferase activity in ACCase was sensitive to redox state (8.Kozaki A. Sasaki Y. Biochem. J. 1999; 339: 541-546Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar), we examined the sensitivity of the recombinant enzyme to redox state and compared it with that of its native counterpart. In this experiment, the effect of a known reductant of S-S bonds, DTT, was tested (Fig. 6 A). In the absence of DTT, the recombinant enzyme was inactive. The addition of monothiol, 2-mercaptoethanol, did not activate the enzyme at a concentration of less than 8 mm. The addition of DTT activated the enzyme, and the activity attained maximum level at about 8 mm. The similar profile was obtained for the native carboxyltransferase, and the requirement for DTT of the two enzymes was the same. These results indicate that the recombinant enzyme is sensitive to redox state, like that of its native counterpart. Thioredoxins are signal transducers of redox potential in chloroplasts under light (6.Buchanan B.B. Annu. Rev. Plant Physiol. 1980; 31: 341-374Crossref Google Scholar). Chloroplasts contain 100–200 μmthioredoxins-m and -f. Our previous results showed that thioredoxin-f activated in vitro pea plastidic ACCase more efficiently than thioredoxin-m (7.Sasaki Y. Kozaki A. Hatano M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 11096-11101Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). To determine whether thioredoxin-f can activate the recombinant enzyme, we examined the effect of thioredoxin-f at the concentration of 0–160 μm (Fig. 6 B). The addition of spinach thioredoxin-f in reduced form increased the recombinant enzyme activity severalfold compared with that of nonreduced form. Almost the same profiles were obtained for the native enzyme, suggesting that the sensitivity of recombinant enzyme to reduced thioredoxin-f is similar to that of the native enzyme. In the presence of 160 μm reduced thioredoxin, the recombinant enzyme activity was 914 nmol/20 min/mg of protein, and in the presence of 160 μm DTT, it was 59.2 nmol/20 min/mg of protein. The reduced thioredoxin-f activated the enzyme more efficiently than DTT (Fig. 6 A), implying that the reduced (dithiol) thioredoxin, having a higher affinity for the carboxyltransferase than DTT, reduced an S-S bond(s) and activated the enzyme. Comparison of the kinetic parameters for carboxyltransferase-catalyzed transcarboxylation from malonyl-CoA and biotin methyl ester revealed that the recombinant enzyme and its native counterpart had similarK m values for both substrates: K mfor malonyl-CoA of recombinant and native enzymes were 0.35 and 0.34 mm, respectively, and K m for biotin methyl ester of recombinant and native enzymes were 1.05 and 1.01 mm, respectively. Both enzymes showed no sensitivity to pH over the range 6.5–8.5 (data not shown). Thus, both the recombinant and native enzymes showed similar catalytic properties. However, the pH profile of carboxyltransferase activity in ACCase (8.Kozaki A. Sasaki Y. Biochem. J. 1999; 339: 541-546Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar) was different from that of carboxyltransferase alone. Assembly markedly affected the ionic properties of the carboxyltransferase. Plastidic ACCase and its components have not been purified yet because of their labile properties, and we do not know the exact molecular composition of these enzymes. An approach different from conventional purification has been awaited to identify the polypeptide composition. Here we have succeeded in obtaining the recombinant carboxyltransferase for the first time and characterized its properties. We found that the recombinant enzyme composed of His-tag α and β polypeptides has similar molecular size (Fig. 5), redox sensitivity (Fig. 6), and catalytic activity to those of the native counterpart in planta. These results indicate that native carboxyltransferase is indeed composed of α and β polypeptides. Plastidic ACCase resembles to the ACCase in E. coli. The sequences of 310 amino acid residues in the N-terminal half of the α polypeptide is conserved in E. coli with 81% amino acid similarity (47% identity) (Fig. 7). With respect to the β polypeptide, the sequences of the C-terminal 278 amino acids, excluding reiterated sequence, is conserved in E. coli with 78% similarity (39% identity). These conserved domains are probably essential for carboxyltransferase. The close resemblance between pea and E. coli enzymes in these domains suggests that subunit structure of the pea enzyme also resembles that ofE. coli (20.Li S.-J. Cronan Jr., J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 16841-16847Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), α2β2. The molecular size of pea recombinant carboxyltransferase estimated from gel filtration was 490 kDa. The molecular mass of the α polypeptide, the His-tag α polypeptide, and the β polypeptide was 91.4, 94.2, and 67.1 kDa, respectively. The calculated molecular mass of α2β2 was about 320 kDa, and the observed size was in agreement with the mass of α3β3, 480 kDa. Although we can not exclude the possibility of α3β3, the subunit structure of the carboxyltransferase is tentatively assumed to be α2β2. This assumption accounts for the observed molecular mass of ACCase, about 700 kDa (10.Sasaki Y. Hakamada K. Suama Y. Nagano Y. Furusawa I. Matsuno R. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 25118-25123Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The putative subunit structure of the plstidic ACCase is (BCCP)2 (biotin carboxylase)2 α2β2, as inE. coli (20.Li S.-J. Cronan Jr., J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 16841-16847Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The molecular mass of BCCP and biotin carboxylase was 38 and 53 kDa, respectively. The sum of the calculated molecular mass of (BCCP)2 (biotin carboxylase)2, 180 kDa, and the apparent molecular mass of α2β2, 490 kDa, is 680 kDa and consistent with the observed size of about 700 kDa. The discrepancy in the molecular size between the calculated and the observed values for α2β2 may be due to the abnormal shape of pea carboxyltransferase. The α polypeptide is a basic protein with a calculated pI of 9.7 and has a basic extra domain of pI 9.7 in C-terminal 473 amino acid residues not conserved in E. coli. The β polypeptide is an acidic protein with a pI of 4.3, which has an acidic extra domain with a pI of 3.8 in the N-terminal 226-amino acid residues not conserved in E. coli. Probably both domains electrostatically interact to form carboxyltransferase, and the molecular shape of this carboxyltransferase would not be globular and different from standard marker proteins such as thyroglobulin, apoferritin, catalase, and aldolase used in gel filtration experiments. The apparent molecular mass of the α and the β polypeptides on SDS-PAGE was 98 and 87 kDa, respectively, and larger than the calculated values (10.Sasaki Y. Hakamada K. Suama Y. Nagano Y. Furusawa I. Matsuno R. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 25118-25123Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Such abnormal behavior on SDS-PAGE and on gel filtration is probably caused by the intrinsic amino acid sequence of these polypeptides. The staining level of the carboxyltransferase in Figs. 1 and5 A, showing that the abundance of α-polypeptide exceeded that of β-polypeptide, may not be in agreement with α2β2. However, the staining level of each polypeptide is dependent on its amino acid composition and does not always reflect on the composition of the complex. The discrepancy of the staining level is probably caused by the difference of amino acid composition of the two polypeptides. There are two possibilities for the activation of the recombinant enzyme by DTT: activation by correct refolding of the recombinant protein and activation by redox regulation. The recombinant carboxyltransferase was inactive but was activated by DTT with a similar profile to that of its native counterpart, suggesting that the regulatory cysteines of recombinant enzyme are S-S form and the enzyme is correctly folded like that of the native enzyme. The activation may be caused by reduction of the regulatory S-S bond rather than by correct refolding of recombinant protein by DTT. Monothiol 2-mercaptoethanol that can refold the recombinant protein but is not a strong reductant of S-S bond did not activate the enzyme at a concentration lower than 8 mm, supporting this proposition. Pea biotin carboxylase similarly expressed in E. coli was active in the absence of DTT and insensitive to redox, 2A. Kozaki, K. Kamada, Y. Nagano, H. Iguchi, and Y. Sasaki, unpublished data. although there are eight cysteine residues conserved among plants. Thus, the sensitivity of the recombinant carboxyltransferase and biotin carboxylase to redox supports the previous finding that carboxyltransferase but not biotin carboxylase in ACCase is redox-regulated (8.Kozaki A. Sasaki Y. Biochem. J. 1999; 339: 541-546Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). The recombinant enzyme and its native counterpart showed no sensitivity to pH over the range 6.5–8.5. However, carboxyltransferase activity in ACCase showed a remarkable sensitivity to pH (8.Kozaki A. Sasaki Y. Biochem. J. 1999; 339: 541-546Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). This indicates that association of carboxyltransferase with biotin carboxylase and BCCP results in a change in the pH preference of carboxyltransferase. When pea ACCase was analyzed by ion exchange chromatography, it dissociated into two components, carboxyltransferase and biotin carboxylase complexed with BCCP (11.Shorrosh B.S. Savage L.J. Söll T. Ohlrogge J.B. Plant J. 1996; 10: 261-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). This means that ACCase is formed by ionic association of the two components. This association affects the pH preference of carboxyltransferase and results in a marked change in catalytic activity at the physiological pH range, pH 7–8. Activation of fatty acid synthesis by light is caused partly by activation of the regulatory enzyme ACCase. ACCase is stimulated by the transition of the stroma from pH 7 to pH 8 upon irradiation and by the thiol-reducing agent produced by light (7.Sasaki Y. Kozaki A. Hatano M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 11096-11101Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). The stimulation may consist of at least two features. One is the association of the two components, carboxyltransferase and biotin carboxylase complexed with BCCP, resulting in remarkable changes in pH preference at physiological pH range. The other may be the reduction of S-S bond of cysteine residues in the carboxyltransferase. Further studies on ACCase using recombinant enzyme are necessary to understand this enzyme at the molecular level. A recent report described the carboxyltransferase β-subunit as a candidate for regulation by protein phosphorylation/dephosphorylation (21.Savage L.J. Ohlrogge J.B. Plant J. 1999; 18: 521-527Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). The recombinant carboxyltransferase now provides us with ample amounts of enzyme for structure/function studies. We thank P. Schürmann for spinach thioredoxin-f and H. Mori for analysis of protein sequences."

J. 1997; 327: 759-764Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). The addition ofN-linked core oligosaccharides to membrane and secretory glycoproteins occurs co-translationally at asparagine residues in the tripeptide sequon Asn-Xaa-Ser/Thr soon after translocation of the nascent polypeptide into the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). However, the presence of the sequon does not ensure core glycosylation, as many proteins contain sequons that remain either unglycosylated or glycosylated to a variable extent (11.Allen S. Naim H.Y. Bulleid N.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 4797-4804Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). N-Glycosyl sugar chains are core-glycosylated in the ER and become complex glycosylated by passing through the Golgi apparatus. AlthoughN-glycosylation in the ER constitutes the critical step in the initial folding of proteins, the complex glycosylated chains in some glycoproteins, acquired in the Golgi, are also required for the acquisition of a correct conformation (12.Loo T.W. Clarke D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 14671-14674Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Several roles forN-linked oligosaccharides in protein folding have been described so far. Their presence assists folding by facilitating disulfide bond formation (11.Allen S. Naim H.Y. Bulleid N.J.

Helenius A. Cell. 1995; 81: 425-433Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (490) Google Scholar). The absence of N-glycosyl chains influences the quaternary structure of proteins as has been demonstrated for the dimerization of MUC2 mucin (16.Asker N. Axelsson M.A.B. Olofsson S.-O. Hansson G.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 18857-18863Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Also highly glycosylated protein domains, like the carboxyl-terminal peptide (CTP) of the human placental hormone CG-β subunit, can participate in the folding of the whole subunit (17.Muyan M. Boime I. Mol. Endocrinol. 1998; 12: 766-772PubMed Google Scholar). We used human lactase-phlorizin hydrolase (EC 3.2.1.23–3.2.1.62) (LPH) as the appropriate model protein to study the influence ofN-glycosyl sugar chains on the folding of single protein domains. This enzyme is synthesized in intestinal cells as a pro-LPH that undergoes one intracellular proteolytic cleavage in the Golgi apparatus to generate a mature LPHβinitial that is targeted with high fidelity to the apical membrane. A final cleavage step takes place in the intestinal lumen by trypsin to generate LPHβfinal that exerts its biological function in hydrolyzing lactose. Pro-LPH consists of four homologous regions with 38–55% homology and is associated with the plasma-membrane via a membrane anchor at the COOH terminus of the LPHβfinaldomain (18.Mantei N. Villa M. Enzler T. Wacker H. Boll W. James P. Hunziker W. Semenza G. EMBO J. 1988; 7: 2705-2713Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). The different protein domains are likely involved together or independently in the folding of pro-LPH. Most notably is the critical role of the profragment, LPHα, in the maturation of LPHβinitial (19.Wuthrich M. Grunberg J. Hahn D. Jacob R. Radebach I. Naim H.Y. Sterchi E.E. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1996; 336: 27-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar, 20.Jacob R. Radebach I. Wuthrich M. Grunberg J. Sterchi E.E. Naim H.Y. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 236: 789-795Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Deletion of this NH2-terminal domain leads to a drastic reduction in the proportion of correctly folded and transport-competent molecules (21.Naim H.Y. Jacob R. Naim H. Sambrook J.F. Gething M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 26933-26943Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar,22.Oberholzer T. Mantei N. Semenza G. FEBS Lett. 1993; 333: 127-131Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Apart from the LPHα domain, the transmembrane and perhaps also the cytoplasmic domains of pro-LPH play a key role in acquisition of a correct dimeric protein structure (23.Naim H.Y. Naim H. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 70: 198-208PubMed Google Scholar) and transport competence of the enzyme (24.Panzer P. Preuss U. Joberty G. Naim H.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 13861-13869Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). The homologous region IV contains a subdomain with structural characteristics of unfolded, highlyO-glycosylated stalk regions found in a variety of membrane proteins such as low density lipoprotein receptor, sucrase isomaltase, and aminopeptidase N (25.Hunziker W. Spiess M. Semenza G. Lodish H.F. Cell. 1986; 46: 227-234Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar, 26.Olsen J. Cowell G.M. Konigshofer E. Danielsen E.M. Moller J. Laustsen L. Hansen O.C. Welinder K.G. Engberg J. Hunziker W. FEBS Lett. 1988; 238: 307-314Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). This domain harbors the catalytic site of the lactose hydrolytic activity. We could show that deletion of 236 amino acids located in the immediate vicinity of the membrane in homologous region IV had almost no influence on the quaternary structure, transport, and sorting of LPH to the plasma membrane (24.Panzer P. Preuss U. Joberty G. Naim H.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 13861-13869Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). By contrast, a further deletion of 87 amino acids upstream of the 236-amino acid stretch have led to an inhibition of the dimerization event and to a substantial reduction in the transport capacity of the deletion mutant. This suggested that the last 236 amino acids of domain IV fold independently of the extracellular domain and might function as a link between the globular protein and the membrane by forming a stalk region. Structural predictions of the first 20 amino acids of the deleted region reveal an α-helical structure similar to the stalk of aminopeptidase-N (27.Vogel L.K. Noren O. Sjostrom H. FEBS Lett. 1992; 308: 14-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Additionally, according to data derived from a survey of large number of O-glycosylation sites (28.Wilson I.B. Gavel Y. von Heijne G. Biochem. J. 1991; 275: 529-534Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar), the first 50 amino acids of the deleted region contain several potentialO-glycosylation sites, which are presumably glycosylated in the mature form of LPH (amino acids 869–1927) (29.Naim H.Y. Lentze M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 25494-25504Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In this paper we addressed the role of this domain in the context of the overall folding of pro-LPH by introducing potential N-glycosylation sites into this domain. We demonstrate that the mutated constructs are at least partially misfolded and transported to the cell surface at markedly lower rates than the wild-type species. The effect of the additional N-glycosylation sites is in all likelihood limited to the folding of a region including the 236 amino acids stretch, but nevertheless implicates the dimerization event and subsequent trafficking of the mutants.

Oligonucleotide-directed mutagenesis was performed with the “Altered SitesTM in Vitro mutagenesis System” from Promega Corp., Madison, WI.

The plasmid pLPH containing the full-length cDNA of LPH inserted into the unique EcoRI site of vector pGEM4Z (30.Naim H.Y. Lacey S.W. Sambrook J.F. Gething M.J. J. Biol.

This construct was the template for all three mutagenesis reactions with the Altered SitesTM in Vitro Mutagenesis System. Mutagenized plasmids were sequenced to confirm the mutagenesis reaction and cloned back into the full-length LPH cDNA. For expression in COS-1 cells, the pSG8-LPHI1697N, pSG8-LPHD1711N, and pSG8-LPHP1743S expression vectors were constructed by ligating the full-length LPH cDNA clones into the uniqueEcoRI site of the pSG8 vector. TheEcoRI/ScaI fragment from pLPH (30.Naim H.Y. Lacey S.W. Sambrook J.F. Gething M.J. J. Biol.

For the generation of the LAC236-GFP series the signal sequence of LPH, LPHsignal, was synthesized at first by polymerase chain reaction using full-length LPH cDNA as template as described (21.Naim H.Y. Jacob R. Naim H. Sambrook J.F. Gething M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 26933-26943Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Another cDNA comprising the last 20 nucleotides of LPHsignal (nucleotides 52–71) and nucleotides 4955 to 4974 of pro-LPH were synthesized by polymerase chain reaction using pLPH, pSG8-LPHI1697N, pSG8-LPHD1711N, or pSG8-LPHP1743S as template and the following oligonucleotides: LPHsig/1646, GTTTTTCATGCTGGGGGTCACGTGACAGGAGCTTGGCTGC, and cLPH6869, CTCTAACGGTGCAGCAGGAC. The resulting DNA molecules were fused to LPHsignal in four different assembly polymerase chain reactions. The reaction products were each digested withEcoRI/ScaI and cloned in-frame into the polycloning site of peGFP-N1 (CLONTECH) to create pLAC236wt-GFP, pLAC236I1697N-GFP, pLAC236D1711N-GFP, and pLAC236P1743S-GFP. The sequence of the constructs was confirmed by DNA sequencing. COS-1-cells were cultured in DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 50 units/ml penicillin, and 50 mg/ml streptomycin (denoted complete medium). They were transfected without DNA (mock) or 2 μg of the appropriate recombinant DNA using DEAE-dextran essentially as described before (30.Naim H.Y. Lacey S.W. Sambrook J.F. Gething M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 12313-12320Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Transiently transfected COS-1 cells were labeled 48–60 h post-transfection with 80 μCi of [35S]methionine in methionine-free DMEM containing 2% fetal calf serum, 50 units/ml penicillin, and 50 mg/ml streptomycin (denoted Met-free medium). In pulse-chase experiments labeling was performed for 1 h at 37 °C followed by a chase with non-labeled methionine for different periods of time. The labeled cells were rinsed two times with phosphate-buffered saline. Cells were solubilized with 1 ml/dish of cold lysis buffer essentially as described before (24.Panzer P. Preuss U. Joberty G. Naim H.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 13861-13869Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). The cell extracts were centrifuged to remove nuclei and debris. Thereafter the supernatants were incubated with mouse anti-human lactase-phlorizin hydrolase monoclonal antibody HBB 1/909/34/74 (31.Hauri H.P. Sterchi E.E. Bienz D. Fransen J.A. Marxer A. J.

Hauri (Biocenter, Basel, Switzerland) or with the mouse anti-GFP antibody B34 (Babco) and precipitated with protein A-Sepharose. Following immunoprecipitation, the protein A-Sepharose beads were washed 3 times with washing buffer A (0.5% Triton X-100, 0.05% sodium deoxycholate in phosphate-buffered saline) and 3 times with washing buffer B (500 mm NaCl, 10 mm EDTA, 0.5% Triton X-100 in 125 mm Tris/HCl, pH 8.0) prior to analysis of the samples by SDS-PAGE and fluorography. Cells transfected with constructs containing GFP were also fixed with 3% paraformaldehyde 48 h post-transfection and the recombinant proteins were visualized by confocal laser microscopy (Leica TCS SP). Lactase activity was measured according to Dahlqvist (33.Dahlqvist A. Anal. Biochem. 1968; 22: 99-107Crossref PubMed Scopus (1021) Google Scholar) using lactose (Fluka) as substrate. Detergent extracts of transfected COS-1 cells (10 dishes of confluent cells) were used for immunoprecipitation of LPH. The immunoprecipitates were subsequently assayed for lactase activity essentially as described by Naim et al. (30.Naim H.Y. Lacey S.W. Sambrook J.F. Gething M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 12313-12320Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Immunoprecipitates from biosynthetically labeled COS-1 cells were treated with 0.5 mg of the pancreatic protease trypsin at 37 °C for 0, 5, or 15 min, and the reaction was stopped by the addition of 2 mg of soybean trypsin inhibitor (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) at 4 °C followed by boiling in SDS-PAGE sample buffer. According to Ref. 24.Panzer P. Preuss U. Joberty G. Naim H.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 13861-13869Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar, transfected COS-1 cells were labeled 48 h post-transfection for 6 h with [35S]methionine, washed two times with phosphate-buffered saline, and solubilized in 500 μl of 6 mm n-dodecyl-β-d-maltoside, 50 mmTris/HCl, 100 mm NaCl, pH 7.4, and a mixture of protease inhibitors. To remove nuclei and debris the cell extracts were centrifuged for 20 min at 17,000 × g at 4 °C. The supernatants were layered onto a continuous gradient from 10 to 30% or 5 to 25% (w/v) sucrose. After centrifugation for 22 h at 100,000 × g at 4 °C, different fractions were collected and immunoprecipitated with mAb anti-LPH or mAb anti-GFP and analyzed on 6% SDS-PAGE. Digestion of 35S-labeled immunoprecipitates with endo-β-N-acetylglucosaminidase H (endo H) and endo-β-N-acetylglucosaminidase F/glycopeptidase F (endo F/GF) was performed as described previously (34.Naim H.Y. Sterchi E.E. Lentze M.J. Biochem. J. 1987; 241: 427-434Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). Truncation of 236 amino acids immediately upstream of the membrane anchor of LPH did not affect the quaternary structure, transport competence, or polarized sorting of the enzyme (24.Panzer P. Preuss U. Joberty G. Naim H.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 13861-13869Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). These data suggested that this stretch (LAC236), which lies in the homologous region IV of LPH, is independently folded and is probably a linker between the transmembrane of LPH and the remainder of its ectodomain. To investigate this hypothesis and explore further structural features and the role of this region within the ectodomain of LPH, we introduced mutations that result in potential N-glycosylation sites (sequon Asn-X-Ser/Thr). The mutants contained one of the following amino acid substitutions: Ile1697 to Asn1697 (LPHI1697N), Asp1711 to Asn1711 (LPHD1711N), and Pro1743 to Ser1743 (LPHP1743S) (Fig.1). The influence of these mutations on the biosynthesis, folding, and transport of pro-LPH was investigated in COS cells transfected with expression vectors containing the mutated LPH cDNAs. Fig. 2 shows an SDS-PAGE analysis of the immunoprecipitated mutants. Within 6 h of biosynthetic labeling each mutant revealed two polypeptides. Treatment of these forms with endo H demonstrated the type of glycosylation of these forms. The higher molecular mass species (∼230 kDa) were resistant to endo H indicating their complex type of glycosylation, while the smaller polypeptides (∼215 kDa) were sensitive and shifted to approximately 200-kDa band (Fig. 2 B). In analogy with wild-type pro-LPH, these forms correspond to the mannose-rich (∼215 kDa) and complex glycosylated (∼230 kDa) species and could both be deglycosylated by treatment with endo F/GF. The introduced potentialN-glycosylation sites in pro-LPHI1697N, pro-LPHD1711N, and pro-LPHP1743S could be electrophoretically demonstrated to be indeed glycosylated when compared with wild-type pro-LPH. The mannose-rich polypeptides as well as their complex glycosylated forms revealed slight shifts in their apparent molecular masses as compared with their wild-type counterparts (indicated by the asterisk). In contrast to the complex glycosylated counterparts, the endo H-treated deglycosylated mannose-rich forms of the mutants and wild-type pro-LPH shifted to identical apparent molecular weights. Variations in the apparent molecular weights of the complex glycosylated pro-LPH glycoforms could be detected, whereby wild-type pro-LPH was smaller than each of the mutated proteins (pro-LPHc versuspro-LPHc*). Since the N-deglycosylated mannose-rich pro-LPH molecules are all of the same size, an increase in molecular weight is the consequence of additionalN-glycosylation at the added sites. In addition to size shifts, variations in the proportions of the complex glycosylated forms of the mutants as compared with wild-type pro-LPH could be detected. We therefore compared the transport kinetics of pro-LPHI1697N, pro-LPHD1711N, and pro-LPHP1743S with those of wild-type pro-LPH by applying a pulse-chase protocol. The results are shown in Fig. 3. Mutant forms and wild-type pro-LPH were detected exclusively as mannose-rich species after 1 h of pulse. Wild-type pro-LPH was processed in the Golgi apparatus much faster than the mutants. Within 2 h of chase complex glycosylated pro-LPH appeared, while 4 to 8 h were required to see the complex glycosylated species of pro-LPHI1697N, pro-LPHD1711N, and pro-LPHP1743S. While approximately 50% of wild-type pro-LPH was converted to a complex glycosylated species within 12 h of chase, 20% of pro-LPHI1697N, 25% of pro-LPHD1711N, and only 18% of pro-LPHP1743S were found as complex glycosylated species within an identical chase period (see Fig. 3 B). Taken together, the results demonstrate that the glycosylation mutants were transported to the Golgi apparatus, albeit at a much slower rate than wild-type pro-LPH.Figure 2Expression of wild-type pro-LPH , pro-LPHI1697N, pro-LPHD1711N, and pro-LPHP1743S in COS-1 cells. Transfected COS-1 cells were labeled for 6 h (pro-LPHwt) or 10 h (pro-LPHI1697N, pro-LPHD1711N, and pro-LPHP1743S) with [35S]methionine.

We investigated therefore the folding properties of the mutants as compared with wild-type pro-LPH by utilizing (i) enzymatic activity assays and (ii) protease sensitivity. COS-1 cells were transiently transfected with the cDNAs of pro-LPHI1697N, pro-LPHD1711N, pro-LPHP1743S, and wild-type pro-LPH and were labeled for 6 h with [35S]methionine. The cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with mAb anti-LPH (HBB). Part of each immunoprecipitate was separated by SDS-PAGE to confirm the expression of the expected species, while the remainder was assayed for enzymatic activity using lactose as a substrate. The electrophoretic analysis revealed the expected molecular forms (not shown, but refer to Fig. 2). The enzymatic activities of the three N-glycosylation mutants reached only background levels indicating that the mutants are not active. The wild-type pro-LPH control was as expected enzymatically active with a specific activity levels similar to that reported previously (5.6–5.8 × 109 IU/mol) (30.Naim H.Y. Lacey S.W. Sambrook J.F. Gething M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 12313-12320Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The activity site of lactase within pro-LPH has been assigned to glutamic acid residues 1271 and 1747 in rabbit LPH (32.Wacker H. Keller P. Falchetto R. Legler G. Semenza G. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 18744-18752Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). One explanation for the lack of enzymatic activity in the three mutants are misfolded structures around glutamic acid 1747, which lies in a close proximity to the mutations made in pro-LPHI1697N, pro-LPHD1711N, and pro-LPHP1743S. We probed the folding pattern of the mutants by using a trypsin sensitivity assay. Trypsin cleaves correctly folded pro-LPH to a 160-kDa LPHβfinal mature enzyme which is resistant toward further protease treatment (30.Naim H.Y. Lacey S.W. Sambrook J.F. Gething M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 12313-12320Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A change in the trypsin cleavage pattern is compatible with altered protein folding, since novel trypsin cleavage sites become exposed which are normally shielded in the core of the correctly folded native protein (30.Naim H.Y. Lacey S.W. Sambrook J.F. Gething M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 12313-12320Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar,35.Jacob R. Bulleid N.J. Naim H.Y. J. Biol.

Pro-LPH was immunoprecipitated from transfected COS-1 cells labeled with [35S]methionine for 10 h and the immunoprecipitates were treated with trypsin for 5 or 15 min at 37 °C. As shown in Fig. 4 the 160-kDa LPHβfinal appeared within 5 min of trypsin treatment and persisted at the same size and intensity after 15 min of digestion. By contrast, a similar band did not appear when the mutants were treated with trypsin. Faint bands corresponding to the pro-LPH glycoforms were still observed in the 5-min time point, but these forms were completely degraded within 15 min of trypsin treatment. Taken together, the lack of enzymatic activity and the accessibility to degradation by trypsin strongly suggest that pro-LPHI1697N, pro-LPHD1711N, and pro-LPHP1743S have"

Two distinct factor-DNA complexes are formed with the C1 element in the gel mobility shift assay, termed RIPE3b1 and RIPE3b2 (6.Shieh S.-Y. Tsai M.-J. J. Biol.

Tsai M.-J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 16708-16714Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The RIPE3b2 complex is composed of at least three subunits, p58, p62, and p110 (30.Shieh S.-Y.

The importance of the RIPE3b2 activator in insulin gene expression is unclear, although it is not believed to have a role in β cell-specific activation (6.Shieh S.-Y. Tsai M.-J. J. Biol.

The binding of RIPE3b1 is also decreased in parallel with the reduction in insulin gene transcription when β cells are chronically exposed to supraphysiological glucose concentrations (31.Sharma A.

The observation that the phosphorylation level of PDX-1 is induced in glucose-stimulated β cells upon activation of DNA binding (36.Macfarlane W.M. Read M.L. Gilligan M. Bujalska I. Docherty K.

To address this issue, we determined the protein composition of the RIPE3b1 activator complex. Our analysis of sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE)-fractionated β cell nuclear extracts revealed that RIPE3b1 binding was mediated by a protein(s) of roughly 43 kDa. Several proteins (i.e. 51, 45, and 38 kDa) within this molecular mass range were also independently shown to be within the RIPE3b1 complex by ultraviolet light (UV) cross-linking analysis. In addition, we demonstrated that protein phosphatase treatment reduced RIPE3b1 binding activity in β cell nuclear extracts. These results suggest that phosphorylation mechanisms are also important in controlling RIPE3b1 activator function. The −238WT CAT plasmid contains sequences from −238 to +2 bp of the rat insulin II enhancer/promoter region linked to the chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) reporter gene (39.Robinson G.L.

Glucose-treated MIN6 cells were first washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline and then cultured in medium containing 1 mm glucose for 12 h, before growing the cells in 1, 3, or 20 mmglucose-supplemented medium for 24 h. The insulin:CAT constructs were transiently transfected by the calcium phosphate coprecipitation (HIT T-15; 2 × 106 cells) (7.Sharma A. Stein R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 871-879Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) or LipofectAMINE (βTC-3; 1 × 106 cells) procedures (LipofectAMINE Reagent, Life Technologies, Inc.). The precipitates used for the HIT T-15 transfections (13.5 μg total) contained 2.5 μg of −238CAT and pRSVLUC, whereas 1 μg of each plasmid (2 μg total) was used with βTC-3 cells. The Rous sarcoma virus (RSV) enhancer-driven luciferase (LUC) expression plasmid, pRSVLUC (45.De Wet J.R. Wood K.V. DeLuca M. Helinski D.R. Subramani S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 725-737Crossref PubMed Scopus (2482) Google Scholar), was used as a recovery marker. HIT T-15 cells were treated with 20% glycerol (2 min) 4 h after the addition of the calcium phosphate DNA precipitate. Extracts were prepared 40–48 h after transfection and LUC and CAT enzymatic assays performed as described by DeWet et al. (45.De Wet J.R. Wood K.V. DeLuca M. Helinski D.R. Subramani S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 725-737Crossref PubMed Scopus (2482) Google Scholar) and Nordeenet al. (46.Nordeen S.K. Green III, P.P. Fowlkes D.M. DNA (N. Y.). 1987; 6: 173-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar), respectively. The CAT activity from the reporter construct was normalized to the LUC activity of the cotransfected internal control plasmid. Each experiment was carried out at least three times. Nuclear extracts were prepared as described by Schreiber et al. (47.Schreiber E. Matthias P. Muller M.M. Schaffner W. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 6419Crossref PubMed Scopus (3918) Google Scholar), except that 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride was included in the nuclear resuspension buffer. Binding reactions (20 μl) were conducted in the binding buffer (10 mm HEPES (pH 7.4), 100 mm NaCl, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 1 μg of poly(dI-dC), 10% (v/v) glycerol). Approximately 15 μg of extract protein was used per gel mobility shift sample. Each of the rat insulin II −126/−101-bp oligonucleotides used to detect RIPE3b1/C1 element binding were first subcloned into pGEM7 (Stratagene). Excised, purified double-stranded fragments were used in the binding reactions. The −126/−101-bp probe was labeled with [α-32P]dATP by incubation with the Klenow fragment of Escherichia coli DNA polymerase I. The conditions for the competition analyses were the same, except that a 200-fold excess of the specific competitor DNAs was included in the mixture prior to addition of extract. The double-stranded oligonucleotides corresponded to the following: wild type, −126 TGGAAACTGCAGCTTCAGCCCCTCTG −101; −114 Mutant, −126 TGGAAACTGCAGATTCAGCCCCTCTG −101; −111 Mutant, −126 TGGAAACTGCAGCTTAAGCCCCTCTG −101; −108/−107 Mutant, −126 TGGAAACTGCAGCTTCAGAACCTCTG −101. The mutated nucleotides are underlined. After incubating the reactions at room temperature for 20 min, the binding complexes were resolved by electrophoretic separation on a 6% non-denaturing polyacrylamide gel using high ionic strength polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis conditions (7.Sharma A. Stein R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 871-879Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The gel was then dried, and the labeled DNA-protein complexes were localized by autoradiography. The UV cross-linking experiments were conducted essentially as described by Shieh and Tsai (6.Shieh S.-Y. Tsai M.-J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 16708-16714Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The gel mobility shift binding reaction was scaled up by 10-fold and conducted in a 96-well plate as described above. The plastic-wrapped plate was irradiated with 254 nm UV light at a distance of 1 cm at 4 °C for 45 min. The complexes were resolved on a 6% non-denaturing polyacrylamide gel. After locating the binding complexes by brief autoradiography, the RIPE3b1 complex was specifically excised, and the gel piece was minced and mixed with 200 μl of elution buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 0.2 mm EDTA, 0.1% SDS, 1× protease inhibitor mixture solution (Roche Molecular Biochemicals)) and rotated at 4 °C overnight. The eluate was mixed with 1× SDS loading buffer, boiled, and loaded onto a 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel. After electrophoresis, the gel was dried and subjected to autoradiography. The molecular size of the protein-C1 element DNA complexes were determined by comparison with Colored Rainbow protein molecular weight markers (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) run in the same gel. βTC-3 cell nuclear extract (30 μg) was separated on a 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel and then electrotransferred onto an Immobilon polyvinylidene fluoride membrane (Millipore). The βTC-3 extract lane was cut horizontally into 4-mm slices to represent different molecular weight fractions. The proteins from each fraction were eluted at 4 °C in 60 μl of elution buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 100 mm NaCl, 10% (v/v) glycerol, 1 mm EDTA, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 1× protease inhibitor mixture solution, 1% (v/v) Triton X-100) for 4 h (48.Faber M. Sealy L. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 22243-22254Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The molecular sizes of the protein-C1 element DNA complexes were determined by comparison with Colored Rainbow protein molecular weight markers. Each fraction was analyzed for insulin −126/−101-bp binding activity in the gel mobility shift assay. βTC-3 nuclear extracts were prepared as described above except that 10 mm sodium fluoride and 1 mm sodium orthovanadate were added to the final resuspension buffer. Three micrograms (20 μl total reaction volume) of the βTC-3 nuclear extract (or Immobilon fraction 6) was incubated at 30 °C for 20 min in 1× phosphatase buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1 mm EGTA, 2 mm MgCl2, 1× protease inhibitor mixture solution) with different concentrations of calf intestinal alkaline phosphatase (20 units/μl (Promega)) or a rat brain phosphatase catalytic subunit mixture in the presence or absence of 50 mm sodium pyrophosphate. The brain protein phosphatase catalytic subunit-enriched preparation was prepared by ethanol precipitation of a rat brain soluble extract (49.MacMillan L.B. Bass M.A. Cheng N. Howard E.F. Tamura M. Strack S. Wadzinski B.E. Colbran R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 35845-35854Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). This extract was shown to contain catalytic subunits of PP1 and PP2A, the major divalent cation-independent protein phosphatases in mammalian tissues; the unit phosphatase activity per microliter was 360 fmol/min using glycogen phosphorylase as substrate, of which greater than 95% of the activity was inhibited by 2.5 μm okadaic acid (49.MacMillan L.B. Bass M.A. Cheng N. Howard E.F. Tamura M. Strack S. Wadzinski B.E. Colbran R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 35845-35854Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). After phosphatase treatment, 25 μl of 2× binding buffer was added and the sample analyzed for insulin −126/−101-bp probe binding. RIPE3b1 complex binding was only detected in HIT T-15 β extracts, when gel mobility shift binding assays were performed with nuclear extracts prepared from a β (HIT T-15) and two non-β cell lines (BHK, HeLa) (6.Shieh S.-Y. Tsai M.-J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 16708-16714Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To assess more generally the distribution of the RIPE3b1 activator, binding experiments were performed with the −126/−101-bp C1 element probe and nuclear extracts prepared from several β (βTC-3, MIN-6, INS-1, and HIT T-15) and non-β cell lines, including islet α (αTC-6), exocrine pancreas (AR42J), liver (H4IIE), and fibroblast (NIH3T3) cells. The RIPE3b1 complex was detected in each of the β cell nuclear extracts but in none of the non-β extracts (Fig. 1 A). In addition, RIPE3b1 binding activity was also inducible at physiologic glucose concentrations in MIN6 cells (Fig. 1 B). Thus, RIPE3b1 binding increased significantly in cells cultured in 3 and 20 mm glucose when compared with 1 mm (Fig.1 B). RIPE3b1 binding is similarly regulated by glucose in HIT T-15 (7.Sharma A. Stein R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 871-879Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), βTC-3 (16.Sharma A. Fusco-DeMane D. Henderson E. Efrat S. Stein R. Mol. Endocrinol. 1995; 9: 1468-1476PubMed Google Scholar), and βTC-6 (16.Sharma A. Fusco-DeMane D. Henderson E. Efrat S. Stein R. Mol. Endocrinol. 1995; 9: 1468-1476PubMed Google Scholar) cells. The change in RIPE3b1 activity appears to be specific as binding to the insulin E1 activator (7.Sharma A. Stein R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 871-879Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 16.Sharma A. Fusco-DeMane D. Henderson E. Efrat S. Stein R. Mol. Endocrinol. 1995; 9: 1468-1476PubMed Google Scholar) and ubiquitous major late transcription factor (7, 16, data not shown) was unchanged under these conditions. Furthermore, a mutant that prevented RIPE3b1 binding reduced glucose-inducible insulin reporter gene activity in transfected MIN6 (data not shown), HIT T-15 (7.Sharma A. Stein R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 871-879Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), βTC-3 (16.Sharma A. Fusco-DeMane D. Henderson E. Efrat S. Stein R. Mol. Endocrinol. 1995; 9: 1468-1476PubMed Google Scholar), and βTC-6 (16.Sharma A. Fusco-DeMane D. Henderson E. Efrat S. Stein R. Mol. Endocrinol. 1995; 9: 1468-1476PubMed Google Scholar) cells. Together, these results strongly suggest that RIPE3b1 is a β cell-specific, physiologically responsive, transcriptional regulator of the insulin gene. In order to understand more fully the role of the RIPE3b1 in C1 element-mediated transcriptional stimulation of the insulin gene, experiments were performed to identify the RIPE3b1 complex:C1 element contact sites relevant to activation and binding. Methylation interference analysis has shown that RIPE3b1 strongly contacts the bottom strand Gs in the C1 element at −111, −108, and −107, as well as the G at −114 weakly (6.Shieh S.-Y. Tsai M.-J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 16708-16714Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A mutation in the region of the −111G prevents C1 element activation and RIPE3b1 binding (6.Shieh S.-Y. Tsai M.-J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 16708-16714Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar); two nucleotides were modified in this mutant (−112/AG/−111 to −112/GC/−111; Fig. 2). To define more comprehensively the role of the G nucleotide contacts in RIPE3b1 function, site-directed mutations within the nucleotides at −114, −108, and −107 were constructed within the context of an insulin enhancer/promoter-driven CAT reporter construct spanning the −238 to +2-bp region of the rat insulin II gene. Their effect on activation was compared with the −112/GC/−111 mutant and the wild type −238CAT construct in transfected HIT T-15 and βTC-3 cells (Fig.2 B). The results clearly show that G mutations within the strong RIPE3b1 contact sites at −111, −108, and −107 bp reduce −238 CAT activity, whereas the weak interaction site at −114 bp has no effect. The gel shift assay was used to determine the importance of the G residues at nucleotides −114, −111, −108, and −107 in RIPE3b1 binding in βTC-3 cell nuclear extracts. The specificity of binding was determined in competition assays in which wild type and mutant alleles of the C1 element were used as competitors. The pattern of competition with the various alleles of C1 was as predicted (Fig.3). Thus, mutant forms that reduce insulin reporter gene transcription in transfected cells are not efficient competitors for formation of the RIPE3b1 complex in vitro. Neither the −111 nor −108/−107 mutant form of C1 competed well, whereas the −114 mutant competed as effectively as the wild type. The −112/GC/−111 mutant competitor also had no effect on RIPE3b1 binding levels (6.Shieh S.-Y. Tsai M.-J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 16708-16714Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 7.Sharma A. Stein R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 871-879Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 31.Sharma A. Olson L.K. Robertson R.P. Stein R. Mol. Endocrinol. 1995; 9: 1127-1134Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), indicating that only the G residue at nucleotide −111 within this mutant was essential in binding. The RIPE3b2 complex was not detected in our gel shift reaction assays due to the nonspecific poly(dI-dC) competitor concentration in the binding reaction (Fig. 3; data not shown). Analogous results were obtained with the RIPE3b1 complex formed in HIT T-15, MIN6, and INS-1 extracts (data not shown). Together, these data strongly suggest that the G residues at −111, −108, and −107 are critical for binding and activation of a protein(s) contained within the β cell-specific RIPE3b1 complex. To estimate the size of the RIPE3b1 DNA-binding complex, βTC-3 nuclear extracts were separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred onto an Immobilon polyvinylidene fluoride membrane, which was cut into slices, and the fractionated proteins were eluted. C1 element binding was then measured in each of the renatured fractions. The binding activity in fractions 6 and 7 comigrated with the RIPE3b1 complex found in unfractionated βTC-3 extracts (Fig.4 A). No change in the mobility of this complex was observed when extracts from other fractions were combined with either fraction 6 or 7 (data not shown), suggesting that these fractions contain the principal RIPE3b1-binding protein(s). Importantly, the binding specificity of these fractions also corresponds to RIPE3b1, as fraction 6 binding was unaffected in competition assays with mutants (i.e. −111 mutant) that disrupted RIPE3b1 binding but eliminated by the wild type or −114 mutant (Fig. 5, data not shown). The molecular mass range of the proteins in fractions 6 and 7 was 37.1 to 49.1 kDa. These results indicate that the RIPE3b1 activator complex is composed of one or more proteins of approximately 43 kDa.Figure 5Binding of the SDS-PAGE fraction 6 to C1 element sequences. Binding reactions were conducted with the −126/−101-bp probe with unfractionated βTC-3 nuclear extracts (βTC-3 NE) and SDS-PAGE fraction 6 (fraction 6) either alone (−) or in the presence of a molar excess (20-fold, βTC-3 NE; 5-fold, fraction 6) of wild type or −111 mutant competitor to probe. WT, wild type.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To define more precisely the protein composition of the RIPE3b1 complex, we performed in situ UV cross-linking analysis. The βTC-3 binding reactions were first irradiated with UV light, and then the RIPE3b1 complex was excised after electrophoresis on a non-denaturing polyacrylamide gel. The cross-linked RIPE3b1 protein(s):C1 element species were separated by SDS-PAGE and visualized by autoradiography. The analysis revealed at least three C1-binding polypeptides, with apparent molecular masses 70.7 ± 0.8, 65.3 ± 0.7, and 58.3 ± 3.3 kDa (Fig.6). The specificity of these interactions with the C1 element was confirmed by the fact that the wild type competitor, but not a binding defective mutant (i.e. −111 mutant), could prevent their formation (Fig. 6). In addition, these complexes were not detected in the absence of UV irradiation or when either the labeled −111 or −108/−107 mutant oligonucleotides were used as probes (data not shown). Similar results were obtained using HIT T-15 and MIN6 nuclear extracts (data not shown). Upon subtraction of the molecular mass of the C1 DNA probe (approximately 20 kDa), the sizes of the cross-linked polypeptides were calculated to be 51, 45, and 38 kDa, which is in agreement with the molecular weight range of the SDS-PAGE separated proteins in fractions 6 and 7. RIPE3b1 and PDX-1 binding activities are induced at glucose levels that potentiate insulin gene transcription and insulin secretion within β cells (13.German M.S. Wang J. Mol. Cell.

Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1996; 8: 205-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (1165) Google Scholar, 51.Hunter T. Karin M. Cell. 1992; 70: 375-387Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1120) Google Scholar). To determine if the phosphorylation status of RIPE3b1 influences DNA binding, βTC-3 extracts were incubated in the absence or presence of increasing amounts of calf intestinal alkaline phosphatase (CIAP). RIPE3b1 DNA binding activity was inhibited by CIAP treatment in a dose-dependent manner (Fig.7 A). The effect of CIAP on RIPE3b1 binding was essentially blocked by coincubating the enzyme with 50 mm sodium pyrophosphate, a general phosphatase inhibitor. However, the mobility of the RIPE3b1 binding complex was more diffuse under these conditions (Fig. 7 A), which could result from the phosphatase and/or proteolysis changing the mobility of the RIPE3b1/C1-binding protein(s) in the extract. Since the binding activity of the generally distributed adenovirus-5 major late transcription factor was unaffected in these extracts (data not shown), it is unlikely that the change in RIPE3b1 binding activity results from proteolysis. Further evidence supporting that this was a specific effect of CIAP was established by performing the reactions with a distinct protein phosphatase preparation from rat brain. RIPE3b1 activity in βTC-3 extracts was also reduced in a dose-dependent fashion under these conditions (Fig. 7 B). However, in contrast to CIAP, 50 mm sodium pyrophosphate treatment completely blocked the phosphatase activity in the brain preparation. In addition, the CIAP (data not shown) or brain phosphatase(s) (Fig. 7 C) reduced RIPE3b1 binding activity in SDS-PAGE fraction 6 when the reaction was conducted in the absence, and not presence, of sodium pyrophosphate. Treatment with more specific phosphatase inhibitors (i.e.microcystin and okadaic acid) also reduced brain phosphatase preparation-mediated inhibition (data not shown). These results suggest that the phosphorylation state of a protein(s) in the RIPE3b1 complex controls the DNA binding ability of this activator. The C1 element contributes to both tissue-specific and glucose-regulated expression of the insulin gene. Gel shift analysis revealed that two separate complexes, RIPE3b1 and RIPE3b2, bound to the C1 element. Notably, the RIPE3b1 complex was uniquely formed in β cell extracts and also regulated by glucose in parallel with insulin gene expression. These observations strongly suggest that RIPE3b1 is critical for C1-regulated transcription. In this paper, we have shown by SDS-PAGE fractionation and UV cross-linking analysis that the RIPE3b1 complex in β cells is composed of proteins of approximately 43 kDa. Protein phosphatase treatment was also shown to inhibit RIPE3b1 binding. These results imply that the phosphorylation state of a protein(s) within the RIPE3b1 complex is critical to DNA binding and, as a consequence, activation. The RIPE3b1 complex was found to contain DNA-binding proteins from 37.1 to 49.1 kDa (Fig. 4), presumably represented by the UV cross-linked proteins of roughly 38, 45, and 51 kDa specifically bound to the C1 element (Fig. 5). Because the DNA binding activity of RIPE3b1 was reduced by CIAP or brain phosphatase treatment, it is unclear whether modified forms of a single protein or several distinct proteins reflect the size difference of the C1-binding proteins. Protein phosphorylation has been shown to induce a change in molecular weight within this range in a number of different proteins; most notably, PDX-1 is shifted from 31 to 46 kDa by phosphorylation (38.Macfarlane W.M. McKinnon C.M. Felton-Edkins Z.A. Cragg H. James R.F.L. Docherty K. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 1011-1016Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). In contrast, UV cross-linking analysis performed on the ubiquitously distributed RIPE3b2 complex revealed a larger and broader molecular mass range of proteins (i.e. 58, 62, and 110 kDa) (30.Shieh S.-Y. Stellrecht C.M.M. Tsai M.-J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 21503-21508Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). The p110 subunit of RIPE3b2 is Smbp-2, a protein with potential helicase motifs and a transcription activation domain (30.Shieh S.-Y. Stellrecht C.M.M. Tsai M.-J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 21503-21508Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Importantly, the differences in molecular weight between the various protein:C1 element binding species indicates that RIPE3b1 and RIPE3b2 do not have common subunits. The sensitivity of RIPE3b1 to both CIAP and brain phosphatase treatment clearly indicates that it is similar to PDX-1, in that phosphorylation events within the β cell control the DNA binding potential of each protein. PDX-1 is rapidly phosphorylated in high glucose-treated cells (36.Macfarlane W.M. Read M.L. Gilligan M. Bujalska I. Docherty K. Biochem. J. 1994; 303: 625-631Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation appears to convert PDX-1 from an inactive, cytoplasmic 31-kDa form, which is found under low glucose conditions, to the active 46-kDa nuclear protein of high glucose-stimulated β cells (38.Macfarlane W.M.

Upon isolation of the gene(s) (cDNA) for RIPE3b1, it will be of interest to determine if activation is also dynamically regulated by changes in its phosphorylation status within the β cell.

In addition, heterozygous human mutant carriers of PDX-1 (53.Stoffer D.A. Ferrer J. Clarke W.L. Habener J.F. Nat.

These findings illustrate how the identification and characterization of transcriptional regulators of islet-enriched products, like insulin, are essential for our understanding of the disease process affecting the β cell. We are currently working toward isolating the gene(s) encoding RIPE3b1, which we believe will be essential in cell-specific and nutrient regulation of insulin mRNA production.

Anthony Weil for assistance in designing and interpreting many of the experiments described here and to Dr. Susan Samaras for generously providing AR42J and H4IIE nuclear extracts."

Indeed, homozygous inactivation of the p45 NF-E2 gene in the mouse (by homologous recombination) leads to a fatal hemorrhagic disease due to faulty megakaryocytic maturation and lack of platelets (4.Lecine P.

Recently, it was reported that two cDNA isoforms of p45 NF-E2 exist in human cells, resulting from transcription from two alternative promoters and differential splicing of the transcripts into the common second exon RNA. As the transcript from the distal promoter/first exon is more abundant in adult erythroid cells, and the transcript from the proximal promoter/first exon is predominant in fetal cells, they were termed “adult” and “fetal”, respectively (32.Pischedda C.

The distal promoter/first exon (1a) corresponds to the human adult promoter (32.Pischedda C. Cocco S. Melis A. Marini M.G. Kan Y.W. Cao A. Moi P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 6011-6017Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Secondary expression sites include intestine, lung, and placenta (7.Andrews N.C. Erdjument-Bromage H. Davidson M.B. Tempst P. Orkin S.H. Nature. 1993; 362: 722-728Crossref PubMed Scopus (565) Google Scholar, 24.Chan J.Y. Han X.-L. Kan Y.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 11366-11370Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). The restricted expression of p45 NF-E2 suggests a critical role of this protein in at least some hematopoietic lineages. Indeed, homozygous inactivation of the p45 NF-E2 gene in the mouse (by homologous recombination) leads to a fatal hemorrhagic disease due to faulty megakaryocytic maturation and lack of platelets (4.Lecine P. Blank V. Shivdasani R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 7572-7578Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). However, in the same mice, only minor erythroid cell defects were observed (26.Shivdasani R.A. Rosenblatt M.F. Zucker-Franklin D. Jackson C.W. Hunt P. Saris C.J. Orkin S.H.

A. 1995; 92: 8690-8694Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar), suggesting some functional complementation in the erythroid lineage by other related genes (possibly Nrf-1, but not Nrf-2) (28.Kuroha T. Takahashi S. Komeno T. Itoh J. Nagasawa T. Yamamoto M. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1998; 123: 376-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar,29.Martin F. van Deursen J.M. Shivdasani R.A. Jackson C.W. Troutman A.G. Ney P.A. Blood. 1998; 91: 3459-3466Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Evidence that p45 NF-E2 deficiency might affect at least a subset of erythroid cells is provided, however, by the lack of β-globin expression in a MEL cell line in which the endogenous p45 gene is inactive due to a retroviral integration; forced expression of p45-cDNA in these cells restores β-globin expression (30.Lu S.J.

Biol. 1995; 15: 4640-4647Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). So far, the transcriptional regulation of p45 NF-E2 expression has not been extensively investigated. Recently, it was reported that two cDNA isoforms of p45 NF-E2 exist in human cells, resulting from transcription from two alternative promoters and differential splicing of the transcripts into the common second exon RNA. As the transcript from the distal promoter/first exon is more abundant in adult erythroid cells, and the transcript from the proximal promoter/first exon is predominant in fetal cells, they were termed “adult” and “fetal”, respectively (32.Pischedda C. Cocco S. Melis A. Marini M.G. Kan Y.W. Cao A. Moi P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 3511-3515Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). In this work, we have investigated the presence in the mouse p45 NF-E2 gene of similar promoters and studied the regulation of their expression by RNA analysis during development and by transfection. The distal promoter/first exon (1a) corresponds to the human adult promoter (32.Pischedda C. Cocco S. Melis A. Marini M.G. Kan Y.W. Cao A. Moi P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 3511-3515Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar) and drives the expression of the previously described mouse mRNA (7.Andrews N.C. Erdjument-Bromage H. Davidson M.B. Tempst P. Orkin S.H. Nature. 1993; 362: 722-728Crossref PubMed Scopus (565) Google Scholar); the proximal mouse promoter/first exon (1b), lies in the first intron, and corresponds to the human fetal promoter (32.Pischedda C.

https://openalex.org/W1995053294,"Angiotensinogen, the renin (E.C. 3.4.23.15) substrate, belongs to the serpins superfamily and has been classified as a noninhibitory serpin. Using mass spectroscopy, angiotensinogen purified from Chinese hamster ovary cell supernatant shows a broad spectrum. The absence of protease inhibitors throughout the purification leads to an angiotensinogen cleaved within the reactive center loop. This cleavage does not affect the Ang I generation because kinetic parameters are similar to the values of the full-length angiotensinogen. Although cleavage is complete, the cleaved angiotensinogen migrates after deglycosylation on SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis as a doublet differing by 4 kDa. To test whether the circulating angiotensinogen is cleaved in the reactive center loop, it was purified from a pool of human plasma and was shown to be uncleaved. Its migration was obviously slower than of cleaved angiotensinogen but also consisted of two bands pointing to a so far unexplained residual heterogeneity. We then compared the heat-induced polymerization of full-length- and reactive center loop-cleaved angiotensinogens. Both monomers were able to aggregate, revealing a particular behavior of angiotensinogen distinct from that of reactive center loop-cleaved serpins. Lacking the three-dimensional structure of angiotensinogen, we propose and discuss a structural model of the serpin fold within the renin substrate.

Human AGT is a 452-amino acid residue protein delivered in the circulation, mainly from the liver. The other product of renin hydrolysis is des(Ang I)angiotensinogen, the remaining and larger part of the parent AGT. The renin-angiotensinogen reaction in human plasma is not a zero-order kinetic reaction (1.Gould A.B. Green D. Cardiovasc. Res. 1971; 5: 86-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar); the angiotensinogen concentration is therefore rate-limiting in the first step of the enzymatic cascade of the renin-angiotensin system. The AGT gene has been implicated in human hypertension (2.Corvol P. Jeunemaitre X. Endocr. Rev. 1997; 18: 662-677PubMed Google Scholar). A common molecular variant in which the methionine residue in position 235 is changed to a threonine residue (M235T) has been found to be associated with a 10–20% increase in the level of plasma AGT and with an increased prevalence of hypertension. The present study focuses on the relationship between AGT and serpins. Rat (3.Ohkubo H. Kageyama R. Ujihara M. Hirose T. Inayama S. Nakanishi S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1983; 80: 2196-2200Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar) and human (4.Kageyama R. Ohkubo H. Nakanishi S. Biochemistry. 1984; 23: 3603-3609Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar) AGT genes have been classified in the serpin superfamily (5.Doolitle R.F. Science. 1983; 222: 417-419Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar) because of some limited but significant homologies with sequences from representative members of this superfamily. These include α1-antitrypsin (AT) (23%), ovalbumin (21%), and antithrombin III (18%). In addition, rat (6.Tanaka T. Ohkubo H. Nakanishi S. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 8063-8065Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and human (7.Gaillard I. Clauser E. Corvol P. DNA (N. Y.). 1989; 8: 87-99Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar) AGT genes show a structural gene organization comprising 4 introns and 5 exons similar to that of the AT gene. The AGT gene could have arisen from the common ancestral serpin gene several million years ago via a duplication followed by a divergent evolution (8.Hill R.E. Hastie N.D. Nature. 1987; 326: 96-99Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar). The members of the serpin superfamily have a common tertiary structure based on a central β-sheet (sheet A) surrounded by two other β-sheets (sheet B and C) and a mobile reactive center loop (RCL) (9.Stein P.E. Carrell R.W. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1995; 2: 96-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (394) Google Scholar). This RCL acts as a bait for trapping the target protease, and only for inhibitory serpins, the cleavage induces a serpin structural rearrangement. The insertion of the RCL into β-sheet A leads to the formation of a covalent complex with the target proteinase, thereby rendering it inactivated (10.Stratikos E. Gettins P.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 453-458Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar, 11.Stratikos E. Gettins P.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 4808-4813Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar). Biochemical evidences using pure AGT have shown that renin substrate has kept a serpin-like structure, particularly in having an RCL that has been probed by limited proteolysis. Indeed, two endoproteases, human neutrophil elastase (12.Stein P.E. Tewksbury D.A. Carrell R.W. Biochem. J. 1989; 262: 103-107Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar) and Staphylococcus aureusendoprotease V8 (13.Mast A.E. Enghild J.J. Pizzo S.V. Salvesen G. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 1723-1730Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar), are able to cleave AGT in the RCL, leading to a proteolysis-resistant shortened protein and to C-terminal peptides, identified by N-terminal sequencing. Cleavage of AGT within the RCL by neutrophil elastase (Thr410-Gln411) or V8 protease (Glu408-Ser409) does not change its thermal stability contrary to inhibitory serpins (12.Stein P.E. Tewksbury D.A. Carrell R.W. Biochem. J. 1989; 262: 103-107Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar, 13.Mast A.E. Enghild J.J. Pizzo S.V. Salvesen G. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 1723-1730Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). Thus, AGT has been classified in the non-loop-insertable serpins subfamily (14.Patston P.A. Gettins P.G. FEBS Lett. 1996; 383: 87-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar), characterized by their canonical model, ovalbumin (15.Stein P.E. Leslie A.G. Finch J.T. Turnell W.G. McLaughlin P.J. Carrell R.W. Nature. 1990; 347: 99-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (348) Google Scholar). Moreover, the AGT target enzyme is still unknown. Because AGT purified from human plasma often displays a classical doublet around 60 kDa differing by 4 kDa (16.Tewksbury D.A. Frome W.L. Dumas M.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1978; 253: 3817-3820Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 17.Tewksbury D.A. Dart R.A. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 1979; 27: 47-56Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 18.Tewksbury D.A. Fed. Proc. 1983; 42: 2724-2728PubMed Google Scholar) and has only one N-terminal sequence, it has been proposed that a partial C-terminal cleavage (19.Tewksbury D.A. Laragh J.J. Brenner B.M. Hypertension, Pathophysiology, Diagnosis, and Management. 1. Raven Press, Ltd., New York1990: 1197-1216Google Scholar) could explain why these two bands persist even after extensive chemical or enzymatic deglycosylation (20.Campbell C.J. Charlton P.A. Grinham C.J. Mooney C.J. Pendlebury J.E. Biochem. J. 1987; 243: 121-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). We provide here evidence for an in vitro RCL cleavage of human AGT and analyze its biochemical characteristics. Finally, we propose a three-dimensional model of the serpin fold of the renin substrate. Human recombinant renin (21.Mathews S. Döbeli H. Pruschy M. Bosser R. D'Arcy A. Oefner C. Zulauf M. Gentz R. Breu V. Matile H. Schlaeger J. Fischli W. Protein Expression Purif. 1996; 7: 81-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar) was provided by Hoffmann-La Roche. Endoglycosidase H, neuraminidase, and O-glycosidase came from Roche Molecular Biochemicals; endoglycosidase F1 fused to the glutathioneS-transferase (22.Grueninger-Leitch F. D'Arcy A. D'Arcy B. Chene C. Protein Sci. 1996; 5: 2617-2622Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar), also provided by Hoffmann-La Roche, were used as a mixture of deglycosidases. Proteins were measured with the Bio-Rad protein assay using bovine serum albumin as standard (23.Genain C. Bouhnik J. Tewksbury D. Corvol P. Ménard J. J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. 1984; 59: 478-484Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). The Ang I polyclonal antibody (N-1345) used in this study has been previously described (24.Gimenez-Roqueplo A.P. Celerier J. Schmid G. Corvol P. Jeunemaitre X. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 34480-34487Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). One C-terminal antibody (C-1350) was specifically raised against the last six residues of the mature AGT using a synthetic peptide (hAGT Tyr-447–452, NH2-Tyr-Asn447-Pro-Leu-Ser-Thr-Ala452-COOH) in which a tyrosine residue was added for labeling. The peptide was covalently coupled to keyhole limpet hemocyanin as carrier protein and injected into rabbits. The antibody against this peptide were characterized by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (specific titer: 1/2000) (ANAWA Trading SA, Biomedicals Services and Products-Zurich). The specificity of the reaction against whole AGT was checked by negative controls with preimmune serum from the same rabbit and competition with peptide concentrations in the range 10 nm–1 μm. The CHO cell line overexpressing wild type human AGT (Met235) has been previously characterized (25.Wei L. Gaillard I. Corvol P. Clauser E. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1988; 156: 1103-1110Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar, 26.Gimenez-Roqueplo A.-P. Leconte I. Cohen P. Simon D. Guyene T.T. Celerier J. Pau B. Corvol P. Clauser E. Jeunemaitre X. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 9838-9844Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). For scale-up cultures, cells were primarily expanded as a layer of adherent cells in medium containing 2% (v/v) fetal calf serum and 500 μg/ml Geneticin. Production of recombinant AGT was performed in cell factories (Nunc, Roskilde Denmark) in a serum-free medium called DHI-TIPP, which is a mixture of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's, Ham's F-12, and Iscove's modified Dulbecco's media in respective proportions (1/1/2 (v/v) containing 5 mml-glutamine and 25 mm glucose. It was supplemented with insulin (5 μg/ml), selenite (20 nm), ethanolamine (20 μm), human transferrin (6 μg/ml), Primatone RL ultrafiltered (2.5 mg/ml), and Pluronic F68 (0.1 mg/ml). On day 0 the supernatant was discarded, cells were washed twice with 1 liter of DHI-TIPP medium containing no fetal calf serum, and AGT production was then performed in this serum-free medium. Supernatants were harvested 3 or 4 days later, and protease inhibitors were immediately added: 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.5 μm aprotinin, and 9.3 mm benzamidine. Supernatants were centrifuged (20 min, 3000 rpm at 4 °C), concentrated using a 10-kDa cut-off membrane, and then frozen at −80 °C. All the chromatographic steps were performed at 18 °C. Binding of AGT (1–2 ml/min) on to low substitution (20 μmol phenyl/ml gel) phenyl-Sepharose (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) requires the equilibration of the medium with 1.17m ammonium sulfate in 28.5 mm sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.4). Elution of bound AGT was performed by decreasing salt concentration using a discontinuous step gradient with MilliQ water (4 ml/min). The pooled fractions were diluted twice with 300 mm sodium acetate buffer (pH 6.0) to equilibrate the sample. Adsorption of AGT on to concanavalin A (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) was made in the presence of 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm CaCl2, and 1 mmMnCl2 (0.2–0.4 ml/min). Nonbound proteins were washed out by 30 mm sodium acetate (pH 6.0), 1 mmCaCl2, 1 mm MnCl2 buffer. Bound proteins were eluted (0.2 ml/min) by using 200 mm methyl α-d-mannopyranoside in the same buffer. Finally, adsorption of AGT onto Mono Q HR5/5 column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) (1 ml) was achieved in 100 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0). Equilibration of the concanavalin A pool was made by adding 1.5m Tris-HCl (pH 8.8) (2.5 μl/ml). After washing the column (Tris-HCl 100 mm (pH 8.0)), bound proteins were eluted by increasing salt concentration using a linear gradient (60 ml) from 0 to 0.5 m NaCl in Tris-HCl 20 mm (pH 8.0) buffer (1 ml/min). Finally, elution of AGT was achieved in conditions corresponding to 120–180 mm NaCl. The stock solution was kept at 4 °C in the presence of 10% (v/v) glycerol. The presence of protease inhibitors (1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 5 mm EDTA, 10 mmbenzamidine, 1 μm leupeptin, 1 μmpepstatin, and 1 μm aprotinin) throughout the purification allowed us to obtain the uncleaved AGT. Omitting them gave, reproducibly, one form of AGT cleaved in the RCL. Purified circulating AGT was made from a pool of human plasma in the same conditions except that blue Sepharose (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) chromatography was added as a first step using 50 mmTris-HCl (pH 8.0) buffer, and Superose 12 chromatography was added as the last step using 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) containing 150 mm NaCl. Pure AGT (10–50 μg) was submitted to a Superose 12 column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) in 100 mm ammonium acetate buffer (pH 6.0). The most concentrated fraction, corresponding to 60 kDa, was lyophilized and resuspended in a 0.1% (v/v) trifluoroacetic acid or 5% (v/v) formic acid just before spotting onto a sinapinic acid matrix (Sigma) for analysis by mass spectroscopy. Spectra were recorded on a Voyager Elite mass spectrometer (Perseptive Biosystems, Framingham, MA) equipped with delayed extraction. Data were acquired at a sampling rate of 2 GHz. Accelerating voltage was 25 kV, grid voltage was 90%, and guide wire was 0.3%. The apparatus was calibrated in linear mode (i) for the determination of the mass of glycosylated AGT using single (m/z = 66431)- and double (m/z = 33216)-charged ions of bovine serum albumin and (ii) for the determination of the mass of AGT C-terminal peptides using Ang I peptide (m/z = 1297.5) and insulin (m/z = 5734.5) as external markers. Samples were diluted twice with a 200 mm Tris-HCl buffer (pH 6.8) containing 2% (w/v) SDS and 40% (v/v) glycerol. Precast 10–20% gradient Tris-Tricine gels (Bio-Rad) were run in a Tris-Tricine buffer (pH 8.3) containing 0.1% (w/v) SDS for 2 h at 100 V according to Schagger and Von Jagow (27.Schagger H. Von Jagow G. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 166: 368-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (10505) Google Scholar). Proteins and peptides were stained with the 0.05% (w/v) G-250 Coomassie Blue in 10% (v/v) acetic acid solution for 2 h with gentle rocking at room temperature. Extensive cleavage by recombinant human renin (1.25 nm) was allowed for 1 h at 37 °C in a 100 mm sodium citrate buffer (pH 5.7) containing 3 mm EDTA. The velocity parameters were determined at pH 5.7 in the same buffer in the presence of 20 pm recombinant human renin, assumed to be fully active. The reaction was stopped as previously reported (24.Gimenez-Roqueplo A.P. Celerier J. Schmid G. Corvol P. Jeunemaitre X. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 34480-34487Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). The generated Ang I was measured in triplicate in a specific radioimmunoassay (28.Ménard J. Catt K.J. Endocrinology. 1972; 90: 422-430Crossref PubMed Scopus (435) Google Scholar). The thermal stability of the pure AGT was assayed by diluting the stock solution twice in a 100 mm sodium acetate (pH 5.5) buffer or a 100 mmTris-HCl (pH 8.0) buffer immediately before incubation for 1 h at the indicated temperature. An aliquot was removed to test the ability of AGT to be cleaved by renin (at pH 5.7 for 1 h), and the remaining 2 μg were immediately unfolded in denaturing buffer, loaded on to a nonreduced SDS-polyacrylamide electrophoresis gel, and revealed by Coomassie Blue staining. Starting from CHO cell supernatants in which AGT represents 20–40% of the total protein, the renin substrate was purified 2.5-fold with a yield of around 20% using a nondenaturing procedure. MALDI-TOF mass spectroscopy analysis was performed on each preparation. The spectrum of this glycosylated AGT is broad, expanding fromm/z = 55000 to more than 60,000 with a meanm/z around 57,000–58,000 (Fig.1 A). No contaminating proteins were present in the mass range of 20–80 kDa. In three preparations performed without any protease inhibitor, most of the AGT had a mass of around 52–53 kDa (data not shown), and most importantly, distinct peptides were detected in the range 3500–6000. Four peptides were detected in a sample originating from a representative purification (Fig. 1 B). The observed mass of the largest major peptide (m/z = 4543.1) was fitted with the calculated mass (M r = 4542.2) of the C-terminal sequence beginning at the Gln412 and ending at Ala452, the last residue of mature AGT. The smaller peptide (m/z = 4415.3) could have resulted from the major product through removal of a glutamine residue (−128.1) Then the sequential removal of the consecutive Leu413(−113.2) and Asp414 (−114.1) would explain the presence of the two minor peptides (m/z = 4308.3) and (m/z = 4191.2), respectively. These mass determinations were verified by MALDI-TOF in the reflectron mode and by nanospray mass spectroscopy (data not shown). These observations were highly suggestive of the presence of an RCL cleavage in the renin substrate. The presence of 4-kDa C-terminal peptides was detected as a faint band after SDS denaturation by using a Tris-Tricine gel, which allows the separation of small peptides in the range 1–20 kDa (27.Schagger H. Von Jagow G. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 166: 368-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (10505) Google Scholar). Reducing and/or heat treatment did not release higher amounts. After transfer onto a polyvinylidenefluoride membrane, the 60-kDa band and the 4-kDa peptide were N terminus-sequenced (Fig.2 B). The 60-kDa band revealed only one sequence corresponding to the mature AGT. For the 4-kDa peptide, three N-terminal sequences were detected; the most abundant began at Gln412, the second at Leu413, and the third at Asn414 (Fig. 2 B). Thus the initial site of cleavage was between Gln411 and Gln412, in accordance with the previous results obtained by MALDI-TOF mass spectroscopy (Fig. 1 B). Native AGT studied in this experiment has a specific activity of 26 μg of Ang I/mg of protein, whereas the RCL-cleaved AGT has a specific activity of 26.7 μg of Ang I/mg of protein; both values are close to the theoretical Ang I content of AGT, which is 25 μg of Ang I/mg of protein. In addition, initial velocity parameters for renin hydrolysis, determined using the full-length and the RCL-cleaved AGT, showed no significant difference (Table I). This shows that Ang I generation, located in the N terminus, is not affected by the cleavage in its RCL at the opposite end of the molecule.Table IInitial velocity parameters during renin hydrolysis at pH 5.7 of the recombinant native and RCL-cleaved human AGTRecombinant angiotensinogenNativeRCL-cleavedK m(μm)0.760.8V m (fmol of Ang I/s)1.81.6k cat(sec−1)0.90.8k cat/K m(s−1 · μm−1)1.21.0Data come from one experiment.

K m andV m are determined using Lineweaver-Burk representation, and K cat values are obtained by dividing V m with renin amounts (2 fmol). To detect AGT devoid of its 4-kDa C-terminal peptide following cleavage in the RCL, an AGT peptide antibody against the C-terminal end (C-1350) was produced. This antibody together with a N-terminal Ang I antibody (N-1345) (24.Gimenez-Roqueplo A.P. Celerier J. Schmid G. Corvol P. Jeunemaitre X. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 34480-34487Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar) allowed the detection of the full-length AGT but not the RCL-cleaved AGT (Fig.3 A). For an unknown reason, the C-terminal antibody (C-1350) did not recognize the isolated 4-kDa peptide generated following cleavage in the RCL of AGT (data not shown). As expected, both native AGT and the RCL-cleaved AGT were equally responsive to the Ang I antibody, with a slight difference (around 5 kDa) in their respective apparent molecular masses due to the loss of C-terminal peptides. After extensive enzymatic deglycosylation, which increased the migration of both AGTs (Fig. 3 B), well defined bands were observed. For the full-length AGT, bands at 54 and 50 kDa were both responsive to N-1345 as well as C-1350, and for AGT cleaved within the RCL, bands at 48 kDa and 44 kDa were responsive only to N-1345. Our data reveal that human recombinant AGT migrates on SDS-polyacylamide electrophoresis gels as a doublet, differing by 4 kDa even if it is more than 95% C terminus-cleaved. Furthermore, we used this C terminus antibody to detect the step at which the RCL cleavage occurred during purification. CHO-produced AGT was intact in the serum-free medium because it was N and C termini, and the C-terminal response of AGT was lost during the third step of our purification (data not shown), suggesting the co-purification of the protease and AGT. To test whether a RCL-cleaved AGT may exist in vivo, human plasma AGT was purified and characterized. Plasma AGT was purified 200 times with a yield about 12% (Fig.4 A). It was analyzed using a Tris-Tricine gel (Fig. 4 B) and the pair of end-terminal AGT polyclonal antibodies (N1345 (Fig. 4 C) and C1350 (Fig.4 D)). In our conditions of purification, no RCL cleavage of circulating AGT was observed because (i) no 4-kDa peptide was detected (Fig. 4 B) and (ii) both 60-kDa bands were recognized by the N terminus as well as the C-terminal antibody before (Fig.4 C) and after deglycosylation (Fig. 4 D). Although this circulating AGT was not cleaved in the C terminus, a doublet (54–50 kDa) was still consistently observed, even after N- and O-deglycosylation and after removal of sialic acids residues. This pattern of migration was consistent with that of the recombinant native AGT (Fig. 3). Heating native (i.e. full-length) serpins generally leads to the formation of loop-sheet polymers that migrate as a ladder on nondenaturing gels (29.Lomas D.A. Elliott P.R. Chang W.S. Wardell M.R. Carrell R.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 5282-5288Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). We tested this property by heating the recombinant AGTs at 65 °C (Fig.5). Unexpectedly, the RCL-cleaved AGT had kept its ability to polymerize, suggesting a mechanism of polymerization different from the much-studied loop-sheet interactions for the RCL-cleaved serpins (29.Lomas D.A. Elliott P.R. Chang W.S. Wardell M.R. Carrell R.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 5282-5288Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). Monomers of AGT disappeared after 15 min of incubation; a longer incubation time had no further effect (data not shown). The heat-induced polymerization of both AGTs was studied and compared after 1 h of incubation in 2 different conditions: acidic (pH 5.5 in acetate buffer) and basic (pH 8.0 in Tris-HCl buffer). Each was measured at various temperatures ranging from 4 °C to 100 °C (Fig. 6). The acidic condition corresponded to that previously used to obtain the latent form with partial insertion of the loop of the native plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (30.Declerck P.J. De Mol M. Vaughan D.E. Collen D. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 11693-11696Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The formation of aggregates was followed by their ability to generate Ang I after extensive renin hydrolysis (Fig.6 A) and by Coomassie Blue staining after migration on an SDS-polyacylamide electrophoresis gels (Fig. 6 B). When the heat stability of both AGTs was tested in the acidic condition, it was increased by 12 °C, as indicated by the shift to the left of the corresponding transition curves. At pH 8.0, although the two curves cannot be completely superimposed, they showed a nonsignificant difference in T m value. In fact,T m was around 56 °C when native and RCL-cleaved AGTs were incubated at pH 8.0 and 68 °C when both proteins were incubated in acetate buffer. At both pH values, the activity was totally abolished after 1 h at 75 °C (Fig. 6 A). The dramatic loss of the renin substrate activity was accompanied by the formation of SDS-resistant aggregates for the native as well as the RCL-cleaved AGT (Fig. 6 B). The formation of aggregates started around 70 °C when the pH was acidic and at 60 °C with a basic pH. Lowering the pH significantly increased the stability of the monomeric AGT (M). The mechanism of AGT polymerization was characterized by the transient formation of dimers (D) leading to the final formation of large aggregates (Ag) that were so big that they did not enter in the running gel. After 1 h at 100 °C, no monomers were stained; thus, all the AGT had been changed into higher molecular weight aggregates. The presence of free cysteines in the AGT sequence could explain this particular behavior of a serpin when heated. In fact, the aggregates were dissociated when a reducing agent was added before loading (data not shown). We have presented evidence for a new cleavage site in human AGT. Such a cleavage does not affect the generation of Ang I by renin and does not change the tendency of AGT to aggregate. Cleavage of recombinant AGT was observed between Gln411 and Gln412 during a nondenaturing purification, generating a major 4-kDa peptide that was N terminus-degraded, presumably by an aminopeptidase. The residue 415, a proline, stops its action. No other AGT peptides were detected from the purified recombinant AGT by mass spectroscopy or in Tris-Tricine gel, showing that the full-length protein can be specifically proteolysed in its RCL. In addition, we have shown that the generated C-terminal 4-kDa peptides remain associated with the rest of the protein unless AGT has been unfolded by SDS. This site of proteolysis, between two consecutive glutamine residues, is very unusual. Our data allow the assignment of a new P1-P1′ cleavage site in the RCL of human AGT and prompt a reexamination of the comparison of the reactive center sequences of others serpins (Fig. 7 A). According to this alignment, the doublet of glutamine residues Gln411-Gln412 is conserved in marmoset, rat, and mouse but not in sheep. Thus, it may constitute a physiological P1-P1′ site, the target of an unknown protease. For inhibitory serpins, the P1 residue plays an important role in determining the target specificity of the protease involved (31.Zou Z. Anisowicz A. Hendrix M.J.C. Thor A. Neveu M. Sheng S. Rafidi K. Seftor E. Sager R. Science. 1994; 263: 526-529Crossref PubMed Scopus (830) Google Scholar). In this regard, it should be noted that the P1 residue in human AGT is a glutamine, although it is very unlikely that it can form an acyl-enzyme with the target protease. Nevertheless, our alignment also showed the conservation of a proline residue in P6 position, except in sheep, and the strict conservation of residues present at position P3, P5′, and P6′. They may have a role in the presentation of the P1-P1′ peptide bond for cleavage. Most importantly, human AGT has a large charged residue, a glutamate, in P14 in accordance with its inability to insert the reactive center loop (12.Stein P.E. Tewksbury D.A. Carrell R.W. Biochem. J. 1989; 262: 103-107Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar, 13.Mast A.E. Enghild J.J. Pizzo S.V. Salvesen G. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 1723-1730Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). Indeed, the presence of an arginine charged residue in P14 in ovalbumin has been proposed to explain the absence of loop insertion (32.Lawrence D.A. Olson S.T. Palaniappan S. Ginsburg D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 27657-27662Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A number of other alignments of this C terminus part of human AGT have been previously described (14.Patston P.A.

First, two atp1 mutations (atp1–1 and atp1–2) were characterized that prevent the growth of yeast on non-fermentable carbon sources. Both mutants contained full-length F1α-subunit proteins in mitochondria, but in lower amounts than that in the parental strain. Both mutants exhibited barely measurable F1-ATPase activity. The primary mutations in atp1–1 andatp1–2 were identified as Thr383 → Ile and Gly291 → Asp, respectively. From recent structural data, position 383 lies within the catalytic site. Position 291 is located near the region affecting subunit-subunit interaction with the F1β-subunit. An unlinked suppressor gene,ASC1 (α-subunitcomplementing) of the atp1–2 mutation (Gly291 → Asp) restored the growth defect phenotype on glycerol, but did not suppress either atp1–1 or the deletion mutant Δatp1. Sequence analysis revealed thatASC1 was allelic with RAS2, a G-protein growth regulator. The introduction of ASC1/RAS2 into theatp1–2 mutant increased the F1-ATPase enzyme activity in this mutant when the transformant was grown on glycerol.

Devenish R.J. Gibson F. Howitt S.M. Nagley P. Ernster L. Molecular Mechanisms in Bioenergetics. Elsevier, Amsterdam1992: 283-315Google Scholar). The enzyme is controlled in response to the energy demands of the cell (2.Boyer P.D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1140: 215-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (917) Google Scholar). Although considerable attention has been given to the central role of mitochondrial ATP production in the initiation of programmed cell death (apoptosis), little is known about the regulation of ATP synthase during its biogenesis and energy transduction or its links to growth regulatory pathways (3.Green D.R. Reed J.C. Science. 1998; 281: 1309-1312Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The enzyme complex is composed of the F1-ATPase (catalytic sector) and the transmembrane F0 proton channel (embedded in inner membrane) (4.Futai M. Noumi T. Maeda M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1989; 58: 111-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (403) Google Scholar, 5.Gresser M.J. Myers J.A. Boyer P.D. J. Biol.

Both F1 and F0 are necessary for ATP synthase activity, whereas F1 alone retains the ability to hydrolyze ATP (F1-ATPase) (7.Yasuda R. Noji H. Kinosita Jr., K. Yoshida M. Cell. 1998; 93: 1117-1124Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (709) Google Scholar). The F1-ATPase consists of five different subunits: α, β, γ, δ, and ε. The minimum unit for F1-ATPase activity resides on α-β-subunit dimer (8.Harada M. Ohta S. Sato M. Ito Y. Kobayashi Y. Sone N. Ohta T. Kagawa Y. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1991; 1056: 279-284Crossref Scopus (30) Google Scholar). The catalytic center is considered to be in the β-subunit (9.Douglas M.G. Koh Y. Dockter M.E. Schatz G. J. Biol. Chem. 1977; 252: 8333-8335Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar,10.Duncan T.M. Senior A.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 4901-4907Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and the α-subunit has been reported to play a role in the formation of the catalytic site with it (11.Wise J.G. Latchney L.R. Senior A.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 10383-10389Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The α-subunit also assists the assembly of other subunits of the F1-ATPase (12.Yuan H. Douglas M.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 14697-14702Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) by acting as a chaperone to assist assembly (13.Luis A.M. Alcomada A. Cuezva J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 7713-7716Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In yeast, all but three F0 subunits of the enzyme are encoded on nuclear DNA. In order to examine the control mechanism(s) of the F1α-subunit in the complex assembly and function, we characterized several mutants (14.Tzagoloff A. Akai A. Needleman R.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1975; 250: 8228-8235Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and isolated extragenic suppressors of mutations in the ATP1 gene. One extragenic suppressor for the point mutant, atp1–2, was RAS2, a well known regulator of cell proliferation and signal transduction (15.Gibbs J.B. Marshall M.S. Microbiol. Rev. 1989; 53: 171-185Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 16.Broach J.R. Deschenes R.J. Adv. Cancer Res. 1990; 54: 79-139Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar, 17.Thevelein J.M. A. v. Leeuwenhoek. 1992; 62: 109-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). This work reveals for the first time that the cellular growth regulatory activity of RAS2 is linked in some manner with the biogenesis or function of mitochondrial enzyme complexes. Saccharomyces cerevisiae DC5 (MATa leu2–3 leu2–112 his3 can1–11) (18.Takeda M. Chen W.-J. Saltzgaber J. Douglas M.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 15126-15133Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) was used as a wild-type strain. Nuclear petite mutants XJY11 (MATa leu2–3 leu2–112 his3 atp1–2 can1–11) and XJY12 (MATα leu2–3 leu2–112 atp1–1 can1–11) have been reported previously (18.Takeda M. Chen W.-J. Saltzgaber J. Douglas M.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 15126-15133Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The mutant allele, atp1–2(12.Yuan H. Douglas M.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 14697-14702Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), is the same as the N9–84 mutation reported previously (14.Tzagoloff A. Akai A. Needleman R.B. J. Biol.

SKY4010 (MATa leu2–3 leu2–112 his3Δatp1::HIS3 can1–11) was constructed by disruption of the ATP1 gene in DC5 with a 4.2-kb1 EcoRI-SphI fragment containingatp1::HIS3 allele. MC1066 (F−Δ(lacIPOZY) X74 galU galK rpsL hsdR trpC9830 leuB600 pyrF74::Tn5) was used for the preparation of plasmids for yeast genetics. One Shot INVαF' (Invitrogen, San Diego, CA) and XL1-BLUE MRF' KAN (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) were used for the sequencing. E. coli-carrying plasmids were grown in LB (0.5% yeast extract, 1% bactotryptone, 1% NaCl) plus 50 or 125 μg of ampicillin/ml. Yeast strains were grown on YPG (1% yeast extract, 2% bactopeptone, 3% glycerol), YPGE (1% yeast extract, 2% bactopeptone, 3% glycerol, 3% ethanol), YPDM (0.5% yeast extract, 0.5% bactopeptone, 0.1% (NH4)2SO4, 0.2% KH2PO4, 0.1% MgSO4, 0.8% glucose), or SD (0.67% yeast nitrogen base without amino acids, 2% glucose, and appropriate nutrients). Solid medium contained 2% agar. The Sau3AI pool of yeast genomic DNA from DC5 was cloned into the BamHI site of a vector YEp13 for the construction of yeast genomic library (19.O'Mally K. Pratt P. Robertson J. Lilly M. Douglas M.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 2097-2103Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A plasmid pYCL12–5 (YCp type) was constructed as follows; approximately 2.9 kb of EcoRI-SphI fragment having ATP1 with its 5′- and 3′-flanking regions was cloned into a derivative of YCp50 in which the URA3 was disrupted by LEU2. pJ12–5 consists of the episomal plasmid YEp13 containing ATP1 as described previously (18.Takeda M. Chen W.-J. Saltzgaber J. Douglas M.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 15126-15133Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Plasmids pOSBH20 (centromere type) and pMTYBH20 (episomal type) were constructed as follows; a 1.6-kb XbaI-NdeI fragment carryingASC1 with its 5′- and 3′-flanking regions was cloned into pOS31 (YCp type vector, LEU2, CEN3,ARS1, TRP1, bla) or into YEp13, respectively. The plasmid pYEatp1–2 (YEp type) was constructed as follows; a SacI-HindIII fragment ofATP1 region of pJD12–5 was replaced with the same fragment from the atp1–2 mutant. PCR was performed according to the procedure for Gene Amp DNA amplification reagent kit (Perkin-Elmer). The PCR primer pairs used are: 1 (5′-CGCAAGAACAGTAACAAAAT-3′) and 2 (5′-ATCACCAATAATCAACTCTC-3′), 3 (5′-CGGTAGAGGTCAAAGAGAGT-3′) and 4 (5′-TCAATAACAGGCAAAGCAGT-3′), and 5 (5′-TGGTGATGTCTTTTACTTGC-3′ and 6 (5′-GATTTTCAGGTTATTGTTTG-3′). The primers 1 and 6 are located just outside ATP1 coding region. DNA was amplified in a PCR processor (Perkin-Elmer type 480) by using 30 cycles. Yeast whole DNA as templates were prepared by the previously reported method (20.Cryer D.R. Eccleshall R. Marmur J. Methods Cell Biol. 1975; 12: 39-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar). PCR products were cloned into a vector pCRII (Invitrogen, San Diego, CA) or pCR-Script (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) for sequencing. Nucleotide sequencing was performed by dideoxy chain termination method (21.Sanger F. Nicklen S. Coulson A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 5463-5467Crossref PubMed Scopus (52511) Google Scholar), and autoradiograms were obtained according to the method previously reported (22.Mabuchi T. Anal. Biochem. 1993; 215: 158-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar). In the process of sequencing, we found misreading in the ATP1 sequence previously reported (18.Takeda M. Chen W.-J. Saltzgaber J. Douglas M.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 15126-15133Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We re-sequenced the wild-type ATP1by using a genomic clone and used corrected sequence for comparison. The nucleotide sequences described in this article are available from the DDBJ/EBI/GenBank™ nucleotide sequence data bases under accession numbers D37948 (ATP1), D37949 (atp1–2), D88458(atp1–1), and D37950 (ASC1/RAS2). Homology searches were calculated by BLAST (basic local alignment search tool) (23.Altschul S.F. Gish W. Miller W. Myers E.W. Lipman D.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 215: 403-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (69731) Google Scholar) against all data compiled in the NCBI data base (supplied October 10, 1997 by NCBI). Growth on a non-fermentable carbon source, glycerol, was examined by incubation on YPGE medium at 30 °C for 3–4 days. Cells were grown in 50 ml of YPDM medium. After 24 h of incubation at 30 °C, cells (∼2–4 × 107 cells/ml) were harvested and mitochondria were prepared according to the method reported previously (24.Daum G. Böhni P.C. Schatz G. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 13028-13033Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). F1-ATPase activity was measured by minor modification of the method of Pullman et al. (25.Pullman M.E. Penefsky H.S. Datta A. Racker E. J. Biol. Chem. 1960; 235: 3322-3329Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) by following the decrease of the absorbency at 340 nm. The assay mixture consisted of 50 μmol of Tris acetate (pH 7.4), 1 μmol of MgCl2, 0.02 μmol of NADH, 2 μmol of phosphoenolpyruvate, 2 μmol of ATP, 13 μg of lactate dehydrogenase, and 16 μg of pyruvate kinase in 1 ml. Immunodetection of protein was carried out essentially according to the published procedure (26.Emr S.D. Vassarotti A. Garrett J. Geller B.L. Takeda M. Douglas M.G. J. Cell Biol. 1986; 102: 523-533Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). Isolated mitochondria (0.3 μg of protein) were suspended in solubilization buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, 1 mm EDTA, pH 8, 1% SDS, 10% sucrose, 1% β-mercaptoethanol), heated at 100 °C for 5 min, and then subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (10% polyacrylamide gel, Tefco Corp., Tokyo, Japan). After electrophoretic transfer of gel-resolved F1α-subunit, bound anti-F1α-subunit antibody on the polyvinylidene difluoride membranes were assayed mainly by using a Western-Light rabbit kit (Tropix, Inc., Bedford, MA). Yeast strains carrying atp1–2 (XJY11) and atp1–1(XJY12) mutations fail to grow on the non-fermentable carbon source (Fig. 1) and lack ATPase activity (TableI) (14.Tzagoloff A. Akai A. Needleman R.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1975; 250: 8228-8235Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 18.Takeda M. Chen W.-J. Saltzgaber J. Douglas M.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 15126-15133Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Both strains, however, were able to synthesize their full length α-subunits, although in reduced amounts (Fig. 2). The amount of mutant α-subunit was approximately 47% of the parental wild type strain DC5 (Table I) in atp1–2 and 52% in atp1–1 (14.Tzagoloff A. Akai A. Needleman R.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1975; 250: 8228-8235Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar,18.Takeda M. Chen W.-J. Saltzgaber J. Douglas M.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 15126-15133Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The F1-ATPase activity in the atp1–2mutant was barely measurable above that of ATP1 deletion, SKY4010. Thus, the atp1–2 mutation essentially led to complete loss of ATPase activity (Table I). The enzyme activity of Δatp1 strain, SKY4010, could be restored to 54% of wild-type enzyme activity by introduction of ATP1 on pYCL12–5. The recovery of enzyme activities in strainsatp1–2 and atp1–1 transformed with the same plasmid was 43% and 37%, respectively (Table I). The lower ATPase specific activity of the point mutants transformed with the centromeric plasmid pYCL12–5 suggests that the mutant α-subunit protein probably competes with the plasmid-encoded wild type subunits for assembly into the functional enzyme complex.Table IF1-ATPase activity and quantitation of α subunit in mitochondria of transformants with ATP1 or ASC1 on glucoseStrainAlleleIntroduced gene (plasmidaEach gene was introduced into each strain using centromeric plasmids.)F1-ATPase activityQuantitation of α subunitGrowth on glycerolμmol/min/mg mt proteinDC5ATP11.69 ± 0.361.00+XJY11atp1–20.07 ± 0.000.47−XJY11atp1–2ATP1(pYCL12–5)0.72 ± 0.050.67+XJY11atp1–2ASC1 (pOSBH20)0.08 ± 0.021.10+XJY12atp1–10.40 ± 0.000.52−XJY12atp1–1ATP1(pYCL12–5)0.62 ± 0.020.84+XJY12atp1–1ASC1 (pOSBH20)0.13 ± 0.020.93−SKY4010Δatp10.07 ± 0.000−SKY4010Δatp1ATP1(pYCL12–5)0.92 ± 0.071.00+SKY4010Δatp1ASC1(pOSBH20)0.07 ± 0.000−a Each gene was introduced into each strain using centromeric plasmids.

Sequence analysis ofatp1–1 also revealed a cytosine to thymine at the second position in codon 383 (Table II) generated an amino acid substitution from Thr383 to Ile. The residue at Thr383 is also a strictly conserved amino acid residue among all of the ATP synthase α-subunit genes reported so far. Therefore, these data indicate that both Gly291 and Thr383 of the F1α-subunit are each essential for function of the ATP synthase.Table IINucleotide and amino acid changes in atp1 mutantsStrainAlleleNucleotide changesCodon changesAmino acid changeXJY11atp1–2402C → TGTC → GTTNone576C → TGCC → GCTNone872G → AGGT → GATG291DXJY12atp1–1402C → TGTC → GTTNone576C → TGCC → GCTNone1148G → TACC → ATCT383IThe nucleotide positions of ATP1 gene were counted from the first nucleotide of start codon.

Open table in a new tab The nucleotide positions of ATP1 gene were counted from the first nucleotide of start codon. Suppressor genes toatp1–2 (Gly291 → Asp) that restored growth of the mutants on a non-fermentable carbon source were selected as described (see “Experimental Procedures”). From 10,000 Leu+ transformants, five were able to grow on glycerol and were further characterized. Two of the five plasmids exhibited restriction maps different to that of ATP1 but shared a common region. We denoted the gene contained in these fragments asASC (for α-subunitcomplementing gene). The ASC1 suppressor ofatp1–2 did not restore the growth defect on glycerol ofatp1–1 (Fig. 1). Thus, these results support that mutations in atp1–2 and atp1–1 may affect different functions or cellular activities of the F1-ATPase α-subunit. ASC1 failed to restore the growth on glycerol of other ATPase subunit mutants including the ATP1 deletion mutant SKY4010 (data not shown). When the ASC1 gene was placed on a centromeric plasmic, the atp1–2 transformant grew on glycerol but at one third the rate of the wild type (180 min doubling, Fig. 3). Thus, low copy gene dosage of ASC1 suppressed the atp1–2 mutation. When the atp1–1 (Thr383 → Ile) was transformed with the same genomic library, only ATP1 genes and no other were isolated on different plasmids using this selection. To identify ASC1, the common region of the plasmid, inserts were sequenced (Fig.4). This indicated that ASC1was identical to a previously sequenced gene RAS2. This gene is a homologue to human oncogene involved in signal transduction (30.DeFeo-Jones D. Scolnick E.M. Koller R. Dhar R. Nature. 1983; 306: 707-709Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar,31.Powers S. Kataoka T. Fasano O. Goldfarb M. Strathern J. Broach J. Wigler M. Cell. 1984; 36: 607-612Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar). Further, Southern hybridization of chromosomes separated by contour-clamped homogenous electric field gel electrophoresis confirmed that digoxigenin-labeled ASC1 hybridized with chromosome XIV on which RAS2 is localized (data not shown) (32.Mortimer R.K. Contopoulou C.R. King J.S. Yeast. 1992; 8: 817-902Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). Primary clone analysis also showed that ASC1 hybridized with ATCC clone 70762 alone, which contains RAS2 (data not shown). Finally, the yeast RAS2 gene obtained from another source suppressed atp1–2 in the same manner as ASC1(data not shown). The presence of the plasmid encodedASC1/RAS2 in the atp1–2 mutant caused no change in mitochondrial ATPase activity as long as the cells were grown on glucose (Table I). On glucose in this medium, there is no selective pressure for the mutant to retain the plasmid encodedASC1/RAS2. However, when the transformant was grown on the non-fermentable substrate like glycerol, the F1-ATPase activities increased in atp1–2 almost 6-fold. The level of enzymatic activity in atp1–2 transformed withASC1 reached 30% that of the parental strain grown under the same conditions (Table IV). These results suggest that ASC1/RAS2 functions as part of the regulatory circuit linked to the control of F1-ATPase subunit synthesis on a non-fermentable carbon source.Table IVF1-ATPase activity and quantitation of α subunit in mitochondria of transformants with ASC1 or atp1–2StrainAlleleMediumIntroduced gene (plasmid)F1-ATPase activityQuantitation of α subunitμmol/min/mg mt proteinDC5ATP1YPG1.29 ± 0.241.00XJY11atp1–2YPGASC1(pOSBH20aA centromeric plasmid.)0.39 ± 0.140.60XJY11atp1–2YPGatp1–2(pYEatp1–2bA multi-copy plasmid.)0.36 ± 0.081.12DC5ATP1YPDM1.69 ± 0.361.00XJY11atp1–2YPDM0.07 ± 0.000.47a A centromeric plasmid.b A multi-copy plasmid. Open table in a new tab The amount of F1-ATPase α-subunit protein was measured under different growth conditions to determine if increases in activity reflected enzyme content. The amount of Atp1–2p in XJY11 grown on glycerol only increased 1.3-fold following the introduction ofASC1/RAS2 (Table IV) on a centromeric plasmid. The amount of α-subunit increased about 2-fold in both the XJY11 and XJY12 mutants transformed with ASC1/RAS2 on glucose (Table I). This increase in the F1-ATPase α-subunit protein occurred when additional copies of ASC1/RAS2 were present. To further confirm the positive regulatory effect of RAS2 on Atp1p, we determined the level of F1α-subunit in a RAS2deletion mutant. Disruption of ASC1/RAS2 in DC5 decreased the level of Atp1p compared with that of the parental strain (data not shown). The combination of protein and enzymatic analysis (Tables I and IV) was consistent with a model that additional copies of RAS2increased the amount of the F1-ATPase subunit protein in some fashion. In the case of the mutant containing a partially functional atp1–2 subunit, the increase in protein likely provides a threshold level of mutant subunit and activity sufficient to support growth on glycerol. If additional RAS2 gene product suppressed atp1–2 by causing increased levels of the partially active Atp1–2p, then we should restore growth on glycerol of the atp1–2 mutant by introducing and expressing additional copies of the mutant gene. To test this, additional copies ofatp1–2 were placed into the XJY11 mutant on the multicopy plasmid (pYEatp1–2). Following transformation, the level of Atp1–2p and F1-ATPase activity increased and growth was restored on glycerol (Table IV). These data support the model thatASC1/RAS2 controls the amount of α-subunit and ATP synthase activity in mitochondria in response to a non-fermentable carbon source. In this paper we show that the specific mutant of ATP1,atp1–2, but not atp1–1, can be partially suppressed by RAS2, a mediator of signal transduction. Additionally, this is the first report of mutation sites inATP1 in S. cerevisiae and will allow further examination of the role of this subunit in cell growth and its control. These studies identify an essential residue in α-subunit function at Thr383 in the active site and another at Gly291, which retains partial enzymatic function and can be suppressed by RAS2 in multiple copies (Fig.5). There are three copies ofATP1 in yeast (39.Takeda M. Okushiba T. Satoh T. Kuniyoshi S. Morishita C. Ichimura Y. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1995; 118: 607-613Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar, 40.Takeda M. Satoh H. Ohnishi K. Satoh T. Mabuchi T. Yeast. 1999; 15: 873-878Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar); however, the results of sequence analysis of an extensive number of cloned PCR products indicate that only one mutation site was present in each mutant described here. In the mitochondria from atp1–2 as well as atp1–1, the F1-ATPase activity was barely measurable, although Western blotting revealed that there were 47% or 52% level of α-subunits, respectively, compared with the level in the wild-type strain. Expression of ATP1 in the same cell with either Atp1–2p or Atp1–1p yielded a lower specific activity than that forATP1 expression in the absence of the mutants alleles. This indicated competition for assembly between the defective α-subunits, Atp1–2p or Atp1–1p, and the wild type α-subunit expressed fromATP1. The unusual observation that RAS2 could specifically suppress the atp1–2 mutation indicates a relationship between a growth regulatory pathways involving RAS and mitochondrial energy transduction. Analysis of the atp1–2mutation site revealed that it is not located in the catalytic domain like atp1–1 but at the boundary where subunit-subunit interaction is noted (Fig. 5). All of the information presented in this study is consistent with the α-subunit of atp1–2exhibiting residual activity that in the presence of multiple copies ofRAS2 reaches a threshold sufficient for growth on a mitochondrial-dependent substrate. On the other hand, the presence of additional copies of RAS2 in theatp1–1 mutant, XJY12, does not partially restore F1-ATPase activity or growth on glycerol. This is because the atp1–1 mutation is in the catalytic domain (Fig.5). Previous studies have shown that threshold levels of the energy transducing ATPase complex containing as little as 15% of the oligomycin-sensitive ATPase activity of wild type strains is sufficient to support growth on glycerol (41.Mukhopadhyay A. Uh M. Mueller D.M. FEBS Lett. 1994; 343: 160-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). This is consistent with the model that increasing the level of Atp1–2p and/or enhancing its assembly will yield sufficient energy transducing complex for growth on glycerol. This model for suppression of atp1–2 was confirmed in the experiment in which the gene dosage ofatp1–2 was increased using a multicopy plasmid containingatp1–2. The resulting transformants exhibited an increase in F1-ATPase activity and were able to grow on glycerol (Table IV). Thus, increased Atp1–2p due to gene dosage was a necessary condition to support growth on a non-fermentable carbon source. In the XJY12 transformant, the amount of Atp1–1p also increased (Table I) due to ASC1/RAS2. Thus, ASC1/RAS2 appears to be involved in the regulation of α-subunit content in mitochondria. On glucose, the lack of ASC1/RAS2 stimulation of ATPase protein and activity likely reflects the loss of ASC1/RAS2 plasmid due to non-selective growth conditions. RAS2 has been previously characterized in yeast in earlier studies (16.Broach J.R. Deschenes R.J. Adv. Cancer Res. 1990; 54: 79-139Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). One phenotype of different alleles of ras2 is the failure to grow on a non-fermentable carbon source, although a firm characterization of the mechanism of this remains open. RAS2activates adenylyl cyclase, followed by activation of cAMP-dependent protein kinases (42.Tatchell K. Robinson L.C. Breitenbach M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 3785-3789Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar, 43.Toda T. Uno I. Ishikawa T. Powers S. Kataoka T. Broek D. Cameron S. Broach J. Matsumoto K. Wigler M.

The presence of a cAMP-dependent protein kinase on the inner membrane of mitochondria has been reported (45.Rödel G. Müller G. Bandlow W. J.

More recent work indicates a role for protein kinase activity in the regulation of mitochondrial transcription (47.Chandrasekaran K. Jayaraman J. FEBS Lett. 1978; 87: 52-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar, 48.MacEntee C.M. Cantwell R. Rahman M.U. Hudson A.P. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1993; 241: 213-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Dupont et al. also reported thatccs1/ira2, an attenuator gene of RAS1 andRAS2, confers the resistance to inhibitors of the F0 part of ATP synthase and increased in the ATP synthesis rate in mitochondria (49.Dupont C.H. Rigoulet M. Aigle M. Guérin B. Curr. Genet. 1990; 17: 465-472Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar, 50.Bussereau F. Dupont C.H. Boy-Marcotte E. Mallet L. Jacquet M. Curr. Genet. 1992; 21: 325-329Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). This could suggest a role forRAS in the assembly of mitochondrial and nuclear encoded subunits of the complex. The present study directly links a growth mediator to mitochondrial energy coupling. We demonstrate here that the ASC1/RAS2stimulates the F1-ATPase in the atp1–2 mutant. This activation allowed growth on glycerol. Studies of the relationship between mitochondrial function and growth regulatory pathways have yet to be convincingly established in detail. However, considerable activity has recently focused on the pathways that link the function of mitochondria and mitochondrial components to the growth regulatory activities with which they are now firmly established. Most recently, Akt, a protein kinase B, which has been shown to act as an anti apoptotic regulator at many points in the pathway, is itself regulated by phosphorylation (3.Green D.R. Reed J.C. Science. 1998; 281: 1309-1312Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). So far, RAS2 functions have been investigated with glucose as a carbon source. It is well established that the RAS2-cAMP pathway is activated by glucose and thatRAS2 is necessary to grow on a non-fermentable carbon source. Studies are currently in progress to better understand if these regulatory pathways share common control points and why gene dosage ofRAS2 can influence the amount and function of ATPase subunits in mitochondria.

COPI function is, directly or indirectly, essential for anterograde protein transport from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) to the Golgi. Indeed, several mutants of coatomer subunit genes accumulate ER precursor forms of some secretory proteins under restrictive conditions (3.Hosobuchi M. Kreis T. Schekman R. Nature. 1992; 360: 603-605Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar, 5.Duden R. Hosobuchi M. Hamamoto S. Winey M. Byers B. Schekman R. J. Biol.

In the case of anu2Δ cells, ER-to-Golgi anterograde transport of carboxypeptidase Y (CPY) is blocked at the restrictive temperature of 37 °C (10.Duden R. Kajikawa L. Wuestehube L. Schekman R.

Funct. 1999; 24: 197-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Moreover, COPI is believed to directly mediate retrograde protein transport from the Golgi to the ER. Indeed, most of the coatomer subunit mutants studied thus far exhibit defects in retrieval of ER resident proteins to the ER even under permissive or semipermissive conditions (6.Letourneur F.

(Tokyo). 1997; 121: 8-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). For some of these mutants, retrograde inhibition is most obvious at semipermissive temperatures, because inhibition of anterograde transport at restrictive temperatures often makes it difficult to score retrieval efficiency. However, retrieval of an ER- resident test protein is normal both at 30 and 32 °C in anu2Δ cells (10.Duden R. Kajikawa L. Wuestehube L. Schekman R. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 985-995Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 11.Kimata Y. Lim C.R. Kiriyama T. Nara A. Hirata A. Kohno K. Cell Struct. Funct. 1999; 24: 197-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). This seem reasonable if, as discussed in Duden et al. (10.Duden R. Kajikawa L. Wuestehube L. Schekman R. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 985-995Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar) and in this study, the primary defect ofanu2Δ cells is rapid degradation of α-COP occurring only at the restrictive temperature. What is the functional role of ε-COP? A mammalian Chinese hamster ovary mutant cell line, ldlF, contains a single point mutation in the ε-COP gene conferring temperature sensitivity (13.Guo Q. Penman M. Trigatti B.L. Krieger M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 11191-11196Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). When cultured at the restrictive temperature, ldlF cells exhibit rapid degradation of ε-COP and various defects in both the secretory and endocytic pathways (13.Guo Q. Penman M. Trigatti B.L. Krieger M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 11191-11196Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar, 14.Guo Q. Vasile E. Krieger M. J.

However, studies using yeast cells presented a different view, because, as described above, ANU2 was not essential for cell growth at low temperatures. In contrast, all of the coatomer genes apart fromANU2 are essential for cell viability at all temperatures (3.Hosobuchi M. Kreis T. Schekman R.

(10.Duden R. Kajikawa L. Wuestehube L. Schekman R. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 985-995Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar) provided several lines of evidence suggesting that one role of ε-COP is to stabilize another coatomer subunit, α-COP. First, temperature-sensitive defects ofanu2Δ cells are suppressed by overexpression of the α-COP gene, RET1. Second, overexpression ofANU2 suppresses defects of an α-COP mutant,ret1-3, in which α-COP is unstable at the restrictive temperature. Third and most importantly, α-COP, but none of the other coatomer subunits, is rapidly degraded in anu2Δ cells shifted to the restrictive temperature of 37 °C. In their view, the primary defect of anu2Δ cells should be the rapid degradation of α-COP, and thus they may grow even at the restrictive temperature provided that this degradation is blocked. However, no data concerning this have been published. As a step toward understanding further the role(s) of ε-COP, we tried to find conditions in which temperature-sensitive defects ofanu2Δ cells are rescued. Here we show that inanu2Δ cells shifted to 37 °C, impairment in proteasome-dependent protein breakdown rescues the growth defect as well as preventing the rapid diminution of α-COP levels otherwise observed. Our results provide evidence that the primary defect of anu2Δ cells is rapid degradation of α-COP and thus that a function of ε-COP is to stabilize α-COP. It is likely that ε-COP acts to maintain structural integrity of α-COP. Plasmids pRS316 and pRS306 are yeast centromeric and integrative vectors, respectively, containing the URA3selectable marker (17.Sikorski R.S. Hieter P. Genetics. 1989; 122: 19-27Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A centromeric plasmid containing theANU2 gene, pYIL076w (11.Kimata Y. Lim C.R. Kiriyama T. Nara A. Hirata A. Kohno K. Cell Struct. Funct. 1999; 24: 197-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar), was renamed pRS316-ANU2. The isolation of plasmids YCp50–072.1 and YCp50–072.2 from a centromere-based genomic library (18.Rose M.D. Novick P. Thomas J.H. Botstein D. Fink G.R. Gene (Amst.). 1987; 60: 237-243Crossref PubMed Scopus (831) Google Scholar) and subsequent construction of plasmids pRS316-PRE8 and pRS306-pRE8 are described below. Plasmid pUb-Leu-lacZ was used for GAL promoter-controlled expression of a ubiquitin-leucine-β-galactosidase fusion protein (19.Bachmair A. Finley D. Varshavsky A. Science. 1986; 234: 179-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (1402) Google Scholar). Plasmid pNLS-lacZ, a generous gift of Dr. M. Oka (Washington University, St. Louis, MO) was used for GAL promoter-controlled expression of β-galactosidase tagged with the nuclear localization sequence (NLS) of the SV40 large T antigen (20.Dingwall C. Laskey R.A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1991; 16: 478-481Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1713) Google Scholar). Both pUb-Leu-lacZ and pNLS-lacZ are 2-μm plasmids containing the URA3 selectable marker. YPD is a rich medium containing 2% dextrose, 2% bactopeptone (Difco, Detroit, MI), and 1% yeast extract. SD is a synthetic minimal medium containing 2% dextrose, 0.67% yeast nitrogen base (Difco), and auxotrophic requirements. SG is the same as SD, except that 2% galactose is substituted for dextrose. SC is a synthetic complete medium containing 2% dextrose, 0.67% yeast nitrogen base, and growth supplements described in Ref. 21.Kaiser C. Michaelis S. Mitchell A. Methods in Yeast Genetics: A Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Course Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1994Google Scholar. SC-Met is the same as SC except that it lacks methionine and cysteine. Agar (2%) was added for solid media. S. cerevisiae strains used in this study are listed in TableI. FY strains were generous gifts of Dr. F. Winston (Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA). All YKIM strains were derived from FY strains. To obtain strains YKIM21 and YKIM22, theANU2 gene was disrupted by replacing its coding region with the LEU2 gene as described previously (11.Kimata Y. Lim C.R. Kiriyama T. Nara A. Hirata A. Kohno K. Cell Struct. Funct. 1999; 24: 197-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Strain YKIM31 was isolated as an extragenic suppressor of anu2Δ as described below. To obtain strains YKIM32, YKIM41, and YKIM42, strain YKIM31 was backcrossed several times with FY strains.Table IYeast strainsStrainRelevant genotypeSourceFY8MATα ura3–52 lys2Δ202F.

Colonies arose at a frequency higher than 10−5. Clones able to grow at 37.0 °C were backcrossed with an anu2Δ strain (YKIM22), and their meiotic progeny were assayed for growth phenotypes to determine whether these candidates harbored extragenic mutations suppressinganu2Δ. A tan1-1 strain (YKIM41) was transformed with a yeast genomic library in the centromeric vector YCp50 (Ref. 18.Rose M.D. Novick P. Thomas J.H. Botstein D. Fink G.R. Gene (Amst.). 1987; 60: 237-243Crossref PubMed Scopus (831) Google Scholar; ATCC37415, ATCC, Manassas, VA). Two plasmids (YCp50–072.1 and YCp50–072.2) capable of complementing the weak temperature sensitivity (retarded growth at 38.5 °C) of YKIM41 were isolated. Sequence analysis revealed that these plasmids carried genomic DNA inserts with a 1.4-kilobase overlapping region containing the PRE8 gene. To create plasmid pRS316-PRE8, a 1.5-kilobaseHindIII-BglII genomic DNA fragment (containingPRE8) from YCp50–072.1 was subcloned into theHindIII and BamHI sites of pRS316. The tan1-1 mutation was mapped to the PRE8 locus by integrative mapping. To create plasmid pRS306-PRE8, thePRE8-containing DNA fragment described above was subcloned into the HindIII and BamHI sites of pRS306. To obtain strain YKIM50, pRS306-PRE8 was linearized within thePRE8 sequence with BamHI and transformed into a wild-type strain (FY24). Integration of the URA3 gene at thePRE8 locus of YKIM50 was confirmed by genomic Southern analysis. YKIM50 was then crossed with a tan1-1 strain (YKIM41), and the resultant diploid strain was subjected to meiotic analysis (30 tetrads). For every tetrad analyzed, the URA3marker was constantly found to segregate away from the weakly temperature-sensitive tan1-1 allele. A rabbit antiserum against purified yeast coatomer was generously provided by Dr. R. Duden (University of Cambridge, Cambridge, UK; Ref. 5.Duden R. Hosobuchi M. Hamamoto S. Winey M. Byers B. Schekman R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 24486-24495Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Antisera recognizing yeast β-COP were produced by immunizing rabbits with recombinant yeast β-COP (further details are available upon request). A rabbit polyclonal antibody against CPY was generously provided by Dr. A. Nakano (RIKEN, Saitama, Japan). A rabbit polyclonal antibody against β-galactosidase was provided by Cappel (West Chester, PA). For pulse labeling of cells, [35S]methionine/cysteine (Express protein labeling mix; NEN Life Science Products) was added to the cultures (1.6 MBq/ml), and incubation was continued for 5 min. Chase was initiated by adding cycloheximide (final concentration, 0.5 mg/ml) to the cultures and terminated by adding trichloroacetic acid (final concentration, 10%). Cells were harvested from 1 ml of cultures, and immunoprecipitation was carried out as described in Klionsky et al. (22.Klionsky D.J. Banta L.M. Emr S.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 2105-2116Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar), except that the antibody used was against β-galactosidase. MG132 (carbobenzoxyl-leucinyl-leucinyl-leucinal) was provided by Peptide Institute, Inc. (Osaka, Japan). Before treatment with MG132, cells were grown to 0.1 (for measurement of the growth curve) or 1.0 (for other assays) A 600/ml in SC-Met at 23 °C. MG132 was prepared as a 50 mm stock solution in Me2SO. This stock solution was added to the cultures to obtain a 50 μm final concentration of MG132. An equal volume of Me2SO (without MG132) was added to the treatment control cultures. These cultures were shifted to 37 °C just after addition of MG132 or Me2SO, and incubation was continued for 2 h for the assays described below. Bovine serum albumin (final concentration, 500 μg/ml) and α2-macroglobulin (final concentration, 100 μg/ml) were added to the MG132-treated and control cultures 10 min before pulse labeling. For pulse labeling of cells, [35S]methionine/cysteine was added to the cultures (4 MBq/ml), and incubation was continued for 10 min at 37 °C. Chase was initiated by adding excess amounts of unlabeled methionine (final concentration, 1 mm) and cysteine (final concentration, 0.8 mm) to the cultures and continued for 30 min at 37 °C. After the pulse-chase, the cultures were centrifuged at 5,000 ×g for 5 min. Then media fractions were precipitated by adding trichloroacetic acid to a final concentration of 10%. After washing the pellets twice in acetone, proteins were solubilized in Laemmli sample buffer plus 100 mm dithiothreitol, boiled, and centrifuged at 16,000 × g for 15 min, and 0.25A 600 equivalents were loaded for 8% SDS-PAGE. Gels were analyzed with a BAS-5000 Bio-Imaging Analyzer (Fujifilm, Tokyo, Japan). Measurement of β-galactosidase activity in yeast cells usingo-nitrophenyl-β-d-galactopyranoside as the substrate was performed as described in Ref. 21.Kaiser C. Michaelis S. Mitchell A. Methods in Yeast Genetics: A Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Course Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1994Google Scholar. For CPY transport assays, pulse and chase experiments were carried out as described by Yamazaki et al. (9.Yamazaki S. Harashima S. Sakaguchi M. Mihara K. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1997; 121: 8-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar), except that cells were cultured as described above under “Treatment of Cells with MG132.” Cell extracts for Western blot analysis were prepared as described in Dudenet al. (10.Duden R. Kajikawa L. Wuestehube L. Schekman R. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 985-995Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar), and Western blot analysis was performed as described previously (11.Kimata Y. Lim C.R. Kiriyama T. Nara A. Hirata A. Kohno K. Cell Struct. Funct. 1999; 24: 197-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). To gain further understanding of the role(s) of ε-COP, we isolated spontaneous suppressors that rescue the temperature-sensitive growth defect of anu2Δ cells. Six mutants that contained mutations allowing growth of anu2Δcells at 37.0 °C were characterized. All of them contained single mutations, termed tan (confer temperature resistance to anu2Δ cells) mutations, that showed no genetic linkage to each other or ANU2. One of the suppressors, tan1-1, was further characterized, as shown in Fig. 1. As described above,anu2Δ tan1-1 double mutant cells grew even at 37.0 °C. The tan1-1 mutation itself confers weak temperature sensitivity, because tan1-1 single mutant cells showed retarded growth at the higher temperature of 38.5 °C. At this temperature, anu2Δ tan1-1 double mutant cells did not grow at all. The gene affected in tan1-1 single mutant cells was cloned by complementation of their weak temperature sensitivity after transformation with a centromeric library. Genomic DNA inserts of two library plasmids complementing tan1-1 shared only one open reading frame. The gene corresponding to this open reading frame isPRE8 (PRS4). As shown in Fig. 1, the weak temperature sensitivity of tan1-1 cells was complemented by a plasmid carrying a genomic DNA fragment containing only one open reading frame of PRE8. This plasmid also complemented the ability of anu2Δ tan1-1 double mutant cells to grow at 37 °C. Integrative mapping confirmed that the tan1-1mutation mapped to PRE8. PRE8 encodes an α-type subunit of the 20 S proteasome (23.Emori Y. Tsukahara T. Kawasaki H. Ishiura S. Sugita H. Suzuki K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 344-353Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar), which is the “catalytic core” of a larger 26 S complex that degrades proteins by an ATP-dependent process (24.Coux O. Tanaka K. Goldberg A.L. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1996; 65: 801-847Crossref PubMed Scopus (2239) Google Scholar, 25.Baumeister W. Walz J. Zuhl F. Seemuller E. Cell. 1998; 92: 367-380Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1310) Google Scholar). Because tan1-1 is allelic toPRE8, we tested whether proteasome function is impaired intan1-1 cells. To check the ability of the proteasome to degrade proteins in vivo, we used an N-end rule substrate Leu-β-galactosidese (Leu-β-gal), which bears N-terminal Leu, a destabilizing residue (19.Bachmair A. Finley D. Varshavsky A. Science. 1986; 234: 179-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (1402) Google Scholar, 26.Varshavsky A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 12142-12149Crossref PubMed Scopus (724) Google Scholar). When Leu-β-gal is expressed as a ubiquitin-tagged form in yeast cells, it is rapidly cleaved into an untagged form and degraded. SV40 T antigen NLS-tagged β-galactosidase (NLS-β-gal) was used as a stable protein control that was barely degraded by the proteasome. In wild-type and tan1-1 cells, Leu-β-gal (initially tagged with ubiquitin) or NLS-β-gal was expressed under GALpromoter control. When cultured at the semipermissive temperature of 36 °C, tan1-1 cells had a 4-fold greater steady-state level of enzymatically active Leu-β-gal than wild-type cells (Fig.2 A). In contrast, the steady-state level of enzymatically active NLS-β-gal was slightly lower in tan1-1 cells than in wild-type cells (Fig.2 B). Furthermore, a pulse-chase experiment confirmed that degradation of Leu-β-gal is severely retarded in tan1-1cells (Fig. 2 C). These results indicate, as expected, that proteasome-dependent proteolysis is impaired intan1-1 cells. To demonstrate that temperature sensitivity of anu2Δ cells is rescued in a general way by impaired proteasome function rather than by some specific activity of the tan1-1 mutation, we used a pharmacological inhibitor of the proteasome. Some peptide aldehydes are known to act as substrate analogues of the 20 S proteasome (27.Lee D.H. Goldberg A.L. Trends Cell Biol. 1998; 8: 397-403Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1252) Google Scholar). We chose carbobenzoxyl-leucinyl-leucinyl-leucinal, named MG132, as a proteasome inhibitor, because it inhibits proteasome-dependent proteolysis not only in mammalian cells but also in yeast cells (28.Lee D.H. Goldberg A.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 27280-27284Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (344) Google Scholar). In contrast to a report by Lee and Goldberg (28.Lee D.H. Goldberg A.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 27280-27284Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (344) Google Scholar), MG132 was effective in our strains, which were wild-type forISE1/ERG6 (data not shown), mutation of which enhances permeability to many drugs (29.Graham T.R. Scott P.A. Emr S.D. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 869-877Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 3, wild-type andanu2Δ cells were shifted to 37 °C with or without MG132. Growth of wild-type cells was slightly retarded by MG132. In contrast, MG132 clearly restored growth of anu2Δ cells. Taken together with the observations on the tan1-1 mutation, this result shows that impaired proteasome function rescues temperature sensitivity of anu2Δ cells. Duden et al.(10.Duden R. Kajikawa L. Wuestehube L. Schekman R. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 985-995Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar) reported that α-COP, but none of the other coatomer subunits, is rapidly degraded in anu2Δ cells shifted to the restrictive temperature of 37 °C. We therefore tested whether MG132 inhibits this degradation. α-COP levels in anu2Δ cells apparently diminished within 2 h after the temperature shift to 37 °C in the absence of MG132, whereas they remained roughly constant in the presence of MG132 (Fig. 4). In wild-type cells, α-COP levels were almost unaffected by temperature shift or by addition of MG132. In contrast, levels of another coatomer subunit, β-COP, in anu2Δ cells did not differ significantly from those in wild-type cells under any of these conditions. To analyze general protein secretion rather than that of specific test proteins, Gaynor and Emr (12.Gaynor E.C. Emr S.D. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 136: 789-802Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar) pulse-chase labeled various sec mutant cells with [35S]methionine/cysteine and collected total media proteins to visualize them by SDS-PAGE and autoradiography. They showed that no media proteins were secreted from either sec18,sec23, or sec1 mutant cells under their restrictive conditions. This is reasonable, because, for example, Sec23p is an essential subunit of COPII (30.Barlowe C. Orci L. Yeung T. Hosobuchi M. Hamamoto S. Salama N. Rexach M.F. Ravazzola M. Amherdt M. Schekman R. Cell. 1994; 77: 895-907Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1058) Google Scholar), which is believed to govern anterograde vesicle formation from the ER. In contrast, some of the media proteins were still secreted from a γ-COP mutant,sec21-3. We performed this general secretion assay using anu2Δcells. Wild-type and anu2Δ cells were cultured at 37 °C in the presence or absence of MG132 for 2 h and then pulse-chase labeled with [35S]methionine/cysteine, and their media proteins were analyzed. At least nine protein bands were apparent in media from wild-type cells, and they were almost unaffected by MG132 (Fig. 5 A, compare lanes 1 and 2). We focused on three major bands, which were tentatively named secretory proteins (SP) 1, 2, and 3, and quantified them using a BAS-5000 image analyzer (Fig. 5 B). In the absence of MG132, secretion of SP1 and SP2 was significantly reduced by the anu2Δ mutation, whereas that of SP3 was not. MG132 restored secretion of SP2 from anu2Δ cells to the normal extent. However, secretion of SP1 from anu2Δ cells was impaired even in the presence of MG132. We also assayed intracellular transport of an endogenous vacuolar protein, CPY. CPY is commonly used as a test protein to evaluate efficiency of anterograde secretory transport in yeast cells. CPY is synthesized initially as a proenzyme that is first modified with core oligosaccharides in the ER, generating the p1 form, and next in the Golgi complex, where the core sugars are elongated, generating the p2 form. After delivery to the vacuole, the pro region is cleaved to yield the mature enzyme (31.Stevens T. Esmon B. Schekman R. Cell. 1982; 30: 439-448Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (371) Google Scholar). Wild-type and anu2Δ cells cultured at 37 °C in the presence or absence of MG132 for 2 h were pulse-chase labeled with [35S]methionine/cysteine, and then CPY was recovered by immunoprecipitation. In wild-type cells cultured both in the presence and absence of MG132, the p1 and p2 forms of CPY were rapidly transported to the vacuole concomitantly with the processing to the mature form. In contrast, anu2Δ cells cultured in the absence of MG132 accumulated the p1 form. Whenanu2Δ cells was cultured in the presence of MG132, CPY partially appeared as the mature form after the 20-min chase. This result indicates that ER-to-Golgi anterograde transport of CPY is blocked in anu2Δ cells and that this block is partially rescued by MG132. In this study, we show that impairment of proteasome-dependent proteolysis rescues the temperature sensitivity of anu2Δ cells by two means. First, this temperature sensitivity was suppressed by a mutation in thePRE8 gene (Fig. 1), which encodes a 20 S proteasome subunit. Impairment of proteasome-dependent proteolysis in thispre8 mutant was confirmed by accumulation of a test substrate of the proteasome in vivo (Fig. 2). Second, a proteasome inhibitor, MG132, restored growth of anu2Δcells at the restrictive temperature (Fig. 3). Duden et al.(10.Duden R. Kajikawa L. Wuestehube L. Schekman R. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 985-995Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar) indicated that α-COP, but none of the other coatomer subunits, is rapidly degraded in anu2Δ cells shifted to the restrictive temperature. Here we also show that this rapid degradation of α-COP is inhibited by MG132 (Fig. 4). α-COP levels in wild-type cells were almost unaffected by the presence of MG132. The most likely explanation for these results is that the primary defect ofanu2Δ cells is inappropriate degradation of α-COP by the proteasome and thus that anu2Δ cells can grow even at the restrictive temperature, provided that this degradation is blocked. Therefore, we interpret our findings as direct evidence that a function of ε-COP is to stabilize α-COP as initially proposed by Dudenet al. (Ref. 10.Duden R. Kajikawa L. Wuestehube L. Schekman R. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 985-995Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar; see “Introduction”). In this view, ε-COP should not be a key element in coatomer. Indeed, all of the coatomer subunit genes apart from ANU2 are essential for cell viability (3.Hosobuchi M. Kreis T. Schekman R. Nature. 1992; 360: 603-605Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar, 5.Duden R. Hosobuchi M. Hamamoto S. Winey M. Byers B. Schekman R. J. Biol.

(Tokyo). 1997; 121: 8-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). Moreover, to our knowledge, there are no reports suggesting direct interaction of ε-COP with cellular components except other coatomer subunits. Lowe and Kreis (32.Lowe M. Kreis T.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 30725-30730Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar) investigated the assembly of the coatomer subunits in mammalian cells using native immunoprecipitations from pulse-chase labeled cells. They showed that ε-COP is the last subunit to be added to the coatomer complex during its biosynthetic assembly, suggesting that ε-COP is not a core subunit in this complex. The study by Lowe and Kreis (32.Lowe M. Kreis T.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 30725-30730Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar) also showed that biosynthetic assembly of the coatomer complex takes 1–2 h to complete and that once assembled, this complex is stable with a half-life of about 28 h. In addition, they reported that no significant amounts of partial coatomer complexes could be detected and that the only subunit to exist in a steady-state outside of the coatomer complex is ζ-COP. According to Hara-Kuge et al. (33.Hara-Kuge S. Kuge O. Orci L. Amherdt M. Ravazzola M. Wieland F.T. Rothman J.E. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 124: 883-892Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar), coatomer is incorporated en bloc into the COPI coat during vesicle formation. Hence, it is likely that the coatomer complex is hardly disassembled at all under physiological conditions. ε-COP probably interacts directly with α-COP in this complex, as supported by the following three lines of evidence. The first is the results from yeast two-hybrid analysis of the coatomer subunits (34.Faulstich D. Auerbach S. Orci L. Ravazzola M. Wegchingel S. Lottspeich F. Stenbeck G. Harter C. Wieland F.T. Tschochner H. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 53-61Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). The second is the interaction of in vitro translated ε-COP and α-COP (34.Faulstich D. Auerbach S. Orci L. Ravazzola M. Wegchingel S. Lottspeich F. Stenbeck G. Harter C. Wieland F.T. Tschochner H. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 53-61Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar), and the third isin vitro disassembly assays of coatomer showing that at high salt concentrations, the coatomer complex is disassembled to generate a partial complex comprising α-, β′-, and ε-COP (35.Lowe M. Kreis T.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 31364-31371Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Based on our results and the literature reports discussed above, we speculate that ε-COP is constantly bound to α-COP as a kind of additional element to maintain α-COP structural integrity and thus the coatomer complex, especially at high temperatures. One of the critical functions of the proteasome-dependent protein degradation machinery is the rapid breakdown of abnormal proteins. Hence, it is likely that the α-COP that is not bound to ε-COP is recognized as “abnormal” protein by this machinery. In this study, we also examined whether MG132 restores the secretory pathway in anu2Δ cells (Fig. 5). Similar to a γ-COP mutant described by Gaynor and Emr (12.Gaynor E.C. Emr S.D. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 136: 789-802Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar), only some of the media proteins exhibited reduced secretion in anu2Δ cells shifted to the restrictive temperature. MG132 restored secretion of only one of two major media proteins the secretion of which was apparently reduced by the anu2Δ mutation. This observation suggests that MG132 only partially rescues defects in the secretory pathway in anu2Δ cells cultured at the restrictive temperature and thus that some kinds of functional impairment remain in coatomer lacking ε-COP even when degradation of α-COP is blocked. One possible explanation for this is that under such conditions, loss of structural integrity of α-COP can lead to impaired coatomer function. A second possible explanation is that in addition to the stabilization of α-COP, ε-COP may possess unknown function(s) unessential for cell viability. A novel finding reported here is that a null mutation of a certain gene can be compensated by impaired proteasome function. We interpret this as implying that this gene encodes a protein that plays a role in maintaining the structural integrity of another protein. In the present study, we focused on ε-COP and the coatomer complex. However, these findings may in principle apply to cytosolic protein complexes other than coatomer, if they contain components acting to maintain structural integrity of other components. In this case, it might be possible to compensate loss of such components by impaired proteasome function. Therefore, the approach used in this study may be adapted to dissect functions of proteins contained in cytosolic protein complexes other than coatomer. We are grateful to Dr. Rainier Duden for an antiserum against purified yeast coatomer, Dr. Akihiko Nakano for an anti-CPY antibody, and Kazumi Maekawa for excellent technical assistance."
https://openalex.org/W2082452115,"To study the folding of human Escherichia coli heat-stable enterotoxin STh, we used the major protein subunit of CS31A fimbriae (ClpG) as a marker of STh secretion and a provider of a signal peptide. We established that STh genetically fused to the N or C terminus of ClpG was able to mobilize ClpG to the culture supernatant while still retaining full enterotoxicity. These features indicate that the STh activity was not altered by the chimeric structure and suggest that spatial conformation of STh in the fusion is close to that of the native toxin, thus permitting recognition and activation of the intestinal STh receptor in vivo. In contrast to other studies, we showed that disulfide bond formation did not occur in the periplasm through the DsbA pathway and that there was no correlation between DsbA and secretion, folding, or activity. This discrepancy was not attributable to the chimeric nature of STh since there was no effect of dsbA or dsbB mutations on secretion and activity of recombinant STh from which ClpG had been deleted. Periplasmic and lysate fractions ofdsbA + and dsbA − cells did not have any STh activity. In addition, the STh chimera was exclusively found in an inactive reduced form intracellularly and in an active oxidized form extracellularly, irrespective of thedsbA background. Subsequently, a time course experiment in regard to the secretion of STh from both dsbA +and dsbA − cells indicated that the enterotoxin activity (proper folding) in the extracellular milieu increased with time. Overall, these findings provide evidence that STa toxins can be cell-released in an unfolded state before being completely disulfide-bonded outside the cell. To study the folding of human Escherichia coli heat-stable enterotoxin STh, we used the major protein subunit of CS31A fimbriae (ClpG) as a marker of STh secretion and a provider of a signal peptide. We established that STh genetically fused to the N or C terminus of ClpG was able to mobilize ClpG to the culture supernatant while still retaining full enterotoxicity. These features indicate that the STh activity was not altered by the chimeric structure and suggest that spatial conformation of STh in the fusion is close to that of the native toxin, thus permitting recognition and activation of the intestinal STh receptor in vivo.

J. Infect. 1992; 24: 225-245Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). STa causes intestinal fluid secretion by binding to its cellular receptor, transmembrane guanylyl cyclase C (2.Schulz S. Green C.K. Yuen P.S.T. Garbers D.L. Cell. 1990; 63: 941-948Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (521) Google Scholar), thus activating guanylyl cyclase C and leading to an increase in intracellular mucosal cGMP. This increase in cGMP adversely affects electrolyte flux in the intestine; sodium absorption is inhibited, and chloride secretion is stimulated. These ion flux changes result in the secretory diarrhea characteristic of enterotoxigenic E. coli infection (3.Field M. Graf Jr., L.H. Laird W.J. Smith P.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1978; 75: 2800-2804Crossref PubMed Scopus (433) Google Scholar, 4.Guerrant R.L. Hugues J.M. Chang B. Robertson D.C. Murad F. J. Infect. Dis. 1980; 142: 220-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). The receptor binding and enterotoxic properties of STa have been mapped to a highly conserved 13-amino acid C-terminal core sequence essential for toxicity and the heat-stable nature of the toxin. Six cysteine residues are present within this domain, and the three intramolecular disulfide bonds formed between the cysteine residues are necessary for toxicity of the molecule (5.Gariépy J. Judd A.K. Schoolnick G.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 8907-8911Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). The two species of STa, STp and STh, from porcine (or bovine) and human strains of enterotoxigenic E. coli, respectively, are typical extracellular peptides consisting of 18 (STp) or 19 (STh) amino acid residues (6.So M. McCarthy B.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1980; 77: 4011-4015Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar, 7.Guzman-Verduzco L.-M. Kupersztoch Y.M. Infect. Immun. 1989; 57: 645-648Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). STa is synthesized in the cytoplasm as a 72-amino acid precursor consisting of pre-, pro-, and mature STa regions (8.Okamoto K. Takahara M. J. Bacteriol. 1990; 172: 5260-5265Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 9.Rasheed J.K. Guzman-Verduzco L.-M. Kupersztoch Y.M. Mol. Microbiol. 1990; 4: 265-273Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). The precursor is translocated across the inner membrane by the Sec-dependent export pathway (10.Pugsley A. Microbiol. Rev. 1993; 57: 50-108Crossref PubMed Google Scholar); the 19-amino acid leader peptide is removed by signal peptidase; and the generated 53-amino acid pro-STa intermediate is delivered to the periplasm. The natural pre- and prosequences are dispensable for STa secretion (8.Okamoto K. Takahara M. J. Bacteriol. 1990; 172: 5260-5265Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Mature STa without the prosequence may be able to gain access to the extracellular milieu upon its entry into the E. coli periplasm, once guided into this compartment by a heterologous periplasmic leader peptide (11.Sanchez J. Solorzano R.M. Holmgren J. FEBS Lett. 1993; 330: 265-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). Conflicting observations have been reported on the mechanism of secretion of the toxin from the periplasm to the outside of the cell, making this mechanism poorly understood. Indeed, some authors found that the pro-STa region is cleaved in the periplasmic space, where the thiol-disulfide oxidoreductase DsbA (14.Bardwell J.C.A. McGovern K. Beckwith J. Cell. 1991; 67: 581-589Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (829) Google Scholar) directly catalyzes the formation of the disulfide bonds of STa, and that dsbA mutation causes a marked reduction in STa activity (12.Yamanaka H. Kameyama M. Baba T. Fujii Y. Okamoto K. J. Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 2906-2913Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 13.Yamanaka H. Nomura T. Fujii Y. Okamoto K. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 3383-3390Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast, other investigators hypothesized that pro-STa can exit to the extracellular milieu and that STa is disulfide-bonded outside the cell, making the role of DsbA in STa folding unclear (9.Rasheed J.K. Guzman-Verduzco L.-M. Kupersztoch Y.M. Mol. Microbiol. 1990; 4: 265-273Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 15.Yang Y. Gao Z. Guzman-Verduzco L.-M. Tachias K. Kuperztoch Y.M. Mol. Microbiol. 1992; 6: 3521-3529Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Such disagreement may be explained by the small size of the STa molecule and the escape velocity with which it is released into the extracellular milieu and thus by the difficulty in detecting and quantifying the intermediates in the different cellular compartments. In addition, STa is poorly antigenic and not immunogenic and reacts unexpectedly in conventional protein treatments such as staining, trichloroacetic acid precipitation, and electrophoresis (16.Rasheed J.K. Guzman-Verduzco L.-M. Kupersztoch Y.M. Microb. Pathog. 1988; 5: 333-343Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar), thus limiting progress in the elucidation of the STa secretion pathway. For these reasons, a number of attempts to develop genetic fusions between STa and heterologous carrier proteins have been made (11.Sanchez J. Solorzano R.M. Holmgren J. FEBS Lett. 1993; 330: 265-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). Unfortunately, in most cases, the resulting chimeras were periplasmic or membrane-associated, and no STa activity was detected in the extracellular milieu. In contrast, in this work, we have shown that fusions containing various STa peptides at the N or C terminus of ClpG, the major protein subunit of E. coli CS31A fimbriae (17.Girardeau J.-P. Bertin Y. Martin C. Der Vartanian M. Bœuf C. J. Bacteriol. 1991; 173: 7673-7683Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar), result in the extracellular secretion of ClpG-STa hybrids with high enterotoxin activity. We used ClpG as a marker to facilitate STa detection in secretion and folding studies. We analyzed the effects of dsbA and dsbB mutations on the secretion and enterotoxicity of STa chimeras and determined the redox state of STa, both inside and outside of dsbA +and dsbA − E. coli cells. Disulfide bond formation during translocation of STa across the outer membrane was also examined. The bacterial strains and plasmids used in this study are presented in Table I.

Open table in a new tab We made a variety of constructs to increase our chances of success in producing chimeric proteins with enterotoxigenic activity (see Fig. 1). Plasmid pHPCO838 was constructed from pDEV41155 (20.Der Vartanian M. Méchin M.-C. Jaffeux B. Bertin Y. Félix I. Gaillard-Martinie B. Gene (Amst.). 1994; 148: 23-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar) by in vitro site-directed mutagenesis (23.Méchin M.-C. Der Vartanian M. Martin C. Gene (Amst.). 1996; 179: 211-218Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar) using mutagenic and selection primers. The former primer (5′-CGTGGCAGTAACTTATGTTAACTAATTGGCTTGA-3′) created a uniqueHpaI site and added a valine between the penultimate tyrosine and the last C-terminal residue (asparagine) of ClpG. The latter primer (5′-CGCAGGAAAGAAGATCTGAGCAAAAGGCG-3′) mutated the singleAflIII restriction site of the pSK+ plasmid vector into a single BglII site. Plasmid pSTN24 was engineered from pHPCO838 as follows. A synthetic double-stranded DNA (the 5′ → 3′ single coding strand was CGGCAGATCTGTACTGCTGTGAACTTTGTTGTAATCCTGCCTGTACAGGATGTTACCCTGCAGATCCTCATG) encoding the last 15 amino acids of mature STh and containingSphI-flanked ends was inserted in frame in the correct orientation into the SphI site of pHPCO838; the initial signal peptidase cleavage sequence (−3AHA−1↓+1WT+2) was changed to an improved processing site (−3AHA−1↓+1AD+2) based on the predictive accuracy estimation of von Heijne (24.von Heijne G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1986; 14: 4683-4690Crossref PubMed Scopus (3693) Google Scholar). Plasmids pSTDG126 and pSPGST1, expressing the last 15 amino acids of mature STh and the entire 19-amino acid sequence of mature STh, respectively, were constructed after insertion of paired oligonucleotides (the two 5′ → 3′ single coding strands were CGGCAGATCTGTACTGCTGTGAACTTTGTTGTAATCCTGCCTGTACAGGATGTTACTAAGTT and CGAATTCTTCTAACTACTGCTGTGAACTTTGTTGTAATCCTGCCTGTACAGGATGTTACTAAGTT, respectively) between the SphI and HpaI sites of pHPCO838. Plasmid pSTC22 was constructed by cloning a synthetic DNA duplex (the 5′ → 3′ single coding strand was AACCCTGATAACCCCGGGAACTACTGCTGTGAACT TTGTTGTAATCCTGCCTGTACAGGATGTTACTAA) encoding the last 16 amino acids of mature STh and containingHpaI and SmaI sites between the HpaI and XbaI sites of pHPCO838. Plasmid pSTC17 was pSTC22 with the HpaI-SmaI fragment deleted, thus placing a glycine precisely at the ClpG-STh junction. Plasmid pProSTC28 was made by inserting a blunt-ended DNA fragment (the 5′ → 3′ single coding strand was AACAAAAGTGGTCCTGAATCGATGAATTCTAGC) encoding amino acid residues 46–53 (NKSGPESM) of the pro-STh peptide plus the first three residues (NSS) of mature STh between the HpaI and SmaI sites of pSTC22. We hypothesized that this natural linker might favor folding of the STh moiety in the hybrid in a more effective way. To obtain plasmid pEHProSTC28, theMunI-Ecl136II fragment of pProSTC28 containing the clpG::STh fusion gene was subcloned in the low-copy number plasmid pEH524 within the clp operon in place of the MunI-HpaI fragment carrying nativeclpG. This same fusion gene was IPTG1-overexpressed by cloning the KpnI-BglII fragment of pProSTC28 downstream of the Ptrc promoter between the KpnI andBamHI sites of pTrc99A, resulting in pTrcProSTC28. A synthetic gene (the 5′ → 3′ single coding strand was CGGTTAACATGAATTCTGCAGTT) encoding the last 16 amino acids of mature STh and containing an HpaI site was placed in frame between theSphI and HpaI sites of pSTC22, and the resulting construct was either HpaI/HpaI-deleted, leading to pGMSTC71, or HpaI/SmaI-deleted, leading to pGMSTC710. The same DNA fragment was also introduced between theSphI and HpaI sites of pProSTC28, and the resulting plasmid was HpaI/HpaI-deleted, leading to pGMSTC13/19. All other standard techniques were performed essentially as described previously (25.Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). The oligonucleotides used in this study were supplied by Eurogentec (Belgium). Fusion genes were checked by sequencing (26.Sanger F. Nicklen S. Coulson A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 5463-5467Crossref PubMed Scopus (52669) Google Scholar). LB broth preculture (1 or 2 ml) containing exponentially growing cells was poured onto LB agar plates, which were incubated overnight at 37 °C in a humid atmosphere with the agar surface facing up. Bacteria were carefully harvested by scraping from the agar surface. After centrifugation at 12,000 × g for 10 min, the resulting supernatant was separated from the cell pellet and used as the solid culture supernatant fraction. Supernatants from LB broth cultures were obtained after centrifugation and used as the liquid culture supernatant fraction. The bacterial enumeration expressed in colony-forming units/ml was done by spreading out dilutions of PBS-suspended cells on MacConkey lactose agar medium containing the appropriate antibiotic. Competitive ELISA using a commercially available assay kit for E. coli STa (COLI ST EIA, Denka Seiken Co., Ltd., Tokyo, Japan) (27.Scotland S.M. Willshaw G.A. Said B. Smith H.R. Rowe B. J. Clin. Microbiol. 1989; 27: 1697-1699Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) was performed to detect and quantify fusion proteins in culture supernatants. The reactivity of the STa moiety of hybrids was determined using STa-monospecific horseradish peroxidase-conjugated antibodies and ELISA plates coated with synthetic STa peptide. After the wells were washed once with the supplied buffer, 200 μl of serially diluted samples and 10 μl of conjugated monoclonal antibody were added. After incubation for 90 min at room temperature, the contents were removed, and the wells were washed five times with buffer. Enzyme substrate solution (100 μl), prepared by adding H2O2 solution too-phenylenediamine, was added, and the plate was left in the dark at room temperature for 30 min. After the reaction was stopped by addition of 100 μl of 1.5 nH2SO4, the absorbance at 490 nm was measured using a Dynatech MR5000 microplate reader. A positive sample was identified by inhibition of binding of horseradish peroxidase-conjugated monoclonal antibodies to the well, as demonstrated by a decrease in A 490. The positive samples were defined as giving A 490 < 0.2 (as this is a competitive assay), and the negative samples were defined as giving A 490 ≥ 1.2. The concentration of STa in culture supernatants was determined by reference to a standard curve, which was constructed using known concentrations of purified native STp (Calbiochem) ranging from 0 to 1.25 μg/ml. Double antibody sandwich ELISA was performed for determination of the amount of ClpG in supernatant samples. Microtiter plates (Immulon 2, Dynatech Laboratories Inc.) were coated by overnight incubation at 4 °C with 100 μl of rabbit anti-ClpG antiserum (28.Girardeau J.-P. Der Vartanian M. Ollier J.L. Contrepois M. Infect. Immun. 1988; 56: 2180-2188Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) diluted (1:200) in 50 mm carbonate buffer (pH 9.6). After removal of the buffer, the plates were incubated overnight at 4 °C with blocking buffer (PBS, 2% dry milk, and 1% fetal calf serum) and washed twice with PBS and 0.05% Tween 20 and once with PBS. The supernatant samples were serially plated in 2-fold dilutions (100 μl/well) in antibody buffer (PBS, 0.2% dry milk, and 0.5% fetal calf serum) and incubated for 2 h at 37 °C. For the standard curve, known concentrations of purified ClpG in PBS were serially plated in 2-fold dilutions in antibody buffer. Purification of native ClpG has been described elsewhere (28.Girardeau J.-P. Der Vartanian M. Ollier J.L. Contrepois M. Infect. Immun. 1988; 56: 2180-2188Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). After washing twice with PBS and 0.05% Tween 20 and once with PBS, 100 μl of a 1:500 dilution of mouse anti-ClpG antiserum were added to each well, and the plates were incubated for 1.5 h at 37 °C. After washing, 100 μl of a 1:1000 dilution of goat anti-mouse IgG were added, and the plates were incubated for 2 h at 37 °C. After washing, 100 μl of 2 nmH2O2 and 10 mg of 2,2′-azinobis(3-ethylbenzthiazoline-6-sulfonic acid) diammonium salt (Sigma) substrate in 100 ml of citrate/phosphate buffer (80 mm citric acid and 125 mmNa2HPO4) were added, and the plates were incubated for 20 min in the dark at room temperature. The absorbance at 405 nm was read on a Dynatech MR5000 reader. An overnight supernatant of E. coli DH5α (pDSPH524) served as a negative control. In terms of molecular mass, ClpG represents 93% of the hybrid protein. Therefore, 1 μg of ClpG in the fusion protein mixture is equivalent to ∼1.1 μg of ClpG-STh hybrid. Samples containing the hybrids were mixed with an equal volume of 2× Laemmli buffer without reducing agent, applied without boiling to a 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gel, and semidry-electrotransferred onto 0.2-μm nitrocellulose paper (Bio-Rad) as described by Towbin et al. (29.Towbin H. Staehelin T. Gordon J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 4350-4354Crossref PubMed Scopus (44923) Google Scholar). Blots were blocked and washed with 1% bovine serum albumin and 0.1% Tween 20 in Tris-buffered saline and incubated overnight with rabbit ClpG-specific antiserum or with a mixture of the STa-specific monoclonal antibodies 11C (30.Takeda T. Nair G.B. Suzuki K. Zhe H.X. Yokoo Y. De Mol P. Hemelhof W. Butzler J.P. Takeda Y. Shimonishi Y. Infect. Immun. 1993; 61: 289-294Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and 20C1 (31.Brandwein H. Deutsch A. Thompson M. Giannella R. Infect. Immun. 1985; 47: 242-246Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). For probing with anti-ClpG antibodies, filters were developed with horseradish peroxidase-labeled goat anti-rabbit secondary antibodies and with H2O2/α-chloronaphthol as a substrate. For probing with anti-STa antibodies, a 1:1000 dilution of biotinylated goat anti-mouse IgG (Sigma) in Tris-buffered saline and 0.05% Tween 20 was used as a secondary antibody. After incubation for 1 h and washing, membranes were again incubated for 30 min with a 1:100 dilution of horseradish peroxidase-conjugated streptavidin (250 μg/ml; Sigma) in Tris-buffered saline and 0.05% Tween 20 and developed with H2O2/α-chloronaphthol. The enterotoxin activity of supernatant fractions was examined in the suckling mouse assay as described previously (32.Giannella R.A. Infect. Immun. 1976; 14: 95-99Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Three-day-old Swiss OF1 suckling mice were separated from their mothers immediately before use and randomly divided into groups. A 0.1-ml aliquot of each sample was directly delivered to the stomachs of infant mice using flexible plastic tubing. Three hours later, the entire intestine from each mouse was removed and weighed, and the ratio of the gut weight to remaining carcass weight (G/C) was calculated. The mean G/C ratio and the S.E. of several separated assays were determined for each mouse batch. A G/C ratio of ≥0.090 corresponded to the unambiguous accumulation of fluid in the gut lumen. One mouse unit was defined as the enterotoxin activity corresponding to a minimum effective dose that gave a positive response (G/C ≥ 0.090), and the enterotoxin titer was expressed as the highest dilution that gave 1 mouse unit of enterotoxin activity. The G/C value was plotted semilogarithmically versus dilution of the sample fraction, and the point at which the curve crossed the line equal to a G/C ratio of 0.090 was defined as the dilution that corresponds to 1 mouse unit of STa. In our study, the minimum effective dose of STa necessary to produce an activity of 1 mouse unit was 8 ng, as determined using a standard curve, which was developed following intragastric inoculation of suckling mice with 0.1 ml of sterile PBS containing amounts of pure STp ranging from 0.2 to 100 ng (data not shown). The redox state of fusion proteins was assessed as described previously (33.Joly J.C. Swartz J.R. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 10067-10072Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). To determine the redox state of intracellular fusion proteins, bacteria were cultured in LB broth at 37 °C with or without 5 mmdithiothreitol (DTT). Cultures (25 ml) were grown toA 550 ∼ 0.5 and centrifuged. Cell pellets were suspended in PBS and mixed with an equal volume of 10% trichloroacetic acid in PBS, followed by incubation on ice for 1 h. For determination of the redox state of extracellular fusion proteins, supernatants were treated or not with 100 mm DTT for 10 min at 37 °C before trichloroacetic acid treatment as described above. In all cases, precipitates of trichloroacetic acid-denatured proteins were pelleted by centrifugation and washed with cold acetone to remove trace acid. The samples were centrifuged, and the acetone supernatants were discarded. The resulting pellets were air-dried and dissolved in a solution (freshly made) containing 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 1% SDS, 1 mm EDTA, and 10 mm4-acetamido-4′-maleimidylstilbene-2,2′-disulfonic acid (AMS; Molecular Probes, Inc.). Proteins were separated by 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis without using any reducing agent. Reduced and oxidized forms of proteins were visualized on Western blots as described above. AMS reacts specifically and irreversibly with sulfhydryl groups, conjugating a large 490-Da moiety to the free cysteines (34.Bader M. Muse W. Zander T. Bardwell J.C.A. J. Biol.

This major change in molecular mass is used to clearly separate oxidized from reduced proteins on SDS-polyacrylamide gels (33.Joly J.C. Swartz J.R. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 10067-10072Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Indeed, unlike oxidized forms, reduced forms, which are sensitive to reaction with AMS, shift to a high molecular mass protein position. Plasmids carrying variousclpG::STh fusion genes (Fig.1) were introduced into E. coli strains JCB570 (dsbA + dsbB +), JCB571 (dsbA −), JCB819 (dsbB −), and JCB818 (dsbA − dsbB −) (TableI). The transformants were grown overnight in LB broth or LB agar, and the supernatant fractions were analyzed for STh production by competitive ELISA and for STh activity by the suckling mouse assay. All STh chimeras were secreted with high biological activity in solid and liquid media by both thedsb + wild-type and dsb −mutant cells (Table II). The percentage of positive mice reached 100% for each of the recombinant plasmids tested in all mutant strains and in both solid and liquid media. Activity was 80–170-fold higher in liquid medium than in solid medium (data expressed in mouse units/1010 colony-forming units in Table II), probably because of a better air oxygenation. In comparison to the wild-type strain, the production and enterotoxicity levels of the dsb − mutants were mostly improved. Nevertheless, STh-specific activities (data expressed in mouse units/μg of STh in Table II) remained for the most part unchanged, indicating a similar DsbA/DsbB-independent toxicity against these various fusion proteins. This is in contrast with other reports showing that the dsbA mutation caused a marked reduction in the secretion (13.Yamanaka H. Nomura T. Fujii Y. Okamoto K. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 3383-3390Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and activity (12.Yamanaka H. Kameyama M. Baba T. Fujii Y. Okamoto K. J. Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 2906-2913Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) of the native toxin. Therefore, questions remained regarding whether our results might be accounted for by the presence of ClpG or by a periplasmic leakage due to the high-copy number of the recombinant plasmids.Table IISecretion and activity of extracellular STh chimerasSolid mediumLiquid mediumStrain/plasmidProductionaThe amount of STh hybrids in supernatants was estimated by a competitive ELISA from a standard curve as described under “Experimental Procedures.”EnterotoxicityEnterotoxicityng STh/1010 cfubcfu, colony-forming units; MU, mouse units (the activity corresponding to a minimum effective dose that gives a G/C ratio of 0.090); ND, not detectable in undiluted sample following ELISA; NT, not tested; NM, not measurable in ELISA because of a lack of affinity for anti-STa monoclonal antibodies.G/CcEach value represents the mean G/C ratio ± S.E. of a group of five suckling mice.
