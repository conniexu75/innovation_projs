https://openalex.org/W3029682964,"The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) presents a global health emergency that is in urgent need of intervention1–3. The entry of SARS-CoV-2 into its target cells depends on binding between the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the viral spike protein and its cellular receptor, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2)2,4–6. Here we report the isolation and characterization of 206 RBD-specific monoclonal antibodies derived from single B cells from 8 individuals infected with SARS-CoV-2. We identified antibodies that potently neutralize SARS-CoV-2; this activity correlates with competition with ACE2 for binding to RBD. Unexpectedly, the anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies and the infected plasma did not cross-react with the RBDs of SARS-CoV or Middle East respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus (MERS-CoV), although there was substantial plasma cross-reactivity to their trimeric spike proteins. Analysis of the crystal structure of RBD-bound antibody revealed that steric hindrance inhibits viral engagement with ACE2, thereby blocking viral entry. These findings suggest that anti-RBD antibodies are largely viral-species-specific inhibitors. The antibodies identified here may be candidates for development of clinical interventions against SARS-CoV-2. In a study of antibodies isolated from patients infected with SARS-CoV-2, antibodies that potently neutralized the virus competed with angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 for binding to the receptor-binding domain of the viral spike protein, suggesting that antibodies that disrupt this interaction could be developed to treat SARS-CoV-2 infection."
https://openalex.org/W3032255042,"An outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)1–3, caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)4, has spread globally. Countermeasures are needed to treat and prevent further dissemination of the virus. Here we report the isolation of two specific human monoclonal antibodies (termed CA1 and CB6) from a patient convalescing from COVID-19. CA1 and CB6 demonstrated potent SARS-CoV-2-specific neutralization activity in vitro. In addition, CB6 inhibited infection with SARS-CoV-2 in rhesus monkeys in both prophylactic and treatment settings. We also performed structural studies, which revealed that CB6 recognizes an epitope that overlaps with angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2)-binding sites in the SARS-CoV-2 receptor-binding domain, and thereby interferes with virus–receptor interactions by both steric hindrance and direct competition for interface residues. Our results suggest that CB6 deserves further study as a candidate for translation to the clinic. Two monoclonal antibodies isolated from a patient with COVID-19 are shown to interfere with SARS-CoV-2–receptor binding, and one displays potent action against this virus in vitro and in a rhesus macaque model."
https://openalex.org/W3026751717,"Diverse RNAs and RNA-binding proteins form phase-separated, membraneless granules in cells under stress conditions. However, the role of the prevalent mRNA methylation, m6A, and its binding proteins in stress granule (SG) assembly remain unclear. Here, we show that m6A-modified mRNAs are enriched in SGs, and that m6A-binding YTHDF proteins are critical for SG formation. Depletion of YTHDF1/3 inhibits SG formation and recruitment of mRNAs to SGs. Both the N-terminal intrinsically disordered region and the C-terminal m6A-binding YTH domain of YTHDF proteins are important for SG formation. Super-resolution imaging further reveals that YTHDF proteins appear to be in a super-saturated state, forming clusters that often reside in the periphery of or at the junctions between SG core clusters, and potentially promote SG formation by reducing the activation energy barrier and critical size for SG condensate formation. Our results suggest a new function of the m6A-binding YTHDF proteins in regulating SG formation."

https://openalex.org/W3031120515,"Background While response rates to anti-PD1 therapy are low in unselected metastatic castration resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) patients, those with inactivating mutations in mismatch repair (MMR) genes (i.e. MMR deficiency; MMRd) or microsatellite instability (MSI) are thought likely to respond favorably. To date, there is limited published data on this biologically distinct and clinically relevant subgroup’s natural history and response to treatment. Methods We retrospectively identified patients at two academic institutions who had MMRd/MSI-high metastatic prostate cancer (PC). Clinical and pathologic characteristics at the time of diagnosis as well as response to standard therapies and immune checkpoint therapy were abstracted. Descriptive statistics, including PSA50 response (≥50% decline in PSA from baseline) and clinical/radiographic progression free survival (PFS), are reported. Results 27 men with MMRd and/or MSI-high metastatic PC were identified. 13 (48%) men had M1 disease at diagnosis and 19 of 24 (79%) men that underwent prostate biopsy had a Gleason score ≥8. Median overall survival from time of metastasis was not reached (95% CI: 33.6-NR mos) after a median follow up of 33.6 mos (95% CI: 23.8–50.5 mos). Seventeen men received pembrolizumab, of which 15 had PSA response data available. PSA50 responses to pembrolizumab occurred in 8 (53%) men. Median PFS was not reached (95% CI: 1.87-NR mos) and the estimated PFS at 6 months was 64.1% (95% CI: 33.7%-83.4%). Of those who achieved a PSA50 response, 7 (87.5%) remain on treatment without evidence of progression at a median follow up of 12 months (range 3–20 months). Conclusions MMRd PC is associated with high Gleason score and advanced disease at presentation. Response rates to standard therapies are comparable to those reported in unselected patients and response rate to checkpoint blockade is high. Our study is limited by small sample size, and more research is needed to identify additional factors that may predict response to immunotherapy."
https://openalex.org/W3027373116,"The orphan nuclear receptor Nurr1 is critical for the development, maintenance and protection of midbrain dopaminergic (mDA) neurons. Here we show that prostaglandin E1 (PGE1) and its dehydrated metabolite, PGA1, directly interact with the ligand-binding domain (LBD) of Nurr1 and stimulate its transcriptional function. We also report the crystallographic structure of Nurr1-LBD bound to PGA1 at 2.05 Å resolution. PGA1 couples covalently to Nurr1-LBD by forming a Michael adduct with Cys566, and induces notable conformational changes, including a 21° shift of the activation function-2 helix (H12) away from the protein core. Furthermore, PGE1/PGA1 exhibit neuroprotective effects in a Nurr1-dependent manner, prominently enhance expression of Nurr1 target genes in mDA neurons and improve motor deficits in 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine-lesioned mouse models of Parkinson’s disease. Based on these results, we propose that PGE1/PGA1 represent native ligands of Nurr1 and can exert neuroprotective effects on mDA neurons, via activation of Nurr1’s transcriptional function. Prostaglandins PGE1 and PGA1 have neuroprotective effects by enhancing the transcriptional activity of Nurr1 by directly binding to its ligand-binding domain and upregulating their target genes implicated in Parkinson’s disease."
https://openalex.org/W3028528100,"With the exception of lamina-associated domains, the radial organization of chromatin in mammalian cells remains largely unexplored. Here we describe genomic loci positioning by sequencing (GPSeq), a genome-wide method for inferring distances to the nuclear lamina all along the nuclear radius. GPSeq relies on gradual restriction digestion of chromatin from the nuclear lamina toward the nucleus center, followed by sequencing of the generated cut sites. Using GPSeq, we mapped the radial organization of the human genome at 100-kb resolution, which revealed radial patterns of genomic and epigenomic features and gene expression, as well as A and B subcompartments. By combining radial information with chromosome contact frequencies measured by Hi-C, we substantially improved the accuracy of whole-genome structure modeling. Finally, we charted the radial topography of DNA double-strand breaks, germline variants and cancer mutations and found that they have distinctive radial arrangements in A and B subcompartments. We conclude that GPSeq can reveal fundamental aspects of genome architecture."
https://openalex.org/W3030756311,"Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) remains one of the most challenging malignancies. Desmoplasia and tumor-supporting inflammation are hallmarks of PDAC. The tumor microenvironment contributes significantly to tumor progression and spread. Cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) facilitate therapy resistance and metastasis. Recent reports emphasized the concurrence of multiple subtypes of CAFs with diverse roles, fibrogenic, and secretory. C-X-C motif chemokine receptor 2 (CXCR2) is a chemokine receptor known for its role during inflammation and its adverse role in PDAC. Oncogenic Kras upregulates CXCR2 and its ligands and, thus, contribute to tumor proliferation and immunosuppression. CXCR2 deletion in a PDAC syngeneic mouse model produced increased fibrosis revealing a potential undescribed role of CXCR2 in CAFs. In this study, we demonstrate that the oncogenic Kras-CXCR2 axis regulates the CAFs function in PDAC and contributes to CAFs heterogeneity. We observed that oncogenic Kras and CXCR2 signaling alter CAFs, producing a secretory CAF phenotype with low fibrogenic features; and increased secretion of pro-tumor cytokines and CXCR2 ligands, utilizing the NF-κB activity. Finally, using syngeneic mouse models, we demonstrate that oncogenic Kras is associated with secretory CAFs and that CXCR2 inhibition promotes activation of fibrotic cells (myofibroblasts) and impact tumors in a mutation-dependent manner."
https://openalex.org/W3026658163,"Understanding how assemblages are structured in space and the factors promoting their distributions is one of the main goals in Ecology, however, studies regarding the distribution of organisms at larger scales remain biased towards terrestrial groups. We attempt to understand if the structure of stream fish metacommunities across a Neotropical ecoregion (Upper Paraná-drainage area of 820,000 km2) are affected by environmental variables, describing natural environmental gradient, anthropogenic impacts and spatial predictors. For this, we obtained 586 sampling points of fish assemblages in the ecoregion and data on environmental and spatial predictors that potentially affect fish assemblages. We calculated the local beta diversity (Local Contribution to Beta Diversity, LCBD) and alpha diversity from the species list, to be used as response variables in the partial regression models, while the anthropogenic impacts, environmental gradient and spatial factors were used as predictors. We found a high total beta diversity for the ecoregion (0.41) where the greatest values for each site sampled were located at the edges of the ecoregion, while richer communities were found more centrally. All sets of predictors explained the LCBD and alpha diversity, but the most important was dispersal variables, followed by the natural environmental gradient and anthropogenic impact. However, we found an increase in the models' prediction power through the shared effect. Results suggest that environmental filters (i.e. environmental variables such as climate, hydrology and anthropogenic impact) and dispersal limitation together shape fish assemblages of the Upper Paraná ecoregion, showing the importance of using multiple sets of predictors to understand the processes structuring biodiversity distribution."
https://openalex.org/W3027964008,"Several studies have investigated the use of invasive and non-invasive stimulation methods to enhance nerve regeneration, and varying degrees of effectiveness have been reported. However, due to the use of different parameters in these studies, a fair comparison between the effectiveness of invasive and non-invasive stimulation methods is not possible. The present study compared the effectiveness of invasive and non-invasive stimulation using similar parameters. Eighteen Sprague Dawley rats were classified into three groups: the iES group stimulated with fully implantable device, the tES group stimulated with transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS), and the injury group (no stimulation). The iES and tES groups received stimulation for 6 weeks starting immediately after the injury. Motor function was evaluated using the sciatic functional index (SFI) every week. The SFI values increased over time in all groups; faster and superior functional recovery was observed in the iES group than in the tES group. Histological evaluation of the nerve sections and gastrocnemius muscle sections were performed every other week. The axon diameter and muscle fiber area in the iES group were larger, and the g-ratio in the iES group was closer to 0.6 than those in the tES group. To assess the cause of the difference in efficiency, a 3D rat anatomical model was used to simulate the induced electric fields in each group. A significantly higher concentration and intensity around the sciatic nerve was observed in the iES group than in the tES group. Vector field distribution showed that the field was orthogonal to the sciatic nerve spread in the tES group, whereas it was parallel in the iES group; this suggested that the tES group was less effective in nerve stimulation. The results indicated that even though rats in the TENS group showed better recovery than those in the injury group, it cannot replace direct stimulation yet because rats stimulated with the invasive method showed faster recovery and superior outcomes. This was likely attributable to the greater concentration and parallel distribution of electric field with respect to target nerve."
https://openalex.org/W3029609280,"A high diversity of fungi was discovered on various substrates collected at the marine shallow-water Kueishan Island Hydrothermal Vent Field, Taiwan, using culture and metabarcoding methods but whether these fungi can grow and play an active role in such an extreme environment is unknown. We investigated the combined effects of different salinity, temperature and pH on growth of ten fungi (in the genera Aspergillus, Penicillium, Fodinomyces, Microascus, Trichoderma, Verticillium) isolated from the sediment and the vent crab Xenograpsus testudinatus. The growth responses of the tested fungi could be referred to three groups: (1) wide pH, salinity and temperature ranges, (2) salinity-dependent and temperature-sensitive, and (3) temperature-tolerant. Aspergillus terreus NTOU4989 was the only fungus which showed growth at 45 °C, pH 3 and 30 ‰ salinity, and might be active near the vents. We also carried out a transcriptome analysis to understand the molecular adaptations of A. terreus NTOU4989 under these extreme conditions. Data revealed that stress-related genes were differentially expressed at high temperature (45 °C); for instance, mannitol biosynthetic genes were up-regulated while glutathione S-transferase and amino acid oxidase genes down-regulated in response to high temperature. On the other hand, hydrogen ion transmembrane transport genes and phenylalanine ammonia lyase were up-regulated while pH-response transcription factor was down-regulated at pH 3, a relative acidic environment. However, genes related to salt tolerance, such as glycerol lipid metabolism and mitogen-activated protein kinase, were up-regulated in both conditions, possibly related to maintaining water homeostasis. The results of this study revealed the genetic evidence of adaptation in A. terreus NTOU4989 to changes of environmental conditions."
https://openalex.org/W3030737765,"Bangladesh exhibits the second highest rate of smokeless tobacco (SLT) product usage in the world, and this has been associated with the high upper aerodigestive tract cancer incidence in this country. The goal of the present study was to examine the levels of the highly carcinogenic tobacco-specific nitrosamines (TSNAs) in Bangladeshi SLT products and compare these levels to that observed in SLT brands from southeast Asia and the USA. The levels of TSNAs and nicotine were determined by LC-MS/MS in twenty-eight SLT brands and several tobacco additives from Bangladesh, as well as several SLT brands from India, Pakistan and the USA. The levels of N-nitrosonornicotine (NNN), 4-(methylnitrosamino)-1-(3-pyridyl)-1-butanone (NNK), N-nitrosoanatabine (NAT) and N-nitrosoanabasine (NAB) in Bangladeshi SLT brands ranged from 1.1–59, 0.15–34, 0.79–45, and 0.037–13 μg/g SLT powder, respectively. The mean levels of the highly carcinogenic TSNAs (NNN+NNK) were 7.4-, 2.4-, and 63-fold higher in Bangladeshi SLT products as compared to SLT brands from the USA, India and Pakistan, respectively; these trends were also observed for NAT and NAB. Similar mean levels of nicotine were observed in the Bangladeshi brands (31 mg/g powder) versus brands from the USA (25 mg/g powder) and India (20 mg/g powder); they were 3-fold higher than brands from Pakistan (10 mg/g powder). Gul SLT brands exhibited the highest pH and the highest levels of unprotonated nicotine. The high levels of TSNAs in Bangladeshi SLT brands may be an important factor contributing to the high rates of upper aerodigestive tract cancer in Bangladesh."
https://openalex.org/W3031192530,"Objective This study aimed to characterise antibiotics resistance of Escherichia coli isolates from the formal meat sector (FMS) and informal meat sectors (INMS). Method A total of 162 and 102 E. coli isolates from the FMS, and INMS respectively were isolated by standard culture-based, and biochemical reactions. The isolates were further confirmed by polymerase chain reaction (PCR). The disc diffusion method was used to screen for antimicrobial susceptibility against 19 different antibiotics. The presence of class 1–2 integrons in each E. coli isolates was assessed using 3′-CS and 5′-CS regions specific primers. Result Among the 19 antimicrobials, resistance to tetracyclines, aminoglycosides, cephalosporins, and nitrofurans were found to be more frequent than carbapenems and chloramphenicol. The number of multi-drug resistance ranged from three to ten antimicrobials. The resistant determinants with the highest prevalence in the FMS and INMS were; [aminoglycosides: aadA (40.6%; 31.9%), and strA (6.5%; 9.4%)], [β-lactams: ampC (20%; 45%),], [Chloramphenicol: catI (1.7%; 1.7%), and [tetracyclines: tetB (11.5%; 24%),], and [sulfonamides: sul1 (22.2%; 26.7%),]. Conclusion Higher phenotypic resistance to cephalosporins and carbapenems were found in the FMS than in INMS. The multiple antibiotic resistance (MAR) indexes for FMS and INMS ranged from 0.2–0.5. The results reveal a high prevalence of multidrug-resistant E. coli isolates and resistance determinants, suggesting that consumers and handlers of such meat are at risk of contracting antibiotic-resistant E. coli-related foodborne disease."
https://openalex.org/W3032864678,"In humans, cobalamin or vitamin B12 is delivered to two target enzymes via a complex intracellular trafficking pathway comprising transporters and chaperones. CblC (or MMACHC) is a processing chaperone that catalyzes an early step in this trafficking pathway. CblC removes the upper axial ligand of cobalamin derivatives, forming an intermediate in the pathway that is subsequently converted to the active cofactor derivatives. Mutations in the cblC gene lead to methylmalonic aciduria and homocystinuria. Here, we report that nitrosylcobalamin (NOCbl), which was developed as an antiproliferative reagent, and is purported to cause cell death by virtue of releasing nitric oxide, is highly unstable in air and is rapidly oxidized to nitrocobalamin (NO2Cbl). We demonstrate that CblC catalyzes the GSH-dependent denitration of NO2Cbl forming 5-coordinate cob(II)alamin, which had one of two fates. It could be oxidized to aquo-cob(III)alamin or enter a futile thiol oxidase cycle forming GSH disulfide. Arg-161 in the active site of CblC suppressed the NO2Cbl-dependent thiol oxidase activity, whereas the disease-associated R161G variant stabilized cob(II)alamin and promoted futile cycling. We also report that CblC exhibits nitrite reductase activity, converting cob(I)alamin and nitrite to NOCbl. Finally, the denitration activity of CblC supported cell proliferation in the presence of NO2Cbl, which can serve as a cobalamin source. The newly described nitrite reductase and denitration activities of CblC extend its catalytic versatility, adding to its known decyanation and dealkylation activities. In summary, upon exposure to air, NOCbl is rapidly converted to NO2Cbl, which is a substrate for the B12 trafficking enzyme CblC."
https://openalex.org/W3027782010,"The fundamental and assorted roles of β-1,3-glucans in nature are underpinned on diverse chemistry and molecular structures, demanding sophisticated and intricate enzymatic systems for their processing. In this work, the selectivity and modes of action of a glycoside hydrolase family active on β-1,3-glucans were systematically investigated combining sequence similarity network, phylogeny, X-ray crystallography, enzyme kinetics, mutagenesis and molecular dynamics. This family exhibits a minimalist and versatile (α/β)-barrel scaffold, which can harbor distinguishing exo or endo modes of action, including an ancillary-binding site for the anchoring of triple-helical β-1,3-glucans. The substrate binding occurs via a hydrophobic knuckle complementary to the canonical curved conformation of β-1,3-glucans or through a substrate conformational change imposed by the active-site topology of some fungal enzymes. Together, these findings expand our understanding of the enzymatic arsenal of bacteria and fungi for the breakdown and modification of β-1,3-glucans, which can be exploited for biotechnological applications. Comprehensive informatic, structural and biochemical characterization of the GH128 family defines subgroups of glycoside hydrolase enzymes with unique recognition and cleavage mechanisms for 1,3-beta-glucan polysaccharide substrates."
https://openalex.org/W3030163968,"Background Postoperative depression is one of the most common mental disorders in patients undergoing cancer surgery and it often delays postoperative recovery. We investigated whether dezocine, an analgesic with inhibitory effect on the serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake, could relieve postoperative depressive symptoms in patients undergoing colorectal cancer surgery. Methods This randomized, controlled, single-center, double-blind trial was performed in the Second Affiliated Hospital of the Army Medical University. A total of 120 patients were randomly assigned to receive either sufentanil (1.3 μg/kg) with dezocine (1 mg/kg) (dezocine group; n = 60) or only sufentanil (2.3 μg/kg) (control group; n = 60) for patient-controlled intravenous analgesia after colorectal cancer surgery. The primary outcome was the Beck Depression Inventory score at 2 days after surgery. The secondary outcomes included the Beck Anxiety Inventory, sleep quality, and quality of recovery scores. Results Compared with those in the control group, patients in the dezocine group had lower depression scores (7.3±3.4 vs. 9.9±3.5, mean difference 2.6, 95% CI: 1.4−3.9; P<0.001) at 2 days after surgery and better night sleep quality at the day of surgery (P = 0.010) and at 1 day after the surgery (P<0.001). No significant difference was found in other outcomes between the two groups. Conclusions Intravenous analgesia using dezocine can relieve postoperative depression symptoms and improve sleep quality in patients undergoing colorectal cancer surgery."
https://openalex.org/W3030755118,"The lens and central cornea are avascular. It was assumed that the adult lens had no source of immune cells and that the basement membrane capsule surrounding the lens was a barrier to immune cell migration. Yet, microfibril-associated protein-1 (MAGP1)-rich ciliary zonules that originate from the vasculature-rich ciliary body and extend along the surface of the lens capsule, form a potential conduit for immune cells to the lens. In response to cornea debridement wounding, we find increased expression of MAGP1 throughout the central corneal stroma. The immune cells that populate this typically avascular region after wounding closely associate with this MAGP1-rich matrix. These results suggest that MAGP1-rich microfibrils support immune cell migration post-injury. Using this cornea wound model, we investigated whether there is an immune response to the lens following cornea injury involving the lens-associated MAGP1-rich ciliary zonules. Our results provide the first evidence that following corneal wounding immune cells are activated to travel along zonule fibers that extend anteriorly along the equatorial surface of the lens, from where they migrate across the anterior lens capsule. These results demonstrate that lens-associated ciliary zonules are directly involved in the lens immune response and suggest the ciliary body as a source of immune cells to the avascular lens."
https://openalex.org/W3032069612,"In the U.S., approximately 1.7 million people suffer traumatic brain injury each year, with many enduring long-term consequences and significant medical and rehabilitation costs. The primary injury causes physical damage to neurons, glia, fiber tracts and microvasculature, which is then followed by secondary injury, consisting of pathophysiological mechanisms including an immune response, inflammation, edema, excitotoxicity, oxidative damage, and cell death. Most attempts at intervention focus on protection, repair or regeneration, with regenerative medicine becoming an intensively studied area over the past decade. The use of stem cells has been studied in many disease and injury models, using stem cells from a variety of sources and applications. In this study, human adipose-derived mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) were administered at early (3 days) and delayed (14 days) time points after controlled cortical impact (CCI) injury in rats. Animals were routinely assessed for neurological and vestibulomotor deficits, and at 32 days post-injury, brain tissue was processed by flow cytometry and immunohistochemistry to analyze neuroinflammation. Treatment with HB-adMSC at either 3d or 14d after injury resulted in significant improvements in neurocognitive outcome and a change in neuroinflammation one month after injury."
https://openalex.org/W3031249969,"Young female soccer players are at high risk of anterior cruciate ligament injury due to the fast-paced nature of the sport and surplus of unplanned movements during play. Neuromuscular training programs that aim to reduce this injury by targeting the associated biomechanical movements are a potential solution. While previous studies have examined the lack of dynamic knee control during landing, there are few that outline the role that maturation can play during unanticipated cutting. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to determine if young female soccer players across multiple phases of maturation exhibited the before seen differences in knee control during a drop landing as well as an unanticipated cutting task. 139 female soccer players volunteered to participate in this study and were classified in three maturational groups based on percent adult stature: prepubertal (PRE), pubertal (PUB), and post-pubertal (POST). Each group performed a drop vertical jump (DVJ) and an unanticipated cutting task (CUT). Standard 3D motion capture techniques were used to determine peak knee flexion/abduction angles and moments during each task. Within tasks, POST exhibited significantly greater peak abduction angles and moments compared to PUB/PRE. While each maturational group exhibited greater peak knee abduction angles during the DVJ compared to the CUT, peak knee abduction moments during the CUT were greater compared to the DVJ. Participants within each maturational group exhibited greater knee flexion during the DVJ compared to the CUT, however there were no differences identified between groups. During both tasks, POST/PUB exhibited greater peak knee flexion moments compared to PRE, as well as POST compared to PUB. Overall, each group exhibited significantly greater peak knee flexion moments during the CUT compared to the DVJ. These observed differences indicate the need for neuromuscular training programs that target both jumping and cutting techniques to reduce ACL injuries."
https://openalex.org/W3029743051,"The foot-and-mouth disease is an ever-present hazard to the livestock industry due to the huge economic consequences following an outbreak that necessitates culling of possibly infected animals in vast numbers. The disease is highly contagious and previous epizootics have shown that it spreads by many routes. One such route is airborne transmission, which has been investigated in this study by means of a detailed multilevel model that includes all scales of an outbreak. Local spread within an infected farm is described by a stochastic compartment model while the spread between farms is quantified by atmospheric dispersion simulations using a network representation of the set of farms. The model was applied to the Swedish livestock industry and the risk for an epizootic outbreak in Sweden was estimated using the basic reproduction number of each individual livestock-holding farm as the endpoint metric. The study was based on comprehensive official data sets for both the current livestock holdings and regional meteorological conditions. Three species of farm animals are susceptible to the disease and are present in large numbers: cattle, pigs and sheep. These species are all included in this study using their individual responses and consequences to the disease. It was concluded that some parts of southern Sweden are indeed preconditioned to harbor an airborne epizootic, while the sparse farm population of the north renders such events unlikely to occur there. The distribution of the basic reproduction number spans over several orders of magnitudes with low risk of disease spread from the majority of the farms while some farms may act as very strong disease transmitters. The results may serve as basic data in the planning of the national preparedness for this type of events."
https://openalex.org/W3031086581,"Glyoxalase pathway is the major pathway of methylglyoxal detoxification and is ubiquitously present in all organisms ranging from prokaryotes to eukaryotes. Glyoxalase I (GLYI) and Glyoxalase II (GLYII), the two core enzymes of this pathway work together to neutralize methylglyoxal (MG), a dicarbonyl molecule with detrimental cytotoxicity at higher concentrations. The first step towards the detoxification of MG is catalyzed by GLYI, a metalloenzyme that requires divalent metal ions (either Zn2+ as seen in eukaryotes or Ni2+ as in prokaryotes). However, both Zn2+ and Ni2+ dependent GLYIs have been shown to co-exist in a higher eukaryote i.e. Arabidopsis thaliana. In the present study, we determine the role of both Zn2+ dependent (AtGLYI2) and Ni2+ dependent (AtGLYI3, AtGLYI6) GLYIs from Arabidopsis in salinity stress tolerance. AtGLYI2 overexpressing Arabidopsis plants showed better growth rate while maintaining lower levels of MG under high saline conditions. They were taller with more number of silique formation with respect to their Ni2+ dependent counterparts. Further, lack in germination of Arabidopsis AtGLYI2 mutants in presence of exogenous MG indicates the direct involvement of Zn2+ dependent GLYI in MG detoxification, suggesting Zn2+ dependent GLYI as the main enzyme responsible for MG detoxification and salinity stress tolerance."
https://openalex.org/W3031136751,"Mice deficient in the transcription factor Runx3 develop a multitude of immune system defects, including early onset colitis. This paper demonstrates that Runx3 is expressed in colonic mononuclear phagocytes (MNP), including resident macrophages (RM) and dendritic cell subsets (cDC2). Runx3 deletion in MNP causes early onset colitis due to their impaired maturation. Mechanistically, the resulting MNP subset imbalance leads to up-regulation of pro-inflammatory genes as occurs in IL10R-deficient RM. In addition, RM and cDC2 display a marked decrease in expression of anti-inflammatory/TGF β-regulated genes and β-catenin signaling associated genes, respectively. MNP transcriptome and ChIP-seq data analysis suggest that a significant fraction of genes affected by Runx3 loss are direct Runx3 targets. Collectively, Runx3 imposes intestinal immune tolerance by regulating maturation of colonic anti-inflammatory MNP, befitting the identification of RUNX3 as a genome-wide associated risk gene for various immune-related diseases in humans, including gastrointestinal tract diseases such as Crohn’s disease and celiac."
https://openalex.org/W3031533588,"For (metabolic) research models using mice, singly housing is widely used for practical purposes to study e.g. energy balance regulation and derangements herein. Mouse (social) housing practices could however influence study results by modulating (metabolic) health outcomes. To study the effects of the social housing condition, we assessed parameters for energy balance regulation and proneness to (diet induced) obesity in male C57Bl/6J mice that were housed individually or socially (in pairs) directly after weaning, both at standard ambient temperature of 21°C. During adolescence, individually housed mice had reduced growth rate, while energy intake and energy expenditure were increased compared to socially housed counterparts. At 6 weeks of age, these mice had reduced lean body mass, but significantly higher white adipose tissue mass compared to socially housed mice, and higher UCP-1 mRNA expression in brown adipose tissue. During adulthood, body weight gain of individually housed animals exceeded that of socially housed mice, with elevations in both energy intake and expenditure. At 18 weeks of age, individually housed mice showed higher adiposity and higher mRNA expression of UCP-1 in inguinal white but not in brown adipose tissue. Exposure to an obesogenic diet starting at 6 weeks of age further amplified body weight gain and adipose tissue deposition and caused strong suppression of inguinal white adipose tissue mRNA UCP-1 expression. This study shows that post-weaning individual housing of male mice impairs adolescent growth and results in higher susceptibility to obesity in adulthood with putative roles for thermoregulation and/or affectiveness."

Methods Secondary analysis of data from the Outcome and Assessment Information Set [OASIS] and billing records in a non-profit HH agency in New York. Participants were adults ≥ 65 years old who received HH in CY 2017 with OASIS records at HH admission and HH discharge. Dementia was identified by diagnosis (ICD-10 codes) and cognitive impairment (OASIS: M1700, M1710, M1740). We used OASIS records to assess race/ethnicity (M0140) and functional status (M1800-M1870 on activities of daily living [ADL]). Functional outcome was measured as change in the composite ADL score from HH admission to HH discharge, where a negative score means improvement and a positive score means decline. Results The sample included 4,783 patients, among whom 93.9% improved in ADLs at HH discharge. In multivariable linear regression that adjusted for HH service use and covariates (R2 = 0.23), being African American (β = 0.21, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.06, 0.35, p = 0.005) and having dementia (β = 0.51, 95% CI: 0.41, 0.62, p<0.001) were independently related to less ADL improvement at HH discharge, with significant interaction related to further decrease in ADL improvement. Relative to white patients without dementia, African American patients with dementia (β = 1.08, 95% CI: 0.81, 1.35, p<0.001), Hispanics with dementia (β = 0.92, 95% CI: 0.38, 1.47, p = 0.001) and Asian Americans with dementia (β = 1.47, 95% CI: 0.81, 2.13, p<0.001) showed the least ADL improvement at HH discharge. Conclusion Racial/ethnic minority status and dementia were associated with less ADL improvement in HH with independent and interactive effects. Policies should ensure that these patients have equitable access to appropriate, adequate community-based services to meet their needs in ADLs and disease management for improved outcomes."

Annually, Saudi Arabia imports thousands of camels from the Horn of Africa, yet the epidemiology of MERS-CoV in these animals is largely unknown. Here, MERS-CoV prevalence was compared in imported African camels and their local counterparts. A total of 1399 paired sera and nasal swabs were collected from camels between 2016 and 2018. Imported animals from Sudan (n = 829) and Djibouti (n = 328) were sampled on incoming ships at Jeddah Islamic seaport before unloading, and local camels were sampled from Jeddah (n = 242). Samples were screened for neutralizing antibodies (nAbs) and MERS-CoV viral RNA. The overall seroprevalence was 92.7% and RNA detection rate was 17.2%. Imported camels had higher seroprevalence compared to resident herds (93.8% vs 87.6%, p <0.01) in contrast to RNA detection (13.3% vs 35.5%, p <0.0001). Seroprevalence significantly increased with age (p<0.0001) and viral RNA detection rate was ~2-folds higher in camels <2-year-old compared to older animals. RNA detection was higher in males verses females (24.3% vs 12.6%, p<0.0001) but seroprevalence was similar. Concurrent positivity for viral RNA and nAbs was found in >87% of the RNA positive animals, increased with age and was sex-dependent. Importantly, reduced viral RNA load was positively correlated with nAb titers. Our data confirm the widespread of MERS-CoV in imported and domestic camels in Saudi Arabia and highlight the need for continuous active surveillance and better prevention measures. Further studies are also warranted to understand camels correlates of protection for proper vaccine development."

They govern cell-fate decisions during embryonic development and are often deregulated in human pathologies. Chd1-8 show upon germline disruption pronounced, often developmental lethal phenotypes. Here we show that contrary to Chd1-8 disruption, Chd9–/–animals are viable, fertile and display no developmental defects or disease predisposition. Germline deletion of Chd9 only moderately affects gene expression in tissues and derived cells, whereas acute depletion in human cancer cells elicits more robust changes suggesting that CHD9 is a highly context-dependent chromatin regulator that, surprisingly, is dispensable for mouse development."
https://openalex.org/W3029338250,"In Ethiopia, although nutrition education has been given during pregnancy, most women have inadequate nutrient intakes. As a result, the prevalence of malnutrition is high during pregnancy. In this study, we set out to evaluate the effect of guided counseling based on the health belief model and the theory of planned behavior on the dietary practices of pregnant women.A two-arm parallel cluster randomized controlled community trial was carried out among pregnant women in West, Gojjam Zone, Ethiopia from May 1, 2018, to April 30, 2019. A total of 346 and 348 pregnant women were recruited from the intervention and control clusters, respectively. Of which endline data were collected from 313 and 332 pregnant women in the intervention and control groups, respectively. Each woman in the intervention group attended four counseling sessions. Women in the control group attended the routine nutrition education given by the health care system. Data were collected using a structured questionnaire. McNemar test and Generalized Estimating Equations were used to evaluate the intervention effect.The average difference of appropriate dietary practice between the two groups was 30.7%. After controlling for the possible confounders, women in the intervention group had 7.2 times [AOR = 7.187, 95% CI: (4.49, 11.49)] higher odds of having appropriate dietary practices compared with the control group. Dietary diversity and meal frequency of counseled women were 7 [AOR = 6.994, 95% CI: (4.59, 10.66)] and 8 [AOR = 8.146, 95% CI: (5.377, 12.341)] times higher than dietary diversity and meal frequency of women in the control group, respectively.Counseling based on the health belief model and the theory of planned behavior is an effective approach in increasing the proportion of women who had appropriate dietary practices. Thus, these findings suggest the need for employing trimester based counseling using the HBM and the TPB to improve the dietary practices of pregnant women.The trial was registered in Clinical Trials.gov (NCT03627156)."

Equine herpesvirus 1 is considered a primary cause of infectious abortion in horses, however other infectious agents can also cause abortion. Abortions due to zoonotic pathogens have implications for both human and animal health. We determined the prevalence of Coxiella burnetii, Leptospira spp. and Toxoplasma gondii in 600 aborted equine foetal tissues that were submitted to our diagnostic laboratories at the University of Melbourne from 1994 to 2019. Using qPCR we found that the prevalence of C. burnetii was 4%. The highest annual incidence of C. burnetii was observed between 1997–2003 and 2016–2018. The prevalence of C. burnetii in Victoria and New South Wales was 3% and 6% respectively. All the samples tested negative for Leptospira spp. and Toxoplasma gondii DNA. Equine herpesvirus 1 DNA was detected at a prevalence of 3%. This study has provided evidence for the presence of C. burnetii in equine aborted foetal tissues in Australia, but the role of C. burnetii as potential cause of abortion in Australia requires further investigation. C. burnetii is a zoonotic disease agent that causes the disease ‘Q fever’ in humans. We recommend that appropriate protective measures should be considered when handling material associated with equine abortions to reduce the risk of becoming infected with C. burnetii."
https://openalex.org/W3032841096,"Patients who doctor shop for opioids are a vulnerable population that present a difficult dilemma for their health care providers regarding best methods of immediate treatment and how to manage their risk of harm from opioids. We aim to describe and compare opioid prescription patterns among high quantity prescription patients who doctor shopped, high quantity prescription patients who did not (doctor shopping eligible patients), and the remaining patients who received opioid prescriptions to guide population health policies for high risk opioid use patients.We performed a cross-sectional descriptive analysis of opioid prescriptions during an 8-year period using California's de-identified Controlled Substance Utilization Review and Evaluation System (CURES) database from years 2008-2015. We identified the prevalence of patients who doctor shopped and depicted their opioid prescription patterns including prescriber characteristics, in comparison to the aforementioned groups. Doctor shopping was defined by patients who received greater than 6 or more prescriptions from at least 6 different prescribers within 6 months of time.Among the 3 million individuals who received an opioid prescription during the 8-year period, 1.3% met the doctor shopper definition. These patients received high levels of chronic opioids with 82% and 33% averaging greater than 20 and 100 morphine milligram equivalents (MME) daily, respectively, in comparison to 72% and 18% in the doctor shopping eligible group. Patients who doctor shopped received a significant proportion of their MME from 1 main prescriber (54%) and only received 2-5% of their total MME from episodic care providers, despite 88% receiving a prescription from these providers.Patients who doctor shop are at high risk of opioid use disorder but represent a small fraction of those with dangerous opioid use. Furthermore, these individuals do not receive substantial opioids from episodic providers, which challenges the utility of prescription reduction programs in curbing use among this population. These results suggest we re-evaluate physician roles in the care of these patients and focus on referral to treatment and harm reduction strategies."
https://openalex.org/W3030469831,"While biodiversity hotspots are typically identified on the basis of species number per unit area, their exceptional richness is often attributed, either implicitly or explicitly, to high diversification rates. High species concentrations, however, need not reflect rapid diversification, with the diversity of some hotspots accumulating at modest rates over long timespans. Here we explore the relationship between diversification in time vs. diversification in space and develop the concept of diversification density to describe the spatial scale of species accumulation in a clade. We investigate how plant height is associated with both aspects of diversification in Alooideae, a large plant subfamily with its center of diversity in the Greater Cape Floristic Region. We first reconstruct a time-calibrated phylogeny for Alooideae and demonstrate an evolutionary tendency towards reduced plant height. While plant height does not correlate with diversification rate across Alooideae it does so with diversification per unit space: clades of small plants tend to have the highest diversification densities. Furthermore, we find that diversification in time vs. space are uncorrelated. Our results show that diversification rate and density can be decoupled, and suggest that while some biodiversity hotspots might have been generated by high diversification rates, others are the product of high diversification density."
https://openalex.org/W3032643323,"One of the most pressing problems of enterococci infections is occurring resistance to linezolid, which is an antibiotic used in the treatment of infections caused by vancomycin-resistant strains (VRE). The main objective of our research was to investigate the relationship of 19 linezolid-resistant E. faecium isolates from 18 patients hospitalized at Clinical Hospital in Gdansk (Poland). One of the LZDREF was isolated in 2003 (K2003), and another 18 were collected from 2013 to 2017. Genotyping with PCR MP method indicated 14 main unrelated genetic profiles and no association with K2003 strain. Two isolates with the same genotype and genetically closely related two sub-types (2 isolates for each sub-type) were hospital-derived colonizations of patients. The other unrelated genotypes were discussed in the context of colonization, nosocomial infections, and commensal origin, taking into account prior exposure to linezolid. We determined the presence of a point mutation G2576T in six loci of 23S rDNA. There was also a significant correlation (p<0.0015) between the presence of MIC>32 value and the presence of G2576T point mutation on the sixth rrn. We also detected 5 virulence genes for all isolates: gelE, cylA, asa1, hyl, esp. Correlation (p≤0.0001) was observed between the presence of gelE gene encoding gelatinase and two other genes: cylA and asa1 encoding cytolysin and collagen binding protein responsible for aggregation of bacterial cells, respectively. Significant correlation was also observed between asa1 and cfr genes encoding 23S rRNA rybonuclease responsible for resistance to PhLOPSA antibiotics (p = 0.0004). The multidimensional analysis has also shown the correlation between cfr gene and GI-tract (p = 0, 0491), which suggests horizontal gene transfer inside the gut microbiota and the risk of colonization with linezolid-resistant strains without previously being treated with the antibiotic. The patient could have been colonized with LZDRVREF strains which in the absence of competitive microbiota quickly settle in ecological niches favourable for them and pose a risk for the patient."
https://openalex.org/W3031257308,"Poly(A)-specific ribonuclease (PARN) is a 3′-exoribonuclease that plays an important role in regulating the stability and maturation of RNAs. Recently, PARN has been found to regulate the maturation of the human telomerase RNA component (hTR), a noncoding RNA required for telomere elongation. Specifically, PARN cleaves the 3′-end of immature, polyadenylated hTR to form the mature, nonpolyadenylated template. Despite PARN's critical role in mediating telomere maintenance, little is known about how PARN's function is regulated by post-translational modifications. In this study, using shRNA- and CRISPR/Cas9-mediated gene silencing and knockout approaches, along with 3′-exoribonuclease activity assays and additional biochemical methods, we examined whether PARN is post-translationally modified by acetylation and what effect acetylation has on PARN's activity. We found PARN is primarily acetylated by the acetyltransferase p300 at Lys-566 and deacetylated by sirtuin1 (SIRT1). We also revealed how acetylation of PARN can decrease its enzymatic activity both in vitro, using a synthetic RNA probe, and in vivo, by quantifying endogenous levels of adenylated hTR. Furthermore, we also found that SIRT1 can regulate levels of adenylated hTR through PARN. The findings of our study uncover a mechanism by which PARN acetylation and deacetylation regulate its enzymatic activity as well as levels of mature hTR. Thus, PARN's acetylation status may play a role in regulating telomere length."
https://openalex.org/W3026124151,"New urbanization is the fundamental approach to achieve the healthy, stable, and sustainable development of the Chinese economic society. It is also the basic outlet to eliminate the “dual economic structure” in urban and rural areas. Based on the connotation of new urbanization, we constructed an evaluation system using population development, economic development, quality of life, infrastructure, resources and environment, and urban and rural harmonious development. The entropy and weighted summation methods were used to measure the level of new urbanization for 11 provincial capital cities from 2005 to 2018, and policy implications were analyzed correspondingly. The results show that there are significant differences in the development levels of new urbanization in these cities, with infrastructure construction being the primary driver. These developments have placed the economy and environment under great pressure. The quality of urban life and the level of infrastructure construction need to be improved because of the expanding economic gap between urban and rural areas. These cities with poor internal coordination also have apparent differences amongst individual factors. Overall, the policies on these factors play a positive role in the process of new urbanization. In the future, provincial capital cities need to consider the weak links and provide more focus on employment and education."
https://openalex.org/W3026239993,"Obesity is associated with significantly higher mortality rates, and excess adipose tissue is involved in respective pathologies. Here we established a human adipose tissue slice cultures (HATSC) model ex vivo. HATSC match the in vivo cell composition of human adipose tissue with, among others, mature adipocytes, mesenchymal stem cells as well as stroma tissue and immune cells. This is a new method, optimized for live imaging, to study adipose tissue and cell-based mechanisms of obesity in particular. HATSC survival was tested by means of conventional and immunofluorescence histological techniques, functional analyses and live imaging. Surgery-derived tissue was cut with a tissue chopper in 500 μm sections and transferred onto membranes building an air-liquid interface. HATSC were cultured in six-well plates filled with Dulbecco’s Modified Eagle’s Medium (DMEM), insulin, transferrin, and selenium, both with and without serum. After 0, 1, 7 and 14 days in vitro, slices were fixated and analyzed by morphology and Perilipin A for tissue viability. Immunofluorescent staining against IBA1, CD68 and Ki67 was performed to determine macrophage survival and proliferation. These experiments showed preservation of adipose tissue as well as survival and proliferation of monocytes and stroma tissue for at least 14 days in vitro even in the absence of serum. The physiological capabilities of adipocytes were functionally tested by insulin stimulation and measurement of Phospho-Akt on day 7 and 14 in vitro. Viability was further confirmed by live imaging using Calcein-AM (viable cells) and propidium iodide (apoptosis/necrosis). In conclusion, HATSC have been successfully established by preserving the monovacuolar form of adipocytes and surrounding macrophages and connective tissue. This model allows further analysis of mature human adipose tissue biology ex vivo."
https://openalex.org/W3031209171,"The heart is critically dependent on mitochondrial respiration for energy supply. Ischemia decreases oxygen availability, with catastrophic consequences for cellular energy systems. After a few minutes of ischemia, the mitochondrial respiratory chain halts, ATP levels drop and ion gradients across cell membranes collapse. Activation of cellular proteases and generation of reactive oxygen species by mitochondria during ischemia alter mitochondrial membrane permeability, causing mitochondrial swelling and fragmentation and eventually cell death. The mitochondria, therefore, are important targets of cardioprotection against ischemic injury. We have previously shown that ixazomib (IXA), a proteasome inhibitor used for treating multiple myeloma, effectively reduced the size of the infarct produced by global ischemia in isolated rat hearts and prevented degradation of the sarcoplasmic reticulum calcium release channel RyR2. The aim of this work was to further characterize the protective effect of IXA by determining its effect on mitochondrial morphology and function after ischemia. We also quantified the effect of IXA on levels of mitofusin-2, a protein involved in maintaining mitochondrial morphology and mitochondria-SR communication. We found that mitochondria were significantly preserved and functional parameters such as oxygen consumption, the ability to generate a membrane potential, and glutathione content were improved in mitochondria isolated from hearts perfused with IXA prior to ischemia. IXA also blocked the release of cytochrome c observed in ischemia and significantly preserved mitofusin-2 integrity. These beneficial effects resulted in a significant decrease in the left ventricular end diastolic pressure upon reperfusion and a smaller infarct in isolated hearts."
https://openalex.org/W3031585166,"Targeted gene integration via precise homologous recombination (HR)-based gene editing has the potential to correct genetic diseases. AAV (adeno-associated virus) can mediate nuclease-free gene integration at a disease-causing locus. Therapeutic application of AAV gene integration requires quantitative molecular characterization of the edited sequence that overcome technical obstacles such as excess episomal vector genomes and lengthy homology arms. Here we describe a novel molecular methodology that utilizes quantitative next-generation sequencing to characterize AAV-mediated targeted insertion and detects the presence of unintended mutations. The methods described here quantify targeted insertion and query the entirety of the target locus for the presence of insertions, deletions, single nucleotide variants (SNVs) and integration of viral components such as inverted terminal repeats (ITR). Using a humanized liver murine model, we demonstrate that hematopoietic stem-cell derived AAVHSC15 mediates in vivo targeted gene integration into human chromosome 12 at the PAH (phenylalanine hydroxylase) locus at 6% frequency, with no sign of co-incident random mutations at or above a lower limit of detection of 0.5% and no ITR sequences at the integration sites. Furthermore, analysis of heterozygous variants across the targeted locus using the methods described shows a pattern of strand cross-over, supportive of an HR mechanism of gene integration with similar efficiencies across two different haplotypes. Rapid advances in the application of AAV-mediated nuclease-free target integration, or gene editing, as a new therapeutic modality requires precise understanding of the efficiency and the nature of the changes being introduced to the target genome at the molecular level. This work provides a framework to be applied to homologous recombination gene editing platforms for assessment of introduced and natural sequence variation across a target site."
https://openalex.org/W3031784648,"Diabetes is the leading cause of end-stage renal disease worldwide. Our understanding of the early kidney response to chronic hyperglycemia remains incomplete. To address this, we first investigated the urinary proteomes of otherwise healthy youths with and without type 1 diabetes and subsequently examined the enriched pathways that might be dysregulated in early disease using systems biology approaches. This cross-sectional study included two separate cohorts for the discovery (N = 30) and internal validation (N = 30) of differentially excreted proteins. Discovery proteomics was performed on a Q Exactive Plus hybrid quadrupole-orbitrap mass spectrometer. We then searched the pathDIP, KEGG, and Reactome databases to identify enriched pathways in early diabetes; the Integrated Interactions Database to retrieve protein-protein interaction data; and the PubMed database to compare fold changes of our signature proteins with those published in similarly designed studies. Proteins were selected for internal validation based on pathway enrichment and availability of commercial enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kits. Of the 2451 proteins identified, 576 were quantified in all samples from the discovery cohort; 34 comprised the urinary signature for early diabetes after Benjamini-Hochberg adjustment (Q < 0.05). The top pathways associated with this signature included lysosome, glycosaminoglycan degradation, and innate immune system (Q < 0.01). Notably, all enzymes involved in keratan sulfate degradation were significantly elevated in urines from youths with diabetes (|fold change| > 1.6). Increased urinary excretion of monocyte differentiation antigen CD14, hexosaminidase A, and lumican was also observed in the validation cohort (P < 0.05). Twenty-one proteins from our signature have been reported elsewhere as potential mediators of early diabetes. In this study, we identified a urinary proteomic signature for early type 1 diabetes, of which lysosomal enzymes were major constituents. Our findings highlight novel pathways such as keratan sulfate degradation in the early kidney response to hyperglycemia."
https://openalex.org/W3028320353,"Purpose A traditional male role orientation is considered to increase the risk of depression and preventing men from disclosing symptoms of mental illness and seeking professional help. Less is known about the variance of masculinity orientations in men already treated for depression and their role in the treatment process. In this study, patterns of masculinity norms and work role orientations will be identified among men treated for depression. Associations of these patterns with depressive symptoms, stigma and delay in professional help-seeking will be investigated. Methods In a cross-sectional study, male role orientations (MRNS), work-related attitudes (AVEM), symptoms of mental disorders (PHQ), and attitudes related to stigma of mental illness (DSS) were assessed by standardized methods in a sample of 250 men treated for depression in general medical, psychiatric and psychotherapeutic services. Data were analyzed by means of latent profile analysis (LPA), by multinomial and linear regression models, and by path analysis. Results The results of LPA revealed three latent classes of men treated for depression. Men assigned to class one reported a less traditional male role orientation, low professional ambitions and low coping capacities; men assigned to class two reported a traditional masculinity orientation, high professional ambitions but low coping capacities; men assigned to class three reported less traditional masculinity tended orientations, medium professional ambitions and high coping capacities. Men assigned to classes one and two to have more stigmatizing attitudes, longer periods of untreated illness and more severe symptoms of mental disorders, in comparison to men assigned to class three. Conclusions Overall, this study reveals that traditional masculinity norms and work-role orientations in men treated for depression are associated with a worse mental health status. Our study results also suggest that a slackening of traditional masculinity norms is associated with improved psychological well-being if it does not coincide with a complete distancing from professional ambitions and a lack of ability to cope with professional stress."

https://openalex.org/W3030936501,"Objectives The adequate duration for EPBD was unclear. Therefore, we aimed to investigate the effect of balloon dilatation duration of EPBD on the occurrence of PEP. Methods One hundred and ninety-eight patients with common bile duct (CBD) stone treated by EPBD were retrospectively recruited. The dilatation duration was determined according to adequate opening of the biliary orifice without bleeding. The clinical outcomes and complications of EPBD were recorded. Results We stratified the patients according to dilatation duration (Group A, <3 minutes; Group B, 3–5 minutes; Group C, ≥5 minutes). The group C patients had a higher proportion of large CBD stones (stones ≥10 mm) (33.3% vs. 26.8% vs. 53.5%, p = 0.01). Patients in group A had a significantly higher PEP rate than patients in group B (13.3 vs. 3.1, p = 0.032). There were no significant differences in perforation and bleeding rate among the three groups. Univariate and multivariate analyses showed that a dilatation duration of <3 minutes, CBD diameter < 10 mm and age ≤ 75 years were independent risk factors of PEP in post-EPBD patients. Conclusions In patients receiving EPBD, dilatation duration <3 minutes, lower CBD diameter, and younger age were independent risk factors of PEP."
https://openalex.org/W3028658486,"Summary Reprogramming autologous adult cells to pluripotent cells allows for relatively safe cell replacement therapy. This can be achieved by nuclear transfer, cell fusion, or induced pluripotent stem cell technology However, the epigenetic memory of the cell is considered as a great challenge facing the complete reprograming of cells by these methods. Introducing oocyte-specific factors into differentiated cells may present a promising approach by mimicking cellular reprogramming during fertilization. Methods Human bone marrow mesenchymal stromal cells (hBM-MSCs) were cultured with different concentrations of human metaphase II (M II) oocyte extract (0.1, 1, 5, 10, 30 ng/μl). Reprogramming was assessed at various exposure times (1, 4, 7 days). Cells were tested for their proliferation rate, morphological changes, expression of pluripotency markers, expression of mesenchymal to epithelial transition markers, and mitochondrial rejuvenation. (mitochondrial localization, morphological changes, bioenergetics, transmembrane potential, and levels of reactive oxygen species, ROS). Results Treatment of human BM-MSCs with 10 ng/μl oocyte extract resulted in increased cell proliferation, which was associated with the upregulation of the pluripotency genes OCT-4, NANOG, and SOX-2 and a concomitant downregulation of mesenchymal-specific genes. MSCs exhibited small, immature round mitochondria with few swollen cristae localized proximal to the cell nucleus. This was accompanied by morphological cell changes, a metabolic shift towards oxidative phosphorylation, a high mitochondrial membrane potential, and increased ROS production. Conclusion These data show that treatment with 10 ng/μl human MII-phase oocyte extract induced genetic and mitochondrial reprogramming of human BM-MSCs to a more embryonic phenotype."

Several potential regulatory regions have been identified in close proximity of Ikzf1, however, the full extent of the regulatory landscape of the Ikzf1 locus is not yet established. In this study, we combined epigenomics and transcription factor binding along with high-throughput enhancer assay and 4C-seq to prioritize an enhancer element located 120 kb upstream of the Ikzf1 gene. We found that deletion of the E120 enhancer resulted in a significant reduction of Ikzf1 mRNA. However, the epigenetic landscape and 3D topology of the locus were only slightly affected, highlighting the complexity of the regulatory landscape regulating the Ikzf1 locus."
https://openalex.org/W3026764754,"Purpose The study estimates the prevalence of probable psychiatric disorder in the working population, determines the proportion of people presenting a probable psychiatric disorder among people exposed to work-related psychosocial risk factors (PSRFs), and identifies which PSRF has the strongest association with having a probable psychiatric disorder. Methods A cross-sectional study conducted in March 2018 involved a representative sample of the French working population. The General Health Questionnaire 28 (GHQ-28) was used to estimate the prevalence of probable psychiatric disorder and 44 items were gathered from theoretical models of PSRFs. We used multiple logistic regression to estimate the association of each PSRF with having a probable psychiatric disorder, adjusted on individual, health, and job confounders. Results This study involved 3200 French participants. The proportion of probable psychiatric disorder was 22.2% [20.6; 24.0]. Ten PSRFs were significantly associated with it. The strongest association was for having problems handling professional and personal responsibilities (reported by 15% of the study population) (OR = 1.97 [1.52; 2.54]), with 45% pathological GHQ-28 scores (potential psychiatric cases) for people exposed to this PSRF versus 18% non-exposed. The next strongest association was lack of support of colleagues (reported by 28%) (OR = 1.63 [1.29; 2.06]). The third strongest association was feeling sometimes afraid when doing the job (reported by 63%) (OR = 1.53, [1.21; 1.93]). Conclusions Our study identified 10 PSRFs associated with psychiatric disorder, with substantial exposure rate among the population. The results of our research could help develop recommendations to improve work environment."
https://openalex.org/W3029597107,"Word identification is undeniably important for skilled reading and ultimately reading comprehension. Interestingly, both lexical and sublexical procedures can support word identification. Recent cross-linguistic comparisons have demonstrated that there are biases in orthographic coding (e.g., holistic vs. analytic) linked with differences in writing systems, such that holistic orthographic coding is correlated with lexical-level reading procedures and vice versa. The current study uses a measure of holistic visual processing used in the face processing literature, orientation sensitivity, to test individual differences in word identification within a native English population. Results revealed that greater orientation sensitivity (i.e., greater holistic processing) was associated with a reading profile that relies less on sublexical phonological measures and more on lexical-level characteristics within the skilled English readers. Parallels to Chinese procedures of reading and a proposed alternative route to skilled reading are discussed."
https://openalex.org/W3032604040,"Recently, modulatory effects of static magnetic field stimulation (tSMS) on excitability of the motor cortex have been reported. In our previous study we failed to replicate these results. It was suggested that the lack of modulatory effects was due to the use of an auditory oddball task in our study. Thus, we aimed to evaluate the role of an oddball task on the effects of tSMS on motor cortex excitability. In a within-subject-design we compared 10 minutes tSMS with and without oddball task. In one of the two sessions subjects had to solve an auditory oddball task during the exposure to the magnet, whereas there was no task during exposure in the other session. Motor cortex excitability was measured before and after tSMS. No modulation was observed in any condition. However, when data were pooled regarding the order of the sessions, a trend for an increase of excitability was observed in the first session compared to the second session. We now can rule out that the auditory oddball task destroys tSMS effects, as postulated. Our results rather suggest that fluctuations in the amplitudes of single pulse motor evoked potentials may possibly mask weak modulatory effects but may also lead to false positive results if the number of subjects in a study is too low. In addition, there might be a habituation effect to the whole procedure, resulting in less variability when subjects underwent the same experiment twice."

However, the use of scavenged tissues has been advocated to reduce animal use. Utilising discarded tissues from routine surgical procedures, such as canine neutering, has not previously been investigated. Canine testicular and uterine tissues (discarded tissues) were obtained from routine neutering procedures performed by the veterinary team at a local animal neutering clinic for stray dogs. Rings of uterine and testicular artery were dissected and mounted on a Mulvany-Halpern wire myograph in order to characterize the adrenergic and serotonergic receptors mediating vasoconstriction. Cumulative contractile concentration-response curves were constructed for the alpha adrenoceptor agonists epinephrine (α1 and α2 receptors), phenylephrine (α1 selective) and UK14304 (α2 selective). Pre-treatment with the α1-selective antagonist, prazosin, was also investigated. The response to serotonin (5-HT) receptor agonists were also investigated, including 5-HT (acting at both 5-HT1 and 5-HT2 receptors), 5-carboxamidotryptamine (5-CT; 5-HT1 selective) and α-methyl 5-HT (5-HT2 selective). A contractile response was observed in both canine uterine and testicular arteries to epinephrine and phenylephrine, and prazosin caused a dose-dependent parallel rightward shift in the phenylephrine dose-response curve (pA2 values of 7.97 and 8.39, respectively). UK14304 caused a contractile response in canine testicular arteries but very little appreciable contractile response in uterine arteries. The maximum responses produced by the uterine arteries to 5-HT was significantly lower than those of the testicular arteries. In the testicular artery, the 5-HT2 receptor selective agonist, α-methyl 5-HT, produced a similar contractile response to 5-HT but the administration of 5-CT failed to produce a response in either the testicular or uterine artery segments. These results validate the use of discarded tissue from routine canine neutering procedures as a useful source of vascular tissue for pharmacological teaching, for characterizing alpha and 5-HT receptor contractile responses."
https://openalex.org/W3030902419,"Panagrolaimus sp. DAW1, a nematode cultured from the Antarctic, has the extraordinary physiological ability to survive total intracellular freezing throughout all of its compartments. While a few other organisms, all nematodes, have subsequently also been found to survive freezing in this manner, P. sp. DAW1 has so far shown the highest survival rates. In addition, P. sp. DAW1 is also, depending on the rate or extent of freezing, able to undergo cryoprotective dehydration. In this study, the proteome of P. sp DAW1 is explored, highlighting a number of differentially expressed proteins and pathways that occur when the nematodes undergo intracellular freezing. Among the strongest signals after being frozen is an upregulation of proteases and the downregulation of cytoskeletal and antioxidant activity, the latter possibly accumulated before freezing much in the way the sugar trehalose has been shown to be stored during acclimation."
https://openalex.org/W3030989639,"Introduction The purpose of this study was to explore factors that impact patients’ ability to access high quality, expeditious oral health care by understanding medical professionals’ knowledge of oral health, the care they provide to patients presenting with oral health complaints, and their perceptions of potential interventions to improve oral health care delivery. Methods We conducted in depth qualitative interviews, which were analyzed using an inductive content analytical approach. The study was conducted in Gugulethu, a community located outside of Cape Town, South Africa. Local public sector health services provided free-of-charge are the main source of primary health and dental care for this population. Participants included the following medical providers: doctors, clinical nurse practitioners, professional nurses, and health promoters. Results Identified themes fell within the three broad subject areas: oral health knowledge, patient care, and potential interventions. Themes within oral health knowledge included (1) personal responsibility for hygiene, (2) routine oral health care, (3) lack of knowledge among medical professionals, (4) poverty, and (5) an oral-systemic connection. Participants cited both ‘clinical care knowledge’ and/or ‘uncertainty’ about patient care for oral health complaints. Participants independently suggested interventions in three broad areas: (1) education, (2) expanded provider roles, and (3) colocation of services. Conclusions Our findings suggest that a variety of interventions, ranging from high to low resource investment, may impact access to and utilization of oral health services and thereby result in improved patient care. Future studies should develop and evaluate the suggested interventions in a range of care settings."
