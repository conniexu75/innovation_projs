https://openalex.org/W2064786379,"SINCE Bethe's1 original work on the polarization of the scent trails of the ant Acanthomyops niger, numerous theories have been put forward to explain the phenomenon. The majority, particularly those of Wasmann2, Forel3 and Brun4, resulted from work on Acanthomyops fuliginosus, a species which in Nature, unlike A. niger, forms long columns of workers going to and fro between nest and food. Polarization in these trails was claimed to arise from the individual pieces of the trail. According to Wasmann2, these were the footprints of the workers, which would have a direction implicit in them, like a human footprint."

https://openalex.org/W1976303760,WE have studied the correlation between the directions of emission of alpha-particles and gamma-rays at the 340-keV. resonance in the following reaction: Both alpha-particles and gamma-rays were observed in the plane perpendicular to the proton beam. The alpha-particles were detected in a proportional counter with a window sufficiently thick (approximately 6.5 mm. air equivalent) to exclude protons scattered from the calcium fluoride target. The 6.1-MeV. gamma-rays emitted from the oxygen-16* nuclei were detected in a lead-walled Geiger counter. Coincidences between the alpha-particles and the gamma-rays were measured as a function of angle between the counters.

https://openalex.org/W2080490608,"ERGOTHIONEINE has been isolated from ergot1 and from mammalian blood2,3. Barger and Ewins4 and Akabori5 showed that the structure of ergothioneine (I) is β-2-thiolglyoxaline-4(5)-propiobetaine. This structure has now been confirmed by synthesis according to the following scheme."
https://openalex.org/W2017484819,"THE ground-state of the indium atom is 5s2 5p 2P0½ and the term system responsible for the ordinary series spectrum—that is, the system built on the 5s2 S0 ground-state of the ion—was summarized and extended by Paschen1. Also included in his list are the following three terms: 5s5p2 4P, 5s5p2 2D and 5s5p6s 4P. Of these, the first-named was originally identified by Sawyer and Lang2 and by Lansing3 independently, and seems well established; the other two terms are much more tentative. The sp2-configuration should give other, hitherto unidentified terms, 2S and 2P, remembering that the use of Russell-Saunders symbols is merely conventional, as we are dealing with a case which probably departs markedly from LS-coupling. Rough estimates indicate that these terms, and those of other configurations in which two electrons are excited, will lie above the normal ionization potential."

https://openalex.org/W2052846807,"MALARIA parasites of the epauletted fruit bats of tropical Africa have been described by Rodhain from the Belgian Congo, by Rousselot from French West Africa, and by myself from Kenya. Dr. R. B. Heisch, of the Division of Insect-borne Diseases, Kenya, noted the presence of a similar parasite in Epomophorus wahlbergi and was kind enough to have a number of these bats collected from near Nairobi for me when I was on a visit to the East African territories."

https://openalex.org/W1995308585,"LOCUST species exist in two phases differing in colour, anatomy and behaviour with intermediate forms between the two extremes1,2. The nymphs (hoppers) of the gregarious phase are black and orange in colour; they congregate and wander or march in bands. Hoppers of the solitary phase are green or brown; they live in isolation and do not march. In the laboratory, the two phases can be produced by crowding or isolating the individuals during rearing."
https://openalex.org/W2041238734,"THE crystals of trans-potassium dioxalato-diaquochromiate, K[Cr(C2O4)2(H2O)2].3H2O, are dark red in colour, very hard, and show a very pronounced tendency to intergrow. They are monoclinic, and from X-ray measurements the size of the unit cell was determined as: a = 7.85 A., b = 5.72 A., c = 13.88 A., β = 109° 30′. The density of the compound is 2.02 gm./c.c. The unit cell contains two of the above formula units, and the space group is P2/c (C42h)."

https://openalex.org/W2021629420,"I CAN confirm that the method of mucous cord feeding referred to by Dodd1 plays a part in the natural lives of tadpoles of Rana temporaria, Bufo bufo and Bombina variegata living under natural or semi-natural conditions. It is, however, remarkable that among the many tadpoles which have been examined, definite mucous cords have been seen in only a few. The animals appear to use this method when in the presence of fine particles; but seem to have another means of dealing with the coarse material which so often forms their food. Whole Daphnia, insect larvæ or spiders are not uncommon constituents of the food, and much exceed the diameter of the cords."

https://openalex.org/W1973339746,"IN the determination of the geological ages of minerals by radioactivity methods, much attention is being given to those ages which are of the greatest antiquity. There are several reasons for this. The age of the oldest mineral sets a minimum value for the age of the earth; also a probable minimum age is set for the solar system and extra-terrestrial matter in general. A bottom ‘rung’ is given for any stratigraphical age column, and these great ages are of value when attempting to draw up possible maximum life-spans for the evolution of living organisms to their present state of complexity. In areas of extreme antiquity, suitable minerals may be used for the indirect determination of the decay constants of potassium1; furthermore, areas of greatest age are the most suitable places for seeking possible undetected radioactivities (for example, indium-115 2). Consequently, it is highly desirable that these greatest ages be known accurately and that several checks be made."

https://openalex.org/W2011957716,"THE use of statistical methods for obtaining estimates of error in biological assays was demonstrated by Schild1 in a paper on the assay of histamine using guinea pig gut as test object. In 1943, Beauvillain2 used the rat uterus for assays of oxytocic activity in pituitary preparations, and recently Holton3 has applied Schild's methods to assays of posterior pituitary extract using the same preparation. Holton has shown that assays on the isolated rat uterus may be made more rapidly than on the isolated guinea pig uterus as prescribed in the British Pharmacopœia4, and the accuracy of her assays was greater."

https://openalex.org/W2070746628,"THE soil percolation technique1 was introduced for the study of soil metabolism. In this technique small volumes of a water solution of metabolites are taken regularly and frequently from a reservoir, allowed to percolate through a column of aerated soil, and returned to the reservoir. The course of soil metabolism is then followed by analyses of the reservoir fluid. The original apparatus2 has since been modified3 and adapted to the measurement of the carbon dioxide outputs of percolated soils1. The apparatus to be described permits the measurement of the oxygen uptakes of percolated soils or indeed of any metabolizing system capable of being supported on a solid porous medium."

https://openalex.org/W1967168609,"IN a recent communication in Nature1, Dr. A. H. R. Goldie has suggested that the scintillation of stars may be associated with waves at an interface between two currents of air which have a difference of temperature of the order of 5–7° F. “Such waves,” he writes, “should not uncommonly have an amplitude of the order of up to 500–1,000 ft. at the interface, wave-length up to 10 miles or more, speed anything up to 40 ft. per sec., but probably usually lower.”"
https://openalex.org/W1982681829,"G. HERZBERG and other investigators1 have recently shown that vibrational motions of homopolar molecules which should not appear in infra-red absorption give rise to absorption lines when the substance is in a condensed state (compressed gas or liquid) and when the absorption path is long enough. As the selection rules are the same as for Raman spectra, and as this absorption seems to be dependent on intermolecular forces, it seems natural to attribute it to electric moments induced in the molecules by intermolecular electric fields. The theory of electric moments induced in molecules by a macroscopic electric field can easily be derived from the classical theory of the Raman effect by substituting a constant field vector E for the vibrational field E = E0 sin 2πνt of the incident light wave, and this shows immediately that the induced absorption is governed by the same polarizability-tensor as the Raman effect. While I was developing this theory in a recent note2, my attention was directed to two papers dealing with the same subject: already in 1932 E. U. Condon3 had developed the theory of this induced absorption by electric fields on a quantum-mechanical basis, and in a recent letter in Nature, L. A. Woodward4 has pointed out that the powerful and precise methods of microwave spectroscopy could be extended to the study of pure rotational absorption of non-polar molecules."

https://openalex.org/W2013127943,"INVESTIGATIONS1 on the hydrolysis and water-regaining properties of wood pulp, cotton and cotton linters swelled in sodium hydroxide solutions of varying concentrations showed that, whereas for wood pulps a low constant-limit degree of polymerization and high constant water-regain were reached by swelling in an 8 per cent lye, it was necessary to swell cotton and cotton linters in a 10 per cent solution in order to obtain a similar result. These differences between swollen samples of the two fibres might be due to easier mercerizing, that is, transformation of the cellulose I lattice into the cellulose II lattice, in the case of the wood pulp as compared with the cotton linters."

https://openalex.org/W2092612933,"WHEN an aqueous solution of 1:2:4-trihydroxynaphthalene (dihydrolawsone) is applied to the skin, immediate oxidation to the orange-yellow 2-hydroxy-1:4-naphthaquinone (lawsone) (I) occurs, presumably because of the presence in the skin of an oxidase system. This enzyme is undoubtedly a polyphenoloxidase; but since similar application of L-tyrosine, DL-3:4-dihydroxyphenylalanine, or catechol does not lead to the production of any colour, it is extremely unlikely that the enzyme is tyrosinase. It is known1 that quinones react rapidly with thiol compounds, and it does not appear unreasonable to suppose that, if human skin contains free SH-groups, these would react with the lawsone deposited in situ in the above manner. If the lawsone is allowed to remain on the skin for twenty-four hours, the stain can be removed almost completely by washing with soap and water. Consequently skin appears to contain very few thiol groups."
