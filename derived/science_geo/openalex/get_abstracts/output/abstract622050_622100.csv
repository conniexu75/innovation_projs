https://openalex.org/W2898946138,"The recent successes of immunotherapy have shifted the paradigm in cancer treatment, but because only a percentage of patients are responsive to immunotherapy, it is imperative to identify factors impacting outcome. Obesity is reaching pandemic proportions and is a major risk factor for certain malignancies, but the impact of obesity on immune responses, in general and in cancer immunotherapy, is poorly understood. Here, we demonstrate, across multiple species and tumor models, that obesity results in increased immune aging, tumor progression and PD-1-mediated T cell dysfunction which is driven, at least in part, by leptin. However, obesity is also associated with increased efficacy of PD-1/PD-L1 blockade in both tumor-bearing mice and clinical cancer patients. These findings advance our understanding of obesity-induced immune dysfunction and its consequences in cancer and highlight obesity as a biomarker for some cancer immunotherapies. These data indicate a paradoxical impact of obesity on cancer. There is heightened immune dysfunction and tumor progression but also greater anti-tumor efficacy and survival after checkpoint blockade which directly targets some of the pathways activated in obesity. Obesity promotes tumor growth yet simultaneously increases susceptibility to PD-1-targeted cancer immunotherapy."
https://openalex.org/W2899472109,"Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is the most common acute leukemia in adults. Leukemia stem cells (LSCs) drive the initiation and perpetuation of AML, are quantifiably associated with worse clinical outcomes, and often persist after conventional chemotherapy resulting in relapse1–5. In this report, we show that treatment of older patients with AML with the B cell lymphoma 2 (BCL-2) inhibitor venetoclax in combination with azacitidine results in deep and durable remissions and is superior to conventional treatments. We hypothesized that these promising clinical results were due to targeting LSCs. Analysis of LSCs from patients undergoing treatment with venetoclax + azacitidine showed disruption of the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle manifested by decreased α-ketoglutarate and increased succinate levels, suggesting inhibition of electron transport chain complex II. In vitro modeling confirmed inhibition of complex II via reduced glutathionylation of succinate dehydrogenase. These metabolic perturbations suppress oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS), which efficiently and selectively targets LSCs. Our findings show for the first time that a therapeutic intervention can eradicate LSCs in patients with AML by disrupting the metabolic machinery driving energy metabolism, resulting in promising clinical activity in a patient population with historically poor outcomes. Targeting of mitochondrial metabolism in combination with BCL-2 inhibition eradicates leukemia stem cells and induces long-lasting responses in patients with acute myeloid leukemia."

The analysis of genome-wide genotyping-by-sequencing data for almost all barley accessions of the German ex situ genebank provides insights into the global population structure of domesticated barley and points out redundancies and coverage gaps in one of the world's major genebanks. Our large sample size and dense marker data afford great power for genome-wide association scans. We detect known and novel loci underlying morphological traits differentiating barley genepools, find evidence for convergent selection for barbless awns in barley and rice and show that a major-effect resistance locus conferring resistance to bymovirus infection has been favored by traditional farmers. This study outlines future directions for genomics-assisted genebank management and the utilization of germplasm collections for linking natural variation to human selection during crop evolution."
https://openalex.org/W2900410132,"The linear-ubiquitin chain assembly complex (LUBAC) modulates signalling via various immune receptors. In tumour necrosis factor (TNF) signalling, linear (also known as M1) ubiquitin enables full gene activation and prevents cell death. However, the mechanisms underlying cell death prevention remain ill-defined. Here, we show that LUBAC activity enables TBK1 and IKKε recruitment to and activation at the TNF receptor 1 signalling complex (TNFR1-SC). While exerting only limited effects on TNF-induced gene activation, TBK1 and IKKε are essential to prevent TNF-induced cell death. Mechanistically, TBK1 and IKKε phosphorylate the kinase RIPK1 in the TNFR1-SC, thereby preventing RIPK1-dependent cell death. This activity is essential in vivo, as it prevents TNF-induced lethal shock. Strikingly, NEMO (also known as IKKγ), which mostly, but not exclusively, binds the TNFR1-SC via M1 ubiquitin, mediates the recruitment of the adaptors TANK and NAP1 (also known as AZI2). TANK is constitutively associated with both TBK1 and IKKε, while NAP1 is associated with TBK1. We discovered a previously unrecognized cell death checkpoint that is mediated by TBK1 and IKKε, and uncovered an essential survival function for NEMO, whereby it enables the recruitment and activation of these non-canonical IKKs to prevent TNF-induced cell death."
https://openalex.org/W2900205062,"Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is a heterogeneous disease caused by a variety of alterations in transcription factors, epigenetic regulators and signaling molecules. To determine how different mutant regulators establish AML subtype-specific transcriptional networks, we performed a comprehensive global analysis of cis-regulatory element activity and interaction, transcription factor occupancy and gene expression patterns in purified leukemic blast cells. Here, we focused on specific subgroups of subjects carrying mutations in genes encoding transcription factors (RUNX1, CEBPα), signaling molecules (FTL3-ITD, RAS) and the nuclear protein NPM1). Integrated analysis of these data demonstrates that each mutant regulator establishes a specific transcriptional and signaling network unrelated to that seen in normal cells, sustaining the expression of unique sets of genes required for AML growth and maintenance."
https://openalex.org/W2900324446,"Protein structures are dynamic and can explore a large conformational landscape1,2. Only some of these structural substates are important for protein function (such as ligand binding, catalysis and regulation)3-5. How evolution shapes the structural ensemble to optimize a specific function is poorly understood3,4. One of the constraints on the evolution of proteins is the stability of the folded 'native' state. Despite this, 44% of the human proteome contains intrinsically disordered peptide segments greater than 30 residues in length6, the majority of which have no known function7-9. Here we show that the entropic force produced by an intrinsically disordered carboxy terminus (ID-tail) shifts the conformational ensemble of human UDP-α-D-glucose-6-dehydrogenase (UGDH) towards a substate with a high affinity for an allosteric inhibitor. The function of the ID-tail does not depend on its sequence or chemical composition. Instead, the affinity enhancement can be accurately predicted based on the length of the intrinsically disordered segment, and is consistent with the entropic force generated by an unstructured peptide attached to the protein surface10-13. Our data show that the unfolded state of the ID-tail rectifies the dynamics and structure of UGDH to favour inhibitor binding. Because this entropic rectifier does not have any sequence or structural constraints, it is an easily acquired adaptation. This model implies that evolution selects for disordered segments to tune the energy landscape of proteins, which may explain the persistence of intrinsic disorder in the proteome."
https://openalex.org/W2899677526,"The elucidation and prediction of how changes in a protein result in altered activities and selectivities remain a major challenge in chemistry. Two hurdles have prevented accurate family-wide models: obtaining (i) diverse datasets and (ii) suitable parameter frameworks that encapsulate activities in large sets. Here, we show that a relatively small but broad activity dataset is sufficient to train algorithms for functional prediction over the entire glycosyltransferase superfamily 1 (GT1) of the plant Arabidopsis thaliana. Whereas sequence analysis alone failed for GT1 substrate utilization patterns, our chemical–bioinformatic model, GT-Predict, succeeded by coupling physicochemical features with isozyme-recognition patterns over the family. GT-Predict identified GT1 biocatalysts for novel substrates and enabled functional annotation of uncharacterized GT1s. Finally, analyses of GT-Predict decision pathways revealed structural modulators of substrate recognition, thus providing information on mechanisms. This multifaceted approach to enzyme prediction may guide the streamlined utilization (and design) of biocatalysts and the discovery of other family-wide protein functions. Bioinformatic analysis coupled to substrate-reactivity profiling for the glycosyltransferase (GT) enzyme superfamily supports the development of ‘GT-Predict’ as a tool for functional prediction of GT–substrate relationships."

https://openalex.org/W2900740153,"Alterations in endoplasmic reticulum (ER) calcium (Ca2+) levels diminish insulin secretion and reduce β-cell survival in both major forms of diabetes. The mechanisms responsible for ER Ca2+ loss in β cells remain incompletely understood. Moreover, a specific role for either ryanodine receptor (RyR) or inositol 1,4,5-triphosphate receptor (IP3R) dysfunction in the pathophysiology of diabetes remains largely untested. To this end, here we applied intracellular and ER Ca2+ imaging techniques in INS-1 β cells and isolated islets to determine whether diabetogenic stressors alter RyR or IP3R function. Our results revealed that the RyR is sensitive mainly to ER stress–induced dysfunction, whereas cytokine stress specifically alters IP3R activity. Consistent with this observation, pharmacological inhibition of the RyR with ryanodine and inhibition of the IP3R with xestospongin C prevented ER Ca2+ loss under ER and cytokine stress conditions, respectively. However, RyR blockade distinctly prevented β-cell death, propagation of the unfolded protein response (UPR), and dysfunctional glucose-induced Ca2+ oscillations in tunicamycin-treated INS-1 β cells and mouse islets and Akita islets. Monitoring at the single-cell level revealed that ER stress acutely increases the frequency of intracellular Ca2+ transients that depend on both ER Ca2+ leakage from the RyR and plasma membrane depolarization. Collectively, these findings indicate that RyR dysfunction shapes ER Ca2+ dynamics in β cells and regulates both UPR activation and cell death, suggesting that RyR-mediated loss of ER Ca2+ may be an early pathogenic event in diabetes."
https://openalex.org/W2899992736,"ABHD12 metabolizes bioactive lysophospholipids, including lysophosphatidylserine (lyso-PS). Deleterious mutations in human ABHD12 cause the neurological disease PHARC, and ABHD12-/- mice display PHARC-like phenotypes, including hearing loss, along with elevated brain lyso-PS and features of stimulated innate immune cell function. Here, we develop a selective and in vivo-active inhibitor of ABHD12 termed DO264 and show that this compound elevates lyso-PS in mouse brain and primary human macrophages. Unlike ABHD12-/- mice, adult mice treated with DO264 exhibited minimal perturbations in auditory function. On the other hand, both DO264-treated and ABHD12-/- mice displayed heightened immunological responses to lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV) clone 13 infection that manifested as severe lung pathology with elevated proinflammatory chemokines. These results reveal similarities and differences in the phenotypic impact of pharmacological versus genetic blockade of ABHD12 and point to a key role for this enzyme in regulating immunostimulatory lipid pathways in vivo."
https://openalex.org/W2899379613,"Tissue homeostasis is sustained by stem cell self-renewal and differentiation. How stem cells coordinately differentiate into multiple cell types is largely unclear. Recent studies underline the heterogeneity among stem cells or common progenitors, suggesting that coordination occurs at the stem cell/progenitor level1-4. Here, by tracking and manipulating the same stem cells and their progeny at the single-cell level in live mice, we uncover an unanticipated flexibility of homeostatic stem cell differentiation in hair follicles. Although stem cells have been shown to be flexible upon injury, we demonstrate that hair germ stem cells at the single-cell level can flexibly establish all of the differentiation lineages even in uninjured conditions. Furthermore, stem cell-derived hair progenitors in the structure called matrix, previously thought to be unipotent, flexibly change differentiation outcomes as a consequence of unexpected dynamic relocation. Finally, the flexible cell fate determination mechanism maintains normal differentiation and tissue architecture against an ectopic differentiation stimulus induced by Wnt activation. This work provides a model of continual fate channelling and late commitment of stem cells to achieve coordinated differentiation and robust tissue architecture."

https://openalex.org/W2901663918,"Lipids are key compounds in marine ecosystems being involved in organism growth, reproduction, and survival. Despite their biological significance and ease of measurement, the use of lipids in deep-sea studies is limited, as is our understanding of energy and nutrient flows in the deep ocean. Here, a comprehensive analysis of total lipid content, and lipid class and fatty acid composition, was used to explore functional diversity and nutritional content within a deep-sea faunal assemblage comprising 139 species from 8 phyla, including the Chordata, Arthropoda, and Cnidaria. A wide range of total lipid content and lipid class composition suggested a diversified set of energy allocation strategies across taxa. Overall, phospholipid was the dominant lipid class. While triacylglycerol was present in most taxa as the main form of energy storage, a few crustaceans, fish, jellyfishes, and corals had higher levels of wax esters/steryl esters instead. Type and amount of energy reserves may reflect dietary sources and environmental conditions for certain deep-sea taxa. Conversely, the composition of fatty acids was less diverse than that of lipid class composition, and large proportions of unsaturated fatty acids were detected, consistent with the growing literature on cold-water species. In addition, levels of unsaturation increased with depth, likely suggesting an adaptive strategy to maintain normal membrane structure and function in species found in deeper waters. Although proportions of n-3 fatty acids were high across all phyla, representatives of the Chordata and Arthropoda were the main reservoirs of these essential nutrients, thus suggesting health benefits to their consumers."
https://openalex.org/W2900965784,"A new perfect metamaterial absorber (PMA) with high fractional bandwidth (FBW) is examined and verified for solar energy harvesting. Solar cells based on perfect metamaterial give a chance to increase the efficiency of the system by intensifying the solar electromagnetic wave that incident on the device. The designed structure is mostly offered in the visible frequency range so as to exploit the solar’s energy efficiently. Parametric investigations with regard to the measurements of the design structure are fulfilled to characterize the absorber. The finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) method-based CST simulator was used to keep the pattern parameters and absorbance analysis. The metamaterial shows almost 99.96% and 99.60% perfect absorption at 523.84 THz and 674.12 THz resonance frequencies. Moreover, absorption’s FBW is studied, and 39.22% FBW is found. The results confirm that the designed PMA can attain very high absorption peak at two modes such as transverse electric (TE) and transverse magnetic (TM) mode. Other than the numerical outcomes demonstrated that the suggested configuration was also polarization angle insensitive. In addition, the change of absorbance of the structure has provided a new kind of sensor applications in these frequency ranges. Therefore, the suggested metamaterial absorber offers perfect absorption for visible frequency ranges and can be used for renewable solar energy harvesting applications."

Therefore, this study aimed to classify the characteristics of surrogate measures for insulin resistance and establish valid cut-off values for predicting the development of type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM) in Korean populations. Methods This prospective study included 7,643 participants aged 40–69 years from the Ansung-Ansan cohort database (2001–2012). Four surrogate measures, namely homeostasis model assessment-insulin resistance (HOMA-IR), visceral adiposity index (VAI), lipid accumulation product (LAP), and triglycerides and glucose (TyG) index, were analyzed. We analyzed each measure using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve for the development of type 2 DM. The cut-off value was determined as the value with the highest Youden index score in the specificity dominant area. Results The area under the curve (AUC) was 0.566 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.548–0.583) for HOMA-IR, 0.622 (95% CI, 0.605–0.639) for VAI, 0.642 (95% CI, 0.625–0.658) for LAP, and 0.672 (95% CI, 0.656–0.687) for TyG index. The AUC of TyG index was significantly higher than that of HOMA-IR, VAI, and LAP (p < 0.001). The cut-off value was 2.54 (sensitivity 36.8%; specificity 73.1%; hazard ratio [HR], 1.41, 95% CI, 1.25–1.59) for HOMA-IR, 2.54 (sensitivity 50.4%; specificity 68.8%; HR, 1.75, 95% CI, 1.55–1.96) for VAI, 36.6 (sensitivity 59.2%; specificity 63.9%; HR, 1.87, 95% CI, 1.64–2.14) for LAP, and 4.69 (sensitivity 62.1%; specificity 63.1%; HR, 2.17, 95% CI, 1.92–2.45) for TyG index. Conclusions The TyG index was a better predictor for DM than HOMA-IR. VAI and LAP showed the modest predictability for DM. The TyG index could be a useful supplementary method for identifying individuals at risk for insulin resistance and DM development."
https://openalex.org/W2901188768,"Lung cancer is the second most common cancer in the United States and the leading cause of mortality in cancer patients. Biomarkers predicting survival of patients with lung cancer have a profound effect on patient prognosis and treatment. However, predictive biomarkers for survival and their relevance for lung cancer are not been well known yet. The objective of this study was to perform machine learning with data from The Cancer Genome Atlas of patients with lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) to find survival-specific gene mutations that could be used as survival-predicting biomarkers. To identify survival-specific mutations according to various clinical factors, four feature selection methods (information gain, chi-squared test, minimum redundancy maximum relevance, and correlation) were used. Extracted survival-specific mutations of LUAD were applied individually or as a group for Kaplan-Meier survival analysis. Mutations in MMRN2 and GMPPA were significantly associated with patient mortality while those in ZNF560 and SETX were associated with patient survival. Mutations in DNAJC2 and MMRN2 showed significant negative association with overall survival while mutations in ZNF560 showed significant positive association with overall survival. Mutations in MMRN2 showed significant negative association with disease-free survival while mutations in DRD3 and ZNF560 showed positive associated with disease-free survival. Mutations in DRD3, SETX, and ZNF560 showed significant positive association with survival in patients with LUAD while the opposite was true for mutations in DNAJC2, GMPPA, and MMRN2. These gene mutations were also found in other cohorts of LUAD, lung squamous cell carcinoma, and small cell lung cancer. In LUAD of Pan-Lung Cancer cohort, mutations in GMPPA, DNAJC2, and MMRN2 showed significant negative associations with survival of patients while mutations in DRD3 and SETX showed significant positive association with survival. In this study, machine learning was conducted to obtain information necessary to discover specific gene mutations associated with the survival of patients with LUAD. Mutations in the above six genes could predict survival rate and disease-free survival rate in patients with LUAD. Thus, they are important biomarker candidates for prognosis."
https://openalex.org/W2900349192,"In the brain, decision making is instantiated in dedicated neural circuits. However, there is considerable individual variability in decision-making behavior, particularly under uncertainty. The origins of decision variability within these conserved neural circuits are not known. Here we demonstrate in the rat medial frontal cortex (MFC) that individual variability is a consequence of altered stability in neuronal populations. In a sensory-guided choice task, rats trained on familiar stimuli were exposed to unfamiliar stimuli, resulting in variable choice responses across individuals. We created a recurrent network model to examine the source of variability in MFC neurons, and found that the landscape of neural population trajectories explained choice variability across different unfamiliar stimuli. We experimentally confirmed model predictions showing that trial-by-trial variability in neuronal activity indexes the landscape and predicts individual variation. These results show that neural stability is a critical component of the MFC neural dynamics that underpins individual variation in decision-making. Behavioral responses vary considerably across individuals. Kurikawa et al. show experimentally and computationally how the observed spectrum of individual variances in decision-making emerges from neural dynamics of the medial frontal cortex."

However, PORCN-mediated Wnt lipidation has not been reconstituted in vitro with purified enzyme. Here, we report the first successful purification of human PORCN and confirm, through in vitro reconstitution with the purified enzyme, that PORCN is necessary and sufficient for Wnt acylation. By systematically examining a series of substrate variants, we show that PORCN intimately recognizes the local structure of Wnt around the site of acylation. Our in vitro assay enabled us to examine the activity of PORCN with a range of fatty acyl-CoAs with varying length and unsaturation. The selectivity of human PORCN across a spectrum of fatty acyl-CoAs suggested that the kink in the unsaturated acyl chain is a key determinant of PORCN-mediated catalysis. Finally, we show that two putative PORCN inhibitors that were discovered with cell-based assays indeed target human PORCN.

https://openalex.org/W2901660867,"Caspases are cysteine–aspartic proteases involved in the regulation of programmed cell death (apoptosis) and a number of other biological processes. Despite overall similarities in structure and active-site composition, caspases show striking selectivity for particular protein substrates. Exosites are emerging as one of the mechanisms by which caspases can recruit, engage, and orient these substrates for proper hydrolysis. Following computational analyses and database searches for candidate exosites, we utilized site-directed mutagenesis to identify a new exosite in caspase-6 at the hinge between the disordered N-terminal domain (NTD), residues 23–45, and core of the caspase-6 structure. We observed that substitutions of the tri-arginine patch Arg-42–Arg-44 or the R44K cancer-associated mutation in caspase-6 markedly alter its rates of protein substrate hydrolysis. Notably, turnover of protein substrates but not of short peptide substrates was affected by these exosite alterations, underscoring the importance of this region for protein substrate recruitment. Hydrogen–deuterium exchange MS–mediated interrogation of the intrinsic dynamics of these enzymes suggested the presence of a substrate-binding platform encompassed by the NTD and the 240's region (containing residues 236–246), which serves as a general exosite for caspase-6–specific substrate recruitment. In summary, we have identified an exosite on caspase-6 that is critical for protein substrate recognition and turnover and therefore highly relevant for diseases such as cancer in which caspase-6–mediated apoptosis is often disrupted, and in neurodegeneration in which caspase-6 plays a central role.

Even in low malaria transmission settings, such as the Amazon basin, where progress in malaria control has caused a remarkable reduction in case incidence, a recent increase in P. vivax transmission demonstrates the continued vulnerability of P.vivax-exposed populations. As part of a search for complementary approaches to P.vivax surveillance in areas in which adults are the majority of the exposed-population, here we evaluated the potential of serological markers covering a wide range of immunogenicity to estimate malaria transmission trends. For this, antibodies against leading P. vivax blood-stage vaccine candidates were assessed during a 9 year follow-up study among adults exposed to unstable malaria transmission in the Amazon rainforest. Circulating antibody levels against immunogenic P. vivax proteins, such as the Apical Membrane Antigen-1, were a sensitive measure of recent P. vivax exposure, while antibodies against less immunogenic proteins were indicative of naturally-acquired immunity, including the novel engineered Duffy binding protein II immunogen (DEKnull-2). Our results suggest that the robustness of serology to estimate trends in P.vivax malaria transmission will depend on the immunological background of the study population, and that for adult populations exposed to unstable P.vivax malaria transmission, the local heterogeneity of antibody responses should be considered when considering use of serological surveillance."

We demonstrate how this approach can be applied to examine associations between multiple time-varying exposures and subsequent health outcomes, where the former are recorded sparsely and irregularly in time, with emphasis on the utility of multiple longitudinal observations in the framework of dimension reduction techniques. In applications to children’s growth data, we investigate archetypes of infant growth patterns and identify subgroups that are related to cognitive development in childhood. Specifically, “Stunting” and “Faltering” time-dynamic patterns of head circumference, body length and weight in the first 12 months are associated with lower levels of long-term cognitive development in comparison to “Generally Large” and “Catch-up” growth. Our findings provide evidence for the statistical association between multivariate growth patterns in infancy and long-term cognitive development."

To enable integration of omic data from distinct platforms and species, a specific ontology was applied to tie together and harmonise multi-level omic studies based on gene and protein clusters (CluSO) and mapping of orthologous genes (OMAP) across species. CAD continues to be a leading cause of death in the population worldwide, and it is generally thought to be an age-related disease. However, CAD incidence rates are now known to be highly influenced by environmental factors and interactions, in addition to genetic determinants. With the complexity of CAD aetiology, there is a difficulty in research studies to elucidate general elements compared to other cardiovascular diseases.

However, the roles of membrane lipids in the formation of pores and their biological functions are largely unknown.

Moreover, generation of ceramidosomes independently of any external drug/stress stimuli was also detected in the plasma membrane of germ line stem cells in ovaries during the early stages of oogenesis in Drosophila melanogaster. Inhibition of ceramidosome formation via myosin IIA silencing limited germ line stem cell signaling and abrogated oogenesis.

However, the precise roles of RIPK1 and/or necroptosis in stem cell development and/or signaling remain largely unknown. In Drosophila melanogaster, ovary development (oogenesis) begins with the formation of cysts of interconnected germ cells, produced by germ line stem cells, enveloped by somatic follicle cells (39Wodarz A.

Oogenesis in insect cells requires a complex mechanism for differentiation of germ line and somatic cells (40Pellettieri J. Seydoux G. Anterior-posterior polarity in C. elegans and Drosophila: PARallels and differences.Science. 2002; 298 (12471246): 1946-195010.1126/science.1072162Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). The Drosophila ovary contains three types of stem cell populations, germ line stem cells (GSCs), somatic stem cells, and escort stem cells, which are contained in a well-defined anatomical structure called the germarium (41Peng J.C.

Thus, insect ovaries present an ideal model to study the roles of various mechanisms in the regulation of stem cell development and signaling. Given the importance of ceramide in inducing cell death and necroptosis, here we sought to investigate whether ceramide generation and/or trafficking plays any roles in FTY720-mediated necroptosis and/or stem cell development/signaling. Our data suggest that FTY720-mediated necroptosis depends on the formation of nonselective membrane pores, regulated by ceramide–RIPK1 complexes, that are transported to the plasma membrane by nonmuscle myosin IIA (NMIIA) through endocytic vesicular transport. These data also reveal a novel endogenous role for the formation of ceramide–RIPK1–NMIIA–enriched membrane pores in germ line stem cells in D. melanogaster during oogenesis without any external stress stimuli or exposure. These data suggest that. in addition to their roles in stress-mediated necroptosis, ceramide-enriched pores might play important biological roles, at least during D. melanogaster ovary development, regulating membrane integrity and signaling. To determine whether FTY720-mediated necroptosis is associated with plasma membrane alterations, we carried out live-cell imaging, transmission EM (TEM), and scanning EM (SE) studies using GFP-expressing A549 cells in the absence/presence of FTY720 at various time points (0–240 min). Data showed that FTY720 induced membrane blebbing, followed by plasma membrane rupture and necroptosis in a time-dependent manner (Fig. 1, A and B, and Fig. S1A). Plasma membrane blebbing and rupture in response to FTY720 (10 μm) was also observed in H1341 lung cancer cells (Fig. S1B). Interestingly, FTY720-mediated blebbing and plasma membrane rupture were largely abrogated when the cells were pretreated with blebbistatin (44Allingham J.S. Smith R. Rayment I. The structural basis of blebbistatin inhibition and specificity for myosin II.Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2005; 12 (15750603): 378-37910.1038/nsmb908Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar), a known inhibitor of NMIIA-mediated blebbing, in A549 cells, as detected using live-cell imaging, TEM, and SE (Fig. 1, C–G). Moreover, alterations of plasma membrane integrity and induction of necroptotic cell death in response to FTY720 were also evident when the YOPRO-1 (45Sorge R.E. Trang T. Dorfman R. Smith S.B.

Thus, these data suggest that FTY720-mediated necroptosis is linked to NMIIA-mediated blebbing, resulting in membrane rupture and cell death. Because FTY720 induced necroptosis was independent of RIPK3 and MLKL, as shown previously (25Saddoughi S.A. Gencer S. Peterson Y.K. Ward K.E. Mukhopadhyay A. Oaks J. Bielawski J. Szulc Z.M.

In eukaryotes, HR has evolved into an essential step in meiosis. During meiosis many eukaryotes utilize a two-recombinase pathway. This system consists of Rad51 and the meiosis-specific recombinase Dmc1. Both recombinases have distinct activities during meiotic HR, despite being highly similar in sequence and having closely related biochemical activities, raising the question of how these two proteins can perform separate functions. A likely explanation for their differential regulation involves the meiosis-specific recombination proteins Hop2 and Mnd1, which are part of a highly conserved eukaryotic protein complex that participates in HR, albeit through poorly understood mechanisms. To better understand how Hop2–Mnd1 functions during HR, here we used DNA curtains in conjunction with single-molecule imaging to measure and quantify the binding of the Hop2–Mnd1 complex from Saccharomyces cerevisiae to recombination intermediates comprising Rad51– and Dmc1–ssDNA in real time. We found that yeast Hop2–Mnd1 bound rapidly to Dmc1–ssDNA filaments with high affinity and remained bound for ∼1.3 min before dissociating. We also observed that this binding interaction was highly specific for Dmc1 and found no evidence for an association of Hop2–Mnd1 with Rad51–ssDNA or RPA–ssDNA. Our findings provide new quantitative insights into the binding dynamics of Hop2–Mnd1 with the meiotic presynaptic complex.

On the other hand, administrative data while limited in scope, have a much further reach in coverage of an entire population. However, few studies have validated the use of administrative data for identifying infections in pediatric populations. Pediatric patients from Ontario, Canada aged <18 years were randomly sampled from the Electronic Medical Record Administrative data Linked Database (EMRALD). Using physician diagnoses from the electronic medical record (EMR) as the reference standard, we determined the criterion validity of physician billing claims in administrative data for identifying infectious disease syndromes from 2012 to 2014. Diagnosis codes were assessed by infection category (respiratory, skin and soft tissue, gastrointestinal, urinary tract and otitis externa) and for all infections combined. Sensitivity analyses assessed the performance if patients had more than one reason to visit the physician. We analysed 2,139 patients and found 33.3% of all visits were for an infection, and respiratory infections accounted for 67.6% of the infections. When we combined all infection categories, sensitivity was 0.74 (95% CI 0.70-0.77), specificity was 0.95 (95% CI 0.93-0.96), positive predictive value (PPV) was 0.87 (95% CI 0.84-0.90), and negative predictive value (NPV) was 0.88 (95% CI 0.86-0.89). For respiratory infections, sensitivity was 0.77 (95% CI 0.73-0.81), specificity was 0.96 (95% CI 0.95-0.97), PPV was 0.85 (95% CI 0.81-0.88), and NPV was 0.94 (95% CI 0.92-0.95). Similar performance was observed for skin and soft tissue, gastrointestinal, urinary tract, and otitis externa infections, but with lower sensitivity. Performance measures were highest when the patient visited the physician with only one health complaint. We found when using linked EMR data as the reference standard, administrative billing codes are reasonably accurate in identifying infections in a pediatric population."
https://openalex.org/W2900647542,"Anaplastic thyroid cancer (ATC) is a rare and lethal human malignancy with no known effective therapies in the majority of cases. Despite the use of conventional treatments such as chemotherapy, radiation and surgical resection, this disease remains almost universally fatal. In the present study, we identified the JAK2 inhibitor Lestaurtinib as a potent compound when testing against 13 ATC cell lines. Lestaurtinib demonstrated a potent antiproliferative effect in vitro at nanomolar concentrations. Furthermore, Lestaurtinib impeded cell migration and the ability to form colonies from single cells using scratch-wound and colony formation assays, respectively. Flow cytometry was used for cell cycle analysis following drug treatment and demonstrated arrest at the G2/M phase of the cell cycle, indicative of a cytostatic effect. In vivo studies using the chick chorioallantoic membrane xenograft models demonstrated that treatment with Lestaurtinib resulted in a significant decrease in endpoint tumor volume and vascularity using power Doppler ultrasound imaging. Overall, this study provides evidence that Lestaurtinib is a potent antiproliferative agent with potential antiangiogenic activity that warrants further investigation as a targeted therapy for ATC."
https://openalex.org/W2901142539,"Mind wandering (MW) is extremely common during driving and is often accompanied by performance losses. This study investigated the use of driving behavior measurements to automatically detect mind wandering state in the driving task. In the experiment, participants (N = 40) performed a car-following task in a driving simulator and reported, upon hearing a tone, whether they were experiencing mind wandering or not. Supervised machine learning techniques were applied to classify MW-absent versus MW-present state, using both driver-independent and driver-dependent modeling methods. In the driver-independent modeling, we separately built models for participants with high or low MW and participants with medium MW. The optimal models can not offer a significant improvement than other models. So building effective driver-independent models with the leave-one-participant-out cross-validation method is challenging. In the driver-dependent modeling, we built models for each participant with medium MW. The best models of some participants were effective. The results indicate the development of mind wandering detecting system should take into account both inter-individual and intra-individual difference. This study provides a step toward minimizing the negative impacts of mindless driving and should benefit other fields of psychological research."
https://openalex.org/W2901343757,"Background and purpose Despite a recent shift in school going adolescents’ engagement in health compromising behaviours and their related socio-economic implications on developing societies, it is surprising that baseline information for planned interventions is sparse. The purpose of this study was to investigate the prevalence of alcohol drinking and related behaviours among in-school adolescents in the Junior High Schools (JHS) in the Central Region of Ghana. Methods and results Descriptive cross-sectional design was employed with multistage sampling procedures to sample 1400 school going adolescents in JHS in the Central Region. Preliminary findings using simple frequencies and percentages revealed 42% alcohol drinking prevalence in the region. High prevalence of drunkenness (73%, n = 406) and early exposure to alcohol drinking when students were in primary school (52%, n = 286) were noted. Community festivals and use of alcohol as a form of medicine were enabling factors of alcohol consumption in the region. Binary logistic regression analysis also showed that geographical location was a significant predictor of alcohol drinking among school going adolescents, with students in the southern and central part of the region at greater risks of drinking alcohol than those from the northern part (OR = .696, 95% CI = 0.52–926, p = .013). However, no statistical significant variations were found in the odds of drinking alcohol for age (OR = 1.13, 95% CI = 0.86–1.48, p = .370), gender (OR = .81, 95% CI = 0.65–1.01, p = .06), religious affiliation (OR = 1.33, 95% CI = 0.94–1.89, p = .10), parental communication (OR = .86, 95% CI = 0.66–1.06, p = .13), academic performance (OR = 1.07, 95% CI = 0.79–1.45, p = .05) and socioeconomic status (OR = 1.20, 95% CI = 0.95–1.53, p = .12). Conclusions With this baseline data, it was recommended that schools’ curricula should include preventive cognitive-behavioural interventions that teach drug resistance skills and anti-drug norms. These interventions would foster the development of requisite knowledge and social skills (e.g., developing competence) for resisting social and peer influences that may trigger alcohol use and perhaps other drugs. Potentially, the motivation for alcohol use among school going adolescents in the region would be minimized, if not prevented."

STEC was isolated from 153/521 (30%) reported HUS cases: 45 serogroup O80, 46 O157 and 62 other serogroups. Median ages were 1.1 years, 4.0 years and 1.8 years, respectively.

They were also less likely to report previous contact with a person presenting with diarrhea/HUS than patients infected with other serogroups (aOR 0.13 95%CI 0.02–0.78). STEC O80 spread all over France among young children less exposed to known risk factors of O157 or other STEC infections, suggesting the existence of different reservoirs and transmission patterns."
https://openalex.org/W2901774185,"Objectives This study aimed to examine the potential of combining routine tuberculosis (TB) surveillance and demographic and socioeconomic variables into the Geographic Information System (GIS) to describe the geographical distribution of TB notified incidence in relation to distances to health services as well as local demographic and socioeconomic factors, including population density, urban/rural status, and household poverty rates in Nam Dinh, Vietnam. It also aimed to compare the conventional Generalized Linear Models (GLM) Poisson regression model and Geographically Weighted Poisson Regression (GWPR) models in order to determine the best fitting model that can be used to investigate the relationship between TB notified incidence and distances and the social risk factors. Methods The data of new and relapse patients with all forms of TB aged ≥15 years residing in Nam Dinh (Vietnam) from 2012 to 2015 were collected from the Administration of Medical Services’ (Ministry of Health of Vietnam) TB surveillance database. Data on the population and household poverty rates from 2012 to 2015 were gathered from the Nam Dinh Statistical Office. Distances between communes and the nearest TB diagnostic facilities in districts were computed. The TB notified incidence per 100,000 population was denoted by indirect age and sex standardized incidence ratio. GLM Poisson regression and GWPR were performed to assess the relationship between distance and TB incidence. Results The average notified TB incidence level measured from 2012 to 2015 is 82 per 100,000 population (range: 79-84/100,000). The distance to the nearest TB diagnosis presents a negative effect on TB notified incidence. By capturing spatial heterogeneity, the GWPR may be better at fitting data (corrected Aikake information criterion [AICc] = 245.71, residual deviance = 221.12) than the traditional GLM (AICc = 251.53, residual deviance = 241.21) Conclusions GIS technologies benefit TB surveillance system. Distances should be considered when planning methods of improving access for those who live far from TB diagnostic services, thereby improving TB detection. Additional studies must confirm the association between geographic distance and TB case detection and must explore other factors that may affect TB notified incidence."
https://openalex.org/W2900671713,"Aristaless-related homeobox (ARX) gene encodes a paired-type homeodomain transcription factor with critical roles in development. Here we identify that ARX protein is phosphorylated. Using mass spectrometry and in vitro kinase assays we identify phosphorylation at serines 37, 67 and 174. Through yeast-2-hybrid and CoIP we identified PICK1 (Protein interacting with C kinase 1) binding with the C-terminal region of ARX. PICK1 is a scaffold protein known to facilitate phosphorylation of protein partners by protein kinase C alpha (PRKCA). We confirm that ARX is phosphorylated by PRKCA and demonstrate phosphorylation at serine 174. We demonstrate that phosphorylation is required for correct transcriptional activity of the ARX protein using transcriptome-wide analysis of gene expression of phospho-null mutants (alanines replacing serines) compared to ARX wild-type (ARX-WT) overexpressed in pancreatic alpha TC cells. Compared to untransfected cells, ARX-WT overexpression significantly altered expression of 70 genes (Log2FC >+/-1.0, P-value <0.05). There were fewer genes with significantly altered expression compared to untransfected cells with the double phospho-null mutant Ser37Ala+Ser67Ala (26%) and Ser174Ala (39%), respectively. We demonstrate that the c-terminal region of ARX required to bind PICK1 causes a shift in PICK1 subcellular localisation to the nucleus to co-locate with the ARX protein, and truncation of this C-terminal region leads to the same loss of transcriptional activation as S174A mutant. In conclusion, we show that ARX is phosphorylated at several sites and that this modification affects its transcriptional activity."

Because of their remarkable metal-scavenging properties and ease in crossing cellular envelopes, siderophores hold great potential in biotechnological applications, raising the need for a deeper knowledge of the molecular mechanisms underpinning the siderophore pathway. Here, we report the structural and functional characterization of a siderophore-interacting protein from the marine bacterium Shewanella frigidimarina NCIBM400 (SfSIP). SfSIP is a flavin-containing ferric-siderophore reductase with FAD- and NAD(P)H-binding domains that have high homology with other characterized SIPs. However, we found here that it mechanistically departs from what has been described for this family of proteins. Unlike other FAD-containing SIPs, SfSIP did not discriminate between NADH and NADPH. Furthermore, SfSIP required the presence of the Fe2+-scavenger, ferrozine, to use NAD(P)H to drive the reduction of Shewanella-produced hydroxamate ferric-siderophores. Additionally, this is the first SIP reported that also uses a ferredoxin as electron donor, and in contrast to NAD(P)H, its utilization did not require the mediation of ferrozine, and electron transfer occurred at fast rates. Finally, FAD oxidation was thermodynamically coupled to deprotonation at physiological pH values, enhancing the solubility of ferrous iron. On the basis of these results and the location of the SfSIP gene downstream of a sequence for putative binding of aerobic respiration control protein A (ArcA), we propose that SfSIP contributes an additional layer of regulation that maintains cellular iron homeostasis according to environmental cues of oxygen availability and cellular iron demand.

https://openalex.org/W2901428716,"Many pharmaceuticals have negative effects on biota when released into the environment. For example, recent work has shown that the commonly prescribed antidiabetic drug, metformin (N,N-dimethylbiguanide), has endocrine disrupting effects on fish. However, effects of metformin on aquatic primary producers are poorly known. We exposed cultured isolates of a freshwater chlorophyte, Chlorella vulgaris, to a range of metformin concentrations (0-767.9 mg L-1) to test the hypothesis that exposure negatively affects photosynthesis and growth. A cessation of growth, increase in non-photochemical quenching (NPQ, NPQmax), and reduced electron transport rate (ETR) were observed 24 h after exposure to a metformin concentration of 767.8 mg L-1 (4.6 mM). By 48 h, photosynthetic efficiency of photosystem II (Fv/Fm), α, the initial slope of the ETR-irradiance curve, and Ek (minimum irradiance required to saturate photosynthesis) were reduced. At a lower concentration (76.8 mg L-1), negative effects on photosynthesis (increase in NPQ, decrease in ETR) were delayed, occurring between 72 and 96 h. No negative effects on photosynthesis were observed at an exposure concentration of 1.5 mg L-1. It is likely that metformin impairs photosynthesis either through downstream effects from inhibition of complex I of the electron transport chain or via activation of the enzyme, SnRK1 (sucrose non-fermenting-related kinase 1), which acts as a cellular energy regulator in plants and algae and is an ortholog of the mammalian target of metformin, AMPK (5' adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase)."

In addition, the collection of experimental data can be time consuming and costly. This paper covers both these issues by addressing the following question: ""Which experimental outputs should be measured to ensure that unique model parameters can be calculated?"". Stated formally, we examine the topic of minimal output sets that guarantee a model's structural identifiability. To that end, we introduce an algorithm that guides a researcher as to which model outputs to measure. Our algorithm consists of an iterative structural identifiability analysis and can determine multiple minimal output sets of a model. This choice in different output sets offers researchers flexibility during experimental design. Our method can determine minimal output sets of large differential equation models within short computational times."
https://openalex.org/W2900450547,"Researchers have investigated the factors that influence environmental behavior for decades. Two often-investigated phenomena, connectedness to nature and self-efficacy, often correlate with environmental behavior, yet researchers rarely analyze those correlations along with underlying cultural factors. We suggest that this is a substantial oversight and hypothesize that cultural factors affect environmental behavior, particularly through an interplay with the connectedness to nature and self-efficacy constructs. To test this hypothesis, we surveyed eighth-grade students on the island of Hawaiʻi. The instrument included items to assess connectedness to nature and self-efficacy (both frequently measured in environmental behavior studies) and multiple measures of behavior. Most of the behavior measures are commonly used in studies of environmental behavior, and one was developed in collaboration with local partners to reflect more culturally specific modes of environmental behavior. With those partners, we also developed a construct reflecting the relevance of local culture. We explored the relative influence of the more commonly investigated constructs (connectedness to nature, behavioral variables) along with the newer construct (cultural relevance). We found that, when we took those considerations into account, cultural relevance significantly predicted connectedness to nature, self-efficacy, and a commonly used behavioral measure. Our results thus suggest that many models of environmental behavior may be misspecified when they omit critical culture- and ethnicity-related factors. This may be particularly important in contexts with high cultural, racial, and ethnic diversity or in contexts where mainstream Western environmental approaches are non-dominant. Our results emphasize the importance of addressing ethnicity and culture in environmental thought and action."

Pulps of the left maxillary first molars were accessed. In the CFA group, the pulps were exposed, and CFA application was followed by dental sealing. In the open group, the pulps were left exposed to the oral cavity. For the closed group, the pulps were exposed, and the teeth were immediately sealed. Naïve rats were used as negative controls. Several parameters were evaluated at 1, 2, 3 and 8 days. There was no statistical significant difference among the groups when body weight variation, food or water consumption were compared. Analysis of serum cytokines (IL-1β, TNF or IL-6) or differential blood cell counts did not reveal any evidence of systemic inflammation. The CFA group displayed a significant reduction in the locomotor activity (at 1 and 3 days), associated with an increased activation of satellite glial cells in the ipsilateral trigeminal ganglion (TG; for up to 8 days). Amygdala astrocyte activation was unaffected in any experimental groups. We provide novel evidence indicating that CFA-induced pulp inflammation impaired the locomotor activity, with persistent activation of ipsilateral TG satellite cells surrounding sensory neurons, without any evidence of systemic inflammation or amygdala astrogliosis."

A total of 12,560 simple sequence repeat (SSR) markers, developed by Southwest University, thus coded SWU were screened out of which only 994 were found to be polymorphic, and 849 markers were linked in all the 13 chromosomes. The map had a length of 1,012.458 cM with an average marker distance of 1.193 cM. Segregation distortion regions (SDRs) were observed on Chr01, Chr02, Chr06, Chr07 Chr09, Chr10 and Chr11 with a large proportion of the SDR regions segregating towards the heterozygous allele. There was good syntenic block formation that revealed good collinearity between the genetic and physical map of G. raimondii, compared to the Dt_sub genome of the G. hirsutum and G. barbadense. A total of 2,496 genes were mined within the SSR related regions. The proteins encoding the mined genes within the SDR had varied physiochemical properties; their molecular weights ranged from 6.586 to 252.737 kDa, charge range of -39.5 to 52, grand hydropathy value (GRAVY) of -1.177 to 0.936 and isoelectric (pI) value of 4.087 to 12.206. The low GRAVY values detected showed that the proteins encoding these genes were hydrophilic in nature, a property common among the stress responsive genes. The RNA sequence analysis revealed more of the genes were highly upregulated in various stages of fiber development for instance; Gorai.002G241300 was highly up regulated at 5, 10, 20 and 25 day post anthesis (DPA). Validation through RT-qPCR further revealed that these genes mined within the SDR regions might be playing a significant role under fiber development stages, therefore we infer that Gorai.007G347600 (TFCA), Gorai.012G141600 (FOLB1), Gorai.006G024500 (NMD3), Gorai.002G229900 (LST8) and Gorai.002G235200 (NSA2) are significantly important in fiber development and in turn the quality, and further researches needed to be done to elucidate their exact roles in the fiber development process. The construction of the genetic map between the two wild species paves away for the mapping of quantitative trait loci (QTLs) since the average distance between the markers is small, and mining of genes on the SSR regions will provide an insight in identifying key genes that can be introgressed into the cultivated cotton cultivars."
https://openalex.org/W2901610961,"Previous studies showed that emotional faces break through interocular suppression more easily compared to neutral faces under the continuous flash suppression (CFS) paradigm. However, there is controversy over whether emotional content or low-level properties contributed to the results. In this study, we directly manipulated the meaningfulness of facial expression to test the role of emotional content in breaking CFS (b-CFS). In addition, an explicit emotion judgment for different facial expressions (happy, neutral, and fearful) used in the b-CFS task was also conducted afterwards to examine the relationship between b-CFS time and emotion judgment. In Experiment 1, face orientation and luminance polarity were manipulated to generate upright-positive and inverted-negative faces. In Experiment 2, Asian and Caucasian faces were presented to Taiwanese participants so that these stimuli served as own-race and other-race faces, respectively. We found robust face familiarity effects in both experiments within the same experimental framework: upright-positive and own-race faces had shorter b-CFS times than inverted-negative and other-race faces, respectively. This indicates potential involvement of high-level processing under interocular suppression. In Experiment 1, different b-CFS times were found between emotional and neutral faces in both upright-positive and inverted-negative conditions. Furthermore, with sufficient duration (1000 ms) participants could still extract emotional content in explicit valence judgment even from inverted-negative faces, though with a smaller degree than upright-positive faces. In Experiment 2, differential b-CFS times were found between emotional and neutral faces with own-race but not other-race faces. Correlation analyses from both experiments showed that the magnitude of emotion judgment was correlated with b-CFS time only for familiar (upright-positive / own-race) but not unfamiliar (inverted-negative / other-race) faces. These results suggest that emotional content can be extracted under interocular suppression with familiar faces, and low-level properties in unfamiliar faces may play a major role in the b-CFS time."
https://openalex.org/W2901627146,"Bioluminescence of a variety of marine organisms, mostly cnidarians and ctenophores, is carried out by Ca2+-dependent photoproteins. The mechanism of light emission operates via the same reaction in both animal families. Despite numerous studies on the ctenophore photoprotein family, the detailed catalytic mechanism and arrangement of amino acid residues surrounding the chromophore in this family are a mystery. Here, we report the crystal structure of Cd2+-loaded apo-mnemiopsin1, a member of the ctenophore family, at 2.15 A resolution and used quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics (QM/MM) to investigate its reaction mechanism. The simulations suggested that an Asp-156-Arg-39-Tyr-202 triad creates a hydrogen-bonded network to facilitate the transfer of a proton from the 2-hydroperoxy group of the chromophore coelenterazine to bulk solvent. We identified a water molecule in the coelenteramide-binding cavity that forms a hydrogen bond with the amide nitrogen atom of coelenteramide, which, in turn, is hydrogen-bonded via another water molecule to Tyr-131. This observation supports the hypothesis that the function of the coelenteramide-bound water molecule is to catalyze the 2-hydroperoxycoelenterazine decarboxylation reaction by protonation of a dioxetanone anion, thereby triggering the bioluminescence reaction in the ctenophore photoprotein family."
https://openalex.org/W2901393121,"Despite the high HIV prevalence among men who have sex with men (MSM) and transgender women (TGW), there are limited data on progress on their respective HIV antiretroviral treatment (ART) cascades to identify progress and gaps in meeting UNAIDS 90-90-90 targets. We conducted a respondent-driven sampling survey of MSM and TGW in Bamako, Mali from October 2014 to February 2015. We describe the HIV treatment cascade for MSM and TGW, identify correlates of being unaware of HIV-infected status and having unsuppressed viral load levels, and estimate proportion of recent infections. We enrolled 387 MSM and 165 TGW. HIV prevalence was 13.7%. Of those living with HIV, 10.4% were aware of their serostatus, 61.2% of them self-reported being on treatment, and of them, 100% were virally suppressed. In multivariate analysis, factors associated with being unaware of HIV infection included not using free condoms in the last six months (aOR: 5.7, 95% CI: 1.1–29.5) and not having comprehensive knowledge of HIV (aOR: 6.5, 95% CI: 1.4–29.9). Having unsuppressed viral load was associated with identifying as a transgender woman (aOR: 4.8, 95% CI: 1.1–20.7) and not having comprehensive knowledge of HIV (aOR: 6.5, 95% CI: 1.0–40.9). Of the 79 HIV-positive participants, 5.1% had recent infections. While the proportion aware of their HIV status was low despite adjusting for viral load biomarkers, all MSM and TGW on treatment were virally suppressed. Improved testing strategies are urgently needed to achieve the first 90 of the HIV cascade among MSM and TGW in Bamako."
https://openalex.org/W2900998719,"The oral obligate anaerobe Porphyromonas gingivalis possesses a small conserved transcript PG_RS02100 of unknown function we previously identified using small RNA-seq analysis as expressed during logarithmic growth. In this study, we sought to determine if PG_RS02100 plays a role in P. gingivalis growth or stress response. We show that a PG_RS02100 deletion mutant’s (W83Δ514) ability to grow under anaerobic conditions was no different than wildtype (W83), but it was better able to survive hydrogen peroxide exposure when cultured under heme limiting growth conditions, and was more aerotolerant when plated on enriched whole blood agar and exposed to atmospheric oxygen. Together, these results indicate that PG_RS02100 plays a role in surviving oxidative stress in actively growing P. gingivalis and that P. gingivalis’ response to exogenous hydrogen peroxide stress is linked to heme availability. Relative qRT-PCR expression analysis of oxyR, trx-1, tpx, sodB, ahpC, dinF, cydB, and frd, in W83Δ514 and W83 in response to 1 h exogenous dioxygen or hydrogen peroxide exposure, when cultured with varying heme availability, support our phenotypic evidence that W83Δ514 has a more highly primed defense system against exogenous peroxide, dioxygen, and heme generated ROS. Interestingly, W83Δ514 turned black faster than W83 when cultured on whole blood agar, suggesting it was able to accumulate heme more rapidly. The mechanism of increased heme acquisition observed in W83Δ514 is not yet known. However, it is clear that PG_RS02100 is involved in modulating the P. gingivalis cell surface in a manner related to survival, particularly against oxidative stress."
https://openalex.org/W2901262550,"Anti-plasminogen antibodies (α-PLG) were previously detected in a subpopulation of anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (ANCA)-associated vasculitis (AAV) patients, showing a relation to renal lesions and outcome. Several studies showed different proportions of α-PLG positive AAV patients, possibly due to differences in the assays used. We here present a new, optimized α-PLG Enzyme-Linked Immuno Sorbent Assay (ELISA) and validate the presence of α-PLG in AAV. Different ELISA set-ups were tested regarding plasminogen (PLG) antigen, concentrations, coating buffers, blocking agents, and environmental conditions. Purified lysine-PLG (lys-PLG) showed better differentiation between positive samples and negative samples than glutamic acid-PLG (glu-PLG). Therefore, lys-PLG was used as coating antigen. With the optimized α-PLG ELISA we found α-PLG in 14.3% of the myeloperoxidase (MPO)-ANCA patients, whereas all our proteinase-3 (PR3)-ANCA patients tested in our new assay were negative. Concluding, in this study we have combined important technical findings and methods from previous studies to optimize the α-PLG assay, which can be used for future research purposes and will aid in uniform reporting of α-PLG status of patients."
https://openalex.org/W2901552935,"SCN5A encodes the main subunit of the NaV1.5 channel, which mediates the fast Na+ current responsible for generating cardiac action potentials. The single nucleotide polymorphism SCN5A(R1193Q), which results in an amino acid replacement in the subunit, is common in East Asia. SCN5A(R1193Q) is often identified in patients with type 3 long QT syndrome and Brugada syndrome. However, its linkage to arrhythmic disorders is under debate. Previous electrophysiological studies performed at room temperature inconsistently reported the gain- or loss-of-function effect of SCN5A(R1193Q) on the NaV1.5 channel. More recently, it was theoretically predicted that SCN5A(R1193Q) would exert a loss-of-function effect at body temperature. Here, we experimentally assessed whether SCN5A(R1193Q) modulates the NaV1.5 channel at various temperatures including normal and febrile body temperatures. We compared voltage-gated Na+ currents in SCN5A(R1193Q)-transfected and wild-type SCN5A-transfected HEK293T cells using a whole-cell voltage-clamp technique. First, we made comparisons at constant temperatures of 25°C, 36.5°C, and 38°C, and found no difference in the conductance density, voltage dependence of gating, or time dependence of gating. This suggested that SCN5A(R1193Q) does not modulate the NaV1.5 channel regardless of temperature. Second, we made comparisons while varying the temperature from 38°C to 26°C in 3 min, and again observed no difference in the time course of the amplitude or time dependence of gating during the temperature change. This also indicated that SCN5A(R1193Q) does not modulate the NaV1.5 channel in response to an acute body temperature change. Therefore, SCN5A(R1193Q) may not be a monogenic factor that triggers arrhythmic disorders."
https://openalex.org/W2901744068,"According to hedonic pricing theory (HPT) market forces operate on individual characteristics of a good, and the price of a product is the aggregate of the price across those characteristics. The relationship between price and characteristics remains poorly understood because characteristic qualities are hard to quantify, people have varying levels of information about characteristics, and people have heterogeneous preferences over characteristics. By analyzing data from a large, market-driven virtual world we are able to test HPT, while largely avoiding these pitfalls. We find that a linear model with functional characteristics predicts the prices poorly, but a log-linear model performs quite well. Adding social characteristics to this log-linear model improves the predictions substantially. This work strongly supports HPT and demonstrates a ""rational"" calculus including social value."
https://openalex.org/W2901906881,"Phylogenomics and genome scale positive selection analyses were performed on 29 Corynebacterium pseudotuberculosis genomes that were isolated from different hosts, including representatives of the Ovis and Equi biovars. A total of 27 genes were identified as undergoing adaptive changes. An analysis of the clades within this species and these biovars, the genes specific to each branch, and the genes responding to selective pressure show clear differences, indicating that adaptation and specialization is occurring in different clades. These changes are often correlated with the isolation host but could indicate responses to some undetermined factor in the respective niches. The fact that some of these more-rapidly evolving genes have homology to known virulence factors, antimicrobial resistance genes and drug targets shows that this type of analysis could be used to identify novel targets, and that these could be used as a way to control this pathogen."
https://openalex.org/W2900883576,"Pathology images are color in nature due to the use of chemical staining in biopsy examination. Aware of the high color diagnosticity in pathology images, this work introduces a compact rotation-invariant texture descriptor, named quantized diagnostic counter-color pattern (QDCP), for digital pathology image understanding. On the basis of color similarity quantified by the inner product of unit-length color vectors, local counter-color textons are indexed first. Then the underlined distribution of QDCP indexes is estimated by an image-wise histogram. Since QDCP is computed based on color difference directly, it is robust to small color variation usually observed in pathology images. This study also discusses QDCP’s extraction, parameter settings, and feature fusion techniques in a generic pathology image analysis pipeline, and introduces two more descriptors QDCP-LBP and QDCP/LBP. Experimentation on public pathology image sets suggests that the introduced color texture descriptors, especially QDCP-LBP, outperform prior color texture features in terms of strong descriptive power, low computational complexity, and high adaptability to different image sets."
https://openalex.org/W2901724896,"This study reports on the direct drive volume control flange-type rotary vane steering gear (DDVC-FRVSG), a promising component with superior advantages of compact structure, powerful vibration absorption, and simple control for application in the controlling course and posture of a vessel. The ability of the DDVC-FRVSG to satisfy the accuracy requirement of the vessel is limited by nonlinear friction. This study proposes two compensation methods to compensate for the nonlinear friction. We establish the mathematical model and the transfer function of the steering gear system and the mathematical model of nonlinear friction on the DDVC-FRVSG system based on the principle of the DDVC-FRVSG. A high-gain proportional-integral-derivative control strategy and another method using the self-adaption robust control strategy is proposed and studied both theoretically and experimentally to suppress the nonlinear friction. With the ""no-compensation state"" as a benchmark, our measured results by prototype testing has proved that both methods can compensate for the nonlinear friction, with the second method showing a better performance of up to 78.85% increase compared to that of the 41.65% shown by the first one. The outcome of this research will contribute to the rapidity and stability of the DDVC-FRVSG."

https://openalex.org/W2901963374,"India has scaled-up antiretroviral treatment (ART) in public sector facilities, but data to understand time trends of average cost of ART are limited.Cost and output data were collected at all public sector ART centres in undivided Andhra Pradesh (high-HIV burden state) and Rajasthan (low-HIV burden state) in India from fiscal year 2007-2008 to 2012-2013. Average cost per patient for first-line ART, and its relation with scale of services, were assessed. Using data on scale of services, the average cost was estimated up to 2015-2016. Break-even point was estimated from average and marginal cost functions. Costs were adjusted to 2015 constant price.The average cost per patient alive and on ART in 2015-2016 was US$162 in undivided Andhra Pradesh and US$186 in Rajasthan, which was 51.4% and 35.8% lower than in 2007-2008, respectively. Average ART drug cost declined by 27.2% during this period, and was 70.9% and 61.5% of the total ART cost in the two states in 2015-2016. The average cost other than ART drugs declined by 73.1% and 45.7%, with the number of patients served increasing 7 and 14.2 times, respectively. Average cost other than ART drugs had a significant negative relation with scale (R2 = 86.4%-82.8%, p<0.001). Break-even analysis suggested that 47.5% and 58.8% of the ART centres in undivided Andhra Pradesh and Rajasthan, respectively, were functioning below optimal scale in 2015-2016. The estimated total economic cost of first-line ART services provided in the public sector in India in fiscal year 2015-2016 was US$ 151 million; it would be US$ 216.1 million to provide this to all eligible persons in India.The average cost of providing first-line ART has declined in India, and further reduction is possible if the optimal scale of services is achieved. These findings can inform resource requirement for the ART programme in India."
