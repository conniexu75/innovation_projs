https://openalex.org/W2018291059,"DESCRIBING histological demonstration of mucin after periodic acid, McManus1 states that a positive reaction is given, inter alia, by certain pituitary and the colloid of pituitary stalk. According to Chow2, follicle-stimulating and luteinizing fractions of anterior pituitary secretion are glycoproteins, and Evans et al.3 confirm that former contains 10·3–13·1 per cent carbohydrate and 8 per cent glucosamine. According to K. Meyer‘s classification, it is thus a mucoprotein, that is, it contains more than 4 per cent hexosamine. Furthermore, Gurin4 has shown that chorionic gonadotropin is also a mucoprotein, containing galactose (10–12 per cent) and hexosamine (5–6 per cent) as an integral part of its molecule, and Gey et al.5 have demonstrated production of this hormone by cytotrophoblast cells in tissue culture. On contrary, Fraenkel-Conrat et al.6 have shown that growth-hormone fraction of pituitary contains only 0·25 per cent sugar and less than 0·9 per cent glucosamine."

Our present experiments had a double purpose : (1) to limit the direction of the oxidation as narrowly as possible ; (2) to work out a simple reproduction method, for our Azotobacter react with extreme sensitivity to antagonistic bacteria, so that their culture can be made only under the strictest sterile conditions."

https://openalex.org/W2051903921,"DURING work on ribonucleic acid turnover with nitrogen-15 in this Department, we found it necessary to isolate the different nitrogen-containing substances from small amounts of ribonucleic acid. It was thought that partition chromatography on starch as introduced by Elsden and Synge1 might give a possible solution to our problem. Vischer and Chargaff2 have applied partition chromatography on paper to the purine-bases; Edman, Hammarsten, Löw and Reichard3 have worked out a method for separating guanine and adenine on a starch column. Tinker and Brown4 have recently applied Craig‘s counter-current distribution technique to purines and pyrimidines and related compounds."

The object of the discussion was to consider recent results on the physiology of colour production and appreciation in animals, and the bearings of these results on theories of the biological uses of colour—in protective resemblance, mimicry, warning coloration and other ways."

https://openalex.org/W2012865574,"RECENT results by Strong1,2 and by Carr3 on mice, and by Demerec4 on Drosophila, have focused interest on a possible connexion between mutagenicity and carcinogenicity, which in the past has often been claimed on theoretical grounds. While Auerbach5 failed to produce mutations by injection of 1 : 2 : 5 : 6 dibenzanthracene into Drosophila, Demerec obtained positive results with a number of carcinogens, including dibenzanthracene and methylcholanthrene, when these were administered to the flies in the form of aerosols. Still a different possibility of administration is by addition of the carcinogen to the food of the larvæ, since fluorescence tests carried out by Fabian and Matoltsy6 have shown that methylcholanthrene given in this way enters into the gonads. An experiment using this method was under way when Demerec‘s first results Were published, and its outcome will be briefly presented. The food contained powdered methylcholanthrene in a concentration of 0·01 per cent. No live yeast was added to the culture vials, in order to avoid complications through offering the larvæ an alternative supply of untreated food. Fluorescence tests showed that methylcholanthrene or a fluorescent derivative of it had penetrated into the gonads of the imagines which emerged in the treated vials. In spite of this, no evidence for mutagenic action of methylcholanthrene was obtained in tests for sex-linked lethals. Only two lethals were found in 1,012 chromosomes from treated ♂♂ (compared with one in 1,007 control chromosomes), and three in 1,026 chromosomes from treated ♀♀ (compared with two in 1,014 control chromosomes)."
https://openalex.org/W2089753851,"E. J. MACHIN1 appears to be unaware of the extensive study by G. E. Blackman2 on the relation between plant density and percentage absence. In a theoretical appendix to this paper, I have pointed out that the most efficient size of quadrat corresponds to about 20 per cent absence, or a product of quadrat size and plant density of about 1·6 (the efficiency remains reasonable over a range of, say, 0·7–3·0, compared with the rather wider range 0·3–3·3 implied by Machin)."
https://openalex.org/W4243260718,"A DISCUSSION on the transmission of effects from the ends of nerve fibres occupied an afternoon session of Section I (Physiology) of the British Association on September 9. Sir Henry Dale introduced the discussion by saying that we may agree on the assumption that the liberation of one or another chemical substance with a specific stimulating action is the means by which, in vertebrates, nerve impulses are transmitted from the endings of all efferent fibres of the peripheral nervous system, whether pre- or post-ganglionic fibres of the involuntary nerves, or motor fibres of the voluntary nerves. But there remains a Wealth of problems still open to discussion concerning details of such a process."
https://openalex.org/W1982956433,"FOLLOWING on the description many years ago1 of a growth-inhibiting constituent of yeast, a number of plant extractives2 and pure substances3 have been reported to possess similar activity. A distinctive feature in the case of most of them is that in cultures in vitro the growth of connective tissue cells is inhibited, but not that of epithelia. From this the conclusion was drawn that such action, if exerted in vivo, would lead to the retardation of growth in young animals since this depends upon the growth of their connective tissue, without interference with the vitality of such other tissues as the skin and blood-forming organs, the cells of which continue to multiply throughout normal life. A further inference was made that the growth of tumours might similarly be inhibited, since this too depends upon a parallel growth of stroma. These expectations were, in fact, to some extent realized4, but owing to the unsatisfactory nature of the material used the experiments were unconvincing."

https://openalex.org/W2019533157,"CERTAIN strains of A. niger, as is well known, ferment sugar to citric acid to the virtual exclusion of any other acid. Strong citric acid fermentations, however, are often accompanied by the production of mould starch1 and a dextrin-like substance2. The present communication directs attention to the formation also of i-erythritol. Though this tetrahydric alcohol has already been found in two species of Penicillium, namely, P. brevi-compactum Dierckx and P. cyclopium Westling3, and in one species of Aspergillus, A. terreus4, rather surprisingly no one has hitherto reported its occurrence in cultures of A. niger."

https://openalex.org/W2062762973,"DUPERIER1 has analysed the first harmonic of the apparent solar diurnal variation of cosmic rays at London, using a method due to Thompson2. He finds that the first harmonic for any month has three components, namely, (i) a mean solar vector M, (ii) a vector, A, altering the amplitude of M, and (iii) a vector, P, controlling the change of phase of M. The P vector may arise from either (a) a sidereal diurnal variation, (b) an annual solar variation, or (c) a combination of these effects. This communication discusses the interpretation to be placed on the P vector, by comparing Duperier‘s figures for London with the results obtained at Canberra."

https://openalex.org/W2071146810,"Jiménez Díaz, Grande Covián and De Oya1 have reported that in dogs in which the vessels of both kidneys were clamped, the intravenous injection of alloxan in doses of 80–100 mgm./kgm. failed to produce either the hyperglycæmia or uræmia observed in controls in which the clamping was omitted. They postulated that ""contact between alloxan and the kidney is apparently necessary for the display of the full diabetogenic effect"". However, diabetes was observed on injecting alloxan during clamping of both renal pedicles in rats2,3 and rabbits4. Recently, Jiménez Díaz and Souto Candeira5 postulated that ""alloxan produces some kind of renal injury which accentuates diabetes. . . . In conclusion, the kidney is apparently not necessary for the production of alloxan diabetes, but renal injury produced by alloxan Would contribute to accentuate it."""
https://openalex.org/W1973559330,"A PROVISION of the Colonial Development and Welfare Act of 1945 was to earmark up to a million pounds a year for ten years from the British Treasury for research in and on behalf of the Colonial Empire, and in consequence there has been much activity both at home and overseas in designing systems which will enable these funds to be spent in the best way. The purpose of this article is not to recapitulate the work at the London end, centred on the Colonial Office, because this is summarized in the published annual reports of the Colonial Research Committee (now Council) and other advisory committees and councils concerned, and has already been noticed from time to time in Nature. The object is to describe how the new system is working out in a Colonial region, with the advice and assistance of the London authorities."

https://openalex.org/W2032686809,"DURING the course of my present investigation into the functional anatomy of the gut of Arenicola marina, I have found that Ashworth1 describes the sub-intestinal blood vessels (sinuses) along part of their length only. He states that these vessels commence just behind the heart and may be traced to the level of the twelfth setae, behind which point they disappear. In dissection, with the use of a binocular microscope, it is possible to trace out these vessels, which have been renamed the sub-enteric vessels, along the whole length of the gut. Indeed, they are visible with the naked eye. This observation I believe to be of importance as it shows that the same basic pattern underlies the blood system in all parts of the gut. Serial sections have confirmed this point."

https://openalex.org/W2073829543,"THE report of the Ministry of Health for the year ended March 31, 1947 (Cmd. 7441, pp. 1–204. London : H.M. Stationery Office, 1948. 3s. 6d. net), records, in general, another favourable bill of health. In spite of the continuance of rationing and other controls, and of the various additional ingredients of that too-familiar conception ‘austerity', the vital statistics and other features of this report suggest that austerity is not really doing the population of Britain very much harm. In the period covered by the report the birth-rate rose to 19·1 per thousand of the population, a figure which is the highest recorded since 1923 ; and the infant mortality-rate fell to 43, which is a new low record. Maternal mortality also fell to a record low level of 1·43 per thousand total births, and death-rates at ages of less than fifteen years from measles, scarlet fever, rheumatic fever and heart disease were all the lowest ever reported. The death-rate was 12·0, which is the lowest since the previous best (11·6) in 1938."

https://openalex.org/W4210569365,"MUCH of the Lambeth Conference report* deals with matters which are not the immediate concern of men of science as such ; but two of the committee reports and certain passages in the Encyclical Letter are of interest in view of the increasing concern of the scientific world with the ethical aspects of atomic warfare, and of the attempts being made to formulate a professional code on the lines of the Hippocratic Oath. Moreover, a number of men of science have taken a prominent part in the movement to formulate a declaration of human rights, and on this also the report has something of interest to say. Thus even if their interest is indirect and by virtue of their citizenship rather than their professional activities, scientific workers cannot be altogether indifferent to any document that in any degree helps to clarify thought on the moral and spiritual values that form the real foundation for any attempt at union of the Western democracies. The frankness, clarity and logic of the whole report will indeed commend it to many outside the Anglican Communion, even if they do not always accept its premises or draw the same conclusions, at least without some reservations. The final invitation to all men and women to join in the war against the evils which wreck man‘s life and against the false creeds which debase it will be welcomed by many men of science."
https://openalex.org/W4243580408,"DURING the last few years, an air of dissatisfaction has become apparent in some quarters over the adequacy of the orthodox colour vision theories to explain the facts. There has even been some dispute about the facts themselves ; but there is at least agreement that since one wave-length can be distinguished from another by its colour, some mechanism of colour discrimination must exist in the retina. All the theories have something in common, in that they all assume that there must be more than one type of receptor in the retina, the types differing, inter alia, in their spectral sensitivity. Given these different receptor types and assuming that they can send messages to the brain which give rise to distinctive colour sensations, then we evidently have the essential ingredients for a colour discrimination mechanism. Current argument is largely concerned with the probable number of these distinctive receptors, ranging from the two anatomically distinct types as suggested by Dr. E. N. Willmer on histological grounds to seven as postulated by Prof. H. Hartridge in his polychromatic theory. Three has previously been the most popular figure—a choice stemming from colour-mixture experiments."
https://openalex.org/W4252963933,"THE system of notation of organic chemical compounds described by Dr. G. M. Dyson has quickly been followed by a second, and those who missed the original lecture in Birmingham last October will now be able to study at leisure what Messrs. Gordon,Kendall and Davison describe as a universal notation covering inorganic and organic chemistry and the chemistry of ions, free radicals and transition complexes (""Chemical Ciphering. ""Pp. 46. London : Royal Institute of Chemistry. 4s. net). The claims are thus even larger than those of Dr. Dyson, and a logical proof of the validity of the ciphering is appended, given the definition of a chemical species as a set of atoms individually stated, in which given pairs of these atoms are linked together by directed bonds and the net charge of the set, and of any discrete ions contained in it, are specified. The authors claim, moreover, that the system is expressed in the language of ""basic chemistry"", and in accord with modern trends in the theory of molecular structure. Whether the system can be mastered by a chemist in about an hour, as they also claim, is at least doubtful ; and if they under-estimate the intellectual effort required to comprehend and apply their system, they have probably also under-estimated the willingness of chemists as a body to make such an effort."
