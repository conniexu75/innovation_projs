https://openalex.org/W2022211160,"Recent advances in DNA synthesis methods have made it possible to carry out single-crystal x-ray analyses of double-stranded DNA molecules of predetermined sequence, with 4 to 12 base pairs. At least one example has been examined from each of the three known families of DNA helix: A, B, and Z. Each family has its own intrinsic restrictions on chain folding and structure. The observed solvent positions in these crystal structures have confirmed earlier fiber and solution measurements, and have led to proposals explaining the transitions from B to A and from B to Z helices. Prospects are improving for an understanding of the mode of bending of DNA in chromatin, and the way in which specific DNA sequences are recognized by drug molecules and repressor proteins."

This five-step procedure represents a 500,000-fold purification over serum. 6.4 ng/ml (2 X 10(-10) M) of purified platelet-derived growth factor stimulated DNA synthesis in quiescent, density arrested cultures of Swiss 3T3 cells to a level equivalent to that produced by 5% calf serum. The growth-promoting activity and specific binding to 3T3 cells has been shown to be associated with four entities of molecular weights: 31,000, 29,000, 28,500, and 27,000, as determined by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis under nonreducing conditions. In the presence of 2-mercaptoethanol, the four molecular species are converted to three inactive chains of lower molecular weights: 17,500, 16,000, and 14,400. Other methods of chemically cleaving the disulfide bonds were investigated: reductive cleavage by S-sulfonation, reductive cleavage with dithiothreitol, and performic acid oxidation. In all cases, mitogenic activity was reduced by 80-100%. Attempts to restore mitogenic activity after reduction were unsuccessful. Two-dimensional 125I-peptide mapping of the nonreduced and reduced multiple forms was also investigated. The four nonreduced moieties gave basically identical maps. The maps of the reduced 17,500- and 16,000-dalton chains were also essentially identical, but the map of the reduced 14,400-dalton chain was significantly different. We propose that platelet-derived growth factor consists of two polypeptide chains: a 14,400-dalton chain and either a 17,500- or a 16,000-dalton chain."

https://openalex.org/W1568843108,"Addition of 10 to 100 oligodeoxycytidylate residues to the 3'-OH termini of T7 bacteriophage DNA produces a highly efficient template for transcription in vitro with purified calf thymus RNA polymerase II. Transcription initiates rapidly and selectively at the oligo (dC) ends of such a template and essentially all of the active RNA polymerase II molecules are then committed to a long period of RNA chain elongation. This allows the direct study of the RNA chain elongation and termination reactions and also permits determination of the concentration of active RNA polymerase II that is present. From 15 to 25% of the RNA polymerase molecules in our current preparations are active in these reactions. RNA chain elongation by calf thymus RNA polymerase II is relatively slow (7 nucleotides/s) even at saturating substrate concentrations. The in vitro elongation process appears to be discontinuous, with elongating polymerase molecules pausing for significant periods at certain sequences along the DNA. There is a low, but measurable frequency of RNA chain termination at some sites; however, the majority of elongating transcripts can grow to large sizes (over 6000 nucleotides). Surprisingly, over 60% of the active calf thymus RNA polymerase II molecules form a long DNA-RNA hybrid during in vitro transcription and displace the nontranscribed DNA from the template to produce a characteristic split end structure. DNA-RNA hybrids are also formed during transcription by RNA polymerase II from duplex DNA templates lacking 3' oligo(dC) tails, which takes place predominantly at single strand breaks or ends. Thus the transcriptional elongation reaction carried out by calf thymus RNA polymerase II in vitro differs in several respects from that which must take place in vivo."

https://openalex.org/W2075767823,"A new approach, using neutron diffraction and the hydrogen exchange (H/D) technique, has been used to study the extent and nature of the inherent conformational fluctuations in the protein, trypsin. The observed pattern of exchange was used to investigate systematic relationships between exchangeable sites and structural and chemical properties of the molecule. Results of this analysis indicate that hydrogen-bonding structure is the dominant factor governing rates of exchange. The model of conformational mobility which best explains the experimental findings involves a localized disruption of the secondary structure within different regions of the protein molecule, each limited in extent to the breaking of a small number of hydrogen bonds."
https://openalex.org/W1507264433,"In the absence of organic substrates, chloroperoxidase catalyzes the peroxidation of chloride and bromide ion to molecular chlorine and bromine. However, these molecular species are not formed as intermediates in the enzymic halogenation of organic halogen-acceptor substrates. The rate of oxidation of chloride to its respective molecular species is considerably slower than the rate of enzymic chlorination of acceptor substrates. Furthermore, differences are observed in substrate specificities between enzymic and chemical halogenation reactions. Thiourea and methionine are substrates in chloride-dependent oxidation reactions catalyzed by chloroperoxidase and are preferred at least 50:1 and 30:1 respectively over 2- chlorodimedone. Corresponding nonenzymic reaction preferences for the oxidation of thiourea versus 2-chlorodimedone chlorination are only 2:1 with hypochlorite and 3:1 with molecular chlorine. Also, hypochlorite shows essentially no preference for methionine compared with 2-chlorodimedone. In the bromide-dependent reactions catalyzed by chloroperoxidase, bromine is formed at a rate equivalent to that of the bromination of acceptor substrates. However, the specificity of the bromide-dependent oxidation of methionine versus the bromination of 2-chlorodimedone by chloroperoxidase is 4:1. This value is significantly higher than the ratio in reactions of these two substrates with molecular bromine, which is essentially 1:1. A general reaction scheme for all reactions of chloroperoxidase with its halogen-acceptor substrates is proposed. This process involves the initial formation of Compound I and its subsequent conversion into an iron (III) hypohalite halogenating intermediate."

https://openalex.org/W1666011617,"Eukaryotic initiation factor 4A (eIF-4A) has been purified (to apparent homogeneity) from rabbit reticulocyte lysate. It is a single polypeptide accounting for at least 90% of the Coomassie blue staining material when subjected to gel electrophoresis in the presence of sodium dodecyl sulfate. The molecular weight was determined by gel electrophoresis under denaturing conditions at two different bisacrylamide to acrylamide ratios, by gel filtration under native conditions and by sedimentation equilibrium at three different protein concentrations. Additional physical properties of the polypeptide were also determined. In an attempt to characterize the function of eIF-4A, a protein specifically required for mRNA translation, an assay was developed which measures the protein-dependent retention of radiolabeled hemoglobin mRNA on nitrocellulose filters. These studies led to the discovery of an ATP-stimulated binding of mRNA which is dependent on the presence of eIF-4A and eIF-4B that also contains the 24,000-dalton cap binding protein. The reaction apparently requires ATP hydrolysis since a nonhydrolyzable analogue of ATP, adenosine 5'-(beta, gamma-imino)triphosphate, does not stimulate mRNA binding and GTP cannot substitute for ATP. In addition, ATP-stimulated binding of mRNA can be inhibited by an analog of the mRNA 5' terminus, m7GMP, suggesting recognition of the capped 5' end of hemoglobin mRNA. Consistent with this suggestion, ATP also stimulated the covalent cross-linking of eIF-4A and eIF-4B to the cap of oxidized reovirus mRNA, an interaction that was inhibited by m7GDP."

https://openalex.org/W2006427136,"Pleural mesothelioma, lung cancer, pleural calcification and fibrosis, and interstitial parenchymal fibrosis have been observed among inhabitants of several villages in south-central Turkey. Earlier reports have stated that environmental and lung tissue samples from this area contained the fibrous zeolite mineral erionite, and this mineral has generally been assumed to be the agent responsible for these endemic pathological conditions in the absence of asbestos outcroppings and usage. Several different kinds of asbestos minerals in addition to erionite have now been found in environmental samples taken from the villages where these diseases occur. The lung tissues of mesothelioma patients from these villages contain both fibrous zeolites and asbestos minerals."
https://openalex.org/W1542748993,"The histone H1 fraction from the murine embryonal carcinoma cell line F9 can be resolved by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis into at least 15 components. Ten of these components incorporate 32P from administered orthophosphate. The digestion of 3H- and 32P-labeled samples with alkaline phosphatase indicates that this cell line has at least five H1 subtypes, three of which have not been observed in the mouse before. Every subtype is phosphorylated to some extent. There are, however, striking differences among them in the degree of phosphorylation in interphase, both in the proportion of molecules present as phosphorylated forms and in the numbers of phosphate groups per molecule. Phosphorylations of two types are discernible; most phosphorylations do not significantly affect the mobility of the protein in sodium dodecyl sulfate-containing gels but one does, probably reflecting a phosphorylation-induced alteration in protein conformation. Four subtypes undergo only the first type of phosphorylation; the other subtype undergoes both types of phosphorylation. The same 5 subtypes are also present in two other independently derived embryonal carcinoma cell lines. In contrast, two differentiated (endoderm-like) cell lines derived from teratocarcinomas lack H1b, and one also lacks H1d. Our results are consistent with the view that the H1 subtypes differ from each other functionally. They also show that neither H1b nor H1d is essential for cell division."

https://openalex.org/W2004249299,"Short-term perfusion of the isolated dog gastrocnemius-plantaris muscle with hydrogen peroxide resulted in a decrease in steady-state muscle oxygen consumption and isometric tension generation. Hydrogen peroxide converted intracellular myoglobin to products incapable of combination with oxygen, but had no deleterious effect on neuromuscular transmission or on mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation. It is concluded that functional intracellular myoglobin is important in maintaining oxygen consumption and tension generation in exercising skeletal muscle."

https://openalex.org/W2075390507,"The nonhallucinogenic ergot derivative lisuride exerts many pharmacological effects that are similar to those of its hallucinogenic congener, lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD). Animals trained to discriminate between the presence of one drug and the other can be used to differentiate the actions of these compounds on a neuronal level. The discriminative stimulus effect of LSD (the LSD cue) is similar to that of the serotonin agonist quipazine, whereas the lisuride cue is similar to that of the dopamine agonist apomorphine. These data support the hypothesis that serotonin is intricately involved in the hallucinogenic effects of LSD."

https://openalex.org/W1994890069,"The increasing availability and utilization of legal abortion in the United States has several important effects on public health in the 1970's. It reduced deaths and surgical complications among women of childbearing age; it made possible the development of safer surgical procedures for pregnancy termination; and it increased the provision of low-cost outpatient gynecologic services. There is some concern about potential adverse outcomes in future desired pregnancies and possibly higher risks of breast cancer in certain women.Public health in the United States has been affected in the past decade by the increased availability and utilization of abortion. The legalization of abortion has led to a decrease in deaths and surgical complications among women of childbearing age, the development of safer procedures for pregnancy termination, and the provision of low-cost outpatient services. Adverse outcomes in future pregnancies and an increase in breast cancer risk are two of the possible negative results of the increased abortion rate. Three graphs and a statistical table illustrate the article."

Intracellular calcium, which is thought to be a pathogenetic factor in cystic fibrosis, may also be a meaningful marker in cell aging."
https://openalex.org/W2085850641,"Lesions to the entorhinal afferent of the hippocampus in rats caused marked changes in calcium transport into mitochondria. Pyruvate-supported calcium transport into mitochondria from the denervated hippocampus was decreased to a larger extent than succinate-supported transport, and adenosine triphosphate-supported transport was not significantly modified. Although cytochrome oxidase and succinate dehydrogenase activities were not significantly changed by entorhinal lesions, pyruvate flux through pyruvate dehydrogenase was significantly decreased, and this effect was correlated with changes in pyruvate-supported calcium transport. The active portion of pyruvate dehydrogenase decreased, whereas total pyruvate dehydrogenase was not modified. These data suggest that denervation might initiate dendritic atrophy and subsequent growth responses by modifying calcium regulation through a change in the phosphorylation of pyruvate dehydrogenase."
https://openalex.org/W2013897244,"The concanavalin A--binding glycoproteins of the rat synaptic junction were isolated by affinity chromatography. These glycoproteins had molecular weights of 160,000, 123,000, 110,000, and 95,000. The tryptic peptide maps of these glycoproteins showed that the three largest glycoproteins contained a high percentage of identical peptides. This indicates that the amino acid sequences of these glycoproteins have a high degree of homology. The 95,000-dalton glycoprotein was unrelated to the other three. These findings suggest that homologous glycoproteins may participate in synapse formation or maintenance, or both."
https://openalex.org/W2054118162,"Rhythmic contractile activity, synchronized with pulsatile pressure changes, was recorded from rabbit aorta in vivo. The contractions were locked in frequency to the pulsatile activity of the heart even when the heart was electrically paced to rates as high as 600 cycles per minute; termination of cardiac contractility resulted in their elimination. When the atria and ventricles contracted at different rates, the pulse-synchronized contractions were locked to the atrial rate. Excision of the right atrium, but not the left, resulted in the abolition of pulse-synchronized contractions. It is concluded that common pacemaker controls cardiac and vascular contractility, coordinating events in the two tissues."
https://openalex.org/W1599905161,"Arthrobacter sialophilus neuraminidase catalyzes the hydrolysis of N-acetylneuraminyl-alpha-oxygen, nitrogen, and azido glycosides. The most effective of those substrates examined was N-acetylneuraminyl-alpha-4-methylumbelliferylglycoside (AcNeu-alpha-4-MU; Km app, 0.0193 mM; kcat, 136.4 sec-1). The products resulting from the enzymic hydrolysis of N-acetylneuraminyl-alpha-azido-glycoside were N-acetylneuraminic acid and azide ion. N-acetylneuraminyl-alpha-2,3-thiogalactylglycoside and N-acetylneuraminyl-alpha-2,6-thiogalactylglycoside were competitive inhibitors of the enzyme having KI values of 1.52 mM and 1.70 mM, respectively. Dissociation constants for these thioglycosides were also determined by fluorescence enzyme titrations which gave values similar to those determined kinetically. N-Acetylneuraminic acid, but not its methyl ester, was a competitive inhibitor of neuraminidase. Its KI value, 0.18 mM, was also determined by both methods. 5-Acetamido-2,6-anhydro-3,5-dideoxy-D-glycero-D-talo-nonulosonic acid (2-deoxy-4-epi-AcNeu) was found to be a weak competitive inhibitor (KI, 12.1 mM). A. sialophilus neuraminidase further catalyzes transglycosidation reactions with methanol as acceptor. Methanol had no effect on the release of 4-MU by enzymatic hydrolysis of AcNeu-alpha-4-MU, suggesting that the formation of the enzyme-glycone intermediate is the rate-determining step. The anomeric configuration of the product of this reaction, as shown by 13C-nmr spectroscopy, is N-acetylneuraminyl-alpha-methylglycoside. Neuraminidase, therefore, catalyzes its reactions with overall retention of configuration."

Eight days after ovariectomy 200-g rats were given a single intraperitoneal injection of 100 micrograms of estradiol. [14C]Glycine, 1.5 mCi. was administered intraperitoneally 40 h later and the animals were killed between 0.5-6 h following isotope injection. Radiolabeled proteins were extracted from uterine tissues sequentially with 0.45 and 1.0 M neutral salt, 0.5 M acetic acid, 0.1 M penicillamine, and 4 M guanidine hydrochloride or pepsin digestion. The radiolabeled collagens from each pool were analyzed by a combination of sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and fluorography. Types I, III, and V collagens were identified in uterine pools. In the salt-soluble pool, each collagen type underwent rapid maturation into salt-insoluble collagen, although the initial appearance of type V collagen was delayed in both salt-soluble and insoluble pools. Type I procollagens were rapidly converted to alpha-chains through pc-intermediates. At 0.5 h, 28% of the type I collagen was already in a alpha-chain form. Type II procollagen was also rapidly converted but to a more stable intermediate designated p alpha 1 (III). Radiolabeled procollagens were also observed in the acetic acid, penicillamine, and guanidine hydrochloride pools suggesting that collagen precursor molecules complex through covalent and noncovalent interactions with other connective tissue macromolecules. These results indicate that both procollagen conversion and collagen assembly can follow different pathways depending upon the nature of the collagen and the tissue studied."

A survey of Californian committees and selected national data reveals wide variability in committee structure and procedures. Public participation, although constrained in various ways, has been generally constructive.Using national data and the results of a California survey, Dutton and Hochheimer assess the impact of public participation on institutional biosafety committees responsible for regulation of recombinant DNA research. Committee members' responses to questionnaires and transcripts of meetings revealed a wide variety of organizational structures and procedures, and differences of opinion between scientist and non-scientist members as to the value of lay involvement in science policy. The authors conclude that these committees have set an important precedent for direct public participation in the decision process concerning science and technology."
