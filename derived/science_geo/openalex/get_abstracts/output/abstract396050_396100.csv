https://openalex.org/W2043991982,"Immunosuppressive tumor microenvironments can restrain antitumor immunity, particularly in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDA). Because CD40 activation can reverse immune suppression and drive antitumor T cell responses, we tested the combination of an agonist CD40 antibody with gemcitabine chemotherapy in a small cohort of patients with surgically incurable PDA and observed tumor regressions in some patients. We reproduced this treatment effect in a genetically engineered mouse model of PDA and found unexpectedly that tumor regression required macrophages but not T cells or gemcitabine. CD40-activated macrophages rapidly infiltrated tumors, became tumoricidal, and facilitated the depletion of tumor stroma. Thus, cancer immune surveillance does not necessarily depend on therapy-induced T cells; rather, our findings demonstrate a CD40-dependent mechanism for targeting tumor stroma in the treatment of cancer."

However, latent learning and devaluation studies show that behavior also shows hallmarks of model-based planning, and the interaction between model-based and model-free values, prediction errors, and preferences is underexplored. We designed a multistep decision task in which model-based and model-free influences on human choice behavior could be distinguished. By showing that choices reflected both influences we could then test the purity of the ventral striatal BOLD signal as a model-free report. Contrary to expectations, the signal reflected both model-free and model-based predictions in proportions matching those that best explained choice behavior. These results challenge the notion of a separate model-free learner and suggest a more integrated computational architecture for high-level human decision-making.

Humans learn both a world model and reinforcement-driven choice preferences BOLD responses in striatum and prefrontal cortex reflect both sorts of learning Across subjects, striatal BOLD tracks individual differences in model use Unexpectedly, ventral striatum shows combined model-based/free influences A ubiquitous idea in psychology, neuroscience, and behavioral economics is that the brain contains multiple, distinct systems for decision-making (Daw et al., 2005Daw N.D.

One long-prominent contender, the “law of effect,” states that an action followed by reinforcement is more likely to be repeated in the future (Thorndike, 1911Thorndike E.L. Animal Intelligence; Experimental Studies. The Macmillan Company, New York1911Crossref Google Scholar). This habit principle is also at the heart of temporal-difference (TD) learning accounts of the dopaminergic system and its action in striatum (Barto, 1995Barto A.G.

A neural substrate of prediction and reward.Science. 1997; 275: 1593-1599Crossref PubMed Scopus (6003) Google Scholar). In the actor-critic, for instance, a dopaminergic “reward prediction error” (RPE) signal plays the role of Thorndike's reinforcer, increasing the propensity to take actions that are followed by positive RPEs (Maia, 2010Maia T.V.

However, it has long been known that the reinforcement principle offers at best an incomplete account of learned action choice. Evidence from reward devaluation studies suggests that animals can also make “goal-directed” choices, putatively controlled by representations of the likely outcomes of their actions (Dickinson and Balleine, 2002Dickinson A. Balleine B. The role of learning in the operation of motivational systems. Stevens' Handbook of Experimental Psychology, Third Edition, Vol.3: Learning, Motivation, and Emotion.in: Paschler H.

Rev. 1948; 55: 189-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (3739) Google Scholar, that animals are not condemned merely to repeat previously reinforced actions. From the perspective of neuroscience, habits and goal-directed action systems appear to coexist in different corticostriatal circuits. While these systems learn concurrently, they control behavior differentially under alternative circumstances (Balleine and O'Doherty, 2010Balleine B.W. O'Doherty J.P.

The TD mechanism is associated with dopamine and RPEs, and is “model-free” in the sense of eschewing the representation of task structure and instead working directly by reinforcing successful actions. The goal-directed mechanism is a separate “model-based” RL system, which works by using a learned “internal model” of the task to evaluate candidate actions (e.g., by mental simulation; Hassabis and Maguire, 2007Hassabis D.

Barring one recent exception (Gläscher et al., 2010Gläscher J. Daw N. Dayan P. O'Doherty J.P. States versus rewards: Dissociable neural prediction error signals underlying model-based and model-free reinforcement learning.Neuron. 2010; 66: 585-595Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (750) Google Scholar) (which focused on the different issue of the neural substrates of learning the internal model), previous studies investigating the neural substrates of model-free and model-based control have not attempted to detect simultaneous correlates of both as these systems learn concurrently. Thus, the way the controllers interact is unclear, and the prevailing supposition that neural RPEs originate from a distinct model-free system remains untested. Here we exploited the difference between their two types of action evaluation to investigate the interaction of the controllers in humans quantitatively, using functional MRI (fMRI). Model-free evaluation is retrospective, chaining RPEs backward across a sequence of actions. By contrast, model-based evaluation is prospective, directly assessing available future possibilities. Thus, it is possible to distinguish the two using a sequential choice task. In theory, the choices recommended by model-based and model-free strategies depend on their own, separate valuation computations. Thus, if behavior reflects contributions from each strategy, then we can make the clear, testable prediction that neural signals reflecting either valuation should dissociate from behavior (Kable and Glimcher, 2007Kable J.W.

Of these, value-related signals in mPFC are sensitive to task contingencies, and are thus good candidates for involvement in model-based evaluation (Hampton et al., 2006Hampton A.N. Bossaerts P.

Conversely, the ventral striatal signal correlates with an RPE (McClure et al., 2003aMcClure S.M. Berns G.S. Montague P.R.

If so, these signals should reflect ignorance of task structure and instead be driven by past reinforcement, even though subjects' behavior, if it is partly under the control of a separate model-based system, may be better informed. Contrary to this hitherto untested prediction, our results demonstrate that reinforcement-based and model-based value predictions are combined in both brain areas, and more particularly, that RPEs in ventral striatum do not reflect pure model-free TD. These results suggest a more integrated computational account of the neural substrates of valuation. Subjects (n = 17) completed a two-stage Markov decision task (Figure 1) in which, on each trial, an initial choice between two options labeled by (semantically irrelevant) Tibetan characters led probabilistically to either of two, second-stage “states,” represented by different colors. In turn, these both demanded another two-option choice, each of which was associated with a different chance of delivering a monetary reward. The choice of one first-stage option led predominantly (70% of the time) to an associated one of the two second-stage states, and this relationship was fixed throughout the experiment. However, to incentivize subjects to continue learning throughout the task, the chances of payoff associated with the four second-stage options were changed slowly and independently, according to Gaussian random walks. Theory (Daw et al., 2005Daw N.D. Niv Y. Dayan P. Uncertainty-based competition between prefrontal and dorsolateral striatal systems for behavioral control.Nat. Neurosci. 2005; 8: 1704-1711Crossref PubMed Scopus (1548) Google Scholar, Dickinson, 1985Dickinson A. Actions and habits: The development of behavioural autonomy.Philos. Trans. R. Soc. Lond. B Biol. Sci. 1985; 308: 67-78Crossref Google Scholar) predicts that such change should tend to favor the ongoing contribution of model-based evaluation. Each subject undertook 201 trials, of which 2 ± 2 (mean ± 1 SD) trials were not completed due to failure to enter a response within the 2 s limit. These trials were omitted from analysis. The logic of the task was that model-based and model-free strategies for RL predict different patterns by which reward obtained in the second stage should impact first-stage choices on subsequent trials. For illustration, consider a trial in which a first-stage choice, uncharacteristically, led to the second-stage state with which it is not usually associated, and in which the choice then made at the second stage was rewarded. The principle of reinforcement would predict that this experience should increase the probability of repeating the first-stage choice because it was ultimately rewarded. However, a subject choosing instead using an internal model of the task's transition structure that evaluates actions prospectively would be expected instead to exhibit a decreased tendency to choose that same option. This is because any increase in the value of the rewarded second-stage option will more greatly increase the expected value of the first-stage option that is more likely to lead there. This is actually the first-stage option that was not originally chosen. Given previous work suggesting the coexistence of multiple valuation processes in the brain (Balleine et al., 2008Balleine B.W. Daw N.D. O'Doherty J.P. Multiple forms of value learning and the function of dopamine.in: Glimcher P.W. Camerer C. Poldrack R.A. Fehr E. Neuroeconomics: Decision Making and the Brain. Academic Press, San Diego, CA2008Google Scholar, Dickinson, 1985Dickinson A. Actions and habits: The development of behavioural autonomy.Philos. Trans. R. Soc. Lond. B Biol. Sci. 1985; 308: 67-78Crossref Google Scholar), we hypothesized that subjects might exhibit a mixture of both strategies. First, to see learning effects of this sort in a relatively theory-neutral manner, we directly assessed the effect of events on the previous trial (trial n) on the choice on the current trial (trial n+1). The two key events on trial n are whether or not reward was received, and whether the second-stage state presented was common or rare, given the first-stage choice on trial n. We evaluated the impact of these events on the chance of repeating the same first-stage choice on trial n+1. For reasons outlined above, a simple reinforcement strategy [simulated in Figure 2A using the TD algorithm SARSA(λ) for λ = 1] predicts only a main effect of reward: an ultimately rewarded choice is more likely to be repeated, regardless of whether that reward followed a common or rare transition. Conversely, a model-based strategy (simulated in Figure 2B) predicts a crossover interaction between the two factors, because a rare transition inverts the effect of the subsequent reward. Figure 2C plots the observed choice proportions as a function of these two factors, in the average across subjects. In order to study effects that were statistically reliable at the level of the population, we quantified the effects using hierarchical logistic regression with all coefficients taken as random effects across subjects. At the population level, the main effect of reward was significantly different from zero (p < 1e−8, two-tailed), demonstrating a reinforcement effect. However, the interaction between reward and the transition probability was also significant (p < 5e−5), rejecting a pure reinforcement account and suggesting that subjects take the transition model into account in making their choices. As both theories predict, there was no significant main effect of transition likelihood (p = 0.5). Finally, the constant term was significantly positive (p < 5e−12), suggesting an overall tendency to stick with the same option from trial to trial, reward notwithstanding (Ito and Doya, 2009Ito M.

Exp. Anal. Behav. 2005; 84: 555-579Crossref PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar). We also considered estimates of the effect sizes for each individual within this analysis (conditional on the group-level parameter estimates); the effect of reward was positive (within the 95% confidence interval) for 14/17 subjects, and the interaction was positive for 10/17 individuals, including 7 for whom the main effect of reward was also positive. Together these data suggest that hallmarks of both strategies are seen significantly at the population level and within many individuals, but that there may be between-subject variability in their deployment. Motivated by these results, we considered the fit of full model-based and model-free [SARSA(λ) TD; Rummery and Niranjan, 1994Rummery G. Niranjan M. On-line Q-learning using connectionist systems. Technical Report CUED/F-INFENG/TR 166, Engineering Department. Cambridge University, 1994Google Scholar] RL algorithms to the choice sequences. The former evaluates actions by prospective simulation in a learned model; the latter uses a generalized principle of reinforcement. The generalization, controlled by the reinforcement eligibility parameter λ, is that the estimated value of the second-stage state should act as the same sort of model-free reinforcer for the first-stage choice because the final reward actually received after the second-stage choice. The parameter λ governs the relative importance of these two reinforcers, with λ = 1 being the special case of Figure 2A in which only the final reward is important, and λ = 0 being the purest case of the TD algorithm in which only the second-stage value plays a role. We also considered a hybrid theory (Gläscher et al., 2010Gläscher J. Daw N. Dayan P. O'Doherty J.P. States versus rewards: Dissociable neural prediction error signals underlying model-based and model-free reinforcement learning.Neuron. 2010; 66: 585-595Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (750) Google Scholar) in which subjects could run both algorithms in parallel and make choices according to the weighted combination of the action values that they produce (see Experimental Procedures). We took the relative weight of the two algorithms' values into account in determining the choices to be a free parameter, which we allowed to vary across subjects but assumed to be constant throughout the experiment. Thus, this algorithm contains both the model-based and TD algorithms as special cases, where one or the other gets all weight. We first verified that the model fit significantly better than chance; it did so, at p < 0.05 for all 17 subjects (likelihood ratio tests). We estimated the theory's free parameters individually for each subject by maximum likelihood (Table 1). Such an analysis treats each subject as occupying a point on a continuum trading off the two strategies; tests of the parameter estimates across subjects seek effects that are generalizable to other members of the population (analogous to the random effects level in fMRI; Holmes and Friston, 1998Holmes A. Friston K. Generalisability, random effects and population inference.Neuroimage. 1998; 7: S754Google Scholar). Due to non-Gaussian statistics (because the parameters are expected to lie in the unit range), we analyzed the estimated parameters' medians using nonparametric tests. Across subjects, the median weighting for model-free RL values was 61% (with model-based RL at 39%), which was significantly different from both 0% and 100% (sign tests, p < 0.005), again suggesting that both strategies were mixed in the population. The second important parameter is the reinforcement eligibility parameter λ, which controls the two reinforcement effects in TD, i.e., the relative influence of the estimated value of the second-stage state and the ultimate reward on the model-free value of the first-stage choice. Across subjects, the median estimate for λ was 0.57 (significantly different from 0 and 1; sign tests, p < 0.05), suggesting that at the population level, reinforcement occurred in part according to TD-like value chaining (λ < 1) and in part according to direct reinforcement (λ > 0).Table 1Best-Fitting Parameter Estimates, Shown as Median Plus Quartiles across Subjectsβ1β2α1α2λpw−LLp − r225th percentile2.762.690.460.210.410.020.29167.740.17Median5.193.690.540.420.570.110.39200.550.2675th percentile7.455.160.870.710.940.220.59228.220.40Also shown are medians and quartiles for the negative log-likelihood (−LL) of the data at the best fitting parameters, and a pseudo-r2 statistic (p − r2), a normalized measure of the degree to which the model explained the choice data.

Since analyzing estimates of the free parameters does not speak to their necessity for explaining data, we used both classical and Bayesian model comparison to test whether these free parameters of the full model were justified by data, relative to four simplifications. We tested the special cases of SARSA(λ) and model-based RL alone, plus the hybrid model, using only direct reinforcement or value chaining (i.e., with λ restricted to 0 or 1). The results in Table 2 show the superiority of the hybrid model both in the aggregate over subjects and also, in most tests, for the majority of subjects considered individually. Finally, we fit the hierarchical model of Stephan et al., 2009Stephan K.E. Penny W.D. Daunizeau J. Moran R.J. Friston K.J.

The exceedance probabilities from this analysis, shown in Table 2, indicate that the hybrid model had the highest chance (with probability 92%) of being the most common model in the population.

Adipose tissue AAMs are necessary to maintain glucose homeostasis and are induced by the cytokine interleukin-4 (IL-4). Here, we show that eosinophils are the major IL-4-expressing cells in white adipose tissues of mice, and, in their absence, AAMs are greatly attenuated. Eosinophils migrate into adipose tissue by an integrin-dependent process and reconstitute AAMs through an IL-4- or IL-13-dependent process. Mice fed a high-fat diet develop increased body fat, impaired glucose tolerance, and insulin resistance in the absence of eosinophils, and helminth-induced adipose tissue eosinophilia enhances glucose tolerance. Our results suggest that eosinophils play an unexpected role in metabolic homeostasis through maintenance of adipose AAMs."

Optical mapping of inhibitory circuits with single-cell resolution Discovery of completely connected local inhibitory networks No evidence for specific subcircuits Dense, unspecific connectivity at early and mature developmental stages The neocortex is the largest part of the mammalian brain, yet its function is still poorly understood. Anatomical and physiological studies have emphasized the vertical (or “columnar”) nature of its connectivity (Hubel and Wiesel, 1977Hubel D.H. Wiesel T.N. Ferrier lecture.

Consistent with this hypothesis, in different species and cortical areas, the cortex develops in a stereotypical fashion (Katz and Shatz, 1996Katz L.C. Shatz C.J. Synaptic activity and the construction of cortical circuits.Science. 1996; 274: 1133-1138Crossref PubMed Scopus (2271) Google Scholar) with similar interlaminar connections (Burkhalter, 1989Burkhalter A.

Morphology and intracortical projections of functionally characterised neurones in the cat visual cortex.Nature. 1979; 280: 120-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (702) Google Scholar). At the same time, there are structural differences among cortical areas and species (DeFelipe, 1993DeFelipe J. Neocortical neuronal diversity: chemical heterogeneity revealed by colocalization studies of classic neurotransmitters, neuropeptides, calcium-binding proteins, and cell surface molecules.Cereb. Cortex. 1993; 3: 273-289Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar), so each cortical region could still have a specific, dedicated circuit. Crucial to this debate is the knowledge of how different subtypes of cortical neurons connect to each other, an issue for which there is only scant available data. Although some studies find great specificity in cortical connections (Callaway, 1998Callaway E.M. Local circuits in primary visual cortex of the macaque monkey.Annu. Rev.

Neurosci. 2007; 1: 19-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar), others have proposed that cortical neurons connect without any specificity (Braitenberg and Schüzt, 1991Braitenberg V. Schüzt A. Anatomy of the Cortex. Springer, Berlin1991Crossref Google Scholar, Peters and Jones, 1984Peters A. Jones E.G. Cerebral Cortex. Volume 1–13. Plenum, New York1984Google Scholar), forming perhaps a neural network, or a “tabula rasa,” on which activity-dependent developmental rules could sculpt mature circuits (Kalisman et al., 2005Kalisman N.

To measure the specificity in cortical connections, one would need techniques that reveal synaptically connected neurons. In the last decade, electrophysiological recordings from connected cortical neurons in brain slices (Thomson et al., 1988Thomson A.M. Girdlestone D. West D.C. Voltage-dependent currents prolong single-axon postsynaptic potentials in layer III pyramidal neurons in rat neocortical slices.J. Neurophysiol. 1988; 60: 1896-1907PubMed Google Scholar) have demonstrated many intra- and interlaminar connections between specific neuronal subtypes (Deuchards et al., 1994Deuchards J. West D.C. Thomson A. Relationships between morphology and physiology of pyramid-pyramid single axon connections in rat neocortex in vitro.J. Neurophysiol. 1994; 478: 423-435Google Scholar, Feldmeyer and Sakmann, 2000Feldmeyer D. Sakmann B.

If the goal, however, is to eventually reveal most, or all, connections within a given area, this method is limited given the few connections that can be tested in one experiment. To circumvent this problem, we designed an optical technique, a modification of one-photon photostimulation (Callaway and Katz, 1993Callaway E.M. Katz L.C. Photostimulation using caged glutamate reveals functional circuitry in living brain slices.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 1993; 90: 7661-7665Crossref PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar), that reveals synaptic connections in large numbers and can provide a map of most connections to a neuron in a local area, with single-cell resolution (Nikolenko et al., 2007Nikolenko V. Poskanzer K.E. Yuste R. Two-photon photostimulation and imaging of neural circuits.Nat. Methods. 2007; 4: 943-950Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). Using two-photon uncaging of glutamate in brain slices, one can sequentially activate hundreds of potential presynaptic cells, one by one, and quickly test whether they are connected to a given postsynaptic neuron (Nikolenko et al., 2007Nikolenko V. Poskanzer K.E. Yuste R. Two-photon photostimulation and imaging of neural circuits.Nat. Methods. 2007; 4: 943-950Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). We were interested to apply this two-photon mapping technique to inhibitory circuits and determine the functional structure of inhibitory networks in the neocortex. The cortex has numerous types of GABAergic interneurons (Fairen et al., 1984Fairen A. De Felipe J. Regidor J. Nonpyramidal neurons.in: Peters A. Jones E.G. Cerebral Cortex. Plenum, New York1984: 201-253Google Scholar), which play a determinant role in the regulation of the excitability of pyramidal cells (PCs) and the activity of cortical microcircuits, by controlling different parts of the axo-dendritic arborization of the PCs (Somogyi et al., 1998Somogyi P. Tamás G. Lujan R. Buhl E.H. Salient features of synaptic organisation in the cerebral cortex.Brain Res. Brain Res. Rev. 1998; 26: 113-135Crossref PubMed Scopus (711) Google Scholar). One can distinguish many subtypes of inhibitory neurons in neocortical circuits morphologically and physiologically (Gupta et al., 2000Gupta A. Wang Y. Markram H.

For this study, we focused on dendritic targeting inhibitory cells, the somatostatin-expressing interneurons (Kawaguchi and Kubota, 1997Kawaguchi Y. Kubota Y.

Three distinct families of GABAergic neurons in rat visual cortex.Cereb. Cortex. 1997; 7: 347-358Crossref PubMed Scopus (392) Google Scholar). Somatostatin-positive cells are composed of several subtypes, of which Martinotti neurons are the predominant type (Halabisky et al., 2006Halabisky B. Shen F. Huguenard J.R. Prince D.A.

They generally, although not always (Gonchar et al., 2002Gonchar Y. Turney S. Price J.L. Burkhalter A.

Neurol. 2002; 443: 1-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar), contact apical and tufted dendrites of PCs (Kawaguchi and Kubota, 1997Kawaguchi Y. Kubota Y.

Physiol. 2004; 561: 65-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar). Somatostatin-positive interneurons display low-threshold spiking (Kawaguchi, 1995Kawaguchi Y. Physiological subgroups of nonpyramidal cells with specific morphological characteristics in layer II/III of rat frontal cortex.J. Neurosci. 1995; 15: 2638-2655PubMed Google Scholar), generating a global dendritic calcium spike (Goldberg et al., 2004Goldberg J.H. Lacefield C.O. Yuste R.

Physiol. 2004; 558: 465-478Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar), and can fire spontaneously in a pacemaker fashion, in the absence of any synaptic input (LeBon-Jego and Yuste, 2007LeBon-Jego M. Yuste R. Persistently active, pacemaker-like neurons in primary visual cortex.Front. Neurosci. 2007; 1: 123-129Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Within neuronal circuits, they control local synaptic inputs of PCs (Murayama et al., 2009Murayama M. Pérez-Garci E. Nevian T. Bock T. Senn W. Larkum M.E.

Markram H.

Glickfeld L.L. Atallah B.V. Scanziani M. Supralinear increase of recurrent inhibition during sparse activity in the somatosensory cortex.Nat. Neurosci. 2007; 10: 743-753Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar), to the point that they can be activated by a single PC (Kozloski et al., 2001Kozloski J. Hamzei-Sichani F. Yuste R. Stereotyped position of local synaptic targets in neocortex.Science. 2001; 293: 868-872Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar), mediating a strong disynaptic inhibition between PCs (Silberberg and Markram, 2007Silberberg G. Markram H. Disynaptic inhibition between neocortical pyramidal cells mediated by Martinotti cells.Neuron. 2007; 53: 735-746Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (466) Google Scholar). These specific morphological and physiological properties suggest that somatostatin-positive interneurons implement a specific function in the microcircuit. However, understanding how exactly they are integrated into the network has remained elusive and is a key step to determine their exact role. Their connectivity patterns have mainly been explored with paired recordings, characterizing uni- or bidirectional synaptic contacts with PCs or with one-photon photostimulation experiments (Katzel et al., 2010Katzel D. Zemelman B.V. Buetfering C. Wolfel M. Miesenbock G. The columnar and laminar organization of inhibitory connections to neocortical excitatory cells.Nat.

Fine-scale specificity of cortical networks depends on inhibitory cell type and connectivity.Nat. Neurosci. 2005; 8: 1552-1559Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar). In spite of these studies, it is still not clear how exactly do somatostatin-positive interneurons connect to the local population of targets, and whether their connections are specific or not. Here, we characterize the synaptic connectivity between a local population of somatostatin-positive interneurons and their PC targets within layer 2/3 in frontal cortex. Using laser multiplexing, and a new caged glutamate compound, on brain slices from a mouse strain where somatostatin neurons are labeled with GFP, we build maps of connected interneuron-PCs, with single-cell resolution. We find a high degree of local connectivity, at both early and mature stages of circuit development, without any evidence for specific synaptic subcircuits. Surprisingly, some maps demonstrate a completely connected local network, something that, to our knowledge, has not been reported before in CNS circuits. An all-to-all connectivity has implications for models of cortical modularity and processing. Our goal was to study the connectivity from a defined type of neocortical interneurons to PCs. To identify a homogeneous population of interneurons in living slices, we used a transgenic mouse strain that express GFP exclusively in somatostatin interneurons (Oliva et al., 2000Oliva Jr., A.A. Jiang M. Lam T. Smith K.L. Swann J.W. Novel hippocampal interneuronal subtypes identified using transgenic mice that express green fluorescent protein in GABAergic interneurons.J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 3354-3368PubMed Google Scholar) and chose the upper layers from frontal cortex, because of its abundance of GFP cells (Figure 1A ). In these mice, all recorded GFP cells from were interneurons, as defined by nonpyramidal structural or functional characteristics (n = 55). Morphologically, GFP cells had ascending axonal arborizations with extensive branching in layer 1 and horizontal collaterals, typical of Martinotti cells (Figure 1B; Halabisky et al., 2006Halabisky B. Shen F. Huguenard J.R. Prince D.A. Electrophysiological classification of somatostatin-positive interneurons in mouse sensorimotor cortex.J.

Physiol. 2004; 561: 65-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar). Electrophysiologically, GFP cells had a marked afterhyperpolarization, a moderate frequency of discharge (32.1 ± 2.2 Hz, n = 35), a significant spike frequency adaptation (0.49 ± 0.02, n = 35) and a relatively linear I/V curve (Figure 1C and Table 1). These results confirmed that GFP cells were somatostatin-positive interneurons (Halabisky et al., 2006Halabisky B. Shen F. Huguenard J.R. Prince D.A.

In fact, using cluster analysis, most recorded GFP cells (30 out of 38 cells) belonged to the Martinotti subtype, as defined by their morphological or electrophysiological characteristics (McGarry et al., 2010McGarry L.M.

We set out to map inputs from layer 2/3 somastostatin-positive interneurons (“sGFP” cells, for the rest of the study), onto local pyramidal neurons (PCs), identified by their somatic morphologies. For this, we adapted the two-photon photostimulation technique to build single-cell resolution connectivity maps. While the original two-photon mapping method used MNI-glutamate as the caged compound (Matsuzaki et al., 2004Matsuzaki M. Honkura N. Ellis-Davies G.C. Kasai H. Structural basis of long-term potentiation in single dendritic spines.Nature. 2004; 429: 761-766Crossref PubMed Scopus (1666) Google Scholar, Nikolenko et al., 2007Nikolenko V. Poskanzer K.E. Yuste R. Two-photon photostimulation and imaging of neural circuits.Nat. Methods. 2007; 4: 943-950Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar), we found that, at concentrations needed for effective two-photon uncaging, MNI-glutamate completely blocks GABAergic transmission (Fino et al., 2009Fino E. Araya R. Peterka D.S. Salierno M. Etchenique R. Yuste R. RuBi-glutamate: two-photon and visible-light photoactivation of neurons and dendritic spines.Front. Neural Circuits. 2009; 3: 2Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). To circumvent this problem, we developed a new caged glutamate, RuBi-Glutamate, which has higher quantum yield and can therefore be used at lower concentrations, enabling the optical mapping of inhibitory connections (Fino et al., 2009Fino E. Araya R. Peterka D.S. Salierno M. Etchenique R. Yuste R. RuBi-glutamate: two-photon and visible-light photoactivation of neurons and dendritic spines.Front. Neural Circuits. 2009; 3: 2Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). With a similar laser multiplexing uncaging protocol previously used to activate PCs (Fino et al., 2009Fino E. Araya R.

Two-photon RuBi-Glutamate photoactivation was reliable: repetitive photostimulation of the same neuron with the same laser power evoked the same number of action potentials (APs) (Figure 1E). Before mapping, we first performed simultaneous whole-cell recordings from pairs of connected sGFP interneurons and PCs to characterize their typical inhibitory monosynaptic connections and used that information to design the optimal protocols to be able to identify them in photostimulation experiments. To better detect potential monosynaptic IPSCs, we performed all recordings from PCs in voltage clamp. Because somatostatin-positive interneurons normally target more distal dendrites of PCs (Kawaguchi and Kubota, 1997Kawaguchi Y. Kubota Y. GABAergic cell subtypes and their synaptic connections in rat frontal cortex.Cereb. Cortex. 1997; 7: 476-486Crossref PubMed Scopus (1047) Google Scholar), we used a Cs-based internal solution and also enhanced the amplitude of IPSCs by clamping the postsynaptic PC at +40 mV. Inhibitory synaptic inputs were thus recorded as outward currents (Figure 1F). Monosynaptic IPSCs had average latencies of 1.34 ± 0.11 ms and amplitudes of 39.30 ± 9.48 pA (n = 15; Table 2). In addition, evoking 2 APs at 40 Hz in the sGFP cell revealed mainly depressing synapses (75.57 ± 7.45%, n = 15). With these paired recordings, we confirmed that the IPSCs measured in postsynaptic PCs after evoking an AP in sGFP neurons were similar to those observed after photoactivation of the same neuron by RuBi-Glutamate uncaging (Figure 1G). We also used paired recordings to characterize potential side effects of RuBi-Glutamate and did not observe any significant effect on passive and active membrane properties of the sGFP cells (Table 1) or on the synaptic transmission between sGFP cells and PCs (Table 2). But because of our previous observations (Fino et al., 2009Fino E. Araya R. Peterka D.S. Salierno M. Etchenique R. Yuste R. RuBi-glutamate: two-photon and visible-light photoactivation of neurons and dendritic spines.Front. Neural Circuits. 2009; 3: 2Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar), we also characterized the effect of RuBi-Glutamate on GABAergic currents by patching pairs in control condition and then adding RuBi-Glutamate to the bath (Figure 1H1; Fino et al., 2009Fino E. Araya R. Peterka D.S. Salierno M. Etchenique R. Yuste R. RuBi-glutamate: two-photon and visible-light photoactivation of neurons and dendritic spines.Front. Neural Circuits. 2009; 3: 2Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). At the concentration used in this study (300 μM), RuBi-Glutamate blocked 47.7% ± 10.8% (n = 7) of the monosynaptic IPSCs (Figure 1H2). Nevertheless, we were still able to detect weak inhibitory connections by evoking a burst of APs in the sGFP interneuron rather than a single AP (Figure 1I; n = 3).Table 2Characteristics of Synaptic Transmission between sGFP Interneurons and Layer 2/3 Pyramidal Cells; Lack of Effect of RuBi-GlutamateControl (n = 15)Rubi-Glut (n = 13)StatisticsLatency (ms)1.34 ± 0.111.48 ± 0.26nsRise time (ms)8.33 ± 0.706.94 ± 0.83nsAmplitude (pA)39.30 ± 9.4825.65 ± 9.27nsRate of rise (pA/ms)5.67 ± 1.394.12 ± 1.89nsPot/Dep (%)75.57 ± 7.4580.75 ± 9.44nsSummation (%)125.66 ± 7.24127.06 ± 8.15nsFailure rate (%)4.42 ± 2.098.41 ± 5.90nsPot/Dep, potentiation/depression. Open table in a new tab Pot/Dep, potentiation/depression. We then used two-photon RuBi-Glutamate uncaging to systematically map the connections from sGFP interneurons onto PCs. We first imaged fields of sGFP interneurons and patched a layer 2/3 PC, usually at the border of layers 1 and 2/3, and placed uncaging laser targets onto the somata of each of the sGFP interneurons in the field of view (Figure 2A ). We then sequentially stimulated them with two-photon RuBi-Glutamate uncaging, while recording responses evoked in the PC. sGFP cells were stimulated several times, with different laser powers, with the PC held at either +40 or −40 mV (Figure 2A). This protocol was chosen for two reasons. First, clamping the PC at +40 mV increased the chloride driving force, which allowed us to better detect inhibitory connections, including weaker ones. Second, switching between +40 mV and −40 mV allowed us to distinguish inhibitory, chloride-based responses, which did not reverse sign, from contaminating glutamatergic responses, whose reversal potential is around 0 mV and which therefore switched polarity. This switching test was necessary because, occasionally, two-photon glutamate uncaging of an inhibitory cell resulted in a paradoxical glutamatergic response, which we termed “false-positive” responses. These false positives might arise from direct activation of processes of the recorded PCs (see Niko"

We studied the commencement of the pseudogap state at temperature T* using three different techniques (angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy, polar Kerr effect, and time-resolved reflectivity) on the same optimally-doped Bi2201 crystals. We observed the coincident, abrupt onset at T* of a particle-hole asymmetric antinodal gap in the electronic spectrum, a Kerr rotation in the reflected light polarization, and a change in the ultrafast relaxational dynamics, consistent with a phase transition. Upon further cooling, spectroscopic signatures of superconductivity begin to grow close to the superconducting transition temperature (Tc), entangled in an energy-momentum-dependent fashion with the pre-existing pseudogap features, ushering in a ground state with coexisting orders."

Using data from the Suzaku x-ray telescope, we determined an accurate, spatially resolved census of the gas, metals, and dark matter out to the edge of the Perseus Cluster. Contrary to previous results, our measurements of the cluster baryon fraction are consistent with the expected universal value at half of the virial radius. The apparent baryon fraction exceeds the cosmic mean at larger radii, suggesting a clumpy distribution of the gas, which is important for understanding the ongoing growth of clusters from the surrounding cosmic web."

Here, we investigated the synaptically driven membrane potential dynamics during active whisker sensation using whole-cell recordings from layer 2/3 pyramidal neurons in the primary somatosensory barrel cortex of behaving mice. Although whisker contact with an object evoked rapid depolarization in all neurons, these touch responses only drove action potentials in ∼10% of the cells. Such sparse coding was ensured by cell-specific reversal potentials of the touch-evoked response that were hyperpolarized relative to action potential threshold for most neurons.

For example, eye movements are used to foveate interesting regions of visual space. Self-generated eye movements, therefore, in part determine the visual sensory input that falls upon the retina. Active sensing is also obvious for somatosensation, where finger movements are used to explore object shape and texture. Through internally generated movements, animals thus determine a large part of the sensory information that they receive. In order to understand perception it is therefore important to study how sensory information is actively acquired. The rodent whisker sensorimotor system is an attractive and relatively simple model system for studying mammalian active sensory processing (reviewed in Brecht, 2007Brecht M.

However, little is known about the mechanisms driving the spike coding of whisker sensory perception. Action potentials are driven by synaptic interactions, with the majority of cortical unitary postsynaptic potentials being small in amplitude evoking only subthreshold changes in membrane potential (Vm) (Crochet et al., 2005Crochet S.

However, there are important changes in cortical dynamics during active sensory exploration compared to quiet wakefulness or anesthesia. Quiet wakefulness is characterized in layer 2/3 neurons of mouse barrel cortex by large-amplitude, slow (1–5 Hz), and highly synchronized Vm fluctuations; a low firing rate of pyramidal cells and non-fast-spiking GABAergic neurons; but a high firing rate of fast-spiking GABAergic neurons (Crochet and Petersen, 2006Crochet S.

During active whisking in air, the slow activity is suppressed and barrel cortex neurons exhibit fast low-amplitude Vm fluctuations that are less correlated in nearby neurons and the input resistance of pyramidal cells is slightly reduced (Crochet and Petersen, 2006Crochet S. Petersen C.C.H. Correlating whisker behavior with membrane potential in barrel cortex of awake mice.Nat.

The firing rate of pyramidal cells on average does not change significantly between quiet and whisking states; but the activity of GABAergic neurons is reorganized such that non-fast-spiking GABAergic neurons increase firing rates during whisking, whereas fast-spiking GABAergic neurons decrease firing rates, resulting in similar firing rates of both classes of GABAergic neurons during whisking (Crochet and Petersen, 2006Crochet S.

These profound changes in cortical network dynamics also correlate with dramatic changes in sensory processing (Fanselow and Nicolelis, 1999Fanselow E.E. Nicolelis M.A.L.

It is therefore of crucial importance to study Vm dynamics in awake animals actively sensing and exposed to natural stimuli. Here, through whole-cell Vm recordings of layer 2/3 pyramidal neurons in the mouse barrel cortex, we investigate how tactile information from a single whisker (C2) is processed during active touch. Sensory information relating to the C2 whisker is signaled to the C2 barrel column of primary somatosensory cortex, an anatomically defined region of the mouse brain with a diameter of approximately 250 μm containing around 6500 neurons (Lefort et al., 2009Lefort S.

Investigations of this specific cortical column have begun to yield quantitative information relating to its synaptic structure (Knott et al., 2002Knott G.W. Quairiaux C. Genoud C. Welker E.

The convergence of techniques focusing upon a single well-defined cortical column may help toward a quantitative and mechanistic understanding of how a specific neocortical microcircuit processes sensory information. Whole-cell recordings were obtained from head-restrained mice and the Vm dynamics of layer 2/3 neurons located in the C2 barrel column were correlated with C2 whisker-related behavior through high-speed filming (500 Hz) under infrared illumination (Figures 1A and 1B ). Objects could be inserted on the millisecond timescale into the trajectory of the C2 whisker in one of two different locations using piezoactuators (schematically indicated as red and blue objects in Figure 1A). The C2 whisker-related behavior was quantified off-line based on the high-speed filming (Figure 1C; Movies S1 and S2 available online). We distinguished between three different behavioral periods (Figures 1B and 1C): free whisking (W, when both piezoactuators were raised up and the whisker moved back and forth freely without touching any object); active touch (T, when one of the piezoactuators was lowered and the mouse actively moved the C2 whisker repetitively against the object causing a bending of the whisker); and quiet wakefulness (Q, when the awake mouse was not moving its whisker). The recorded neurons were labeled with biocytin for post-hoc anatomical identification and location relative to the barrel map (Figure 1D). Membrane potential dynamics evoked by C2 whisker touch (Figure 1E) were compared with periods of free whisking and quiet waking. We analyzed data from 18 whole-cell recordings of layer 2/3 cells in the C2 barrel column (each cell was recorded in a different mouse), of which 14 were sufficiently well-stained to be anatomically identified and found to be pyramidal neurons (Table S1). On average the Vm was most hyperpolarized during quiet waking (Q; mean ± standard deviation [SD] −60.5 ± 7.5 mV; median −60.7 mV; range −73.8 to −44.7 mV), depolarized during free whisking (W; mean ± SD −58.4 ± 8.3 mV; median −57.7 mV; range −73.7 to −36.9 mV), and was significantly more depolarized during active touch (T; mean ± SD −55.4 ± 7.7 mV; median −57.2 mV; range −70.6 to −37.0 mV) (Figure 2A and Table S2). Compared to free whisking, during an active touch sequence the Vm of layer 2/3 neurons on average depolarized by 3.0 ± 2.9 mV (median 3.0 mV; range −2.2 to +6.9 mV). Vm variance was significantly lower during free whisking than during quiet wakefulness or active touch (Figure 2B). The low Vm variance during free whisking (when there is no incoming touch information) may help provide a reduced noise background enhancing the detection of sensory-evoked signals during active touch. The mean action potential firing rates (Figure 2C and Table S2) indicate that spike rates increased during active touch (1.7 ± 5.0 Hz; median 0.2 Hz; range 0.0 to 20.8 Hz) as compared to quiet wakefulness (0.2 ± 0.2 Hz; median 0.1 Hz; range 0.0 to 0.5 Hz) and free whisking (0.3 ± 0.9 Hz; median 0.04 Hz; range 0.0 to 3.9 Hz). For most neurons the firing rate of layer 2/3 pyramidal cells remained low in all conditions, in good agreement with recent awake extracellular recordings of identified layer 2/3 pyramidal cells (de Kock and Sakmann, 2009de Kock C.P.

Low-frequency Vm dynamics dominated the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) during all behavioral periods, with a near linear decrease at higher frequencies when plotted on log-log scale axes (Figure 2D) similar to observations from EEG recordings (Buzsáki and Draguhn, 2004Buzsáki G.

High-frequency Vm changes (30 to 100 Hz) were significantly increased during active touch compared to quiet wakefulness or free whisking (Figures 2D and 2E). These higher-frequency Vm dynamics are likely to be driven by the rapid and large-amplitude depolarizations evoked by individual touch responses. Analysis on the millisecond timescale revealed further important correlations between the C2 whisker-related behavior and neuronal Vm. We averaged the Vm across many individual whisking cycles aligned to the peak of protraction during free whisking and found small-amplitude phase-locked Vm fluctuations, which weakly influenced action potential firing (Figure 3A and Figure S1) (Fee et al., 1997Fee M.S.

Averaging traces aligned to the onset of whisker-object contact revealed a rapid and large-amplitude depolarizing touch response in many neurons, which was accompanied in some neurons by a transient elevation of action potential firing (Figure 3B). We found that all C2 column layer 2/3 neurons responded significantly to C2 whisker-object contact by a transient depolarization, whereas only 11/17 neurons showed significant free whisking Vm modulation (Table S2). The touch-evoked postsynaptic potential (PSP) response was much larger than the free whisking Vm modulation for every recorded neuron in layer 2/3 (touch to whisk ratio: mean 73 ± 253; median 10.6; range 3.6 to 1056.0); and, similarly, the change in spike rates evoked by active contacts was much larger than the free whisking spike rate modulation (Figure 3C). Although all layer 2/3 neurons responded with a significant depolarizing touch-evoked PSP, action potential firing in response to whisker-object contact occurred only in a small subset of the neurons. The mean probability that a layer 2/3 neuron in the C2 barrel column fires at least one action potential within the next 50 ms following a contact of the C2 whisker with an object was 0.10 ± 0.21 (median 0.03; range 0.00 to 0.88) (Figure 4A and Table S2). Thus about 10% of the layer 2/3 pyramidal neurons in the aligned cortical column fire in response to each principal whisker-object contact. Only one neuron in our data set fired reliably, and it appears that a very small number of neurons contribute to most of the evoked spiking activity (only 4/18 cells discharged with a probability above 10% per contact, whereas 5/18 cells never fired in response to active touch). Neurons located in deeper layer 2/3 fired significantly more touch-evoked action potentials at significantly shorter latencies (Figure 4A). Whole-cell recordings could alter the firing probability of the recorded neurons. In order to examine this possibility, we performed an independent set of experiments recording action potential activity extracellularly. To specifically record from excitatory neurons, we targeted the recording electrode to GFP-negative neurons (n = 16 neurons in 8 mice) visualized through two-photon microscopy in the GAD67-GFP knockin mouse, in which all layer 2/3 GABAergic neurons express GFP (Tamamaki et al., 2003Tamamaki N.

Touch-evoked action potential firing in these juxtacellular recordings of layer 2/3 excitatory neurons was sparse. The mean probability of firing an action potential within 50 ms of a contact was 0.12 ± 0.23 (median 0.02; range 0.00 to 0.87). Only 4/16 excitatory neurons fired with a probability of above 10% per contact, whereas 5/16 excitatory neurons never fired in response to active touch. The distribution of spiking probability across the population of excitatory neurons was therefore very similar in juxtacellular recordings to that found with whole-cell recordings (Figure 4A, compare intra with juxta). Although significant in all C2 column neurons, the PSP response to active touch varied strongly from cell to cell in amplitude (mean 6.3 ± 3.0 mV; median 6.7 mV; range 0.5 to 11.0 mV); latency (mean 8.6 ± 2.7 ms; median 8.7 ms; range 5.3 to 12.7 ms); time-to-peak (mean 16.0 ± 9.9 ms; median 13.8 ms; range 4.9 to 37.2 ms); duration (mean 52.5 ± 27.0 ms; median 51.8 ms; range 9.1 to 103.1 ms); and rate of rise (slope, mean 0.56 ± 0.49 V/s; median 0.41 V/s; range 0.09 to 1.52 V/s) (Figures 4B). Cells with shorter latency tended to exhibit larger-amplitude subthreshold responses and neurons exhibiting a fast time-to-peak also tended to have a shorter-duration response (data not shown). Neurons recorded deeper in L2/3 responded with PSPs of larger-amplitude depolarizations, shorter latencies, shorter-duration responses, and faster rates of rise (PSP slope) (Figure 4B). Therefore, deeper neurons, located in layer 3, preferentially signal each individual contact with high temporal precision, whereas the more superficial layer 2 neurons preferentially integrate touch responses over a longer timescale. Nine identified layer 2/3 pyramidal neurons were recorded in adjacent barrel columns (Table S1). The grand averaged response to active touch of the C2 whisker with an object reveals a smaller amplitude response with longer latency in the surrounding cortical columns, but otherwise sharing a similar range of response properties (Figure S2).

In this survey of synchronized firing by suspected MCs in awake, behaving vertebrates, we find the surprising result that synchronized firing conveys information on odor value (“Is it rewarded?”) rather than odor identity (“What is the odor?”). We observed that as mice learned to discriminate between odors, synchronous firing responses to the rewarded and unrewarded odors became divergent. Furthermore, adrenergic blockage decreases the magnitude of odor divergence of synchronous trains, suggesting that MCs contribute to decision-making through adrenergic-modulated synchronized firing. Thus, in the olfactory system information on stimulus reward is found in MCs one synapse away from the sensory neuron."
https://openalex.org/W2089735482,"Fibroblast growth factor 19 (FGF19) is a hormone-like protein that regulates carbohydrate, lipid and bile acid metabolism. At supra-physiological doses, FGF19 also increases hepatocyte proliferation and induces hepatocellular carcinogenesis in mice. Much of FGF19 activity is attributed to the activation of the liver enriched FGF Receptor 4 (FGFR4), although FGF19 can activate other FGFRs in vitro in the presence of the coreceptor βKlotho (KLB). In this report, we investigate the role of FGFR4 in mediating FGF19 activity by using Fgfr4 deficient mice as well as a variant of FGF19 protein (FGF19v) which is specifically impaired in activating FGFR4. Our results demonstrate that FGFR4 activation mediates the induction of hepatocyte proliferation and the suppression of bile acid biosynthesis by FGF19, but is not essential for FGF19 to improve glucose and lipid metabolism in high fat diet fed mice as well as in leptin-deficient ob/ob mice. Thus, FGF19 acts through multiple receptor pathways to elicit pleiotropic effects in regulating nutrient metabolism and cell proliferation."

https://openalex.org/W2002882682,"Leptothrix ochracea is a common inhabitant of freshwater iron seeps and iron-rich wetlands. Its defining characteristic is copious production of extracellular sheaths encrusted with iron oxyhydroxides. Surprisingly, over 90% of these sheaths are empty, hence, what appears to be an abundant population of iron-oxidizing bacteria, consists of relatively few cells. Because L. ochracea has proven difficult to cultivate, its identification is based solely on habitat preference and morphology. We utilized cultivation-independent techniques to resolve this long-standing enigma. By selecting the actively growing edge of a Leptothrix-containing iron mat, a conventional SSU rRNA gene clone library was obtained that had 29 clones (42% of the total library) related to the Leptothrix/Sphaerotilus group (≤96% identical to cultured representatives). A pyrotagged library of the V4 hypervariable region constructed from the bulk mat showed that 7.2% of the total sequences also belonged to the Leptothrix/Sphaerotilus group. Sorting of individual L. ochracea sheaths, followed by whole genome amplification (WGA) and PCR identified a SSU rRNA sequence that clustered closely with the putative Leptothrix clones and pyrotags. Using these data, a fluorescence in-situ hybridization (FISH) probe, Lepto175, was designed that bound to ensheathed cells. Quantitative use of this probe demonstrated that up to 35% of microbial cells in an actively accreting iron mat were L. ochracea. The SSU rRNA gene of L. ochracea shares 96% homology with its closet cultivated relative, L. cholodnii, This establishes that L. ochracea is indeed related to this group of morphologically similar, filamentous, sheathed microorganisms."

Here, we assessed early active MS lesions in brain biopsies obtained from 16 patients with MS by FOXP3 immunohistochemistry. In addition, we used six-color flow cytometry to determine numbers of Treg by analysis of FOXP3/CD127 expression in peripheral blood and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of 17 treatment-naïve MS patients as well as quantities of apoptosis sensitive CD45RO(hi)CD95(hi) cells in circulating and CSF Treg subsets. Absolute numbers of FOXP3(+) and CD4(+) cells were rather low in MS brain lesions and Treg were not detectable in 30% of MS biopsies despite the presence of CD4(+) cell infiltrates. In contrast, Treg were detectable in all CSF samples and Treg with a CD45RO(hi)CD95(hi) phenotype previously shown to be highly apoptosis sensitive were found to be enriched in the CSF compared to peripheral blood of MS patients.

Many miRNAs are being discovered and studied, but in most cases their origin, evolution and function remain unclear. Here, we characterized miRNAs derived from repetitive elements and miRNA families expanded by segmental duplication events in the human, rhesus and mouse genomes. We applied a comparative genomics approach combined with identifying miRNA paralogs in segmental duplication pair data in a genome-wide study to identify new homologs of human miRNAs in the rhesus and mouse genomes. Interestingly, using segmental duplication pair data, we provided credible computational evidence that two miRNA genes are located in the pseudoautosomal region of the human Y chromosome. We characterized all the miRNAs whether they were derived from repetitive elements or not and identified significant differences between the repeat-related miRNAs (RrmiRs) and non-repeat-derived miRNAs in (1) their location in protein-coding and intergenic regions in genomes, (2) the minimum free energy of their hairpin structures, and (3) their conservation in vertebrate genomes. We found some lineage-specific RrmiR families and three lineage-specific expansion families, and provided evidence indicating that some RrmiR families formed and expanded during evolutionary segmental duplication events. We also provided computational and experimental evidence for the functions of the conservative RrmiR families in the three species. Together, our results indicate that repetitive elements contribute to the origin of miRNAs, and large segmental duplication events could prompt the expansion of some miRNA families, including RrmiR families.

Many of these changes, such as human disturbance, have an anthropogenic origin and therefore may be mitigated by management action. To do so requires an understanding of the impact of human activities and changing environmental conditions on population dynamics. We investigated the influence of human activity on important life history parameters (reproductive rate, and body condition, and growth rate of neonate pups) for California sea lions (Zalophus californianus) in the Gulf of California, Mexico. Increased human presence was associated with lower reproductive rates, which translated into reduced long-term population growth rates and suggested that human activities are a disturbance that could lead to population declines. We also observed higher body growth rates in pups with increased exposure to humans. Increased growth rates in pups may reflect a density dependent response to declining reproductive rates (e.g., decreased competition for resources). Our results highlight the potentially complex changes in life history parameters that may result from human disturbance, and their implication for population dynamics. We recommend careful monitoring of human activities in the Gulf of California and emphasize the importance of management strategies that explicitly consider the potential impact of human activities such as ecotourism on vertebrate populations."

https://openalex.org/W2046766809,"Contractile vacuole complexes are critical components of cell volume regulation and have been shown to have other functional roles in several free-living protists. However, very little is known about the functions of the contractile vacuole complex of the parasite Trypanosoma cruzi, the etiologic agent of Chagas disease, other than a role in osmoregulation. Identification of the protein composition of these organelles is important for understanding their physiological roles. We applied a combined proteomic and bioinfomatic approach to identify proteins localized to the contractile vacuole. Proteomic analysis of a T. cruzi fraction enriched for contractile vacuoles and analyzed by one-dimensional gel electrophoresis and LC-MS/MS resulted in the addition of 109 newly detected proteins to the group of expressed proteins of epimastigotes. We also identified different peptides that map to at least 39 members of the dispersed gene family 1 (DGF-1) providing evidence that many members of this family are simultaneously expressed in epimastigotes. Of the proteins present in the fraction we selected several homologues with known localizations in contractile vacuoles of other organisms and others that we expected to be present in these vacuoles on the basis of their potential roles. We determined the localization of each by expression as GFP-fusion proteins or with specific antibodies. Six of these putative proteins (Rab11, Rab32, AP180, ATPase subunit B, VAMP1, and phosphate transporter) predominantly localized to the vacuole bladder. TcSNARE2.1, TcSNARE2.2, and calmodulin localized to the spongiome. Calmodulin was also cytosolic. Our results demonstrate the utility of combining subcellular fractionation, proteomic analysis, and bioinformatic approaches for localization of organellar proteins that are difficult to detect with whole cell methodologies.

https://openalex.org/W2082146887,"Background Productive thymopoiesis is essential for a robust and healthy immune system. Thymus unfortunately is acutely sensitive to stress resulting in involution and decreased T cell production. Thymic involution is a complication of many clinical settings, including infection, malnutrition, starvation, and irradiation or immunosuppressive therapies. Systemic rises in glucocorticoids and inflammatory cytokines are known to contribute to thymic atrophy. Little is known, however, about intrathymic mechanisms that may actively contribute to thymus atrophy or initiate thymic recovery following stress events. Methodology/Principal Findings Phenotypic, histologic and transcriptome/pathway analysis of murine thymic tissue during the early stages of endotoxemia-induced thymic involution was performed to identify putative mechanisms that drive thymic involution during stress. Thymus atrophy in this murine model was confirmed by down-regulation of genes involved in T cell development, cell activation, and cell cycle progression, correlating with observed phenotypic and histologic thymus involution. Significant gene changes support the hypothesis that multiple key intrathymic pathways are differentially activated during stress-induced thymic involution. These included direct activation of thymus tissue by LPS through TLR signaling, local expression of inflammatory cytokines, inhibition of T cell signaling, and induction of wound healing/tissue remodeling. Conclusions/Significance Taken together, these observations demonstrated that in addition to the classic systemic response, a direct intrathymic response to endotoxin challenge concurrently contributes to thymic involution during endotoxemia. These findings are a substantial advancement over current understanding of thymus response to stress and may lead to the development of novel therapeutic approaches to ameliorate immune deficiency associated with stress events."

https://openalex.org/W2031908008,"The Wnt signaling pathway is a robust regulator of skeletal homeostasis. Gain-of-function mutations promote high bone mass, whereas loss of Lrp5 or Lrp6 co-receptors decrease bone mass. Similarly, mutations in antagonists of Wnt signaling influence skeletal integrity, in an inverse relation to Lrp receptor mutations. Loss of the Wnt antagonist Sclerostin (Sost) produces the generalized skeletal hyperostotic condition of sclerosteosis, which is characterized by increased bone mass and density due to hyperactive osteoblast function. Here we demonstrate that prostaglandin E2 (PGE2), a paracrine factor with pleiotropic effects on osteoblasts and osteoclasts, decreases Sclerostin expression in osteoblastic UMR106.01 cells. Decreased Sost expression correlates with increased expression of Wnt/TCF target genes Axin2 and Tcf3. We also show that the suppressive effect of PGE2 is mediated through a cyclic AMP/PKA pathway. Furthermore, selective agonists for the PGE2 receptor EP2 mimic the effect of PGE2 upon Sost, and siRNA reduction in Ptger2 prevents PGE2-induced Sost repression. These results indicate a functional relationship between prostaglandins and the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway in bone."

More recently, Y. pestis is one of several bacterial pathogens considered to be a potential agent of bioterrorism. Thus, elucidating potential mechanisms of survival and persistence in the environment would be important in the event of an intentional release of the organism. One such mechanism is entry into the viable but non-culturable (VBNC) state, as has been demonstrated for several other bacterial pathogens. In this study, we showed that Y. pestis became nonculturable by normal laboratory methods after 21 days in a low-temperature tap water microcosm. We further show evidence that, after the loss of culturability, the cells remained viable by using a variety of criteria, including cellular membrane integrity, uptake and incorporation of radiolabeled amino acids, and protection of genomic DNA from DNase I digestion. Additionally, we identified morphological and ultrastructural characteristics of Y. pestis VBNC cells, such as cell rounding and large periplasmic spaces, by electron microscopy, which are consistent with entry into the VBNC state in other bacteria. Finally, we demonstrated resuscitation of a small number of the non-culturable cells. This study provides compelling evidence that Y. pestis persists in a low-temperature tap water microcosm in a viable state yet is unable to be cultured under normal laboratory conditions, which may prove useful in risk assessment and remediation efforts, particularly in the event of an intentional release of this organism."

We examined how smokers' tax avoidance and smoking cessation Internet search queries were motivated by the United States' (US) 2009 State Children's Health Insurance Program (SCHIP) federal cigarette excise tax increase and two other state specific tax increases. Google keyword searches among residents in a taxed geography (US or US state) were compared to an untaxed geography (Canada) for two years around each tax increase. Search data were normalized to a relative search volume (RSV) scale, where the highest search proportion was labeled 100 with lesser proportions scaled by how they relatively compared to the highest proportion. Changes in RSV were estimated by comparing means during and after the tax increase to means before the tax increase, across taxed and untaxed geographies. The SCHIP tax was associated with an 11.8% (95% confidence interval [95%CI], 5.7 to 17.9; p<.001) immediate increase in cessation searches; however, searches quickly abated and approximated differences from pre-tax levels in Canada during the months after the tax. Tax avoidance searches increased 27.9% (95%CI, 15.9 to 39.9; p<.001) and 5.3% (95%CI, 3.6 to 7.1; p<.001) during and in the months after the tax compared to Canada, respectively, suggesting avoidance is the more pronounced and durable response. Trends were similar for state-specific tax increases but suggest strong interactive processes across taxes. When the SCHIP tax followed Florida's tax, versus not, it promoted more cessation and avoidance searches. Efforts to combat tax avoidance and increase cessation may be enhanced by using interventions targeted and tailored to smokers' searches. Search query surveillance is a valuable real-time, free and public method, that may be generalized to other behavioral, biological, informational or psychological outcomes manifested online."

Extensive in vivo studies of PDGF and its receptor (PDGFR) genes have reported that PDGF plays an important role in embryogenesis and development of the central nervous system (CNS). Furthermore, PDGF and the β subunit of the PDGF receptor (PDGFR-β) have been reported to be associated with schizophrenia and autism. However, no study has reported on the effects of PDGF deletion on mice behavior. Here we generated novel mutant mice (PDGFR-β KO) in which PDGFR-β was conditionally deleted in CNS neurons using the Cre/loxP system. Mice without the Cre transgene but with floxed PDGFR-β were used as controls. Both groups of mice reached adulthood without any apparent anatomical defects. These mice were further examined by conducting several behavioral tests for spatial memory, social interaction, conditioning, prepulse inhibition, and forced swimming. The test results indicated that the PDGFR-β KO mice show deficits in all of these areas. Furthermore, an immunohistochemical study of the PDGFR-β KO mice brain indicated that the number of parvalbumin (calcium-binding protein)-positive (i.e., putatively γ-aminobutyric acid-ergic) neurons was low in the amygdala, hippocampus, and medial prefrontal cortex. Neurophysiological studies indicated that sensory-evoked gamma oscillation was low in the PDGFR-β KO mice, consistent with the observed reduction in the number of parvalbumin-positive neurons. These results suggest that PDGFR-β plays an important role in cognitive and socioemotional functions, and that deficits in this receptor may partly underlie the cognitive and socioemotional deficits observed in schizophrenic and autistic patients."

Split-sample approach was employed to internally validate the data.Ninety Taiwanese patients with RCVS and 180 age- and gender-matched normal controls of the same ethnicity completed the study. The genotype frequencies did not differ between patients and controls. Compared to patients with Met/Met homozygosity, patients with Val allele had higher mean vasoconstriction scores of all arterial segments (1.60±0.72 vs. 0.87±0.39, p<0.001), V(MCA) values (116.7±36.2 vs. 82.7±17.9 cm/s, p<0.001), and LI (2.41±0.91 vs. 1.89±0.41, p = 0.001). None of the Met/Met homozygotes, but 38.9% of the Val carriers, had V(MCA) values of >120 cm/s (p<0.001). Split-sample validation by randomization, age, entry time or residence of patients demonstrated concordant findings.Our findings link BDNF Val66Met polymorphism with the severity of RCVS for the first time and implicate possible pathogenic mechanisms for vasoconstriction in RCVS."

https://openalex.org/W2011808463,"Significant progress has been made in isolating novel alkaline β-mannanases, however, there is a paucity of information concerning the structural basis for alkaline tolerance displayed by these β-mannanases. We report the catalytic domain structure of an industrially important β-mannanase from the alkaliphilic Bacillus sp. N16-5 (BSP165 MAN) at a resolution of 1.6 Å. This enzyme, classified into subfamily 8 in glycosyl hydrolase family 5 (GH5), has a pH optimum of enzymatic activity at pH 9.5 and folds into a classic (β/α)8-barrel. In order to gain insight into molecular features for alkaline adaptation, we compared BSP165 MAN with previously reported GH5 β-mannanases. It was revealed that BSP165 MAN and other subfamily 8 β-mannanases have significantly increased hydrophobic and Arg residues content and decreased polar residues, comparing to β-mannanases of subfamily 7 or 10 in GH5 which display optimum activities at lower pH. Further, extensive structural comparisons show alkaline β-mannanases possess a set of distinctive features. Position and length of some helices, strands and loops of the TIM barrel structures are changed, which contributes, to a certain degree, to the distinctly different shaped (β/α)8-barrels, thus affecting the catalytic environment of these enzymes. The number of negatively charged residues is increased on the molecular surface, and fewer polar residues are exposed to the solvent. Two amino acid substitutions in the vicinity of the acid/base catalyst were proposed to be possibly responsible for the variation in pH optimum of these homologous enzymes in subfamily 8 of GH5, identified by sequence homology analysis and pKa calculations of the active site residues. Mutational analysis has proved that Gln91 and Glu226 are important for BSP165 MAN to function at high pH. These findings are proposed to be possible factors implicated in the alkaline adaptation of GH5 β-mannanases and will help to further understanding of alkaline adaptation mechanism."
https://openalex.org/W2094679544,"Liver regeneration is clinically of major importance in the setting of liver injury, resection or transplantation. We have demonstrated that the NF-κB inhibitory protein A20 significantly improves recovery of liver function and mass following extended liver resection (LR) in mice. In this study, we explored the Systems Biology modulated by A20 following extended LR in mice.We performed transcriptional profiling using Affymetrix-Mouse 430.2 arrays on liver mRNA retrieved from recombinant adenovirus A20 (rAd.A20) and rAd.βgalactosidase treated livers, before and 24 hours after 78% LR. A20 overexpression impacted 1595 genes that were enriched for biological processes related to inflammatory and immune responses, cellular proliferation, energy production, oxidoreductase activity, and lipid and fatty acid metabolism. These pathways were modulated by A20 in a manner that favored decreased inflammation, heightened proliferation, and optimized metabolic control and energy production. Promoter analysis identified several transcriptional factors that implemented the effects of A20, including NF-κB, CEBPA, OCT-1, OCT-4 and EGR1. Interactive scale-free network analysis captured the key genes that delivered the specific functions of A20. Most of these genes were affected at basal level and after resection. We validated a number of A20's target genes by real-time PCR, including p21, the mitochondrial solute carriers SLC25a10 and SLC25a13, and the fatty acid metabolism regulator, peroxisome proliferator activated receptor alpha. This resulted in greater energy production in A20-expressing livers following LR, as demonstrated by increased enzymatic activity of cytochrome c oxidase, or mitochondrial complex IV.This Systems Biology-based analysis unravels novel mechanisms supporting the pro-regenerative function of A20 in the liver, by optimizing energy production through improved lipid/fatty acid metabolism, and down-regulated inflammation. These findings support pursuit of A20-based therapies to improve patients' outcomes in the context of extreme liver injury and extensive LR for tumor treatment or donation."
https://openalex.org/W2073303636,"Human enteroviruses (HEV) are frequent human pathogens and, associated in particular with large outbreaks of aseptic meningitis. Here, we have compiled a database of clinical HEV isolates from the Public Hospitals of Marseille, from 1985 to 2005. Amongst 654 isolates that could be characterized by complete sequencing of the VP1 gene, 98% belonged to species HEV-B; the most frequently isolated serotypes were Echovirus E30, E11, E7, E6 and E4. The high incidence of E30 and the recent emergence of E13 are consistent with reports worldwide and peak HEV isolation occurred mostly in the late spring and summer months. The proportion of echoviruses has decreased across the years, while that of coxsackieviruses has increased. Stool (the most frequent sample type) allowed detection of all identified serotypes. MRC5 (Human lung fibroblasts) cell line was the most conducive cell line for HEV isolation (84.9% of 10 most common serotype isolates, 96.3% in association with BGM (Buffalo green monkey kidney cells)). Previous seroneutralization-based serotype identification demonstrated 55.4% accuracy when compared with molecular VP1 analysis. Our analysis of a large number of clinical strains over 20 years reinforced the validity of VP1 serotyping and showed that comparative p-distance scores can be coupled with phylogenetic analysis to provide non-ambiguous serotype identification. Phylogenetic analysis in the VP1, 2C and 3D regions also provided evidence for recombination events amongst clinical isolates. In particular, it identified isolates with dissimilar VP1 but almost identical nonstructural regions."
https://openalex.org/W1991034431,"Background The identification of clinically meaningful and predictive models of disposition kinetics for cancer therapeutics is an ongoing pursuit in drug development. In particular, the growing interest in preclinical evaluation of anti-angiogenic agents alone or in combination with other drugs requires a complete understanding of the associated physiological consequences. Methodology/Principal Findings Technescan™ PYP™, a clinically utilized radiopharmaceutical, was used to measure tissue vascular volumes in beige nude mice that were naïve or administered a single intravenous bolus dose of a murine anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (anti-VEGF) antibody (10 mg/kg) 24 h prior to assay. Anti-VEGF had no significant effect (p>0.05) on the fractional vascular volumes of any tissues studied; these findings were further supported by single photon emission computed tomographic imaging. In addition, apart from a borderline significant increase (p = 0.048) in mean hepatic blood flow, no significant anti-VEGF-induced differences were observed (p>0.05) in two additional physiological parameters, interstitial fluid volume and the organ blood flow rate, measured using indium-111-pentetate and rubidium-86 chloride, respectively. Areas under the concentration-time curves generated by a physiologically-based pharmacokinetic model changed substantially (>25%) in several tissues when model parameters describing compartmental volumes and blood flow rates were switched from literature to our experimentally derived values. However, negligible changes in predicted tissue exposure were observed when comparing simulations based on parameters measured in naïve versus anti-VEGF-administered mice. Conclusions/Significance These observations may foster an enhanced understanding of anti-VEGF effects in murine tissues and, in particular, may be useful in modeling antibody uptake alone or in combination with anti-VEGF."
https://openalex.org/W2067815025,"Normal breast epithelial cells require insulin and EGF for growth in serum-free media. We previously demonstrated that over expression of breast cancer oncogenes transforms MCF10A cells to an insulin-independent phenotype. Additionally, most breast cancer cell lines are insulin-independent for growth. In this study, we investigated the mechanism by which oncogene over expression transforms MCF10A cells to an insulin-independent phenotype. Analysis of the effects of various concentrations of insulin and/or IGF-I on proliferation of MCF10A cells demonstrated that some of the effects of insulin were independent from those of IGF-I, suggesting that oncogene over expression drives a true insulin-independent proliferative phenotype. To test this hypothesis, we examined metabolic functions of insulin signaling in insulin-dependent and insulin-independent cells. HER2 over expression in MCF10A cells resulted in glucose uptake in the absence of insulin at a rate equal to insulin-induced glucose uptake in non-transduced cells. We found that a diverse set of oncogenes induced the same result. To gain insight into how HER2 oncogene signaling affected increased insulin-independent glucose uptake we compared HER2-regulated gene expression signatures in MCF10A and HER2 over expressing MCF10A cells by differential analysis of time series gene expression data from cells treated with a HER2 inhibitor. This analysis identified genes specifically regulated by the HER2 oncogene, including VAMP8 and PHGDH, which have known functions in glucose uptake and processing of glycolytic intermediates, respectively. Moreover, these genes specifically implicated in HER2 oncogene-driven transformation are commonly altered in human breast cancer cells. These results highlight the diversity of oncogene effects on cell regulatory pathways and the importance of oncogene-driven metabolic transformation in breast cancer."
https://openalex.org/W1996123270,"The etiology of anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies (ANCA) associated vasculitides (AAV) is unknown, but the association between infections and autoimmunity has been studied extensively. In 2004, a novel theory was proposed that could link infection and autoimmunity. This ‘theory of autoantigen complementarity’ was based on the serendipitous finding of antibodies against complementary-PR3 (cPR3) in patients with PR3-ANCA-associated vasculitis. cPR3 demonstrated homology to several bacterial proteins, and it was hypothesized that PR3-ANCA develop in response to anti-cPR3 antibodies, as a consequence of the anti-idiotypic network. These data have not been confirmed in other patient cohorts. We investigated the presence of anti-cPR3 antibodies in a Dutch cohort of PR3-ANCA-associated vasculitis patients. Anti-cPR3 reactivity was determined in serum using ELISA. Two separate batches of cPR3 were used to determine reactivity in two separate cohorts of PR3-ANCA-associated vasculitis patients. We found that anti-cPR3-reactivity was not increased in our PR3-ANCA-associated vasculitis patients, in comparison to control groups. Further research will be necessary to prove the concept of autoantigen complementarity in autoimmune diseases."
https://openalex.org/W1974667945,"Background Insect repellents are prophylactic tools against a number of vector-borne diseases. There is growing demand for repellents outperforming DEET in cost and safety, but with the current technologies R&D of a new product takes almost 10 years, with a prohibitive cost of $30 million dollar in part due to the demand for large-scale synthesis of thousands of test compounds of which only 1 may reach the market. R&D could be expedited and cost dramatically reduced with a molecular/physiological target to streamline putative repellents for final efficacy and toxicological tests. Methodology Using olfactory-based choice assay we show here that the fruit fly is repelled by not only DEET, but also IR3535 and picaridin thus suggesting they might have “generic repellent detector(s),” which may be of practical applications in new repellent screenings. We performed single unit recordings from all olfactory sensilla in the antennae and maxillary palps. Although the ab3A neuron in the wild type flies responded to picaridin, it was unresponsive to DEET and IR3535. By contrast, a neuron housed in the palp basiconic sensilla pb1 responded to DEET, IR3535, and picaridin, with apparent sensitivity higher than that of the DEET detectors in the mosquitoes Culex quinquefasciatus and Aedes aegypti. DmOr42a was transplanted from pb1 to the “empty neuron” and showed to be sensitive to the three insect repellents. Conclusions For the first time we have demonstrated that the fruit fly avoids not only DEET but also IR3535 and picaridin, and identified an olfactory receptor neuron (ORN), which is sensitive to these three major insect repellents. We have also identified the insect repellent-sensitive receptor, DmOr42a. This generic detector fulfils the requirements for a simplified bioassay for early screening of test insect repellents."
https://openalex.org/W2093284342,"A simple and efficient DNA delivery method to introduce extrachromosomal DNA into mosquito embryos would significantly aid functional genomic studies. The conventional method for delivery of DNA into insects is to inject the DNA directly into the embryos. Taking advantage of the unique aspects of mosquito reproductive physiology during vitellogenesis and an in vivo transfection reagent that mediates DNA uptake in cells via endocytosis, we have developed a new method to introduce DNA into mosquito embryos vertically via microinjection of DNA vectors in vitellogenic females without directly manipulating the embryos. Our method was able to introduce inducible gene expression vectors transiently into F0 mosquitoes to perform functional studies in vivo without transgenic lines. The high efficiency of expression knockdown was reproducible with more than 70% of the F0 individuals showed sufficient gene expression suppression (<30% of the controls' levels). At the cohort level, AeSCP-2 expression knockdown in early instar larvae resulted in detectable phenotypes of the expression deficiency such as high mortality, lowered fertility, and distorted sex ratio after induction of AeSCP-2 siRNA expression in vivo. The results further confirmed the important role of AeSCP-2 in the development and reproduction of A. aegypti. In this study, we proved that extrachromosaomal transient expression of an inducible gene from a DNA vector vertically delivered via vitellogenic females can be used to manipulate gene expression in F0 generation. This new method will be a simple and efficient tool for in vivo functional genomic studies in mosquitoes."
https://openalex.org/W2090301564,"Human mismatch repair proteins MSH2-MSH6 play an essential role in maintaining genetic stability and preventing disease. While protein functions have been extensively studied, the substantial amino-terminal region (NTR*) of MSH6 that is unique to eukaryotic proteins, has mostly evaded functional characterization. We demonstrate that a cluster of three nuclear localization signals (NLS) in the NTR direct nuclear import. Individual NLSs are capable of partially directing cytoplasmic protein into the nucleus; however only cooperative effects between all three NLSs efficiently transport MSH6 into the nucleus. In striking contrast to yeast and previous assumptions on required heterodimerization, human MSH6 does not determine localization of its heterodimeric partner, MSH2. A cancer-derived mutation localized between two of the three NLS significantly decreases nuclear localization of MSH6, suggesting altered protein localization can contribute to carcinogenesis. These results clarify the pending speculations on the functional role of the NTR in human MSH6 and identify a novel, cooperative nuclear localization signal."
https://openalex.org/W2006263875,"We aimed to investigate how lean body mass is related to circulating Interleukin 18 (IL-18) and its association with metabolic syndrome (MetS) among apparently healthy Chinese.A population-based sample of 1059 Chinese men and women aged 35-54 years was used to measure plasma IL-18, glucose, insulin, lipid profile, inflammatory markers and high-molecular-weight (HMW)-adiponectin. Fat mass index (FMI) and lean mass index (LMI) were measured by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry. MetS was defined by the updated National Cholesterol Education Program Adult Treatment Panel III criteria for Asian-Americans.Circulating IL-18 was positively correlated with LMI after adjustment for FMI (correlation coefficient = 0.11, P<0.001). The association with the MetS (odds ratio 3.43, 95% confidence interval 2.01-5.85) was substantially higher in the highest than the lowest quartile of IL-18 after multiple adjustments including body mass index. In the stratified multivariable regression analyses, the positive association between IL-18 and MetS was independent of tertiles of FMI, inflammatory markers and HMW-adiponectin, but significantly interacted with tertile of LMI (P for interaction = 0.010).Elevated plasma IL-18 was associated with higher MetS prevalence in apparently healthy Chinese, independent of traditional risk factors, FMI, inflammatory markers and HMW-adiponectin. More studies are needed to clarify the role of lean mass in IL-18 secretion and its associated cardio-metabolic disorders."
https://openalex.org/W2111813757,"In the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) project, gene expression of the same set of samples is measured multiple times on different microarray platforms. There are two main advantages to combining these measurements. First, we have the opportunity to obtain a more precise and accurate estimate of expression levels than using the individual platforms alone. Second, the combined measure simplifies downstream analysis by eliminating the need to work with three sets of expression measures and to consolidate results from the three platforms. We propose to use factor analysis (FA) to obtain a unified gene expression measure (UE) from multiple platforms. The UE is a weighted average of the three platforms, and is shown to perform well in terms of accuracy and precision. In addition, the FA model produces parameter estimates that allow the assessment of the model fit. The R code is provided in File S2. Gene-level FA measurements for the TCGA data sets are available from http://tcga-data.nci.nih.gov/docs/publications/unified_expression/."
https://openalex.org/W1994071786,"The neuropeptide S (NPS) receptor system modulates neuronal circuit activity in the amygdala in conjunction with fear, anxiety and the expression and extinction of previously acquired fear memories. Using in vitro brain slice preparations of transgenic GAD67-GFP (Δneo) mice, we investigated the effects of NPS on neural activity in the lateral amygdala as a key region for the formation and extinction of fear memories. We are able to demonstrate that NPS augments excitatory glutamatergic synaptic input onto both projection neurons and interneurons of the lateral amygdala, resulting in enhanced spike activity of both types of cells. These effects were at least in part mediated by presynaptic mechanisms. In turn, inhibition of projection neurons by local interneurons was augmented by NPS, and subthreshold oscillations were strengthened, leading to their shift into the theta frequency range. These data suggest that the multifaceted effects of NPS on amygdaloid circuitry may shape behavior-related network activity patterns in the amygdala and reflect the peptide's potent activity in various forms of affective behavior and emotional memory."
https://openalex.org/W2094052994,"Conflicting prevalence of newly identified KI(KIPyV), WU(WUPyV) and Merkel Cell Carcinoma(MCPyV) polyomaviruses have been reported in progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy(PML) patient samples, ranging from 0 to 14.3%. We analyzed the prevalence of these polyomaviruses in cerebrospinal fluid(CSF), peripheral blood mononuclear cells(PBMC), and bone marrow samples from PML patients, immunosuppressed individuals with or without HIV, and multiple sclerosis(MS) patients. Distinct PCR tests for KIPyV, WUPyV and MCPyV DNA performed in two independent laboratories detected low levels of MCPyV DNA only in 1/269 samples. The infrequent detections of these viruses in multiple samples from immunosuppressed individuals including those with PML suggest that their reactivation mechanisms may be different from that of JC polyomavirus (JCPyV) and that they do not play a role in the pathogenesis of PML."
https://openalex.org/W1992243226,"The antigenic structure of the membrane protein hemagglutinin (HA) from the 2009 A(H1N1) influenza virus was dissected with a high-throughput screening method using complex antisera. The approach involves generating yeast cell libraries displaying a pool of random peptides of controllable lengths on the cell surface, followed by one round of fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) against antisera from mouse, goat and human, respectively. The amino acid residue frequency appearing in the antigenic peptides at both the primary sequence and structural level was determined and used to identify “hot spots” or antigenically important regions. Unexpectedly, different antigenic structures were seen for different antisera. Moreover, five antigenic regions were identified, of which all but one are located in the conserved HA stem region that is responsible for membrane fusion. Our findings are corroborated by several recent studies on cross-neutralizing H1 subtype antibodies that recognize the HA stem region. The antigenic peptides identified may provide clues for creating peptide vaccines with better accessibility to memory B cells and better induction of cross-neutralizing antibodies than the whole HA protein. The scheme used in this study enables a direct mapping of the antigenic regions of viral proteins recognized by antisera, and may be useful for dissecting the antigenic structures of other viral proteins."
