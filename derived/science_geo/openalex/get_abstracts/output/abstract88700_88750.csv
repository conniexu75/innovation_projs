https://openalex.org/W2062376760,"Mutations in the Caenorhabditis elegans genes lin-14, lin-28, and lin-29 cause heterochronic developmental defects: the timing of specific developmental events in several tissues is altered relative to the timing of events in other tissues. These defects result from temporal transformations in the fates of specific cells, that is, certain cells express fates normally expressed by cells generated at other developmental stages. The identification and characterization of genes that can be mutated to cause heterochrony support the proposal that heterochrony is a mechanism for phylogenetic change and suggest cellular and genetic bases for heterochronic variation."
https://openalex.org/W2106141363,"Transport of the VSV-encoded glycoprotein (G protein) between successive compartments of the Golgi has been reconstituted in a cell-free system and is measured, in a rapid and sensitive new assay, by the coupled incorporation of 3H-N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc). This glycosylation occurs when G protein is transported during mixed incubations from the ""donor"" compartment in Golgi from VSV-infected CHO clone 15B cells (missing a key Golgi GlcNAc transferase) to the next, successive ""acceptor"" compartment (containing the GlcNAc transferase) in Golgi from wild-type CHO cells. Golgi fractions used in this assay have been extensively purified, and account for all of the donor and acceptor activity in the cells. Together with several other lines of evidence, this indicates that the cell-free system is highly specific, measuring only transport between sequential compartments in the Golgi stack. Transport in vitro is almost as efficient as in the cell, and requires ATP and the cytosol fraction in addition to protein components on the cytoplasmic surface of the Golgi membranes."
https://openalex.org/W1999304520,"The possibility that calcium is elevated in brain neurons during aging was examined by quantifying afterhyperpolarizations induced by spike bursts in CAl neurons of hippocampal slices from young and aged rats. The afterhyperpolarizations result from Ca2+-dependent K+ conductance increases and are blocked in medium low in Ca2+ and prolonged in medium high in Ca2+. The afterhyperpolarization and associated conductance increases were considerably prolonged in cells from aged rats, although inhibitory postsynaptic potentials did not differ with age. Since elevated intracellular Ca2+ can exert deleterious effects on neurons, the data suggest that altered Ca2+ homeostasis may play a significant role in normal brain aging."

https://openalex.org/W2161622051,"Golgi vesicle membranes from the Lec2 CHO glycosylation mutant translocate CMP-sialic acid at only 2% the rate of vesicles from wild-type CHO cells. The deficiency is specific, because vesicles from Lec2 cells can translocate UDP-N-acetylglucosamine, adenosine 3'-phosphate 5'-phosphosulfate, and UDP-galactose at rates comparable to those of vesicles from wild-type cells. Complementation analyses show that Lec2 mutants belong to the same genetic complementation group as clone 1021, a CHO mutant of similar phenotype. Both mutants have previously been shown to have a 90% reduction in the sialylation of glycoproteins and gangliosides compared with wild-type cells. However, 1021 cells appear to have normal levels of CMP-sialic acid, sialyltransferase activity, and endogenous acceptors for sialylation. It seems likely that the primary defect in Lec2 and 1021 cells is their inability to translocate CMP-sialic acid across Golgi vesicle membranes."
https://openalex.org/W2015128905,"The influence of c-myc expression on fibroblast growth and morphology was investigated by transfection of c-myc genes linked to viral promoters. No foci were observed after transfection of either NIH/3T3 or Rat 2 cells. Cell lines containing activated c-myc genes were established using SV2-neo coselection and several growth parameters of the cells were studied. The cells showed a slight increase in refractility and formed colonies in soft agar with an efficiency of only 1%-2%. The c-myc-transfected cells grew well in 0.5% serum while the controls did not. The major difference in cell growth noted was that c-myc-transfected cells were tumorigenic when inoculated into nude mice or syngeneic rats. Analysis of RNA from the tumorigenic cells showed a level of c-myc expression from the transfected genes that was 2 to 6 fold higher than that from the endogenous gene. The level of c-myc RNA in the fibroblast tumors was similar to that found in mouse plasmacytomas. Expression of the endogenous c-myc gene was unaffected by the transfected genes for subconfluent cells in culture, but the gene was shut off in the nude mouse tumors. These results demonstrate that constitutive c-myc expression leads to tumorigenicity in immortalized cell lines."
https://openalex.org/W2078565719,Sequence-dependent variations in DNA revealed by x-ray crystallographic studies have suggested that certain DNA-reactive drugs may react preferentially with defined sequences in DNA. Drugs that wind around the helix and reside within one of the grooves of DNA have perhaps the greatest chance of recognizing sequence-dependent features of DNA. The antitumor antibiotic CC-1065 covalently binds through N-3 of adenine and resides within the minor groove of DNA. This drug overlaps with five base pairs for which a high sequence specificity exists.
https://openalex.org/W1588608813,"Mild acid hydrolysis of a small (Mr = 6 kDa) pectic polysaccharide isolated from tomato leaves, an inducer of the synthesis and accumulation of two proteinase inhibitors in excised tomato plants, yielded a alpha-D-polygalacturonic acid polymer with degree of polymerization = 20 that retained proteinase inhibitor-inducing activity. Enzymic and acid hydrolysis of this polygalacturonan yielded a series of alpha-1,4-D-galacturonic acid oligomers with degrees of polymerization from 2 to 6 which were purified to homogeneity and assayed for proteinase inhibitor-inducing activity in young excised tomato plants. All of the oligomers exhibited activity. The hexagalacturonide possessed the highest activity and the trimer the lowest. The evidence supports a possible role for plant cell wall fragments as systemic messengers that regulate the expression of proteinase inhibitor genes in plant leaves in response to pest attacks."
https://openalex.org/W2008240385,"In somatic cells the level of myc transcription is not restricted to particular cell types but correlates closely with the rate of cell division. Such transcription involves the use of two active myc promoters and produces two messenger RNA species that are differentially represented among the transcripts of different tissues. In apparent contrast to somatic cells, mitotically and meiotically dividing germ cells have very few myc transcripts and appear to proliferate, at least for a few divisions, in the absence of myc transcription. These results raise interesting questions regarding the role of the myc gene product in terminally differentiating cells, particularly of the germ line series."
https://openalex.org/W2055713721,"Evidence was presented earlier that a host-cell receptor for the highly neurotropic rabies virus might be the acetylcholine receptor. The amino acid sequence of the glycoprotein of rabies virus was compared by computer analysis with that of snake venom curaremimetic neurotoxins, potent ligands of the acetylcholine receptor. A statistically significant sequence relation was found between a segment of the rabies glycoprotein and the entire sequence of long neurotoxins. The greatest identity occurs with residues considered most important in neurotoxicity, including those interacting with the acetylcholine binding site of the acetylcholine receptor. Because of the similarity between the glycoprotein and the receptor-binding region of the neurotoxins, this region of the viral glycoprotein may function as a recognition site for the acetylcholine receptor. Direct binding of the rabies virus glycoprotein to the acetylcholine receptor could contribute to the neurotropism of this virus."
https://openalex.org/W2063117554,"The gene for the mitochondrial enzyme ornithine transcarbamylase was mapped to the short arm of the X chromosome by in situ hybridization experiments, with DNA complementary to the human ornithine transcarbamylase gene used as a probe. A series of cell lines with X chromosome abnormalities was used to localize the gene to band Xp21.1. Because the gene maps near the Duchenne muscular dystrophy locus, the ornithine transcarbamylase probe may be useful in carrier detection and prenatal diagnosis of Duchenne muscular dystrophy as well as of ornithine transcarbamylase deficiency."
https://openalex.org/W1965064476,"It has been suggested that reserpine blocks expression of delayed hypersensitivity in mice because it depletes stores of the vasoactive amine serotonin in mast cells. To determine whether mast cell serotonin or other mast cell-derived mediators are essential for delayed hypersensitivity, responses to contact sensitizers in mast cell-deficient W/Wv or Sl/Sld mice were studied. Because blood platelets represent another potential source of serotonin in delayed hypersensitivity responses, beige mice, whose platelets contain less than 1 percent of the normal levels of serotonin, were also examined. By the criteria of tissue swelling, infiltration of iodinated leukocytes, or histology, mast cell-deficient or beige mice expressed delayed hypersensitivity reactions whose intensity generally equaled or exceeded that of reactions in littermate controls. In addition, reserpine blocked delayed hypersensitivity in W/Wv and beige mice, suggesting that effects on mast cell or platelet serotonin cannot explain this drug's action in delayed hypersensitivity."
https://openalex.org/W1559267262,"The ovoperoxidase from the egg of the sea urchin, Strongylocentrotus purpuratus, has been purified to apparent homogeneity. Ovoperoxidase is secreted from the egg at fertilization and is responsible, in vivo, for hardening of the fertilization membrane by forming cross-links between protein tyrosyl residues. Purification was accomplished by activation of cortical granule exocytosis with acetic acid, followed by NH4SO4 precipitation, DEAE-Sephacel chromatography in the absence of divalent cations, and CM-Sephadex chromatography. The purified enzyme is a glycoprotein of Mr 70,000, based on sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The enzyme exhibits a UV-visible spectrum typical of heme peroxidases (epsilon 412 = 1.19 X 10(5) M-1 cm-1). Ovoperoxidase catalyzes the oxidation of tyrosine, guaiacol, iodide, and bromide, but not chloride, and can employ either H2O2 or, with 8% relative efficiency, ethyl peroxide as an oxidative substrate. Phenylhydrazine, 3-amino-1,2,4-triazole, azide, and sulfite all inhibit purified ovoperoxidase at concentrations similar to those that inhibit hardening in vivo. Inhibition by 3-amino-1,2,4-triazole is reversible, requires H2O2, and is slow relative to substrate turnover. The purified enzyme is sensitive to protease cleavage in the native state, yielding an active product of Mr approximately 50,000 which varies slightly depending upon the protease employed. Ovoperoxidase should provide a useful tool for the study of fertilization membrane formation as a paradigm of macromolecular assembly and modification."
https://openalex.org/W2099674663,"The effect of interferon (IFN) treatment and virus infection on the phosphorylation both in vitro and in vivo of the alpha subunit of protein synthesis initiation factor eIF-2 (eIF-2 alpha) was examined in mouse fibroblast L929 cells. The [gamma-32P]ATP-mediated in vitro phosphorylation of eIF-2 alpha catalyzed by cell-free extracts prepared from IFN-treated, uninfected cells was dependent upon exogenously added double-stranded RNA (dsRNA). However, the dsRNA requirement for eIF-2 alpha phosphorylation in vitro was eliminated by prior infection of cells with reovirus Dearing strain virions but not with defective top component particles. The enhanced phosphorylation in vitro of eIF-2 alpha and ribosome-associated protein P1 depended in a similar manner upon the multiplicity of virus infection. The extent of phosphorylation in vivo of eIF-2 alpha prepared from L929 cells was also examined by utilizing two-dimensional isoelectric focusing/sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and immunoblotting techniques. About 5-10% of the eIF-2 alpha was typically phosphorylated in vivo in untreated, mock-infected cells, whereas 25-30% was phosphorylated in IFN-treated, reovirus-infected cells. An intermediate extent of eIF-2 alpha phosphorylation, routinely between 15 and 20%, was observed with either IFN treatment or reovirus infection alone. The integrity of eIF-4A and eIF-4B was also examined by two-dimensional electrophoresis and immunoblotting, and no significant alterations in molecular size or charge heterogeneity were detected when these factors were prepared from IFN-treated, reovirus-infected cells as compared to untreated, uninfected cells."
https://openalex.org/W1482217684,"A beta 1-6N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase has been identified in microsomal preparations from hog gastric mucosa which is able to synthesize branch points in branched lactosaminoglycans (blood group I antigenic structures). The enzyme can be assayed specifically using the synthetic trisaccharide GlcNAc beta 1-3Gal beta 1-4Glc beta-OMe as acceptor. The product of the transferase reaction was isolated and identified by methylation analysis as, (Formula: see text) Into this tetrasaccharide two galactose residues were incorporated by the specific beta-N-acetylglucosaminide beta 1-4-galactosyltransferase from bovine milk. Thus a hexasaccharide was formed which was shown to inhibit strongly a murine monoclonal and a human anti-I antibody. Using a variety of oligosaccharides and glycolipids, which correspond to structures found in linear lactosaminoglycan chains, the acceptor substrate specificity of the branching enzyme was determined. From these results it is concluded that branching occurs only during the elongation process at the nonreducing end and follows a well-defined order. N-Acetylglucosamine is first transferred to position 3 of a terminal galactose followed immediately by the addition of a second N-acetylglucosamine to position 6; only then the 1-3 and the 1-6 branches are further elongated by galactose residues."
https://openalex.org/W1607457006,"Lysosomal enzymes isolated from the slime mold Dictyostelium discoideum bind to the mannose 6-phosphate receptor which is present in many mammalian cells. While binding to the receptor suggests that the slime mold enzymes possess the same mannose 6-phosphate recognition marker as their mammalian counterparts, initial structural studies of the phosphorylated oligosaccharides have indicated that the phosphate is attached to high mannose-type units via an unusual phosphodiester linkage (Freeze, H.H., Yeh, R., Miller, A.L., and Kornfeld, S. (1983) J. Biol. Chem. 258, 14874-14879). To identify the components of the phosphodiester group we have isolated the phosphorylated high-mannose oligosaccharides from D. discoideum AX3 cells labeled with [2-3H]mannose or [6-3H]glucosamine and from the differentiation medium of unlabeled cells. The major phosphorylated species contain one or two phosphodiester groups and an average of 6 or 7 mannose residues. The phosphodiesters are relatively stable to both acid and base hydrolysis, but upon strong acid hydrolysis (conditions that completely hydrolyze the oligosaccharide) mannose 6-phosphate residues are liberated. Through a combination of techniques, including fast atom bombardment and direct chemical ionization mass spectrometry, it is shown that the mannose 6-phosphate residues of the intact oligosaccharide are diesterified to methyl groups. This indicates that slime mold possesses a different biosynthetic pathway for the formation of phosphorylated high mannose-type oligosaccharides than is utilized by higher organisms."

In midsummer it is 22 or more, similar to that of other mammals. However, in late summer and early fall, while food is available, the urea-to-creatinine ratio approaches or becomes 10 or less. The low value of this ratio appears to indicate the biochemical state of hibernation, and many bears are in this state weeks before they den."

https://openalex.org/W2054662911,"Recent findings suggest that membrane vesicle transport during mitosis may be generally inhibited. To test this, we examined the kinetics of uptake and exocytosis of RITC-transferrin in mitotic and interphase HeLa cells. We used quantitative image-intensification fluorescence microscopy to analyze the content of ligands in single cells. This technique was validated by comparison of 3H or RITC-transferrin release from interphase cells determined by microscopy or radiometry. Both methods gave a t1/2 of release of 5-6 min. The uptake of RITC-transferrin was depressed in mitotics. More importantly, we monitored the exocytosis of label during mitosis. Labeled mitotics were obtained by the progression of interphase cells into mitosis during a 50 min incubation with RITC-transferrin. After 30 min chase with unlabeled transferrin, the intensities of interphase cells approached background, whereas those of mitotic cells remained nearly constant. Thus both exocytosis and endocytosis of transferrin were exocytosis and endocytosis of transferrin were blocked during mitosis."
https://openalex.org/W1586267771,"We report analyses of fibronectin subunit diversity by high resolution one- and two-dimensional gel electrophoresis. We have studied plasma and cellular fibronectins of rats and hamsters. Each form of fibronectin comprises multiple distinguishable subunits and, within each rodent species, all subunits of plasma fibronectin are resolvable from those of cellular fibronectin. Some, but not all, of this heterogeneity is caused by differential glycosylation. Thus, while glycosylated plasma and cellular fibronectins share no common subunits, nonglycosylated forms of these proteins appear to share 2-3 subunits. In addition, there are subunits unique to plasma and to cellular fibronectins in both rats and hamsters, although the pattern of diversity differs slightly between species. All size variants of fibronectin are phosphorylated to varying degrees. However, only some subunits are sulfated, apparently on tyrosine residues in the C-terminal third of the molecule. Comparison of the distribution of sulfate on the various fibronectin subunits with recent results on generation of multiple mRNAs by alternative splicing suggests that tyrosine sulfate is located in a polypeptide segment present in only certain fibronectin subunits. The results reported here provide information on the likely contributions of primary sequence differences and post-translational modifications to the heterogeneity of fibronectin subunits."
https://openalex.org/W1580408754,"Rapid replacement of 0.15 M K gluconate with 0.15 M choline Cl led to multiphasic Ca2+ release from a heavy fraction of rabbit skeletal muscle microsomes. Following the initial lag period (0-50 ms), about 15 nmol of Ca2+/mg of protein was rapidly released with first-order rate constants k = 60-140 s-1. Subsequently, a larger amount of Ca2+ (up to 56 nmol/mg) was released at a slower rate (k = 0.8-1.5 s-1). The Ca2+ released in both rapid and slow phases was reaccumulated within 60 s. In agreement with a previous report (Caswell, A. H., Lau, Y. H., Garcia, M., and Brunschwig, J-P. (1979) J. Biol. Chem. 254, 202-208), French press treatment of the tubule/sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) complex results in dissociation of transverse tubular membrane (T-tubules) from SR. Subsequent incubation with 0.4 M potassium cacodylate results in the reassociation of the complex, as shown by sucrose density-gradient sedimentation. Upon T-tubule dissociation, both rapid and slow Ca2+ release was inhibited. Upon reassociation, the rapid Ca2+ release was completely restored and the slow phase partially restored. The results indicate that the T-tubule associated with SR plays a crucial role in triggering rapid Ca2+ release induced by ionic replacement. Other types of Ca2+ release, e.g. those induced by Ca2+ alone or with drugs such as caffeine and quercetin, are unaffected by T-tubule dissociation, and hence produced by direct stimulation of the SR membrane."
https://openalex.org/W1490802565,"The influence of lipid composition and physical state on the rate of cholesteryl ester clearance from cytoplasmic inclusions has been investigated. Our findings demonstrate that the increased rate of clearance correlates with an increased cellular triglyceride content and a more fluid cholesteryl ester physical state. Cultured rat hepatoma cells were induced to accumulate esterified cholesterol in a smectic liquid-crystalline state by exposure to free cholesterol-rich phospholipid dispersions. Addition of cis-unsaturated fatty acids to this loading medium (either oleate, linoleate, linolenate, or eicosadienoate) resulted in a substantial increase in cellular triglyceride content (greater than 7 times non-fatty acid-treated), cellular cholesteryl esters in a liquid state, and a rate of cholesteryl ester clearance twice that of control (approximately 34% versus 17% in 12 h). In studies with oleic acid, storage of cellular cholesteryl esters in a liquid state was found to be dependent on the presence of triglycerides, and the rate at which these cells hydrolyzed cholesteryl esters was proportional to triglyceride levels. Cells exposed to either linoleic or linolenic acid hydrolyzed cholesteryl esters at the faster rate, but in contrast to findings with oleate and eicosadienoate, the storage of cholesteryl esters in a liquid state may also be a consequence of the modified fatty acyl composition of the cholesteryl esters themselves. Addition of a saturated fatty acid (palmitate) or a fatty acid with a trans-double bond (elaidate) to the cholesterol loading media had little effect on cellular triglyceride content, cholesteryl ester physical state, or the rate of cholesteryl ester clearance."
https://openalex.org/W2020453504,"Multicellular spheroids were grown from mixtures of rat brain tumor cells sensitive (9L) and resistant (R3) to 1,3-bis(2-chloroethyl)-1-nitrosourea. Percentages of each cell subpopulation in these spheroids were estimated with the sister chromatid exchange assay and were found to be approximately the same as those used to initiate spheroids. Spheroids grown from 9L cells alone had a higher growth rate than spheroids grown from R3 cells alone. However, the growth rate of mixed-cell spheroids was essentially the same as that of pure 9L spheroids and was independent of the percentages of R3 cells in mixed-cell spheroids. The sensitivity of 9L cells in mixed-cell spheroids treated with 1,3-bis(2-chloroethyl)-1-nitrosourea, estimated by changes in the number of sister chromatid exchanges per metaphase induced by treatment, decreased as the percentage of R3 cells increased. These effects are probably the result of an interaction between the two cell subpopulations held in three-dimensional contact, a situation similar to that in tumors in situ. The results suggest why one cell subpopulation of tumors does not become dominant during growth and indicate that interactions between cell subpopulations can influence the sensitivity of one subpopulation to 1,3-bis(2-chloroethyl)-1-nitrosourea."
https://openalex.org/W1532887128,"Secretory granules of the rat parotid have been purified rapidly by differential centrifugation in iso-osmotic sucrose. Despite low-level contamination by other organelles, this fraction is predominantly secretory granules, based on biochemical and morphological characterization. Measurements of intragranular water space show that isolated granules swell in hypo-osmotic media, and begin to release alpha-amylase and other content proteins below 250 mosM. Exposure of granules to selected anions also causes lysis, increasing in the order sulfate less than phosphate less than or equal to gluconate less than or equal to isethionate less than or equal to acetate less than or equal to chloride much less than thiocyanate. The internal pH of isolated parotid granules is approximately 6.8 as measured by the distributions of either [3H]acetate or [14C]methylamine. Varying the external medium pH from 5.0 to 8.0 results in little change in the measured internal pH. Parotid granules have a substantial internal buffering capacity, i.e. a decrease of 85-140 mM intragranular H+ is needed to raise the internal pH by 1.0 unit. Finally, results obtained using acridine orange staining suggest that the secretory granule internal pH in situ is similar to that measured in isolated granules."

https://openalex.org/W1496108457,"The relationship between the plasma membrane potential and activation of sperm motility and respiration, or induction of the acrosome reaction, was explored in sperm of the sea urchin Strongylocentrotus purpuratus. Plasma and mitochondrial membrane potentials were estimated by measuring the uptake of [14C]thiocyanate ( [14C]SCN-) and [3H]tetraphenylphosphonium ( [3H]TPP+) in intact sperm and sperm made permeant with digitonin. Mitochondrial potentials up to-185 mV were found, consistent with data for TPP+ uptake into mitochondria from other cell types. Values for TPP+ uptake corrected for mitochondrial accumulation and estimates of SCN- uptake both indicated that the plasma membrane potential was about -30 mV for actively respiring sperm in seawater and about -60 mV for quiescent sperm in Na+-free seawater. Activation of sperm motility and respiration induced by Na+ increased the intracellular pH and caused a depolarization of both the plasma membrane and mitochondrial potentials. However, membrane potential depolarization did not occur when the activation was induced by increased extracellular pH or by the peptide speract, although activation was always linked to increased intracellular pH. The acrosome reaction, on the other hand, was always associated with sperm plasma membrane potential depolarization, whether it was induced by the physiological effector from the egg surface or by several artificial triggering regimens. Thus, activation of respiration and motility is primarily controlled by increased intracellular pH (Christen, R., Schackmann, R. W., and Shapiro, B. M. (1982) J. Biol. Chem. 257, 14881-14890), whereas the acrosome reaction also requires depolarization of the plasma membrane potential."
https://openalex.org/W1605241954,"Infusion of heat-aggregated immunoglobulin G (IgG) into perfused livers from fed rats resulted in a dose-dependent but transient stimulation of hepatic glucose output. Oxygen consumption and lactate production by the liver also were stimulated, while the lactate/pyruvate ratio of the effluent perfusate was increased. Upon return of hepatic glucose output to the basal rate following immune aggregate stimulation, a second infusion of immune aggregate caused little or no increase in glucose output, indicating desensitization of the response. Infusion of immune aggregate into rat livers also resulted in the appearance of platelet-activating factor activity in the effluent perfusate. Synthetic platelet-activating factor or acetylglyceryl ether phosphorylcholine (AGEPC) has been demonstrated to be a potent glycogenolytic agonist in the perfused liver (Buxton, D.B., Shukla, S. D., Hanahan, D. J., and Olson, M.S. (1984) J. Biol. Chem. 259, 1468-1471). The glycogenolytic response of the liver to immune aggregate infusion was not desensitized by prior infusion of AGEPC. Co-infusion of the cyclooxygenase inhibitor indomethacin prevented the immune aggregate-induced glycogenolytic response but had no effect on AGEPC-stimulated hepatic glucose output. It is suggested that the mechanism by which aggregated IgG activates hepatic glycogenolysis requires the synthesis of AGEPC by the liver by a pathway which involves the metabolism of arachadonic acid."
https://openalex.org/W1579207811,"High-field 13C surface coil nuclear magnetic resonance has been employed to investigate glucose and glycogen metabolism in rat liver in vivo. Natural abundance and isotopically enriched proton-decoupled 13C NMR experiments were conducted at 90.56 MHz on a standard commercial spectrometer utilizing a laboratory-built high-sensitivity double-resonance coaxial coil probe. At variance with a previous preliminary report, natural abundance spectra of the liver in vivo from a rat fed ad libitum reveal resonances of substantial intensity from hepatic glycogen with approximately 10 min of signal averaging. The response of hepatic glycogen levels to an intravenous injection of the hormone glucagon was continuously monitored through the glycogen C-1 carbon resonance intensity; this revealed an average 60% depletion of hepatic glycogen stores in vivo within approximately 1 h. In a complementary study utilizing fasted rats, 100 mg of D-[1-13C]glucose (90% enriched) was administered via a peripheral vein injection and continuously monitored by 13C NMR with 3-min time resolution as it was incorporated into hepatic glycogen. The C-1 carbon resonances of hepatic glucose and glycogen are well-resolved in vivo enabling the time course for the relative change in concentration for both metabolites to be established simultaneously. The 13C label incorporated into the glycogen pool reaches a steady-state level in approximately 40 min."

The antral gastrin synthesis was stimulated by fundectomy, which ablates gastric acid secretion and thereby increases the gastrin concentration in plasma 20-fold. Tyrosine O-sulfation of gastrin was also demonstrated by incorporation of [35S]sulfate. Sulfate-labeled peptides precipitated by gastrin antisera coeluted with sulfated gastrin immunoreactivity on ion-exchange chromatography. Aryl-sulfatase treatment removed the [35S]sulfate from labeled gastrin and resulted in a change in elution pattern of the immunoreactivity to that of the unsulfated gastrins. The presence of 35S-labeled tyrosine O-sulfate residues was directly demonstrated by two-dimensional thin-layer electrophoresis after alkaline hydrolysis of [35S]sulfate-labeled gastrin. All the antral gastrins incorporated [35S]sulfate."
https://openalex.org/W1579331744,"The kinetics of purified beef heart mitochondrial carnitine palmitoyltransferase have been extensively investigated with a semiautomated system and the computer program TANKIN and shown to be sigmoidal with both acyl-CoA and L-carnitine. In contrast, Michaelis-Menten kinetics were found with carnitine octanoyltransferase. The catalytic activity of carnitine palmitoyltransferase is strongly pH dependent. The K0.5 and Vmax are both greater at lower pH. The K0.5 for palmitoyl-CoA is 1.9 and 24.2 microM at pH 8 and 6, respectively. The K0.5 for L-carnitine is 0.2 and 2.9 mM at pH 8 and 6, respectively. Malonyl-CoA (20-600 microM) had no effect on the kinetic parameters for palmitoyl-CoA at both saturating and subsaturating levels of L-carnitine. We conclude that malonyl-CoA is not a competitive inhibitor of carnitine palmitoyltransferase. The purified enzyme contained 18.9 mol of bound phospholipid/mol of enzyme which were identified as cardiolipin, phosphatidylethanolamine, and phosphatidylcholine by thin-layer chromatography. The data are consistent with the conclusion that native carnitine palmitoyltransferase exhibits different catalytic properties on either side of the inner membrane of mitochondria due to its non-Michaelis-Menten kinetic behavior, which can be affected by pH differences and differences in membrane environment."
https://openalex.org/W1512598370,"The cytoplasmic domain of erythrocyte membrane band 3 (cdb3) serves as a center of membrane organization, interacting with such proteins as ankyrin, protein 4.1, protein 4.2, hemoglobin, several glycolytic enzymes, and a tyrosine kinase, p72syk. cdb3 exists in a reversible, pH-dependent conformational equilibrium characterized by large changes in Stokes radius (11 Å) and intrinsic fluorescence (2-fold). Based on the crystallographic structure of the cdb3 dimer, we hypothesized that the above conformational equilibrium might involve the movement of flanking peripheral protein binding domains away from a shared dimerization domain. To test this hypothesis, we have mutated both donor (W105L) and acceptor (D316A) residues of a prominent H bond that bridges the above two domains and have examined the effect on the resulting conformational equilibrium. Analysis of the intrinsic fluorescence, Stokes radius, thermal stability, urea stability, and segmental mobility of these mutants reveals that the above H bond is indeed present in the low pH conformation of cdb3 and broken in a higher pH conformation. The data further reveal that cdb3 exists in three native pH-dependent conformations and that rupture of the aforementioned H bond occurs only during conversion of the low pH conformation to the mid-pH conformation. Conversion of the mid-pH conformation to the high pH conformation would now appear to involve structural changes primarily in the peripheral protein binding domain. Because ankyrin associates avidly with the low pH conformation of cdb3, ankyrin occupancy should strongly influence this structural equilibrium and thereby affect band 3 and perhaps global membrane properties.

The data further reveal that cdb3 exists in three native pH-dependent conformations and that rupture of the aforementioned H bond occurs only during conversion of the low pH conformation to the mid-pH conformation. Conversion of the mid-pH conformation to the high pH conformation would now appear to involve structural changes primarily in the peripheral protein binding domain. Because ankyrin associates avidly with the low pH conformation of cdb3, ankyrin occupancy should strongly influence this structural equilibrium and thereby affect band 3 and perhaps global membrane properties. cytoplasmic domain of erythrocyte membrane 3 fast protein liquid chromatography Band 3 is the most abundant polypeptide of the human erythrocyte membrane, comprising ∼25% of the total membrane protein (1Fairbanks G.

Band 3 is composed of two major domains, a transmembrane domain and a cytoplasmic domain, which perform distinct and essential cellular functions (3Appell K.C. Low P.S.

A remarkable property of the cytoplasmic domain of band 3 (cdb3)1 involves its ability to undergo a large, fully reversible, pH-dependent conformational change (23Thevenin B.J. Periasamy N.

Thus, as pH is raised from 6.0 to 10.0, the Stokes radius of cdb3 enlarges by 11 Å, and the intrinsic fluorescence, which is highly quenched at a lower pH, more than doubles. Thermal stability decreases by ∼15 °C over this pH range, whereas both protein segmental motion and protein axial ratio increase significantly. Based on careful measurements of these and other parameters, it has been concluded that cdb3 probably exists in three native conformational states defined by structural transitions at pH values 7.2 and 9.2. Because these structural transitions control ankyrin association with band 3 and thereby membrane stability (19Low P.S. Willardson B.M. Mohandas N. Rossi M. Shohet S.

Acta, in press. characterization of the conformational change could provide considerable insight into the structure and operation of the erythrocyte membrane. The crystallographic structure of the low pH conformation of human erythrocyte cdb3 has recently been solved to 0.26-nm resolution (31Zhang D. Kiyatkin A. Bolin J.T. Low P.S. Blood. 2000; 96: 2925-2933Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). cdb3 is crystallized at pH 4.8 as a tight, symmetric dimer comprised of a shared central dimerization domain flanked by two peripheral protein binding domains (Fig. 1A). Both the dimerization domain and the peripheral protein binding domains are tightly folded, but movement of one domain relative to the other appears highly possible from the crystal structure. Because the conformational change in cdb3 occurs with no significant change in protein secondary structure (24Low P.S. Westfall M.A. Allen D.P. Appell K.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 13070-13076Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), we have speculated that the responsible structural rearrangement might involve a change in interactions between the aforementioned domains (Fig.1B). For such movement to occur, however, a prominent H bond connecting Trp105 of one subunit's peripheral protein binding domain to Asp316 of the opposite subunit's sequence in the shared dimerization domain would have to be severed, thereby allowing the peripheral protein binding domains to bend away from the central dimerization domain. In this study, we have undertaken to evaluate whether the prominent structural change of cdb3 involves rupture of this Trp105–Asp316 H bond and, by extension, separation of the dimerization domain from the flanking peripheral protein binding domains. DEAE-Sepharose CL-6B was purchased from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. Isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside and antibiotics (chloramphenicol and ampicillin) were obtained from U. S. Biochemical Corp. All other reagents used were of the highest purity available. The following oligonucleotides were synthesized and used for site-directed mutagenesis: (a) for mutation of Trp105 to Leu105 (W105L), 5′CTCACCTTCTTGAGCCTCCTAG3′, and (b) for mutation of Asp316 to Ala316(D316A), 5′GGCTTCCTGGCCTGCAGCCTAG3′ (base substitution underlined). Site-directed mutagenesis was performed in vitro with a GeneEditorTMin vitrosite-directed mutagenesis system (Promega) following the manufacturer's instructions. cdb3 cDNA in a pT7-7 plasmid was used as the template. The resulting mutant cDNAs were sequenced to verify the mutations. Plasmids were then transferred into BL21(DE3) pLysS cells for expression of the mutated cdb3 proteins (32Wang C.C. Badylak J.A. Lux S.E. Moriyama R. Dixon J.E. Low P.S. Protein Sci. 1992; 1: 1206-1214Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Purification of recombinant cdb3 was performed as described previously (33Wang C.C. Moriyama R. Lombardo C.R. Low P.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 17892-17897Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 34Zhou J. Weiner H. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 12019-12024Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar) with minor modifications. Briefly, Escherichia coli BL21(DE3) pLysS cells harboring the cdb3 vector were grown at 37 °C in 2×YT medium (1.6% tryptone, 1.0% yeast extract, and 0.5% NaCl) containing both ampicillin (50 μg/ml) and chloramphenicol (50 μg/ml). When the optical density at 600 nm reached ∼0.8, isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside (final concentration, 0.5 mm) was added to the culture medium. The cultures were then grown at 37 °C for another 3 h, and the cells were harvested by centrifugation. After disruption of the cells in a French press, cell debris and genomic DNA were removed by centrifugation at 80,000 ×g for 2 h in a SW28 rotor. Before loading onto a DEAE-Sepharose CL-6B column (∼100 ml), the supernatant was diluted five times with the column buffer (10 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.5, containing 1 mm EDTA, 0.2% β-mercaptoethanol, and 100 μg/ml phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride), and proteins were eluted by FPLC with a salt gradient ranging from 0.1 to 0.6m NaCl. The fractions containing cdb3 were pooled and precipitated in 50% saturated (NH4)2SO4, and the protein pellet was dissolved in the above buffer containing 1 m(NH4)2SO4. The cdb3 solution was then applied to an HP-phenyl column (∼10 ml) equilibrated in the same 1 m (NH4)2SO4 buffer, and the protein was eluted by decreasing the concentration of (NH4)2SO4. The purity of the resulting cdb3 was verified by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The pH dependence of the Stokes radius of cdb3 was evaluated as previously reported (24Low P.S. Westfall M.A. Allen D.P. Appell K.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 13070-13076Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar,26Appell K.C. Low P.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 11104-11111Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), except that the FPLC gel filtration column used was a prepacked Superdex 200 HR 10/30 (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The pH dependence of the intrinsic fluorescence emission spectrum was measured from 300 to 410 nm in solutions of 50 mm sodium borate, 50 mm sodium phosphate, 70 mm NaCl, and 3.5 mm β-mercaptoethanol, with or without various concentrations of urea using an Aminco-Bowman luminescence spectrometer at an excitation wavelength of 290 nm and slit widths set at 6 nm. For stability studies, cdb3 (80 μg/ml) was equilibrated at the desired urea concentration for at least 3 h before fluorescence measurements were made. Differences in protein flexibility between wild type and mutant cdb3 preparations were examined in the same buffer by measuring the polarization and anisotropy of the tryptophan fluorescence of the protein at excitation and emission wavelengths of 294 and 337 nm, respectively, using slit widths adjusted to 4 nm. The temperature dependence of wild type and mutant cdb3 stability was measured on a SPEX spectrofluorimeter (Fluorolog-3, Instruments S.A., Inc.) at a final protein concentration of 40 μg/ml also in the phosphate-borate buffer. The thermostability measurements were obtained at pH values 6.0 and 10.5 by automatically collecting emission scans every 2 °C as the temperature was raised from 25 to 85 °C. Hydrodynamic analyses, energy transfer measurements, and various spectral studies demonstrate that the cdb3 dimer elongates without changing secondary structure as pH is elevated (3Appell K.C. Low P.S. Biochemistry. 1982; 21: 2151-2157Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 24Low P.S. Westfall M.A. Allen D.P. Appell K.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 13070-13076Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 26Appell K.C. Low P.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 11104-11111Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Although electron density maps are obviously static by nature, it is nevertheless possible to examine such structural data for possible sources of this conformational change by noting where movement can occur without forcing an overlap in electron density. Based on this strategy, we have located a possible hinge in cdb3 where bending of the two peripheral protein binding domains away from the shared dimerization domain can occur and can lead to protein elongation without a change in secondary structure or an imposition of steric overlap (Fig. 1). Importantly, analysis of the proposed conformational change reveals that a prominent H bond, extending from Trp105 of each subunit's peripheral protein binding domain to Asp316 of the paired subunit's dimerization domain, must be broken for the structural change to occur (31Zhang D. Kiyatkin A. Bolin J.T. Low P.S. Blood. 2000; 96: 2925-2933Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Because rupture of this H bond would also contribute to the well characterized increase in cdb3 intrinsic fluorescence upon raising pH (24Low P.S. Westfall M.A. Allen D.P. Appell K.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 13070-13076Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 35Chen Y. Barkley M.D. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 9976-9982Crossref PubMed Scopus (751) Google Scholar), we decided to test the hypothesis by mutating Trp105 and Asp316 to Leu and Ala, respectively, thereby eliminating the donor and/or the acceptor in the prominent H bond. After constructing the requisite vectors, wild type and mutated forms of cdb3 were expressed, purified to homogeneity, and characterized as described below. Evaluation of whether disruption of the aforementioned H bond might alter interdomain mobility was conducted by examining wild type and mutant proteins for differences in intrinsic fluorescence polarization at pH 6.5, where an intact H bond in wild type cdb3 would be expected to maintain a more rigid interdomain contact than is possible in the mutated cdb3. Consistent with this anticipation, the fluorescence polarization of the wild type protein was determined to be 0.16, whereas the same parameter for the D316A mutant was measured at 0.10. These data suggest that the segmental motion of one or more fluorescent residues (presumably tryptophans) in cdb3 increases upon replacement of Asp316 with a nonbonding amino acid,i.e. alanine, in cdb3. Importantly, analogous polarization studies at pH 10.5, where our model predicts interdomain interactions to already be broken, revealed identical segmental mobilities in both mutant and wild type polypeptides alike (i.e. a polarization value of 0.19 ± 0.01 is obtained for all 3 isoforms). Thus, the structural constraints that limit Trp mobility at pH 6 more in the wild type than mutant cdb3 are apparently absent at pH 10.5. The fluorescence titration of wild type cdb3 from pH 6 to 10 has been shown to cause a reversible ∼2-fold increase in the intrinsic fluorescence characterized by apparent pKa values of 7.2 and 9.2 (24Low P.S. Westfall M.A. Allen D.P. Appell K.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 13070-13076Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 26Appell K.C. Low P.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 11104-11111Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Because the pH-dependent changes in Stokes radius also exhibit inflections near pH 7.2 and 9.2 (24Low P.S. Westfall M.A. Allen D.P. Appell K.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 13070-13076Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 32Wang C.C. Badylak J.A. Lux S.E. Moriyama R. Dixon J.E. Low P.S. Protein Sci. 1992; 1: 1206-1214Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar) and because ankyrin affinity for band 3 displays the same two pH transitions (27Thevenin B.J. Low P.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 16166-16172Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), we have concluded that the fluorescence transitions reliably monitor the conformational changes in cdb3 (24Low P.S. Westfall M.A. Allen D.P. Appell K.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 13070-13076Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To learn whether removal of the Trp105–Asp316hydrogen bond might affect this conformational equilibrium, we have examined the pH dependence of the intrinsic fluorescence of the mutated cdb3s lacking the prominent H bond. As seen in Fig.2, titration of wild type cdb3 yields the expected fluorescence increase with pHmid values near 7.2 and 9.2. In contrast, titration of the W105L cdb3 mutant results in a curve showing no fluorescence change between pH 6.0 and 8.6 (Fig. 2), followed by a dramatic rise in fluorescence until pH 10. A comparison of these curves can be interpreted to suggest that mutation of Trp105 to Leu causes the loss of the lower pH structural transition. Alternatively, the conformational change might occur, but its detection could simply be prevented by deletion of the fluorescent Trp (i.e. Trp105). Regardless of the outcome (see below), the data still argue that the two inflections observed in the pH titrations of wild type cdb3 correspond to two distinct structural transitions because detection of one transition can be eliminated without significantly affecting the other. Furthermore, Trp105 must be directly involved in the lower pH structural change, because substitution with Leu eliminates its observation. To evaluate whether mutation of Trp105 to Leu prevents the low pH conformational change or simply eliminates the fluorophore responsible for its detection, two additional experiments were performed. First, titration of the intrinsic fluorescence of the H bond acceptor mutant, D316A, was examined. As displayed in Fig. 2, this mutant exhibits no evidence of a missing lower pH transition, suggesting that the absence of the transition in the W105L mutant might simply derive from a detection problem. To confirm this hypothesis, the Stokes radii of the mutants as well as wild type cdb3 were measured as a function of pH using a prepacked Superdex 200 HR 10/30 column. As mentioned above, the Stokes radius of wild type cdb3 has been reported to increase from 55 to 66 Å as pH is elevated from 6 to 10 (24). Using the above higher resolution column, we now measure an increase inRS from 51 to 62 Å over the same pH range (Fig.3). More importantly, both the W105L and D316A mutants exhibit the same dimensional changes. These results, therefore, confirm that the W105L mutation induces no loss of the pH-dependent conformational change but simply replaces the fluorescent residue that normally senses it. A third test of the involvement of the Trp105–Asp316 hydrogen bond in the prominent conformational change lies in comparing the stability of wild type and mutant cdb3 both at pH 6.0, where the H bond in the native (but not mutated) protein is intact, and at pH 10.5, where the H bond in both native and mutated proteins should be severed. For this purpose, both thermal and urea denaturation studies were performed on both wild type and mutated proteins, using intrinsic fluorescence to monitor the unfolding process. For interpretation of these data, it should be recalled that the intrinsic fluorescence of cdb3 is significantly quenched at pH 6 (see Fig. 2) and that protein denaturation leads to a fluorescence increase, whereas intrinsic fluorescence is already high at pH 10.5, and protein denaturation results in fluorescence quenching (24Low P.S. Westfall M.A. Allen D.P. Appell K.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 13070-13076Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 4A, the intrinsic fluorescence of all cdb3 isoforms equilibrated at pH 6 decreases in parallel as the temperature is raised, probably due to thermal quenching of the protein's fluorophores. However, as the temperature of heat denaturation is approached, an abrupt rise in fluorescence is observed associated with a dequenching of one or more tryptophans. Importantly this transition is centered at ∼74 °C for wild type cdb3, in agreement with previously reported calorimetric data (3Appell K.C. Low P.S. Biochemistry. 1982; 21: 2151-2157Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 26Appell K.C. Low P.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 11104-11111Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), whereas the same transition occurs at ∼70 °C for both the W105L and D316A mutants (Fig. 4A). These data demonstrate that the interdomain Trp105–Asp316 H bond in wild type cdb3 is intact and contributes to protein stability at pH 6. In contrast, at pH 10.5 the heat denaturation curves are nearly identical in wild type and mutant cdb3 (Fig. 4B). Thus, after the monotonous collisional quenching at low temperature, the sharper decline in fluorescence between 52 and 63 °C, associated with cdb3 unfolding (the calorimetric denaturation temperature is measured at 58 °C at pH 10.5 (3Appell K.C. Low P.S. Biochemistry. 1982; 21: 2151-2157Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar)) is almost superimposable for all three isoforms. These data demonstrate that the Trp105–Asp316 H bond is broken or nonfunctional at elevated pH. Pivoting of the peripheral protein binding domain away from the common dimerization domain at high pH can obviously account for this behavior. Finally, to firmly establish the absence of the Trp105–Asp316 H bond in the high pH conformation of cdb3, we have compared the concentration dependence of urea denaturation of wild type and mutant cdb3s at both pH values. Fig. 5A plots the intrinsic fluorescence of all three isoforms of cdb3 as a function of urea concentration at pH 6. As anticipated, wild type cdb3 unfolds at a significantly higher denaturant concentration than either mutant, consistent with the absence of the prominent H bond in the two mutants. In contrast, titration of the three isoforms of cdb3 at pH 10.5 reveals no major difference in stability among the polypeptides (Fig.5B). These data, therefore, confirm the absence of the Trp105–Asp316 H bond in the structure of cdb3 at high pH. We and others have shown that the reversible pH-regulated conformational change in cdb3 is characterized by an alkaline-induced increase in Stokes radius, a decline in thermal stability, a rise in intrinsic fluorescence, an increase in protein segmental mobility, an expansion in axial ratio, and a loss of ankyrin affinity, without any major change in protein secondary structure (3Appell K.C.

Badylak J.A. Lux S.E. Moriyama R. Dixon J.E. Low P.S. Protein Sci. 1992; 1: 1206-1214Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Because crystal structure analysis suggested that movement of the two peripheral protein binding domains away from the shared dimerization domain might account for these changes, we chose to evaluate this hypothesis by mutating both donor and acceptor residues of a major H bond bridging the two domains. As predicted, mutation of either H bond participant caused marked changes in cdb3 properties at pH 6 (i.e. a decrease in thermal stability, an increase in segmental mobility, a decline in urea stability) but not at elevated pH. We consider this pH dependence to support our contention that the investigated interdomain H bond is present and functional at low pH but absent in the conformation at high pH. The bending motion cartooned in Fig. 1 thus constitutes a reasonable structural transition consistent with the experimental data. Because pH changes within circulating erythrocytes are likely small, the question naturally arises regarding the physiological function of the structural rearrangements. We propose that pH is, in fact, not a physiological trigger of the conformational change. Rather because ankyrin binds most avidly to the low pH conformation of cdb3 (19Low P.S. Willardson B.M. Mohandas N. Rossi M. Shohet S. Blood. 1991; 77: 1581-1586Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 27Thevenin B.J. Low P.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 16166-16172Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), ankyrin binding will shift the structural equilibrium in situ toward the acidic H-bonded conformation. This ankyrin-induced coupling of the peripheral protein binding and dimerization domains might then allow communication between the membrane-spanning domain (which is covalently connected to the dimerization domain) and the peripheral protein binding domain (which associates with a plethora of other proteins).

Although deletion of the interdomain H bond in cdb3 causes changes in both protein stability and segmental flexibility, it does not appear to directly induce any stable change in protein structure. Thus, both the increase in Stokes radius (Fig. 3) and the rise in intrinsic fluorescence (Fig. 2) with pH remained essentially unaltered, as long as the mechanism for detecting cdb3 fluorescence was not compromised (i.e. Trp105 must be present to monitor the transition). Why then doesn't the peripheral protein binding domain spontaneously bend away from the dimerization domain upon mutation of the bridging H bond? Examination of the crystal structure reveals the presence of still other H bonds spanning between the peripheral protein binding domains and the dimerization domain. Thus, His101, Gln198, and Glu291 of each peripheral protein binding domain interacts with Ser334, Arg345, and Arg346, respectively, of the common dimerization domain. Although these H bonds will also likely be broken during the structural movements that sever the Trp105–Asp316 H bond, they appear to be sufficient even in the absence of the Trp105–Asp316 H bond to maintain the native conformation of cdb3 at low pH. Rupture of the Trp105–Asp316 H bond apparently only renders the low pH conformation less stable. Two previous hypotheses relating to band 3 structure have been bolstered by the results reported here. First, because the inflections at pH 7.2 and 9.2 in the Stokes radius and intrinsic fluorescence titration curves of cdb3 are small, the claim that they might detect two overlapping but independent conformational transitions has always been tenuous. However, the unexpected ability to cleanly segregate these two transitions by mutation of Trp105 to Leu (Fig. 2) now unambiguously documents the biphasic behavior of the structural equilibrium. Second, because cdb3 was crystallized for structural analysis at pH 4.8, there remained some uncertainty regarding the relevance of the observed protein fold to the physiological structure at low pH. The fact that the protein's thermal and urea denaturation properties, as well as the pH dependence of the protein's intrinsic fluorescence, segmental mobility, and thermal/urea stability all change in the mutants as predicted in the crystal structure argues that this structure is valid. Additional studies focused on other regions of cdb3 also support the physiological validity of the reported structure. 3J. Zhou and P. S. Low, manuscript in preparation. In summary, cdb3 can now be confirmed to exist in a reversible conformational equilibrium defined by pH-dependent transitions at pH ∼7.2 and ∼9.2. The crystallographic structure obtained on crystals grown at pH 4.8 appears to accurately represent the conformation of cdb3 below pH ∼7.2. Elevation of pH to near 8.5 triggers separation of the peripheral protein binding domains from the shared dimerization domain, with the concomitant rupture of the Trp105–Asp316 H bond. Increasing pH still further may then lead to an independent structural change in the peripheral protein binding domain involving a larger increase in Stokes radius and a structural rearrangement that is felt by tryptophans buried within the same domain (see Fig. 2). Because at least 10 peripheral proteins associate with cdb3 in vivo, definition of its conformational states and the influence of these states on peripheral protein interactions should help define erythrocyte membrane structure at this important center of membrane organization.

https://openalex.org/W1500856646,"A fatty acyltransferase activity which catalyzes the transfer of palmitic acid from palmitoyl coenzyme A to gastric mucus glycoprotein has been demonstrated in the rat gastric mucosa. Subcellular fractionation studies revealed that the enzyme activity was present in a Golgi-rich membrane fraction. Optimum enzymatic activity for acylation of mucus glycoprotein was obtained with 0.5% Triton X-100, 25 mM NaF, and 2 mM dithiothreitol at a pH of 7.4. The enzymatic activity increased proportionally, over a given range, with increased concentrations of both substrates and of enzyme. The apparent Km of the enzymes for the undegraded mucus glycoprotein was 4.5 X 10(-7) M and for palmitoyl-CoA, 3.8 X 10(-5) M. The 14C-labeled product of the reaction cochromatographed on Bio-Gel A-50 column and migrated on sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis with gastric mucus glycoprotein. Treatment of this 14C-labeled glycoprotein with mild alkali released hexane-extractable product which was identified as [14C]palmitate. The enzyme was also capable of fatty acylation of the deglycosylated glycoprotein, but did not catalyze the transfer of palmitic acid to the proteolytically degraded mucus glycoprotein. This indicates that the acceptor site for fatty acyltransferase is situated in the protease-susceptible nonglycosylated region of the mucus glycoprotein polymer."
https://openalex.org/W1507059425,"Basic proteins in nuclei and nucleosomes at different stages of development in Arbacia punctulata sea urchins were analyzed directly by in situ protamine release of chromosomal proteins into Triton/acid/urea-polyacrylamide gels. The predominant protein band in the H4 region of 2-cell through 64-cell stage embryos migrates with the mobility expected for diacetylated histone H4 (i.e. H4aa), whereas after blastulation (approximately 300 cells) the predominant H4 species is the unmodified form, H4O. In early embryos this H4aa band is highly labeled in vivo with [3H]acetic acid. The ratio of H4aa:H4O is more than 20-fold greater at the rapidly dividing 2-cell stage than at pluteus stage. This is true for both newly synthesized H4 labeled with [3H]lysine and total H4 (stained). Enhanced acetylation is also found in nucleosomes. The relative amount of this acetylated H4 species correlates roughly with the rate of cell doubling during early embryogenesis, and decreases as the average nucleosomal repeat increases. The results are indicative of a dynamically changing chromatin structure through development, as well as an intimate role of diacetylated histone H4 in the maturation of newly replicated chromatin."
https://openalex.org/W1666409248,"We have isolated stable variants of the L1210 cell exhibiting increased transport inward of the folate analog, methotrexate. These variants show 3- to 14-fold increases in [3H]methotrexate influx compared to parental cells but are unaltered for [3H]methotrexate efflux. This increased influx in each variant is quantitatively reflected in corresponding elevations in intracellular exchangeable levels of drug at steady state, but there is no alteration in membrane potential. The increases in influx are associated with increased values for influx Vmax for a system normally transporting reduced folates and the same increase in the amount of a specific binding component at the cell surface. Otherwise, values for influx Km and specificity for various folate structures are unchanged. This alteration in [3H]methotrexate influx is biochemically and genetically stable, since it is expressed in isolated plasma membrane vesicles and is retained during growth in non-selective medium. Following addition of cycloheximide, the same rate of decay of this transport activity (t 1/2 = 126 +/- 24 to 137 +/- 26 min) was shown for parental and variant cells. From these results we conclude that turnover of this transport property occurs in these cells which is genetically regulated. Also, the elevated transport activity inward for this folate analog in these variant cells is probably the result of a genetic alteration up-regulating the rate of synthesis of the putative carrier protein itself. The absence of any effect on efflux of [3H]methotrexate in these variants in the face of evidence for increased synthesis of the carrier protein for the system mediating influx of this folate analog is construed as further evidence for the nonidentity of systems mediating each flux that we proposed on the basis of earlier kinetic studies."

https://openalex.org/W1584875620,"Three forms of a thiol proteinase inhibitor were isolated from rat liver cytosol. The monomeric inhibitor (pI 5.2) (TPI-1) formed a complex with cathepsin H even in the absence of reducing agents. The inhibitor with pI 5.0 (TPI-2) was inactive in the absence of reducing agents but was converted to an active inhibitor on addition of reducing agents such as dithiothreitol, GSH, cysteine, or 2-mercaptoethanol. The dimeric inhibitor (TPI-D) with an intermolecular disulfide bridge was also inactive and was converted to the active monomeric inhibitor on addition of dithiothreitol. TPI-2 is most likely a mixed disulfide with glutathione. One (Cys-3) of two cysteine residues exposed on the surface of the molecule of TPI-2 is involved in the formation of a mixed disulfide, and the other cysteine residue (Cys-64) is buried in the molecule. The activity of rat liver thiol proteinase inhibitor may possibly be regulated by formation of a protein mixed disulfide or by reduction of the mixed disulfide."

The ADP had been freed of traces of ATP by DEAE-chromatography, and 5 microM diadenosine pentaphosphate was added to inhibit myokinase activity. The kinetics of the spontaneous polymerization of ADP-actin in 1 mM MgCl2 + 0.1 M KCl were compatible with the simple nucleation-elongation model previously used to explain the polymerization of ATP-actin. The critical concentrations of ADP-actin were 8.0 and 2.0 microM in 1 mM MgCl2 and 1 mM MgCl2 + 0.1 M KCl, respectively. These values are 20-30-fold higher than the corresponding values in ATP. Using cross-linked actin trimers to nucleate polymerization, the association rate constants were found to be 0.8 and 0.9 microM-1 S-1 in MgCl2 and MgCl2 + KCl, respectively, which are 0.4 and 0.2 times the values for ATP-actin. The dissociation rate constants, calculated from the critical concentrations and the association rate constants, were 6.4 and 1.8 S-1, respectively, which are 10 and 5 times the corresponding values for ATP-actin."

Enzyme incubated in the absence of ATP or phosphatase served as control. Three to seven times more of the autoantibodies in the patients' sera reacted with phosphorylated RNA polymerase I than with control enzyme. The reactivity of the dephosphorylated enzyme with lupus autoantibodies was only 50-60% of that observed with control enzyme. Neither phosphorylation nor dephosphorylation of the enzyme had an effect on its reaction with the rabbit antibodies. The effect of phosphorylation on the reaction of each RNA polymerase I subunit (S1-S8; Mr = 190,000-17,000) with the patients' antibodies was determined by an immunoblot procedure following resolution of the subunits on polyacrylamide gels. Prior phosphorylation of the enzyme resulted in a dramatic increase in binding of each patient's antibodies to all polymerase subunits with the exception of S4. Anti-S4 antibody was not detected with either phosphorylated or control enzyme. Strikingly, antibodies in each patients' sera reacted with S6 only after its phosphorylation. Similarly, anti-S5 antibodies in the serum of one patient were only detected with phosphorylated RNA polymerase I. The present data suggest that at least a significant fraction of the anti-RNA polymerase I autoantibodies in the sera of systemic lupus erythematosus patients might be directed against phosphorylated sites on the enzyme and that phosphorylation may have a role in the production of this and other autoimmunogenic nuclear components which are hallmarks of this disease."
https://openalex.org/W1595458298,"Control of the intraphagosomal pH in neutrophils may be of importance in creating a microbicidal environment by regulating the activity of the O2-.-generating NADPH oxidase and the lysosomal enzymes discharged into this compartment. In this study, we examined the proton stoichiometry associated with the primary enzymatic reaction underlying the respiratory burst. A preparation of the neutrophil-derived, membrane oxidase consumed NADPH and generated O2-. with a stoichiometry of 1 NADPH:2 O2-. When the enzymatically produced O2-. was prevented from undergoing dismutation, net protons were released in an approximate 1:2 stoichiometry with O2-. generated. In contrast, when O2-. was allowed to dismutate to H2O2, net protons were consumed in a 1:1 stoichiometry with the accumulated H2O2. Thus, the delta pH associated with the NADPH oxidase-dependent production of O2-. was dictated by the fate of the generated radical. The consumption of the oxidase-generated H2O2 by the lysosomal enzyme myeloperoxidase resulted in the formation of HOCl which was trapped in the presence of taurine as the N-chloro derivative. The ratio of chlorinated product formed to H+ consumed was 1:1. The implications of these results are discussed in terms of the known intraphagosomal pH changes that occur following neutrophil stimulation. We conclude that the O2-.-generating oxidase plays a dual role in the phagosome by simultaneously creating an oxidizing environment that optimizes pH-dependent microbicidal processes."
https://openalex.org/W1532473348,"18O labeling studies on the catechol 1,2-dioxygenase-catalyzed oxidative cleavage of pyrogallol demonstrate that the enzyme functions both as a dioxygenase and a monooxygenase in this reaction. Two products are observed, 2-pyrone-6-carboxylic acid, 99% singly labeled at the carboxylate, and 2-hydroxy-cis,cis-muconic acid, 74% doubly labeled (one 18O at each carboxylate) and 24% single labeled (one 18O at either carboxylate). The labeling pattern observed shows that 2-pyrone-6-carboxylic acid cannot be derived enzymatically from the lactonization of the 2-hydroxy-cis,cis-muconic acid, thus eliminating the dioxetane as an intermediate in the dioxygenase mechanism. The observations are interpreted to indicate the intermediacy of 2-hydroxymuconic anhydride. This anhydride or the corresponding muconyl enzyme species must be sufficiently long-lived to allow the exchange of labeled hydroxide with solvent. Evidence for mechanism-based enzyme inactivation by a pyrogallol-derived intermediate is also presented."

This product is incubated with CO2, Mg2+, and ribulose-bisphosphate carboxylase to form the [18O]phosphorothioate of D-glycerate. Reduction of this material using phosphoglycerate kinase/ATP, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase/NADH, triose-phosphate isomerase, and glycerol-phosphate dehydrogenase/NADH produces glycerol 3-[18O]phosphorothioate, which is subjected to ring closure using diethylphosphorochloridate. This in-line reaction produces a diastereoisomeric mixture of glycerol 2,3-cyclic phosphorothioates. 31P NMR spectroscopy was used to analyze the 18O content of the products. The anti-diastereoisomer, which is the major isomer formed and corresponds to the downfield 31P NMR signal (Pliura, D.H., Schomburg, D., Richard, J.P., Frey, P.A., and Knowles, J.R. (1980) Biochemistry 19, 325-329), retains the 18O label. This observation indicates that the ribulose-5-phosphate kinase reaction proceeds with inversion of configuration at phosphorus. The reaction is, therefore, unlikely to involve the participation of a covalent phosphoryl-enzyme intermediate."
https://openalex.org/W1531216631,"Previously, we identified a local anesthetic receptor in the membranes of nerve cells, especially enriched in axonal membranes, by the binding assay of a fluorescence local anesthetic probe, quinacrine (Greenberg, M., and Tsong, T.Y. (1982) J. Biol. Chem. 257, 8964-8971). We report here affinity chromatography purification of the quinacrine binding protein from axonal membranes of bovine brain. One per cent sodium cholate solubilized more than 90% of the membrane proteins, and the quinacrine binding activity was preserved in the extract; KD remained at 1.0 microM. An affinity column of quinacrine mustard covalently linked to Affi-Gel 10 (Bio-Rad) retained about 5% of the total solubilized proteins, and the subsequent elution with 1.0 M lidocaine revealed a protein peak which coeluted with the lidocaine peak. After removal of lidocaine, the protein peak retained the high affinity to quinacrine (KD = 1.5 microM). Furthermore, bound quinacrine could be displaced with dibucaine in the range of its nerve-blocking concentration, around 10 microM. Sodium dodecyl sulfate-gel electrophoresis of the peak protein fractions gave a predominant band of approximately 16 kDa. A major protein band with the same molecular weight was also seen in the sodium dodecyl sulfate gel of the total axonal membrane proteins. The receptor concentration in the axonal membranes was estimated to be 2-5 nmol/mg protein. With a molecular weight of 16 kDa, the receptor should constitute 3-8% of total proteins, consistent with the finding that it is a major protein constituent of the axonal membranes. The purity of the binding protein after the affinity chromatography step was about 90%. The purified protein contained roughly 60 nmol of quinacrine binding sites/mg."

A 50% active (iodoacetamide-modified)-(chloroacetyl-CoA-modified) hybrid dimer was also demonstrated by recombination of these variants with each other. These results indicate that the two functional sites on the synthetase are independently active, and that each is comprised of a cysteine SH group from one subunit and a complementary phosphopantetheine SH group from the other subunit as depicted by the head-to-tail arrangement proposed by Wakil and co-workers (Wakil, S.

https://openalex.org/W1552979601,"The extracellular nuclease activities of Alteromonas espejiana sp. BAL 31 are mediated by at least two distinct protein species that differ in molecular weights and catalytic properties. The two species that have been purified to homogeneity and characterized, the fast (F) and slow (S) enzymes, both possess an exonuclease activity that shortens both strands of duplex DNA, with the F nuclease displaying a much greater (approximately 19-fold) turnover number for this degradation than the S species. In the present article, it is shown that the F species also mediates the terminally directed hydrolysis of a linear duplex RNA, gradually shortening molecules of this substrate through a mechanism that results in the removal of nucleotides from both the 3' and the 5' ends. This degradation proceeds with very infrequent introduction of scissions away from the termini as demonstrated by gel electrophoretic examination of the products of partial degradation, both in duplex form and after denaturation by reaction with CH3HgOH, and by electron microscopic characterization of duplex partially degraded molecules. The apparent Michaelis constant and turnover number have been determined. At equimolar enzyme concentrations in the limit of high substrate concentration, the F nuclease will degrade duplex RNA at a rate 0.021 +/- 0.010 (S.D.) times that for a duplex DNA of comparable guanine + cytosine content. The S species, by contrast, shows very little activity against the duplex RNA substrate relative to that of the F enzyme."

The content of the granules was analyzed by analytical and two-dimensional gel electrophoreses. The distributions in the gels of vasopressin precursor and neurophysins were detected by radioimmunoassays. Analytical gel electrophoresis of the content of a crude granule preparation showed the presence of different populations of neurophysin molecules. Further analysis demonstrated that vasopressin-neurophysin and oxytocin-neurophysin can be subdivided into molecules with different pI values. Whereas newly formed granules showed two main spots of neurophysin with pI of 5.0 and 5.6, aged granules contain in addition to these different populations of neurophysin-like material, some of which had a basic pI. Vasopressin precursor activity was detected in spots containing proteins with acidic pI and Mr approximately 18,000 and also in proteins of Mr = 8,000-10,000 migrating in the basic region of the gel. The results suggest that in the neural lobe there is an aging process which gives rise to several subpopulations of neurophysins.
