https://openalex.org/W2061309565,"Interference between two freely expanding Bose-Einstein condensates has been observed. Two condensates separated by ∼40 micrometers were created by evaporatively cooling sodium atoms in a double-well potential formed by magnetic and optical forces. High-contrast matter-wave interference fringes with a period of ∼15 micrometers were observed after switching off the potential and letting the condensates expand for 40 milliseconds and overlap. This demonstrates that Bose condensed atoms are “laser-like”; that is, they are coherent and show long-range correlations. These results have direct implications for the atom laser and the Josephson effect for atoms."

https://openalex.org/W1602056757,"The expression of NOS isoforms was studied in guinea pig skeletal muscle at the mRNA and protein level, and the effect of NO on contractile response was examined. Ribonuclease protection analyses demonstrated NOS I and NOS II mRNAs in diaphragm and gastrocnemius muscle. In Western blots, NOS I and NOS II immunoreactivities were found in the particulate but not the soluble fraction of skeletal muscle. NOS activity was found almost exclusively in the particulate fraction. About 50% of this activity was Ca2+ independent. In immunohistochemistry, the anti-NOS I antibody stained distinct membrane regions of muscle fibers. The most intense staining was seen in neuromuscular endplates identified by labeling with alpha-bungarotoxin. The anti-NOS II antibody labeled muscle fibers that contained alkali-labile myosin ATPase (type I fibers). NOS II was located to intracellular structures and was also seen in ""specific pathogen-free"" animals. Pretreatment of guinea pigs with bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS) markedly intensified NOS II staining. Significant NOS III immunoreactivity was detected only in vascular endothelium. In functional experiments, tetanic muscle contractions were induced in diaphragm and gastrocnemius muscle by electrical stimulation of the innervating nerves. Pretreatment of guinea pigs with LPS or addition of S-nitroso-N-acetyl-D,L-penicillamine to the organ bath markedly decreased tetanic contractions. N(G)-nitro-L-arginine, on the other hand, increased contractile force and reversed the effect of LPS. Our data indicate that NOS II and NOS I are expressed in different structures of skeletal muscle and are involved in the regulation of contractile response."

https://openalex.org/W1511134227,"Protein kinase C (PKC) is an ubiqui-tous enzyme that mediates intracellular signal transduction in eukaryotes. Jurkat and U937 cells were exposed to microgravity during a Space Shuttle flight and stimulated with a radiolabeled phorbol ester (3H-PDBu) that specifically activates and labels several PKC isoforms. Both the total amount of 3H- PDBu labeling per cell and the relative distribution of labeling between subcellular compartments were altered in microgravity compared to onboard and ground 1 g control samples. The amount of total phorbol ester labeling per cell was increased ap-proximately twofold in microgravity samples when compared with onboard 1 g samples for both cell lines. The subcellular distribution of PKC in the cytosol and nuclear fractions appeared to be correlated with the applied acceleration. In both cell types the relative amount of phorbol ester labeling in the nuclear fraction decreased with applied ac-celeration, whereas the labeling in cytosolic fraction increased with g level. No significant differences were observed between labeling levels in the membrane fraction in both cell types. Interleukin- lβ synthesis by U937 cells was markedly decreased in microgravity when compared to the onboard 1 g control, suggesting that the observed alterations in PKC distribution may have functional consequences. The results may have important implications for the effect of gravity on cellular signal transduction.—Schmitt, D. A., Hatton, J. P., Emond, C., Chaput, D., Paris, H., Levade, T., Ca- zenave, J.-P., Schaffar, L. The distribution of protein kinase C in human leukocytes is altered in microgravity. FASEB J. 10, 1627-1634 (1996)"
https://openalex.org/W1824429632,"We have previously observed that obese viable yellow (Avy/a) mice exhibit increased intracellular Ca2+ ([Ca2+]i) and fatty acid synthase (FAS) gene expression; further, recombinant agouti protein increases in cultured adipocytes and these effects are inhibited by Ca2+ channel blockade. Accordingly, we determined the effect of Ca2+ channel blockade (nifedipine for 4 wk) on FAS and obesity in transgenic mice expressing the agouti gene in a ubiquitous manner. The transgenic mice initially were significantly heavier (30.5+/-0.6 vs. 27.3+/-0.3 g; P<0.001) and exhibited a 0.81 degrees C lower initial core temperature (P<0.0005), an approximately twofold increase in fat pad weights (P=0.002), a sevenfold increase in adipose FAS activity (P=0.009), and a twofold increase in plasma insulin level (P<0.05) compared to control mice. Nifedipine treatment resulted in an 18% decrease in fat pad weights (P<0.007) and a 74% decrease in adipose FAS activity (P=0.03), normalized circulating insulin levels and insulin sensitivity (P<0.05), and transiently elevated core temperature in the transgenic mice, but was without effect in the control mice. These data suggest that agouti regulates FAS, fat storage, and possibly thermogenesis, at least partially, via a [Ca2+]i-dependent mechanism, and that Ca2+ channel blockade may partially attenuate agouti-induced obesity."

https://openalex.org/W1529040571,"Supplementation with choline during pregnancy in rats causes a long-lasting improvement of visuospatial memory of the offspring. The biochemical mechanism of this effect may be related to the function of choline as a precursor of phosphatidylcholine (PC), the substrate of a receptor-stimulated enzyme, phospholipase D (PLD). PLD activation initiates the sequential formation of two intracellular messengers, phosphatidic acid and l,2-sn-diacyl- glycerol. We hypothesized that prenatal choline status may cause long-term modulation of PLD-catalyzed PC hydrolysis in the hippocampus, a brain region implicated in visuospatial memory functions. PLD activity was determined in hippocampal slices prelabeled with [3H]glycerol or [3H]oleic acid by measuring the PLD-catalyzed formation of [3H]phosphatidyl- propanol in the presence of 1-propanol. Slices were obtained from male pups born to mothers consuming a control diet, a choline-supplemented diet, or a choline-free diet from days 11 to 17 of pregnancy. The radiolabeling of phospholipid classes was unaffected by the treatments. Prenatal choline supplementation significantly increased basal PLD activity in [3H]glyc- erol-labeled slices [by 46% of controls on postnatal day (P) 7 and by 36% on P21 ], and [3H]oleate-labeled slices (by 91 % on P7), as well as glutamate-stimulated PLD activity in [3H]oleate-labeled slices (by 60% on P7). Prenatal choline deficiency failed to alter PLD activity. The actions of choline apparently required intact cells because in vitro assays of PLD activity in hippocampal homogenates, using fluorescent NBD- PC as substrate, revealed no differences between groups. The results show that prenatal choline supplementation up-regulates basal and receptor-stimulated PLD activity in the hippocampus during postnatal development.—Holler, T., Cermak, J. M., Blusztajn, J. K. Dietary choline supplementation in pregnant rats increases hippocampal phospholipase D activity of the offspring. FASEBJ. 10,1653-1659(1996)"

https://openalex.org/W1785329267,"We have previously shown that a 30,000 Mr protein extracted from guinea pig inner ear tissue is recognized by autoantibodies present in the serum of patients suffering from autoimmune inner ear disease. This protein was localized in the modiolus and in the organ of Corti. We have now identified this protein by a combination of micro-sequencing and matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry of its tryptic peptides. A partial sequence of the protein was thereby determined. These data and 2-dimensional gel electrophoresis followed by immunoblot- ting experiments showed that the 30,000 Mr inner ear antigen is the major peripheral myelin protein Po. This suggests that protein Po may be an important autoantigen in autoimmune inner ear disease.—Cao, M. Y., Dupriez, V. J., Rider, M. H., Deggouj, N., Gersdorff, M. C. H., Rousseau, G. G., Tomasi, J.-P. Myelin protein Po as a potential autoantigen in autoimmune inner ear disease. FASEB J. 10, 1635-1640(1996)"

https://openalex.org/W1923737054,"A novel method to monitor specific peptidase activities in biological samples as complex as undiluted plasma/blood is described. The approach is based on the design of synthetic polypeptide substrates in which di- or triarginine sequences are linked to each other via one or more other amino acids recognized specifically by the peptidase to be determined. Detection of chymotrypsin and renin activities using synthetic substrates P4 (F-R-R-R-F-V-R-R-F-NH2) and P5 (R-R-R-L-L- R-R-L-L-R-R-R), respectively, serves to demonstrate the principles of this new assay system. A polyion-sensitive membrane electrode, prepared by doping polymer films with dinonylnaphthalene- sulfonate (DNNS), is shown to exhibit significant nonequilibrium electromotive force (EMF) responses toward these and other polycationic substrates at microgram/milliliter levels under physiological conditions. The same electrode, however, exhibits much smaller total EMF response toward the shorter fragments of the synthetic peptides generated by peptidase activity; hence, the addition of peptidase to a solution containing the synthetic substrate yields a change in electrode EMF response, the rate of which is proportional to the activity of peptidase present. Other synthetic polycationic peptides as well as natural polycationic peptides (e.g., protamine) that lack specific cleavage sites for chy- motrypsin and renin, yet are detected by the DNNS- based membrane electrode, do not elicit any significant change in EMF response in the presence of the peptidases, confirming the feasibility and util-ity of the proposed bioanalytical method.—Han, I. S., Ramamurthy, N., Yun, J. H., Schaller, U., Mey- erhoff, M. E., Yang, V. C.

https://openalex.org/W1555045695,"Gene targeting in mouse embryonic stem cells generates mutations by replacing an endogenous chromosomal region with a copy disrupted by a selectable genetic marker. The most commonly used selectable marker is the bacterial neo(r) gene, which confers resistance in mammalian cells to the antibiotic G418. Use of an alternative selectable marker, the Salmonella typhimurium gene hisD, should provide expanded applications for gene targeting. The hisD gene encodes the protein histidinol dehydrogenase, which catalyzes the conversion of histidinol to the amino acid histidine. Histidinol is toxic to mammalian cells, while histidine is an essential mammalian amino acid. Consequently, growth selection in cultures with media containing histidinol in place of histidine occurs by both histidine starvation and histidinol poisoning. The hisD selection is being tested for potential use in gene targeting experiments with mouse embryonic stem (ES) cells. Currently, most successful gene targeting experiments use primary embryonic fibroblast feeder layers, which assist in the maintenance of the pluripotential state of the embryonic stem cells. To support ES cell stability under histidinol selection, mice transgenic for the S. typhimurium hisD gene have been produced and used to generate embryonic fibroblast feeder cells. The transgenic embryonic fibroblasts survive under a wide range of histidinol-containing growth conditions and support growth of ES cell cultures."
