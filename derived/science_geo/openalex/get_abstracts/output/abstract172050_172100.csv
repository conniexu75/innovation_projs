https://openalex.org/W2128985829,"Breast cancer patients with the same stage of disease can have markedly different treatment responses and overall outcome. The strongest predictors for metastases (for example, lymph node status and histological grade) fail to classify accurately breast tumours according to their clinical behaviour. Chemotherapy or hormonal therapy reduces the risk of distant metastases by approximately one-third; however, 70-80% of patients receiving this treatment would have survived without it. None of the signatures of breast cancer gene expression reported to date allow for patient-tailored therapy strategies. Here we used DNA microarray analysis on primary breast tumours of 117 young patients, and applied supervised classification to identify a gene expression signature strongly predictive of a short interval to distant metastases ('poor prognosis' signature) in patients without tumour cells in local lymph nodes at diagnosis (lymph node negative). In addition, we established a signature that identifies tumours of BRCA1 carriers. The poor prognosis signature consists of genes regulating cell cycle, invasion, metastasis and angiogenesis. This gene expression profile will outperform all currently used clinical parameters in predicting disease outcome. Our findings provide a strategy to select patients who would benefit from adjuvant therapy."
https://openalex.org/W1973092951,"The hypoxia-inducible factors (HIFs) 1alpha and 2alpha are key mammalian transcription factors that exhibit dramatic increases in both protein stability and intrinsic transcriptional potency during low-oxygen stress. This increased stability is due to the absence of proline hydroxylation, which in normoxia promotes binding of HIF to the von Hippel-Lindau (VHL tumor suppressor) ubiquitin ligase. We now show that hypoxic induction of the COOH-terminal transactivation domain (CAD) of HIF occurs through abrogation of hydroxylation of a conserved asparagine in the CAD. Inhibitors of Fe(II)- and 2-oxoglutarate-dependent dioxygenases prevented hydroxylation of the Asn, thus allowing the CAD to interact with the p300 transcription coactivator. Replacement of the conserved Asn by Ala resulted in constitutive p300 interaction and strong transcriptional activity. Full induction of HIF-1alpha and -2alpha, therefore, relies on the abrogation of both Pro and Asn hydroxylation, which during normoxia occur at the degradation and COOH-terminal transactivation domains, respectively."

https://openalex.org/W2032817175,"Parkinson's disease is a movement disorder characterized by degeneration of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta. Dopaminergic neuronal loss also occurs in Drosophila melanogaster upon directed expression of alpha-synuclein, a protein implicated in the pathogenesis of Parkinson's disease and a major component of proteinaceous Lewy bodies. We report that directed expression of the molecular chaperone Hsp70 prevented dopaminergic neuronal loss associated with alpha-synuclein in Drosophila and that interference with endogenous chaperone activity accelerated alpha-synuclein toxicity. Furthermore, Lewy bodies in human postmortem tissue immunostained for molecular chaperones, also suggesting that chaperones may play a role in Parkinson's disease progression."
https://openalex.org/W2021785060,"Amyloid is associated with debilitating human ailments including Alzheimer's and prion diseases. Biochemical, biophysical, and imaging analyses revealed that fibers produced by Escherichia coli called curli were amyloid. The CsgA curlin subunit, purified in the absence of the CsgB nucleator, adopted a soluble, unstructured form that upon prolonged incubation assembled into fibers that were indistinguishable from curli. In vivo, curli biogenesis was dependent on the nucleation-precipitation machinery requiring the CsgE and CsgF chaperone-like and nucleator proteins, respectively. Unlike eukaryotic amyloid formation, curli biogenesis is a productive pathway requiring a specific assembly machinery."
https://openalex.org/W1984654391,"Ralstonia solanacearum is a devastating, soil-borne plant pathogen with a global distribution and an unusually wide host range. It is a model system for the dissection of molecular determinants governing pathogenicity. We present here the complete genome sequence and its analysis of strain GMI1000. The 5.8-megabase (Mb) genome is organized into two replicons: a 3.7-Mb chromosome and a 2.1-Mb megaplasmid. Both replicons have a mosaic structure providing evidence for the acquisition of genes through horizontal gene transfer. Regions containing genetically mobile elements associated with the percentage of G+C bias may have an important function in genome evolution. The genome encodes many proteins potentially associated with a role in pathogenicity. In particular, many putative attachment factors were identified. The complete repertoire of type III secreted effector proteins can be studied. Over 40 candidates were identified. Comparison with other genomes suggests that bacterial plant pathogens and animal pathogens harbour distinct arrays of specialized type III-dependent effectors."

https://openalex.org/W1488048016,"We have discovered an expansive photoreceptive 'net' in the mouse inner retina, visualized by using an antiserum against melanopsin, a likely photopigment. This immunoreactivity is evident in a subset of retinal ganglion cells that morphologically resemble those that project to the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN), the site of the primary circadian pacemaker. Our results indicate that this bilayered photoreceptive net is anatomically distinct from the rod and cone photoreceptors of the outer retina, and suggest that it may mediate non-visual photoreceptive tasks such as the regulation of circadian rhythms."
https://openalex.org/W2004730886,"Aerosol concentration and cloud droplet radii derived from space-borne measurements are used to explore the effect of aerosols on cloud microphysics. Cloud droplet size is found to be largest (14 micrometers) over remote tropical oceans and smallest (6 micrometers) over highly polluted continental areas. Small droplets are also present in clouds downwind of continents. By using estimates of droplet radii coupled with aerosol load, a statistical mean relationship is derived. The cloud droplet size appears to be better correlated with an aerosol index that is representative of the aerosol column number under some assumptions than with the aerosol optical thickness. This study reveals that the effect of aerosols on cloud microphysics is significant and occurs on a global scale."
https://openalex.org/W2040805319,"The pha - 4 locus encodes a forkhead box A (FoxA/HNF3) transcription factor homolog that specifies organ identity for Caenorhabditis elegans pharyngeal cells. We used microarrays to identify pharyngeal genes and analyzed those genes to determine which were direct PHA-4 targets. Our data suggest that PHA-4 directly activates most or all pharyngeal genes. Furthermore, the relative affinity of PHA-4 for different TRTTKRY (R = A/G, K = T/G, Y = T/C) elements modulates the onset of gene expression, providing a mechanism to activate pharyngeal genes at different developmental stages. We suggest that direct transcriptional regulation of entire gene networks may be a common feature of organ identity genes."

https://openalex.org/W2131864158,It is widely assumed that variations in Earth's radiative energy budget at large time and space scales are small. We present new evidence from a compilation of over two decades of accurate satellite data that the top-of-atmosphere (TOA) tropical radiative energy budget is much more dynamic and variable than previously thought. Results indicate that the radiation budget changes are caused by changes in tropical mean cloudiness. The results of several current climate model simulations fail to predict this large observed variation in tropical energy budget. The missing variability in the models highlights the critical need to improve cloud modeling in the tropics so that prediction of tropical climate on interannual and decadal time scales can be improved.

https://openalex.org/W2005640132,"The collective excitation spectrum of interacting electrons in one dimension has been measured by controlling the energy and momentum of electrons tunneling between two closely spaced, parallel quantum wires in a GaAs/AlGaAs heterostructure while measuring the resulting conductance. The excitation spectrum deviates from the noninteracting spectrum, attesting to the importance of Coulomb interactions. An observed 30% enhancement of the excitation velocity relative to noninteracting electrons with the same density, a parameter determined experimentally, is consistent with theories on interacting electrons in one dimension. In short wires, 6 and 2 micrometers long, finite size effects, resulting from the breaking of translational invariance, are observed."

https://openalex.org/W2039460652,"Satellite observations suggest that the thermal radiation emitted by Earth to space increased by more than 5 watts per square meter, while reflected sunlight decreased by less than 2 watts per square meter, in the tropics over the period 1985–2000, with most of the increase occurring after 1990. By analyzing temporal changes in the frequency of occurrence of emitted thermal and reflected solar fluxes, the effects of El Niño–Southern Oscillation are minimized, and an independent longer-time-scale variation of the radiation budget is identified. Similar analyses of upper tropospheric humidity, cloud amount, surface air temperature, and vertical velocity confirm that these flux changes are associated with a decadal-time-scale strengthening of the tropical Hadley and Walker circulations. Equatorial convective regions have intensified in upward motion and moistened, while both the equatorial and subtropical subsidence regions have become drier and less cloudy."

Like ferrocene and other carbon-based metallocenes, the structure of 1 has parallel and planar five-membered rings symmetrically positioned about the central metal atom. Despite its electron-deficient (16 electron) and formally zerovalent titanium character, salts of 1 are highly stable toward heat and air, both in solution and in the solid state. Computational studies show that the pentaphosphacyclopentadienyl unit, P5, functions as an unusually effective acceptor ligand, and this results in substantial stabilization of 1."
https://openalex.org/W1589896765,"The motor enzyme kinesin makes hundreds of unidirectional 8-nanometer steps without detaching from or freely sliding along the microtubule on which it moves. We investigated the kinesin stepping mechanism by immobilizing a Drosophila kinesin derivative through the carboxyl-terminal end of the neck coiled-coil domain and measuring orientations of microtubules moved by single enzyme molecules at submicromolar adenosine triphosphate concentrations. The kinesin-mediated microtubule-surface linkage was sufficiently torsionally stiff (>/=2.0 +/- 0.9 x 10(-20) Newton meters per radian2) that stepping by the hypothesized symmetric hand-over-hand mechanism would produce 180 degree rotations of the microtubule relative to the immobilized kinesin neck. In fact, there were no rotations, a finding that is inconsistent with symmetric hand-over-hand movement. An alternative ""inchworm"" mechanism is consistent with our experimental results."
https://openalex.org/W2021685536,"All physical implementations of quantum bits (or qubits, the logical elements in a putative quantum computer) must overcome conflicting requirements: the qubits should be manipulable through external signals, while remaining isolated from their environment. Proposals based on quantum optics emphasize optimal isolation, while those following the solid-state route exploit the variability and scalability of nanoscale fabrication techniques. Recently, various designs using superconducting structures have been successfully tested for quantum coherent operation, however, the ultimate goal of reaching coherent evolution over thousands of elementary operations remains a formidable task. Protecting qubits from decoherence by exploiting topological stability is a qualitatively new proposal that holds promise for long decoherence times, but its physical implementation has remained unclear. Here we show how strongly correlated systems developing an isolated twofold degenerate quantum dimer liquid ground state can be used in the construction of topologically stable qubits; we discuss their implementation using Josephson junction arrays. Although the complexity of their architecture challenges the technology base available today, such topological qubits greatly benefit from their built-in fault-tolerance."
https://openalex.org/W1981112331,"In bacteria, promoter recognition depends on the RNA polymerase σ subunit, which combines with the catalytically proficient RNA polymerase core to form the holoenzyme. The major class of bacterial promoters is defined by two conserved elements (the –10 and –35 elements, which are 10 and 35 nucleotides upstream of the initiation point, respectively) that are contacted by σ in the holoenzyme. We show that recognition of promoters of this class depends on the “flexible flap” domain of the RNA polymerase β subunit. The flap interacts with conserved region 4 of σ and triggers a conformational change that moves region 4 into the correct position for interaction with the –35 element. Because the flexible flap is evolutionarily conserved, this domain may facilitate promoter recognition by specificity factors in eukaryotes as well."

Electrical microstimulation in these regions elicits short-latency contralateral saccades. To determine how spatiotemporal dynamics of microstimulation-evoked activity are converted into saccade plans, we used a combination of real-time optical imaging and microstimulation in behaving monkeys. Short stimulation trains evoked a rapid and widespread wave of depolarization followed by unexpected large and prolonged hyperpolarization. During this hyperpolarization saccades are almost exclusively ipsilateral, suggesting an important role for hyperpolarization in determining saccade goal."
https://openalex.org/W1966707022,"Population dynamics of Canada lynx (Lynx canadensis) have been of interest to ecologists for nearly sixty years. Two competing hypotheses concerning lynx population dynamics and large-scale spatial synchrony are currently debated. The first suggests that dispersal is substantial among lynx populations, and the second proposes that lynx at the periphery of their range exist in small, isolated patches that maintain cycle synchrony via correlation with extrinsic environmental factors. Resolving the nature of lynx population dynamics and dispersal is important both to ecological theory and to the conservation of threatened lynx populations: the lack of knowledge about connectivity between populations at the southern periphery of the lynx's geographic range delayed their legal listing in the United States. We test these competing hypotheses using microsatellite DNA markers and lynx samples from 17 collection sites in the core and periphery of the lynx's geographic range. Here we show high gene flow despite separation by distances greater than 3,100 km, supporting the dispersal hypothesis. We therefore suggest that management actions in the contiguous United States should focus on maintaining connectivity with the core of the lynx's geographic range."

https://openalex.org/W1966666560,"Flap endonuclease 1 (FEN1) is a structure-specific nuclease that cleaves substrates containing unannealed 5′-flaps during Okazaki fragment processing. Cleavage removes the flap at or near the point of annealing. The preferred substrate for archaeal FEN1 or the 5′-nuclease domains of bacterial DNA polymerases is a double-flap structure containing a 3′-tail on the upstream primer adjacent to the 5′-flap. We report that FEN1 inSaccharomyces cerevisiae (Rad27p) exhibits a similar specificity. Cleavage was most efficient when the upstream primer contained a 1-nucleotide 3′-tail as compared with the fully annealed upstream primer traditionally tested. The site of cleavage was exclusively at a position one nucleotide into the annealed region, allowing human DNA ligase I to seal all resulting nicks. In contrast, a portion of the products from traditional flap substrates is not ligated. The 3′-OH of the upstream primer is not critical for double-flap recognition, because Rad27p is tolerant of modifications. However, the positioning of the 3′-nucleotide defines the site of cleavage. We have tested substrates having complementary tails that equilibrate to many structures by branch migration. FEN1 only cleaved those containing a 1-nucleotide 3′-tail. Equilibrating substrates containing 12-ribonucleotides at the end of the 5′-flap simulates the situation in vivo. Rad27p cleaves this substrate in the expected 1-nucleotide 3′-tail configuration.

The preferred substrate for endonucleolytic cleavage was defined as a nick-flap substrate in vitro. It consists of upstream and downstream primers annealed to a template in a manner that creates a nick. The downstream primer contains a single-stranded 5′-flap region (4.Harrington J.J. Lieber M.R.

The proposed mechanism for endonuclease activity is that FEN1 recognizes the 5′ terminus of the flap, traverses the single-stranded DNA to the base of the flap, and then performs the cleavage reaction (16.Murante R.S.

Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 13347-13354Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). The helical arch structure is thought to be involved in both 5′-end recognition and motion on the flap (26.Ceska T.A.

Cell. 1998; 95: 135-146Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). The binding and cleavage of FEN1 are influenced by the presence of upstream primers. Both the upstream primer and template form a double-stranded region, which is proposed to direct FEN1 to bind near the junction between the flap and the downstream duplex (24.Harrington J.J. Lieber M.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 4503-4508Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). The presence of the upstream duplex is important for both activating and positioning cleavage by the 5′-nuclease domain in bacteria, and this duplex can be as small as two base pairs (19.Kaiser M.W.

Exonucleolytic degradation of the first nucleotide on the downstream primer of a nick substrate by calf FEN1 was found to be efficient. However, exonucleolytic cleavage became slower if the upstream primer was missing or the two primers were separated by a 1-nucleotide gap (29.Murante R.S. Huang L. Turchi J.J. Bambara R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 1191-1196Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Siegal et al. (30.Siegal G. Turchi J.J. Myers T.W. Bambara R.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 9377-9381Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar) also demonstrated that the exonuclease activity on both RNA and DNA primers is stimulated by DNA polymerase-directed synthesis in vitro. Overall, these observations suggest that the nuclease is designed to work with a DNA polymerase during strand-displacement synthesis and that extension of the upstream primer regulates the activity of FEN1. When the downstream primer is initiated by RNA, it is susceptible to endonucleolytic cleavage either within or beyond the RNA segment (7.Murante R.S. Rumbaugh J.A. Barnes C.J. Norton J.R. Bambara R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 25888-25897Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Absence of the upstream primer inhibits the ability of FEN1 to remove exonucleolytically the 5′-monoribonucleotide that remains after RNase H degradation of the RNA (31.Huang L. Rumbaugh J.A.

Proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) appears to act as a coordination factor at the replication fork and interacts with different enzymes in a stepwise manner. PCNA is a trimeric, toroidal molecule that surrounds DNA to act as a sliding clamp to increase the processivity of DNA polymerase δ in eukaryotic cells. According to the model, after creation of the flap intermediate, two nucleases collaborate for initiator RNA removal. The helicase/endonuclease Dna2p interacts with FEN1 and replication protein A (RPA), and this enzyme removes a portion of the flap. Of the two endonucleases, only FEN1 has the specificity for cleavage at the base of the flap. PCNA interacts with FEN1 by tethering it to the cleavage site to stimulate catalysis. PCNA then interacts with DNA ligase I to facilitate sealing of the nick. Cleavage specificities of the members of the FEN1 nuclease family have been examined in vitro (16.Murante R.S. Rust L.

FEN1 cleaves nick-flap substrates at two locations: at the base of the flap or at a position one nucleotide into the downstream annealed region. This leaves either a nick or a 1-nucleotide gap product. The nick product is a substrate for DNA ligase I, but the gap would have to be converted to a nick before ligation could occur. This would require additional action by the polymerase and would add steps to the current model for Okazaki fragment processing. To clarify the activity of FEN1 in DNA replication, we examined the substrate specificity of the FEN1 from Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Rad27p. Previous reports have shown higher cleavage activity and specificity for FEN1 on double-flap structures (16.Murante R.S. Rust L. Bambara R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 30377-30383Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar, 19.Kaiser M.W. Lyamicheva N. Ma W. Miller C. Neri B. Fors L. Lyamichev V.I. J. Biol.

Furthermore, rad27-G240Dp, the FEN1 from a mutant strain with nearly normal growth rate, cleaves the double-flap substrate but not the conventional nick-flap substrate (23.Xie Y. Liu Y. Argueso J.L. Henricksen L.A. Kao H.I. Bambara R.A. Alani E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 4889-4899Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). This suggests the involvement of FEN1 activity in resolving a double-flap structure during replication. However, the role of double-flap structures in facilitation of FEN1 cleavage activity has not been characterized in detail. The wild-type and mutant nucleases have been examined herein, and results support a role for the double-flap structure as a substrate for FEN1 in Okazaki fragment processing. Oligonucleotides, with and without modifications, were synthesized either by Integrated DNA Technologies (Coralville, IA) or by the Midland Certified Reagent Co. (Midland, TX). Radionucleotides [γ-32P]ATP (3000 Ci/mmol) and [α-32P]dCTP (3000 Ci/mmol) were from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. The T4 polynucleotide kinase (labeling grade) and the Klenow fragment of DNA polymerase I were both from Roche Molecular Biochemicals. RNase-free solutions and reagents were from Ambion, Inc. (Austin, TX). All other reagents were the best available commercial grade. The wild-type and mutant Rad27p coding regions were PCR-amplified from Rad27-pUC19 (provided by Dr. E. Alani at Cornell University). Restriction enzyme sites for EcoRI,NdeI, and XhoI were introduced to assist subcloning (New England BioLabs, MA). The PCR primer sequences used were 5′-GCCGAATTCCATATGGGTATTAAAGGTTTGAATGC-3′ and 5′-GCCGAATTCCTCGAGTCTTCTTCCCTTTGTGACTTTATTC-3′ (Integrated DNA Technologies, Coralville, IA). The amplified product fragments were directly cloned into a T-A vector (Invitrogen). Subsequently, these fragments were excised from the T-A vector by NdeI andXhoI and subcloned into a pET-24b protein expression vector (Novagen), which added a 6-histidine tag at the C terminus of the proteins. The pET-24b plasmids containing the wild-type and mutant proteins were transformed intoEscherichia coli strain BL21(DE3) codon plus (Stratagene, CA). A single colony was picked and inoculated. Two liters of cultures was grown at 37 °C with shaking until the optical density reached ∼0.5, and the protein was induced by adding isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside (final concentration of 0.5 mm) and incubating at 37 °C for 3 h. The cells were harvested by centrifugation at 1000 ×g for 5 min, and the pellet was resuspended in lysis buffer (50 mm NaH2PO4, pH 8.0, 300 mm NaCl, 10 mm imidazole, 1 mm DTT, and 1 mm PMSF). Subsequently, the resuspension was lysed using a French press. Cell debris was removed by centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 30 min. The purification was conducted by fast-protein liquid chromatography. The collected supernatant material was directly applied onto a 10-ml Ni2+-agarose column (Qiagen, Chatsworth, CA) equilibrated in lysis buffer. The column was then washed with 5 column volumes of wash buffer (50 mm NaH2PO4, pH 8.0, 300 mm NaCl, and 20 mm imidazole). Rad27p was eluted with a linear gradient in 10 column volumes of elution buffer (50 mm NaH2PO4, pH 8.0, 300 mm NaCl, and 250 mm imidazole). The peak fractions were pooled (20 ml) and dialyzed into HI-20 mm NaH2PO4 buffer (30 mm Hepes, pH 7.8, 0.5% inositol, 0.25 mm EDTA, 0.01% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm DTT, 1 mm PMSF, and 20 mm NaH2PO4). The dialyzed sample was centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 30 min to remove any proteins that were denatured during the dialysis. The supernatant material was loaded onto a 2-ml hydroxyapatite column (Bio-Rad, CA) equilibrated with HI-20 mm NaH2PO4buffer. The protein was eluted with a linear gradient of 10 column volumes from 250 mm NaH2PO4 to 30 mm NaH2PO4. About 2 ml of peak fractions were pooled and dialyzed into HI-30 mm KCl buffer (30 mm Hepes, pH 7.8, 0.5% inositol, 0.25 mmEDTA, 0.01% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm DTT, and 30 mmKCl). The pooled sample was applied onto a CM-Sepharose column (Amersham Biosciences, Inc.) equilibrated with HI-30 mm KCl buffer, and the elution was carried out with a linear gradient of 10 column volumes from 30 mm KCl to 2 m KCl. The rad27-G240Dp preparation contained some inactive truncation products (∼20%), as described previously (23.Xie Y. Liu Y. Argueso J.L. Henricksen L.A. Kao H.I. Bambara R.A. Alani E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 4889-4899Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Therefore, the purification scheme was modified for the mutant protein. After the Ni2+-agarose column, the peak fractions of rad27-G240Dp were pooled, dialyzed into HI-30 mm KCl buffer, and loaded onto the Mono-S column (Amersham Biosciences, Inc.). Subsequently, the peak fractions were collected and dialyzed into HI-2 m(NH4)2SO4 buffer. This sample was applied onto a Phenyl-Sepharose column (Amersham Biosciences, Inc.) equilibrated with HI buffer (30 mm Hepes, pH 7.8, 0.5% inositol, 0.25 mm EDTA, 0.01% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm DTT, and 1 mm PMSF), and rad27-G240Dp was eluted with 10 column volumes of a linear gradient from 2 m(NH4)2SO4 to 0 m(NH4)2SO4. A hydroxyapatite column (described as above) was used as the last column. Highly purified Rad27p (>95%) and rad27-G240Dp (∼80%) were obtained. The truncation contaminants in the rad27-G240Dp preparation did not possess any nuclease activities. Recombinant human DNA ligase I was a generous gift from the Hayes Laboratory at the University of Rochester. Oligomer sequences are listed in Table I, and they were annealed as described in the figure legends to form various structures, such as nick, nick-flap, gap-flap, double-flap, gap double-flap, or displacement substrates. For the nick substrate, two primers were annealed to a template such that the upstream and downstream primers formed a nick. Nick-flap substrates were generated because of the inclusion of sequences that are not complementary to the template at the 5′-end of the downstream primer. These sequences form the unannealed 5′-flaps, and the upstream primers were annealed to the template to form a nick at the base of the flap. The gap-flap substrates were generated by introducing a 1-nucleotide gap into the nick-flap substrates. After annealing a downstream primer to its corresponding template, the double-flap substrates were created by annealing an upstream primer containing a 3′-tail as described above. These substrates contain various lengths of upstream primers with either non-complementary or complementary tails at the 3′-end. The gap double-flap substrate has a 1-nucleotide gap between the non-complementary 3′-tail and the unannealed downstream 5′-flap. Displacement substrates contain all complementary nucleotides to the template, which includes partial overlapping sequences. These overlapping regions at the beginning of the 5′-end of the downstream primer and the 3′-end of the upstream primer will compete for the same sites on the template. The RNA-DNA chimera displacement substrates contain 12 ribonucleotides at the 5′ region of the downstream primer, which mimics the in vivo situation of Okazaki fragments (37.Arezi B. Kuchta R.D. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2000; 25: 572-576Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Annealing and labeling conditions were the same as described previously (23.Xie Y. Liu Y.

Cleavage-ligation assays were incubated at 30 °C for 15 min in the presence of 1 mm ATP. The denatured reactions were resolved on 12% or 15% polyacrylamide, 7 murea denaturing gels. Each gel was quantitated using a PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics) and analyzed using ImageQuant version 1.2 software from Molecular Dynamics. In all studies, the amounts of substrate and products were quantitated, and the percent of product formed was determined by the product/(substrate plus product) ratio. This method allows for the correction of any loading errors among lanes. All assays were performed at least in triplicate, and the representative assays are shown. Previous analyses of FEN1 substrate specificity have usually been conducted on nick-flap substrates with a specific structure. The flaps have been fixed through the use of flap sequences that are not complementary to the template. The advantage of a fixed substrate is that the starting material for the cleavage reaction is a single species. However, such substrates differ from the natural substrate produced by strand-displacement synthesis. In the natural substrate, the flap is fully complementary to the template. Depending on the flap length, the substrate can equilibrate to a variety of structures, some with double flaps. To fully understand the substrate specificity of Rad27p, we have tested cleavage on both fixed and equilibrating flap substrates. To define structural requirements in the upstream primer, we examined cleavage efficiency and specificity on fixed substrates having various lengths of unannealed 3′-tails (Fig. 1 A). To denote that both the 5′-flaps and 3′-tails are not complementary in these substrates, they are represented by gray-textured lines on the schematic representation of the substrate. A double-flap structure containing a 1-nucleotide tail at the 3′-end was cleaved with the highest efficiency (lanes 11–15). This substrate preference is evident throughout the range of nuclease concentrations tested. Significantly, the cleavage efficiency on the double-flap structure containing a 1-nucleotide 3′-tail was much greater than that for the conventional nick-flap structure (lanes 6–10 and lanes 11–15). For example, at the highest enzyme concentration tested, the difference was about 4-fold (lanes 10 and 15). Henceforth, a substrate with this structure will be denoted as a “3′ 1-nucleotide double-flap.” As observed previously for forms of FEN1 (4.Harrington J.J. Lieber M.R.

A portion of the substrate molecules was cut at the base of the 5′-flap, releasing a 6-nucleotide oligomer. Another portion was cut at a position one nucleotide into the annealed region, releasing a 7-nucleotide oligomer. The latter cut left a 1-nucleotide gap between the upstream and the downstream primers. This population of products requires synthesis to fill in the gap before ligation would be possible. The 3′ 1-nucleotide double-flap structure was cut in a single position between the first 2 base pairs in the downstream duplex. This makes a nick product. The substrate with a 2-nucleotide 3′-tail was cut to generate 7- and 8-nucleotide products (lanes 16–20) with a slight preference for the 7-mer. An interpretation of this result is that the 2-nucleotide 3′-tail is recognized, albeit inefficiently, as a characteristic of the substrate for cleavage to make the 7-nucleoti"

Here we show that lysogeny occurs in natural populations of an autotrophic picoplankton (Synechococcus) and that there is a seasonal pattern to this interaction. Because lysogeny confers immunity to infection by related viruses, this process may account for the resistance to viral infection seen in common forms of autotrophic picoplankton."

Using EST analysis and cDNA microarrays, we find that in T. reesei expression of the genes encoding the enzymes of the tricarboxylic acid cycle and the proteins of the electron transport chain is programmed in a way that favors the oxidation of pyruvate via the tricarboxylic acid cycle rather than its reduction to ethanol by fermentation. Moreover, the results indicate that acetaldehyde may be channeled into acetate rather than ethanol, thus preventing the regeneration of NAD+, a pivotal product required for anaerobic metabolism.

This finding has significant implications for the development of metabolically engineered cellulolytic microorganisms for fuel production from cellulose biomass. Evolution has produced a diverse array of metabolic pathways and regulatory mechanisms that reflect the adaptation of an immense variety of microorganisms to different environments and nutritional requirements. A prominent example is the metabolism of glucose, the primary and preferred fuel for eukaryotic microorganisms. Although glucose is metabolized by a highly conserved series of connected enzymatic reactions, the mechanisms that regulate its fate and the properties of the ATP-producing pathways have been subjected to selection pressure during evolution. Aerobic (respiration) and anaerobic (fermentation) pathways are used by microorganisms to obtain energy from glucose, in the form of ATP. These pathways allow organisms to produce ATP at different rates and with different efficiencies; respiration proceeds at a lower rate and with a high yield, whereas fermentation operates at higher rates but with lower yield. Selection pressure imposed by energy limitation and the high ATP yield of respiration has been implicated in facilitating the evolutionary transition from unicellular to undifferentiated multicellular organisms (1.Pfeiffer T. Schuster S. Bonhoeffer S. Science. 2001; 292: 504-507Crossref PubMed Scopus (933) Google Scholar). Unicellular microorganisms, such as the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, use both pathways depending on the metabolic state of the cell, whereas multicellular microorganisms, such as filamentous fungi, preferentially use respiration (2.Kelly J.M. Drysdale M.R. Sealy-Lewis H.M. Jones I.G. Lockington R.A. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1990; 222: 323-328Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Mucor racemosus, a dimorphic fungus that can grow either in a unicellular (yeast-like) or a multicellular (mycelial) form, also uses both; the unicellular form exploits fermentation, whereas the multicellular form is capable of respiration (3.Schulz B.E. Kraepelin G. Hinkelmann W. J. Gen. Microbiol. 1974; 82: 1-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 4.Rogers P.J. Clark-Walker G.D. Stewart P.R. J.

S. cerevisiae preferentially ferments glucose, even in the presence of oxygen, producing ethanol and CO2 by anaerobic metabolism. Only after exhaustion of the available glucose is respiration activated, and the yeast cells then use the ethanol as a carbon and energy source for aerobic metabolism. The switch from anaerobic to aerobic metabolism, referred to as the diauxic shift, has stimulated a profusion of research on metabolic regulation in S. cerevisiae and other eukaryotic microorganisms (6.DeRisi J.L. Iyer V.R. Brown P.O. Science. 1997; 278: 680-686Crossref PubMed Scopus (3707) Google Scholar, 7.Kuhn K.M. DeRisi J.L. Brown P.O. Sarnow P. Mol. Cell.

However, several basic questions remain unanswered. For example, why do eukaryotic microorganisms other than S. cerevisiaepreferentially obtain energy from glucose by respiration and, therefore, do not undergo a diauxic shift? What factor(s) determine(s) this difference and at what molecular level has selection operated? The answers to these questions will have a critical impact not only on our basic knowledge of the metabolic regulation of glucose utilization and its evolution but also on the potential use of eukaryotic microorganisms for metabolic engineering and the production of useful compounds. To carry out a comprehensive investigation aimed at understanding these differences, we have established an EST data base for the filamentous fungus Trichoderma reesei. Using the complementary DNA microarray technology we analyzed the gene expression profile during glucose exhaustion and compared it to the temporal program of gene expression accompanying the metabolic shift from fermentation to respiration in S. cerevisiae (6.DeRisi J.L. Iyer V.R. Brown P.O. Science. 1997; 278: 680-686Crossref PubMed Scopus (3707) Google Scholar). The fungus T. reesei was chosen for this study because its natural habitats and nutritional requirements are very different from those of S. cerevisiae. Although relatively high concentrations of sugars prevail in the natural habitats of S. cerevisiae, the ubiquitous soil inhabitant T. reesei (10.Eveleigh D.E. Demain A.L. Solomon N. The Biology of Industrial Organisms. Benjamin/Cummings Co., Menlo Park, CA1985: 487Google Scholar) has adapted to a nutrient-poor environment in which it exploits extracellular hydrolases, such as cellulase, to obtain glucose from polysaccharides (11.Beguin P. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 1990; 44: 219-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (410) Google Scholar). In addition, the genus Trichoderma includes species of economic importance. Enzymes produced by Trichoderma are used in the textile, food, and paper industries (12.Godfrey T. Dodfrey T. West S. Industrial Enzymology. 2nd Ed. Macmillan, Basingstoke, United Kingdom1996: 361-371Google Scholar, 13.Oksanen, J., Ahvenainen, J., and Home, S. (1985) Proc. Eur. Brew.

Moreover, strains of Trichoderma that produce chitinolytic enzymes are mycoparasitic and can be used as biocontrol agents against plant-pathogenic fungi (15.Chet I. Chet I. Innovative Approaches to Plant Disease Control. Wiley, New York1987: 137-160Google Scholar). This report is based on the sequences of the 5′ ends of 2835 randomly selected cDNA clones that corresponded to 1151 unique transcripts. The complete sequence of the mitochondrial genome of T. reesei is also presented. Putative functions were assigned to 36.0% of these transcripts, unknown proteins represent 3.0%, whereas 61% of the ESTs showed no significant similarity to any other sequence in the data base, indicating that these sequences are specific to filamentous fungi and/or T. reesei. We also show that patterns of glucose-dependent regulation of gene transcription in S. cerevisiae and T. reeseidiffer in regard to critical genes whose products control the direction of flow of primary metabolites. Although the expression of genes for products involved in the tricarboxylic acid cycle and in mitochondrial respiration is repressed strongly in S. cerevisiae in the presence of glucose, in T. reesei these genes remain active under these conditions. Thus, in T. reesei, in contrast toS. cerevisiae, aerobic metabolism prevails in the presence of high levels of glucose. T. reesei, strain QM 9414, was obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC 26921). A 0.5-liter inoculum (containing 107 spores/ml) was added to a 14-liter fermentation vessel containing 10 liters of culture medium (16.El-Gogary S. Leite A. Crivellaro O. Eveleigh D.E. El-Dorry H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. (U. S. A.). 1989; 86: 6138-6141Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar) supplemented with glucose at a final concentration of 100 mm. The culture was maintained at 28 °C with constant agitation and aeration. Aliquots of the culture were withdrawn, as indicated, and mycelium was collected by filtration and frozen in liquid nitrogen. Glucose concentration in the culture supernatants was measured using a SERA-PAK kit (Bayer). Ethanol in the culture supernatants and acetate were measured enzymatically using the TC acetic acid and TC ethanol kits obtained from Roche Molecular Biochemicals. Total cellular RNA was extracted from glycerol-grown T. reesei cultures by the guanidium isothiocyanate procedure (17.Chirgwin J.M. Przybyla A.E. MacDonald R.J. Rutter W.J. Biochemistry. 1979; 18: 5294-5299Crossref PubMed Scopus (16652) Google Scholar), and poly(A)+ RNA was purified using oligo(dT) chromatography. A unidirectional cDNA library was constructed in the Uni-ZAP XR vector. In vivoexcision of pBluescript plasmids was performed in Escherichia coli SOLR (Stratagene). To assess the quality of the library, the ratio of recombinants to non-recombinants and the average size of the cDNA inserts were determined by PCR analysis of the DNA from 96 individual clones. Mitochondrial DNA was isolated by cesium chloride/bisbenzimide density gradient centrifugation (18.Garber R.C. Yoder O.C. Anal. Biochem. 1983; 135: 416-422Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). Shotgun libraries were constructed from sheared mitochondrial DNA cloned into pUC18. Plasmid DNA from individual colonies was prepared with the Concert rapid plasmid miniprep system (Invitrogen), and DNA sequencing reactions were performed using the BigDye terminator cycle sequencing kit (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) and the M13 reverse and M13 (−20) primers (Stratagene). For ESTs, 1The abbreviations used are: ESTexpressed sequence tagsingle-pass sequences of the 5′ ends of cDNAs were performed. Samples were loaded on an ABI 377 DNA sequencer (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) for automated sequence analysis. expressed sequence tag Sequences were edited for each EST using the program phred+phrap+consed (19.Ewing B. Hillier L. Wendl M.C. Green P. Genome Res. 1998; 8: 175-185Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 20.Ewing B. Green P. Genome Res. 1998; 8: 186-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (4901) Google Scholar, 21.Gordon D. Abajian C. Green P. Genome Res. 1998; 8: 195-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (2854) Google Scholar). Only ESTs with a minimum length of 150 bases and a phred quality value of at least 20 were considered for further analysis. Edited sequences were translated and used as query sequences to search the GenBankTMnon-redundant protein data base by using the program BLASTX (22.Altschul S.F. Gish W. Miller W. Myers E.W. Lipman D.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 215: 403-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (71449) Google Scholar) at the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI). Scores ≥80 were considered to be significant, and the top-scoring genes were used to group the transcripts by their putative function. For computational and graphical analysis of the microarrays data we employed the Cluster and TreeView programs (23.Eisen M.B. Spellman P.T. Brown P.O. Botstein D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. (U. S. A.). 1998; 95: 14863-14868Crossref PubMed Scopus (13267) Google Scholar). Mitochondrial DNA consensus was generated by phred+phrap+consed (19.Ewing B. Hillier L. Wendl M.C. Green P.

Genome Res. 1998; 8: 195-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (2854) Google Scholar). ORFs were predicted by ORF finder (NCBI) and searched against the GenBankTM non-redundant protein data base using the program BLASTP (22.Altschul S.F. Gish W. Miller W. Myers E.W. Lipman D.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 215: 403-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (71449) Google Scholar). tRNAs and rRNAs were located using tRNAscan-S.E. v.1.11 program (24.Lowe T.M. Eddy S.R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 955-964Crossref PubMed Scopus (8311) Google Scholar) and BLASTN, respectively (22.Altschul S.F. Gish W. Miller W. Myers E.W. Lipman D.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 215: 403-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (71449) Google Scholar). Inserts were amplified by PCR in a 96-well format using M13 reverse and M13 (−20) primers (Stratagene). PCR products were then purified in a 96-well filtration plate using the Millipore MultiScreen Assay System. Each PCR product was verified by agarose gel electrophoresis and was considered correct if the amplified product resulted in a single band. These DNAs were spotted on glass slides and hybridized with fluorescently labeled cDNA prepared by reverse transcription in the presence of Cy3 or Cy5-labeled deoxyuridine triphosphate (Glass fluorescent kit; CLONTECH). cDNA prepared from cells harvested at 83 mm glucose was labeled with Cy3 (reference sample), and those prepared at each later time were labeled with the Cy5 fluor. Hybridization, image analysis, and integration were performed with a GeneTac hybridization station, GeneTac biochip analyzer, and GeneTac integrator 3.0.1 (Genomic Solutions, www.genomicsolutions.com) A unidirectional cDNA library was constructed from mycelia of T. reesei, grown on glycerol as the sole carbon source as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The library was named TrEST-A, and we randomly selected 4320 clones for sequencing. PCR analysis of 96 individual clones revealed that 99% produced an amplification product with an average size of 1.2 kb. We obtained 2835 ESTs with a minimum length of 150 bases and a Phred quality value of at least 20. Of the 2835 ESTs, 808 sequences remained as singletons, and 2027 sequences formed 343 clusters. Therefore, this analysis shows that we obtained the partial sequences of 1151 expressed genes of T. reesei. The clusters ranged in size from 2 (177 clusters) to 90 (1 cluster) sequences. Using BLASTX (22.Altschul S.F. Gish W. Miller W. Myers E.W. Lipman D.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 215: 403-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (71449) Google Scholar) and a stringency score ≥80, the total number of ESTs that could be assigned a cellular role on the basis of sequence similarity to proteins with known function was 348. The remaining ESTs are either unclassified (52 sequences), show similarity to sequences of unknown function (19 sequences), or have no significant similarity to any protein sequences in the data bases (no matches, 732 sequences). Those ESTs that encode putative protein sequences that show similarity to products in the NCBI non-redundant data base were classified into functional groups (Fig. 1). The functional groups presented in Fig. 1 are principally based on the classification developed at the Institute for Genomic Research (TIGR, Rockville, MD; available at www.tigr.org/docs/tiger-scripts/ egad_scripts/role_report.spl) (25.White O. Kerlavage A.R. Methods Enzymol. 1996; 266: 27-40Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The complete list of ESTs classified into functional groups is available through the Internet (trichoderma.iq.usp.br/TrEST.html). Most of the known transcripts belong to groups related to housekeeping genes such as those involved in metabolism (14%), protein synthesis (9%), and RNA synthesis (2%). The high percentage of the ESTs that showed no hits (61%) most probably reflect the absence in the data base of a completely sequenced genome related to filamentous fungi. In fact the data base contains just 98 sequences from T. reesei. Therefore, our data represent an increase of more than 10-fold in the number of T. reesei expressed genes in the data base. Homology searches using the sequenced cDNAs against the GenBankTM data base revealed that sufficient coverage had been achieved to allow a comprehensive study of the gene expression profile during glucose exhaustion. Using complementary DNA microarray technology we analyzed the expression of the available set of T. reesei genes after attachment to glass slides. We compared transcript populations from cells harvested when glucose reached 83 mm to those expressed at various times as the glucose level declined (Fig. 2). Fluorescently labeled cDNA was prepared from mRNA isolated from cells at 83 mm glucose in the presence of Cy3 (green)-labeled dUTP and from mRNA obtained at 46, 11, 1, and 0 mm glucose in the presence of Cy5 (red)-labeled dUTP. The labeled cDNAs were mixed and hybridized, in duplicate, to the microarrays. The first striking finding was that many genes coding for enzymes of the tricarboxylic acid cycle were not repressed in glucose-rich medium, and those that were, citrate synthase and α-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase, were only partially repressed. We identified 14 genes that are expressed at ≥2-fold higher levels as glucose is depleted from the growth medium (Fig. 3). An overall view of the changes in the expression of genes involved in the metabolic pathways controlling the utilization of glucose in T. reesei is shown in Fig. 4. For purposes of comparison we also present the same portions of the metabolic pathways of S. cerevisiae as reported previously by DeRisi et al. (6.DeRisi J.L. Iyer V.R. Brown P.O. Science. 1997; 278: 680-686Crossref PubMed Scopus (3707) Google Scholar).Figure 4Comparison of the expression profiles of genes for enzymes that participate in key metabolic processes involved in the utilization of metabolites during glucose exhaustion in T. reesei and S. cerevisiae. To facilitate comparison between the two microorganisms we present the same portions of the metabolic pathways of S. cerevisiae, and the behavior of genes encoding the enzymes that catalyze each step as presented by DeRisi et al. (6.DeRisi J.L. Iyer V.R. Brown P.O. Science. 1997; 278: 680-686Crossref PubMed Scopus (3707) Google Scholar). Red andgreen boxes represent those genes whose expression increases and decreases, respectively, upon glucose exhaustion. White boxes indicate those genes that are unaffected. Yellow boxes represent genes that have yet been not isolated fromT. reesei. The ADH gene has not been isolated; however, activities of alcohol dehydrogenase in both directions were detected and measured in T. reesei extracts (33.Beutler H.O. Bergmeyer H.U. Methods of Enzymatic Analysis. 3rd Ed. 4. Verlag Chemie, Deerfield Beach, FL1984: 598-606Google Scholar).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The abundances of transcripts encoding enzymes of the glycolytic pathway in T. reesei were either unaffected or, in some cases, decreased slightly upon glucose exhaustion. The gene encoding enolase, however, is highly expressed in the presence of glucose-rich medium and is markedly repressed on depletion of the sugar. Thus, as inS. cerevisiae, up-regulation of the glycolytic transcripts in the presence of glucose will increase the flow of metabolites through the glycolytic pathway to yield pyruvate. The flow of metabolites in this direction is facilitated by the fact that two enzymes involved in the first steps of the pentose phosphate pathway, glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase and 6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase, are expressed only at relatively low levels in the presence of glucose (Fig. 3). However, a striking difference between the two microorganisms concerns the fate of pyruvate, as is evident from the pattern of expression of the transcripts of the genes for tricarboxylic acid cycle enzymes seen upon depletion of glucose. Whereas high concentrations of glucose strongly repress genes encoding enzymes of the tricarboxylic acid cycle cycle in S. cerevisiae, the corresponding transcripts inT. reesei behave quite differently. We have identified the genes for 5 of the 8 successive reaction steps in the tricarboxylic acid cycle. Glucose partially represses expression of the genes for citrate synthase and α-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase, whereas those for isocitrate dehydrogenase, succinate dehydrogenase, and malate dehydrogenase are unaffected (Fig. 4). If expression of these enzymes are controlled mainly at the transcriptional level, then pyruvate will be oxidized because of the higher level of expression of the tricarboxylic acid cycle mRNAs when glucose concentration is high. In contrast, in S. cerevisiae, pyruvate is channeled to acetaldehyde under these conditions, as a result of the strong repression of transcription of the genes for enzymes of the tricarboxylic acid cycle by glucose. A second difference between the two species concerns the fate of the acetaldehyde formed by the decarboxylation of pyruvate by pyruvate decarboxylase, which is up-regulated in both microorganisms in the presence of glucose. In S. cerevisiae, the acetaldehyde formed is reduced to ethanol by NADH in a reaction catalyzed by alcohol dehydrogenase and is not converted to acetate due to the strong repression of aldehyde dehydrogenase by glucose. This step is essential for anaerobic metabolism because it generates the NAD+ that is required for glycolysis to continue. In T. reesei we have identified two paralogous genes for aldehyde dehydrogenase, the ALD2 transcript is strongly repressed by glucose, but ALD1 is not affected. If both enzymes have comparable specificity, then acetaldehyde will be converted to acetate in T. reesei even in the presence of glucose. To address this question, we measured the concentration of ethanol and acetate after the addition of a high concentration of glucose to T. reesei culture grown in the presence of glycerol. The results show that, in contrast to S. cerevisiae, ethanol concentration did not change, whereas the concentration of acetate increased upon the addition of glucose (Fig. 5). This result indicates that, although one of the two paralogous genes for aldehyde dehydrogenase is repressed by glucose, acetate will be produced in the presence of a high concentration of glucose. Upon exhaustion of glucose, the activation of the gene encoding acetyl-coenzyme A synthase will allow the entry of acetate, produced via the pyruvate bypass route, to replenish the tricarboxylic acid cycle. Under these conditions, the genes encoding phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase will also be activated, allowing the tricarboxylic acid cycle intermediates to flow via oxalacetate to fuel the gluconeogenic pathway (Fig. 4). We validated the expression of selected genes involved in the metabolic pathways controlling the utilization of glucose by Northern analysis. The results are presented in Fig. 6 and were found to be in agreement with the results obtained from the microarrays. Aerobic metabolism requires the expression of proteins involved in mitochondrial activity and the flow of electrons and protons through the complex of respiratory chain proteins that are encoded by mitochondrial and nuclear genes. Therefore, to determine whether transcripts encoded by the mitochondrial genome of T. reesei are subject to strong repression by glucose, as in S. cerevisiae, the complete sequence of the mitochondrial genome of the filamentous fungus was determined. The 42,130-bp circular mitochondrial DNA encodes 15 polypeptides, 2 rRNAs, and 25 tRNAs, all of which are transcribed from the same DNA strand (Fig. 7A). We have measured the abundance of several RNAs transcribed from different parts of the mitochondrial genome. The probes used are indicated in Fig. 7A and included three synthetic oligonucleotides complementary to gene sequences for cytochromec oxidase polypeptide III (COX III) and for subunits 2 and 5 of NADH ubiquinone oxidoreductase (ND2, ND5). The transcripts are abundant in the presence of glucose (Fig. 7B), and levels increase only slightly upon glucose depletion, indicating that glucose-rich medium does not strongly repress mitochondrial gene expression in T. reesei, unlike the case in S. cerevisiae (26.Ulery T.L. Jang S.H. Jaehning J.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 1160-1170Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar, 27.Costanzo M.C. Fox T.D. Annu. Rev. Genet. 1990; 24: 91-113Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We were also interested in determining whether the transcripts of the nuclear genes encoding the mitochondrial polypeptides V and VI of cytochrome c oxidase (COX V and COX VI), which are also repressed strongly by glucose in S. cerevisiae, would respond to glucose similarly to the transcripts of the mitochondrially encoded genes. The results presented in Fig. 7C show that, indeed, the COX V and VI transcripts are expressed at a level comparable to the mitochondrially encoded COX III, ND2, and ND5 RNAs (Fig. 7, B and C). Together, these data indicate that, in contrast to the case in S. cerevisiae, respiration in T. reesei is repressed only partially, if at all, in the presence of high concentrations of glucose. In other words, T. reesei will respire in the presence of glucose-rich medium, whereas the respiratory pathway inS. cerevisiae is repressed under the same metabolic conditions. The transcript profiles of T. reesei during glucose exhaustion presented in this report provide a description of the molecular basis of the shunting of the end product of the glycolytic pathway, pyruvate, into aerobic rather than anaerobic metabolism. They have obvious implications for the long standing question of why some eukaryotic microorganisms, such as T. reesei, utilize glucose by aerobic metabolism. First, in the presence of glucose-rich medium, the expression of the genes encoding the enzymes of the tricarboxylic acid cycle will allow the available pyruvate to fuel the tricarboxylic acid cycle. In addition, pyruvate can be converted to acetaldehyde and then to acetate via the pyruvate bypass route. Furthermore, the conversion of acetaldehyde to acetate and not to ethanol as in S. cerevisiae precludes the generation of the NAD+ required for anaerobic metabolism. Second, analysis of the expression of several mitochondrial and nuclear gene-encoding proteins involved in mitochondrial respiration confirms that T. reesei is able to carry out respiration in glucose-rich medium. Regulation of gene transcription by glucose in S. cerevisiaeand T. reesei therefore differs with respect to critical genes, the products of which control the direction of the flow of metabolites. Although the expression of genes involved in the tricarboxylic acid cycle and in mitochondrial respiration is repressed strongly in S. cerevisiae in the presence of glucose, inT. reesei these genes remain active under these conditions. Thus, aerobic metabolism will prevail in T. reesei in the presence of glucose-rich medium. The gene expression profile described for T. reesei in this work is most probably also used by other multicellular microorganisms to obtain energy by respiration, rather than fermentation, in the presence of high levels of glucose. The fact that, in Aspergillus nidulans, the cytochromec gene (cycA) is also not repressed by glucose (28.Raitt D.C. Bradshaw R.E. Pillar T.M. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1994; 242: 17-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar) supports this contention. In S. cerevisiae and Kluyveromyces lactis, the main regulatory effect of glucose occurs at the transcriptional level (8.Zeeman A.M. Kuyper M. Pronk J.T. van Dijken J.P. Steensma H.Y. Yeast. 2000; 16: 611-620Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 29.Gancedo J.M. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 1998; 62: 334-361Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This also seems to be the case in T. reesei because the primary effect is on the level of mRNA of critical steps directing the flow of metabolites to aerobic rather than anaerobic metabolism, corresponding well with the fact that T. reeseiis a preferentially respiratory micoorganism. Future analysis of metabolic flux using 13C should be of great value to accompany the metabolic gene expression studies reported in our work. Metabolic engineering of eukaryotic cells for the production of useful compounds represents a formidable challenge. However, the power of this approach is evident from the recent report that an obligate photosynthetic microalga can be converted into a heterotrophic organism by introducing a human gene that encodes a glucose transporter (30.Zaslavskaia L.A. Lippmeier J.C. Shih C. Ehrhardt D. Grossman A.R. Apt K.E. Science. 2001; 292: 2073-2075Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar).T. reesei is capable of hydrolyzing cellulose to glucose (11.Beguin P. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 1990; 44: 219-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (410) Google Scholar). The gene expression profile described in this report provides valuable information for the metabolic engineering necessary to turn this preferentially respiratory microorganism into a fermenter, a step that will be required if T. reesei is to be used for the efficient production of ethanol fuel from cellulose biomass. Finally, it is believed that multicellular organisms capable of respiration arose from unicellular fermenters early in the course of evolution, after the concentration of oxygen in the atmosphere began to rise and following the engulfment of aerobic bacteria that evolved into mitochondria (31.Margulis L. Symbiosis in Cell Evolution. Freeman, San Francisco1981Google Scholar). It is not surprising, therefore, that the molecular alterations in response to glucose, which determined the switch from fermentation to respiration, are observed in both nuclear and mitochondrial genes coding for mitochondrial enzymes and proteins. Because effectors specific for glucose repression are conserved in yeast and filamentous fungi (32.Ronne H. Trends Genet. 1995; 11: 12-17Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (382) Google Scholar), the crucial alterations most probably occurred in the target sequences for the glucose repressor in the promoters of the relevant genes, which prevented the binding of repressor.

We fractionated the Golgi apparatus in vivo using the drug brefeldin A or a dominant-negative mutant of the Sar1p protein. After these treatments, Golgi enzymes moved back to the endoplasmic reticulum, leaving behind a matrix of Golgi structural proteins. Under these conditions, cells still entered and exited mitosis normally, and their Golgi matrix partitioned in a manner very similar to that of the complete organelle. Thus, the matrix may be the partitioning unit of the Golgi apparatus and may carry the Golgi enzyme-containing membranes into the daughter cells."
https://openalex.org/W1995052645,"Abstract Previously we have shown that two members of the newly named SIBLING (smallintegrin-binding ligand, N -linked glycoproteins) family of proteins, bone sialoprotein, and osteopontin, bound first to a cell surface receptor and then to complement Factor H thereby blocking the lytic activity of the alternative pathway of complement. Another member of this family, dentin matrix protein 1, is shown in this paper to be very similar to osteopontin in that it can bind strongly to Factor H (K a ∼ 1 nm) and block the lytic activity through either the vitronectin receptor (αVβ3 integrin) or CD44. Binding of Factor H to SIBLING localized to the cells surface was demonstrated by fluorescence-activated cell sorting. Extensive overlapping fragment analyses suggests that both dentin matrix protein 1 and osteopontin interact with cell surface CD44 through their amino termini. Similar fragments of bone sialoprotein, like the intact protein, did not functionally interact with CD44. All three proteins are shown to act in conjunction with Factor I, a serum protease that, when complexed to appropriate cofactors, stops the lytic pathway by digesting the bound C3b in a series of proteolytic steps. These results show that at least three members of this family confer membrane cofactor protein-like activity (MCP or CD46) upon cells expressing RGD-binding integrins or CD44. The required order of the assembly of the complex suggests that this cofactor activity is limited to short diffusional distances."

A reassembly of the [2Fe-2S] cluster in the ferredoxin dinitrosyl iron complex does not require any addition of iron or other protein components. Furthermore, a complete removal of the dinitrosyl iron complex from ferredoxin prevents reassembly of the [2Fe-2S] cluster in the protein. The results suggest that cysteine desulfurase (IscS) together withl-cysteine can efficiently repair the nitric oxide-modified ferredoxin [2Fe-2S] cluster and that the iron center in the dinitrosyl iron complex may be recycled for the reassembly of iron-sulfur clusters in proteins.

Their pervasive occurrence and multiplicity of function are comparable to other biological prosthetic groups such as hemes and flavins (1.Beinert H. Holm R.H. Munck E.

Although the protein dinitrosyl iron complexes are stable in vitro, they are efficiently repaired in aerobically growing E. coli cells even in the presence of the protein synthesis inhibitor chloramphenicol (10.Rogers P.A.

Chem. 1993; 268: 25547-25552Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) that proteins with modified iron-sulfur clusters are not degraded; rather the modified iron-sulfur clusters are repaired in E. coli cells. Surprisingly, when intact E. coli cells are disrupted, the protein dinitrosyl iron complexes become very stable (10.Rogers P.A. Ding H. J. Biol.

We proposed that repair of the protein dinitrosyl iron complexes requires cellular reducing equivalents, which are oxidized and diluted when intact E. coli cells are disrupted. In a search for such reducing equivalents, we found thatl-cysteine, but not N-acetyl-l-cysteine or reduced glutathione, can effectively decompose the protein dinitrosyl iron complexes in the cell extracts prepared from the E. coli cells treated with nitric oxide (10.Rogers P.A. Ding H. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 30980-30986Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Furthermore, l-cysteine is equally effective in decomposing the purified protein dinitrosyl iron complexes, implying that other cellular components are not needed for the reaction (10.Rogers P.A. Ding H. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 30980-30986Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, the mechanism for the l-cysteine-mediated decomposition of the protein dinitrosyl iron complexes is not fully understood. One hypothesis we postulated is that l-cysteine removes the nitric oxide moieties from the dinitrosyl iron complexes, leaving an unstable iron center transiently associated with the proteins. Such an intermediate may be recycled for the reassembly of new iron-sulfur clusters if sulfide is provided in a timely manner. In this report, we used the E. coli ferredoxin [2Fe-2S] cluster (16.Ta D.T. Vickery L.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 11120-11125Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) as an example and found that the nitric oxide-modified ferredoxin dinitrosyl iron complex can be directly converted back to the ferredoxin [2Fe-2S] cluster by cysteine desulfurase (IscS)1 andl-cysteine in vitro. IscS (17.Zheng L. White R.H. Cash V.L. Dean D.R. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 4714-4720Crossref PubMed Scopus (358) Google Scholar, 18.Flint D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 16068-16074Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar) is a key member of the iron-sulfur cluster assembly machinery encoded by the operon iscSUA-hscBA-fdx in E. coli (19.Zheng L. Cash V.L. Flint D.H. Dean D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 13264-13272Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (576) Google Scholar, 20.Takahashi Y. Nakamura M. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1999; 126: 917-926Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar, 21.Tokumoto U. Takahashi Y. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 2001; 130: 63-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). The physiological function of IscS and the entire operon iscSUA-hscBA-fdx of E. coli in repairing the nitric oxide-modified iron-sulfur proteins will be discussed. The coding region of the E. coli IscS protein was amplified from wild-type E. coligenomic DNA by PCR using PCR ready-to-go beads (Amersham Biosciences). Two primers were designed to contain a NcoI restriction site in one primer and a HindIII site in the other. The sequences of the primers are: IscS-l, 5′-GCATTGAGCCATGGACGGAGTTTA-3′; and IscS-2, 5′-CCGATTAAAGCTTAGCCCATTCGA-3′. The NcoI/HindIII-digested PCR product was purified and ligated to the expression vector pET28b+ (Stratagene) to yield pTISCS containing a six-histidine tag attached to the C terminus of the IscS polypeptide. The plasmid pTISCS was introduced into E. coli BL-21 (DE3) cells (Stratagene). An overnight E. coli culture containing the pTISCS plasmid was diluted 100-fold into 1000 ml of fresh Luria-Bertani medium. After 3 h of incubation in a 37 °C incubator with aeration (250 rpm), isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside (200 μm) was added to the culture, and incubation continued for 2 h to induce the expression of the IscS protein. The E. coli cells containing overproduced IscS protein were harvested and resuspended into 30 ml of prechilled buffer A (5 mmimidazole, 500 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris, pH 8.0). Cells were disrupted by passing them through a French press once and then centrifuged at 20,000 × g for 45 min to remove cell debris. The supernatants were applied to a Superflow Ni-agarose column (2 ml) (Qiagen) attached to a ÄKTA-fast protein liquid chromatography system (Amersham Biosciences). The column was washed with 3 column volumes of buffer A and 3 column volumes of buffer B (15 mm imidazole, 500 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris, pH 8.0). The IscS protein was then eluted with buffer C (300 mm imidazole, 500 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris, pH 8.0). The eluted protein was applied to a Hitrap-desalting column (5.0 ml) (Amersham Biosciences) equilibrated with buffer D (500 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris, pH 8.0) to remove imidazole from protein samples. The fast protein liquid chromatography system was controlled by UNICORN software (Amersham Biosciences) that allows a reproducible protein purification profile. The protein concentration was determined with the Bradford protein assay kit (Bio-Rad) using bovine serum albumin as a standard. An equivalent amount of pyridoxal phosphate was added to the purified IscS protein. The purity of purified IscS protein was greater than 95% judging from its electrophoresis on a 15% polyacrylamide gel containing SDS followed by staining with Coomassie Blue. The E. coli cells containing overproduced His-tagged ferredoxin protein (10.Rogers P.A. Ding H. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 30980-30986Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar) were treated with nitric oxide-saturated solution. Nitric oxide-saturated solution was prepared by bubbling pure nitric oxide gas (MG Industries, Malvern, PA), which had been passed first through a soda lime column (4–8 mesh) to remove other nitrogen oxides and then through previously degassed water for 15 min (10.Rogers P.A. Ding H. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 30980-30986Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). The concentration of nitric oxide in nitric oxide-saturated solution is ∼2 mm at room temperature (22.Nunoshiba T. deRojas-Walker T. Wishnok J.S. Tannenbaum S.R. Demple B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 9993-9997Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar). The final concentration of nitric oxide in the E. coli culture was ∼10 μm. After the nitric oxide treatment, the E. coli cells were immediately harvested by centrifugation, and the ferredoxin protein was purified following the procedure previously described (10.Rogers P.A. Ding H. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 30980-30986Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). The purified ferredoxin was then loaded onto a gel filtration column (Superdex-200) attached to a ÄKTA-fast protein liquid chromatography system to separate the ferredoxin [2Fe-2S] cluster from the ferredoxin dinitrosyl iron complex inside a 4 °C refrigerator. The ferredoxin dinitrosyl iron complex was mixed with the purified IscS in a 1.0-ml solution containing 500 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 4 mm dithiothreitol under aerobic conditions. The mixture was incubated at 37 °C for 5 min before l-cysteine was added. The formation of the ferredoxin [2Fe-2S] cluster in the reaction solution was monitored by taking UV-visible absorption spectra in a Beckman DU640 UV-visible spectrometer equipped with a Peltier temperature controller. The concentration of the ferredoxin [2Fe-2S] cluster was estimated using an extinction coefficient of 11 mm−1 cm−1 at 415 nm (16.Ta D.T. Vickery L.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 11120-11125Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). X-band EPR spectra were recorded using a Bruker model ESP-300 EPR spectrometer equipped with an Oxford Instruments 910 continuous flow cryostat. Routine EPR measurement conditions were as follows: microwave frequency, 9.50 GHz; microwave power, 1.0 milliwatt; modulation frequency, 100 kHz; modulation amplitude, 1.2 millitesla; sample temperature, 20 K; and receive gain, 105. The spin quantification of the EPR signals was carried out as described previously (14.Ding H. Demple B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 5146-5150Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar). When the E. coli cells containing overproduced ferredoxin protein were treated with a single dose of nitric oxide gas at a final concentration of 10 μm anaerobically, up to 40% overproduced ferredoxin [2Fe-2S] clusters in cells were modified forming the ferredoxin dinitrosyl iron complex (10.Rogers P.A. Ding H. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 30980-30986Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). In an attempt to separate the ferredoxin dinitrosyl iron complex from the ferredoxin [2Fe-2S] cluster, the isolated ferredoxin protein was loaded onto a gel filtration column. The gel filtration elution profile of the ferredoxin protein had two major peaks, fractions 29 and 31 (Fig. 1A). The SDS-polyacrylamide electrophoresis gel analysis showed that both fractions 29 and 31 have a single ferredoxin polypeptide band (data not shown). The UV-visible absorption measurements revealed that fraction 31 has a typical UV-visible spectrum of the ferredoxin [2Fe-2S] cluster with two absorption peaks at 415 and 459 nm (16.Ta D.T. Vickery L.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 11120-11125Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), whereas fraction 29 does not have any noticeable features in the same region (Fig. 1B). The EPR measurements showed that fraction 29 but not fraction 31 has an EPR signal at gav = 2.04 (Fig. 1C), a characteristic of the protein dinitrosyl iron complex (4.Drapier J.C. Methods. 1997; 11: 319-329Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar, 5.Foster M.W. Cowan J.A. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1999; 121: 4093-4100Crossref Scopus (128) Google Scholar, 6.Kennedy M.C. Antholine W.E. Beinert H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 20340-20347Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar, 10.Rogers P.A. Ding H. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 30980-30986Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Spin quantification of the EPR signal at gav = 2.04 in fraction 29 could only account for ∼1.5 μm ferredoxin dinitrosyl iron complex in a total of 5.0 μm ferredoxin protein. This amount of the ferredoxin dinitrosyl iron complex in fraction 29 could be an underestimate, because the EPR signal at gav = 2.04 only reflects the iron center in the d7 state and the iron center in the complexes may exist in the d6 or d8 EPR silent state (4.Drapier J.C. Methods. 1997; 11: 319-329Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar, 5.Foster M.W. Cowan J.A. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1999; 121: 4093-4100Crossref Scopus (128) Google Scholar, 6.Kennedy M.C. Antholine W.E. Beinert H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 20340-20347Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). As modifications of the ferredoxin [2Fe-2S] cluster by nitric oxide have not been fully characterized, it is also probable that fraction 29 contained ferredoxin protein with other nitric oxide-modified iron-sulfur clusters that could not be detected with EPR. Nevertheless, the result clearly showed that fraction 29 contains at least 1.5 μmferredoxin dinitrosyl iron complex and no ferredoxin [2Fe-2S] cluster. Previous studies (10.Rogers P.A. Ding H. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 30980-30986Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar) revealed thatl-cysteine could efficiently decompose the purified protein dinitrosyl iron complex and release the ferrous iron from the complex. Other related biological thiols including N-acetyl-l-cysteine and glutathione were much less effective. Kinetics characterization showed that the protein dinitrosyl iron complex was completely decomposed byl-cysteine at ∼20 min, whereas the ferrous iron release continued up to 45 min, suggesting that iron release from the protein dinitrosyl iron complex is delayed (10.Rogers P.A. Ding H. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 30980-30986Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). We proposed that there is an intermediate in which the nitric oxide moieties are removed byl-cysteine, leaving an unstable iron center associated with the protein (10.Rogers P.A. Ding H. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 30980-30986Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Such an intermediate may be recycled for reassembly of the iron-sulfur clusters in proteins if sulfide is provided. To test this model, we prepared recombinant IscS, a NifS homolog that produces sulfide from l-cysteine (17.Zheng L. White R.H. Cash V.L. Dean D.R. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 4714-4720Crossref PubMed Scopus (358) Google Scholar, 18.Flint D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 16068-16074Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). IscS protein was purified from E. coli as described under “Experimental Procedures.” When fraction 29, which contains the ferredoxin dinitrosyl iron complex, was incubated with l-cysteine and the purified IscS at 37 °C for 20 min, a typical UV-visible absorption spectrum of the ferredoxin [2Fe-2S] cluster with two peaks at 415 and 459 nm appeared (Fig. 2,trace d). Compared with the spectrum of pure ferredoxin [2Fe-2S] cluster (trace e), approximately 1.4 μm ferredoxin [2Fe-2S] cluster was formed in fraction 29 after incubation with IscS and l-cysteine. Both IscS andl-cysteine are needed for reassembly of the [2Fe-2S] cluster in the ferredoxin dinitrosyl iron complex, because no ferredoxin [2Fe-2S] cluster was formed without l-cysteine (trace b) or IscS (trace c). Interestingly, the reassembly of the [2Fe-2S] cluster in fraction 29 does not require any addition of iron, indicating that the iron in the ferredoxin dinitrosyl iron complex may be recycled for the formation of the ferredoxin [2Fe-2S] cluster. The EPR measurements showed that the EPR signal at gav = 2.04 of the ferredoxin dinitrosyl iron complex in fraction 29 (Fig. 1C) was completely eliminated after incubation withl-cysteine or l-cysteine and IscS. However, without l-cysteine, the EPR signal of the ferredoxin dinitrosyl iron complex was unchanged by incubation with IscS alone. The addition of sodium sulfide (up to 100 μm) did not change the EPR signal of the ferredoxin dinitrosyl iron complex either (data not shown). These results further support a notion thatl-cysteine has a unique activity in decomposing the protein dinitrosyl iron complex (10.Rogers P.A. Ding H. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 30980-30986Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, l-cysteine could only decompose the dinitrosyl iron complex in protein. To reassemble the [2Fe-2S] cluster in the ferredoxin dinitrosyl iron complex, both l-cysteine and IscS are required (Fig. 2). When the repaired ferredoxin sample was reduced with freshly prepared sodium dithionite at a final concentration of 2 mm, a typical rhombic EPR signal of the reduced ferredoxin [2Fe-2S] cluster (16.Ta D.T. Vickery L.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 11120-11125Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) was observed. Integration of the EPR signal of the reduced ferredoxin [2Fe-2S] cluster showed that ∼1.8 μmferredoxin [2Fe-2S] cluster was reassembled by IscS andl-cysteine, consistent with the number calculated from the UV-visible spectrum (Fig. 2) within the experimental error. The amount of reassembled ferredoxin [2Fe-2S] cluster is also close to that of the original ferredoxin dinitrosyl iron complex estimated from the EPR signal at gav = 2.04 in fraction 29, suggesting that IscS and l-cysteine convert all of the ferredoxin dinitrosyl iron complex to the ferredoxin [2Fe-2S] cluster in fraction 29. The reassembly kinetics of the [2Fe-2S] cluster in the ferredoxin dinitrosyl iron complex was further characterized by taking the UV-visible absorption spectra of the samples every 5 min afterl-cysteine, or IscS was added to the reaction solution. The relative amounts of the ferredoxin [2Fe-2S] cluster in the sample were calculated from the absorption change at 415 nm, a maximum peak of the ferredoxin [2Fe-2S] cluster (16.Ta D.T. Vickery L.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 11120-11125Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 3, a reassembly of the ferredoxin [2Fe-2S] cluster was nearly complete after the ferredoxin dinitrosyl iron complex was incubated with IscS (1 μm) andl-cysteine (1 mm) at 37 °C for ∼10 min. At a fixed concentration of IscS (1 μm), the recovery of the ferredoxin [2Fe-2S] cluster was not very sensitive to thel-cysteine concentrations ranging from 50 μmto 1 mm (Fig. 3A). On the other hand, at a fixed concentration of l-cysteine (1 mm), the reassembly rate and yield of the ferredoxin [2Fe-2S] cluster were highly dependent on the IscS concentrations (Fig. 3B). The repaired ferredoxin sample was also subjected to the gel filtration analysis. When the ferredoxin sample incubated with IscS andl-cysteine was loaded onto the gel filtration column, a new peak at fraction 31 appeared (Fig. 4) that was identical to that of the ferredoxin [2Fe-2S] cluster fraction (Fig. 1A). Integration analysis of the gel filtration profiles indicated that approximately 2 μmferredoxin protein in fraction 29 was converted to fraction 31. Thus, IscS and l-cysteine not only reassembled the [2Fe-2S] cluster in the ferredoxin dinitrosyl iron complex but also changed the ferredoxin protein conformation. The observation that reassembly of the [2Fe-2S] cluster in the ferredoxin dinitrosyl iron complex does not require any additional iron (Fig. 2) suggested that the iron center in the dinitrosyl iron complex may be recycled for formation of the [2Fe-2S] cluster in ferredoxin. To examine whether the dinitrosyl iron complex in ferredoxin is converted to the ferredoxin [2Fe-2S] cluster, we prepared a ferredoxin sample in which the dinitrosyl iron complex was removed. Fraction 29 containing the ferredoxin dinitrosyl iron complex was first incubated with l-cysteine (1 mm) and an iron chelator EDTA (1 mm) at 37 °C for 1 h to completely decompose the dinitrosyl iron complex (10.Rogers P.A. Ding H. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 30980-30986Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). In a control, fraction 29 was incubated with EDTA (1 mm) only. After incubation, both samples were passed through a Hitrap-desalting column to remove EDTA,l-cysteine, and other small molecules. The EPR measurements confirmed that incubation with both l-cysteine and EDTA removed the dinitrosyl iron complex from ferredoxin, whereas incubation with EDTA only did not have any effect on the EPR signal at gav = 2.04 of the ferredoxin dinitrosyl iron complex (data not shown). Both protein samples were then incubated with IscS andl-cysteine at 37 °C for 20 min. As shown in Fig. 5, the ferredoxin [2Fe-2S] cluster appeared in the ferredoxin sample pretreated with EDTA alone (trace d). In contrast, no [2Fe-2S] cluster was detected in the ferredoxin sample in which the dinitrosyl iron complex was completely removed by the pretreatment of both l-cysteine and EDTA (trace c). In activated macrophages, an excessive amount of nitric oxide is produced as a powerful weapon that kills pathogenic bacteria and tumor cells (23.MacMicking J. Xie Q.W. Nathan C. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1997; 15: 323-350Crossref PubMed Scopus (3501) Google Scholar). The specific cellular targets of the nitric oxide cytotoxicity have not been fully understood. Early EPR measurements indicated that iron-sulfur proteins are among those that are particularly sensitive to nitric oxide, as the EPR signal at gav = 2.04 representing the protein dinitrosyl iron complexes is readily observed in activated macrophages (7.Henry Y.

Biol. 1999; 3: 152-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). Many if not all iron-sulfur proteins will be modified forming the protein dinitrosyl iron complexes when organisms are exposed to nitric oxide. If cells are to survive, modified iron-sulfur proteins must be efficiently repaired. We show here that IscS together with l-cysteine can directly convert the ferredoxin dinitrosyl iron complex to the ferredoxin [2Fe-2S] cluster in vitro (Fig. 2) and that reassembly of the [2Fe-2S] cluster in the ferredoxin dinitrosyl iron complex does not require any addition of iron. Furthermore, the removal of the dinitrosyl iron complex from ferredoxin protein prevents reassembly of the [2Fe-2S] cluster in the protein (Fig. 5), suggesting that the iron center in the dinitrosyl iron complex may be recycled for reassembly of the ferredoxin [2Fe-2S] cluster. IscS (17.Zheng L. White R.H. Cash V.L. Dean D.R. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 4714-4720Crossref PubMed Scopus (358) Google Scholar, 18.Flint D.H. J. Biol.

The results in this study demonstrated that IscS together with l-cysteine is sufficient for repairing the nitric oxide-modified ferredoxin [2Fe-2S] cluster. However, the possibility cannot be ruled out that additional products from the operon iscSUA-hscBA-fdx are required for repairing the damaged iron-sulfur proteins. For example, some iron may be released from proteins when the iron-sulfur clusters are modified by reactive free radicals (33.Keyer K. Imlay J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 13635-13640Crossref PubMed Scopus (695) Google Scholar). In such cases, additional iron, which may be delivered by the products of the operon iscSUA-hscBA-fdx (19.Zheng L. Cash V.L.

Indeed, when exogenous ferrous iron (50 μm) was added in fraction 29 in the presence of IscS andl-cysteine, the amount of the reassembled ferredoxin [2Fe-2S] cluster was dramatically increased (data not shown), indicating that the repair of some nitric oxide-modified ferredoxin [2Fe-2S] clusters requires additional iron. As a member of the operon iscSUA-hscBA-fdx, ferredoxin itself could have a critical role in assembly (34.Lange H. Kaut A. Kispal G. Lill R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

It is conceivable that assembly and repair of iron-sulfur clusters in proteins is a highly concerted process. The yeast homologs of IscS (35.Li J. Kogan M. Knight S.A. Pain D. Dancis A. J. Biol.

All of these homologs are localized within mitochondria, suggesting that mitochondria are the primary site for the assembly of iron-sulfur clusters in eukaryotic cells and that matured iron-sulfur clusters are presumably transported to their destinations through the ABC transporter Atm1p (40.Lill R. Kispal G. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2000; 25: 352-356Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar, 41.Muhlenhoff U. Lill R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1459: 370-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). Recently, some homologs of the operon iscSUA-hscBA-fdx have also been found in the cytoplasm (42.Tong W.H. Rouault T. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 5692-5700Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar, 43.Land T. Rouault T.A. Mol. Cell. 1998; 2: 807-815Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar) and in the nucleus (44.Nakai Y. Nakai M. Hayashi H. Kagamiyama H. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 8314-8320Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). For example, the nuclear localization of the IscS homolog (Nfs1p) in yeast cells seems to be critical for the cell growth (44.Nakai Y. Nakai M. Hayashi H. Kagamiyama H. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 8314-8320Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). If mitochondria are the center for the biogenesis of iron-sulfur proteins, the presence of the homologs of the operon iscSUA-hscBA-fdx in the cytoplasm and in the nucleus seems to be unnecessary. However, there are a number of iron-sulfur proteins in the cytoplasm (e.g. cytosolic aconitase (13.Oliveira L. Bouton C. Drapier J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 516-521Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 24.Rouault T. Klausner R. Curr. Top. Cell. Regul. 1997; 35: 1-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar)) and in the nucleus (e.g. endonuclease III (26.Aspinwall R. Rothwell D.G. Roldan-Arjona T. Anselmino C. Ward C.J. Cheadle J.P. Sampson J.R. Lindahl T. Harris P.C. Hickson I.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 109-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar)) that are the potential targets of reactive free radicals. Perhaps, the homologs of the operon iscSUA-hscBA-fdx in the cytoplasm and in the nucleus are responsible for efficiently repairing the modified iron-sulfur proteins when cells are exposed to reactive free radicals. Based on the results presented here and in the previous study (10.Rogers P.A. Ding H. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 30980-30986Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar), we propose that the repair of the protein dinitrosyl iron complexes has two steps. First, l-cysteine removes the nitric oxide moieties from the dinitrosyl iron complex, leaving an unstable iron center transiently associated with the protein (10.Rogers P.A. Ding H. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 30980-30986Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). In this reaction,l-cysteine has a unique activity because other related biological thiols such as N-acetyl-l-cysteine, and glutathione as well as sulfide have little effect on the stability of the protein dinitrosyl iron complexes. The putative intermediate of the protein dinitrosyl iron complex after the nitric oxide moieties are removed by l-cysteine may be recycled for the formation of new iron-sulfur clusters if sulfide is provided in a timely manner. In the second step, l-cysteine as a substrate for IscS will provide sulfide for reassembly of iron-sulfur clusters in proteins. In aerobically growing E. coli cells, the intracellularl-cysteine concentration was estimated to be ∼0.2 mm (45.Greenberg J.T. Demple B. J. Bacteriol. 1986; 168: 1026-1029Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This amount of l-cysteine seems to be sufficient for repairing the nitric oxide-modified iron-sulfur proteins in E. coli cells (10.Rogers P.A. Ding H. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 30980-30986Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 14.Ding H. Demple B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 5146-5150Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar). The disruption of intact E. coli cells may result in substantial dilution and oxidation ofl-cysteine such that the protein dinitrosyl iron complexes are stable in the cell extracts. The addition of l-cysteine to the cell extracts efficiently decomposes the otherwise stable protein dinitrosyl iron complexes (10.Rogers P.A. Ding H. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 30980-30986Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). It seems thatl-cysteine biosynthesis has an important role in repairing the modified iron-sulfur proteins when cells are subjected to oxidative stresses. Although much has been learned about thel-cysteine biosynthesis pathway in E. coli (46.Kredich N.M. Neidhardt F.C. Curtiss R.I. Ingraham J.L. Lin E.C.C. Low K.B. Magasanik B. Reznikoff W.S. Riley M. Schaechter M. Umbarger H.E. Escherichia coli and Salmonella typhimurium: Cellular and Molecular Biology. American Society for Microbiology, Washington, D. C.1996: 514-527Google Scholar), the genetic regulation of l-cysteine metabolism has not been fully understood. Recent gene array experiments revealed that the cysK gene encoding O-acetylserine sulfhydrylase A, a key enzyme for the l-cysteine biosynthesis in E. coli (46.Kredich N.M. Neidhardt F.C. Curtiss R.I. Ingraham J.L. Lin E.C.C. Low K.B. Magasanik B. Reznikoff W.S. Riley M. Schaechter M. Umbarger H.E. Escherichia coli and Salmonella typhimurium: Cellular and Molecular Biology.

LaRossa R.A. Storz G. J. Bacteriol. 2001; 183: 4562-4570Crossref PubMed Scopus (661) Google Scholar), suggesting that thel-cysteine biosynthesis is part of a global response to oxidative stresses.

It has been widely accepted that the reactions of nitric oxide (NO) with either oxyhemoglobin or oxymyoglobin to form nitrate ion, and respectively, methemoglobin or metmyoglobin constitute the major catabolic pathways by which excess NO is removed from tissues in vivo.

Here, however, we demonstrate that at NO levels prevalent under more typically encountered physiological conditions, there is no measurable increase in metmyoglobin content of cardiomyocytes. Furthermore, rather than nitrate ion, the major product of cellular catabolism is nitrite ion (NO2−), probably formed in a reaction involving cytochrome c oxidase.

In the presence of molecules known to bind PI(4,5)P2 the EPR spectrum of this label exhibits an increase in line width because of a decrease in label dynamics, and titration of this probe with neomycin yields the expected 1:1 stoichiometry. Thus, this probe can be used to quantitate the interactions made by the PI(4,5)P2head group within the bilayer. In the presence of a peptide comprising the effector domain of MARCKS the EPR spectrum broadens, but the changes in line shape are modulated by both changes in label correlation time and spin-spin interactions. This result indicates that at least some proxyl-PIP2 are in close proximity when bound to MARCKS and that MARCKS associates with multiple PI(4,5)P2 molecules. Titration of the proxyl-PIP2 EPR signal by the MARCKS-derived peptide also suggests that multiple PI(4,5)P2 molecules interact with MARCKS. Site-directed spin labeling of this peptide shows that the position and conformation of this protein segment at the membrane interface are not altered significantly by binding to PI(4,5)P2.

There are several ways in which the distribution of PI(4,5)P2 within the cell might be regulated.

The MARCKS effector domain (resi- dues 151–175) is highly basic having the sequence KKKKKRFSFKKSFKLSGFSFKKNKK. MARCKS binds strongly to Ca2+-calmodulin through this domain (17.McIlroy B.K.

Although it has been implicated in a number of cellular processes, the exact role of MARCKS has been unclear. Because phosphorylation prevents MARCKS from binding to calmodulin, it was suggested that MARCKS might allow for an interaction between protein kinase C and calmodulin-dependent signaling pathways (17.McIlroy B.K.

Chem. 1991; 266: 4959-4964Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar); however, recent work suggests that MARCKS actually functions to sequester PI(4,5)P2 within the plane of the bilayer. The binding of MARCKS (151–175) to the membrane interface has been shown to inhibit the hydrolysis of PI(4,5)P2 by either phospholipase C (PLC)-δ or PLC-β (11.Glaser M. Wanaski S. Buser C.A. Boguslavsky V. Rashidzada W. Morris A. Rebecchi M. Scarlata S.F. Runnels L.W. Prestwich G.D. Chen J. Aderem A. Ahn J. McLaughlin S. J. Biol.

Chem. 2001; 276: 5012-5019Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar), presumably because this peptide competes successfully with the active site of PLC for PI(4,5)P2. MARCKS has been shown to accumulate at lipid rafts and to codistribute with PI(4,5)P2 (13.Laux T. Fakami K. Thelen M. Golub T. Frey D. Caroni P. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 149: 1455-1471Crossref PubMed Scopus (518) Google Scholar), and a peptide derived from the effector domain of MARCKS (MARCKS (151–175)) has been shown to bind strongly to membranes containing PI(4,5)P2 and PI(3,4)P2 (12.Arbuzova A. Wang L. Wang J. Hangyas-Mihalyne G. Murray D. Honig B. McLaughlin S. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 10330-10339Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar, 14.Wang J. Arbuzova A. Hangyas-Mihalyne G. McLaughlin S.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 5012-5019Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). As a result of this interaction, MARCKS may bind a significant fraction of PI(4,5)P2 within the plasma membrane. Free levels of PI(4,5)P2 in the membrane could then be controlled either through protein kinase C, by controlling the phosphorylation state of the MARCKS effector domain, or through the cytoplasmic levels of Ca2+-calmodulin. In the present study, we examined the interaction between MARCKS (151–175) and PI(4,5)P2 using two approaches. First, we synthesized a novel spin-labeled derivative of PI(4,5)P2 in which a proxyl nitroxide spin label was incorporated into thesn-1 acyl chain of the phospholipid (21.Prestwich G.D. Acc. Chem. Res. 1996; 29: 503-509Crossref Scopus (107) Google Scholar). EPR spectroscopy then was used to examine the interactions between this spin label and known PI(4,5)P2-binding macromolecules and the interactions between this label and MARCKS (151–175). Second, we derivatized a series of cysteine-substituted peptides based on MARCKS (151–175) with a sulfhydryl reactive spin label (Fig. 1) and used EPR spectroscopy to examine the conformation and structure of MARCKS (151–175) in the presence and absence of PI(4,5)P2. The data demonstrate that the proxyl-PIP2 is a useful probe for the interactions between PI(4,5)P2 and molecules that bind the PI(4,5)P2 head group within the plane of the bilayer. The data also indicate that MARCKS (151–175) associates with multiple PI(4,5)P2 molecules within the plane of the membrane by a process that is driven largely by electrostatic interactions. Palmitoyloleoylphosphatidylserine (PS), palmitoyloleoylphosphatidylcholine (PC), 5-doxyl phosphatidylcholine (5-doxyl PC), and the ammonium salt of phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2) were obtained from Avanti Polar Lipids (Alabaster, AL). Neomycin was obtained from Calbiochem. Spin-labeled derivatives of MARCKS (151–175) were synthesized and purified by HPLC as described previously (22.Qin Z. Cafiso D.S. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 2917-2925Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar) or obtained from the Biomolecular research facility at the University of Virginia. The identity of the labeled peptides was confirmed by mass spectrometry, and they had a purity in excess of 97% as determined by HPLC and in-line detection by UV spectroscopy of the peptide backbone at 210 nm. A suspension of 3-carboxy proxyl, free radical (99.9 mg, 0.54 mmol) and N-hydroxysuccinimide (67.6 mg, 0.59 mmol) was prepared in 10 ml of CH2Cl2(distilled from CaH2) and stirred for 20 min. Dicyclohexylcarbodiimide (116.1 mg, 0.56 mmol) and dimethylaminopyridine (24.0 mg, 0.20 mmol) were added, and the reaction mixture was stirred overnight at room temperature. The precipitate was filtered off, and the filtrate was evaporated to dryness. The residue was suspended in EtOAc, filtered, and the filtrate evaporated to dryness. The product was purified through a plug of silica, eluted with 3:2 hexanes:EtOAc. The yield was 91.7 mg (60%) as an orange oil. This product yielded a single spot by TLC, RF: 0.44 (3:7 hexanes:EtOAc); ES-MS: m/z = 285.1 [M+H]+. A solution of 1 (2.5 mg, 8.8 μmol) in 0.5 ml of dimethylformamide was added to a solution of 2 (23.Chen J.J. Profit A.A. Prestwich G.D. J. Org. Chem. 1996; 61: 6305-6312Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar) (5.2 mg, 5.4 μmol) in 0.25 m TEAB buffer (0.5 ml, pH 7.8) and stirred overnight at room temperature. The reaction mixture was concentrated to dryness, and the residue was washed with acetone (5 × 1.5 ml). The crude product was dissolved in 2 ml of water and applied to a small column (12 × 15 mm) of DEAE-cellulose. The column was eluted with a step gradient (0.2m steps) of 0.2–2.0 m TEAB (2-ml portions) and finally with 3:7 MeOH:TEAB (2 m). The product started to elute with 1.6 m TEAB and finished with the MeOH:TEAB mixture. The desired fractions, detected by phosphate assay, were pooled and lyophilized yielding the product as the triethylammonium salt. The yield was 2.7 mg. ES-MS: m/z = 1015.3 [M+H]+. The product ion was the only major peak in the mass spectrum, and no ion corresponding to the mass of the starting material, 2, was detected. Furthermore, the product was tested with a ninhydrin assay, and no amine was found to be present, indicating the absence of the starting material, 2. EPR spectroscopy indicated that there was no detectable unreacted proxyl-nitroxide present in the sample, and the EPR spectra of this product in CHCl3 and bound to membranes was consistent with that expected for a spin-labeled amphiphile. The presence of a significant non-spin-labeled species in the purified material was ruled out by comparing the concentration of 3 determined gravimetrically with that obtained by double integration of the EPR signal of 3. These concentrations were in agreement, within experimental error, and were also in agreement with the concentration determined from total phosphate (24.Bartlett G.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1959; 234: 466-468Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, titration of the product with neomycin (see “Results”) indicated a 1:1 binding with the appropriate affinity. These assays indicated that the purity of3 was a minimum of 90%. Recombinant PH domain from human PLC-δ1 was produced from anEscherichia coli strain that was generously provided by Mario Rebecchi and purified following a procedure described previously (25.Tall E. Dorman G. Garcia P. Runnels L. Shah S. Chen J.J. Profit A.A. Gu Q.M. Chaudhary A. Prestwich G.D. Rebecchi M.J. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 7239-7248Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). The identity of the PH domain was confirmed by gel electrophoresis and mass spectrometry, and the purity as judged by electrophoresis was greater than 95%. Lipid bilayers having the desired lipid composition were produced by mixing the appropriate lipids from stock solutions in chloroform, removing the chloroform by vacuum desiccation, and hydrating the resulting lipid film in a buffer containing 100 mm KCl, 10 mm MOPS, pH 7.0. The lipid mixture was freeze-thawed five times, and unilamellar vesicles were produced by extrusion of the mixture through 1,000 Å polycarbonate filters (Poretics, Livermore, CA) using a LiposoFast extruder (Avestine, Ottawa, Canada). Proxyl-PIP2 could be incorporated into both leaflets of the membrane by dissolving the labeled lipid into the lipid chloroform solution; however, in all of the data shown here, the spin label was incorporated into the outer membrane leaflet by adding the vesicle solution to a dried film of proxyl-PIP2. The addition of unlabeled or spin-labeled MARCKS (151–175) to preformed lipid vesicles was accomplished by adding the peptide from the external aqueous solution. EPR spectra for either proxyl-PIP2 or spin-labeled MARCKS (151–175) were obtained at X-band from ∼5 μl of sample using a Varian E-line century series spectrometer fitted with a MITEQ microwave amplifier (Hauppauge, NY) and a two-loop one-gap resonator (Medical Advances, Milwaukee, WI). Nonsaturated EPR spectra were obtained using a microwave power of ∼2 mW or less and a modulation amplitude of 1 gauss peak to peak. EPR spectroscopy was used to titrate the interaction between proxyl-PIP2 and MARCKS (151–175) or neomycin using an approach similar to that described previously (26.Archer S.J. Ellena J.F. Cafiso D.S. Biophys. J. 1991; 60: 389-398Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). In this case, 50–100 μl of a lipid vesicle suspension at a lipid concentration of 20 mm having 0.25–0.5% proxyl-PIP2 was titrated with neomycin or MARCKS (151–175) by measuring the first derivative peak-to-peak (or peak-to-trough) amplitude of the central proxyl nitroxide resonance, A(0). Using a stainless steel plunger, ∼10 μl of sample was drawn into or removed from a (0.5-mm inner diameter × 0.7-mm outer diameter) quartz capillary (VitroCom, Mt. Lakes, NJ) that was fitted into the loop-gap resonator. The amplitude of the central nitroxide resonance, A(0), was then recorded as a function of the concentration of neomycin or MARCKS (151–175) added to the lipid sample. The EPR spectrum of proxyl-PIP2 in the presence of neomycin or MARCKS (151–175) is a linear combination of EPR signals from free lipid and lipid bound to the macromolecule. If the line shapes for these species is known, the fraction of bound proxyl-PIP2 may then be determined from the value of A(0) (see Equation 6). Power saturation measurements were made on proxyl-PIP2 and on spin-labeled MARCKS (151–175) to determine the depth of the nitroxide label from the level of the lipid phosphate. These measurements were carried out in a manner similar to that described previously (27.Victor K. Cafiso D.S. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 3402-3410Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar) using gas-permeable TPX capillary tubes (Medical Advances, Milwaukee WI). In each case, the peak-to-peak (or peak-to-trough) amplitude of the central (mI = 0) first derivative EPR resonanceA(0) on the incident microwave power, P, was measured and fit to the expressionA(0)=IP1+2−ε−1PP1/2−εEquation 1 where I is a scaling factor,P1/2 is the microwave power required to reduce the resonance amplitude to half its unsaturated value, and ε is a measure of the homogeneity of the saturation of the resonance (28.Altenbach C. Greenhalgh D.A. Khorana H.G. Hubbell W.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 1667-1671Crossref PubMed Scopus (407) Google Scholar).P1/2 was determined with I, ε, andP1/2 as adjustable parameters for each label under three conditions: when equilibrated with a N2, equilibrated with air (20% O2), or equilibrated with N2 in the presence of 20 mm NiEDDA (in PC membranes, NiAA was used as the paramagnetic metal). The value of ΔP1/2oxyor ΔP1/2NiEDDAwas determined from the difference in P1/2 in the presence and absence of either NiEDDA or O2, respectively. For each sample a depth parameter, Φ, was determined from the values of ΔP1/2 according to Equation 2.Φ≡lnΔP1/2oxyΔP1/2NiEDDAEquation 2 The parameter Φ is directly related to the difference in the standard state chemical potentials of O2 and NiEDDA, which vary as a function of depth in the lipid bilayer. As a result, Φ provides an estimate of the nitroxide depth in the lipid bilayer (28.Altenbach C. Greenhalgh D.A. Khorana H.G. Hubbell W.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 1667-1671Crossref PubMed Scopus (407) Google Scholar). The 1:1 binding of neomycin or other macromolecule (M) to proxyl-PIP2 was analyzed in an manner similar to that described previously (14.Wang J. Arbuzova A. Hangyas-Mihalyne G. McLaughlin S.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 5012-5019Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar) for the equilibrium.M+PIP2↔M·PIP2REACTION 1The apparent association constant, Ka, for 1:1 binding is given by Equation 3,Ka=M·PIP2[M][PIP2]Equation 3 where [M·PIP2] is the concentration of the macromolecule·PIP2 complex, [PIP2] is the concentration of free PIP2, and [M] is the concentration of macromolecule in aqueous solution. In addition, if [M]T and [PIP2]T represent the total concentrations of macromolecule and PIP2, respectively, we may write Equations 4 and 5 as follows.[M] T=[M]+M·PIP2Equation 4 PIP2T=PIP2+M·PIP2Equation 5 The solution of Equations Equation 3, Equation 4, Equation 5 yields a quadratic that can be used to predict the 1:1 binding as a function of the concentration of neomycin or other PIP2-binding species. This expression can be used to predict the amplitude of the central EPR resonance amplitude, A(0), as a function of added macromolecule. As indicated above, the EPR spectrum is a simple sum of EPR spectra from the free and bound proxyl-PIP2, as a result the magnitude of A(0) may be written asA(0)PIP2PIP2TAf+M·PIP2PIP2TAbEquation 6 where Af and Abrepresent the intrinsic amplitudes of free and macromolecule-associated proxyl-PIP2. Equation 6 was used in combination with Equations Equation 3, Equation 4, Equation 5 to determine the 1:1 binding behavior of proxyl-PIP2. Using a similar approach, we also analyzed the titration of proxyl-PIP2 with MARCKS (151–175) for the case where multiple PIP2 bind to the effector domain of MARCKS. In this case we assume the equilibrium in Reaction 2.M+(PIP2) n↔M·(PIP2) nREACTION 2In this equilibrium it is assumed that MARCKS (151–175) binds in a single step to n proxyl-PIP2, and a quadratic equation that describes this binding may be derived using equations analogous to 3, 4, and 5 shown above. It should be noted that this binding assumes that n proxyl-PIP2 are in a preformed complex before binding to MARCKS (151–175). This is almost certainly not the case, and Reaction 2 should be taken only as an approximation of the actual events that take place during peptide binding. Shown in Fig. 3A is an EPR spectrum of the triethylammonium salt of proxyl-PIP2 dissolved into chloroform at a concentration of ∼200 μm. The EPR spectrum exhibits clear evidence for spin exchange, which likely results from the formation of inverted micelles in this nonpolar solvent. In the aqueous phase, PI(4,5)P2 is known to form micelles (29.van Paridon P.A. de Kruijff B. Ouwerkerk R. Wirtz K.W.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1986; 877: 216-219Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar), and this also appears to be the case for proxyl-PIP2. Although proxyl-PIP2 is freely soluble in aqueous solution, no EPR spectrum can be observed at room temperature. This is consistent with the formation of micelles, which would promote strong dipolar interactions and/or spin exchange between labeled nitroxides and result in high relaxation rates. The lack of an observable EPR spectrum also indicates that the critical micelle concentration for proxyl-PIP2 must be lower than 5 μm because an aqueous concentration of monomeric proxyl-PIP2 at or above this concentration would have yielded a well resolved signal. When lipid vesicles formed from PC are added to solid proxyl-PIP2 as described above (see “Methods”), the EPR spectrum shown in Fig. 3B is observed. This spectrum is characteristic of a label that is monomeric in the membrane and undergoing relatively rapid motion, and it is reasonably well simulated assuming an isotropic rotational model where the nitroxide has a correlation time of about 6 ns. To ensure that the spectrum in Fig. 3B arises from a nitroxide with a membrane location, the EPR spectrum was power saturated (see “Methods”) in the presence of O2, NiAA, or NiEDDA. The values of ΔP1/2 for O2 and the metal complexes are consistent with a membrane location for the label. For proxyl-PIP2 in the presence of PC, we obtain a depth parameter, Φ, of −0.77 using 20 mmNiAA. Using a calibration curve determined previously for PC bilayers (28.Altenbach C. Greenhalgh D.A. Khorana H.G. Hubbell W.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 1667-1671Crossref PubMed Scopus (407) Google Scholar), a location of 3 ± 2 Å below the level of the lipid phosphate is obtained. For proxyl-PIP2 incorporated into PC:PS membranes, a value of Φ = 0.46 is obtained using 20 mm NiEDDA. This value yields a position of 6 ± 2 Å below the level of the lipid phosphate based on a calibration determined recently for PC:PS (30.Victor K.G. Cafiso D.S. Biophys. J. 2001; 81: 2241-2250Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Thus, the power saturation data are consistent with a membrane location for the proxyl-PIP2, where the label takes up a position a few Å within the bilayer below the level of the head group phosphate. This position is ∼10 Å shallower than that expected if the glycerol backbone of the proxyl-PIP2 were located at the same position as the membrane lipid, and the acyl chain attached to the proxyl spin label were in a fully extended conformation. Double integration of the spectrum in Fig. 3B yielded a spin concentration of ∼90 μm, which is close to the concentration of nitroxide label added to the vesicle suspension. Thus, this label fully incorporates into the lipid bilayer when absorbed to vesicles from the external aqueous solution. Because PI(4,5)P2 has ∼3 negative charges at neutral pH it is not expected to undergo transmembrane migration; as a result, proxyl-PIP2 that is incorporated in this manner should reside on the external surface of these preformed lipid vesicles. In subsequent experiments, detailed below, proxyl-PIP2 has been incorporated in this manner into the external vesicle surface. To determine whether the EPR spectrum of proxyl-PIP2 is sensitive to interactions of its head group, we compared the EPR spectra of proxyl-PIP2in the presence and absence of neomycin and the PH domain from PLC-δ1, two well characterized PI(4,5)P2-binding molecules. Shown in Fig. 4, Aand B, are EPR spectra for proxyl-PIP2 in the presence and absence of neomycin and the PLC-δ1 PH domain. Both of these molecules are known to exhibit strong 1:1 binding to PIP2, and in both cases, the EPR spectra exhibit a similar broadening in the presence of these reagents. This level of broadening corresponds to an increase in the rotational correlation time for the proxyl label of about 25%. There are several mechanisms that might give rise to this change in rotational correlation time. The proxyl spin label is quite mobile when attached to PI(4,5)P2, which is not unreasonable given the alkyl chain and rotatable bonds that link the label to the glycerol backbone. However, bond rotations and librations of this chain are expected to be of limited amplitude, and some averaging of the nitroxide magnetic interactions should result from lipid rotational motion that takes place on the ns time scale (31.Pastor R.W. Venable R.M. Karplus M. Szabo A. J. Chem. Phys. 1988; 89: 1128-1140Crossref Scopus (94) Google Scholar). As a result, any interaction that slows the rotational rate of the labeled lipid, such as attachment to a large macromolecule, should broaden its EPR spectrum. Conceivably, interactions with the PI(4,5)P2 head group might sterically interfere with the spin label and reduce the amplitude of motion of the proxyl label attached to the sn-1 chain. Finally, the if the interaction with proxyl-PIP2altered the membrane position of the label, changes in label motion might result because of the altered environment around the label. To determine whether more quantitative information can be extracted from the interaction of proxyl-PIP2 with a PI(4,5)P2-binding species, we titrated the first derivative EPR line amplitude (see “Methods”) as a function of the neomycin concentration. Shown in Fig. 5 are the first derivative EPR amplitudes obtained from this titration. Addition of neomycin results in the formation of a PI(4,5)P2·neomycin"

Stabilization of ATP at NBD1 depends on, and simultaneously promotes, engagement of NBD2 into a MgADP-bound conformation required to counteract ATP-induced pore closure. Thus, rather than individual components of the regulatory subunit, it is the functional tandem formed by NBD1 and NBD2 that drives SUR-mediated nucleotide-dependent gating of the KATP channel complex. The ATPase activity in the second nucleotide binding domain (NBD2) of the cardiac sulfonylurea receptor (SUR2A) was measured as described (3.Bienengraeber M. Alekseev A.E. Abraham M.R. Carrasco A.J.

In brief, recombinant NBD2 (Gly1306–Thr1498) was purified fromEscherichia coli as a fusion to maltose binding protein using affinity chromatography on an amylose resin in (mm) 600 NaCl, 1 EDTA, 20 Tris (pH 7.4), and 10% glycerol. Products of [γ-32P]ATP hydrolysis, measured in (mm) 34 KCl, 8 MgCl2, 50 HEPES (pH 7.4), 4 ATP, and 10% glycerol (1 h, 37 °C), were then resolved by polyethyleneimine thin layer chromatography (Cellulose PEI TLC, Sigma) in 0.75 mKH2PO4 (pH 4.8). ATPase activity of NBD2 (10 μg) was quantified with a PhosphorImager and ImageQuant software (Molecular Dynamics). Point mutations in the core consensus sequence of the Walker motifs of NBD1 and NBD2 in the hamster cardiac SUR isoform, SUR2A, were introduced in the pCDNA3.1 plasmid by PCR amplification of both DNA strands with complementary primers containing desired amino acid changes (QuickChange, Stratagene). Primers were designed to contain 30 bases harboring the mutation in the middle, with at least one base at the 3′ end being C or G. Mutated constructs were sequenced to confirm point mutations and rule out additional changes in the sequence (3.Bienengraeber M. Alekseev A.E. Abraham M.R. Carrasco A.J. Moreau C. Vivaudou M. Dzeja P.P. Terzic A. FASEB J. 2000; 14: 1943-1952Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). COS-1 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% fetal calf serum plus 2 mm glutamine and seeded at 2 × 106 cells prior to transfection. Kir6.2, with wild-type or mutated SUR2A, were subcloned into the expression vector pCDNA3.1 (5.Zingman L.V. Alekseev A.E. Bienengraeber M. Hodgson D. Karger A.B. Dzeja P.P. Terzic A.

COS cells were transiently transfected with plasmids using LipofectAMINE 2000 (Invitrogen). pCDNA3.1-SUR2A (10 μg) and pCDNA3.1-Kir6.2 (1 μg) were included with the expression vector for green fluorescent protein (0.5 μg of pGREEN-lantern, Invitrogen) used as a reporter gene. Channel behavior was recorded in isolated ventricular myocytes dissociated from guinea pig hearts (29.Alekseev A.E. Brady P.A. Terzic A. J. Gen. Physiol. 1998; 111: 381-394Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar) as well as in COS-1 cells expressing recombinant KATP channels (5.Zingman L.V. Alekseev A.E. Bienengraeber M. Hodgson D. Karger A.B. Dzeja P.P. Terzic A. Neuron. 2001; 31: 233-245Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). Pipettes (∼7–10 MΩ) were filled with (in mm) KCl 140, CaCl2 1, MgCl2 1, HEPES-KOH 5 (pH 7.3). For the inside-out configuration, cells were superfused with “internal solution” (in mm) KCl 140, MgCl2 1, EGTA 5, HEPES-KOH 5 (pH 7.3). For the open cell-attached patch, internal solution was supplemented with glucose (1 g/liter), malic acid (5 mm), and pyruvic acid (5 mm). Following seal formation, the open cell-attached configuration was obtained by applying digitonin (8 μg/ml) through a second pipette (filled with 5 μg/ml propidium iodide and 0.5 μg/ml rhodamine). Solution flow was visualized by rhodamine under ultraviolet light, and staining of the cell nucleus with propidium iodide served as a criterion for plasmalemmal permeabilization. Data were expressed as means ± S.E. In conjunction with current recording, two established approaches (30.Szabo K. Szakacs G. Hegeds T. Sarkadi B. J. Biol.

First, γ-phosphate analogs, orthovanadate and beryllium fluoride, were used to stabilize MgADP in the post- and prehydrolytic states of SUR, respectively (5.Zingman L.V. Alekseev A.E.

To this end, sodium vanadate (100 mm, Sigma) was dissolved in water (pH 10), and orthovanadate was obtained by boiling the vanadate solution (pH 10). Freshly boiled stock was diluted to final concentration (pH 7.3) prior to use. Beryllium fluoride (BeF2), as a 33% stock solution (Alfa), was dissolved in buffer solution containing 50 mmKF to produce sufficient amount of phosphate analogs BeFx (BeF3−and BeF42−) (31.Goldstein G. Anal. Chem. 1964; 36: 243-244Crossref Scopus (59) Google Scholar). For electrophysiological experiments, 50 mm KF replaced 50 mm KCl in the internal solution. Second, nucleotide occlusion was induced in the absence of γ-phosphate analogs by cooling down the membrane patch after formation of the occluded nucleotide at >30 °C (30.Szabo K. Szakacs G. Hegeds T. Sarkadi B. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 12209-12212Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). In these experiments we used a heating/cooling bath temperature controller (HCC-100A, Dagan Corp.) equipped with an electronically controlled high precision (±0.1 °C) and broad range Peltier thermocouple set between 4 and 32 °C. Engagement of the NBD2 ATPase cycle into discrete conformations determines KATP channel behavior (5.Zingman L.V. Alekseev A.E. Bienengraeber M. Hodgson D. Karger A.B. Dzeja P.P. Terzic A. Neuron. 2001; 31: 233-245Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). In this regard, γ-phosphate analogs, orthovanadate and beryllium fluoride, are valuable tools that arrest the ATPase cycle in distinct conformations by stabilizing MgADP at the catalytic site (32.Hrycyna C.A. Ramachandra M. Germann U.A. Cheng P.W. Pastan I. Gottesman M.M. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 13887-13899Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar, 33.Sankaran B. Bhagat S. Senior A.E.

Here, ATPase activity in recombinant NBD2 was 77.6 ± 3.9 nmol Pi/min/mg (n = 11) and was suppressed to 17.4 ± 2.8 (n = 11) and 6.4 ± 2.2 (n = 4) nmol Pi/min/mg by 1 mmorthovanadate and beryllium fluoride, respectively (Fig. 1A). Vigorous activation of ATP-inhibited wild-type recombinant KATP channels (Kir6.2/SUR2A, Fig. 1C) produced by orthovanadate through stabilization of NBD2 in a MgADP-bound post-hydrolytic conformation (5.Zingman L.V.

Neuron. 2001; 31: 233-245Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar) was disrupted not only by mutations in NBD2 but also in NBD1 (Fig. 1, B and E). Specifically, orthovanadate-induced KATP channel opening was abolished either by replacing aspartate with asparagine in the Walker B motif of the SUR2A NBD2 (D1470N), a mutation that disrupts ATP hydrolysis (3.Bienengraeber M. Alekseev A.E. Abraham M.R. Carrasco A.J. Moreau C. Vivaudou M. Dzeja P.P. Terzic A. FASEB J. 2000; 14: 1943-1952Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar,32.Hrycyna C.A. Ramachandra M. Germann U.A. Cheng P.W. Pastan I. Gottesman M.M. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 13887-13899Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar), or by exchanging lysine for alanine in the Walker A motif of NBD1 (K708A), which precludes ATP binding to SUR1 (20; Fig. 1, Band E). On average, channel activity in the presence of 0.25 mm ATP and 1 mm orthovanadate was in the wild type 72 ± 18% of maximal channel opening measured in the absence of ATP (n = 4; Fig. 1B). It was reduced to 5 ± 3% in the D1470N mutant and to 3 ± 1% in the K708A mutant (n = 4; Fig. 1B). Similarly, either the D1470N or the K708A mutation reversed the inhibitory effect of beryllium fluoride (Fig. 1, B, D, andE), which traps the NBD2 ATPase in a prehydrolytic ATP-like bound state (5.Zingman L.V. Alekseev A.E. Bienengraeber M. Hodgson D. Karger A.B. Dzeja P.P. Terzic A. Neuron. 2001; 31: 233-245Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). Accordingly, KATP channel activity in the presence of 0.1 mm MgADP and 1 mm BeFxwas in wild-type, D1470N, and K708A mutants, respectively, 8 ± 2%, 63 ± 14%, and 79 ± 10% of the maximal activity measured in the absence of nucleotide (n = 3; Fig. 1B). Thus, an intact NBD1 is required for the NBD2 ATPase dependent KATP channel gating. MgADP at NBD2 promotes KATP channel opening (5.Zingman L.V. Alekseev A.E. Bienengraeber M. Hodgson D. Karger A.B. Dzeja P.P. Terzic A. Neuron. 2001; 31: 233-245Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar) and concomitantly stabilizes ATP at NBD1 even in the absence of γ-phosphate analogs (6.Matsuo M. Kioka N. Amachi T. Ueda K. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 37479-37482Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar,19.Matsuo M. Tanabe K. Kioka N. Amachi T. Ueda K. J. Biol.

A. 1999; 96: 1268-1272Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). Whether such stabilization of ATP at NBD1 is required for NBD2-dependent channel gating has not been resolved thus far, as the lifetime of the MgADP-bound conformation is limited because of dissociation from NBD2 (5.Zingman L.V. Alekseev A.E. Bienengraeber M. Hodgson D. Karger A.B. Dzeja P.P. Terzic A. Neuron. 2001; 31: 233-245Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar, 19.Matsuo M. Tanabe K.

Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 1268-1272Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). To slow ATPase activity and promote the lifetime of MgADP at the catalytic site, we cooled membrane patches and monitored KATP channel behavior on-line. ATP inhibition of KATP channels (at >30 °C) was reversed by transient cooling (to 5 °C) of membrane patches (Fig. 2A). On average, in inside-out patches (Fig. 2B, upper panel) ATP-induced channel inhibition was markedly reduced from an initial IC50 of 25 ± 1.4 μm (n = 5–12) to 0.7 ± 0.1 mm (n = 2–5) following the cooling interval. Similarly, in open cell-attached patches (Fig. 2B, lower panel), a distinct patch condition, the sensitivity of KATP channels toward ATP was reduced from an initial IC50 of 270 ± 21 μm (n= 6–14) to 1.6 ± 0.2 mm (n = 2–7) after cooling. In contrast, cooling-induced KATP channel activation was not achieved in the presence of poorly hydrolyzable ATP analogs, AMP-PNP (n = 5; Fig. 2C) or Ap4A (n = 3; Fig. 2D). Thus, cooling does not disrupt hydrolysis-independent KATPchannel gating but rather promotes MgADP stabilization at the catalytic site (30.Szabo K. Szakacs G. Hegeds T. Sarkadi B. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 12209-12212Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar), which in turn is essential for channel opening. Although MgADP can be stabilized at NBD2 (5.Zingman L.V. Alekseev A.E. Bienengraeber M. Hodgson D. Karger A.B. Dzeja P.P. Terzic A. Neuron. 2001; 31: 233-245Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar), excluding ATP, by application of the ADP-regenerating system hexokinase plus glucose prevented cooling-induced reduction of KATP channel sensitivity to ATP (Fig. 2E). This suggests that the presence of ATP at NBD1 is a prerequisite for MgADP to serve as a KATP channel regulator at NBD2. Indeed, in the same patch, cooling performed in the presence of ATP induced KATP channel opening, which was abolished by activation of the ADP-scavenging creatine phosphate/creatine kinase system (Fig. 2E). Therefore, cooperative stabilization of ATP and MgADP at NBDs translates into KATP channel opening at inhibitory levels of ATP. The cooperative binding of nucleotides at the NBDs of KATP channels (6.Matsuo M. Kioka N. Amachi T. Ueda K. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 37479-37482Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar, 19.Matsuo M. Tanabe K. Kioka N. Amachi T. Ueda K. J. Biol.

A. 1999; 96: 1268-1272Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar) suggests a joint action of NBD1 and NBD2 on channel gating. Disruption of either NBD1 or NBD2 through mutation precluded the reduction in ATP-sensitivity observed after cooling in wild-type Kir6.2/SUR2A KATP channels (Fig. 3A). Specifically, mutations in the Walker motifs of NBD2 (K1349A and/or D1470N), which diminish the intrinsic ATPase activity (3.Bienengraeber M. Alekseev A.E. Abraham M.R. Carrasco A.J. Moreau C. Vivaudou M. Dzeja P.P. Terzic A. FASEB J. 2000; 14: 1943-1952Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar), attenuated KATP channel activation following cooling (Fig. 3B). The time course of KATP channel activation was fitted by the Boltzmann's function, Imax·[1 +exp((T0.5 −t)/k)]−1, whereImax is the maximal channel activity expressed relative to the activity in the absence of ATP,T0.5 the time of half-activation, tthe relative time of reheating, and k the slope of the time course. In wild-type Kir6.2/SUR2A channels, parameters defining the time course were as follows: Imax = 1.12 ± 0.04, T0.5 = 0.60 ± 0.03, andk = 0.24 ± 0.03 (n = 3; Fig. 3D). The K1349A/D1470N mutations significantly decreased and delayed activation of KATP channels (Imax = 0.42 ± 0.04,T0.5 = 0.92 ± 0.05, k = 0.16 ± 0.04, n = 3; Fig. 3D). Furthermore, the K708A mutation that prevents ATP binding to NBD1 (20.Ueda K. Inagaki N. Seino S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 22983-22986Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar) also abolished KATP channel activation (n = 3; Fig. 3, C and D). Thus, disrupting either NBD1 or NBD2 impedes KATP channel opening upon cooling, indicating that NBDs act as a functional unit rather than as independent determinants of channel gating. In the hetero-octameric KATP channel complex (35.Clement J.P. Kunjilwar K. Gonzalez G. Schwanstecher M. Panten U. Aguilar-Bryan L. Bryan J.

A. 1999; 96: 1268-1272Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar); yet the individual and/or collective contribution of NBDs in KATPchannel gating is not fully understood. In this study, we provide functional evidence that cooperative interaction rather than the independent contribution of each NBD is critical for KATPchannel regulation. These findings provide a paradigm for KATP channel gating based on the integration of both NBDs into a functional unit within the multimeric channel complex. Specifically, although gating of cardiac KATP channels was related to discrete conformations in the ATPase cycle at NBD2 (5.Zingman L.V. Alekseev A.E. Bienengraeber M. Hodgson D. Karger A.B. Dzeja P.P. Terzic A. Neuron. 2001; 31: 233-245Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar), it is now shown that the intactness of NBD1 is critical for this function. In agreement with cooperative binding of nucleotides to SUR, where MgADP at NBD2 promotes stabilization of ATP at NBD1 (6.Matsuo M. Kioka N. Amachi T. Ueda K. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 37479-37482Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar, 19.Matsuo M. Tanabe K. Kioka N. Amachi T. Ueda K. J. Biol.

The requirement for “cross-talk” between NBDs appears to be a common feature of several members of the ABC family. In fact, mutations of p-glycoprotein that preclude nucleotide binding or arrest ATP hydrolysis at one NBD prevent normal function at the other NBD (18.Urbatsch I.L. Beaudet L. Carrier I. Gros P.

Moreover, ATP hydrolysis at both NBDs is necessary for transport of a single molecule in the p-glycoprotein transport cycle (16.Sauna Z.E. Ambudkar S.V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 2515-2520Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar, 38.Sauna Z.E. Ambudkar S.V. J. Biol.

Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 1413-1422Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar) permits nucleotide hydrolysis at one NBD to influence nucleotide binding at the other NBD site, thereby regulating chloride conductance (40.Gadsby D.C. Nairn A.C. Physiol. Rev. 1999; 70: 77-107Crossref Scopus (372) Google Scholar). Crystal structures of ABC-related proteins (such as the HisP of histidine permease, MalK of the trehalose/maltose transporter or the Mre11/Rad50-ATPase DNA repair complex) suggest dimerization of the two NBDs with transfer of mechanical energy from one NBD to the other within the protein architecture (41.Jones P.M. George A.M. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 1999; 179: 187-202Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 42.Diederichs K. Diez J. Greller G. Muller C. Breed J. Schnell C. Vonrhein C. Boos W. Welte W.

Cell. 2001; 105: 473-485Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (408) Google Scholar). In this process, ATP binding has been found critical in engaging the two NBD domains into a compact dimer essential for supporting hydrolysis-dependent protein function (42.Diederichs K. Diez J. Greller G. Muller C. Breed J. Schnell C. Vonrhein C. Boos W. Welte W. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 5951-5961Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar). Specifically, ATP binding has been proposed to bring the ATPase domain into a position that ultimately contributes to the “signaling-competent state” of the protein complex (43.Hopfner K.P. Karcher A. Craig L. Woo T.T. Carney J.P. Tainer J.A. Cell. 2001; 105: 473-485Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (408) Google Scholar, 44.Karpowich N. Martsinkevich O. Mille L. Yuan Y.-R.

Thus, by analogy, it is conceivable that ATP binding to NBD1 of SUR is a necessary step in securing the proper structural arrangement of NBD2 required to translate conformational transitions during the ATPase cycle into KATP channel gating. This is in accord with the recent suggestion that the SUR NBD1 in its ATP-bound state directly interacts with the pore-forming Kir6.2 subunit of the KATPchannel, counteracting ATP-induced channel inhibition (45.John S.A. Weiss J.N. Ribalet B. J. Gen. Physiol. 2001; 118: 391-406Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). In a cell in the basal metabolic state, ATP exceeds ADP concentration such that ATP should always be bound to NBD1, whereas hydrolysis of ATP would produce MgADP at NBD2 (Fig. 4). Although this nucleotide combination should in principle be associated with channel opening (6.Matsuo M. Kioka N. Amachi T. Ueda K. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 37479-37482Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar, 19.Matsuo M. Tanabe K. Kioka N. Amachi T. Ueda K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 28757-28763Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar), in a cardiac cell KATPchannels are normally closed (Fig. 4). Indeed, despite continuous ATPase activity at NBD2, the product of ATP hydrolysis is rapidly removed by cellular ADP-scavenging systems, such as that catalyzed by creatine kinase, limiting the lifetime of the MgADP-bound conformation and preventing channel opening (5.Zingman L.V.

Macura S. Terzic A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 44812-44819Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar), ADP will increase at the channel site (5.Zingman L.V. Alekseev A.E.

A prolonged lifetime of the MgADP-bound conformation promotes ATP stabilization at NBD1 and thereby channel opening (5.Zingman L.V. Alekseev A.E. Bienengraeber M. Hodgson D. Karger A.B. Dzeja P.P.

Although here we employed temperature to cooperatively stabilize the MgADP-bound conformation of NBD2 and ATP at NBD1 (19.Matsuo M. Tanabe K. Kioka N. Amachi T. Ueda K. J. Biol.

Indeed, KATP channel behavior has been studied in cardiac myocytes from goldfish that had been acclimated to low temperatures (7 °C) as used in this study (49.Ganim R.B. Peckol E.L. Larkin J. Ruchhoeft M.L. Cameron J.S. Comp. Biochem. Physiol. 1998; 119: 395-401Crossref Scopus (21) Google Scholar). KATP channels from these animals were nearly insensitive to concentrations of ATP that were completely inhibitory in non-cold-acclimated animals (49.Ganim R.B. Peckol E.L. Larkin J. Ruchhoeft M.L. Cameron J.S. Comp. Biochem. Physiol. 1998; 119: 395-401Crossref Scopus (21) Google Scholar). This observation is given a mechanistic basis by the present data, which suggest that membrane cooling promotes cooperative nucleotide stabilization at NBDs resulting in reduction of the channel's ATP sensitivity. The resulting alteration in channel activity is proposed to promote survival at low temperature by membrane potential clamping, as well as maintenance of ionic and energetic homeostasis (49.Ganim R.B. Peckol E.L. Larkin J. Ruchhoeft M.L. Cameron J.S. Comp. Biochem. Physiol. 1998; 119: 395-401Crossref Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Moreover, in mammals, a cardioprotective effect of KATP channels is also present at low temperature, and this effect has been exploited in cardioplegia procedures (50.Kevelaitis E. Peynet J. Mouas C. Launay J.M. Menasche P. Circulation. 1999; 99: 3079-3085Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Thus, the results of the current study provide a working model of KATP channel function and point to potential avenues in addressing the biology of cold tolerance (51.Azzam N.A. Hallenbeck J.M. Kachar B. Nature. 2000; 407: 317-318Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). We are grateful to Drs. K. Ueda and M.

Because these receptors reduce cAMP levels, we explored whether this signaling pathway contributes to release inhibition caused by mGluRs with low affinity forl-2-amino-4-phosphonobutyrate (l-AP4). In biochemical experiments with the population of cerebrocortical nerve terminals we find that l-AP4 (1 mm) inhibited the Ca2+-dependent-evoked release of glutamate by 25%. This inhibitory effect was largely prevented by the pertussis toxin but was insensitive to inhibitors of protein kinase C bisindolylmaleimide and protein kinase A H-89. Furthermore, this inhibition was associated with reduction in N-type Ca2+ channel activity in the absence of any detectable change in cAMP levels. In the presence of forskolin, however,l-AP4 decreased the levels of cAMP. The activation of this additional signaling pathway was very efficient in counteracting the facilitation of glutamate release induced either by forskolin or the β-adrenergic receptor agonist isoproterenol. Imaging experiments to measure Ca2+ dynamics in single nerve terminals showed thatl-AP4 strongly reduced the Ca2+ response in 28% of the nerve terminals. Moreover, immunochemical experiments showed that 25–35% of the nerve terminals that were immunopositive to synaptophysin were also immunoreactive to the low affinityl-AP4-sensitive mGluR7. Then, mGluR7 mediates the inhibition of glutamate release caused by 1 mml-AP4, primarily by a strong inhibition of Ca2+channels, although high cAMP uncovers the receptor ability to decrease cAMP.

Pharmacol. 2000; 131: 453-464Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). In the cerebral cortex mGluRs with high affinity for l-AP4 (EC50 2.3 μm) potently reduce glutamate release in nerve terminals from young (13.Herrero I. Vázquez E. Miras-Portugal M.T. Sánchez-Prieto J. Eur. J. Neurosci. 1996; 8: 700-709Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar) but not from adult rats (18.Vázquez E. Herrero I. Miras-Portugal M.T. Sánchez-Prieto J. Neuroscience. 1995; 68: 117-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). It is therefore possible that in the cerebral cortex of adult rats, mGluRs with low affinity forl-AP4 act as presynaptic receptors that mediate synaptic inhibition. In preparations of this tissue, we have examined whether a mGluR with low affinity for l-AP4 reduces glutamate release in cerebrocortical nerve terminals from adult rats and, moreover, what role the decrease in cAMP levels plays in inhibiting release. Secondly, by combining Ca2+ imaging and immunocytochemistry we determined the impact of receptor activation on the Ca2+dynamics of single nerve terminals to identify the type of mGluR that mediates this response. We found that a mGluR with low affinity forl-AP4 inhibits glutamate release by signaling through two pathways. In one pathway, inhibition of glutamate release occurs by reducing the activity of N-type Ca2+ channels in the absence of any change in cAMP. However, when cAMP levels are higher, the receptor is able to signal through another pathway that diminishes the levels of cAMP, thereby counteracting the facilitation of glutamate release by PKA activation. In addition, thel-AP4-sensitive low affinity mGluR was identified as mGluR7, which was found in a subpopulation of nerve terminals (25–35%), where its activation dramatically reduces depolarization-induced entry of Ca2+ and the ensuing release of glutamate. Synaptosomes were purified on discontinuous Percoll (Amersham Biosciences) gradients as previously described (20.Dunkley P.R. Jarvie P.E. Heath J.W. Kidd G.J.E. Rostas J.A.P.

Briefly, the cerebral cortex was isolated from adult male Wistar rats (2–3 months) and homogenized in a medium containing 0.32 m sucrose, pH 7.4. The homogenate was centrifuged for 2 min at 2,000 ×g at 4 °C, and the supernatant was spun again at 9,500 × g for 12 min. From the pellets formed, the white loosely compacted layer containing the majority of the synaptosomes was gently resuspended in 8 ml of 0.32 sucrose, pH 7.4. Of this synaptosomal suspension, 2 ml was placed onto 3-ml Percoll discontinuous gradients containing 0.32 m sucrose, 1 mm EDTA, 0.25 mmdl-dithiothreitol, and 3, 10, or 23% Percoll, pH 7.4. After centrifugation at 25,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C, the synaptosomes were recovered from between the 10 and 23 Percoll bands and diluted in a final volume of 30 ml of HEPES buffer medium (HBM; 140 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 5 mm NaHCO3, 1.2 mm NaH2PO4, 1 mmMgCl2, 10 mm glucose, and 10 mmHEPES, pH 7.4). After centrifugation at 22,000 × g for 10 min, the synaptosome pellet was resuspended in 8 ml of HBM medium, and the protein content was determined by the Biuret method. Finally, 1 mg of the synaptosomal suspension was diluted in 8 ml of HBM and spun at 3,000 × g for 10 min. The supernatant was discarded, and the pellets containing the synaptosomes were stored on ice. Under these conditions the synaptosomes remain fully viable for at least 4–6 h, as judged by the extent of KCl- and 4AP-evoked glutamate release. Glutamate release was assayed by on-line fluorimetry as described previously (22.Nicholls D.G. Sihra T.S. Sánchez-Prieto J. J. Neurochem. 1987; 49: 50-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (438) Google Scholar). Synaptosomal pellets were resuspended in HBM (0.67 mg/ml) and preincubated at 37 °C for 1 h in the presence of 16 μm bovine serum albumin (BSA) to bind any free fatty acids released from synaptosomes during the preincubation. A 1-ml aliquot was transferred to a stirred cuvette containing 1 mm NADP+, 50 units of glutamate dehydrogenase (Sigma) and 1.33 mm CaCl2 or 200 nmfree Ca2+, and the fluorescence of NADPH was followed in a PerkinElmer LS-50 luminescence spectrometer at excitation and emission wavelengths of 340 and 460 nm, respectively. Traces were calibrated by the addition of 2 nmol of glutamate at the end of each assay. Data points were obtained at 2-s intervals and corrected for Ca2+-independent release. Thus, the Ca2+-dependent release was calculated by subtracting the release obtained during a 5-min period of depolarization at 200 nm free [Ca2+] from the release at 1.33 mm CaCl2. Synaptosomes were resuspended in incubation medium containing 16 μm BSA (2 mg/ml) and preincubated at 37 °C for 5 min. After this time, 1.33 mm CaCl2 and adenosine deaminase (1 unit/mg of protein) were added followed by 1 mm 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine (Sigma) 10 min later, and the mix was incubated for a further 15 min. After this time, 100 μm forskolin (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) was added, and 15 min later, samples were taken. Aliquots of 0.5 ml were added to 0.15 ml of an ice-cold solution containing 1 mHClO4 and 50 mm EDTA. The samples were shaken and placed on ice for 20 min. After centrifugation at 12,000 ×g for 1 min the supernatants were neutralized with a solution of 3 m KCl and 1.5 m triethanolamine. The supernatants were collected, and cAMP content was estimated by radioimmunoassay (Amersham Biosciences). The cytosolic free Ca2+ concentration was measured with fura-2. Synaptosomes were resuspended (2 mg/ml) in HBM with 16 μm BSA in the presence of 1.33 mmCaCl2 and 5 μm fura-2-acetoxymethyl ester (fura 2-AM) (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) and incubated at 37 °C for 25 min. After fura-2 loading, synaptosomes were pelleted and resuspended in fresh HBM medium with BSA. A 1-ml aliquot was transferred to a stirred cuvette containing 1.33 mmCaCl2, and the fluorescence was monitored at 340 and 510 nm. Data points were taken at 0.5-s intervals, and the cytoplasmic free Ca2+ concentration, [Ca2+]c, was calculated using the equations previously described (13.Herrero I. Vázquez E. Miras-Portugal M.T. Sánchez-Prieto J. Eur. J. Neurosci. 1996; 8: 700-709Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Synaptosomes in HBM (0.67 mg/ml) with 16 μm BSA were preincubated with 5 μm fura-2 AM and 1.33 mm CaCl2 for 1 h. The synaptosomal suspension was attached to a polylysine-coated coverslip for another hour. A superfusion chamber was carved in a small Petri dish and mounted on a Nikon inverted stage microscope. Medium was fed into the chamber by gravity at 1–1.5 ml/min from a prewarmed (37 °C) reservoir and continuously removed by aspiration. Synaptosomes were illuminated alternately at 340 and 380 nm for 0.8 s through a 100× objective with the aid of a monochromator (Kinetic Imaging, Ltd.) and the fluorescence emitted from the nerve terminals was collected through a band-pass filter centered at 510 nm. The video images were obtained using a slow-scan CCD camera (Hamamatsu C4880) operating at 12-bit digitalization (4096 levels), and the output from the camera was stored by a computerized imaging system (Kinetic Imaging, Ltd.). The [Ca2+]c was derived from theF340/F380 ratio using the equation derived by Grynkiewicz et al. (23.Grynkiewicz G. Poenie M. Tsien R.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 3440-3450Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Background images (without fura-2 fluorescence) atF340 and F380 were acquired and subtracted from each series of F340and F380 images. F340/380image ratios were obtained using Kinetic Imaging software. Ratio images were stored as 32-bit floating point number data, avoiding clipping by binary digitalization. Rmax andRmin parameters were determined from an in vitro calibration by recording fluorescence from small droplets of fura-2 (free acid, Molecular Probes) dissolved in intracellular solution (100 mm KCl, 10 mm NaCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 10 mm MOPS, and 10 μm fura-2, pH 7,0) plus 2 mmCaCl2 (saturated Ca2+) or 2 mm EGTA (0 Ca2+). Individual synaptosomes were identified as bright round spots in fluorescence images. A binary mask constructed by local equalization and thresholding of row images was applied to isolate round measuring areas, zeroing pixels outside of the bright spots; in this way, some synaptosomes are not analyzed, but never more than 5–10%. For [Ca2+]c measurements synaptosomes were stimulated by 10-s pulses (indicated in each graph by a bar) of 30 mm KCl in the absence and in the presence of pharmacological agonists or antagonists. Drugs were applied to the nerve terminals by switching the perfusion solution. The affinity-purified rabbit polyclonal antibody against mGluR7 used here have been described elsewhere (24.Shigemoto R. Kinoshita A. Wada E. Nomura S. Ohishi H. Takada M. Flor J.P. Neki A. Abe T. Nakanishi S. Mizuno N. J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 7503-7522Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and the monoclonal anti-synaptophysin antibody was obtained from (Sigma). To control the immunochemical reaction, primary antibodies were omitted from the staining procedure, whereupon no immunoreactivity resembling that obtained using the specific antibodies could be detected. The synaptosomes were allowed to attach to the polylysine-coated coverslip for an hour and then fixed during 5 min in 4% paraformaldehyde in 0.1 m phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, followed by several washes with 0.1 m phosphate buffer, pH 7.4. The synaptosomes were preincubated in 10% normal goat serum diluted in 50 mm Tris buffer, pH 7.4, containing 0.9% NaCl (TBS) with 0.2% Triton X-100 for 1 h. They were then incubated for 24 h with the affinity-purified polyclonal antibody against mGluR7 at a final protein concentration of 1–2 μg/ml and with a monoclonal antibody against synaptophysin diluted 1:1000 both in TBS containing 1% normal goat serum with 0.2% Triton X-100. After washes in TBS, the synaptosomes were incubated for 2 h in a goat anti-rabbit antibody coupled to the cyanine-derived fluorochrome Cy2 (Amersham Biosciences) and in a goat anti-mouse antibody coupled to Cy3 (Amersham Biosciences), the secondary antibodies diluted 1:200 in TBS. After several washes in TBS, the synaptosomes were cover-slipped with Fluoromount (Serva, Germany). The synaptosomes were viewed with a Nikon Diaphot microscope equipped with a 100× objective using a mercury lamp light source and fluorescein-rhodamine Nikon filter sets. ω-Conotoxin-GVIA (CgTx-GVIA) and ω-agatoxin-IVA (Aga-IVA) were from Peptide Institute, Inc., Osaka, Japan. l(+)-2-amino-4-phosphonobutyrate (l-AP4). (RS)-α-cyclopropyl-4-phosphonophenylglycine (CPPG), and (RS)-α-methyl-4-phosphonophenylglycine (MPPG) were from (Tocris Cookson, Bristol, UK). H-89, calmidazolium, ophiobolin A, and staurosporine were purchased from Roche Molecular Biochemicals. Bisindolylmaleimide I, hydrochloride was fromCalbiochem-Novabiochem. Sp-8-Br-cAMPS was from Biolog (Bremen, Germany). 4β-Phorbol 12,13-dibutyrate (4β-PDBu), 4α-phorbol 12,13-didecanoate (α-PDD), pertussis toxin, and NADP+were obtained from Sigma. All other reagents were from Sigma. Depolarization of nerve terminals with both KCl and the K+-channel blocker 4-aminopyridine (4AP) have been shown to open voltage-dependent Ca2+ channels and to induce the release of glutamate (25.Tibbs G.R. Barrie A.P. Van-Mieghem F.J.E. McMahon H.T. Nicholls D.G. J. Neurochem. 1989; 53: 1693-1699Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar). Although both KCl and 4AP induce glutamate release to a similar extent, they use different mechanisms, as demonstrated by the insensitivity of the KCl-induced release to the Na+-channel blocker tetrodotoxin (25.Tibbs G.R. Barrie A.P. Van-Mieghem F.J.E. McMahon H.T. Nicholls D.G. J. Neurochem. 1989; 53: 1693-1699Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar). The Ca2+-dependent release of glutamate after a 5-min depolarization with KCl and 4AP was 3.73 ± 0.13 (n = 17) and 3.89 ± 0.31 (n = 9) nmol of glutamate/mg ±S.E., respectively (Fig. 1, A and B). The prior addition of the group III mGluR agonist l-AP4 (1 mm) reduced this release to 2.78 ± 0.12 (n = 15) and 2.91 ± 0.17 (n = 8) (Fig. 1, A and B). Indeed, l-AP4 inhibited the KCl-induced release in a concentration-dependent manner. The EC50 value for inhibition was 309.4 μm (Fig. 1C), indicating that the receptor reducing glutamate release in cerebrocortical nerve terminals from adult rats exhibits much lower affinity for l-AP4 than that in young rats (EC50 2.3 μm) (13.Herrero I. Vázquez E. Miras-Portugal M.T. Sánchez-Prieto J. Eur. J. Neurosci. 1996; 8: 700-709Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Inhibition byl-AP4 was abolished by the group III mGluR antagonist CPPG (26.Jane D.E. Thomas N.K. Tse H-W. Watkins J.C. Neuropharmacology. 1996; 35: 1029-1035Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar) and was largely reduced by preincubation with pertussis toxin (PTx) (Fig. 1D), suggesting that Gi/oproteins are involved in this presynaptic mechanism. The calmodulin antagonists calmidazolium and ophiobolin A strongly reduced presynaptic inhibition by l-AP4 (Fig. 1D), consistent with recent evidence of calmodulin and βγ subunits binding to the intracellular carboxyl-terminal tail of group III mGluR7 in a mutually exclusive manner. Moreover, calmodulin antagonists prevent inhibition of excitatory transmission by these receptors (27.O'Connor V. El Far O. Bofill-Cardona E. Nanoff C. Freissmuth M. Karschin A. Airas J.M. Betz H. Boehm S. Science. 1999; 286: 1180-1184Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). The broad spectrum protein kinases inhibitor staurosporine and the more specific PKC and PKA inhibitors bisindolylmaleimide and H-89, respectively, did not alter the inhibition of release by l-AP4, suggesting that these kinases do not participate in the signaling pathway leading to the inhibition of release (Fig. 1D). Group III mGluRs reduce adenylylcyclase activity both in neuronal preparations (13.Herrero I. Vázquez E. Miras-Portugal M.T. Sánchez-Prieto J. Eur. J. Neurosci. 1996; 8: 700-709Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 16.Schoepp D.D. Jonhson B.G. Neurochem. Int. 1993; 22: 277-283Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar) as well as in heterologous expression systems (1.Tanabe Y. Nomura A. Masu M. Shigemoto R. Mizun N. Nakanishi S. J.

To determine whether a decrease in cAMP was responsible for the inhibition of glutamate release, we measured intrasynaptosomal cAMP levels. Basal cAMP levels (16.9 ± 2.4 pmol/mg ±S.E.,n = 5) were not modified either by l-AP4 (1 mm) (16.0 ± 2.8, n = 5) or by depolarization of synaptosomes with KCl plus l-AP4 to mimic release conditions (15.0 ± 2.9 pmol/mg ±S.E., n= 5) (Fig. 2). Therefore, it seems unlikely that the l-AP4 inhibition of evoked release is related to changes in cAMP levels. Another possible explanation for the inhibition of release by l-AP4-sensitive low affinity mGluRs is that the activity of Ca2+ channels is impaired. Given thatl-AP4 reduced both KCl (tetrodotoxin-insensitive)- and 4AP (tetrodotoxin-sensitive)-evoked release, it seem more likely that the inhibitory receptors targets release-coupled Ca2+ channels rather than ionic channels involved in the waveform of action potentials. To better understand the mechanism of release inhibition byl-AP4, we determined the changes in the cytoplasmic free calcium concentration [Ca2+]c with fura-2. The rise in [Ca2+]c induced by KCl depolarization was only slightly but significantly reduced by the prior addition ofl-AP4 (Fig. 3A). This effect was prevented by the presence of the group II/III mGluR antagonist MPPG (28.Jane D.E. Pittaway K. Sunter D.C. Thomas N.K. Watkins J.C. Neuropharmacology. 1995; 34: 851-856Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar) and also by the group III mGluR antagonist CPPG (26.Jane D.E. Thomas N.K. Tse H-W. Watkins J.C. Neuropharmacology. 1996; 35: 1029-1035Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Activating PKC with phorbol ester PDBu before l-AP4 addition also suppressed the inhibition of release. Glutamate release is primarily coupled to Ca2+ entry through both N and P/Q-type Ca2+-channels (29.Luebke J.I. Dunlap K. Turner T.J. Neuron. 1993; 11: 895-902Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar, 30.Mintz I.M. Sabatini B.L. Regehr W.G.

Neuropharmacology. 1995; 34: 1469-1478Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar, 32.Vázquez E. Sánchez-Prieto J. Eur. J. Neuroscience. 1997; 9: 2009-2018Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar), which can be selectively blocked by ω-CgTx-GVIA (33.Olivera B.M. Gray W.R. Zeikus R. Mcintosh J.M. River J. Santos V. Cruz L.L. Science. 1985; 230: 1338-1343Crossref PubMed Scopus (647) Google Scholar) and by ω-Aga-IVA (30.Mintz I.M. Sabatini B.L. Regehr W.G. Neuron. 1995; 15: 675-688Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (442) Google Scholar), respectively. To establish which type of Ca2+ channel was inhibited by the l-AP4-sensitive receptor, we examined glutamate release in the presence of these Ca2+ channel antagonists. The KCl-evoked release was reduced by ω-Aga-IVA (200 nm) and ω-CgTx-GVIA (2 μm) by 70.8 ± 8% S.E. (n = 3) and 25.0 ± 3.2%, respectively (Fig. 3, B and C). The reduction induced by ω-Aga-IVA was exacerbated by the presence of l-AP4 (88.3 ± 6.7% n = 3), unlike that induced by ω-CgTx-GVIA (27.1 ± 2.1%, n = 4), indicating that a different channel population is inhibited by ω-Aga-IVA and the receptor. The preferential inhibition of N-type Ca2+ channels by l-AP4 is consistent with the non-additive effects of l-AP4 and ω-CgTx-GVIA. The suppression of the inhibitory effects of presynaptic mGluRs mediated by PKC is a widespread phenomenon that occurs at many glutamatergic synapses (13.Herrero I. Vázquez E. Miras-Portugal M.T. Sánchez-Prieto J. Eur. J. Neurosci. 1996; 8: 700-709Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 34.Swartz K.J. Merritt A. Bean B.P. Lovinger D.M. Nature. 1993; 361: 165-168Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). Although the prior activation of PKC with phorbol esters completely suppressed the l-AP4 inhibition of evoked release, this suppression was not seen when protein kinase activity was inhibited with staurosporine (Fig. 4, A and B). The inactive phorbol ester α-PDD also failed to alter thel-AP4-induced reduction of glutamate release (Fig. 4B). PKC may mediate the suppression of the inhibitory activity of mGluRs by phosphorylation of the domains of the voltage-gated Ca2+-channel that interact with the βγ subunits of the inhibitory G-proteins (35.De Waard M. Liu H. Walker D. Scott V.E.S. Gurnett C.A. Campbell K.P. Nature. 1997; 385: 446-450Crossref PubMed Scopus (374) Google Scholar, 36.Zamponi G.W. Bourinet E. Nelson D. Nargeot J. Snutch T.P. Nature. 1997; 385: 442-446Crossref PubMed Scopus (406) Google Scholar). However, it has also recently been shown that PKC phosphorylates l-AP4-sensitive mGluR7 (37.Nakajima Y. Yamamoto T. Nakayama T. Nakanishi S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 24: 27573-27577Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (86) Google Scholar, 38.Dev K.K. Nakajima Y. Kitano J. Braithwaite S.P. Henley J.M. Nakanishi S. J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 7252-7257Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and that this phosphorylation suppresses receptor signaling (39.Macek T.A. Schaffhauser H. Conn P.J. J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 6138-6146Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Activation of group III mGluRs either in neuronal preparations or in heterologous expression systems decreases cAMP levels. Indeed, in cerebrocortical nerve terminals cAMP levels were increased by forskolin (100 μm) from 16.9 ± 2.4 to 127.4 ± 12.5 pmol/mg ±S.E. (n = 4). The increase in cAMP induced by forskolin was significantly reduced by l-AP4 (82.9 ± 10.1 pmol/mg ±S.E., n = 4) (Fig. 2). Although the further addition of KCl to mimic release conditions did not alter thel-AP4-induced decrease in cAMP (81.3 ± 8.4 pmol/mg ±S.E., n = 3). In addition, the inhibition of PKA activity with H-89 (10 μm) slightly enhanced cAMP levels in the presence of forskolin (146 ± 19.2 pmol/mg ±S.E.,n = 3) but did not alter the response tol-AP4 (102 ± 17.0 pmol/mg ±S.E., n = 3), excluding the possible negative feedback of PKA on this pathway (40.Cai Z. Saugstad J.A. Sorensen S.C. Ciombor K.J. Zhang C. Schaffhauser F. Hubalek F. Pohl J. Duvoisin R. Conn P.J. J. Neurochem. 2001; 78: 756-766Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). In contrast, the activation of PKC with phorbol esters (1 μm PDBu) largely suppressed the reduction in cAMP induced by l-AP4. Therefore, although the significance is unclear, in the presence of increased levels of cAMP,l-AP4-sensitive receptors decreased cAMP levels. It is possible that the decrease in cAMP mediated byl-AP4-sensitive mGluRs"

Cloning of the human Gαs gene and Gαs complementary DNAs showed that the short form of Gαs is distinguished from the long form by the exclusion of the 45-bp exon 3, which encodes 15 amino acids. Similar studies have pointed to the existence of two additional Gαs mRNA species. These isoforms may be produced by the use of an unusual alternative TG 3′-splice site, instead of the consensus AG 3′-splice site upstream of exon 4, resulting in the inclusion of an extra triplet coding for a serine residue after amino acids 87 and 72 of the long and short forms of Gαs, respectively (6Kozasa T. Itoh T. Tsukamoto T. Kaziro Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 2081-2085Crossref PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar) (Fig.1). It has been suggested that inclusion of this extra serine residue into Gαs proteins confers additional consensus sequence sites for phosphoregulation by protein kinases C and A (7Pyne N.J. Freissmuth M. Palmer S. Biochem. J. 1992; 285: 333-338Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 8Pyne N.J. Freissmuth M. Pyne S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Comm. 1992; 186: 1081-1086Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Tissue-dependent alternative splicing of the Gαs precursor transcript may therefore result in the expression of two long and two short forms of Gαs, depending upon the presence or absence of the extra serine residue. Initially, it was thought that these isoforms were the only splicing products of the Gαs gene; however, several other variants (reviewed in Ref. 9Novotny J. Svoboda P. J. Mol. Endocrinol. 1998; 20: 163-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar) have been observed involving the novel exons A and/or B upstream from exon 2, which are generated either by alternative splicing or by use of an alternative promoter. Remarkably, the use of an alternative TG 3′-splice site in splicing of human Gαs pre-mRNA appears to occur also inDrosophila melanogaster (10Quan F. Forte M.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 910-917Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In this organism, alternative splicing of intron 7 of the Gαs gene, involving the use of either a non-consensus TG or a consensus AG 3′-splice site, results in transcripts that code for either a long or short form of Gαs. These protein species differ by inclusion or exclusion of three amino acids and substitution of serine for a glycine residue. There is evidence to suggest that the various isoforms of Gαs have different regulatory functions. Sternweiset al. (11Sternweis P.C. Northup J.K. Smigel M.D. Gilman A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 11517-11526Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) used partially purified preparations of long and short isoforms of Gαs from rabbit liver and found that the larger species has a greater ability to support hormone-stimulated adenylyl cyclase activity. Yagami (12Yagami T. Mol. Pharmacol. 1995; 48: 849-854PubMed Google Scholar) studied the interaction of Gαs species with β-adrenergic receptors in liver plasma membranes and found that the receptors were preferentially coupled to the long Gαs isoform. More recently, Unson et al. (13Wu C.G. Unson T.P. Sakmar C.R. Merrifield R.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 21631-21638Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar) showed that the long and short forms of Gαsinteract differently with the glucagon receptor, such that specific coupling of the receptor to the long Gαs isoform results in 10-fold higher binding affinity for glucagon. Furthermore, there is substantial evidence that expression of alternatively spliced isoforms of Gαs differs in various tissues. For instance, the long form of Gαs predominates in cerebellum, cortex, kidney, adrenal medulla, and placenta, whereas the short form is predominant in platelets, liver, neostriatum, and heart (9Novotny J. Svoboda P. J. Mol. Endocrinol. 1998; 20: 163-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Dramatic changes in steady state mRNA and protein levels of Gαs isoforms have also been observed during ontogenetic development, aging, cellular differentiation, and pathophysiological states such as obesity, hypertension, diabetes, and alcoholism (9Novotny J. Svoboda P. J. Mol. Endocrinol. 1998; 20: 163-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Further evidence for variable isoform expression was obtained in the human myometrium, where short and long Gαs isoforms were found to be significantly increased during gestation and subsequently down-regulated during labor, associated with a concomitant increase and decrease in adenylyl cyclase activity (5Europe-Finner G.N. Phaneuf S. Mardon H.J. López Bernal A. J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. 1996; 81: 1069-1075Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 14Europe-Finner G.N. Phaneuf S. Tolkovsky A.M. Watson S.P. López Bernal A. J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. 1994; 79: 1835-1839Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The above observations support the premise that expression of alternative spliced isoforms of Gαs is regulated in a tissue-specific manner, depending on the activity requirements of the individual tissue or cell type and, as such, is controlled at the pre-mRNA processing level by the splicing machinery. However, the regulatory trans-acting factors and cis-elements involved in modulating expression of the four potential spliced isoforms of Gαs have not been elucidated. In general, alternative precursor mRNA splicing is regulated bytrans-acting splicing factors, which include the ubiquitously expressed small nuclear ribonucleoproteins, the serine/arginine-rich (SR)1family of nuclear phosphoproteins, and the heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoproteins (hnRNPs) (15Graveley B.R. RNA (N. Y.). 2000; 6: 1197-1211Crossref PubMed Scopus (884) Google Scholar, 16Smith C.W Valcarel J. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2000; 25: 381-388Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (758) Google Scholar). Variations in concentrations and ratios of specific splicing factors present in different cell types and tissues have also been shown to be a determinant in controlling pre-mRNA processing (17Caéceres J.F Krainer A.R. Krainer A.R. Eukaryotic mRNA Processing. IRL Press, Oxford1997: 174-212Google Scholar, 18Hanamura A. Caéceres J.F. Mayeda A. Franza Jr., B.R. Krainer A.R. RNA (N. Y.). 1998; 4: 430-444PubMed Google Scholar, 19Zahler A.M. Neugebauer K.M. Lane W.S. Roth M.B. Science. 1993; 260: 219-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar), and it has been suggested that individual splicing factors are specific for a particular pre-mRNA or the tissue type in which it is expressed. SF2/ASF, an SR protein family member, has been well characterized as a key factor involved in 5′-splice site determination in alternative splicing and has also been shown to affect 3′-splice site selection in vitro (20Bai Y. Yu D. Lee T. Chasin L.A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 27: 1126-1134Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 21Ge H. Manley J.L. Cell. 1990; 62: 25-34Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (348) Google Scholar, 22Krainer A.R. Conway G.C. Kozak D. Cell. 1990; 62: 35-42Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar). Several studies have shown that variations in the concentration of SF2/ASF can influence which 5′-splice site is selected (21Ge H. Manley J.L. Cell. 1990; 62: 25-34Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (348) Google Scholar, 22Krainer A.R. Conway G.C. Kozak D. Cell. 1990; 62: 35-42Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar, 23Caéceres J.F. Stamm S. Helfman D.M. Krainer A.R. Science. 1994; 265: 1706-1709Crossref PubMed Scopus (564) Google Scholar). hnRNPA1 has also been comprehensively studied in combination with SF2/ASF (24Mayeda A. Krainer A.R. Cell. 1992; 68: 365-375Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (588) Google Scholar, 25Mayeda A. Helfman D.M. Krainer A.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 2993-3001Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar, 26Yang X. Lu M.R. Bani S.J. Rowan S. Ben-David Y. Chabot B. Proc. Natl. Acad. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 6924-6928Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar), such that subtle changes in the concentrations of these two proteins can define the formation of different spliced mRNA isoforms derived from a number of precursor mRNA species. SF2/ASF and hnRNPA1 have an antagonistic relationship and can counteract each other in a concentration-dependent manner. Increased expression of SF2/ASF generally activates proximal (downstream) 5′-splice sites, whereas increased expression of hnRNPA1 usually activates distal (upstream) 5′-splice sites (23Caéceres J.F. Stamm S. Helfman D.M. Krainer A.R. Science. 1994; 265: 1706-1709Crossref PubMed Scopus (564) Google Scholar, 24Mayeda A. Krainer A.R. Cell. 1992; 68: 365-375Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (588) Google Scholar, 27Mayeda A. Screaton G.R. Fu S.D. Chandler X.-D. Krainer A.R. Mol. Cell Biol. 1999; 19: 1853-1863Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). This switching of splice site usage also occurs after overexpression of these proteins in vivo; when tested with a range of alternatively spliced reporter genes, the proteins promote the expected changes in exon skipping and inclusion (23Caéceres J.F. Stamm S. Helfman D.M. Krainer A.R. Science. 1994; 265: 1706-1709Crossref PubMed Scopus (564) Google Scholar, 26Yang X. Lu M.R. Bani S.J. Rowan S. Ben-David Y. Chabot B. Proc. Natl. Acad. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 6924-6928Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar, 28Wang J. Manley J.L. RNA (N. Y.). 1995; 1: 335-346PubMed Google Scholar). In this context, changes in the tissue levels of SF2/ASF and hnRNPA1 have recently been described by Pollard et al. (29Pollard A.J. Sparey C. Robson S.C. Krainer A.R. Europe-Finner G.N. J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. 2000; 85: 1928-1936PubMed Google Scholar), who demonstrated that expression of these specific splicing factors is both spatially and temporally regulated in the human myometrium during fetal maturation. This finding further supports the premise that concentration ratios of SF2/ASF to hnRNPA1 in vivo may therefore be critical in defining the expression of specific protein isoforms in different tissues. Several studies have also indicated that cis-acting elements within exons can function as splicing enhancers and contribute to the accuracy and efficiency of alternative splicing when bound by specific trans-acting factors (30Elrick L.L. Humphrey M.B. Cooper T.A. Berget S.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 343-352Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 31Humphrey M.B. Bryan J. Cooper T.A. Berget S.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 3979-3988Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar, 32Schaal T.D. Maniatis T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 1705-1719Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). Purine-rich splicing enhancer sequences (ESEs) have been identified in exons from a number of different tissue-specific or developmentally regulated precursor mRNA species (33Ichida M. Hatamata Y. Hayakawa M. Ueno E. Ikeda U. Shimada K. Hamamoto T. Kagawa Y. Endo H. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 15992-16001Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 34Tanaka K. Watakabe A. Shimura Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 1347-1354Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). These and other degenerate short RNA sequences, which are recognized by one or more SR proteins, are capable of influencing 5′- and 3′-splice site selection by affecting the activity of weak splice sites in adjacent introns (32Schaal T.D. Maniatis T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 1705-1719Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar, 35Liu H-X. Chew S.M. Cartegni L. Zhang M.Q. Krainer A.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 1063-1071Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar, 36Ramchatesingh J. Zahler A.M. Neugebauer K.M. Roth M.B. Cooper T.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 4898-4907Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). Consequently, to determine the trans-acting factors involved in regulating expression of alternatively spliced isoforms of Gαs in different cell types, we have designed a human Gαs minigene construct that incorporates intronic and exonic regulatory cis-elements associated with Gαs alternative splicing in vivo. Transfection of human myometrial smooth muscle cells and HeLa cells in culture with this Gαs minigene and plasmids coding for SF2/ASF and hnRNPA1, in conjunction with in vitro splicing assays, strongly implicate these antagonistic splicing factors in regulating Gαs expression in human tissues and cells. Overexpression of SF2/ASF and hnRNPA1 promoted inclusion and skipping of exon 3 of Gαs, respectively, which not only involved the use of the consensus AG 3′-splice site preceding exon 4 but also of an unusual TG 3′-splice site immediately upstream. Moreover, motif-prediction analysis based on randomization and functional selection of sequences with enhancer activity (37Liu H-X. Zhang M.Q. Krainer A.R. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 1998-2012Crossref PubMed Scopus (422) Google Scholar) enabled us to identify putative elements recognized by other members of the SR protein family in antagonizing hnRNPA1 to control long and short Gαs isoform expression. The Gαs minigene splicing construct (pcDNA3.1Gαs) was generated from human genomic DNA using specific Gαs PCR primers, containing specific restriction sites, for the individual exon/intron fragments of Gαs to facilitate the sequential insertion of each fragment into the pcDNA3.1 expression vector (Invitrogen), as shown in Fig. 2A. These primers amplify Gαs exons 2–4, together with truncated versions of their adjacent intronic sequences. The DNA sequence for the human Gαs gene has been described previously (6Kozasa T. Itoh T. Tsukamoto T. Kaziro Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 2081-2085Crossref PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar). Briefly, the first fragment, consisting of the 73-bp exon 2 and the first 87 bp (of 3258 bp) of intron 2, was amplified by PCR usingPfu polymerase with primers A and B (see Fig. 2Bfor full details of all primers used). The second fragment, consisting of the last 132 bp of intron 2, the 45-bp exon 3, and the first 85 bp (of 4547 bp) of intron 3, was then generated using primers C and D. The third fragment, consisting of the last 76 bp of intron 3 and the 55-bp exon 4, was amplified using primers E and F. PCR products were individually cloned into the TOPO®-TA cloning vector (Invitrogen) and sequenced to confirm exon/intron DNA sequences and ensure that the necessary cis-acting regulatory signals were present. Each Gαs fragment was then subcloned sequentially into pcDNA3.1 by repeated restriction digestion and ligation using T4 DNA ligase (Promega) as shown in Fig. 2A to generate the complete pcDNA3.1Gαs minigene splicing construct, which is under transcriptional control of the cytomegalovirus promoter (Fig. 2A, P1) and contains the bGH polyadenylation signal. Plasmids encoding splicing factors SF2/ASF (pCG-SF2) and hnRNPA1 (pCG-A1) have been described (23Caéceres J.F. Stamm S. Helfman D.M. Krainer A.R. Science. 1994; 265: 1706-1709Crossref PubMed Scopus (564) Google Scholar). Both primary myometrial smooth muscle cell cultures and an immortalized myometrial cell line (PHM1-41) were used in this study. The PHM1-41 smooth muscle cells (provided by Professor B. M. Sanborn, University of Texas) were originally isolated from the myometrium of a pregnant woman and immortalized using a replication-defective adenovirus vector expressing E6 and E7 proteins from human papillomavirus HPV16 (38Ku M. Monga C.Y. Dodge K. Sanborn B.M. Biol. Reprod. 1996; 55: 427-432Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Samples of myometrial tissue were obtained from pregnant women undergoing elective caesarean section at term. Written consent was obtained from all women, and ethical approval was granted by the Newcastle and North Tyneside Health Authority Ethics Committee. Myometrial samples were taken from the upper corpus region (termed upper segment) and from close to the cervix (termed lower uterine segment). Primary myocyte isolation and culture were essentially as described by Phaneuf et al. (39Phaneuf S. Europe-Finner G.N. Varney M. MacKenzie I.Z. Watson S.P. López Bernal A. J. Endocrinol. 1993; 136: 497-509Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). Primary myocytes were cultured with complete d-valine medium (Invitrogen), whereas the immortalized pregnant human myometrial cells (PHM1-41) and HeLa cells were cultured in Dulbecco’s Glutamax II modified Eagle’s medium (Sigma), supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, penicillin (1 unit/ml), and streptomycin (1 ng/ml), and cultured in T75 flasks under standard conditions at 37 °C with 5% CO2. The culture medium for PHM1-41 cells contained additional supplements of 4.5 g/ml glucose and 50 μg/ml G418 (Invitrogen). All transfection experiments on primary myometrial cells were undertaken on subculture passages 2–3. Myometrial and HeLa cells were co-transfected, at 60–70% confluency (in the absence of antibiotics) using Mirus LT-1 (Cambridge Bioscience) or TransFastTM (Promega) cationic-lipid transfection reagents with 3 μg of pcDNA3.1Gαs and 3 μg of pCG-SF2, pCG-A1, or pCG control vector. Transfection efficiencies were in the range of 25–30% for all experiments, as determined by transfection with a β-galactosidase-encoding plasmid, pcDNA3.1LacZ (Invitrogen) (data not shown). Cells were harvested either 48 h (HeLa cells) or 72 h (myometrial cells) after transfection, using trypsin (0.5 g/liter)-EDTA (0.2 g/liter). Confirmation that the pcDNA3.1Gαs minigene plasmid contained the necessary cis-acting regulatory signals for efficient pre-mRNA splicing was obtained by runoff transcription using a mMESSAGE-mMACHINE capping/transcription kit (described below) and RT-PCR of the Gαs spliced products from total RNA extracted from PHM1-41 cells post-transfection. Transfection efficiencies were further confirmed by Western immunoblotting using monoclonal antibodies to SF2/ASF (mAb96) and hnRNPA1 (4B10), both of which have been described (18Hanamura A. Caéceres J.F. Mayeda A. Franza Jr., B.R. Krainer A.R. RNA (N. Y.). 1998; 4: 430-444PubMed Google Scholar, 40Piñol-Roma S. Choi Y.D. Matunis M.J. Dreyfuss G. Genes Dev. 1988; 2: 215-227Crossref PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar). Endogenous levels of SF2/ASF and hnRNPA1 in myometrial cells and HeLa cells were also calculated by this procedure. Briefly, SDS-PAGE was performed under standard conditions using equal amounts of cell homogenate solubilized in 0.5 m Tris, 5 murea, 2.5% SDS, and 3% β-mercaptoethanol and resolved on 12% polyacrylamide gels. Immunoreactive bands were detected by enhanced chemiluminescence (Amersham Biosciences). Gαs mRNA splice variants generated from the minigene in transfected cells were analyzed by RT-PCR. Total RNA was isolated from individual transfection experiments, fresh pregnant myometrial tissue, or cultured cells, using SV total RNA isolation kits, as recommended by the manufacturer (Promega) and first strand cDNA synthesized from 1–3 μg of RNA using 20 units of Superscript II reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen) with 100 ng of oligo(dT)16 as primer. PCR amplification was carried out with 2–4 μl of cDNA template with the Gαs sense primer for exon 2 (primer A) and reverse primer for exon 4 (primer F) that have 8 and 14 terminal nucleotides, respectively, derived from the pcDNA3.1Gαs minigene construct and amplifying all four mRNA isoforms generated from pcDNA3.1Gαs, although not endogenous Gαs mRNA transcripts (see Fig.3A, lanes 2 and3). PCR was performed under standard conditions with an initial hot start cycle at 94 °C (4 min), 50 °C (30 s), and 72 °C (1 min), followed by 18–24 cycles at 94 °C (1 min), 50 °C (30 s), and 72 °C (1 min). Reactions were terminated in the exponential phase in order to determine the relative ratios of individual Gαs mRNA species. PCR products were analyzed by 2% agarose gel electrophoresis. Note that the long Gαs isoform results in a PCR product of 195 bp, which includes the 8 extra nucleotides on primer A and 14 extra nucleotides on primer F plus 173 bp of exons 2, 3, and 4, whereas the short Gαs isoform results in a product of 150 bp because of exclusion of the 45 bp of exon 3. Long or short Gαsisoforms that included or lacked the extra CAG triplet at the 3′-end of intron 3 could not be resolved under these electrophoretic conditions. Therefore, to further analyze the relative abundance of each spliced variant of Gαs, the sense Gαs primer A was end-labeled with [γ-32P]ATP by polynucleotide kinase (Promega) prior to PCR amplification. The use of the alternative TG 3′-splice site upstream of exon 4 (Fig. 1) generates the Gαs-short variant with three additional CAG nucleotides, creating a unique BsmA1 endonuclease restriction site (see Fig. 5A) as described previously (41Granneman J.G Bannon M.J. J. Neurochem. 1991; 57: 1019-1023Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Thus, the two Gαs-short mRNA variants with and without the CAG triplet can be distinguished from each other by restriction analysis. A 10-μl aliquot of each radiolabeled PCR product was digested withBsmA1 at 55 °C, analyzed by PAGE on 6 or 8% acrylamide, 7 m urea gels, and visualized by autoradiography. The different banding patterns were quantified by scanning densitometry using a UMAX PS2400 scanner at 700 dots per inch coupled to the Intelligent Quantifier software from BioImage (Ann Arbor, MI).Figure 5Effect of SF2/ASF and hnRNPA1 on Gαs isoform expression.

GAPDH-specific oligonucleotide exon primers (spanning a short 104-bp intron) were also designed as control primers for use in RT-PCR with each cDNA sample. DNA sequences for the GAPDH primers were CTGCCGTCTAGAAAAACC and CCACC- TTCGTTGTCATACC. To generate transcripts forin vitro splicing, the pcDNA3.1Gαsminigene plasmid, which also harbors a T7 promoter (Fig. 2A,P2) was linearized with PmeI. GpppG-capped and [α-32P]UTP-labeled pre-mRNA substrate (Fig.3A, lane 1) was synthesized by runoff transcription using a mMESSAGE-mMACHINE capping/transcription kit with T7 RNA polymerase (Ambion, Inc.). In vitro splicing assays were undertaken essentially as described (42Mayeda A. Krainer A.R. Methods Mol. Biol. 1999; 118: 315-321PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, 25–30 fmol of radiolabeled precursor mRNA was incubated for 4 h at 30 °C with 10 μl of HeLa nuclear extract supplemented with 15–25 pmol of SF2/ASF, SC35, or hnRNPA1 recombinant proteins, which were expressed and purified as described (27Mayeda A.

Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 1998-2012Crossref PubMed Scopus (422) Google Scholar). The MgCl2 concentration was 3.5 mm. The RNA products generated from splicing in vitro were then fractionated by denaturing polyacrylamide electrophoresis followed by autoradiography. Transient co-transfection experiments were performed on primary myometrial cell cultures, immortalized myometrial cells (PHM1-41), and HeLa cells to evaluate the effect of increased levels of SF2/ASF and hnRNPA1 on the expression of spliced variants of Gαs in these different cell types. The nuclear abundance of SF2/ASF and hnRNPA1 in HeLa cells has been calculated previously at 3 × 107 copies/cell for SF2/ASF and 6–7 × 107 copies/cell for hnRNPA1 (18Hanamura A. Caéceres J.F.

Western immunoblotting using equal amounts of protein lysate (200/400 μg) from myometrial/PHM1-41 smooth muscle cells and HeLa cell cultures was undertaken to determine the relative abundance of SF2/ASF and hnRNPA1 mRNA in myometrial cells compared with HeLa cells (Fig.4, A and B). SF2/ASF levels in both primary myometrial cell cultures and PHM1-41 smooth muscle cells were calculated to be 42% of that found in HeLa cells with a calculated estimate of 1.3 × 107copies/cell, whereas the abundance of hnRNPA1 in myometrial cells/PHM1-41 smooth muscle cells was 59% of that found in HeLa cells with a calculated estimate of 3.8 × 1"

Together, these observations indicate that vinexin β plays a key role in regulating the anchorage dependence of ERK2 activation through PKA-PAK signaling. extracellular signal-regulated kinase mitogen-activated protein kinase MAPK/ERK kinase epidermal growth factor p21-activated kinase c-Jun N-terminal kinase green fluorescent protein cAMP-dependent protein kinase regulatory domain Cell attachment to the extracellular matrix and stimulation by soluble growth factors coordinately regulate numerous cellular events, including cell proliferation. Normal cells require both cell adhesion to the appropriate extracellular matrix and stimulation by growth factors for cell proliferation. Loss of this anchorage dependence of cell proliferation leads to cell malignant transformation (1.Benecke B.J. Ben-Ze'ev A. Penman S.

Extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK),1 also known as MAPK, is likely to be the most important molecule for regulating the anchorage dependence of cell proliferation. Activation of ERK by growth factor stimuli is a prerequisite for cell proliferation and is also anchorage-dependent (5.Johnson G.L. Vaillancourt R.R. Curr. Opin.

In adherent cells, soluble growth factors such as epidermal growth factor (EGF) stimulate their receptor tyrosine kinase, leading to GTP loading of Ras, which in turn activates the Raf-MEK-ERK kinase cascade. Activated ERK then stimulates the transcription of growth-related genes such as c-fosthrough the activation of transcription factors. However, in non-adherent cells, the activation of ERK by growth factor stimuli is barely detectable and is not sufficient for cell proliferation. Integrins and downstream molecules have been reported to be involved in the anchorage dependence of ERK activation. Antibody-mediated engagement and clustering of integrin α5β1 on suspended cells mimic anchorage-dependent signals (7.Miyamoto S. Teramoto H. Gutkind J.S. Yamada K.M. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 1633-1642Crossref PubMed Scopus (676) Google Scholar). Other integrin α-chains also transmit anchorage-dependent signals (12.Aplin A.E. Short S.M. Juliano R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 31223-31228Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Recently, the constitutively active forms of focal adhesion kinase and p21-activated kinase (PAK), which are localized at focal adhesions or focal complexes and function as downstream mediators of integrin signals (13.Richardson A.

Although focal adhesion and its components are likely to play important roles in regulating the anchorage dependence of ERK activation, the detailed mechanisms of this regulation remain to be determined. Vinexin is localized at focal adhesions and cell-cell junctions (19.Kioka N. Sakata S. Kawauchi T. Amachi T. Akiyama S.K. Okazaki K. Yaen C. Yamada K.M. Aota S. J.

Vinexin is transcribed into at least two isoforms, vinexins α and β, both of which contain a common carboxyl-terminal sequence containing three SH3 domains. The first and second SH3 domains bind to vinculin (19.Kioka N. Sakata S. Kawauchi T. Amachi T. Akiyama S.K. Okazaki K. Yaen C. Yamada K.M. Aota S. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 144: 59-69Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar), and the third SH3 domain binds to Sos, a guanine nucleotide exchange factor for Ras and Rac (27.Akamatsu M. Aota S. Suwa A.

Expression of vinexin enhances actin cytoskeletal organization and cell spreading as well as growth factor-induced c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) activation, whereas it does not affect ERK activation in adherent cells (27.Akamatsu M.

These observations suggest that vinexin β plays roles in regulating both cell adhesion and growth factor signaling, although whether vinexin β is involved in the coordinated regulation of cell adhesion and growth factor signaling or the anchorage dependence of signal transduction is unknown. Vinculin, the binding partner of vinexin, has also been reported to be involved in the anchorage dependence of cell proliferation (28.Ben-Ze'ev A. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 99-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar, 29.Rodriguez Fernandez J.L. Geiger B. Salomon D. Ben-Ze'ev A. J.

Cell Biol. 1992; 119: 427-438Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). This raises the possibility that vinexin may function at a convergence point of cell adhesion and growth factor signaling and contribute to regulation of the anchorage dependence of signal transduction. Here, we examined the function of vinexin β in regulating the anchorage dependence of ERK activation. Our results indicate that vinexin β plays a role in PAK-mediated anchorage-dependent signaling. The expression plasmids for FLAG-tagged vinexin β and the mutant of the third SH3 domain of FLAG-tagged vinexin β (3rdSH3WF) were described previously (19.Kioka N. Sakata S. Kawauchi T. Amachi T.

Mutations of the first SH3 domain (substitution of tryptophan 76 with phenylalanine, 1stSH3WF) and of the second SH3 domain (substitution of tryptophan 150 with phenylalanine, 2ndSH3WF) of vinexin β were introduced by PCR-based methods, respectively. The first and second SH3 domain double mutant (1st2ndSH3WF) was constructed as follows. 1stSH3WF was digested with EcoRI and NcoI, and 2ndSH3WF was digested with NcoI and XbaI. The two digested fragments were ligated into the EcoRI/XbaI sites of p401F (19.Kioka N. Sakata S. Kawauchi T. Amachi T. Akiyama S.K. Okazaki K. Yaen C. Yamada K.M. Aota S. J.

To make Δ3SH3 (amino acids 1–271), N-Half (amino acids 1–172), C-Half (amino acids 173–328), and ΔLinker (amino acids 1–172, 252–328), the corresponding regions of vinexin β were amplified by PCR and then subcloned into p401F. All plasmids generated by PCR were confirmed by DNA sequencing. Plasmids containing N17Cdc42 (31.Coso O.A. Chiariello M. Yu J.C. Teramoto H. Crespo P. Xu N. Miki T. Gutkind J.S.

The plasmid containing PAK/RD (32.Osada S. Izawa M. Koyama T. Hirai S. Ohno S. FEBS Lett. 1997; 404: 227-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar) was a generous gift from Drs. S. Hirai and S. Ohno (Yokohama City University, Yokohama, Japan). The GFP-tagged ERK2 expression plasmid was constructed by subcloning ERK2 cDNA from pCG-HA-ERK2 (33.Kim K. Nose K. Shibanuma M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 20685-20692Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar), provided by Dr. K. Nose (Showa University, Tokyo, Japan), into pGZ21 (19.Kioka N. Sakata S.

Anti-FLAG epitope monoclonal antibody M2, anti-phospho-ERK MAPK antibody, and anti-ERK2 antibody were obtained from Sigma, New England Biolabs Inc., and Santa Cruz Biotechnology, respectively. NIH3T3 cells were cultured with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% calf serum. NIH3T3 cells were transfected with GFP-ERK2 and other expression plasmids using LipofectAMINE Plus (Invitrogen). Transfected cells were then serum-starved by incubation with medium containing 0.5% calf serum for 20 h. For experiments in cell suspension, cells were detached by trypsinization, washed twice with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 2 mg/ml soybean trypsin inhibitor, and resuspended in OPTI-MEM®I reduced serum medium (Invitrogen) containing 0.2% bovine serum albumin. In some experiments, the PKA inhibitor H89 (Sigma) was added to the media. Cells were incubated in suspension with gentle rocking for 3 h. Adherent and suspended cells were stimulated by the addition of 100 ng/ml EGF for 5 min. ERK2 activity was determined by two different methods. To determine the activation (phosphorylated) state of ERK2, immunoblotting with anti-active ERK (phospho-ERK) antibody was performed as described (27.Akamatsu M. Aota S. Suwa A. Ueda K. Amachi T. Yamada K.M. Akiyama S.K. Kioka N. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 35933-35937Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Briefly, EGF-stimulated or quiescent cells were solubilized at 4 °C in lysis buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 150 mm NaCl, 1.0% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 1 mmsodium vanadate, 50 mm NaF, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 20 nm calyculin A, 20 μg/ml aprotinin, 20 μg/ml leupeptin, 5 mm benzamidine, and 40 mm β-glycerophosphate. The cell lysates were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotted using anti-active ERK antibody. To determine ERK2 activity directly, an immune complex kinase assay (34.Chen Q. Kinch M.S. Lin T.H. Burridge K. Juliano R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 26602-26605Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) was used with minor modifications. Briefly, cell lysates were prepared as described above. GFP-tagged ERK2 were immunoprecipitated with anti-GFP antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Immune complexes were then resuspended in 100 μl of kinase reaction mixture containing 25 mm HEPES (pH 8.0), 10 mmMgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mmbenzamidine, 30 μg of myelin basic protein, 50 μmunlabeled ATP, and 1 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP. After incubation at 30 °C for 20 min, kinase reaction products were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and autoradiography. Quantitation was performed using a BAS2000 image analyzer (Fuji Photo Film Co.). To determine whether vinexin β is involved in the anchorage dependence of ERK2 activation, we first generated GFP-tagged ERK2 to allow detection of activated ERK2 in cotransfection experiments. Activated GFP-ERK2 can be separated from endogenous ERK2 by SDS-PAGE without immunoprecipitation and detected using anti-active ERK antibody because GFP-ERK2 migrates slower on SDS-polyacrylamide gel than endogenous ERK2. Expressed GFP-ERK2 was strongly activated by EGF stimulation in adherent NIH3T3 cells, but was barely activated in suspended cells, similar to endogenous or hemagglutinin-tagged ERK2 (Fig. 1, A, C, and D; and data not shown). An immune complex kinase assay for GFP-ERK2 verified the results obtained by Western blotting using anti-active ERK antibody (see Fig. 2A and data not shown). These observations indicate that both GFP-ERK2 and endogenous ERK2 respond to EGF in an anchorage-dependent manner in NIH3T3 cells and that GFP-ERK2 behaves naturally.Figure 2Vinexin induces the anchorage-independent activation of GFP-ERK2 activity.A, GFP-ERK2 was cotransfected with vector alone or FLAG-tagged vinexin β into NIH3T3 cells. Cells were then serum-starved and maintained on tissue culture plates (adherent (Adh)) or were placed in suspension (Sus) for 3 h before stimulation with 100 ng/ml EGF for 5 min as indicated. Two μg of lysates were directly immunoblotted (IB) with anti-ERK2 antibody (lower panel) to verify expression of GFP-ERK2. The remaining lysates (200 μg) were immunoprecipitated with anti-GFP antibody, and the immune complexes were subjected to ERK2 kinase assay using myelin basic protein as a substrate. The phosphorylated substrates were resolved by SDS-PAGE and visualized by autoradiography (upper panel). B, quantitation of the GFP-ERK2 kinase assays is shown graphically. Values are expressed as -fold increase with respect to EGF-stimulated vector-transfected adherent cells and represent the means ± S.D. from four independent experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Using GFP-ERK2, we determined the effects of vinexin β on the anchorage dependence of ERK2 activation in NIH3T3 cells. GFP-ERK2 was efficiently activated by EGF stimulation in adherent cells, but was barely activated in suspended cells, as described above. However, expression of vinexin β permitted ERK2 activation in suspended cells to 50% of the levels in adherent cells (Fig. 1, A and B). Interestingly, expression of vinexin β did not activate ERK2 without EGF stimulation or alter ERK2 activity in adherent cells (Fig. 1, A and B), consistent with our previous report (27.Akamatsu M. Aota S. Suwa A. Ueda K. Amachi T. Yamada K.M. Akiyama S.K. Kioka N. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 35933-35937Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). To confirm the results obtained with anti-active ERK antibody, we performed an immune complex kinase assay for detecting GFP-ERK2 activity (Fig. 2). Again, expression of vinexin β increased the EGF-induced ERK2 activity in suspended cells (p < 0.05), but had no effect in adherent cells (Fig. 2). These observations suggest that vinexin β is involved in the anchorage dependence of ERK2 activation. To verify that vinexin β does not activate ERK2 directly, various concentrations of EGF were used to stimulate NIH3T3 cells transfected with vector alone or FLAG-tagged vinexin β under adherent conditions (Fig. 1C). Vinexin β-transfected cells showed the same ability to activate ERK2 as vector-transfected cells at any concentration of EGF under adherent conditions. These results suggest that vinexin β is involved in the anchorage dependence of ERK2 activation rather than in the direct activation of ERK2. We examined the duration of the anchorage-independent ERK2 activation induced by expression of vinexin β. NIH3T3 cells transfected with FLAG-tagged vinexin β were incubated in suspension for various times and then stimulated with EGF. As shown in Fig. 1D, ERK2 could not be activated in the vector-transfected cells after incubation in suspension for 3 or 5 h. In contrast, ERK2 was activated to some degree in vinexin β-transfected cells even after incubation in suspension for 5 h. This observation indicates that expression of vinexin β can sustain the capacity for EGF-induced ERK2 activation in suspension. Furthermore, to confirm that cells incubated in suspension for 3 h were still alive and not dead due to anoikis, cells incubated in suspension for 3 h were allowed to re-adhere to tissue culture plates and then stimulated with EGF. These cells showed EGF-induced ERK2 activation equivalent to cells continuously maintained in adherent culture (data not shown), suggesting that vinexin β is involved in the anchorage dependence of ERK2 activation and not in preventing anoikis under these conditions. Altogether, these observations show that expression of vinexin β can substitute for cell adhesion at least partially and that it allows anchorage-independent ERK2 activation in response to EGF. The first and second SH3 domains of vinexin β bind to vinculin, and the third SH3 domain binds to Sos. Therefore, we first used mutants of each SH3 domain of vinexin β to test whether any of these domains might be involved in the anchorage independence of ERK2 activation (Fig. 3). All mutants were expressed at similar levels compared with wild-type vinexin β in NIH3T3 cells (data not shown). As shown in Fig. 3, expression of vinexin β with a mutation in the third SH3 domain (3rdSH3WF) allowed ERK2 activation induced by EGF stimulation in suspension. We next tested mutants of the first SH3 domain (1stSH3WF), the second SH3 domain (2ndSH3WF), and both domains (1st2ndSH3WF), which show reduced vinculin-binding ability. 2S. Aizawa and N. Kioka, unpublished data. All of these mutants also permitted ERK2 activation in an anchorage-independent manner (Fig. 3). These observations suggest that the functions of SH3 domains are dispensable for the anchorage-independent ERK2 activation induced by expression of vinexin β. To identify the functional domain of vinexin β involved in anchorage-independent ERK2 activation, we constructed various deletion mutants of vinexin β (Fig. 4A). The mutants were expressed at comparable levels in NIH3T3 cells, except the C-Half mutant, which was significantly expressed at low levels (data not shown). The Δ3SH3 and C-Half mutants lack the third SH3 domain or the first and second SH3 domains, respectively. Both mutants contain a linker region between the second and third SH3 domains (Fig. 4A). These mutants allowed ERK2 activation in suspended cells (Fig. 4B). The effect of Δ3SH3 on the anchorage independence of ERK2 activation was significantly greater than that of wild-type vinexin β. In contrast, the N-Half and ΔLinker mutants, which lack the linker region, failed to activate ERK2 in suspended cells. Furthermore, these deletion mutants slightly but significantly reduced the efficient activation of ERK2 even in adherent cells (Figs. 4B and 5C), possibly by dominant-negative blockade of cell adhesion signals, whereas the mutants containing the linker region (Δ3SH3 and C-Half) permitted increased ERK2 activation under the same conditions (Fig. 4B). These results indicate that the linker region between the second and third SH3 domains plays important roles in supporting anchorage-independent ERK2 activation in response to EGF stimulation and that Δ3SH3 and ΔLinker function as an active and a negative mutant, respectively.Figure 5Vinexin β is involved in anchorage-dependent ERK2 activation regulated by the PKA-PAK pathway.A, GFP-ERK2 was cotransfected with vector alone, the active mutant of vinexin β (Δ3SH3), or the dominant-inhibitory mutant of PAK (PAK/RD) into NIH3T3. Cells were incubated for 3 h on tissue culture plates (adherent (Adh)) or in suspension (Sus). Cell lysates were immunoblotted using anti-active ERK (phospho-ERK (p-ERK)) antibody to detect the activated forms of GFP-ERK2 and anti-ERK2 antibody to detect total GFP-ERK2 protein. B, shown are the dose-dependent effects of the PKA-specific inhibitor H89. NIH3T3 cells were incubated for 3 h on tissue culture plates or in suspension with or without the indicated concentrations of H89. Cell lysates were immunoblotted using anti-active ERK and anti-ERK2 antibodies. Note that two bands were detected using anti-active ERK antibody because endogenously expressed ERK was detected in this experiment. C, NIH3T3 cells were cotransfected with GFP-ERK2 and vector or FLAG-tagged mutant vinexin β (ΔLinker). Cells were incubated with or without H89 (25 μm) and then treated as described for A. Cell lysates were immunoblotted (IB) using anti-active ERK and anti-ERK2 antibodies. Results representative of at least three independent experiments are shown.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) We next searched for proteins that may link vinexin β and the anchorage dependence of ERK2 activation. We first determined the effect of vinexin β or Δ3SH3 on focal adhesion kinase, which has been implicated in the anchorage dependence of ERK activation (18.Renshaw M.W. Price L.S. Schwartz M.A. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 147: 611-618Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). However, expression of vinexin β did not affect the protein levels and tyrosine phosphorylation of GFP-tagged focal adhesion kinase both in adherent and suspended cells (data not shown). The active form of Cdc42 has been demonstrated to enhance EGF-induced ERK activation in suspended cells and to control the anchorage requirement for cell proliferation (35.Qiu R.G. Abo A. McCormick F. Symons M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 3449-3458Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar,36.Aplin A.E. Juliano R.L. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 695-706Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Under our experimental conditions, expression of a dominant-negative mutant of Cdc42 (17NCdc42) significantly blocked EGF-induced ERK2 activation in adherent cells, possibly by blocking cell adhesion signals, but did not block the anchorage-independent ERK2 activation induced by expression of vinexin β (data not shown). These observations suggest that neither focal adhesion kinase nor Cdc42 mediates the function of vinexin β in regulating the anchorage dependence of ERK2 activation. PAK is a direct effector of Rac and Cdc42 (37.Knaus U.G. Bokoch G.M. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1998; 30: 857-862Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar, 38.Manser E. Leung T. Salihuddin H. Zhao Z.S. Lim L. Nature. 1994; 367: 40-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (1298) Google Scholar) and was recently reported to regulate the anchorage dependence of ERK2 activation induced by soluble growth factors (17.Howe A.K. Juliano R.L. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 593-600Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). We hypothesized that PAK, rather than focal adhesion kinase or Cdc42, may function downstream of vinexin β in anchorage-dependent ERK2 activation. To test this hypothesis, we cotransfected the dominant-inhibitory mutant of PAK (PAK/RD) (32.Osada S. Izawa M. Koyama T. Hirai S. Ohno S. FEBS Lett. 1997; 404: 227-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar) with active vinexin β (Δ3SH3). As shown in Fig. 5A, expression of PAK/RD alone significantly blocked the efficient activation of ERK2 in response to EGF stimulation both in adherent and suspended cells, indicating that PAK/RD blocks the signals from cell adhesion, as reported previously (17.Howe A.K. Juliano R.L. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 593-600Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). PAK/RD also substantially inhibited the anchorage-independent activation of ERK2 induced by expression of Δ3SH3. This observation suggests that vinexin β functions upstream of PAK activation. Recently, PKA has been shown to be activated in cells in suspension and that activated PKA negatively regulates PAK activity, leading to inhibition of ERK2 activation in suspended cells (17.Howe A.K. Juliano R.L. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 593-600Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). On the other hand, inhibition of PKA allows PAK and ERK2 activation in an anchorage-independent manner (17.Howe A.K. Juliano R.L. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 593-600Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). To determine whether vinexin β is involved in the PKA-PAK signaling pathway leading to anchorage-dependent ERK2 activation, NIH3T3 cells were treated with H89, a specific inhibitor of PKA. H89-treated NIH3T3 cells allowed ERK2 activation even in suspension in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 5B), indicating that PKA also regulates the anchorage dependence of ERK2 activation under our experimental conditions. Expression of a negative mutant of vinexin β (ΔLinker) blocked the anchorage-independent activation of ERK2 induced by H89 treatment (Fig. 5C). These results indicate that vinexin β functions downstream of PKA and is necessary for regulation of the anchorage dependence of ERK2 activation. We have recently identified vinexin β as a novel focal adhesion protein that binds to vinculin and regulates cell adhesion and growth factor-mediated signaling (19.Kioka N. Sakata S. Kawauchi T.

Here, we have shown that vinexin β is involved in the anchorage dependence of ERK2 activation induced by EGF. This conclusion was supported by three lines of evidence. First, we found that ERK2 was activated efficiently in vinexin β-transfected cells even in suspension, but minimally in non-transfected cells in suspension. Interestingly, when cells were attached, expression of vinexin β did not affect ERK2 activation stimulated by any concentration of EGF tested. Second, a negative mutant of vinexin β (ΔLinker) suppressed the anchorage-independent ERK2 activation elicited by inhibition of PKA as well as ERK2 activation in adherent cells. Third, the anchorage-independent ERK2 activation induced by vinexin β was inhibited by a dominant-negative mutant of PAK, which is known to play a role in the anchorage dependence of ERK2 activation (17.Howe A.K. Juliano R.L. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 593-600Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar, 32.Osada S. Izawa M. Koyama T. Hirai S. Ohno S. FEBS Lett. 1997; 404: 227-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). These observations indicate that vinexin β is involved in the anchorage dependence of ERK2 activation. In this study, we demonstrated that vinexin β functions upstream of PAK for regulating the anchorage dependence of ERK2 activation. PAK activation itself has been shown to be anchorage-dependent (17.Howe A.K. Juliano R.L. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 593-600Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar, 39.del Pozo M.A. Price L.S. Alderson N.B. Ren X.D. Schwartz M.A. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 2008-2014Crossref PubMed Scopus (405) Google Scholar), whereas constitutively active PAK allows anchorage-independent ERK2 activation (17.Howe A.K. Juliano R.L. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 593-600Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). Therefore, regulation of PAK activity is likely to play a role in the anchorage dependence of ERK2 activation. PAK is activated by binding with GTP-bound Cdc42 or Rac (38.Manser E. Leung T. Salihuddin H. Zhao Z.S. Lim L. Nature. 1994; 367: 40-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (1298) Google Scholar, 40.Daniels R.H. Bokoch G.M. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1999; 24: 350-355Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar) and by binding with other PAK-binding proteins (41.Lu W. Katz S. Gupta R. Mayer B.J. Curr. Biol. 1997; 7: 85-94Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar, 42.Daniels R.H. Zenke F.T. Bokoch G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 6047-6050Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). PAK-binding proteins, including Nck and PIX, have been shown to activate PAK through physical interaction and/or recruitment of PAK to the membrane (41.Lu W. Katz S. Gupta R. Mayer B.J. Curr. Biol. 1997; 7: 85-94Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar, 42.Daniels R.H. Zenke F.T. Bokoch G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 6047-6050Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Human vinexin (GenBankTM/EBI accession number AF037261) was also reported to bind to PAK in the GenBankTM/EBI Data Bank. Therefore, one possible mechanism for regulating the anchorage dependence of ERK2 activation by vinexin β is that vinexin β may support the efficient activation of PAK by binding or recruiting it to the membrane under adherent conditions. We showed that the linker region between the second and third SH3 domains plays a role in regulating the anchorage dependence of ERK2 activation. The function of this region is unclear so far. There are three P XXP sequences, core sequences for SH3 domain binding, in the linker region. Interestingly, CAP (c-Cbl-associated protein)/ponsin, another member of the vinexin family, contains PQQP sequence in the linker region between the second and third SH3 domains (22.Mandai K. Nakanishi H. Satoh A. Takahashi K. Satoh K. Nishioka H. Mizoguchi A. Takai Y. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 144: 1001-1018Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar, 24.Ribon V. Printen J.A. Hoffman N.G. Kay B.K. Saltiel A.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 872-879Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). This region actually binds to the SH3 domains of Grb4/Nckβ, an adaptor molecule that binds to PAK (43.Cowan C.A. Henkemeyer M. Nature. 2001; 413: 174-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar). Therefore, it is possible that the linker region of vinexin β functions as a protein-interacting domain and regulates PAK activity indirectly. Indeed, we have isolated several proteins that bind to the linker region using yeast two-hybrid screening. 3H. Takahashi, A. Suwa, and N. Kioka, unpublished data. Vinexin β binds to Sos, a guanine nucleotide exchange factor for Ras and Rac, and enhances EGF-induced JNK activation in NIH3T3 cells (27.Akamatsu M. Aota S. Suwa A. Ueda K. Amachi T. Yamada K.M. Akiyama S.K. Kioka N. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 35933-35937Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). However, the vinexin β-Sos interaction is not likely to be involved in the anchorage dependence of ERK2 activation. Vinexin β binds to Sos via its third SH3 domain (27.Akamatsu M. Aota S. Suwa A. Ueda K. Amachi T. Yamada K.M. Akiyama S.K. Kioka N. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 35933-35937Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Mutation of the third SH3 domain disrupts binding to Sos and the ability to enhance JNK (27.Akamatsu M. Aota S. Suwa A. Ueda K. Amachi T. Yamada K.M. Akiyama S.K. Kioka N. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 35933-35937Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Moreover, vinexin β with a mutation in the third SH3 domain inhibits EGF-induced JNK activation in a dominant-negative fashion (27.Akamatsu M. Aota S. Suwa A. Ueda K. Amachi T. Yamada K.M. Akiyama S.K. Kioka N. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 35933-35937Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). In contrast, the same mutation of the third SH3 domain did not affect the function of vinexin β in its regulation of the anchorage dependence of ERK2 activation. The vinexin β mutant Δ3SH3, which lacks the binding site for Sos, still supported anchorage-independent ERK2 activation in response to EGF stimulation. These observations suggest that vinexin β regulates ERK2 and JNK by different mechanisms. Vinculin, a vinexin-binding protein, is also involved in the anchorage dependence of cell proliferation (28.Ben-Ze'ev A. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 99-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar, 29.Rodriguez Fernandez J.L. Geiger B. Salomon D. Ben-Ze'ev A. J.

Cell Biol. 1992; 119: 427-438Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). One hypothesis regarding the role of vinexin-vinculin interaction is that vinexin β is localized at focal adhesions by binding to vinculin and recruits signaling molecules such as PAK under adherent conditions, whereas in suspension culture, vinexin β does not bind to vinculin and does not recruit signaling molecules to the membrane. Indeed, vinculin binding of vinexin is regulated by cell adhesion. 4A. Suwa and N. Kioka, unpublished data. This model is compatible with the finding that the 1stSH3WF and 2ndSH3WF mutants, which do not bind to vinculin, still induced adhesion signaling. Loss of the membrane-localizing and PAK-activating abilities of Rac1 is overcome by overexpression of Rac1 (39.del Pozo M.A. Price L.S. Alderson N.B. Ren X.D. Schwartz M.A. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 2008-2014Crossref PubMed Scopus (405) Google Scholar). In our system, overexpression of vinexin mutants may overcome the loss of vinculin-binding and membrane-localizing abilities. In conclusion, we have demonstrated that vinexin β can regulate the anchorage dependence of ERK2 activation through PAK. Expression of vinexin β allows ERK2 activation stimulated by EGF without cell anchorage. We thank Drs. J. S. Gutkind, H. Teramoto, S. Ohno, S. Hirai, and K. Nose for the gifts of valuable materials.

https://openalex.org/W2152966204,"The possible involvement of the protein kinase C (PKC) pathway in transcriptional regulation of the human insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I) gene has been suggested. In this study, we sought to determine whether a PKC-dependent pathway is implicated in the transcriptional control, and if it is, how this occurs. Treatment with 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol 13-acetate (TPA) caused an increase in the activity of the human IGF-I gene major promoter in HepG2 cells. A CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein (C/EBP) binding site located at +22 to +30 was bound by C/EBPβ in a TPA-dependent manner and was solely responsible for the TPA responsiveness. This increase in C/EBPβ activity occurs through transcriptional and posttranslational regulation, and the latter is mediated by activation of p90 ribosomal S6 kinase (RSK): co-expression of dominant negative RSK abolished the TPA-responsive and C/EBPβ-dependent transactivation. Also, TPA-responsive activation of GAL4-C/EBPβ chimera required the Ser residue known as the RSK target. In SK-N-MC cells, which display constitutive, high expression of IGF-I on use of the major promoter, a large amount of C/EBPβ binding was observed with the C/EBP site in the basal state. Treatment with PKC inhibitors substantially reduced the promoter activity and mRNA amounts of IGF-I, with the binding of C/EBPβ to the C/EBP site also being reduced. When the C/EBP site was disrupted, the basal promoter activity was reduced, but the reduction by the PKC inhibitor was no longer observed. These observations suggest that the increase of C/EBPβ binding to the C/EBP site, which is in part mediated via activation of RSK, can primarily explain the TPA responsiveness of the IGF-I gene promoter. The intrinsic PKC activity in SK-N-MC cells should play a major role in the constitutive, high expression of IGF-I and may therefore contribute in part to the maintenance of the tumor phenotype of the cells.

Although various tissue-dependent factors as well as endocrine hormones seem to regulate the IGF-I gene expression, their mechanisms, except for those involved in prostaglandin E2 or cAMP (4Thomas M.J.

The protein kinase-C (PKC) pathway is among the few that have been suggested to be involved in IGF-I gene regulation. The result of a nuclear run-on assay indicated that treatment of human macrophage-like cells with 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol 13-acetate (TPA) increased the transcription rate of the IGF-I gene 4- to 5-fold (7Nagaoka I. Trapnell B.C. Crystal R.G. J. Clin. Invest. 1990; 85: 448-455Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar), suggesting that the human IGF-I gene regulatory sequences contain something that responds to PKC. Support for this also comes from our recent observations with the chicken IGF-I gene, i.e. that the gene promoter can be activated by TPA through an AP-1 binding site located in it (8Kajimoto Y. Kawamori R. Umayahara Y. Iwama N. Imano E. Morishima T. Yamasaki Y. Kamada T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1993; 190: 767-773Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). However, it is unknown whether the mammalian IGF-I genes are activated by PKC, and if they are, how this occurs. In contrast to protein kinase A, which seems to be involved in parathyroid hormone or prostaglandin E2-induced IGF-I gene activation, PKC has been often discussed in correlation with tumorigenesis. Indeed, the best-known activator of PKC, TPA, is a strong tumor promoter (9Blobe G.C. Obeid L.M. Hannun Y.A. Cancer Metastasis. Rev. 1994; 13: 411-431Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar, 10Gomez D.E. Skilton G. Alonso D.F. Kazanietz M.G. Oncol. Rep. 1999; 6: 1363-1370PubMed Google Scholar). In vitro overexpression studies have suggested that individual PKC isozymes control cell proliferation and malignant transformation. For example, when PKCβI was overexpressed in rat fibroblasts, the cells were partially transformed and could form tumors in nude mice (11Housey G.M. Johnson M.D. Hsiao W.L. O'Brian C.A. Murphy J.P. Kirschmeier P. Weinstein I.B. Cell. 1988; 52: 343-354Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (424) Google Scholar). Overexpression of PKCα also occasionally leads to transformation of fibroblasts (12Megidish T. Mazurek N. Nature. 1989; 342: 807-811Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Because the IGF system is known to play an essential role in inducing transformation (13Baserga R. Exp. Cell Res. 1999; 253: 1-6Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar) or maintaining the tumor phenotype in some cells, such as a human neuroblastoma cell line SK-N-MC (14Kiess W. Koepf G. Christiansen H. Blum W.F. Regul. Pept. 1997; 72: 19-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar), it is likely that PKC-dependent activation of the IGF-I gene, if it occurs in mammals, may be partially involved in the tumorigenesis. As a step toward elucidating the molecular basis of IGF-I gene regulation, we examined whether the human IGF-I gene promoter is a target of PKC regulation and sought to elucidate the physiological roles of the PKC pathway in the gene expression. Here we report that the major promoter of the gene, which is located within the 5′-flanking region and untranslated region of exon 1, is indeed a target of TPA stimulation and a CCAAT/enhancer binding protein (C/EBP) site within the promoter is responsible for the phenomenon. C/EBPβ, which is activated by PKC both at the level of transcription and of posttranslation, binds to the C/EBP site and thereby mediates the phenomenon. Interestingly, the posttranslational activation of C/EBPβ occurs primarily through activation of p90 ribosomal S6 kinase (RSK). Moreover, as support for the pathophysiological significance of these findings, we found that the constitutive IGF-I gene expression in the human neuroblastoma-derived SK-N-MC cells depends on the intrinsically activated PKC. Antibodies to C/EBPα (14AA), C/EBPβ (C-19), C/EBPδ (C-22), HNF-1α (C-19), and to c-Myb (M-19) were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc (Santa Cruz, CA). Antibodies to c-Fos and to c-Jun were purchased from Oncogene Science (Uniondale, NY). Antibody to HA tag was purchased from Upstate Biotechnology, Inc. (Lake Placid, NY). HepG2 cells (Riken Cell Bank, Tsukuba, Japan, catalog no. RCB459) were maintained as previously described (15Umayahara Y. Kawamori R. Watada H. Imano E. Iwama N. Morishima T. Yamasaki Y. Kajimoto Y. Kamada T. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 16433-16442Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). SK-N-MC cells (ATCC catalog no. HTB10) were maintained in Earle's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum, non-essential amino acids, penicillin, and streptomycin (basal condition medium). 293T cells were maintained as previously described (16Fujitani Y. Kajimoto Y. Yasuda T. Matsuoka T.A. Kaneto H. Umayahara Y. Fujita N. Watada H. Miyazaki J.I. Yamasaki Y. Hori M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 8281-8291Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Human IGF-I promoter-1-luciferase fusion genes were constructed as follows. A phage clone containing the 5′-flanking region and exon 1 of the human IGF-I gene was isolated from a human genomic library and used as a template to make the reporter gene plasmids. A series of PCR was performed using the phage DNA as a template to amplify promoter-1 DNA fragments, which were comprised of either 1600 bp or 300 bp of the human IGF-I gene 5′-flanking region and the 197 bp of the exon 1 untranslated region. The PCR primers used were 5′-GCGGTACCGCCTCTCAATGACACAATCTG-3′(for the 1600-bp fragment), 5′-GCGGTACCGAGTTTGCTGGAGAGGGTCT-3′(for the 300-bp fragment) and 5′-GGCAAGCTTGCGCAGGCTCTATCTGCT-3′ (for both). To make the plasmid pIGFI-1600 (Fig. 1), the PCR-amplified 1600-bp fragment was made blunt-ended using the DNA Blunting Kit (Takara, Kyoto, Japan), digested with HindIII, and ligated into SmaI/HindIII-digested pA3Luc (a kind gift from I. H. Maxwell, University of Colorado Health Science Center, Denver, CO) (17Maxwell I.H. Harrison G.S. Wood W.M. Maxwell F. BioTechniques. 1989; 7: 276-280PubMed Google Scholar). The plasmid pIGFI-600 (Fig. 1) was constructed by digesting the 1600-bp fragment with KpnI andHindIII and subcloning the resulting 600-bp fragment into the KpnI/HindIII-digested pA3Luc. The 300-bp fragment was digested with KpnI and HindIII and ligated into KpnI/HindIII-digested pA3Luc to construct the plasmid pIGFI-300 (Fig. 1). Site-directed mutagenesis was performed as described previously (8Kajimoto Y. Kawamori R. Umayahara Y. Iwama N. Imano E. Morishima T. Yamasaki Y. Kamada T. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

Blenis (Boston, MA). The plasmid pMSV β-gal is an expression plasmid of the β-galactosidase gene driven by the murine sarcoma virus long terminal repeat (18Rosenthal N. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 152: 704-720Crossref PubMed Scopus (403) Google Scholar). The plasmid pRL-CMV was purchased from Promega Corp (Madison, WI). Transfection studies using HepG2 cells were performed as follows. One microgram of IGF-I promoter-1-lucferase fusion genes were cotransfected with 500 ng of pMSV β-gal to normalize for transfection efficiency. Cultures at 50% confluent density were rinsed in serum-free medium and exposed to plasmids in the presence of LipofectAMINETM for 5 h. After washing the plates two times with PBS, the solution was then replaced with serum-free medium (15Umayahara Y. Kawamori R. Watada H. Imano E. Iwama N. Morishima T. Yamasaki Y. Kajimoto Y.

Next, the cells were treated for 24 h with vehicle (Me2SO) or 10−7m TPA. After incubation, the medium was aspirated, the cultures were rinsed with PBS twice and lysed in cell lysis buffer (Promega), and luciferase activity was measured as described previously (15Umayahara Y. Kawamori R. Watada H. Imano E. Iwama N. Morishima T. Yamasaki Y. Kajimoto Y. Kamada T. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 16433-16442Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Transfection studies using SK-N-MC cells were performed as follows. One microgram of IGF-I promoter-1-lucferase fusion genes were cotransfected with 5 ng of pRL-CMV to normalize for transfection efficiency. Cultures at 50% confluent density were rinsed in serum-free medium and exposed to plasmids in the presence of LipofectAMINETM for 5 h. After washing the plates two times with PBS, the solution was replaced with culture medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum, and the cells were incubated for 24 h. Next, the cells were treated for 24 h with vehicle (Me2SO) or 10−7m GF109203X. After incubation, the medium was aspirated, the cultures were rinsed with PBS twice and lysed in cell lysis buffer, and dual-luciferase assay was performed according to the manufacturer’s instructions (Promega). Transfection studies using 293T cells were performed basically in the same way as the SK-N-MC cells described above. One microgram of IGF-I promoter-1-luciferase fusion genes were cotransfected with the indicated amount of C/EBPβ expression vector, 1 μg of wild type or dominant negative type RSK expression vector, when required, and 5 ng of pRL-CMV. After transfection, the cells were incubated for 24 h and dual-luciferase assay (Promega) was performed following the manufacturer’s directions. The Gal4 fusion constructs (Gal4C/EBPβ118 and Gal4C/EBPβ166) were generated by isolating (by PCR) and introducing appropriate DNA fragments of C/EBPβ into the EcoRI-BglII site of pFACMV plasmid (Stratagene), which contained the DNA-binding domain (positions 1–147) of Gal4. Site-directed mutagenesis was performed with the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) using two synthetic complementary oligonucleotides, 5′-CCGAGCAAGAAGCCGGCCGACTACGGTTACG-3′ and 5′-CGTAACCGTAGTCGGCCGGCTTCTTGCTCGG-3′ (mutated sequence is underlined), to generate Gal4C/EBPβ118mutAla105 and Gal4C/EBPβ166mut105Ala. The Gal4-responsive reporter plasmid pFR-Luc plasmid containing five copies of Gal4-binding element upstream of the basic promoter element (TATA box) linked to luciferase structural gene was purchased from Stratagene. By lipofection, 1 μg of each Gal4 fusion plasmid was cotransfected into the host cell with 1 μg of pFR-Luc and 5 ng of pRL-CMV. The cells were then incubated for 48 h, followed by a dual-luciferase assay (Promega) performed according to the manufacturer’s directions. HepG2 and SK-N-MC cell nuclear extracts were prepared by the method of Lee et al. (19Lee K.A. Bindereif A. Green M.R. Gene Anal. Tech. 1988; 5: 22-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (394) Google Scholar) with minor modifications. Cells were harvested with a cell scraper and gently pelleted, and the pellets were washed with phosphate-buffered saline. The cells were then lysed in hypotonic buffer (10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 10 mm KCl, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol). Nuclei were pelleted and resuspended in hypertonic buffer containing 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 0.42 m NaCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 0.2 mm EDTA, 25% glycerol, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, and 0.5 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. Soluble proteins released by a 30-min incubation at 4 °C were collected by centrifugation at 12,000 × g for 20 min, and the supernatant was collected. The protein concentration was measured using a modified Bradford assay (Bio-Rad). Gel mobility shift experiments followed previously published methods (4Thomas M.J. Umayahara Y. Shu H. Centrella M. Rotwein P. McCarthy T.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 21835-21841Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Radiolabeled double-stranded DNA probes were synthesized by annealing complementary end-labeled oligonucleotides. Nuclear protein extracts (5 μg) were preincubated for 20 min on ice with 2 mg of poly(dI-dC) with or without unlabeled specific or nonspecific DNA competitor or antibodies in 25 mm HEPES, pH 7.6, 60 mm KCl, 7.5% glycerol, 0.1 mm EDTA, 5 mm dithiothreitol, and 0.025% bovine serum albumin. After the addition of 5 × 104cpm of DNA probe for 30 min on ice, the samples were applied to 12% nondenaturing polyacrylamide gel that had been pre-electrophoresed for 30 min at 12.5 V/cm at 25 °C in 45 mm Tris, 45 mm boric acid, and 1 mm EDTA. Electrophoresis was conducted for 2.5 h under identical conditions. The dried gels were exposed to x-ray film at −80 °C with an intensifying screen. Deoxynuclease I (DNase) footprinting was performed as described elsewhere (6Umayahara Y. Ji J. Billiard C. Centrella M. McCarthy T.L. Rotwein P. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 10609-10617Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). End-labeled double-stranded DNA probes flanking the C/EBP site in human IGF-I promoter-1, which corresponds to −46 to +96 bp (relative to transcriptional start site) of the human IGF-I gene, were generated by polymerase chain reaction using one end-labeled oligonucleotide primer (5′-ATGCTCTGTCTCTAGTT-3′) and one unlabeled primer (5′-ACTGTAGACAGGAAACAGCT-3′). Nuclear protein (10 μg) was preincubated for 15 min with poly(dI-dC) in 25 mm HEPES, pH 7.6, 60 mm KCl, 7.5% glycerol, 0.1 mm EDTA, 5 mm dithiothreitol, and 0.05% bovine serum albumin, followed by the addition of labeled probe (5.0 × 105cpm/sample) and incubation for 60 min on ice. The reaction mixture was then treated with DNase I (final concentration 1.15 mg/ml, Worthington Biochemical Corp., Freehold, NJ) in 2.5 mmMgCl2 and 2.5 mm CaCl2 for 1 min at 25 C. Nuclease treatment was terminated by addition of 20 mm EDTA, 200 mm NaCl, 1% sodium dodecyl sulfate, and 10 mg of yeast transfer RNA followed by phenol-chloroform extraction and ethanol precipitation. Samples were analyzed after electrophoresis on 8% polyacrylamide, 8 m urea gel, and autoradiography for 16 h at −80 °C with an intensifying screen. Total RNA was extracted from HepG2 cells or SK-N-MC cells by homogenization in guanidine thiocyanate. Northern blots followed standard procedures using 10 μg of total RNA, and the buffer conditions were as described. The hybridization probes were 7 × 106 cpm of32P-labeled rat C/EBPβ cDNA probe and human IGF-I cDNA probe. Reverse transcription-PCR were performed using primers 5′-ATCAGCGTCTTCCAACCCAATTA-3′ and 5′-TGGCGCTGGGCACGGACAGA-3′ (for human IGF-I), and 5′-AAGGCCGGCTTCGCGGCGA-3′ and 5′-CCGGCCAGCCAGGTCCAGAC-3′ (for β-actin). 293T cell nuclear proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. After the membranes were blocked with 5% nonfat dry milk and 2% fetal bovine serum in 20 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.6, and 137 mm NaCl for 1 h at 25 °C, they were incubated with an antibody to HA for 1 h at 25 °C. Subsequent steps were performed as described elsewhere (5Ji Y. Umayahara C. Centrella M. Rotwein P. McCarthy T.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 31793-31800Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). First we examined whether the major promoter (promoter-1) of the human IGF-I gene is a target of PKC activation. A series of gene transfer studies were performed with human hepatocellular carcinoma-derived HepG2 cells. Under the basal condition, HepG2 cells barely express the IGF-I gene according to reverse transcription-PCR results, but the IGF-I mRNA derived from the promoter 1 was induced when the cells were treated with 10−7m TPA for 4 h (data not shown). Each reporter gene plasmid contained various lengths of IGF-I gene 5′-flanking sequences and 197 bp of the exon 1 untranslated region linked to the firefly luciferase reporter because this portion of exon 1 untranslated region appeared to be important for basal promoter activity of promoter-1 in SK-N-MC cells (20Mittanck D.W. Kim S.W. Rotwein P. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 1997; 126: 153-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 1, despite differences in the basal promoter activities, the promoter activities of the 1600 bp (pIGFI-1600), 600 bp (pIGFI-600), and 300 bp (pIGFI-300) were activated to a similar extent after treatment with TPA, about 2.5-fold. This result showed that the human IGF-I gene promoter-1 could be activated by TPA treatment of the cells and that the major portion of the cis-active elements mediating this phenomenon is located within the 300 bp of the 5′-flanking sequence and/or the 197 bp of the untranslated region of exon 1. There was no region that perfectly matched the consensus AP-1 motif (T(G/T)AGTCA) within the region of the IGF-I gene which revealed the TPA responsiveness (−300 to ∼+197). However, a region of high similarity to the AP-1 consensus was seen within the exon 1 untranslated region (+23 to ∼+29; TTACTCA); indeed, the same sequence in the JE-1 gene was shown to be a target for TPA-responsive activation in MC3T3-E1 cells (21Koike M. Kuroki T. Nose K. Mol. Carcinog. 1993; 8: 105-111Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). To find whether this portion is involved in the TPA responsiveness, we performed a mutation analysis. Because this portion was located within a region where multiple transcription initiation sites are clustered, it seemed possible that a mutation in this region could cause unpredictable, nonspecific damage to the promoter activity. To avoid this, we changed one sequence of the possible TPA-responsive region (A (+29) to G) so that the sequence became the same as the homologous regions of the chicken and rat IGF-I genes (22Kajimoto Y. Rotwein P. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 9724-9731Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 23Hall L.J. Kajimoto Y. Bichell D. Kim S.W. James P.L. Counts D. Nixon L.J. Tobin G. Rotwein P. DNA Cell Biol. 1992; 11: 301-313Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 1, when one nucleotide mutation was introduced into the portion (pIGFI-300M), TPA-induced promoter activation was completely abolished, showing that this portion does play an essential role in mediating TPA effects on the IGF-I gene promoter. The mutated promoter also caused a decrease in the basal promoter activity (Fig.1). Interestingly, the putative TPA-responsive region in the human IGF-I gene also contains the consensus for the C/EBP binding motif, CTTACTCAA. Indeed, Nolten et al. previously demonstrated in vitro that C/EBPα and C/EBPβ, when overexpressed, can bind to this region (24Nolten L.A. van Schaik F.M. Steenbergh P.H. Sussenbach J.S. Mol. Endocrinol. 1994; 8: 1636-1645Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To characterize the factors involved in the TPA activation of the human IGF-I gene, we performed gel-mobility shift analyses. As shown in Fig.2, TPA enhanced specific protein bindings to the putative TPA-responsive region (lanes 1 and5). The unlabeled wild type competitor, but not the mutated competitor to which the same point mutation was introduced as in the reporter gene construct (A (+29) to G), inhibited the DNA-protein bindings (lanes 6–11). Also, when the mutation was introduced to the labeled probe, no binding was observed at all (lane 12). Thus, a certain factor or factors bind to the putative TPA-responsive region in the human IGF-I gene promoter in a TPA-responsive manner, and this mediates the TPA responsiveness of the gene transcription. As mentioned above, the putative TPA-responsive region reveals similarity to the AP-1 motif but also is a potential C/EBP binding site. To identify the factor that mediates the TPA responsiveness by binding to the region, we next performed a gel mobility supershift assay using specific antibodies against C/EBPα, C/EBPβ, C/EBPδ, c-Fos, c-Jun, HNF-1α, and c-Myc, respectively. Each antibody was added to a tube prior to the binding reaction. As shown in Fig.3, a supershifted band was observed together with a reduction of the gel-shift complex only when the C/EBPβ antibody was added (lane 9). Thus, the results clearly indicated that the TPA-responsive binding protein includes C/EBPβ, and the TPA-responsive region works as a C/EBP binding site. Next, we performed a DNase footprinting assay with end-labeled double-stranded DNA probes derived from human IGF-I promoter-1 and nuclear extracts from HepG2 cell or C/EBPβ overexpressing 293T cells (Fig. 4). The results indicated that overexpressed C/EBPβ protected the C/EBP site from nuclease digestion (lanes 4 and 5). With the nuclear extract of HepG2 cell, the same site was protected (lane 2), and this protection was enhanced by 4 h of incubation with TPA (lane 3), confirming that C/EBPβ binds to the C/EBP site in a TPA-dependent manner in HepG2 cells. Thus, C/EBPβ binds to the C/EBP site in IGF-I gene promoter-1 and mediates the TPA effects on the IGF-I gene promoter. To investigate whether C/EBPβ that binds to the C/EBP site can activate the IGF-I gene transcription, we overexpressed C/EBPβ in 293T cells and evaluated the effects on the IGF-I gene promoter activity. 293T cells were chosen because they lack intrinsic expression of C/EBPβ (data not shown). As shown in Fig.5, overexpression of C/EBPβ transactivates the IGF-I promoter-1 in a dose-dependent manner. When a point mutation was introduced to the C/EBP site, the transactivation effect of C/EBPβ disappeared, suggesting that C/EBPβ transactivates human IGF-I promoter-1 through the C/EBP site. Taken together, these results indicate that PKC activation induces human IGF-I gene transcription through enhancement of the C/EBPβ binding to promoter 1. Next we investigated the mechanism that underlies the PKC-dependent activation of C/EBPβ. First, the effects of TPA on C/EBPβ mRNA were evaluated in HepG2 cells. The results of Northern blot analysis (Fig. 6) revealed that TPA stimulation increases the C/EBPβ mRNA amount by ∼3-fold, suggesting that PKC can stimulate C/EBPβ gene transcription, and this may in part explain the PKC activation of the human IGF gene promoter. Recently, RSK was shown to stimulate C/EBPβ activity, and this facilitates TGFβ-induced hepatocyte proliferation (25Buck M. Poli V. van der Geer P. Chojkier M. Hunter T. Mol. Cell. 1999; 4: 1087-1092Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). Because RSK is known to be a downstream target of PKC, we investigated the possibility of RSK also being involved in the PKC-dependent activation of C/EBPβ and IGF-I gene activation. For this purpose, we used a DN mutant of RSK. As shown in Fig. 7, the DN RSK mutant, when co-overexpressed in the 293T cells with C/EBPβ, significantly suppressed the transactivation potential of C/EBPβ in terms of the activation of the human IGF-I gene promoter. This effect was not observed when C/EBPβ was absent (Fig. 7). These results suggest that the transactivation potential of C/EBPβ depends on the RSK activity in 293T cells. To further clarify the mechanism underlying this RSK-dependent activation of C/EBPβ, we employed theSaccharomyces cerevisiae GAL4 fusion protein reporter system (Fig 8). It is known that the N-terminal region of C/EBPβ contains a transcription activation domain and a transrepression domain (Fig. 8b, (26Williams S.C. Baer M. Dillner A.J. Johnson P.F. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 3170-3183Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar)). It also includes a Ser residue at 105, which was previously shown to be critical for the C/EBPβ activation by TPA (27Trautwein C. Caelles C. van der Geer P. Hunter T. Karin M. Chojkier M. Nature. 1993; 364: 544-547Crossref PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar) and was also identified recently as the phosphorylated site by RSK (25Buck M. Poli V. van der Geer P. Chojkier M. Hunter T. Mol. Cell. 1999; 4: 1087-1092Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). Accordingly, we prepared GAL4 fusion constructs containing either 118 or 166 amino acids (aa) of N-terminal region of C/EBPβ fused to the heterologous DNA-binding domain of the GAL4 transcription factor (Fig.8b). These chimeric GAL4-C/EBPβ fusion proteins were expressed in HepG2 cells, and effects on the GAL4 reporter were evaluated. HepG2 cells were used for this experiment because they show a very good response to TPA and have intrinsic C/EBPβ. As shown in Fig. 8a (lane 3), the Gal4C/EBPβ118 construct transactivated the GAL4 reporter in serum-free medium. On the other hand, the Gal4C/EBPβ166 construct did not activate the GAL4 reporter in the basal state (lane 5). This observation is consistent with former report b"

https://openalex.org/W2047447401,"Toxoplasma gondii is a ubiquitous, unicellular, eukaryotic parasite with a complex intracellular life cycle capable of invading and chronically infecting a wide variety of vertebrate host species, including man. Although normally opportunistic in healthy adults, it is a lethal pathogen in immunocompromised humans, particularly in AIDS patients. We present the application of a genomic phage display as a tool for the direct identification of antigens with potential value in diagnosis and/or as subunit vaccine components. Using a polycosmid cloning strategy, we constructed a large phagemid display library (>109 independent clones) of mixed short genomic restriction fragments (≤ 500 bp) of T. gondii genomic DNA (80 Mbp genome size) fused to gene III of the filamentous phage M13. Biopanning of the library with monoclonal Toxoplasma antibodies resulted in the isolation and identification of an epitope of GRA3, an antigen located in the dense granules of T. gondii tachyzoites. The reactivity of the phage displaying the GRA3 epitope with the monoclonal antibody was confirmed by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. These results demonstrate the accessibility of midsized eukaryotic genomes to display technology and the feasibility to screen these whole genome display libraries with antibodies for isolating novel antigenic determinants."
