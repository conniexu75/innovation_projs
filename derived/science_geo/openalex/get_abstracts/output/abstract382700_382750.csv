https://openalex.org/W1971797700,"Neural circuits of the basal ganglia are critical for motor planning and action selection. Two parallel basal ganglia pathways have been described, and have been proposed to exert opposing influences on motor function. According to this classical model, activation of the 'direct' pathway facilitates movement and activation of the 'indirect' pathway inhibits movement. However, more recent anatomical and functional evidence has called into question the validity of this hypothesis. Because this model has never been empirically tested, the specific function of these circuits in behaving animals remains unknown. Here we report direct activation of basal ganglia circuitry in vivo, using optogenetic control of direct- and indirect-pathway medium spiny projection neurons (MSNs), achieved through Cre-dependent viral expression of channelrhodopsin-2 in the striatum of bacterial artificial chromosome transgenic mice expressing Cre recombinase under control of regulatory elements for the dopamine D1 or D2 receptor. Bilateral excitation of indirect-pathway MSNs elicited a parkinsonian state, distinguished by increased freezing, bradykinesia and decreased locomotor initiations. In contrast, activation of direct-pathway MSNs reduced freezing and increased locomotion. In a mouse model of Parkinson's disease, direct-pathway activation completely rescued deficits in freezing, bradykinesia and locomotor initiation. Taken together, our findings establish a critical role for basal ganglia circuitry in the bidirectional regulation of motor behaviour and indicate that modulation of direct-pathway circuitry may represent an effective therapeutic strategy for ameliorating parkinsonian motor deficits."
https://openalex.org/W2121660927,"Plants detect potential pathogens by sensing microbe-associated molecular patterns via pattern recognition receptors. In the dicot model plant Arabidopsis, the lysin motif (LysM)-containing chitin elicitor receptor kinase 1 (CERK1) has been shown to be essential for perception of the fungal cell wall component chitin and for resistance to fungal pathogens. Recent in vitro studies with CERK1 protein expressed heterologously in yeast suggested direct chitin binding activity. Here we show in an affinity purification approach that CERK1 is a major chitin-binding protein of Arabidopsis cells, along with several known and putative chitinases. The ectodomain of CERK1 harbors three distinct LysM domains with potential ligand binding capacity. We demonstrate that the CERK1 ectodomain binds chitin and partially deacetylated chitosan directly without any requirement for interacting proteins and that all three LysM domains are necessary for chitin binding. Ligand-induced phosphorylation events are a general feature of animal and plant signal transduction pathways. Our studies show that chitin, chitin oligomers, and chitosan rapidly induce in vivo phosphorylation of CERK1 at multiple residues in the juxtamembrane and kinase domain. Functional analyses with a kinase dead variant provide evidence that kinase activity of CERK1 is required for its chitin-dependent in vivo phosphorylation, as well as for early defense responses and downstream signaling. Collectively, our data suggest that in Arabidopsis, CERK1 is a major chitin, chitosan, and chito-oligomer binding component and that chitin signaling depends on CERK1 post-translational modification and kinase activity.

Health and survival of all higher eukaryotic organisms depend on efficient pathogen detection and rapid activation of defense. These immediate and basic protective mechanisms are common to all multicellular organisms and are collectively referred to as innate immunity (1Nürnberger T. Kemmerling B. Trends Plant Sci. 2006; 11: 519-522Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). In plants as well as animals, innate immunity is based on pattern recognition receptors that recognize so called microbe- or pathogen-associated molecular patterns (MAMPs/PAMPs). 2The abbreviations used are: MAMPmicrobe-associated molecular patternPAMPpathogen-associated molecular patternLysMlysin motifRLKreceptor-like kinaseLRRleucine-rich repeatPGNpeptidoglycanROSreactive oxygen speciesMBPmyelin basic proteinLOFloss of function.

Despite the numerous MAMPs perceived by plants, only a handful of pattern recognition receptors have been identified so far (3Zipfel C. Curr. Opin. Plant Biol. 2009; 12: 414-420Crossref PubMed Scopus (365) Google Scholar). The most extensively studied pattern recognition receptor in Arabidopsis is the leucine-rich repeat (LRR) receptor-like kinase (RLK) FLS2, which recognizes a conserved region of the bacterial MAMP flagellin (4Gómez-Gómez L. Boller T. Mol. Cell. 2000; 5: 1003-1011Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). More recently, the RLK CERK1 has been identified as a key player in the perception of the fungal cell wall component chitin (6Miya A. Albert P. Shinya T. Desaki Y. Ichimura K. Shirasu K. Narusaka Y.

Stacey M.G. Stacey G. Plant Cell. 2008; 20: 471-481Crossref PubMed Scopus (584) Google Scholar). Chitin is a polymer of β-1,4-linked N-acetyl-glucosamine (GlcNAc) and has long been recognized as a potent MAMP in plant-fungal interactions (5Wan J. Zhang X.C. Stacey G. Plant Signal Behav. 2008; 3: 831-833Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Arabidopsis knock-out mutants of the CERK1 gene entirely lack chitin-induced defense responses, indicating that CERK1 is essential for chitin recognition. As a result, cerk1 mutants are more susceptible to fungal pathogens (6Miya A. Albert P. Shinya T. Desaki Y. Ichimura K. Shirasu K. Narusaka Y. Kawakami N. Kaku H. Shibuya N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Plant Cell. 2008; 20: 471-481Crossref PubMed Scopus (584) Google Scholar). Recently, cerk1 mutant plants were also shown to exhibit enhanced susceptibility to the bacterial pathogen Pseudomonas syringae, suggesting that CERK1 also has a function in perception of a yet unidentified bacterial MAMP (8Gimenez-Ibanez S. Hann D.R. Ntoukakis V. Petutschnig E. Lipka V. Rathjen J.P. Curr. Biol. 2009; 19: 423-429Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar). In contrast to peptide binding LRR-RLKs, CERK1 possesses three extracellular lysin motif (LysM) domains (6Miya A. Albert P. Shinya T. Desaki Y. Ichimura K. Shirasu K. Narusaka Y. Kawakami N. Kaku H. Shibuya N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2007; 104: 19613-19618Crossref PubMed Scopus (954) Google Scholar, 7Wan J. Zhang X.C. Neece D. Ramonell K.M. Clough S. Kim S.Y. Stacey M.G. Stacey G. Plant Cell. 2008; 20: 471-481Crossref PubMed Scopus (584) Google Scholar). The lysin motif is a ubiquitous protein module found in prokaryotes as well as eukaryotes. LysM proteins were first described in bacteria and shown to have binding capacity for peptidoglycan (PGN), a linear form of alternatively β-1,4-linked N-acetyl-muramic acid and GlcNAc (9Zhang X.C. Cannon S.B. Stacey G. BMC Evol. Biol. 2009; 9: 183Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). The first plant LysM proteins to be characterized were RLKs from legumes that are required for the establishment of symbiosis with rhizobial bacteria. During initiation of symbiosis, rhizobia secrete lipochitooligosaccharides known as Nod factors. The legume LysM-RLKs are involved in sensing the bacterial symbiont, likely by binding to these modified chitin oligomers (10Radutoiu S. Madsen L.H. Madsen E.B. Felle H.H. Umehara Y. Grønlund M.

Geurts R. Science. 2003; 302: 630-633Crossref PubMed Scopus (600) Google Scholar). The isolation of the chitin-binding protein CEBiP from plasma membranes of a rice cell culture established plant LysM proteins as important components in defense-related chitin perception (13Kaku H. Nishizawa Y. Ishii-Minami N. Akimoto-Tomiyama C. Dohmae N. Takio K. Minami E. Shibuya N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2006; 103: 11086-11091Crossref PubMed Scopus (827) Google Scholar). Similarly to Arabidopsis cerk1 knock-out mutants, rice CEBiP RNAi lines failed to mount chitin-induced defense responses, indicating that CEBiP is involved in chitin perception. Interestingly, CEBiP possesses two LysM domains and a transmembrane region but no domain that could function as a signal transduction module. In contrast to CEBiP, CERK1 contains an intracellular serine/threonine kinase domain, which makes it an excellent candidate for the Arabidopsis chitin receptor. Recent in vitro experiments with heterologously expressed CERK1 suggest that it does indeed have chitin binding capacity (14Iizasa E. Mitsutomi M. Nagano Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2010; 285: 2996-3004Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). Despite the remarkable progress in recent years, relatively little is known about post-translational modification and downstream signaling of MAMP receptors. Phosphorylation is the most common mechanism in signal transduction and plays a key role in MAMP perception. Mutations in the kinase domain of the LRR-RLK FLS2 have been shown to render plants insensitive to flagellin, as does overexpression of kinase-associated protein phosphatase KAPP (4Gómez-Gómez L. Boller T. Mol. Cell. 2000; 5: 1003-1011Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 15Gómez-Gómez L. Bauer Z. Boller T. Plant Cell. 2001; 13: 1155-1163Crossref PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar). Similarly, mutation of putative phosphorylation sites in FLS2 impairs flagellin signaling and endocytosis (16Robatzek S. Chinchilla D. Boller T. Genes Dev. 2006; 20: 537-542Crossref PubMed Scopus (552) Google Scholar). Protein phosphorylation is also essential for the Arabidopsis chitin response. Kinase inhibitors efficiently block transcription of chitin-inducible genes, whereas phosphatase inhibitors lead to induction of the same genes in the absence of chitin (17Zhang B. Ramonell K. Somerville S. Stacey G. Mol. Plant Microbe Interact. 2002; 15: 963-970Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). However, the question whether phosphorylation of CERK1 is required for chitin perception has not been addressed to date. In this study, we provide evidence that CERK1 is a major chitin-binding protein in Arabidopsis cells and that its ectodomain is directly involved in chitin binding. We show that CERK1 is phosphorylated in vivo in response to chitin treatment and that this post-translational modification is required for chitin signaling in plant innate immunity. 8-day old, dark grown Arabidopsis cell culture was harvested using a Buechner funnel and a vacuum pump. The cells were ground to a fine powder with mortar, pestle, and sand in liquid nitrogen. Then homogenization buffer (250 mm sucrose, 50 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.5, 5% glycerol, 50 mm Na4P2O7, 1 mm Na2MoO4, 25 mm NaF, 4 mm DTT, 1% polyvinylpolypyrrolidone, Roche Applied Science Complete protease inhibitor) was added at 1.5 ml/g of plant material. The sample was centrifuged at 5000 × g and 4 °C for 15 min. After ultracentrifugation at 100,000 × g and 4 °C for 1 h, the supernatant (soluble fraction) and microsomal pellet were separated. The pellet was washed with homogenization buffer (without polyvinylpolypyrrolidone) and recentrifuged at 100,000 × g and 4 °C for 45 min. The microsomal pellet was solubilized in homogenization buffer supplemented with 0.5% Triton X-100 (0.8 ml/g of plant material) and centrifuged again at 100,000 × g and 4 °C for 1 h. The supernatant from this step was used further (microsomal fraction), and the pellet was discarded. Both the soluble and the microsomal fractions were passed through a 40-μm filter followed by a 20-μm filter to remove any particles. Crab shell chitin (Sigma) was ground with mortar and pestle to a very fine powder, and a 100 mg/ml stock slurry was prepared with water. The soluble and microsomal extracts were divided into two halves, and one part was incubated three times with 5 mg/ml chitin on a shaker at 4 °C for 45 min. In between the incubation steps, the chitin was removed by centrifuging at 5000 × g and 4 °C for 15 min. Chitin magnetic beads (New England Biolabs) were washed twice with wash buffer (50 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.5, 5% glycerol, 50 mm Na4P2O7, 1 mm Na2MoO4, 25 mm NaF, 4 mm DTT, 0.5% Triton X-100, Roche Applied Science Complete protease inhibitor). 20 μl of chitin magnetic beads (50% slurry) were added per ml of protein extract, and the samples were incubated at 4 °C on a rotator for 1 h. Then the samples were washed three times with wash buffer containing 500 mm NaCl and three times with wash buffer without NaCl. Proteins were recovered from the beads either by boiling with 1× SDS loading buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 100 mm DTT, 2% SDS, 10% glycerol, 0.025% bromphenol blue) at 90 °C for 5 min or by elution with 2 mg/ml chitohexaose (Seikagaku) in wash buffer. 50 μl elution solution were added per 20 μl of beads and incubated on a shaker at room temperature for 45 min. The eluate was then concentrated 6-fold using Vivaspin 500 (molecular mass cut-off 10,000 Da) columns. Affinity enrichment experiments with polysaccharides were performed as described above, but instead of chitin beads, powdered chitin, chitosan (Sigma), or PGN from different sources (InvivoGen) was added to protein preparations at 5 mg/ml. Binding protein was recovered by boiling with SDS loading buffer. The ectodomain of CERK1 was amplified using primers EP73 and EP74 (supplemental Table 5). The resulting PCR product was cloned into vector pJL48 (pTRBO) (18Lindbo J.A. Plant Physiol. 2007; 145: 1232-1240Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar) via its VspI and NotI sites. cDNA versions of CERK1 with one or two deleted LysM domains were synthesized by GenScript (Piscataway, NJ). The ectodomains of these CERK1 versions were also amplified with primers EP73 and EP74 and cloned into pTRBO as described above. The resulting plasmids were transformed into Agrobacterium tumefaciens GV3101+pSoup. 2-day old Agrobacterium cultures were pelleted and resuspended in infiltration buffer (10 mm MgCl2, 10 mm MES, 150 μm acetosyringone) at A600 = 0.3 and infiltrated into N. benthamiana leaves. The transformed leaves were harvested after 4 days and stored at −80 °C. For protein purification, the plant material was ground to a fine powder with mortar and pestle under liquid nitrogen, and buffer GTEN (150 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 10 mm EDTA, 150 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 10 mm DTT, 2% polyvinylpolypyrrolidone, Sigma plant protease inhibitor mixture) was added (3 ml/g of plant material). Then the sample was centrifuged for 10 min at 5000 × g and 4 °C. The supernatant was passed through a 60- and a 40-μm filter to remove particles. Anti-FLAG M2 affinity gel (Sigma) was washed with buffer GTEN and was added to the filtered plant extract (20 μl of bed volume/ml of extract). The samples were then incubated at 4 °C on a roller for 1 h. Subsequently, the FLAG affinity gel was washed six times with buffer GTEN containing 250 mm NaCl and two times with GTEN containing 150 mm NaCl. FLAG-tagged protein was eluted with GTEN containing 150 mm NaCl, 250 μg/ml FLAG-peptide, and 1 mm DTT (2× bed volume of beads). The eluate was concentrated 6-fold using Vivaspin 6 (molecular mass cut-off 5000 Da) columns. The protein was further purified by gel filtration using a GE Healthcare HiLoad 16/60 Superdex 200 pg column. The running buffer was TBS (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl). Fractions containing pure FLAG-tagged protein were concentrated again with Vivaspin 6 (molecular mass cut-off 5000 Da) columns. Purity and quantity were tested by SDS-PAGE and colloidal Coomassie Brilliant Blue staining. The purity was also verified by mass spectrometry analysis. Chitin, chitosan (Sigma), chitin oligomers (IsoSep), chitosan oligomers (Seikagaku), as well as PGN from different source organisms (InvivoGen) and lipopolysaccharides (LPS) (Sigma) were used at a concentration of 1–100 μg/ml. flg22 and elf18 were used at a final concentration of 100 nm. Leaves of soil-grown plants were treated by vacuum infiltration. To treat cultured cells, the MAMPs were added to the medium. Total protein was extracted by grinding leaves in homogenization buffer containing 0.5% Triton X-100 and subsequent centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 15 min. Proteins were separated by 8 or 10% SDS-PAGE and blotted to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Millipore). Membranes were probed with anti-CERK1 (8Gimenez-Ibanez S. Hann D.R. Ntoukakis V. Petutschnig E. Lipka V. Rathjen J.P. Curr. Biol. 2009; 19: 423-429Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar) or anti-FLAG M2 (Sigma) antibodies. Goat-anti-rabbit or goat-anti-mouse alkaline phosphatase conjugates (Sigma) were used as secondary antibodies. The reaction was detected using ImmunStar AP substrate (Bio-Rad). Microsomal extracts from untreated and chitin-treated Arabidopsis cell culture were prepared. CERK1 protein was pulled down from the extracts with chitin magnetic beads or powdered chitin. The λ-phosphatase (Sigma) treatment was performed on the beads/chitin powder according to the manufacturer's instructions. The plant material used was leaves of soil grown plants. To avoid MAPK activation by infiltration, the upper and lower surface of detached leaves was cut with a razor blade. Cut leaves were incubated in water for 5 h to allow the wounding response to diminish. Elicitors were added to the water, and the samples were incubated for 12 min. Immunocomplex MAP kinase assays were performed as described previously (19Cardinale F. Jonak C. Ligterink W. Niehaus K. Boller T. Hirt H. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 36734-36740Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). Antibodies against AtMPK6 and AtMPK4 were purchased from Sigma. The production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) was measured using a luminol-based chemiluminescent assay. Leaf discs (4-mm diameter) were floated on water overnight. Then the water was replaced with luminol solution (100 μl/leaf disc; 10 mm Tris, pH 9.5, 100 μm luminol, 10 μg/ml horseradish peroxidase). ROS production was induced with 100 μg/ml chitin, chitosan, or chitin/chitosan oligomers or 100 nm flg22. The equivalent volume of water was added to control samples. Luminescence was measured using a Tecan infinite M200 plate reader over time, and data were recorded at the maximum intensity of the response. To identify proteins with potential function in chitin-induced plant innate immunity, we developed an affinity purification method to enrich for plant chitin-binding proteins (supplemental Fig. 1A). Proteins from Arabidopsis thaliana cell culture were separated into soluble and microsomal fractions, and the resulting protein extracts were incubated with chitin magnetic beads. To discriminate between chitin-binding proteins and proteins that bind non-specifically, we incubated half of the extracts with powdered chitin before binding to chitin beads. This preclearing step did not visibly alter the overall composition of extracts (supplemental Fig. 1B). After incubation, the beads were washed with a high salt buffer (0.5 m NaCl). Bound proteins were recovered by boiling in SDS buffer and subsequently separated by SDS-PAGE (Fig. 1). Protein bands that were reproducibly depleted from the extracts by preclearing were analyzed by LC-MS/MS. In the membrane fraction, a 70-kDa band was identified as CERK1, suggesting that CERK1 isolated from Arabidopsis cells indeed has chitin binding activity (Table 1). In the soluble fraction, several differential bands were detected that corresponded to chitinases and glycosyl hydrolases, including the pathogenesis-related chitin-binding proteins PR3 and PR4 (20Neuhaus J. Datta S.K. Muthukrishnan S. Pathogenesis Related Proteins in Plants. CRC Press LLC, Boca Raton, FL1999: 77-106Google Scholar, 21Margis-Pinheiro M. Metz-Boutigue M.H. Awade A. de Tapia M. le Ret M. Burkard G. Plant Mol. Biol. 1991; 17: 243-253Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar) (Table 1). To identify less abundant chitin-binding proteins, complete gel lanes were divided into slices and analyzed by mass spectrometry. This approach revealed several additional chitinases, the LysM protein At2g17120 (closest Arabidopsis homolog of the rice chitin-binding protein CEBiP) (13Kaku H. Nishizawa Y. Ishii-Minami N. Akimoto-Tomiyama C. Dohmae N. Takio K. Minami E. Shibuya N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

The closely related LysM-RLK At2g33580 was found in a similar experiment (supplemental Table 3C).TABLE 1Arabidopsis chitin-binding proteins identified by affinity purificationBandProteinPredicted locationaTopology and subcellular location as predicted by the ARAMEMNON database. s = soluble, m = membrane, sec = secreted.AGI codeNormalized spectrum countUntreatedPreclearedReduction%Membrane fraction 8CERK1 (chitin elicitor receptor kinase 1)m, secAt3g21630842570.2 9; 10bChitinase At2g43610 was also detected in membrane samples, likely because of its extremely high abundance.Chitinase (glycosyl hydrolase 19 family protein)s, secAt2g436101873481.8Soluble fraction 1; 6Chitinase (glycosyl hydrolase 19 family protein)s, secAt2g436106646091.0 2; 3PGAZAT (polygalacturonase abscission zone A. thaliana)s, secAt2g418503295284.2 4; 5Basic chitinase/pathogenesis-related 3 (PR3)s, secAt3g125003701296.8 7Pathogenesis-related 4 (PR4)s, secAt3g0472017382.4a Topology and subcellular location as predicted by the ARAMEMNON database. s = soluble, m = membrane, sec = secreted.b Chitinase At2g43610 was also detected in membrane samples, likely because of its extremely high abundance. Open table in a new tab CERK1 was also detected in protein samples that were specifically eluted from chitin beads with chitohexaose, corroborating CERK1 chitin binding activity and suggesting that CERK1 can also bind to chitin oligomers (supplemental Table 2). Mascot and X!Tandem scores of all proteins identified in this study are presented in supplemental Table 3. The affinity purification experiments were performed under very stringent conditions to enrich for proteins that bind chitin directly rather than via protein-protein interactions. To confirm direct chitin binding activity of the CERK1 ectodomain, we transiently expressed the FLAG-tagged N terminus of CERK1 (amino acids 1–229) in N. benthamiana, using the recently described pTRBO overexpression system (18Lindbo J.A. Plant Physiol. 2007; 145: 1232-1240Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). The CERK1 ectodomain-FLAG protein was then purified by FLAG affinity chromatography and gel filtration. Subsequently, we determined that the purified protein binds to chitin beads (Fig. 2A), indicating that the CERK1 ectodomain alone has chitin binding activity and that interacting proteins are not required for efficient chitin binding. Chitosan, a partially deacetylated derivative of chitin, has been described as a potent elicitor of defense responses in plants (22Iriti M. Faoro F. Plant Signal. Behav. 2009; 4: 66-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar, 23Rabea E.I. Badawy M.E. Stevens C.V. Smagghe G. Steurbaut W. Biomacromolecules. 2003; 4: 1457-1465Crossref PubMed Scopus (2317) Google Scholar). Similarly, plants recognize the bacterial cell wall component PGN, which is chemically similar to chitin (24Erbs G. Silipo A. Aslam S. De Castro C. Liparoti V. Flagiello A. Pucci P. Lanzetta R. Parrilli M. Molinaro A. Newman M.A. Cooper R.M. Chem.

Nürnberger T. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 32338-32348Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar). Therefore, we examined CERK1 binding to chitosan and PGN. We found that CERK1 binds strongly to chitin and more weakly to chitosan, whereas binding to PGN from either a Gram-positive or a Gram-negative bacterium could not be observed (Fig. 2B). CERK1 binding to chitosan appears to be physiologically relevant as cerk1-2 knock-out mutants (6Miya A. Albert P. Shinya T. Desaki Y. Ichimura K. Shirasu K. Narusaka Y. Kawakami N. Kaku H. Shibuya N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2007; 104: 19613-19618Crossref PubMed Scopus (954) Google Scholar) show neither a reactive oxygen burst nor MAP kinase activation in response to chitosan (supplemental Fig. 2, A and B). Collectively, these data demonstrate that CERK1 is not only required for chitin but also for chitosan perception, whereas it is unlikely to play a role in PGN recognition. Not only polymeric chitin, but also chitin oligomers, induce defense responses in plants (5Wan J. Zhang X.C. Stacey G. Plant Signal Behav. 2008; 3: 831-833Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Elution of CERK1 from chitin beads with chitohexaose suggested that CERK1 also binds chitin oligomers. To address this question in more detail, we performed binding of CERK1 to chitin beads in the presence of chitin and chitosan oligomers of different length. Chitin oligomers with a polymerization degree of 5 and longer decreased the binding of CERK1 to chitin beads, indicating that CERK1 can bind these chitin fragments. In contrast, shorter chitin oligomers or chitosan oligomers had no effect (Fig. 2C). The CERK1 extracellular domain comprises three distinct LysM domains. To investigate which of the LysM domain(s) is/are necessary or sufficient for chitin binding, we generated a comprehensive set of FLAG-tagged CERK1 ectodomain versions with one or two LysM domains deleted (Fig. 3A). Transient expression in N. benthamiana yielded proteins that corresponded well to their expected molecular weights (Fig. 3B, left panel). Next, we tested binding of the respective proteins to chitin beads. We found that only the full-length CERK1 ectodomain could be pulled down with chitin beads, indicating that all three LysM domains are required for chitin binding (Fig. 3B, right panel). Western blotting experiments with CERK1 from Arabidopsis leaves that were vacuum-infiltrated with chitin revealed that chitin treatment induces a transient band shift of the CERK1 protein (Fig. 4A). To study the band shift kinetics in more detail, we next used Arabidopsis cell culture, which allows for a more simultaneous chitin application to all cells (Fig. 4B). These experiments showed that the band shift is very rapid, appears within a few minutes after chitin treatment, and lasts up to a few hours. To test the specificity of the band shift response, we treated Arabidopsis cell culture with a range of known polysaccharide and peptide PAMPs (Fig. 4C). We found that in addition to chitin, the structurally closely related polysaccharide chitosan induced a partial CERK1 band shift, corroborating the idea that CERK1 is involved in chitosan-induced plant defense activation. In contrast to chitin, chitosan can be solubilized in weak acids, which increases its availability and thereby the band shift-inducing capacity. PGN from different source organisms, LPS, or peptide PAMPs did not induce a band shift. Next, we compared the band shift induced by polymeric chitin and chitosan with the effect of different chitin and chitosan oligomers (Fig. 4D). These experiments showed that the ability of chitin oligomers to induce a band shift of CERK1 is length-dependent. Monomeric GlcNAc and chitin dimers did not cause a CERK1 protein shift, tri- and tetramers induced a weak shift, whereas chitin pentamers and longer oligomers led to a band shift comparable with that induced by polymeric chitin. Polymeric chitosan induced a weak band shift, whereas chitosan oligomers did not. This is likely due to the fact that polymeric chitosan contains a significant proportion of acetylated glucosamine residues, whereas the chitosan oligomers used here are completely deacetylated (Fig. 4D). The chitin oligomers that induced a clear band shift of CERK1 were also able to induce a ROS burst and activate MAP kinases in wild type Arabidopsis but not in the knock-out mutant cerk1-2 (supplemental Fig. 3, A and B). These findings confirm that chitin oligomers (degree of polymerization ≥ 5) are recognized as PAMPs in Arabidopsis and that their perception is dependent on CERK1. MAP kinase assays are highly sensitive, and long chitin oligomers induced phosphorylation activity already at low concentrations (1 μg/ml) (supplemental Fig. 3B). At higher concentrations (≥10 μg/ml), chitin tri- and tetramers also activated MAPKs, suggesting that they function as PAMPs in Arabidopsis, albeit with low efficiency (data not shown). The rapid inducibility of the band shift suggested a post-translational modification of the CERK1 receptor kinase. To analyze the nature of"

https://openalex.org/W1977787135,"The insulin/IGF-1 signalling (IIS) pathway has diverse roles from metabolism to longevity. In Caenorhabditis elegans, the single forkhead box O (FOXO) homologue, DAF-16, functions as the major target of the IIS pathway. One of two isoforms, DAF-16a, is known to regulate longevity, stress response and dauer diapause. However, it remains unclear how DAF-16 achieves its specificity in regulating these various biological processes. Here we identify a new isoform, DAF-16d/f, as an important isoform regulating longevity. We show that DAF-16 isoforms functionally cooperate to modulate IIS-mediated processes through differential tissue enrichment, preferential modulation by upstream kinases, and regulating distinct and overlapping target genes. Promoter-swapping experiments show both the promoter and the coding region of DAF-16 are important for its function. Importantly, in mammals, four FOXO genes have overlapping and different functions, and in C. elegans, a single FOXO/DAF-16 uses distinct isoforms to fine-tune the IIS-mediated processes in the context of a whole organism."

Mechanosensitivity of TRPV4 provides the simplest explanation of its various force-related physiological roles, one of which is in the sensing of weight load during bone development. Gain-of-function mutants cause heritable skeletal dysplasias in human. We therefore examined the brachyolmia-causing R616Q gain-of-function channel and found increased whole-cell current densities compared with wild-type channels.

https://openalex.org/W2120245299,"Three oyster defensin variants (Cg-Defh1, Cg-Defh2, and Cg-Defm) were produced as recombinant peptides and characterized in terms of activities and mechanism of action. In agreement with their spectrum of activity almost specifically directed against Gram-positive bacteria, oyster defensins were shown here to be specific inhibitors of a bacterial biosynthesis pathway rather than mere membrane-active agents. Indeed, at lethal concentrations, the three defensins did not compromise Staphylococcus aureus membrane integrity but inhibited the cell wall biosynthesis as indicated by the accumulation of the UDP-N-acetylmuramyl-pentapeptide cell wall precursor. In addition, a combination of antagonization assays, thin layer chromatography, and surface plasmon resonance measurements showed that oyster defensins bind almost irreversibly to the lipid II peptidoglycan precursor, thereby inhibiting the cell wall biosynthesis. To our knowledge, this is the first detailed analysis of the mechanism of action of antibacterial defensins produced by invertebrates. Interestingly, the three defensins, which were chosen as representative of the oyster defensin molecular diversity, bound differentially to lipid II. This correlated with their differential antibacterial activities. From our experimental data and the analysis of oyster defensin sequence diversity, we propose that oyster defensin activity results from selective forces that have conserved residues involved in lipid II binding and diversified residues at the surface of oyster defensins that could improve electrostatic interactions with the bacterial membranes."

For development and signaling in plants, the activities of membrane ion channels are essential, often including their regulation by ROS. For example, ROS affect non-selective cation channels during Fucus development (10Coelho S.M. Taylor A.R. Ryan K.P. Sousa-Pinto I. Brown M.T. Brownlee C.

Blatt M.R. Plant Physiol. 2003; 131: 385-388Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar) that are important for stomatal movement; they contribute in responses to drought and pathogen defense (12Amtmann A. Blatt M.R. Yeo A.R. Flowers T. Plant Solute Transport. Blackwells, Oxford2007: 99-132Google Scholar); and they have been implicated in targeting K+ efflux during programmed cell death (13Demidchik V.

However, until now virtually nothing has been known of the molecular targets for ROS in plants, nor has a site of action been identified with an ion channel protein. SKOR is one of two K+ channels found in Arabidopsis thaliana that rectify strongly outward, thereby mediating K+ efflux from the cell. It is expressed within the xylem parenchyma of the root where it facilitates K+ loading into the xylem (14Gaymard F. Pilot G. Lacombe B. Bouchez D. Bruneau D. Boucherez J. Michaux-Ferrière N. Thibaud J.B. Sentenac H. Cell. 1998; 94: 647-655Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (559) Google Scholar), thereby contributing directly to K+ homeostasis and indirectly, through charge balance, to the transport of other solutes throughout the plant (12Amtmann A. Blatt M.R. Yeo A.R. Flowers T. Plant Solute Transport. Blackwells, Oxford2007: 99-132Google Scholar, 15Schachtman D.P. Shin R. Annu. Rev. Plant Biol. 2007; 58: 47-69Crossref PubMed Scopus (362) Google Scholar). Like other members of the Kv-like channel superfamily (16Dreyer I. Blatt M.R. Trends Plant Sci. 2009; 14: 383-390Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar), the functional channel assembles from four monomers with each SKOR monomer incorporating six transmembrane α-helices. The first four α-helices form a positively charged voltage-sensor complex or “paddle” that moves within the membrane in response to voltage and couples this movement to the channel gate. The fifth and sixth α-helices line the aqueous pore through the membrane and assemble in a diaphragm or “gate” at the inner membrane surface, which opens/closes to regulate ion flux through the channel. Here we report that K+ current through the heterologously expressed SKOR is modulated by H2O2, thereby identifying the K+ channel as a potential target for ROS, and we show that a single Cys within the voltage sensor complex is essential for its ROS sensitivity. This Cys and adjacent sequences form a motif that shows extensive conservation among outward-rectifying Kv-like K+ channels, but only from land plants, suggesting that the motif may represent an important regulatory target specialized for the habit of plants in dry environments. Site mutations were generated in wild-type SKOR and the C-terminal deletion mutant SKOR-ΔK746 as described previously (17Johansson I. Wulfetange K. Porée F. Michard E. Gajdanowicz P. Lacombe B.

All clones were verified by sequencing. Human embryonic kidney (HEK293) cells were grown at 37 °C under 5% CO2 in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Sigma) with 10% (v/v) fetal calf serum, 2 mm l-glutamine, 1:1000 penicillin and streptomycin. Cells were transfected using PolyFect Transfection Reagent (Qiagen), subcultured for 2 days, and 12 h prior to recording, dispersed using trypsin and plated on fibronectin-coated coverslips. For recording, the coverslips were mounted in perfusion chambers on an Axiovert200 fluorescence microscope (Zeiss, Germany). Cells expressing the channels were selected by visual inspection for co-expression of GFP fluorescence. Patch pipettes were pulled from Kimax51 capillaries (Kimble Products) in two stages to give tips with resistances of 2–5 megaohms. Standard pipette solutions contained (in mm) 130 K-gluconate, 1 NaCl, 10 HEPES, 5 EGTA, 2.1 MgCl2, 2.8 CaCl2 (= 0.1 μm free [Ca2+] (19Föhr K.J. Warchol W. Gratzl M.

The bath solutions contained (in mm) 5 mm KCl, 185 mm mannitol, 1.8 CaCl2, 1 MgCl2, 10 glucose, 5 HEPES/KOH, pH 7.4. DTT, glutathione, and H2O2 were added directly to bath or pipette solutions. Methanethiosulfonate (MTS) reagents (Toronto Research), H2O2, and ATP stock solutions were prepared fresh for dilution to a final concentration. Currents were recorded using an Geneclamp 500B amplifier (Axon Instruments, Sunnyvale, CA) and voltage clamp driven using Henry III software (Y-Science, Glasgow, UK). Currents were recorded after filtering at 1 kHz and analyzed as described previously (17Johansson I. Wulfetange K. Porée F. Michard E. Gajdanowicz P. Lacombe B. Sentenac H. Thibaud J.B.

Data are reported as mean ± S.E. as appropriate with significance determined by Student's t test or analysis of variance. Seeds of Col-0 wild-type Arabidopsis and the skor and rhd2 mutants were sterilized and stored in the dark at 4 °C to vernalize. The seed was germinated on 0.5× Murashige and Skoog basal salts medium (21Murashige T. Skoog F. Physiol. Plant. 1962; 15: 473-497Crossref Scopus (52758) Google Scholar) under continuous white light at 50 μmol/m2/s at 22 °C. After 6 days, germinated seedlings were transferred to 0.7% agar plates containing 0.5× Murashige and Skoog medium alone and with 40 and 80 mm NaCl and 0.1 and 0.5 mm H2O2. Plants were harvested after 14 days growth. Root and shoot material was separated, analyzed for fresh weight, dried for 7 days at 70 °C, and analyzed for dry weight, and the dry material extracted in 2 n HCl (20:1 w/v) for 7 days before analysis for K+ and Na+ content by flame spectrophotometry. Cation contents were expressed in concentrations assuming a 1:1 relationship between fresh weight and cellular volume. Molecular dynamic simulation was performed using the NAMD program (22Phillips J.C. Braun R. Wang W. Gumbart J. Tajkhorshid E. Villa E. Chipot C. Skeel R.D. Kale L. Schulten K. J. Comp. Chem. 2005; 26: 1781-1802Crossref PubMed Scopus (12734) Google Scholar). Open and closed SKOR models were embedded within a lipid bilayer in a periodic boundary condition box with water molecules, K+ and Cl− ions, and was first optimized using energy minimization followed by equilibration at 298 K for 3 ns with a harmonic restraint of 0.5 kcal/mol Å2 applied to the backbone atoms (see supplemental Fig. S1) (18Gajdanowicz P.

SKOR harbors 11 Cys residues, of which eight locate within the cytosolic C terminus of the protein and two, Cys228 and Cys234, are situated in the S5 α-helix lining the channel pore (Fig. 1A). A single Cys, Cys168, was found in the S3 α-helix of the voltage sensor complex and appears highly conserved among outward-rectifying K+ channels of land plants (Fig. 1A). Deletion of the C-terminal 83 residues of SKOR (SKOR-ΔK746), including two Cys, has no measurable effect on SKOR current or gating when heterologously expressed (17Johansson I. Wulfetange K. Porée F.

Both in this background and in wild-type, substitutions of either Cys228 or Cys234 individually were not tolerated, nor did these mutations yield currents when combined with Cys168 substitutions, alone or together (not shown). However, currents were recovered in SKOR mutants with C168S (SKOR-C168S) or with paired C228S/C234S (SKOR-C228S/C234S) substitutions. Like wild-type SKOR, these mutants gave currents on positive voltage steps with pronounced sigmoidal activation kinetics and a sensitivity to extracellular [K+] when expressed in HEK293 cells (Fig. 1B) and Xenopus oocytes (not shown), albeit with somewhat faster activation kinetics. Wild-type SKOR current generally showed a slow decay throughout the 10–20 min of most recordings once in the whole cell configuration. We found that adding 1 mm H2O2 to the bath reversed this decay and 10 and 30 mm H2O2 further enhanced the steady-state current amplitude by 2- to near 4-fold (Fig. 2A). Current enhancement was accompanied by a decrease in the half-times for activation (Fig. 2A), consistent with an action on gating, and complementary results were obtained in oocytes (not shown). In each of 23 independent experiments expressing SKOR in HEK293 cells (Fig. 2B), the current increased from near 0.5 nA to 1.5–2 nA at a clamp voltage of +80 mV following additions of 10 mm H2O2. However, no measurable effects were observed on treatment with the larger molecular weight, Cys-reactive reagent 5,5′-dithiobis-2-nitrobenzoic acid (DTNB, Fig. 2C); in 5 experiments DTNB gave currents similar to control treatments with buffer alone (not shown). Similarly, no effect was observed with the membrane-permeant reagent phenylarsine oxide (not shown), which cross-links vicinal cysteines (20Sokolovski S. Blatt M.R. Plant Physiol. 2004; 136: 4275-4284Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Current enhancement by H2O2 was saturable with an apparent Kd for H2O2 of 3.8 ± 0.6 mm (Fig. 2B). No appreciable decay was observed after subsequent washing with buffer alone (Fig. 2C), at least within the time frame of recordings, indicating a persistence of ROS action. However, the H2O2 enhancement of SKOR current was fully reversible in the presence of the reductant DTT when added subsequently to the bath (Fig. 2C). DTT had no effect when added inside by inclusion in the patch pipette, even when the DTT-containing pipette solutions were allowed to exchange with the cytosol for 5–6 min before adding H2O2 (not shown). Similarly, including reduced glutathione (GSH) at concentrations of 1, 5, and 10 mm in 6 experiments failed to suppress the effects of H2O2 on the SKOR current (Fig. 2C). These observations suggested that current enhancement depended on reversible oxidation of an isolated site (or sites) situated near the outer membrane surface and accessible to H2O2, but not to larger Mr redox reagents. Because Cys168, Cys228, and Cys234 residues needed for functional expression of SKOR might be targets for H2O2, we examined ROS sensitivity of the substitution mutants. In each of 12 experiments, SKOR-C228S/C234S showed essentially wild-type characteristics: current amplitude was enhanced in 1 and 10 mm H2O2 (Fig. 3A), and the response was reversed by adding DTT (not shown). Half-times for current activation of SKOR-C228S/C234S decreased on additions of H2O2 (Fig. 3A), and recovered with DTT treatments (not shown), much as was observed for wild-type SKOR. By contrast, in each of 11 experiments H2O2 failed to enhance the current carried by SKOR-C168S or to accelerate its activation, even with additions of 10 mm H2O2 (Fig. 3A). We cannot rule out more subtle effects of the ROS associated with other sites within the channel protein. Nonetheless, loss of sensitivity in SKOR-C168S led us to conclude that this residue is a major target for H2O2 action on the channel. We anticipated that the SKOR-C168S mutant might also be resistant to the effects of covalent Cys modification by MTS reagents. Methanethiosulfonates selectively attack cysteine thiols, rapidly S-methioylating the available Cys residues, and have been used to characterize the temporal and environmental accessibility of domains within many ion channels (cf.

In each of 14 experiments, treatment of cells expressing wild-type SKOR with 400 μm MTSES (Fig. 3B) or MTSEA (not shown) blocked the current with kinetics well fitted to a simple exponential decay and half-times near 30 s (Fig. 3B and inset). These rates of block compare favorably with those for the voltage-dependent action of MTS reagents on the Arabidopsis KAT1 K+ channel with Cys residues engineered in the S4 α-helix (25Latorre R.

Physiol. 2003; 122: 459-469Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar) and for block by S-methioylation of endogenous Cys in mammalian pacemaker channels (24Xue T. Li R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 46233-46242Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Similar results were obtained in recordings of SKOR-C228S/C234S, although the mutant showed a slower rate of current decay with MTS additions. Compared with the half-time for bath exchange (3 s), these rates of current block suggested that sites within the channel were accessible to the MTS reagents only some fraction of the time. However, SKOR-C168S currents were unaffected by additions of these MTS reagents (Fig. 3B and inset) and yielded a nominal mean half-time for current decay statistically equivalent to that of currents from SKOR-expressing cells treated with buffer alone (not shown). By contrast, treatments with MMTS led to a rapid loss of current with wild-type SKOR essentially within the time scale of the bath exchange. A marginally slower block was evident in the SKOR-C168S mutant, but a significant slowing of current block was seen only with SKOR-C228S/C234S (Fig. 3C and inset). These findings underscore differential sensitivities of the two SKOR mutants to Cys S-methioylation, a resistance of SKOR-C168S to water-soluble MTS reagents from the outside, and SKOR-C228S/C234S to the lipid-soluble reagent, consistent with the idea that Cys168 is exposed to the aqueous phase at the outer surface of the membrane. Opening of the pore in Kv-like channels depends on rotation of the pore-lining S5 and S6 α-helices coupled to movement of the voltage sensor complex of the S1–S4 α-helices (26Long S.B. Campbell E.B. Mackinnon R. Science. 2005; 309: 903-908Crossref PubMed Scopus (802) Google Scholar). Charged residues within the S4 α-helix are thought to help drive movement of the voltage sensor as the membrane is biased toward an inside-positive electric field. Uncertainties about the extent of movement aside (27Tombola F. Pathak M.M. Isacoff E.Y. Neuron. 2005; 48: 719-725Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar), this model fits remarkably well with the present understanding of plant K+ channels (25Latorre R. Olcese R. Basso C. Gonzalez C. Munoz F. Cosmelli D. Alvarez O. J. Gen. Physiol. 2003; 122: 459-469Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 28Lai H.C. Grabe M. Jan Y.N. Jan L.Y. Neuron. 2005; 47: 395-406Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar), and it raises a question whether access of H2O2 to Cys168, and, hence, the sensitivity of SKOR to the ROS, might be voltage-dependent. Indeed, sequence alignments and homology mapping of SKOR to Kv1.2 (16Dreyer I. Blatt M.R. Trends Plant Sci. 2009; 14: 383-390Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar, 18Gajdanowicz P. Garcia-Mata C. Gonzalez W. Morales-Navarro S.E. Sharma T. González-Nilo F.D. Gutowicz J. Mueller-Roeber B. Blatt M.R. Dreyer I. New Phytol. 2009; 182: 380-391Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar) place Cys168 close to the S3–S4 linker within the S3 α-helix of the voltage sensor, and thus near the outer surface of the membrane. To test the voltage dependence of SKOR sensitivity to external H2O2, we used a simple extended protocol of 20 s, cycling repeatedly between −50 and +80 mV as before. In this case, the cycles were varied (Fig. 4, schematic insets) to give relative time distributions of 0.95:0.05 at voltages favoring either channel opening (+80 mV) or closing (−50 mV). In control experiments, both protocols yielded similar SKOR currents and activation kinetics (not shown). However, adding 10 mm H2O2 yielded very different results depending on time-averaged balance of clamp voltages (Fig. 4). With the balance of clamp voltages favoring the open channel at +80 mV, adding H2O2 gave a rapid enhancement of the SKOR current, analogous to the effects observed previously (Fig. 2). By contrast, with the time-averaged balance of clamp voltage favoring the closed channel at −50 mV, adding H2O2 showed only marginal enhancement of the current over the subsequent 10–15 min of recording. Similar results were obtained in each of 6 independent experiments and showed a near-proportional dependence of current enhancement in H2O2 as a function of the time fraction at voltages opening the channel (Fig. 4, inset), consistent with a voltage-dependent change in accessibility of the H2O2-sensitive site during SKOR gating. SKOR plays an important role in K+ loading of the xylem and its delivery to the shoot by the transpiration stream; the skor null mutation reduces K+ content of the shoot and affects partitioning of other mineral nutrients within the plant (14Gaymard F.

Plant J. 2010; 61: 839-853Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). Reactive oxygen species and related signals also affect translocation of K+ and other mineral nutrients to the shoot (30Armengaud P. Breitling R. Amtmann A. Plant Physiol. 2004; 136: 2556-2576Crossref PubMed Scopus (364) Google Scholar, 31Wilkinson S. Davies W.J. Plant Cell Environ. 2002; 25: 195-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (740) Google Scholar, 32Shin R.

We reasoned that if the ROS dependence of K+ partitioning is mediated by SKOR, then deletion of the K+ channel should suppress the associated changes in K+ distribution to the shoot in the presence of Na+ and exogenous H2O2. To test this idea we grew wild-type Arabidopsis and mutants skor (14Gaymard F. Pilot G. Lacombe B. Bouchez D. Bruneau D. Boucherez J. Michaux-Ferrière N. Thibaud J.B. Sentenac H.

Plant. 1962; 15: 473-497Crossref Scopus (52758) Google Scholar) alone, with 40 and 80 mm NaCl and 0.1 and 0.5 mm H2O2. The rhd2 mutant is impaired in NADPH oxidase activity and suppresses stress-induced ROS production and associated changes in nutrient transport, although wild-type characteristics are recovered with exogenous H2O2 (32Shin R. Schachtman D.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2004; 101: 8827-8832Crossref PubMed Scopus (430) Google Scholar). Thus, we anticipated the effects on K+ partitioning to mirror that of the skor mutant. Fig. 5 summarizes data for tissue K+ concentrations and K+/Na+ ratios in the wild-type, skor, and rhd2 mutant Arabidopsis lines assayed 8 days after transfer to fresh medium alone and with the additions of NaCl and H2O2. We found that K+ concentrations in shoot and root tissue of the wild-type plants increased with increasing NaCl in the medium although the K+/Na+ ratios decreased significantly, especially in the shoot, consistent with past observations (12Amtmann A. Blatt M.R. Yeo A.R. Flowers T. Plant Solute Transport. Blackwells, Oxford2007: 99-132Google Scholar, 33Essah P.A. Davenport R. Tester M.

Biologies. 2009; 332: 784-794Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Increasing H2O2 challenge had a similar, albeit much weaker effect. No significant differences were apparent in root K+ concentrations or K+/Na+ ratios between wild-type and the mutant lines for any of the treatments. However, both mutants were severely impaired in K+ partitioning to the shoot and in maintenance of K+/Na+ ratios. Consistent with previous studies (14Gaymard F. Pilot G. Lacombe B. Bouchez D. Bruneau D. Boucherez J. Michaux-Ferrière N. Thibaud J.B. Sentenac H. Cell. 1998; 94: 647-655Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (559) Google Scholar), the skor mutant showed a 35% reduction in K+ content when grown under standard conditions. More important, treatments with NaCl and H2O2 failed to promote the K+ concentration in the shoot resulting in an attenuation in shoot K+ content to ∼50% of the wild-type in the presence of 80 mm NaCl and 0.5 mm H2O2. The rhd2 mutant mirrored the skor phenotype under salt stress, displaying significantly lower shoot K+ concentrations and K+/Na+ ratios than the wild-type plants. These results indicate (i) that SKOR and RHD2 affect partitioning of K+ to the shoot, (ii) that both gene products are required for increasing shoot K+ concentrations under salt stress, and (ii"

To decipher this interaction at molecular and colloidal levels, the binding of 4 procyanidin dimers (B1-4) and 1 trimer (C2) to a human saliva proline-rich peptide, IB7(14), was studied. Interactions have been characterized by measuring dissociation constants, sizes of complexes, number, and nature of binding sites using NMR (chemical shift variations, diffusion-ordered spectroscopy, and saturation transfer diffusion). The binding sites were identified using molecular mechanics, and the hydrophilic/hydrophobic nature of the interactions was resolved by calculating the molecular lipophilicity potential within the complexes. The following comprehensive scheme can be proposed: 1) below the tannin critical micelle concentration (CMC), interaction is specific, and the procyanidin anchorage always occurs on the same three IB7(14) sites. The tannin 3-dimensional structure plays a key role in the binding force and in the tannin's ability to act as a bidentate ligand: tannins adopting an extended conformation exhibit higher affinity toward protein and initiate the formation of a network. 2) Above the CMC, after the first specific hydrophilic interaction has taken place, a random hydrophobic stacking occurs between tannins and proteins. The whole process is discussed in the general frame of wine tannins eliciting astringency."
https://openalex.org/W2101126087,"Although saturated and monounsaturated very-long-chain fatty acids (VLCFAs) have long been associated with undesirable effects on health, including obesity, heart failure, and atherosclerosis, the physiological role of endogenous synthesis is largely unknown. The fatty acid elongase ELOVL3 is involved in the synthesis of C20–C24 saturated and monounsaturated VLCFAs mainly in liver, brown and white adipose tissue, and triglyceride-rich glands such as the sebaceous and meibomian glands. Here we show that ablation of ELOVL3 leads to reduced adiponectin levels, constrained expansion of adipose tissue, and resistance against diet-induced obesity, a situation that is more exaggerated in female mice. Both female and male knockout mice show reduced hepatic lipogenic gene expression and triglyceride content, a situation that is associated with reduced de novo fatty acid synthesis and uptake. As a consequence, the VLDL-triglyceride level in serum is significantly reduced. Remarkably, despite increased energy expenditure, markedly reduced serum levels of leptin, and increased expression of orexigenic peptides in the hypothalamus, the Elovl3−/− mice do not compensate by increased food intake. Thus, these results reveal that C20–C22 saturated and monounsaturated VLCFAs produced by ELOVL3 are indispensable for appropriate synthesis of liver triglycerides, fatty acid uptake, and storage in adipose tissue.—Zadravec, D., Brolinson, A., Fisher, R.

https://openalex.org/W2051939573,"During apoptosis, the pro-apoptotic Bcl-2 family proteins BAK and BAX form large oligomeric pores in the mitochondrial outer membrane. Apoptotic factors, including cytochrome c, are released through these pores from the mitochondrial intermembrane space into the cytoplasm where they initiate the cascade of events leading to cell death. To better understand this pivotal step toward apoptosis, a method was developed to induce membrane permeabilization by BAK in the membrane without using the full-length protein. Using a soluble form of BAK with a hexahistidine tag at the C terminus and a liposomal system containing the Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid lipid analog that can bind hexahistidine-tagged proteins, BAK oligomers were formed in the presence of the activator protein p7/p15Bid. In this system, we determined the conformational changes in BAK upon membrane insertion by applying the site-directed spin labeling method of EPR to 13 different amino acid locations. Upon membrane insertion, the BH3 domains were reorganized, and the α5-α6 helical hairpin structure was partially exposed to the membrane environment. The monomer-monomer interface in the oligomeric structure was also mapped by measuring the distance-dependent spin-spin interactions for each residue location.

IntroductionIn mitochondrial apoptosis, the mitochondrial outer membrane is permeabilized by either BAX (Bcl-2-associated X protein) or its homolog BAK (Bcl-2 antagonist/killer) (Fig. 1) (1Chipuk J.E.

Upon arrival of cell death signals, BAX and BAK are activated and form large pores in the outer membrane of mitochondria with an estimated diameter of ∼30–60 Å (Fig. 1B) (2Saito M. Korsmeyer S.J.

As a result of the pore formation, many apoptosis-promoting proteins, including cytochrome c, escape from the mitochondrial intermembrane space into the cytoplasm of the cell through the BAX (or BAK) pore (2Saito M.

The EPR spectrum of the spin-labeled residue provides information regarding the dynamic nature of the labeled site (25Barnes J.P. Liang Z. Mchaourab H.S. Freed J.H. Hubbell W.L. Biophys.

The accessibility parameters for a spin-labeled residue measured by the power saturation method can be used to determine the topological location of the residue either in a soluble protein or in a membrane protein (27Altenbach C.

Furthermore, using the spin-spin interactions between two labels in close proximity, distance can be readily determined (29Rabenstein M.D. Shin Y.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Chemphyschem. 2002; 3: 927-932Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar).Inspired by our earlier observation that targeting of a Bid BH3 peptide to the membrane surface significantly enhances its potency in BAX activation (32Oh K.J.

Cell. 2006; 24: 199-210Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar), in this study we have developed a proteoliposomal system that markedly enhances the membrane permeabilizing activity of a soluble form of BAK. Using a Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid (Ni-NTA) liposomal system that can conjugate hexahistidine-tagged proteins to the surface of the simulated outer mitochondrial membrane, we demonstrate that nanomolar concentrations of the soluble form of BAK when targeted to the membrane surface can efficiently permeabilize the membrane. Furthermore, tBid further enhances the membrane permeabilization by the membrane-targeted BAK, whereas Bcl-XL inhibits it, demonstrating the biological relevance of this system.Utilizing the Ni-NTA liposomal system above, we also carried out the SDSL experiment to determine the conformational changes that occur in BAK upon membrane insertion. For SDSL experiments, 13 different residue locations were selected in BAK that represent various domains or structural elements. They include the following: (i) the residues in and around the BH3 domain, (ii) the residues in the α5-α6 helical hairpin structure, and (iii) the residues in other loops and α-helices. By comparing the EPR spectra and the accessibility parameters for the 13 spin-labeled protein samples both in the solution and in the membrane-inserted state, we determined the conformational changes occurring at various locations in BAK upon membrane insertion. The topological locations of these residues in the membrane-inserted state were determined. Furthermore, the monomer-monomer interface in the oligomeric structure was also mapped by measuring the spin-spin interactions for each residue location. The data provide new insights into the structure of the BAK homodimer and advance our knowledge of the mechanism of membrane permeabilization by BAK or BAX.RESULTSReconstitution of BAK Apoptotic Machinery in an Artificial Membrane as a Platform for Structure/Function Studies on BAKBecause of the technical difficulty in expressing full-length BAK protein in E. coli, soluble protein constructs of mouse BAK (sBAK, residues 16–184) were generated as shown in Fig. 2A. These sBAK constructs contain all the α-helices except the C-terminal helix α9 that is believed to be a transmembrane helix keeping the BAK protein tethered to the mitochondrial outer membrane. We reasoned that the tethering role of the helix α9 could be replaced with a C-terminal hexahistidine (His6) tag that can bind to the Ni-NTA moiety present on the membrane surface. Thus, we tested the membrane permeabilizing activity of these sBAK constructs with or without the C-terminal His6 tag in the Ni-NTA liposomal system containing 5% DOGS-NTA-Ni and other lipids mimicking the composition of the mitochondrial outer membrane contact sites (Fig. 2B) (32Oh K.J. Barbuto S. Pitter K. Morash J. Walensky L.D. Korsmeyer S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 36999-37008Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). The sBAK alone at 10 nm did not permeabilize the membrane efficiently (Fig. 2C, green trace). In the presence of the truncated Bid (tBid, 50 nm), which is known to target to the membrane and activate BAK and BAX via its BH3 domain (Fig. 2B), there was a modest increase in the membrane permeabilization by sBAK (Fig. 2C, blue trace). This indicates that in sBAK the binding site for the Bid BH3 domain is still fully or partially functional despite the lack of the N- and the C-terminal sequences.To test whether the activity of sBAK can be further enhanced by membrane targeting, we tested sBAK with a C-terminal His6 tag (sBAK-ΔC-His) (Fig. 2A). When sBAK-ΔC-His (10 nm) was added to the Ni-NTA-MCS LUVs, there was a marked enhancement in the release of the 10-kDa FITC-dextran molecules both in the initial rate and the final extent of release (Fig. 2C, red trace). Note that FITC-dextran 10 (10 kDa) is comparable with cytochrome c (13 kDa) in its size. Thus, this result indicates that sBAK-ΔC-His efficiently permeabilized the membrane. Furthermore, the membrane permeabilization by sBAK-ΔC-His was dose-dependent over the concentration range of 0.1–20 nm (see supplemental Fig. S4B). These data indicate that sBAK can readily permeabilize the membrane once it is targeted to the membrane at nanomolar concentrations. Additionally, tBid further enhanced the membrane permeabilization by sBAK-ΔC-His (Fig. 2C, black trace). The effect of tBid was observed over a wide range of concentrations of sBAK-ΔC-His (0.1–20 nm; see supplemental Fig S4D). These results demonstrate that tBid interacts with the membrane-targeted sBAK and further promotes the membrane permeabilization by sBAK-ΔC-His.To test whether the membrane targeting of sBAK-ΔC-His was specifically mediated by the interaction between the His6 tag and the Ni-NTA moieties on the liposomal surface, we measured the effect of the metal chelator EDTA on the membrane permeabilizing activity. In the presence of 5 mm EDTA that was used to abstract the Ni2+ ions from the Ni-NTA moieties, the membrane permeabilization activity of sBAK-ΔC-His was completely abolished in the absence of tBid (Fig. 2C, orange trace). This indicates that sBAK-ΔC-His was indeed targeted to the Ni-NTA liposomal membrane surface by the specific interactions between the C-terminal His6 tag and the Ni-NTA groups present on the liposomal surface. In the presence of tBid, however, EDTA significantly reduced the membrane permeabilization by sBAK-ΔC-His but not completely (Fig. 2C, dark red). This is expected because tBid could recruit sBAK-ΔC-His to the membrane as if it were sBAK (Fig. 2C, blue trace) and because EDTA would not affect the activity of tBid in activating sBAK significantly (supplemental Fig. S4E).To test whether the membrane permeabilization by sBAK-ΔC-His is indeed mediated by the BAK protein itself, rather than by other contaminants, a mutant sBAK-ΔC-His with a G124V amino acid substitution mutation (sBAK/G124V-ΔC-His) was tested. This mutation is known to abrogate the activity of the human BAK in vivo (15Dewson G. Kratina T. Sim H.W. Puthalakath H. Adams J.M. Colman P.M. Kluck R.M. Mol. Cell. 2008; 30: 369-380Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar). The activity of the sBAK/G124V-ΔC-His was significantly compromised in the presence (Fig. 2C, gray trace) or absence (Fig. 2C, violet trace) of tBid. These results clearly showed that the membrane permeabilization by sBAK-ΔC-His was indeed mediated by the functional activity of the sBAK protein and not by artifacts. The results taken together clearly demonstrated that the tethering role of the transmembrane helix α9 could be substituted with a chemical (His6 tag/Ni-NTA) and/or a biological (tBid) means. Furthermore, these results also suggest that sBAK retains the membrane-permeabilizing functions and thus the truncated sequences of BAK, i.e. the N-terminal 13 amino acid residues and the C-terminal TM helix α9 are not absolutely necessary for the membrane permeabilization.Additionally, we investigated the effect of the antiapoptotic protein, Bcl-XL, on the activity of sBAK-ΔC-His in the presence or absence of tBid. Bcl-XL is known to inhibit the functions of the proapoptotic proteins such as tBid, BAX, and BAK, by heterodimerizing with them, thus enhancing the cell survival (52Sedlak T.W. Oltvai Z.N. Yang E.

As shown in Fig. 2D (blue trace), the Bcl-XL expressed as a fusion protein (GST-Bcl-XL-ΔC-His, C-terminally His6-tagged wild type Bcl-XL fused to a glutathione S-transferase) completely abrogated the membrane permeabilization mediated by sBAK-ΔC-His and tBid. The same result was observed in the absence of tBid (data not shown). In contrast, a mutant form of Bcl-XL with G138E/R139L/I140N triple amino acid substitutions (GST-Bcl-XL-ΔC-His (m8)), which lost its heterodimerizing activity (55Cheng E.H. Wei M.C. Weiler S. Flavell R.A. Mak T.W. Lindsten T. Korsmeyer S.J. Mol. Cell. 2001; 8: 705-711Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1416) Google Scholar), did not block the membrane permeabilization by sBAK-ΔC-His and tBid (Fig. 2D, red trace). These results show that Bcl-XL can specifically inhibit the membrane permeabilization by sBAK-ΔC-His, thus displaying its antiapoptotic effect against sBAK-ΔC-His and/or tBid.Finally, to find the most active form of Bid in promoting the membrane permeabilization by sBAK-ΔC-His for SDSL experiments, we compared the activity of the His6-tagged Bid BH3 domain (32Oh K.J. Barbuto S. Pitter K. Morash J. Walensky L.D. Korsmeyer S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 36999-37008Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar) and two different forms of Bid, i.e. tBid and the N-terminally His6-tagged p7/p15Bid (p7/p15Bid). As shown in Fig. 2E, all these reagents were almost equally effective in enhancing the membrane permeabilization by sBAK-ΔC-His at 2 nm. Therefore, p7/p15 Bid was chosen for further studies because it could be conveniently prepared by digesting full-length Bid (p22 Bid) with caspase-8 (37Luo X. Budihardjo I. Zou H. Slaughter C. Wang X. Cell. 1998; 94: 481-490Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3062) Google Scholar).The above results showed that the functions of the representative members of the Bcl-2 proteins, i.e. the proapoptotic multidomain protein BAK, the proapoptotic “BH3 only protein” Bid, and the antiapoptotic protein Bcl-XL, can be recapitulated in the artificial system we used, reconstituting the BAK apoptotic machinery in a cell-free system. Thus, we have generated a convenient, biologically relevant platform with which the membrane permeabilization process by BAK can be studied by various means, including the SDSL method of EPR.Functional Integrity of the Spin-labeled BAK Proteins and the Adaptation of the Liposomal Release Assay Conditions to the SDSL ExperimentsTo study the conformational changes in BAK upon membrane insertion and oligomerization, we chose 13 different residue locations in BAK for an SDSL study (Fig. 3A). They are as follows: (i) residues 75 and 83 from the α2-α3 helix-loop-helix structure in the solution state, which encompasses the BH3 domain (residues 76–85) that is known to be essential in the homodimerization of BAK (15Dewson G.

Cell. 2008; 30: 369-380Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar); (ii) residues 122, 132–134, 146, 154, and 164 all of which are located in the α5-α6 helical hairpin structure that has been hypothesized to insert into the membrane upon membrane insertion of BAK (56Muchmore S.W.

Cell Biol. 2006; 18: 685-689Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar); and (iii) residues 30, 55, 99, and 107 that are located at helix α1, the α1-α2 loop, the α3-α4 loop, and the helix 4, respectively, which partially sandwich the helical hairpin structure.After labeling the single cysteine mutant proteins with the spin label MTSSL, the labeling efficiency was determined for each of the spin-labeled side chain R1 residues (Fig. 3B). Residues 30R1, 55R1, 83R1, 99R1, 122R1, 146R1, 154R1, and 164R1 had labeling efficiency higher than 80%. Residues 75R1 and 107R1 had lower efficiency than the former group. Residues 132–134 that are expected to be located in the interior of the protein in solution state displayed very low labeling efficiency in contrast to other more-exposed residues mentioned (Fig. 3, A and C). To test if all the spin-labeled proteins were functionally intact, we performed the liposomal release assay (Fig. 3D). Most of the proteins retained membrane permeabilizing activity comparable with or slightly less than the parent molecule sBAK/C154S-ΔC-His. The activity of BAK/132R1 (i.e. sBAK/C154S/132R1-ΔC-His) was reduced to the level of the functionally defective G124V mutant (Fig. 2, A and C), indicating that cysteine mutation and/or spin labeling at this location compromised its function.EPR Data for the Spin-labeled Soluble BAK Proteins Are Consistent with the Structural Model for the Soluble Mouse BAKThe EPR spectra for the R1 residues attached to the solution state of mouse BAK show location-dependent variations in their mobility (Fig. 4A, black traces). Residues such as 55R1, 132R1, and 134R1, predicted to be located in the interior of the protein in solution state, show a spectral feature representing a spin population that is severely restricted in motion, which is denoted in Fig. 4A by the dotted vertical line marked with “i” (immobile). Other residues show EPR spectra that indicate more rapidly tumbling nitroxide side chains (R1s), denoted in Fig. 4A by the dotted line marked with “m” (mobile). The accessibility parameters, Π(O2) and Π(NiEDDA), for the solution state also showed variations reflecting their predicted topological locations (Fig. 4B). The accessibility parameters Π(O2) and Π(NiEDDA) are proportional to the frequency of collision between the R1 residue and each of the added collision reagents, i.e. the molecular oxygen or the hydrophilic nickel complex NiEDDA (28Altenbach C. Froncisz W. Hemker R. McHaourab H. Hubbell W.L. Biophys. J. 2005; 89: 2103-2112Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). In solution state, these parameters measure the solvent accessibility of a given R1 residue. As expected, residues 55R1, 132R1, and 134R1 that are predicted to be located in the protein interior by the homology model showed small Π(O2) values and very small Π(NiEDDA) values (Fig. 4B). Other residues had relatively large values of Π(O2) and Π(NiEDDA) (Fig. 4B). These observations are consistent with the mouse homology model.FIGURE 4EPR spectra and accessibility parameters of the spin label side chain R1s.

https://openalex.org/W2099645196,"The feline leukemia virus subgroup C receptor (FLVCR) is a heme export protein that is required for proerythroblast survival and facilitates macrophage heme iron recycling. However, its mechanism of heme export and substrate specificity are uncharacterized. Using [55Fe]heme and the fluorescent heme analog zinc mesoporphyrin, we investigated whether export by FLVCR depends on the availability and avidity of extracellular heme-binding proteins. Export was 100-fold more efficient when the medium contained hemopexin (Kd < 1 pm) compared with albumin (Kd = 5 nm) at the same concentration and was not detectable when the medium lacked heme-binding proteins. Besides heme, FLVCR could export other cyclic planar porphyrins, such as protoporphyrin IX and coproporphyrin. However, FLVCR has a narrow substrate range because unconjugated bilirubin, the primary breakdown product of heme, was not transported. As neither protoporphyrin IX nor coproporphyrin export improved with extracellular hemopexin (versus albumin), our observations further suggest that hemopexin, an abundant protein with a serum concentration (6.7–25 μm) equivalent to that of the iron transport protein transferrin (22–31 μm), by accepting heme from FLVCR and targeting it to the liver, might regulate macrophage heme export and heme iron recycling in vivo. Final studies show that hemopexin directly interacts with FLVCR, which also helps explain why FLVCR, in contrast to some major facilitator superfamily members, does not function as a bidirectional gradient-dependent transporter. Together, these data argue that hemopexin has a role in assuring systemic iron balance during homeostasis in addition to its established role as a scavenger during internal bleeding or hemolysis.

The biological roles of heme are diverse and encompass most areas of cell metabolism and gene regulation. Heme serves as a prosthetic group in the hemeproteins, which are involved in crucial biological functions, including oxygen binding (hemoglobin and myoglobin), oxygen metabolism (oxidases, peroxidases, catalases, and hydroxylases), electron transfer (cytochromes) (4Ponka P. Blood. 1997; 89: 1-25Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and signal transduction (nitric-oxide synthases) (5Stuehr D.J. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 1997; 37: 339-359Crossref PubMed Scopus (453) Google Scholar). In addition, heme serves as a signaling molecule in erythropoiesis and other physiological systems. Because heme generally signals by binding and inactivating a transcriptional repressor (e.g. Bach1) or translational inhibitor (e.g. heme-regulated inhibitor and thus eIFα2 kinase), its impact is immediate (6Suzuki H.

Perhaps for this reason, heme is utilized in time-sensitive processes, such as the regulation of circadian rhythm (9Yin L. Wu N. Curtin J.C. Qatanani M. Szwergold N.R. Reid R.A. Waitt G.M. Parks D.J.

Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2008; 105: 76-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar), and globin synthesis. Heme is also required for microRNA processing (11Faller M. Matsunaga M. Yin S. Loo J.A. Guo F. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2007; 14: 23-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar). However, excess free or non-protein-bound heme damages lipid, protein, and DNA through the generation of reactive oxygen species, resulting in cellular injury and death (12Kumar S. Bandyopadhyay U. Toxicol. Lett. 2005; 157: 175-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (613) Google Scholar). Therefore, free cellular heme levels must be tightly regulated to provide an adequate supply yet avoid heme toxicities (4Ponka P. Blood. 1997; 89: 1-25Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 13Tsiftsoglou A.S. Tsamadou A.I. Papadopoulou L.C. Pharmacol. Ther. 2006; 111: 327-345Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar, 14Sassa S. J.

Most studies of heme homeostasis focus on its biosynthesis and degradation. The rate of heme biosynthesis varies significantly among various cells and tissues and is especially high in hepatocytes and erythroid cells, where large amounts of heme are required for cytochrome P450 and hemoglobin, respectively (4Ponka P.

If sufficient iron is available, ferrochelatase inserts the iron into PPIX, completing heme synthesis.

Virol. 1999; 73: 6500-6505Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Inhibition of FLVCR function in the human erythroid cell line K562 decreases heme export, impairs erythroid maturation, and leads to apoptosis (1Quigley J.G. Yang Z. Worthington M.T. Phillips J.D.

FLVCR-null mice lack definitive erythropoiesis, and mice with FLVCR that is deleted neonatally develop severe macrocytic anemia with proerythroblast maturation arrest (2Keel S.B. Doty R.T. Yang Z. Quigley J.G. Chen J. Knoblaugh S. Kingsley P.D. De Domenico I. Vaughn M.B. Kaplan J. Palis J. Abkowitz J.L. Science. 2008; 319: 825-828Crossref PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar), arguing that erythroid precursors export excess heme to ensure survival. Interestingly, FLVCR-deleted mice develop iron overload in macrophages, liver, and duodenum. These data suggest that the iron homeostatic cycle includes heme export at these sites. This hypothesis is supported by direct observations that FLVCR-deficient macrophages accumulate more ferritin than wild-type macrophages when ingesting opsonized red cells (2Keel S.B. Doty R.T. Yang Z. Quigley J.G. Chen J. Knoblaugh S. Kingsley P.D. De Domenico I. Vaughn M.B. Kaplan J. Palis J. Abkowitz J.L. Science. 2008; 319: 825-828Crossref PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar). The goal of this study was to determine how FLVCR-mediated heme export occurs and whether FLVCR has limited substrate specificity or can also transport structurally and metabolically related compounds. We demonstrate that the substrate specificity of FLVCR export involves heme and proximal planar porphyrins, but not bilirubin; that the export of heme is preferentially facilitated by hemopexin; and that hemopexin binds to FLVCR at a site thought to be important for heme export. A physiological role for hemopexin in heme iron recycling may explain the very high serum concentrations of hemopexin, 0.55–1.25 mg/ml (9.2–20.8 μm) in mice (19Liang X. Lin T. Sun G. Beasley-Topliffe L. Cavaillon J.M. Warren H.S. J. Leukocyte Biol. 2009; 86: 229-235Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar) and 0.4–1.5 mg/ml (6.7–25 μm) in humans (20Delanghe J.R. Langlois M.R.

Wild-type dynamin-GFP and dominant-negative K44A dynamin-GFP (21De Domenico I. Ward D.M. Langelier C. Vaughn M.B. Nemeth E. Sundquist W.I. Ganz T. Musci G. Kaplan J. Mol. Biol.

FLVCR-null and littermate control mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) isolated from day 12.5 embryos (2Keel S.B. Doty R.T. Yang Z. Quigley J.G. Chen J. Knoblaugh S. Kingsley P.D. De Domenico I.

The MTT assay (American Type Culture Collection, Manassas, VA) was performed as described previously (22Calligaris S. Cekic D. Roca-Burgos L. Gerin F. Mazzone G. Ostrow J.D. Tiribelli C. FEBS Lett. 2006; 580: 1355-1359Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Human peripheral blood was obtained from normal donors with an approved protocol from the University of Washington. Mononuclear cells were isolated from blood with lymphocyte separation medium (Mediatech, Inc., Herndon, VA) as described previously (23Abkowitz J.L. Taboada M.R. Sabo K.M. Shelton G.H. Stem Cells. 1998; 16: 288-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Monocytes/macrophages were subsequently isolated by plastic adherence for 18 h in Iscove's modified Dulbecco's medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 20% FBS, 1% BSA, penicillin/streptomycin/Fungizone, and 10 ng/ml macrophage colony-stimulating factor (PeproTech, Rocky Hill, NJ). Adherent cells were cultured for an additional 5 days to generate mature macrophages. Intact apohemopexin was isolated from rabbit serum as described previously (24Smith A. Morgan W.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 12049-12053Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This protein is free of contaminants, binds heme as characterized and quantitated following published procedures and extinction coefficients (25Eskew J.D. Vanacore R.M. Sung L. Morales P.J. Smith A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 638-648Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar), and is not toxic for cells (26Li R.C. Saleem S. Zhen G. Cao W. Zhuang H. Lee J. Smith A. Altruda F. Tolosano E. Doré S. J. Cereb. Blood Flow Metab. 2009; 29: 953-964Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). NRK/FLVCR and NRK/Neo cell lines were grown on 8-well chamber slides (BD Biosciences) in complete medium until near confluency. ZnMP export studies were performed, as described previously (27Worthington M.T. Cohn S.M. Miller S.K. Luo R.Q. Berg C.L. Am. J. Physiol. Gastrointest. Liver Physiol. 2001; 280: G1172-G1177Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), by preloading for 30 min at 37 °C using 5 μm ZnMP (Frontier Scientific, Logan, UT) dissolved in cell culture-grade Me2SO at a concentration of 4 mm and then diluted to 5 μm in working buffer (25 mm HEPES (pH 7.4), 130 mm NaCl, 10 mm KCl, 1 mm CaCl2, and 1 mm MgSO4) containing 2.5 μm BSA (Sigma). Next, the cells were washed three times and incubated in working buffer with either albumin or hemopexin at the desired concentrations for up to 90 min at 37 °C. Export was determined by comparison of residual intracellular fluorescence on microscopic images using a Nikon upright Eclipse E600 microscope and Texas Red filter with excitation at 540–580 nm and emission at 600–680 nm. For quantitative studies, ZnMP export was also performed using flow cytometry. NRK/FLVCR and NRK/Neo cell lines were trypsinized, washed, and resuspended in working buffer contain 2.5 μm BSA. The cells were then processed as described above. Export was quantitated by comparing residual intracellular fluorescence at channel FL2 using a BD FACScan instrument (BD Biosciences). For [55Fe]heme uptake and export studies, cells were seeded in 12-well dishes and allowed to attach overnight in culture medium. They were incubated in working buffer with 5 μm ZnMP (included only for export studies) and 2.5 μm BSA for 15 min, and [55Fe]hemin (RI Consultants LLC, Hudson, NH) was added to a final concentration of 0.9 μm for an additional 30 min. The cells were washed three times and then harvested as described below for uptake studies or incubated with either albumin or hemopexin at the desired concentrations for 90 min at 37 °C for export studies. To measure cellular radioactivity, the cells were rinsed twice with working buffer, detached from the plates by a 15-min incubation with 0.1 n NaOH, mixed with liquid scintillation mixture (MP Biomedicals, Solon, OH), and placed in an LF 5000 CE liquid scintillation counter (Beckman Coulter, Brea, CA). Radioactive counts (cpm) were normalized by total cell protein content and are presented as the mean ± S.D. of three replicate samples. To combine multiple experiments for statistical analysis, NRK/Neo control cells were considered to have 100% uptake, and all other samples within each experiment were normalized to the NRK/Neo data. Two FLVCR peptide-GST fusion proteins were generated as immunogens in an attempt to elicit anti-FLVCR antibody. The first fusion peptide contained amino acids 132–201 (and thus His145 and His198), and the second fusion peptide contained amino acids 262–369 (and no histidine residue). During the terminal purification steps, the first (but not second) peptide was red in color and had Soret absorption at ∼425 nm compared with GST alone, and HPLC confirmed heme binding (data not shown). This fragment was subsequently used as an immunogen to generate antibody to FLVCR. 4Z. Yang, J. D. Philips, R. T. Doty, and J. L. Abkowitz, unpublished data. FLVCR peptide-GST fusion protein and GST alone in a 1:2 dilution series (72.5–580 nm) were coated onto 96-well Pro-BindTM microplates (Becton Dickinson Labware, Franklin Lakes, NJ) at 100 μl/well at 4 °C overnight. After incubation with 1% BSA in PBS for 2 h, hemopexin (290 nm) was added and allowed to bind to the FLVCR peptide-GST fusion (or control) protein for 2 h. Next, rabbit anti-hemopexin antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) at 1 μg/ml and horseradish peroxidase-labeled goat anti-rabbit antibody (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, West Grove, PA) at 0.5 μg/ml were added sequentially. The microplate was washed with PBS three times for 5 min after each incubation with hemopexin and antibodies. The color-developing reaction was carried out by incubation with 3,3′,5,5′-tetramethylbenzidine chromogenic solution (Sigma) for 10 min and stopped by the addition of 2 m H2SO4 according to the manufacturer's instructions. The known concentration of hemopexin in a 1:2 dilution series (36.25–290 nm) was used to standardize the assay results. For the competitive binding study, the FLVCR peptide-GST fusion protein was incubated for 1 h at room temperature with or without heme at a 1:1 molar ratio before coating onto the microplate. Competitive binding studies were also performed by adding the FLVCR peptide-GST fusion protein at a 1:1 molar ratio to hemopexin prior to its binding to the FLVCR peptide-GST fusion protein-coated microplate. NRK/FLVCR and NRK/Neo cells were cultured in 12-well dishes as described above and incubated in working buffer containing 10 μm BSA and 10 μm highly purified [3H]UCB (specific activity of 10.8 mCi/mmol) biosynthetically labeled in dogs (28Bayón J.E.

Malik S.G. Ostrow J.D. Tiribelli C. Pediatr. Res. 2006; 60: 724-728Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). After 1, 10, and 30 min, the cells were washed three times with working buffer, and bilirubin uptake was then determined from cell-associated radioactivity. Bilirubin export was studied using cells preloaded for 30 min as described above, washed three times with working buffer, and incubated for 0, 30, or 90 min in working buffer containing 151.5 μm (1%) BSA. Exported [3H]UCB was washed off with working buffer, and retained [3H]UCB was quantitated and normalized to total cell protein content. NRK cells in cell culture complete medium were supplemented with 1 mm ALA for up to 24 h to induce the synthesis of PPIX. At time points of 12 and 24 h, respectively, cell culture supernatants were collected, and cell pellets were harvested and briefly rinsed with PBS. Both supernatants and cell pellets were stored at −80 °C until ready for process of analysis. The extraction of heme and porphyrins was adapted from previously described methods (31Smith K.M. Porphyrins and Metalloporphyrins. Elsevier Scientific Publishing Co., Amsterdam1975Google Scholar). Cell culture media (10-ml fractions) were extracted in parallel three times with 10 ml of ethyl acetate/acetic acid (2:1, v/v) and then washed twice with 0.5 volume of saturated sodium acetate. The sodium acetate washings were also extracted with fresh ethyl acetate and combined with the original extract, which was then washed once with 0.1 volume of 3% (w/v) sodium acetate and dried down with argon. Samples were dissolved in buffer, and the heme and porphyrins were separated by HPLC as described (32Lübben M. Morand K. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 21473-21479Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Standards of heme, porphyrins, and ZnMP (all from Frontier Scientific) were used for peak identification and quantification. The flow cytometric analysis of protoporphyrin export by NRK/FLVCR and NRK/Neo cells was performed using methods similar to those described for the ZnMP export study described above except that PPIX (Frontier Scientific) was substituted for ZnMP, and residual intracellular fluorescence was analyzed at channel FL3. To understand the mechanism of heme export by FLVCR, we first studied the export of ZnMP, a fluorescent heme analog. ZnMP traffics similarly to heme and also inhibits heme degradation by competitively blocking heme oxygenase activity (27Worthington M.T. Cohn S.M. Miller S.K. Luo R.Q. Berg C.L. Am. J. Physiol. Gastrointest. Liver Physiol. 2001; 280: G1172-G1177Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Fig. 1 shows the effects of various concentrations of two heme-binding proteins, BSA (albumin) and hemopexin, on the export of ZnMP from preloaded NRK/FLVCR or NRK/Neo cells. In the absence of BSA, no detectable export occurred. However, ZnMP export was nearly complete in the presence of 151.5 μm (1%) BSA, less extensive with 15.15 μm BSA, and almost nil with 1.515 μm BSA. Interestingly, residual cellular fluorescence in the presence of 1.515 μm hemopexin was similar to that with 151.5 μm BSA, so hemopexin appears to be 100-fold more efficacious than BSA in inducing ZnMP export. When quantitated with flow cytometry, 55.9 ± 3.6% and 45.9 ± 3.8% of ZnMP was retained intracellularly when the export studies were performed in the presence of 151.5 μm BSA and 1.515 μm hemopexin, respectively. NRK/Neo cells failed to export ZnMP (data not shown) in all circumstances; this is consistent with our prior data (1Quigley J.G. Yang Z. Worthington M.T. Phillips J.D. Sabo K.M. Sabath D.E. Berg C.L. Sassa S. Wood B.L. Abkowitz J.L. Cell. 2004; 118: 757-766Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar) and documents the requirement for FLVCR for heme export in these cells. In additional similar studies, the export of [55Fe]heme by human peripheral macrophages was quantified. As shown in Fig. 2, only 6% of the [55Fe]heme load was exported in the presence of 1.515 μm albumin, whereas 52% was exported in the presence of 1.515 μm hemopexin in the same time period. When the albumin concentration in the medium was increased by 100-fold to 151.5 μm, 67% of the [55Fe]heme was exported. These studies confirm that heme export is ∼100 times more efficient in the presence of hemopexin than albumin on a molar basis. An equally important observation of Fig. 2 is that export is completely dependent on the extracellular presence of a heme-binding protein. Heme uptake in NRK cells was not increased when the cells expressed FLVCR (100% in NRK/Neo cells versus 101.6 ± 6.2% in NRK/FLVCR cells; p = 0.6; n = 6). In additional studies, we used dominant-negative K44A dynamin (33Damke H. Baba T. Warnock D.E. Schmid S.L. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 127: 915-934Crossref PubMed Scopus (1040) Google Scholar) to block endocytosis-mediated heme uptake. Heme uptake decreased by 15–30%. yet the heme uptake by NRK/Neo/K44A dynamin and NRK/FLVCR/K44A dynamin cells remained comparable (74.8 ± 4.0% versus 72.9 ± 9.9% of NRK/Neo/dynamin uptake, respectively; p > 0.3; n = 3). To determine whether cells can export endogenously synthesized heme via FLVCR and not only heme supplied exogenously, we performed studies in NRK/FLVCR and NRK/Neo cells (Fig. 3). Using HPLC, 68.4 pmol of heme was detected in a 10-ml sample of the cell culture supernatant from 8 × 106 NRK/FLVCR cells in this representative study (n = 4). However, heme was not detectable in the cell culture supernatant from NRK/Neo cells. Conversely, heme contents were higher in the cell pellet from NRK/Neo cells (259.4 pmol/sample) than in that from NRK/FLVCR cells (104.8 pmol/sample). PPIX was not detected in the 10-ml sample of the cell culture supernatant from either NRK/Neo or NRK/FLVCR cells and was barely detected in the cell pellet at 1.0 and 0.5 pmol/sample from 8 × 106 NRK/Neo and NRK/FLVCR cells, respectively, implying that iron is not limiting and that heme is the primary substrate for FLVCR export under basal conditions. Similar studies were done to determine whether coproporphyrin and PPIX, which are both intermediate products in the heme biosynthetic pathway (34Ajioka R.S. Phillips J.D. Kushner J.P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2006; 1763: 723-736Crossref PubMed Scopus (363) Google Scholar), can be exported via FLVCR should their intracellular concentrations be sufficiently high. When cells were supplemented with ALA to bypass the rate-limiting step in heme biosynthesis, PPIX steadily accumulated in the cells, but more extensively in NRK/Neo cells than in NRK/FLVCR cells (nearly 50% more at 24 h) (Fig. 4A). To determine whether this lower net accumulation reflected lower synthesis or greater export of PPIX by the NRK/FLVCR cells, PPIX content in the medium was measured at the same time points. After 24 h, the total PPIX content (cells + medium) was similar for both cell types (217 versus 220 pmol), but of this, 53.9 ± 2.8% of total PPIX was present in the culture medium of NRK/FLVCR cells versus 35.4 ± 2.7% in the culture medium of NRK/Neo cells (Fig. 4B). Thus, the lower accumulation of PPIX in the NRK/FLVCR cells was due to enhanced export provided by FLVCR transgene expression in these cells. Quantification of coproporphyrin export yielded similar results. In cultures of both NRK cell lines, coproporphyrin was not detectable in either the culture medium or cell pellet under base-line conditions but was detected after ALA supplementation (n = 3; representative result) (Fig. 5). NRK/FLVCR cells accumulated less coproporphyrin in the cell pellet (Fig. 5A) and exported more into the culture supernatant (Fig. 5B) than NRK/Neo control cells. After 24 h, the total coproporphyrin contents of the two cell lines were similar, but more was exported by cells expressing FLVCR (89.4% compared with 55.4% by NRK/Neo cells). These data suggest that FLVCR can export PPIX and coproporphyrin but predict that other transporters, presumably ABCG2 (35Jonker J.W. Buitelaar M. Wagenaar E. Van Der Valk M.A. Scheffer G.L. Scheper R.J. Plosch T. Kuipers F. Elferink R.P. Rosing H. Beijnen J.H. Schinkel A.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2002; 99: 15649-15654Crossref PubMed Scopus (714) Google Scholar), can do so also. The extracellular presence of hemopexin, which binds these porphyrins with relatively low affinity (Kd ∼ 1 μm) (36Seery V.L. Muller-Eberhard U. J. Biol. Chem. 1973; 248: 3796-3800Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 37Morgan W.T. Smith A. Koskelo P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1980; 624: 271-285Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar), did not improve the export efficiency compared with albumin (data not shown), which binds these porphyrins with similarly low affinity (Kd ∼ 1 μm) (37Morgan W.T. Smith A. Koskelo P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1980; 624: 271-285Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Heme metabolism by heme oxygenase-1 leads to the production of biliverdin, free ferrous iron, and carbon monoxide. Biliverdin is further reduced into UCB (reviewed in Ref. 16Ryter S.W. Tyrrell R.M. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2000; 28: 289-309Crossref PubMed Scopus (663) Google Scholar). In most neonates, immaturity of the conjugation and biliary secretion of bilirubin leads to retention of UCB, which, if severe, results in neurotoxicity from accumulation of UCB in the central nervous system (38Vítek L. Ostrow J.D. Curr. Pharm. Des. 2009; 15: 2869-2883Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). The impaired hepatic elimination is partially compensated by enhanced excretion of UCB across the intestinal wall (38Vítek L. Ostrow J.D. Curr. Pharm. Des. 2009; 15: 2869-2883Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar), which might theoretically be mediated by FLVCR, prompting these studies. As shown in Fig. 6, both NRK/Neo and NRK/FLVCR cells exhibited similar rates of uptake and rapidly exported UCB, implying that export occurs via a mechanism distinct from FLVCR (39Rigato I. Pascolo L. Fernetti C. Ostrow J.D. Tiribelli C. Biochem. J. 2004; 383: 335-341Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Because UCB is toxic to cells that lack the ability to export it (22Calligaris S. Cekic D. Roca-Burgos L. Gerin F. Mazzone G. Ostrow J.D. Tiribelli C. FEBS Lett. 2006; 580: 1355-1359Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar), we used an indirect approach as a secondary method to determine whether FLVCR is capable of exporting bilirubin from cells. We compared the toxicity of UCB in FLVCR-containing versus FLVCR-null MEFs. As assessed by MTT activity (a test of mitochondrial function), there was no significant difference in sensitivity to UCB toxicity between MEFs that contain or lack FLVCR (Fig. 6C). Together, these data indicate that FLVC"
https://openalex.org/W2008658436,"Despite support for receptor of activated NF-κB ligand (RANKL) as a mediator of mammary progesterone action, the extent to which this cytokine can functionally contribute to established progesterone-induced mammary morphogenetic responses in the absence of other presumptive effectors is still unclear. To address this uncertainty, we developed an innovative bigenic system for the doxycycline-inducible expression of RANKL in the mammary epithelium of the progesterone receptor knockout (PRKO) mouse. In response to acute doxycycline exposure, RANKL is specifically expressed in the estrogen receptor α (ER) positive/progesterone receptor negative (ER(+)/PR(-)) cell type in the PRKO mammary epithelium, a cell type that is equivalent to the ER(+)/PR(+) cell type in the wild-type (WT) mammary epithelium. Notably, the ER(+)/PR(+) mammary cell normally expresses RANKL in the WT mammary epithelium during pregnancy. In this PRKO bigenic system, acute doxycycline-induced expression of RANKL results in ordered mammary ductal side branching and alveologenesis, morphological changes that normally occur in the parous WT mouse. This mammary epithelial expansion is accompanied by significant RANKL-induced luminal epithelial proliferation, which is driven, in part, by indirect induction of cyclin D1. Collectively, our findings support the conclusion that RANKL represents a critical mediator of mammary PR action and that restricted expression of this effector to the ER(+)/PR(+) mammary cell-type is necessary for a spatially ordered morphogenetic response to progesterone."

https://openalex.org/W2085732250,"The CARMA1, Bcl10, and MALT1 proteins together constitute a signaling complex (CBM signalosome) that mediates antigen-dependent activation of NF-kappaB in lymphocytes, thereby representing a cornerstone of the adaptive immune response. Although CARMA1 is restricted to cells of the immune system, the analogous CARMA3 protein has a much wider expression pattern. Emerging evidence suggests that CARMA3 can substitute for CARMA1 in non-immune cells to assemble a CARMA3-Bcl10-MALT1 signalosome and mediate G protein-coupled receptor activation of NF-kappaB. Here we show that one G protein-coupled receptor, the type 1 receptor for angiotensin II, utilizes this mechanism for activation of NF-kappaB in endothelial and vascular smooth muscle cells, thereby inducing pro-inflammatory signals within the vasculature, a key factor in atherogenesis. Further, we demonstrate that Bcl10-deficient mice are protected from developing angiotensin-dependent atherosclerosis and aortic aneurysms. By uncovering a novel vascular role for the CBM signalosome, these findings illustrate that CBM-dependent signaling has functions outside the realm of adaptive immunity and impacts pathobiology more broadly than previously known."
https://openalex.org/W2001880171,"RPS3, a conserved, eukaryotic ribosomal protein of the 40 S subunit, is required for ribosome biogenesis. Because ribosomal proteins are abundant and ubiquitous, they may have additional extraribosomal functions. Here, we show that human RPS3 is a physiological target of Akt kinase and a novel mediator of neuronal apoptosis. NGF stimulation resulted in phosphorylation of threonine 70 of RPS3 by Akt, and this phosphorylation was required for Akt binding to RPS3. RPS3 induced neuronal apoptosis, up-regulating proapoptotic proteins Dp5/Hrk and Bim by binding to E2F1 and acting synergistically with it. Akt-dependent phosphorylation of RPS3 inhibited its proapoptotic function and perturbed its interaction with E2F1. These events coincided with nuclear translocation and accumulation of RPS3, where it functions as an endonuclease. Nuclear accumulation of RPS3 results in an increase in DNA repair activity to some extent, thereby sustaining neuronal survival. Abolishment of Akt-mediated RPS3 phosphorylation through mutagenesis accelerated apoptotic cell death and severely compromised nuclear translocation of RPS3. Thus, our findings define an extraribosomal role of RPS3 as a molecular switch that accommodates apoptotic induction to DNA repair through Akt-mediated phosphorylation. RPS3, a conserved, eukaryotic ribosomal protein of the 40 S subunit, is required for ribosome biogenesis. Because ribosomal proteins are abundant and ubiquitous, they may have additional extraribosomal functions. Here, we show that human RPS3 is a physiological target of Akt kinase and a novel mediator of neuronal apoptosis. NGF stimulation resulted in phosphorylation of threonine 70 of RPS3 by Akt, and this phosphorylation was required for Akt binding to RPS3. RPS3 induced neuronal apoptosis, up-regulating proapoptotic proteins Dp5/Hrk and Bim by binding to E2F1 and acting synergistically with it. Akt-dependent phosphorylation of RPS3 inhibited its proapoptotic function and perturbed its interaction with E2F1. These events coincided with nuclear translocation and accumulation of RPS3, where it functions as an endonuclease. Nuclear accumulation of RPS3 results in an increase in DNA repair activity to some extent, thereby sustaining neuronal survival. Abolishment of Akt-mediated RPS3 phosphorylation through mutagenesis accelerated apoptotic cell death and severely compromised nuclear translocation of RPS3. Thus, our findings define an extraribosomal role of RPS3 as a molecular switch that accommodates apoptotic induction to DNA repair through Akt-mediated phosphorylation. Nerve growth factor (NGF) deprivation and DNA damage can activate the intrinsic apoptotic pathway, causing cytochrome c release and caspase-dependent cell death in many cell types, including sympathetic neurons (1Deshmukh M.

NGF regulates neuronal apoptosis through a variety of cellular signaling mechanisms, especially the phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt pathway (6Brunet A. Datta S.R. Greenberg M.E. Curr. Opin. Neurobiol... 2001; 11: 297-305Google Scholar). Akt signaling promotes cell survival by phosphorylating and controlling downstream effectors in both the cytoplasm and the nucleus. For instance, Akt phosphorylates the proapoptotic Bcl-2 family member BAD (7Datta S.R. Dudek H. Tao X. Masters S. Fu H. Gotoh Y. Greenberg M.E. Cell.. 1997; 91: 231-241Google Scholar) that belongs to the cytoplasmic apoptotic apparatus. In addition, Akt inhibits chromatin condensation during apoptosis by phosphorylating ACINUS, a nuclear factor required for apoptotic chromatin condensation (8Hu Y. Yao J. Liu Z. Liu X. Fu H. Ye K. EMBO J... 2005; 24: 3543-3554Google Scholar). PI3K and Akt are predominantly located in the cytoplasm, but they are also found in the nucleus or translocate there upon stimulation by growth factors (9Ahmed N.N. Franke T.F. Bellacosa A. Datta K.

Maco B. Petfalski E. Tollervey D. Böttcher B. Aebi U. Hurt E. Nature.. 2006; 441: 651-655Google Scholar). A growing body of evidence suggests that ribosomal proteins are capable of extraribosomal functions. For example, RPS3, also known as UV endonuclease III, appears to possess a general base damage endonuclease that participates in the cleavage of DNA lesions caused by UV irradiation. In addition, both RPS3 and ribosomal protein P0 have an apurinic/apyrimidinic (AP) endonuclease activity functioning in DNA repair at the 3′ side of AP sites after DNA damage (14Grabowski D.T. Deutsch W.A. Derda D. Kelley M.R. Nucleic Acids Res... 1991; 19: 4297Google Scholar, 15Kim J. Chubatsu L.S. Admon A. Stahl J. Fellous R. Linn S. J. Biol.

In addition, ribosomal proteins may have apoptotic functions as follows: RPS3-a is involved in the apoptotic process in NIH3T3 cells (17Naora H. Takai I. Adachi M. Naora H. J. Cell Biol... 1998; 141: 741-753Google Scholar), and knockdown of rpS3 leads to significant cell survival after hydrogen peroxide treatment (18Hegde V. Yadavilli S. Deutsch W.A. DNA Repair.. 2007; 6: 94-99Google Scholar). The exact physiological roles of RPS3 remain unclear at present. Here, we show that Akt bound directly to RPS3 and phosphorylated it on residue threonine 70 (Thr-70). Notably, overexpression of RPS3 induced neuronal apoptosis by cooperating with E2F1 and causing up-regulation of proapoptotic BH3-only proteins, Bim and death protein 5/harakiri (Dp5/Hrk). Akt-dependent phosphorylation of RPS3 Thr-70 inhibited proapoptotic protein induction and led to nuclear accumulation of RPS3, thereby promoting cell survival through enhancing its endonuclease activity. These findings pointed to RPS3 as a key substrate for Akt and demonstrated a novel mechanism by which neuronal cells coordinate DNA repair and apoptosis. PC12 cells were maintained in medium A (Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% fetal bovine serum, 5% horse serum, and 100 units of penicillin/streptomycin) at 37 °C under a 5% CO2 atmosphere. Myc-RPS3 stably transfected PC12 cells (Tet-Off cell line) were cultured in medium B (100 μg/ml hygromycin B, 100 μg/ml G418, 2 μg/ml tetracycline in medium A). The transfected genes were induced by culturing in medium C (medium B from which the 2 μg/ml tetracycline has been removed) for 24 h. For primary culture, the hippocampi were dissected from brains of postnatal day 0 Sprague-Dawley rats and digested with 0.25% trypsin. The cells were cultured in neurobasal medium supplemented with B27, 1 mm l-glutamine, and penicillin/streptomycin. Prior to growth factor exposure (100 ng/ml of NGF or BDNF), cells were maintained for 4–6 h under serum starvation conditions. Anti-p-Akt, anti-Akt, anti-Bcl2, anti-Bax, anti-Bad, anti-cytochrome c, anti-PARP, anti-Lamin A, anti-caspase-9, anti-GST, anti-HA, anti-p-ERK1/2, and wortmannin were obtained from Cell Signaling (Danvers, MA). Anti-caspase-3 and active Akt proteins were obtained from Upstate (Temecula, CA). Anti-tubulin, anti-Myc, anti-GFP, and PD184352 were acquired from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). Alexa Fluor 488 goat anti-mouse secondary antibody was obtained from Molecular Probes (Eugene, OR). PD98059 and LY294002 were obtained from Promega (Madison, WI). Polyclonal anti-RPS3 and anti-phospho-RPS3 Thr-70-specific antibodies were generated by injecting purified His-tagged RPS3 or synthesized Thr-70-phosphorylated peptide (CLGEKGRRIRELpTAV) into rabbits. Antibodies were affinity-purified from serum using unphosphorylated peptide cross-linked to Affi-Gel 15, according to the manufacturer's recommendations (Bio-Rad). RpS3 was cloned into pcDNA3.1(−) Myc-His, pEGFP-C2, pECFP-N1, pET15b, and pGEX4T1. PCR-based mutagenesis was performed by QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) according to the manufacturer's instruction and using the following primers: T70A forward, 5′-CGGATTCGGGAACTGGCAGCTGTAGTTCAGAAG-3′, and reverse, 5′-CTTCTGAACTACAGCTGCCAGTTCCCGAATCCG-3′) and T70D forward, 5′-CGGATTCGGGAACTGGACGCTGTAGTTCAGAAG-3′, and reverse, 5′-CTTCTGAACTACAGCGTCCAGTTCCCGAATCCG-3′). siRNA for RPS3 (duplex oligonucleotide, 5′-CGCUACAAACUCUUAGGAGGGCUTG-3′, and 3′-AUGCGAUGUUUGAGAAUCCUCCCGAAC-5′) was obtained from Integrated DNA Technologies, Inc. (Coralville, IA). siRNA for E2F1 (5′-AUGAGACCUCACUAAAU-3′ and 5′-AUUUAGUGAGGUCUCAU-3′) was obtained from Genolution (Republic of Korea). Bim and Dp5/Hrk promoter sequences were PCR-amplified from rat genomic DNA and cloned into pGL4.12 vector using the following primers: Bim (forward, 5′-CAAGGTACCGCGGCCTGGGGGCCGTGG-3′, and reverse, 5′-CAAGATATCGGGCAGCGGTCCCCTTCGCC-3′) and Dp5/Hrk (forward, 5′-CCAGGTACCCCATCTAGCTAGCTAGCATCTATTA-3′, and reverse, 5′-AAAGATATCAGCGTCGCCGCAACCGCACAC-3′). All other chemicals were obtained from Sigma. 1 μg of purified protein was incubated with recombinant active Akt (Upstate) and 10 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) in 50 μl of kinase buffer (25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 5 mm β-glycerophosphate, 2 mm dithiothreitol (DTT), 0.1 mm Na3VO4, 10 mm MgCl2, and 0.2 mm ATP). Reactions were incubated at 30 °C for 30 min. Reactions were terminated by addition of Laemmli SDS sample buffer and boiling on 95 °C for 5 min. Proteins were separated on NuPAGE 4–12% gradient gels (Invitrogen), and phosphorylation of proteins was visualized by autoradiography. Oligonucleosomal fragmentation of genomic DNA was determined as described below. Briefly, 3 × 106 cells transfected with rpS3 or mock vector were serum-starved for 4 h and NGF-stimulated (100 ng/ml, 45 min). After incubation, the cells were lysed on ice for 60 min in 500 μl of lysis buffer (0.02% SDS, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.2 mg/ml proteinase K in PBS). Genomic DNA was extracted by the phenol/chloroform purification method. The pellet was dissolved in 50 μl of TE buffer (10 mg/ml RNase) for 1 h at 37 °C. 10 μg of genomic DNA was loaded on a 2% agarose gel and visualized under UV light. The experimental procedures for co-immunoprecipitation, in vitro binding, and Akt kinase assays have been described previously (18Hegde V. Yadavilli S. Deutsch W.A. DNA Repair.. 2007; 6: 94-99Google Scholar, 19Ahn J.Y. Liu X. Liu Z. Pereira L. Cheng D. Peng J. Wade P.A. Hamburger A.W. Ye K. EMBO J... 2006; 25: 2083-2095Google Scholar). The experimental procedures for GST pulldown assays were as follows. Cells were rinsed with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and lysed in buffer (50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 0.5% Triton X-100, 1.5 mm Na3VO4, 50 mm sodium fluoride, 10 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 10 mm β-glycerophosphate, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (PMSF)) and protease mixture (Calbiochem). Cell lysates (0.5–1 mg of protein) were mixed with glutathione-Sepharose beads and incubated 3 h at 4 °C with gentle rotation. The beads were then washed in lysis buffer, mixed with 2× SDS sample buffer, boiled, and analyzed by immunoblotting. Cells grown on coverslips in 24-well plates were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 15 min, permeabilized in PBS containing 0.25% Triton X-100 for 10 min, and blocked in 2% BSA for 30 min. Cells were immunostained using antibodies against RPS3, phospho-RPS3 Thr-70, and Akt and secondary antibodies Alexa Fluor 488 goat anti-rabbit and Alexa Fluor 594 goat anti-mouse. Nuclei were counterstained with 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) or Hoechst dye. Cells were visualized under a fluorescent microscope (Zeiss) or a Zeiss LSM confocal fluorescence microscope (Jena, German). Myc-RPS3-WT or mock vector were co-transfected with or without RPS3 siRNA, and transfected cells were plated onto 96-well plates (3.5 × 103 cells/well). After 48 h, caspase activity was monitored by the Caspase-Glo 3/7 assay system and the Caspase-Glo 9 assay system (Promega) according to the manufacturer's protocols. Cells (1 × 106 to 5 × 106 cells) were washed once with ice-cold PBS and once with lysis buffer (10 mm Hepes, pH 7.9, 10 mm KCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm PMSF, protease inhibitor mixture). Cells were lysed in 200 μl of lysis buffer containing 0.1% Nonidet P-40 for 10 min on ice. The lysates were centrifuged for 2 min at 5,000 × g at 4 °C, and the nuclear pellet was washed with lysis buffer without Nonidet P-40. Nuclei were resuspended in 40 μl of nuclear protein extraction buffer (10 mm Hepes, pH 7.9, 420 mm NaCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 0.2 mm EDTA) for 10 min at 4 °C. The nuclear fraction was cleared by centrifuging at 14,000 rpm at 4 °C for 10 min. Protein concentration was measured by Bradford assay. The total RNA of Akt-inducible stable cells transfected with Myc-rpS3 was isolated with TRIzol Reagent (Invitrogen) and treated with DNase I (Ambion, Inc., Austin, TX) to remove the DNA contamination. cDNA was constructed by using Transcriptor High Fidelity cDNA synthesis kit (Roche Applied Science). PCR was performed using the following primers: Bim (forward, 5′-TGTGCGGTTGCGGCGACG-3′, and reverse, 5′-TGCCGAGCAGCCAGGCCG-3′) and Dp5/Hrk (forward, 5′-AGCTGAAGACCTCCACGTCTGAG-3′, and reverse, 5′-AATGGTGACCCGGCAGATCTGT-3′). PC12 cells were transfected with 200 ng of luciferase construct, 50 ng of β-galactosidase plasmid, various concentrations of expression vectors for E2F1, and RPS3 constructs using TransIT-LT1 (Mirus, Madison WI), according to the manufacturer's instructions. Cells were harvested 24 h after transfection and processed with the Promega luciferase assay system. Data were normalized to β-galactosidase activity. To find a target of active Akt, we carried out immunoprecipitation assays with cellular extracts from PC12 cells constitutively expressing active Akt or mock vector as a control. Immunoprecipitated proteins were eluted and resolved by SDS-PAGE. Prominent protein bands were subjected to proteomic analysis, and RPS3 was identified as a putative binding partner of Akt. Analysis of the amino acid sequence of RPS3 revealed a single Akt consensus sequence phosphorylation site surrounding threonine residue 70 (RIRELT) in the amino terminus (Fig. 1A). We prepared a variety of recombinant GST-tagged fragments of RPS3 that included the putative phosphorylation domain, and we examined them as Akt phosphorylation targets. In vitro kinase assays in the presence of [γ-32P]ATP revealed that only full-length RPS3 and a fragment containing amino acid residues 50–243 were significantly phosphorylated by Akt as compared with a known positive control substrate, glycogen synthesis kinase (GSK3) fusion protein (Fig. 1B). To identify the specific RPS3 residue that is phosphorylated by Akt, we prepared several mutants His-tagged RPS3 constructs, with Thr-70 changed to alanine, aspartate, glutamate, and arginine. We also produced rabbit polyclonal antibody specific for RPS3 phosphorylated on Thr-70. All the mutations abolished RPS3 phosphorylation, whereas purified WT-RPS3 proteins tagged with histidine (His-RPS3) (supplemental Fig. S1A) were highly phosphorylated in the presence of [γ-32P] ATP (Fig. 1C). This result strongly suggested that Thr-70 was a specific Akt phosphorylation site within RPS3. Moreover, NGF treatment triggered high levels of immunoreactivity against phospho-Akt-substrate antibody with both the wild type and the T70D mutant RPS3 proteins fused to Myc (Myc-RPS3) but no detectable phosphorylation of the T70A Myc-RPS3 mutant. Akt was activated by NGF stimulation in all cases (Fig. 1D), suggesting that the Thr-70 residue is phosphorylated in vivo by Akt. To investigate whether Akt can specifically phosphorylate RPS3 in intact PC12 cells, we cultured cells with or without NGF and analyzed endogenous RPS3 using specific anti-RPS3 and anti-phospho-RPS3 Thr-70 antibodies. NGF treatment elicited robust and specific phosphorylation of Thr-70 in intact cells (Fig. 1E, top panel). In addition, an antibody against phosphorylated Akt substrate specifically interacts precipitated RPS3 protein (Fig. 1E, 3rd panel). To further explore NGF-mediated Akt phosphorylation of RPS3, PC12 cells were treated with either a PI3K inhibitor (LY294002) or a MEK1 inhibitor (PD184352), followed by NGF stimulation. Endogenous RPS3 was highly phosphorylated upon NGF stimulation. Phosphorylation was strongly inhibited by the PI3K inhibitor but not by the MEK1 inhibitor, suggesting that the PI3K/Akt pathway, and not the MAPK pathway, is responsible for Thr-70 phosphorylation of RPS3 (Fig. 1F). A quantification analysis was provided in supplemental Fig S1B. Taken together, our data support the conclusion that RPS3 is a physiological substrate of Akt in mammalian cells. In vitro mapping experiments using a variety of purified GST-RPS3 proteins (Fig. 1B) and lysates prepared from cells expressing hemagglutinin-tagged Akt (HA-Akt) demonstrated that, besides RPS3-WT, the only fragment that interacted robustly with Akt was RPS3 residues 50–243 (Fig. 2A). This result was in agreement with our in vitro phosphorylation findings (Fig. 1B) and suggested that RPS3 phosphorylation was critical for Akt binding and/or for the maintenance of RPS3 conformation. To test whether Thr-70 phosphorylation caused RPS3 to bind to Akt, we introduced a constitutively active, phosphorylation-mimetic mutant HA-Akt (T308DS473D) into PC12 cells that were expressing either RPS3-WT or RPS3-T70A. Active Akt clearly associated with RPS3-WT and not with the T70A mutant, suggesting that Akt facilitated its association with RPS3-WT by phosphorylating it (Fig. 2B, top). We noted that the Thr-70 phosphorylation status of precipitated RPS3 was highly correlated with Akt binding (Fig. 2B, bottom). NGF treatment of PC12 cells led to a substantial increase in binding of endogenous RPS3 to Akt, further suggesting that Akt phosphorylation of RPS3 promoted its interaction with RPS3 (Fig. 2C). To determine the function of RPS3 Thr-70 phosphorylation, we established PC12 cell lines stably transfected with tetracycline-inducible Myc-RPS3-WT, T70A or T70D constructs (supplemental Fig. S2A). In the absence of NGF stimulation, endogenous Akt associated with the RPS3-T70D mutant but showed negligible binding to RPS3-WT or to the T70A mutant (Fig. 2D, top left). In contrast, NGF treatment resulted in a robust interaction between RPS3-WT and Akt, and the binding affinity of this interaction appeared similar to that of Akt to the T70D mutant (Fig. 2D, top right). Interestingly, Akt binding levels in the T70A mutant cell line were independent of NGF stimulation. We concluded that NGF stimulated the RPS3-Akt interaction, presumably by activating Akt, which subsequently leads to the phosphorylation of RPS3 Thr-70 (Fig. 2D, left and right, 2nd panel). In addition, NGF-induced Akt-RPS3 complex formation was disrupted by the PI3K inhibitor (LY294002) but was not affected by the MEK inhibitor (PD98059), again arguing that Akt activation was required for the Akt-RPS3 interaction (supplemental Fig. S2B). Mapping experiments demonstrated that RPS3 bound full-length Akt or fragments containing the catalytic domain but bound only very weakly to fragments containing either the regulatory domain or the pleckstrin homology domain (Fig. 2E). The critical role of the catalytic domain of Akt in RPS3 binding supported the idea that Akt kinase activity is crucial for its interaction with RPS3. During the preparation of both stably and transiently transfected cell lines, we noticed that apoptotic cell death was occurring in RPS3-overexpressing cell lines, especially in the cells expressing T70A mutant RPS3. These observations raised the question of whether RPS3 played a role in neuronal apoptosis. We found that overexpression of GFP-RPS3 caused pronounced DNA fragmentation that was compromised by NGF treatment, indicating that overexpression of RPS3 could indeed lead to neuronal cell death (Fig. 3A). Cleavage of caspase-3 and its well known downstream target proteins, PARP and Lamin A/C, were coupled to the DNA fragmentation activity. Akt was also activated upon NGF treatment, implying that RPS3 may possess a proapoptotic function and that this activity could be compromised by NGF-mediated Akt activation (Fig. 3B). Compared with cells expressing control vector, more than 50% of the nuclei in GFP-RPS3-expressing PC12 cells displayed condensed chromatin, and NGF treatment decreased chromatin condensation by less than 20% (Fig. 3C). Primary hippocampus neurons, but not control cells, exhibited more than 40% of chromatin condensation in the presence of overexpressed RPS3 (Fig. 3D). We concluded that RPS3 was crucial for induction of neuronal cell death. To examine whether RPS3 expression levels affected apoptosis, we depleted RPS3 by short interfering (si) RNA. Depletion of endogenous RPS3 resulted in modest apoptosis (15%) as compared with scrambled RNA-transfected cells, suggesting that abrogation of RPS3 expression could also trigger apoptosis and was marginally compromised by NGF (Fig. 3E), whereas overexpression of RPS3 resulted in higher levels of cell death (more than 50%). Stepwise removal of RPS3 from GFP-RPS3-overexpressing cells clearly reduced apoptosis, and NGF exposure substantially enhanced neuronal cell survival (Fig. 3E). As reported previously (20Mamane Y. Petroulakis E. Martineau Y. Sato T.A. Larsson O. Rajasekhar V.K. Sonenberg N. PloS One.. 2007; 2: e242Google Scholar), cell death resulting from the elimination of RPS3 may be due to a perturbation of protein translation. Hence, these findings strongly supported the idea that enrichment of RPS3 protein was a potent trigger of apoptotic cell death, which in turn could be repressed by NGF. On the other hand, knockdown of RPS3 led to a decrease of the resistance to neuronal apoptosis that was induced by etoposide (Fig. 3F, left), indicating that RPS3 is critical for neuronal cell survival. However, compared with overexpression of RPS3, knockdown of RPS3 resulted in a substantial decrease in the levels of proapoptotic proteins, such as Bim and DP5, as well as cleavage of caspase-3 (Fig. 3F, right), supporting our finding that high levels of RPS3 expression resulted in substantial apoptosis, although depletion of RPS3 might also result in apoptosis. Collectively, our data may explain the impression that dual function of RPS3 as an individual ribosomal protein and as an apoptotic inducer of neuronal cells. Overexpression of RPS3 not only stimulated DNA fragmentation but also increased the degradation of PARP and Lamin A/C (Fig. 3, A and B), and these effects were abolished by the removal of overexpressed RPS3 (Fig. 3E). These findings implicated RPS3 in multiple levels of apoptotic induction, including activation of upstream apoptotic machinery like caspase-3. To assess this possibility, we monitored the effect of RPS3 depletion on activation of the caspase cascade. Silencing of endogenous rpS3 slightly increased either caspase-9 or caspase-3 activity as compared with the control and regardless of NGF stimulation. Notably, cells expressing Myc-RPS3 displayed an ∼2-fold higher level of activated caspase-9 and a 4-fold higher level of activated caspase-3 compared with control cells in the absence of NGF, and NGF treatment decreased RPS3-mediated caspase-9 and caspase-3 activities to basal levels (Fig. 4, A and B). Correspondingly, ablation of RPS3 in RPS3-overexpressing cells caused a reversion of caspase-9 and -3 activities, indicating that RPS3 may act upstream of caspase-3, most likely in the mitochondrial apoptotic pathway. Because neurons undergoing apoptosis mediated by the apoptosome pathway require the release of cytochrome c and execution of the caspase cascades, we tested whether apoptotic death was triggered by RPS3-induced apoptosome activation. Overexpression of RPS3 resulted in not only activation of caspase-3 (Fig. 4C, 1st and 2nd panels from the top) but also cytochrome c release and caspase-9 activation in the absence of NGF, indicating engagement of the apoptosome pathway (Fig. 4C, 3rd panel). Importantly, Bim and Dp5/Hrk but not Bcl-2 or Bax levels were up-regulated in RPS3-expressing cells (Fig. 4C, 4th to 7th panels). NGF exposure dramatically diminished both Bim and Dp5 protein levels (Fig. 4C, 6th and 7th panels from the top). By using luciferase reporter plasmids containing Bim or Dp5 promoters (pGL4/Bim or pGL4/Dp5), we demonstrated that transcription levels from both these promoters increased up to 3-fold relative to the control vector (pGL) with increasing Myc-RPS3 (Fig. 4D). The protein expression was provided in supplemental Fig. S3A. RPS3 may therefore regulate not only protein but also transcription levels of Bim and Dp5. Although the precise mechanism whereby Bim and Dp5 mediate neuronal apoptosis is uncertain, both Bim and Dp5 are up-regulated after NGF withdrawal in sympathetic neurons (21Imaizumi K. Tsuda M. Imai Y. Wanaka A. Takagi T. Tohyama M. J. Biol. Chem... 1997; 272: 18842-18848Google Scholar, 22Putcha G.V. Moulder K.L. Golden J.P. Bouillet P. Adams J.A. Strasser A. Johnson E.M. Neuron.. 2001; 29: 615-628Google Scholar, 23Whitfield J. Neame S.J. Paquet L. Bernard O. Ham J. Neuron.. 2001; 29: 629-643Google Scholar). A recent study suggested that E2F1 binds to the promoters of both Bim and Dp5, enhancing their expression (24Hershko T. Ginsberg D. J. Biol. Chem... 2004; 279: 8627-8634Google Scholar). To understand the molecular basis of RPS3-mediated up-regulation of proapoptotic proteins, we tested whether overexpression of RPS3 affected E2F1. RPS3-WT interacted with endogenous E2F1 in the absence of NGF, but no binding was observed in the presence of NGF (Fig. 4E and supplemental Fig. S3B). Moreover, co-transfection of RPS3 and E2F1 significantly increased transcription of both Bim and Dp5 compared with expression levels using E2F1 or RPS3 on their own (Fig. 4F). Thus, our data suggested that RPS3 acted synergistically with E2F1 to produce an increase in BH3-only protein levels in the absence of NGF and dissociated from E2F1 in response to NGF stimulation. To assess the function of the RPS3-E2F1 interaction in neuronal apoptosis, we used siRNA to reduce the expression of E2F1 in PC12 cells that had been induced to undergo apoptosis by overexpression of RPS3. As expected, overexpression of RPS3 and control scrambled short RNAs still induced apoptosis, leading to cleavage of both caspase-3 and PARP (Fig. 4G, 2nd lanes). However, depletion of E2F1 significantly inhibited RPS3-induced neuronal cell death (Fig. 4G, 3rd lanes). We used DAPI staining to quantitate the ratio of apoptotic to nonapoptotic cells (supplemental Fig. S3C). Together, these results showed that binding of E2F1 to RPS3 contributed to RPS3-induced apoptosis in neuronal cells. Because we failed to detect any changes in either JNK or c-Jun activation (data not shown), our results suggested that RPS3 may function proapoptotically by interacting with E2F1 and up-regulating BH3-only protein levels, whereas NGF-driven Akt signaling antagonized this effect, independent of JNK signaling. Because Thr-70 phosphorylation of RPS3 by Akt appeared to regulate its binding to E2F1 as well as the induction of proapoptotic proteins, we next asked whether Akt phosphorylation influenced RPS3-mediated apoptosis in neuronal cells. Consistent with the observation shown in Fig. 3A, DNA fragmentation was higher in cells expressing RPS3 compared with control PC12 cells, whereas NGF exposure decreased RPS3-mediated DNA fragmentation. Importantly, RPS3 T70D phosphorylation-mimetic mutant cells exhibited reduced DNA fragmentation, regardless of NGF treatment. In contrast, the RPS3 T70A cells showed significant DNA fragmentation even in the presence of NGF, demonstrating that phosphorylation of RPS3 by Akt is required to prevent RPS3-mediated apoptosis (Fig. 5A, left). A quantitative analysis of apoptosis by DAPI staining correlated well with DNA fragmentation activity (Fig. 5A, right). More than 60% of the cells underwent apoptosis in both RPS3 WT and RPS3 T70A mutant cell lines. NGF stimulation reduced this number to 38% in WT cells, and than 50% of the RPS3 T70A mutant-transfected cells showed chromatin condensation, again supporting the conclusion that Akt phosphorylation is critical for suppressing RPS3-induced apoptosis. We observed similar results in PC12 cells that were transiently transfected with GFP-RPS3-WT or with T70A or T70D mutants (data not shown). The same results were obtained by FACS analysis with annexin V staining (Fig. 5B). We then expanded our study to pri"

IntroductionThe free-living soil nematode Caenorhabditis elegans develops through four larval stages to the adult stage in ∼3 days under favorable conditions; however, when C. elegans encounters unfavorable environmental conditions such as increased temperature (e.g. 25 °C) or high population density, dauer pheromones or daumones signal the L2 larvae to enter the nonaging dauer stage (1Golden J.W. Riddle D.L. Dev. Biol. 1984; 102: 368-378Crossref PubMed Scopus (412) Google Scholar, 2Golden J.W. Riddle D.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Because the structure of daumone 1 was reported (4Jeong P.Y. Jung M. Yim Y.H. Kim H. Park M. Hong E. Lee W. Kim Y.H Kim K. Paik Y.K. Nature. 2005; 433: 541-545Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar), at least nine naturally occurring daumone analogs with presumably diverse molecular functions have been discovered (5Butcher R.A.

Therefore, these daumones appear to be important signaling molecules for aging, development, and reproduction in C. elegans (4Jeong P.Y. Jung M. Yim Y.H. Kim H. Park M. Hong E. Lee W. Kim Y.H Kim K. Paik Y.K. Nature. 2005; 433: 541-545Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar, 7Srinivasan J. Kaplan F. Ajredini R. Zachariah C. Alborn H.T. Teal P. Malik R.U. Edison A.S. Sternberg P.W.

The three most abundant daumones (daumones 1, 2, and 3) (4Jeong P.Y. Jung M. Yim Y.H. Kim H. Park M. Hong E. Lee W. Kim Y.H Kim K. Paik Y.K. Nature. 2005; 433: 541-545Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar, 5Butcher R.A. Fujita M. Schroeder F.C. Clardy J. Nat. Chem. Biol. 2007; 3: 420-422Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar) may be produced under different physiological conditions or in response to different stress signals (e.g. higher temperature or different nutritional conditions). Despite the critical roles of these daumones in C. elegans, the molecular regulatory system that controls the biosynthesis of these diverse molecules is unknown.These daumones are composed of dideoxyhexose ascarylose and various short chain fatty acid moieties. The methyl-branched fatty acid moieties of the three most abundant daumones are likely biosynthesized during peroxisomal β-oxidation, which, in C. elegans, consists of four consecutive reactions catalyzed by three peroxisomal enzymes: acyl-CoA oxidase (ACOX), 2The abbreviations used are: ACOXacyl-CoA oxidaseLCliquid chromatographyMS/MStandem mass spectrometry. DHS-28, and DAF-22 (11Joo H.J. Yim Y.H. Jeong P.Y. Jin Y.X. Lee J.E. Kim H. Jeong S.K. Chitwood D.J. Paik Y.K. Biochem. J. 2009; 422: 61-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 12Butcher R.A.

However, among these enzymes, ACOX has not been identified and characterized in C. elegans. In mammals, various fatty acid substrates for peroxisomal β-oxidation are utilized by two or three different ACOX enzymes with different specificities (13Poirier Y. Antonenkov V.D. Glumoff T. Hiltunen J.K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2006; 1763: 1413-1426Crossref PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar, 14Wanders R.J. Mol. Genet. Metabol. 2004; 83: 16-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). We addressed one important question as to the possible role of acox with respect to the balance of the concentration of different daumones synthesized in response to sudden environmental shifts. Here we report that C. elegans acox-1 likely contributes to the cellular distribution of daumones and influences dauer entry in response to temperature increases in C. elegans.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESStrains and General ProceduresC. elegans strains were maintained on nematode growth medium agar plates at 20 °C. The N2 Bristol strain was used for all experiments unless otherwise noted. The acox-1(ok2257) and daf-22(ok693) mutant strains were obtained from the Caenorhabditis Genetics Center (Minneapolis, MN). We outcrossed each mutant with N2 worms four times to remove any possible unrelated genes before the strains were used in our experiments.Construction and Expression of ACOX-1::GFPFor construction of acox-1p::GFP::acox-1, the 1.37-kb upstream promoter of acox-1 was ligated into the BamHI/NotI restriction site upstream of the GFP-coding region in the pPD114.108 GFP vector. The entire coding region of acox-1 (3.559 kb) was ligated into the NheI/StuI restriction site downstream of the GFP-coding region. Approximately 50 μg/ml of plasmid DNA containing the full acox-1p::GFP::acox-1 gene construct was injected into N2 worms, which also received 50 μg/ml of the transformation marker pRF4 containing rol-6(su1006). Transgenic rolling animals were selected from the progeny.Measurement of Growth DefectsTo measure the growth defects, five synchronized adult worms were transferred to a fresh nematode growth medium plate to lay eggs for 2 h. The worms were removed, and their progeny were grown at 20 °C for 72 h. The number of worms at each developmental stage was counted.Yeast Strains and Spotting AssaysThe Saccharomyces cerevisiae strain BY4741 was used as the wild-type strain, and the Δpox1 mutant strain (YGL205W) was purchased from Open Biosystems (Huntsville, AL). Acox-1 cDNA of C. elegans was ligated into the BamHI restriction site of the pRSCupGFP expression vector containing the CUP1 promoter. The cloned construct was transformed into the Δpox1 mutant strain with standard protocols (15Sambrook, J., Fritsch, E. F., Maniatis, T., (1989) Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual, 2nd Ed., pp. 1.3, 1.4, and 2.4, Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NYGoogle Scholar). To investigate the growth rate, strains were grown for 24 h at 30 °C in YPDA-rich medium, and then cultures of each strain were equally diluted to A600 of 1 in YEP medium (1% yeast extract, 2% bacto-peptone) without a carbon source. Three microliters of a 5-fold series of dilutions of each strain was spotted on YEP agar plates containing 0.2% oleic acid and 50 μm copper ion. The spots were observed after 48 h of incubation at 30 °C.Liquid Culture Bioassays for Quantification of Dauer InductionLiquid culture bioassays to measure dauer induction were performed as previously described (11Joo H.J. Yim Y.H. Jeong P.Y. Jin Y.X. Lee J.E. Kim H. Jeong S.K. Chitwood D.J. Paik Y.K. Biochem. J. 2009; 422: 61-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). C. elegans were cultured in 100 ml of S basal liquid medium containing Escherichia coli (OP50) (16Sulston J. Hodgkin J. The Nematode Caenorhabditis elegans. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1988: 587-606Google Scholar) at 20 °C for 10 days. Additional E. coli was added to the medium on the fourth and fifth days. The dauer ratio in the liquid was measured after 10 days, with dauers confirmed by treatment with SDS as described previously (11Joo H.J. Yim Y.H. Jeong P.Y. Jin Y.X. Lee J.E. Kim H. Jeong S.K. Chitwood D.J. Paik Y.K. Biochem. J. 2009; 422: 61-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar).Extraction and Quantification of Specific DaumonesAfter worms were grown in 100 ml of S basal liquid medium for 10 days on a rotary shaker, the culture broth and worm bodies were separated by centrifugation (4629 × g for 15 min), and then the culture broth was filtered with Whatman paper to remove any remaining worms. Filtered culture broth was evaporated to obtain dried culture broth, which was then subjected to repeated extraction with ethanol for 3 days (11Joo H.J. Yim Y.H. Jeong P.Y. Jin Y.X. Lee J.E. Kim H. Jeong S.K. Chitwood D.J. Paik Y.K. Biochem. J. 2009; 422: 61-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). The ethanol was evaporated, and the residue was dissolved in 1 ml of methanol. Then 5-μl aliquots of this mixture were analyzed by LC-MS/MS in a LTQ mass spectrometer (Thermo Scientific, San Jose, CA) equipped with an electrospray ionization source. Quantification of daumones was performed as described previously (11Joo H.J. Yim Y.H. Jeong P.Y. Jin Y.X. Lee J.E. Kim H. Jeong S.K. Chitwood D.J. Paik Y.K. Biochem. J. 2009; 422: 61-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar).New Microquantitative Method for Measurement of Specific Daumones in Individual WormsA small number of worms (1–80 worms) was transferred into a 1.5-ml tube containing 20 μl of water, and the tube was stored at −70 °C. For daumone quantification, samples containing frozen worms were thawed at ambient temperature, and then 10 μl of the aqueous layer was evaporated to dryness under vacuum. Then 0.1% formic acid in acetonitrile was added to the residue. The samples were then vortexed for 1.5 min and centrifuged at 18,514 × g for 5 min. Next, 10 μl of supernatant was transferred into the autosampler for injection into the LC-MS/MS system. Stock standard solutions of daumone 1, daumone 2, and daumone 3 were dissolved in methanol, and working standards were diluted serially with methanol to obtain final concentrations of 1, 2, 5, 10, 20, 50, and 100 fmol/μl. Daumones 1, 2, and 3 were quantified with an API 4000 MS/MS system (Applied Biosystems, MDS SCIEX, Toronto, Canada) using a multiple reaction monitoring method. The data were analyzed with Analyst 1.5 software (Applied Biosystems/MDS SCIEX). Compounds were separated on a C18 column (Agilent Eclipse XDB-C18 150 × 4.6 mm, 5 μm) with an HP 1200 series pump and autosampler (Agilent). The mobile phase was 10 mm ammonium acetate buffer containing 0.1% formic acid/acetonitrile (40:60, v/v). The column temperature was 40 °C, and the flow rate was 0.5 ml/min. The total chromatographic run time was 5 min.Quantitative RT-PCRQuantitative RT-PCR was performed according to the method described previously (10Jeong P.Y. Kwon M.S. Joo H.J. Paik Y.K. PLoS One. 2009; 4: e4162Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). The relative expression rate (%) was determined using the ΔCt method, and average expression of the reference gene act-1 was used to control for template levels.RESULTSAcox-1 of C. elegans Is an Essential Component of Daumone BiosynthesisPreviously, we characterized two key genes, dhs-28 and daf-22, that participate in three of the four peroxisomal β-oxidation reactions for the production of the fatty acid component of daumones (11Joo H.J. Yim Y.H. Jeong P.Y. Jin Y.X. Lee J.E. Kim H. Jeong S.K. Chitwood D.J. Paik Y.K. Biochem. J. 2009; 422: 61-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1A). Analogous to the mammalian peroxisomal β-oxidation pathway, C. elegans acox, which encodes ACOX, has remained the only uncharacterized gene in the biosynthesis of the fatty acid component of daumones. To investigate the contribution of ACOX to daumone biosynthesis, we searched for C. elegans acox in the NCBI BLAST database and identified F09A8.1a (acox-1), which exhibits 62% homology in amino acid sequence (43% identity) to that of the human ACOX (supplemental Fig. S1). This C. elegans ACOX-1 contains a peroxisomal targeting signal at the C terminus (PSORT II database; Fig. 1A). As previously seen for two other peroxisomal enzymes, DHS-28 and DAF-22 (11Joo H.J. Yim Y.H. Jeong P.Y. Jin Y.X. Lee J.E. Kim H. Jeong S.K. Chitwood D.J. Paik Y.K. Biochem. J. 2009; 422: 61-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar), expression of an ACOX-1::GFP construct revealed that ACOX-1 is localized in the peroxisomal matrix of the intestine and hypodermis (Fig. 1B; as observed by a punctate pattern in both intestinal and hypodermal cells versus a dispersed appearance in prx-5 RNAi (17Thieringer H. Moellers B. Dodt G. Kunau W.H. Driscoll M. J. Cell Sci. 2003; 116: 1797-1804Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar) worms). Examination of acox-1(ok2257) mutants with deleted acox-1 (Fig. 1A) revealed phenotypes quite similar to dhs-28 and daf-22 mutant worms. Indeed, these worms exhibited large fat granules mainly in the intestinal region of adult tails (supplemental Fig. S2A), serious growth defects (percentages of adult stage worms 72 h after the synchronized eggs: 7.7 ± 2.4% for acox-1 mutant versus 93.8 ± 2.2% for N2; Fig. 1C), reduced body length (12–17% smaller), and reduced brood size (∼42%; supplemental Fig. S2, B and C), suggesting an important function in C. elegans peroxisomal β-oxidation. In S. cerevisiae, the peroxisome is the only site where fatty acid β-oxidation occurs, and this process is essential for growth in the presence of fatty acids. S. cerevisiae POX1 is a peroxisomal acyl-CoA oxidase that is very similar to C. elegans ACOX-1 (18Gurvitz A. Langer S. Piskacek M. Hamilton B. Ruis H. Hartig A. Yeast. 2000; 17: 188-200Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Its mutant strain, Δpox1, grows very slowly in YEP medium in the presence of oleic acid as the only carbon source (19Dmochowska A. Dignard D. Maleszka R. Thomas D.Y. Gene. 1990; 88: 247-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). To confirm that C. elegans acox-1 encodes a functional ACOX enzyme, we transformed the S. cerevisiae Δpox1 mutant with C. elegans acox-1 cDNA. As shown in Fig. 1D, the growth rate of the acox-1-transformed S. cerevisiae Δpox1 mutant was recovered in the presence of oleic acid, indicating that ACOX-1 is an authentic functional enzyme involved in the peroxisomal β-oxidation pathway. Thus, identification of acox-1 completes the components of the peroxisomal β-oxidation biosynthetic pathway (ACOX-1 → DHS-28 → DAF-22) that produces the fatty acid moieties of C. elegans daumones.Acox-1(ok2257) Mutants Have Unexpected Dauer Inducing ActivityTo further characterize the acox-1 mutants with respect to dauer formation capacity, we performed dauer assays in liquid medium by growing N2, acox-1(ok2257), and daf-22(ok693) worms for 10 days at 20 °C. N2 worms formed ∼20.7% dauers, but acox-1(ok2257) mutants yielded only 2.6% dauer formation (Fig. 2A), indicating defects in either daumone biosynthesis or the daumone sensing mechanism, although we predict that it is more likely the former. To determine whether the observed differences were associated with secreted daumones or with a daumone-sensing defect, plate dauer assays (4Jeong P.Y. Jung M. Yim Y.H. Kim H. Park M. Hong E. Lee W. Kim Y.H Kim K. Paik Y.K. Nature. 2005; 433: 541-545Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar, 11Joo H.J. Yim Y.H. Jeong P.Y. Jin Y.X. Lee J.E. Kim H. Jeong S.K. Chitwood D.J. Paik Y.K. Biochem. J. 2009; 422: 61-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar) with N2 worms were performed in nematode growth medium supplemented with liquid culture supernatant from each strain (N2, acox-1(ok2257), or daf-22(ok693) mutants; Fig. 2A). N2 worms grown in the presence of their own pheromone extracts entered the dauer stage abundantly (57.3 ± 8%), whereas N2 worms grown in the presence of pheromone extracts from acox-1(ok2257) mutants showed reduced (by ∼60%) but substantial dauer formation (21.7 ± 3.7%). Worms grown in the presence of pheromone extracts of daf-22(ok693) mutants, however, did not form dauers in agreement with previous results (11Joo H.J. Yim Y.H. Jeong P.Y. Jin Y.X. Lee J.E. Kim H. Jeong S.K. Chitwood D.J. Paik Y.K. Biochem. J. 2009; 422: 61-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). These results indicate that despite serious defects in daumone biosynthesis, acox-1(ok2257) mutants produced significant dauer inducing activity, suggesting the possibility of another ACOX isozyme(s).FIGURE 2Dauer formation and daumone quantification in liquid culture broth of C. elegans N2 wild-type worms, acox-1(ok2257) and daf-22(ok693) mutants.

Yim Y.H. Jeong P.Y. Jin Y.X. Lee J.E. Kim H. Jeong S.K. Chitwood D.J. Paik Y.K. Biochem. J. 2009; 422: 61-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). At 20 °C, the culture broth of acox-1(ok2257) mutants showed significantly reduced quantities of daumones 2 and 3 (reduced by 98.2 and 80%, respectively) compared with that of N2 (142.6 ± 4.6 to 2.6 ± 1.1 nmol/ml for daumone 2 and 83.8 ± 2.1 to 16.6 ± 1.6 nmol/ml for daumone 3; Fig. 2B and supplemental Table S1). Daumones were not detected with the LC-MS/MS analysis of culture broth from daf-22(ok693) mutants. Interestingly, daumone 1 was sharply induced by as much as 280% (28 ± 2 to 88.3 ± 12.8 nmol/ml) in acox-1(ok2257) worms, suggesting that ACOX-1 catalyzes the first reaction in the biosynthesis of daumones 2 and 3 but not daumone 1.Daumones Are Biosynthesized in a Temperature-dependent MannerIn earlier studies by the Riddle group (1Golden J.W. Riddle D.L. Dev. Biol. 1984; 102: 368-378Crossref PubMed Scopus (412) Google Scholar, 2Golden J.W. Riddle D.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1984; 81: 819-823Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar), a rise in temperature (25 °C) increased the dauer formation rate, suggesting that daumone biosynthesis or a daumone-sensing mechanism may also be influenced by a temperature increase (from 20 to 25 °C). In addition, although daumone 1 was more abundant in the supernatants from cultures grown at 20 °C than from cultures grown at 25 °C (6Butcher R.A. Ragains J.R. Kim E. Clardy J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2008; 105: 14288-14292Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar), no similar quantitative analysis for the three major daumones has been performed in the context of temperature change. Furthermore, even though daumone 2 was most abundant in the liquid culture broth (Fig. 2B), the relative concentrations of specific daumones within the worm body and the total amount of these molecules inside a single worm are completely unknown. Therefore, we developed a robust LC-MS/MS-based method for quantitative measurement of daumones present in a single worm body (see “Experimental Procedures”). Plotting the peak areas associated with specific daumones isolated from lysed samples of 1–80 synchronized 1-day N2 adult worms versus standard curves (Fig. 3A and supplemental Table S2) yielded an estimate of the total amount of daumones and the relative concentrations of each daumone in a single worm body. For N2 worm bodies (1-day adults) grown on plates at 20 °C, daumone 3 (total 31.8 ± 1.3 fmol/worm body) was the major daumone followed by daumone 1 (total 20.1 ± 3.4 fmol/worm body) and daumone 2 (total 1.8 ± 0.3 fmol/worm body; Fig. 3B). Daumone 2 was, therefore, the least abundant daumone detected in the N2 worm body, although this daumone was the most abundant one in the culture broth (Figs. 2B and 3B) (11Joo H.J. Yim Y.H. Jeong P.Y. Jin Y.X. Lee J.E. Kim H. Jeong S.K. Chitwood D.J. Paik Y.K. Biochem. J. 2009; 422: 61-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Thus, daumone 2 is the most rapidly secreted daumone in the culture broth. Interestingly, when N2 worms were grown at 25 °C, we observed a 60–120% increase in daumone 1 (20.1 ± 3.4 to 45.4 ± 10.1 fmol/worm body) and daumone 3 (31.8 ± 1.3 to 50.9 ± 3.3 fmol/worm body) but almost no change in daumone 2. These results are in stark contrast to the results of Clardy's group (6Butcher R.A. Ragains J.R. Kim E. Clardy J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2008; 105: 14288-14292Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Our results clearly demonstrate that growth temperature significantly affects the rates of daumone biosynthesis and that daumone 2 appears to be readily secreted into the medium after its synthesis, whereas daumones 1 and 3 remain in the worm body in addition to being secreted into the liquid medium (Figs. 2B and 3B). Interestingly, the relative distribution of these daumones in a single worm body was changed when the temperature was shifted from 20 to 25 °C (Fig. 3C).FIGURE 3Daumone quantification in single worm bodies of N2, acox-1(ok2257), and daf-22(ok693) mutants.

This temperature-dependent biosynthesis pattern of daumone 1 was consistent in N2 and acox-1(ok2257) mutants, where perhaps an intact and as yet unidentified ACOX involved in daumone 1 biosynthesis may be active. As seen in the case of liquid culture broth (Fig. 2B), ACOX-1 is a major enzyme involved in biosynthesis of daumones 2 and 3 but not daumone 1 in the worm body. Daumones were not detected in daf-22(ok693) worms at either 20 or 25 °C (data not shown).To search for the cause of increased daumone quantity in response to temperature change, we examined acox-1 and daf-22 expression at both temperatures. Expression of both genes was increased by 60% (ACOX-1::GFP) and 47% (DAF-22::GFP), respectively, at 25 °C compared with 20 °C (Fig. 4A). This observation was further verified by quantitative RT-PCR (Fig. 4B), which is consistent with our results showing a significant induction of daumone 1 (225%) and daumone 3 (159%) in N2 worm bodies grown at 25 °C (Fig. 3, B and C). Therefore, these results suggest that daumone biosynthesis can be regulated by controlling genes involved in the peroxisomal β-oxidation pathway in response to temperature increase.FIGURE 4Expression of daumone biosynthesis genes and daumone sensing rates of acox-1(ok2257) and daf-22(ok693) mutants at 20 and 25 °C.

https://openalex.org/W2077590283,"Talin is an adaptor protein that couples integrins to F-actin. Structural studies show that the N-terminal talin head contains an atypical FERM domain, whereas the N- and C-terminal parts of the talin rod include a series of α-helical bundles. However, determining the structure of the central part of the rod has proved problematic. Residues 1359-1659 are homologous to the MESDc1 gene product, and we therefore expressed this region of talin in Escherichia coli. The crystal structure shows a unique fold comprised of a 5- and 4-helix bundle. The 5-helix bundle is composed of nonsequential helices due to insertion of the 4-helix bundle into the loop at the C terminus of helix α3. The linker connecting the bundles forms a two-stranded anti-parallel β-sheet likely limiting the relative movement of the two bundles. Because the 5-helix bundle contains the N and C termini of this module, we propose that it is linked by short loops to adjacent bundles, whereas the 4-helix bundle protrudes from the rod. This suggests the 4-helix bundle has a unique role, and its pI (7.8) is higher than other rod domains. Both helical bundles contain vinculin-binding sites but that in the isolated 5-helix bundle is cryptic, whereas that in the isolated 4-helix bundle is constitutively active. In contrast, both bundles are required for actin binding. Finally, we show that the MESDc1 protein, which is predicted to have a similar fold, is a novel actin-binding protein."
https://openalex.org/W1964367767,"Myosin 1b (Myo1b), a class I myosin, is a widely expressed, single-headed, actin-associated molecular motor. Transient kinetic and single-molecule studies indicate that it is kinetically slow and responds to tension. Localization and subcellular fractionation studies indicate that Myo1b associates with the plasma membrane and certain subcellular organelles such as endosomes and lysosomes. Whether Myo1b directly associates with membranes is unknown. We demonstrate here that full-length rat Myo1b binds specifically and with high affinity to phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP<sub>2</sub>) and phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-triphosphate (PIP<sub>3</sub>), two phosphoinositides that play important roles in cell signaling. Binding is not Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent and does not involve the calmodulin-binding IQ region in the neck domain of Myo1b. Furthermore, the binding site is contained entirely within the C-terminal tail region, which contains a putative pleckstrin homology domain. Single mutations in the putative pleckstrin homology domain abolish binding of the tail domain of Myo1b to PIP<sub>2</sub> and PIP<sub>3</sub> <i>in vitro</i>. These same mutations alter the distribution of Myc-tagged Myo1b at membrane protrusions in HeLa cells where PIP<sub>2</sub> localizes. In addition, we found that motor activity is required for Myo1b localization in filopodia. These results suggest that binding of Myo1b to phosphoinositides plays an important role <i>in vivo</i> by regulating localization to actin-enriched membrane projections."
https://openalex.org/W2039156466,"The first committed step in triterpenoid biosynthesis is the cyclization of oxidosqualene to polycyclic alcohols or ketones C30H50O. It is catalyzed by single oxidosqualene cyclase (OSC) enzymes that can carry out varying numbers of carbocation rearrangements and, thus, generate triterpenoids with diverse carbon skeletons. OSCs from diverse plant species have been cloned and characterized, the large majority of them catalyzing relatively few rearrangement steps. It was recently predicted that special OSCs must exist that can form friedelin, the pentacyclic triterpenoid whose formation involves the maximum possible number of rearrangement steps. The goal of the present study, therefore, was to clone a friedelin synthase from Kalanchoe daigremontiana, a plant species known to accumulate this triterpenoid in its leaf surface waxes. Five OSC cDNAs were isolated, encoding proteins with 761–779 amino acids and sharing between 57.4 and 94.3% nucleotide sequence identity. Heterologous expression in yeast and GC-MS analyses showed that one of the OSCs generated the steroid cycloartenol together with minor side products, whereas the other four enzymes produced mixtures of pentacyclic triterpenoids dominated by lupeol (93%), taraxerol (60%), glutinol (66%), and friedelin (71%), respectively. The cycloartenol synthase was found expressed in all leaf tissues, whereas the lupeol, taraxerol, glutinol, and friedelin synthases were expressed only in the epidermis layers lining the upper and lower surfaces of the leaf blade. It is concluded that the function of these enzymes is to form respective triterpenoid aglycones destined to coat the leaf exterior, probably as defense compounds against pathogens or herbivores.

Triterpenoids are a very diverse group of natural products with complex alicyclic structures containing C30 backbones or derivatives formed from C30 parent structures by side chain addition/elimination (1Xu R. Fazio G.C. Matsuda S.P.T. Phytochemistry. 2004; 65: 261-291Crossref PubMed Scopus (447) Google Scholar). They are found in virtually all organisms, serving various important functions as membrane constituents (steroids in eukaryotes, hopanoids in prokaryotes), as hormones (steroids in plants and animals), and as defense compounds (pentacyclic triterpenoids in plants). The greatest structural diversity of triterpenoids is found in higher plants, where hundreds of different backbone structures have been reported, with even higher diversity arising from oxidative modification to form various aglycones and their glycosylation to saponins (2Phillips D.R. Rasbery J.M. Bartel B. Matsuda S.P.T. Curr. Opin. Plant Biol. 2006; 9: 305-314Crossref PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar). Triterpenoid biosynthesis in eukaryotes occurs by cyclization of epoxysqualene, leading in a single enzyme-catalyzed reaction to an initial product C30H50O that can contain 1–5 rings (3Abe I. Rohmer M. Prestwich G.D. Chem. Rev. 1993; 93: 2189-2206Crossref Scopus (597) Google Scholar). Although many organisms have single product-specific oxidosqualene cyclase (OSC) 4The abbreviation used is: OSCoxidosqualene cyclase. enzymes, plants can contain arrays of cyclases competing for the same substrate to form diverse steroids and pentacyclic triterpenoids (2Phillips D.R. Rasbery J.M. Bartel B. Matsuda S.P.T. Curr. Opin. Plant Biol. 2006; 9: 305-314Crossref PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar, 4Fazio G.C. Xu R. Matsuda S.P.T. J. Am. Chem.

Soc. 2007; 129: 11213-11222Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). This cyclization is, thus, a branch point between primary metabolism and secondary metabolism. Triterpenoid cyclization reactions comprise a sequence of four steps, including an initial protonation, a polyene addition cascade plus ring widening to form cycles A–E, 1,2-shifts of hydride and/or methyl groups, and a final deprotonation (Scheme 1) (3Abe I. Rohmer M. Prestwich G.D. Chem. Rev. 1993; 93: 2189-2206Crossref Scopus (597) Google Scholar). Substantial variation in carbon backbone structures is due to differences in the numbers of rearrangement steps in the third stage of the reaction. oxidosqualene cyclase. The sequence of rearrangements can be predicted based on the occurrence of tertiary carbocations (Scheme 1) and has, for the early steps along the mechanistic pathway, been confirmed by experimental evidence using inhibitor studies and enzyme domain swapping/site-directed mutagenesis (6Cattel L.

The sequence of rearrangements shifts the position of the carbocation from the E ring, where it resides at the end of the polyene reaction, toward the A ring. The cyclization products may, accordingly, be classified depending on the C=C double bond position and the number of rearrangement steps and carbocationic intermediates occurring en route. Thus, germanicane derivatives can be considered as the structures with five six-membered rings with the minimum number of rearrangements, whereas β-amyrin formation involves two more intermediates, isomultiflorenol involves another two, and glutinol involves three more. Friedelin is of special interest because it is the triterpenoid product with the maximum number of rearrangements possible. Once the entire series of rearrangements is completed and the positive charge has migrated back to the A ring, then deprotonation from the hydroxyl group rather than from a methylene unit becomes possible. Due to abstraction of the same proton that was added in the initial step of the reaction, friedelin is the only triterpenoid ketone formed directly by cyclization, in contrast to all of the other C30H50O isomers that are synthesized as unsaturated alcohols. It seems likely that the same amino acid that is donating the proton initially will accept it back after the ring formation and rearrangement steps have occurred. The residue responsible for substrate protonation is known to be an aspartate in the DCTAE motif well conserved among all OSC enzymes (16Abe I. Prestwich G.D. Lipids. 1995; 30: 231-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). OSCs from many plant species have been cloned and characterized by heterologous expression in yeast. Most of these enzymes were found to be product-specific lupeol or β-amyrin synthases, with only a few enzymes also capable of synthesizing triterpenoid products further along the rearrangement sequence (2Phillips D.R. Rasbery J.M. Bartel B. Matsuda S.P.T. Curr. Opin. Plant Biol. 2006; 9: 305-314Crossref PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar). The currently known OSC catalyzing the highest number of rearrangement steps is a product-specific enzyme from Luffa cylindrica that forms isomultiflorenol (17Hayashi H. Huang P. Inoue K. Hiraoka N. Ikeshiro Y. Yazaki K. Tanaka S. Kushiro T. Shibuya M. Ebizuka Y. Eur. J. Biochem. 2001; 268: 6311-6317Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). However, corresponding OSCs synthesizing friedelin either as the sole product or in a mixture with other triterpenoid products have not been described to date, leaving the possibility that this triterpenoid might be generated by modification of preformed pentacyclic triterpenols through rearrangements (i.e. in a two-enzyme process) rather than by direct cyclization of oxidosqualene catalyzed by a single enzyme. Corey and co-workers (18Kürti L. Chein R.J. Corey E.J. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2008; 130: 9031-9036Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar) have recently calculated free energies of various carbocations involved in the rearrangement series and found that the later rearrangement reactions are slightly endergonic. Therefore, it was concluded that the late rearrangement reactions must be coupled with earlier ones in a single enzymatic reaction in order to occur. Based on this finding, friedelin synthases are likely to be true OSC enzymes and should be cloned and characterized as such. The goal of the current investigation was to identify and characterize an enzyme forming friedelin. To that end, we had recently screened a number of Crassulaceae species for the accumulation of friedelin because multiple occurrences of this compound had previously been reported for this plant family. Special focus was on plant surface waxes, because they are known to be principal lipophilic pools containing triterpenoid aglycones. Kalanchoe daigremontiana leaf waxes were found to be particularly rich in friedelin (19van Maarseveen C. Jetter R. Phytochemistry. 2009; 70: 899-906Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar) and were chosen for further studies because this plant species is easy to cultivate and to use for molecular genetic experiments. K. daigremontiana is of further interest because its leaf surface waxes contain three other triterpenoids besides friedelin, raising the question whether these different products are formed by one promiscuous or several specific OSC enzymes. Triterpenoids accumulate mainly during the first 30 days of leaf development, indicating that activities of relevant triterpenoid synthases and, thus, expression of corresponding genes peak early during leaf development (20Van Maarseveen C. Han H. Jetter R. Plant. Cell Environ. 2009; 32: 73-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Based on these findings, the current study aimed at the isolation of mRNA coding for enzymes involved in the formation of triterpenoids in K. daigremontiana, followed by cloning of corresponding cDNAs into yeast and finally the biochemical characterization of the enzymes overexpressed there. K. daigremontiana plants were grown in standard soil under temperate greenhouse conditions. Leaves were harvested, surface-extracted with CHCl3 to remove cuticular waxes, and then ground to powder in liquid nitrogen. The powder was extracted with CHCl3, and the lipid mixture was fractionated by TLC (20 × 20 cm, silica gel, 0.5 mm; Merck) using CHCl3 as the mobile phase. Resulting bands were stained with primuline, viewed under UV light, scratched from the plates, extracted with CHCl3, and analyzed by GC-MS and GC-flame ionization detection for identification and quantification, respectively, of the triterpenoids contained in the internal leaf tissues. GC conditions were used as described below for yeast extract analyses. K. daigremontiana leaves were harvested, immediately placed in liquid nitrogen, and ground thoroughly with a mortar and pestle. Total RNA was extracted from the powder using the TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen) and used for cDNA synthesis by SuperScript II reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen) following standard protocols. The resulting cDNA mixture served directly as template for the following PCRs. Degenerate oligonucleotide primers OGL3S (5′-TTYGGNWGYCARNHRTGGGAT-3′), OGC1S (5′-TAYAATGGMAGYCARYTVTGGGA-3′), and OGN3A (5′-GGTGGDTGGRGDGARAGYYA-3′), previously designed to target conserved regions in plant OSCs (21Guhling O. Hobl B. Yeats T. Jetter R. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2006; 448: 60-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar), were used here for the amplification of the core fragments of OSCs from K. daigremontiana. PCR was carried out with recombinant TaqDNA polymerase (Fermentas) and the following cycling conditions: 2 min at 94 °C (45 s at 94 °C, 60 s at 50 °C, and 90 s at 72 °C) × 30 cycles, with a final extension of 10 min at 72 °C. The resulting PCR products were separated by gel electrophoresis (1% agarose) and extracted using the QIAquick gel extraction kit (Qiagen). A DNA product of the desired length was cloned into the pGEM-T vector (Promega) and transformed into Top10 competent cells (Invitrogen). Plasmid DNA was purified from transformed cells using the QIAprep spin miniprep kit (Qiagen) and sequenced. All further PCR products mentioned below were subcloned and sequenced by the same procedure. The core fragment was extended in a second PCR (conditions as above) using the primer BWN1S (5′-CARWAYRDDGAYGGNGGNTGGG-3′) and gene-specific primers synthesized according to the obtained core sequence (supplemental Table 1). For 3′-end amplification of the open reading frame (ORF), first strand synthesis was carried out for 1 h at 42 °C using 5 μg of total RNA, AP-primer (5′-GGCCACGCGTCGACTAGTACTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTT-3′), and reverse transcriptase in 20 μl. The product served as template in a PCR (conditions as above except annealing temperature 55 °C) with the adapter primer AUAP (5′-GGCCACGCGTCGACTAGTAC-3′) and a specific primer (supplemental Table 1). To obtain the 5′-end of the cDNA, the 5′-rapid amplification of cDNA ends system of Invitrogen was employed with the two nested gene-specific antisense primers (supplemental Table 1). The corresponding full-length cDNAs were amplified using K. daigremontiana cDNA as a template and specific N- and C-terminal primers (supplemental Table 1). The PCRs were conducted with Phusion high fidelity DNA polymerase (New England Biolabs) in a final volume of 50 μl (1 μm each primer and 1 μl of cDNA) under the following conditions: 30 s at 98 °C (10 s at 98 °C, 30 s at 55 °C, and 75 s at 72 °C) × 28 cycles, 5 min at 72 °C. The resulting 2.3-kb PCR products were purified by gel electrophoresis. Sequences were analyzed by NCBI BLAST (available from the National Institutes of Health Web site) and DNAstar software (available on the World Wide Web). Sequence information for the putative triterpenoid synthases has been deposited in GenBankTM (accession numbers KdTAS%20HM623868, KdGLS%20HM623869, KdFRS%20HM623870, KdLUS%20HM623871, KdCAS%20HM623872). The full-length cDNAs of the putative triterpenoid synthases were digested with appropriate restriction enzymes and ligated into the yeast expression vector pYES2 (Invitrogen) behind the GAL1 promoter. The resulting constructs were transformed into the mutant yeast strain GIL77 by the LiAc/SS-DNA/PEG method (22Gietz R.D. Woods R.A. Methods Enzymol. 2002; 350: 87-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (2055) Google Scholar), and yeast expression experiments were carried out as described previously (21Guhling O. Hobl B. Yeats T. Jetter R. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2006; 448: 60-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). In brief, cells were induced with galactose, incubated in 0.1 m potassium phosphate-containing glucose and hemin for 24 h, collected, refluxed for 5 min in 20% KOH, 50% EtOH, and extracted twice with 5 ml of hexane. Both hexane solutions were combined, the solvent was removed under a gentle stream of N2, and the residue was redissolved in 0.2 ml of CHCl3 for chemical analyses. Yeast lipid extracts were either analyzed directly by GC-MS or first purified by TLC and then analyzed by GC-MS and NMR. For direct GC-MS analyses, extracts were derivatized using bis-N,O-trimethylsilyltrifluoroacetamide (in pyridine at 70 °C for 60 min) or Ac2O (in pyridine at 70 °C for 4 h), dried under N2, and taken up in CHCl3. The qualitative composition was studied using a 6890N Network GC system (Agilent) equipped with a mass spectrometric detector (Agilent 5973N) and an HP-1 capillary column (Agilent, length 30 m, inner diameter 320 μm, 1-μm film thickness). 1 μl of each sample was injected on column into a flow of helium gas held constant at 1.4 ml/min. The oven temperature was programmed for 2 min at 50 °C, followed by a 40 °C/min ramp to 200 °C, held at 200 °C for 2 min, increased by 3 °C/min to 320 °C, and held at 320 °C for 30 min. Triterpenoids were identified by comparison with literature data and with authentic compounds. Standards of friedelin, β-amyrin, and lupeol were purchased from Roth. A standard of glutinol had previously been isolated from K. daigremontiana wax, purified by TLC as well as HPLC, and authenticated using GC-MS and NMR (20Van Maarseveen C. Han H. Jetter R. Plant. Cell Environ. 2009; 32: 73-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Finally, taraxerol was generated semisynthetically by lithium aluminum hydride reduction of taraxerone isolated as previously described from the surface wax mixture on Macaranga hypoleuca leaves and was purified by TLC and characterized by GC-MS as acetate and TMS derivative. Further structure confirmation was obtained from NMR analyses. To this end, compounds were purified from yeast extracts using TLC as described above for plant lipid separation. 13C NMR spectra of the resulting fractions were recorded at 400 MHz in CDCl3 solution. Chemical shifts, expressed as values relative to the solvent signals δ 77.0 (t) for 13C were recorded for two triterpenoids isolated from transgenic yeast: compound 3 δ 16.41 (C-25), 18.43 (C-1), 18.63 (C-26), 19.83 (C-27), 23.86 (C-7), 25.66 (C-23), 28.04 (C-2), 28.46 (C-20), 29.17 (C-24), 30.31 (C-17), 30.57 (C-12), 32.25 (C-28), 32.30 (C-21), 32.61 (C-30), 33.34 (C-11), 34.74 (C-29), 34.83 (C-15), 35.06 (C-9), 35.30 (C-16), 36.24 (C-19), 38.06 (C-14), 39.17 (C-22), 39.52 (C-13), 41.03 (C-4), 43.29 (C-18), 47.65 (C-8), 49.91 (C-10), 76.54 (C-3), 122.26 (C-6), 141.84 (C-5); compound 4 δ 7.04 (C-23), 14.88 (C-24),18.16 (C-25), 18.46 (C-7), 18.88 (C-27), 20.48 (C-30), 22.50 (C-1), 28.39 (C-20), 30.22 (C-17), 30.73 (C-21), 32.00 (C-26), 32.31 (C-28), 32.65 (C-12), 33.00 (C-15), 35.24 (C-29), 35.57 (C-11), 35.85 (C-16), 36.24 (C-19), 37.67 (C-9), 38.52 (C-13), 39.47 (C-22), 39.92 (C-14), 41.52 (C-6), 41.75 (C-2), 42.36 (C-5), 43.03 (C-8), 53.33 (C-18), 58.45 (C-4), 59.71 (C-10), 213.40 (C-3). The quantitative composition of the yeast lipid mixtures was studied using capillary GC with a flame ionization detector under the same GC conditions as above but H2 carrier gas at 2.0 ml/min. Five independent analyses were carried out for each transgenic yeast line. Sequence alignments and phylogenetic analyses based on a neighbor-joining method were carried out with the ClustalX program Version 1.83 (23Thompson J.D. Gibson T.J. Plewniak F. Jeanmougin F. Higgins D.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 4876-4882Crossref PubMed Scopus (35308) Google Scholar), using the amino acid sequences of cloned and characterized plant OSCs. A phylogenetic tree was created based on 1,000 bootstrap replications with the MEGA3.1 program. The GenBankTM data base accession numbers of the sequences used in the analysis are shown in supplemental Table 2. The epidermal cell layers were peeled from the upper and lower surfaces of K. daigremontiana leaves, and the remaining inner tissue as well as the epidermis preparations were immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen, ground into powders using a mortar and pestle, and used to extract RNA with TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen). The RNA samples were used for cDNA synthesis by SuperScript II reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen) following standard protocols. Gene-specific primers were designed to amplify fragments of the five different OSCs (listed in supplemental Table 1). Additionally, a 287-bp fragment of the actin gene was amplified as a positive control using the primers 5′-CGTTCTCTCCTTGTATGCCAGTGGTC-3′ and 5′-GAGCTGCTCTTGGCAGTCTCAAGTTC-3′. PCR cycle numbers and template amounts were optimized to yield products in the linear range of the reaction. PCR conditions for comparison of transcription levels for the five OCSs were as follows: 25 ng of template cDNA denatured at 94 °C for 2 min, followed by 23 cycles of 94 °C for 30 s, 55 °C for 45 s, and 72 °C for 60 s. Reactions were maintained at 72 °C for 10 min before separation of PCR products by electrophoresis in a 1% agarose gel. RNA samples from leaf epidermal cell layers were used for cDNA synthesis by SuperScript II Reverse Transcriptase (Invitrogen) following standard protocols. Gene-specific primers were designed to amplify fragments of the four different OSCs, and the specificity of these primers was confirmed by a series of PCRs with plasmid DNA as a template. Quantitative PCR was carried out using SYBR GreenER qPCR SuperMix Universal kit (Invitrogen). The quantitative PCRs were programmed at 95 °C for 9 min, followed by 40 cycles of 94 °C for 30 s, 55 °C for 30 s, and 72 °C for 30 s on an MJ MiniOpticon real-time PCR system (Bio-Rad). The goal of the current investigation was to identify and characterize enzymes forming pentacyclic triterpenoids through skeletal rearrangement series much longer than those occurring in previously known OSCs. In particular, the synthesis of friedelin had been predicted to involve the maximum number of 1,2-methyl and 1,2-hydride shifts after initial cyclization and thus requires an OSC capable of stabilizing more high energy carbocation intermediates than any other comparable enzymes (18Kürti L. Chein R.J. Corey E.J. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2008; 130: 9031-9036Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). K. daigremontiana leaf surface lipids accumulate friedelin, together with a number of other pentacyclic triterpenoids, suggesting that this species must contain a friedelin synthase (19van Maarseveen C. Jetter R. Phytochemistry. 2009; 70: 899-906Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). It was therefore chosen as a model for the current study. Previous analyses had shown that K. daigremontiana leaves accumulate triterpenoids during the first stages of expansive growth, for ∼40 days after onset of leaf development (20Van Maarseveen C. Han H. Jetter R. Plant. Cell Environ. 2009; 32: 73-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Here, it was further found that the major portion of these triterpenoids is accumulating in the cuticular waxes coating the exterior walls of epidermal cells, with only 2% of the total amounts of glutinol and of friedelin being present in the internal tissues of K. daigremontiana leaves. Therefore, it was assumed that OSC expression should be largely restricted to the epidermal cell layers in this tissue, and they were peeled from both sides of young K. daigremontiana leaves (<20 days old) to harvest mRNA enriched in target OSC sequences. The resulting mRNA population was transcribed into cDNA, which served as a template for the following PCR-based cloning. In a first PCR experiment, degenerate primers targeting the highly conserved consensus sequences of published OSCs were employed to amplify the core segment of potential OSC sequences. The PCR product mixture was separated by gel electrophoresis, yielding one major band corresponding to the expected size of 750 bp that was isolated, cloned, and amplified in E. coli. Based on restriction and PCR analyses, 32 bacterial colonies containing plasmids with inserts of the expected length were selected for sequencing. Inserts with five different sequences were found, each of them represented between three and six times. Extended core sequences were obtained by a set of PCRs. Finally, 5′- and 3′-rapid amplification of cDNA end reactions with specific primers yielded five full-length sequences named KdTAS, KdGLS, KdFRS, KdLUS, and KdCAS, each containing one of the core segments (Fig. 1). All of the cloned K. daigremontiana OCSs possess the amino acid motif DCTAE implicated in substrate binding (16Abe I. Prestwich G.D. Lipids. 1995; 30: 231-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar) and the four QW motifs characteristic of the OSC superfamily (24Poralla K. Hewelt A. Prestwich G.D. Abe I. Reipen I.G. Sprenger G.A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1994; 19: 157-158Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). The ORFs of the K. daigremontiana OSCs range from 2,286 to 2,340 nucleotides in length, sharing between 57.4 and 94.3% with each other (Table 1). The amino acid sequences of these four genes show relatively high levels of identity with known β-amyrin synthases from other plant species, whereas the KdCAS ORF has substantially higher similarity with corresponding cycloartenol synthases (Table 2).TABLE 1DNA sequence identities between OSCs cloned from K. daigremontianaKdGLSKdFRSKdTASKdLUS%%%%KdFRS94.3KdTAS72.575.0KdLUS94.392.875.1KdCAS57.461.359.460.4 Open table in a new tab TABLE 2Sequence identities between OSCs cloned from K. daigremontiana and selected OSCs previously described in the literaturePlant speciesMajor productAccession numberAmino acid sequence similarity with K. daigremontiana OSCs (amino acid number in parentheses)KdGLS (767)KdFRS (761)KdTAS (779)KdLUS (765)KdCAS (764)%%%%%B. platyphyllaβ-AmyrinAB05551276.576.784.778.657.5P. ginsengβ-AmyrinAB01405774.674.982.375.857.3P. ginsengβ-AmyrinAB00903075.875.980.677.557.4Rhizophora stylosaMultifunctionalAB26320375.275.980.677.156.4Euphorbia tirucalliβ-AmyrinAB20646975.375.780.777.057.6Lathyrus japonicusCycloartenolAB18124658.058.158.759.779.8P. ginsengCycloartenolAB00902957.058.259.258.679.2 Open table in a new tab Phylogenetic analyses using the neighbor-joining method (ClustalX) (23Thompson J.D.

Although the first three enzymes from K. daigremontiana form a new branch within this cluster of OSC enzymes, KdTAS is more closely related to the β-amyrin synthases BPY, PNY, and PNY2 from Betula platyphylla and Panax ginseng. Each of the four OSCs from K. daigremontiana shares at least 76% sequence identity with one or more OSCs reported in the literature to date (Table 2). Finally, KdCAS was found to group together with the cycloartenol synthases from various other species (Fig. 2).FIGURE 2Phylogenetic analysis comparing the new OSC cDNAs cloned from K. daigremontiana with previously known OSCs from other plant species.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) In order to biochemically characterize the putative OSCs from K. daigremontiana, their full-length ORFs were heterologously expressed in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. The yeast mutant GIL77 (gal2 hem3-6 erg7 ura3-167) was used for this purpose because it is deficient in lanosterol synthase and therefore accumulates high concentrations of 2,3-oxidosqualene that can serve as substrate for OSC-catalyzed cyclization (25Kushiro T. Shibuya M. Ebizuka Y. Eur. J. Biochem. 1998; 256: 238-244Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar). However, growth of this strain requires exogenous ergosterol, which must be added to the medium and is consequently detected in triterpenoid analyses together with the products of the transgenic OSCs. All five K. daigremontiana cDNAs were subcloned into the yeast expression vector pYES2, and the resulting constructs were transformed into GIL77. In parallel, the empty vector was transformed into the yeast mutant to serve as a negative control. Three independent lines were selected from each transformation experiment and were further grown in the presence of ergosterol, induced with galactose, and extracted. The extracts were acetylated and analyzed by GC-MS in order to identify triterpenoids, whereas GC-flame ionization detection was used to assess relative quantities of the compounds. No differences between parallel lines were found, and therefore results are shown here for only one line harboring each OSC construct. All six yeast transformants were found to contain two compounds in common, which were identified as ergosterol and 2,3-oxidosqualene. In addition, the extracts from yeast harboring K. daigremontiana cDNAs contained several compounds not present in the control, most of them also differing between the lines expressing different OSC candidate cDNAs. The structures of all major compounds were elucidated by comparison of mass spectral characteristics with those of authentic standards (Fig. 3) and of GC elution behavior (Fig. 4). Most of the triterpenoids in the yeast extracts were found to contain hydroxyl functions and could therefore be derivatized in order to improve chromatographic resolution and spectral quality. Acetate esters and trimethylsilyl ethers were generated for all these triterpenoid alcohols, and both derivatives together were used to assign structures. Lupeol and β-amyrin were identified by comparison with commercial standards, whereas glutinol was identified by comparison with a standard that had been extracted from K. daigremontiana leaf wax and authenticated by 1H NMR and 13C NMR analysis (20Van Maarseveen C. Han H. Jetter R. Plant. Cell Environ. 2009; 32: 73-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). The structure of taraxerol was assigned by comparing MS data for the acetate ester and TMS ether with those reported in the literature and found for the corresponding triterpenoid isolated from M. hypoleuca leaf wax (26Markstädter C. Federle W. Jetter R. Riederer M. Hölldobler B. Chemoecology. 2000; 10: 33-40Crossref Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Finally, one compound in the yeast extracts was identified as the triterpenoid ketone friedelin based on direct comparison with a commercial standard of this compound and 1H NMR and 13C NMR analysis. Quantitative analyses were carried out on five independent parallels of each transgenic yeast line. They showed that all of the lines expressing putative OSC cDNAs contained 2,3-oxidosqualene at markedly lower concentrations than the empty vector control (Fig. 4). Yeast heterologously expressing KdTAS cDNA produced a mixture of taraxerol (60 ± 1%; mean ± S.D., n = 5) and β-amyrin (40% ± 1%), whereas expression of KdGLS cDNA prompted the formation of glutinol (67 ± 2%) together with friedelin (14 ± 1%), β-amyrin (11 ± 0.3%), and taraxerol (8 ± 0.2%). Expression of the plasmid pYES2-KdFRS resulted in the formation of friedelin (72 ± 1%), accompanied by smaller amounts of β-amyrin (18 ± 0.1%) and taraxerol (10 ± 1%). Lines harboring KdLUS cDNA produced a mixture of lupeol (93 ± 2%) and β-amyrin (7 ± 2%). The products formed by the four OSCs together account for all of the major triterpenoids found in the cuticular wax on K. daigremontiana leaves (19van Maarseveen C. Jetter R. Phytochemistry. 2009; 70: 899-906Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 20Van Maarseveen C. Han H. Jetter R. Plant. Cell Environ. 2009; 32: 73-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). The relative activity of the four OSC genes characterized here can be estimated based on our GC analyses of the transgenic yeast extracts (Fig. 4). Because exactly the same amounts of ergosterol had been added to all cultures and samples had been taken and worked up in the same way, the steroid can serve as an internal standard to estimate the amounts of triterpenoid products formed. Hence, it can be concluded that KdLUS was the most active enzyme when tested in yeast, followed by KdFRS and KdGLS, whereas KdTAS was found to be a much less active OSC. Finally, extracts of GIL77 yeast cells functionally expressing KdCAS cDNA were found to contain cycloartenol together with some unidentified cyclization products (data not shown). To investigate whether OSC transcription is tissue-specific, RT-PCR analyses were carried out. Five pairs of PCR primers were designed based on the OSC sequences and first tested for gene specificity using plasmids harboring full-length cDNAs of the five OSCs. It was found that each primer pair allowed amplification of its target OSC sequence fragment but not of the other four OSCs (data not shown). Total RNA was isolated from leaf inner tissue as well as the abaxial and adaxial epidermal layers of K. daigremontiana leaves, and the RT-PCR analysis using these RNA samples showed that the KdCAS enzyme is expressed equally in all tissues within the leaf (Fig. 5), in accordance with its likely role in membrane steroid production of all cells. In contrast, the KdTAS, KdFRS, KdGLS, and KdLUS enzymes are expressed only in the epidermal cells on both sides of the leaf and not in internal leaf tissues (Fig. 5). These results are in agreement with the accumulation of the triterpenoid products to high concentrations in the cuticular waxes on both leaf surfaces. Our results show that the major biological function of all four genes is in formation of triterpenoids targeted to the plant surface, where they probably play important roles in protecting the tissue from herbivores and pathogens. Although the above results show that the four OSCs are involved in the formation of cuticular triterpenoids in the K. daigremontiana leaf, it remains to be elucidated how much each enzyme contributes to the product mixture. However, the enzyme activities within the tissue cannot be determined directly due to the low solubility of substrates and products. In order to assess the relative contribution of the four OSCs, the relative expression levels of the corresponding genes were assessed using quantitative RT-PCR. It was found that the expression levels were highest for KdLUS, intermediate for KdTAS, and lowest for KdGLS and KdFRS (Fig. 6). Taking the gene expression levels together with the relative activities of the OSCs (determined in yeast; see above), it seems likely that KdLUS should have the highest absolute activity in the K. daigremontiana leaf. The other three OSC activities are predicted to be lower than KdLUS and similar to each other because higher relative activities of KdGLS and KdFRS might be compensated for by the higher expression level of KdTAS. These predicted activity levels of the four OSCs do not match the triterpenoid profile in the cuticular waxes of K. daigremontiana leaves, which had been reported to contain ∼62% glutinol (and its derivatives), 20% friedelin, 13% taraxerol, and 5% β-amyrin, whereas lupeol had not been detected at all. It should be noted that germanicol had been described for the leaf wax, but further analyses using authentic standard as described here have now confirmed that the true structure of the compound is taraxerol both in the wax and in the yeast product. The discrepancy between our biochemical data and the wax triterpenoid profile might be due to one or more of the following reasons. 1) The apparent OSC activities in yeast might be misleading because of artifacts in the heterologous environment, 2) large portions of the triterpenoid products formed by the OSCs in the plant might be transformed and/or sequestered in inner leaf tissues and therefore might not be reflected in previous surface wax analyses, or 3) other OSCs might be present in K. daigremontiana that contribute further to the product profile. Friedelin is a very late quench product of the 1,2-hydride and 1,2-methyl rearrangement series, and the OSC forming this product can thus be expected to have catalytic site features stabilizing the maximum possible cationic intermediates. Interestingly, a second OSC from K. daigremontiana was found to form predominantly glutinol, the triterpenoid product generated immediately before friedelin along the rearrangement cascade. Both enzymes share very high sequence identity, and thus the small differences in amino acid structures between them can now be used to identify amino acids that may be involved in determining product specificities for either friedelin or glutinol. Residues Ala79, Ser127, Gln172, His278, Lys350, and Phe423 in the sequence of KdFRS stand out because they differ between the friedelin synthase and most other OSCs and because they involve aromatic amino acids either in KdFRS or in the other enzymes. Aromatic residues are thought to be important for the cyclization mechanism because they can stabilize the cationic intermediates. Further amino acids of interest in KdFRS are Ile323 and Thr733 because they differ in this enzyme from all other OSCs, including KdGLS. Finally, amino acids His103, Leu249, Gln297, Phe497, Thr367, and Thr370 not only differ between KdFRS and other OSCs, but they are also predicted to line the active site or to be located near it, according to three-dimensional structure modeling (data not shown) based on the crystal structure available for human lanosterol synthase (27Thoma R. Schulz-Gasch T. D'Arcy B. Benz J. Aebi J. Dehmlow H. Hennig M. Stihle M. Ruf A. Nature. 2004; 432: 118-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar). The role of the amino acids listed above in OSC product specificity is presently being investigated using site-directed mutagenesis experiments. To identify further residues possibly involved in the cyclization mechanism, domain-swapping experiments are also currently being carried out. Altogether, five different OSCs from one plant species have been cloned and fully characterized by heterologous expression in yeast. Very diverse triterpenoids were identified as products of the enzymes, ranging from taraxerol over glutinol to friedelin. This is the first report on the sequence and biochemical characteristics of such a friedelin synthase, confirming the prediction that this late triterpenoid product is indeed formed in one sequence of catalytic steps. In comparison with friedelin and glutinol, taraxerol is a relatively early product of the rearrangement series, and the OSC forming this product must be stabilizing fewer cationic intermediates than the others. This is also the first report describing a taraxerol synthase, now providing the opportunity to perform further comparative studies of the amino acid structures determining earlier rearrangement steps in the sequence."

Nature. 1996; 383: 402Crossref Scopus (366) Google Scholar), challenged the Chl a-centralized requirement in oxygenic photosynthesis. Chlorophyll d only differs from Chl a through one substitution at the C31 position: the vinyl group of Chl a is replaced by a formyl group in Chl d (Fig. 1). This substitution results in the following unique characteristics of Chl d: 1) its Qy absorption peaks (in vivo) lie between 690 and 740 nm (Fig. 1) where other oxygenic Chls (i.e. Chl a, b, or c) do not absorb (3Schiller H. Senger H. Miyashita H. Miyachi S. Dau H.

The known Chl biosynthetic pathway contains at least 17 enzymatic steps from the precursor δ-aminolevulinic acid to Chl a. Eight molecules of δ-aminolevulinic acid are condensed together to form four monopyrroles that condense to a linear tetrapyrrole, which in turn is cyclized to uropor-phyrinogen III (7Beale S.I. Photosynth. Res. 1999; 60: 43-73Crossref Scopus (379) Google Scholar). Metal-free protoporphyrin IX is formed after a number of decarboxylation and oxidation reactions. Protochlorophyllide is synthesized from protoporphyrin IX through magnesium insertion, methylation, and oxidative cyclization reactions forming a fifth ring (8Willows R.D. Nat. Prod. Rep. 2003; 20: 327-341Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Reductions of ring D as well as of the vinyl group on ring B result in chlorophyllide a, which is converted to Chl a by an esterification of phytol. All of the intermediate products up to the step of chlorophyllide are common in the synthesis of all (bacterio-) chlorophylls (7Beale S.I. Photosynth.

However, the enzymes carrying out most of the oxidation and reduction reactions are different in anaerobic and aerobic environments because they either are oxygen-sensitive or require different chemistry to catalyze the oxidations in the absence of oxygen (8Willows R.D.

The oxygen atoms of Chl and BChl molecules have their origins in either molecular oxygen or water and thus are incorporated by an oxygenase or a hydratase reaction mechanism, respectively (9Raymond J. Blankenship R.E. Geobiology. 2004; 2: 199-203Crossref Google Scholar, 14Hayaishi O. Hayaishi O. Molecular Mechanisms of Oxygen Activation. Academic Press, London1974: 1-28Google Scholar). All four oxygen atoms of the C133- and C173-carboxyl groups arise from the precursor δ-aminolevulinic acid and thus originate from water during δ-aminolevulinic acid synthesis, which was confirmed by Porra et al. in 1995 and 1996 (15Porra R.J.

Biochem. 1996; 239: 85-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). The fifth oxygen atom of the C131-oxo group is derived from molecular oxygen in most aerobic photosynthetic organisms and is thus an oxygenase-type reaction (9Raymond J. Blankenship R.E.

Whereas this oxygen is derived from water using a hydratase reaction mechanism in anaerobic photosynthetic organisms, some exceptions to this generalization exist (9Raymond J. Blankenship R.E.

Chlorophyll b contains six oxygen atoms: the same five oxygen atoms as in Chl a plus an additional oxygen atom in the C71-formyl group. The oxygen atom of the C71-formyl group of Chl b originates from dioxygen (O2), i.e. an oxygenase-type reaction mechanism (12Porra R.J. Schäfer W. Cmiel E. Katheder I. Scheer H. FEBS Lett. 1993; 323: 31-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 19Schneegurt M.A. Beale S.I. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 11677-11683Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 20Oster U. Tanaka R. Tanaka A. Rüdiger W. Plant J. 2000; 21: 305-310Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A single enzyme, chlorophyll a mono-oxygenase, facilitating this reaction was identified (21Tanaka A. Ito H. Tanaka R. Tanaka N.K. Yoshida K. Okada K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1998; 95: 12719-12723Crossref PubMed Scopus (344) Google Scholar). The chlorophyll a mono-oxygenase converts the C71-methyl group of Chl a into a formyl group, thereby forming Chl b. Chlorophyll d contains six oxygen atoms. They are the same five oxygen atoms as in Chl a plus an additional oxygen atom in the C31-formyl group. The formation of the C31-formyl group of Chl d must be catalyzed by a different enzyme than the chlorophyll a mono-oxygenase because it requires the breakage of a C=C double bond of the C31-vinyl group, converting it into a formyl group (Fig. 1). The determination of the origin of the C31-formyl group oxygen atom of Chl d will be a crucial step toward understanding the mechanisms of the biosynthetic pathway of Chl d. There are two possible hypotheses for the origin of the formyl group oxygen atom in the Chl d molecule. Hypothesis A is that the formyl group oxygen atom was introduced into Chl d from dioxygen via an oxygenase-type reaction mechanism. Hypothesis B is that the formyl group oxygen of Chl d originated from water and was incorporated into Chl d via a hydratase-type reaction mechanism. In 1998, it was hypothesized that Chl d may represent an intermediate stage between BChls and Chls, utilizing anaerobic or aerobic metabolic pathways (22Blankenship R.E. Hartman H. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1998; 23: 94-97Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar). They based their hypothesis on the fact that the oxygen atom of the C31-acetyl group of BChl a is derived from water using a reductive mechanism, suitable to an anaerobic environment. Until today, it was not known from where the six oxygen atoms of Chl d are derived, especially the oxygen atom of the C31-formyl group. Chlorophyll d is the major Chl in Acaryochloris with key roles in all photosynthetic reactions (23Kühl M. Chen M. Larkum A.W.D. Seckbach J. Algae and Cyanobacteria in Extreme Environments. Springer, Berlin2007: 101-123Google Scholar). Chlorophyll a is a minor photo pigment in Acaryochloris making up less than 3–5% of the total Chls (2Miyashita H. Ikemoto H. Kurano N. Adachi K. Chihara M. Miyachi S. Nature. 1996; 383: 402Crossref Scopus (366) Google Scholar). However, the functions and roles of Chl a in Acaryochloris have been debated since its discovery (5Chen M. Telfer A.

We report here the elucidation of the origins of all six oxygen atoms of Chl d utilizing the stable isotope 18O, in the form of 18O2 in the gaseous phase or H218O in the culture medium, as a molecular tracer. Our results suggest that Chl a is a direct precursor in the Chl d biosynthetic pathway and that the C31-formyl group of Chl d is formed via an oxidative reaction mechanism. The cells were incubated under continuous, fluorescent white light with an intensity of 30 μmol photons m−2 s−1, on a rotating flat bed shaker with ∼100 rpm. Freeze-dried 1-ml aliquots of KES-sea water medium (ASW-KES) (2Miyashita H. Ikemoto H. Kurano N. Adachi K. Chihara M. Miyachi S. Nature. 1996; 383: 402Crossref Scopus (366) Google Scholar) were resuspended in 1 ml of H218O (98% 18O; Marshall Isotope) and inoculated with 100 μl of Acaryochloris (MBIC11017) culture with a Qy transition (∼710 nm) absorbance of 1.0. The experiments were terminated at 24, 48, 72, and 120 h, respectively, and the pigments were extracted from the cells as described below. Twenty-five ml of Acaryochloris MBIC11017 culture with an absorption maximum of 0.2 at 710 nm in ASW-KES medium (2Miyashita H. Ikemoto H. Kurano N. Adachi K. Chihara M. Miyachi S. Nature. 1996; 383: 402Crossref Scopus (366) Google Scholar) were grown in the presence of 50% 18O2 (97% 18O; Cambridge Isotopes) and 50% dinitrogen (N2) gas. One-ml cell culture aliquots were sampled for pigment extraction at 24, 48, 72, 96, 150, and 200 h, respectively. The growth rates of the cultures were monitored by recording the maximum absorption of each culture in vivo (at A710 nm) using a spectrophotometer (Shimadzu UV-2550) with a Taylor sphere attachment (ISR-240A; Shimadzu). All of the pigment extraction processes were carried out quickly and under dim green light to minimize any potential photodamage. Acaryochloris cells were harvested by centrifugation at 16,000 × g in a microcentrifuge for 5 min. Pigments were extracted from the cell pellets using ice-cold 100% methanol for a maximum of 15 min on ice in dark. The methanolic pigment extracts were centrifuged and immediately injected into a Shimadzu VP series HPLC system using a reverse phase C18 column (Synergi Fusion, 250 × 4.6 mm; Phenomenex) at a flow rate of 1 ml/min. The column was equilibrated with solvent A and B (50%:50%). Solvent A was 80% acetonitrile and 20% 0.2 m ammonium acetate; solvent B was 100% methanol. The program was as follows: 6.5 min in mixed solvents A and B (50%:50%); then a linear gradient of solvent B from 50 to 100% in 7 min followed by 23 min in 100% solvent B. Fractions of Chl d and a were collected at retention times of 19.7 and 21.2 min, respectively, for subsequent MALDI-MS analysis. The ratios of pigments were calculated based on HPLC chromatogram peak areas using Shimadzu Class VP 6.14 software. Each peak was evaluated individually at its published maximum absorption wavelength and normalized to its extinction coefficient (in methanol) at that wavelength: molar extinction coefficient of Chl d, ϵ = 77.62 mol−1 cm−1 at 696 nm; Chl a, ϵ = 68.72 mol−1 cm−1 at 665 nm (28Ritchie R.J. Photosynth. Res. 2006; 89: 27-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (777) Google Scholar). For increased signal intensity the collected fractions of Chl a and d were concentrated via vacuum centrifugation prior to mass spectrometry analysis. Concentrated pigments were mixed with the electron transfer matrix terthiopene (Sigma) dissolved in acetone at 10 mg/ml, and 2–5 μl of the mixture were spotted on a sample plate. Mass spectra were obtained by MALDI-MS on a Voyager-DE STR (Applied BioSystems), which was run in positive ion reflector mode at 22,000 V. The readings were obtained by averaging 250 single-shot spectra to achieve a good signal-to-noise ratio. The noise level/mass spectrum was averaged for each condition and regarded as the reading error. Chlorophyll a (C55H72N4O5Mg) with an average molecular mass of 893.5 Da and a monoisotopic mass of 892.44 Da contains five oxygen atoms, and Chl d (C54H70N4O6Mg) with an average molecular mass of 895.5 Da and a monoisotopic mass of 894.5 Da has six oxygen atoms. Upon 18O incubation zero (monoisotopic Chl mass, with 16O only), one, two, three, four, or all oxygen atoms (five for Chl a and six for Chl d) can be labeled with isotopic 18O. Therefore, the mass spectrum of Chl a (or Chl d) contains a mixture of 18O and 16O isotopes, which can be viewed as an overlay of all six (seven for Chl d) individual mass spectra, i.e. 18O016O5, 18O116O4, 18O216O3, 18O316O2, 18O416O1, and 18O516O0 group of molecules. An isotopic (18O016O5, for unlabeled Chl a) mass distribution can be calculated, at 1-Da intervals, based on the naturally occurring carbon isotopes (Fig. 2). Thus the expected relative intensities (A1, A2, A3… AN) of the first six mass peaks (as M+0, M+1, M+2, M+3, M+4, and M+5 ions) of Chl a are 100, 75, 42, 15.5, 3.7, and 0.5, respectively, and the first six mass peaks of Chl d are 100, 73.9, 41.3, 15.1, 3.7, and 0.4, respectively (Fig. 2). A 2-Da difference in mass (m/z) is expected from each isotopic 18O incorporation event in the newly synthesized Chls. The distribution of the measured intensities (I1, I3, I5… IN) of the mass peaks of Chl isolated from cells grown under isotopic 18O labeling conditions can be calculated by the following set of linear equations, A1∗C(18O0)=I1(Eq. 1) A3∗C(18O0)+A1∗C(18O1)=I3(Eq. 2) A5∗C(18O0)+A3∗C(18O1)+A1∗C(18O2)=I5(Eq. 3) A7∗C(18O0)+A5∗C(18O1)+A3∗C(18O2)+A1∗C(18O3)=I7(Eq. 4) A9∗C(18O0)+A7∗C(18O1)+A7∗C(18O1)+A5∗C(18O2)+A3∗C(18O3)+A1∗C(18O4)=I9(Eq. 5) A11∗C(18O0)+A9∗C(18O1)+A7∗C(18O2)+A5∗C(18O3)+A5∗C(18O3)+A3∗C(18O4)+A1∗C(18O5)=I11(Eq. 6) where C(18O0), C(18O1), and C(18O5) are relative concentrations (summing to 1) of the Chl isotopomers containing between zero and five 18O atoms (six for Chl d) and A1, A3, A5… A11 are the relative intensities of the natural abundance isotopomer peaks. I1 corresponds to the monoisotopic mass of m/z = 892.5 for Chl a containing only monoisotopic 16O atoms (or m/z = 894.5 for Chl d). The sum of C(18O016O5), C(18O116O4), and C(18O516O0) equals 100% (1.00), and each value represents the relative concentration of each isotopic 18O incorporation into the Chls in the sample, which can be determined for each mass spectrum. The samples were collected as described above. Because of the cost of H218O, we grew cells in 1-ml cultures. The results were obtained from a minimum of two individual experiments for each time point with at least one technical repeat. The level of Chl d was slightly higher in the presence of 18O2, but no statistically significant difference between the two culture conditions was observed (Table 1).TABLE 1The ratio of chlorophylls in isotopic 18O labeling experimentsPresenceRatio of Chl a to Chl dChl d%H218O (98%)0.0616 ± 0.01894.19 ± 1.6018O2 (50%)0.0594 ± 0.00894.39 ± 0.69 Open table in a new tab The maximum mass of newly synthesized Chl a extracted from Acaryochloris cells grown in the presence of H218O in the culture medium for 48 h was 900.44 m/z. This was 8 Da heavier than the monoisotopic mass of Chl a (892.44 m/z) because of the incorporation of four 18O atoms derived from water (Fig. 3A). The extracted Chl d from the same 48-h sample displayed a mass peak distribution pattern similar to the calculated monoisotopic/isotopic mass peak distribution of Chl d in Fig. 2, i.e. no significant incorporation of 18O in Chl d originating from H218O could be observed at 48 h (Fig. 3B). The time course 18O labeling profiles of Chl a indicated that almost all extracted Chl a at 48 h was newly synthesized, suggesting an almost complete turnover of Chl a within 48 h (Fig. 4A). A trace amount of Chl a containing five 18O atoms was observed at 115 h of incubation time but below the noise level (data not shown), which may be due to the incorporation of accumulated 18O2 released from H218O by photosynthesis. On the other hand, Chl d extracted from the same cells displayed a different 18O incorporation rate profile over time. There was very little 18O incorporation into Chl d up to 65 h (>20%); the slight increase at 24 h being mostly due to an increased signal-to-noise ratio (Fig. 4B). Chlorophyll d containing one or more isotopic 18O atoms was only observed at ∼115 h (60% of total Chl d) (Fig. 4B). Comparison of the time course 18O labeling profiles of Chl a and Chl d suggested that Chl a is synthesized first, and Chl d is produced from the newly synthesized (isotopic 18O labeled) Chl a after 65 h (Fig. 4). The fast incorporation rate of 18O originating from H218O into Chl a (∼40% at 24 h; ∼90% at 48 h) is the result of a rapid turnover of Chl a because of it being continuously synthesized into Chl d, which comprises ∼95% of the total Chls in Acaryochloris. The newly synthesized Chl d, with incorporated 18O, was only observable after it accumulated to a level detectable above the background of unlabeled Chl d present at the start of the labeling experiment. The mass spectrometry analysis of Chl a isolated from cells that were grown in the presence of 18O2 for 24 h had significant incorporation of one 18O with a mass peak distribution of 40% monoisotopic mass (892.44 m/z) and 60% isotopic mass +2 Da (Fig. 5A). Even after 192 h of incubation time, there was only incorporation of one 18O atom into Chl a, which is consistent with previous reports that only the C131-oxo group oxygen atom in Chl a is derived from O2 gas (10Swingley W.D. Chen M. Cheung P.C. Conrad A.L. Dejesa L.C. Hao J. Honchak B.M. Karbach L.E. Kurdoglu A. Lahiri S. Mastrian S.D. Miyashita H. Page L. Ramakrishna P. Satoh S. Sattley W.M. Shimada Y. Taylor H.L. Tomo T. Tsuchiya T. Wang Z.T. Raymond J. Mimuro M. Blankenship R.E. Touchman J.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2008; 105: 2005-2010Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar, 15Porra R.J. Schäfer W. Katheder I. Scheer H. FEBS Lett. 1995; 371: 21-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). The time course incorporation profile of the 18O2 labeling experiment showed a fast turnover of Chl a similar to that in the H218O labeling experiment; thus after 48 h, almost all Chl a is isotopic 18O-labeled originating from either 18O2 or H218O, respectively (Figs. 4A and 5A). In the case of Chl d, two isotopic 18O atoms are incorporated into Chl d upon incubation of cells in the presence of 18O2. The double isotopic 18O-labeled Chl d followed a concomitant decrease in the amount of monoisotopic standard mass Chl d (894.55 m/z) from 0 to 72 h in 18O2 (Fig. 5B). Single isotopic 18O-labeled Chl d was detected at 24 h before decreasing at 48 h (Fig. 5B). This isotopic 18O labeling pattern followed inversely the 18O incorporation into Chl a, suggesting that unlabeled Chl a was the precursor of single isotopic 18O-labeled Chl d. The decrease in isotopic 18O labeling at later time points is most likely due to dilution of the 18O2 gas with 16O2 gas released from H216O by photosynthesis in this time period. Chlorophyll d has six oxygen atoms including the additional oxygen atom of the C31-formyl group (Fig. 1). The H218O labeling experiment demonstrated that the four oxygen atoms of the two carboxyl groups at C133 and C173 positions of Chl d originated from water, similar to Chl a, which would be expected if Chl a is the precursor of Chl d. The incorporation of two 18O atoms into newly synthesized Chl d in the 18O2 labeling experiment indicated that the C31-formyl group and the C131-oxo group oxygen atoms of Chl d were derived through an oxygenase-type reaction mechanism. Chlorophyll d has a formyl group at the C31 position of ring A in contrast to the C31-vinyl group of Chl a (Fig. 1). Because of the similarity of the side chains of Chl d and BChl a at the C3 position of ring A (both contain an oxygen atom at the C3 of ring A) and the far-red light shifted absorption properties of Chl d, it was thought that Chl d could be an evolutionary intermediate between BChl a and Chl a (4Hu Q. Miyashita H. Iwasaki I. Kurano N. Miyachi S. Iwaki M. Itoh S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1998; 95: 13319-13323Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar, 22Blankenship R.E. Hartman H. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1998; 23: 94-97Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar). The oxygen atom of the C3-acetyl group of BChl a is derived from water, and a similar reaction mechanism could be responsible for the incorporation of the oxygen atom into the C31-formyl group of Chl d (15Porra R.J. Schäfer W. Katheder I. Scheer H. FEBS Lett. 1995; 371: 21-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 17Porra R.J. Urzinger M. Winkler J. Bubenzer C. Scheer H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1998; 257: 185-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Conversely, the oxygen atom of the C71-formyl group of Chl b had its origin from molecular oxygen (O2), which led to our initial hypotheses that either an oxygenase-type or a hydratase-type reaction mechanism is responsible for the incorporation of the C31-formyl group oxygen atom into Chl d (12Porra R.J. Schäfer W. Cmiel E. Katheder I. Scheer H. FEBS Lett. 1993; 323: 31-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Acaryochloris cells incubated in the H218O-containing culture medium displayed an increase from 20 to 60% in incorporation of isotopic 18O label into Chl d from 48 to 120 h. In the same time the unlabeled Chl d decreased from 80 to 40% (Fig. 4B). The lag phase (48 h) in the incorporation of 18O label from H218O into Chl d can be explained with the proposed model of Chl d biosynthesis in Acaryochloris if the cultural doubling time is ∼48 h. Oxygen atoms originating from water are incorporated into the C133 and C173-carboxyl groups of the tetrapyrrole molecule in the first steps of the long Chl biosynthetic pathway (15Porra R.J. Schäfer W. Katheder I. Scheer H. FEBS Lett. 1995; 371: 21-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 16Porra R.J. Schäfer W. Gad'on N. Katheder I. Drews G. Scheer H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 239: 85-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 17Porra R.J. Urzinger M. Winkler J. Bubenzer C. Scheer H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1998; 257: 185-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Prior to observing isotopic 18O-labeled Chl d in these H218O labeling experiments, all unlabeled intermediates of the Chl biosynthetic pathway are metabolized into (unlabeled) Chl a and then into (unlabeled) Chl d. After 48 h of incubation time, almost all Chl a of Acaryochloris was isotopic 18O-labeled because of the low Chl a/d ratio (0.03–0.05:1), resulting in a high turnover of Chl a as a precursor of Chl d (Fig. 4A). A doubling time of ∼48 h for cells cultured under white light (30 μm photons m−2 s−1) is confirmed through reported Acaryochloris doubling times of 45–65 h under comparable light intensities (29Gloag R.S. Ritchie R.J. Chen M. Larkum A.W. Quinnell R.G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2007; 1767: 127-135Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). The C131-oxo group and the C31-formyl group oxygen atoms of Chl d originate from molecular dioxygen (O2) and are incorporated into the Chl macrocycle in the last steps of the Chl biosynthetic pathway. Therefore, the incorporation of single isotopic 18O (at C131-oxo group) originating from 18O2 into Chl d occurred earlier in the time course experiments than the incorporation of 18O label originating from H218O. Double isotopic 18O labeled Chl d was increased from 14 to 29% in 24 h (from 24 to 48 h) equating to a doubling time of ∼65 h (Fig. 5B). The slower growth rate compared with the H218O cultures may be attributed to self-shading effects in the 25 times larger culture volume given that Acaryochloris replicates slower under lower light intensities (29Gloag R.S. Ritchie R.J. Chen M. Larkum A.W. Quinnell R.G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2007; 1767: 127-135Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). The incorporation of isotopic 18O label into Chl a from 18O2 gas was not as high as from ASW-KES H218O medium. This may be due to the fact that the incorporation of isotopic 18O label was in competition with 16O2 gas produced by oxygenic photosynthesis that accumulated in the growth chamber. The calculated 18O2/16O2 gas ratio in the growth chamber after 5 days of incubation time was ∼2.5:1, if it is assumed that the O2 evolution rate of slow growing Acaryochloris cells was ∼100 μmol O2 h−1 (mg Chl)−1 at standard laboratory conditions and that the growth chamber had an initial concentration of 50% 18O2, 50% N2. This estimated 18O2/16O2 gas ratio was confirmed through gas chromatography mass spectrometry analysis of the gas mixture in the flask during the experiment (data not shown). Our results indicate that the incorporation of the oxygen atom into the C31-formyl group of Chl d is facilitated via an oxygenase-type reaction mechanism and furthermore pinpoints Chl a as the direct precursor in Chl d biosynthesis. The Acaryochloris genome contains all of the enzyme-encoding genes that are required in the Chl a biosynthetic pathway, which additionally supports our results (10Swingley W.D. Chen M. Cheung P.C.

It was suggested that Chl d could be produced by a member of the aromatic ring degradation protein superfamily, which also includes the potential chlorophyll a mono-oxygenase enzyme (10Swingley W.D.

On the basis of the data presented here, it seems now ever more likely that a putative Chl d synthase protein belongs to this family. Chlorophyll a is a minor chlorophyll in Acaryochloris (> 5%), and its function has been debated since the discovery of this unique organism. Although it was soon established that Chl a was not a prerequisite for functional photochemistry in the reaction centers of photosystem (PS) I of Acaryochloris, there are still disagreements regarding the role of Chl a in the reaction centers of PS II (4Hu Q.

This work points out that Chl d is synthesized from Chl a in a reaction mechanism similar to the biosynthesis of Chl b from Chl a. Although it is important to note that Chl b is only an accessory pigment with Chl a being the major photopigment in photosynthetic reactions. Furthermore, it suggests that the degradation of Chl d could occur in analogy to the Chl b degradation reaction as well, i.e. that Chl d is broken down via Chl a and pheophytin (Pheo) a. Pheophytin a was previously identified as the primary electron acceptor of PS II in Acaryochloris (5Chen M. Telfer A. Lin S. Pascal A. Larkum A.W. Barber J. Blankenship R.E. Photochem. Photobiol.

Therefore, it is conceivable that the role of Chl a in Acaryochloris is merely that of an intermediate product in the biosynthesis and degradation reactions of Chl d without any potential involvement in the photochemistry. It also suggests Chl a as a possible precursor for Pheo a in Acaryochloris. This strengthens the role of Chl a as the central Chl in oxygenic photosynthesis with Chl b and d having evolved from it (32Chew A.G. Bryant D.A. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 2007; 61: 113-129Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). The red-shifted Qy absorption maximum (696 nm in methanol; Fig. 1) of Chl d (over 30 nm red-shifted from Chl a) and its very high percentage of total Chls (∼95%) are the most striking characteristics of Chl d. Additionally, Acaryochloris exhibits the lowest Chl a content of all aerobic photosynthetic organisms known to date. Containing Chl d as the major photopigment, it would be expected to find Pheo d in significant quantities if it is an intermediate product of major photopigment Chl d. Actually, no Pheo d is detectable in Acaryochloris, which suggests that Pheo d is not involved in photosynthetic reactions of Acaryochloris (33Akiyama M. Miyashita H. Kise H. Watanabe T. Miyachi S. Kobayashi M. Anal. Sci. 2001; 17: 205-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Furthermore, it supports our hypothesis that Chl d in Acaryochloris is broken down via Chl a. Taken together these results sustain our hypothesis that Chl d is biosynthesized from Chl a. However, it is uncertain yet whether a one-step reaction or a two-step reaction is responsible for the conversion of the C31-vinyl group in Chl a to the formyl group in Chl d. The results of this study revealed the origins of all six oxygen atoms of Chl d. The revelation that the C31-formyl group oxygen atom of Chl d is incorporated via an oxygenase-type reaction mechanism suggests that genes encoding radical S-adenosylmethionine (SAM) superfamily enzymes should be excluded from the list of putative candidate genes for Chl d biosynthesis (10Swingley W.D.

https://openalex.org/W1997614150,"Previous studies have demonstrated that factor VIII (FVIII) or platelets alone increase cleavage of von Willebrand factor (VWF) by ADAMTS13 under mechanically induced shear stresses. We show in this study that the combination of FVIII and platelets at the physiological concentrations is more effective than either one alone. In the absence of FVIII, lyophilized platelets increase the formation of cleavage product by 2-3-fold. However, in the presence of physiological concentration of FVIII (1 nm), the formation of VWF cleavage product increases dramatically as a function of increasing platelets with the maximal rate enhancement of approximately 8-fold. Conversely, in the presence of a physiological concentration of lyophilized platelets (150 x 10(3)/microl), the half-maximal concentration of FVIII required to accelerate VWF proteolysis by ADAMTS13 reduces by approximately 10-fold (to approximately 0.3 nm) compared with that in the absence of platelets ( approximately 3.0 nm). Further studies using the FVIII derivative that lacks an acidic region (a3), an antiplatelet glycoprotein 1balpha IgG, and a purified recombinant VWF-A1 domain or glycoprotein 1balpha-stripped platelets demonstrate that the synergistic rate-enhancing effect of FVIII and platelets depends on their specific binding interactions with VWF. Our findings suggest that FVIII and platelets are cofactors that regulate proteolysis of multimeric VWF by ADAMTS13 under physiological conditions."
https://openalex.org/W2003055105,"Mammalian mitochondrial mRNAs are basically leaderless, having few or no untranslated nucleotides prior to the 5′-start codon. We demonstrate here that mammalian mitochondrial 55 S ribosomes preferentially form initiation complexes at a 5′-terminal AUG codon over an internal AUG. The preferential use of the 5′-start codon is also seen on mitochondrial 28 S small subunits, which suggests that mitochondrial translation initiation on leaderless mRNAs does not require the large ribosomal subunit. The selection of the 5′-AUG is dependent on the presence of fMet-tRNA and is enhanced by the presence of the mitochondrial initiation factor IF2mt. In prokaryotes, IF3 is believed to antagonize initiation on leaderless mRNAs. However, IF3mt stimulates initiation complex formation on leaderless mRNAs when tested with 55 S ribosomes. The addition of even a few nucleotides 5′ to the AUG codon significantly reduces the efficiency of initiation, highlighting the importance of the leaderless or nearly leaderless nature of mitochondrial mRNAs. In addition, very few initiation complexes could form on a hybrid mRNA construct consisting of tRNAMet attached at the 5′-end of a mitochondrial protein-coding sequence.

Ankyrins are multivalent adapter proteins required for the proper membrane expression of ion channels, transporters, cell adhesion molecules, and structural and signaling molecules in excitable and non-excitable cells (1Bennett V. Baines A.J. Physiol. Rev. 2001; 81: 1353-1392Crossref PubMed Scopus (791) Google Scholar). Three genes (ANK1, ANK2, and ANK3) encode a host of structurally similar but functionally distinct ankyrin polypeptides (ankyrin-R, ankyrin-B, and ankyrin-G, respectively) with specific roles in erythrocyte membrane structure, cardiac excitability, polarized epithelial ion regulation, and neuronal development. In heart, ankyrins regulate membrane excitability by coordinating the expression of voltage-gated Na+ and Ca2+ channels, cytoskeletal elements, key membrane transporters and pumps, and signaling proteins (2Mohler P.J.

The importance of cardiac ankyrins for normal physiology is demonstrated by human disease associated with dysfunction in ankyrin-based pathways.

Unfortunately, despite the link between ankyrin-B and cardiac disease, we still lack fundamental information regarding the identity of the cast of ankyrin-B protein partners in vivo and the potential role of ankyrin-B in the regulation of membrane-binding partners. Here, we define a new role of ankyrin-B in cardiovascular cell biology by demonstrating a role for ankyrin-B in KATP channel regulation. Ankyrin-B associates with the cardiac KATP channel via Kir6.2, a key component of the cellular machinery required for intrinsic cardioprotection from ischemia. Hearts and isolated cardiomyocytes lacking ankyrin-B display loss of Kir6.2 membrane expression and decreased membrane IKATP. Moreover, we demonstrate that ankyrin-B regulates cardiac KATP channel gating. Finally, we demonstrate that ankyrin-B coordinates a complex of the KATP channel and Na/K-ATPase. Together, these data define new roles for ankyrin-B in cardiac membrane protein expression, identify a new in vivo membrane partner for ankyrin-B in heart, and define potential new roles for ankyrin-B in regulating cardiac function in health and disease. Moreover, these new data, combined with recent findings linking ankyrin-B with Kir6.2 membrane expression in pancreatic beta cells (14Kline C.F. Kurata H.T. Hund T.J. Cunha S.R. Koval O.M.

Mice were killed after deep anesthesia with 2.5% Avertin at a dose of 0.2 ml/10 g (10 g of tribromoethanol alcohol + 10 ml of tert-amyl alcohol with the addition of 1 mg/ml heparin (187 USP units/mg). Ventricular myocytes were isolated from Langendorff-perfused hearts not subjected to ischemia, as described previously (15Li J. Marionneau C. Koval O. Zingman L. Mohler P.J. Nerbonne J.M. Anderson M.E. Channels. 2007; 1: 387-394Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). IKATP from ventricular myocytes was recorded with inside-out patch-clamp configuration of the patch-clamp technique using an Axopatch-200B amplifier (Axon Instruments, Foster City, CA), monitored, and stored using a pCLAMP 10 data acquisition system (Molecular Devices, Inc., Sunnyvale, CA) (15Li J. Marionneau C. Koval O. Zingman L. Mohler P.J. Nerbonne J.M. Anderson M.E. Channels. 2007; 1: 387-394Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Tip resistance was 1.5–3 megohms when pipettes were filled with intracellular solution, and series resistance compensation was routinely set at >85% in all experiments. All recordings were obtained at room temperature (23–25 °C). The standard bath (intracellular) and pipette (extracellular) solution used in patch-clamp experiments was 140 mm KCl, 10 mm K+-HEPES, and 10 mm K+-EGTA (pH 7.3) with KOH. IKATP was evoked by a membrane potential of −50 mV (pipette potential of +50 mV) at six different concentrations of ATP: 0, 10, 25, 50, 100, and 1000 μm. Data were filtered at 5 kHz. Off-line analysis was performed using Clampfit and Microsoft Excel programs. The steady-state dependence of membrane current on [ATP] was obtained by calculating the relative current indexed to zero ATP (Irel). The data were fitted using the Hill equation: Irel = 100/(1 + ([ATP]/K50)H, where Irel is the relative current, K50 is the concentration causing half-maximal blockade, and H is the Hill coefficient. Single-channel IKATP recordings were obtained from inside-out patches using fire-polished pipettes (resistance of ∼9–12 megohms) when filled with pipette solution containing 140 mm KCl, 1 mm CaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2, and 5 mm HEPES-KOH (pH 7.3). Cardiac cells were superfused with intracellular solution containing 140 mm KCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 5 mm EGTA, and 5 mm HEPES-KOH (pH 7.3) in the absence or presence of ATP, and recordings were made at room temperature (23–25 °C) as described (15Li J. Marionneau C. Koval O. Zingman L. Mohler P.J. Nerbonne J.M. Anderson M.E. Channels. 2007; 1: 387-394Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Single-channel recordings in the inside-out configuration were measured at a holding potential of +60 mV. The signal was low pass-filtered at 1 kHz and sampled every 50 ms. The threshold for judging the open state of KATP channels was set at half of the single-channel amplitude. nPo, where n represents the number of channels in the patch and Po the probability of each channel to open, was assessed using Clampfit 10 software. Mice were age-matched wild-type and ankyrin-B+/− male littermates. Ankyrin-B+/− mice were generated by backcrossing at least 20 generations (99.8% pure) into the C57Bl/6 background (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories). Both wild-type and ankyrin-B+/− mice were housed in the same facility, consumed the same diet, were provided water ad libitum, and were kept on identical 12-h light/dark cycles. For immunoblotting and co-immunoprecipitation analysis, heart tissues were flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen and ground into a fine powder. The powder was resuspended in 3 volumes of ice-cold homogenization buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.35), 10 mm NaCl, 0.32 m sucrose, 5 mm EDTA, 2.5 mm EGTA, 1 mm PMSF, 1 mm 4-(2-aminoethyl)benzenesulfonyl fluoride hydrochloride, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, and 10 μg/ml pepstatin) and homogenized. The homogenate was centrifuged at 1000 × g at 4 °C to remove nuclei. Triton X-100 and deoxycholate were added to the post-nuclear supernatant for final concentrations of 1.5% Triton X-100 and 0.75% deoxycholate. The lysate was pelleted at 100,000 × g for 1 h at 4 °C. The resulting supernatant was quantitated by BCA assay prior to analysis. The following primary antibodies were used for immunoblotting protocols and/or immunofluorescent staining: anti-ankyrin-B (polyclonal and monoclonal), anti-ankyrin-G (polyclonal), anti-Kir6.2 and anti-Kir6.1 (Alomone), anti-SUR1 and anti-SUR2A (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), anti-NHERF1 (polyclonal), anti-NCX1 (RDI), anti-Na/K-ATPase (Upstate), anti-SERCA2 (polyclonal), anti-Cav1.2 (polyclonal), and anti-Nav1.5 (polyclonal). Protein A-conjugated agarose beads (Rockland Immunochemicals, Inc.) were incubated with either control IgG or affinity-purified anti-ankyrin-B, anti-Kir6.2, anti-NCX1, or anti-Na/K-ATPase antibody in co-immunoprecipitation binding buffer (PBS with 0.1% Triton X-100 and protease inhibitor mixture (Sigma)) for 12 h at 4 °C. Beads were centrifuged and washed three times with ice-cold PBS. 100 μg of wild-type heart lysate or 200 μg of ankyrin-B+/− heart lysate was added to the washed beads, along with protease inhibitor mixture and co-immunoprecipitation binding buffer, and incubated for 12 h at 4 °C. The reactions were washed three times with ice-cold co-immunoprecipitation buffer. The samples were eluted, and the proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE prior to immunoblotting. A biotinylated Kir6.2 oligopeptide (GQRFVPIVAEEDGR; Biosynthesis, Inc.) was constructed with an SGSG linker between the biotin and Kir6.2 peptide sequence. Additionally, a biotinylated Kir6.1 oligopeptide (analogous to the Kir6.2 oligopeptide sequence; GHRFVSIVTEEEGV; Biosynthesis, Inc.) was constructed with an SGSG linker between the biotin and Kir6.1 peptide sequence. 20 μg of oligopeptide was conjugated to a 40-μl bead volume of streptavidin beads (Thermo Scientific) for 4 h at 4 °C in binding buffer (PBS, 1% Triton X-100, and protease inhibitor mixture). The beads were centrifuged and washed three times with binding buffer, and 100 μg of freshly prepared wild-type heart lysate was added to the washed beads, along with 500 μl of binding buffer and protease inhibitors. The reactions were incubated overnight at 4 °C and then centrifuged and washed three times with binding buffer prior to elution, SDS-PAGE, and immunoblotting with anti-ankyrin-B Ig. HEK293 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% FBS (HyClone) and 0.1% penicillin/streptomycin. Cells were cultured at 37 °C in 5% CO2. Human Kir6.2 (KCNJ11; NP_000516) and human SUR1 (ABCC8; NP_000343.2) were cloned from the GAL4 human cardiac cDNA library (Clontech) and subcloned into pcDNA3.1+ (Invitrogen). Human SUR2A (ABCC9; NP_005682.2) in pcDNA3.1+ was a generous gift from Dr. Leonid Zingman (University of Iowa). All constructs were thoroughly sequenced prior to experimentation. Cultured cells were split 24 h prior to transfection (30% confluence at time of transfection). Effectene reagent (Qiagen) was used to transfect cells with 0.2 μg of Kir6.2 pcDNA3.1+ with or without 0.2 μg of SUR1 pcDNA3.1+ and/or 0.2 μg of SUR2A pcDNA3.1+ following the manufacturer's instructions.

After 48 h, the cells were lysed and centrifuged at high speed to remove debris, and the supernatant was used in subsequent co-immunoprecipitation and immunoblotting experiments. Adult ventricular cardiomyocytes were stained according to the protocol described by Morrissey et al. (19Morrissey A. Rosner E. Lanning J. Parachuru L. Dhar Chowdhury P. Han S. Lopez G. Tong X.

Briefly, single dissociated myocytes were plated onto fibronectin-coated MatTek plates and incubated at 37 °C for 15 min to allow attachment before fixation. Myocytes were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 15 min at room temperature, followed by permeabilization with ice-cold 100% methanol at −20 °C for 5 min. Myocytes were then washed with Ca2+- and Mg2+-free PBS. Washed myocytes were incubated with 0.1% Triton X-100 (in PBS) for 15 min at room temperature, followed by washing (2× 5 min) with room temperature PBS and blocking (2× 10 min) with 5% fetal bovine serum in PBS. The cells were incubated with primary antibody (1 h at room temperature), washed (3× 10 min in PBS serum), and incubated with secondary antibodies (45 min at room temperature). Following washing (4× 10 min) with PBS, the cells were mounted with VECTASHIELD and covered with No. 1 glass coverslips. 10 μg of AnkB 3The abbreviations used are: AnkBankyrin-BMBDmembrane-binding domainSBDspectrin-binding domainCTDC-terminal domain.

Data are presented as the mean ± S.E., and statistical significance was estimated using Student's t test or analysis of variance, as appropriate (SigmaStat). Post hoc comparisons after analysis of variance were performed using the Holm-Sidak test. The null hypothesis was rejected for p ≤ 0.05. The ATP-sensitive potassium channel (KATP) is one of several ion channels and pumps linked with the heart's response to ischemia (20Suzuki M. Sasaki N. Miki T. Sakamoto N. Ohmoto-Sekine Y.

Notably, this channel complex has previously been associated with ankyrin in pancreatic beta cells (14Kline C.F. Kurata H.T. Hund T.J. Cunha S.R. Koval O.M. Wright P.J. Christensen M. Anderson M.E. Nichols C.G. Mohler P.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2009; 106: 16669-16674Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). We investigated KATP channel subunit expression in ankyrin-B+/− mouse heart lysates by immunoblotting. We first evaluated cardiac KATP channel α-subunit (Kir6.1 and Kir6.2) and β-subunit (SUR1 and SUR2A) expression. We observed decreased Kir6.2 expression in ankyrin-B+/− ventricular tissue compared with wild-type littermate hearts (∼46% decrease; n = 4; p < 0.01) (Fig. 1B). Notably, we also observed a parallel decrease in the expression of both KATP channel β-subunits, SUR1 and SUR2A (51 and 47% decreases, respectively; n = 4; p < 0.01) in ankyrin-B+/− ventricle (Fig. 1, C and D). Although present in mouse ventricle, Kir6.1 was not altered by ankyrin-B deficiency (not significant; n = 4) (Fig. 1F). As expected, ankyrin-B expression was significantly reduced in ankyrin-B+/− whole heart lysates (57% decrease; n = 4; p < 0.001) (Fig. 1A), whereas the expression levels of the related ankyrin gene product, ankyrin-G, and NHERF1 (loading control) were unchanged (not significant; n = 4) (Fig. 1, E and G). Consistent with previous findings (6Mohler P.J. Schott J.J. Gramolini A.O. Dilly K.W. Guatimosim S. duBell W.H. Song L.S. Haurogné K. Kyndt F. Ali M.E. Rogers T.B. Lederer W.J. Escande D. Le Marec H. Bennett V. Nature. 2003; 421: 634-639Crossref PubMed Scopus (835) Google Scholar), NCX (Na2+/Ca2+ exchanger) and Na/K-ATPase expression levels were reduced in ankyrin-B+/− ventricle (n = 4; p < 0.05) (Fig. 1, H and I). Considering that Kir6.2 protein expression was significantly reduced in ankyrin-B+/− heart with no difference in mRNA levels of KCNJ11 (data not shown), we evaluated the ability of ankyrin-B to associate with Kir6.2 in heart. Co-immunoprecipitation analysis using detergent-soluble lysates from adult mouse left ventricle revealed that affinity-purified anti-ankyrin-B Ig co-immunoprecipitated Kir6.2 from heart lysate (Fig. 2A). Conversely, anti-Kir6.2 Ig co-immunoprecipitated ankyrin-B from detergent-soluble lysates (Fig. 2B). We observed no interaction between ankyrin-B or Kir6.2 and control Ig (Fig. 2, A and B). Moreover, we observed no interaction of Kir6.1 with ankyrin-B using an identical assay (Fig. 2, C and D). These data support an in vivo interaction between ankyrin-B and Kir6.2, but not Kir6.1, in heart. We further evaluated the cardiac ankyrin-B/Kir6.2 interaction using pulldown experiments with mouse detergent-soluble heart lysates. Ankyrin-B is composed of three structural domains: MBD, SBD, and CTD (22Cunha S.R. Mohler P.J. Cardiovasc. Res. 2006; 71: 22-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Notably, purified GST-AnkB MBD, but not GST-AnkB SBD or GST-AnkB CTD, interacted with Kir6.2 from cardiac lysates (Fig. 2E). This interaction was specific for ankyrin-B versus ankyrin-G, as purified GST-AnkG MBD (74% identical to AnkB MBD at the amino acid level) lacked Kir6.2 binding activity (Fig. 2E). Conversely, identical assays demonstrated that AnkB MBD-GST was unable to associate with Kir6.1 from detergent-soluble heart lysates (Fig. 2F). Thus, cardiac ankyrin-B associates with Kir6.2 via its MBD, and this interaction is specific for ankyrin-B versus ankyrin-G. Finally, we tested the requirements of Kir6.2 for cardiac ankyrin-B binding. Our group previously identified an 8-amino acid motif in the C-terminal domain of Kir6.2 necessary for ankyrin-B association in pancreas (14Kline C.F. Kurata H.T. Hund T.J. Cunha S.R. Koval O.M. Wright P.J. Christensen M. Anderson M.E. Nichols C.G. Mohler P.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2009; 106: 16669-16674Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). A biotinylated version of this peptide was used to evaluate the ability to pull down ankyrin-B from heart lysate. As demonstrated in Fig. 2G, this peptide interacted with ankyrin-B from heart lysate, with no appreciable pulldown in the control reaction (streptavidin beads alone) (Fig. 2G). Likewise, the corresponding peptide from Kir6.1 was unable to pull down ankyrin-B from detergent-soluble heart lysates (Fig. 2H). Collectively, these findings support an interaction between cardiac ankyrin-B and the α-subunit Kir6.2 of the cardiac KATP channel complex. Interactions between Kir6.2 and KATP channel SUR subunits regulate KATP channel function (23Wheeler A. Wang C. Yang K. Fang K. Davis K. Styer A.M. Mirshahi U. Moreau C. Revilloud J. Vivaudou M. Liu S. Mirshahi T. Chan K.W. Mol. Pharmacol. 2008; 74: 1333-1344Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). In fact, mice harboring mutant KATP α- and β-subunits in which this association is affected display significant dysfunction (24Proks P. Girard C. Baevre H. Njølstad P.R. Ashcroft F.M. Diabetes. 2006; 55: 1731-1737Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 25Tammaro P. Girard C. Molnes J. Njølstad P.R. Ashcroft F.M. EMBO J. 2005; 24: 2318-2330Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 26Tammaro P. Proks P. Ashcroft F.M. J. Physiol. 2006; 571: 3-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). To determine whether association with ankyrin-B affects association of Kir6.2 with SUR β-subunits, HEK293 cells (which express endogenous ankyrin-B but lack Kir6.2, SUR1, and SUR2A) were transfected with Kir6.2 cDNA in the presence or absence of SUR1 or SUR2A. As expected, anti-Kir6.2 Ig co-immunoprecipitated both SUR1 and SUR2A from cotransfected cells (Fig. 3A). Likewise, anti-ankyrin-B Ig co-immunoprecipitated Kir6.2 in all cells with Kir6.2 cDNA (Fig. 3B). Notably, Kir6.2 also co-immunoprecipitated ankyrin-B with SUR1 and SUR2A (Fig. 3A), demonstrating the presence of a ternary complex between these proteins in heterologous cells. Additionally, these data suggest that the interaction of Kir6.2 with ankyrin-B does not block the association of either SUR β-subunit with Kir6.2. Importantly, despite the reduced levels of SUR1 and SUR2A in ankyrin-B+/− cardiac lysates, we did not observe an association of SUR1 or SUR2A with ankyrin-B in transfected cells lacking Kir6.2 expression (Fig. 3, A and B). Collectively, these data demonstrate the presence of a ternary complex of ankyrin-B with Kir6.2 and SUR1/SUR2A. Furthermore, these new data demonstrate that this ternary complex is mediated by both ankyrin-B and SUR β-subunit interactions with Kir6.2. On the basis of reduced Kir6.2 expression in ankyrin-B+/− heart, we evaluated the role of ankyrin-B deficiency in Kir6.2 expression in single isolated cardiomyocytes. Consistent with previous findings (19Morrissey A. Rosner E. Lanning J. Parachuru L. Dhar Chowdhury P. Han S. Lopez G. Tong X. Yoshida H. Nakamura T.Y. Artman M. Giblin J.P. Tinker A. Coetzee W.A. BMC Physiol. 2005; 5: 1Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar), Kir6.2 was localized primarily to the transverse tubule network of isolated adult mouse cardiomyocytes (Fig. 4A). Loss of ankyrin-B resulted in decreased levels of Kir6.2 immunostaining throughout the cardiomyocyte and particularly across the transverse tubule network (Fig. 4B). Thus, loss of Kir6.2 by immunoblotting (Fig. 1B) was paralleled by decreased Kir6.2 immunostaining in primary ankyrin-B+/− isolated cardiomyocytes (Fig. 4B). Although ankyrin-B has previously been shown to affect the membrane localization of NCX and Na/K-ATPase, ankyrin-B loss did not affect the localization of other critical cardiac ion channels and transporters, including Cav1.2, Nav1.5, and SERCA (6Mohler P.J. Schott J.J. Gramolini A.O. Dilly K.W. Guatimosim S. duBell W.H. Song L.S. Haurogné K. Kyndt F. Ali M.E. Rogers T.B. Lederer W.J. Escande D. Le Marec H. Bennett V.

We performed functional electrophysiological analysis of KATP channel function to quantitatively evaluate the effects of ankyrin-B on Kir6.2 membrane expression in heart. IKATP was analyzed in excised membrane patches from wild-type and ankyrin-B+/− cardiomyocytes at 0 μm ATP to promote opening of all membrane-bound KATP channels (current inhibited by ATP). In agreement with immunoblotting and immunostaining results, we observed a nearly 50% decrease in membrane IKATP density in ankyrin-B+/− cardiomyocytes compared with wild-type myocytes (Fig. 4C). In summary, ankyrin-B directly associates with Kir6.2 and is necessary for normal Kir6.2 membrane expression in cardiomyocytes. We next analyzed the role of ankyrin-B in cardiac IKATP membrane regulation. Notably, we observed differences in IKATP ATP sensitivity in ankyrin-B+/− cardiomyocytes. Specifically, IKATP (analyzed in excised inside-out membrane patches) in ankyrin-B+/− myocytes was less sensitive to inhibitory ATP compared with wild-type myocytes (K50 ([ATP] causing half-maximal inhibition) = 24.38 μm for WT and 41.47 μm for ankyrin-B+/−; p < 0.01) (Fig. 5, A–D). The slope index was equivalent between cardiomyocyte genotypes (p > 0.05) (Fig. 5E). Finally, we measured the single-channel open probability of KATP channels from WT and ankyrin-B+/− mouse cardiomyocytes. In the absence of ATP, we observed a significant difference between Po in ankyrin-B+/− cardiomyocytes compared with WT cardiomyocytes (0.62 ± 0.03 and 0.48 ± 0.05, respectively; n = 10; p < 0.05) (Fig. 6, A–C). This increased Po in ankyrin-B+/− cardiomyocytes may represent a compensatory response for the decreased IKATP. Thus, our collective data demonstrate that loss of ankyrin-B significantly reduces the membrane localization of KATP channels and alters the regulation of residual membrane KATP channels. In heart and other tissues, KATP channel function has been tightly linked with the activity of the Na/K-ATPase (27Haruna T. Horie M. Kouchi I. Nawada R. Tsuchiya K. Akao M. Otani H. Murakami T.

Pharmacol. 2004; 143: 872-880Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Notably, work from our group and others has demonstrated direct high affinity interaction of ankyrin with Na/K-ATPase (ankyrin-B in heart) and loss of membrane Na/K-ATPase in ankyrin-deficient cells (9Mohler P.J. Davis J.Q. Bennett V. PLoS Biol. 2005; 3: e423Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar, 29Lencesova L. O'Neill A. Resneck W.G. Bloch R.J. Blaustein M.P. J. Biol.

Given our new data demonstrating that ankyrin-B associates with Kir6.2 in heart, as well as previous evidence that both ankyrin-B and ankyrin-R can form heterocomplexes between two ankyrin-binding proteins (9Mohler P.J. Davis J.Q. Bennett V. PLoS Biol. 2005; 3: e423Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar, 32Michaely P. Bennett V. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 31298-31302Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar), we tested whether ankyrin-B could form a multiprotein complex of Na/K-ATPase and Kir6.2 in heart. To test this complex, we conducted a series of co-immunoprecipitation experiments using detergent-soluble lysates of adult mouse heart. Anti-ankyrin-B Ig co-immunoprecipitated Na/K-ATPase and Kir6.2, as well as cardiac NCX (also ankyrin-B partner (33Cunha S.R. Bhasin N. Mohler P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 4875-4883Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar)) (Fig. 7A). Anti-Na/K-ATPase Ig co-immunoprecipitated ankyrin-B, NCX, and Kir6.2 (Fig. 7C). Moreover, anti-Kir6.2 Ig co-immunoprecipitated ankyrin-B, Na/K-ATPase, and NCX from heart lysates (Fig. 7B). Finally, anti-NCX Ig co-immunoprecipitated 220-kDa ankyrin-B, Na/K-ATPase, and Kir6.2 (Fig. 7D). Notably, consistent with previous studies, we did not observe association of ankyrin-B-targeted proteins with other cardiac membrane or structural proteins, including Cav1.2, Nav1.5, and SERCA2 (Fig. 7, E and F). These mutual co-immunoprecipitations provide evidence for a macromolecular complex in heart containing ankyrin-B associated with Na/K-ATPase, Kir6.2, and NCX. We further examined whether ankyrin-B is required for mutual co-immunoprecipitation of NCX, Na/K-ATPase, and Kir6.2 by comparing wild-type and ankyrin-B+/− hearts (deficient in ankyrin-B) (see Fig. 2A). Ankyrin-B+/− hearts expressed reduced levels of 220-kDa ankyrin-B, Na/K-ATPase, NCX, and Kir6.2 (Fig. 1). Strikingly, ankyrin-B+/− heart lysates exhibited >70% loss in the ability of anti-ankyrin-B Ig to co-immunoprecipitate Kir6.2, Na/K-ATPase, and NCX, even when the quantity of lysate was increased (doubled in these experiments) to equalize the starting amount of wild-type ankyrin-B levels (Fig. 7A). Moreover, a similar reduction in NCX co-immunoprecipitation of Na/K-ATPase and Kir6.2 occurred using doubled ankyrin-B+/− lysates (Fig. 7D). Na/K-ATPase also failed to associate with a significant fraction of NCX or Kir6.2 from ankyrin-B+/− doubled lysates (Fig. 7C). Finally, anti-Kir6.2 Ig immunoprecipitated minimal levels of Na/K-ATPase and NCX from ankyrin-B+/− doubled lysates (Fig. 7B). These data suggest that a specialized population of ankyrin-B, which is decreased in the ankyrin-B+/− mouse heart, is essential for ankyrin-B interactions with Na/K-ATPase, NCX, and Kir6.2. Our new findings demonstrate a role for ankyrin-B in Kir6.2 membrane expression and regulation in heart. KATP channels have now been recognized to serve a cardioprotective role in ischemia via a KATP channel-mediated shortening of the cardiac action potential (34Suzuki M. Li R.A. Miki T. Uemura H.

Notably, acute global ischemia has a greater negative impact on heart function in Kir6.2 knock-out animals compared with wild-type animals (reviewed in Refs. 35Kane G.C. Liu X.K. Yamada S. Olson T.M.

Ankyrin-B has previously been identified as a critical component required for cardiac Na/K-ATPase membrane expression (6Mohler P.J. Schott J.J. Gramolini A.O. Dilly K.W. Guatimosim S. duBell W.H. Song L.S. Haurogné K. Kyndt F. Ali M.E. Rogers T.B. Lederer W.J. Escande D. Le Marec H. Bennett V. Nature. 2003; 421: 634-639Crossref PubMed Scopus (835) Google Scholar, 7Mohler P.J. Splawski I.

Davis J.Q. Bennett V. PLoS Biol. 2005; 3: e423Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). Numerous studies have demonstrated a role for Na/K-ATPase in the heart's response to ischemia reperfusion (39Nawada R. Murakami T. Iwase T. Nagai K. Morita Y. Kouchi I. Akao M. Sasayama S. Circulation. 1997; 96: 599-604Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Notably, a functional link between Na/K-ATPase and KATP has also been described (27Haruna T. Horie M. Kouchi I. Nawada R. Tsuchiya K. Akao M. Otani H. Murakami T. Sasayama S. Circulation. 1998; 98: 2905-2910Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Haruna et al. (27Haruna T. Horie M. Kouchi I. Nawada R. Tsuchiya K. Akao M. Otani H. Murakami T. Sasayama S. Circulation. 1998; 98: 2905-2910Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar) demonstrated that a coordinate interaction between the KATP channel and Na/K-ATPase modulates ischemic preconditioning. Here, we have identified a potential molecular link between the KATP channel and Na/K-ATPase. Specifically, we have demonstrated that ankyrin-B regulates Kir6.2 and Na/K-ATPase membrane expression and may directly couple Kir6.2 and Na/K-ATPase in heart. Thus, our new data suggest that ankyrin-B may provide a functional/physical linkage between the sarcolemmal KATP channel and Na/K-ATPase. Our group has recently described a role for ankyrin-B in the membrane expression and metabolic regulation of the KATP channel in pancreatic beta cells (14Kline C.F. Kurata H.T. Hund T.J. Cunha S.R. Koval O.M. Wright P.J. Christensen M. Anderson M.E. Nichols C.G. Mohler P.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2009; 106: 16669-16674Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Whereas pancreatic beta cells express only Kir6.2 and SUR1 subunits, heart expresses Kir6.1, Kir6.2, SUR1, and SUR2A subunits. There has been little published data regarding the mechanisms required for regulating the membrane expression of specific KATP channel populations in heart. Our data suggest that ankyrin-B associates specifically with Kir6.2-containing channels, as ankyrin-B and Kir6.1 do not interact in heart. These data argue that Kir6.1-containing cardiac KATP channels are regulated by an ankyrin-B-independent mechanism. Furthermore, our data suggest that inhibitory gating regulation by ATP of Kir6.2-containing KATP channels is dependent on ankyrin-B. An exciting future direction in the field will be to define additional components of the ankyrin-B·Kir6.2 macromolecular complex in heart. Since 1995, the field has attempted to define the link between KATP channels and the cytoskeleton (40Furukawa T. Yamane T. Terai T. Katayama Y. Hiraoka M.

A cytoskeletal complex was hypothesized based on experiments that demonstrated the strong stimulatory effect of actin-depolymerizing drugs on KATP channel opening (42Brady P.A. Alekseev A.E. Aleksandrova L.A. Gomez L.A. Terzic A. Am. J. Physiol. Heart Circ. Physiol. 1996; 271: H2710-H2716Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Specifically, actin depolymerization activates KATP channels by reducing the sensitivity of KATP channels to ATP-dependent closure (40Furukawa T. Yamane T. Terai T. Katayama Y. Hiraoka M. Pflugers Arch. 1996; 431: 504-512Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar, 41Hibino H. Terzic A. Inanobe A. Horio Y. Kurachi Y. Curr.

Decreased ATP sensitivity implies a pathway of inhibitory signals modulated by the cytoskeleton. Thus, the association of KATP channels with the cytoskeleton modulates ligand-dependent regulation. Because ankyrins scaffold voltage-gated sodium channels, Na/K-ATPase, the anion exchanger, and NCX to the cytoskeleton (22Cunha S.R. Mohler P.J. Cardiovasc. Res. 2006; 71: 22-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar), our data may define the link between the cytoskeleton and KATP channels. Finally, although our data demonstrate a requirement of ankyrin-B for Kir6.2 membrane expression, the specific cellular role(s) of cardiac ankyrin-B remain unclear. Similar to the role of ankyrin-R in the erythrocyte plasma membrane (45Bennett V. J. Cell. Biochem. 1982; 18: 49-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar, 46Bennett V. Annu. Rev.

Alternatively, ankyrin-B may play critical roles in the trafficking and/or membrane retention of Kir6.2 channels to/at the cardiomyocyte plasma membrane. A third option is that ankyrin-B has multiple roles in the active trafficking of Kir6.2 to the plasma membrane, as well as key roles in the retention and stabilization of Kir6.2 in relation to the plasma membrane and cytoskeleton. An important future goal in the field will be to identify the specific cellular roles of ankyrin polypeptides in heart."
https://openalex.org/W2075241280,"Plexins are receptors for axonal guidance molecules semaphorins. We recently reported that the semaphorin 4D (Sema4D) receptor, Plexin-B1, suppresses PI3K signaling through the R-Ras GTPase-activating protein (GAP) activity, inducing growth cone collapse. Phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate level is critically regulated by PI3K and PTEN (phosphatase and tensin homologue deleted chromosome ten). Here we examined the involvement of PTEN in the Plexin-B1-induced repulsive response. Phosphorylation of PTEN at Ser-380 is known to suppress its phosphatase activity. Sema4D induced the dephosphorylation of PTEN at Ser-380 and stimulated PTEN phosphatase activity in hippocampal neurons. Knockdown of endogenous PTEN suppressed the Sema4D-induced growth cone collapse. Phosphorylation mimic PTEN mutant suppressed the Sema4D-induced growth cone collapse, whereas phosphorylation-resistant PTEN mutant by itself induced growth cone collapse. Plexin-B1-induced PTEN dephosphorylation through R-Ras GAP activity and R-Ras GAP activity was by itself sufficient for PTEN dephosphorylation and activation. We also suggested that the Sema4D-induced PTEN dephosphorylation and growth cone collapse were mediated by the inhibition of casein kinase 2 α activity. Thus, we propose that Sema4D/Plexin-B1 promotes the dephosphorylation and activation of PTEN through the R-Ras GAP activity, inducing growth cone collapse.

Cell. 1993; 75: 217-227Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (998) Google Scholar). In addition to the nervous system, they are widely expressed in embryonic and adult tissues and mediate diverse biological processes, such as cardiac and skeletal development (4Behar O. Golden J.A. Mashimo H. Schoen F.J. Fishman M.C. Nature. 1996; 383: 525-528Crossref PubMed Scopus (502) Google Scholar), tumor growth, and metastasis (5Christensen C.R. Klingelhöfer J. Tarabykina S. Hulgaard E.F. Kramerov D. Lukanidin E. Cancer Res. 1998; 58: 1238-1244PubMed Google Scholar), and the immune response (6Kumanogoh A. Kikutani H. J. Cell Sci. 2003; 116: 3463-3470Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). The functions of semaphorins are mediated by plexins, single-pass transmembrane receptors, which are classified into four subfamilies: Plexin-A1 to -4, Plexin-B1 to -3, Plexin-C1, and Plexin-D1 (2Tamagnone L. Artigiani S. Chen H. He Z. Ming G.I. Song H. Chedotal A. Winberg M.L. Goodman C.S. Poo M. Tessier-Lavigne M. Comoglio P.M.

Semaphorins were originally identified as repulsive and attractive axonal guidance molecules, and Sema4D/Plexin-B1 induces axonal growth cone collapse in hippocampal neurons (8Swiercz J.M. Kuner R. Behrens J. Offermanns S. Neuron. 2002; 35: 51-63Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar, 9Barberis D. Artigiani S. Casazza A. Corso S. Giordano S. Love C.A. Jones E.Y. Comoglio P.M. Tamagnone L. FASEB J. 2004; 18: 592-594Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Rho family small GTPases are signal transduction molecules that remodel the actin cytoskeleton and play fundamental roles in numerous cellular processes (10Negishi M. Katoh H. J. Biochem. 2002; 132: 157-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar, 11Etienne-Manneville S. Hall A. Nature. 2002; 420: 629-635Crossref PubMed Scopus (3768) Google Scholar). First, Plexin-B1 has been shown to activate RhoA through the interaction of its intracellular COOH-terminal PSD-95/Dlg/ZO-1 (PDZ) domain-binding motif with PDZ-Rho guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF)/leukemia-associated RhoGEF (LARG) and induce neurite retraction through the RhoA/ROCK signaling pathway (8Swiercz J.M.

Chem. 2002; 277: 43115-43120Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). However, the PDZ domain-binding motif is restricted to the Plexin-B subfamily. Conversely, the cytoplasmic regions are highly conserved among all plexin subfamilies from Caenorhabditis elegans to humans. We previously reported that the small GTPase Rnd1, a constitutively active Rho family GTPase, interacts directly with the cytoplasmic domain of Plexin-B1 (15Oinuma I. Katoh H. Harada A. Negishi M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 25671-25677Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). We further revealed that the cytoplasmic region of Plexin-B1 directly encodes a GTPase-activating protein (GAP) for R-Ras, and Plexin-B1 specifically down-regulates R-Ras activity in response to Sema4D, inducing axonal growth cone collapse in hippocampal neurons, and that the expression of R-Ras GAP activity of Plexin-B1 requires Rnd1 association with the receptor (16Oinuma I. Ishikawa Y. Katoh H. Negishi M. Science. 2004; 305: 862-865Crossref PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar). Furthermore, it has been shown that other plexin subfamilies, including Plexin-A, -C, and -D, also display R-Ras GAP activity, and this activity is required for semaphorin-induced repulsive response, indicating that R-Ras GAP activity is a common signaling activity of the plexin family (17Toyofuku T.

Chem. 2009; 284: 6743-6751Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). In addition, we recently revealed that Plexin-B1 displays a GAP activity for M-Ras, another member of R-Ras subfamily GTPase, remodeling dendrite morphology in cortical neurons (19Saito Y. Oinuma I. Fujimoto S. Negishi M. EMBO Rep. 2009; 10: 614-621Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). semaphorin(s) guanine nucleotide exchange factor GTPase-activating protein leukemia-associated RhoGEF myristoylated day(s) in vitro phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate dipotassium bisperoxo (picolinato) oxovanadate (V). We characterized the downstream signaling of Plexin-B1-mediated R-Ras GAP activity for repulsive response, and we found that Plexin-B1 suppresses the PI3K signaling pathway and dephosphorylates Akt and GSK-3β (glycogen synthase kinase-3β) through R-Ras GAP activity, inducing growth cone collapse (20Ito Y. Oinuma I. Katoh H. Kaibuchi K. Negishi M. EMBO Rep. 2006; 7: 704-709Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). R-Ras is known to preferentially activate PI3K, producing phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate (PIP3) (21Marte B.M. Rodriguez-Viciana P. Wennström S. Warne P.H. Downward J. Curr. Biol. 1997; 7: 63-70Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 22Suire S. Hawkins P. Stephens L. Curr. Biol. 2002; 12: 1068-1075Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). PIP3 is a key molecule in a variety of biological functions, including neuronal migration and axon elongation, through modulation of a variety of signaling molecules, such as Akt, integrin-linked kinases, phosphoinositide-dependent kinases, and GEFs (23Downward J. Semin. Cell Dev. Biol. 2004; 15: 177-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (661) Google Scholar). Levels of PIP3 are critically based on the balance between activity of PI3K and PTEN (phosphatase and tensin homologue deleted on chromosome ten), which is a PI3-phosphatase, decreasing the level of PIP3 (24Leslie N.R. Downes C.P. Biochem. J. 2004; 382: 1-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (339) Google Scholar). PTEN is a critical player of the PI3K signaling pathway and regulates many physiologically and pathologically significant processes, such as cellular proliferation, survival, growth, and motility (24Leslie N.R. Downes C.P. Biochem. J. 2004; 382: 1-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (339) Google Scholar). PTEN is known to be a tumor suppressor, which antagonizes motility, inhibits cell cycle progression, and induces apoptosis in a variety of cells through the inhibition of PI3K signaling, and loss of PTEN function causes tumorigenesis or abnormality in neural development (24Leslie N.R. Downes C.P. Biochem. J. 2004; 382: 1-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (339) Google Scholar). The PI3-phosphatase activity of PTEN is critically regulated by phosphorylation of a cluster of serine and threonine residues located in the COOH-terminal region (25Tamguney T. Stokoe D. J. Cell Sci. 2007; 120: 4071-4079Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of the COOH-terminal region keeps PTEN as a closed inactive conformation, and dephosphorylation renders PTEN open and active in conformation and allows it to associate with the plasma membranes, displaying phosphatase activity (26Rahdar M. Inoue T. Meyer T. Zhang J. Vazquez F. Devreotes P.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2009; 106: 480-485Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). It has been reported that alanine substitutions at these phosphorylation sites of PTEN (PTEN-3A; a phosphorylation-resistant mutant) lead to higher catalytic activity, whereas the mutant with glutamic acid substitutions at these sites (PTEN-3E; a phosphorylation mimic mutant) shows low activity, acting as a dominant negative form (27Das S. Dixon J.E. Cho W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2003; 100: 7491-7496Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar). Thus, the dephosphorylation is a key step for the activation of PTEN. There are several protein kinases that potentially phosphorylate the COOH-terminal domain of PTEN, and among them CK2 (casein kinase 2) has been implicated in the phosphorylation and inhibition of PTEN activity (28Torres J. Pulido R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 993-998Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (516) Google Scholar). CK2 is a serine/threonine protein kinase that consists of a catalytic α subunit and regulatory β subunit (29Litchfield D.W. Biochem. J. 2003; 369: 1-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (1004) Google Scholar). CK2 has a variety of physiological targets and participates in a series of cellular functions, including the maintenance of cell viability (29Litchfield D.W. Biochem. J. 2003; 369: 1-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (1004) Google Scholar). It was recently reported that nerve growth factor, a member of axon-growing neurotrophins, activates CK2 and then phosphorylates and suppresses PTEN activity, promoting axon outgrowth, suggesting that CK2-mdiated PTEN inhibition is involved in the regulation of axon outgrowth (30Arevalo M.A. Rodríguez-Tébar A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2006; 17: 3369-3377Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Concerning a role of PTEN in axon guidance, the involvement of PTEN in the Sema3A-mediated growth cone collapse has been suggested (31Chadborn N.H. Ahmed A.I. Holt M.R. Prinjha R. Dunn G.A. Jones G.E. Eickholt B.J. J. Cell Sci. 2006; 119: 951-957Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). However, signaling pathways of semaphorin/plexins, including PTEN, remain elusive. In this study, we characterized the downstream signaling pathway of Sema4D/Plexin-B1-mediated R-Ras GAP activity for growth cone collapse and showed that Sema4D/Plexin-B1 inhibits CK2α activity and promotes the dephosphorylation and activation of PTEN through the R-Ras GAP activity, inducing growth cone collapse in hippocampal neurons. Hemagglutinin (HA)-tagged Rnd1, green fluorescent protein (GFP)-tagged human R-Ras and R-Ras-QL (Q87L), the NH2-terminal HA-tagged myristoylated form of the R-Ras GAP domain of R-Ras GAP (amino acids 291–614), Myc-tagged full-length human Plexin-B1, Myc-Plexin-B1-ΔC (lacking the last seven COOH-terminal amino acids), Myc-Plexin-B1-Δect (deletion of amino acids 1–1306), Myc-Plexin-B1-Δect-RA (R1677A/R1678A/R1984A), and Myc-Plexin-B1-Δect-GGA (L1849G/V1850G/P1851A), have been described previously (16Oinuma I. Ishikawa Y. Katoh H. Negishi M. Science. 2004; 305: 862-865Crossref PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar, 32Katoh H. Harada A. Mori K. Negishi M. Mol.

Neurosci. 2004; 24: 11473-11480Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). cDNAs encoding rat PTEN and CK2α were obtained by PCR from adult rat brains and subcloned into pEGFP (Clontech). GFP-tagged PTEN mutants, GFP-PTEN-C124S (a phosphatase activity-deficient dominant negative mutant), GFP-PTEN-3A (S380A/T382A/T383A) (a phosphorylation-resistant mutant), and GFP-PTEN-3E (S380E/T382E/T383E) (a phosphorylation-mimic mutant), and a CK2α mutant, CK2α–K68A (a mutant lacking kinase activity), were generated by PCR-mediated mutagenesis. The short hairpin RNAs (shRNAs) for PTEN were designed to target 19 nucleotides of rat transcripts and expressed by using an shRNA expression vector, pSilencer (Ambion). The target sequences for PTEN shRNA constructs are as follows: PTEN shRNA 338 (nucleotides 338–356, 5′-GTGAAGACGACAATCATGT-3′) and PTEN shRNA 1064 (nucleotides 1064–1084, 5′-CAAATCCAGAGGCTAGCAGTT-3′). Antibodies used were as follows: mouse monoclonal antibodies against Myc and Na+/K+-ATPase α subunit (Upstate Biotechnology); mouse monoclonal antibodies against α-tubulin and vimentin (Sigma); mouse monoclonal antibody against GFP (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA); rabbit polyclonal antibodies against Akt phosphorylated at Ser-473, Akt, PTEN phosphorylated at Ser-380, and PTEN (Cell Signaling); a rat monoclonal antibody against HA (Roche Applied Science); a mouse monoclonal antibody against GAPDH (Ambion); horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies (DAKO); Alexa 594-conjugated secondary antibodies and rhodamine-phalloidin (Molecular Probes). The pharmacological PTEN inhibitor dipotassium bisperoxo (picolinato) oxovanadate (V) (bpV(pic)) was purchased from Calbiochem and dissolved in Me2SO. Laminin and poly-l-lysine were purchased from Sigma and used as 10 μg and 25 μg/ml, respectively. A soluble form of Sema4D fused to human IgG1-Fc was from H. Kikutani (Osaka University, Osaka, Japan), and Sema4D stimulation was carried out by replacing the culture medium with a Sema4D-containing conditioned medium, which contained ∼150 nm Sema4D-Fc. COS-7 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) containing 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), 4 mm glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 0.2 mg/ml streptomycin under humidified conditions in 95% air and 5% CO2 at 37 °C. Transient transfections were carried out with Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions, and the cultures were maintained in DMEM with 0.5% FBS after transfection for 2.5 days. Primary hippocampal neurons were isolated from embryonic day 18.5 rats as described previously (20Ito Y. Oinuma I. Katoh H. Kaibuchi K. Negishi M. EMBO Rep. 2006; 7: 704-709Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar) and were plated onto the poly-l-lysine- and laminin-coated coverslips (circular, 13 mm in diameter) or plastic dishes (60 mm in diameter), at a density of 3.5 × 104 cells/cm2. After 2 days in culture, the medium was changed to Opti-MEM (Invitrogen) supplemented with 2% B-27 (Invitrogen), and the neurons were transfected with test plasmids using Lipofectamine 2000 for analysis of growth cone morphology. Neurons were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde and in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and processed for the immunohistochemistry. Hippocampal neurons dissociated from embryonic day 18.5 rats were transfected with test plasmids using the Rat Neuron Nucleofector kit (Amaxa Biosystems) following the manufacturer's instructions for immunoblotting. Immunocytochemistry was performed as described previously (16Oinuma I. Ishikawa Y. Katoh H. Negishi M. Science. 2004; 305: 862-865Crossref PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar). Briefly, all steps were carried out at room temperature, and neurons were rinsed with PBS between each step. After transfection, neurons on coverslips were fixed with 4% formaldehyde in PBS for 15 min. After residual formaldehyde had been quenched with 50 mm NH4Cl in PBS for 10 min, neurons were permeabilized with 0.2% Triton X-100 in PBS for 10 min and incubated with 10% FBS in PBS for 30 min to block nonspecific antibody binding. To visualize filamentous actin (F-actin), fixed neurons were stained with rhodamine-phalloidin. Neurons on coverslips were mounted in 90% glycerol containing 0.1% p-phenylenediamine dihydrochloride in PBS. Neuronal morphology was analyzed from digital images acquired at ×40 magnification by using a Leica DC350F digital camera system equipped with a Nikon Eclipse E800 microscope and Image-Pro Plus image analysis software (Media Cybernetics). Tips of the longest neurites were analyzed, and growth cone positive cells were defined as those that possessed lamellipodia and filopodia. More than 30 cells were examined in three independent experiments, and statistical significance was determined by using the analysis of variance test (Dunnett) or Student's t test. Preparation of Triton X-100-soluble and -insoluble fractions of neurons or COS-7 cells was performed as described elsewhere (34Oinuma I. Katoh H. Negishi M. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 303-318Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Cells were washed with cell solubilization buffer (10 mm PIPES, pH 7.0, 50 mm KCl, 10 mm EGTA, 3 mm MgCl2, 2 m glycerol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 2 mm NaF, and 1 mm NaVO3) and then lysed with the buffer, containing 1% Triton X-100, for 1 min at 4 °C by homogenizing with a Potter-Elvehjem homogenizer. The homogenates were centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 1 h to remove the soluble fraction. The particulate pellet was resuspended in extraction buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 80 mm KCl, 1 mm EGTA, 30 mm MgCl2, 0.25 m NaCl, 10 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml leupeptin), and the fraction was passed through a 25-gauge syringe three times before immunoblotting analysis. Proteins were separated by 7 or 12.5% SDS-PAGE and were electrophoretically transferred onto a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Millipore Corp.). The membrane was blocked with 3% low fat milk in Tris-buffered saline (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl) and then incubated with primary antibodies. The primary antibodies were detected with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies and a chemiluminescence detection kit (Chemi-Lumi One, Nacalai Tesque). Measurement of PTEN phosphatase activity in cells was performed as described previously (35Leslie N.R. Gray A. Pass I. Orchiston E.A. Downes C.P. Biochem. J. 2000; 346: 827-833Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Neurons or COS-7 cells were lysed with ice-cold lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 1 mm NaVO3, 25 mm NaF, 100 μm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, and 10 mm dithiothreitol). After centrifugation at 100,000 × g for 1 h, the extracts were incubated with anti-PTEN antibody for 2 h at 4 °C and then with Protein G-Sepharose beads (GE Healthcare) for 1 h. The PTEN phosphatase enzyme reaction was initiated by the incubation of immunoprecipitates in the reaction buffer containing 1 nmol of PIP3 (WAKO) and 10 nmol of phosphatidylserine (Sigma) for 30 min at 25 °C. The reaction was terminated by the addition of N-methylimide. After centrifugation, the supernatant was incubated with Biomol Green (Biomol) for 20 min at 25 °C, and the color was quantified by spectrophotometry at 620 nm, which reflected the relative amount of PTEN activity in the sample. CK2α kinase activity was measured using a CK2 kinase assay kit (CycLex). Neurons were harvested and sonicated in Kinase Reaction Buffer. After centrifugation, the extracts were pipetted into the 96-well plates precoated with a substrate of CK2α corresponding to recombinant p53 (amino acids 1–55), and incubated for 10 min at 30 °C in the presence of 12.5 μm ATP. After the reaction of samples containing CK2α and precoated recombinant p53, the wells were washed with buffer five times and incubated with the horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-phospho-p53 (Ser-46) antibody (TK-4D4) for 30 min at 25 °C. After the incubation with TK-4D4, the wells were washed with wash buffer five times and incubated with the TMB for 5 min at 25 °C. After the peroxidase color reaction, the reaction was terminated by the addition of H2SO4, and the color was quantified by spectrophotometry at 450 nm, which reflected the relative amount of CK2 activity in the sample. It has been shown that dephosphorylation of PTEN at the COOH-terminal region allows PTEN to associate with the membrane, leading to PTEN activation, indicating that the dephosphorylation and subsequent membrane translocation of PTEN are critical steps for PTEN activation (25Tamguney T. Stokoe D. J. Cell Sci. 2007; 120: 4071-4079Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). We examined the effect of Sema4D on the phosphorylation level of PTEN at Ser-380 in primary cultured rat hippocampal neurons. As shown in Fig. 1A, Sema4D stimulation caused a marked decrease in phosphorylated PTEN at Ser-380. To study the effect of Sema4D on subcellular localization of PTEN, we prepared a Triton X-100-soluble fraction and insoluble cytoskeletal membrane fraction from cultured hippocampal neurons. Sema4D stimulation induced the increase in the amount of PTEN protein in the Triton X-100-insoluble membrane fraction in parallel with the decrease in the soluble fraction (Fig. 1B). We further examined the effect of Sema4D on the in vitro phosphatase activity of PTEN. Sema4D significantly stimulated the PTEN phosphatase activity in hippocampal neurons (Fig. 1C). Thus, Sema4D stimulated dephosphorylation of PTEN, the shift in its Triton X-100 extractability, and in vitro PTEN phosphatase activity. To assess the role of PTEN in Sema4D-induced growth cone collapse, we generated two shRNA expression vectors designed to target two different regions of the PTEN transcript; these shRNAs (338 and 1064) effectively reduced the amount of endogenous PTEN in hippocampal neurons (see Fig. 3A). Hippocampal neurons were transfected with GFP and shRNAs, and their growth cone morphology was observed. In neurons expressing the control shRNA, Sema4D normally induced growth cone collapse, but the expression of two PTEN-specific shRNAs (338 and 1064) impaired the Sema4D-induced growth cone collapse (Fig. 2A). We next examined the effect of PTEN-C124S, a phosphatase activity-deficient dominant negative mutant of PTEN, on the Sema4D-induced growth cone collapse. The expression of PTEN-C124S strongly suppressed the Sema4D-induced growth cone collapse (Fig. 2B). We further examined the effect of bpV(pic), a pharmacological PTEN inhibitor, on the Sema4D-induced growth cone collapse. Pretreatment with bpV(pic) also suppressed the Sema4D-induced growth cone collapse (Fig. 2C). In contrast, the expression of wild-type PTEN by itself triggered the growth cone collapse (Fig. 2D). Previously, we demonstrated that Sema4D induces dephosphorylation of Akt, and this Akt dephosphorylation is a critical step for inducing growth cone collapse in hippocampal neurons (20Ito Y. Oinuma I. Katoh H. Kaibuchi K. Negishi M. EMBO Rep. 2006; 7: 704-709Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). We then examined the effects of two PTEN-specific shRNAs on the Sema4D-inducd Akt dephosphorylation in hoppocampal neurons. Expression of two PTEN shRNAs (338 and 1064) but not control shRNA inhibited the Sema4D-induced dephosphorylation of Akt (Fig. 3B). These results indicate that PTEN activity is required for the Sema4D-induced Akt dephosphorylation and subsequent growth cone collapse.FIGURE 2PTEN is required for Sema4D-induced growth cone collapse. A, neurons at 2 DIV were transfected with control shRNA or PTEN shRNA (338 or 1064) and were fixed at 3 DIV after stimulation with or without Sema4D for 1.5 h. B, neurons at 2 DIV were transfected with GFP or GFP-PTEN-C124S and were fixed at 3 DIV after stimulation with or without Sema4D for 1.5 h. C, neurons were pretreated with 200 nm bpV(pic) for 1 day and were fixed at 3 DIV after stimulation with or without Sema4D for 1.5 h. D, neurons at 2 DIV were transfected with GFP or GFP-PTEN and were fixed at 3 DIV. F-actin was stained with rhodamine-conjugated phalloidin to visualize the lamellipodia and filopodia. Growth cone-positive cells were scored as a percentage of the total number of transfected cells, and the results are the means ± S.E.

J. 2004; 382: 1-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (339) Google Scholar). To evaluate the role of Sema4D-induced dephosphorylation of PTEN in the growth cone collapse, we constructed two GFP-tagged PTEN mutants, GFP-PTEN-3A (S380A/T382A/T383A), a phosphorylation-resistant mutant, and GFP-PTEN-3E (S380E/T382E/T383E), a phosphorylation-mimic mutant. In COS-7 cells, expression of GFP-PTEN-3A induced dephosphorylation of Akt, whereas GFP-PTEN-3E expression significantly promoted the Akt phosphorylation, suggesting that PTEN-3A and PTEN-3E act as constitutively active and dominant negative mutants, respectively (Fig. 4A). We first examined the effect of GFP-PTEN-3E, the dominant negative mutant, on the Sema4D-induced growth cone collapse in hippocampal neurons. As shown in Fig. 4B, the expression of GFP-PTEN-3E strongly suppressed the Sema4D-induced growth cone collapse (Fig. 4B). We next examined the effect of GFP-PTEN-3A, the constitutively active mutant, on the growth cone morphology. The expression of GFP-PTEN-3A by itself triggered growth cone collapse (Fig. 4C). These results strongly indicate that the Sema4D-induced dephosphorylation of PTEN is necessary for the Sema4D-induced growth cone collapse in hippocampal neurons. We previously demonstrated that Sema4D/Plexin-B1 induces the growth cone collapse through R-Ras GAP activity and that the expression of R-Ras GAP activity requires the binding of Rnd1, a member of the Rho family and a constitutively active GTPase, to the intracellular cytoplasmic domain of Plexin-B1 (16Oinuma I. Ishikawa Y. Katoh H. Negishi M. Science. 2004; 305: 862-865Crossref PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar). We then examined whether the Sema4D-induced PTEN dephosphorylation is mediated by R-Ras GAP activity of Plexin-B1 in COS-7 cells ectopically expressing Plexin-B1 and Rnd1. As shown in Fig. 5A, Sema4D stimulation markedly induced dephosphorylation of PTEN at Ser-380 in COS-7 cells expressing wild-type full-length Plexin-B1 and Rnd1. It has been reported that Plexin-B1 stimulates RhoA activity through the interaction of its COOH-terminal PDZ domain-binding motif with PDZ-RhoGEF/LARG (8Swiercz J.M. Kuner R. Behrens J.

In this study, we provide evidence that the neural cell adhesion molecule (NCAM) and the neurotrophin receptor TrkB directly interact via sequences in their intracellular domains. Stimulation of TrkB by brain-derived neurotrophic factor leads to tyrosine phosphorylation of NCAM at position 734. Mutation of this tyrosine to phenylalanine completely abolishes tyrosine phosphorylation of NCAM by TrkB. Moreover, the knockdown of TrkB in hippocampal neurons leads to a reduction of NCAM-induced neurite outgrowth. Transfection of NCAM-deficient hippocampal neurons with mutated NCAM carrying an exchange of tyrosine by phenylalanine at position 734 leads to promotion of NCAM-induced neurite outgrowth in comparison with that observed after transfection with wild-type NCAM, whereas a reduction of neurite outgrowth was observed after transfection with mutated NCAM, which carries an exchange of tyrosine by glutamate that mimics the phosphorylated tyrosine. Our observations indicate a functional relationship between TrkB and NCAM. Recognition molecules and neurotrophins play important roles during development and maintenance of nervous system functions.

Development and maintenance of nervous system functions depend on molecular cues that interact with each other in morphogenetic processes, such as cell proliferation, migration, differentiation and survival, neuritogenesis, and synaptogenesis, as well as in regulation of synaptic activity in the adult. Recognition molecules have been shown to play an important role in these interactions. Equally important are neurotrophic factors that regulate neuronal survival and neuritogenesis not only during development, but also in the adult, when the nervous system is under constraint to regenerate after injury and during synaptic plasticity, underlying learning and memory (1Kaplan D.R. Miller F.D. Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 2000; 10: 381-391Crossref PubMed Scopus (1663) Google Scholar).

Overlapping in some functions with NCAM, the neurotrophin receptor TrkB (receptor tyrosine kinase B), a receptor tyrosine kinase that is triggered by its ligand, the brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), regulates neuronal cell survival, neurite outgrowth, synaptogenesis, and synaptic activity (7Klein R.

It has been suggested that NCAM via its α2,8-linked polysialic acid (PSA) presents BDNF to TrkB, thus concentrating the neurotrophin close to the site of its action (14Muller D. Djebbara-Hannas Z.

Rat pcDNA3-NCAM140 and rat pcDNA3-NCAM180 were a kind gift of Patricia Maness (University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, NC). Cloning of the intracellular domain of mouse CHL1 (close homolog of L1) into pcDNA3 was described (23Hillenbrand R. Molthagen M. Montag D. Schachner M. Eur. J. Neurosci. 1999; 11: 813-826Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Rat full-length TrkB cDNA was cloned into the pcDNA3 plasmid (Invitrogen).

Sequences coding for NCAM140-ID (bp 2135–2550) and NCAM180-ID (bp 2135–2850) or CHL1-ID (bp 3315–3627) were amplified and cloned into pQE30. Protein expression in Escherichia coli strain M15/pREP4 and purification of soluble proteins under native conditions using a French pressure 20K chamber (Spectronic Instruments/SLM Aminco) at 10,000 p.s.i. for 5 min on ice and nickel-chelate resin (Ni2+-NTA beads, Qiagen) was conducted according to the manufacturer's instructions. Protein solutions were dialyzed against phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.3 (PBS) and concentrated using Centricon filter devices (Millipore Corp., Bedford, MA). Native TrkB-ID prepared in a baculovirus expression system (24Iwasaki Y. Nishiyama H. Suzuki K. Koizumi S. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 2694-2700Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar) was a kind gift of Shinichi Koizumi and Motohiko Kometani (Novartis Pharma K.K., Tsukuba Research Institute, Ibaraki, Japan). A phage library (New England Biolabs, Frankfurt, Germany) displaying 108–1010 random 12-mer peptides at the pili of M13-like phage particles in fusion with the N terminus of the pVIII major coat protein was used (25Hong S.S. Boulanger P. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 4714-4727Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). All in vitro selection steps were performed according the Ph.D.-12TM phage display peptide library kit instruction manual version 2.0 (New England Biolabs). NCAM180-ID immobilized on Ni2+-NTA beads (Qiagen) was used for biopanning. After three rounds of biopanning, bound phages were eluted using 0.2 m glycine-HCl, pH 2.2, and single phage clones were selected, amplified in Escherichia coli strain ER2738, and subjected to DNA sequencing. 0.2 mg of Sulfo-SBED (Perbio Science, Bonn, Germany) dissolved in 5 μl of DMSO was incubated with 0.2 mg of NCAM180-ID or CHL1-ID in 0.5 ml of PBS for 1 h at room temperature in the dark. Unbound cross-linker was removed by overnight microdialysis in PBS. Brains from 2–3-month-old C57BL/6J mice were homogenized at 4 °C in PBS containing 1 mm Mg2Cl, 1 mm MnCl2, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm NaF, 0.5 mm Na3VO4, 1 μm N-[(3,5-difluorophenyl)acetyl]-l-alanyl-2-phenyl]glycine-1,1-dimethylethyl ester (Calbiochem), 20 μm GM6001 (Calbiochem), 1× CompleteTM EDTA-free protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Biosciences). After centrifugation for 45 min at 25,000 × g and 4 °C, the resulting membrane pellet was resuspended in RPMI medium (PAA Laboratories, Pasching, Austria) and preincubated at 37 °C for 2 h. After the addition of protein-cross-linker complexes, the samples were incubated for 30 min at room temperature and exposed to UV light (365 nm) for 15 min on ice. Triton X-100 was added at a final concentration of 1%, and after a 45-min incubation on ice, the samples were centrifuged for 5 min at 200 × g and 4 °C. The supernatants were incubated with 350 μl of Ni2+-NTA beads for 1 h at 4 °C. After washing the beads with PBS, bound protein was eluted by 0.25 m imidazolium, pH 8.0, 300 mm NaCl, and 50 mm NaH2PO4 and incubated with 50 μl of magnetic streptavidin Dynabeads (Dynal Diagnostics, Hamburg, Germany) for 1 h at 4 °C. The beads were washed with PBS, and bound proteins were eluted by boiling the beads in SDS-PAGE sample buffer (60 mm Tris/HCl, pH 6.8, 2% SDS, 1% β-mercaptoethanol, 10% glycerol, 0.02% bromphenol blue). To isolate brain membranes, 2–3-month-old NCAM-deficient or wild-type littermate mice were homogenized in HOMO buffer (5 mm Tris-HCl, 0.32 m sucrose, 1 mm MgCl2, 1 mm CaCl2, 1 mm NaHCO3, 1× CompleteTM EDTA-free protease inhibitor mixture, pH 7.5) and centrifuged at 17,000 × g for 20 min at 4 °C. The pellet was resuspended in 9 volumes of ice-cold H2O plus 1× CompleteTM EDTA-free protease inhibitor mixture and adjusted to 5 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5. After centrifugation at 25,000 × g for 20 min at 4 °C, the pellet was resuspended in immune precipitation buffer (25 mm Tris-HCl, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 1% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, pH 7.6). The detergent extracts were centrifuged for 1 h at 100,000 × g and 4 °C and subjected to preclearing by incubation with Protein A/G-agarose Plus (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Triton X-100 (final concentration 0.5%) and antibody were added to the precleared supernatant and incubated for 3 h at 4 °C. Protein A/G-agarose beads were added and incubated overnight at 4 °C under constant agitation. NCAM antibody H28 was immobilized to Protein A/G-Sepharose beads by incubating 200 μg of antibody with 400 μl of beads overnight at 4 °C under constant agitation followed by incubation with 200 mm sodium tetraborate, pH 9.0, for 3 h and with 0.2 m ethanolamine, pH 8.0, for 2 h at room temperature. Transiently transfected CHO cells or neurons were lysed in immune precipitation buffer and were subjected to the same treatment as above, or anti-phosphotyrosine agarose beads (Millipore, Schwalbach, Germany) were added and incubated overnight at 4 °C under constant agitation. Beads were washed once with washing buffer containing 750 mm NaCl in 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, and 0.5% Triton X-100 and washed three times with PBS and finally treated with 2× SDS-PAGE sample buffer for 5 min at 95 °C. BSA (10 mg; Sigma-Aldrich) dissolved in 2 ml of conjugation buffer (83 mm NaH2PO4, 0.9 m NaCl, pH 7.2) was incubated with 140 μl of a mixture of 13 mg/ml m-maleimido-benzoyl-N-hydroxysuccinimidyl ester (Sigma-Aldrich) in DMSO and 2.5 mg/ml biotinamidocaproate-N-hydroxysuccinimide ester (Sigma-Aldrich) in DMSO for 1 h at room temperature and gentle agitation. After gel filtration through a PD-10 column (GE Healthcare), the flow-through was incubated with 2 mg of synthetic peptide bearing a cysteine residue at the C terminus in conjugation buffer for 3 h at room temperature. Cysteine (10 mg/ml) was added, and the sample was dialyzed overnight at 4 °C against PBS and concentrated by using Vivaspin centrifugation tubes (Vivaspin 20, Vivascience, Göttingen, Germany) with a 30 kDa membrane cut-off. Western blot analysis and ELISA were performed as described (26Makhina T. Loers G. Schulze C. Ueberle B. Schachner M. Kleene R. Mol. Cell. Neurosci. 2009; 41: 206-218Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). For ELISA, proteins and peptides were coated on microtiter plates (Maxisorb F8, Nunc, Wiesbaden, Germany) at a concentration of 10–20 μg/ml and 10–100 μg/ml overnight at 4 °C under constant agitation, respectively. In case of competition ELISA, the competitor was preincubated for 10 min at different concentrations (5–400 μg/ml) with a constant amount (25–50 μg/ml) of the indicated binding protein. Specific binding was quantified by measuring the absorbance at 405 nm using an ELISA reader. As a control for nonspecific binding, BSA instead of the indicated protein/peptide was used. Absorbance values from nonspecific binding were always subtracted from the absorbance values of the respective sample measurements. Preparation of cerebellar microexplants and measurements of neurite outgrowth on NCAM immunoaffinity-purified from adult mouse brain was as described (27Kalus I. Bormann U. Mzoughi M. Schachner M. Kleene R. J. Neurochem. 2006; 98: 78-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). CHO cells were grown in Glasgow modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (Invitrogen) in 6-well plates at 37 °C in a humidified incubator gassed with 5% CO2 and transiently transfected at 90% confluence using the Lipofectamine Plus kit (Invitrogen) according to the protocol of the manufacturer. Hippocampal neurons were prepared, cultured, and transfected as described (28Dityateva G. Hammond M. Thiel C. Ruonala M.O. Delling M. Siebenkotten G. Nix M. Dityatev A. J. Neurosci. Methods. 2003; 130: 65-73Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). For analysis of neurite outgrowth, neurons were co-transfected with EGFP expression vectors (1 μg/106 cells). Transfected neurons were seeded on 96-well plates coated with 100 μg/ml poly-l-lysine (Sigma-Aldrich) followed by coating with 20 μg/ml laminin (Sigma-Aldrich) or 6 μg/ml NCAM-Fc (28Dityateva G. Hammond M. Thiel C. Ruonala M.O. Delling M. Siebenkotten G. Nix M. Dityatev A. J. Neurosci. Methods. 2003; 130: 65-73Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). BDNF was added to the cultures 4 h after cell plating. After 24–36 h, cells were washed with PBS, fixed with 4% formaldehyde in PBS, and stained with toluidine blue. For image acquisition of neurons stained with toluidine or co-transfected with enhanced GFP and for operator-controlled tracing of neurites, the inverted microscope Axiovert 135 and Kontron imaging system (Kontron Elektronik) or the laser-scanning confocal microscope LSM510-based imaging system (Zeiss, Jena, Germany) were used, respectively. The mean lengths of neurites were measured. Dissociated hippocampal neurons were seeded on coverslips coated with poly-l-lysine and maintained in serum-free medium for 4–5 days. Cultures were placed on ice and incubated in fresh medium with NCAM antibody H28 or PSA antibody 735 for 50 min, washed three times with PBS, incubated with secondary anti-mouse antibody coupled to the fluorescent dye Cy2 for 30 min in the dark, washed again three times with PBS, and fixed using 4% formaldehyde in PBS. After fixation, the neurons were incubated with polyclonal TrkB antibody 794, washed three times with PBS, incubated with secondary anti-rabbit antibody coupled to Cy3, and washed again with PBS. Coverslips were embedded in Aqua PolyMount medium (Polysciences Inc., Eppelheim, Germany) and analyzed with a Zeiss LSM510 confocal laser-scanning microscope. All numerical data are presented as group mean values with S.D. Parametric tests (t test or analysis of variance with subsequent Tukey's post hoc test) were used to compare group mean values as appropriate. Data conformed to the requirement for normal distribution (“normality” test, SigmaStat 2.0, SPSS, Chicago, IL). The threshold value for acceptance of differences between group mean values was 5%. In search of binding partners for the intracellular domain of NCAM, we screened a random 12-mer peptide library by phage display using the recombinant intracellular domain of the 180-kDa isoform of NCAM (NCAM180-ID) as substrate-coated bait. Phages that bound to immobilized NCAM180-ID were eluted, and single clones were selected and further investigated by ELISA. Phage clones that showed a strong concentration-dependent binding to substrate-coated NCAM180-ID were subjected to sequence analysis. Of 67 clones, one phage coded for the peptide QHFVHKHPGLSA. This sequence has a pronounced similarity to the sequence QHFVHR, which is part of a sequence stretch within the intracellular domain of TrkB (Fig. 1A). This short sequence stretch comprising amino acids 673–684 is present in the membrane-proximal catalytic domain of TrkB and contains the functionally pivotal aspartic acid, which is required for the enzymatic activity of TrkB. Scanning the Swiss-Prot protein data base (available on the World Wide Web) using the sequence motif QHFVH(R/K) revealed that this motif occurs only in TrkB. This motif is present in human, monkey, bovine, pig, mouse, rat, and chicken TrkB and in the putative TrkB homologue of fruit fly and snail (data not shown). The shorter sequence motif QHFVH is also found in the inositol 1,4,5-triphosphate receptor types 1, 2, and 3 from different species but not in other proteins. Sequence motifs similar to QHFVH(K/R), such as QHXXH, QXXXH, HXXH, or HXXHK were observed in 3, 11, 28, and 3 peptides, respectively, binding to NCAM180-ID (data not shown). The specificity of the binding of the synthetic phage-derived peptide QHFVHKHPGLSA was analyzed by ELISA using substrate-coated NCAM180-ID and a biotinylated peptide/BSA conjugate. The intracellular domain of the close homolog of L1 (CHL1-ID), an immunoglobulin superfamily member like NCAM, served as a control for specificity. A concentration-dependent, saturable binding of the peptide/BSA conjugate to NCAM-ID but not to the CHL1-ID was observed (Fig. 1B). To ascertain whether the intracellular domain of NCAM also binds to a synthetic TrkB peptide comprising amino acids 673–684 and/or to the entire TrkB-ID, an ELISA was performed. Both recombinant NCAM140-ID and NCAM180-ID but not CHL1-ID bound to the substrate-coated synthetic TrkB peptide (Fig. 1C) and, in addition, to the substrate-coated recombinantly expressed TrkB-ID (Fig. 1D). Because NCAM140-ID and NCAM180-ID both interact with TrkB, further experiments were performed with either of the two molecules. To investigate the interaction between NCAM and TrkB in neurons and to obtain indications that this interaction occurs in vivo, we examined localization of NCAM and TrkB in primary cultured neurons after antibody-induced capping of NCAM using confocal immunofluorescence microscopy. For co-capping, live cultured hippocampal neurons were incubated first with a monoclonal antibody either against NCAM or PSA, which is predominantly present on NCAM, and then with secondary mouse antibodies. After fixation, neurons were incubated with a rabbit antibody against the intracellular domain of TrkB and a secondary rabbit antibody. A pronounced punctated co-immunostaining of TrkB with NCAM or PSA-NCAM was seen along neurites (Fig. 2), indicating that NCAM and TrkB have a chance to interact with each other in hippocampal neurons. Next, co-immunoprecipitation experiments were performed to verify that TrkB and NCAM are associated with each other. Using pan-Trk antibodies for immunoprecipitation, NCAM180 was found to co-immunoprecipitate from brain detergent extracts of adult wild-type mice but not from detergent extracts of NCAM-deficient mice, as shown by the Western blot analysis with the NCAM180-ID-specific antibody (Fig. 3A). Western blot with a TrkB-specific antibody showed that the pan-Trk antibody, which recognizes the intracellular domains of TrkA, TrkB, and TrkC, immunoprecipitated only the full-length 155-kDa TrkB isoform and not the truncated 95-kDa TrkB isoform, which is devoid of most of the intracellular domain. Because several TrkA-, TrkB-, and TrkC-specific antibodies were not effective in immunoprecipitation, TrkB specificity could not be proven. However, when the monoclonal NCAM antibody H28 was immobilized to Protein A/G beads and used for immunoprecipitation, a specific co-immunoprecipitation of NCAM and the full-length 155-kDa TrkB isoform from brain detergent extracts of adult wild-type but not NCAM-deficient mice was observed (Fig. 3B). No co-immunoprecipitation of the 95-kDa TrkB isoform, TrkA or TrkC was detectable (data not shown), whereas all three major isoforms of NCAM were immunoprecipitated from detergent extracts of wild-type but not NCAM-deficient mouse brains (Fig. 3B). These results confirm that TrkB and NCAM interact via their intracellular domains. To further characterize the specificity of the interaction between TrkB and NCAM, a chemical cross-linking approach was performed. Recombinant NCAM180-ID and, as a control, recombinant CHL1-ID were coupled to the trifunctional cross-linker sulfo-SBED containing a biotin moiety, and these conjugates were incubated as baits with crude mouse brain homogenates. After UV cross-linking, target proteins from the brain homogenate that bound to the bait protein were isolated using streptavidin-coupled magnetic beads and separated by SDS-PAGE under reducing conditions, leading to the transfer of the biotin label from the bait proteins to the bound target proteins. Western blot analysis using streptavidin conjugated to horseradish peroxidase allowed to detect biotinylated binding partners. Using CHL1-ID as bait, no biotinylated band was detectable, whereas a biotinylated protein with an apparent molecular mass of ∼155 kDa was detected as a binding partner of the NCAM-ID bait (Fig. 3C). This molecular mass resembled that of full-length TrkB, and by Western blot analysis using a pan-Trk and a TrkB-specific antibody, only a 155 kDa band was detected (Fig. 3C), implying that the cross-linked 155-kDa protein was indeed full-length TrkB. To identify the binding site for TrkB within NCAM140-ID and NCAM180-ID, peptides comprising consecutive sequences derived from NCAM140-ID and NCAM180-ID were probed in a competition ELISA for inhibition of binding of NCAM140-ID or NCAM180-ID to substrate-coated TrkB peptide. The peptide comprising the membrane-proximal sequences (amino acids 730–764) of NCAM140-ID and NCAM180-ID, but not the two other peptides deduced from the more distal intracellular sequences, reduced binding of NCAM180-ID to the TrkB peptide (Fig. 4). These observations indicate that the intracellular domains of TrkB and NCAM directly interact with each other in functionally important domains: the catalytic domain of TrkB and the membrane-proximal part of NCAM140-ID and NCAM180-ID that carries the functionally important tyrosine residue that, when phosphorylated, has been implicated in neurite outgrowth (29Diestel S. Laurini C. Traub O. Schmitz B. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2004; 322: 186-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Considering the function of TrkB as a receptor tyrosine kinase, we investigated whether TrkB is required for the phosphorylation of the intracellular domain of NCAM at a single transmembrane-proximal tyrosine that is important for neurite outgrowth and whether this phosphorylation is dependent on BDNF. We generated a mutation in full-length NCAM140 (NCAM140-Y734F) by exchanging this tyrosine with phenylalanine and analyzed tyrosine phosphorylation in the presence or absence of BDNF after transfection of NCAM140 or NCAM140-Y734F and/or TrkB into fibroblast-like CHO cells that do not express detectable levels of NCAM. Upon co-transfection of TrkB and NCAM140 or NCAM140-Y734F, immunoprecipitation of tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins by immobilized phosphotyrosine antibodies and Western blot analysis using NCAM antibodies showed co-immunoprecipitation of NCAM140 with the phosphotyrosine antibody in the presence of BDNF but not in its absence (Fig. 5A). However, even in the presence of BDNF and upon co-transfection of TrkB, NCAM140-Y734F was not co-immunoprecipitated by the phosphotyrosine antibody (Fig. 5A). Furthermore, neither NCAM140-Y734F nor NCAM140 was co-immunoprecipitated by the phosphotyrosine antibody when transfected alone without TrkB (Fig. 5A), indicating that TrkB was necessary for tyrosine phosphorylation of NCAM. However, the binding of TrkB to NCAM was not influenced by phosphorylation because they co-immunoprecipitated with or without BDNF triggering of TrkB to the same degree (data not shown). To exclude the possibility that NCAM is co-immunoprecipitated with other tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins, we also performed co-immunoprecipitations using an NCAM antibody and probed the immunoprecipitates with the phosphotyrosine antibodies. Upon co-transfection of TrkB and NCAM140 or NCAM140-Y734F, immunoprecipitation using NCAM antibodies and Western blot analysis using phosphotyrosine antibodies revealed co-immunoprecipitation of tyrosine phosphorylated NCAM140 but not of NCAM140-Y734F, even in the absence of BDNF (Fig. 5B). In the presence of BDNF, the amount of tyrosine-phosphorylated NCAM140 was significantly increased (Fig. 5B). When cells were mock-transfected or transfected with NCAM140 alone, no co-immunoprecipitation of tyrosine-phosphorylated NCAM140 was detectable, independent of the presence of BDNF (Fig. 5B). Finally, to investigate whether"

The pivotal role of mTOR in cellular and organismal homeostasis is reflected in the fact that dysregulation of this pathway results in unrestrained signaling activity in mammals and is associated with the occurrence of disease states including inflammation, cancer, and diabetes (9Inoki K. Li Y. Zhu T. Wu J. Guan K.L. Nat. Cell Biol. 2002; 4: 648-657Crossref PubMed Scopus (2360) Google Scholar).A common theme underlying a variety of stress conditions is the accumulation of misfolded proteins in cells. In response to stress, or heat shock, cells increase the expression of molecular chaperones. Molecular chaperones are essential for protecting nascent polypeptide chains from misfolding, facilitating co- and post-translational folding, assisting in assembly and disassembly of macromolecular complexes, and regulating translocation (10Bukau B. Weissman J. Horwich A. Cell. 2006; 125: 443-451Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1182) Google Scholar, 11Frydman J. Nimmesgern E. Ohtsuka K. Hartl F.U. Nature. 1994; 370: 111-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (562) Google Scholar). The concentration of molecular chaperones is titrated closely to the folding requirements within a specific cell type (12Morimoto R.I. Genes Dev. 2008; 22: 1427-1438Crossref PubMed Scopus (691) Google Scholar), and it has long been suggested that there is a close correlation between stress response and nutrient signaling pathways (13Neel J.V. Nutr. Rev. 1999; 57: S2-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar). Adverse environmental and metabolic conditions (including nutrient limitation, hypoxia, and DNA damage) result in a decrease in mTORC1 activity (14Reiling J.H. Sabatini D.M. Oncogene. 2006; 25: 6373-6383Crossref PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar). In addition to conserving cellular energy, the reduction in translation that accompanies the decreased mTORC1 activity also prevents the synthesis of unwanted proteins that could interfere with the cellular stress response. However, the effect of stress conditions on mTORC1 signaling appears to be ambiguous. Depending on exposure length, dose/concentration of the stressor, and time between stress stimulus and assay, stress conditions may have distinct effects on mTOR-dependent cellular events. Several stress conditions, such as UV light exposure, H2O2 addition, heat shock, and fluid sheer stress, have been shown to cause an initial increase of mTOR-dependent S6K phosphorylation, with decreases in mTORC1 activity occurring after prolonged or severe exposure (15Ding M. Li J. Leonard S.S. Shi X. Costa M. Castranova V. Vallyathan V. Huang C. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 2002; 234–235: 81-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 16Jurivich D.A. Chung J. Blenis J. J. Cell.

The importance of this initial up-regulation of mTORC1 activity upon imposition of stressors is not readily apparent. Similarly, it remains unclear how seemingly disparate stress conditions can elicit a similar response of mTORC1 signaling.The interface between chaperone-mediated stress response and mTORC1-mediated nutrient signaling can be viewed as a central homeostatic mechanism. Despite the obvious importance of this interface, however, the interrelationships between metabolic and cell stress signaling remain poorly understood, and currently, little is known about the role of cytosolic molecular chaperones in the regulation of nutrient signaling pathways. Survival of multicellular organisms depends on the ability to protect against a variety of stressors and the ability to adjust protein synthesis for developmental need. However, the molecular connection between chaperone-mediated stress response and the mTORC1-mediated nutrient signaling pathway remains poorly understood. In particular, it is completely unclear how mTORC1 signaling responds to the accumulation of misfolded proteins in cells. We now demonstrate that accumulation of misfolded proteins in cells, under both acute and chronic conditions, triggers mTORC1 signaling and transiently increases protein synthesis. This is in sharp contrast to other adverse conditions that suppress mTORC1 signaling and may represent an unrecognized cellular adaptation in response to protein quality fluctuations. Importantly, we provide evidence that molecular chaperones coordinate with nutrients to regulate mTORC1 complex assembly. Our results indicate that mTORC1, by sensing chaperone availability in cells, maintains protein homeostasis by linking protein quality and quantity control in cells.DISCUSSIONThe results presented in this report point to a new paradigm in the regulation of mTORC1 signaling in which chaperone availability directly affects mTORC1 signaling (Fig. 7B). Under normal growth conditions, mTORC1 activity relies on the coordination between molecular chaperones and nutrients. However, in the absence of chaperone availability, mTORC1 is unresponsive to nutrient stimulation. Conversely, higher levels of nutrients or reduced chaperone availability result in increased mTORC1 singling. Thus, mTORC1 perceives proteotoxic stress based on an order-of-severity sensing mechanism.mTORC1 Links Protein Quality and Quantity ControlThe initial increase of mTORC1 signaling upon exposure to adverse conditions was first reported over a decade ago. Work by the Blenis group (16Jurivich D.A. Chung J. Blenis J. J. Cell. Physiol. 1991; 148: 252-259Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar) demonstrated that heat shock treatment unexpectedly increased phosphorylation of S6K1 in mouse fibroblasts, a finding corroborated by Lin et al. (39Lin R.Z. Hu Z.W. Chin J.H. Hoffman B.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 31196-31202Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar) in 1997. Likewise, multiple studies have demonstrated that H2O2 treatment of cells regulates S6K activity in a dose- and time-dependent manner (40Bae G.U. Seo D.W. Kwon H.K. Lee H.Y. Hong S. Lee Z.W. Ha K.S. Lee H.W. Han J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 32596-32602Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar, 41Huang C. Li J. Ke Q. Leonard S.S. Jiang B.H. Zhong X.S. Costa M. Castranova V. Shi X. Cancer Res. 2002; 62: 5689-5697PubMed Google Scholar), similar to our results using amino acid analog treatment. The initial up-regulation of mTORC1 signaling upon imposition of stressors should not be viewed as the cell misinterpreting a life-threatening insult. Rather, this feature enables the cell to distinguish physiological fluctuations in the quality of translational products from the devastating accumulation of misfolded proteins. It is generally accepted that global protein translation is suppressed in response to severe stress conditions, but little is known about how cells respond to fluctuations in the quality of translational products. Like the variation of nutrient availability in the environment, there is a wide fluctuation in the quality of synthesized proteins during cell growth and organismal development. Based on our observations, we propose that once the buffering capacity of chaperones is exceeded, mTORC1 kinase activity is quickly attenuated. Thus, the positive regulation of mTORC1 signaling by misfolded proteins represents an unrecognized cellular adaptation in response to reduced protein quality.mTORC1 Senses Chaperone AvailabilityConsistent with other reports (14Reiling J.H. Sabatini D.M. Oncogene. 2006; 25: 6373-6383Crossref PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar, 27Ohji G. Hidayat S. Nakashima A. Tokunaga C. Oshiro N. Yoshino K. Yokono K. Kikkawa U. Yonezawa K. J. Biochem. 2006; 139: 129-135Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar), we demonstrate here that severe stress conditions suppress mTORC1 signaling. Interestingly, the transition from up-regulation to down-regulation occurs rapidly (Fig. 4, A and B). We reason that there is a threshold of chaperone availability for the mTORC1-mediated sensing mechanism. It is likely that folding status of mTOR determines the threshold. mTOR and other regulator components like Raptor are chaperone clients, as evidenced by the selective binding to Hsp90 when not forming the complex. In agreement with the role of Hsp90 in the ordered assembly and disassembly of large multisubunit complexes (42Frydman J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2001; 70: 603-647Crossref PubMed Scopus (921) Google Scholar), this binding shields the hydrophobic region of interacting components that maintains their solubility. Lack of chaperone availability may result in mTOR aggregation. Indeed, we observed a progressive change of mTOR solubility in heat-shocked HSF1−/− cells (Fig. 4D). This provides an explanation for the unresponsiveness of mTORC1 to high insulin levels under the depletion of chaperone availability.Dynamic Remodeling of mTORC1mTOR forms a huge complex (up to ∼2 MDa) with other subunits to achieve signal transmission (4Sarbassov D.D. Ali S.M. Sabatini D.M. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2005; 17: 596-603Crossref PubMed Scopus (1297) Google Scholar, 43Bentzinger C.F. Romanino K. Cloëtta D. Lin S. Mascarenhas J.B. Oliveri F. Xia J. Casanova E. Costa C.F. Brink M. Zorzato F. Hall M.N. Rüegg M.A. Cell Metab. 2008; 8: 411-424Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (485) Google Scholar). Such multicomponent complexes present special challenges for modulatory signaling pathways, which must sense both increasing and decreasing signal intensities and must also terminate and reinitiate signaling efficiently. A dynamic mode of mTORC1 complexes would fulfill this regulatory requirement. According to this scheme, termination of mTORC1 signaling would not require a separate mechanism but rather would be an intrinsic consequence of continuous disassembly of mTORC1. Indeed, we observed a high degree of mobility of mTOR molecules within the crowded cell interior, suggesting that mTOR molecules undergo rapid exchange between the complexes and free subunits (Fig. 5). Importantly, mTOR mobility is directly affected by both nutrients and chaperone availability. FRET analysis further confirmed that the changing mobility of mTOR is due to mTOR-Raptor interaction. Although it is challenging to recapitulate the mTORC1 dynamics in cell lysates using a biochemical approach (due to possible altered chaperone functionality in solution, detergent-affected protein-protein interactions, and a lack of lipid hydrophobicity), we conclude from our findings that mTORC1 complex assembly is a highly dynamic process inside cells, which consists of an efficient “on demand” assembly by nutrients and a continuous disassembly by molecular chaperones. Analogous to chaperone-regulated HSF1 functionality, the dynamic remodeling of mTORC1 signaling not only ensures tight control, dynamic range, and a rapidly reversible response in sensing upstream signals but provides an elegant mechanism linking protein quality and quantity control in cells. The interconnection of different signaling pathways that feed back through a shared pool of chaperones provides the recurrent framework for adaptation and survival of cells in a changing environment.Coordination between Nutrients and Chaperones in Regulating mTORC1 SignalingAs illustrated in Fig. 7B, chaperone-mediated mTORC1 disassembly coordinates with nutrient signaling-triggered assembly. This mechanism allows continuous sensing of extracellular nutrients and intracellular protein homeostasis. It remains to be determined how chaperone molecules actively remodel the mTORC1 complex. HSPs may simply “disaggregate” the mTORC1 complex while maintaining a continuous supply of signaling components. An important implication of the model of mTORC1 regulation presented in this study is the synergistic effect of nutrient overload and chaperone stress in metabolic dyshomeostasis. Unrestrained mTOR activity in mammals is associated with the occurrence of disease states including inflammation, cancer, and diabetes (23Inoki K. Corradetti M.N. Guan K.L. Nat. Genet. 2005; 37: 19-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (827) Google Scholar). By contrast, decreased mTOR signaling by genetic or pharmaceutical approaches (such as rapamycin) has been shown to extend lifespan in a variety of organisms (44Vellai T. Takacs-Vellai K. Zhang Y. Kovacs A.L. Orosz L. Muller F. Nature. 2003; 426: 620Crossref PubMed Scopus (811) Google Scholar, 45Kapahi P. Zid B.M. Harper T. Koslover D. Sapin V. Benzer S. Curr.

Interestingly, a robust stress response is also required for life span extension in these organisms (48Hsu A.L. Murphy C.T. Kenyon C. Science. 2003; 300: 1142-1145Crossref PubMed Scopus (1097) Google Scholar, 49Morley J.F. Morimoto R.I. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2004; 15: 657-664Crossref PubMed Scopus (528) Google Scholar). Therefore, there is a close correlation between stress response and nutrient signaling in regulating metabolic homeostasis.Under physiological conditions, depletion of chaperone availability is rare. In contrast, chronic reduction of chaperone functionality often occurs during aging processes (12Morimoto R.I. Genes Dev. 2008; 22: 1427-1438Crossref PubMed Scopus (691) Google Scholar). The up-regulation of mTORC1 signaling after reduction of chaperone availability could be beneficial at the initial stage to maintain protein homeostasis. However, prolonged mTORC1 activation might cause metabolic dysregulation. Consistent with this notion, CHIP−/− mice exhibited accelerated aging phenotypes as well as increased mTORC1 signaling (38Min J.N. Whaley R.A. Sharpless N.E. Lockyer P. Portbury A.L. Patterson C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2008; 28: 4018-4025Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). It is possible that accumulation of misfolded proteins might fuel aging processes by modulating the mTORC1 signaling pathway.In summary, our results unveiled a molecular linkage between protein quality and quantity control in cells. Further understanding of the interaction between stress response and the mTOR signaling pathway may provide opportunities for therapeutic avenues to aging and age-related diseases.

Weissman J. Horwich A. Cell. 2006; 125: 443-451Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1182) Google Scholar, 11Frydman J. Nimmesgern E. Ohtsuka K. Hartl F.U. Nature. 1994; 370: 111-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (562) Google Scholar). The concentration of molecular chaperones is titrated closely to the folding requirements within a specific cell type (12Morimoto R.I. Genes Dev. 2008; 22: 1427-1438Crossref PubMed Scopus (691) Google Scholar), and it has long been suggested that there is a close correlation between stress response and nutrient signaling pathways (13Neel J.V. Nutr. Rev. 1999; 57: S2-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar). Adverse environmental and metabolic conditions (including nutrient limitation, hypoxia, and DNA damage) result in a decrease in mTORC1 activity (14Reiling J.H. Sabatini D.M. Oncogene. 2006; 25: 6373-6383Crossref PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar). In addition to conserving cellular energy, the reduction in translation that accompanies the decreased mTORC1 activity also prevents the synthesis of unwanted proteins that could interfere with the cellular stress response. However, the effect of stress conditions on mTORC1 signaling appears to be ambiguous. Depending on exposure length, dose/concentration of the stressor, and time between stress stimulus and assay, stress conditions may have distinct effects on mTOR-dependent cellular events. Several stress conditions, such as UV light exposure, H2O2 addition, heat shock, and fluid sheer stress, have been shown to cause an initial increase of mTOR-dependent S6K phosphorylation, with decreases in mTORC1 activity occurring after prolonged or severe exposure (15Ding M.

The importance of this initial up-regulation of mTORC1 activity upon imposition of stressors is not readily apparent. Similarly, it remains unclear how seemingly disparate stress conditions can elicit a similar response of mTORC1 signaling.The interface between chaperone-mediated stress response and mTORC1-mediated nutrient signaling can be viewed as a central homeostatic mechanism. Despite the obvious importance of this interface, however, the interrelationships between metabolic and cell stress signaling remain poorly understood, and currently, little is known about the role of cytosolic molecular chaperones in the regulation of nutrient signaling pathways. Survival of multicellular organisms depends on the ability to protect against a variety of stressors and the ability to adjust protein synthesis for developmental need. However, the molecular connection between chaperone-mediated stress response and the mTORC1-mediated nutrient signaling pathway remains poorly understood. In particular, it is completely unclear how mTORC1 signaling responds to the accumulation of misfolded proteins in cells. We now demonstrate that accumulation of misfolded proteins in cells, under both acute and chronic conditions, triggers mTORC1 signaling and transiently increases protein synthesis. This is in sharp contrast to other adverse conditions that suppress mTORC1 signaling and may represent an unrecognized cellular adaptation in response to protein quality fluctuations. Importantly, we provide evidence that molecular chaperones coordinate with nutrients to regulate mTORC1 complex assembly. Our results indicate that mTORC1, by sensing chaperone availability in cells, maintains protein homeostasis by linking protein quality and quantity control in cells. The eukaryotic translational initiation machinery is a tightly controlled system that regulates protein synthesis based on many factors including the availability of growth factors, nutrients, and glucose (1Holcik M. Sonenberg N. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2005; 6: 318-327Crossref PubMed Scopus (1015) Google Scholar). Accordingly, when there are shortages of these factors, protein synthesis stalls.

The stretch-activated channel TREK1 (K(2P)2.1) is expressed widely in brain and has been linked to depression, neuroprotection, pain perception, and epilepsy. Little, however, is known about the regulation of TREK1 expression on the transcriptional and translational level or about its trafficking to the plasma membrane. Here we have used PCR techniques to identify a splice variant of TREK1 expressed in the brain, which encodes a heavily truncated TREK1 protein retaining a single transmembrane domain. Functional expression of this splice variant TREK1ΔEx4 in tsA201 cells in the presence or absence of wild type TREK1 revealed that TREK1ΔEx4 has no channel activity itself but reduced TREK1 whole cell current amplitude. Confocal analysis of the expression of fluorescently tagged TREK1 variants revealed that TREK1ΔEx4 is translated, but it is retained in the intracellular compartment. Additionally, TREK1ΔEx4 reduced the level of TREK1 expression in the plasma membrane. Long and short forms of TREK1 derived from alternative translation initiation are differentially affected by TREK1ΔEx4, with the short form (lacking the first 41 amino acids at its N terminus) unaffected. This differential regulatory role of TREK1ΔEx4 will alter the functional profile of TREK1 current in neurons where they are expressed. These results indicate that the N-terminal domain and first transmembrane domain of TREK1 are likely to be important for channel dimerization and trafficking to the plasma membrane."

These elements are separated by 40 kb but cluster in the nuclear space depending on CTCF but independent of estrogen and transcription. In contrast, in estrogen non-responsive breast cancer cells, the spatial proximity of these two elements is lost and the entire locus instead displays a polycomb repressive complex 2-controlled heterochromatin characteristic.

Recent studies have shown that male mice with targeted ablation of FK506-binding protein-52 (Fkbp52) develop hypospadias, most likely due to actions of Fkbp52 as a molecular co-chaperone of the androgen receptor (AR). Here, we further dissect the developmental and molecular mechanisms that underlie hypospadias in Fkbp52-deficient mice. Scanning electron microscopy revealed a defect in the elevation of prepucial swelling that led to the onset of the ventral penile cleft. Interestingly, expression of Fkbp52 was highest in the ventral aspect of the developing penis that undergoes fusion of the urethral epithelium. Although in situ hybridization and immunohistochemical analyses suggested that Fkbp52 mutants had a normal urethral epithelium signaling center and epithelial differentiation, a reduced apoptotic cell index at ventral epithelial cells at the site of fusion and a defect of genital mesenchymal cell migration were observed. Supplementation of gestating females with excess testosterone partially rescued the hypospadic phenotype in Fkbp52 mutant males, showing that loss of Fkbp52 desensitizes AR to hormonal activation. Direct measurement of AR activity was performed in mouse embryonic fibroblast cells treated with dihydrotestosterone or synthetic agonist R1881. Reduced AR activity at genes controlling sexual dimorphism and cell growth was found in Fkbp52-deficient mouse embryonic fibroblast cells. However, chromatin immunoprecipitation analysis revealed normal occupancy of AR at gene promoters, suggesting that Fkbp52 exerts downstream effects on the transactivation function of AR. Taken together, our data show Fkbp52 to be an important molecular regulator in the androgen-mediated pathway of urethra morphogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W2161692098,"The Root effect is a widespread property among fish hemoglobins whose structural basis remains largely obscure. Here we report a crystallographic and spectroscopic characterization of the non-Root-effect hemoglobin isolated from the Antarctic fish Trematomus newnesi in the deoxygenated form. The crystal structure unveils that the T state of this hemoglobin is stabilized by a strong H-bond between the side chains of Asp95α and Asp101β at the α(1)β(2) and α(2)β(1) interfaces. This unexpected finding undermines the accepted paradigm that correlates the presence of this unusual H-bond with the occurrence of the Root effect. Surprisingly, the T state is characterized by an atypical flexibility of two α chains within the tetramer. Indeed, regions such as the CDα corner and the EFα pocket, which are normally well ordered in the T state of tetrameric hemoglobins, display high B-factors and non-continuous electron densities. This flexibility also leads to unusual distances between the heme iron and the proximal and distal His residues. These observations are in line with Raman micro-spectroscopy studies carried out both in solution and in the crystal state. The findings here presented suggest that in fish hemoglobins the Root effect may be switched off through a significant destabilization of the T state regardless of the presence of the inter-aspartic H-bond. Similar mechanisms may also operate for other non-Root effect hemoglobins. The implications of the flexibility of the CDα corner for the mechanism of the T-R transition in tetrameric hemoglobins are also discussed."

The Mx1-Cre- mediated deletion of p400/mDomino resulted in an acute loss of nucleated cells in the bone marrow, including committed myeloid and erythroid cells as well as hematopoietic progenitor and stem cells. A hematopoietic colony assay revealed a drastic reduction in colony-forming activity after the deletion of p400/mDomino. Moreover, the loss of p400/mDomino in mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) resulted in strong growth inhibition. Cell-cycle analysis revealed that the mDomino-deficient MEFs exhibited a pleiotropic cell-cycle defect at the S and G(2)/M phases, and polyploid and multi-nucleated cells with micronuclei emerged. DNA microarray analysis revealed that the p400/mDomino deletion from MEFs caused the impaired expression of many cell-cycle-regulatory genes, including G(2)/M-specific genes targeted by the transcription factors FoxM1 and c-Myc. These results indicate that p400/mDomino plays a key role in cellular proliferation by controlling the expression of cell-cycle-regulatory genes."

We report that a short 27-residue peptide, N27, which lacks the pocket sequence, exhibits potent inhibitory activity in both cell-cell and virus-cell fusion assays when fatty acids were conjugated to its N but not C terminus. Furthermore, mutations in the positions that prevent interaction with the CHR but not with the NHR resulted in a dramatic reduction in N27 activity. These data support a mechanism in which N27 mainly targets the CHR rather than the internal NHR coiled-coil, reveal the N-terminal edge of the endogenous core structure in situ and hence complement our recent findings of the C-terminal edge of the core, and provide a new approach for designing short inhibitors from the NHR region of other lentiviruses due to similarities in their envelope proteins.—Wexler-Cohen, Y., Ashkenazi, A., Viard, M., Blumenthal, R., Shai, Y.

Heteronuclear multidimensional spectra yielded NMR spectral assignments for the reduced form of MsrB1 in which catalytic selenocysteine (Sec) was replaced with cysteine (Cys). MsrB1 consists of a central structured core of two β-sheets and a highly flexible, disordered N-terminal region. Analysis of pH dependence of NMR signals of catalytically relevant residues, comparison with the data for bacterial MsrBs, and NMR-based structural analysis of methionine sulfoxide (substrate) and methionine sulfone (inhibitor) binding to MsrB1 at the atomic level reveal a mechanism involving catalytic Sec(95) and resolving Cys(4) residues in catalysis. The MsrB1 structure differs from the structures of Cys-containing MsrBs in the use of distal selenenylsulfide, residues needed for catalysis, and the mode in which the active form of the enzyme is regenerated. In addition, this is the first structure of a eukaryotic zinc-containing MsrB, which highlights the structural role of this metal ion bound to four conserved Cys.

To address these limitations, a fused αβ mini-spectrin was produced that forms wild-type divalent tetramer complexes. Using this mini-spectrin, a medium-resolution structure of a seven-repeat bivalent tetramer was produced using homology modeling coupled with chemical cross-linking. Inter- and intramolecular cross-links provided critical distance constraints for evaluating and optimizing the best conformational model and appropriate docking interfaces. The two strands twist around each other to form a super-coiled, rope-like structure with the AB helix face of one strand associating with the opposing AC helix face. Interestingly, two tetramer site hereditary anemia mutations that exhibit wild-type binding in univalent head-to-head assays are located in the interstrand region. This suggests that perturbations of the interstrand region can destabilize spectrin tetramers and the membrane skeleton. The α subunit N-terminal cross-links to multiple sites on both strands, demonstrating that this non-homologous tail remains flexible and forms heterogeneous structures in the tetramer complex. Although no cross-links were observed involving the β subunit non-homologous C-terminal tail, several cross-links were observed only when this domain was present, suggesting it induces subtle conformational changes to the tetramer site region.

Basidiomycete (club) fungi are some of the most prolific producers of acetylenic natural products, yet the genes responsible for the critical C≡C bond-forming reactions have yet to be described. Mushrooms of the genera Cantharellus (chanterelles), Craterellus and Hydnum accumulate up to 62% of their total acyl lipids as 18:2 Δ9c,12a,14c (18Hiroi M. Tsuyuki H. Trans. Mycol. Soc. Japan. 1992; 33: 517-525Google Scholar). Chanterelles are valuable, widely distributed, nutritious mushrooms whose ectomycorrhizae are symbiotic with oak, beech, and conifers. Chanterelles appear to be resistant to insect and snail damage, and although the mechanism of this defense is unproven, acetylenic lipids or oxylipins are potential repellant or insecticidal natural products (19Pang Z. Sterner O. J. Org. Chem. 1991; 56: 1233-1235Crossref Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Radiochemical tracer experiments support acyl procession from 18:2 Δ9c,12c via dehydrocrepenynate, which rarely accumulates, with an exception being in Cantharellaceae family members, to more highly unsaturated specialized products in both plants and fungi (20Bohlmann F. Burkhardt T. Zdero C. Naturally Occurring Acetylenes. Academic Press, Inc., London1973Google Scholar, 21Barley G.C. Graf U. Higham C.A. Jarrah M.Y. Jones E.R.H. O'Neill I. Tachikawa R. Thaller V.

To synthesize 18:2 Δ9c,12a,14c, we hypothesized that a set of active FAD2 desaturases and an acetylenase must be expressed in the chanterelle family. In this paper we describe the cloning and functional characterization of the first acetylenase and a FAD2 desaturase from a chanterelle, Cantharellus formosus. Heterologous expression of these genes demonstrated sequential substrate utilization, sensitivity to epitope tagging, and by reconstitution of the Basidiomycetes pathway in yeast, allowed the first definition of the enzymatic transformations leading to dehydrocrepenynic acid. The untransformed yeast strain, InvSc1 (MATa/α his3Δ1 leu2 trp1-289 ura3-52; Invitrogen) was cultivated on rich medium (1% Bacto yeast extract, 2% Bacto peptone (Difco), 2% dextrose) at 30 °C. Transformed yeast strains were cultured in complete minimal media lacking uracil or lacking uracil and histidine (CM−ura or CM−ura−his) supplemented with dextrose (for propagation) or galactose (2 g/100 ml, for expression experiments) either without fatty acid supplementation or with linoleic acid (Sigma) or crepenynic acid (prepared from Crepis alpina seeds as described (23Ford G.L. J. Chromatogr. 1985; 346: 431-434Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar)) supplied at 0.5 mm in 1 mg/ml Nonidet P-40 (Sigma). Unless otherwise specified, for the heterologous expression of Cf0745 and Cf0807, cultures were grown at 15 °C with shaking at 250 rpm. Escherichia coli strains XL1-Blue and XL-1 MRF′ (Stratagene) and JM109 (Promega) were used for DNA cloning and amplification of plasmids. Plasmids carrying Aleurites fordii Myc-tagged ω-3 desaturase (24Dyer J.M. Chapital D.C. Kuan J.-C.W. Shepherd H.S. Tang F. Peppeman A.B. J. Am. Oil Chem.

Plant J. 2005; 44: 433-446Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar) desaturase genes were transformed into InvSc1 and expressed at 15–22 °C as described below. Chanterelle fruiting bodies were acquired from Ken Ottoboni Mushrooms (Ridgefield, WA). mRNA was prepared from C. formosus fruiting bodies using Trizol (Invitrogen) and poly(dT) beads (Dynal), and a Uni-ZAP XR cDNA library was prepared according to the manufacturer's protocol (Stratagene). Excised phagemids were sequenced with a T3 primer, and the resulting sequences were searched for homologs of PFAD2 and other known desaturases by BlastX (27Altschul S.F. Madden T.L. Schäffer A.A. Zhang J. Zhang Z. Miller W. Lipman D.J. Nucl. Acid Res. 1997; 25: 3389-3402Crossref PubMed Scopus (58771) Google Scholar, 28Minto R.E. Blacklock B.J. Younus H. Pratt A.C. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 2009; 75: 1156-1164Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar). Selected clones were resequenced with T7 primer. In an effort to obtain the 5′ ends of two Cantharellus cibarius PFAD2 homologs identified by shotgun sequencing (0745 and 0807), the phage library was screened with DNA probes (∼600 base pairs) prepared by PCR-amplification (Vent DNA polymerase; New England Biolabs) from excised phagemids with primers specific for the FAD2 homologs (supplemental Table S1). The probes were radiolabeled with dCTP* (PerkinElmer Life Sciences; 185 MBq, 50 mCi) by a random-primed reaction using the Ladderman labeling kit (TaKaRa, Shiga, Japan). Plaque lifts, hybridization, and screening were carried out by standard methods (29Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. Wiley-Interscience, New York1997Google Scholar, 30Sambrook J.F.T. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Positive phage clones from a two-step screen were recovered, and phagemids were excised with ExAssist helper phage in the SOLR E. coli strain (Stratagene). Excised plasmids were sequenced by in-house automated DNA sequencing (Dyenamic ET Terminator Cycle Sequencing kit; Amersham Biosciences) with a T7 promoter primer and compared with the initially sequenced EST clones. A cDNA that was slightly shorter than the original 0807 shot gun sequenced phagemid was obtained from this screen. Comparison of the sequences with each other and other diverged desaturases indicated that the initial phagemid clone was full-length, which was later confirmed by expression in yeast. Despite a second round of library screening for 0745 using a probe amplified with primers closer to the 5′ end of the initial EST clone ([email protected], [email protected]), we were unable to obtain the entire 5′ end of the gene. A 5′ rapid amplification of cDNA ends (5′-RACE) approach was used to obtain the remainder of the 0745 PFAD2 homolog from poly(A)+ RNA isolated from C. formosus fruiting bodies with the BD SMARTRACE cDNA amplification kit (BD Biosciences/Clontech). First-strand cDNA synthesis was accomplished with a poly(dT) primer and BD Power Script reverse transcriptase (BD Biosciences/Clontech), the C. formosus 0745 desaturase gene was amplified from the 5′-RACE-ready cDNA using a universal primer mix and a gene-specific primer ([email protected]), and the product was isolated by agarose gel electrophoresis gel extraction (BD Biosciences Nucleotrap Gel Extraction kit). 5′-RACE products were then subcloned into pGEM-T by T/A cloning (Promega pGEM-T Easy Vector System II) and transformed into ultra-competent JM109 E. coli (Promega), and insert-containing plasmids were sequenced as described. All oligonucleotide primers used are shown in supplemental Table S1. The full-length 0745 and 0807 open reading frames were amplified with primers containing BamHI (sense) and EcoRI (antisense) restriction sites for insertion into yeast expression vectors (supplemental Table S1). PCR products and DNA fragments were purified by Gene Clean (Bio 101), and purified, digested (BamHI/EcoRI; Promega) C. formosus desaturase inserts were ligated into pYES2 or pESc-His (Stratagene) with or without an N-terminal His6GlySer fusion tag with T4 DNA ligase (Invitrogen) and transformed into competent XL-1 Blue cells by standard techniques (30Sambrook J.F.T. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Sequence-validated plasmids were transformed into competent InvSc1 by a standard lithium acetate method (31Gietz R.D. Woods R.A. Methods Enzymol. 2002; 350: 87-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (2008) Google Scholar). Strains for co-expression were transformed simultaneously with dual selection. Heterologous expression of C. formosus-diverged desaturase genes was induced by cultivation of transformed Saccharomyces cerevisiae in 5 ml of CM−ura or CM−ura−his with galactose (2 g/100 ml) at the indicated temperatures with shaking at 250 rpm. Fatty acid methyl esters (FAMEs) of yeast lipids were prepared and analyzed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS, HP 5890-HP 5972 MS; DB-23 column) as previously described (28Minto R.E. Blacklock B.J. Younus H. Pratt A.C. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 2009; 75: 1156-1164Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar) and identified by comparison of retention time and parent ions to authentic standards. Cells supplemented with exogenous fatty acids were washed twice with 10 mg/ml Nonidet P-40 and once with H2O to remove fatty acids not incorporated into cellular lipids. Dimethyloxazolines were prepared according to the method of Christie (32Christie W.W. Chem. Phys. Lipids. 1998; 94: 35-41Crossref Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Synthesis and characterization of trans fatty acid authentic standards are provided in the supplemental data. FAME stereoisomers were additionally separated with an HP 5890 gas chromatograph using a SP-2380 capillary column (Aldrich, 30 m × 0.25 mm). The temperature program was 150 °C for 10 min, ramped to 180 °C at 2 °C/min, then ramped at 20 °C/min to 250 °C and cooled by 20 °C/min back to the initial temperature. The injector and detector were set to 250 °C, and the gas flow rate was 0.9 ml/min. Dimethyloxazoline derivatives were separated using the temperature program 100 °C or 3 min, ramped 5 °C/min to 250 °C, 250 °C for 3 min, and cooled 50 °C/min to 100 °C; inlet and detector temperatures, 250 °C. We initiated our search for diverged desaturases in the C. formosus, recently distinguished from C. cibarius as a unique species (33Redhead S.A. Norvell L. Danell E. Mycotaxon. 1997; 65: 285-322Google Scholar), genome through a cDNA sequencing approach. Phagemids (1037) were sequenced, and the resulting sequences were screened using a BLAST algorithm for homologs of known plant and fungal desaturases allowing us to identify two putative diverged Δ12 desaturases, Cf0745 and Cf0807 (5 representatives), and a Δ9 desaturase, Cf0820. The initial sequences were used in hybridization screening of the cDNA phage library for full-length clones. Of 1 × 105 plaque-forming units screened, 22 were identified as positives for Cf0807. A secondary screen provided three clones, and sequencing demonstrated that the full-length cDNA was represented in the Cf0807 initial clone. The predicted Cf0807 fatty acid desaturase cDNA contained 1248 base pairs encoding a 415-amino acid protein (GenBankTM accession number HM036207). Consistent with the initial shotgun sequencing, the predicted Cf0745 Δ12 desaturase was less well represented in the fruiting body cDNA library; of 1.5 × 105 plaque-forming units screened, 7 were identified as positive. A secondary screen resulted in 3 positive clones; however, a 5′-RACE strategy was necessary to obtain the 5′ end of the Cf0745 cDNA, affording a predicted 1389-bp FAD2 homolog cDNA encoding a 462-amino acid protein (accession number HM036206). Full-length nucleotide and amino acid sequences for both Cf0807 and Cf0745 are found in supplemental Fig. S2 and have been submitted to GenBankTM. An unrooted phylogenetic tree demonstrated the relationships of the chanterelle proteins to recognized desaturases and was suggestive of biochemical function (Fig. 2). Cf0745 (CfDES) was found to segregate with fungal proteins known only to carry out the prototypical oleate desaturase reaction. Cf0807 (CfACET), however, was not imbedded deeply within the mapped fungal clades but was, rather, lying on a discrete spur. Local sequence alignments showed several distinguishing features between the plant and fungal kingdoms. Histidine box motifs that are believed to bind two active-site iron atoms and are critical to enzyme function (34Shanklin J. Whittle E. Fox B.G. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 12787-12794Crossref PubMed Scopus (638) Google Scholar, 35Avelange-Macherel M.H. Macherel D. Wada H. Murata N. FEBS Lett. 1995; 361: 111-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar) are present and are positionally conserved in translations of both Cf0745 (CfDES) and Cf0807 (CfACET) (Fig. 3). The i-1 position of motif Ia in most diverged desaturases (i.e. residue 108 in Cf0807) is Gly rather than Ala in stricto sensu desaturases (i.e. Cf0745). In His box motif Ib, the i-3 residue to the initial histidine is Arg in all fungal proteins but Lys in plants. Among the three His boxes, the only apparent structural correlation to acetylenase activity is in the i-5 to i-2 positions in box II, where (D/N)VX(H/N) occurs in all plant acetylenases and Cf0807 but not in other desaturase-like sequences. Hydropathy predictions strongly indicted that Cf0745 and Cf0807 have four potential helical transmembrane domains and putative KXKXX and KKXX ER retention sequences (36Rost B. Casadio R. Fariselli P. Sander C. Protein Sci. 1995; 4: 521-533Crossref PubMed Scopus (641) Google Scholar, 37Jackson M.R. Nilsson T. Peterson P.A. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 3153-3162Crossref PubMed Scopus (720) Google Scholar, 38Jackson M.R. Nilsson T. Peterson P.A. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 121: 317-333Crossref PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar). Based on this model, the His boxes are found near the predicted cytosolic face of the ER bilayer. We have explored the catalytic properties of the C. formosus predicted diverged desaturases through heterologous expression in S. cerevisiae. Our experience with Basidiomycete diverged desaturases indicates that an N-terminal hexahistidine tag results in increased levels of in vivo desaturation activity when compared with the untagged protein (28Minto R.E. Blacklock B.J. Younus H. Pratt A.C. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 2009; 75: 1156-1164Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar). We expressed both the untagged and the His6-tagged predicted diverged desaturases cloned from C. formosus and determined the temperature dependence of desaturase-product accumulation. Acid-catalyzed methanolysis of whole yeast preparations produced FAMEs that were analyzed by GC-MS. Expression of each untagged Cf0745 and Cf0807 and the His6 fusion proteins H6Cf0745 and H6Cf0807 resulted in the production of new fatty acids not present in the empty vector control (Table 1 and supplemental Table S2, A and B). Expression of H6CfDES and H6CfACET increased the doubling time compared with the empty vector control by 13 and 34%, respectively, at 15 °C. However, the fusion proteins resulted in significantly higher product accumulation (up to 4-fold greater for the dominant acyl products) than their untagged counterparts. Therefore, to more easily follow in vivo activity of Cf0745 and Cf0807, we conducted subsequent heterologous expression studies with the His6 fusion proteins.TABLE 1Effect of temperature on fatty acid desaturation activity of Cf0745 and Cf0807 on yeast total fatty acid composition in the heterologous expression of C. cibarius enzymes with no added fatty acid was determined by GC-MS analysis of FAMEsTemperatureConstructFatty acids16:016:116:218:018:118:2°C15pYES212.2 ± 0.957.7 ± 1.803.51 ± 0.2026.6 ± 0.802219.8 ± 0.552.9 ± 1.403.22 ± 0.1424.0 ± 0.803020.6 ± 0.844.3 ± 4.107.26 ± 1.9027.9 ± 1.4015H6Cf0745aFor diunsaturated lipids, Δ9c,12c.13.8 ± 1.545.9 ± 1.37.57 ± 0.734.32 ± 0.159.58 ± 0.218.9 ± 1.72221.2 ± 0.949.4 ± 1.53.31 ± 0.404.01 ± 0.2610.6 ± 0.511.4 ± 0.93018.0 ± 1.049.0 ± 1.30.61 ± 0.295.37 ± 0.0625.0 ± 1.01.90 ± 1.9915H6Cf0807bFor diunsaturated lipids, Δ9c,12t.11.8 ± 0.359.6 ± 0.63.02 ± 0.212.74 ± 0.1621.9 ± 0.20.90 ± 0.072219.9 ± 0.953.8 ± 2.00.64 ± 0.032.75 ± 0.2922.6 ± 0.80.30 ± 0.043017.6 ± 1.051.3 ± 0.604.56 ± 0.2326.5 ± 0.60a For diunsaturated lipids, Δ9c,12c.b For diunsaturated lipids, Δ9c,12t. Open table in a new tab Total ion chromatograms and mass spectra of the new fatty acids produced by Cf0745 and Cf0807 were consistent with 16:2 Δ9,12 and 18:2 Δ9,12, demonstrating that both of the predicted enzymes have Δ12 desaturation activity and are functionally related to the FAD2 family of desaturases, as suggested by the gene and protein alignments. H6Cf0745 was an extremely active desaturase with a preference for the C18 substrate producing almost 20% of the total fatty acids as 18:2 Δ9,12 and more than 7% 16:2 Δ9,12 at 15 °C. Close inspection of the retention times of the C16- and C18-diunsaturated products of H6Cf0807 (Fig. 4A) suggested that they were not identical to the H6Cf0745 products. Rather, the 16:2 and 18:2 products of H6Cf0807 were demonstrated to have exclusively the trans double bond configuration at the C12 position by separation of the stereoisomers with a specialized SP-2380 capillary GC column and co-elution of the H6Cf0807 16:2 and 18:2 products with authentic Δ9c,12t FAMEs prepared in our laboratory (data not shown). H6Cf0807 demonstrated a preference for the C16 substrate producing ∼3% 16:2 Δ9c,12t and 0.9% 18:2 Δ9c,12t at 15 °C (Table 1). Growth of the expression cultures at 15, 22, and 30 °C resulted in dramatic differences in the level of diunsaturated fatty acids for both H6Cf0745 and H6Cf0807 fusions (Table 1) and the untagged proteins (supplemental Table S2) with each showing substantially more activity at lower temperatures. H6Cf0745 desaturation products made up more than 26% of the total FAMEs at 15 °C compared with 2.5% at 30 °C. Similarly, H6Cf0807 products were almost 4% that of the total FAMEs at 15 °C and were not detectable at 30 °C (Table 1). This temperature dependence is consistent with plant FAD2 homologs when heterologously expressed in yeast (39Covello P.S. Reed D.W. Plant Physiol. 1996; 111: 223-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar); however, it is opposite that of another fungal desaturase that we recently described (PchFAD2) that demonstrated higher activity at 30 °C compared with 15 °C (28Minto R.E. Blacklock B.J. Younus H. Pratt A.C. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 2009; 75: 1156-1164Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar). To produce the accumulated natural product dehydrocrepenynic acid, chanterelle must have both FAD2/3 desaturase and acetylenase activities. The yeast expression of H6Cf0745 and H6Cf0807 establishes that H6Cf0745 is a classical FAD2 desaturase. The production of the trans Δ12 double bond by H6Cf0807 suggested that this enzyme is an acetylenase, as this activity has also been observed in the C. alpina acetylenase CREP1 (40Carlsson A.S. Thomaeus S. Hamberg M. Stymne S. Eur. J. Biochem. 2004; 271: 2991-2997Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). To test for acetylenase activity in the C. formosus FAD2 homologs, we supplemented yeast expressing H6Cf0745 or H6Cf0807 with 18:2 Δ9c,12c and analyzed FAMEs. In all cell lines the supplemented 18:2Δ9,12 composed >75% of the total FAMEs (Table 2). H6Cf0745 expression resulted in the production of only 16:2 Δ9,12 and 18:2 Δ9,12 (indicated by increased levels above the empty vector control) as seen in the non-supplemented cultures. However, expression of H6Cf0807 resulted in the production of crepenynic acid (18:1 Δ9c,12a) to >0.5% of the total FAMEs as determined by comparison of retention time and mass spectra with dimethyloxazoline and FAME authentic standards and literature data (Figs. 4B and supplemental Fig. S3) (15Cahoon E.B. Schnurr J.A. Huffman E.A. Minto R.E. Plant J. 2003; 34: 671-683Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 32Christie W.W. Chem. Phys. Lipids. 1998; 94: 35-41Crossref Scopus (37) Google Scholar). No C16 acetylenic fatty acid was detected. Supplementation with 18:2 Δ9c,12t, α-linolenic acid (18:3 Δ9,12,15), or γ-linolenic acid (18:3 Δ6,9,12) did not result in the production of new fatty acids (data not shown). Crepenynate supplementation of cultures at low concentrations to avoid its toxicity resulted in the production of another new fatty acid upon heterologous expression of H6Cf0745 (>3.2% of total FAMEs; Table 2). This fatty acid was determined by mass spectrometry of authentic dimethyloxazoline and FAME standards to be dehydrocrepenynic acid (supplemental Fig. S3) (15Cahoon E.B. Schnurr J.A. Huffman E.A. Minto R.E.

Open table in a new tab Metabolic channeling in dehydrocrepenynate biosynthesis between the desaturase and acetylenase enzymes was demonstrated by the co-expression of Cf0745 and Cf0807 in S. cerevisiae. When H6Cf0745 and H6Cf0807 were co-expressed from independent plasmids, the production of 18:2 Δ9c,12c, 18:1 Δ9c,12a, and 18:2 Δ9c,12a,14c from endogenous oleic acid was observed (Fig. 5). Channeling through the biosynthetic pathway from oleic to dehydrocrepenynic acid was more efficient than when each Cf0745 and Cf0807 were supplied substrates through media supplementation as demonstrated by the % conversion of 18:2 Δ9c,12c into 18:1 Δ9c,12a (0.67% for supplementation versus 1.51% conversion of enzymatically produced 18:2 Δ9c,12c) and the subsequent conversion of 18:1 Δ9c,12a to 18:2 Δ9c,12a,14c (20.9% versus 43%, respectively) (Table 3). The Δ12c desaturation efficiency ratio for C18 versus C16 substrates, and acetylenation/trans-desaturation ratio were 3.43 and 1.37, respectively, upon co-expression.TABLE 3Coexpression of C. formosus diverged desaturasesConstructsFatty acids16:016:116:2 Δ9c,12t16:2 Δ9c,12c18:018:118:2 Δ9c,12c18:1 Δ9c,12a18:2 Δ9c,12a,14cpYES2/pESc18.3 ± 1.443.0 ± 2.4NDND4.00 ± 0.2934.8 ± 2.3NDNDNDH6Cf0745/ H6Cf080720.1 ± 1.032.0 ± 1.43.56 ± 0.137.87 ± 1.36.1 ± 0.2811.0 ± 0.7818.9 ± 0.870.29 ± 0.060.22 ± 0.07 Open table in a new tab In this report we describe the cloning and functional characterization of two diverged desaturases from the Basidiomycete C. formosus and show that the production of dehydrocrepenynic acid from"
https://openalex.org/W2092838804,"Cell adhesion molecules and neurotrophin receptors are crucial for the development and the function of the nervous system. Among downstream effectors of neurotrophin receptors and recognition molecules are ion channels. Here, we provide evidence that G protein-coupled inwardly rectifying K(+) channel Kir3.3 directly binds to the neural cell adhesion molecule (NCAM) and neurotrophin receptor TrkB. We identified the binding sites for NCAM and TrkB at the C-terminal intracellular domain of Kir3.3. The interaction between NCAM, TrkB, and Kir3.3 was supported by immunocytochemical co-localization of Kir3.3, NCAM, and/or TrkB at the surface of hippocampal neurons. Co-expression of TrkB and Kir3.1/3.3 in Xenopus oocytes increased the K(+) currents evoked by Kir3.1/3.3 channels. This current enhancement was reduced by the concomitant co-expression with NCAM. Both surface fluorescence measurements of microinjected oocytes and cell surface biotinylation of transfected CHO cells indicated that the cell membrane localization of Kir3.3 is regulated by TrkB and NCAM. Furthermore, the level of Kir3.3, but not of Kir3.2, at the plasma membranes was reduced in TrkB-deficient mice, supporting the notion that TrkB regulates the cell surface expression of Kir3.3. The premature expression of developmentally late appearing Kir3.1/3.3 in hippocampal neurons led to a reduction of NCAM-induced neurite outgrowth. Our observations indicate a decisive role for the neuronal K(+) channel in regulating NCAM-dependent neurite outgrowth and attribute a physiologically meaningful role to the functional interplay of Kir3.3, NCAM, and TrkB in ontogeny."
https://openalex.org/W2005747896,"The functional activity of invasion-promoting membrane type 1 matrix metalloproteinase (MT1-MMP) is elevated in cancer. This elevated activity promotes cancer cell migration, invasion, and metastasis. MT1-MMP is synthesized as a zymogen, the latency of which is maintained by its prodomain. Excision by furin was considered sufficient for the prodomain release and MT1-MMP activation. We determined, however, that the full-length intact prodomain released by furin alone is a potent autoinhibitor of MT1-MMP. Additional MMP cleavages within the prodomain sequence are required to release the MT1-MMP enzyme activity. Using mutagenesis of the prodomain sequence and mass spectrometry analysis of the prodomain fragments, we demonstrated that the intradomain cleavage of the PGD/L(50) site initiates the MT1-MMP activation, whereas the (108)RRKR(111)/Y(112) cleavage by furin completes the removal and the degradation of the autoinhibitory prodomain and the liberation of the functional activity of the emerging enzyme of MT1-MMP."
https://openalex.org/W2141797304,"Localization of secreted matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) on the cell surface is required not only for processing of cell surface proteins, but also for controlled degradation of the extracellular matrix (ECM). Our previous study demonstrated that binding of MMP-7 (matrilysin) to cell surface cholesterol sulfate (CS) is essential for the cell membrane-associated proteolytic action of this MMP. In this study, we investigated the role of CS in the MMP-7-catalyzed degradation of protein components of ECM. We found that the degradation of laminin-332 (laminin-5) catalyzed by MMP-7 was accelerated dramatically in the presence of CS, whereas the sulfated lipid inhibited the degradation of casein catalyzed by the protease. The MMP-7-catalyzed degradation of fibronectin was partially inhibited in the presence of low concentrations of CS, whereas it was accelerated significantly at high concentrations of the lipid. Therefore, it is likely that CS alters the substrate preference of MMP-7. We also found that the proteins of which MMP-7-catalyzed degradation were accelerated by CS also had affinities for CS, suggesting that CS facilitates the proteolyses by cross-linking MMP-7 to its substrates. Moreover, MMP-7 tethered to cancer cell surface via CS degraded fibronectin and laminin-332 coated on a culture plate. The degradations of the adhesive proteins led to significant detachment of the cells from the plate. Taken together, our findings provide a novel mechanism in which cell surface CS promotes the proteolytic activities of MMP-7 toward selective substrates in the pericellular ECM, thereby contributing to cancer cell migration and metastasis."

https://openalex.org/W2065261206,"We showed previously that phosphorylation of Tyr53, or its mutation to Ala, inhibits actin polymerization in vitro with formation of aggregates of short filaments, and that expression of Y53A-actin in Dictyostelium blocks differentiation and development at the mound stage (Liu, X., Shu, S., Hong, M.

We now show that expression of Y53A-actin, which does not affect cell growth, phagocytosis, or pinocytosis, inhibits the formation of head-to-tail cell streams during cAMP-induced aggregation, although individual amoebae chemotax normally. We show that expression of Y53A-actin causes a 50% reduction of cell surface cAMP receptors, and inhibits cAMP-induced increases in adenylyl cyclase A activity, phosphorylation of ERK2, and actin polymerization. Trafficking of vesicles containing adenylyl cyclase A to the rear of the cell and secretion of the ACA vesicles are also inhibited. The actin cytoskeleton of cells expressing Y53A-actin is characterized by numerous short filaments, and bundled and aggregated filaments similar to the structures formed by copolymerization of purified Y53A-actin and wild-type actin in vitro.

Dictyostelium discoideum grows as single-cell amoebae on yeast, bacteria, or soluble medium with a generation time in liquid medium of about 8–12 h. Starvation initiates a 24-h developmental cycle, beginning with pulsed secretion of cAMP by a fraction of the amoebae creating cAMP gradients, which induce neighboring cells to polarize and chemotax toward these signaling/aggregation centers (1Chisholm R.L. Firtel R.A. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2004; 5: 531-541Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). The chemotaxing cells, in turn, are stimulated to synthesize and secrete cAMP, thereby relaying the cAMP signal to more distant cells in spatial and temporal waves formed by the pulsed secretion of cAMP and its degradation by extracellular phosphodiesterase (2Weijer C.J. J. Cell Sci. 2009; 122: 3215-3223Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). Head-to-tail streams of chemotaxing cells migrate to the aggregation centers forming mounds composed of 100,000–200,000 cells, which differentiate into pre-stalk and pre-spore cells. The mounds transform, in several stages, into motile, multicellular slugs with the pre-stalk cells in their anterior and the pre-spore cells in their posterior. The slugs migrate until culmination is initiated with the pre-stalk cells forming a stalk rising from a basal disc anchored on the substratum, and the pre-spore cells moving up to the top of the stalk to form a fruiting body containing mature spores. Once favorable conditions arise, or when spores are placed in nutrient medium, the spores germinate and the life cycle starts again. The actin cytoskeleton has critical roles in all stages of the life cycle. For example, actin, which is generally uniformly distributed around the cell cortex of vegetative (growing) cells, becomes enriched in the cleavage furrow of dividing cells where actomyosin II is required for cytokinesis of cells grown in suspension culture (3DeLozanne A. Spudich J.A. Science. 1987; 236: 1086-1091Crossref PubMed Scopus (763) Google Scholar, 4Knecht D.A. Loomis W.F.

Cell. 1997; 8: 2617-2629Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Actin also has an essential role in phagocytosis, macropinocytosis, and formation of filopodia and pseudopodia in vegetative amoebae (7Noegel A.A. Schleicher M. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 759-766Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The motility of polarized, chemotaxing amoebae is driven by waves of actin polymerization in the lamellipodia at the leading edge, which is correlated with the cAMP waves (8Condeelis J. Hall A. Bresnick A. Warren V. Hock R. Bennett H. Ogihara S. Cell Motil. Cytoskeleton. 1988; 10: 77-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 9Vicker M.G. Grutsch J.F. Eur. J.

McNally J.G. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 1309-1323Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Actin Tyr53 becomes phosphorylated halfway (12 h) into the developmental cycle, reaching a maximum of ∼50% phosphorylated actin in mature spores (∼36 h), and rapid dephosphorylation precedes germination when spores are placed in growth medium (11Gauthier M.L.

Tyr53 phosphorylation also occurs when vegetative cells are grown to high concentration or subjected to stress (15Schweiger A. Mihalache O. Ecke M. Gerisch G. J.

The physiological function of Tyr53-phosphorylated actin is not known. In previous papers (14Liu X. Shu S. Hong M.S. Levine R.L. Korn E.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

U.S.A. 2008; 105: 11748-11753Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar), we reported some of the biochemical and biophysical differences between phosphorylated and unphosphorylated actin. Briefly, the phosphate group on Tyr53 of phosphorylated actin hydrogen bonds with amino acids in and near the DNase I-binding loop of actin (residues 40–50) partially stabilizing the conformation of the D-loop, 2The abbreviations used are: D-loopDNase I-binding loopACAadenylyl cyclase AcARcAMP receptorpERK2phospho-ERK2PBphosphate bufferWTendogenous wild-type actinF-Y/Aexpressed FLAG-tagged actin with Y53A mutationF-Y/Yexpressed FLAG-tagged wild-type actinF-TEVCSFLAG-tobacco etch virus protease cleavage siteTORCtarget of rapopmycin complex 2TRITCtetramethylrhodamine isothiocyanate. which significantly inhibits the rate of actin polymerization, increases actin critical concentration, and leads to the formation of fragmented filaments. More recently, to determine whether these differences are due to the addition of phosphate or to the loss of Tyr, we studied the biochemical and biophysical properties of purified Y53F-, Y53A-, and Y53E-actin mutants expressed in and purified from Dictyostelium (20Liu X. Shu S. Hong M.S. Yu B. Korn E.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2010; 285: 9729-9739Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). In brief, we found no difference between Y53F-actin and endogenous wild-type actin, but the Y53A- and Y53E-actins differed substantially from WT-actin: the affinity for DNase I was reduced, the rate of nucleotide exchange was increased, filament elongation was inhibited, the critical concentration was increased, and polymerized actin was in the form of small oligomers and imperfect filaments. We concluded that Tyr or Phe at position 53, but not Ala or Glu, maintains the functional conformations of the D-loop that are required not only for interaction with DNase I, but for the interactions between actin subunits in F-actin (21Holmes K.C.

To facilitate their purification and separation from endogenous actin, the expressed mutant actins in the previous experiments had an N-terminal FLAG tag, with a tobacco etch virus protease cleavage site between the FLAG tag and the actin N terminus for removal of the FLAG tag after purification of the actins. We noted that the amoebae expressing the F-TEVCS-Y53A-actin (to the extent of 30% of total actin) developed more slowly and did not develop beyond the mound stage. We now report in detail the effects of expression of the Y53A-actin mutant on cell growth, phagocytosis, pinocytosis, cell streaming in a cAMP gradient, and morphological and biochemical development. These results may be informative on the role of Tyr53-phosphorylated actin in development and the reaction to stress. Dictyostelium actin cDNA (a generous gift of G. Gerisch, Max Planck-Institute für Biochemie, Martinsried, Germany) was mutated at position Tyr53 to Ala by PCR. A FLAG sequence (DYKDDDDK) was added to the N terminus of the mutant actin (F-Y/A), and also to WT-actin (F-Y/Y) as a control for possible effects of the FLAG tag. Actin cDNAs were cloned onto a pTIKL vector, which has an actin 15 promoter and G-418 resistance (23Liu X. Ito K. Lee R.J. Uyeda T.Q. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 271: 75-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Expression plasmids were introduced into Dictyostelium AX3 cells using a gene pulser (Bio-Rad) (24Egelhoff T.T. Brown S.S. Spudich J.A. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 112: 677-688Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). For coexpression of actin and ACA in aca− cells, the actin and promoter sequences amplified by PCR from pTIKL F-Y/Y-actin and pTIKL F-Y/A-actin were subcloned into pCV5 using restriction enzymes XbaI and BglII and the sequences were confirmed. Then equal amounts of pCV5 ACA-YFP (25Kriebel P.W. Barr V.A. Parent C.A.

Dictyostelium AX3 cells were grown at 21 °C in HL5 medium (number LG0101, Formedium) containing 60 μg/ml each of penicillin and streptomycin (26Sussman M. Methods Cell Biol. 1987; 28: 9-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (533) Google Scholar), and cells transformed with cDNAs (with and without an N-terminal FLAG tag) were selected and maintained in the same medium containing 16 μg/ml of G418 (number 61-234-RG, Cellgro). Cells were differentiated to the chemotaxis-competent stage as described (27Devreotes P. Fontana D. Klein P. Sherring J. Theibert A.

Cell. 1998; 95: 81-91Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (506) Google Scholar). Briefly, log-phase cells (∼2 × 106 cells/ml) were harvested by low-speed centrifugation, washed, and re-suspended in developmental buffer (5 mm Na2HPO4, 5 mm KH2PO4, pH 6.2, 2 mm Mg2SO4, 0.2 mm CaCl2) at 2 × 107 cells/ml (25Kriebel P.W. Barr V.A. Parent C.A. Cell. 2003; 112: 549-560Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar), and developed in suspension at 100 rpm for 5–6 h with pulses of 50 μl of 4 μm cAMP into 5 ml of cells every 6 min. Differentiated cells were processed according to the assay to be performed. To measure cell growth, 50 ml of cells (2 × 105 cells/ml) were cultured in a 250-ml flask on a rotary shaker at 145 rpm and 21 °C, and cells were counted daily using a cellometer (AutoT4 cell count, Nexcelom Bioscience). Phagocytosis and pinocytosis assays were performed as described (29Maniak M. Rauchenberger R. Albrecht R. Murphy J. Gerisch G. Cell. 1995; 83: 915-924Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar) with some modification (30Shu S. Liu X. Parent C.A. Uyeda T.Q. Korn E.D. J. Cell Sci. 2002; 115: 4237-4249Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). For phagocytosis, cells were collected, washed, and re-suspended at 5 × 106/ml in Sorenson's buffer (17 mm KH2PO4, 2 mm Na2HPO4, pH 6.1), and fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated, 1-μm polystyrene-latex beads (Polysciences) were added at a ratio of 300 beads per cell. For pinocytosis, cells were harvested, re-suspended in HL5 medium at 5 × 106/ml, and TRITC-dextran (Sigma) was added to a final concentration of 2 mg/ml. In both the phagocytosis and pinocytosis assays, 1-ml samples were transferred to a 1.5-ml tube containing 100 μl of 0.4% trypan blue (to quench background fluorescence), the tubes were vortexed and centrifuged at 2,800 rpm for 3 min, and the pellets were washed and re-suspended in 1 ml of Sorenson's buffer. Fluorescence was measured with excitation and emission wavelengths of 485 and 520 nm, respectively, for the phagocytosis assay, and 544 and 574 nm, respectively, for the pinocytosis assay using an LS55 Luminescence spectrometer (PerkinElmer). All assays were repeated at least three times. Indirect immunofluorescence microscopy was performed as described (31Shu S. Liu X. Korn E.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2005; 102: 1472-1477Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). For colocalization of total actin and expressed FLAG-actins, cells were fixed with 1% formaldehyde, 0.1% glutaraldehyde, and 0.01% Triton X-100 in 5 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 6.2, at room temperature for 15 min, washed and incubated for 60 min at 37 °C with 100-fold diluted rabbit anti-actin (number A-2066, Sigma) and 500-fold diluted anti-FLAG M2 antibody (number F-3165, Sigma) in PB supplemented with 1% bovine serum albumin and 0.2% saponin. Secondary antibodies, FITC-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG and Texas Red-goat anti-rabbit IgG (Molecular Probes) were diluted 750-fold. Images were acquired with an LSM-510 laser scanning fluorescence microscope (Carl Zeiss). For immunolocalization during chemotaxis and streaming, cells were first differentiated for 5–6 h, and then extensively washed with PB, placed on a chambered coverslip, and fixed when they had polarized or formed streams. To examine self-streaming, cells were harvested, re-suspended at 5 × 106/ml in HL5 medium, and 1.5 × 107 cells were plated on 60-mm Petri dishes and allowed to adhere for 30 min (30Shu S. Liu X. Parent C.A. Uyeda T.Q. Korn E.D. J. Cell Sci. 2002; 115: 4237-4249Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). The medium was then removed by aspiration, the cells were carefully washed twice with starvation buffer (20 mm MES, pH 6.8, 0.2 mm CaCl2, 2 mm MgSO4), and 2 ml of the same buffer was carefully applied to the plates. Aggregation and streaming were visualized 6–8 h after plating. Images of self-streaming cells were taken every minute with a Discovery V12 stereo microscope (Carl Zeiss) equipped with a PlanApos ×1.0 objective and an AxioCam camera automated by AxioVision 4 software. Development was observed 24 or 72 h after cells were spotted on 1.5% agarose plates in starvation buffer. Results were recorded with the same stereo microscope used to visualize self-streaming. The micropipette assay of cAMP-induced Dictyostelium chemotaxis was performed as described (28Parent C.A. Blacklock B.J. Froehlich W.M. Murphy D.B. Devreotes P.N. Cell. 1998; 95: 81-91Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (506) Google Scholar). Cells were starved for 5–7 h to induce differentiation to the chemotaxis stage and then re-suspended in PB on a chambered coverslip. A chemoattractant gradient was generated with a microinjector (Eppendorf) attached to a micropipette filled with 1 μm cAMP. Chemotactic migration was continuously recorded at intervals of 10 s using an Axiovert 200 inverted microscope and Axiovision software (Carl Zeiss), and processed with Metamorph software. To obtain chemotactic metrics, 200 or more cells were analyzed. Images were binarized using the ImageJ software 3W. S. Rasband, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD. by subtracting the background using a rolling ball algorithm and then thresholding. Tracking cell centers-of-mass was carried out using custom MATLAB code (The Mathworks, Natick, MA). Velocities were determined by dividing cell displacements by the time interval, and velocities were only counted when there was a net displacement of at least 20 μm over a 5-min period. The instantaneous chemotactic index is defined as the cosine of the angle between the vector from a cell center in the current frame to its center in the next frame and the vector from the cell center to the pipette tip. Mixed cell experiments were performed as previously described (25Kriebel P.W. Barr V.A. Parent C.A. Cell. 2003; 112: 549-560Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Briefly, differentiated F-Y/Y or F-Y/A cells (2 × 107 cells/ml) were mixed at a 9:1 ratio with GFP-labeled aca− cells, and the mixtures were diluted 1:10 in PB, pH 6.2, and spotted on a chambered slide. A micropipette containing 10 μm cAMP was placed into the chamber. As the cells migrated toward the micropipette tip, fluorescence and bright field images were captured every 10 s using an Axiovert 200 inverted microscope (Carl Zeiss) and Axiovision software (Carl Zeiss). For actin, SDS-PAGE was performed by standard procedures (32Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207538) Google Scholar) using Tris glycine gels (Invitrogen). Gels were stained with Coomassie Blue or immunoblotted, and then quantified with the Odyssey infrared imaging system (Li-COR Biosciences). Dilution of primary antibodies was 1,000-fold for rabbit anti-actin (number A-2066, Sigma) and 4,000-fold for anti-FLAG M2 (number F-3165, Sigma). Secondary antibodies, goat IRDye800, anti-rabbit IgG (Rockland Immunochemicals), and Alexa Fluor 680 goat anti-mouse IgG (Molecular Probes), were diluted 1:7,000. For ACA, cAR1, and ERK2, cell lysates were subjected to 10% and 7.5% acetate SDS-PAGE analysis (32Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207538) Google Scholar) using the Bio-Rad Criterion gel system and transferred to Immuno-Blot PVDF membrane (Bio-Rad).

Cells were then washed twice with PB to remove the caffeine, and re-suspended at a concentration of 5 × 107 cells/ml in ice-cold PB containing 2 mm MgSO4. Aliquots of 2 ml were placed in small plastic cups that were rotated at 200 rpm for 1.5 min, and the cells were stimulated by adding 20 μl of cAMP to final concentrations of 100 nm and 10 μm.

Adenylyl cyclase activity was assayed at room temperature before and after the addition of 10 μm cAMP. Dictyostelium FLAG-tagged actins were purified by FLAG affinity chromatography on an anti-FLAG antibody-conjugated resin (Sigma) eluted with 0.1 mg/ml of FLAG-peptide (EZ Biolab, Inc.) as described (45Shu S. Liu X. Korn E.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2003; 100: 6499-6504Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar).

Chem. 2010; 285: 9729-9739Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Purified actins were dialyzed against G-buffer (4 mm Tris, 0.1 mm CaCl2, 0.2 mm ATP, 1 mm DTT, pH 7.5) overnight, centrifuged at 100,000 rpm for 2 h at 4 °C in a Beckman TL-100 centrifuge, and used immediately. Dictyostelium myosin II and regulatory light chain kinase were purified as described (23Liu X. Ito K. Lee R.J. Uyeda T.Q. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 271: 75-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). The myosin II regulatory light chain was phosphorylated by addition of the kinase (20 μg/ml), and incubating overnight at 4 °C. Dictyostelium myosin II S1 was expressed and purified as described (46Liu X. Shu S. Kovács M. Korn E.D. J. Biol.

Actin concentration was determined by absorption at 290 nm using an extinction coefficient of 0.62 cm2/mg. Actins at the indicated concentrations in G-buffer were polymerized at 22 °C by adding KCl and MgCl2 to final concentrations of 100 and 2 mm, respectively. Polymerization was measured by right angle light scattering in an LS55 Luminescence spectrometer (PerkinElmer) with both excitation and emission wavelengths of 360 nm and a slit width of 4 nm. Critical concentrations were determined by incubating various concentrations of actin at room temperature overnight in G-buffer plus 100 mm KCl and 2 mm MgCl2.

Actin, 5 μm, was polymerized at room temperature for 3–5 h by addition of MgCl2 to 2 mm and rhodamine-phalloidin to 5 μm, and kept on ice until use. Negatively stained images of actin filaments were obtained as described by Liu et al. (14Liu X. Shu S. Hong M.S. Levine R.L. Korn E.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

One drop of the filament suspension (0.1 mg/ml) was placed on a formvar/carbon-coated 400-mesh copper grid and excess fluid was removed by filter paper. The grid was negatively stained with one drop of 0.5% aqueous uranyl acetate for 30 s, and excess fluid absorbed on filter paper. The images were observed with a JEM-1200EX II transmission electron microscope (JEOL).

https://openalex.org/W2036974039,"Membrane type 1-matrix metalloproteinase (MT1-MMP, MMP14), which is associated with extracellular matrix (ECM) breakdown in squamous cell carcinoma (SCC), promotes tumor formation and epithelial-mesenchymal transition. However, in this report we demonstrate that MT1-MMP, by cleaving the underlying ECM, causes cellular aggregation of keratinocytes and SCC cells. Treatment with an MMP inhibitor abrogated MT1-MMP-induced phenotypic changes, but decreasing E-cadherin expression did not affect MT1-MMP-induced cellular aggregation. As ROCK1/2 can regulate cell-cell and cell-ECM interaction, we examined its role in mediating MT1-MMP-induced phenotypic changes. Blocking ROCK1/2 expression or activity abrogated the cellular aggregation resulting from MT1-MMP expression. Additionally, blocking Rho and non-muscle myosin attenuated MT1-MMP-induced phenotypic changes. Moreover, SCC cells expressing only the catalytically active MT1-MMP protein demonstrated increased cellular aggregation and increased myosin II activity in vivo when injected subcutaneously into nude mice. Together, these results demonstrate that expression of MT1-MMP may be anti-tumorigenic in keratinocytes by promoting cellular aggregation."
https://openalex.org/W1999230108,"System l-amino acid transporters (LAT) belong to the amino acid, polyamine, and organic cation superfamily of transporters and include the light subunits of heteromeric amino acid transporters and prokaryotic homologues. Cysteine reactivity of SteT (serine/threonine antiporter) has been used here to study the substrate-binding site of LAT transporters. Residue Cys-291, in transmembrane domain 8 (TM8), is inactivated by thiol reagents in a substrate protectable manner. Surprisingly, DTT activated the transporter by reducing residue Cys-291. Cysteine-scanning mutagenesis of TM8 showed DTT activation in the single-cysteine mutants S287C, G294C, and S298C, lining the same alpha-helical face. S-Thiolation in Escherichia coli cells resulted in complete inactivation of the single-cysteine mutant G294C. l-Serine blocked DTT activation with an EC(50) similar to the apparent K(M) of this mutant. Thus, S-thiolation abolished substrate translocation but not substrate binding. Mutation of Lys-295, to Cys (K295C) broadened the profile of inhibitors and the spectrum of substrates with the exception of imino acids. A structural model of SteT based on the structural homologue AdiC (arginine/agmatine antiporter) positions residues Cys-291 and Lys-295 in the putative substrate binding pocket. All this suggests that Lys-295 is a main determinant in the recognition of the side chain of SteT substrates. In contrast, Gly-294 is not facing the surface, suggesting conformational changes involving TM8 during the transport cycle. Our results suggest that TM8 sculpts the substrate-binding site and undergoes conformational changes during the transport cycle of SteT."
https://openalex.org/W2087703876,"In the vertebrate central nervous system, maturation of oligodendrocytes is accompanied by a dramatic transformation of cell morphology. Juxtanodin (JN) is an actin cytoskeleton-related oligodendroglial protein that promotes arborization of cultured oligodendrocytes. We performed in vitro and in culture experiments to further elucidate the biochemical effects, molecular interactions, and activity regulation of JN. Pulldown and co-sedimentation assays confirmed JN binding to filamentous but not globular beta-actin largely through a C-terminal domain of 14 amino acid residues. JN had much lower affinity to F-alpha-actin than to F-beta-actin. Bundling and actin polymerization assays revealed no JN influence on F-beta-actin cross-linking or G-beta-actin polymerization. Sedimentation assay, however, demonstrated that JN slowed the rate of F-beta-actin disassembly induced by dilution with F-actin depolymerization buffer. JN-S278E mutant, a mimic of phosphorylated JN at serine 278, exhibited a much diminished affinity/stabilizing effect on F-beta-actin. Immunoblotting revealed both phosphorylated and dephosphorylated native JN of the brain, with the former migrating slightly slower than the latter and becoming undetectable when brain lysate was subjected to in vitro dephosphorylation prior to being loaded for electrophoresis. In cultured OLN-93 cells, overexpression of JN promoted the formation of actin fibers and inhibited F-actin disassembly induced by latrunculin A. S278E phosphomimetic mutation resulted in loss of JN activity in cultured cells, whereas S278A, T258A, and T258E dephospho-/phosphomimetic mutations did not. These findings establish JN as an actin cytoskeleton-stabilizing protein that may play active roles in oligodendroglial differentiation and myelin formation. Specific phosphorylation of JN might serve as an important mechanism regulating JN functions."
