We report here that DNA damage stimuli, including etoposide (ETOP), adriamycin (ADR), ionizing irradiation (IR), and ultraviolet irradiation (UV) activate ERK1/2 (ERK) mitogen-activated protein kinase in primary (MEF and IMR90), immortalized (NIH3T3) and transformed (MCF-7) cells. ERK activation in response to ETOP was abolished in ATM−/− fibroblasts (GM05823) and was independent of p53. The MEK1 inhibitor PD98059 prevented ERK activation but not p53 stabilization. Maximal ERK activation in response to DNA damage was not attenuated in MEFp53−/−. However, ERK activation contributes to either cell cycle arrest or apoptosis in response to low or high intensity DNA insults, respectively. Inhibition of ERK activation by PD98059 or U0126 attenuated p21CIP1 induction, resulting in partial release of the G2/M cell cycle arrest induced by ETOP. Furthermore, PD98059 or U0126 also strongly attenuated apoptosis induced by high dose ETOP, ADR, or UV. Conversely, enforced activation of ERK by overexpression of MEK-1/Q56P sensitized cells to DNA damage-induced apoptosis. Taken together, these results indicate that DNA damage activates parallel ERK and p53 pathways in an ATM-dependent manner. These pathways might function cooperatively in cell cycle arrest and apoptosis. In response to DNA damage, ataxia-telangiectasia mutant and ataxia-telangiectasia and Rad-3 activate p53, resulting in either cell cycle arrest or apoptosis. We report here that DNA damage stimuli, including etoposide (ETOP), adriamycin (ADR), ionizing irradiation (IR), and ultraviolet irradiation (UV) activate ERK1/2 (ERK) mitogen-activated protein kinase in primary (MEF and IMR90), immortalized (NIH3T3) and transformed (MCF-7) cells.

Critical surveillance of this transmission is provided by the DNA damage response, which may arrest the cell cycle to allow damage repair or direct cells to apoptosis in situations of severe damage (1.Lowe S.W.

Our understanding of how cells sense DNA damage remains incomplete, but it is clear that two members of the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)1 family, ATM and ATR, are major DNA damage signal transducers (4.Zhou B.B. Elledge S.J. Nature. 2000; 408: 433-439Crossref PubMed Scopus (2596) Google Scholar). Downstream of ATM/ATR lies p53, a central mediator of the response, which in turn induces cell cycle arrest by up-regulation of p21CIP1 and 14-3-3ς, activates DNA damage repair pathways, and induces apoptosis (5.Caspari T. Curr. Biol. 2000; 10: R315-R317Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar, 6.Colman M.S. Afshari C.A. Barrett J.C. Mutat. Res. 2000; 462: 179-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). p53 is normally rapidly degraded by Mdm2-mediated ubiquitin-dependent proteolysis (7.Haupt Y. Maya R. Kazaz A. Oren M. Nature. 1997; 387: 296-299Crossref PubMed Scopus (3629) Google Scholar, 8.Kubbutat M.H. Jones S.N. Vousden K.H. Nature. 1997; 387: 299-303Crossref PubMed Scopus (2798) Google Scholar). In response to DNA damage, p53 is stabilized by inhibition of this proteolytic process, partly through post-translational phosphorylation. Stabilization of p53 by phosphorylation on residues Ser-15 and Ser-21 by ATM and Chk2 kinase in response to DNA damage is well described (9.Banin S. Moyal L. Shieh S. Taya Y. Anderson C.W. Chessa L.

Mak T.W. Science. 2000; 287: 1824-1827Crossref PubMed Scopus (1032) Google Scholar). Members of the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) family have also been demonstrated to phosphorylate and stabilize p53 (12.Fuchs S.Y. Adler V. Buschmann T. Yin Z. Wu X. Jones S.N. Ronai Z. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 2658-2663Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar, 13.Huang C. Ma W.Y. Maxiner A. Sun Y. Dong Z. J. Biol.

Res. Commun. 1999; 261: 464-471Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). To wit, activation of JNK leads to p53 phosphorylation, thus interfering with the association of Mdm2 and p53 (12.Fuchs S.Y. Adler V. Buschmann T. Yin Z. Wu X. Jones S.N. Ronai Z. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 2658-2663Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar). Furthermore, activation of p38 MAPK by UV was shown to phosphorylate p53 on S389 (13.Huang C. Ma W.Y. Maxiner A. Sun Y.

Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 261: 464-471Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). The third member of the canonical MAPK family, ERK (extracellular signal-regulated kinase), is centered on multiple signal transduction pathways to accomplish a variety of functions. Activation of ERK through different pathways leads to fundamentally different cellular responses, including proliferation, differentiation, survival, and memory consolidation (15.Bergmann A. Agapite J. McCall K. Steller H. Cell. 1998; 95: 331-341Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (400) Google Scholar, 16.Impey S. Obrietan K. Storm D.R.

Cell. 1998; 95: 295-298Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). ERK activation by extracellular growth signals is mediated through growth factor tyrosine phosphorylation and activation of a small G protein, Ras, and promotes cell proliferation (20.McCormick F. Nature. 1993; 363: 15-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (439) Google Scholar, 21.Moodie S.A. Wolfman A. Trends Genet. 1994; 10: 44-48Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). The importance of ERK in transduction of mitogenic signals is illustrated by the demonstration that activation of ERK is sufficient to transform NIH3T3 cells or MEF lacking either p53 or p16 (22.Cowley S. Paterson H. Kemp P. Marshall C.J. Cell. 1994; 77: 841-852Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1844) Google Scholar, 23.Lin A.W. Barradas M. Stone J.C. van Aelst L. Serrano M. Lowe S.W. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 3008-3019Crossref PubMed Scopus (751) Google Scholar). In some circumstances, ligand interactions with growth factor receptors may result in ERK-mediated cell cycle exit. Indeed, ERK activation by nerve growth factor drives PC12 cell differentiation (22.Cowley S. Paterson H. Kemp P. Marshall C.J. Cell. 1994; 77: 841-852Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1844) Google Scholar, 24.Marshall C.J. Cell. 1995; 80: 179-185Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4213) Google Scholar). ERK may function in the response to DNA damage. ERK activation was observed in response to cisplatin in ovarian cancer cells (25.Persons D.L. Yazlovitskaya E.M. Pelling J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 35778-35785Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar). ERK can phosphorylate p53 in vitro (25.Persons D.L. Yazlovitskaya E.M. Pelling J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 35778-35785Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar), but its role in vivo is unclear (25.Persons D.L. Yazlovitskaya E.M. Pelling J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 35778-35785Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar, 26.Lee S.W. Fang L. Igarashi M. Ouchi T. Lu K.P. Aaronson S.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Chem. 2000; 275: 20444-20449Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar). The role of DNA damage-induced ERK activation in mediating apoptosis has also not been clarified (28.MacKeigan J.P. Collins T.S. Ting J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 38953-38956Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar, 29.Wang X. Martindale J.L. Holbrook N.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 39435-39443Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (594) Google Scholar). In this regard, however, tumors with constitutive ERK activation undergo apoptosis when ERK activity is blocked (30.Hoshino R. Tanimura S. Watanabe K. Kataoka T. Kohno M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 2686-2692Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). Consequently, we sought to explore ERK activation in response to DNA damage, and to outline the mechanisms and consequences of such activation. We report here that multiple DNA damage stimuli, including etoposide (ETOP), adriamycin (ADR), ultraviolet irradiation (UV), and ionizing radiation (IR) activate ERK in various cell lines. We show that this process depends on ATM and is independent of p53. Functionally, we demonstrate that ERK activation cooperates with p53 to lead to apoptosis or cell cycle arrest. This represents the first report to fully outline an ERK-mediated DNA damage pathway and its functional importance. Hoechst 33258, propidium iodide, ETOP, ADR, hydroxyurea, and wortmannin were from Sigma Chemical Co. The MEK1 inhibitors, PD98059 and U0126, were from Calbiochem and Promega, respectively. Stocks of ETOP, ADR, wortmannin, PD98059, and U0126 were made in Me2SO and used at the concentrations indicated. Hygromycin B was from Invitrogen. NIH3T3 and MCF7 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (Invitrogen) at 37 °C in a tissue culture incubator. MEF were isolated and cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, 10% FCS, 55 μmβ-mercaptoethanol, and 10 μg/ml gentamicin. IMR-90 was from ATCC and cultured in MEM and 10% FCS. The AT fibroblast line, GM05823, was from the NIGMS Human Genetic Cell Repository and cultured in MEM, 10% FCS, with 2× concentrated essential and non-essential amino acids and vitamins. The constitutively activated MEK1/Q56P cloned in the retroviral vector, pBabe, was kindly provided by Dr. Scott Lowe of Cold Spring Harbor Laboratories (23.Lin A.W. Barradas M. Stone J.C. van Aelst L. Serrano M. Lowe S.W. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 3008-3019Crossref PubMed Scopus (751) Google Scholar). pBabe/Bcl-2 and pBabe/Bcl-xL were constructed by insertion of human Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL into pBabe as we have published previously (31.Tang D. Lahti J.M. Kidd V.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 9303-9307Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar). Retroviral infection was performed as we have shown previously (31.Tang D. Lahti J.M. Kidd V.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 9303-9307Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar, 32.Tang D. Okada H. Ruland J. Liu L. Stambolic V. Mak T.W. Ingram A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 30461-30466Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Constructs were subcloned into a retroviral vector. Plasmid DNA was isolated and used to generate retrovirus using phoenix packing cells. Briefly, 5 × 106 phoenix cells were seeded in a 10-cm plate overnight before transfection with 15 μg of retroviral vector for 48 h. The virus-containing medium was harvested after 48 h and filtered through a 0.45-μm filter. After addition of 10 μg/ml Polybrene (Sigma), the medium was used to infect NIH3T3 cells three times for 24 h at 8-h intervals to maximize transfection rate. Expression was confirmed with Western blot. After exposure to DNA damage agents as indicated, cells were lysed in a buffer containing 20 mm Tris (pH 7.4), 150 mm NaCl, 1 mmEDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 1% Triton X-100, 25 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 1 mm NaF, 1 mmβ-glycerophosphate, 0.1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 2 μg/ml leupeptin, and 10 μg/ml aprotinin. 50 μg of total cell lysate was separated on SDS-PAGE gel and transferred onto Immobilon-P membranes (Millipore). Membranes were blocked with 5% skim milk and then incubated with the indicated antibodies at room temperature for 1 h. Signals were detected using an ECL Western blotting Kit (Amersham Biosciences, Inc.). Primary antibodies and concentration used were: anti-ATM (Ab-3 at 2 μg/ml, Oncogene); anti-p53 (FL-353 at 1 μg/ml, Santa Cruz Biotechnology); anti-phospho-p53(S15) (Cell Signaling, 1:1000); anti-ERK (1:500, New England BioLabs); anti-phospho-ERK (1:500 New England BioLabs); anti-Actin (Santa Cruz Biotechnology); and anti-p21CIP1 (1 μg/ml, Santa Cruz Biotechnology). DNA fragmentation and TUNEL assay were performed as we have previously published (31.Tang D. Lahti J.M. Kidd V.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 9303-9307Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar, 32.Tang D. Okada H. Ruland J. Liu L. Stambolic V. Mak T.W. Ingram A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 30461-30466Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar, 33.Tang D. Kidd V.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 28549-28552Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). For the cell viability assays, 2 × 104 cells were seeded in 96-well plates and incubated at 37 °C for 4 h. Cells were then treated with DNA damage stimuli as indicated with or without PD98059 (50 μm) or U0126 (10 or 50 μm) for the indicated times. WST-1 cell proliferation reagent (Roche Diagnostics, Mannheim, Germany) 10 μl/100 μl medium was added, and cells were incubated for 30 min at 37 °C. Viable cell numbers were determined at 450 nm with a microplate reader (Fisher Diagnostics). Cell cycle distribution was determined by staining NIH3T3 cells with propidium iodide solution in the presence of RNase A overnight at 4 °C followed by detection of signals using fluorescent automated cell sorting (FACS) as we have published previously (11.Hirao A. Kong Y.Y. Matsuoka S. Wakeham A. Ruland J. Yoshida H. Liu D. Elledge S.J. Mak T.W. Science. 2000; 287: 1824-1827Crossref PubMed Scopus (1032) Google Scholar). Cells were grown to 80% confluence on a glass slip. After treatment with ETOP at the indicated concentrations for 30 min, nocodazole (200 ng/ml) was added. After 12, 18, 24, and 30 h, cells were fixed in 3.7% formaldehyde and stored at 4 °C for 24 h. Cells were then permeabilized in a Triton X-100-containing solution and stained with Hoechst 33258 DNA stain (10 μg/ml, Molecular Probes). The mitotic index was scored under a fluorescence microscope. To determine whether ERK is activated by DNA damage signals, early passage MEF cells were treated with ETOP, which induces double-strand DNA breaks by interfering with the function of DNA topoisomerase II (34.O'Dwyer P.J. Leyland-Jones B. Alonso M.T. Marsoni S. Wittes R.E. N. Engl. J. Med. 1985; 312: 692-700Crossref PubMed Scopus (335) Google Scholar). As expected, ETOP induced stabilization of p53 and up-regulation of p21CIP1 (data not shown). ETOP induced ERK activation (as measured by phosphorylation) with two phases (Fig. 1A). The first phase of ERK activation starts at 1 h and ends at 8 h of ETOP exposure, whereas the second takes place after 15 h in response to ETOP (Fig. 1A). Increasing ETOP concentrations resulted in increasing levels of ERK activation with maximal ERK activation observed at or higher than 25 μm (data not shown), indicating a correlation between intensity of DNA damage and level of ERK activation. To determine whether ERK activation is a unique property of ETOP or MEF cells, we used multiple DNA damage stimuli to initiate ERK activation. ETOP, ADR, and UV led to ERK activation in primary (MEF), immortalized (NIH3T3), and transformed (MCF7) cells (Fig. 1B). Additionally, IR and hydroxyurea also activated ERK in MEF and IMR90 (data not shown), confirming that DNA damage indeed leads to ERK activation. Because ERK activation is known to require dual phosphorylation on Thr-183 and Tyr-185 by MEKs (35.Payne D.M. Rossomando A.J. Martino P. Erickson A.K. Her J.H. Shabanowitz J. Hunt D.F. Weber M.J. Sturgill T.W. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 885-892Crossref PubMed Scopus (835) Google Scholar, 36.Robbins D.J. Zhen E. Owaki H. Vanderbilt C.A. Ebert D. Geppert T.D. Cobb M.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 5097-5106Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), we sought to determine whether DNA damage-induced ERK activation also requires MEK activity. Addition of the MEK1 inhibitors, PD98059 (Fig. 3B) and U0126 (data not shown), prevented ETOP-induced ERK activation. Complete abrogation of ERK activation was also observed when cells incubated with PD98059 or U0126 were exposed to ADR, UV, or IR (data not shown), confirming the role of MEK1 in mediating DNA damage-induced ERK activation. Taken together, these results show that ERK activation is a component of cellular DNA damage responses initiated by diverse stimuli. Because ATM plays a central role in the relay of DNA damage signals (4.Zhou B.B. Elledge S.J. Nature. 2000; 408: 433-439Crossref PubMed Scopus (2596) Google Scholar) and ATM has been shown to play a role in the DNA damage-induced activation of JNK and p38 (37.Shafman T.D. Saleem A. Kyriakis J. Weichselbaum R. Kharbanda S. Kufe D.W. Cancer Res. 1995; 55: 3242-3245PubMed Google Scholar, 38.Wang X. McGowan C.H. Zhao M. He L. Downey J.S. Fearns C. Wang Y. Huang S. Han J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 4543-4552Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar), we sought to determine if ATM played a role in DNA damage-induced ERK activation. As a member of the PI3K family, the kinase activity of ATM is inhibited by the PI3K inhibitor, wortmannin (39.Chan D.W. Son S.C. Block W. Ye R. Khanna K.K. Wold M.S. Douglas P. Goodarzi A.A. Pelley J. Taya Y. Lavin M.F. Lees-Miller S.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 7803-7810Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar, 40.Sarkaria J.N. Tibbetts R.S. Busby E.C. Kennedy A.P. Hill D.E. Abraham R.T. Cancer Res. 1998; 58: 4375-4382PubMed Google Scholar). Addition of wortmannin dose-dependently inhibited ETOP but not UV-induced ERK activation (data not shown), consistent with the fact that wortmannin inhibits the kinase activity of ATM but not ATR (40.Sarkaria J.N. Tibbetts R.S. Busby E.C. Kennedy A.P. Hill D.E. Abraham R.T. Cancer Res. 1998; 58: 4375-4382PubMed Google Scholar) and that UV-induced DNA damage responses are generally ATR-dependent. To confirm ATM dependence of ETOP-induced ERK activation, both ATM−/− (GM05823) and IMR90 (wild type) human fibroblasts were used. Expression of ATM in IMR90 but not in GM05823 was confirmed by Western blot using an anti-ATM (Ab-3) antibody (data not shown). Addition of ADR or ETOP to IMR90 cells led to p53 stabilization, associated with phosphorylation on Ser-15 and up-regulation of p21CIP1 (Fig. 2). Ser-15 phosphorylation-associated p53 stabilization was significantly reduced, and p21CIP1induction was abolished in GM05823 cells in response to ADR or ETOP (Fig. 2), further confirming the lack of ATM function in the ATM−/− fibroblasts. Importantly, ETOP-induced ERK activation was absent in GM05823 but present in IMR90 (Fig. 2), confirming a role of ATM in ETOP-induced ERK activation. However, ADR-induced ERK activation was not attenuated in the ATM−/− fibroblast line (Fig. 2), suggesting that ATR might also play an important role in this setting. Caffeine (2 mm), which inhibits both ATM and ATR (41.Sarkaria J.N. Busby E.C. Tibbetts R.S. Roos P. Taya Y. Karnitz L.M. Abraham R.T. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 4375-4382PubMed Google Scholar), did prevent ADR-induced ERK activation in this context, supporting the supposition that ATR plays a role in the transmission of ADR-mediated DNA damage to ERK (data not shown). Because p53 is the major effector protein downstream of ATM mediating the DNA damage response, we sought to investigate if ERK activation played a role in the p53 pathway, as has been suggested by others (25.Persons D.L. Yazlovitskaya E.M. Pelling J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 35778-35785Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar, 26.Lee S.W. Fang L. Igarashi M. Ouchi T. Lu K.P. Aaronson S.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 8302-8305Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar, 27.She Q.B. Chen N. Dong Z. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 20444-20449Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar). Kinetically, p53 stabilization by ETOP (Fig. 3A) and ADR and IR (data not shown) preceded ERK activation in all cell lines studied. Fig. 3A shows MCF-7 cells. MEK1 inhibition with PD98059 inhibited ERK activation but was without effect on p53 stabilization in response to DNA damage in MEF, NIH3T3, and MCF-7 cells (Fig. 3B, NIH3T3), suggesting that ERK activation was not upstream of p53. Conversely, pretreatment of cells with cycloheximide for 30 min to destroy endogenous p53 prevented ETOP (data not shown)- and ADR (Fig. 3C, NIH3T3)-induced p53 stabilization but not ERK activation, indicating that ERK activation is not downstream of p53. However, given conflicting data suggesting that ERK activation may be either upstream (27.She Q.B. Chen N. Dong Z. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 20444-20449Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar) or downstream (26.Lee S.W. Fang L. Igarashi M. Ouchi T. Lu K.P. Aaronson S.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 8302-8305Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar) of p53 after DNA damage, we wished to confirm our observations. In support of our results, a maximal level of ERK activation was not attenuated in MEFp53−/− compared with wild type MEF (Fig. 3D, inset), although the -fold increase of ERK activation is slightly lower in MEFp53−/− due to higher basal level of ERK activity in these p53-negative cells (Fig. 3D). ADR and UV also induced ERK activation in MEFp53−/− (data not shown). Taken together, these data indicate quite conclusively that under physiologic conditions, DNA damage-induced ERK activation is independent of p53. The two paradigmatic cellular responses to DNA damage are cell cycle arrest (allowing the damage to be repaired) or apoptosis in response to low or high intensities of DNA damage, respectively. The Cdk inhibitor, p21CIP1, is up-regulated in this process and plays a major role in arresting cells in either G1 or at G2/M in response to DNA damage (42.Bunz F. Dutriaux A. Lengauer C. Waldman T. Zhou S. Brown J.P. Sedivy J.M. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Science. 1998; 282: 1497-1501Crossref PubMed Scopus (2505) Google Scholar, 43.Deng C. Zhang P. Harper J.W. Elledge S.J. Leder P. Cell. 1995; 82: 675-684Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1926) Google Scholar). We have observed that wortmannin affected ERK activation and p21CIP1 induction in a more clearly dose-dependent manner than p53 stabilization after DNA damage (data not shown), suggesting that ERK activation might up-regulate p21CIP1. This is consistent with the observations that enforced ERK activation by overexpression of a constitutively activated Raf1 led to p21CIP1 induction (44.Woods D. Parry D. Cherwinski H. Bosch E. Lees E. McMahon M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 5598-5611Crossref PubMed Scopus (574) Google Scholar,45.Sewing A. Wiseman B. Lloyd A.C. Land H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 5588-5597Crossref PubMed Scopus (418) Google Scholar). Consequently, we examined the effect of inhibition of ERK activation on p21CIP1 induction after DNA damage. Inhibition of ERK activation by PD98059 reduced p21CIP1 induction by half (Figs. 3B and 4) but had no effect on p53 stabilization by ETOP (Fig. 3B). PD98059 also attenuated ADR-induced p21CIP1 induction (Fig. 4). As expected, overexpression of a constitutively activated MEK1/Q56P (23.Lin A.W. Barradas M. Stone J.C. van Aelst L. Serrano M. Lowe S.W. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 3008-3019Crossref PubMed Scopus (751) Google Scholar) strongly activated ERK in NIH3T3 and MEF cells (data not shown) and led to p21CIP1 induction that was also inhibited by PD98059 (Fig. 4). Furthermore, expression of MEK1/Q56P in MEFp53−/− cells also resulted in p21CIP1induction (data not shown), indicating that ERK activation is capable of inducing p21CIP1 expression, consistent with prior observations with forcibly expressed Raf1 (44.Woods D. Parry D. Cherwinski H. Bosch E. Lees E. McMahon M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 5598-5611Crossref PubMed Scopus (574) Google Scholar, 45.Sewing A. Wiseman B. Lloyd A.C. Land H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 5588-5597Crossref PubMed Scopus (418) Google Scholar). Our data, however, is the first to demonstrate p21CIP1 induction by ERK under physiologic conditions. Because ERK activation partially contributes to p21CIP1 induction (Figs. 3B and 4), and p21CIP1 plays an important role in both induction of G1 arrest (43.Deng C. Zhang P. Harper J.W. Elledge S.J. Leder P. Cell. 1995; 82: 675-684Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1926) Google Scholar) and maintenance of arrest at the G2/M checkpoint (42.Bunz F. Dutriaux A. Lengauer C. Waldman T. Zhou S. Brown J.P. Sedivy J.M. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Science. 1998; 282: 1497-1501Crossref PubMed Scopus (2505) Google Scholar), we sought to determine whether the magnitude of p21CIP1 induction induced by ERK activation played a functional role in cell cycle arrest in response to DNA damage. Although PD98059 100 μm alone results a degree of G1 arrest (Fig. 5B), consistent with the notion that ERK activity facilitates G1 progression (46.Cheng M. Sexl V. Sherr C.J. Roussel M.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 1091-1096Crossref PubMed Scopus (461) Google Scholar), addition of PD98059 to ETOP 0.5 μm (Fig. 5D) led to a marked release from the G2/M arrest seen with etoposide 0.5 μm alone (Fig. 5C). We confirmed that G2/M release was indeed occurring by mitotic labeling with nocodazole trapping and showed an increase of mitotic cells from 5 to 11% at 24 h when PD98059 is added to ETOP 0.5 μm(data not shown). To further confirm a role of ERK in maintaining G2/M arrest in response to ETOP, a more specific MEK1 inhibitor, U0126, was also used. Although 50 μm U0126 alone has a minimal effect on G1 phase (Fig. 5E), 10 and 50 μm U0126 again dramatically released ETOP (0.5 μm)-induced G2/M arrest (Fig. 5E). Similar results were observed with ADR (data not shown), although the effect of PD98059 on cell cycle arrest induced by ADR is less prominent than that induced by ETOP, consistent with the observation that inhibition of ERK activation was more effective in preventing ETOP- than ADR-mediated p21CIP1 induction (Fig. 4). Given our data for a pro-cell cycle arrest function of ERK in response to DNA damage, we wished to determine if DNA damage-induced ERK activation also mediated apoptotic responses. Addition of ETOP 10 μmfor 24 h led to DNA fragmentation in NIH3T3 cells, which was essentially prevented by ERK inhibition (Fig. 6A). Overexpression of the anti-apoptotic proteins Bcl-2 or Bcl-xL also prevented apoptosis in response to ETOP, indicating that the mitochondrial cellular execution pathway plays a role in DNA damage-induced apoptosis (Fig. 6A). Quantification of apoptosis using terminal deoxyuridine end-nick labeling (TUNEL) revealed that 65% of cells were apoptotic when exposed to 10 μm ETOP for 24 h, and that ERK inhibition with PD 98059 dose- dependently reduced this to less than 10%, suggesting a major role for ERK in DNA damage-induced apoptosis in response to ETOP (Fig. 6B). Similarly, Bcl-2 or Bcl-xL overexpression also reduced apoptosis to ∼10%, indicating again the importance of the mitochondrial execution pathw"

Ammonium transport is mediated by the AMT/MEP/Rh family of membrane proteins which are found in microorganisms, plants, and animals, including the Rhesus blood group antigens in humans. Although ammonium transporters from all kingdoms have been functionally expressed and partially characterized, the transport mechanism, as well as the identity of the true substrate (NH4+or NH3) remains unclear. Here we describe the functional expression and characterization of LeAMT1;1, a root hairammonium transporter from tomato (Lycopersicon esculentum) in Xenopus oocytes. Micromolar concentrations of external ammonium were found to induce concentration- and voltage-dependent inward currents in oocytes injected with LeAMT1;1 cRNA, but not in water-injected control oocytes. The NH4+-induced currents were more than 3-fold larger than methylammonium currents and were not subject to inhibition by Na+ or K+. The voltage dependence of the affinity of LeAMT1;1 toward its substrate strongly suggests that charged NH4+, rather than NH3, is the true transport substrate. Furthermore, ammonium transport was independent of the external proton concentration between pH 5.5 and pH 8.5. LeAMT1;1 is concluded to mediate potential-driven NH4+uptake and retrieval depending on root membrane potential and NH4+concentration gradient.

LeAMT1;1 is concluded to mediate potential-driven NH4+uptake and retrieval depending on root membrane potential and NH4+concentration gradient. Plasma membrane ammonium transport is critical for the acquisition and metabolism of nitrogen in many organisms (1.Kleiner D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1981; 639: 41-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar). In aqueous solution, ammonium (NH4+) is in equilibrium with ammonia (NH3) with a pKa of 9.25. At typical cytosolic pH, ∼99% is present in the cationic form. Uncharged NH3 can pass lipid bilayers along its concentration gradient, but NH4+is less permeable. As a consequence, both trans-membrane electrical and pH gradients affect NH4+/NH3 equilibrium. In the following the term ammonium will be used to designate both the charged and uncharged species, and the chemical symbols will discriminate between NH4+and NH3.Because of their acidic external environments, plant and yeast cells are anticipated to lose significant NH3 derived from uptake and deamination processes. In contrast, the negative membrane potential of most cells favors NH4+entry into cells along its electrochemical gradient. Thus NH4+transporters generally represent uptake and scavenging systems for ammonium. Plants, yeast, and bacteria acquire ammonium by transporter proteins having high affinity for ammonium, whereas animals primarily use ammonium transporters for excretion.Genetic studies in yeast revealed that protein-mediated ammonium transport is crucial for growth on low ammonium concentrations and identified a mutant deficient in ammonium uptake (2.Dubois E. Grenson M. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1979; 175: 67-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). Functional suppression of the growth defect of yeast strains deficient in ammonium uptake have led to the isolation of plant and yeast genes encoding high affinity ammonium transporters (3.Ninnemann O.

Radiotracer uptake studies of the Arabidopsis ammonium transporters heterologously expressed in yeast have shown that the studied transporters possess affinities for ammonium in the nano- to micromolar range (3.Ninnemann O. Jauniaux J.C. Frommer W.B. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 3464-3471Crossref PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar, 6.Gazzarrini S. Lejay L. Gojon A. Ninnemann O. Frommer W.B. von Wirén N. Plant Cell. 1999; 11: 937-948Crossref PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar). AMT/MEP proteins lack similarity to other well studied transporters and are highly hydrophobic membrane proteins with a predicted molecular mass of around 55 kDa and 11–12 putative transmembrane spans. Functionally, AMT proteins fromArabidopsis (AtAMT1;1, AtAMT1;2 and AtAMT1;3) behaved similarly to yeast MEP proteins regarding concentrative transport of both ammonium and methylammonium, dependence on metabolic energy and relative insensitivity to K+ (3.Ninnemann O. Jauniaux J.C. Frommer W.B. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 3464-3471Crossref PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar, 4.Marini A.M. Vissers S. Urrestarazu A. André B.

Biol. 1997; 17: 4282-4293Crossref PubMed Scopus (444) Google Scholar). Related proteins from bacteria were also functionally characterized as ammonium transporters, e.g. from Corynebacterium glutamicum (10.Meier-Wagner J. Nolden L. Jakoby M. Siewe R. Krämer R. Burkovski A. Microbiology. 2001; 147: 135-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar).The mechanism of transport mediated by these transporters remains less clear. Several possibilities exist, including NH3diffusion, NH4+uniport, and H+-coupled symport mechanisms. Although electrical measurements are necessary to resolve the identity of the substrate (NH4+or NH3) transported by AMT-ammonium transporters, all studies relying on direct short term uptake measurements are consistent with net NH4+transport (3.Ninnemann O. Jauniaux J.C. Frommer W.B. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 3464-3471Crossref PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar, 4.Marini A.M. Vissers S. Urrestarazu A. André B.

Microbiology. 2001; 147: 135-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). However, whether the transport is coupled to H+cotransport, although critical to understand ammonium fluxes and equilibrium, has not yet been resolved.The growth defect of Escherichia coli and yeast mutants deficient in ammonium transport in media supplemented with low concentrations of ammonium as sole nitrogen source can be restored at higher pH (11.Soupene E. He L. Yan D. Kustu S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 7030-7034Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar, 12.Soupene E. Ramirez R.M. Kustu S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 5733-5741Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Because at higher pH the relative proportion of NH3 increases, the results led to the suggestion that uncharged NH3, but not NH4+, is transported by bacterial AmtB and yeast MEP proteins (11.Soupene E. He L. Yan D. Kustu S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 7030-7034Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar, 12.Soupene E. Ramirez R.M. Kustu S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 5733-5741Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). In addition, the requirement for a proton gradient to sequester methylammonium in acidic vacuoles supported the interpretation that AMT/MEP/Rh proteins generally transport uncharged substrates (12.Soupene E. Ramirez R.M. Kustu S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 5733-5741Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar).Homologs of AMT/MEP have also been identified in animals, including several in humans. Two human homologs are mainly expressed in kidney, whereas others are specifically expressed in red blood cells (13.Marini A.M. Matassi G. Raynal V. André B. Cartron J.P. Cherif-Zahar B. Nat. Genet. 2000; 26: 341-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar, 14.Liu Z. Peng J. Mo R. Hui C.C. Huang C.H. J. Biol.

Interestingly, the erythrocyte homologs constitute the rhesus (Rh) polypeptides, a family of proteins that are core structural components of the Rh antigens. Despite their clinical importance in transfusion medicine, a physiological function as ammonium transporters has only recently been ascribed to Rh polypeptides (13.Marini A.M. Matassi G. Raynal V. André B. Cartron J.P. Cherif-Zahar B. Nat. Genet. 2000; 26: 341-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar). Rh protein complexes had earlier been known to be important for membrane integrity of red blood cells because individuals with the rare Rhnulldisease (lack of Rh protein expression) display several membrane defects, including altered cation transport (15.Avent N.D. Reid M.E. Blood. 2000; 95: 375-387Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Although not analyzed in full detail, human Rh proteins show some functional differences compared with AMT/MEP transporters when expressed in yeast (13.Marini A.M. Matassi G. Raynal V. André B. Cartron J.P. Cherif-Zahar B. Nat. Genet. 2000; 26: 341-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar). Transport function of Rh proteins may be interpreted both as net ammonium influx and efflux, depending on the experimental conditions (13.Marini A.M. Matassi G. Raynal V. André B. Cartron J.P. Cherif-Zahar B. Nat. Genet. 2000; 26: 341-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar, 16.Ludewig, U., von Wirén, N., Rentsch, D., and Frommer, W. B. (2001) Genome Biol. 2, reviews 1010.1–1010.5Google Scholar).In plants, ammonium uptake from the soil is mediated by high and low affinity systems (5.von Wirén N. Gazzarrini S. Gojon A. Frommer W.B. Curr. Opin. Plant Biol. 2000; 3: 254-261Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar, 17.Ullrich W.R. Larsson M. Larsson C.M. Lesch S. Novacky A. Physiol. Plant. 1984; 61: 369-376Crossref Scopus (123) Google Scholar, 18.Wang M.Y. Siddiqi M.Y. Ruth T.J. Glass A.D.M. Plant Physiol. 1993; 103: 1259-1267Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Plants generally prefer growth on soils containing both nitrate and ammonium, but because of the lower energetic cost needed for assimilation, ammonium may often be the preferred nitrogen source, as has been shown for e.g. Arabidopsis (6.Gazzarrini S. Lejay L. Gojon A. Ninnemann O. Frommer W.B. von Wirén N. Plant Cell. 1999; 11: 937-948Crossref PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar). The high affinitytransporter systems (HATS) for ammonium are saturable in the micromolar range and are electrogenic (19.Higinbotham N. Etherton B. Foster R.J. Plant Physiol. 1964; 39: 196-203Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 20.Walker N.A. Beilby M.J. Smith F.A. J. Membr. Biol. 1979; 49: 21-55Crossref Scopus (67) Google Scholar, 21.Walker N.A. Smith F.A. Beilby M.J. J. Membr. Biol. 1979; 49: 238-296Google Scholar, 22.Felle H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1980; 602: 181-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 23.Wang M.Y. Glass A.D.M. Shaff J.E. Kochian L.V. Plant Physiol. 1994; 104: 899-906Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). Additionally, low affinity ammonium transport systems (LATS) are not saturated even at millimolar concentrations (17.Ullrich W.R. Larsson M. Larsson C.M. Lesch S. Novacky A. Physiol. Plant. 1984; 61: 369-376Crossref Scopus (123) Google Scholar, 18.Wang M.Y. Siddiqi M.Y. Ruth T.J. Glass A.D.M. Plant Physiol. 1993; 103: 1259-1267Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The functional characteristics of HATS are similar to transporters of the AMT/MEP/Rh family. Thus, AMTs probably constitute the molecular basis of HATS (see below). In a thorough study in rice, uptake rates, membrane potentials, and cytosolic ammonium concentrations (in the mm range, determined by loading and efflux of13NH4+) were estimated and led Wang et al. (23.Wang M.Y. Glass A.D.M. Shaff J.E. Kochian L.V. Plant Physiol. 1994; 104: 899-906Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar, 24.Wang M.Y. Siddiqi M.Y. Ruth T.J. Glass A.D.M. Plant Physiol. 1993; 103: 1249-1258Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) to suggest that, at least at low external ammonium concentrations, high affinity systems have to be secondarily active, e.g.ATP-dependent NH4+pumps or NH4+/H+ cotransporters. Exact cytosolic ammonium concentrations, as estimated by different techniques, however, have yielded controversial results (25.Britto D.T. Glass A.D. Kronzucker H.J. Siddiqi M.Y. Plant Physiol. 2001; 125: 523-526Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Relatively high concentrations (several mm) of ammonium have been estimated and measured in e.g. rice (26.Britto D.T. Siddiqi M.Y. Glass A.D. Kronzucker H.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 4255-4258Crossref PubMed Scopus (435) Google Scholar) andChara (27.Wells D.M. Miller A.J. Plant Soil. 2000; 221: 105-108Crossref Scopus (27) Google Scholar). However, because ammonium can collapse the pH gradient of tonoplast vesicles (28.Garbarino J. Dupont F.M. Plant Physiol. 1988; 86: 231-236Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), high levels of ammonium in the cytosol may be cytotoxic, and consequently cytoplasmic ammonium levels are unlikely to be high. The transport mechanism by which plants acquire ammonium sets thermodynamic limits to cytosolic steady-state ammonium levels.To investigate the biophysical properties of ammonium transporters of the AMT/MEP/Rh family, the plant ammonium transporter LeAMT1;1 was studied in more detail. The up-regulation of LeAMT1;1 transcripts in tomato root hairs under nitrogen deficiency suggests a major role for plant nutrition. We functionally expressed LeAMT1;1 heterologously inXenopus oocytes and used a two-electrode voltage clamp to study the transport mechanism. Our findings indicate that NH4+uniport is the mechanism for LeAMT1;1. Plasma membrane ammonium transport is critical for the acquisition and metabolism of nitrogen in many organisms (1.Kleiner D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1981; 639: 41-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar). In aqueous solution, ammonium (NH4+) is in equilibrium with ammonia (NH3) with a pKa of 9.25.

Functionally, AMT proteins fromArabidopsis (AtAMT1;1, AtAMT1;2 and AtAMT1;3) behaved similarly to yeast MEP proteins regarding concentrative transport of both ammonium and methylammonium, dependence on metabolic energy and relative insensitivity to K+ (3.Ninnemann O.

Related proteins from bacteria were also functionally characterized as ammonium transporters, e.g. from Corynebacterium glutamicum (10.Meier-Wagner J. Nolden L. Jakoby M. Siewe R. Krämer R.

Microbiology. 2001; 147: 135-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). ammonium transporter high affinity transporter system methylammonium permease 2-(N-morpholino)ethanesulfonic acid rhesus ammonium transporter high affinity transporter system methylammonium permease 2-(N-morpholino)ethanesulfonic acid rhesus The mechanism of transport mediated by these transporters remains less clear. Several possibilities exist, including NH3diffusion, NH4+uniport, and H+-coupled symport mechanisms. Although electrical measurements are necessary to resolve the identity of the substrate (NH4+or NH3) transported by AMT-ammonium transporters, all studies relying on direct short term uptake measurements are consistent with net NH4+transport (3.Ninnemann O. Jauniaux J.C. Frommer W.B. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 3464-3471Crossref PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar, 4.Marini A.M. Vissers S. Urrestarazu A. André B.

Microbiology. 2001; 147: 135-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). However, whether the transport is coupled to H+cotransport, although critical to understand ammonium fluxes and equilibrium, has not yet been resolved. The growth defect of Escherichia coli and yeast mutants deficient in ammonium transport in media supplemented with low concentrations of ammonium as sole nitrogen source can be restored at higher pH (11.Soupene E. He L. Yan D. Kustu S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 7030-7034Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar, 12.Soupene E. Ramirez R.M. Kustu S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 5733-5741Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Because at higher pH the relative proportion of NH3 increases, the results led to the suggestion that uncharged NH3, but not NH4+, is transported by bacterial AmtB and yeast MEP proteins (11.Soupene E. He L. Yan D. Kustu S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 7030-7034Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar, 12.Soupene E. Ramirez R.M. Kustu S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 5733-5741Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). In addition, the requirement for a proton gradient to sequester methylammonium in acidic vacuoles supported the interpretation that AMT/MEP/Rh proteins generally transport uncharged substrates (12.Soupene E. Ramirez R.M. Kustu S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 5733-5741Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Homologs of AMT/MEP have also been identified in animals, including several in humans. Two human homologs are mainly expressed in kidney, whereas others are specifically expressed in red blood cells (13.Marini A.M. Matassi G. Raynal V. André B. Cartron J.P. Cherif-Zahar B. Nat. Genet. 2000; 26: 341-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar, 14.Liu Z. Peng J. Mo R. Hui C.C. Huang C.H. J. Biol.

Interestingly, the erythrocyte homologs constitute the rhesus (Rh) polypeptides, a family of proteins that are core structural components of the Rh antigens. Despite their clinical importance in transfusion medicine, a physiological function as ammonium transporters has only recently been ascribed to Rh polypeptides (13.Marini A.M. Matassi G. Raynal V. André B. Cartron J.P. Cherif-Zahar B. Nat. Genet. 2000; 26: 341-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar). Rh protein complexes had earlier been known to be important for membrane integrity of red blood cells because individuals with the rare Rhnulldisease (lack of Rh protein expression) display several membrane defects, including altered cation transport (15.Avent N.D. Reid M.E. Blood. 2000; 95: 375-387Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Although not analyzed in full detail, human Rh proteins show some functional differences compared with AMT/MEP transporters when expressed in yeast (13.Marini A.M. Matassi G. Raynal V. André B. Cartron J.P. Cherif-Zahar B. Nat. Genet. 2000; 26: 341-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar). Transport function of Rh proteins may be interpreted both as net ammonium influx and efflux, depending on the experimental conditions (13.Marini A.M. Matassi G. Raynal V. André B. Cartron J.P. Cherif-Zahar B. Nat. Genet. 2000; 26: 341-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar, 16.Ludewig, U., von Wirén, N., Rentsch, D., and Frommer, W. B. (2001) Genome Biol. 2, reviews 1010.1–1010.5Google Scholar). In plants, ammonium uptake from the soil is mediated by high and low affinity systems (5.von Wirén N. Gazzarrini S. Gojon A. Frommer W.B. Curr. Opin. Plant Biol. 2000; 3: 254-261Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar, 17.Ullrich W.R. Larsson M. Larsson C.M. Lesch S. Novacky A. Physiol.

Plants generally prefer growth on soils containing both nitrate and ammonium, but because of the lower energetic cost needed for assimilation, ammonium may often be the preferred nitrogen source, as has been shown for e.g. Arabidopsis (6.Gazzarrini S. Lejay L. Gojon A. Ninnemann O. Frommer W.B. von Wirén N. Plant Cell. 1999; 11: 937-948Crossref PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar). The high affinitytransporter systems (HATS) for ammonium are saturable in the micromolar range and are electrogenic (19.Higinbotham N. Etherton B. Foster R.J. Plant Physiol. 1964; 39: 196-203Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 20.Walker N.A. Beilby M.J. Smith F.A. J. Membr. Biol. 1979; 49: 21-55Crossref Scopus (67) Google Scholar, 21.Walker N.A. Smith F.A.

Kochian L.V. Plant Physiol. 1994; 104: 899-906Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). Additionally, low affinity ammonium transport systems (LATS) are not saturated even at millimolar concentrations (17.Ullrich W.R. Larsson M. Larsson C.M. Lesch S. Novacky A. Physiol. Plant. 1984; 61: 369-376Crossref Scopus (123) Google Scholar, 18.Wang M.Y. Siddiqi M.Y. Ruth T.J. Glass A.D.M. Plant Physiol. 1993; 103: 1259-1267Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The functional characteristics of HATS are similar to transporters of the AMT/MEP/Rh family. Thus, AMTs probably constitute the molecular basis of HATS (see below). In a thorough study in rice, uptake rates, membrane potentials, and cytosolic ammonium concentrations (in the mm range, determined by loading and efflux of13NH4+) were estimated and led Wang et al. (23.Wang M.Y. Glass A.D.M. Shaff J.E. Kochian L.V. Plant Physiol. 1994; 104: 899-906Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar, 24.Wang M.Y. Siddiqi M.Y. Ruth T.J. Glass A.D.M. Plant Physiol. 1993; 103: 1249-1258Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) to suggest that, at least at low external ammonium concentrations, high affinity systems have to be secondarily active, e.g.ATP-dependent NH4+pumps or NH4+/H+ cotransporters. Exact cytosolic ammonium concentrations, as estimated by different techniques, however, have yielded controversial results (25.Britto D.T. Glass A.D. Kronzucker H.J. Siddiqi M.Y. Plant Physiol. 2001; 125: 523-526Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Relatively high concentrations (several mm) of ammonium have been estimated and measured in e.g. rice (26.Britto D.T. Siddiqi M.Y. Glass A.D. Kronzucker H.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 4255-4258Crossref PubMed Scopus (435) Google Scholar) andChara (27.Wells D.M. Miller A.J. Plant Soil. 2000; 221: 105-108Crossref Scopus (27) Google Scholar). However, because ammonium can collapse the pH gradient of tonoplast vesicles (28.Garbarino J. Dupont F.M. Plant Physiol. 1988; 86: 231-236Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), high levels of ammonium in the cytosol may be cytotoxic, and consequently cytoplasmic ammonium levels are unlikely to be high. The transport mechanism by which plants acquire ammonium sets thermodynamic limits to cytosolic steady-state ammonium levels. To investigate the biophysical properties of ammonium transporters of the AMT/MEP/Rh family, the plant ammonium transporter LeAMT1;1 was studied in more detail. The up-regulation of LeAMT1;1 transcripts in tomato root hairs under nitrogen deficiency suggests a major role for plant nutrition. We functionally expressed LeAMT1;1 heterologously inXenopus oocytes and used a two-electrode voltage clamp to study the transport mechanism. Our findings indicate that NH4+uniport is the mechanism for LeAMT1;1.

Here, we have characterized these interactions further. Using a metabolic inhibitor of sulfation, sodium chlorate, we show that the interactions of the CS/DS chains of versican with L- and P-selectin and chemokines are sulfation-dependent but the interaction with CD44 is sulfation-independent. Consistently, versican's binding to L- and P-selectin and chemokines is specifically inhibited by oversulfated CS/DS chains containing GlcAβ1–3GalNAc(4,6-O-disulfate) or IdoAα1–3GalNAc(4,6-O-disulfate), but its binding to CD44 is inhibited by all the CS/DS chains, including low-sulfated and unsulfated ones. Affinity and kinetic analyses using surface plasmon resonance revealed that the oversulfated CS/DS chains containing GlcAβ1/IdoAα1–3GalNAc(4,6-O-disulfate) bind directly to selectins and chemokines with high affinity (Kd21.1 to 293 nm). In addition, a tetrasaccharide fragment of repeating GlcAβ1–3GalNAc(4,6-O-disulfate) units directly interacts with L- and P-selectin and chemokines and oversulfated CS/DS chains containing GlcAβ1/IdoAα1–3GalNAc(4,6-O-disulfate) inhibit chemokine-induced Ca2+ mobilization. Taken together, our results show that oversulfated CS/DS chains containing GlcAβ1/IdoAα1–3GalNAc(4,6-O-disulfate) are recognized by L- and P-selectin and chemokines, and imply that these chains are important in selectin- and/or chemokine-mediated cellular responses.

They belong to a family of macromolecules that consist of core proteins to which glycosaminoglycans (GAGs),1 sulfated polysaccharides, are attached. GAGs are linear polysaccharides made up of disaccharide units composed of hexosamine and hexuronic acid (or hexose). They are classified into chondroitin sulfate (CS), dermatan sulfate (DS), heparin, heparan sulfate (HS), keratan sulfate (KS), and hyaluronic acid (HA). Because of the high sulfate and carboxyl group content of their GAG moieties, proteoglycans have strong negative charges. This property allows them to interact with a wide range of proteins, including growth factors, enzymes, cytokines, chemokines, lipoproteins, and adhesion molecules (1.Salmivirta M. Lidholt K. Lindahl U. FASEB J. 1996; 11: 1270-1279Crossref Scopus (393) Google Scholar, 2.Bernfield M. Gotte M. Park P.W. Reizes O. Fitzgerald M.L. Lincecum J. Zako M. Annu. Rev.

Li Y.-F. Watanabe N. Hirose J. Hirose M. Miyasaka M. Int. Immunol. 1999; 11: 393-405Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 4.Kawashima H. Hirose M. Hirose J. Nagakubo D. Plaas A.H.K. Miyasaka M.

Chem. 2001; 276: 5228-5234Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar), all of which have been implicated in leukocyte trafficking. Versican possesses a hyaluronic acid-binding domain at its N terminus, a GAG attachment domain in the middle, and a set of epidermal growth factor-like, C-type lectin-like, and complement regulatory protein-like domains at its C terminus (6.Zimmermann D.R. Ruoslahti E. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 2975-2981Crossref PubMed Scopus (499) Google Scholar). Alternative splicing of the versican gene generates four versican isoforms: V0, V1, and V2, which bear GAG attachment domains of different lengths, and V3, which is without a GAG attachment domain (7.Zako M. Shinomura T. Ujita M. Ito K. Kimata K. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 3914-3918Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Versican is widely expressed in many tissues, including the kidney, skin, brain, and aorta (8.Bode-Lesniewska B. Dours-Zimmermann M.T. Odermatt B.F. Briner J. Heitz P.U. Zimmermann D.R. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 1996; 44: 303-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). Our previous studies indicated that versican from certain cell types, such as ACHN and Vero cells, but not that from 293T cells or human skin fibroblasts, interacts with L-selectin, suggesting that at least one glycoform of versican species is reactive with L-selectin (3.Kawashima H. Li Y.-F. Watanabe N. Hirose J. Hirose M. Miyasaka M. Int. Immunol. 1999; 11: 393-405Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). We have also shown that a subset of GAGs, including CS B from pig skin, CS E from squid cartilage, and HS from bovine kidney, interacts with L- and P-selectin and chemokines and inhibits the interaction with versican (4.Kawashima H.

Thus, it seems likely that a nonspecific electrostatic interaction is not the sole factor determining the interaction, and that a specific carbohydrate structure is recognized by L- and P-selectin and chemokines, although the precise structural features remain undefined.In the present study, we have extended our previous work to examine the structural requirement for the interaction of CS/DS chains with adhesion molecules and chemokines. We report here affinity and kinetic parameters for the interaction of various GAGs with L- and P-selectin and chemokines. We also provide evidence that a tetrasaccharide fragment composed of two GlcAβ1–3GalNAc(4,6-O-disulfate) units directly interacts with L- and P-selectin and chemokines.DISCUSSIONIn this study, having demonstrated that sulfation is essential for the interaction of CS/DS chains with L- and P-selectin and chemokines, we analyzed the carbohydrate structures that bind to these molecules and have shown that oversulfated CS/DS chains containing GlcAβ1–3GalNAc(4,6-O-disulfate) or IdoAα1–3GalNAc(4,6-O-disulfate) bind L- and P-selectin and chemokines with high affinity. We have also provided evidence that a tetrasaccharide fragment composed of repeating GlcAβ1–3GalNAc(4,6-O-disulfate) units directly interacts with L- and P-selectin and chemokines, and that the oversulfated CS/DS chains inhibit chemokine activity in vitro.Sulfation plays an important role in the interactions of L- and P-selectin with the majority of ligands hitherto reported. For example, the tyrosine sulfation of P-selectin glycoprotein ligand-1 is required for its interaction with L- and P-selectin (17.Sako D. Comess K.M. Barone K.M. Camphausen R.T. Cumming D.A.

Invest. 1998; 101: 877-889Crossref PubMed Scopus (358) Google Scholar) bind L- and P-selectin. Our results showing that sulfation is required for versican's binding to L- and P-selectin (Figs. 1 and 4) are thus consistent with these previous findings. Extending these observations, we also showed that the sulfation of versican is required for the interaction with chemokines but not CD44 (Figs. 1 and 4). The absence of a sulfation requirement for versican's binding to CD44 is reminiscent of the binding of unsulfated GAG and HA to CD44 (26.Aruffo A. Stamenkovic I. Melnick M. Underhill C.B. Seed B. Cell. 1990; 61: 1303-1313Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2135) Google Scholar).Surface plasmon resonance analysis showed that the binding affinities of soluble monomeric L- and P-selectin to oversulfated CS/DS chains are higher than those for known ligands (Fig. 6 and Table II). It has been reported that monomeric L-selectin binds to immobilized glycosylation-dependent cell adhesion molecule-1 (GlyCAM-1) with low affinity (Kd = 108 μm) and with very fast association (≥105m−1 s−1) and dissociation (≥10 s−1) rates (27.Nicholson M.W. Barclay A.N. Singer M.S. Rosen S.D. van der Merwe P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 763-770Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). P-selectin has been reported to bind to P-selectin glycoprotein ligand-1 with relatively high affinity (Kd ∼300 nm) and with fast association (4.4 × 106m−1s−1) and dissociation (1.4 s−1) rates (28.Mehta P. Cummings R.D. McEver R.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 32506-32513Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). These properties have been proposed to be critical for the dynamic selectin-mediated rolling adhesion that is mediated by rapid adhesion and de-adhesion (27.Nicholson M.W. Barclay A.N. Singer M.S. Rosen S.D. van der Merwe P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 763-770Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar, 28.Mehta P. Cummings R.D. McEver R.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 32506-32513Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). We speculate that the high-affinity binding of L- and P-selectin to oversulfated CS/DS chains with a slow dissociation rate (Table II) may enable rolling interactions with different rolling velocity and/or static adhesive interactions of leukocytes, if appropriate CS/DS chains are expressed locally.The oversulfated CS/DS chains interact with certain chemokines with high affinity as observed with the selectins (Table II). The high affinity binding of chemokines SLC, IP-10, and SDF-1β suggest that these chemokines might be readily trapped by oversulfated CS/DS chains in vivo. This hypothesis is supported by the surface plasmon resonance kinetic analysis, which demonstrated that the oversulfated CS/DS-chemokine complex formation is characterized by fast association rates (0.864 to 4.15 × 104m−1 s−1). It is conceivable that the oversulfated CS/DS-bound form of chemokines may not function as agonists for chemokine receptors, because those GAGs inhibit chemokine activity (Fig. 8). Rather, the oversulfated CS/DS-chemokine complex may function as a reservoir for chemokines in vivo. The slow dissociation rate (2.78 × 10−4 to 5.30 × 10−3 s−1) that is observed in the interaction of chemokines with oversulfated CS/DS chains supports this idea.Hints about the mechanism of CS/DS binding to chemokines are provided by the observation that versican interacts with SDF-1β but not SDF-1α (Figs. 4 and 5). Because SDF-1α and SDF-1β are produced by an alternative splicing of a single gene with the latter lacking only 4 amino acid residues in the C terminus (29.Shirozu M. Nakano T. Inazawa J. Tashiro K. Tada H. Shinohara T. Honjo T. Genomics. 1995; 28: 495-500Crossref PubMed Scopus (533) Google Scholar), versican, or its CS/DS chains, appears to interact with the chemokine's C terminus. Consistent with this idea, versican failed to bind to a mutant SLC that lacked the C-terminal basic amino acid clusters (Fig. 4), and CS B and CS E also failed to bind the C terminus truncated SLC. 2J. Hirose, H. Kawashima, and M. Miyasaka, submitted for publication. Therefore, these data strongly suggest that CS/DS interacts with the C terminus of these chemokines.Structural analysis indicated that GlcAβ1–3GalNAc(4,6-O-disulfate) units are present in the GAG moiety of versican (Fig. 3). Given that L- and P-selectin and chemokines bind preferentially to a tetrasaccharide composed of repeating GlcAβ1–3GalNAc(4,6-O-disulfate) units (Fig. 7), and that CD44 preferentially interacts with unsulfated or low-sulfated CS chains (Table II), it seems likely that GlcAβ1–3GalNAc(4,6-O-disulfate) units interact with selectins and chemokines if these units are present as a cluster in the GAG chain, whereas a different structure containing GlcAβ1–3GalNAc(4-O-sulfate) or GlcAβ1–3GalNAc(6-O-sulfate) appears to interact with CD44.Although CS B (DS) from pig skin inhibited the interaction of versican with L- and P-selectin and chemokines in our previous studies (4.Kawashima H.

Disaccharide composition analysis of these DS chains, however, showed no striking difference between them;i.e. DS from pig skin is composed of ΔDi-6S (1.3%), ΔDi-4S (91.5%), and ΔDi-di(2,4)S (7.2%), whereas DS from rooster comb is composed of ΔDi-0S (5.0%), ΔDi-6S (3.4%), ΔDi-4S (85.2%), and ΔDi-di(2, 4)S (6.3%) (data not shown). Because a highly sulfated oligosaccharide composed of repeating disulfated disaccharides interacted well with selectins and chemokines (Fig. 7), we think it possible that a difference in the amount of highly sulfated clusters containing IdoA(2-O-disulfate)α1–3GalNAc(4-O-disulfate) in these DS chains may in part explain the differential reactivity, although further structural characterization is required.Oversulfated CS/DS chains containing GlcAβ1/IdoAα1–3GalNAc(4,6-O-disulfate) have been found in squid cartilage (30.Suzuki S.

For example, CS E inhibits the adhesion of cortical neuronal cells to the neurotrophic factor midkine through direct interaction with midkine (39.Ueoka C. Kaneda N. Okazaki I. Nadanaka S.

Our results showing that oversulfated CS/DS chains containing GlcAβ1/IdoAα1–3GalNAc(4,6-O-disulfate) bind to proinflammatory molecules, such as selectins and chemokines, and regulate chemokine activity, further indicate the versatility of these oversulfated chains in regulating biological responses. It is now extremely important to understand the exact tissue distribution of the oversulfated CS/DS chains bearing the ability to interact with these proinflammatory molecules and the regulatory mechanisms whereby these GAGs are generated. Proteoglycans are ubiquitous components of cell surface membranes, basement membranes, and extracellular matrices in various tissues. They belong to a family of macromolecules that consist of core proteins to which glycosaminoglycans (GAGs),1 sulfated polysaccharides, are attached. GAGs are linear polysaccharides made up of disaccharide units composed of hexosamine and hexuronic acid (or hexose). They are classified into chondroitin sulfate (CS), dermatan sulfate (DS), heparin, heparan sulfate (HS), keratan sulfate (KS), and hyaluronic acid (HA). Because of the high sulfate and carboxyl group content of their GAG moieties, proteoglycans have strong negative charges. This property allows them to interact with a wide range of proteins, including growth factors, enzymes, cytokines, chemokines, lipoproteins, and adhesion molecules (1.Salmivirta M. Lidholt K. Lindahl U. FASEB J. 1996; 11: 1270-1279Crossref Scopus (393) Google Scholar, 2.Bernfield M. Gotte M. Park P.W. Reizes O. Fitzgerald M.L. Lincecum J. Zako M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1999; 68: 729-777Crossref PubMed Scopus (2295) Google Scholar). We previously showed that a large CS/DS proteoglycan, versican (also called PG-M), that was derived from a renal adenocarcinoma cell line, ACHN, interacts through its CS/DS chains with adhesion molecules such as L- and P-selectin and CD44 (3.Kawashima H. Li Y.-F. Watanabe N. Hirose J. Hirose M. Miyasaka M. Int. Immunol. 1999; 11: 393-405Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 4.Kawashima H. Hirose M. Hirose J. Nagakubo D. Plaas A.H.K. Miyasaka M.

Chem. 2001; 276: 5228-5234Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar), all of which have been implicated in leukocyte trafficking. Versican possesses a hyaluronic acid-binding domain at its N terminus, a GAG attachment domain in the middle, and a set of epidermal growth factor-like, C-type lectin-like, and complement regulatory protein-like domains at its C terminus (6.Zimmermann D.R. Ruoslahti E. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 2975-2981Crossref PubMed Scopus (499) Google Scholar). Alternative splicing of the versican gene generates four versican isoforms: V0, V1, and V2, which bear GAG attachment domains of different lengths, and V3, which is without a GAG attachment domain (7.Zako M. Shinomura T. Ujita M. Ito K. Kimata K. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 3914-3918Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Versican is widely expressed in many tissues, including the kidney, skin, brain, and aorta (8.Bode-Lesniewska B. Dours-Zimmermann M.T. Odermatt B.F. Briner J. Heitz P.U. Zimmermann D.R. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 1996; 44: 303-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). Our previous studies indicated that versican from certain cell types, such as ACHN and Vero cells, but not that from 293T cells or human skin fibroblasts, interacts with L-selectin, suggesting that at least one glycoform of versican species is reactive with L-selectin (3.Kawashima H. Li Y.-F. Watanabe N. Hirose J. Hirose M. Miyasaka M. Int. Immunol. 1999; 11: 393-405Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). We have also shown that a subset of GAGs, including CS B from pig skin, CS E from squid cartilage, and HS from bovine kidney, interacts with L- and P-selectin and chemokines and inhibits the interaction with versican (4.Kawashima H.

Tashiro K. Miyasaka M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 5228-5234Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). Thus, it seems likely that a nonspecific electrostatic interaction is not the sole factor determining the interaction, and that a specific carbohydrate structure is recognized by L- and P-selectin and chemokines, although the precise structural features remain undefined. In the present study, we have extended our previous work to examine the structural requirement for the interaction of CS/DS chains with adhesion molecules and chemokines. We report here affinity and kinetic parameters for the interaction of various GAGs with L- and P-selectin and chemokines. We also provide evidence that a tetrasaccharide fragment composed of two GlcAβ1–3GalNAc(4,6-O-disulfate) units directly interacts with L- and P-selectin and chemokines. DISCUSSIONIn this study, having demonstrated that sulfation is essential for the interaction of CS/DS chains with L- and P-selectin and chemokines, we analyzed the carbohydrate structures that bind to these molecules and have shown that oversulfated CS/DS chains containing GlcAβ1–3GalNAc(4,6-O-disulfate) or IdoAα1–3GalNAc(4,6-O-disulfate) bind L- and P-selectin and chemokines with high affinity. We have also provided evidence that a tetrasaccharide fragment composed of repeating GlcAβ1–3GalNAc(4,6-O-disulfate) units directly interacts with L- and P-selectin and chemokines, and that the oversulfated CS/DS chains inhibit chemokine activity in vitro.Sulfation plays an important role in the interactions of L- and P-selectin with the majority of ligands hitherto reported. For example, the tyrosine sulfation of P-selectin glycoprotein ligand-1 is required for its interaction with L- and P-selectin (17.Sako D. Comess K.M. Barone K.M. Camphausen R.T. Cumming D.A.

Blood. 1993; 11: 3253-3258Crossref Google Scholar), and HS GAGs (25.Koenig A. Norgard-Sumnicht K. Linhardt R. Varki A. J. Clin. Invest. 1998; 101: 877-889Crossref PubMed Scopus (358) Google Scholar) bind L- and P-selectin. Our results showing that sulfation is required for versican's binding to L- and P-selectin (Figs. 1 and 4) are thus consistent with these previous findings. Extending these observations, we also showed that the sulfation of versican is required for the interaction with chemokines but not CD44 (Figs. 1 and 4). The absence of a sulfation requirement for versican's binding to CD44 is reminiscent of the binding of unsulfated GAG and HA to CD44 (26.Aruffo A. Stamenkovic I. Melnick M. Underhill C.B. Seed B. Cell. 1990; 61: 1303-1313Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2135) Google Scholar).Surface plasmon resonance analysis showed that the binding affinities of soluble monomeric L- and P-selectin to oversulfated CS/DS chains are higher than those for known ligands (Fig. 6 and Table II). It has been reported that monomeric L-selectin binds to immobilized glycosylation-dependent cell adhesion molecule-1 (GlyCAM-1) with low affinity (Kd = 108 μm) and with very fast association (≥105m−1 s−1) and dissociation (≥10 s−1) rates (27.Nicholson M.W. Barclay A.N. Singer M.S. Rosen S.D. van der Merwe P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 763-770Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). P-selectin has been reported to bind to P-selectin glycoprotein ligand-1 with relatively high affinity (Kd ∼300 nm) and with fast association (4.4 × 106m−1s−1) and dissociation (1.4 s−1) rates (28.Mehta P. Cummings R.D. McEver R.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 32506-32513Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). These properties have been proposed to be critical for the dynamic selectin-mediated rolling adhesion that is mediated by rapid adhesion and de-adhesion (27.Nicholson M.W. Barclay A.N. Singer M.S. Rosen S.D. van der Merwe P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 763-770Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar, 28.Mehta P. Cummings R.D. McEver R.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 32506-32513Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). We speculate that the high-affinity binding of L- and P-selectin to oversulfated CS/DS chains with a slow dissociation rate (Table II) may enable rolling interactions with different rolling velocity and/or static adhesive interactions of leukocytes, if appropriate CS/DS chains are expressed locally.The oversulfated CS/DS chains interact with certain chemokines with high affinity as observed with the selectins (Table II). The high affinity binding of chemokines SLC, IP-10, and SDF-1β suggest that these chemokines might be readily trapped by oversulfated CS/DS chains in vivo. This hypothesis is supported by the surface plasmon resonance kinetic analysis, which demonstrated that the oversulfated CS/DS-chemokine complex formation is characterized by fast association rates (0.864 to 4.15 × 104m−1 s−1). It is conceivable that the oversulfated CS/DS-bound form of chemokines may not function as agonists for chemokine receptors, because those GAGs inhibit chemokine activity (Fig. 8). Rather, the oversulfated CS/DS-chemokine complex may function as a reservoir for chemokines in vivo. The slow dissociation rate (2.78 × 10−4 to 5.30 × 10−3 s−1) that is observed in the interaction of chemokines with oversulfated CS/DS chains supports this idea.Hints about the mechanism of CS/DS binding to chemokines are provided by the observation that versican interacts with SDF-1β but not SDF-1α (Figs. 4 and 5). Because SDF-1α and SDF-1β are produced by an alternative splicing of a single gene with the latter lacking only 4 amino acid residues in the C terminus (29.Shirozu M. Nakano T. Inazawa J. Tashiro K. Tada H. Shinohara T. Honjo T. Genomics. 1995; 28: 495-500Crossref PubMed Scopus (533) Google Scholar), versican, or its CS/DS chains, appears to interact with the chemokine's C terminus. Consistent with this idea, versican failed to bind to a mutant SLC that lacked the C-terminal basic amino acid clusters (Fig. 4), and CS B and CS E also failed to bind the C terminus truncated SLC. 2J.

Therefore, these data strongly suggest that CS/DS interacts with the C terminus of these chemokines.Structural analysis indicated that GlcAβ1–3GalNAc(4,6-O-disulfate) units are present in the GAG moiety of versican (Fig. 3). Given that L- and P-selectin and chemokines bind preferentially to a tetrasaccharide composed of repeating GlcAβ1–3GalNAc(4,6-O-disulfate) units (Fig. 7), and that CD44 preferentially interacts with unsulfated or low-sulfated CS chains (Table II), it seems likely that GlcAβ1–3GalNAc(4,6-O-disulfate) units interact with selectins and chemokines if these units are present as a cluster in the GAG chain, whereas a different structure containing GlcAβ1–3GalNAc(4-O-sulfate) or GlcAβ1–3GalNAc(6-O-sulfate) appears to interact with CD44.Although CS B (DS) from pig skin inhibited the interaction of versican with L- and P-selectin and chemokines in our previous studies (4.Kawashima H.

Because a highly sulfated oligosaccharide composed of repeating disulfated disaccharides interacted well with selectins and chemokines (Fig. 7), we think it possible that a difference in the amount of highly sulfated clusters containing IdoA(2-O-disulfate)α1–3GalNAc(4-O-disulfate) in these DS chains may in part explain the differential reactivity, although further structural characterization is required.Oversulfated CS/DS chains containing GlcAβ1/IdoAα1–3GalNAc(4,6-O-disulfate) have been found in squid cartilage (30.Suzuki S.

Invest. 1998; 101: 877-889Crossref PubMed Scopus (358) Google Scholar) bind L- and P-selectin. Our results showing that sulfation is required for versican's binding to L- and P-selectin (Figs. 1 and 4) are thus consistent with these previous findings. Extending these observations, we also showed that the sulfation of versican is required for the interaction with chemokines but not CD44 (Figs. 1 and 4). The absence of a sulfation requirement for versican's binding to CD44 is reminiscent of the binding of unsulfated GAG and HA to CD44 (26.Aruffo A. Stamenkovic I. Melnick M. Underhill C.B. Seed B. Cell. 1990; 61: 1303-1313Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2135) Google Scholar). Surface plasmon resonance analysis showed that the binding affinities of soluble monomeric L- and P-selectin to oversulfated CS/DS chains are higher than those for known ligands (Fig. 6 and Table II). It has been reported that monomeric L-selectin binds to immobilized glycosylation-dependent cell adhesion molecule-1 (GlyCAM-1) with low affinity (Kd = 108 μm) and with very fast association (≥105m−1 s−1) and dissociation (≥10 s−1) rates (27.Nicholson M.W. Barclay A.N. Singer M.S. Rosen S.D. van der Merwe P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 763-770Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). P-selectin has been reported to bind to P-selectin glycoprotein ligand-1 with relatively high affinity (Kd ∼300 nm) and with fast association (4.4 × 106m−1s−1) and dissociation (1.4 s−1) rates (28.Mehta P. Cummings R.D. McEver R.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 32506-32513Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). These properties have been proposed to be critical for the dynamic selectin-mediated rolling adhesion that is mediated by rapid adhesion and de-adhesion (27.Nicholson M.W. Barclay A.N. Singer M.S. Rosen S.D. van der Merwe P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 763-770Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar, 28.Mehta P. Cummings R.D. McEver R.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 32506-32513Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). We speculate that the high-affinity binding of L- and P-selectin to oversulfated CS/DS chains with a slow dissociation rate (Table II) may enable rolling interactions with different rolling velocity and/or static adhesive interactions of leukocytes, if appropriate CS/DS chains are expressed locally. The oversulfated CS/DS chains interact with certain chemokines with high affinity as observed with the selectins (Table II). The high affinity binding of chemokines SLC, IP-10, and SDF-1β suggest that these chemokines might be readily trapped by oversulfated CS/DS chains in vivo. This hypothesis is supported by the surface plasmon resonance kinetic analysis, which demonstrated that the oversulfated CS/DS-chemokine complex formation is characterized by fast association rates (0.864 to 4.15 × 104m−1 s−1). It is conceivable that the oversulfated CS/DS-bound form of chemokines may not function as agonists for chemokine receptors, because those GAGs inhibit chemokine activity (Fig. 8). Rather, the oversulfated CS/DS-chemokine complex may function as a reservoir for chemokines in vivo. The slow dissociation rate (2.78 × 10−4 to 5.30 × 10−3 s−1) that is observed in the interaction of chemokines with oversulfated CS/DS chains supports this idea. Hints about the mechanism of CS/DS binding to chemokines are provided by the observation that versican interacts with SDF-1β but not SDF-1α (Figs. 4 and 5). Because SDF-1α and SDF-1β are produced by an alternative splicing of a single gene with the latter lacking only 4 amino acid residues in the C terminus (29.Shirozu M. Nakano T. Inazawa J. Tashiro K. Tada H. Shinohara T. Honjo T. Genomics. 1995; 28: 495-500Crossref PubMed Scopus (533) Google Scholar), versican, or its CS/DS chains, appears to interact with the chemokine's C terminus. Consistent with this idea, versican failed to bind to a mutant SLC that lacked the C-terminal basic amino acid clusters (Fig. 4), and CS B and CS E also failed to bind the C terminus truncated SLC. 2J. Hirose, H. Kawashima, and M. Miyasaka, submitted for publication. Therefore, these data strongly suggest that CS/DS interacts with the C terminus of these chemokines. Structural analysis indicated that GlcAβ1–3GalNAc(4,6-O-disulfate) units are present in the GAG moiety of versican (Fig. 3). Given that L- and P-selectin and chemokines bind preferentially to a tetrasaccharide composed of repeating GlcAβ1–3GalNAc(4,6-O-disulfate) units (Fig. 7), and that CD44 preferentially interacts with unsulfated or low-sulfated CS chains (Table II), it seems likely that GlcAβ1–3GalNAc(4,6-O-disulfate) units interact with selectins and chemokines if these units are present as a cluster in the GAG chain, whereas a different structure containing GlcAβ1–3GalNAc(4-O-sulfate) or GlcAβ1–3GalNAc(6-O-sulfate) appears to interact with CD44. Although CS B (DS) from pig skin inhibited the interaction of versican with L- and P-selectin and chemokines in our previous studies (4.Kawashima H. Hirose M. Hirose J. Nagakubo D. Plaas A.H.K. Miyasaka M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 35448-35456Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar, 5.Hirose J. Kawashima H. Yoshie O. Tashiro K. Miyasaka M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 5228-5234Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar), the DS from rooster comb that was used in this study failed to inhibit the interaction (Fig. 2). Disaccharide composition analysis of these DS chains, however, showed no striking difference between them;i.e. DS from pig skin is composed of ΔDi-6S (1.3%), ΔDi-4S (91.5%), and ΔDi-di(2,4)S (7.2%), whereas DS from rooster comb is composed of ΔDi-0S (5.0%), ΔDi-6S (3.4%), ΔDi-4S (85.2%), and ΔDi-di(2, 4)S (6.3%) (data not shown). Because a highly sulfated oligosaccharide composed of repeating disulfated disaccharides interacted well with selectins and chemokines (Fig. 7), we think it possible that a difference in the amount of highly sulfated clusters containing IdoA(2-O-disulfate)α1–3GalNAc(4-O-disulfate) in these DS chains may in part explain the differential reactivity, although further structural characterization is required. Oversulfated CS/DS chains containing GlcAβ1/IdoAα1–3GalNAc(4,6-O-disulfate) have been found in squid cartilage (30.Suzuki S. Saito H. Yamagata T. Anno K. Seno N. Kawai Y. Furuhashi T. J. Biol.

Our results showing that oversulfated CS/DS chains containing GlcAβ1/IdoAα1–3GalNAc(4,6-O-disulfate) bind to proinflammatory molecules, such as selectins and chemokines, and regulate chemokine activity, further indicate the versatility of these oversulfated chains in regulating biological responses. It is now extremely important to understand the exact tissue distribution of the oversulfated CS/DS chains bearing the ability to interact with these proinflammatory molecules and the regulatory mechanisms whereby these GAGs are generated.

https://openalex.org/W2169350212,"DNA polymerase lambda (pol λ) is a novel family X DNA polymerase that has been suggested to play a role in meiotic recombination and DNA repair. The recent demonstration of an intrinsic 5′-deoxyribose-5-phosphate lyase activity in pol λ supports a function of this enzyme in base excision repair. However, the biochemical properties of the polymerization activity of this enzyme are still largely unknown. We have cloned and purified human pol λ to homogeneity in a soluble and active form, and we present here a biochemical description of its polymerization features. In support of a role in DNA repair, pol λ inserts nucleotides in a DNA template-dependent manner and is processive in small gaps containing a 5′-phosphate group. These properties, together with its nucleotide insertion fidelity parameters and lack of proofreading activity, indicate that pol λ is a novel β-like DNA polymerase. However, the high affinity of pol λ for dNTPs (37-fold over pol β) is consistent with its possible involvement in DNA transactions occurring under low cellular levels of dNTPs. This suggests that, despite their similarities, pol β and pol λ have nonredundant in vivo functions."

In the absence of Drosophilasegment polarity gene porcupine (porc), which encodes an endoplasmic reticulum (ER) multispanning transmembrane protein, the N-glycosylation of Wingless (Wg), one of Drosophila Wnt family, is impaired. In contrast, the ectopic expression of porc stimulates the N-glycosylation of both endogenously and exogenously expressed Wg. The N-glycosylation of Wg in the ER occurs posttranslationally, while in the presence of dithiothreitol, it efficiently occurs cotranslationally. Thus, the cotranslational disulfide bond formation of Wg competes with the N-glycosylation by an oligosaccharyl transferase complex. Porc binds the N-terminal 24-amino acid domain (residues 83–106) of Wg, which is highly conserved in the Wnt family and stimulates the N-glycosylation at surrounding sites. Porc is also necessary for the processing of Drosophila Wnt-3/5 in both embryos and cultured cells. Thus, Porc binds the N-terminal specific domain of the Wnt family and stimulates its posttranslational N-glycosylation by anchoring them at the ER membrane possibly through acylation.

They have been shown to have important roles for the decision of cell fate and behavior at multiple stages during development and cancer. They bind a family of specific receptors on the cell surface (Frizzled family) and activate the cell signaling pathways to elicit their effects on, for example, gene transcription (1.Cadigan K.M. Nusse R. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 3286-3305Crossref PubMed Scopus (2206) Google Scholar, 2.Polakis P. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 1837-1851PubMed Google Scholar). One of the hallmarks of the Wnt family is the existence of 23 or 24 cysteine residues at conserved positions in the protein molecules. It has been assumed that these cysteine residues may have a critical role for folding of Wnt proteins by disulfide bond formation. However, direct evidence demonstrating that biologically active Wnt proteins contain any intra- or intermolecular disulfide bonds has not been shown. The processing and secretion of Wnt proteins was studied with cultured cells engineered to express various Wnts (3.Smolich B.D. McMahon J.A. McMahon A.P. Papkoff J. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1993; 4: 1267-1273Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar, 4.Burrus L.W. McMahon A.P. Exp. Cell Res. 1995; 220: 363-373Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). The processing of Wnt is not efficient in most cell types, because multiple processing intermediates are present. Wnt is therefore not well secreted outside of the cells. Most of Wnt protein associates with a HSP70 protein, BiP, and is retained in the ER1(5.Kitajewski J. Mason J.O. Varmus H.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 784-790Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Meanwhile, wg mutants with lesions in the secretion and transport have been identified (6.van den Heuvel M. Harryman-Samos C. Klingensmith J. Perrimon N. Nusse R. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 5293-5302Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar, 7.Bejsovec A. Wieschaus E.

Development. 1998; 125: 4729-4738PubMed Google Scholar), suggesting that Wg processing and secretion is also complex in Drosophila. Caenorhabditis elegans Mom-3 appears to be necessary for Mom-2 (Wnt) processing or secretion in addition to Mom-1 (see below). Screening for genes involved in Wg signaling by Drosophila deficiency kits has also identified a new gene(s), whose product(s) is required for the processing or secretion of Wg (10.Muller H. Samanta R. Wieschaus E. Development. 1999; 126: 577-586Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These results indicate that the processing and secretion of Wnt are complex and that a number of specific factors are involved in these events. One of the Drosophila segment polarity genes,porcupine (porc) encodes a multipass transmembrane ER protein, which is required for the normal distribution of Wg in embryos (11.Kadowaki T. Wilder E. Klingensmith J. Zachary K. Perrimon N. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 3116-3128Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar). In porc mutant embryos, Wg is sequestered in its synthesizing cells and not distributed among the surrounding cells. Wg signaling components are well conserved in multicellular organisms, and porc homologs are also present in other species. C. elegans porc homolog mom-1was identified in a search for maternal genes necessary for endoderm formation (12.Rocheleau C.E. Downs W.D. Lin R. Wittmann C. Bei Y. Cha Y-H. Ali M. Priess J.R.

Cell. 1997; 90: 695-705Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (415) Google Scholar). Mom-1 is necessary in Mom-2 producing cells as Porc is required in Wg-synthesizing cells. Vertebrate (mouse and Xenopus) homologs of porc have been recently identified and shown to modify the N-glycosylation of Wg and mouse Wnt proteins in cultured cells (14.Tanaka K. Okabayashi K. Asashima M. Perrimon N. Kadowaki T. Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 4300-4311Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). These results demonstrate that the porc gene family encodes the evolutionary conserved ER membrane proteins involved in the processing of the Wnt family. In this study, the N-glycosylation of Wg in Drosophila S2 cells and imaginal discs was characterized in detail. We conclude that the cotranslational disulfide bond formation of Wg competes with the N-glycosylation and that Porc stimulates the posttranslational N-glycosylation by anchoring Wg at the ER membrane. Since Porc is suggested to be a member of the membrane-associated acyltransferase family, it may tether Wg to the ER membrane through acylation. Three C-terminal deleted (34, 66, and 110 amino acids) Porc mutants were generated by PCR with PorcHA28 cDNA (encoding Porc tagged with three HA epitopes at amino acid 28) as a template and the following primers: 5′-CGAGGCCTCTATTCCAGGTCATCGCCCAGCAGCAC-3′ (Δ34), 5′-CGAGGCCTCTAGGACAGGGAGTTCAATCGCCGTTT-3′ (Δ66), 5′-CGAGGCCTCTAGGCTAGGAACGCCAGCGAGATGAG-3′ (Δ110), and M13 reverse primer. The PCR products were then cloned in pCaspeR-hs. To construct a Myc epitope-tagged Wg, the DNA fragment encoding triple Myc epitopes was first PCR-amplified with pKK-1 (carrying an insert DNA encoding triple Myc epitopes) as a template and the following two primers: 5′-TACAGCTCGAGGGGTGAACAAAAGTTGATTTCTGAA-3′ and 5′-AATAGCTCGAGAAGGATCCGTTCAAGTCTTCTTCTG-3′. The PCR product was digested with XhoI and cloned in the same restriction enzyme site (at amino acid 111) of wg cDNA. This was then used as a template for PCR as described below. Deletion mutants of Myc epitope-tagged Wg were constructed by PCR with the following sets of primers: 5′-GTTATGCGGCCGCATGGATATCAGCTATATCTTCGTCATCTGCCTG-3′ and either 5′-CGTCTAGATTATCTATTATGCTTGCGTCCCTGACG-3′ (367), 5′-CGTCTAGATTAAGCGTTGGTGGCCCGGAGACTGTTGGTCAC-3′ (282), 5′-CGTCTAGATTAGGAGAACTTGAACCCGAATCCGATGTTGTC-3′ (196), or 5′-CGTCTAGATTACCTCGAGAAGGATCCGTTCAAGTCTTCTTC-3′ (111). The PCR products were digested with NotI and XbaI and cloned in the same restriction enzyme sites of pCaspeR-hs. The Wg mutants (T51A, S105A, S110A, and T416A) were constructed with the TaKaRa LA PCR in vitro mutagenesis kit and the following mutagenic primers: 5′-GTCCATGTACATGATGGGCGCAATGTTGTTGGGTTCGCCGA-3′ (T51A), 5′-CCTCGAGAAGTTTCTCGTCGCGCAGTTCCAGCGGCGATTTC-3′ (S105A), 5′-CGAATAGATTTTTGCCCCTCGCGAAGTTTCTCGTCG-3′ (S110A), and 5′-GCCGTCGACGCCCAGCGAGGCCTCATTGCACTGGCGGCCAT-3′ (T416A). These mutated wg cDNAs were then cloned in pCaspeR-hs. The S105A/T416A mutant was constructed by substituting the HpaI-BglII fragment of T416A mutant with that of S105A mutant. To construct bovine prolactin with Wg signal sequence (PRO), the DNA fragment encoding Wg signal sequence (amino acids 1–34 of Wg) was PCR-amplified with the wg cDNA as the template and the following primers: 5′-GGGGTACCATGGATATCAGCTATATCTTCGTC-3′ and 5′-CCGCTCGAGCCGGCCCCTTCCGGATTTCTGTTT-3′. The PCR product was digested with KpnI and XhoI. The DNA fragment encoding mature prolactin was PCR-amplified with prolactin cDNA as a template and the following primers: 5′-TAACTCTCGAGACCCCCGTCTGTCCCAATGGGCCTGGCAAC-3′ and 5′-TAACTGATATCGCAGTTGTTGTTGTAGATGATTCTGCAATT-3′. The PCR product was digested with XhoI and EcoRV. The above two PCR products were then ligated with KpnI- and EcoRV-digested pUC19 carrying DNA encoding the single Myc epitope. To construct RDN and VKG chimeric prolactin, the DNA fragments encoding amino acids 73–106 (RDN) and 83–106 (VKG) of Wg were PCR- amplified with the wg cDNA as the template and the following primers: 5′-TAACTCTCGAGCGTCGAGCAGTTCCAGCGGCGATTTCTGAA-3′ and either 5′-TAACTCTCGAGAGGGACAATCCCGGTGTACTGGGAGCCCTG-3′ (RDN) or 5′-TAACTCTCGAGGTCAAGGGCGCCAACTTGGCCATTAGCGAG-3′ (VKG). Each PCR product was digested with XhoI and cloned at the same restriction enzyme site of the above plasmid in a correct orientation. To construct GSM, the DNA fragment encoding amino acids 1–106 of Wg was PCR-amplified with the wg cDNA as the template and the following primers: 5′-GGGGTACCATGGATATCAGCTATATCTTCGTC-3′ and 5′-TAACTCTCGAGCGTCGAGCAGTTCCAGCGGCGATTTCTGAA-3′. The PCR product was digested with KpnI and XhoI and cloned at the same restriction enzyme sites of the above plasmid to replace the DNA fragment encoding the Wg signal sequence. All DNA fragments encoding the chimeric prolactins were cloned in the pCaspeR-hs. Myc epitope-tagged DWnt-3/5 was generated by PCR with DWnt-3/5cDNA as a template and the following primers: 5′-GGGGTACCATGAGTTGCTACAGAAAAAGGCAC-3′ and 5′-TACGCGATATCTTTACATGTGTGCTCCTCGAGTAC-3′. The PCR product was then cloned in pUC19 carrying a DNA fragment encoding the single Myc epitope. The Myc epitope-tagged DWnt-3/5 cDNA was finally cloned in the pCaspeR-hs. All PCR products were confirmed by DNA sequencing. Drosophila S2 cells in six-well plates were transiently transfected with 0.4 μg of the indicated DNA by Effectene reagent (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer's instruction. The expression of transfected genes was induced by heat-shocking the cells at 37 °C for 45 min. Tunicamycin was added to the cells at 1 h prior to heat shock and present throughout the experiment at 15 μg/ml. After heat shock induction, the cells were washed twice with methionine-free labeling medium and then incubated at 25 °C for 20 min in the same medium (0.5 ml/well). Labeling was initiated by adding 100 μCi of Redivue Pro-mixl-35S in vitro cell labeling mix (Pro-mix; Amersham Biosciences) and continued for 10 min at 25 °C. When the effect of dithiothreitol (DTT) was analyzed, it was added to the labeling medium at 30 s or 5 min before the addition of radioisotope (at the final concentration of 10 mm). For pulse-chase experiments, cells were washed twice with labeling medium supplemented with 0.5 mg/ml methionine after 10 min of pulse labeling and then chased in the same medium at 25 °C. After labeling, the cells were washed twice with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and then solubilized with radioimmune precipitation buffer containing protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). The cell lysates were centrifuged for 5 min, and then the supernatants were collected. The antibody was added to the supernatants and incubated for 1 h at 4 °C. Protein A-Sepharose was then added and incubated for 2 h at 4 °C. The beads were washed five times with radioimmune precipitation buffer, and then final pellets were suspended with reducing or nonreducing SDS-PAGE sample buffer. The lysate of S2 cells expressing wg was prepared by gently homogenizing the cells in 0.5 ml of lysis buffer (0.25 m sucrose, 1 mm DTT, and 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.3) with a glass homogenizer on ice. The cell lysate was then treated without trypsin or with 0.01% trypsin in the presence or absence of 1% TX-100 for 3 h on ice. Phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride was added at a final concentration of 20 mm, and then the reaction mixtures were transferred into 5 ml of 0.1 m Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1% SDS in a boiling water bath. Total proteins were precipitated with trichloroacetic acid followed by suspending in the SDS-PAGE sample buffer. Each band on Western blot was scanned and quantified by NIH Image software. After SDS-PAGE, the proteins in the gel were transferred to nitrocellulose membranes (Hybond ECL; Amersham Biosciences). The membranes were blocked with TBST containing 5% skim milk for 1 h at room temperature. They were then incubated with antibodies at the indicated dilutions at 4 °C overnight and then washed six times with TBST (each for 10 min). The horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies were added at 3000-fold dilution and incubated for 2 h at room temperature. The membranes were washed as above, and the signal detection was done by an ECL system (Amersham Biosciences). The imaginal discs expressing wg (wing, leg, and eye-antenna discs) were dissected from 50 wandering third instar larvae (OreR). They were homogenized in the nonreducing SDS-PAGE sample buffer and then divided into two equal parts. β-Mercaptoethanol was added to the one part at the final concentration of 2%. The lysates were analyzed by 10% SDS-PAGE followed by Western blot with anti-Wg mouse monoclonal antibody (4D4) as above, except 3% bovine serum albumin was used as a blocking reagent. 30 green fluorescent protein-positive (wild type) and negative (porc) third instar larvae were selected from a stock of FM7act-GFP/y w f porcPB16 and dissected in S2 medium. Similarly, 30 third instar larvae from a cross of UAS-porc and 69B were also dissected. The isolated discs were suspended in S2 medium and washed twice with methionine-free labeling medium and then suspended in 485 μl of the same medium. Labeling was initiated by adding 180 μCi of Pro-mix and continued for 1 h at 25 °C. The labeling medium was then removed, and the discs were suspended with radioimmune precipitation buffer containing protease inhibitor mixture. The cell lysates were prepared by homogenizing with plastic pestle in Eppendorf tubes. The immunoprecipitation was performed as described above. The radioactivities of forms II and III in each sample were measured by a Bioimage analyzer BAS2000 (Fuji), and their ratios were calculated. This experiment was repeated twice. Capped porc, porc3HA28, Δ34, Δ66, and Δ110 RNA was prepared by in vitro transcription. The size and quantity of each capped RNA was analyzed by gel electrophoresis. The same amount of RNA was injected into precellular blastoderms. The embryos were derived from females with homozygous svbYP17bporcPB16germ line clones crossed with FM7ftz-lacZ males.porc mutant embryos rescued as a result of RNA injection showed the svb phenotype (15.Gergen P. Wieschaus E.H. Roux's Arch. Dev. Biol. 1986; 195: 49-62Crossref Scopus (46) Google Scholar). The injected embryos were allowed to develop at 18 °C, and their cuticles were examined after 3 days. The embryos derived from females with homozygous porcPB16 germ line clones crossed with FM7ftz-lacZ males were immunostained with anti-DWnt-3/5 antibody (16.Fradkin L.G. Noordermeer J.N. Nusse R. Dev. Biol. 1995; 168: 202-213Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar) or BP102 (developed by C. S. Goodman and obtained from the Developmental Studies Hybridoma Bank) along with anti-β-galactosidase antibody. The signal was detected by rhodamine and horseradish peroxidase (for β-galactosidase)-conjugated secondary antibodies. In these experiments, germ line clones were generated with the FLP-DFS technique (17.Chou T.B. Perrimon N. Genetics. 1992; 131: 643-653Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Since Drosophila S2 cells were used to produce biologically active Wg (18.van Leeuwen F. Samos C.H. Nusse R. Nature. 1994; 368: 342-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar) and Xenopus Wnt-8 (19.Hsieh J.C. Rattner A. Smallwood P.M. Nathans J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 3546-3551Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar) in the medium, we analyzed the processing of Wg in this cell line. When wg is expressed in S2 cells, three forms of Wg with different molecular sizes are detected (forms I, II, and III). Since only form I is detectable in the presence of tunicamycin (an inhibitor of N-glycosylation), forms II and III contain N-linked glycan chains. In the presence of ectopic porc, form III is accentuated, and the largest form IV is also present (Fig. 1A). The forms II, III, and IV contain one, two, and three N-glycan chains, respectively (see Fig. 4B). The form III is the major protein detected in early Drosophila embryos (not shown) and imaginal discs (Fig. 1D). Thus, Wg is normally N-glycosylated at two sites, and Porc stimulates this processing in the ER. Furthermore, the overexpression of both wg and porc also induces the ectopic N-glycosylation of Wg at three sites.Figure 4Porc binds the N-terminal 24-amino acid domain (residues 83–106) of Wg and stimulates the N-glycosylation at Asn103.A, the N-glycosylation of the wild type (wt) and four deletion mutants (containing N-terminal 367, 282, 196, and 111 amino acids) of Myc epitope-tagged Wg was analyzed. Signal sequence cleaved but not glycosylated forms, which are synthesized in the presence of tunicamycin (Tun), are present in all cases. Wild type Wg is N-glycosylated at two major sites, whereas deletion mutants have a single N-glycan chain. Wild type, 367, and 282 proteins were separated by 12% SDS-PAGE, whereas 196 and 111 proteins were separated by 15% SDS-PAGE. B, the processing of Wg mutants, in which the potential N-glycosylation sites were knocked out, and wild type Wg (wt) was analyzed in the absence (−) and presence (+) of ectopic porc. The serine or threonine residues at the position number indicated in the Wg were substituted to alanine. C, the amino acid sequence near Asn103 (indicated by an arrowhead) of Wg is aligned with those of Drosophila and mouse Wnts. The conserved amino acids are indicated by asterisks. D, four Myc epitope-tagged chimeric proteins consisting of bovine prolactin (containing no N-glycosylation site) and either Wg signal sequence (amino acids 1–34 of Wg) (PRO) or the N-terminal 106 amino acids of Wg (GSM) or the Wg signal sequence plus amino acids 73–106 of Wg (RDN) or the Wg signal sequence plus amino acids 83–106 of Wg (VKG) were constructed. Three chimeric proteins (GSM, RDN, and VKG) but not PRO are N-glycosylated, and Porc enhances this processing event. E, the binding between Porc and chimeric proteins (PRO, RDN, and VKG) was analyzed by immunoprecipitation. The cell lysates expressing PorcHA28 and either PRO, RDN, or VKG were immunoprecipitated with anti-Myc antibody, and then the immunoprecipitates were analyzed by Western blot with anti-HA rat monoclonal antibody to detect the co-immunoprecipitated Porc. Porc is co-immunoprecipitated with RDN and VKG (with a lesser amount) but not PRO. The part of cell lysates was directly Western blotted with anti-HA rat monoclonal antibody to confirm that PorcHA28 is expressed at the same level in all cell lysates.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Forms I and II could be inside the ER or the translocational intermediates through the ER membrane. To distinguish these possibilities, the cells expressing wg were lysed in an isotonic buffer by gentle homogenization to disrupt the plasma membrane. Trypsin was then added with or without TX-100. After inactivating the protease, Wg was analyzed by Western blot. Forms I, II, and III are resistant to exogenous protease, demonstrating that they are inside the ER membrane (Fig. 1B). These results thus suggest that forms I and II are posttranslationally N-glycosylated in the ER (see also Fig. 2). As shown by percentage reduction, the form I is more susceptible against the exogenous protease than forms II and III, suggesting that some fraction of form I is the ER-translocating intermediate or the incompletely folded protein hypersensitive to protease. We then analyzed the N-glycosylation of endogenously expressed Wg in wild type, porc hemizygous mutant, and porc-overexpressing third instar larvae. Some of the hemizygous porc mutants with maternal porccontribution can develop to the third instar larvae, in which wg-dependent gene expression is lost (11.Kadowaki T. Wilder E. Klingensmith J. Zachary K. Perrimon N. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 3116-3128Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar). The overexpression of porc in the third instar larvae was achieved by crossing UAS-porc and 69B Gal 4 driver lines. Strong and uniform Gal4 expression in the discs (overlapping with wg expression domain) was observed with 69B (20.Brand A.H. Perrimon N. Development. 1993; 118: 401-415Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Wing, leg, and eye-antenna discs were dissected from the larvae, and then the N-glycosylation of Wg was analyzed by [35S]methionine labeling followed by immunoprecipitation. Forms II and III are detected by this analysis. Thus, the N-glycosylation of form II (resulting in form III) is more rate-limiting than that of form I in vivo. The ratios of the form III to II are 1.3, 0.6, and 5.2 in wild type, porchemizygous mutant, and porc-overexpressing discs, respectively (Fig. 1C). The form III is less synthesized in porc hemizygous mutant discs, indicating that the loss of the function of porc results in the inefficient N-glycosylation of endogenously expressed Wg. Meanwhile, the form III is predominantly synthesized in porc-overexpressing discs. Thus, the overexpression of porc stimulates the N-glycosylation of both endogenously (in discs) and exogenously (in S2 cells) expressed Wg. To address the state of endogenous Wg in vivo, Wg expressed in the imaginal discs of the third instar larvae was analyzed by reducing and nonreducing SDS-PAGE followed by Western blot. Fig. 1D shows that the endogenously expressed Wg is present as the monomer in vivo.Moreover, Wg migrates faster under nonreducing compared with reducing conditions, indicating that Wg folds by intramolecular disulfide bonds. Because Wg contains 23 cysteine residues and appears to form intramolecular disulfides in the imaginal discs (Fig. 1D), we tested whether disulfide bond formation has roles on the N-glycosylation of Wg. The N-glycosylation of Wg was compared in wg-expressing S2 cells with or without DTT. DTT has been used as a reversible inhibitor of disulfide bond formation of newly synthesized proteins in the ER (21.Braakman I. Helenius J. Helenius A. Nature. 1992; 356: 260-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar, 22.Braakman I. Helenius J. Helenius A. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 1717-1722Crossref PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar, 23.de Silva A. Braakman I. Helenius A. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 120: 647-655Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar, 24.Tatu U. Braakman I. Helenius A. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 2151-2157Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). The cells expressing wg alone and both wg and porc were treated with 10 mm DTT for 30 s before labeling. After 10 min of labeling with [35S]methionine in the continued presence of DTT, the cells in one well were washed twice with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline containing 20 mmN-ethylmaleimide, and the cell lysates were prepared with radioimmune precipitation buffer containing N-ethylmaleimide as above. The cells in two wells were washed and chased for 2 h either in the presence or absence of DTT. The same sets of cells were also analyzed by 10-min pulse labeling followed by a 2-h chase in the complete absence of DTT. The immunoprecipitates were analyzed by 10% SDS-PAGE under reducing and nonreducing conditions. As shown in Fig. 2A, in the complete absence of DTT, form I decreases, while forms II and III increase during the chase period. Under the same condition except with ectopic porc, the form III is synthesized more during the pulse, and forms I and II decrease while forms III and IV increase during the chase. In the cells treated with DTT for 30 s before labeling, form III is accentuated and becomes the major protein synthesized during the pulse. The sizes of all forms synthesized in the presence of DTT are larger than those synthesized in the absence of DTT. This is due to the alkylation of free cysteine residues by N-ethylmaleimide. During a 2-h chase period without DTT, forms II and III slightly increase, and form I disappears. In addition, the sizes of forms II and III become smaller, indicating that the free cysteine residues of Wg exposed by DTT form disulfide bonds and are not alkylated by N-ethylmaleimide (see Fig. 2B). The patterns of N-glycosylation do not change during the chase with DTT, except the amount of labeled Wg is reduced. Under the same condition as above except with ectopic porc, the level of forms I and II synthesized during the pulse becomes almost undetectable. Thus, the effects of DTT and Porc on the N-glycosylation of Wg are additive in the ER with partially reduced condition (treatment of cells with DTT for 30 s before labeling). The form IV appears during the chase without DTT but not with DTT, demonstrating that the continued presence of DTT for a long period (2 h) slows down the N-glycosylation. The analysis of the same samples by nonreducing 10% SDS-PAGE demonstrates that Wg forms both intra- and intermolecular disulfide bonds in S2 cells (Fig. 2B). The species of bands with and without ectopic porc are identical, indicating that Porc is not involved in disulfide bond formation. Consistent with the above results, Wg synthesized in the presence of DTT forms both intra- and intermolecular disulfide bonds during the chase without DTT. Porc does not affect this process. Meanwhile, wg-expressing S2 cells treated with DTT for 5 min before 10-min labeling (resulting in the ER with fully reduced condition) synthesize mostly the form III and the trace amount of forms I and II. Under this condition, Porc has almost no effects on the N-glycosylation (Fig. 2C). All of the above results suggest the following: 1) The N-glycosylation of Wg occurs posttranslationally; 2) Wg is efficiently N-glycosylated by a cotranslational manner if disulfide bond formation is inhibited; 3) Porc stimulates the posttranslational N-glycosylation of Wg without affecting disulfide bond formation. The effect of Porc on N-glycosylation is specific to Wg, since it does not modify the processing of partial Drosophila laminin β chain, which also forms both intra- and intermolecular disulfide bonds (not shown). As indicated in Fig. 2, A and B, by the arrowheads, Porc is likely to bind Wg in the cells. To test if the binding of Porc with Wg is essential for its activity, the C-terminal deletion mutants of Porc tagged with HA epitopes were constructed (HA-Δ34, -Δ66, and -Δ110 lack the C-terminal 34, 66, and 110 amino acids of Porc, respectively), and their effects on the N-glycosylation of Wg were analyzed. As shown in Fig. 3A, the amount of forms I and II increases with deletion mutants, and the synthesized ratios of three forms become similar to those in the absence of ectopic porc. This demonstrates that all deletion mutants have reduced activity on the N-glycosylation of Wg compared with wild type PorcHA28 (full-length Porc tagged with HA epitope), indicating that the C-terminal domain of Porc is essential for its function. We then analyzed if the C-terminal deleted Porc mutants can bind Wg. PorcHA28 is co-immunoprecipitated with Wg irrespective of the presence of tunicamycin. By contrast, the binding of C-terminal deletion mutants to Wg is reduced (Fig. 3B). These results suggest that Porc binds the Wg and that its C-terminal domain is essential for efficient binding. The intracellular localization of deletion mutants is not affected based on the indirect immunofluorescent analysis (not shown), excluding the possibility that their targeting to the ER membrane is impaired. The full-length PorcHA28 is functional in embryos, since it can rescue the phenotypes of porc embryos lacking both maternal and zygotic contribution of porc (referred as porc embryos hereafter) by RNA injection. By this assay, all deletion mutants fail to rescue the phenotypes of porc"

Mucin-type glycoproteins have clusters of a multitude of O-glycans whose synthesis is initiated by various UDP-GalNAc:polypeptide GalNAc-transferases (polypeptide-GalNAc-Ts1). After the addition of a GalNAc residue to a serine and/or threonine residue by polypeptide-GalNAc-T, sugar residues are sequentially transferred to the GalNAc on the peptide to form O-glycans.O-Glycans can be classified into several different groups according to their core structure. As illustrated in Fig. 1, there are at least eight core types. Core 1, Galβ1–3GalNAcα1-serine/threonine, is the major constituent of O-glycans in many cells. Core 2 is formed from core 1 by the addition of GlcNAc to GalNAc with a β1,6-linkage. Core 3, GlcNAcβ1–3GalNAcα-serine/threonine, is restricted in its occurrence to mucins from specialized tissues such as the colon. Core 4 is formed from core 3 by the addition of GlcNAc to GalNAc with a β1,6-linkage. Each core structure is expressed differentially in conjunction with the differentiation and malignant transformation of various cells and tissues (13.Piller F. Piller V. Fox R.I. Fukuda M. J. Biol.

In normal colonic tissue, the core 3 structure is the major form among O-glycans (18.Slomiany B.L. Zdebska E. Slomiany A. J. Biol.

It has been reported, however, that expression of the core 3 structure is down-regulated in colon cancer tissues and colon cancer cell lines, and the expression of core 1 and core 2 structures is up-regulated (12.Kim Y.S.

The many enzymes involved in synthesizing the core structure of O-glycan may compete with each other for the GalNAc-residue on mucins as substrate. The loss of the core 3 structure in cancerous tissues and cancer cell lines may be caused by down-regulation of the expression of the core 3 synthase. Core 3 activity was detected in normal colonic tissue; however, the enzyme responsible for synthesizing the core 3 structure has not been purified.

A. 1999; 96: 406-411Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar), was recently identified not to be a β3Gn-T at all, but a member of the β3Gal-T family, catalyzing a Gal to Gal transfer with a β1,3-linkage for the synthesis of the linkage structure of glycosaminoglycans (28.Bai X.

It was subsequently renamed β3Gal-T6. β3Gal-T3, which had originally been classified into the β3Gal-T family, was also found to be a β3GalNAc-T, based on its activity for globoside synthesis (29.Okajima T.

We found that all members of the β3Gal-T, β3Gn-T, and β3GalNAc-T families share amino acid motifs in three regions of the catalytic domain (24.Isshiki S. Togayachi A. Kudo T. Nishihara S. Watanabe M.

Although each member differs in its specificity for the donor and acceptor substrate, all exhibit transferring activity, which is consistent with a β1,3-linkage. They could be collected together in a group named the β1,3-glycosyltransferase (β3GT) family. We expected the core 3 synthase to be a member of the β3GT family because it catalyzes the synthesis of GlcNAcβ1–3GalNAc. None of the β3GT, which we isolated, showed apparent activity to produce core 3. Therefore, we searched the data bases to find novel genes having the β3GT motifs, and cloned and characterized a sixth member of family (β3Gn-T6). We identified β3Gn-T6 as the most logical candidate for the core 3 synthase. We performed a BLAST search of the expressed sequence tag data bases and identified two cDNAs (AW182889 and AW192172), homologous in amino acid sequence to the open reading frame (ORF) of β3Gn-T3 (25.Shiraishi N. Natsume A. Togayachi A. Endo T. Akashima T. Yamada Y. Imai N. Nakagawa S. Koizumi S. Sekine S. Narimatsu H. Sasaki K. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 3498-3507Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). On searching the human genomic DNA data base, we found that the two cDNAs mapped in the immediate vicinity of each other in a single contig (AP00752), having only a 26-bp gap. However, the 5′-region of this novel gene, which should be homologous to that of β3Gn-T3, was not present in the contig. To obtain this sequence, the 5′-rapid amplification of cDNA ends method was employed using a Marathon-Ready™ cDNA Amplification Kit (CLONTECH, Palo Alto, CA). Two reverse primers were designed for the first PCR, 5′-CTCCAGACACATGCCCATGTAGGC-3′, and for the nested PCR, 5′-GCCAGTCGAGCAAGTGCAGG-3′. A DNA fragment obtained by the 5′-rapid amplification of cDNA ends method was sequenced using an ABI PRISM BigDye™ Terminator Cycle Sequencing Ready Reaction Kit (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). The sequenced DNA fragment contained a part of the 5′-primer sequence of the cDNA (AW182889), a putative initiation codon, and a transmembrane domain. Finally, a cDNA encoding the full-length ORF of a novel family member was obtained by PCR using the Marathon-Ready™ cDNA of human stomach tissue (CLONTECH) as a template and subcloned into pDONR™201 vector (Invitrogen). The putative catalytic domain of β3Gn-T6 was expressed as a secreted protein fused with a FLAG peptide in insect cells according to the instruction manual of GATEWAY™ Cloning Technology (Invitrogen). An ∼1.0-kb DNA fragment encoding the putative catalytic domain of β3Gn-T6 (amino acids 44–384) was amplified by PCR using the Marathon-Ready™ cDNA of human stomach tissue (CLONTECH) as a template. The PCR was performed with a LA PCR™ Kit (TaKaRa, Shiga, Japan), according to the manual supplied. The forward and reverse primer sequences were flanked with attB1 and attB2 sequences, respectively, to create the recombination sites. The forward primer was 5′-GGGGACAAGTTTGTACAAAAAAGCAGGCTTCCAGGAGGAGACGCCAGAGGG-3′, and the reverse primer, 5′-GGGGACCACTTTGTACAAGAAAGCTGGGTCTGGCCTCAGGAGACCCGGTG-3′. The amplified fragment was inserted between the attP1 and attP2 sites of the pDONR™201 vector using the BP CLONASE Enzyme Mix (Invitrogen). Subsequently, the insert was transferred between the attR1 and attR2 sites of pFBIF linearized by NcoI using the LR CLONASE Enzyme Mix (Invitrogen). pFBIF is an expression vector derived from pFastBac1 (Invitrogen) and contains a fragment encoding a signal peptide of human immunoglobulin κ (MHFQVQIFSFLLISASVIMSRG), the FLAG peptide (DYKDDDDK), and a conversion site for the GATEWAY system. DH10BAC competent cells (Invitrogen) were transformed with the pFBIF containing the β3Gn-T6 catalytic domain, and then bacmid DNA was prepared from the cells. Sf21 insect cells (BD PharMingen, San Diego) were transfected with the prepared bacmid DNA. Recombinant virus was prepared according to the instruction manual of BAC-TO-BAC Baculovirus Expression Systems (Invitrogen). Recombinant viruses of the other β3Gn-Ts were also prepared as described previously (25.Shiraishi N. Natsume A. Togayachi A. Endo T. Akashima T. Yamada Y. Imai N. Nakagawa S. Koizumi S. Sekine S.

Sf21 insect cells were infected with each recombinant virus and incubated at 27 °C until the survival rate was less than 50% to yield secreted recombinant β3Gn-T proteins fused with the FLAG peptide. The culture media were mixed with anti-FLAG M1 antibody resin (Sigma). The protein-resin mixtures were washed twice with 50 mm Tris-buffered saline (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl) containing 1 mmCaCl2. Then the recombinant protein was eluted with 50 mm Tris-buffered saline buffer, pH 7.4, containing 1 mm EDTA. Five recombinant β3Gn-Ts, β3Gn-T2, -T3, -T4, -T5, and -T6, were purified and subjected to 10% SDS-PAGE for Western blot analysis using a Hybond™-P membrane (Amersham Biosciences). The membrane was probed with anti-FLAG M2 monoclonal antibody-conjugated peroxidase and stained with the Konica Immunostaining HRP-1000 (Konica, Tokyo, Japan). Each purified β3Gn-T was adjusted to the same amount according to the result of Western blotting. The basic reaction mixture for assaying Gn-T activity contained 50 mm sodium cacodylate buffer, pH 7.2, an appropriate concentration of UDP-GlcNAc, 10 mm MnCl2, 0.4% Triton CF-54, a suitable amount of acceptor substrate, and the purified enzyme. After incubation at 37 °C for 16 h, the product was analyzed by various techniques. The Gn-T activity was assayed by HPTLC in 25 μl of a basic reaction mixture, containing 500 μmUDP-GlcNAc (Sigma), 24 mm (175 nCi) UDP-[14C]GlcNAc (Amersham Biosciences), and 400 μm acceptor substrate. The acceptor substrates, summarized in Table I, were purchased from Calbiochem, Toronto Research Chemicals Inc. (Ontario, Canada), TaKaRa, and Sigma. Radioactive products were separated from the free UDP-[14C]GlcNAc using a Sep-Pak Plus C18cartridge (Waters, Milford, MA) as described below. The cartridge was activated by washing with 10 ml of 100% methanol and then washed twice with 10 ml of water. The enzyme reaction was terminated by the addition of 200 μl of water, and then the reaction mixture was applied to the equilibrated cartridge and washed twice with 10 ml of water. Elution of the radioactive product was achieved using 1 ml of 100% methanol. Eluted products were dried with a N2 evaporator and dissolved in 20 μl of 100% methanol. They were separated on a HPTLC plate (Merck) with a solvent system of chloroform, methanol, and 0.2% CaCl2 (55:45:10, v/v/v). The radioactive intensities of the bands were measured with a FLA-3000 Imaging Analyzer (Fujifilm, Tokyo).Table ISubstrate specificity of β3Gn-T6Acceptor substrateRelative activity% 1GalNAcα-pNPa100 2GalNAcβ-pNPb15 3GalNAcα1–3(Fucα1–2)Gal (blood group A)aND 4Asialo-GM2bND 5GM2bND 6Lyso-GM2cND 7Galα-pNPaND 8Galβ-oNPaND 9Glcα-pNPaND10Glcβ-pNPaND11GlcNAcα-pNPaND12GlcNAcβ-pNPaND13Fucα-pNPaND14Manα-BzdND15ManNAcα-BzdND16Xylα-pNPdND17Xylβ-oNPbND18Galβ1–4GlcNAcα-pNPd2.419Galβ1–3GalNAcα-pNP (core 1)dND20GlcNAcβ1–6(Galβ1–3)GalNAcα-pNP (core 2)dND21GlcNAcβ1–3GalNAcα-pNP (core 3)dND22GlcNAcβ1–6GalNAcα-pNP (core 6)dND23LacCerdND24GalCer type IbND25Lactoside-β-BzbND26GlobosidebNDAcceptor substrates were purchased froma Calbiochem,b Sigma,c TaKaRa, andd Toronto Research Chemicals, Inc.

A 10-μl aliquot of supernatant was subjected to HPLC on an ODS-80Ts QA column (4.6 × 250 mm; Tosoh, Tokyo). The reaction products were eluted with 30 ml of 12% acetonitrile containing 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid and H2O at a flow rate of 1.0 ml/min at 50 °C and monitored with an ultraviolet spectrophotometer (absorbance at 210 nm), SPD-10AVP (Shimadzu, Kyoto, Japan). Glycosylation of GalNAcα1-(N-trifluoracetyl)-l-threonine methyl ester was performed in 200 μl of a basic reaction mixture containing 10 mm UDP-GlcNAc and 5 mm threonine derivative. The enzyme reaction product was separated by HPLC as described above, the deuterium exchanged by subsequent lyophilization from D2O and dissolved again in 0.5 ml of D2O for NMR analysis. One-dimensional 1H and 13C NMR as well as two-dimensional 1H-1H COSY,1H-1H TOCSY, 1H NOESY, and1H-13C HMQC NMR experiments were performed at 298 K on a Bruker DMX-500, DMX-750, and JEOL ECP800 spectrometer. Chemical shifts are referenced to internal acetone (2.04 ppm for1H and 29.8 ppm for 13C). A fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-labeled oligopeptide, FITC-AHGVTSAPDTR, prepared commercially was purchased from Sawady Co., Ltd. (Tokyo). The peptide sequence was identical to that of Muc1a′ used as acceptor substrate for polypeptide-GalNAc-Ts (30.Wandall H.H. Hassan H. Mirgorodskaya E. Kristensen A.K. Roepstorff P. Bennett E.P.

In the present study, we cloned polypeptide-GalNAc-T6, one of the polypeptide-GalNAc-Ts, which had been reported previously (31.Bennett E.P. Hassan H. Mandel U. Hollingsworth M.A. Akisawa N. Ikematsu Y. Merkx G. van Kessel A.G. Olofsson S. Clausen H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 25362-25370Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar), by reverse transcriptase PCR. We expressed it in the baculovirus expression system, as described in the previous section, to obtain a recombinant form. Muc1a′ was glycosylated by use of GalNAc-T6, and the glycosylated peptide was isolated by HPLC (Waters 5C18-AR; 4.6 × 250 mm; 1.0 ml/min; gradient 0–50% acetonitrile in water containing 0.05% trifluoroacetic acid; fluorescence detection ex 492 nm, em 520 nm). The isolated fractions were subjected to MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry using ReflexTM III (Bruker Daltonics, Tsukuba, Japan) and protein sequencing analysis (Protein Sequencer PPSQ-23A, Shimadzu). Mass spectra were calibrated externally unless otherwise stated. The samples were dissolved in 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid to a concentration of 2 pmol/μl and prepared by mixing 1 μl of sample solution with 1 μl of matrix solution (2,5-dihydroxybenzoic acid, 10 mg/ml in 30% acetonitrile containing 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid) directly on the target. The glycosylated peptide was determined to have a GalNAc residue and the sequence of FITC-AHGVT(-GalNAc) SAPDTR. This GalNAc-glycosylated peptide was used as an acceptor for β3Gn-T6. Quantitative conversion of the glycopeptide was achieved after a 16-h incubation with β3Gn-T6 at 37 °C in 750 μl of a basic reaction mixture containing 5 mm UDP-GlcNAc and 170 nm acceptor. The transfer of GlcNAc by β3Gn-T6 to glycoproteins was performed in 20 μl of a basic reaction mixture containing 500 μmUDP-GlcNAc, 24 mm (175 nCi) UDP-[14C]GlcNAc, and 0.5 μg of bovine submaxillary gland mucin (BSM), 5 μg of fetuin, or 5 μg of asialofetuin. After incubation at 37 °C for 16 h, each 10 μl of the reaction mixture was subjected to 10% SDS-PAGE. The radioactive intensities of the bands were measured with a FLA-3000 Imaging Analyzer (Fujifilm). In the preliminary Northern blot analysis using commercially available human 12-Lane MNN™ Blot and human MTN® Blot III membranes (CLONTECH), we could not detect any positive bands. Therefore, we employed the real time PCR method, as described in detail previously (32.Gibson U.E. Heid C.A. Williams P.M. Genome Res. 1996; 6: 995-1001Crossref PubMed Scopus (1788) Google Scholar, 33.Heid C.A. Stevens J. Livak K.J. Williams P.M. Genome Res. 1996; 6: 986-994Crossref PubMed Scopus (5063) Google Scholar), for quantification of the β3Gn-T6 transcripts because the amount of the transcripts was found to be very small even in mRNAs derived from stomach and colon. Marathon Ready® cDNAs of various human tissues were purchased from CLONTECH. Standard curves for the β3Gn-T6 cDNA and the human glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) cDNA, as an endogenous control, were generated by serial dilution of a pDONRTM201 vector DNA containing the β3Gn-T6 gene encoding the putative catalytic domain (amino acids 44–384), and a pCR2.1(Invitrogen) DNA containing the GAPDH gene. The primer set and probe for β3Gn-T6 were as follows: the forward primer, 5′-CCTGCATGTACCGCGAGTT-3′; the reverse primer, 5′-CCACATGAGCAGCATCTCGT-3′; and the probe, 5′-TGCTAGTGCACCGCT-3′. For GAPDH, we used Pre-Developed TaqMan® Assay Reagents Endogenous Human GAPDH (Applied Biosystems). Primers, probes, and cDNAs were added to the TaqMan Universal PCR Master Mix (Applied Biosystems) which contained all reagents for PCR. The PCR conditions included 1 cycle at 50 °C for 2 min, 1 cycle at 95 °C for 10 min, 50 cycles at 95 °C for 15 s, and 60 °C for 1 min. PCR products were measured continuously with an ABI PRISM 7700 Sequence Detection System (Applied Biosystems). The relative amount of β3Gn-T6 transcript was normalized to the amount of GAPDH transcript in the same cDNA. We obtained a cDNA of a new member of the β3GT family as described under “Experimental Procedures” and named it β3Gn-T6. An alignment of the amino acid sequences of five β3Gn-Ts made using ClustalW is shown in Fig. 2. The 1155-bp (384 amino acids) ORF of β3Gn-T6 encoded a typical type II membrane protein, the same as in other β3Gn-Ts, consisting of an N-terminal cytoplasmic domain of 12 residues, a transmembrane segment of 19 residues, and a stem region and catalytic domain of 353 residues (Fig. 2). β3Gn-T6 showed 41, 54, 42, and 35% identity to β3Gn-T2, β3Gn-T3, β3Gn-T4, and β3Gn-T5, respectively, and the sequence similarity was limited to the putative catalytic domains. The three motifs shared by the members of the β3GT family (24.Isshiki S. Togayachi A. Kudo T. Nishihara S. Watanabe M. Kubota T. Kitajima M. Shiraishi N. Sasaki K. Andoh T. Narimatsu H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 12499-12507Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar) were present in the predicted positions in the putative amino acid sequence of β3Gn-T6. The five cysteines residues were conserved in the five β3Gn-Ts, indicating that some would be essential for maintaining the tertiary structure. A triplet of aspartic acid residues, DDD, which may be a divalent cation binding site as proposed in a crystallization study of other glycosyltransferases (34.Gastinel L.N. Cambillau C. Bourne Y. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 3546-3557Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar), was also conserved. Three possible N-glycosylation sites were found in the primary sequence of β3Gn-T6. One of them was conserved in all β3Gn-Ts. The β3Gn-T6 gene was found to be localized to a draft genome sequence (GenBank accession no. AP00752) which was mapped to 11q14 on the human chromosome, and its ORF was composed of a single exon. The calculated molecular mass of the FLAG-tagged recombinant β3Gn-T6, is 43 kDa; however, a major band of 46.6 kDa was observed, but no band was detected around 43 kDa on Western blot analysis. This result suggested that the recombinant protein would be glycosylated in insect cells. The glycosyltransferase activities of β3Gn-T6 were examined by a HPTLC analysis of Gn-T and Gal-T activities and HPLC analysis of GalNAc-T activity. No Gal-T or GalNAc-T activity toward any acceptor substrate was observed (data not shown). The substrate specificities of β3Gn-T6 are summarized in Table I. The activity toward GalNAcα-pNP was the strongest. Thus, the activity of β3Gn-T6 for GalNAcα-pNP is presented as 100%, and all other activities are given as relative values in Table I. β3Gn-T6 exhibited 15% activity toward GalNAcβ-pNP; 2.4% activity for Galβ1–4GlcNAcα-pNP; and no activity toward the other acceptors. β3Gn-T6 preferred GalNAcα-pNP over GalNAcβ-pNP as an acceptor. This result is consistent with that of a previous study (35.Vavasseur F. Yang J.M. Dole K. Paulsen H. Brockhausen I. Glycobiology. 1995; 5: 351-357Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). β3Gn-T6 exhibited no activity toward the α-GalNAc residue of blood group A and the core 6 substrates (substrates 3 and 22 in Table I). It also showed no activity toward the β-GalNAc residue of gangliosides, asialo-GM2, GM2, and lyso-GM2 (substrates 4, 5, and 6 in Table I). The amounts of each of the five β3Gn-Ts were made equal for assaying the relative activity to transfer GlcNAc to GalNAcα-pNP (Table II). The β3Gn-T6 activity is presented as 100%. All other activities are given as relative values. The Gn-T activities of β3Gn-T6 and -T2 were detectable, but those of the others were not. Although β3Gn-T2 transferred GlcNAc to GalNAcα-pNP, its relative activity was only 2.4%. In our previous study (25.Shiraishi N. Natsume A. Togayachi A. Endo T. Akashima T. Yamada Y. Imai N.

We used a C-terminally displayed phage peptide library to identify optimal ligands for the Erbin PDZ domain. Phage-selected peptides were type 1 PDZ ligands that bound with high affinity and specificity to the Erbin PDZ domain in vitro. These peptides most closely resembled the C-terminal PDZ domain-binding motifs of three p120-related catenins: δ-catenin, ARVCF, and p0071 (DSWV-COOH). Analysis of the interactions of the Erbin PDZ domain with synthetic peptides matching the C termini of ARVCF or δ-catenin also demonstrated specific high affinity binding. We characterized the interactions between the Erbin PDZ domain and both ARVCF and δ-catenin in vitro and in vivo. The Erbin PDZ domain co-localized and coprecipitated with ARVCF or δ-catenin complexed with β-catenin and E/N-cadherin. Mutagenesis and peptide competition experiments showed that the association of Erbin with the cadherin-catenin complex was mediated by the interaction of its PDZ domain with the C-terminal PDZ domain-binding motifs (DSWV-COOH) of ARVCF and δ-catenin. Finally, we showed that endogenous δ-catenin and Erbin co-localized in and co-immunoprecipitated from neurons. These results suggest that δ-catenin and ARVCF may function to mediate the association of Erbin with the junctional cadherin-catenin complex.

PDZ domains predominantly mediate protein/protein interactions by recognizing the C termini of various intracellular and cell-surface proteins. Type 1 PDZ domains interact with the C-terminal consensus sequence X(S/T)X(V/I/L)-COOH, whereas type 2 domains bind to the C-terminal consensus sequence X-hydrophobe-X-hydrophobe-COOH (3.Harris B.

Structural analyses of peptides bound to PDZ domains suggest necessary interactions at both positions 0 and −2 (6.Doyle D.A. Lee A. Lewis J. Kim E. Sheng M. Mackinnon R.

However, among type 1 PDZ ligands, these residues are relatively invariant, indicating that other residues within the C terminus likely contribute to the specificity of PDZ domain/ligand interactions (3.Harris B. Lim W. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 3219-3231Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). For example, two previous studies (9.Fuh G. Pisabarro M.T. Li Y. Quan C. Lasky L.A. Sidhu S. J. Biol.

Genetic evidence supports a role for several families of PDZ domain-containing proteins as scaffolding molecules that target signaling complexes to various subcellular locations. For example, the multi-PDZ domain protein INAD was found to assemble components of the Drosophila visual transduction system to allow for efficient signaling in response to light (12.Tsunoda S.

Genet. Dev. 1998; 8: 419-422Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Another study in the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans demonstrated that the basolateral localization of the LET-23 receptor tyrosine kinase is dependent upon direct binding to the PDZ domain of LIN7 (14.Kaech S.M. Whitfield C.W. Kim S.K. Cell. 1998; 94: 761-771Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar, 15.Rongo C. Whitfield C.W. Rodal A. Kim S.K. Kaplan J.M. Cell. 1998; 94: 751-759Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). Mutations that disrupt this interaction cause the mislocalization of the LET-23 receptor tyrosine kinase and a subsequent loss of LET-23 signal transduction activity. Together with a variety of other studies, these data suggest that a major function of the PDZ domains embedded within scaffolding proteins is to assemble signaling complexes at specific subcellular locations. Erbin is a recently described member of the LAP protein family (16.Borg J. Marchetto S. LeBivic A. Ollendorf V. Jaulin-Bastard F. Saito H. Fournier E. Adelaide J. Margolis B. Birnbaum D. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 407-414Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar). LET-413, the ortholog most closely related to human Erbin (and human Densin-180) in the C. elegans genome, is a basolateral protein that plays a critical role in the polarization of adherens junctions. Specifically, loss of LET-413 expression causes a failure in apically directed compaction of the adherens junction during epidermal cell maturation and results in defective cell/cell adhesion (17.Legouis R. Gansmuller A. Sookhareea S. Bosher J. Baillie D. Labouesse M. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 415-422Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar, 18.McMahon L. Legouis R. Vonesch J. Labouesse M. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 2265-2277PubMed Google Scholar). HER2 is an epidermal growth factor receptor-related tyrosine kinase that is amplified in a high percentage of metastatic breast tumors and is a causal factor in the development of some breast cancers (19.Klapper L. Kirschbaum M. Sela M. Yarden Y. Adv. Cancer Res. 2000; 77: 25-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (517) Google Scholar). HER2 is found on the basolateral membrane of epithelial cells and has a putative PDZ domain-binding motif at its C terminus that is required for this localization (16.Borg J. Marchetto S. LeBivic A. Ollendorf V. Jaulin-Bastard F. Saito H. Fournier E. Adelaide J. Margolis B. Birnbaum D. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 407-414Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar). Analogous to the LET-23 receptor tyrosine kinase described above, deletion of the HER2 PDZ domain-binding motif results in the aberrant accumulation of HER2 on the apical plasma membrane, presumably due to an inability to interact with a PDZ domain-containing protein necessary for its targeting to or retention at the basolateral membrane (16.Borg J. Marchetto S. LeBivic A. Ollendorf V. Jaulin-Bastard F. Saito H. Fournier E. Adelaide J. Margolis B. Birnbaum D. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 407-414Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar). Erbin has been reported as the protein that mediates basolateral localization of the HER2 receptor through direct binding of its single PDZ domain to the HER2 C terminus (16.Borg J. Marchetto S. LeBivic A. Ollendorf V. Jaulin-Bastard F. Saito H. Fournier E. Adelaide J. Margolis B. Birnbaum D. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 407-414Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar). Because of the potential therapeutic value of disrupting HER2 basolateral targeting, we initially set out to identify peptide ligands for the Erbin PDZ domain that could block its interaction with the HER2 C terminus. To do this, we used a recently described phage system that displays a highly diverse and random assortment of short peptides fused to the C terminus of the M13 gene-8 major coat protein (9.Fuh G. Pisabarro M.T. Li Y. Quan C. Lasky L.A. Sidhu S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 21486-21491Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Using two PDZ domains from the protein MAGI-3, it was previously demonstrated that this system could be utilized to obtain high affinity peptides that resemble either type 1 or 2 PDZ domain-binding motifs, depending on the PDZ domain used for selection. We used this system to isolate peptides that bind optimally to the Erbin PDZ domain. Surprisingly, analysis of the Erbin PDZ domain-binding peptides revealed that they more closely resembled the C termini of three p120-like catenins (δ-catenin, ARVCF, and p0071) than the C terminus of HER2 (20.Anastasiadis P. Reynolds A. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 1319-1334Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Subsequent biochemical and cell biological studies focusing on δ-catenin and ARVCF demonstrated that the interaction with Erbin is of high affinity and specificity. Together, these results suggest that δ-catenin and ARVCF bind to the Erbin PDZ domain in vivo. A previously described library of random heptapeptides fused to the C terminus of the M13 gene-8 major coat protein was cycled through rounds of binding selections with a bacterially expressed GST-Erbin PDZ domain fusion protein coated on 96-well Maxisorp immunoplates (NUNC) as the capture target. Phage were propagated in Escherichia coli XL1-Blue (Stratagene) in medium supplemented with M13-VCS helper phage (Stratagene) to facilitate phage production and 10 μm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside to induce expression of the library. After three rounds of selection, individual phage were isolated and analyzed in a phage ELISA (21.Sidhu Lowman S. Cunningham H.B. Wells J. Methods Enzymol. 2000; 328: 333-363Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Phage that bound to the GST-Erbin PDZ domain fusion protein, but not to a control GST fusion protein, were subjected to DNA sequence analysis. The binding affinities of peptides for the Erbin PDZ domain were determined as IC50 values using a previously described competition ELISA (9.Fuh G. Pisabarro M.T. Li Y. Quan C. Lasky L.A. Sidhu S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 21486-21491Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). The IC50 value was defined as the concentration of peptide that blocked 50% of PDZ domain binding to immobilized peptide. Assay plates were prepared by immobilizing an N-terminally biotinylated peptide (TGWETWV-COOH) on Maxisorp plates coated with neutravidin (Pierce) and blocked with bovine serum albumin (Sigma). A fixed concentration of the GST-Erbin PDZ domain fusion protein (50 nm) in PBT buffer (PBS containing 0.5% bovine serum albumin and 0.1% Tween 20 (Sigma)) was preincubated for 3 h with serial dilutions of peptide and then transferred to the assay plates. After a 15-min incubation, the plates were washed with PBS containing 0.05% Tween 20, incubated with a mixture of anti-GST antibody (0.5 μg/ml; Zymed Laboratories Inc.) and horseradish peroxidase-conjugated rabbit anti-mouse IgG antibody (1:2000 dilution; Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, Inc.) in PBT buffer, washed again, and detected with 3,3′,5,5′-tetramethylbenzidine/H2O2 peroxidase substrate (Kirkegaard & Perry Laboratories Inc.) A motif-searching algorithm was used to identify proteins with C termini that resemble the phage-displayed peptides selected for binding to the Erbin PDZ domain. Alignment of phage-derived peptides established a clear consensus sequence of (D/E)(T/S)WV-COOH as the preferred motif for tight binding to the Erbin PDZ domain. We used this consensus sequence to search the Dayhoff Database, restricting our search criteria to the C-terminal residues of proteins within the data base. Using these criteria, we identified 25 proteins that end with this C-terminal motif. Non-vertebrate proteins as well as one extracellular protein (PDZ domains are cytoplasmic) were manually filtered out, leaving a total of 18 sequences that fit our criteria. Of these, several are orthologs or simply separate GenBankTM/EBI Data Bank entries of the same gene product. Final examination of the 18 sequences indicated that three unique intracellular gene products were represented: δ-catenin, ARVCF, and p0071 (plakophilin-4). These three proteins are all members of the Armadillo family of proteins, which, based on their four C-terminal residues, are candidate in vivo ligands for the Erbin PDZ domain. Expression constructs containing the six individual PDZ domains of MAGI-3 were constructed by PCR cloning using a full-length cDNA of human MAGI-3 (22.Wu Y. Dowbenko D. Spencer S. Laura R. Lee J. Gu Q. Lasky L.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 21477-21485Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar) cloned into the pcDNA3.1V5/His-TOPO cloning vector (Invitrogen) as the template. The PDZ1 (amino acids 417–535), PDZ2 (amino acids 584–707), PDZ3 (amino acids 741–840), and PDZ4 (amino acids 870–976) domains were cloned into the BamHI/NotI sites of pEBG, creating fusions with the C terminus of GST. Regions of MAGI-3 containing the PDZ0 (amino acids 1–406) and PDZ5 (amino acids 980–1150) domains were cloned into the HindIII/SalI sites of pEGFP-N3 (CLONTECH), creating fusions with the N terminus of EGFP. The PDZ domain of human Erbin (amino acids 1273–1371, corresponding to GenBankTM/EBI Data Bank accession numberAF263744) was amplified from expressed sequence tag AA992250 and cloned into three different vectors: 1) the pcDNA3.1NT/GFP-TOPO TA cloning vector (Invitrogen), creating a fusion with the C terminus of GFP; 2) the XhoI/SacII sites of pDsRed1-N1 (CLONTECH), creating a fusion with the N terminus of RFP; and 3) the BamHI/NotI sites of pEBG, creating a fusion with the C terminus of GST. Human HER2 was cloned into pRK, and this construct has been previously described (23.Schaefer G. Akita R. Sliwkowski M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 859-866Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Human δ-catenin and δ-catenin Δc6, a form of δ-catenin missing the C-terminal six amino acid residues, were PCR-cloned into pEGFP-C1 (CLONTECH), creating fusions with the C terminus of EGFP. A proteolytically stable mutant form of β-catenin (24.Munemitsu S. Albert I. Rubenfeld B. Polakis P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 4088-4094Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) was cloned into pEGFP-C1, creating a fusion with the C terminus of EGFP. Human ARVCF cloned into the pcDNA3.1 vector (Invitrogen) has been described (25.Mariner D. Wang J. Reynolds A. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 1481-1490PubMed Google Scholar) and was a gift from the laboratory of Dr. Albert Reynolds. Full-length Myc-tagged Erbin has been described (26.Huang Y. Wang Q. Xiong W. Mei L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 19318-19326Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar) and was a gift from the laboratory of Dr. Lin Mei. The Erbin PDZ domain (amino acids 1217–1371) or the MAGI-3 PDZ2 domain (amino acids 584–707) were cloned into the EcoRI/NotI or BamHI/NotI sites of the E. coli expression vectors pGEX6P-1 and pGEX4T-3 (Amersham Biosciences), respectively. The PDZ domain of human Densin-180 (amino acids 1424–1537, corresponding to GenBankTM/EBI Data Bank accession number AF434715) was cloned into the BamHI/NotI sites of pGEX. Expression and affinity purification of E. colicell-expressed GST proteins (Amersham Biosciences) were carried out as recommended by the manufacturer. HEK 293 and Caco-2 cells were grown in high glucose Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, 10% fetal calf serum, 1× nonessential amino acid supplement, 1× l-glutamine supplement, 10 mm HEPES (pH 7.4), and penicillin/streptomycin (Invitrogen). For heterologous expression of proteins, HEK 293 cells were grown to ∼70% confluence and transfected with DNA using FuGENE 6 reagent (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Transfected cells (20–36 h) were rinsed with PBS, scraped into 1 ml/10-cm dish of homogenization buffer (20 mm Tris (pH 7.5), 1% Triton X-100, 125 mm NaCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and protease inhibitor mixture with EDTA (Roche Molecular Biochemicals)), incubated on ice for 10 min, triturated five times, and clarified by centrifugation for 10 min at 12,000 rpm in a refrigerated Eppendorf tabletop centrifuge. Protein concentrations in the clarified extracts were determined using BCA reagents (Pierce) and then normalized for all transfectants by addition of homogenization buffer. Extracts were snap-frozen as aliquots in a dry ice/ethanol bath and stored at −80 °C until used. Caco-2 extracts were prepared from cells grown for 10 days post-confluence. Cells from each 10-cm dish were homogenized with five strokes of a Dounce with a loose pestle (Wheaton) in 1 ml of homogenization buffer, and subsequent extracts were then prepared and stored exactly as described for HEK 293 cells. For brain extracts, mouse brain neocortices were dissected and homogenized in homogenization buffer using 5 ml of buffer/g of tissue. Lysates were precleared at 13,000 × g for 20 min at 4 °C. Protein concentrations in the clarified extracts were determined using BCA reagents. Extracts were snap-frozen as aliquots in a dry ice/ethanol bath and stored at −80 °C until used. For peptide pull-down experiments with individually expressed PDZ domains (see Fig. 1), 50–100 μl of HEK 293 cell extract was diluted to 400 μl with homogenization buffer and incubated with 10 μm N-terminally biotinylated peptide and 100 μl of streptavidin-agarose (Sigma) for 2 h on a rotator at 4 °C. The beads were washed three times with 1 ml of binding buffer and boiled in 60 μl of Laemmli reducing sample buffer, 15 μl of which was loaded onto SDS gels along with 10 μl of diluted extract for immunoblot analysis. Peptide pull-down experiments with Caco-2 cell extracts were slightly modified such that 700 μl of undiluted protein extract and 150 μl of streptavidin-agarose beads were used for these experiments. For GST pull-down experiments with HEK 293 cell-expressed δ-catenin, δ-catenin Δc6, ARVCF, β-catenin, and HER2, 100 μl of extract was diluted to 800 μl in homogenization buffer and re-clarified by centrifugation. The diluted extracts were then incubated with 3 μg of E. coli cell-expressed GST fusion protein plus 35 μl of glutathione-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences) for 2 h on a rotator at 4 °C. Beads were washed three times, and bound proteins were detected by immunoblot analysis. For GST pull-down assays of brain, 1 mg of total brain extract was diluted to a final concentration of 1 mg/ml with homogenization buffer and then re-clarified by centrifugation. Using 800 μl of the diluted clarified extract, GST pull-down assays were carried out exactly as described for HEK 293 cell extracts. For coprecipitation and co-immunoprecipitation experiments (see Fig. 2), cotransfected HEK 293 cells were solubilized in 1 ml of homogenization buffer/10-cm dish, and clarified extracts were obtained as described above. 800 μl of fresh undiluted extract was then mixed with 35 μl of glutathione-Sepharose for coprecipitation or with 5 μg of anti-Myc monoclonal antibody + 30 μl of protein A/G-Sepharose (Pierce) for co-immunoprecipitation and incubated for 2 h at 4 °C on a wheel. The beads were washed three times with 1 ml of homogenization buffer, and precipitated proteins were detected by immunoblotting. To test whether Erbin PDZ domain-binding peptides could block in vivo coprecipitations, cotransfected cells were incubated with peptides for either 6 h (Antennapedia-coupled peptides) or 24 h (fluorescein-coupled peptides) prior to cell harvest. The Antennapedia peptide (CRQIKIWFQNRRMKWKK) was disulfide-linked to a cysteine residue located at the N terminus of either a high affinity phage-derived peptide (CTGWETWV) or a cognate Val-to-Ala substituted negative control peptide (CTGWETWA). Entry into the reducing intracellular environment results in cleavage of the disulfide bond, thus releasing the free PDZ domain-binding peptide in the cytoplasm. For co-immunoprecipitations from brain, brain extracts were thawed, diluted to 1 mg/ml in homogenization buffer, centrifuged, and pre-absorbed against normal mouse IgG (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) bound to protein A/G-Sepharose for 1 h on a rotating wheel. The pre-clarified brain extracts (0.5 ml) were then immunoprecipitated with 5 μg of the indicated monoclonal antibody and 20 μl of protein A/G-Sepharose. Immunoprecipitated protein-antibody complexes were eluted from the beads by boiling for 5 min in the presence of 30 μl of 2× Laemmli sample buffer. 15 μl of the immunoprecipitated samples and 20 μl of both pre- and post-immunoprecipitation extracts were loaded onto 6% Tris/glycine-acrylamide gels and transferred to nitrocellulose for immunoblot analysis. For peptide-blocking experiments, the only modification was that, prior to immunoprecipitations, clarified extracts were preincubated with peptides for 2 h on ice. HEK 293 cells were grown to 70% confluence on collagen IV-coated coverslips and then transfected with the indicated DNA constructs using FuGENE 6 reagent. 24 h post-transfection, the cells were washed with PBS, fixed for 30 min in 2.5% formaldehyde, permeabilized with 0.25% Triton X-100 in PBS, and blocked with 5% donkey serum. The Erbin PDZ domain and δ-catenin constructs were RFP and EGFP fusions, respectively; and thus, they could be directly visualized. ARVCF and HER2 were visualized by staining cells with antibodies directed against these proteins and with fluorescein-coupled anti-rabbit secondary antibodies (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, Inc.). Coverslips were mounted on slides using Vectashield mounting medium with 4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (Vector Labs, Inc.) and sealed with rubber cement. Images were taken on a Zeiss Axiophot fluorescence microscope attached to a digital CCD camera with a ×63 oil immersion objective using SPOT imaging software (Research Diagnostics Inc.). Hippocampal neurons were dissected from the cortices of embryonic day 18 rats (Taconic Farms Inc.), dissociated, and plated onto poly-l-lysine-coated coverslips in neurobasal medium supplemented with 2 mm glutamine and vitamin B27 supplements (Invitrogen). After 3 weeks in culture, neurons were fixed for 15 min in 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS (pH 7.4), washed with PBS, and permeabilized using 0.25% Triton X-100 in PBS. Nonspecific sites were blocked with 10% goat serum diluted in 0.025% Triton X-100 in PBS. Primary antibodies were diluted to a final concentration of 2 μg/ml for Erbin and 2.5 μg/ml for δ-catenin in 1% goat serum and 0.025% Triton X-100 in PBS. The neurons were incubated with primary antibody overnight at 4 °C and then washed three times with PBS before being placed with Alexa 594-conjugated goat anti-rabbit antibody (Molecular Probes, Inc.) diluted to a final concentration of 4 μg/ml in PBS for 1 h at room temperature. The neurons were washed again three times with PBS and incubated with Alexa 484-conjugated goat anti-mouse antibody diluted to a final concentration of 4 μg/ml in PBS for 1 h at room temperature. The coverslips were washed twice with PBS, followed by a 5-min wash with Sörenson's phosphate buffer (pH 7.4) to rinse off excess salt. Finally, the coverslips were mounted on microscope slides using an aqueous mounting solution supplemented with antifade reagents (Gel/Mount, Biomeda). Images were acquired using a Zeiss Axiovert S100 microscope with a ×100 objective coupled to a Bio-Rad MRC1024 confocal laser scanning unit equipped with a krypton/argon lamp. Any pixel labeled with an emitted fluorescent signal of intensity >130 units/pixel in both the red and green channels was considered to be a region of protein co-localization. Female adult Sprague-Dawley rats (Taconic Farms Inc.) were anesthetized with an intraperitoneal injection of 3% chloral hydrate solution (3.5 mg/10 g of body weight) and transcardially perfused using an ice-cold fix solution composed of 4% paraformaldehyde and 7% picric acid in 0.1 m Sörenson's phosphate buffer (pH 7.4). The cerebellum and cortex were removed and post-fixed for 2 h in the fix solution at 4 °C and then transferred overnight to a solution of 30% sucrose and 0.1 m Sörenson's phosphate buffer at 4 °C. 30-μm-thick coronal sections were cut using a freezing microtome. Free floating sections were rinsed with 0.1m PBS and blocked with 1% normal goat serum (Vector Labs, Inc.) and 0.02% Triton X-100 in PBS for 1 h at room temperature. The sections were then incubated overnight at 4 °C with primary antibody diluted in 1% normal goat serum and 0.02% Triton X-100 in PBS. Anti-Erbin and anti-δ-catenin antibodies were diluted to 2 and 2.5 μg/ml final concentrations, respectively. Sections were washed three times with PBS and then incubated for 1 h with Alexa 594-conjugated goat anti-rabbit antibody diluted to a 4 μg/ml final concentration in 1% normal goat serum in PBS. Excess antibody was removed by three washes with PBS. The sections were then incubated with Alexa 488-conjugated goat anti-mouse antibody diluted to a final concentration of 4 μg/ml in 1% normal goat serum in PBS. Finally, the sections were washed twice with PBS and once with 0.1 mSörenson's phosphate buffer before being mounted onto positively charged slides (ProbeOn Plus, Fisher). The sections were imaged as described above. Anti-Erbin antibodies were obtained from rabbits injected with residues 1217–1371 of this protein fused to GST. Antibodies were affinity-purified against the antigen immobilized on cyanogen bromide-activated Sepharose. From this purified pool of antibodies reactive against both GST and Erbin, the GST-reactive antibodies were completely depleted against similarly immobilized GST-Sepharose, creating pure pools of antibodies against either Erbin or GST. Monoclonal antibodies against δ-catenin, p120 catenin, β-catenin, and γ-catenin were from BD Transduction Labs. Rabbit anti-GFP antibody was from CLONTECH. Rabbit anti-HER2 antibody was from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Rabbit anti-LIN7-3 antibody (Velis-3) and monoclonal antibodies against N-cadherin or E-cadherin (HECD-1) were from Zymed Laboratories Inc. Anti-ARVCF antibodies were a gracious gift from the laboratory of Dr. Albert Reynolds. Previously described C-terminally displayed phage peptide libraries (9.Fuh G. Pisabarro M.T. Li Y. Quan C.

Phage particles that bound to the Erbin PDZ domain were isolated, and the sequences of the displayed C-terminal peptides were examined. A clear consensus sequence was present in the phage-selected peptides (Table I). As has been found with virtually all previously examined ligands for type 1 PDZ domains (3.Harris B. Lim W. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 3219-3231Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), the C-terminal residue (position 0) was found to be hydrophobic. The Erbin PDZ domain specifically favored Val over Ile and Leu, which are also commonly found at this position. The residue selected at position −1 was exclusively Trp. Position −2 was observed to be either Thr or Ser, with a rare Val residue selected. Because of the preponderance of Thr or Ser at this position, the Erbin PDZ domain appears to be a type 1 domain.

This family of kinases is characterized by the presence of an N-terminal SQ-TQ cluster, followed by a Forkhead-associated domain and a C-terminal kinase domain. The Chk1 kinase family (called grp in Drosophila) contains an N-terminal kinase domain, C-terminal SQ cluster, and a TRF “domain” (see Ref. 22Walworth N. Davey S. Beach D. Nature. 1993; 363: 368-371Crossref PubMed Scopus (397) Google Scholar and reviewed in Ref. 23Rhind N. Russell P. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 3889-3896Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). ATM and ATR phosphorylation of certain residues within the TQ or SQ sequences modulates mammalian Chk2 and Chk1 kinase activity, respectively (23Rhind N. Russell P. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 3889-3896Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Analyses utilizing the yeast systems have been critical in understanding the roles of Chk1 and Chk2 in DNA damage responses. InS. pombe, Chk1 is the effector of the G2M DNA damage checkpoint pathway and is downstream of the Rad3 kinase (24Walworth N.C. Bernards R. Science. 1996; 271: 353-356Crossref PubMed Scopus (348) Google Scholar), whereas in S. cerevisiae, Chk1 is downstream of Mec1 (25Sanchez Y. Bachant J. Hu H. Wang F. Liu D. Tetzlaff M. Elledge S.J. Science. 1999; 286: 1166-1171Crossref PubMed Scopus (454) Google Scholar). One of the best defined and well characterized targets of Chk1 is Cdc25C, the dual specificity tyrosine/threonine phosphatase that dephosphorylates the mitotic inducer Cdc2 on Thr14 and Tyr15, resulting in Cdc2 Ser/Thr kinase activity that drives mitosis (23Rhind N. Russell P. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 3889-3896Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Chk1 phosphorylation of Cdc25C promotes the binding of a 14-3-3 protein, which sequesters Cdc25C in the cytoplasm (26Zeng Y. Wu K.C. Forbes Z. Moreno S. Piwnica-Worms H. Enoch T.

Cell. 1999; 10: 833-845Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). Cds1 is the effector of the replication checkpoint pathway and is required for cells to survive treatments that block replication, such as hydroxyurea (31Boddy M.N. Lopez-Girona A. Shanahan P. Interthal H. Heyer W.D. Russell P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 8758-8766Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar, 32Lindsay H.D. Griffiths D.J. Edwards R.J. Christensen P.U. Murray J.M. Osman F. Walworth N. Carr A.M. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 382-395Crossref PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar). Cds1 appears to arrest cells in G2 by phosphorylating Cdc25C on amino acid residues also targeted by Chk1 (29Furnari B. Rhind N. Russell P. Science. 1997; 277: 1495-1497Crossref PubMed Scopus (474) Google Scholar, 30Furnari B. Blasina A. Boddy M.N. McGowan C.H. Russell P. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 833-845Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). In the absence of Cds1, Chk1 can sometimes act to impose a checkpoint delay (26Zeng Y. Wu K.C. Forbes Z. Moreno S. Piwnica-Worms H. Enoch T. Nature. 1998; 395: 507-510Crossref PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar, 31Boddy M.N. Lopez-Girona A. Shanahan P. Interthal H. Heyer W.D. Russell P. Mol. Cell.

Biol. 1999; 19: 4262-4269Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar) indicating the existence of a partial functional overlap between the two kinases. In addition to inactivating Cdc25C, Cds1 is essential for transcriptional up-regulation of Mik1, a tyrosine kinase that phosphorylates and inhibits Cdc2 in replication checkpoint-arrested cells (31Boddy M.N. Lopez-Girona A. Shanahan P. Interthal H. Heyer W.D. Russell P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 8758-8766Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar, 34Christensen P.U. Bentley N.J. Martinho R.G.

The Chk1 and Chk2 Ser/Thr kinases also play important roles in cell cycle checkpoint signaling pathways in higher organisms (20Matsuoka S. Huang M. Elledge S.J. Science. 1998; 282: 1893-1897Crossref PubMed Scopus (1082) Google Scholar, 35Liu Q. Guntuku S. Cui X.S. Matsuoka S. Cortez D. Tamai K. Luo G. Carattini-Rivera S. DeMayo F. Bradley A. Donehower L.A.

InXenopus and Drosophila, Chk1 functions not only in a checkpoint triggered by UV-damaged DNA but also in an S phase checkpoint triggered by a replication blockade (36Guo Z. Dunphy W.G. Mol. Biol.

Cds1/Rad53/Chk2 homologues, termed CeCds1, CeCds2, and Dmnk/Chk2, respectively, have been identified in Caenorhabditis elegansand Drosophila (20Matsuoka S. Huang M. Elledge S.J.

In C. elegans, CeCds1 and CeCds2 are required for meiotic recombination; loss of Dmnk/Chk2 in Drosophila results in ionizing radiation sensitivity, resistance to ionizing radiation-induced apoptosis, and genetic instability (41Xu J. Xin S. Du W. FEBS Lett. 2001; 508: 394-398Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Mammalian Chk2 is activated by ATM phosphorylation of Thr68in response to DNA double strand breaks (42Ahn J.Y.

Chung J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 30537-30541Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). Vertebrate Chk1 is activated by ATR-mediated phosphorylation of several Ser residues in a C-terminal SQ cluster including Ser317 and Ser345 (35Liu Q. Guntuku S. Cui X.S. Matsuoka S. Cortez D.

Targeted mutation Chk2 and Chk1 in mice have demonstrated profound differences in cellular requirements for the two effector kinases. Both Chk1−/− and Chk2−/− ES cells exhibit defective G2/M DNA damage checkpoint function (35Liu Q. Guntuku S. Cui X.S. Matsuoka S. Cortez D. Tamai K. Luo G. Carattini-Rivera S. DeMayo F. Bradley A.

Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 1439-1447PubMed Google Scholar). However, Chk1 is an essential gene as targeted mutation of Chk1 results in an early embryonic lethal phenotype (35Liu Q. Guntuku S. Cui X.S. Matsuoka S. Cortez D. Tamai K. Luo G. Carattini-Rivera S. DeMayo F. Bradley A. Donehower L.A. Elledge S.J. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 1448-1459Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar, 48Takai H.

Chk2 loss of function has not been characterized with regard to the effects of germ line loss, rather only in the context of certain effects on ES cells and partial effects on T cell development in a Rag1−/− blastocyst complementation analysis. In this context, Chk2 functional loss is not ES cell or T cell lethal (47Hirao A. Kong Y.Y. Matsuoka S. Wakeham A. Ruland J. Yoshida H. Liu D. Elledge S.J. Mak T.W. Science. 2000; 287: 1824-1827Crossref PubMed Scopus (1044) Google Scholar). Chk2−/− T cells fail to stabilize p53 after ionizing radiation and appear resistant to radiation-induced apoptosis (47Hirao A. Kong Y.Y. Matsuoka S. Wakeham A. Ruland J. Yoshida H. Liu D. Elledge S.J. Mak T.W. Science. 2000; 287: 1824-1827Crossref PubMed Scopus (1044) Google Scholar). Loss of Chk1 function is ES cell lethal, and during development, Chk1 null cells appear to die of spontaneous apoptosis. Chk2 phosphorylates Ser988 of Brca-1 (49Lee J.S. Collins K.M. Brown A.L. Lee C.H. Chung J.H. Nature. 2000; 404: 201-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (461) Google Scholar) and Ser20 of p53 (50Chehab N.H. Malikzay A. Appel M. Halazonetis T.D. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 278-288Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 51Shieh S.Y. Ahn J. Tamai K. Taya Y. Prives C. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 289-300Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) in response to double strand DNA breaks. Chk1 also phosphorylates Ser20 of p53 in vitro (47Hirao A. Kong Y.Y. Matsuoka S. Wakeham A. Ruland J. Yoshida H. Liu D. Elledge S.J. Mak T.W. Science. 2000; 287: 1824-1827Crossref PubMed Scopus (1044) Google Scholar, 50Chehab N.H. Malikzay A. Appel M. Halazonetis T.D.

Phosphorylation of Brca-1 by Chk2 in response to DNA damage is required for survival after DNA damage. Phosphorylation of p53 Ser20 blocks the ability of Mdm2 to complex with p53 and shunt the latter into a degradation pathway, allowing the G1 checkpoint to be activated by p53 (52Caspari T. Curr. Biol. 2000; 10: R315-R317Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar).In vitro, Chk1 and Chk2 both phosphorylate Ser216 of Cdc25C. Chk2 also phosphorylates Ser123 in Cdc25A after double-stranded DNA breaks in an ATM-dependent manner resulting in a replication stage S phase cell cycle checkpoint (53Falck J. Mailand N. Syljuasen R.G. Bartek J. Lukas J. Nature. 2001; 410: 842-847Crossref PubMed Scopus (868) Google Scholar). Chk1 has been shown to phosphorylate Cdc25A, Cdc25B, and Cdc25C in vitro (54Sanchez Y. Wong C. Thoma R.S. Wu R. Richman Z. Piwnica-Worms H. Elledge S.J. Science. 1997; 277: 1497-1501Crossref PubMed Scopus (1121) Google Scholar). Whereas the substrate motifs in Cdc25C and Cdc25A are similar, the motifs of other endogenous substrates targeted by Chk2 and Chk1 appear unrelated (see Table I). Thus, the two Ser/Thr kinases are considered “versatile” protein kinases with a potentially wide range of acceptable substrate targets (51Shieh S.Y. Ahn J. Tamai K. Taya Y. Prives C. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 289-300Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We have utilized an oriented, degenerate peptide library approach to determine clear, unambiguous substrate specificities for human Chk2 and Chk1. Library-derived optimal peptides were compared with peptides representing the endogenous substrates in terms of Chk2 and Chk1 phosphorylation activities and utilized as probes to show both strong similarities as well as striking differences between the two Ser/Thr kinases. The substrate motifs established from peptide library analyses were also used in a genome-wide search program in an attempt to identify additional potential targets that might serve as novel substrates for Chk2 or Chk1.Table IEndogenous substrate targets of Chk2 and Chk1 lack a common motifCdc25CRSGLYRSPS216MPENLCdc25ACSPLKRSHS123DSLDHBrca-1 IPPLFPIKS988FVKTKp53 PPLSQETFS20DLWKLThe Cdc25C and Cdc25A isotypes contain motifs that are similar to each other but are dissimilar to Brca-1 and p53. Open table in a new tab The Cdc25C and Cdc25A isotypes contain motifs that are similar to each other but are dissimilar to Brca-1 and p53. Full-length Chk1 was subcloned into baculovirus expression vector pFASTBAC with glutathione S-transferase (GST) fused to N terminus of Chk1 via a linker containing a thrombin cleavage site. Spodoptera frugiperda (Sf9) cells expressing GST-Chk1 were scaled up, harvested, and then frozen until purification. To purify Chk1, a frozen cell pellet was resuspended on ice in lysis buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 250 mm NaCl, 1 mm DTT, 0.1% Brij, a protease inhibitor mixture (2 μg/ml E64, 1 mm 4-(2-aminoethyl)benzenesulfonyl fluoride, and 1 μg/ml pepstatin A), and 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, homogenized with a Tekmar tissuemizer, and disrupted through Microfluid fluidizer (M110-Y). The extracts were centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 30 min. The supernatant was added to glutathione-Sepharose 4B (Amersham Biosciences AB) beads equilibrated in wash buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.0, 10 mmMgCl2, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm DTT, protease mixture) and rocked at 4 °C for 30 min. The suspension was transferred into a column and allowed to pack; the wash buffer was then applied extensively. The GST-Chk1 was eluted from the column with 10 mm glutathione in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, collected, and dialyzed into 25 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 50 mm KCl, and 5 mm DTT. GST-Chk1 sample was further purified by Superdex 200 (equilibrated with the dialysis buffer), at 4 °C, and more than 90% purity was estimated based on SDS-PAGE and silver staining analysis (Silver Stain Plus; Bio-Rad). Recombinant human Chk2 was produced in baculovirus using a MaxBac2.0 transfection kit (Invitrogen) as described previously (18Brown A.L. Lee C.H. Schwarz J.K. Mitiku N. Piwnica-Worms H. Chung J.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 3745-3750Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar). ST-Chk2 protein from the lysate was then purified using a StrepTactin-Sepharose column (Genosys Biotechnologies, Inc.). Briefly, the lysate (∼15 ml) was applied to the column (1 ml) in buffer containing 100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1 mm EDTA. After washing the column five times with the same buffer, Strep-tagged Cds1 was eluted with a buffer containing 2.5 mm desthiobiotin, 100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1 mm EDTA. Purity of the eluate was assessed by silver staining using Silver Stain Plus (Bio-Rad). Peptide libraries utilized in this analysis to derive consensus substrate motifs for Cds1 and Chk1 were designated as follows: RXXS, MAXXXXRXXSXXXXAKKK; SI, MAXXXXXSIAKKK; SF, MAXXXXXSFXXXXAKKK; SQ, MAXXXXXXSQXXXXAKKK; SP, MAXXXXSPXXXXAKKK; 4S4+ or 4S4−, MAXXXXSAKKK; 4T4+ or 4T4−, MAXXXXTXXXXAKKK; 4Y4+ or 4Y4−, MAXXXXYXXXXAKKK. Degenerate positions in the sequences are represented by X in which all amino acids were represented with the exception of Cys; + or − indicates the presence or absence of Tyr, Ser, and Thr at the degenerate positions. To assay peptide libraries with maximum degeneracy at non-fixed positions, and thus provide the truest preference values, we analyzed libraries that included Ser, Thr, and Tyr and compared the results to those with only the fixed target residue for phosphorylation by Chk1 and Chk2. We saw no striking differences between the two sets of libraries with fixed central Ser or Thr (see for example, Fig. 1B, and data not shown). Inclusion of Ser and Thr in the fixed Tyr library enhanced the phosphorylation of the 4Y4 library by Chk1 and Chk2 (data not shown) indicating preferences for aromatic hydrophobic residues N- or C-terminal to phosphorylated Ser or Thr. The reaction buffer for Chk2 consisted of a final concentration of 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 75 mm KCl, 10 mm MgCl2 0.5 mm EDTA, 1.25 mm DTT, 100 μm cold ATP, 10 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP, 100 ng of recombinant human Chk2 in a 30-μl total reaction volume at 30 °C. Small scale peptide library analyses were conducted utilizing 100 μg of each library. To assay Chk1 phosphorylation activity, the reaction buffer utilized consisted of 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 50 mm KCl,10 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm EGTA, 100 μm cold ATP, 10 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP, 50–100 ng of Chk1 in a total volume of 30 μl at 30 °C. To monitor peptide phosphorylation by Chk2 or Chk1, 2 μl of the reaction mix was transferred to an Eppendorf tube containing an equal volume of 30% acetic acid to halt the reaction, and 2.5–3.0 μl were spotted onto to P-81 phosphocellulose paper squares and allowed to air dry. These samples were washed three times in 1% o-phosphoric acid (5 min per wash), placed in scintillation vials, and counted. Peptide phosphorylation experiments including kinetic assays and relative velocities of Chk2 and Chk1 were reproduced multiple times at several concentrations. Large scale analyses to determine preferred substrate motifs for Chk2 and Chk1 were performed using the RXXS, SF, SI, and SQ peptide libraries. Large scale peptide library assays were scaled up 10-fold and repeated at least twice for each library using the methods described previously (55Songyang Z. Blechner S. Hoagland N. Hoekstra M.F.

Approximately 1% of each library was phosphorylated in the appropriate reaction conditions in the presence of 300 μmATP and 0.33 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP; the kinase reaction was terminated by the addition of acetic acid, and the reaction was desalted and partially purified using a 1 ml of DEAE-Sephacel (Sigma) column. Radiolabeled fractions were pooled, lyophilized, reconstituted in distilled H2O, and applied to a ferric chelation nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose column as described previously (56O'Neill T. Dwyer A.J. Ziv Y. Chan D.W. Lees-Miller S.P. Abraham R.H. Lai J.H. Hill D. Shiloh Y. Cantley L.C. Rathbun G.A. J. Biol.

Eluted phosphopeptides were pooled, lyophilized, reconstituted in distilled H2O, and sequenced. To determine amino acid preferences at each position in the sequenced peptides, each cycle was first internally normalized for all amino acids present at that cycle using a program designed to analyze relative amino acid abundance at each cycle (56O'Neill T. Dwyer A.J. Ziv Y. Chan D.W. Lees-Miller S.P. Abraham R.H. Lai J.H. Hill D. Shiloh Y. Cantley L.C. Rathbun G.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 22719-22727Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). To establish whether Chk1 and Chk2 exhibit preferences for distinct substrate motifs, we assayed phosphorylation of several different fixed, degenerate peptide libraries by the two Ser/Thr kinases. We included the most degenerate libraries fixed at only a central Ser, Thr, or Tyr (i.e.4S4, 4T4 and 4Y4, respectively) as part of an unbiased survey of Chk1 and Chk2 target phosphorylation preferences. Fig.1A shows that Chk2 prefers the RXXS peptide library that contains a fixed Arg at the −3-position (N-terminal) relative to the fixed Ser targeted by Chk2 kinase activity (Fig. 1A). Ser appears more highly selected than Thr as a target for phosphorylation by Chk2 in the context of the peptide libraries. A second tier of strongly selected libraries is that with hydrophobic residues (Phe and Ile) fixed at the +1-position (C-terminal) relative to Ser, as well as a degenerate library with a central SQ sequence (Fig. 1A). A library with Pro at +1 relative to Ser was not significantly phosphorylated by Chk2 (Fig.1A). Consistent with Chk2, Chk1 also selected the RXXS library but diverged from Chk2 in that the SI peptide library appeared equivalently phosphorylated compared with the RXXS library (Fig. 1B). The SF peptide library is also highly preferred; therefore, similar to Chk2, Chk1 also selects a hydrophobic residue at the +1-position. The SQ library (Fig. 1B) is modestly selected by Chk1; similar to Chk2, the SP library is less preferred and Chk1 also appeared to prefer Ser over Thr as the residue targeted for phosphorylation. Our results indicate that the −3- and +1-positions relative to a Ser targeted for phosphorylation appear to constitute a minimum selected motif for both Chk1 and Chk2. Fig. 2, A and B,shows that the kinase-inactive (KI) versions of Chk2 and Chk1 failed to phosphorylate the RXXS peptide library, indicating that phosphorylation was carried out by the catalytic site of Chk1 and Chk2 and not that of an associated enzyme. Chk2 KI continued to express an apparent low level autophosphorylation activity (data not shown). There was no detectable Ser/Thr autophosphorylation of Chk1 KI. The results shown in Fig. 1, A and B, indicated that we could utilize data from several unrelated peptide libraries in large scale analyses to develop optimal substrate motifs for Chk2 and Chk1. We assayed the most highly selected RXXS library to determine whether there was a strong selection for residues at positions in addition to the fixed Arg at position −3 as well as to confirm the predilection for hydrophobic residues at the C-terminal +1-position adjacent to Ser. To verify the strong preference of Chk1 and Chk2 for Arg or a basic residue at position −3, we employed peptide libraries fixed at the +1-position but degenerate at −3. For these latter analyses we assayed the SI, SF, and SQ libraries.

The effect of oxygen tension on staphylococcal pathogenicity island 3 gene expression was also examined. By comparison with the known staphylococcal pathogenicity islands in the context of gene expression described here, we propose a model of pathogenicity island origin and evolution involving specialized transduction events and addition, deletion, or recombination of pathogenicity island “modules.” We describe the complete sequence of the 15.9-kb staphylococcal pathogenicity island 3 encoding staphylococcal enterotoxin serotypes B, K, and Q.

These infections range from fairly benign cutaneous infections, such as furuncles, to potentially fatal diseases, including endocarditis and toxic shock syndrome (TSS)1(reviewed in Ref. 1.Tenover F.C. Gaynes R.P. Fischetti V.A. Novick R.P. Ferretti J.J. Portnoy D.A. Rood J.I. Gram-positive Pathogens. ASM Press, Washington, D. C.2000: 414-421Google Scholar). Its ability to cause this range of disease is due in part to its elaboration of a vast array of both cell surface-associated and secreted virulence factors. Among the secreted factors are the pyrogenic toxin superantigens that have the ability to activate large populations (10–50%) of T lymphocytes in a manner specific to the variable region of the β-chain of the T-cell receptor (2.Marrack P. Kappler J. Science. 1990; 248: 705-711Crossref PubMed Scopus (1210) Google Scholar). The ensuing massive cytokine release results in the symptoms of TSS, including fever, hypotension, rash, vomiting, diarrhea, multiple organ failure, disseminated intravascular coagulation, and desquamation. The staphylococcal enterotoxins (SEs), members of the superantigen family, are associated with both TSS and food poisoning and have proven emetic activities that appear to be separable from their superantigenic activity (3.Hovde C.J. Marr J.C. Hoffmann M.L. Hackett S.P. Chi Y.I. Crum K.K. Stevens D.L. Stauffacher C.V. Bohach G.A. Mol. Microbiol. 1994; 13: 897-909Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Most, if not all, staphylococcal superantigens are encoded by accessory genetic elements that are either mobile or appear to have been mobile at one time (reviewed in Ref. 4.McCormick J.K. Yarwood J.M. Schlievert P.M. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 2001; 55: 77-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (563) Google Scholar). These identified elements include plasmids, transposons, prophages, and the pathogenicity islands. The staphylococcal pathogenicity islands (SaPIs), of which five have, until recently, been described (SaPI1–4 and SaPIbov), are the first clearly defined pathogenicity islands in Gram-positive bacteria, and each encodes one or more of the staphylococcal superantigens (reviewed in Ref. 5.Novick R.P. Schlievert P. Ruzin A. Microbes Infect. 2001; 3: 585-594Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). SEB, SEC, SEK, SEL, SEQ, and toxic shock syndrome toxin 1 (TSST-1) are known to be encoded by one or more of these phage-related elements (reviewed in Ref. 4.McCormick J.K. Yarwood J.M. Schlievert P.M. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 2001; 55: 77-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (563) Google Scholar). More recently, Kuroda et al.(6.Kuroda M. Ohta T. Uchiyama I. Baba T. Yuzawa H. Kobayashi I. Cui L.

These genomic loci meet the generally accepted requirements of the pathogenicity island subgroup of “genomic islands” as defined previously (7.Hacker J. Kaper J.B. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 2000; 54: 641-679Crossref PubMed Scopus (938) Google Scholar, 8.Hentschel U. Hacker J. Microbes Infect. 2001; 3: 545-548Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). They are present in the genomes of many staphylococci but absent from closely related strains, they are relatively large genomic fragments (>15 kb), they differ in GC content from the rest of the chromosome, they are flanked by direct repeats likely generated upon insertion of the elements into the genome, some are associated with tRNA loci, and they possess genes coding for genetic mobility, including conserved integrases. The prototypical staphylococcal pathogenicity island, SaPI1, was identified and characterized by Lindsay et al. (9.Lindsay J.A. Ruzin A. Ross H.F. Kurepina N. Novick R.P. Mol. Microbiol. 1998; 29: 527-543Crossref PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar) as the genetic element encoding TSST-1, the only superantigen to be associated with nearly all cases of menstrual TSS. SaPI1 is 15.2 kb in length, flanked by a 17-nucleotide direct repeat, contains a functional integrase (int) gene, and is located near the tyrB locus in strain RN4282. It also appears to encode a second superantigen, SEK, and part of a third superantigen, SEQ. Mobility of SaPI1 has been demonstrated only in the presence of a helper phage, such as 80α. Ruzin et al. (10.Ruzin A. Lindsay J. Novick R.P. Mol. Microbiol. 2001; 41: 365-377Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar) have demonstrated that SaPI1 appears to parasitize excision, replication, and encapsidation functions of phage 80α in a relationship that is similar to that between coliphages P4 and P2. During the growth of phage 80α, SaPI1 excises from its unique chromosomal insertion site,attc, replicates in the linear form, interferes with phage growth, and is encapsidated into specialized phage heads. Upon transduction to a recipient organism, SaPI1 integrates by the classical Campbell mechanism into the attc site for which the SaPI1-coded integrase is necessary. Because islands with different att sites appear to have dissimilar integrases (6.Kuroda M. Ohta T. Uchiyama I. Baba T. Yuzawa H. Kobayashi I. Cui L. Oguchi A. Aoki K. Nagai Y. Lian J. Ito T. Kanamori M. Matsumaru H. Maruyama A. Murakami H. Hosoyama A. Mizutani-Ui Y. Takahashi N.K. Sawano T. Inoue R. Kaito C. Sekimizu K. Hirakawa H. Kuhara S. Goto S. Yabuzaki J. Kanehisa M. Yamashita A.

Lancet. 2001; 357: 1225-1240Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1564) Google Scholar), it may well be that the integrase carried by the island determines the integration site in the genome. Existence of these toxin genes on mobile genetic elements implies their transfer between staphylococcal strains as well as other bacterial species by horizontal transfer. Furthermore, these elements are not uniformly distributed among clinical isolates. Thus, these mobile elements likely have played and continue to play an integral role in the evolution of S. aureus as a species and as a pathogen. Indeed, recent evidence supports the hypothesis that virulence traits are spread by horizontal transfer, particularly in nosocomial infections, and that the presence of accessory genetic elements within a strain may affect the acquisition and loss of other mobile genetic elements (11.Moore P.C. Lindsay J.A. J. Clin. Microbiol. 2001; 39: 2760-2767Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). These islands may also form the basis for toxin gene exclusion. For instance, in testing thousands of strains, our laboratory has never identified a clinical isolate that produced both TSST-1 and SEB. It has been determined that these toxins are encoded by different pathogenicity islands that appear to exclude each other from their respective integration sites. However, despite the identification of numerous pathogenicity islands and their likely importance in the evolution of Staphylococcus as a pathogen, the origin and functions of pathogenicity islands remain areas with little investigation. All of the SaPIs have multiple open reading frames (ORFs), many of which have no identifiable homologs. To this point, the issues of whether or not these ORFs are expressed and whether their function might be in the regulation of island-associated superantigens or only in the maintenance and transfer of the islands have not been addressed. In this study, we report the complete sequence and map of SaPI3 encoding SEB and the more recently identified enterotoxins, SEK (12.Orwin P.M. Leung D.Y. Donahue H.L. Novick R.P. Schlievert P.M.

We then discuss the implications for the evolution of the staphylococcal pathogenicity islands. COL is a prototypical methicillin-resistant isolate of S. aureus that is currently being sequenced by The Institute for Genomic Research. MN NJ is a methicillin-sensitive isolate of S. aureus from a case of nonmenstrual TSS in which our laboratory has identified two novel superantigens, SEK (12.Orwin P.M. Leung D.Y. Donahue H.L. Novick R.P. Schlievert P.M. Infect. Immun. 2001; 69: 360-366Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar) and SEQ.2S. aureus MN8, also a methicillin-sensitive isolate of S. aureus, was used as a source of genomic template for amplification of virulence gene probes for the DNA microarrays and was isolated before 1980 from a case of menstrual TSS (13.Schlievert P.M. Blomster D.A. J. Infect. Dis. 1983; 147: 236-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). Preliminary sequence data for the S. aureus strain COL was obtained from The Institute for Genomic Research website (www.tigr.org). A primer walking-based approach was used to amplify by PCR and sequence ∼3.4 kb that spanned the unsequenced loci of SaPI3 in the COL genomic sequence data base. Automated sequencing using an ABI model 377 was performed with the assistance of the Advanced Genetic Analysis Center (University of Minnesota, St. Paul, MN). 50-ml cultures of S. aureus MN NJ were grown aerobically with shaking at 37 °C in either Todd-Hewitt (TH) broth (BC PharMingen) or rabbit serum (Invitrogen). Two independent cultures in each medium were grown in parallel, and samples were removed at the exponential, postexponential, and stationary phases of growth (2, 3, and 8 h after inoculation with an initial cell density of A600 nm = 0.1). Expression of SaPI3 ORFs and other virulence-associated genes was quantified using DNA microarrays. For cultures exposed to altered oxygen levels, 1 ml of TH broth was inoculated with S. aureus MN NJ from an overnight culture to an initial cell density of A600 nm = 0.1 in a 35 × 12-mm-diameter polystyrene Petri dish (Nunc, Roskilde, Denmark). All cultures were placed into sealed, humidified Plexiglass cell culture chambers (20 × 26 × 7.5 cm, internal dimensions; Mishell-Dutton) (14.Mishell B.B. Mishell R.I. Mishell B.B. Shiigi S.M. Selected Methods in Cellular Immunology. W. H. Freeman and Company, San Francisco1980: 30-37Google Scholar), flushed with gas mixtures containing either 1% oxygen (v/v) or 21% oxygen (v/v) balanced with nitrogen and 7% carbon dioxide (Praxair, St. Louis, MO), and sealed. Chambers were then incubated at 37 °C with orbital shaking (∼125 rpm). Samples for the exponential, postexponential, and stationary phases of growth were removed at ∼2, 3, and 8 h after inoculation, respectively, and expression of SaPI3 genes was quantified using DNA microarrays. We have previously determined that there is no significant difference in growth parameters (cell densities or timing of entry into the growth phases of interest) between cultures grown in 1% oxygen and 21% oxygen (v/v) balanced with nitrogen and 7% carbon dioxide (15.Yarwood J.M. Schlievert P.M. J. Clin. Microbiol. 2000; 38: 1797-1803Crossref PubMed Google Scholar,16.Yarwood J.M. McCormick J.K. Schlievert P.M. J. Bacteriol. 2001; 183: 1113-1123Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). Two Dutch-belted rabbits were immunized with SEB, which is made in high concentrations (>10 μg/ml) by MN NJ grown in vitro. Rabbits were immunized by three subcutaneous injections at 2-week intervals, with each injection containing 25 μg of purified SEB resuspended in 0.5 ml of phosphate-buffered saline and emulsified in 0.5 ml of incomplete Freund's adjuvant. Development of antibody to SEB was determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay of serum samples taken 1 week after the final immunization. The two rabbits developed anti-SEB (IgG) titers of 1:5,120 and 1:10,240, respectively, as compared with preimmune titers of <1:20. Sterilized perforated hollow polyethylene golf balls were implanted subcutaneously in four Dutch-belted rabbits (17.Scott D.F. Kling J.M. Kirkland J.J. Best G.K. Infect. Immun. 1983; 39: 383-387Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Implantation of the polyethylene balls and subsequent healing created transudate-filled cavities in the rabbits with volumes of ∼15 ml that contained few host cells, thus enabling the preparation of staphylococcal RNA relatively free of contaminating host RNA. 6 weeks after implantation of the polyethylene balls, ∼1010 colony-forming units of S. aureus MN NJ grown in TH medium were collected by centrifugation from the late exponential phase of growth (cell density of cultures was 6.7 × 108 colony-forming units/ml), resuspended in 2 ml of phosphate-buffered saline, and injected into the implanted polyethylene balls. Samples were removed from the inoculum culture before centrifugation for use in expression analysis by DNA microarrays. 2 ml of transudate containing S. aureus were then removed from the infection chambers at the indicated times after inoculation using a sterile syringe, S. aureus was enumerated by plating, and expression of SaPI3 genes was quantified using DNA microarrays. Analysis of staphylococcal gene expression in vitro and in vivo using DNA microarrays was performed as described elsewhere (www.agac.umn.edu/microarray/protocols/protocols.htm). In brief, a library of targets representing 68 genes from S. aureus MN NJ and MN8 was constructed with primers designed to amplify fragments of ∼300 bp of each gene from genomic DNA. Two successive rounds of PCR were performed to minimize genomic DNA contamination in the amplification products, and the final 100-μl reactions were checked for quality on agarose gels and purified with the QIAquick PCR Purification Kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). The purified products were printed in triplicate using a Total Array System robot (BioRobotics, Boston, MA). Cell pellets from centrifuged samples of S. aureus cultures were flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen. Total RNA was prepared using the RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer's directions. DNA was removed from the RNA preparations using the RNase-free DNase Set (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer's directions. cDNA prepared from RNA from S. aureus cultures to be compared was labeled with either Cy3 or Cy5 fluorescent dye (Amersham Biosciences) and competitively hybridized with the printed microarrays. Images of the hybridized arrays were obtained with a Scanarray 5000 microarray scanner (GSI Lumonics, Watertown, MA). One independent hybridization (on triplicate arrays) was conducted for each of two independent experiments. Fluorescence intensities for individual spots were normalized based on the total intensity of fluorescence in the Cy3 and Cy5 channels. Fluorescence intensity was determined as the average intensity of the triplicate spots for each gene. Total fluorescence for each gene was normalized between arrays for independent experiments, the data were combined from both experiments, and statistical significance was determined using Student's t test to compare expression data from the two growth conditions of interest. SaPI3 ORFs were determined as being expressed if the fluorescence intensity was at least twice that of background levels established using negative controls (probes for genes not expressed by strains MN NJ and COL) and if fluorescence was detected in each of the triplicate arrays for each independent experiment. To account for possible bias in labeling of cDNA by either Cy3 or Cy5, dye labeling was reversed in the second independent experiment for each of several experimental conditions. No dye bias was detected. Clustering based on similarity of expression profiles and visualization were performed using the software program Spotfire DecisionSite 6.1 (www.spotfire.com). Similarities between expression profiles of individual genes in all 11 experimental conditions were calculated using the “Euclidean distance” method. Data base searches of the unfinished S. aureus COL genome (www.tigr.org) revealed the presence of large segments homologous to SaPI1. Because COL does not produce TSST-1, we hypothesized that this sequence comprised a novel pathogenicity island, which we termed SaPI3. Using the SaPI1 sequence and SaPI3 partial sequence as guides, primers were designed to complete the sequence of SaPI3 in the COL strain. In all, a PCR and primer walking-based approach was used to sequence ∼3.4 kb of the 15,936-bp SaPI3. SaPI3 was determined to have 24 ORFs potentially encoding proteins over 50 amino acids in length, 3 of which encoded staphylococcal enterotoxin serotypes B, K, and Q, and many of which have homologs in SaPI1 and SaPIbov (Fig. 1; Table I). We were also able to identify the presence of SaPI3 in the clinical isolate S. aureus MN NJ, a known SEB producer, by PCR analysis and sequencing of the same three regions as in strain COL (data not shown). MN NJ is an isolate from a case of nonmenstrual TSS in which our laboratory has described the presence of two novel enterotoxins, SEK (12.Orwin P.M. Leung D.Y. Donahue H.L. Novick R.P. Schlievert P.M. Infect. Immun. 2001; 69: 360-366Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar) and SEQ.2 The repeated 17-nucleotide sequences flanking SaPI3 were identical to the att sites of SaPI1 (5′-TTATTTAGCAGGATAA-3′) and thus might form the basis of pathogenicity island exclusion (i.e. the lack of TSST-1 and SEB in the same clinical isolates). In general, the identified SaPI3 genes form two apparent transcriptional blocks with ORFs 2–18 (including SEB) oriented toward the left of the island, whereas ORFs 19–24 (including SEK and SEQ) are oriented to the right (Fig. 1). The overall GC content of SaPI3 was 31.4%, somewhat lower than the 32.8–32.9% found for the whole genome of S. aureus (6.Kuroda M. Ohta T. Uchiyama I. Baba T. Yuzawa H. Kobayashi I. Cui L. Oguchi A.

Humana Press, Totowa, NJ1998: 531-552Google Scholar).1-b Corresponding ORFs were determined by relative position within the islands and/or similarity of the predicted gene products. Open table in a new tab We have identified genes in SaPI3 according to the following nomenclature: pathogenicity island_ORF number (variant). Thus, the ninth ORF in SaPI3 is identified by the gene name sapi3_9. A mutant of this gene might be designated as sapi3_9(1). Sequential genes are identified using a hyphen (e.g. sapi3_10-15 is used to identify all SaPI3 ORFs from 10 through 15). Upon determination of the gene's function, the name will be altered to reflect that function, such as sapi3_int. (Exotoxins on the islands are identified according to their own nomenclature system.) If additional genes are identified on the island subsequent to its initial sequencing, those genes will be numbered sequential to those already identified, rather than renumbering all of the genes on the island. We have implemented this nomenclature system in our laboratory to promote systematic identification of SaPI genes, preclude confusion regarding identically numbered ORFs on different islands, and allow unambiguous assignation of expression data to SaPI genes. A comparison of SaPI3, SaPI1, and SaPIbov is shown in Fig. 1, and the corresponding ORFs are identified in Table I. The overall length of the three SaPIs is similar, although SaPIbov is larger on the 5′ end by 1915 bp. SaPIbov also has a different att site than SaPI1 and SaPI3. Two core regions of high (>92% identity) homology between all three islands were identified (Fig. 1). The first core region includes nucleotides 2974–6709 of SaPI1, 3113–6929 of SaPI3, and 5100–8745 of SaPIbov. Within this core region, SaPI1 has an additional 100 bp not present in SaPIbov (nucleotides 5909–6009 in SaPI1), whereas SaPI3 contains this 100-bp stretch as well as an additional 67 bp not present in either SaPI1 or SaPIbov (nucleotides 6063–6230). The second core region includes nucleotides 9380–10,284 of SaPI1, 9591–10,494 of SaPI3, and 11,419–12,429 of SaPIbov. All three islands contain int genes adjacent to the attR sites, and SaPI3 contains an enterotoxin gene (seb) in the same position as tstH in SaPI1 and SaPIbov. SaPI1 and SaPI3 appear to be even more closely related. In addition to the shared elements among all three islands and the identical attachment sites in SaPI1 and SaPI3, these two islands are highly homologous (>93% identity) at the right end (nucleotides 10,285–11,046 in SaPI1 and 10,494–11,254 in SaPI3; nucleotides 12,248–15,250 in SaPI1 and 12,891–15,953 in SaPI3) (Fig. 1). The ear(sapi1_1 and sapi3_1) and sek genes are also in the same relative positions to each other and to the att sites of SaPI1 and SaPI3. Although the function of ear is unknown, several properties of the gene suggest that it may have an important function in the life cycle of S. aureus. Its position and predicted product are conserved (∼75% identity at the amino acid level) among SaPI1, SaPI3, and SaPI4 (data not shown), it has the identical signal sequence as TSST-1, and it is secreted in abundant quantities by S. aureus RN4282. In addition to homology between SaPI1, SaPI3, and SaPIbov, the region encoding sapi3_3-9 and sapi3_15 shares extensive homology (>95% at the nucleotide level) to a matching region in SaPIn1/SaPIm1, whereas sapi3_10-14 are 87% or more similar to regions presumably of phage origin in strain Mu50. A locus of ∼900 bp adjacent to the attL site of SaPI3 was 95% identical to a phage 80α sequence adjacent to the putative phage amidase gene. However, this region of SaPI3 apparently does not encode for any protein. A ∼1.6-kb region SaPI3 with significant variance as compared with SaPI1 is found spanning the region between sapi3_17 and seq. Within this region is a stretch of ∼500 nucleotides that is nearly identical to a sequence from the recently identified φSLT, a temperate S. aureus phage encoding the Panton-Valentine leukocidin. Immediately upstream of int in both SaPI1 and SaPI3 is a 46-bp sequence conserved among staphylococcal phages φ11, φ13, φ42, and L54a (18.Carroll D. Kehoe M.A. Cavanagh D. Coleman D.C. Mol. Microbiol. 1995; 16: 877-893Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 19.Ye Z.H. Buranen S.L. Lee C.Y. J. Bacteriol. 1990; 172: 2568-2575Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 20.Ye Z.H. Lee C.Y. J. Bacteriol. 1989; 171: 4146-4153Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This sequence is the binding site for two phage φ11 proteins that regulate int expression, RinA and RinB (21.Ye Z.H. Lee C.Y. J. Bacteriol. 1993; 175: 1095-1102Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In addition to the integrase and the noncoding regions with homology to phage DNA, several of the genes contained on SaPI3 suggest a mobile element of phage origin, perhaps a conglomeration of several phage elements (Table I). The terminase potentially encoded by sapi3_3 is homologous to the small subunit of identified terminases in the bacteriophages ρ15 (22.Chai S. Kruft V. Alonso J.C.

We determined the complete human cDNA sequence for the LN α5 chain and produced recombinant human LN-10 (rLN-10) in HEK293 cells by triple transfection of full-length cDNAs encoding the human LN α5, β1, and γ1 chains. The rLN-10 was purified using affinity chromatography and had an apparent molecular mass of ∼800 kDa in SDS-PAGE and a native domain structure in rotary shadowing electron microscopy. By using function-blocking monoclonal antibodies, integrin α3β1 was found to be a major mediator of adhesion of HT-1080 and human saphenous vein endothelial cells. Human saphenous vein endothelial cells adhered more strongly to rLN-10 than to LN-1 and LN-8 and showed better migration on rLN-10, compared with several other matrices.

To date, five α, three β, and three γ LN chains that may combine into at least 12 different isoforms have been identified (1.Koch M. Olson P.F. Albus A. Jin W. Hunter D.D. Brunken W.J. Burgeson R.E.

These LN isoforms are expressed in tissue-specific and developmentally regulated patterns, and they play significant roles in the adhesion, migration, proliferation, and differentiation of many cell types (3.Ekblom P.

In most tissues, two main isoforms, LN-8 (α4β1γ1) and LN-10 (α5β1γ1), are found in endothelial basement membranes (4.Sorokin L.M. Pausch F. Frieser M. Kroger S. Ohage E. Deutzmann R. Dev.

LN-8 seems to be an important component of the newly formed endothelial basement membranes because mice lacking the α4 chain exhibit neonatal hemorrhages due to unstable microvessels (9.Thyboll J. Kortesmaa J. Cao R. Soininen R. Wang L. Iivanainen A. Sorokin L. Risling M. Cao Y. Tryggvason K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 1194-1202Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar). The LN α5 chain, a component of LN-10 and LN-11 (α5β2γ1), is expressed widely in adult tissues including placenta, heart, lung, blood vessels, skeletal muscle, kidney, and pancreas (4.Sorokin L.M.

Embryos lacking LN α5 exhibit several developmental abnormalities, such as exencephaly and syndactyly as well as dysmorphogenesis of the placental labyrinth, and die late in embryogenesis (15.Miner J.H. Li C. Dev. Biol. 2000; 217: 278-289Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar, 16.Miner J.H. Cunningham J. Sanes J.R. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 1713-1723Crossref PubMed Scopus (382) Google Scholar). LN α5 chain-containing isoforms may therefore be important in placental endothelial cell migration and blood vessel branching and in formation of proper basal laminae. The best-established type of LN receptor is the integrin family, which plays a central role in cell-matrix interaction. Integrin-mediated endothelial cell recognition of LN and other basement membrane molecules may determine cell-to-matrix adhesiveness and mediate cell behaviors such as spreading, retraction, polarization, and migration that are essential for the maintenance and normal functioning of blood vessels (17.Davis G.E. Camarillo C.W. Exp. Cell Res. 1995; 216: 113-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar, 18.Dejana E. Raiteri M. Resnati M. Lampugnani M.G.

Vascular endothelial cells undergo drastic morphological and functional changes during angiogenesis, and it is well established that the behavior of the cell is critically influenced by its interaction with components of the extracellular matrix. Because of this fact, endothelial cell attachment and migration on grafts used in vascular surgery might be improved if the surfaces of these nonbiological materials were precoated with extracellular matrix proteins,e.g. LNs. The ingrowth of endothelial cells on the surfaces of grafts, a process known as endothelialization, has been shown to be of critical importance for preventing thrombus formation on the graft material and for reducing neointimal hyperplasia. Many adhesive substrate coatings to enhance endothelial cell attachment have been tested (20.Dixit P. Hern-Anderson D. Ranieri J. Schmidt C.E. J. Biomed. Mater. Res. 2001; 56: 545-555Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar), but the long-term patency of small-diameter vascular grafts is still disappointing, primarily due to stenosis and thrombus formation (21.Pevec W.C.

In this study, we report the full-length cDNA derived sequence of the human LN α5 chain and the production of recombinant human LN-10. The transfected HEK293 clones produce large amounts of intact LN-10, which is otherwise difficult to obtain. We investigated the adhesive and migration-promoting activities and identified the integrin binding specificity of endothelial cells to LN-10 using the recombinant protein. LN-10 showed not only adhesive but also migration-promoting activities on endothelial cells, providing support for LN-10 as a good candidate for a coating substrate of vascular grafts. The previously published mouse sequence was used to search expressed sequence tag data bases. Based upon sequences of the identified expressed sequence tags, oligonucleotide primers were synthesized and used for PCR amplification of several human α5-specific probes with λgt11 cDNA library (CLONTECH) as template. These probes were used for screening of λgt11 cDNA libraries (CLONTECH) from human lung, fetal lung, and fetal kidney. This resulted in the isolation of several clones, and further screening was performed with PCR-amplified selected regions of these clones. This walk generated clones covering 2134 bp of coding sequence and 195 bp of 3′-untranslated region in the C-terminal part and 5354 bp in the N-terminal part but lacking a translation initiation start site. The center part, comprising bp 5582–9316, was obtained by PCR amplification from a Human Lung Marathon Ready™ cDNA mix (CLONTECH). The remaining 296 bp of coding sequence and a 67-bp 5′-untranslated region end were obtained with SMART™ RACE cDNA amplification kit (CLONTECH) using poly(A) RNA purified with QuickPrep mRNA purification kit (Amersham Biosciences) from HEK293 cell lysate. The reverse transcription was performed with the Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase SuperscriptII (Invitrogen), and subsequent PCR amplification was performed with Advantage®-GC 2 PCR kit (CLONTECH). This 363-bp N-terminal sequence was confirmed by sequencing genomic P1 clone (Genome Systems) obtained by screening with a PCR-generated probe from nucleotides 344–452. This generated a full-length sequence, but most of the sequence was only covered by a single λ clone or PCR fragment. To further confirm the sequence, we used PCR amplification of SMART™ RACE-generated cDNA mixes from HEK293 cells, human placenta total RNA, and Human Lung Marathon Ready™ cDNA mix. This generated new clones, so that all regions of the cDNA were covered by more than one clone from different sources. In the case of suspected polymorphisms, several clones from different sources were compared. Sequencing was performed on an ABI PRISM® 310 Genetic Analyzer (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) using the ABI PRISM® BigDye™ Terminator Cycle Sequencing Kit (PE Applied Biosystems). Sequence analysis was performed with AutoAssembler™ (PE Applied Biosystems), and sequence comparative analysis was performed with the GCG software (24.Genetics Computer GroupProgram Manual for the GCG Package, Version 10.1. Genetics Computer Group, Madison, WI2000Google Scholar). For expression of the human LN α5 chain containing a C-terminal FLAG epitope, the full-length cDNA was constructed as follows. To obtain overlapping cDNA clones, PCR amplification of SMART™ RACE-generated cDNA mixes from HEK293 cells, human placenta total RNA, and Human Lung Marathon Ready™ cDNA mix was performed using the Advantage®-GC 2 PCR kit and Pfu Turbo polymerase (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). All PCR-derived cDNA fragments were cloned into the pCR2.1-TOPO vector (Invitrogen) and sequenced (using AmpliTag FS on an ABI 310 sequencer; PerkinElmer Life Sciences) to ensure that no mutations had occurred during amplification. All primers for PCR and pCR2.1-TOPO plasmids into which the PCR-derived cDNA fragments were cloned are shown in Table I. To ensure efficient and correct translation initiation, the Kozak sequence (accgcc; Ref. 25.Kozak M. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 115: 887-903Crossref PubMed Scopus (1451) Google Scholar) was edited to match the consensus.

Chem. 2000; 275: 14853-14859Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Wild-type cells were transfected using the standard calcium-phosphate method with the HG1 construct, and stable colonies were selected using 100 μg/ml hygromycin (Cayla). All further cell culture and clonal expansion were carried out in the continuous presence of relevant selection antibiotics. A clone highly expressing LN γ1 was then transfected with the human LN β1 construct, and stable clones were selected using 500 μg/ml G418 (Invitrogen). A clone highly expressing both LN γ1 and LN β1 was finally transfected with HLN5Full.pcDNA, and stable colonies were selected using 200 μg/ml zeocin (Cayla). The clones showing the highest secretion were expanded further. For production of rLN-10, confluent cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 1 mm pyruvate and insulin-transferrin-selen supplement (Sigma) for up to 5 days. rLN-10 was affinity-purified using anti-FLAG M2 matrix (Sigma). The collected medium was incubated in batch mode with the matrix overnight at 4 °C with agitation. Bound rLN-10 was competitively eluted with 50 μg/ml FLAG peptide (Sigma) in TBS/E (50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, and 1 mm EDTA) at room temperature. The eluate was concentrated, and the buffer was replaced by phosphate-buffered saline using 30-kDa cut-off ultrafiltration (Millipore). Finally, the concentrated solution was passed through a 0.2-μm filter to remove self-aggregated polymers. rLN-8 was produced in HEK293 cells and purified using anti-FLAG matrix and ion-exchange chromatography. 2J. Kortesmaa, M. Doi, and K. Tryggvason, manuscript in preparation. Secreted LN in medium was characterized after purification using 5% SDS-PAGE and 4–15% gradient SDS-PAGE. Proteins were visualized using silver staining or transferred onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes. The membranes were probed with the mAbs described above. After washing, the membranes were incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse antibody. The immunoreactivity was detected by a chemiluminescence kit (Life Science Products) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Electron microscopy was performed by the rotary shadowing technique as described previously (31.Engel J. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 245: 469-488Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Briefly, protein (25–50 μg/ml) in 0.2m ammonium bicarbonate, pH 7.4, was mixed with an equal volume of glycerol and sprayed onto freshly cleaved mica discs. These were dried in high vacuum, shadowed with platinum/carbon at an angle of 9°, and replicated. Human fibrosarcoma HT-1080 (CCL-121) cells were from ATCC. Immortomouse brain capillary endothelial (IBE) (32.Kanda S. Tomasini-Johansson B. Klint P. Dixelius J. Rubin K. Claesson-Welsh L. Exp. Cell Res. 1999; 248: 203-213Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar) cells were kindly provided by Dr. L. Claesson-Welsh. All cells were cultured in a humidified 5% CO2 atmosphere. HT-1080 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, 10% fetal calf serum, and pyruvate at 37 °C. IBE cells were cultured in F-12, 10% fetal calf serum, and 2 units/ml interferon γ on gelatin-coated plastic at 33 °C. Before assay, the IBE cells were cultured in serum-free F-12 at 37 °C without interferon γ for 24 h. As approved by the ethical committee at the Karolinska Hospital (Stockholm, Sweden), residual segments of the great saphenous vein were collected from patients undergoing coronary bypass surgery. HSVECs were isolated as described previously (33.Haegerstrand A. Gillis C. Bengtsson L. J. Vasc. Surg. 1992; 16: 280-285Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Briefly, veins were rinsed with MEM (Invitrogen) and filled with 0.1% collagenase and 0.16% dispase (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) in MEM for 20 min at 37 °C in an 8% CO2-humidified atmosphere. Cells were cultured in MEM containing 40% heat-inactivated pooled human serum, 1 nmol/liter choleratoxin (Sigma), 33 μmol/liter isobutylmethylxantine (Sigma), and antibiotics. HSVECs were seeded on gelatin-coated plates and passaged (1:3). HSVECs were characterized with monoclonal anti-human von Willebrand factor-related antigen (Dako), and HSVECs between passages 4 and 7 were used in the experiments. Adhesion assay was performed as described previously (27.Kortesmaa J. Yurchenco P. Tryggvason K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 14853-14859Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Briefly, 96-well plates (Maxi-Sorp; Nunc) were coated with proteins overnight at 4 °C. The remaining protein binding capacity was saturated by the addition of 2% heat-inactivated BSA in phosphate-buffered saline. For the assay, cells were suspended in buffered serum-free medium at 3 × 104 cells/well. Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, 25 mm Hepes, and pyruvate were used for HT-1080 cells, and F-12, 25 mm Hepes, and 0.25% BSA were used for other cells. Antibodies or other test compounds were added to the cell suspension, and the cells were allowed to recover at 37 °C for 30 min. Integrin mAbs were used at 10 μg/ml, RGD peptides were used at 0.25 mg/ml, heparin was used at 5 mg/ml, and EDTA was used at 5 mm. The cells were then allowed to adhere for 60 min at 37 °C. Bound cells were quantitated by crystal violet staining. None of the cell lines bound appreciably to BSA. When the quantitative results were calculated, binding to BSA was given a value of 0, whereas the relevant control was given a value of 100. The mean and S.D. were calculated from results obtained from parallel wells. Each assay was performed in three separate wells three times. Briefly, suspended HSVECs were incubated in phosphate-buffered saline containing anti-integrin mAbs against α1–6, αv, β1, β3, and β4 for 30 min at 4 °C. After washing, cells were incubated with fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated F(ab′)2 fragments of rabbit anti-mouse immunoglobulin for 30 min at 4 °C. Cells were then analyzed in a FACScan flow cytometer (BC PharMingen). Mouse IgG was used as a negative control. The cell migration assay was performed as described previously (34.Jansson K. Bengtsson L. Haegerstrand A. Eur. J. Vasc. Endovasc. Surg. 1998; 16: 334-341Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar). Flat-bottomed 24-well culture plates (Corning) were coated with proteins overnight at 4 °C. The remaining protein binding capacity was saturated by the addition of 2% heat-inactivated BSA in phosphate-buffered saline. Thereafter, a 4 × 10-mm stainless steel weight was put on the center of well before seeding HSVECs at 2 × 105 cells/well. After adhesion for 2 days in MEM with 30% human serum, the steel weight was removed. A gap devoid of HSVECs was thus created, with two broad (10-mm) endothelial cell edges facing each other at a distance of 4 mm. During endothelialization, HSVECs were incubated in MEM with 40% human serum, choleratoxin, and isobutylmethylxantine for 2 days after removing the steel weight. The cells were visualized by 0.1% crystal violet staining. The full-length cDNA coding sequence consisting of 11,088 bp had an open reading frame encoding 3696 amino acids (GenBank™ accession number AF443072). Compared with the previously reported mouse sequence (GenBank™ accession number U37501 (10.Miner J.H. Lewis R.M. Sanes J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 28523-28526Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar)), we obtained an additional 79 amino acids in the N-terminal end, also identified later in mouse (GenBank™ accession number AJ293593). Comparison with the mouse laminin α5 showed an overall amino acid identity of 79%. The two RGD sequences were conserved in the human chain. The human sequence contained two extra cysteines (amino acid residues 3173 and 3663) and a link region between the LG3 and LG4 domains that is 7 residues longer than the mouse sequence. In addition, there was a stretch of 4 extra amino acids in domain IV (amino acid residues 1680–1683) in the human sequence. The mouse sequence also had an additional stretch of 25 amino acids in the C terminus, compared with the human sequence. Alignment of mouse and human LN LG5 modules with other published sequences (data not shown) revealed similar C-terminal length in all cases except for mouse α5. A partial sequence covering 953 amino acids in the C terminus of human LN α5 has been reported previously (12.Durkin M.E. Loechel F. Mattei M.G. Gilpin B.J. Albrechtsen R. Wewer U.M. FEBS Lett. 1997; 411: 296-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar), and this contains no discrepancies compared with our sequence. We generated cDNAs from four different sources (placenta, HEK293 cells, and Lung Marathon Ready™ cDNA from two sources), and when the same difference resulting in amino acid substitution was detected in two of them, we assumed these to be polymorphisms. Four polymorphisms were located in domain IIIa (5698:A-G (1900: Met-Val), 5722: G-A (1908: Ala-Thr), 6158: G-A (2053: Arg-Thr), 6184: A-G (2062: Asn-Asp)), and one was located in the G domain (9235:T-C (3079: Trp-Arg)). The first nucleotide of the predicted translation initiation site (ATG) was designated as nucleotide 1. The amino acids chosen for the rLN-10 construct at these possible polymorphic sites were the first of the two in each case. Four of the polymorphisms were located in domain IIIa that has laminin epidermal growth factor-like repeats (LE modules). The two LE modules (amino acid residues 1864–1912 and 2023–2069) containing these polymorphisms have about 40% homology to LE modules of LN γ1 (III4 and III5). Based on the crystal structures that were reported previously for these γ1 LE modules (35.Baumgartner R. Czisch M. Mayer U. Poschl E. Huber R. Timpl R. Holak T.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 257: 658-668Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 36.Stetefeld J. Mayer U. Timpl R. Huber R. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 257: 644-657Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar), we modulated the tertiary structure of the LN α5 modules (data not shown), and we found that the observed polymorphisms did not seem to affect the structure of the LE modules. Conditioned medium from wild-type HEK293 cells did not react in Western blotting with the anti-LN α5, anti-LN β1, anti-LN γ1, or anti-FLAG antibodies, indicating that these cells express endogenous LNs at very low levels, if at all (data not shown). After triple transfection, the best cell clone produced 1–2 mg rLN-10/liter medium. Immunoaffinity purification with anti-FLAG M2 matrix followed by competitive elution with FLAG peptide resulted in highly purified protein, as seen in silver-stained SDS-PAGE gels (Fig. 1a). Under reducing conditions, two bands were seen, a 400-kDa band corresponding to the laminin α5 chain and a 200-kDa band corresponding to the laminin β1 and γ1 chains, which have similar molecular masses (Fig. 1a). In Western blotting of the conditioned medium, two bands of ∼350 and 400 kDa could be seen with the laminin α5 mAb (Fig. 1b). The anti-FLAG antibody reacted with a 400-kDa and a 40-kDa fragment (Fig. 1b; data not shown). Taken together, these data indicate that the 400-kDa fragment is the intact laminin α5, the 350-kDa fragment is an N-terminal fragment, and the 40-kDa fragment is a C-terminal fragment harboring the FLAG epitope. Under nonreducing conditions, most of the protein appeared at the top of the gel as a very high molecular mass band, which was immunoreactive with α5, FLAG, β1, and γ1 mAbs, showing that the rLN-10 was produced as disulfide-cross-linked heterotrimer (Fig. 1c). A minor band of ∼400 kDa was also seen in silver staining and in Western blotting with α5, FLAG, β1, and γ1 mAbs. A band of similar size, likewise reactive with β1 and γ1 antibodies, was also seen with rLN-8 (27.Kortesmaa J. Yurchenco P. Tryggvason K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 14853-14859Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar), and thus we assumed that some of the rLN-10 molecules in the preparation consisted of a covalently cross-linked β1/γ1 dimer, which was noncovalently associated with the α5 chain. In the case of rLN-8, the α4 chain is seen as a 200-kDa band, but in the case of rLN-10, the noncovalently associated α5 chain had an apparent molecular mass similar to that of the β1/γ1 dimer, which explains the immunoreactivity of the minor band with α5 and FLAG mAbs.

This predicts that full-length selenoprotein P will contain 10 selenocysteine residues. Full-length selenoprotein P and three smaller isoforms that have identical N termini have been demonstrated. Selenoprotein P was purified from rat plasma, and the four isoforms were separated by heparin chromatography and SDS-PAGE. Mass spectrometric peptide analysis of the full-length isoform verified 357 of its 366 predicted amino acid residues, including its C terminus and all 10 selenocysteines. The C termini of the smaller isoforms were characterized by mass spectrometry. The shortened isoforms terminated where the second, third, and seventh selenocysteine residues were predicted to be. This suggests that all isoforms arise from the same mRNA and that the UGAs that specify the second, third, and seventh selenocysteines in full-length selenoprotein P can alternatively serve to terminate translation, producing the shorter isoforms.

This suggests that all isoforms arise from the same mRNA and that the UGAs that specify the second, third, and seventh selenocysteines in full-length selenoprotein P can alternatively serve to terminate translation, producing the shorter isoforms. More than 15 animal selenoproteins have been characterized, and all of them contain selenocysteine. Selenocysteine incorporation is specified by a UGA in the open reading frame of the mRNA that is accompanied by a “selenocysteine insertion sequence” element in the 3′-untranslated region (1.Berry M.J. Banu L. Chen Y. Mandel S.J. Kieffer J.D. Harney J.W. Larsen P.R. Nature. 1991; 353: 273-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (515) Google Scholar). This is an alternative function of the UGA codon, which usually terminates translation. Selenoprotein P is an unusual extracellular glycoprotein that has been suggested to serve in oxidant defense (2.Burk R.F. Hill K.E. Awad J.A. Morrow J.D. Kato T. Cockell K.A. Lyons P.R. Hepatology. 1995; 21: 561-569PubMed Google Scholar) and in selenium transport (3.Motsenbocker M.A. Tappel A.L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1982; 719: 147-153Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar,4.Burk R.F. Hill K.E. Read R. Bellew T. Am. J. Physiol. 1991; 261: E26-E30Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It was originally purified from rat plasma, where it is relatively abundant (30 μg of peptide/ml plasma) (5.Read R. Bellew T. Yang J.-G. Hill K.E. Palmer I.S. Burk R.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 17899-17905Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The purified protein contained 7.5 ± 1 atoms of selenium per molecule in the form of selenocysteine (5.Read R. Bellew T. Yang J.-G. Hill K.E. Palmer I.S. Burk R.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 17899-17905Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The mRNA of selenoprotein P (deduced from its cDNA) contains 10 UGAs in its open reading frame, implying 10 selenocysteines in the primary structure of the protein (6.Hill K.E. Lloyd R.S. Yang J.-G. Read R. Burk R.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 10050-10053Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, not all the predicted selenium was detected by analysis of the purified protein. This variance might be due to the presence of isoforms of the protein that contain different numbers of selenocysteine residues or to the absence of selenium from some of the predicted selenocysteine sites. Isoforms of selenoprotein P are present in rat plasma, having been demonstrated by their differential binding to heparin-Sepharose (7.Chittum H.S. Himeno S. Hill K.E. Burk R.F. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1996; 325: 124-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Two isoforms have been purified and characterized by amino acid analysis, conventional peptide sequencing, and C-terminal sequencing (8.Himeno S. Chittum H.S. Burk R.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 15769-15775Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Both of these isoforms have the same N-terminal amino acid sequence. One of them was shown to be the full-length protein, terminating at a “hard stop” UAA in the mRNA, and the other was shown to terminate at the predicted position of the second selenocysteine, i.e. the second UGA in the open reading frame of the mRNA (8.Himeno S. Chittum H.S. Burk R.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 15769-15775Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Two other isoforms were identified in that study, but they could not be purified in quantities sufficient for conventional amino acid sequencing. Aside from the demonstration that both of them had the same N-terminal amino acid sequence as the two isoforms that had been purified, these two isoforms have not been characterized. The present study uses mass spectrometry to identify the C-terminal peptides of the two previously uncharacterized isoforms, revealing that they terminate at positions in the sequence where selenocysteine residues are predicted (UGAs). Mass spectrometry was also used to verify the amino acid sequence of the full-length isoform and to confirm that all 10 selenocysteines are present. Iodoacetamide and dithiothreitol were obtained from Sigma. Sequence-grade trifluoroacetic acid was purchased from Burdick and Jackson (Muskegon, MI). The modified N-tosyl-l-phenylalanylchloromethyl ketone-treated porcine trypsin was obtained from Promega (Madison, WI). The other endoproteinases, Lys-C, Glu-C, and Asp-N, were purchased from Roche Molecular Biochemicals. The deglycosylation kit, containing N-glycosidase F, Endo-O-glycosidase, and sialidase A, was obtained from ProZyme (San Leandro, CA). Mass calibration standards, des-Arg1-bradykinin, neurotensin, bovine insulin, melittin, trypsinogen, and bovine serum albumin were purchased from Sigma. Matrix materials, CHCA 1The abbreviations and trivial names used are: CHCA, α-cyano-4-hydroxy-cinnamic acid; sinapinic acid, 3,5-dimethoxy-4-hydroxy cinnamic acid; MALDI, matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization; HPLC, high-performance liquid chromatography; TOF, time of flight; MS, mass spectrometry; MS/MS, tandem mass spectrometry; HPLC, high pressure liquid chromatography; MW, molecular weight. and sinapinic acid, were purchased from Aldrich. 75Se-labeled selenite (800 mCi/mg) was purchased from the University of Missouri Research Reactor Facility (Columbia, MO). Other reagents used were analytical grade or better. Rat plasma from which selenoprotein P was purified was purchased from Harlan Bioproducts for Science (Indianapolis, IN). Purification was accomplished as described previously, using a column prepared with the monoclonal antibody 8F11 (8.Himeno S. Chittum H.S. Burk R.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 15769-15775Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). A heparin-Sepharose column was used to separate selenoprotein P isoform peaks from the purified protein preparation as was done previously (7.Chittum H.S. Himeno S. Hill K.E. Burk R.F. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1996; 325: 124-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). These peaks, 1a, 1b, and 2, were used for further characterization. Each separated peak was deglycosylated using N-glycosidase F, endo-O-glycosidase, and sialidase A in a 48-h protocol suggested by the kit manufacturer. SDS-PAGE was performed on the deglycosylated selenoprotein P isoform peaks as described previously (7.Chittum H.S. Himeno S. Hill K.E. Burk R.F. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1996; 325: 124-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). The protein gel band of interest was excised from the gel and digested with modified trypsin (9.Rosenfeld J. Capdevielle J. Guillemot J.C. Ferrara P. Anal. Biochem. 1992; 203: 173-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (1121) Google Scholar, 10.Hellman U. Wernstedt C. Gonez J. Heldin C.H. Anal. Biochem. 1995; 224: 451-455Crossref PubMed Scopus (684) Google Scholar). The destained gel slice was washed, crushed, reduced in dithiothreitol, and alkylated with iodoacetamide. The gel pieces were washed, dehydrated in acetonitrile, and swollen in 10 μl of 50 mm ammonium bicarbonate containing trypsin in a concentration of 0.1 μg/μl. After 15 min, additional 50 mm ammonium bicarbonate was added to cover the gel pieces, and digestion was allowed to proceed overnight. After digestion, ∼1 μl of the supernatant was removed for MALDI mass spectrometry analysis. The remaining supernatant was removed, and the gel slices were extracted twice with 50 μl of 60% acetonitrile/0.1% trifluoroacetic acid. These extraction mixtures were dried and combined with the supernatant for injection onto a C18 column. In-solution Glu-C digestion of deglycosylated full-length selenoprotein P isoform (peak 2) was performed in 25 mm ammonium bicarbonate. Approximately 10 μg of protein was reduced in 10 μl of 45 mmdithiothreitol and alkylated with iodoacetamide. Then 0.3 μg of Glu-C was added before incubation at 37 °C for 18 h. The digestion mixtures were neutralized with 1 μl of 5% trifluoroacetic acid, and peptides were separated on a reverse-phase C18 column. The C-terminal peptide of each isoform of selenoprotein P was isolated from a proteolytic digestion with different endoproteinases. Approximately 10 μg of each selenoprotein P isoform peak was reduced and alkylated before enzymatic digestion as described above. Peak 1a was digested with 0.2 μg of Asp-N in phosphate buffer (pH 8.0) for 18 h, and another sample of it was digested with 0.2 μg of modified trypsin in 50 mm ammonium bicarbonate for 18 h. Peak 1b was digested with 0.2 μg of Lys-C in 50 mmTris-HCl buffer (pH 8.5), and peak 2 was digested with 0.25 μg of Glu-C in 25 mm ammonium bicarbonate. The digestion mixtures were neutralized with 1 μl of 5% trifluoroacetic acid and separated on a C18 column to isolate the C-terminal peptides. The proteolytic peptide mixtures were separated on a Vydac microbore C18 column (2.1 × 250 mm) (Vydac, Hesperia, CA) using an HP 1100 HPLC system (Hewlett-Packard Co., Wilmington, DE). The separation was monitored with a UV detector at 214 nm. Solvent systems of A (0.1% trifluoroacetic acid) and B (94.9% acetonitrile/5% H2O/0.1% trifluoroacetic acid) were used. The peptides were eluted from the column with a flow rate of 0.2 ml/min using the following gradient program: 5% solvent B, 10 min, isocratic; 5–60% solvent B over 50 min, linear gradient; 60% solvent B, 10 min, isocratic; 60–80% solvent B in 10 min, linear gradient; 80% solvent B, 10 min, isocratic; then to 5% solvent B in 5 min, linear gradient. UV-monitored peptide peaks were manually collected in Eppendorf safe-lock polypropylene microcentrifuge tubes. HPLC fractions were lyophilized dry and reconstituted in 40 μl of 50% acetonitrile/50% H2O/0.1% trifluoroacetic acid for mass spectrometry analysis. MALDI mass spectra were obtained using a Perseptive DE-STR MALDI-TOF mass spectrometer (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) equipped with a 337-nm nitrogen laser. The instrument was operated in the linear mode under optimized delayed extraction conditions for peptide and protein analysis. The selenium-containing peptides were analyzed in the reflector mode to obtain high resolution to identify the selenium isotope distribution. Mass calibration was accomplished using des-Arg1-bradykinin (MW 903.46) and bovine insulin (MW 5733.58) for peptide analysis and bovine trypsinogen (MW 23981) and bovine serum albumin (MW 66430) for protein analysis in the linear mode. In reflector mode, neurotensin (MW 1671.909) and melittin (MW 2844.754) were used as calibration compounds. A matrix of CHCA, prepared at 10 mg/ml in 50% acetonitrile/49.9% H2O/0.1% trifluoroacetic acid, was used for peptide analysis, and sinapinic acid at 10 mg/ml in 50% acetonitrile/49.9% H2O/0.1% trifluoroacetic acid was used as the matrix for protein analysis. The samples were prepared by dried-droplet method on a stainless steel MALDI plate. Nanoelectrospray was performed on a Finnigan LCQ (Finnigan, San Jose, CA) with a nanospray ion source installed (Protana A/S, Odense, Denmark). The sample of 2 μl was loaded into the metal-coated glass capillary (Protana A/S, Odense, Denmark). The capillary was positioned about 1 mm from the heated capillary. The spray voltage was set at 800 V. The heated capillary was kept at 150 °C. The capillary voltage was set at 43 V, and the tube lens was offset at −10 V. The other parameters for ion optics were tuned to obtain the most intensity for the ion of interest. In MS/MS mode, the precursor ion of interest was isolated and fragmented at 25–35% collision energy, depending on the nature of the peptide. Theoretical isotope peaks were calculated using software that was supplied with the Perseptive DE-STR MADLI-TOF mass spectrometer. Mass spectrometric peptide mapping has been an important analytical tool for verifying protein sequence and identifying proteins by data base search. This technique involves the digestion of the protein by specific endoproteases or chemicals. The resulting peptide mixture is subjected to analysis by mass spectrometry, for example MALDI-TOF MS. The comparison of the set of peptide molecular ion masses observed with the expected digestion fragment masses generally yields a sequence coverage of 60–90%. Using this technique, we have verified the sequence of selenoprotein P, originally deduced from its cDNA. Fig. 1 shows peptide maps of the full-length selenoprotein P isoform produced by MALDI-TOF MS after trypsin and Glu-C digestion. The masses of peaks in the spectra were compared with theoretical masses of predicted peptides (Tables S1 and S2 in the on-line supplement), and the peaks in the spectra that could be identified were labeled with the residue numbers of the peptides. Only three stretches of three amino acid residues each were not verified in this study. The sequence coverage was 97.5%, and it is shown in Fig. S1 in the on-line supplement. Selenocysteine was confirmed to be present in the peptides predicted to contain it by showing that the determined peptide mass matched the predicted peptide mass (which included the mass of selenocysteine). From the peptide mapping, the 10 selenocysteines located at residues 40, 245, 263, 304, 316, 338, 352, 354, 361, and 363, respectively, have been identified. Table I summarizes the experiments that identified each of the selenocysteine residues in the full-length isoform.Table ISummary of the identification of the 10 selenocysteine residues using MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry operated in the reflector modePartial sequenceEnzymeNumber of selenocysteine residuesResidue position(s) of selenocysteinePeptide sequence1-aAll the cysteine and selenocysteine residues were modified by iodoacetamide (U = selenocysteine).[M + H]exp1-bThis m/znumber is for the isotope peak of the peptide that has the greatest abundance.[M + H]calc28–51Glu-C1 40GTVTVVALLQASU2714.382714.35YLCLLQASRLE239–260Trypsin1 245QGHLESUDMGASE2435.082435.05GLQLSLAQR252–278Glu-C1 263GLQLSLAQRKLUR3292.623292.67RGCINQLLCKLSEE298–324Trypsin2304, 316SGSAITUQCAENLP3113.283113.20SLCSUQGLFAEEK333–357Trypsin3338, 352, 354SPPAAUHSQHVSPT2879.022878.99EASPNUSUNNK348–366Glu-C4352, 354, 361, 363ASPNUSUNNKTKK2487.842487.80UKUNLNMass accuracy is <0.08 Da.1-a All the cysteine and selenocysteine residues were modified by iodoacetamide (U = selenocysteine).1-b This m/znumber is for the isotope peak of the peptide that has the greatest abundance. Open table in a new tab Mass accuracy is <0.08 Da. In addition, selenium was identified directly in those peptides by its isotope pattern. Selenium has a unique isotope distribution of74Se (0.89%), 76Se (9.37%), 77Se (7.63%), 78Se (23.77%), 80Se (49.61%), and82Se (8.73%). Fig. 2 shows the isotopic detail of the mass peak of a peptide corresponding to residues 239–260 of selenoprotein P. Fig. 2a shows the expanded peak of this selenopeptide from MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry operated in reflector mode. Fig. 2b shows the theoretical expanded peak of this selenopeptide that was generated by a computer program. Fig. 2c shows the theoretical peak of the same peptide with a sulfur atom replacing the selenium atom. In Fig. 2,a and b are almost identical, whereas Fig. 2c has a different mass pattern. This allows the conclusion that the experimental peptide contains one selenium atom. This selenopeptide was further studied by fragmenting the doubly charged peptide ion at m/z 1218.0 to verify the peptide sequence (Fig. 3). The inset shows the zoom scan of the parent ion, which indicates the charge state of +2 and its content of one selenium atom. With the arginine at the C-terminal as a favorable charge-carrying site, the abundant y ion series was observed. It is of interest to note that the b ion series in this case was a b-17 ([b-NH3]+) ion series due to the glutamine located at the N terminus. The pattern of fragments confirms the predicted sequence of the peptide. Expanded peaks of selenopeptides containing two, three, and four selenium atoms have characteristic isotope patterns (Fig. S2 in the on-line supplement). The isotope pattern of each peak closely approximated the pattern predicted by a computer program (predicted peaks containing two, three, and four selenium atoms, shown in Fig. S3 in the on-line supplement). All the selenopeptides listed in Table Iwere further studied using MS/MS to verify the predicted amino acid sequence (Fig. 3, as well as Figs. S4–S8 in the on-line supplement). The pattern of fragments confirmed the predicted sequence of each of the selenopeptides. Purified selenoprotein P can be separated into three peaks using heparin chromatography (7.Chittum H.S. Himeno S. Hill K.E. Burk R.F. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1996; 325: 124-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Two of the peaks, 1b and 2, contain one isoform of the selenoprotein each. The other peak, 1a, contains two isoforms, and these have not been characterized beyond the demonstration that they have the same N terminus as the other two isoforms. MALDI-TOF mass spectra of the three peaks from the heparin column were obtained (Fig. S9 in the on-line supplement). Peak 2 is the full-length isoform and has an average mass of 50,474 ± 200 Da. Peak 1b is the short isoform and has an average mass of 36,136 ± 200 Da. Peak 1a demonstrates two peaks with masses of 38,482 ± 200 Da and 48,842 ± 200 Da, which are both intermediate in size between the other two isoforms. This indicates that peak 1a contains two additional isoforms. All four mass peaks are broad, which is consistent with microheterogeneity, that is presumably the result of their glycosylation. Scheme FS1 depicts the strategy for determining the C termini of the isoforms. Each isoform was digested with a particular protease, and the predicted C-terminal peptide was sought using mass spectrometry. After identification of the peak by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry, the amino acid sequence was determined by MS/MS to confirm that it was indeed the predicted C-terminal peptide. The C-terminal peptide (residues 235–244) of the short isoform was identified in a Lys-C digestion, and its amino acid sequence was verified by MS/MS (Fig. S10 in the on-line supplement). This experiment confirms the characterization of this isoform that was done by conventional C-terminal sequencing (8.Himeno S. Chittum H.S. Burk R.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 15769-15775Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). A similar experiment (Fig. S8 in the on-line supplement) confirmed that the isoform in peak 2 was full-length. Based on the mass of the protein measured by MALDI-TOF MS, the shorter isoform in peak 1a appeared to terminate at the third UGA in the mRNA. To confirm this, peak 1a was subjected to endoproteinase Asp-N digestion. The C-terminal peptide (residues 246–262) was isolated by HPLC and was subjected to MS/MS experiments by fragmenting the doubly charged ion with m/z 909.50 to verify the sequence, as shown in Fig. 4. These results confirm that this isoform indeed terminates at the third UGA codon. The longer isoform in peak 1a was predicted to terminate at the seventh or eighth UGA based on its mass (Fig. S9 of the on-line supplement). However, when a trypsin digest of it was studied by MALDI-TOF MS (not shown), neither predicted C-terminal peptide could be identified. Therefore the digest was subjected to HPLC, and each chromatographic peak was evaluated by MALDI-TOF MS. Fig. 5 shows the spectrum of one HPLC peak. In Fig. 5a, a complex pattern is seen with the lowest mass being 2021.6 followed by signals at mass increments of 203, 162, 291, and another 291. These mass increments correspond to the masses of N-acetylgalactosamine, galactose, and N-glycolylneuraminic acid, respectively. This indicates that this peptide is an O-linked glycopeptide. The glycopeptide was further treated with endo-O-glycosidase and sialidase A. The glycopeptide signals disappeared, and the intensity of the peptide peak at 2021.60 Da increased (Fig. 5b). This is the predicted mass of the C-terminal peptide that terminates at the seventh UGA. MS/MS verification of the sequence of the deglycosylated peptide was obtained (S11 of the on-line supplement). The inset of that figure shows the zoom scan of the parent ion (+2), which indicates that the peptide contains one selenocysteine residue (SeCys338). These results indicate that this peptide is variably O-glycosylated and that the isoform terminates at the seventh UGA. Formal sequencing of the shorter three isoforms was not undertaken in this study, but some of their peptides were identified by mass (data not shown) in the experiment performed to determine their C termini. For selenoprotein P1, 59% of the predicted amino acid sequence (residues 1–18, 86–120, 124–152, 178–232) was identified by mass. For selenoprotein P2 and selenoprotein P6, respectively, 42% (residues 55–120, 178–193, 233–260) and 62% (residues 57–120, 124–145, 178–260, 292–324) of the predicted amino acid residues were identified. Thus, four isoforms of selenoprotein P have been identified. They share the same N terminus and appear to be derived from the same amino acid sequence. One isoform is full-length, but the other three terminate at positions predicted to be occupied by selenocysteine residues (UGA codons in the open reading frame of the mRNA). Selenoprotein P is the only selenoprotein identified so far that contains more than one selenium atom. The presence of 10 UGAs in the open reading frame of rat selenoprotein P mRNA implies that the full-length protein contains 10 selenocysteine residues. Because there is no precedent for multiple selenocysteines in a protein and it is at least conceivable that a particular UGA might specify incorporation of a residue other than selenocysteine, it seemed important to determine whether selenocysteine was present at the sequence position of each UGA. In earlier work, we had shown that the first six selenocysteines are present at their predicted positions (8.Himeno S. Chittum H.S. Burk R.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 15769-15775Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Table I demonstrates that all 10 selenocysteines are present in the full-length protein. Moreover, none of the selenocysteines had been modified. This indicates that all are available for redox reactions. Selenoprotein P, as purified from rat plasma, is present as four isoforms. One isoform is designated selenoprotein P10(Se-P10) because it terminates at the hard stop UAA in the mRNA and contains 10 selenium atoms (Scheme FS2). The other three isoforms terminate at positions of UGA codons in the open reading frame, sites where selenocysteine is present in selenoprotein P10. Respectively, the shorter isoforms terminate at the second, third, and seventh UGAs. Evidence suggests that all four isoforms share the same amino acid sequence and differ from one another by terminating at different sites within that sequence (Scheme FS2). A previous study supports this conclusion for selenoprotein P10 and selenoprotein P1 (8.Himeno S. Chittum H.S. Burk R.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 15769-15775Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Each of those two isoforms was shown to have the expected amino acid composition and appropriate N- and C-terminal amino acid sequences. Moreover, amino acid sequencing of a mixture of all isoforms by Edman chemistry yielded only sequences predicted by the cDNA (8.Himeno S. Chittum H.S. Burk R.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 15769-15775Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). In the present study, the high sensitivity of mass spectrometry allowed further characterization of all four isoforms. The amino acid sequence of selenoprotein P10 was demonstrated to match the predicted sequence with only nine amino acid residues not being verified (Fig. S1 of the on-line supplement). Of those nine unverified residues, five had been verified in the previous study (8.Himeno S. Chittum H.S. Burk R.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 15769-15775Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar), so only four (residues 121, 122, 325, and 326) of the total of 366 predicted remain unverified by direct analysis of the protein. Significant portions of the sequences of the three shorter isoforms were verified also. These findings are consistent with the hypothesis that all four isoforms arise from the same mRNA. The dual nature of UGA as a termination codon and a sense codon has been studied before by several groups (11.McCaughan K.K. Brown C.M. Dalphin M.E. Berry M.J. Tate W.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 5431-5435Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar, 12.Nasim M.T. Jaenecke S. Belduz A. Kollmus H. Flohé L. McCarthy J.E.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 14846-14852Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 13.Grunder-Culemann E. Martin III, G.W. Tujebajeva R. Harney J.W. Berry M.J. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 310: 699-707Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Using cell lines transfected with selenoprotein cDNA constructs, these groups have shown that the nucleotide context of the UGA codon affects its read-through efficiency. The two nucleotides downstream and the codon upstream from the UGA have significant effects. In the systems studied, a purine in the +1 position (downstream) promotes termination (11.McCaughan K.K. Brown C.M. Dalphin M.E. Berry M.J. Tate W.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 5431-5435Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). The second, seventh, eighth, ninth, and tenth UGAs in selenoprotein P mRNA are followed by purines. A recent report has shown that the +2 nucleotide can also increase termination if a +1 pyrimidine is followed by a +2 purine (13.Grunder-Culemann E. Martin III, G.W. Tujebajeva R. Harney J.W. Berry M.J. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 310: 699-707Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). In selenoprotein P, the first, third, fourth, fifth, and sixth UGA codons are followed by such a pyrimidine-purine combination. Thus, all 10 UGA codons of selenoprotein P mRNA are present in downstream termination contexts. Changes in the upstream codon have generally caused increased termination (12.Nasim M.T. Jaenecke S. Belduz A. Kollmus H. Flohé L. McCarthy J.E.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 14846-14852Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar), and that is not applicable to the present discussion. Thus, current knowledge of nucleotide context cannot explain the production of the isoforms found in this study. It seems likely that trans-acting factors that can be produced independent of the mRNA will be responsible for the termination leading to isoform production. Selenoprotein P provides a unique opportunity to study in vivo factors involved in the alternative functions of the UGA codon. It remains a theoretical possibility that the shorter isoforms are produced from the full-length protein by proteolysis. If that were the case, however, there would have to be a protease that cleaves the protein at specific selenocysteine residues. Because no such protease is known, it seems more likely that termination of translation is responsible for production of the isoforms. This question remains open, however. The antibody-based methods for purification and measurement of selenoprotein P do not allow distinction among the isoforms. This suggests that the available antibodies are directed toward epitopes in the N-terminal region of the protein. It will be important to develop methods to detect and measure individual isoforms of selenoprotein P. That will allow determination of the cells that produce each isoform and assessment of the physiology of each isoform. Correlation of physiological studies (4.Burk R.F. Hill K.E. Read R. Bellew T.

Little is known about the biogenesis and structural and functional properties of YidC, itself a polytopic IMP. Here we analyze the targeting and membrane integration of YidC using in vivo and in vitro approaches. The combined data indicate that YidC is targeted by the signal recognition particle and inserts at the SecAYEG-YidC translocon early during biogenesis, unlike its mitochondrial homologue Oxa1p. In addition, YidC is shown to be relatively abundant compared with other components involved in IMP assembly and is predominantly localized at the poles of the cell.

Luirink J. Mol. Microbiol. 2001; 40: 314-322Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). The majority of IMPs are targeted to the membrane by the signal recognition particle (SRP) and its receptor FtsY that mediates co-translational targeting to the Sec-translocon (2.Herskovits A.A. Bochkareva E.S. Bibi E. Mol. Microbiol. 2000; 38: 927-939Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). The SRP, which consists of the 4.5 S RNA and Ffh (for fifty-four homologue) is homologous to the eukaryotic SRP but less complex in composition. The core Sec-translocon consists of the integral membrane components SecY, SecE and SecG, which form a heterotrimer, and the peripheral subunit SecA (3.Manting E.H. Driessen A.J.M. Mol. Microbiol. 2000; 37: 226-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). The translocon serves as a translocating pore for both secretory proteins and IMPs. SecA is an ATPase that functions as a molecular motor that drives the translocation of secretory proteins and large periplasmic domains of IMPs through the SecYEG pore. Recent evidence shows that a novel component, YidC, is specifically involved in Sec-dependent IMP integration (4.Luirink J. Samuelsson T. de Gier J.-W. FEBS Lett. 2001; 1: 1-5Crossref Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Using a site-specific photocross-linking procedure, YidC was shown to interact with the nascent IMPs, FtsQ, Lep, and mannitol permease, as they move laterally from the Sec-translocon into the lipid bilayer (5.Beck K. Eisner G. Trescher D. Dalbey R.E. Brunner J. Müller M. EMBO Rep. 2001; 2: 709-714Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar, 6.Houben E.N.G. Scotti P.A. Valent Q.A. Brunner J. de Gier J.-W.

Luirink J. EMBO Rep. 2001; 6: 524-529Crossref Scopus (154) Google Scholar). This interaction appeared to be specific for the transmembrane segments (TMs) in the nascent polypeptide. Moreover, YidC could be co-purified with the Sec-translocon suggesting a physical connection (7.Scotti P.A. Urbanus M.L. Brunner J. de Gier J.W. von Heijne G. van der Does C. Driessen A.J. Oudega B. Luirink J. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 542-549Crossref PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar). Upon depletion of YidC, the assembly of Sec-dependent IMPs such as Lep and FtsQ is hampered, although the effect is relatively mild (8.Urbanus M.L. Scotti P.A. Fröderberg L. Sääf A. de Gier J.-W. Brunner J. Samuelson J.C. Dalbey R.E. Oudega B. Luirink J. EMBO Rep. 2001; 6: 524-529Crossref Scopus (154) Google Scholar,9.Samuelson J.C. Chen M.Y. Jiang F.L. Möller I. Wiedmann M. Kuhn A. Phillips G.J. Dalbey R.E. Nature. 2000; 406: 637-641Crossref PubMed Scopus (423) Google Scholar). In contrast to most IMPs, some small phage coat proteins (like Pf3 coat and M13 procoat proteins) insert into the inner membrane independent of the Sec-translocon (10.Dalbey R.E. Kuhn A. Ann. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2000; 16: 51-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). These proteins were considered to partition spontaneously into the lipid bilayer (i.e. without the requirement of any proteinaceous factors and only depending on the proton motive force to energize the process). However, it was recently demonstrated that membrane assembly of M13 coat protein is almost completely blocked upon depletion of YidC suggesting a crucial role for YidC in the integration of Sec-independent proteins (9.Samuelson J.C. Chen M.Y. Jiang F.L. Möller I. Wiedmann M. Kuhn A. Phillips G.J. Dalbey R.E. Nature. 2000; 406: 637-641Crossref PubMed Scopus (423) Google Scholar, 11.Samuelson J.C. Jiang F. Yi L. Chen M. de Gier J.-W. Kuhn A. Dalbey R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 16: 16Google Scholar). YidC is homologous to the mitochondrial IMP Oxa1p and to the thylakoid membrane protein Alb3, which both have been implicated in membrane protein integration (4.Luirink J. Samuelsson T. de Gier J.-W. FEBS Lett. 2001; 1: 1-5Crossref Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Oxa1p is essential for the correct insertion of a subset of both mitochondrial-encoded IMPs (like pCoxII) and nuclear-encoded IMPs (like Oxa1p itself). Interestingly, mitochondria do not have an SRP-like targeting pathway or a Sec-like translocon suggesting that Oxa1p might function in a fashion similar to YidC in the Sec-independent route. YidC is a polytopic IMP that spans the membrane six times with an N-in, C-in topology and a large, poorly conserved periplasmic domain between TM1 (signal anchor sequence) and TM2 (Fig. 2A) (12.Sääf A. Monne M. de Gier J.-W. von Heijne G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 30415-30418Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). As is true for most polytopic IMPs, hardly anything is known about the targeting, assembly, localization, and cellular abundance of YidC. Here, we present evidence that YidC is targeted co-translationally by the SRP to the Sec-translocon, which appears to be required for proper assembly. Nascent YidC is shown to contact SecA, SecY, and pre-existing YidC very early during biosynthesis. YidC is found to be present in excess over SecYEG. Finally, using GFP fusion technology we found that YidC accumulates at the poles of the cell. Restriction enzymes, Expand long template PCR system, and Lumi-LightPLUS Western blotting substrate were from Roche Molecular Biochemicals. Megashort script T7 transcription kit was from Ambion Inc. [35S]methionine and protein A-Sepharose were from Amersham Biosciences. T4 Ligase and T4 DNA polymerase were from Epicentre Technologies. All other chemicals were supplied by Sigma. Antiserum against a C-terminal peptide of YidC has been described previously (7.Scotti P.A. Urbanus M.L. Brunner J. de Gier J.W. von Heijne G. van der Does C. Driessen A.J. Oudega B. Luirink J. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 542-549Crossref PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar). In addition, an antiserum against purified hisYidC (see below) was raised in rabbit by Agrisera (Umeå, Sweden). The antisera directed against Trigger Factor (TF) and SecA were gifts from W. Wickner, and anti-SecY was a gift from A. Driessen. E. coli strain MRE600 was used to prepare a lysate for translation of in vitrosynthesized mRNA and suppression of UAG stop codons in the presence of (Tmd)Phe-tRNAsup. Strain MC4100 grown in Luria Bertani (LB) medium was used to isolate inverted membrane vesicles (IMVs) and as an expression host for plasmid pEH1hisYidC (overexpression of YidC carrying a hexahistidine tag)(13). The E. coli strain JS7131 in which yidC is under the control of the araBADoperator/promoter (9.Samuelson J.C. Chen M.Y. Jiang F.L. Möller I. Wiedmann M. Kuhn A. Phillips G.J. Dalbey R.E. Nature. 2000; 406: 637-641Crossref PubMed Scopus (423) Google Scholar) was used to study the complementation of YidC depletion by expression of YidC-GFP. The 4.5 S RNA conditional strain FF283 and the SecE depletion strain CM124 were cultured and depleted as described previously (14.Ribes V. Römisch K. Giner A. Dobberstein B. Tollervey D.

The conditional SecA strain BA13 and its control strain DO251 were cultured and depleted for SecA essentially as described (17.Oliver D.B. Beckwith J. Cell. 1982; 30: 311-319Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar, 18.Qi H.Y. Bernstein H.D. J. Biol.

EMBO J. 1994; 13: 3272-3277Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar) was cultured in M9 minimal medium to the mid-exponential growth phase as described previously (16.de Gier J.-W. Scotti P.A.

Chem. 1997; 272: 4087-4093Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar) was used to complement the SecG deletion strain KN370 with SecG. Plasmid pEH1YidC, harboring yidC under control of a lac promoter, was constructed in a 3-step procedure as follows. First, the 5′-region of yidC was cloned NcoI-KpnI from pAra14-YidC (7.Scotti P.A. Urbanus M.L. Brunner J. de Gier J.W. von Heijne G. van der Does C. Driessen A.J. Oudega B. Luirink J. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 542-549Crossref PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar) in the pEH1 vector. Second, using pAra14-YidC as a template a SmaI site was introduced downstream of yidC by PCR. Subsequently, the 3′ yidC fragment was cloned KpnI-SmaI in pEH1YidC NcoI-KpnI to generate full-length yidC. For YidC-GFP expression, YidC was fused at its C terminus to the N terminus of a GFP variant that has been selected to fold well in E. coli (21.Drew D.E. von Heijne G. Nordlund P. de Gier J.-W. FEBS Lett. 2001; 2: 220-224Crossref Scopus (190) Google Scholar). The YidC-GFP fusion was cut out with XbaI-HindIII from plasmid pWaldoYidC-GFP and cloned XbaI-SmaI (the HindIII site of the DNA fragment harboring the YidC-GFP fusion was made blunt using T4 DNA polymerase) into the pEH1 expression vector yielding pEH1YidC-GFP. Plasmids pC4meth52YidCTAG17 and pC4Meth96YidCTAG17 were obtained by PCR using pEH1YidC as a template. They encode truncated YidC fused to a C-terminal 4× methionine tag to improve the labeling efficiency and contain an amber mutation at position 17 to enable sup-tRNA photocross-linking (see below). The nucleotide sequences of all cloned mutant genes were confirmed by DNA sequencing. Truncated mRNA was prepared as described previously (7.Scotti P.A. Urbanus M.L. Brunner J. de Gier J.W. von Heijne G. van der Does C. Driessen A.J. Oudega B. Luirink J. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 542-549Crossref PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar) from HindIII-linearized pC4Meth52YidCTAG17 or pCMeth96YidCTAG17. For photocross-linking, (Tmd)Phe was site-specifically incorporated into YidC nascent chains by suppression of a UAG stop codon using (Tmd)Phe-tRNAsup in an E. coli in vitro translation system containing [35S]methionine to label the nascent chains. This procedure has been described previously (7.Scotti P.A. Urbanus M.L. Brunner J. de Gier J.W. von Heijne G. van der Does C. Driessen A.J. Oudega B. Luirink J. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 542-549Crossref PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar, 8.Urbanus M.L. Scotti P.A. Fröderberg L. Sääf A. de Gier J.-W. Brunner J. Samuelson J.C. Dalbey R.E. Oudega B. Luirink J. EMBO Rep. 2001; 6: 524-529Crossref Scopus (154) Google Scholar). Targeting to IMVs, photocross-linking and carbonate extraction (to separate soluble and pheriperal membrane proteins from integral membrane proteins) were carried out as described previously (7.Scotti P.A. Urbanus M.L. Brunner J. de Gier J.W. von Heijne G. van der Does C. Driessen A.J. Oudega B. Luirink J. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 542-549Crossref PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar). Carbonate soluble and insoluble fractions were either trichloracetic acid-precipitated or immunoprecipitated. The material used for immunoprecipitation was 4-fold the amount used for trichloracetic acid precipitation. Sample analysis (SDS-PAGE and phosphorimaging) was as described previously (7.Scotti P.A. Urbanus M.L. Brunner J. de Gier J.W. von Heijne G. van der Does C. Driessen A.J. Oudega B. Luirink J. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 542-549Crossref PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar). Strains FF285, BA13, DO251, CM124, and KN370 were grown to the mid-exponential phase of growth. Expression of YidC was induced for 3 min with either 1 mm IPTG (from pEH1YidC in strain CM124) or 0.2%l-arabinose (from pAra14-YidC in the strains FF283, BA13, DO251, and KN370). Aliquots were pulse-labeled for 30 s with 150 μCi of [35S]methionine and converted to spheroplasts as described previously (16.de Gier J.-W. Scotti P.A. Sääf A. Valent Q.A. Kuhn A. Luirink J. von Heijne G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 14646-14651Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Aliquots of the spheroplast suspensions were incubated on ice for 1 h in the presence or absence of proteinase K (0.3 mg/ml). Subsequently, phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride was added to the spheroplast suspensions (0.33 mg/ml) to inhibit the protease. Finally, the samples were precipitated in 10% trichloracetic acid and immunoprecipitated with antisera against YidC, OmpA, or AraB/BandX and analyzed using SDS-PAGE. The cellular abundance of YidC was determined essentially as described (22.van Klompenburg W. Whitley P. Diemel R. von Heijne G. de Kruijff B. Mol. Membr. Biol. 1995; 12: 349-353Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). An overnight culture of MC4100 was diluted 1:100 in LB medium and grown at 37 °C to the mid-exponential phase of growth. Cells were harvested and diluted for life cell counts by plating on LB-agar. From the remainder of the samples a range of 0.05–0.0025 OD660units of cells was analyzed using SDS-PAGE and Western blotting next to a 1–20-ng standard of purified hisYidC. The blots were incubated with antibodies directed against hisYidC and developed using Lumi-LightPLUS Western blotting substrate. The chemiluminescent signal was detected using the Fluor-S MultiImager (Bio-Rad) and quantified using Multi-Analyst 1.0.2 software (Bio-Rad). HisYidC was purified from Top10F′ containing pEH1hisYidC as described previously (13.van der Laan M. Houben E.N.G. Nouwen N. Luirink J. Driessen A.J.M. EMBO Rep. 2001; 21: 519-523Crossref Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Protein concentration was determined using the DC protein assay (Bio-Rad) and bovine serum albumin as a standard. YidC-GFP was expressed in the conditional YidC depletion strain JS7131. Cells were grown for 6 h at 37 °C in LB medium supplemented with 0.2%l-arabinose (to generate non-depleted control cells) or 10 μm IPTG (to deplete for YidC and express YidC-GFP). Cells were then harvested and used for analysis of YidC/YidC-GFP expression and fluorescence microscopy. To monitor YidC and YidC-GFP expression, cells were washed with M9 minimal medium and resuspended in M9 minimal medium supplemented with 0.2% l-arabinose or 10 mm IPTG. Subsequently, the cells were labeled for 1 h with [35S]methionine (150 μCi/ml), trichloracetic acid-precipitated, washed with cold acetone, and resuspended in 10 mm Tris-HCl pH 8.0/2% SDS. YidC and YidC-GFP were immunoprecipitated with anti-YidC serum and analyzed by SDS-PAGE. For localization of YidC-GFP, cells expressing YidC-GFP were harvested and resuspended in 50 mm Tris-HCl pH 8.0, 200 mmNaCl, 15 mm EDTA. GFP fluorescence was viewed with an Axioplan 2 microscope (Zeiss) equipped with a filter set for fluorescein isothiocyanate. Images were captured using a CCD camera (Color Cool View, Photonic Sciences) and Image Pro-Plus software. We analyzed the pathway of targeting and membrane insertion of nascent YidC (a polytopic IMP) using an in vitrotranslation/targeting/photocross-linking assay that we initially developed for the analysis of molecular interactions during biosynthesis of the less complex IMPs, FtsQ and Lep (6.Houben E.N.G.

Radiolabeled nascent chains of YidC of 52 and 96 amino acids were synthesized by translation of truncated mRNA in a membrane-free E. coli extract in the presence of [35S]methionine. Purified inverted IMVs were added from the start of the translation reaction to allow co-translational membrane targeting and insertion of the translation intermediates. To specifically probe the molecular environment of the first TM, a stop codon (TAG) was introduced at position 17 in the center of the TM region and suppressed during in vitro synthesis by the addition of (Tmd)Phe-tRNAsup that carries a photoreactive probe. After the translation/insertion reaction, one-half of each sample was irradiated with UV light to induce cross-linking whereas the other half was kept in the dark to serve as a control. The samples were extracted with carbonate to separate untargeted material from the membrane-integrated material, and cross-linking partners were identified by immunoprecipitation. In both constructs, the TAG17 mutation was efficiently suppressed by (Tmd)Phe-tRNAsup (data not shown), resulting in nascent YidC of the expected apparent molecular weight. Assuming that the ribosome covers ∼35 amino acids, the 52-mer only partially exposes the TM outside the ribosome, and the photocross-linking group is just exposed outside the ribosome (Fig. 1A). Using this construct, a major cross-linking adduct of ∼60 kDa was observed in the untargeted (carbonate soluble) nascent chains (Fig. 1B, lanes 1 and 2). Immunoprecipitation identified TF as the cross-linking partner (Fig. 1B, lane 3). Furthermore, two less prominent cross-linking adducts of ∼55 and ∼100 kDa were identified as Ffh, the protein component of the SRP, and SecA (Fig. 1B, lanes 4 and 5). Anti-Ffh also precipitated smaller adducts that might represent degradation products. The 52-mer was less efficiently integrated in the membrane than the longer YidC construct as judged by the criterion of carbonate resistance (∼25% versus∼45%, not shown). Membrane-integrated 52-mer gave rise to distinct cross-linking adducts of ∼40, ∼60, and ∼100 kDa (Fig. 1B, lanes 6 and 7), which were immunoprecipitated with anti-SecY, anti-YidC, and anti-SecA, respectively (Fig. 1B, lanes 8–10). For identification of nascent YidC-YidC adducts, antiserum raised against the C terminus of YidC was used to distinguish full-length YidC from nascent YidC. A fourth cross-linking adduct of ∼55 kDa was not immunoprecipitated with any of the antisera used and remains to be identified. In the longer 96-mer, the TM and ∼38 residues of the first periplasmic domain are exposed outside the ribosome (Fig. 1A). Untargeted nascent chains still cross-linked to TF, giving rise to several distinct adducts possibly caused by the binding of TF at several positions in this longer nascent chain (23.Valent Q.A. de Gier J.-W. van Heijne G. Kendall D.A. ten Hagen-Jongman C.M. Oudega B. Luirink J. Mol. Microbiol. 1997; 25: 53-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). Ffh and SecA were cross-linked but to a lesser extent than with the shorter nascent chains (Fig. 1C, lanes 1–5). The membrane-integrated nascent chains showed predominantly cross-linking to YidC and SecA. SecY was also cross-linked, albeit much less efficiently than with the 52-mer (Fig. 1C, lanes 6–10). Taken together, these data show that the first TM in short nascent YidC interacts with TF and SRP and inserts into the inner membrane in a carbonate resistant configuration in the vicinity of pre-existing YidC, SecY, and SecA. The difference in cross-linking efficiencies of the 52-mer and 96-mer to SecY suggests that the first TM of YidC is close to SecY only early during the membrane insertion process. We have shown that nascent YidC interacts with Ffh, TF, SecA, SecY, and YidC. To investigate whether these interactions reflect an in vivo dependence on the SRP targeting pathway or Sec-translocon for correct membrane assembly of the full-length protein, we monitored the requirements for in vivo assembly of YidC in a proteinase K accessibility assay. When YidC is correctly targeted and assembled in the inner membrane, the large periplasmic loop between TM1 and TM2 (Fig. 2A) is proteinase K-resistant except for a small region near TM1 (Fig. 2A) (12.Sääf A. Monne M. de Gier J.-W. von Heijne G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 30415-30418Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Consequently, proteinase K treatment of spheroplasts derived from wild-type cells results in a small band shift of YidC in SDS-PAGE (Fig. 2B, lanes 1 and 2). OmpA and band X are periplasmic and cytoplasmic control proteins, respectively, used to monitor spheroplast formation (24.de Gier J.-W. Mansournia P. Valent Q.A. Phillips G.J. Luirink J. von Heijne G. FEBS Lett. 1996; 399: 307-309Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). In addition, proOmpA processing was monitored to check SecA and SecE depletion. Depletion of 4.5 S RNA, the RNA component of SRP, affected the assembly of YidC into the inner membrane as is evident from the appearance of full-length YidC in proteinase K-treated spheroplasts (Fig. 2B). Depletion of SecA had a similar effect whereas depletion of SecE had an even stronger effect (Fig. 2, C and D). The SecE depletion strain was used because it enables the most efficient inactivation of the SecYEG core translocon thus far (15.Traxler B. Murphy C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 12394-12400Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Upon depletion of SecE, SecY is rapidly degraded by the protease FtsH (25.Kihara A. Akiyama Y. Ito K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 4532-4536Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). We also monitored the assembly of YidC in a SecG deletion background (Fig. 2E). The Sec-translocon component SecG also seems to be required for the efficient assembly of YidC. Unfortunately, we could not monitor the assembly of YidC in a YidC depletion background because the YidC background expression levels from the plasmid-borne copy of YidC were sufficient to alleviate chromosomal YidC depletion. Taken together, these data confirm the involvement of the SRP, SecA, and SecYEG in the proper targeting and assembly of YidC into the inner membrane. To determine the abundance of YidC in E. coli cells a semiquantitative Western blot procedure was employed. MC4100 was grown to the mid-exponential phase of growth and harvested for life cell counts and analysis by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting. A range of 0.05–0.0025 OD660 units of cells was analyzed (Fig. 3). To calculate the amount of YidC from Western blot, the chemiluminescent signal of a standard of purified hisYidC (1–20 ng) was quantified and fitted. A linear relationship between the amount of hisYidC and the chemiluminscent signal was observed throughout this range. The amount of YidC in the cell samples was calculated and correlated to the life cell counts. A MC4100 cell contains ∼0.27 fg of YidC corresponding to 2700 copies of YidC per cell. A duplicate experiment resulted in a similar amount of 2500 copies of YidC per cell (data not shown). Where the inner membrane assembly of IMPs occurs has not yet been studied. Because YidC appears to be exclusively involved in IMP insertion and assembly (9.Samuelson J.C. Chen M.Y. Jiang F.L. Möller I. Wiedmann M. Kuhn A. Phillips G.J. Dalbey R.E. Nature. 2000; 406: 637-641Crossref PubMed Scopus (423) Google Scholar), we have studied the spatial localization of YidC in the inner membrane using GFP-tagging technology. GFP was fused to the C terminus of YidC, and cloned into the IPTG inducible expression vector pEH1. The YidC depletion strain JS7131, in which yidC is under the control of the araBAD operator/promoter, was transformed with pEH1 (empty control vector) and pEH1YidC-GFP. To test if the fusion construct was functional, JS7131 (pEH1YidC-GFP) and its control strain JS7131 (pEH1) were plated onto LB-agar plates containing 0.2% l-arabinose (to generate non-depleted control cells) or 0.2% glucose (to generate YidC-depleted cells). Because YidC is essential for growth, the control strain JS7131(pEH1) could not grow in the absence of l-arabinose. In contrast, JS7131 (pEH1YidC-GFP) grew in the presence and absence ofl-arabinose without any discernable differences (data not shown). These observations demonstrate that even at uninduced expression levels, leaky expression of the plasmid-encoded YidC-GFP is able to complement depletion of YidC. However, in liquid culture uninduced JS7131 (pEH1YidC-GFP) grows slightly slower than JS7131 (pEH1) grown in the presence of 0.2% l-arabinose. An additional induction with 10 μm IPTG was required for optimal growth (Fig. 4A). The expression of YidC-GFP was monitored by labeling JS7131 (pEH1YidC-GFP) cells grown either in the presence of 0.2% l-arabinose or 10 μm IPTG with [35S]methionine and subsequent immunoprecipitation using antiserum to YidC (Fig. 4B). Cells in which the chromosomal yidC but not the plasmid yidC-GFP copy was expressed contained only a trace amount of YidC-GFP and a normal amount of YidC, whereas in YidC-depleted/YidC-GFP-induced cells only YidC-GFP could be detected at a level comparable with chromosome encoded YidC. Taken together, these data unambiguously show that the YidC-GFP fusion is functional. In addition, cell fractionation studies indicated that both YidC and YidC-GFP are membrane-associated (data not shown). To visualize YidC-GFP in living cells, cells of strain JS7131 (pEH1YidC-GFP) were grown in LB medium in the presence of 10 μm IPTG to express the fusion protein. Cells from different growth stages were inspected by fluorescence microscopy. Surprisingly, at all growth stages fluorescence was concentrated at the poles of the JS7131(pEH1YidC-GFP) cells, indicating that YidC-GFP is predominantly localized at the poles of the cell (Fig. 4C). As an additional control, other polytopic IMPs were fused to GFP and expressed at physiological levels. In contrast to YidC-GFP, fluorescence of all tested IMPs was distributed uniformly over the inner membrane (data not shown), indicating that the localization of YidC-GFP is specific for YidC and not an artifact caused by the fusion to GFP. So far, the biogenesis of E. coli IMPs has been studied using only a very limited set of model IMPs (1.de Gier J.-W. Luirink J. Mol. Microbiol. 2001; 40: 314-322Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Among these model IMPs there are hardly any complex polytopic IMPs. Here we analyze the biogenesis of YidC, a polytopic IMP that has recently attracted attention as a factor that might play a key role in the membrane integration and assembly of E. coli IMPs (7.Scotti P.A. Urbanus M.L. Brunner J. de Gier J.W. von Heijne G. van der Does C. Driessen A.J. Oudega B. Luirink J. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 542-549Crossref PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar, 9.Samuelson J.C. Chen M.Y. Jiang F.L. Möller I. Wiedmann M. Kuhn A. Phillips G.J. Dalbey R.E. Nature. 2000; 406: 637-641Crossref PubMed Scopus (423) Google Scholar). Using a combined in vitro and in vivo approach we provide evidence that the polytopic IMP YidC follows the SRP/Sec-translocon/YidC pathway for its membrane integration. In addition, we show that YidC is predominantly localized at the cell poles with an abundance of ∼2500–3000 copies per cell. Recently, we have analyzed the pathway of targeting and membrane insertion of the bitopic model IMP FtsQ by studying the sequential interactions of nascent FtsQ in the cytosol and membrane in an in vitro photocross-linking assay. This revealed a sequential interaction of the TM, first with SecY and then with YidC (8.Urbanus M.L. Scotti P.A. Fröderberg L. Sääf A. de Gier J.-W. Brunner J. Samuelson J.C. Dalbey R.E. Oudega B. Luirink J. EMBO Rep. 2001; 6: 524-529Crossref Scopus (154) Google Scholar). The most prominent SecY interaction was found when the TM was only partially exposed outside of the ribosome, whereas the strongest YidC interaction was found when the TM and ∼25–30 residues of the periplasmic domain were exposed outside the ribosome. In this study, two YidC constructs were used (52YidC and 96YidC) that resemble these two FtsQ constructs with respect to the distance between the ribosome and the TM and carry a photocross-linking probe in the exposed TM1 region (Fig. 1A). In contrast to FtsQ, the cross-linking to YidC appears rather complex. The early interaction of nascent YidC with SecY that is almost absent in the longer construct is comparable with the transient interaction of nascent FtsQ with SecY. Different from FbQ are the early interactions with pre-existing YidC and SecA that both persist and even increase in the longer construct. This might indicate that YidC inserts close to SecY/SecA/YidC in a flexible environment that is shielded from water given the sensitivity of the cross-linking probe to quenching by water. The mechanism of membrane insertion of polytopic IMPs may not be generic. The sugar co-transporter melibiose permease has been claimed (26.Bassilana M. Gwizdek C. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 5202-5208Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar) to insert completely independently from the Sec machinery, whereas mannitol permease inserts at SecYE but does not require SecA nor SecG (27.Koch H.-G. Hengelage T. Neumann-Haefelin C. MacFarlane J. Hoffschulte H.K. Schimz K.-L. Mechler B. Müller M. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 2163-2173Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar, 28.Koch H.G. Müller M. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 150: 689-694Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). It has been suggested that SecA only plays a role in the translocation of large periplasmic loops that are not present in mannitol permease (29.Neumann-Haefelin C. Schäfer U. Müller M. Koch H.G. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 6419-6426Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). YidC does contain a large periplasmic loop between TM1 and TM2, which might explain its dependence on SecA (Ref.12.Sääf A. Monne M. de Gier J.-W. von Heijne G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 30415-30418Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar and this study). Remarkably, SecA is cross-linked to TM1 in 52YidC, which does not expose any periplasmic sequence. It remains to be determined how the future requirement for SecA is sensed in such short nascent chains. Interestingly, the absence of SecG strongly affected YidC assembly, whereas the deletion of SecG only affects protein secretion at low temperatures (19.Nishiyama K. Hanada M. Tokuda H. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 3272-3277Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar), and SecG has not previously been implicated in membrane protein assembly. The effect on YidC assembly may be related to the proposed function of SecG in the modulation of the SecA cycle of membrane insertion and deinsertion (31.Nishiyama K.I. Suzuki T. Tokuda H. Cell. 1996; 85: 71-81Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). Alternatively, SecG may be specifically involved in connecting YidC to the core SecYE translocon thus indirectly influencing YidC assembly. Apparently, YidC inserts via the SRP/Sec-translocon/YidC pathway. In contrast, the mitochondrial YidC homologue Oxa1p assembles solely at Oxa1p itself in the absence of SRP and Sec homologues (32.Hell K. Herrmann J.M. Pratje E. Neupert W. Stuart R.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 2250-2255Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). This may be related to the different topology of Oxa1p, which lacks the first TM of YidC (4.Luirink J. Samuelsson T. de Gier J.-W. FEBS Lett. 2001; 1: 1-5Crossref Scopus (122) Google Scholar). In the cytosolic fraction 52YidC is cross-linked to both SRP (consistent with the in vivo dependence on SRP) and TF. This confirms the very early interaction of TF with nascent chains as observed previously for PhoE (23.Valent Q.A. de Gier J.-W. van Heijne G. Kendall D.A. ten Hagen-Jongman C.M. Oudega B. Luirink J. Mol. Microbiol. 1997; 25: 53-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). It has been suggested that TF specifically interacts with the early mature region of secretory proteins to prevent interaction with the SRP and funnel the proteins into the SecB/SecA targeting route (33.Beck K. Wu L.F. Brunner J. Müller M. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 134-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). Our observations are not consistent with a restricted role for TF in secretion. Apparently, TF is well able to interact with the TM sequence of a nascent IMP. We propose that TF is juxtaposed to all nascent sequences near the ribosome exit site, whereas SRP displaces TF when the exposed region is of sufficient hydrophobicity (Ref. 34.Lee H.C. Bernstein H.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 6: 3471-3476Google Scholar and this study). Surprisingly, the E. coli strain MC4100 contains ∼2500–3000 copies of YidC per cell. The core translocon components SecY and SecE occur with ∼300–600 and 200–400 copies per cell, respectively (30.Driessen A.J.M. J. Membr. Biol. 1994; 142: 145-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Components of the accessory complex SecDFYajC are even less abundant with ∼30–100 copies per cell (30.Driessen A.J.M. J. Membr. Biol. 1994; 142: 145-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Assuming that SecYEG tetramers form functional translocation units, a cell contains ∼100–200 functional translocons. Hence, YidC appears to be in excess, arguing against an exclusive association with the SecYEG translocon even when YidC would be dimeric (13.van der Laan M. Houben E.N.G. Nouwen N. Luirink J. Driessen A.J.M. EMBO Rep. 2001; 21: 519-523Crossref Scopus (95) Google Scholar). This may be related to the dual function of YidC: in conjunction with the Sec-translocon and as a separate entity. YidC is a bona fide IMP spanning the membrane six times with short cytoplasmic N and C termini (12.Sääf A. Monne M. de Gier J.-W. von Heijne G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 30415-30418Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Intriguingly, fusion of the C terminus to GFP did not affect the functioning of YidC and revealed a predominant localization at the poles of the E. coli cell. At present it is too early to speculate whether the cell poles function as dedicated IMP insertion sites perhaps related to the high membrane curvature in this region. We will investigate whether other Sec-translocon components colocalize with YidC at the cell poles using the GFP-tagging and Fluorescence Resonance Energy Transfer technology. We thank C. M. ten Hagen-Jongman for technical support."

Homologs of the six yeast MCM genes were subsequently identified in various other eukaryotic organisms, from Drosophila melanogaster to Homo sapiens and found to code for proteins (ranging in length from 776 to 1017 amino acidic residues), which are evolutionarily conserved especially in the central third of their polypeptide chain (3.Kearsey S.E. Labib K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1398: 113-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar, 4.Tye B.K. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1999; 68: 649-686Crossref PubMed Scopus (515) Google Scholar). In fact, this region contains the four sequence motifs typically found in DNA helicases, including the Walker A and B boxes that are critical for nucleotide binding and hydrolysis (5.Neuwald A.L.A. Spouge J. Koonin E.V. Genome Res. 1999; 9: 27-43Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The MCM proteins are relatively abundant in proliferating cells and were purified from cell extracts of various organisms either as hetero-hexameric complexes containing all six polypeptides or as sub-assemblies of various subunit composition (such as MCM 2/4/6/7 and MCM 4/6/7 (6.Thommes P.

However, among all these multimeric complexes only the MCM 4/6/7 hexamer was demonstrated to have a weak and non-processive DNA helicase activity (11.Ishimi Y. J. Biol.

The MCM 4/6/7 complex is dis-assembled in vitro upon addition of MCM 2 or MCM 3/5, and this causes inhibition of its DNA unwinding activity (13.Lee J.K. Hurwitz J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 18871-18878Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar, 14.Ishimi Y. Komamura Y. You Z. Kimura H. J. Biol.

Based on these findings, it was proposed that the MCM 4/6/7 assembly could act as DNA unwinding factor at the replication origins, whereas the other MCM subunits could play regulatory functions. However, due to the limited processivity of their DNA unwinding activity the MCM proteins were considered poor candidates for the helicase associated with the DNA replication fork. In addition, several genetic studies have evidenced that the MCM proteins in vivo could interact with the Origin Recognition Complex, Cdc6, Cdc45, and Cdc7/Dbf4 kinase (15.Tanaka T. Knapp D.

Furthermore, an important clue to the in vivo function of the MCM proteins derived from the recent biochemical characterization of the single MCM homolog from the euryarchaeon Methanobacterium thermoautotrophicum (Mth MCM).

Chem. 2000; 275: 15049-15059Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). These findings reinforced the hypothesis that the MCM proteins may act as the helicase associated to the replication fork, although there is no direct evidence that Mth MCM is required in vivo for chromosome duplication (23.Labib K. Diffley J.F.X. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 2001; 11: 64-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). In addition, these studies once again pointed out that Archaea possess a replication machinery that is in several instances a simplified version of the eukaryotic counterpart and the biochemical characterization of the replication proteins from these peculiar organisms could provide an useful model to elucidate the molecular mechanisms of replication initiation, as well as replisome assembly and progression, in a context devoid of the eukaryotic regulatory complexities (24.Tye B.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 2399-2401Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). The Archaea domain is composed of two subdomains: Euryarchaeotes (including M. thermoautotrophicum and Pyrococcus species) and Crenarchaeotes (including Sulfolobus solfataricus and Aeropyrum pernix (25.Woese C.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 8392-8396Crossref PubMed Scopus (435) Google Scholar)). The two groups show important differences at the molecular level: only the euryarchaeal species were found to possess the hetero-dimeric family D DNA polymerase, whereas the Crenarchaeotes are believed to utilize DNA polymerases of the family B as the chromosomal replicases; the Euryarchaeotes have histone-like proteins, whereas the crenarchaeal chromatin contains a different kind of DNA binding protein (26.Bernander R. Trends Microbiol. 2000; 8: 278-283Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). We recently produced in recombinant form and biochemically characterized some putative components of the replisome from the thermoacidophilic crenarchaeon S. solfataricus (27.She Q. Singh R.K. Confalonieri F. Zivanovic Y. Allard G. Awayez M.J. Chan-Weiher C.C. Clausen I.G. Curtis B.A. De Moors A. Erauso G. Fletcher C. Gordon P.M. Heikamp-de Jong I. Jeffries A.C. Kozera C.J. Medina N.

U. S. A. 2001; 98: 7835-7840Crossref PubMed Scopus (672) Google Scholar), including a single-subunit family B DNA polymerase (28.Pisani F.M. Manco G. Carratore V. Rossi M. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 9158-9166Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar), two proliferating cell nuclear antigen-like sliding clamps (29.De Felice M. Sensen C.W. Charlebois R.L. Rossi M. Pisani F.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 291: 47-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar), and a replication factor C-like clamp-loader (30.Pisani F.M. De Felice M. Carpentieri F. Rossi M. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 301: 61-73Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). In addition, a SSB protein from this species (Sso SSB) has been recently identified and characterized (31.Wadsworth R.I.M. White F.M. Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: 914-920Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). The Sso SSB (16,184 Da) is an abundant protein that exists as a monomer in solution and multimerizes upon DNA binding, forming probably tetramers. Each monomer contains a single “OB-fold” (oligonucleotide/oligosaccharide binding fold) and is able to bind 4–5 nucleotides of ssDNA. Herein we report the biochemical characterization of the single MCM homolog from the crenarchaeon S. solfataricus(Sso MCM). This protein forms hexamers in solution and has ATPase and DNA helicase activity. This latter preferentially melts 5′-tailed oligonucleotides and is stimulated by the Sso SSB. In addition, we demonstrated that Sso MCM and Sso SSB physically interact each other. These findings provide the first direct biochemical evidence that a MCM complex functionally and physically interacts with another replication factor and have implications for other MCM proteins from higher organisms including humans. All chemicals were of reagent grade. Restriction and modification enzymes were from Roche Molecular Biochemicals. Radioactive nucleotides were purchased from Amersham Biosciences, Inc. Oligonucleotides were synthesized by Primm (Milan, Italy). The anti-SsoMCM rabbit antiserum was kindly provided by Dr. Stephen D. Bell (Cambridge, United Kingdom). The Escherichia coli expression vector pET19b-SsoMCM was constructed by Dr. M. F. White (Saint Andrews, United Kingdom). This plasmid harbors the Sso MCM gene cloned between the NcoI and BamHI restriction sites of the polylinker. The Sso MCM was mutated at lysine 346 to alanine by PCR-based mutagenesis (32.Ho S.N. Hunt D.H. Horton R.M. Pullen J.K. Pease L.R. Gene. 1989; 77: 51-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (6849) Google Scholar) using the following synthetic oligonucleotides: MCM-Kpn-for (5′-ACCAGAAGAGGTACCCTCAGGTCAGTTACC-3′), MCM-Spe-rev (AGATTCTTAGCCTCACTAGTAATTTTTGGT), MCM-K346A-for (AATAGGTGATCCCGGTACTGCCGCATCACAAATGCTACAGTTTAT), MCM-K346A-rev (ATAAACTGTAGCATTTGTGATGCGGCAGTACCGGGATCACCTATT). The final PCR product was subcloned back into the SsoMCM-pET19b vector at the unique KpnI and SpeI sites present in the Sso MCM sequence. The presence of the desired mutation was checked by sequencing the KpnI-SpeI amplified DNA fragment. This allowed us to rule out the presence of additional mutations in this construction. The E. coli plasmid pET19b-SsoSSB expressing the recombinant S. solfataricus SSB was a generous gift of Dr. M. F. White (Saint Andrews, United Kingdom (31.Wadsworth R.I.M. White F.M. Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: 914-920Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar)). E. coliBL21-CodonPlus(DE3)-RIL cells (Novagen) transformed with the plasmid pET19b-SsoMCM were grown at 37 °C in 2 liters of LB medium containing 100 μg/ml ampicillin and 100 μg/ml chloramphenicol. When the culture reached an A600 nm of 1 OD, protein expression was induced by addition of isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside to 0.2 mm. The bacterial culture was incubated at 37 °C for an additional 1.5 h. Then cells were harvested by centrifugation, and the pellet was stored at −20 °C until use. The pellet was thawed and resuspended in 30 ml of buffer A (25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.0, 2.5 mm MgCl2) supplemented with some protease inhibitors (50 μg/ml phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.2 μg/ml benzamidine, 1 μg/ml aprotinin). Cells were broken by two consecutive passages through a French pressure cell apparatus (Aminco Co., Silver Spring, MD) at 2000 p.s.i. The resulting lysate was centrifuged for 30 min at 30,000 rpm (Sorvall rotor 50.2 Ti) at 10 °C. The supernatant was subjected to heat treatment at 80 °C for 10 min, then incubated in ice for 10 min. The thermoprecipitated proteins were removed by centrifugation for 30 min at 30,000 rpm (Sorvall rotor 50,2 Ti) at 10 °C. The supernatant was passed through a 0.45-μm filter and loaded onto a Heparin Sepharose™ column (vol: 10 ml) pre-equilibrated in buffer A. After a washing step in buffer A, elution was carried out with 200 ml of a 0–1 mNaCl linear gradient in buffer A. 2.5-ml fractions were collected and analyzed by SDS-PAGE to detect the Sso MCM. Fractions containing the recombinant protein were pooled, and the pool was dialyzed overnight against buffer B (25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.5, 2.5 mm MgCl2, 50 mm NaCl). The dialyzed sample was then loaded onto a MonoQ HR 10/10 column pre-equilibrated in buffer B. A linear gradient from 0.05 to 1m NaCl in buffer B (volume, 80 ml) was applied to elute the protein. 1-ml fractions were collected and analyzed by SDS-PAGE to detect the Sso MCM. The peak fractions were pooled, concentrated using a Centricon 10 system (Millipore), and dialyzed overnight against buffer C (25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.09, 2.5 mm MgCl2, 100 mm NaCl). The dialyzed sample was aliquoted and stored at −20 °C. The final yield of the recombinant protein after this purification procedure was of about 30 mg. The K346A mutant Sso MCM was purified using the above protocol. The recombinant Sso SSB was purified as described (31.Wadsworth R.I.M. White F.M. Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: 914-920Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Samples of the purified Sso MCM (263 μg in 50 μl) were subjected to analytical gel filtration chromatography on a Superdex 200 HR 26/30 fast protein liquid chromatography column (Amersham Biosciences, Inc.) equilibrated with buffer 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 20 mmMgCl2, 200 mm NaCl. The column was run at 0.25 ml/min at room temperature. 1-ml fractions were collected and analyzed by SDS-PAGE. Two sets of globular protein standards were run in the same conditions as the experiment. The first set included tyroglobulin (670 kDa), catalase (232 kDa), BSA (67 kDa). The second set included ferritin (440 kDa), aldolase (158 kDa), and ovalbumin (43 kDa). Samples of the purified Sso MCM (263 μg in 50 μl) were injected into a Superose 6 HR 10/30 fast protein liquid chromatography column (Amersham Biosciences, Inc.), equilibrated in 50 mmTris-HCl, pH 8.0, 10 mm MgCl2, 100 mm NaCl. The chromatographic run was carried out at a flow rate of 0.25 ml/min at room temperature. The column was calibrated by running a set of gel filtration markers that included tyroglobulin (670 kDa), ferritin (440 kDa), and BSA (67 kDa). A sample of the purified Sso MCM (186 μg in 100 μl) was applied to a 5-ml 15–35% glycerol gradient in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 10 mm MgCl2, 100 mm NaCl. After centrifugation at 48,000 rpm for 15 h and 20 min in a Beckman SW 65 rotor at 10 °C, fractions (250 μl) were collected from the bottom of the tube. The distribution of the Sso MCM protein was detected after SDS/10% PAGE and staining with Coomassie Brilliant Blue (R-250). A mixture of protein markers (tyroglobulin, 670 kDa; ferritin, 440 kDa; BSA, 67 kDa) was applied to a parallel gradient. Standard ATPase assay reaction mixture (10 μl) contained 25 mm Hepes-NaOH, pH 7.5, 5 mmMgCl2, 50 mm sodium acetate, 2.5 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, 100 μm[γ-32P]ATP (0.5–1 μCi). Incubations were performed for 1 h at 60 °C in a heated-top PCR machine to prevent evaporation and stopped in ice. A 1-μl aliquot of each mixture was spotted onto a polyethyleneimine-cellulose thin layer plate (Merck), pre-run with 1 m formic acid and developed in 0.5m LiCl, 1 m formic acid. The amounts of [γ-32P]ATP hydrolyzed to [32P]orthophosphate were quantitated using a PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics, Inc.). The rate of ATP hydrolysis was determined in the linear range of reaction time and protein concentration dependence. The amount of spontaneously hydrolyzed ATP was determined using blank reactions without enzyme and subtracted from the reaction rate values calculated as above. Three DNA oligomers were synthesized and used for the preparation of helicase substrates. These included the following: a 55-mer (5′-CTTGCATGCCTGCAGGTCGACTCTAGAGGATCCCCGGGTACCGAGCTCGAATTCG-3′), which was fully complementary to the M13mp18(+) strand; a 64-mer (5′-TCACTTCTACTTGCATGCCTGCAGGTCGACTCTAGAGGATCCCCGGGTACCGAGCTCGAATTCG-3′), which had a 9-nt 5′-tail (the tail is underlined) not complementary to the M13mp18(+) strand; an 85-mer (5′-TTGAACCACCCCCTTGTTAAATCACTTCTACTTGCATGCCTGCAGGTCGACTCTAGAGGATCCCCGGGTACCGAGCTCGAATTCG), which had a 30-nt 5′-tail (the tail is underlined) not complementary to the M13mp18(+) strand. The oligonucleotides were labeled with [γ-32P]ATP and T4 polynucleotide kinase, and, after the labeling reaction, they were purified using Quantum Prep PCR Kleen Spin columns (Bio-Rad Laboratories), according to the manufacturer's instructions. To prepare partial duplexes, DNA molecules and mixtures containing equal molar amounts of each oligonucleotide and the M13mp18(+) strand were incubated for 5 min at 95 °C and then slowly cooled at room temperature. Helicase assay reaction mixtures (20 μl) contained 25 mm Hepes-NaOH, pH 7.5, 5 mm MgCl2, 50 mm sodium acetate, 2.5 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, 5 mm ATP, 50 fmol of32P-labeled substrate (about 1 × 103cpm/fmol). The reactions were incubated for 30 min at 70 °C in a heated-top PCR machine to prevent evaporation and stopped by addition of 5 μl of 5× stop solution (0.5% SDS, 40 mm EDTA, 0.5 mg/ml proteinase K, 20% glycerol, 0.1% bromphenol blue), then run on a 8% polyacrylamide gel in TBE containing 0.1% SDS at constant voltage of 150 V. After the electrophoresis the gel was soaked in 20% trichloroacetic acid and analyzed by means of a PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics, Inc.). The reaction products were quantitated, and any free oligonucleotide in the absence of enzyme was subtracted. The Sso SSB was diluted to a concentration of 1.4 ng/μl in carbonate buffer (16 mmNa2CO3, 34 mm NaHCO3, pH 9.6). This solution containing the Sso SSB was then added to the appropriate wells of a 96-well ELISA plate (100 μl/well) and allowed to incubate for 2 h at room temperature. For control experiments, BSA was substituted for the Sso SSB in the coating step. Wells were then aspirated and washed three times with wash Buffer (PBS, 0.5% Tween 20). Blocking buffer (PBS, 0.5% Tween 20, 3% BSA) was added to appropriate wells and allowed to incubate at room temperature. Wells were aspirated and washed one time with blocking buffer. The Sso MCM was diluted to 1.8 ng/μl in binding buffer (25 mm Hepes-NaOH, pH 7.5, 50 mmNaCl, 2.5 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, 5 mmMgCl2). The diluted Sso MCM was then added to appropriate wells of the ELISA plate (100 μl/well) and allowed to incubate for 30 min at room temperature. Wells were aspirated and washed three times with binding buffer. Primary antibody (rabbit polyclonal antiserum against the Sso MCM protein) was diluted 1:2000 in blocking buffer, added to appropriate wells, and allowed to incubate overnight at 4 °C. Wells were then aspirated and washed four times with blocking buffer. Secondary antibody (goat anti-rabbit IgG-horseradish peroxidase) was diluted 1:3000 in conjugate buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 0.05% Tween 20, 1% BSA), added to appropriate wells, and allowed to incubate 30 min at room temperature. Wells were aspirated and washed five times with conjugate buffer. Complexes were detected using a colorimetric reaction with o-phenylenediamine dihydrochloride (Sigma Chemical Co.). The reaction was terminated after 1 min with 2.5 m sulfuric acid. Absorbance readings were taken at 490 nm. The A490 values, corrected for background signal in the presence of BSA, are expressed as the mean of three independent determinations. Far Western blotting analysis was conducted as described by Wu et al. (33.Wu L. Davies S.L. North P.S. Goulaouic H. Riou J.F. Turley H. Gatter K.C. Hickson I.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 9636-9646Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar). Each polypeptide was subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane (Schleicher and Schuell). All subsequent steps were performed at 4 °C. Filters were immersed twice in denaturation buffer (6 m guanidine-HCl in TBS) for 10 min followed by six times for 10 min in serial dilutions (1:1) of denaturation buffer supplemented with 1 mm dithiothreitol. Filters were blocked in TBS containing 3% BSA, 0.3% Tween 20 for 30 min before being incubated in the Sso MCM (6 μg/ml) in TBS supplemented with 0.1% BSA, 0.3% Tween 20, 1 mmdithiothreitol overnight at 4 °C. Filters were washed four times for 10 min in TBS containing 0.3% Tween 20, 0.1% BSA. The second wash contained 0.0001% glutaraldehyde. Conventional Western analysis was then performed to detect the presence of the Sso MCM using rabbit polyclonal antiserum against the Sso MCM as primary antibody. Anti-rabbit IgG-horseradish peroxidase conjugate was used as secondary antibody and detected by a colorimetric reaction. The analysis of the S. solfataricus genomic sequence revealed the presence of a single open reading frame coding for a putative homolog of the eukaryotic MCM proteins (Sso MCM (27.She Q. Singh R.K.

Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 4673-4680Crossref PubMed Scopus (55958) Google Scholar) we aligned the sequence of the single MCM protein from the Archaea S. solfataricus, A. pernix (Ape MCM), and M. thermoautotrophicum (Mth MCM), and the sequence of the MCM 4 protein from the eukaryotes H. sapiens(Hsa MCM) and Schizosaccharomyces pombe(Spo MCM) and found that the Sso MCM is 48, 43, 33, and 34% identical to Ape, Mth, Hsa, and Spo MCM, respectively. As schematically depicted in Fig. 1, the SsoMCM lacks the N-terminal extension of about 160 amino acidic residues found in the eukaryotic counterparts, and it is devoid of the cyclin-dependent kinase phosphorylation sites that are clustered in the N-terminal region of the eukaryotic MCM 4, as also found in the Ape and Mth MCM (3.Kearsey S.E.

On the other hand, the core region of the archaeal and eukaryal sequences shows a higher level of similarity, because it contains the four amino acidic motifs typically found in the DNA helicases (35.Koonin E.V. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 2541-2547Crossref PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar). As evidenced in Fig. 1, the sequence boxes A and B correspond to the Walker A and B motifs that are responsible for nucleotide binding and hydrolysis, respectively, in the large family of ATPases associated with a variety of cellular activities (AAA+ super-family (5.Neuwald A.L.A. Spouge J. Koonin E.V. Genome Res. 1999; 9: 27-43Crossref PubMed Google Scholar)). In addition, the Sulfolobus and Aeropyrum MCM sequences seem to contain a zinc finger of the His-Cys3type, whereas the MCM proteins from eukaryotic organisms (3.Kearsey S.E. Labib K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1398: 113-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar, 4.Tye B.K. Annu. Rev.

Chem. 2001; 276: 49371-49377Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar) possess a zinc finger of the Cys4 type. The gene encoding the Sso MCM was produced in E. coli using the pET19b plasmid vector. The recombinant protein was found to be expressed at high level in soluble form and was purified by a procedure that included a thermal treatment of the cell extracts and chromatographic steps on heparin-Sepharose and MonoQ columns, as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The purified Sso MCM migrated as a Coomassie Blue-stained protein band of the predicted size (77 kDa) in a 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel (see Fig. 2A). An additional tiny band of about 60 kDa is observed in the sample collected from the MonoQ column. N-terminal sequence analyses after electrotransfer onto a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane revealed that the 77-kDa polypeptide corresponds to the Sso MCM, whereas the 60-kDa band is a C-terminally truncated proteolytic fragment of the intact protein. 2F. Carpentieri et al., unpublished observations. To assess the oligomeric state of the recombinant Sso MCM, we carried out gel filtration experiments onto two columns: a Superose 62 and a Superdex 200 (Fig. 2, B and C). By either experiment we estimated a molecular mass of about 470 kDa for the Sso MCM and hypothesized that it could form hexamers in solution. However, as shown in Fig. 2B, the peak eluted from the Superdex 200 column was quite broad and a portion of the protein was detected in fractions that corresponded to a molecular mass of about 75 kDa, as expected for the monomeric form of the Sso MCM. This result suggested that the SsoMCM could exist in equilibrium between an hexameric and a monomeric state. Consistent results were obtained also by glycerol gradient centrifugation experiments: as shown in Fig. 2D, the Sso MCM was detected by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis in the fractions from 8 to 13 of the gradient indicating that the protein assembles into hexamers that dissociate into monomers. The oligomeric state of the Sso MCM was not found to be affected by addition of ATP (at 100 μm) in the buffer used to prepare the gradient or by preincubating the protein sample with forked double- or single-stranded DNA molecules before starting the ultracentrifugation.2 As shown in Fig. 1, Walker A and B motifs are present in the primary"
https://openalex.org/W1965436228,"HemAT-Bs is a heme-containing signal transducer protein responsible for aerotaxis of Bacillus subtilis. The recombinant HemAT-Bs expressed in Escherichia coli was purified as the oxy form in which oxygen was bound to the ferrous heme. Oxygen binding and dissociation rate constants were determined to bekon = 32 μm−1s−1 and koff = 23 s−1, respectively, revealing that HemAT-Bs has a moderate oxygen affinity similar to that of sperm whale myoglobin (Mb). The rate constant for autoxidation at 37 °C was 0.06 h−1, which is also close to that of Mb. Although the electronic absorption spectra of HemAT-Bs were similar to those of Mb, HemAT-Bs showed some unique characteristics in its resonance Raman spectra. Oxygen-bound HemAT-Bs gave the νFe-O2band at a noticeably low frequency (560 cm−1), which suggests a unique hydrogen bonding between a distal amino acid residue and the proximal atom of the bound oxygen molecule. Deoxy HemAT-Bs gave the νFe-His band at a higher frequency (225 cm−1) than those of ordinary His-coordinated deoxy heme proteins. CO-bound HemAT-Bs gave the νFe-CO and νC-O bands at 494 and 1964 cm−1, respectively, which fall on the same νC-Oversus νFe-CO correlation line as that of Mb.

HemAT-Bs and HemAT-Hs are soluble proteins, and their C-terminal regions, residues 222–489 of HemAT-Hs and 198–432 of HemAT-Bs, are 30% identical to the cytoplasmic signaling domain of Tsr, an MCP from Escherichia coli (9.Hou S.

Their N-terminal regions, residues 1–184 in HemAT-Hs and 1–175 in HemAT-Bs, show limited homology to myoglobin (9.Hou S. Larsen R.W. Boudko D. Riley C.W. Karatan E. Zimmer M. Ordal G.W. Alam M.

Recombinant HemAT-Bs and HemAT-Hs are hemoproteins containing a b-type heme as a prosthetic group and show similar electronic absorption spectra to those of myoglobin (9.Hou S. Larsen R.W. Boudko D.

The residues 1–195 for HemAT-Hs and 1–176 in HemAT-Bs retain the heme- and oxygen-binding properties of the respective native proteins, which represent a globin-coupled sensor motif (10.Hou S.

These results suggest that the heme in HemAT acts as an oxygen sensor and that the binding of oxygen to the heme in HemAT triggers the signal transduction for aerotaxis in B. subtilis and H. salinarum. Sensing gas molecules such as O2, NO, and CO is a novel function of hemoproteins (11.Rodgers K.R. Curr. Opin. Chem. Biol. 1999; 3: 158-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar, 12.Aono S.

Recently, reports on hemoprotein sensors in which a heme prosthetic group acts as a sensor for a gas molecule such as O2, NO, or CO are on the increase. FixL (15.Gilles-Gonzalez M.A. Ditta G.S.

In these sensor proteins, the binding of O2, NO, or CO to the heme regulates the function of these proteins. The hemes in these sensor proteins play a central role not only for sensing their effector molecules but also for regulating the functional properties with a conformational change induced by the ligand binding. The heme in HemAT is thought to be the active site for sensing O2, and the binding of O2 to the heme will be responsible for triggering the aerotaxis signal transduction. Therefore, the elucidation for the coordination structure of the heme, especially in the O2-bound form and for the interaction between the bound O2 and the heme pocket, are required to understand the mechanism of the O2 sensing and signal transduction for HemAT. Although the electronic absorption spectra of HemAT-Hs and HemAT-Bs are reported (9.Hou S. Larsen R.W. Boudko D. Riley C.W. Karatan E. Zimmer M. Ordal G.W. Alam M. Nature. 2000; 403: 540-544Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar), very little information is available for the structure and ligand binding properties of the heme in HemAT. In this work, we present results of the kinetic analysis for oxygen binding with HemAT-Bs, autoxidation kinetics of oxygen-bound HemAT-Bs, and resonance Raman measurements with the deoxy, oxy, and CO-bound forms of HemAT-Bs. Using resonance Raman spectroscopy, we show a unique heme environment for HemAT-Bs. An expression vector for HemAT-Bs was constructed as follows. ThehemAT-Bs gene was prepared by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) with the chromosomal DNA of B. subtilis and the two synthetic deoxyoligonucleotides (5′-gaaggagatccatatgttatttaaaaaagacagaaaacaagaaacagc-3′ and 5′-ggatcccatatgttattattcttctgtcaggatgacaagcgaatcaacgg-3′ for the sense and antisense primers, respectively) as the template and primers, respectively. Although the original translational initiation codon for HemAT-Bs is TTG in B. subtilis (9.Hou S. Larsen R.W. Boudko D. Riley C.W. Karatan E. Zimmer M. Ordal G.W. Alam M. Nature. 2000; 403: 540-544Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar), the translational initiation codon was changed to ATG in the sense primer, which is underlined in the above sequence. The PCR product was cloned into a pCR4-TOPO vector with the TOPO TA cloning kit (Invitrogen). The plasmid containing the hemAT-Bs gene with the correct direction relative to the lac promoter was selected as an expression vector for HemAT-Bs and named pCR-HemAT. E. coli JM109 was used as a host for the expression of HemAT-Bs. pCR-HemAT/E. coli JM109 was grown in LB medium containing 50 μg/ml ampicillin at 37 °C. The expression of HemAT-Bs was induced by 1 mmisopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside. The cultivation was continued at 25 °C for 12 h after adding isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside. The cells were harvested by centrifugation and stored at −80 °C until use. Purification of the recombinant HemAT-Bs was carried out as follows. The cells were resuspended in 50 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 8.5, containing 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and disrupted by sonication. After unbroken cells and cell debris were removed by centrifugation, the supernatant was applied to a column (2.6 × 30 cm) of Q-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences, Inc.) equilibrated with 50 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 8.5. The adsorbed proteins were eluted by a linear gradient of NaCl from 0 to 0.6 m at a flow rate of 1 ml/min after washing the column with a 4-bed volume of 50 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 8.5. The fractions containing HemAT-Bs were combined and applied to a column (1.6 × 30 cm) of hydroxylapatite (Seikagaku Co.) equilibrated with 50 mmTris-HCl containing 1 m KCl, pH 8.5. The adsorbed proteins were eluted at a flow rate of 1 ml/min by increasing linearly the concentration of K2HPO4 in the elution buffer from 0 to 0.3 m. The fractions containing HemAT-Bs were combined and concentrated by a Centricon 50 (Amicon). The concentrated sample was applied to a column (1.6 × 80 cm) of Superdex 200 pg (Amersham Biosciences, Inc.) equilibrated with 50 mmTris-HCl buffer containing 0.1 m NaCl, pH 8.5. The column was run at 0.2 ml/min using 50 mm Tris-HCl buffer containing 0.1 m NaCl, pH 8.5, as an elution buffer. 1–2 mg of purified HemAT-Bs was obtained from approximately 10 g of wet cells of pCR-HemAT/E. coli JM109. The reduction of HemAT-Bs was carried out by adding a few grains of sodium dithionite into the isolated HemAT-Bs. CO gas was introduced into HemAT-Bs solution by a gas-tight syringe. The type of the heme in HemAT-Bs was determined by the pyridine ferrohemochrome method. The value of 34 mm−1cm−1 at the absorption maximum of the α band for the pyridine ferrohemochrome derived from the protoheme was used to calculate the concentration of the heme in HemAT-Bs. Protein concentration was determined by the Coomassie Protein Assay Reagent (Pierce) or the Advanced Protein Assay Reagent (Cytoskeleton Inc.) using bovine serum albumin as a standard. The molecular mass of HemAT-Bs was determined by gel filtration, using a Superdex 200-pg gel filtration column (1.6 × 80 cm). The system was calibrated with β-amylase (molecular weight, 200,000), alcohol dehydrogenase (150,000), bovine serum albumin (66,000), carbonic anhydrase (29,000), and cytochrome c (12.Aono S. Nakajima H. Coord. Chem. Rev. 1999; 190–192: 267-282Crossref Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 400), using 50 mm Tris-HCl buffer containing 0.1 m NaCl, pH 8.5, as the eluent. These proteins used in the calibration were obtained from Sigma Chemical Co. The electronic absorption spectra were measured on a Hitachi U-3300 UV-visible spectrophotometer. Resonance Raman spectra were obtained with laser excitation at 413.1 nm by a Kr+ laser (Spectra Physics, model 2016). The excitation light was focused into the cell, and the laser power was 1 milliwatt (mW) at the cell for the oxy and deoxy forms of HemAT-Bs but 0.1 mW for CO-bound HemAT-Bs so as to avoid photolysis of coordinated CO. The sample solutions for the Raman measurements were sealed in quartz cells, which were rotated at 500 rpm at room temperature. Typically, 30 μl of the sample aliquots containing 30 μm protein in 50 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 8.5, were put into the cell. The scattered light was dispersed with a single polychromator (Ritsu, DG-1000) equipped with a liquid nitrogen-cooled charge-coupled device camera. The spectral slit width was 6 cm−1. Raman shifts were calibrated using indene and an aqueous solution of potassium ferrocyanide as frequency standards, providing accuracy of ±1 cm−1 for intense isolated lines. The bimolecular on-rate (kon) of oxygen was determined at room temperature after photolysis of oxygen-bound HemAT-Bs, HemAT-Bs(O2), with a 20-ns Nd-YAG laser pulse at 532 nm (Quanta Ray GCR-3). A Xe-lamp (ILC Technology, LX-300) was used as a monitor light source. The transient kinetic curves were observed at 433 nm, which were measured on a digital storage oscilloscope (Tektronix 11401). The off-rate (koff) of oxygen was determined by stopped-flow spectrophotometry (Unisoku USP-526) at room temperature. About 3 μm HemAT-Bs(O2) was mixed with 5 mm sodium dithionite solution in 50 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 8.0, as reported previously (22.Kiger L. Rashid A.K. Griffon N. Haque M. Moens L. Gibson Q.H. Poyart C. Marden M.C. Biophys. J. 1998; 75: 990-998Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). The reaction was followed at 413 nm. The rate of autoxidation of HemAT-Bs(O2) was measured in 50 mm Tris-HCl buffer (pH 8.5) at 37 °C under air. HemAT-Bs(O2) as isolated was maintained in an optical quartz cell with 1-cm optical path length at 37 °C, and spectra were recorded at regular intervals of time with an Hitachi U-3300 UV-visible spectrophotometer. HemAT-Bs was expressed as a soluble hemoprotein in the expression system constructed in this study. A nearly homogeneous HemAT-Bs was obtained by column chromatography described under “Experimental Procedures,” as evident from SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (Fig. 1a). The pyridine ferrohemochrome derived from HemAT-Bs gave the α band at 556 nm (data not shown), which means that HemAT-Bs contains a protoheme (b-type heme) as a prosthetic group. The molecular mass of the purified HemAT-Bs was estimated to be about 188 kDa by gel filtration (Fig. 1b), suggesting that the purified HemAT-Bs is a homo-tetramer of an identical subunit (48.7 kDa). The binding of oxygen to the heme is the first and crucial step of the oxygen sensing and signal transduction by HemAT-Bs. Therefore, elucidation of the oxygen binding properties is essential to understand the functional properties of HemAT-Bs. In this work, the reaction rate constants for oxygen binding and dissociation,kon and koff, were determined by laser-flash photolysis and stopped-flow spectroscopies, respectively. The kon andkoff values for HemAT-Bs thus determined were 32 μm−1 s−1 and 23 s−1, respectively, which were similar to those of sperm whale Mb (Sw Mb) (Table I). HemAT-Bs exhibits a moderate oxygen affinity, similar to that ofSw Mb but different from another oxygen sensor protein FixL. FixL exhibits an extremely low oxygen affinity due to a very lowkon value (kon = 0.14 μm−1 s−1), although thekoff of FixL is comparable to that of HemAT-Bs (Table I).Table IKinetics and equilibrium constants for the reaction of ferrous HemAT-Bs with oxygen compared to those of other hemoproteinsHemoproteins1-aAbbreviations: SwMb, sperm whale myoglobin; Hb, hemoglobin; Mt Hb, M. tuberculosis hemoglobin; Ascaris Hb, Ascaris lumbricoides hemoglobin from body-wall; Leg-Hb, Soybean leghemoglobin; Synechocystis Hb, SynechocystisPCC6803 hemoglobin; Pc Hb, P. caudatumhemoglobin; Bj FixL, Bradyrhizobium japonicumFixL.konkoffKd1-bKd is given by the ratiokoff/kon.Referencesμm−1s−1s−1nmHemAT-Bs321-cExperimental errors are within ±15%.231-cExperimental errors are within ±15%.719This workPcHb30.125.283823.Das T.K.

Open table in a new tab The dissociation equilibrium constant (Kd) given by the ratio koff/kon for HemAT-Bs was 719 nm (Table I), which is comparable to theKm values of terminal oxidases for oxygen respiration. That the Kd value of HemAT-Bs for O2 is comparable to Km values of terminal oxidases seems reasonable from the functional point of view for HemAT-Bs. Because HemAT-Bs acts as an oxygen-sensing signal transducer in aerophilic response of B. subtilis (9.Hou S. Larsen R.W. Boudko D. Riley C.W. Karatan E. Zimmer M. Ordal G.W. Alam M. Nature. 2000; 403: 540-544Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar), it should detect the most suitable oxygen concentration for the bacterium,i.e. that for oxygen respiration. If HemAT-Bs has an extremely high oxygen affinity as do Mt Hb,Asacaris Hb, and Synechocystis Hb (Table I), it would be disadvantageous, because a signal transduction would occur to induce chemotaxis toward a too low concentration of oxygen unsuitable for oxygen respiration. The Kd value of 719 nm for HemAT-Bs, a moderate oxygen affinity, reveals that HemAT-Bs can detect an oxygen concentration suitable for oxygen respiration. HemAT-Bs(O2) as isolated showed a rate constant for autoxidation of 0.06 h−1 at 37 °C, which is similar to that of SwMb (Table II). FixL, another oxygen sensor protein, shows a 20- to 40-fold lager autoxidation rate constant compared with that of HemAT-Bs (29.Gilles-Gonzalez M.A. Gonzalez G. Perutz M.F. Kiger L. Marden M.

Open table in a new tab The electronic absorption spectra of HemAT-Bs are shown in Fig. 2. HemAT-Bs as isolated gave the Soret, α, and β peaks at 414, 578, and 543 nm, respectively, as shown in Fig. 2a. This spectrum is typical of six-coordinate, low spin hemoproteins and resembles that of the oxy form of Mb, as described previously (9.Hou S. Larsen R.W. Boudko D. Riley C.W. Karatan E. Zimmer M. Ordal G.W. Alam M. Nature. 2000; 403: 540-544Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). When CO was reacted with the isolated HemAT-Bs without any reductant, CO-bound HemAT-Bs was formed (data not shown). These results strongly suggest that HemAT-Bs is purified as the oxy form in which O2 is bound to the ferrous heme. Resonance Raman spectroscopy revealed that this was the case, as described below. Upon deoxygenation with sodium dithionite, HemAT-Bs showed a spectrum with the Soret peak at 431 nm and a single peak at 563 nm in the Q-band region, as shown in Fig. 2b. This spectrum is typical of five-coordinate, high spin ferrous hemoproteins, which show the formation of deoxy HemAT-Bs. CO-bound HemAT-Bs was formed upon the reaction of dithionite reduced HemAT-Bs with CO, which showed the Soret, α, and β peaks at 422, 567, and 543 nm, respectively, as shown in Fig. 2c. These electronic absorption spectra of HemAT-Bs were similar to those of Mb as reported previously (9.Hou S. Larsen R.W. Boudko D. Riley C.W. Karatan E. Zimmer M. Ordal G.W. Alam M. Nature. 2000; 403: 540-544Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar), which is consistent with the fact that the N-terminal region of HemAT-Bs shows an amino acid sequence homology to Mb (9.Hou S. Larsen R.W. Boudko D. Riley C.W. Karatan E. Zimmer M. Ordal G.W. Alam M. Nature. 2000; 403: 540-544Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). The values of the absorption maxima observed in this study are slightly different from those reported in Ref. 9.Hou S. Larsen R.W. Boudko D. Riley C.W. Karatan E. Zimmer M. Ordal G.W. Alam M. Nature. 2000; 403: 540-544Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar. Hou et al. have noted from their absorption spectra the presence of a significant population of deoxy species for both the CO- and O2-bound forms of HemAT-Bs (9.Hou S. Larsen R.W. Boudko D. Riley C.W. Karatan E. Zimmer M. Ordal G.W. Alam M. Nature. 2000; 403: 540-544Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). In our preparation of HemAT-Bs, however, such an incomplete ligand binding was not noticed, which was confirmed by resonance Raman spectroscopy as described below. These differences may cause the difference of the absorption maxima, although the reasons of the difference are not clear at present. The heme in HemAT-Bs is thought to play an important role for sensing O2. The ligand conformation, the interaction between the bound O2 and the amino acid residue(s) in the heme pocket, and/or the heme environmental structure will be responsible for triggering the signal transduction upon the O2 binding to the heme in HemAT-Bs. To characterize these properties, we measured the resonance Raman spectra of HemAT-Bs in the oxy, deoxy, and CO-bound forms.

The adducts, formed by either cis or trans epoxide ring opening of each enantiomer of BaP DE-2 by N(2) of dG, were placed at the fourth nucleotide from the 5'-end in two 16-mer sequence contexts, 5' approximately CG*A approximately and 5' approximately GG*T. poleta was remarkably error prone at all four diol epoxide adducts, preferring to misincorporate G and A at frequencies 3- to more than 50-fold greater than the frequencies for T or the correct C, although the highest rates were 60-fold below the rate of incorporation of C opposite a non-adducted G. Anti to syn rotation of the adducted base, consistent with previous NMR data for a BaP DE-2 dG adduct placed just beyond a primer terminus, provides a rationale for preferring purine misincorporation. Extension of purine misincorporations occurred preferentially, but extension beyond the adduct site was weak with V(max)/K(m) values generally 10-fold less than for misincorporation. Mostly A was incorporated opposite (+)-BaP DE-2 dG adducts, which correlates with published observations that G --> T is the most common type of mutation that (+)-BaP DE-2 induces in mammalian cells."
https://openalex.org/W2086831409,"During apical colonization by Salmonella typhimurium, intestinal epithelial cells orchestrate a proinflammatory response that involves secretion of chemoattractants, predominantly interleukin-8, which coordinate neutrophil trans-epithelial migration at the site of infection. This host-pathogen interaction requires several S. typhimurium genes. To identify novel genes that participate in this pathogen-induced proinflammatory response, we created S. typhimurium Tn-10 transposon mutants and identified a single mutant with Tn-10 insertional inactivation within the fliE flagellar locus that was able to adhere to and invade intestinal epithelial cells normally but was unable to induce interleukin-8 secretion in host cells. The fliE-deficient mutant failed to secrete flagellin and lacked any surface assembly of flagellae. Unlike wild-type S. typhimurium, the fliE-deficient mutant did not activate the IκBα/NF-κB signaling pathway or induce the coordinated trans-epithelial migration of isolated human neutrophils. Transcomplementation of the fliE-deficient mutant with a wild-type fliE-harboring plasmid restored all defects and produced a wild-type S. typhimurium phenotype. Furthermore, functional down-regulation of basolateral TLR5 completely inhibited the monolayers' ability to respond to both wild-type S. typhimurium and purified flagellin but had no affect on tumor necrosis factor α-induced responses. We therefore conclude that S. typhimurium fliE is essential for flagellin secretion, flagellar assembly, and S. typhimurium-induced proinflammatory responses through basolateral TLR5 and is consistent with the emerging model of S. typhimurium flagellin-induced inflammation.

As part of its barrier function, the intestinal epithelium is able to detect surface attached enteric pathogens like Salmonella enterica, serovar Typhimurium (S. typhimurium), and orchestrate a proinflammatory response. This multifaceted response involves the rapid secretion of chemoattractants, the development of a chemotactic gradient in the surrounding subepithelial matrix (3.McCormick B.A. Colgan S.P.

The concurrent apical release of a soluble factor, designated PEEC (forpathogen-elicited epithelialchemoattractant), aids in directing the final polymorphonuclear leukocyte (PMN) movement across the epithelial tight junctions into the gut lumen (12.McCormick B.A. Parkos C.A. Colgan S.P. Carnes D.K. Madara J.L. J. Immunol. 1998; 160: 455-466PubMed Google Scholar). In addition to IL-8,1 a variety of other chemokines are secreted in response to S. typhimuriumattachment (13.Eckmann L. Kagnoff M.F. Fierer J. Infect. Immun. 1993; 61: 4569-4574Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 14.Eckmann L. Jung H.C. Schurer-Maly C. Panja A. Morzycka-Wroblewska E. Kagnoff M.F.

Cell. 1995; 80: 529-532Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1217) Google Scholar, 17.Gewirtz A.T. Rao A.S. Simon Jr., P.O. Merlin D. Carnes D. Madara J.L. Neish A.S. J. Clin. Invest. 2000; 105: 79-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). In quiescent cells, the NF-κB heterodimer (p50/p65) is held in a stable, inactive, cytoplasmic complex with IκBα molecules until activated by an as yet undefined Salmonella-stimulated proinflammatory signaling cascade. The IκBα molecule is then phosphorylated and degraded, thus releasing the NF-κB molecule to translocate to the nucleus, bind the IL-8 promoter, and induce transcription of the IL-8 gene (16.Thanos D. Maniatis T. Cell. 1995; 80: 529-532Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1217) Google Scholar). The flagellae of S. typhimurium, like many other motile bacteria, are comprised of the basal body, the hook, and the filament, which is composed mainly of the protein FliC or FljB (dependent on phase variation) (18.Macnab R.M. Neidhardt F.C. Escherichia coli and Salmonella typhimurium. American Society for Microbiology, Washington D. C.1996: 123-145Google Scholar). The assembly of flagellae in Salmonella is similar to the secretion of virulence factors and requires the complex regulation of export machinery across both inner and outer bacterial cell membranes. Thus, it is not surprising that certain components of the secretion system utilized in flagellar biosynthesis are structurally and functionally homologous to components of the type III secretion system used for the export of virulence factors in both S. typhimurium (19.Macnab R.M. J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 7149-7153Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 20.Macnab R.M. ASM News. 2000; 66: 738-745Google Scholar, 21.Galan J.E. Collmer A.

Cell Biol. 1999; 147: 683-693Crossref PubMed Scopus (394) Google Scholar). Additionally, the significant structural and functional similarities between these two secretory systems may indicate that flagellar export machinery is an additional mechanism for secretion of virulence factors from S. typhimurium (23.Komoriya K. Shibano N. Higano T. Azuma N. Yamaguchi S. Aizawa S.I. Mol. Microbiol. 1999; 34: 767-779Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar) and other pathogens (24.Young G.M. Schmiel D.H. Miller V.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 6456-6461Crossref PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar). Recently, interest has been focused on Salmonella flagellin and its role in the induction of host proinflammatory responses. Studies have demonstrated that purified flagellin can induce proinflammatory mediators in epithelial cells (25.Eaves-Pyles T. Murthy K. Liaudet L. Virag L. Ross G. Soriano F.G. Szabo C. Salzman A.L. J. Immunol. 2001; 166: 1248-1260Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar) and must be translocated across the epithelial monolayer to the basolateral surface for these responses to occur (26.Gewirtz A.T. Simon Jr., P.O. Schmitt C.K. Taylor L.J. Hagedorn C.H. O'Brien A.D. Neish A.S. Madara J.L. J. Clin. Invest. 2001; 107: 99-109Crossref PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar). Additionally, flagellin has been shown to interact with the basolateral Toll-like receptor 5 (TLR5) on human intestinal epithelial cells (27.Gewirtz A.T. Navas T.A. Lyons S. Godowski P.J. Madara J.L. J. Immunol. 2001; 167: 1882-1885Crossref PubMed Scopus (1081) Google Scholar) and can induce systemic responses in mice that require the cytosolic adaptor protein Myd88 (28.Hayashi F. Smith K.D. Ozinsky A. Hawn T.R. Yi E.C. Goodlett D.R. Eng J.K. Akira S. Underhill D.M. Aderem A. Nature. 2001; 410: 1099-1103Crossref PubMed Scopus (2837) Google Scholar). Here we demonstrate that a Salmonella mutant in which the fliE gene has been disrupted by a Tn-10 transposon insertion (29.Kleckner N. Berg D.E. Howe M.M. Mobile DNA. American Society for Microbiology, Washington, D. C.1989Google Scholar) retains the ability to interact with intestinal epithelial cell apical membranes, but such interactions are nonproductive in terms of signaling epithelia to initiate proinflammatory signaling cascades. Disruption of fliE results in Salmonella mutants that are unable to secrete flagellin or assemble flagellae. Complementation of the fliE mutant strain with a plasmid containing wild-type fliE results in recovery of a wild-type Salmonella phenotype. We have also established for the first time that TLR5 is expressed exclusively on the basolateral membrane of Madin-Darby canine kidney cells and is functionally down-regulated by preincubation with purified flagellin. This TLR5 functional down-regulation results in monolayers that are insensitive to both flagellin and wild-type Salmonella colonization but does not affect TNFα-stimulated IL-8 secretion. Taken together, we have demonstrated that the S. typhimurium fliE gene is required for secretion of flagellin, flagellar assembly, and the initiation of proinflammatory responses in host cells. Additionally, we have shown that these proinflammatory responses are initiated through flagellin-TLR5 interactions at the basolateral surface. Human model intestinal epithelial cells (T84, passages 50–65) were grown and maintained as confluent monolayers on collagen-coated permeable supports (30.Dharmsathaphorn K. Madara J.L. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 192: 354-389Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar), with recent modifications (31.Madara J.L. Parkos C. Colgan S. MacLeod R.J. Nash S. Matthews J. Delp C. Lencer W. J. Clin. Invest. 1992; 89: 1938-1944Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). MDCK epithelial cells (passages 5–20) were also cultured and maintained as confluent monolayers in a 5% CO2humidified atmosphere at 37 °C. T84 monolayers were maintained in a 1:1 mixture of Dulbecco-Vogt modified Eagle's medium and Ham's F-12 medium supplemented with 15 mm HEPES buffer (pH 7.5) (Sigma); 14 mm NaHCO3; 40 mg of penicillin, 8 mg of ampicillin, and 90 mg of streptomycin per ml; and 5% newborn calf serum. MDCK monolayers were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (high glucose) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 2 mml-glutamine, 14 mmNaHCO3, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. Monolayers of T84 and MDCK cells were grown on 96-well polycarbonate plates (MDCK) (Costar Corp., Cambridge, MA) or 0.33-cm2 ring-supported polycarbonate filters (T84 and MDCK) of 0.4-μm pore size (Costar) and utilized 3–5 and 6–14 days postseeding, respectively. T84 monolayers received weekly and MDCK biweekly feedings postseeding. Cultured inverted monolayers of T84 cells, for PMN transmigration studies, utilized 5.0-μm pore size and were constructed as previously described (31.Madara J.L. Parkos C. Colgan S. MacLeod R.J.

Invest. 1991; 88: 1605-1612Crossref PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar). All culture medium supplies were purchased from Invitrogen. All S. typhimurium and Escherichia coli strains were grown as previously described (3.McCormick B.A. Colgan S.P. Delp-Archer C. Miller S.I. Madara J.L. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 123: 895-907Crossref PubMed Scopus (383) Google Scholar). Nonagitated, microaerophillic bacterial cultures were prepared by inoculating 40 ml of LB broth with 40 μl of a stationary phase culture, followed by overnight incubation at 37 °C (3.McCormick B.A. Colgan S.P. Delp-Archer C. Miller S.I. Madara J.L. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 123: 895-907Crossref PubMed Scopus (383) Google Scholar). For construction and transfer of the Tn-10 transposon, we used the nonpathogenic E. coli strains DH5α and SM10 (λpir). Transformations for sequence analysis utilized E. coli Top10-competent cells (Invitrogen Corp., Carlsbad, CA). Transcomplementation used the plasmid vector pTrc99A (Amersham Biosciences), harboring the wild-type fliE cDNA, and is designated PMM1001 (kind gift of R. M. Macnab, Yale University, New Haven, CT). Ampicillin (100 μg/ml), kanamycin (50 μg/ml), and naladixic acid (75 μg/ml) were added to bacterial culture medium when necessary. Purified flagellin was prepared as previously described (26.Gewirtz A.T. Simon Jr., P.O. Schmitt C.K. Taylor L.J. Hagedorn C.H. O'Brien A.D. Neish A.S. Madara J.L. J. Clin. Invest. 2001; 107: 99-109Crossref PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar). A bank of random transposon mutants was created using a mini-Tn-10 derivative with a lacZ reporter in a χ3306 S. typhimuriumbackground. The Tn-10-lacZ derivative was constructed by ligating the lacZ gene from pGP704 into pBSL180, a suicide vector with resistance to kanamycin (Kan) (33.Alexeyev M.F. Shokolenko I.N. Gene (Amst.). 1995; 160: 59-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Using SM10λpir, the Tn-10-lacZ transposon was conjugally transferred to χ3306, and transconjugates were selected on naladixic acid and Kan media. A library of ∼10,000 independent mutants was created. Random insertion of the transposon was verified by Southern hybridization using internal fragments as a probe. Recombinant DNA manipulations were carried out by standard methods (34.Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Ford N. Nolan C. Ferguson M. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). S. typhimurium mutants identified from initial screens were checked for single transposon insertion sites. To determine the site of transposon insertion, an EcoRI digest was performed, and the Kan fragment was ligated into pBluescript (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA), and the resulting constructs were transformed into XL1-Blue (Stratagene). The nucleotide sequence of DNA flanking the transposon was determined using universal primers that hybridize to the M13-reverse and T7 promoter sequences (Promega Corp., Madison, WI) or to 19- and 20-bp regions of the Kan resistance cassette (5′-GCTTCCATCCGAGTACGTG, 5′-GCTCGACGTTGTCACTGAAG). Sequencing chemistry was performed using an ABI PRIZM “Big Dye” terminator cycle sequencing ready reaction kit with amplitaque FS, and analysis was carried out on an ABI PRIZM 377 automated DNA sequencer (Applied Biosystems/PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Sequences were aligned using MacVector 5.0 software (International Biotechnologies Inc., New Haven, CT). Transcomplementation of KAR729 was carried out using plasmid pMM1001 containing wild-type fliE cDNA (a gift from R. M. Macnab). Competent KAR729 cells were transformed with plasmid DNA, and ampr/kanr colonies were selected for further investigation; this new strain was designated KAR729(pMM1001). Confluent epithelial monolayers of T84 or MDCK cells were grown as stated and equilibrated with 1.0 ml of Hanks' balanced salt solution plus Ca2+, Mg2+, and 10 mm HEPES pH 7.4 (Sigma) (HBSS+) in the lower wells and 100 μl in the upper wells and incubated for 30–45 min at 37 °C. To infect monolayers, 10 μl of an S. typhimurium suspension (2 × 109/ml (multiplicity of infection ∼70)) was added to the apical well of the cultured monolayers and incubated for 1 h at 37 °C. Monolayers were then carefully washed of excess bacteria and placed in 300 μl of HBSS+ in the lower (basolateral) well and incubated at 37 °C. The basolateral medium was collected 4 h later, and the concentration of IL-8 was analyzed by ELISA. For cells in the 96-well format, the final 30 min was modified; 50 μl of a 1% Triton X-100 solution in 10 mm EDTA was added to the upper surface of the cells. Negative controls with HBSS+ alone and positive controls with TNFα (100 ng/ml) added to the basolateral medium were employed in each assay. IL-8 was measured by a sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). For T84 cells, the assay performed was as previously described (3.McCormick B.A. Colgan S.P. Delp-Archer C. Miller S.I. Madara J.L. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 123: 895-907Crossref PubMed Scopus (383) Google Scholar), with some modifications. For MDCK cells, a canine ELISA was developed. For both assays, 96-well plates were coated overnight at 4 °C with either goat anti-human IL-8 (8 μg/ml; R & D Systems, Minneapolis, MN) or mouse anti-rabbit IL-8 (1 μg/ml; a gift from R. Mrsny (Genentech)) antibodies. Secondary antibodies were rabbit anti-human IL-8 (8 μg/ml; Endogen, Woburn, MA) or rabbit anti-canine IL-8 (1:200; a gift from R. Mrsny). The detection antibody for both was goat anti-rabbit peroxidase conjugate (1:7500; Kirkegaard & Perry Laboratories, Gaithersburg, MD). Semisolid agar (0.35%) was used to evaluate the motility of the following S. typhimuriumstrains: wild type (χ3306), Phopc (CS022),fliE knock-out (KAR729), and transcomplemented fliE (KAR729(pMM1001)). Small wells were made in semisolid agar plates, loaded with 5 μl from a maximally invasive culture (described above) of each strain and incubated at 37 °C for 4 h. The motility of each Salmonella strain in the agar was evaluated by the diameter of the “halo” of colony growth produced. Infection of T84 or MDCK epithelial monolayers was performed by the method described previously (3.McCormick B.A. Colgan S.P. Delp-Archer C. Miller S.I. Madara J.L. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 123: 895-907Crossref PubMed Scopus (383) Google Scholar). Monolayers were placed in a 24-well tissue culture plate with 300 μl of HBSS+ added to the lower (basolateral) well and 100 μl of HBSS+ added to the upper (apical) well. After a 30-min equilibration, 10 μl of bacterial solution (∼20 bacteria/epithelial cell) was added apically, and bacterial adherence and invasion were assessed after 1 h. Cell-associated bacteria represent bacteria adhered to and/or internalized into the monolayers and were released by incubation with 100 μl of 1% Triton X-100 (Sigma). Internalized bacteria were those obtained after lysis of the monolayer with 1% Triton X-100 following a 45-min incubation with gentamicin (50 μg/ml). For both cell-associated and internalized bacteria, 0.9 ml of Luria broth was added, mixed, and quantified by plating on MacConkey agar medium for colony-forming units. To determine the number of attached bacteria, the number of cell-internalized bacteria was subtracted from the number of cell-associated bacteria (since cell-associated bacteria include both attached and internalized bacteria). The physiologically relevant (basolateral to apical) transepithelial migration of PMN (neutrophils) using cell culture inserts of inverted T84 monolayers has previously been detailed (3.McCormick B.A. Colgan S.P. Delp-Archer C. Miller S.I. Madara J.L. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 123: 895-907Crossref PubMed Scopus (383) Google Scholar, 32.Parkos C.A. Delp C. Arnaout M.A. Madara J.L. J. Clin. Invest. 1991; 88: 1605-1612Crossref PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar). Human PMN were isolated from normal volunteers as described (32.Parkos C.A. Delp C. Arnaout M.A. Madara J.L. J. Clin. Invest. 1991; 88: 1605-1612Crossref PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar, 35.Henson P.M. Oades Z.G. J. Clin. Invest. 1975; 56: 1053-1061Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). Inverted T84 cell monolayers were washed in HBSS+ to remove residual serum components. S. typhimurium was washed twice in HBSS+ and resuspended at a final concentration of ∼5 × 109bacteria/ml. 100-μl bacterial aliquots (∼5 × 108bacteria) were microcentrifuged at 14,000 × g for 3 min and resuspended in a final volume of 25 μl. Inverted monolayers were placed in a humidified chamber with the apical membrane oriented upward. The bacterial suspension was added to the apical surface and incubated for 1 h at 37 °C. Nonadherent bacteria were removed by washing three times in HBSS+. The monolayers were then transferred back into the 24-well tissue culture tray containing 300 μl of HBSS+ in the lower reservoir (i.e. the apical membrane now colonized with Salmonellae), and 160 μl was added to the upper reservoir (i.e. the basolateral interface). For simplicity, the reservoir will be referred to by the epithelial membrane domain with which it interfaces. (i.e. apical or basolateral). To the basolateral chamber, 40 μl (∼106) of isolated PMNs were added to each monolayer and incubated for 110 min at 37 °C. The addition of 1 μmN-formylmethionylleucyl phenylalanine to the apical reservoir served as a positive control. Transmigration was quantified by assaying for the PMN azurophilic granule marker myeloperoxidase as described previously (32.Parkos C.A. Delp C. Arnaout M.A. Madara J.L. J. Clin. Invest. 1991; 88: 1605-1612Crossref PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar, 36.Parkos C.A. Colgan S.P. Delp C. Arnaout M.A. Madara J.L. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 117: 757-764Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). After each transmigration assay, nonadherent PMNs were washed from the surface of the monolayer, and PMN cell equivalents, estimated from a standard curve, were assessed as the number of PMNs associated with the monolayer and the number that had completely traversed the monolayer (i.e. into the basolateral reservoir). Filter-grown cells were rinsed twice in ice-cold PBS supplemented with 0.1 mmCaCl2 and 1 mm MgCl2 (PBS-CM) and incubated for 30 min on ice with 1 mg/ml sulfo-N-hydroxysuccinimide-biotin (Pierce) in PBS-CM added to either the apical or basolateral compartments. Biotinylation was quenched by incubating monolayers for 5 min in 50 mmNH4Cl in PBS-CM, washed three times in PBS, and lysed for 10 min on ice in a solution containing 1% Triton X-100, 20 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 50 mm NaCl, 5 mmEDTA, 0.2% bovine serum albumin supplemented with protease inhibitors. Biotinylated proteins were isolated by incubation with streptavidin-agarose beads (Pierce) for 16 h at 4 °C. Proteins bound to agarose beads were solubilized in protein loading buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 6.8, 100 mm dithiothreitol, 2% SDS, 0.1% bromphenol blue, 10% glycerol), separated by SDS-PAGE, and transferred to nitrocellulose membrane for immunoblotting. Total cell proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE (12%), transferred to nitrocellulose (Bio-Rad; 0.45-m membrane) and incubated in the presence of anti-IκBα mAb (1:2000; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA) followed by a peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit antibody (1:2000; Amersham Biosciences). Bacterial flagellin was detected in bacterial lysates using anti-E. coli flagellin mAb (15D8) (1:1000; Igen International, Gaithersburg, MD), followed by goat anti-mouse peroxidase-conjugated antibody (1:2000; Amersham Biosciences). TLR5 was detected with anti-TLR5 polyclonal Ab (1:1000; Santa Cruz Biotechnology) followed by a peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit antibody (1:2000; Amersham Biosciences). Reactive bands were visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence using a kit (Amersham Biosciences) according to the manufacturer's instructions. T84 and MDCK monolayers were washed in ice-cold PBS and fixed in 3.7% paraformaldehyde in PBS (Electron Microscopy Sciences, Ft. Washington, PA) for 10 min. Monolayers were washed and permeabilized for 10 min in 0.2% Triton X-100. Actin filaments were stained with rhodamine-conjugated phalloidin for 45 min at 37 °C and rinsed three times in PBS. Monolayers attached to membranes were excised from the inserts and mounted cell-side up on a glass slide. The membrane was covered with SlowFade reagent (Molecular Probes, Inc., Eugene, OR), and a coverslip and edges were sealed to prevent drying. Specimens were examined with a Zeiss LSM410 scanning laser confocal microscope using the 488/568-nm wavelength lines of an argon-krypton laser. The cell monolayer was optically sectioned every 0.5 μm. Image resolution using a Zeiss ×100 Neofluor objective and Zeiss LSM software was 512 × 512 pixels. Bacterial pellets were fixed in 4% gluteraldehyde solution over night at 4 °C for subsequent processing. Transmission electron microscopy processing was as previously described (3.McCormick B.A. Colgan S.P. Delp-Archer C. Miller S.I. Madara J.L. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 123: 895-907Crossref PubMed Scopus (383) Google Scholar). Paired Student's t test analysis was carried out on data using SSPSS software to assess statistical significance. Approximately 1000Salmonella Tn-10 mutants were screened for their ability to induce the secretion of IL-8 using MDCK cells in a 96-well format. One S. typhimurium Tn-10 mutant (designated KAR729) was identified in which the ability to induce IL-8 secretion in epithelial cells was consistently and significantly reduced (p < 0.001) (Fig. 1A). Using filter-grown monolayers, we observed a complete lack of IL-8 secretion in polarized monolayers infected with KAR729 that was identical to untreated controls in both MDCK (Fig. 1B) and T84 cells (data not shown). To determine the insertion site of the Tn-10 transposon in the KAR729 mutant, EcoRI-digested genomic DNA fragments were inserted into pBluescript and sequenced using oligonucleotide primers to the T7 and M13 promoters as well as primers complementary to 19- and 20-bp regions within the kanrsequence of the transposon (see “Experimental Procedures”). Sequence analysis revealed that the Tn-10 transposon had inserted within the S. typhimurium flagellar fliE locus (Fig. 1C) that is positioned at the end of the flagellar IIIb region of the S. typhimurium chromosome, at centisome 42 (37.Sanderson K.E. Hessel A. Rudd K.E. Microbiol. Rev. 1995; 59: 241-303Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Since the fliE gene, disrupted by the Tn-10 insertion, encodes a protein localized to the basal body of flagellae (38.Aizawa S.I. Mol. Microbiol. 1996; 19: 1-5Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar, 39.Minamino T. Yamaguchi S. Macnab R.M. J. Bacteriol. 2000; 182: 3029-3036Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar), we examined the state of bacterial flagellae in KAR729. Currently, the understanding of the underlying mechanisms of flagellin protein secretion is incomplete, and the role FliE protein may play in this process is not well understood. We next assessed whether flagellin was secreted from the KAR729 mutant. Flagellin (FliC) is normally found in abundance in S. typhimurium supernatants and is easily detected by immunoblot. As shown in Fig. 2A, wild-type S. typhimurium χ3306, the invasion-deficient mutant PhoPc, and even E. coli (strain F18) secrete significant amounts of flagellin into the bacterial supernatant. However, both KAR729 and fliC−/fljB− (a flagellin-deficient mutant) do not secrete flagellin into the supernatant (Fig. 2A). Wild-type S. typhimuriumχ3306 is known to possess 8–10 flagellae per bacterium that are readily visualized by electron microscopy (Fig. 2B); however, KAR729 completely lacks flagellae (Fig. 2B). These findings suggest that fliE is not only required for flagellin secretion but also for flagellar assembly and are in complete agreement with other recent findings that demonstrate that completion of basal body assembly is necessary for flagellation (23.Komoriya K. Shibano N. Higano T. Azuma N. Yamaguchi S. Aizawa S.I. Mol. Microbiol. 1999; 34: 767-779Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar, 39.Minamino T. Yamaguchi S. Macnab R.M. J.

https://openalex.org/W2067015560,"The hepatitis C virus nonstructural protein 5A (NS5A) is a multifunctional phosphoprotein that leads to pleiotropic responses, in part by regulating cell growth and cellular signaling pathways. Here we show that overexpression of NS5A inhibits tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha-induced nuclear factor kappaB (NF-kappaB) activation in HEK293 cells, as determined by luciferase reporter gene expression and by electrophoretic mobility shift assay. When overexpressed, NS5A cannot inhibit the recruitment of TNF receptor-associated factor 2 (TRAF2) and IkappaB kinase (IKK)beta into the TNF receptor 1-TNF receptor-associated death domain complex. In contrast, NS5A is a part of the TNF receptor 1 signaling complex. NF-kappaB activation by TNF receptor-associated death domain and TRAF2 was inhibited by NS5A, whereas MEKK1 and IKKbeta-dependent NF-kappaB activation was not affected, suggesting that NS5A may inhibit NF-kappaB activation signaled by TRAF2. Coimmunoprecipitation and colocalization of NS5A and TRAF2 expressed in vivo provide compelling evidence that NS5A directly interacts with TRAF2. This interaction was mapped to the middle one-third (amino acids 148-301) of NS5A and the TRAF domain of TRAF2. Our findings suggest a possible molecular mechanism that could explain the ability of NS5A to negatively regulate TNF-alpha-induced NF-kappaB activation."
https://openalex.org/W2118892037,"Previous work has demonstrated that the large subunit (rbcL) of ribulose 1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase (RuBisCo) from wheat is cleaved at Gly-329 by the Fe2+/ascorbate/H2O2 system (Ishida, H., Makino, A., and Mae, T. (1999) J. Biol. Chem. 274, 5222–5226). In this study, we found that the rbcL could also be cleaved into several other fragments by increasing the incubation time or the Fe2+ concentration. By combining immunoblotting with N-terminal amino acid sequencing, cleavage sites were identified at Gly-404, Gly-380, Gly-329, Ala-296, Asp-203, and Gly-122. Conformational analysis demonstrated that five of them are located in the α/β-barrel, whereas Gly-122 is in the N-terminal domain but near the bound metal in the adjacent rbcL. All of these residues are at or very close to the active site and are just around the metal-binding site within a radius of 12 Å. Furthermore, their CαH groups are completely or partially exposed to the bound metal. A radical scavenger, activation of RuBisCo, or binding of a reaction-intermediate analogue to the activated RuBisCo, inhibited the fragmentation. These results strongly suggest that the rbcL is cleaved by reactive oxygen species generated at the metal-binding site and that proximity and favorable orientation are probably the most important parameters in determining the cleavage sites. Previous work has demonstrated that the large subunit (rbcL) of ribulose 1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase (RuBisCo) from wheat is cleaved at Gly-329 by the Fe2+/ascorbate/H2O2 system (Ishida, H., Makino, A., and Mae, T.

It is the most abundant leaf protein, which accounts for 40–50% soluble protein and 20–30% total leaf nitrogen in the mature leaves of C3 plants (1.Makino A. Mae T. Ohira K.

Photosynthesis. Alan R. Liss, Inc., New York1989: 183-205Google Scholar). During senescence, RuBisCo is rapidly degraded, and its nitrogen is remobilized and translocated into growing organs, thus affecting photosynthesis and nitrogen economy in plants (4.Mae T. Makino A. Ohira K. Thomson W.W. Nothnagel E.A. Huffaker R. Plant Senescence: Its Biochemistry and Physiology. The American Society of Plant Physiologists, Rockville, MD1987: 123-131Google Scholar).

Chem. 1999; 274: 5222-5226Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar) have suggested that reactive oxygen species (ROS) may trigger the degradation of RuBisCo in plants. Our previous works (7.Ishida H. Nishimori Y. Sugisawa M. Makino A. Mae T. Plant Cell Physiol. 1997; 38: 471-479Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar, 8.Ishida H. Shimizu S. Makino A. Mae T. Planta. 1998; 204: 305-309Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar) indicated that the large subunit of RuBisCo (rbcL) is directly cleaved into 37- and 16-kDa fragments by ROS in both chloroplast lysates and intact chloroplasts under illumination. A similar fragmentation was also observed when the purified RuBisCo was incubated with the Fe2+/ascorbate/H2O2 system (7.Ishida H. Nishimori Y. Sugisawa M. Makino A. Mae T. Plant Cell Physiol. 1997; 38: 471-479Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the cleavage site has been identified at glycine 329, close to the active site of RuBisCo, and it has been suggested that ROS generated at the catalytic site of the rbcL by Fenton reaction may lead to this site-specific fragmentation (9.Ishida H. Makino A. Mae T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 5222-5226Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Therefore, the mechanism for the Fe2+-catalyzed oxidative cleavage of RuBisCo needs to be confirmed.It has been well documented that various biomolecules are susceptible to damage by ROS generated by the presence of reduced transition metals such as Fe2+ and Cu1+ (10.Halliwell B. Gutteridge G.M.C. Methods Enzymol. 1984; 105: 47-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar, 11.Stadtman E.R. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1993; 62: 797-821Crossref PubMed Scopus (1254) Google Scholar). When these transition metals specifically bind to a protein, the polypeptide backbone can be cleaved by ROS in the presence of H2O2 and/or O2 and a reducing agent such as ascorbate or dithiothreitol (12.Kim K.

Protein fragmentation by ROS produced by bound metal ions through Fenton reaction is not a random process. Kim et al. (12.Kim K. Rhee S.G. Stadtman E.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 15394-15397Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) has suggested that ROS are generated locally around irons bound at specific sites on enzymes, and these ROS are responsible for the specific cleavage of proteins such as glutamine synthetase, adenylyltransferase, and pyruvate kinase. Wei et al. (20.Wei C-H. Chou W-Y. Huang S-M. Lin C-C. Chang G-G. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 7931-7936Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 21.Wei C-H. Chou W-Y. Chang G-G. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 7949-7954Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar) demonstrated that malic enzyme is specifically cleaved at the metal-binding site by the Fe2+/ascorbate system. Similarly, this affinity cleavage has been used to identify the metal-binding sites in several other enzymes including isocitrate dehydrogenase (13.Soundar S. Colman R.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 5264-5271Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylate oxidase (15.Zhang Z. Barlow J.N. Baldwin J.E. Schofield C.J. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 15999-16007Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar), phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (22.Hlavaty J.J. Nowak T. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 15514-15525Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar), and restriction endonucleases (18.Hlavaty J.J. Benner J.S. Hornstra L.J. Schildkraut I. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 3097-3105Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Moreover, metal-catalyzed oxidative cleavage of proteins has also been used to identify TaqI endonuclease active site residues (16.Cao W. Barany F. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 33002-33010Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar) and to provide information on spatial organization of Na and K-ATPase (17.Shimon M.B. Goldshleger R. Karlish S.J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 34190-34195Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar,23.Goldshleger R. Karlish S.J.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 9596-9601Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar), because the bound transition metals catalyze the site-specific cleavages of peptide bonds close to the bound metals.On the other hand, metal-catalyzed site-specific cleavage of proteins could be achieved by introducing a specific metal-binding site on a protein. Some “bifunctional chelating agents,” which incorporate a strong metal-chelating group and a functional group capable of reacting with a specific group on the protein (24.Rana T.M. Adv. Inorg. Biochem. 1994; 10: 177-200PubMed Google Scholar), have been synthesized and used for this approach. Rana and Meares (25.Rana T.M. Meares C.F. J. Am. Chem.

Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 13625-13641Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar) developed another Fe-EDTA derivative, which is attached through a mixed disulfide to a cysteine residue of a protein. When Fe-EDTA is attached to a protein, site-specific cleavage occurs close to the attachment site in the presence of H2O2and/or O2 and ascorbate.In this study, the site-specific cleavage of purified wheat RuBisCo by the Fe2+/ascorbate/H2O2 system was investigated in detail. We found that several other new fragments besides 37- and 16-kDa appeared when the incubation time was prolonged or the Fe2+ concentration was raised. These fragments were identified by their cross-reactivity with the site-specific antibodies against the N-terminal portion and the C-terminal portion of the rbcL, and the N-terminal amino acid sequences of the fragments containing the C-terminal portion of the rbcL were analyzed. The results demonstrated that all the C-terminal fragments analyzed had free N termini making it possible to identify six cleavage sites including Gly-329. Using the high resolution crystal structures of RuBisCo as models, the sites of cleavage were mapped. The results indicated that all these sites were around the metal-binding site in the rbcL, strongly suggesting that the backbone of the rbcL was cleaved by ROS generated at the metal-binding site. The structural basis of the cleavage reaction was analyzed in detail, and the mechanisms of Fe2+-catalyzed cleavage of RuBisCo were examined.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESPlant Material and RuBisCo PurificationWheat (Triticum aestivum L. cv. Aoba) seeds were planted on a plastic net floating on tap water in a pot and grown in a phytotron with a day and night temperature of 20 and 18 °C, respectively, and 70% relative humidity. The photoperiod was 12 h with a quantum flux density of 300 μmol of quanta m−2 s−1at plant height. RuBisCo was purified from the primary and secondary leaves of 9-day-old seedlings according to a previously described procedure (7.Ishida H. Nishimori Y. Sugisawa M. Makino A. Mae T. Plant Cell Physiol. 1997; 38: 471-479Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar).Cleavage of RuBisCo by the Fe2+/Ascorbate/H2O2SystemPurified RuBisCo was first passed through an Econo-Pac 10DG (Bio-Rad) column previously equilibrated with 100 mmHepes-NaOH buffer, pH 7.5, for a change of buffer. In a typical cleavage experiment, 0.5 μl of 0.02–20 mmFeSO4, 0.5 μl of 200 mm sodium ascorbate, and 1 μl of 10 mm H2O2 were added to 8 μl of RuBisCo solution (the rbcL protomer concentration, 18.5 μm) so that the final concentrations in this 10-μl mixture would be 14.8 μm rbcL, 1–1000 μm FeSO4, 10 mm sodium ascorbate, and 1 mm H2O2. The cleavage reaction was held at 4 °C for the given time, and then 10 μl of 2 × SDS sample buffer (200 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.5, 2% (w/v) SDS, 20% (v/v) glycerol, and 5% (v/v) 2-mercaptoethanol) was added followed by heating of the mixture at 100 °C for 3 min. Boiled samples were analyzed by gel electrophoresis followed by immunoblotting or stored at −40 °C until use. Further experimental details are given in the figure legends.Gel Electrophoresis and ImmunoblottingSDS-PAGE (12.5%) was performed according to a reported procedure (29.Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (206024) Google Scholar) with a modification in the SDS sample buffer as described above. Two-dimensional polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis was carried out by the method of O'Farrell (30.O'Farrell P.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1975; 250: 4007-4021Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) with the exception that 2% (v/v) ampholine (pH range 3.5–10, Amersham Biosciences) was used for isoelectric focusing. Tricine-SDS-PAGE was performed according to the method of Schägger and von Jagow (31.Schägger H. von Jagow G. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 166: 368-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (10439) Google Scholar) using a 16.5% T (total percentage concentration of acrylamide-bisacrylamide mixture), 6% C (percentage concentration of the cross-linker relative to the total concentration T) separating gel. The electrophoresis run started at 30 V, and then the voltage was raised to 100 V after the sample had completely moved into the separating gel. Immunoblot analysis was carried out with site-specific anti-rbcL-N and anti-LSU-C antibodies against the N-terminal portion corresponding to residues 3–17 and against the C-terminal portion corresponding to residues 463–477 of the wheat rbcL, respectively (7.Ishida H. Nishimori Y. Sugisawa M. Makino A. Mae T. Plant Cell Physiol. 1997; 38: 471-479Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar).Isolation of the rbcL FragmentsFor sequence analysis, the 40-, 30.5-, and 20-kDa fragments were separated by SDS-PAGE, and the 16-, 10.5-, and 8-kDa fragments were separated by Tricine-SDS-PAGE. Gel electrophoresis was performed as described above with the following modifications. First, the gel was cast overnight prior to use to allow the decomposition of ammonium peroxodisulfate. Second, the samples were treated with SDS sample buffer at 25 °C (not at 100 °C) for more than 1 h prior to loading the gel to avoid possible modification of the fragments. After gel electrophoresis, the separated fragments were transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Bio-Rad) using a transfer buffer containing 10 mm Caps-NaOH, pH 11.0, and 20% (v/v) methanol. The membrane was then stained with 0.1% (w/v) Coomassie Blue R-250 in 50% (v/v) methanol for 5 min at room temperature followed by destaining in 50% (v/v) methanol for three times within 25 min. The membrane was allowed to air-dry overnight, and the bands of interest were cut out and stored at −20 °C until analysis.N-terminal Amino Acid Sequencing and Conformational AnalysesThe N-terminal amino acid sequence of the isolated fragments was automatically analyzed with an Applied Biosystems-pulsed liquid protein sequencer (Model 491), equipped with an on-line analyzer of the phenylthiohydantoin derivative of the amino acids. The transblot membranes containing the protein fragments were directly sequenced by Edman degradation for 10 cycles. Identified cleavage sites were mapped on the available structures of RuBisCo in the Research Collaboratory for Structural Bioinformatics Protein Data Bank (32.Berman H.M. Westbrook J. Feng Z. Gilliland G. Bhat T.N. Weissig H. Shindyalov I.N. Bourne P.E. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 235-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (26649) Google Scholar). Furthermore, conformational analyses were carried out using Insight II (Biosym Technologies, Inc.) and Weblab ViewerLite (Molecular Simulations, Inc.) programs.RESULTSTime and Fe2+ Concentration-dependent Cleavage of the rbcL by the Fe2+/Ascorbate/H2O2 SystemAs with all other higher plant RuBisCo (33.Hartman F.C. Harpel M.R. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1994; 63: 197-234Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), RuBisCo from wheat is a hexadecamer of eight large subunits and eight small subunits (rbcS) with molecular masses of ∼53 (34.Terachi T. Ogihara Y. Tsunewaki K. Jpn. J. Genet. 1987; 62: 375-387Crossref Scopus (39) Google Scholar) and 15 kDa (35.Broglie R. Coruzzi G. Lamppa G. Keith B. Chua N.H. Bio/Technology. 1983; 1: 55-61Crossref Scopus (145) Google Scholar), respectively. We have previously demonstrated that the rbcL can be directly broken down into 37- and 16-kDa fragments when incubated with 1 mmH2O2, 10 μm FeSO2, and 1 mm ascorbic acid at 4 °C for 15 min in 50 mm Hepes-NaOH buffer containing 5% (v/v) glycerol and 1 mm dithiothreitol (9.Ishida H.

However, our recent work has indicated that the rbcL can be degraded into several other fragments as well as 37- and 16-kDa when the conditions of cleavage reaction are changed. It can be seen from Fig. 1A that several new fragments including four major fragments (43-, 40-, 33-, and 20-kDa) and two minor fragments (45- and 30.5-kDa) appeared gradually at 4 °C with an increase of incubation time up to 22 h, whereas the quantity of the rbcL decreased slowly. On the other hand, no changes in the rbcS can be detected. Increasing the Fe2+ concentration also led to similar changes in cleavage pattern after 1-h incubation at 4 °C (Fig. 1B). The 37-kDa fragment appeared first and was the most dominant one after 0.5-h incubation or in the presence of 1–10 μm Fe2+. However, unlike the others, no further increase in its quantity could be seen until 22 h of incubation or in the presence of 1 mm Fe2+. The 16-kDa fragment, which is complementary to the 37-kDa fragment (9.Ishida H. Makino A. Mae T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 5222-5226Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar), could not be separated from the rbcS by SDS-PAGE because of their similar molecular masses, but it was identified using two-dimensional PAGE and Tricine-SDS-PAGE (see below). These results clearly demonstrate that the rbcL can be cleaved at not only Gly-329 (9.Ishida H. Makino A. Mae T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 5222-5226Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar) but also at several other sites by the Fe2+/ascorbate/H2O2 system when the incubation time or the Fe2+ concentration is increased. However, the cleavage of Gly-329 seems to be easier. Note that glycerol was omitted from the Hepes-NaOH buffer in this study, because Hlavaty et al. (18.Hlavaty J.J. Benner J.S. Hornstra L.J. Schildkraut I. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 3097-3105Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 22.Hlavaty J.J. Nowak T. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 15514-15525Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar) had reported that glycerol could act as a radical scavenger, which protected the phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase and endonuclease against Fe2+/ascorbate-induced backbone cleavage.Estimation of Putative Cleavage Sites of the rbcLTo determine the cleavage sites of the primary sequence of the rbcL, the cross-reactivities of the fragments with two site-specific antibodies (anti-rbcL-N and anti-rbcL-C) were examined. As shown in Fig. 2, two-dimensional PAGE (30.O'Farrell P.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1975; 250: 4007-4021Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) was used for separating the polypeptides having similar molecular masses but different isoelectric points (for example, 16-kDa fragment and rbcS). All the fragments found in Fig. 1, as well as the 16-kDa fragment, were detected by two-dimensional PAGE (Fig. 2A). In these fragments, the 45-, 37-, and 33-kDa fragments cross-reacted with the anti-rbcL-N but not with the anti-rbcL-C, indicating they are N-terminal fragments. In contrast, the 40-, 30.5-, 20-, and 16-kDa fragments cross-reacted with only the anti-rbcL-C, demonstrating that they are C-terminal fragments. The band of 43-kDa, which cross-reacted with both the anti-rbcL-N and anti-rbcL-C, seems to be two different fragments that contain the N and C terminus, respectively, of the rbcL. Further experiments on this band demonstrated that there were two fragments that could barely be separated by SDS-PAGE containing 10% (w/v) acrylamide (data not shown). Thus, it can be considered that these two 43-kDa fragments are the N- and C-terminal fragments, respectively, but that they have similar molecular masses and isoelectric points so that they cannot be separated by two-dimensional PAGE. It should be noticed in Fig. 2 that most of the spots were multiple spots with the same molecular weight. This finding could be explained as resulting from the charge heterogeneities of the polypeptides (30.O'Farrell P.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1975; 250: 4007-4021Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), which could be attributed to the ROS-generated oxidative modification of the rbcL fragments, such as formation of carbonyl derivatives on amino acid side chains (36.Eckardt N.A. Pell E.J. Plant Physiol. Biochem. 1995; 33: 273-282Google Scholar).Figure 2Cross-reactivity of the site-specific anti-rbcL-N or anti-rbcL-C antibody to the fragments of the rbcL separated by two-dimensional polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. RuBisCo (the rbcL protomer concentration, 14.8 μm) was incubated at 4 °C for 3 h in 100 mm Hepes-NaOH buffer, pH 7.5, in the presence of 100 μmFeSO4, 10 mm sodium ascorbate, and 1 mm H2O2. After incubation, the reaction mixture was analyzed by two-dimensional polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Separated polypeptides were transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane followed by Coomassie Blue staining (A) or analyzed by immunoblotting with anti-rbcL-N antibody (B) or anti-rbcL-C antibody (C). Arrowheads in the panels indicate the positions of the rbcL, rbcS, and the fragments of the rbcL with their molecular masses (kDa).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)According to the molecular mass of the rbcL (53 kDa), the following two pairs of fragments seem to be complementary based on their apparent molecular sizes and those mentioned above, 37- and 16-kDa fragments (which were previously demonstrated) and 33- and 20-kDa fragments. However, the complementary fragment of the minor fragment (30.5-kDa), which may have a calculated mass of 22.5 kDa, cannot be seen in Figs. 1 and 2 and was barely visible when SDS-PAGE was applied to a >5-fold concentrated sample (data not shown), indicating that the cleavage at this site was minor in comparison with the others.On the other hand, several complements to the other fragments, which may have calculated masses smaller than 15 kDa, remain to be resolved. Here it can be seen from Fig. 1 that there are at least two weak bands under the rbcS (Fig. 1, A and B, rightmost lanes). To separate these small fragments more effectively, Tricine-SDS-PAGE (31.Schägger H. von Jagow G. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 166: 368-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (10439) Google Scholar) was used (Fig. 3). Based on the molecular mass markers (range of 2.5–17 kDa), three new fragments were found to have molecular masses of ∼10.5, 9, and 8 kDa, respectively (Fig. 3, lane 1). The cross-reactivities with the site-specific antibodies indicated that the 9-kDa fragment contained the N terminus of the rbcL, and that the 10.5- and 8-kDa fragments contained the C termini (Fig. 3, lanes 2 and 3). In addition, a new 13-kDa fragment cross-reacting with the anti-rbcL-N was detected in lane 2, but this band was very weak in Coomassie Blue-stained gel. On the other hand, it was found that this PAGE could also separate the C-terminal 16-kDa fragment. From these results and those shown in Fig. 2, the following complementary fragments can be considered as pairs: 45 and 8 kDa, 43 and 10.5 kDa, 13 and 40 kDa, and 9 and 43 kDa.Figure 3Cross-reactivity of the site-specific anti-rbcL-N or anti-rbcL-C antibody to the fragments of the rbcL separated by Tricine-SDS-PAGE. RuBisCo was cleaved by the Fe2+/ascorbate/H2O2 system under the same conditions as described in Fig. 2. After the cleavage reaction, sample was analyzed by Tricine-SDS-PAGE followed by Coomassie Blue staining (lane 1) or immunoblot analysis using anti-rbcL-N antibody (lane 2) or anti-rbcL-C antibody (lane 3). Molecular masses (kDa) of the fragments are indicated beside the lanes.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Identification of Cleavage SitesThe apparently complementary pairs of fragments (see above) are summarized in Table I. In the seven C-terminal fragments, six were isolated using SDS-PAGE or Tricine-SDS-PAGE followed by electroblotting onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The remainder of the C-terminal 43-kDa fragment, which could not be isolated from the N-terminal 43-kDa fragment by the methods used for this study, was not investigated further. The six purified C-terminal fragments were subjected to N-terminal Edman degradation sequence analysis. As shown in Table I, all these fragments were sequenced successfully demonstrating that they had free N termini. The N-terminal sequences of 8-, 10.5-, 16-, 20-, 30.5-, and 40-kDa fragments correspond to residues 405–414, 381–390, 330–339, 297–306, 204–213, and 123–132 of wheat rbcL, respectively (34.Terachi T. Ogihara Y. Tsunewaki K. Jpn. J. Genet. 1987; 62: 375-387Crossref Scopus (39) Google Scholar). These results indicate that the rbcLs are cleaved by the Fe2+/ascorbate/H2O2system at the following sites: Gly-404, Gly-380, Gly-329, Ala-296, Asp-203, and Gly-122. Note that the Gly-329 agrees with the site found previously (9.Ishida H. Makino A. Mae T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 5222-5226Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). The molecular masses of these C-terminal fragments calculated from the amino acid sequence are 7891, 10,500, 16,181, 19,872, 30,429, and 39,538 Da, respectively, corresponding to their masses measured by SDS-PAGE.Table IAnalysis of the fragments produced by Fe2+-catalyzed cleavage of the rbcLPairs of fragmentsN-terminal sequence of the C-terminal fragmentsrbcL sequencebActive-site residues identified by the three-dimensional structure (37) are underlined.Cleavage sitesN-terminal fragmentsaResults from Figs. 2 and 3.C-terminal fragmentsaResults from Figs. 2 and 3.kDakDa458GTLGH P XGNAFGG404GTLGH PWGNA414Gly-4044310.5GIHV X HMPALASG380GIHVW HMPAL390Gly-3803716TVVGK L XXXRHSG329TVVGKLEGER339Gly-3293320MHAVI DRQKNHRA296MHAVI DRQKN306Ala-296Not detected30.5ENVN X Q XXMRKDD203ENVNS QPFMR213Asp-2031340NVFGF KALRAIVG122NVFGF KALRA132Gly-122943Not sequencedCleavage experiments were performed as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Produced fragments were separated by SDS-PAGE or Tricine-SDS-PAGE and blotted onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes.

Using human tumor cell lines devoid of NQO1 enzymatic activity, we have previously identified a single nucleotide polymorphism (NQO1*2 allele) in the human NQO1 gene. This mutation has been characterized as a genetic polymorphism (NQO1*2), which leads to greatly diminished levels of protein due to rapid degradation of the NQO1*2 protein by the ubiquitin proteasomal pathway (UPP). In an attempt to decipher the mechanism responsible for the differential stability of wild-type NQO1*1 and mutant NQO1*2 proteins, we have investigated the interactions of these proteins with molecular chaperones of the Hsp family. Using co-immunoprecipitation studies (co-IPs), no association was observed between Hsp90 and either wild-type NQO1*1 or mutant NQO1*2 proteins. Hsp70, however, was found to associate with NQO1*1 protein in cells when co-IPs were performed with an anti-NQO1 antibody followed by immunoblotting with an anti-Hsp70 antibody or vice versa. Hsp40 could also be detected in the immunoprecipitated protein complex. Experiments were also performed using either the NQO1*1 or NQO1*2 coding regions in anin vitro transcription/translation system employing rabbit reticulocyte lysates (RRLs). Consistent with the cellular data, co-IP experiments in RRLs demonstrated an association of Hsp70 with wild-type NQO1*1 protein but not with NQO1*2 protein. To further elucidate the role of the association of Hsp70 with the NQO1*1 protein, site-directed mutagenesis was used to modify a proposed Hsp70 binding site near the N terminus of the NQO1 protein. We generated a plasmid containing an NQO1*1 coding region with a mutated Hsp70 binding site (isoleucine to aspartic acid at position 8, NQO1*1/I8D). In contrast to the NQO1*1 protein translated in RRLs, the NQO1*1/I8D protein did not associate with Hsp70, as demonstrated by co-IP, was catalytically inactive, and was degraded by the UPP. These data suggest that the association of Hsp70 with NQO1*1 may play an important role in the stability and functionality of the NQO1 protein.

NQO1 has relevance for both chemoprotection and chemotherapy, since it can deactivate potentially toxic quinones found in the environment but can also bioactivate anti-tumor quinones such as mitomycin C (1.Long D.J.

NQO1 gene expression has also shown to be induced in response to xenobiotics, antioxidants, oxidants, heavy metals, UV light, and ionizing radiation, and recently NQO1 has been reported to stabilize p53 (4.Boothman D.

In addition to the expression of NQO1 in normal tissues, a high level of NQO1 activity has been documented in a wide ranging spectrum of human tumors and cell lines (7.Schlager J.J. Powis G. Int. J.

The mutation is a C to T base pair substitution at position 609 of the NQO1 cDNA that codes for a proline to serine change at position 187 of the amino acid sequence of the NQO1 protein. This mutation in humans has been characterized as a genetic polymorphism (NQO1*2), and the frequency of the NQO1*2/*2 (homozygous mutant) genotype ranges from 4% in Caucasians to greater than 20% in Asian populations (12.Kelsey K.T. Ross D. Traver R.D. Christiani D.C. Zuo Z.F. Spitz M.R. Wang M. Xu X. Lee B.K. Schwatz B.S. Wiencke J.K. Br. J. Cancer. 1997; 76: 852-854Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). Low levels of NQO1 activity associated with the NQO1*2 polymorphism has been shown to be associated with an increased risk of benzene-induced hematotoxicity (13.Moran J.L. Siegel D. Ross D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 8150-8155Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar), an increased risk of acute leukemia in adults (14.Smith M.T. Wang Y. Kane E. Rollinson S. Wiemels J.L.

Greaves M.F. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 4095-4099PubMed Google Scholar), and an increased risk of secondary leukemia after treatment with chemotherapeutic agents (16.Larson R.A. Wang Y. Banerjee M. Wiemels J. Hartford C. Le Beau M.M. Smith M.T. Blood. 1999; 94: 803-807Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Genotype-phenotype studies of the NQO1*2 allele have been performed, and no measurable NQO1 activity or protein could be detected in cell lines or saliva samples from individuals with the NQO1*2/*2 genotype. In agreement, no NQO1*2 mutant protein could be detected in NQO1*2/*2 tissue samples using immunohistochemistry (17.Siegel D. McGuiness S. Winski S.L. Ross D. Pharmacogenetics. 1999; 9: 113-121Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). A small amount of NQO1*2 protein could be detected in NQO1*2/*2 cell lines by immunoblot analysis with enhanced chemiluminesence detection and prolonged exposure times (17.Siegel D. McGuiness S. Winski S.L. Ross D. Pharmacogenetics. 1999; 9: 113-121Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). These cell lines, however, had no measurable NQO1 activity, since the mutant NQO1*2 protein has very low catalytic activity as compared with the wild-type NQO1*1 protein (11.Traver R.D. Siegel D. Beall H.D. Phillips R.M. Gibson N.W. Franklin W.A. Ross D. Br. J. Cancer. 1997; 75: 69-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar). We have recently demonstrated that the lack of NQO1*2 protein in tissues and cells from individuals carrying the homozygous NQO1*2/*2 polymorphism is due to rapid degradation of the mutant protein by the ubiquitin proteasomal pathway (UPP) (18.Siegel D. Anwar A. Winski S.L. Kepa J.K. Zolman K.L. Ross D. Mol. Pharmacol. 2001; 59: 263-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). Degradation of the mutant NQO1*2 protein by the UPP could be observed in both cells and cell-free systems, while the wild-type NQO1*1 protein demonstrated prolonged stability in both systems. The mechanisms underlying the differential stability of NQO1*1 and NQO1*2 proteins, however, remain to be characterized. Heat shock proteins (Hsp) and particularly the Hsp70 protein chaperone family play a key role in catalyzing protein folding. Hsp70, in association with Hsp40, binds hydrophobic regions of unfolded proteins, and through cycles of ATP-dependent binding and release by the Hsp70/40 complex, the nascent protein is manipulated into an active conformation (19.Hendricks J.P. Hartl F.U. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1993; 62: 349-384Crossref PubMed Scopus (1477) Google Scholar). The present investigation was initiated to examine the potential association of Hsp protein chaperones in the modulation of activity and stability of wild-type NQO1*1 and mutant NQO1*2 proteins. TNT-RRLs (SP6, Quick Coupled Transcription/Translation System) and untreated RRLs were purchased from Promega (Madison, WI). Apyrase (EC 3.6.1.5), E-64, PMSF, cycloheximide, bovine serum albumin, and 2,6-dicholorphenol-indophenol were purchased from Sigma. Protein A/G-agarose and clasto-lactacystin-β-lactone were obtained from Calbiochem. MG132 was purchased from Biomol Research Laboratories(Plymouth Meeting, PA). RIPA (protease inhibitor mixture) was obtained from Roche Diagnostics GmbH (Mannheim, Germany). Human recombinant NQO1 standard was purified from Escherichia coli by Cibacron blue affinity chromatography as described previously (11.Traver R.D. Siegel D. Beall H.D. Phillips R.M. Gibson N.W.

Commun. 1989; 161: 434-441Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). All other chemicals and reagents used in this study were of the highest purity grade available commercially. Anti-ubiquitin (rabbit polyclonal) was purchased from Sigma. Hsp-40 (SC-1800, goat polyclonal) was obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). Hsp70 (SPA-810, mouse monoclonal) was a product of Stressgen Biotechnologies Corp. (Victoria, British Columbia, Canada), and Hsp90 (Ab-1, rabbit polyclonal) was obtained from Neo Markers (Union City, CA). Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies were purchased from Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, Inc. (West Grove, PA). Hybridoma tissue culture supernatant (RPMI 1640 with 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum) containing anti-NQO1 mouse monoclonal antibody clones A180 and B771 (IgG) mixed 1:1 were used in the study. Both A180 and B771 anti-NQO1 monoclonal antibodies have demonstrated immunoreactivity toward NQO1*1 and NQO1*2 proteins (11.Traver R.D. Siegel D. Beall H.D. Phillips R.M. Gibson N.W. Franklin W.A. Ross D. Br. J. Cancer. 1997; 75: 69-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar). HT-29 (human colon carcinoma) and MDA-MB 231 (human breast carcinoma) cell lines were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA). Cells were grown as monolayers at 37 °C in 5% CO2 with minimal essential medium supplemented with 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum, 10 units/ml penicillin/streptomycin and 2 mml-glutamine. Human wild-type and mutant NQO1 coding regions were subcloned into the pSP64poly(A) expression vector (Promega) by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification of the full coding region using oligomers 5′-cccaagcttATGGTCGGCAGAAGAGCA-3′ and 5′-tgctctagaTCATTTTCTAGCTTTGATCTG-3′ containing HindIII andXbaI restriction sites, respectively. Plasmid pwtSP64poly(A) containing the wild-type NQO1*1 coding region of human NQO1 served as a template. The 822-bp fragment was amplified by PCR. The sequence of oligonucleotides that served as primers to introduce the isoleucine → aspartic acid mutation (I8D) into the human NQO1 coding region at amino acid position 8 are as follows: Primer 1, 5′-cccaagcttATGGTCGGCAGGAAAGAGCACTGACGTAGCTGGCTCAC-3′; Primer 2, 5′-tgctctagaTCATTTTCTAGCTTTGATCTG-3′. The altered bases are underlined and encode the mutated amino acid. The temperature cycles used for this PCR amplification were as follows: 95 °C for 5 min, 25 cycles of 95 °C for 1 min, 50 °C for 1 min, followed by 72 °C for 1 min. After the final cycle the reaction was kept at 4 °C. The resulting mutated product was then cut withHindIII and XbaI followed by subcloning into pSP64poly(A). The construct was verified by digestion and sequencing. This construct is referred henceforth as NQO1*1/I8D. NQO1 in vitrotranscription/translation was carried out using SP6 Quick Coupled Transcription/Translation System (TNT-RRL; Promega) according to the manufacturer's instructions using 1 μg of plasmid DNA. Reactions (50 μl) were carried out for 1 h at 32 °C, after which a small aliquot of reaction mixture was removed, and NQO1 protein translation was monitored by SDS-PAGE (21.Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207472) Google Scholar) followed by immunoblot analysis (see below). Prior to immunoprecipitation, apyrase (EC3.6.1.5, 5 units) was added and the TNT-RRLs placed on ice for 10 min. The reaction was terminated by the addition of 200 μl of RIPA buffer, and immunoprecipitation was carried out using the appropriate antibodies. Proteasome-mediated degradation of NQO1*1/I8D was assayed as described previously in untreated RRL (18.Siegel D. Anwar A. Winski S.L. Kepa J.K. Zolman K.L. Ross D. Mol. Pharmacol. 2001; 59: 263-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). NQO1*1/I8D was generated by in vitro transcription/translation (as described above), and 5 μl of reaction mixture was added to untreated RRLs to measure degradation (18.Siegel D. Anwar A. Winski S.L. Kepa J.K. Zolman K.L. Ross D. Mol. Pharmacol. 2001; 59: 263-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). Exponentially growing cells were seeded at ∼2 × 106 in 60-mm plates, and 12 h later the cells were harvested. For immunoprecipitation studies, medium was removed, and cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS, pH 7.4), lysed on ice in RIPA buffer (250 μl), then centrifuged at 13 K for 10 min. To this supernatant 200 μl of anti-NQO1 monoclonal antibody or 10 μg of anti-HSP antibody were added, and the mixture was gently rotated at 4 °C for 16 h. Protein A/G-agarose (40 μl) was then added, and the incubations were continued for an additional 90 min. The protein A/G-agarose was collected by centrifugation and the beads washed three times with 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, containing 150 mm NaCl, 1% (v/v) Nonidet P-40. The protein A/G-agarose beads were then suspended in 2× Laemmli SDS sample buffer and heated to 90 °C for 5 min. Immunoprecipitated proteins were analyzed by SDS-PAGE (12%, minigel) followed by transfer to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (0.4 μm) in 25 mmTris, 192 mm glycine, and 20% (v/v) methanol at 110 V for 1 h. Membranes were blocked overnight in 10 mmTris-HCl, pH 8.0, 125 mm NaCl, 0.2% (v/v) Tween 20 containing 5% (w/v) nonfat dry milk (TBST-M5). Immunoblot analysis of polyubiquitinated NQO1 was performed using anti-ubiquitin antibodies diluted at 1:100. Immunoblot analysis of Hsp proteins (Hsp40, Hsp70, and Hsp90) was performed using the following antibody dilutions; Hsp40 and Hsp90, 1:250; Hsp70, 1:1,500. Antibodies were diluted in 10 ml of TBST-M5 and incubated with membranes for 1 h at 27 °C. Horseradish peroxidase-labeled secondary antibodies were diluted at 1:5,000 in 20 ml of TBST-M5 and incubated for 30 min. For determinations of cellular levels of NQO1 and Hsp proteins, cells were scrapped, washed with PBS, collected in 200 μl of ice-cold RIPA buffer, and then lysed by sonication on ice. The supernatant was cleared by centrifugation at 13 K for 5 min, and the protein concentration was determined by the method of Lowry (22.Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Protein bands were visualized using enhanced chemiluminescence as described by the manufacturer (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Densitometric analysis of the membranes was performed using GelDoc 2000 (Bio-Rad). Cells were grown to 85% confluence in 60-mm dishes in complete minimal essential medium. Fresh medium (5 ml) containing various inhibitors MG132,clasto-lactacystin-β-lactone (LC), E-64, and PMSF were added to each plate, and the medium replaced with fresh inhibitor 3 h later. After 6 h of incubation with inhibitor, cells were washed with PBS and then lysed in ice-cold RIPA buffer. Protein concentrations were determined (22.Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and NQO1 levels were analyzed by immunoblot analysis. NQO1 protein stability was determined in the presence and absence of proteasomal inhibitor MG132. Approximately 2 × 107 cells were plated into 100-mm plates, and 12 h later fresh medium was added containing cycloheximide (50 μg/ml). At the indicated intervals, cells were scraped and pelleted by centrifugation. The cell pellet was washed with ice-cold PBS, pH 7.4, and then lysed in 500 μl of ice-cold RIPA buffer. Supernatant was collected by centrifugation at 13 K for 10 min. To this supernatant, 200 μl of anti-NQO1 monoclonal antibody was added, and the incubation was carried out for 1 h on a shaker at 4 °C, followed by the addition of 30 μl of protein A/G-conjugated agarose for an additional hour. Agarose beads were washed and processed for immunoblot analysis as described above. To assess NQO1 turnover in the presence of proteasomal inhibitor MG132, cells were treated with MG132 (10 μm) and cycloheximide (50 μg/ml) simultaneously. Proteasomal inhibitor and cycloheximide were present during the entire duration of the experiment. Aliquots (5 μl) of TNT-RRL reactions were diluted with 10 μl of ice-cold 25 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.4, containing 250 mm sucrose and 5 μm FAD. NQO1 activity was measured spectrophotometrically using 2,6-dichlorophenol-indophenol as the terminal electron acceptor as described previously (23.Benson A.M. Hunkelerm M.J. Talalay P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1980; 77: 5216-5220Crossref PubMed Scopus (786) Google Scholar). The effect of UPP inhibitors MG132 and clasto-lactacystin-β-lactone or non-proteasomal inhibitors PMSF (serine protease inhibitor) and E-64 (cysteine protease inhibitor) on NQO1 stability was examined in MDA-MB 231 human breast carcinoma cells, which have previously been genotyped as homozygous for the NQO1*2 allele (17.Siegel D. McGuiness S. Winski S.L. Ross D. Pharmacogenetics. 1999; 9: 113-121Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). NQO1 degradation was inhibited by the addition of MG132 or LC (Fig. 1A). In contrast, PMSF or E-64 had no effect on the degradation of NQO1. Several higher molecular weight, anti-NQO1 immunoreactive proteins could be observed after pretreatment with UPP inhibitors but not after pretreatment with PMSF or E-64 (Fig. 1B). The presence of higher molecular weight products after pretreatment with UPP inhibitors was consistent with the accumulation of polyubiquitinated forms of NQO1. Confirmation of the build up of high molecular weight polyubiquitinated proteins in samples treated with proteasomal inhibitors was demonstrated using an anti-ubiquitin antibody (Fig. 1C). The abundance of polyubiquitinated species was greatly enhanced when UPP was blocked by MG132 or LC (Fig. 1C, lanes 2–5). No accumulation of polyubiquitinated proteins could be detected following treatment with PMSF or E-64 (Fig. 1C, lanes 6 and7). In agreement with UPP-mediated degradation of NQO1*2, immunoprecipitation analysis using an anti-NQO1 monoclonal antibody followed by anti-ubiquitin immunoblot analysis confirmed the presence of polyubiquitinated NQO1*2 proteins in sonicates from MDA-MB 231 cells treated with proteasome inhibitors (Fig. 1D). The half-life of mutant NQO1 was investigated in MDA-MB 231 cells. Cells were pretreated with cycloheximide to inhibit de novo protein synthesis followed by treatment with LC to inhibit the UPP, and cell lysates were monitored for the disappearance of the NQO1*2 protein. Because of the low levels of NQO1*2 protein in MDA-MB 231 cells, we utilized NQO1 immunoprecipitation followed by NQO1 immunoblot analysis to increase the sensitivity of this assay. The half-life of the NQO1*2 protein was determined to be ∼1.5 h in MDA-MB 231 cells (Fig. 2A). This observation is in agreement with the short half-life of NQO1*2 protein in BE colon carcinoma cells, which are also homozygous for the NQO1*2 allele (18.Siegel D. Anwar A. Winski S.L. Kepa J.K. Zolman K.L. Ross D. Mol. Pharmacol. 2001; 59: 263-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). In contrast to the rapid degradation of the NQO1*2 protein, the wild-type NQO1*1 protein exhibits considerable stability and has a half-life of greater than 18 h in HT-29 cells (18.Siegel D. Anwar A. Winski S.L. Kepa J.K. Zolman K.L. Ross D. Mol. Pharmacol. 2001; 59: 263-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). Since the NQO1*2 protein is efficiently degraded by the UPP, inhibitors of the UPP such as MG132 would be predicted to increase the half-life of mutant NQO1. MDA-MB 231 cells were treated with both cycloheximide and MG132, and the rate of NQO1 degradation was followed by immunoprecipitation and immunoblot analysis (Fig. 2B). Treatment with MG132 led to increased stability of the NQO1*2 protein in MDA-MB 231 cells, and there was an approximately 4-fold increase in the half-life of the NQO1*2 protein as determined by the densitometric analysis of the blots (Fig. 2, A andB). To examine the potential role of the molecular chaperone Hsp70 in the differential stability of NQO1*1 and NQO1*2 proteins, we investigated whether an interaction between the different forms of NQO1 and Hsp70 could be observed. For this purpose, cell sonicates from HT-29 (NQO1*1/*1) and MDA-MB 231 (NQO1*2/*2) cells were analyzed by immunoprecipitation followed by immunoblot analysis. Immunoprecipitation was carried out using anti-NQO1 monoclonal antibodies, and the blots were probed with anti-Hsp70 monoclonal antibodies. In HT-29 cells an Hsp70·NQO1*1 protein complex could be co-immunoprecipitated using anti-NQO1 antibodies (Fig. 3A). No Hsp70·NQO1 complex was observed in MDA-MB 231 cells. To further confirm these observations, we used anti-Hsp70 antibodies to first carry out the immunoprecipitation, and the membrane was then probed with anti-NQO1 antibodies (Fig. 3B). Using this reverse immunoprecipitation, an association of Hsp70 could be observed with the NQO1*1 protein but not with the mutant NQO1*2 protein. Furthermore, increasing the cellular levels of mutant NQO1*2 protein in MDA-MB 231 cells following treatment with UPP inhibitors did not result in immunoprecipitation of an Hsp70·NQO1 complex (Fig. 4A). Treatment of HT-29 cells with UPP inhibitors had no effect on the levels of NQO1·Hsp70 complex (Fig. 4A). These experiments confirm that the molecular chaperone Hsp70 associates with the NQO1*1 protein in HT-29 cells but not with mutant NQO1*2 protein in MDA-MB 231 cells. Both HT-29 and MDA-MB 231 cells used in this study have approximately equivalent levels of Hsp70 (Fig. 4B). Since molecular chaperones such as Hsp70 can function as catalysts and are released from interactions with target proteins after the facilitation of correct folding, we investigated the time course of association of NQO1*1 and Hsp70.De novo protein synthesis was blocked by cycloheximide treatment in HT-29 cells, and samples were analyzed for the Hsp70·NQO1*1 complex. Samples were collected at the indicated times, and immunoprecipitation was carried out using anti-NQO1 antibodies followed by immunoblot analysis with anti-Hsp70 antibodies. Maximal interaction of Hsp70 and NQO1*1 was observed at 1 h; however, at later time points of 4 and 6 h the interaction between Hsp70 and NQO1 was markedly decreased (Fig. 5A). This suggested that the chaperone may interact with unfolded or a partially folded immature form of NQO1*1. Treatment of HT-29 cells with cycloheximide did not have a major effect on cellular levels of either Hsp70 or NQO1 for the duration of the experiment (Fig. 5, B and C). When the membranes were stripped and probed for Hsp40, we were able to detect the presence of Hsp40 in the immunoprecipitated complexes of NQO1*1 and Hsp70, suggesting the formation of a ternary complex of Hsp40, Hsp70, and NQO1 (data not shown, see below).Figure 4Effect of proteasome inhibitors on the association of NQO1 with Hsp70 in cells.

NQO1 Std, purified human recombinant NQO1 (5 ng).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The level of the NQO1*2 protein in cells homozygous for the NQO1*2 allele such as MDA-MB 231 cells is low relative to cell homozygous for the wild-type NQO1*1 allele. The inability to observe an association of the NQO1*2 protein with Hsp70 may, therefore, be explained by the low cellular levels of NQO1*2 protein in MDA-MB 231 cells. This explanation seemed unlikely, however, since an interaction between Hsp70 and the NQO1*2 protein could not be detected even in the presence of UPP inhibitors, which increased the cellular levels of the NQO1*2 protein (Fig. 4A). To circumvent this potential problem we generated recombinant NQO1*1 and NQO1*2 proteins using a coupled transcription/translation approach in a cell-free rabbit reticulocyte lysate (TNT-RRL) system. Association of Hsp70 with the wild-type NQO1*1 protein could be observed by immunoprecipitation using anti-NQO1 antibodies followed by immunoblotting with anti-Hsp70 antibodies (Fig. 6A, lane 4). In contrast, very little association of Hsp70 was detected with mutant NQO1*2 protein (Fig. 6A, lane 3). Immediately prior to immunoprecipitation, a small aliquot of the RRL reaction was removed for NQO1 immunoblot analysis, which demonstrated that plasmids containing coding regions for NQO1*1 and NQO1*2 proteins were transcribed and translated with approximately equal efficiency in the RRL system (Fig. 6B). Importantly, no association of Hsp70 with NQO1 could be detected when mature purified recombinant NQO1*1 protein was substituted for newly synthesized NQO1, suggesting association of Hsp70 with an early nascent form of NQO1 (Fig. 6A, lane 2). To further investigate the interaction of Hsp70 with NQO1, we examined the NQO1 amino acid sequence for potential Hsp70 binding sites. Previous work has identified a potential Hsp70 binding motif described by a central hydrophobic core region enriched in leucine and isoleucine and flanked by basic amino acids. In this model, acidic amino acids are excluded from the hydrophobic core and disfavored in flanking regions (24.Rudiger S. Buchberger A. Bukau B. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1997; 4: 342-349Crossref PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar, 25.Rudiger S. Germeroth L. Schneider-Mergener J. Bukau B. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 1501-1507Crossref PubMed Scopus (662) Google Scholar). Analysis of the NQO1*1 amino acid sequence revealed a potential Hsp70 binding site located near the N terminus of the NQO1 protein (Fig. 7A). Using site-directed mutagenesis we introduced an amino acid substitution (aspartic acid for isoleucine) at position 8 in the NQO1 protein. The plasmid encoding mutant NQO1*1/I8D was efficiently transcribed and translated in RRLs with almost equal efficiency to that of wild-type NQO1*1 (Fig. 7B). The mutant NQO1 protein, however, failed to interact with Hsp70 in vitro as demonstrated by co-immunoprecipitation studies (Fig. 7C). The catalytic activity of in vitro transcribed/translated NQO1*1, NQO1*2, and NQO1*1/I8D proteins was measured spectrophotometrically by following the reduction of 2,6-dicholorphenol-indophenol at 600 nm. Aliquots (5 μl) of RRL reactions were removed at regular intervals over 60 min and assayed for NQO1 catalytic activity. NQO1 protein expression was confirmed by immunoblot analysis as described previously (data not shown). Transcription/translation of the wild-type NQO1*1 coding region resulted in a time-dependent increase in NQO1 activity (Fig. 7D). Although RRL-mediated transcription/translation of either the NQO1*2 or NQO1*1/I8D coding regions produced full-length NQO1 products, both proteins failed to demonstrate catalytic activity, suggesting the functional role of Hsp70 interaction with NQO1*1 protein. The NQO1*1/I8D protein also underwent RRL-mediated degradation, and protein degradation was inhibited by the addition of MG132, suggesting that NQO1*1/I8D was degraded by the UPP (Fig. 7E). Since Hsp40 and Hsp90 are known to be co-chaperones of Hsp70 in the Hsp family, we also investigated the interactions of these chaperones with the NQO1*1 and NQO1*2 proteins. Co-immunoprecipitation studies were performed in HT-29 and MDA-MB 231 cells. Sonicated samples were immunoprecipitated using anti-Hsp40 antibodies followed by immunoblot analysis with anti-NQO1 antibodies. These co-IP experiments demonstrated an association between wild-type NQO1*1 protein and Hsp40, but no association was observed between Hsp40 and mutant NQO1*2 protein (Fig. 8A). These results are similar to data obtained for the interaction between Hsp70 and wild-type NQO1*1 protein, suggesting that Hsp40 may complex together with Hsp70 in their association with NQO1*1. The ternary complex of NQO1, Hsp40, and Hsp70 was confirmed by stripping the membrane shown in Fig. 8A and re-probing with anti-Hsp70 antibodies. The presence of Hsp70 in the immunoprecipitated complex could be observed in HT-29 cells but not MDA-MB 231 cells (Fig. 8B). The absence of an association of Hsp40 with NQO1 in MDA-MB 231 cells could not be explained by the cellular levels of Hsp40, since greater levels of Hsp40 could be detected in MDA-MB 231 cells than in HT-29 cells (Fig. 8C). Using similar co-IP studies, however, we failed to detect an association of NQO1*1 or NQO1*2 proteins with Hsp90 in HT-29 and MDA-MB 231 cell lines or RRLs (data not shown). It is well known that misfolded proteins are substrates for the UPP. Inhibition of the 26 S proteasome results in an increase in the amount of NQO1*2 protein and a build up of higher molecular weight NQO1 immunoreactive species consistent with the formation of polyubiquitinated NQO1 proteins. Treatment of MDA-MB 231 cells with inbibitors of the 26 S proteasome also results in an increase in the half-life of the NQO1*2 protein, clearly demonstrating the role of the UPP in degradation of the mutant NQO1*2 protein. The shortened half-life of the mutant NQO1*2 protein (1.5 h) is in contrast to the stability of wild-type NQO1*1 protein, which has a half-life of greater than 18 h (18.Siegel D. Anwar A. Winski S.L. Kepa J.K. Zolman K.L. Ross D. Mol. Pharmacol. 2001; 59: 263-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). In an attempt to understand possible mechanisms underlying the differential stability of NQO1*1 and NQO1*2 proteins, we have investigated a potential role for the involvement of molecular chaperones of the heat shock protein family (Hsp). Molecular chaperones have been implicated in a wide variety of cellular processes including protein folding, protein transport, and protein degradation (26.Hartl F.U. Nature. 1996; 381: 571-580Crossref PubMed Scopus (3129) Google Scholar, 27.Landry S.J. Jordan R. McMacken R. Gierasch L.M.

Chem. 1997; 272: 9002-9010Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). In co-immunoprecipitation studies using cellular systems, we found that Hsp70 associated with the wild-type NQO1*1 protein but not with the mutant NQO1*2 protein. To confirm these observations in a cell-free system, we performed similar experiments employing RRLs in an in vitro coupled transcription/translation system. Our results demonstrated that although approximately equivalent amounts of NQO1*1 and NQO1*2 proteins were generated in RRLs, interaction of Hsp70 could only be observed with wild-type NQO1*1 but not with mutant NQO1*2 protein. Hsp70-catalyzed protein folding requires ATP hydrolysis and often involves the presence of co-chaperones such as Hsp40 and Hsp90 (19.Hendricks J.P. Hartl F.U. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1993; 62: 349-384Crossref PubMed Scopus (1477) Google Scholar, 30.Frydman J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2001; 70: 603-647Crossref PubMed Scopus (942) Google Scholar). In the co-immunoprecipitated complex of NQO1 and Hsp70, Hsp40 could also be detected, suggesting the presence of a ternary complex. No interaction, however, could be observed between NQO1*1 or NQO1*2 proteins and Hsp90, demonstrating that there is some degree of specificity to the interactions of NQO1 and the proteins of the Hsp family. In protein folding interactions, molecular chaperones such as Hsp70 are believed to bind with the target substrate, facilitate correct folding, and then dissociate from the complex (19.Hendricks J.P. Hartl F.U. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1993; 62: 349-384Crossref PubMed Scopus (1477) Google Scholar, 28.Fung K.L. Hilgenberg L. Wang N.M. Chirico W.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 21559-21565Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). In HT-29 cells, time course studies demonstrated that the Hsp70·NQO1 complex was greatly reduced after 4 h following the inhibition of protein synthesis. In addition, RRL experiments using in vitrotranscription/translation demonstrated that Hsp70 did associate with newly synthesized NQO1*1 protein; however, Hsp70 failed to interact with mature recombinant NQO1*1. The association of Hsp70 and NQO1*1 in cells and in cell-free systems, therefore, most probably reflects the association of Hsp70 with a precursor form of the mature NQO1 protein that has not been fully and completely folded (Fig. 9). These results are consistent with the proposed role of Hsp70 in protein folding (30.Frydman J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2001; 70: 603-647Crossref PubMed Scopus (942) Google Scholar) and are the first demonstration that chaperones interact with NQO1. Additional evidence linking Hsp70 with NQO1 has come from site-directed mutagenesis studies of a proposed Hsp70 binding motif located near the N terminus of the NQO1 protein. Studies with Dna K, the E. coli homologue of human Hsp70, has identified binding motifs in the substrate proteins that associate with Dna K (25.Rudiger S. Germeroth L. Schneider-Mergener J. Bukau B. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 1501-1507Crossref PubMed Scopus (662) Google Scholar, 30.Frydman J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2001; 70: 603-647Crossref PubMed Scopus (942) Google Scholar). The binding motifs consist of a hydrophobic core of four to five residues enriched in leucine, isoleucine, and valine and two flanking regions enriched in basic residues. Acidic residues are excluded from the core and disfavored in the flanking regions. A search of the human, mouse, and rat NQO1 amino acid sequences revealed the presence of an identical Dna K binding site (R4R5A6L7I8V9L10A11H12) located near the N terminus of the protein. Site-directed mutagenesis was used in combination with in vitrotranscription/translation to generate a human NQO1*1 protein where isoleucine was replaced with aspartic acid at position 8 of the amino acid sequence (NQO1*1/I8D). As predicted from the proposed model, the insertion of an acidic residue into the hydrophobic core resulted in the loss of binding of NQO1*1/I8D to Hsp70. The resultant in vitro translated NQO1*1/I8D protein had no measurable catalytic activity and was degraded by the UPP system demonstrating the functional role of the interaction of Hsp70 with NQO1. In addition, an examination of the x-ray crystal structure of recombinant human NQO1 has revealed that the Dna K binding site is not directly exposed to the surface in the mature protein (31.Faig M. Bianchet M.A. Talalay P. Chen S. Winski S. Ross D. Amzel M.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 3177-3182Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). This is confirmed by the absence of an association between mature NQO1*1 and Hsp70. These data further implicate a role for Hsp70 in the folding of immature NQO1 into an active protein. It is also possible that introduction of an acidic amino acid residue into the N terminus of the NQO1 amino acid sequence might have interfered with the catalytic function of the enzyme. This seems unlikely, however, since the addition of positively charged residues to the N terminus of NQO1 in the form of a 6×-His-tag did not result in significant loss of enzymatic activity as compared with the NQO1*1 protein (32.Cui K. Lu A.Y.H. Yang C.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 1043-1047Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). 2D. Siegel and J. K. Kepa, unpublished data. The His-tagged NQO1*1 protein had ∼70% of the catalytic activity of the wild-type NQO1*1 protein and was not degraded by the UPP, while in contrast the NQO1*1/I8D protein was a target of UPP-mediated degradation. The absence of an association between Hsp70/40 and mutant NQO1*2 protein suggests that the proline to serine amino acid substitution in the NQO1*2 protein prevents binding of Hsp70 to the mutant protein. X-ray crystallographic studies have shown that this substitution is located near the transition of a β-sheet and an α-helical bend. The proline to serine substitution may disrupt the confirmation of the NQO1*2 protein preventing recognition and association with Hsp70/40, resulting in misfolding and subsequent UPP-meditated degradation. Alternatively, it has been proposed that the proline to serine amino acid change results in disruption of the central parallel β-sheet, resulting in a decreased affinity of the protein for the FAD cofactor (33.Wu K. Deng P.S.K. Chen S. Yagi K. Pathology of Lipid Peroxides and Realated Free Radicals. Japan Scientific Societies Press, Tokyo1998: 135-148Google Scholar). It is conceivable that the inability of NQO1*2 protein to efficiently bind FAD prevents the association of the mutant protein with Hsp70/40. Studies are under way to determine whether an association with Hsp70/40 facilitates incorporation of FAD into NQO1 proteins. In summary, we have demonstrated an association of Hsp70 and Hsp40 with wild-type NQO1 but not mutant NQO1*2 protein. Given the documented role for Hsp70/40 in protein folding (30.Frydman J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2001; 70: 603-647Crossref PubMed Scopus (942) Google Scholar, 34.Lu Z. Cyr D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 5970-5978Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar), we hypothesize a role for Hsp70/40 in the differential stability of NQO1*1 and NQO1*2 proteins (Fig. 9). This proposed model will allow for the design of future experiments to characterize the structural motifs that govern the interaction of Hsp and NQO1 proteins."
https://openalex.org/W2112370603,"PEG1 (or MEST) is an imprinted gene located on human chromosome 7q32 that is expressed predominantly from the paternal allele. In the mouse,Peg1/Mest is associated with embryonic growth and maternal behavior. Human PEG1 is transcribed from two promoters; the transcript from promoter P1 is derived from both parental alleles, and the transcript from P2 is exclusively from the paternal allele. We characterized the P1 and P2 transcripts in various normal and neoplastic tissues. In the normal tissues, PEG1was transcribed from both promoters P1 and P2, whereas in six of eight neoplastic tissues, PEG1 was transcribed exclusively from promoter P1. Bisulfite sequencing demonstrated high levels of CpG methylation in the P2 region of DNA from a lung tumor. In the region between P1 and P2, we identified a novel transcript,PEG1-AS, in an antisense orientation toPEG1. PEG1-AS is a spliced transcript and was detected as a strong 2.4-kilobase band on a Northern blot.PEG1-AS and PEG1 P2-sense transcript were expressed exclusively from the paternal allele. Fragments of DNA from within the 1.5-kilobase region betweenPEG1-AS and the P2 exon were ligated to a pGL3 luciferase reporter vector and transfected into NCI H23 cells. This DNA exhibited strong promoter activity in both the sense and antisense directions, indicating that PEG1-AS and P2 exon share a common promoter region. Treatment of the transfected DNA fragments with CpG methylase abolished the promoter activity. Of interest,PEG1-AS was expressed predominantly in testis and in mature motile spermatozoa, indicating a possible role for this transcript in human sperm physiology and fertilization. PEG1 (or MEST) is an imprinted gene located on human chromosome 7q32 that is expressed predominantly from the paternal allele. In the mouse,Peg1/Mest is associated with embryonic growth and maternal behavior. Human PEG1 is transcribed from two promoters; the transcript from promoter P1 is derived from both parental alleles, and the transcript from P2 is exclusively from the paternal allele.

In the cytochromes c, the heme is attached to the protein via thioether bonds between the original heme vinyl groups and two of the cysteine residues (1.Moore G.R. Pettigrew G.W. Rich A. Cytochromes c: Evolutionary, Structural, and Physiochemical Aspects. Springer-Verlag, Berlin1990Crossref Google Scholar). In the mammalian peroxidases, the heme is linked to the protein via two ester bonds involving aspartate or glutamic acid residues and hydroxyl groups on two of the original heme methyl groups (2.Fiedler T.J.

The heme is bound to the CYP4A proteins via a conserved glutamic acid residue on the I-helix of the protein (16.Hoch U. Ortiz de Montellano P.R. J. Biol.

BLAST searches of protein data banks show that the amino acid context of this glutamic acid, EGHDTT, is highly conserved in the CYP4A family (Table I). This conserved sequence is present in species that range from Drosophila to humans. The CYP4 family is one of the most ancient in the P450 superfamily, having originated over 1 billion years ago before the divergence of invertebrates and vertebrates (15.Simpson A.E.C.M. Gen. Pharmacol. 1997; 28: 351-359Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar). None of the known P450 families outside of the CYP4 family has a glutamic acid residue at the indicated position. In this paper, we identify the site on the heme that is involved in covalent bond formation, demonstrate that heme binding is the result of an autocatalytic process, and explore the consequences of covalent heme attachment to the protein in the P450 system.Table IThe EGHDTT sequence in the I-helix is highly conserved in the CYP4 familyProteinSequenceCYP4A1 (rat)FMFEGHDTTASGCYP4A2 (rat)FMFEGHDTTASGCYP4A3 (rat)FMFEGHDTTASGCYP4A4 (rabbit)FMFEGHDTTASGCYP4A5 (rabbit)FMFEGHDTTASGCYP4A6 (rabbit)FMGEGHDTTASGCYP4A7 (rabbit)FMFEGHDTTASGCYP4A8 (rat)FMFEGHDTTASGCYP4A11 (human)FMFEGHDTTASGCYP4AE1 (drosophilae)FIFEGHDTTTSAVCYP4B1 (human)FMFEGHDTTTSGCYP4B1 (mouse)FMFEGHDTTTSGCYP4B1 (rabbit)FMFEGHDTTTSGCYP4B1 (rat)FMFEGHDTTTSGCYP4C1 (cockroach)FMFEGHDTTSAGCYP4C3 (drosophilae)FMFEGHDTTSAACYP4D1 (drosophilae)FMFEGHDTTSSACYP4D1 (drosophilae)FMFEGHDTTSSACYP4D2 (drosophilae)FMFEGHDTTTSACYP4D8 (drosophilae)FMFEGHDTTTSACYP4D10 (drosophilae)FMFEGHDTTSSGCYP4D14 (drosophilae)FMFEGHDTTTSSCYP4E1 (drosophilae)FMFEGHDTTTSGCYP4E2 (drosophilae)FMFEGHDTTTSGCYP4E3 (drosophilae)FMFEGHDTTTSGCYP4E5 (drosophilae)FMFEGHDTTTSGCYP4F1 (rat)FMFEGHDTTASGCYP4F2 (human)FMFEGHDTTASGCYP4F3 (human)FMFEGHDTTASGCYP4F4 (rat)FMFEGHDTTASGCYP4F21 (ram)FMFEGHDTTASGCYP4G1 (drosophilae)IMFEGHDTTSAGCYP4G15 (drosophilae)IMFEGHDTTAAGCYP4S3 (drosophilae)FMFEGHDTTSSA Open table in a new tab DISCUSSIONPrevious investigations have demonstrated that the prosthetic heme group of several proteins of the CYP4 family is covalently bound to the protein. Although the studies were carried out primarily with proteins heterologously expressed either in Escherichia coli (16.Hoch U. Ortiz de Montellano P.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 11339-11346Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar) or a baculovirus system (17.Henne K.R. Kunze K.L. Zheng Y.M. Christmas P. Soberman R.J. Rettie A.E. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 12925-12931Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar), the extent of covalent binding was found to be as high or higher in CYP4A1 isolated from rat liver (16.Hoch U. Ortiz de Montellano P.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 11339-11346Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Covalent binding is thus not an artifact of heterologous expression. The site of covalent attachment was shown by proteolytic experiments to be a conserved glutamic acid residue in the I-helix (16.Hoch U. Ortiz de Montellano P.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 11339-11346Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). However, the nature of the covalent link and the site on the heme involved in covalent attachment were not determined.The present studies confirm the role of the glutamic acid, establish that it is the unique site of attachment of the heme to the protein, and demonstrate that the link to the heme involves a hydroxyl group on the 5-methyl of the heme (Fig. 5). Thus, mutation of the glutamic acid to an alanine in CYP4A1, CYP4A3, and CYP4A11 yields proteins with normal Fe2+–CO absorption spectra at 450 nm but in which covalent binding of the heme is completely suppressed (Fig. 1). Furthermore, replacement of the glutamic acid by a glutamine, a substitution that preserves the bulk of the side chain but eliminates the carboxylic acid terminus, yields a protein that again absorbs at 450 nm in the Fe2+–CO state but in which no more than a trace of the heme is covalently bound (Fig. 1). It is clear from these experiments that the carboxylic acid moiety of the glutamic acid is critical for the covalent attachment process.Mutation of the indicated glutamic acid to an alanine in the CYP4A proteins results in a blue shift of the Soret band (Table II). A blue shift is also observed when the carboxylic acid residues that covalently bind to the heme are mutated in myeloperoxidase (Glu242 → Gln and Asp94 → Asn) (24.Jacquet A. Garcia-Quintana L. Deleersnyder V. Fenna R. Bollen A. Moguilevsky N. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 202: 73-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar) and lactoperoxidase (Glu375 → Gln) (12.Suriano G. Watanabe S. Ghibaudi E.M. Bollen A. Ferrari R.P. Moguilevsky N. Bioorg. Med. Chem. Lett. 2001; 11: 2827-2831Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). These mutations clearly affect the spectral properties of the protein. However, when the mutants retain a carboxylic acid at the site of attachment, as in CYP4A3/E318D (Table II) or a lactoperoxidase mutant (7.Colas C. Kuo J.M. Ortiz de Montellano P.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 7191-7200Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar), the Soret band is not shifted. The differences observed with the neutral substitutions could reflect the presence versus absence of the covalent bond, but could simply be due to differences in the active site polarity or water occupancy caused by the mutations.Pronase digestion of CYP4A8, using a sample with a high degree of covalent heme binding, led to isolation of the modified prosthetic group. Previous mass spectrometric analysis of this prosthetic group established that its mass corresponded to that of heme plus an oxygen atom (16.Hoch U. Ortiz de Montellano P.R. J. Biol.

As the absorption spectrum of the isolated heme was essentially the same as that of heme itself, the modified heme group was tentatively identified as a monohydroxylated heme. The site of hydroxylation could not be determined from the mass spectrometric data, but has been identified in the present experiments by comparison of the prosthetic group released proteolytically from the protein with authentic samples of the 1-hydroxymethyl-, 5-hydroxymethyl-, and 8-hydroxymethylheme derivatives (Fig. 3). The isolated prosthetic group has exactly the same retention time as 5-hydroxymethyl and a retention time well resolved from those of the 1- and 8-hydroxymethyl standards. In view of this chromatographic comparison and the earlier mass spectrometric and spectroscopic evidence (16.Hoch U. Ortiz de Montellano P.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 11339-11346Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar), it is clear that the heme is linked to the protein via a hydroxyl group on the 5-methyl of the heme. It is virtually certain, therefore, that the heme-protein link is an ester bond involving the carboxylic moiety of the glutamic acid and the hydroxyl on the heme (Fig. 5).When Glu318 in CYP4A3 is replaced by an aspartic acid, the side chain is shortened by one methylene group. This mutation greatly decreases covalent binding of the heme but, unlike the alanine mutation, does not completely suppress it. Only 6% of the heme is covalently bound, in contrast to the 68% observed with the wild-type protein. As a consequence, 47% of the prosthetic group in the CYP4A3/E318D mutant is unmodified heme. The most interesting finding, however, is that 47% of the prosthetic group is present as 5-hydroxymethylheme that is not covalently bound (Fig. 3)! HPLC analysis shows that the site of the hydroxyl moiety is the same in the covalently bound and noncovalently bound but modified heme group. The decrease in covalent binding due to the aspartate substitution reinforces the conclusion that the glutamic acid carboxylic acid group is required for covalent bond formation. More importantly, the finding that the substitution produces a substantial yield of modified but noncovalently bound prosthetic group considerably clarifies the mechanism of covalent bond formation (see below).A major finding is that the extent of covalent binding of the heme to the protein increases with time when the recombinant enzyme is incubated under catalytic turnover conditions. Increases of 12%, 49%, and 10% were observed with CYP4A2, CYP4A8, and CYP4A11, respectively. These increases were absolutely dependent on catalytic turnover, as they did not occur when NADPH was omitted from the incubation system. Larger increases in covalent binding were difficult to observe, because the heme was already partially covalently bound, limiting the possible increase, and because incubation under turnover conditions also leads with time to inactivation of the protein. Nevertheless, the results clearly indicate that the heme is covalently bound to the protein through an autocatalytic process. Autocatalytic formation of an ester bond between the 5-methyl of the heme and the glutamic acid carboxyl moiety is likely to involve trapping of a heme 5-methyl carbocation by the carboxylic acid group. Support for this mechanism is provided by the finding that substantial amounts of noncovalently bound 5-hydroxymethylheme are formed when the glutamic acid is replaced by an aspartate group (Fig. 3). Shortening the chain that tethers the carboxylic acid group to the protein backbone apparently decreases its ability to compete with water for trapping of the carbocation, resulting in covalent binding of the prosthetic group when the carboxylic acid group is successful, but formation of noncovalently bound 5-hydroxymethylheme when the carbocation is trapped by a water molecule in the enlarged active site. Radical and acid-base mechanisms can be written for formation of the 5-methyl carbocation, but the available evidence does not allow a distinction to be made between the possible routes to this critical intermediate.The autocatalytic mechanism demonstrated here for covalent attachment of the heme in CYP4 enzymes resembles that for covalent linking of the prosthetic group to the protein in the mammalian peroxidases (6.DePillis G.D. Ozaki S. Kuo J.M. Maltby D.A. Ortiz de Montellano P.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 8857-8860Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar, 7.Colas C. Kuo J.M. Ortiz de Montellano P.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 7191-7200Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). There are two obvious differences, however. Covalent binding of the heme to the protein in lactoperoxidase involves two rather than one ester bond, one between Asp225 and the 5-methyl group and the other between Glu375 and the 1-methyl group (25.Rae T.D. Goff H.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 27968-27977Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). A second significant difference is that autocatalytic cross-linking of the heme in the mammalian peroxidases is promoted by reaction with H2O2, whereas the reaction in the CYP4A enzymes involves reaction with oxygen and NADPH-cytochrome P450 reductase. It is nevertheless likely that the basic mechanism will be the same in both systems, i.e. activation via a ferryl species of the methyl group to a carbocationic intermediate that is subsequently trapped by the appropriate carboxylic acid side chain (Fig. 5).No crystal structure is available of a CYP4 protein, but a state of the art CYP4A11 homology model has been constructed by Chang and Loew (26.Chang Y.T. Loew G.H. Proteins. 1999; 34: 403-415Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Although it is necessary to keep in mind the shortcomings of P450 homology models, the carboxylic acid side chain of Glu321in the CYP4A11 model is closer by 1–2 Å to the 5- and 8-methyl groups of the heme than the 1- and 3-methyls. In the model, the 5- and 8-methyl groups are both ∼7.7 Å from the critical glutamic acid residue. The model is thus consistent with formation of a covalent link to either the 5- or 8-methyl group, but is not sufficiently accurate to distinguish between these two positions.Does covalent heme binding influence the catalytic function of CYP4 enzymes? The apparent kcat for lauric acid hydroxylation decreases from 150 to 54 min−1 when Glu320 is mutated to an alanine in CYP4A1, and from 77 to 3.4 min−1 when Glu318 is similarly mutated in CYP4A3 (Table III). However, mutating Glu321 to an alanine in CYP4A11 does not alter the lauric acid hydroxylation activity. These results clearly demonstrate that covalent heme binding is important, but not absolutely required, for the catalytic activity of CYP4A1 and particularly CYP4A3. In the case of CYP4A11, covalent heme binding is not a detectable determinant of the rate of lauric acid hydroxylation. Analysis of the binding of imidazole and lauric acid to the mutant and wild-type proteins reinforces these conclusions. Thus, the binding of imidazole is significantly decreased in all the mutants relative to the wild-type proteins (Table IV). More interestingly, the binding of lauric acid is also decreased in the CYP4A1 and CYP4A3, but not CYP4A11 mutants. The fact that both the wild-type and mutant proteins consist of mixtures of covalently and noncovalently bound heme complicates the quantitative interpretation of these ligand binding alterations, but the qualitative conclusion that the CYP4A1 and CYP4A3 protein active sites are more sensitive to covalent binding of the heme than the CYP4A11 protein appears warranted.It must be kept in mind, of course, that covalent binding of the heme group may influence other properties of the CYP4A enzymes than their catalytic activity with lauric acid. A BLAST search of the protein data bases for the glutamic acid residue and its conserved context (EGHDTT) indicates that it is highly (but not absolutely) conserved in the CYP4 family (Table I). This high degree of conservation of the glutamic group suggests that covalent heme binding may be important in other aspects of CYP4A function, particularly those that are relevant to its in vivo function. However, no conclusions can yet be made relative to alternative functions of covalent heme binding in the CYP4A family.In summary, we have provided evidence that the covalent link to the heme in the CYP4A proteins is an ester bond between a glutamic acid residue and a hydroxyl group on the 5-methyl of the heme, that the covalent bond is formed by an autocatalytic process probably involving trapping of a carbocationic intermediate by the glutamic acid, and that covalent binding is important for lauric acid oxidation in some but not all CYP4A enzymes. It has been known for some time that the prosthetic heme1 group is covalently bound to the protein in both the cytochromes c and the mammalian peroxidases. In the cytochromes c, the heme is attached to the protein via thioether bonds between the original heme vinyl groups and two of the cysteine residues (1.Moore G.R. Pettigrew G.W. Rich A. Cytochromes c: Evolutionary, Structural, and Physiochemical Aspects. Springer-Verlag, Berlin1990Crossref Google Scholar). In the mammalian peroxidases, the heme is linked to the protein via two ester bonds involving aspartate or glutamic acid residues and hydroxyl groups on two of the original heme methyl groups (2.Fiedler T.J. Davey C.A. Fenna R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 11964-11971Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar). In addition, in myeloperoxidase a third covalent link is present between a methionine sulfur atom and one of the heme vinyl groups (2.Fiedler T.J. Davey C.A. Fenna R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 11964-11971Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar, 3.Fenna R. Zeng J. Davey C. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1995; 316: 653-656Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). Formation of the covalent bonds between the heme and the protein in the cytochromes c requires the intervention of several proteins specifically devoted to that task (4.Page M.D. Sambongi Y.

Acta. 2000; 1459: 316-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). In contrast, recent work from this laboratory has demonstrated that the covalent bonds in lactoperoxidase are formed via an autocatalytic process when the noncovalent heme-protein complex reacts with H2O2 (6.DePillis G.D.

Evidence that similar autocatalytic processes mediate covalent attachment of the heme groups in the eosinophil and thyroid peroxidases has subsequently been reported (8.Fayadat L. Niccoli-Sire P.

Structure (Lond.). 1999; 7: R281-R290Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar), as removal of one or both of the covalent links to the heme by site-specific mutagenesis has little apparent effect on the properties of the protein (11.Tomlinson E.J. Ferguson S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 32530-32534Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). In contrast, recent work has shown that one covalent link is expendable in lactoperoxidase (7.Colas C. Kuo J.M. Ortiz de Montellano P.R. J. Biol.

We recently established that the heme is covalently bound to the protein in the CYP4A family of proteins (16.Hoch U. Ortiz de Montellano P.R. J. Biol.

The heme is bound to the CYP4A proteins via a conserved glutamic acid residue on the I-helix of the protein (16.Hoch U. Ortiz de Montellano P.R. J. Biol.

BLAST searches of protein data banks show that the amino acid context of this glutamic acid, EGHDTT, is highly conserved in the CYP4A family (Table I). This conserved sequence is present in species that range from Drosophila to humans. The CYP4 family is one of the most ancient in the P450 superfamily, having originated over 1 billion years ago before the divergence of invertebrates and vertebrates (15.Simpson A.E.C.M. Gen. Pharmacol. 1997; 28: 351-359Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar). None of the known P450 families outside of the CYP4 family has a glutamic acid residue at the indicated position. In this paper, we identify the site on the heme that is involved in covalent bond formation, demonstrate that heme binding is the result of an autocatalytic process, and explore the consequences of covalent heme attachment to the protein in the P450 system. DISCUSSIONPrevious investigations have demonstrated that the prosthetic heme group of several proteins of the CYP4 family is covalently bound to the protein. Although the studies were carried out primarily with proteins heterologously expressed either in Escherichia coli (16.Hoch U. Ortiz de Montellano P.R. J. Biol.

However, the enzymatic coupling between prolactin receptors and Stat5 in this process has not been established. In addition to Jak2, several other tyrosine kinases reportedly also are associated with prolactin receptors and may phosphorylate Stat5. Because Jak2 null mice die in utero, we targeted Jak2 in an ex vivo model of prolactin-induced mammary epithelial cell differentiation to determine the role of Jak2 in regulation of cell differentiation and growth. Two independent targeting strategies were used to suppress Jak2 in immortalized HC11 mouse mammary epithelial cells: 1) stable expression of a specific Jak2 antisense construct and 2) adenoviral delivery of a dominant-negative Jak2 gene. We now demonstrate that Jak2 is essential for prolactin-induced differentiation and activation of Stat5 in normal mouse mammary epithelial cells. Furthermore, suppression of Jak2 in HC11 cells was associated with constitutive activation of oncoprotein Stat3 and a hyperproliferative phenotype characterized by increased mitotic rate, reduced apoptosis, and reduced contact inhibition. Collectively, our data suggest that Jak2 is differentiation-inducing and growth-inhibitory in normal mammary epithelial cells, observations that may shed new light on the role of the Jak2-Stat5 pathway in breast cancer.

Chem. 2000; 275: 33937-33944Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Experimental testing of the importance of Jak2 for prolactin-induced differentiation of mammary epithelial cells is therefore warranted. Furthermore, because Jak2 is oncogenic in hematopoietic cells (15.Lacronique V. Boureux A. Monni R. Dumon S. Mauchauffe M. Mayeux P. Gouilleux F. Berger R. Gisselbrecht S. Ghysdael J. Bernard O.A. Blood. 2000; 95: 2076-2083Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), it is also critical to establish the role of Jak2 in regulating growth of normal mammary epithelial cells.In this study, we targeted Jak2 in an ex vivomodel of prolactin-induced mammary epithelial cell differentiation to determine the role of Jak2 in cell differentiation and growth. Two distinct targeting strategies were used to suppress Jak2 in immortalized HC11 mouse mammary epithelial cells. First, an effectiveJak2 antisense construct was generated and stably introduced into HC11 cells. Second, a functional dominant-negative Jak2mutant was generated and introduced into HC11 cells by adenoviral delivery. We now report that Jak2 is essential for prolactin-induced differentiation and activation of transcription factor Stat5 in normal HC11 mouse mammary epithelial cells. Importantly, suppression of Jak2 in HC11 cells was associated with a hyperproliferative phenotype characterized by increased mitotic rate, reduced apoptosis, and reduced contact inhibition. In addition, constitutive activation of Stat3 was associated with suppression of Jak2 in HC11 cells. Collectively, our data suggest that Jak2 mediates growth-suppressive and differentiation-inducing effects on normal mouse mammary epithelial cells. These observations may provide important new insight into the role of the prolactin-activated Jak2-Stat5 pathway in breast cancer.DISCUSSIONThe present study used adenoviral delivery of dominant-negative Jak2 and stable expression ofJak2 antisense mRNA to identify Jak2 as a critical mediator of prolactin-induced differentiation of nontransformed HC11 mammary epithelial cells. The associated disruption of prolactin-induced Stat5 activation most likely represents the key molecular mechanism responsible for disrupting prolactin-induced differentiation. Furthermore, targeted suppression of Jak2 in HC11 cells led to a hyperproliferative phenotype, suggesting that Jak2 exerts a growth-inhibitory influence on normal mammary epithelial cells. Whereas suppression of Jak2 did not lead to transformation of HC11 cells, Jak2 suppression did, however, reduce contact inhibition and extend cell survival under anchorage-independent growth conditions. Stat3 was constitutively activated in hyperproliferative, Jak2-suppressed HC11 mammary epithelial cells, and this activation of Stat3, a known oncogene (23.Bromberg J.F. Wrzeszczynska M.H. Devgan G.

Cell. 1999; 98: 295-303Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2472) Google Scholar), may contribute to the hyperproliferative phenotype.Jak2 as a Mediator of Prolactin-induced DifferentiationWe originally identified Jak2 as the prolactin-associated tyrosine kinase in Nb2 lymphoma cells (3.Rui H.

Chem. 1992; 267: 24076-24081Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Although other Jak tyrosine kinases reportedly are not activated by prolactin receptors, numerous studies indicate that prolactin may activate other, non-Jak tyrosine kinases. These include tyrosine kinases Fyn (10.Clevenger C.V. Medaglia M.V. Mol. Endocrinol. 1994; 8: 674-681Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), Src (11.Berlanga J.J. Fresno Vara J.A. Martin-Perez J. Garcia-Ruiz J.P. Mol. Endocrinol. 1995; 9: 1461-1467Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), Tec (13.Kline J.B. Moore D.J. Clevenger C.V. Mol. Endocrinol. 2001; 15: 832-841Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar), and focal adhesion kinase (12.Canbay E. Norman M. Kilic E. Goffin V. Zachary I. Biochem. J. 1997; 324: 231-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). In most cases, temporal activation profiles suggest that prolactin activates Jak2 upstream of the non-Jak tyrosine kinases, but at least one report indicated that prolactin can activate Src independent of Jak2 (26.Fresno Vara J.A. Carretero M.V. Geronimo H. Ballmer-Hofer K. Martin-Perez J. Biochem. J. 2000; 345: 17-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Consequently, the notion that all prolactin-induced effects are mediated by Jak2 may not be correct. Therefore, it was of particular importance to determine whether Jak2 mediates prolactin-induced differentiation of mammary epithelial cells.The present study now provides direct evidence that Jak2, in fact, is critical for mammary epithelial cell differentiation. After establishing that prolactin activated Jak2, and not other Jaks, in HC11 cells, and that concentration-dependent induction of cell differentiation by prolactin correlated with Jak2 activation, two independent strategies were used in vitro for targeted suppression of Jak2. These included construction of two sets of novel reagents, a vector for stable or transient expression of a novel and specific Jak2 antisense-mRNA, and a replication-defective adenovirus for efficient gene delivery of Dn-Jak2. Both sets of molecular tools were validated and determined to be effective in independent experiments, and both strategies independently demonstrated that Jak2 is critical for prolactin-induced differentiation by selectively disrupting mammosphere formation. Disruption of prolactin-induced differentiation was not associated with any general cytotoxic effects, because suppression of Jak2 by either strategy led to increased proliferation rates and reduced cellular apoptosis. Furthermore, the described molecular tools may be applied to determine whether Jak2 is critical for biological effects of other cytokine receptors in a variety of cell types.Evidence That Jak2 Phosphorylates and Activates Stat5 in HC11 CellsTranscription factor Stat5, and especially the Stat5a isoform, is critical for mammary gland differentiation (6.Liu X. Robinson G.W. Wagner K.U. Garrett L. Wynshaw-Boris A. Hennighausen L. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 179-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (909) Google Scholar). Stat5 is phosphorylated on a single tyrosine residue following prolactin receptor activation, and this modification causes Stat5 to dimerize, which in turn is needed for DNA binding and transcriptional regulation (4.Wakao H. Gouilleux F. Groner B. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 2182-2191Crossref PubMed Scopus (712) Google Scholar). Jak2 is presumed to mediate prolactin-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of Stat5 (22.Gouilleux F. Wakao H. Mundt M. Groner B. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 4361-4369Crossref PubMed Scopus (524) Google Scholar), although Stat5 can also be phosphorylated by the Src tyrosine kinase (27.Kazansky A.V. Kabotyanski E.B. Wyszomierski S.L. Mancini M.A. Rosen J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 22484-22492Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). In the present study, we determined that suppression of Jak2 activity blocked prolactin-stimulated Stat5 tyrosine phosphorylation in HC11 cells, both by immunoblotting and by immunocytochemistry using an anti-phosphotyrosine-Stat5 antibody. Specifically, in Jak2-suppressed HC11 clones, Stat5 activation was significantly down-regulated. Furthermore, Stat5 activation was inhibited in a dose-dependent manner by Dn-Jak2 delivered by adenoviral infection. These findings support a view of the Jak2-Stat5 pathway as a differentiation-inducing axis in mammary epithelial cells.Targeted Inactivation of Jak2 Resulted in Hyperproliferative Phenotype of HC11 CellsThe Jak2-deficient HC11 clones showed significantly increased growth rates, loss of contact inhibition, and prolonged survival under anchorage-independent culture conditions. Although suppression of Jak2 in HC11 cells was associated with loss of Stat5 activation, Stat3 became constitutively tyrosine-phosphorylated. Constitutive activation of Stat3 was observed both in HC11 clones stably expressing the Jak2 antisense construct and in cells overexpressing Dn-Jak2 by adenoviral delivery, raising the possibility that the Jak2-Stat5 pathway normally inhibits Stat3 activation in HC11 cells. Interestingly, a similar mutual exclusion of Stat5 activation and Stat3 activation has been observed in mammary epithelial cells within the physiological setting of mammary gland involution (28.Groner B. Hennighausen L. Breast Cancer Res. 2000; 2: 149-153Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Weaning, or artificially induced milk stasis, rapidly shuts off Stat5 activation in lactating mammary epithelial cells, and Stat3 becomes activated instead (29.Li M. Liu X. Robinson G. Bar-Peled U. Wagner K.U. Young W.S. Hennighausen L. Furth P.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 3425-3430Crossref PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar). Although the importance of Stat3 activation in hyperproliferative HC11 cells remains to be determined, this observation is particularly intriguing in light of the established tumor-promoting role of Stat3 (23.Bromberg J.F. Wrzeszczynska M.H. Devgan G. Zhao Y. Pestell R.G. Albanese C. Darnell Jr., J.E. Cell. 1999; 98: 295-303Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2472) Google Scholar).In summary, the present work demonstrated that Jak2 is critical for prolactin-induced differentiation of HC11 mouse mammary epithelial cells. Equally important, the data are also consistent with an overall growth-inhibitory role of the Jak2-Stat5 pathway in mammary epithelial cells. This notion is of direct relevance to mammary tumorigenesis, because the data suggest a tumor-suppressive role of the Jak2-Stat5 pathway in the mammary gland. In general, cancer cells are characterized by enhanced growth and reduced levels of differentiation. Future work will address the possibility that progression of mammary and breast tumors involve a gradual loss of Jak2-Stat5 signaling, with a consequent increase in Stat3 activation. Prolactin is a principal differentiation factor for human and mouse mammary epithelial cells and is required for milk production (1.Horseman N.D. Zhao W. Montecino-Rodriguez E. Tanaka M. Nakashima K. Engle S.J. Smith F. Markoff E. Dorshkind K. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 6926-6935Crossref PubMed Scopus (489) Google Scholar). However, prolactin may also stimulate mammary epithelial cell growth and act as a mammary tumor promoter (1.Horseman N.D. Zhao W. Montecino-Rodriguez E. Tanaka M. Nakashima K. Engle S.J. Smith F. Markoff E. Dorshkind K. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 6926-6935Crossref PubMed Scopus (489) Google Scholar, 2.Wennbo H. Gebre-Medhin M. Gritli-Linde A. Ohlsson C. Isaksson O.G. Tornell J. J. Clin.

Identifying the roles of individual signaling molecules and pathways activated by prolactin in normal mammary epithelial cells is therefore needed to better understand the role of prolactin in breast cancer.

EMBO J. 1994; 13: 2182-2191Crossref PubMed Scopus (712) Google Scholar) in target cells, including Nb2 lymphocytes, ovarian cells, and mammary cells. Specifically, the Jak2-Stat5 pathway is expected to mediate prolactin-induced mammary epithelial cell differentiation (5.Hennighausen L. Robinson G.W. Wagner K.U. Liu W. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 7567-7569Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). Although genetic studies have established a critical role for Stat5 in mouse mammary gland differentiation (6.Liu X. Robinson G.W. Wagner K.U. Garrett L. Wynshaw-Boris A. Hennighausen L.

Although Jak2 has been regarded as the principal tyrosine kinase activated by prolactin (3.Rui H. Kirken R.A. Farrar W.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 5364-5368Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), the picture has been complicated by evidence that prolactin also can activate other tyrosine kinases, including Src family kinases (10.Clevenger C.V. Medaglia M.V. Mol. Endocrinol. 1994; 8: 674-681Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 11.Berlanga J.J. Fresno Vara J.A. Martin-Perez J. Garcia-Ruiz J.P. Mol.

Chem. 2000; 275: 33937-33944Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Experimental testing of the importance of Jak2 for prolactin-induced differentiation of mammary epithelial cells is therefore warranted. Furthermore, because Jak2 is oncogenic in hematopoietic cells (15.Lacronique V. Boureux A. Monni R. Dumon S. Mauchauffe M. Mayeux P. Gouilleux F. Berger R. Gisselbrecht S. Ghysdael J. Bernard O.A. Blood. 2000; 95: 2076-2083Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), it is also critical to establish the role of Jak2 in regulating growth of normal mammary epithelial cells.

Two distinct targeting strategies were used to suppress Jak2 in immortalized HC11 mouse mammary epithelial cells. First, an effectiveJak2 antisense construct was generated and stably introduced into HC11 cells. Second, a functional dominant-negative Jak2mutant was generated and introduced into HC11 cells by adenoviral delivery. We now report that Jak2 is essential for prolactin-induced differentiation and activation of transcription factor Stat5 in normal HC11 mouse mammary epithelial cells. Importantly, suppression of Jak2 in HC11 cells was associated with a hyperproliferative phenotype characterized by increased mitotic rate, reduced apoptosis, and reduced contact inhibition. In addition, constitutive activation of Stat3 was associated with suppression of Jak2 in HC11 cells. Collectively, our data suggest that Jak2 mediates growth-suppressive and differentiation-inducing effects on normal mouse mammary epithelial cells. These observations may provide important new insight into the role of the prolactin-activated Jak2-Stat5 pathway in breast cancer. DISCUSSIONThe present study used adenoviral delivery of dominant-negative Jak2 and stable expression ofJak2 antisense mRNA to identify Jak2 as a critical mediator of prolactin-induced differentiation of nontransformed HC11 mammary epithelial cells. The associated disruption of prolactin-induced Stat5 activation most likely represents the key molecular mechanism responsible for disrupting prolactin-induced differentiation. Furthermore, targeted suppression of Jak2 in HC11 cells led to a hyperproliferative phenotype, suggesting that Jak2 exerts a growth-inhibitory influence on normal mammary epithelial cells. Whereas suppression of Jak2 did not lead to transformation of HC11 cells, Jak2 suppression did, however, reduce contact inhibition and extend cell survival under anchorage-independent growth conditions. Stat3 was constitutively activated in hyperproliferative, Jak2-suppressed HC11 mammary epithelial cells, and this activation of Stat3, a known oncogene (23.Bromberg J.F. Wrzeszczynska M.H. Devgan G. Zhao Y. Pestell R.G. Albanese C. Darnell Jr., J.E. Cell. 1999; 98: 295-303Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2472) Google Scholar), may contribute to the hyperproliferative phenotype.Jak2 as a Mediator of Prolactin-induced DifferentiationWe originally identified Jak2 as the prolactin-associated tyrosine kinase in Nb2 lymphoma cells (3.Rui H. Kirken R.A. Farrar W.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 5364-5368Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 25.Rui H. Djeu J.Y. Evans G.A. Kelly P.A. Farrar W.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 24076-24081Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Although other Jak tyrosine kinases reportedly are not activated by prolactin receptors, numerous studies indicate that prolactin may activate other, non-Jak tyrosine kinases. These include tyrosine kinases Fyn (10.Clevenger C.V. Medaglia M.V. Mol. Endocrinol. 1994; 8: 674-681Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), Src (11.Berlanga J.J. Fresno Vara J.A. Martin-Perez J. Garcia-Ruiz J.P. Mol. Endocrinol. 1995; 9: 1461-1467Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), Tec (13.Kline J.B. Moore D.J. Clevenger C.V. Mol. Endocrinol. 2001; 15: 832-841Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar), and focal adhesion kinase (12.Canbay E. Norman M. Kilic E. Goffin V. Zachary I. Biochem. J. 1997; 324: 231-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). In most cases, temporal activation profiles suggest that prolactin activates Jak2 upstream of the non-Jak tyrosine kinases, but at least one report indicated that prolactin can activate Src independent of Jak2 (26.Fresno Vara J.A. Carretero M.V. Geronimo H. Ballmer-Hofer K. Martin-Perez J. Biochem. J. 2000; 345: 17-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Consequently, the notion that all prolactin-induced effects are mediated by Jak2 may not be correct. Therefore, it was of particular importance to determine whether Jak2 mediates prolactin-induced differentiation of mammary epithelial cells.The present study now provides direct evidence that Jak2, in fact, is critical for mammary epithelial cell differentiation. After establishing that prolactin activated Jak2, and not other Jaks, in HC11 cells, and that concentration-dependent induction of cell differentiation by prolactin correlated with Jak2 activation, two independent strategies were used in vitro for targeted suppression of Jak2. These included construction of two sets of novel reagents, a vector for stable or transient expression of a novel and specific Jak2 antisense-mRNA, and a replication-defective adenovirus for efficient gene delivery of Dn-Jak2. Both sets of molecular tools were validated and determined to be effective in independent experiments, and both strategies independently demonstrated that Jak2 is critical for prolactin-induced differentiation by selectively disrupting mammosphere formation. Disruption of prolactin-induced differentiation was not associated with any general cytotoxic effects, because suppression of Jak2 by either strategy led to increased proliferation rates and reduced cellular apoptosis. Furthermore, the described molecular tools may be applied to determine whether Jak2 is critical for biological effects of other cytokine receptors in a variety of cell types.Evidence That Jak2 Phosphorylates and Activates Stat5 in HC11 CellsTranscription factor Stat5, and especially the Stat5a isoform, is critical for mammary gland differentiation (6.Liu X.

https://openalex.org/W1581326054,"Post-translational modifications of histones play an important role in modulating gene transcription within chromatin. We used the mouse mammary tumor virus (MMTV) promoter, which adopts an ordered nucleosomal structure, to investigate the impact of a specific inhibitor of histone deacetylase, trichostatin A (TSA), on progesterone receptor-activated transcription. TSA induced global histone hyperacetylation, and this effect occurred independently of the presence of hormone. Interestingly, chromatin immunoprecipitation analysis revealed no significant change in the level of acetylated histones associated with the MMTV promoter following high TSA treatment. In human breast cancer cells, in which the MMTV promoter adopts a constitutively “open” chromatin structure, treatment with TSA converted the MMTV promoter into a closed structure. Addition of hormone did not overcome this TSA-induced closure of the promoter chromatin. Furthermore, TSA treatment resulted in the eviction of the transcription factor nuclear factor-1 from the promoter and reduced progesterone receptor-induced transcription. Kinetic experiments revealed that a loss of chromatin-remodeling proteins was coincident with the decrease in MMTV transcriptional activity and the imposition of repressed chromatin architecture at the promoter. These results demonstrate that deacetylase inhibitor treatment at levels that induce global histone acetylation may leave specific regulatory regions relatively unaffected and that this treatment may lead to transcriptional inhibition by mechanisms that modify chromatin-remodeling proteins rather than by influencing histone acetylation of the local promoter chromatin structure.

In chromatin, DNA is arranged into arrays of nucleosomes that consist of 146 bp of DNA wrapped around two copies each of histone proteins H2A, H2B, H3, and H4 assembled as an octamer (1.Kornberg R.D. Lorch Y. Cell. 1999; 98: 285-294Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1445) Google Scholar). Addition of a linker histone (H1) assembles the DNA into less well described “higher order” chromatin, leading to a fully condensed chromosome (2.van Holde K.E. Chromatin. Springer-Verlag, Heidelberg, Germany1988Google Scholar). Studies of chromatin structure have shown that the packaging of DNA within chromatin plays an important role in the regulation of gene expression (3.Wolffe A.P. Kurumizaka H. Prog. Nucleic Acids Res. Mol. Biol. 1998; 61: 379-422Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 4.Struhl K. Cell. 1999; 98: 1-4Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (372) Google Scholar). Chromatin structure may affect transcriptional activation by blocking the access of trans-acting factors to their target sequences and/or the assembly of the basal transcriptional machinery to form the preinitiation complex (5.Felsenfeld G. Nature. 1992; 355: 219-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (717) Google Scholar, 6.Wolffe A.P. Cell. 1994; 77: 13-16Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar). However, chromatin is not static. Its dynamic nature is evidenced through post-translational modification of histone N-terminal tail domains, which are reversibly acetylated at ε-lysine residues due to an equilibrium between acetylation and deacetylation (4.Struhl K. Cell. 1999; 98: 1-4Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (372) Google Scholar, 7.Davie J.R. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1998; 8: 173-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar, 8.Wade P.A. Pruss D. Wolffe A.P. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1997; 22: 128-132Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (410) Google Scholar). The observation that transcriptional cofactors possess enzymatic activity, specifically acetyltransferase activity, provided a direct mechanism by which histones within the context of a specific promoter might be modified (9.Brownell J.E. Zhou J. Ranalli T. Kobayashi R. Edmondson D.G. Roth S.Y. Allis C.D. Cell. 1996; 84: 843-851Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1292) Google Scholar, 10.Brownell J.E. Allis C.D. Curr.

Although histone hyperacetylation is often associated with increased gene expression, for a number of genes, this is not the case (14.Van Lint C. Emiliani S. Verdin E. Gene Expression. 1996; 5: 245-253PubMed Google Scholar). This raises the intriguing possibility that, like protein phosphorylation, histone acetylation may be a multifaceted post-translational modification with respect to gene expression (7.Davie J.R. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1998; 8: 173-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). For example, studies have shown the inhibitory effects of histone hyperacetylation induced by deacetylase inhibitors on steroid-inducible genes such as ovalbumin (15.McKnight G.S. Hager L. Palmiter R.D. Cell. 1980; 22: 469-477Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar), tyrosine aminotransferase (16.Plesko M.M. Hargrove J.L. Granner D.K. Chalkley R. J. Biol.

Gronemeyer H. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1998; 10: 384-391Crossref PubMed Scopus (710) Google Scholar). Steroid hormone receptors regulate gene expression by binding specific DNA sequences in target genes termed hormone response elements (23.Perlmann T. Evans R.M. Cell. 1997; 90: 391-397Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). To study the effects of histone acetylation on steroid-induced transcriptional activation, we used the MMTV promoter as a model system because it assumes a defined chromatin structure in vivo. The stably integrated MMTV promoter reproducibly assembles into a phased array of six nucleosomes (A–F) (24.Richard-Foy H. Hager G.L. EMBO J. 1987; 6: 2321-2328Crossref PubMed Scopus (450) Google Scholar). The region of the promoter occupied by the second nucleosome in the array, nucleosome B (Nuc-B), contains the hormone response elements to which steroid hormone receptors bind as well as target sites for other necessary transcription factors, including nuclear factor-1 (NF1) and octamer transcription factors (25.Lee H.L. Archer T.K. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 1454-1466Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). When stably transformed into T47D cells that express the PR but lack the glucocorticoid receptor (PR+/gr−; 2963.1 cells), the MMTV promoter adopts a novel chromatin structure that is “open” over Nuc-B (26.Mymryk J.S. Berard D. Hager G.L. Archer T.K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 26-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). This novel chromatin structure permits the constitutive binding of the PR and other integral transcription factors such as NF1 prior to hormone addition while retaining a hormone-inducible response (26.Mymryk J.S. Berard D. Hager G.L. Archer T.K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 26-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Utilizing the 2963.1 cells, we assessed the effect of low and high trichostatin A (TSA) concentrations on chromatin structure mediated by the PR within the context of the MMTV promoter. We demonstrate that PR-mediated transcription and chromatin remodeling were inhibited at the MMTV promoter when cells were subjected to high levels of TSA. Interestingly, under conditions where global histone hyperacetylation was observed, the levels of histone hyperacetylation at the MMTV promoter were not significantly affected by TSA treatment. However, expression of a variety of transcriptional co-regulators, including chromatin-remodeling proteins, was reduced. Thus, in this human breast cancer cell line, histone deacetylase inhibitors may repress the chromatin architecture of the MMTV promoter by mechanisms other than histone hyperacetylation of the proximal promoter. 2963.1 cells were derived from T47D cells by stable cotransfection of the chimeric bovine papilloma virus-based vector pJ83d, carrying the MMTV long terminal repeat (LTR) attached to the bacterial chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) gene (26.Mymryk J.S. Berard D. Hager G.L. Archer T.K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 26-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Cells were grown at 37 °C with 5% CO2 in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) containing 10% fetal bovine serum (BioWhittaker, Inc.). Cells were treated with R-TSA (Sigma) at either low (5 ng/ml) or high (100 ng/ml) concentrations for the times indicated in the figure legends. 2963.1 cells were seeded in 90-mm dishes at 6 × 105 cells/dish in triplicate and treated as indicated in the figure legends. Cells were harvested and lysed in 100 μl of 0.25 m Tris-HCl (pH 7.8) by freezing and thawing three times. CAT activity was determined by a kinetic enzymatic assay with 5 μg of cell lysate (27.Nordeen S.K. Green III, P.P. Fowlkes D.M. DNA (N. Y.). 1987; 6: 173-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). Experiments were repeated at least three times. Subconfluent cells were treated with TSA and hormone as indicated in the figure legends. Nuclei were isolated as described previously (28.Archer T.K. Lee H.L. Methods. 1997; 11: 235-245Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Acid-soluble proteins were isolated from nuclei in 100 μl of 0.4 n H2SO4 at 4 °C for 1 h. After centrifugation for 5 min at 14,000 rpm, histones were precipitated from the supernatant in 1 ml of acetone placed at −20 °C overnight. Following centrifugation, the proteins were resuspended in 50 μl of 0.9 n acetic acid and 25 μl of 75% sucrose. Histone proteins (40 μg) were electrophoresed using a 16% acid/urea-polyacrylamide gel as previously described (25.Lee H.L. Archer T.K. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 1454-1466Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Histones were visualized after staining with Amido Black. Subconfluent cells were treated with TSA and hormone as indicated in the figure legends. Nuclei were isolated and partially digested with SstI or AflII (150 and 2000 units/ml, respectively; New England Biolabs Inc.) for 15 min at 30 °C as described previously (28.Archer T.K. Lee H.L. Methods. 1997; 11: 235-245Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). All samples were then digested to completion in vitro with HaeIII (New England Biolabs Inc.) to provide an internal control. Digestion fragments were detected by reiterative primer extension using 32P-labeled primer MMTV-22 (5′-TCTGGAAAGTGAAGGATAAGTGACGA-3′), which is specific to the MMTV promoter. The purified extended products were separated on 6% polyacrylamide gels and visualized by exposure to Hyperfilm (Amersham Biosciences) at −80 °C and also quantitated using a PhosphorImager (ImageQuant software, Molecular Dynamics, Inc.). Subconfluent cells were treated as indicated in the figure legends, and isolated nuclei were partially digested withHaeIII (1000 units/ml) and exonuclease III (3000 units/ml; New England Biolabs Inc.) for 15 min at 30 °C to detect stops corresponding to the 5′-boundaries of bound factors on the MMTV LTR (29.Mymryk J.S. Archer T.K. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 4344-4345Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). DNA was purified, digested with mung bean nuclease (Invitrogen) to remove single-stranded overhangs, purified again, and digested to completion with HaeIII. For each sample, 20 μg of DNA was subjected to reiterative primer extension with the32P-labeled MMTV-CAT primer (5′-TTAGCTTCCTTAGCTCCTGAAAAT-3′). The purified extended products were separated on 6% polyacrylamide gels and exposed to Hyperfilm. Quantitation was performed using ImageQuant software. Subconfluent cells were transfected with a plasmid containing the MMTV LTR attached to the firefly luciferase gene (designated pLTR-Luc) (30.LeFebvre P. Berard D.S. Cordingley M.G. Hager G.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 2529-2537Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Using FuGENE 6 (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) according to the manufacturer's recommendations, 2963.1 cells in 150-mm dishes were transfected with 10 μg of pLTR-Luc and 30 μl of FuGENE 6 diluted in phenol red-free Opti-MEM (Invitrogen). After incubation for 5 h, the transfection mixture was removed from cells and replaced with growth medium plus additional treatments as indicated in the figure legends. Cells were harvested, and nuclei were isolated as described previously (28.Archer T.K. Lee H.L. Methods. 1997; 11: 235-245Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Restriction enzyme hypersensitivity and transcription factor binding were analyzed as described above. To amplify digestion products specific to the transient MMTV template, the32P-labeled Luc-618 primer (5′-CCTTTCTTTATGTTTTTGGCG-3′) was used. For each sample, 10 μg of DNA for restriction enzyme hypersensitivity assays and 3 μg of DNA for transcription factor binding assays were subjected to reiterative primer extension. Subconfluent 2963.1 cells were treated as indicated in the figure legends prior to harvest. Cells were lysed in buffer containing 100 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.5), 250 mm NaCl, 1% (v/v) Nonidet P-40, 1 mm EDTA, 1 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 2 mg/ml bovine serum albumin as described previously (31.Fryer C.J. Archer T.K. Nature. 1998; 393: 88-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (411) Google Scholar). Proteins (100 μg) were electrophoresed on 6, 8, and 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gels and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Hybond-P, Amersham Biosciences) at 299 mA for 2 h at 4 °C. The membranes were incubated with antibodies specific to PR isoforms A (PRA) and B (PRB), NF1, mSin3a, and p300 (Santa Cruz Biotechnologies); HDAC1 and NCoR (Upstate Biotechnologies, Inc.); BRG-1, BAF155, and NCoA1 (31.Fryer C.J. Archer T.K. Nature. 1998; 393: 88-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (411) Google Scholar); and RbAp48/46. The proteins were detected by ECL Plus reagent (PerkinElmer Life Sciences), followed by autoradiography with Hyperfilm. ChIP analysis was carried out using the ChIP assay kit from Upstate Biotechnologies, Inc. (catalog no. 17-295) with minor modifications of the protocol. 2963.1 cells (106) were plated onto 100-mm dishes and treated the next day as described in the figure legends. Ten micrograms of either anti-acetylated histone H4 (catalog no. 06-866, Upstate Biotechnology, Inc.) or anti-IκB kinase-α (catalog number sc-7606, Santa Cruz Biotechnologies) antibody was added to tubes containing 1 ml of chromatin solution. Following incubation with antibody, 60 μl of salmon sperm DNA/protein A-agarose was added to each tube, and the agarose-antibody complexes were then captured by centrifugation. After the beads were pelleted and washed, the chromatin was extracted, and the protein-DNA cross-links were reversed. Following purification, the DNA was subjected to PCR amplification using primers MMTV-22 and MMTV-344 (5′-TTAAGTAAGTTTTTGGTTACAAACT-3′) under the following conditions: 30 cycles, 55 °C, 1.5 mmMgCl2, 0.2 mm dNTPs, 5 units of Taqpolymerase, and 25 pmol of each primer. Eight microliters of each reaction was analyzed on 1.5% 1× Tris borate/EDTA-agarose gels, and the bands were quantified using the Alpha-Imager documentation system (Alpha Innotech Corp.). The DNA was analyzed twice by PCR, and graphs were calculated based on these data. To examine the relationship between histone acetylation and PR-mediated transcriptional activation at the MMTV promoter, we made use of a unique human breast cancer cell line model, T47D/2963.1 (referred to as 2963.1 cells) (26.Mymryk J.S. Berard D. Hager G.L. Archer T.K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 26-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). These cells normally exhibit an open chromatin structure with the constitutive binding of transcription factors at Nuc-B within the MMTV promoter. We also made use of TSA, a potent and specific inhibitor of histone deacetylase, at both low (5 ng/ml) and high (100 ng/ml) concentrations to manipulate the acetylation status of the histones and to induce global histone hyperacetylation (32.Yoshida M. Kijima M. Akita M. Beppu T. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 17174-17179Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The MMTV promoter exhibited a significant level of basal transcriptional activity as measured by CAT assays (Fig. 1 A, ●). However, transcriptional activation from the promoter was hormone-inducible after treatment with the synthetic progestin R5020 (Fig. 1 A, ○). Pretreatment of cells with low TSA had no effect on hormone-stimulated MMTV transcriptional activity (Fig. 1 A, compare ○ and ▵). Furthermore, treatment with low TSA alone failed to either increase or inhibit MMTV basal transcriptional activity (Fig. 1 A, compare ● and ▴). In contrast, pretreatment with high TSA prior to adding R5020 inhibited hormone-induced transcription as seen in the absence of TSA (Fig. 1 A, compare ○ and ■). Moreover, treatment with high TSA alone reduced the level of MMTV transcriptional activity to below basal activity (Fig. 1 A, compare ● and ▪). Our results demonstrate that high (but not low) TSA treatment inhibits the transcriptional activity of the MMTV promoter in 2963.1 cells. To examine potential causes for the different effects of low and high TSA treatments, we initially investigated the global histone acetylation status. Core histones were isolated and analyzed by electrophoresis on acid/urea-polyacrylamide gels, which resolved multiple acetylated histone isoforms (Fig. 1 B). The TSA-induced changes in acetylation were most readily observed by examining changes in histone H4 isoforms. In the absence of TSA, only the un- and monoacetylated forms of histone H4 were detected. Treatment with the hormone R5020 did not alter the histone acetylation profile (Fig. 1 B, lanes 1 and 2). Treatment with low TSA decreased the level of the unacetylated form and increased the level of the mono- and diacetylated forms of histone H4 (Fig. 1 B, lanes 1 and 5). In contrast, treatment with high TSA resulted in increased levels of di-, tri-, and tetraacetylated forms of histone H4 (Fig. 1 B, lanes 1 and 6). Increases in the acetylated forms of histones H2A, H2B, and H3 were also observed with high TSA treatments (Fig. 1 B, lanes 1 and 6). Addition of R5020 did not alter the histone acetylation patterns generated by treatment with low and high TSA alone (Fig. 1 B, lanes 3–6). Thus, exposure to high concentrations of TSA results in increased histone acetylation patterns, correlating with the inactivation of the MMTV promoter within 2963.1 cells. Previous analysis of 2963.1 cells demonstrated that the promoter region encompassed by Nuc-B is constitutively open and hypersensitive to restriction enzyme endonucleases (26.Mymryk J.S. Berard D. Hager G.L. Archer T.K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 26-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). To evaluate the effect of histone hyperacetylation on the chromatin architecture, we first examined the extent of restriction enzyme hypersensitivity using the enzyme SstI. The constitutive hypersensitivity toSstI characteristic of 2963.1 cells was reduced by treatment with high (but not low) concentrations of TSA (Fig. 2 A, lanes 1,5, and 6), indicating that Nuc-B is converted to a closed chromatin structure. Moreover, this closed chromatin structure was maintained in cells pretreated with high (but not low) concentrations of TSA prior to agonist treatment (Fig. 2 A,lanes 3–6). To confirm that the observed effects of inhibiting histone deacetylation were not restricted to the 3′-region of Nuc-B, we utilized the restriction enzyme AflII, which cleaves near the 5′-boundary of Nuc-B. As seen with SstI, the MMTV promoter remained hypersensitive to AflII digestion both in the absence and presence of hormone, indicative of its open chromatin conformation (Fig. 2 B, lanes 7 and 8). Treatment of cells with high concentrations of TSA resulted in reduced cleavage by AflII, consistent with the now “closed” chromatin architecture of the promoter in the absence or presence of hormone (Fig. 2 B, lanes 8, 10, and12). This closed chromatin structure was not observed when 2963.1 cells were treated with low concentrations of TSA. The MMTV promoter remained accessible to digestion with AflII at levels similar to untreated cells in the absence or presence of hormone (Fig. 2 B, lanes 7, 9, and11). These data demonstrate that, under conditions that lead to histone hyperacetylation, the constitutive hypersensitivity of Nuc-B in the MMTV promoter is lost. Because an open chromatin structure is essential for transcription factors such as NF1 to bind in vivo, the above data predict that treatment with high concentrations of TSA would block transcription factor binding. This direct consequence of histone hyperacetylation on protein-DNA interaction was examined using in vivo footprinting assays (33.Cordingley M.G. Riegel A.T. Hager G.L. Cell. 1987; 48: 261-270Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar). In 2963.1 cells, transcription factor NF1 bound to the promoter independently of hormone (Fig. 3, lanes 1 and 2), consistent with a constitutively open chromatin architecture. Treatment with high TSA inhibited NF1 binding to the MMTV promoter (Fig. 3, compare lanes 1 and 6); subsequent hormone treatment after high TSA pretreatment did not restore NF1 binding to the MMTV promoter in 2963.1 cells (Fig. 3, compare lanes 2,4, and 6). As predicted, treatment with low TSA had no effect on NF1 binding either in the absence or presence of hormone (Fig. 3, lanes 3 and 5). Thus, treatment with histone deacetylase inhibitor results in a closed MMTV chromatin structure, blocking the binding of NF1, which is necessary for transcriptional activation. High levels of TSA result in the loss of restriction enzyme hypersensitivity within the region associated with nucleosome B in the MMTV promoter. Because high TSA treatment modifies the acetylation status of histones at many locations within the cell, we examined the possibility that decreased digestion of the MMTV promoter was a result of increased SstI and AflII restriction sites now available elsewhere within the cell. To determine this, we analyzed the ability of SstI to digest a transiently introduced MMTV template under the same experimental conditions in which decreased digestion was observed on the integrated template. By introducing a transient MMTV template, we increased the number of target sites for the restriction enzyme SstI. It is also important to note that the MMTV promoter adopts an ordered nucleosomal structure only upon stable integration into chromatin, but not when transiently expressed. Under these circumstances, the MMTV template adopts a relatively loose and open conformation. In 2963.1 cells, the transient MMTV template pLTR-Luc (30.LeFebvre P. Berard D.S. Cordingley M.G. Hager G.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 2529-2537Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar) remained sensitive toSstI in the absence and presence of agonist treatment, resulting in 42 and 51% digestion, respectively (Fig. 4 A, lanes 1 and2). Treatment with high TSA did not inhibit SstI digestion of the transient MMTV template (Fig. 4 A,lanes 1 and 4), the same conditions under which digestion of the stable MMTV promoter decreased (Fig. 2 A,lanes 1 and 6). In fact, digestion withSstI was slightly enhanced, resulting in 59% cutting. Furthermore, agonist treatment following high TSA pretreatment had no effect on SstI digestion (54% cutting) (Fig. 4 A,lanes 3 and 4). Therefore, decreasedSstI digestion of the integrated MMTV promoter within Nuc-B is due to altered chromatin structure (i.e. chromatin closure), as opposed to an increase in restriction sites or other factors that may affect the restriction enzyme SstI. High levels of TSA also result in the loss of NF1 binding to the MMTV promoter within Nuc-B. To determine the effect of high TSA on the ability of NF1 to interact with its DNA-binding site, we analyzed a transient MMTV template by exonuclease III footprinting under the same conditions that NF1 binding was inhibited. As expected from the enzyme hypersensitivity results, NF1 bound to the transient MMTV promoter within Nuc-B in the absence or presence of R5020 (Fig. 4 B, lanes 1 and 2). Treatment with high TSA did not alter NF1 binding (Fig. 4 B, lanes 1 and 4). NF1 bound the transient MMTV template under the same conditions in which NF1 bound to the stable chromatin MMTV promoter (Fig. 3, lanes 1 and 6). Addition of R5020 subsequent to high TSA pretreatment did not alter NF1 binding (Fig. 4 B, lanes 1, 3, and4). Consequently, in 2963.1 cells, binding of NF1 to the stable, nucleosome-associated MMTV promoter is inhibited due to the closed chromatin architecture induced by high TSA treatment. Our results demonstrate that NF1 is competent to bind DNA under these conditions. In addition to promoting histone acetylation, TSA is known to result in hyperacetylation of other cellular proteins (34.Imhof A. Yang X.J. Ogryzko V.V. Nakatani Y. Wolffe A.P. Ge H. Curr. Biol. 1997; 7: 689-692Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (536) Google Scholar). To extend our analysis of the inhibitory effects of high TSA on MMTV activation, we examined the steady-state levels of cellular factors that may participate in MMTV activation by the PR. Our results demonstrated that the levels of both progesterone receptor isoforms (PRB and PRA) were greatly reduced in response to high TSA treatments in the absence and presence of hormone relative to untreated cells (Fig. 5 A, compare lanes 1, 4, and 6). PRB levels were decreased by 95% by high TSA treatment both in the absence and presence of hormone. PRA levels were also reduced by 95% by high TSA treatment either alone or in the presence of hormone. However, treatment with R5020 alone or in combination with low TSA also resulted in decreased PR levels, although not to the extent as observed with high TSA (Fig. 5 A). Treatment with R5020 reduced the levels of PRB by 85% and the levels of PRA by 65%. Treatment with low TSA resulted in decreased levels of PR, but to a lesser extent. PRB was reduced by 50% by low TSA alone and by 85% upon addition of R5020; PRA was reduced by 80% by low TSA treatment alone and by 40% upon addition of R50202. Although hormone addition was unable to overcome the effects of high TSA treatment, it appeared to antagonize the effects of the low TSA-induced decrease in PRA levels while enhancing the low TSA-induced decrease in PRB levels"

Initiation is characterized by formation of a series of initiation complexes, each catalyzed by a different subset of initiation factors. Recruitment of mRNA to the 43 S initiation complex to form the 48 S initiation complex involves eIF3,1 PABP, and the eIF4 proteins. eIF3 is a 520-kDa multimer that is required for both Met-tRNAi and mRNA binding. PABP is a 70-kDa protein that specifically binds poly(A) and homo-oligomerizes. The eIF4 factors consist of: eIF4A, a 46-kDa RNA helicase; eIF4B, a 70-kDa RNA-binding and -annealing protein that stimulates eIF4A; eIF4E, a 25-kDa cap-binding protein; and eIF4G, a group of proteins of 154–180 kDa that form specific complexes with all of the other proteins known to be involved in mRNA recruitment. Proteins sharing eIF4G homology represent the products of at least three different genes in mammalian cells (2.Yan R. Rychlik W. Etchison D. Rhoads R.E. J. Biol.

In some cases it has been shown that eIF4G-1 not only binds proteins but also affects their activities or binding of other proteins (19.Korneeva N.L. Lamphear B.J. Hennigan F.L.C. Rhoads R.E. J.

The mRNA recruitment step is rate-limiting for initiation under normal cellular conditions and appears to be highly regulated (31.Gingras A.-C. Raught B. Sonenberg N. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1999; 68: 913-963Crossref PubMed Scopus (1766) Google Scholar, 32.Rhoads R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 30337-30340Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). The best studied regulatory mechanism involving eIF4G is its cleavage by 2A protease of entero- and rhinoviruses and L protease of foot-and-mouth-disease virus. Upon infection of mammalian cells with these picornaviruses, most host protein synthesis is shut off coincident with the appearance of viral proteins (33.Ehrenfeld E. Hershey J.W.B. Mathews M.B. Sonenberg N. Translational Control. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1996: 549-573Google Scholar). This is thought to be mediated by a switch from cap-dependent to cap-independent translation. Complexes containing eIF4G restore cap-dependent translation in lysates of poliovirus-infected cells (34.Grifo J.A. Tahara S.M. Morgan M.A. Shatkin A.J. Merrick W.C. J. Biol.

Chem. 1982; 257: 14806-14810Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). eIF4G is separated into two functional domains, an N-terminal cleavage product (cpN) that binds eIF4E and PABP, and a C-terminal cleavage product (cpC) that binds eIF4A and eIF3 (14.Lamphear B.J.

Initiation of picornaviral mRNA translation is via an internal ribosome entry site (39.Pelletier J. Sonenberg N. Nature. 1988; 334: 320-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (1403) Google Scholar, 40.Jang S.K.

Cleavage of eIF4G drastically inhibits translation of capped mRNAs in vitro, whereas internal initiation and initiation of uncapped mRNAs are either unaffected or even stimulated (41.Liebig H.-D. Ziegler E. Yan R. Hartmuth K. Klump H. Kowalski H. Blaas D. Sommergruber W. Frasel L. Lamphear B. Rhoads R.E. Kuechler E. Skern T.

However, an analysis using 2A protease cleavage, SDS-PAGE, and antibodies directed against different domains of eIF4G suggested that the heterogeneity was attributable to the ∼50-kDa cpN domain (38.Lamphear B.J. Yan R. Yang F. Waters D. Liebig H.-D. Klump H. Kuechler E. Skern T. Rhoads R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 19200-19203Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Digestion with L protease further delimited the source of heterogeneity to the N-terminal ∼30 kDa cpN1 domain (14.Lamphear B.J. Kirchweger R. Skern T. Rhoads R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 21975-21983Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (472) Google Scholar). Multiple cDNAs for human eIF4G-1 have also been reported. The initial cloning, based on two overlapping cDNAs from fetal and adult brain, predicted a protein of 154 kDa (2.Yan R. Rychlik W. Etchison D. Rhoads R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 23226-23231Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Subsequent cloning revealed a cDNA corresponding to a protein with an additional 156 aa at the N terminus (44.Imataka H. Gradi A. Sonenberg N. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 7480-7489Crossref PubMed Scopus (471) Google Scholar). An initiation codon was proposed based on alignment with eIF4G-3 and lack of any further upstream cDNA sequence. Further cloning revealed a cDNA that was 42 nt longer (45.Johannes G. Sarnow P. RNA (N. Y.). 1998; 4: 1500-1513Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar), indicating either that multiple mRNAs exist or that Imataka et al. (44.Imataka H. Gradi A. Sonenberg N. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 7480-7489Crossref PubMed Scopus (471) Google Scholar) had not reached the 5′-end of the same mRNA. Finally, a fourth and fifth cDNA were reported (46.Bushell M. Poncet D. Marissen W.E. Flotow H. Lloyd R.E. Clemens M.J. Morley S.J. Cell Death Differ. 2000; 7: 628-636Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). One of these independently confirmed some of the sequence reported by Johannes and Sarnow (45.Johannes G. Sarnow P. RNA (N. Y.). 1998; 4: 1500-1513Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar) but did not extend the cDNA. The other was collinear with the other cDNAs up to a point, upstream of which it deviated, suggesting a splice variant. None of these cDNAs provided a new in-frame AUG. Thus, the most upstream AUG codon for all five eIF4G-1 cDNAs reported to date is that originally proposed by Imataka et al. (44.Imataka H. Gradi A. Sonenberg N. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 7480-7489Crossref PubMed Scopus (471) Google Scholar). The present study was motivated by the fact that the relationship between the multiplicity of electrophoretic forms of the protein and the multiplicity of cDNAs is not known. Importantly, despite speculation based on cDNA sequences, the N terminus has not been established for any eIF4G-1 isoform. It is important to establish the actual protein structures, since eIF4G-1 isoforms differing at the N terminus may contain different binding sites for proteins involved in translational control. This study identifies an EST in the public databases as corresponding to a longer form of eIF4G-1 mRNA. Because it predicts a new upstream, in-frame AUG, it could encode an even longer isoform of eIF4G-1 than those predicted from previous cDNA sequences. Mass spectrometric analysis confirmed that this was the case and also established the structure of two other eIF4G-1 isoforms. Porcine trypsin was obtained from Promega (catalog number V5111). Endoproteinase Lys-C (catalog number P3428) and bovine α-chymotrypsinogen A (catalog number C4879) were obtained from Sigma. Arg-C from Clostridium histolyticum was purchased from Worthington (catalog number LS001641). Asp-N (catalog number 1420488) and Complete, Mini, Protease Inhibitor Cocktail Tablets (catalog number 1836153) were obtained from Roche Molecular Biochemicals. m7GTP-Sepharose 4B was purchased from Amersham Biosciences. As noted above, Bushell et al. (46.Bushell M. Poncet D. Marissen W.E. Flotow H. Lloyd R.E. Clemens M.J. Morley S.J. Cell Death Differ. 2000; 7: 628-636Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar) reported a novel cDNA related to eIF4G-1, GenBankTM nucleotide accession number AF002815. The hypothetical protein encoded by this cDNA was assigned GenBankTM protein accession number AAC78442. We compared the cDNA sequence corresponding to aa residues −24 to +49 of this protein 2Various numbering systems have been used in previous reports dealing with the human eIF4G-1 proteins. To allow comparison between sequences, we have performed an alignment of the proteins predicted from all eIF4G-1 cDNAs. The aa numbers used throughout the present work are based on this alignment, rather than the numbers used in the original publications, and are shown in Fig. 1. to the est_human database using the program blastn found under the NCBI BLAST suite of programs. We obtained a new EST derived from an adult melanoma: GenBankTM nucleotide accession number AL120751. The 215-nt segment from nt 25–240 of AL120751 exactly matched the 215-nt segment from nt 4–219 of AF002815. The sequence reported for AL120751 covered only the most 5′-terminal 627 nt, even though the complete eIF4G-1 cDNA is predicted to contain 5510 nt (2.Yan R. Rychlik W. Etchison D. Rhoads R.E. J.

We obtained the plasmid corresponding to this EST, termed Homo sapiens cDNA clone DKFZp762O191, from the German Genome Project and determined additional DNA sequence information using the DNA sequencing facility at Iowa State University. The 3′-end of AL120751 (nt 4647–5306, using a composite numbering system) 3The sequence deposited as GenBank™ nucleotide accession number AL120751 contains only 627 nt of the cDNA represented by clone DKFZp762O191. The current report confirms the entire EST sequence and extends the cDNA sequence. Alignment with other eIF4G-1 cDNAs predicts a 5510-nt mRNA corresponding to clone DKFZp762O191. The nucleotide numbers used in this report, unless otherwise noted, are based on this composite mRNA in which nt 1 is the first nt of AL120751. was determined using an oligo(dT) 3′-A primer. A 3′-terminal poly(A) tract of 111 nt was observed using a primer corresponding to the SP6 promoter in the vector. A sequence covering nt 439–1155 was obtained using the sense primer 5′-AACACGCCTTCTCAGCCCCGC-3′. This corrected an entry of “N” at nt 456 to G in the GenBank record of AL120751. A sequence covering nt 710–1399 was obtained using the antisense primer 5′-GGGGCAAGCTGGGGGAGGAGC-3′. This sequence exactly matched nt 328–1018 of cDNA AF104913, which encodes protein AAC82471. Finally, sequences covering nt 1–300 and 97–793 were obtained using the sense primer 5′-CGCCACGGCCGAAGCAGCTAG-3′ and antisense primer 5′-AACACGCCTTCTCAGCCCCGC-3′, respectively. Overall, this extended the sequence information for cDNA clone DKFZp762O191 by 1544 nt. Human K562 cells were grown in RPMI medium (Invitrogen) containing 10% fetal bovine serum (Atlanta Biologicals, Norcross, GA). Cultures were grown to confluence in 175-cm2 tissue culture flasks maintained in a humidified, 5% CO2 environment at 37 °C. A standard preparation of lysate was derived from 3.2 × 109cells (16 T-175 flasks). Cells were resuspended on ice for 30 min in an equal volume of Buffer A (1% Triton X-100, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 1 tablet of protease inhibitor mixture per 20 ml buffer) and then centrifuged at 25,000 × g for 20 min. The supernatant was frozen in liquid N2 and stored at −80 °C. Two antibodies against different regions of eIF4G-1 were used. 4Names of eIF4G-1 peptides used for designing oligonucleotide probes and making site-specific antibodies in earlier studies (2.Yan R. Rychlik W. Etchison D. Rhoads R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 23226-23231Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 52.Lamphear B.J. Rhoads R.E. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 15726-15733Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar) are not related to the names for eIF4G-1 peptides used in the present report (Fig. 3). To avoid confusion, the earlier peptide names are always preceded by the term “anti-” in the present work. Anti-Peptide 7 antibodies were obtained as described previously (2.Yan R. Rychlik W. Etchison D. Rhoads R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 23226-23231Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Anti-Peptide 10 antibodies were produced and affinity purified using the peptide CRAQPPSSAASR, which corresponds to aa residues 55–65 of the consensus eIF4G-1 sequence2 with an added N-terminal Cys residue, as described previously (2.Yan R. Rychlik W. Etchison D. Rhoads R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 23226-23231Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Immunoblotting was carried out as described previously (47.Harlow E. Lane D. Antibodies: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1988Google Scholar). Incubation with the anti-Peptide 7 antibodies (1:1000) was carried out at room temperature for 1 h. Incubation with affinity-purified anti-Peptide 10 antibodies (1:50) was at 4 °C overnight. Both antibodies were visualized with alkaline phosphatase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG antibodies (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA) at 1:1000. Recombinant 2A protease from Coxsackievirus serotype B4 was prepared as described previously (41.Liebig H.-D. Ziegler E. Yan R. Hartmuth K. Klump H. Kowalski H. Blaas D. Sommergruber W. Frasel L. Lamphear B. Rhoads R.E. Kuechler E. Skern T. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 7581-7588Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). K562 cell lysates were cleared after thawing by spinning at 25,000 × g for 20 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was incubated with recombinant 2A protease at a final concentration of 50–100 μg/ml for 30 min on ice. (As 2A protease preparations differed somewhat in activity, the amount was adjusted to produce complete cleavage of eIF4G-1, based on western blotting with anti-Peptide 7 antibodies.) The 2A protease-treated lysate was then subjected to m7GTP-Sepharose affinity chromatography as described previously (48.Webb N.R. Chari R.V.J. DePillis G. Kozarich J.W. Rhoads R.E. Biochemistry. 1984; 23: 177-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar) but with the following modifications. One standard batch of K562 lysate was gently rotated with 2 ml of m7GTP-Sepharose for 1 h at 4 °C. The slurry was then transferred to a column and the flow-through fraction was reapplied to the column. The column was washed first with 12 volumes of Buffer B55 (20 mm MOPS, pH 7.6, 10% (w/v) glycerol, 0.5 mm EDTA, 0.25 mm dithiothreitol, 25 mm NaF, 55 mm KCl) and then with 3 volumes of 100 μm GTP in Buffer B55. Proteins were eluted with 4 volumes of 200 μm m7GTP in Buffer B55. The eluate was frozen in liquid N2and stored at −80 °C. Linear polyacrylamide was prepared (49.Gaillard C. Strauss F. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 378Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar) and added to each cpN sample at a final concentration of 120 μg/ml as carrier. Ice-cold 100% trichloroacetic acid was added to a final concentration of 10% and the sample allowed to stand on ice for 30 min. The precipitate was collected by centrifugation at 25,000 ×g for 20 min, washed four times with ice-cold 80% aqueous acetone, and dissolved in 1× SDS-loading buffer (adjusted to pH 8.2; Ref. 50.Sechi S. Chait B.T. Anal. Chem. 1998; 70: 5150-5158Crossref PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar). Alkylation of Cys residues was performed as described previously (50.Sechi S. Chait B.T. Anal. Chem. 1998; 70: 5150-5158Crossref PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar). The sample was then adjusted to pH 6.8 with HCl, and the cpN isoforms were separated by electrophoresis on a 16 × 20-cm gradient gel (8–15%; acrylamide:N,N′-bisacrylamide, 30:0.8) with a 4% stacking gel. Electrophoresis was carried out a constant current of 16 mA for 4 h followed by 24 mA for 16–20 h. Protein bands were stained with Coomassie Blue, excised, and stored at −80 °C. Gel pieces were minced and further destained with three washes (400 μl each) of 50% acetonitrile, 25 mm ammonium bicarbonate, pH 8.0. The polyacrylamide was dehydrated for 5 min with 100% acetonitrile followed by vacuum centrifugation in a Savant Speedvac for 30 min. In-gel digestion with trypsin was performed overnight at 37 °C by the addition of 15 μl of enzyme (10 μg/ml) in 25 mmNH4HCO3, pH 8.0, to each gel piece. For Lys-C digestion, a stock enzyme solution of 50 μg/ml was made in 0.1m Tris-HCl, pH. 8.0, and 15 μl were added to each gel piece. Digestion was performed overnight at 37 °C. For Arg-C digestion, the enzyme was reconstituted at 2 mg/ml in 1 mmCaCl2, 2.5 mm dithiothreitol. In-gel digestion was carried out at room temperature overnight in 15 μl of 50 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.6, 2.5 mmdithiothreitol by the addition of 3 μg enzyme per gel slice. Finally, for Asp-N digestion, the enzyme was reconstituted in H2O to give a concentration of 40 μg/ml in 10 mm Tris, pH 7.5. In-gel digestion was carried out overnight at 37 °C in 15 μl of 50 mm sodium phosphate, pH 8.0, by the addition of 4 μl of enzyme per gel slice. Mass spectrometric analysis was performed at both the LSUHSC-S Research Core Facility or the Laboratory for Mass Spectrometry and Gaseous Ion Chemistry, Rockefeller University. At LSUHSC-S, MALDI-TOF-MS was performed on a PerSeptive Biosystems Voyager-DE PRO Biospectrometry work station. At Rockefeller University, two instruments were used. Peptide mapping by MALDI-TOF-MS was performed on a PerSeptive Biosystems Voyager-DE STR Biospectrometry Work station. Sequence information was obtained by LC-ESI-MS/MS on a Finnigan LCQ-DECA ion trap mass spectrometer. Peptides were prepared for MALDI-TOF-MS after proteolytic digestion by extraction from gel pieces twice with 50-μl portions of 50% acetonitrile, 5.0% trifluoroacetic acid. Peptides in the extract were dried, dissolved in 15 μl of 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid, and purified on a ZipTip (Millipore). They were eluted with 2 μl of the appropriate organic acid (matrix) dissolved in 50% acetonitrile, 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid, and spotted on a MALDI plate. For masses in the 800–6000 Da range, the matrix was a 0.01 mg/ml solution of α-cyano-4-hydroxy-trans-cinnamic acid (Sigma, catalog number C-2020). For masses in the 6000–26,000 Da range, the matrix was a 0.01 mg/ml solution of sinapinic acid (3,5-dimethoxy-4-hydroxy-trans-cinnamic acid; Aldrich, catalog number D13,460-0). When internal calibration was used, the eluting solution also included peptide mass standards. Data were summed over 50–100 acquisitions in delayed extraction mode. At LSUHSC-S, data analysis was performed using the Data Explorer software, version 3.5–4.0. At Rockefeller University, analysis was performed using the software program M over Z from Proteometrics, LLC. In both cases, spectra were subjected to algorithms for base-line correction and noise removal at two S.D. values. Throughout the current report, monoisotopic masses are reported for <2500-Da peptides, whereas average masses are reported for >2500-Da peptides. Theoretical masses were determined using the Peptide Mass tool at the ExPASy Proteomics website (ca.expasy.org/tools/). Peaks seen in both the sample of interest and also in a blank gel treated identically were eliminated from further consideration. For automatic matching of observed to predicted peptide masses, we used Auto-MS Fit, version 1.2.18 (PerSeptive Biosystems). For manual matching, we considered that peptides matched if their masses were within 1 Da for the range 800–10,000 Da. Because of unresolved microheterogeneity, caused by Met oxidation for example, peptides with molecular masses above 10,000 Da were considered to be matches if the experimentally determine"

Recently, we presented evidence that the extracellular part of VE cadherin, which consists of five homologous modules, associates as a Ca2+-dependent hexamer in solution (Legrand, P., Bibert, S., Jaquinod, M., Ebel, C., Hewat, E., Vincent, F., Vanbelle, C., Concord, E., Vernet, T., and Gulino, D. (2001)J. Biol. Chem. 276, 3581–3588). In an effort to identify which extracellular modules are involved in the elaboration and stability of this hexameric structure, we expressed various VE cadherin-derived fragments overlapping individual or multiple successive modules as soluble proteins, purified each to homogeneity, and tested their propensity to self-associate. Altogether, the results demonstrate that, as their length increases, VE cadherin recombinant fragments generate increasingly complex self-associating structures; although single module fragments do not oligomerize, some two or three module-containing fragments self-assemble as dimers, and four module-containing fragments associate as hexamers. Our results also suggest that, before elaborating a hexameric structure, molecules of VE cadherin self-assemble as intermediate dimers. A synergy between the extracellular modules of VE cadherin is thus required to build homotypic interactions. Placed in a cellular context, this particular self-association mode may reflect the distinctive biological requirements imposed on VE cadherin at adherens junctions in the vascular endothelium.

This protein family contains 50 different classic cadherins in both vertebrates and invertebrates and the recently described human protocadherins (3.Nollet F. Kools P. van Roy F. J. Mol.

Based on their amino acid sequence, classic cadherins were first classified into two subgroups, type I and type II (5.Suzuki S. Sano K. Tanihara H.

More recently, cadherin-5 and -15 that share little sequence similarity with other cadherins or among themselves were considered as two distinct non-type I or II cadherins (7.Shimoyama Y. Tsujimoto G. Kitajima M. Natori M. Biochem. J. 2000; 349: 159-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). Classic cadherin molecules exhibit a similar organization, in particular in their extracellular domain, that consists of five homologous repeats designated EC1 to EC5 and numbered from the N to the C terminus. Type I members show a high degree of protein sequence similarity when compared with the E cadherin sequence and possess, in their N-terminal extracellular module EC1, the HAV cell adhesion recognition sequence (3.Nollet F. Kools P. van Roy F. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 299: 551-572Crossref PubMed Scopus (591) Google Scholar). By contrast, the HAV sequence is absent on the extracellular domain of either type II members or non-type I or II cadherins (8.Shimoyama Y. Shibata T. Kitajima M. Hirohashi S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 10011-10018Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar, 9.Lampugnani M.G. Resnati M. Raiteri M. Pigott R. Pisacane A. Houen G. Ruco L.P. Dejana E. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 118: 1511-1522Crossref PubMed Scopus (552) Google Scholar). The highly conserved cytoplasmic domain of cadherins interacts with β-catenin or γ-catenin (also called plakoglobin) in a mutually exclusive fashion (10.Gumbiner B.M. Neuron. 1993; 11: 551-564Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar, 11.Kemler R. Ozawa M. Ringwald M. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1989; 1: 892-897Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Moreover, β- or γ-catenins also interact with α-catenin which links the cadherin-adhesion complex either directly or indirectly to the actin cytoskeleton (12.Jou T.S. Stewart D.B. Stappert J.

Cell Biol. 1995; 130: 67-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (564) Google Scholar). Cell-cell adhesion is constantly rearranged suggesting that the cadherin-catenin complex is dynamically remodeled. By mediating homotypic interactions, cadherins are responsible for segregation of different cell types and, consequently, are fundamental for the establishment and maintenance of multicellular structures. Several results demonstrate that the homotypic binding regions reside in the extracellular part of cadherins (14.Koch A.W. Pokutta S. Lustig A. Engel J. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 7697-7705Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). High resolution structure determination sheds light on the molecular determinants and organization of homotypic cadherin interactions at cell-cell junctions. Based on the first structure derived from the N-terminal domain of neural cadherin (N-EC1 fragment) (15.Shapiro L. Fannon A.M. Kwong P.D. Thompson A. Lehmann M.S. Grubel G. Legrand J.F. Als-Nielsen J. Colman D.R. Hendrickson W.A. Nature. 1995; 374: 327-337Crossref PubMed Scopus (978) Google Scholar), a model for cadherin-mediated homophilic interactions was proposed (the zipper model) (16.Patel D.J. Gumbiner B.M. Nature. 1995; 374: 306-307Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). It suggests the formation of parallel dimer interfaces (cis dimers) and anti-parallel alignments (trans dimers). Both types of association may reflect interactions occurring between cadherins at the cell surface. Cis dimers involving the five extracellular modules of cadherins may mimic the alignment of two molecules emerging from the same cell, whereas trans dimers mediated by the N-terminal EC1 module may be elaborated by molecules protruding from adjacent cells. Structural data obtained for the two module fragments of E (E-EC1–2) (17.Nagar B. Overduin M. Ikura M. Rini J.M. Nature. 1996; 380: 360-364Crossref PubMed Scopus (565) Google Scholar, 18.Pertz O.

Shapiro L. Neuron. 1998; 20: 1153-1163Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar) cadherin revealed that the length of a single cadherin extracellular module is ∼45 Å. It can be deduced that the cell to cell distance in the zipper model is about 405 Å, a value incompatible with the dimension of cell-cell adherens junctions that ranges from 200 to 250 Å based on electron microscopy analysis. By using direct-force measurements, Leckband and co-workers (20.Leckband D. Sivasankar S. Curr. Opin. Cell. Biol. 2000; 12: 587-592Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar, 21.Sivasankar S. Brieher W. Lavrik N. Gumbiner B. Leckband D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 11820-11824Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar) proposed a new model for homotypic interactions in which cadherin molecules emerging from adjacent cells elaborate antiparallel, completely interdigitated contacts. These structures, which exhibit multiple adhesive contacts involving successive domains along the extracellular region of the protein, possess a length in the range of 250 Å. Here we investigate the mechanism of homotypic interactions mediated by the non-type I or II cadherin 5 (or VE1 cadherin). The distinct phylogenetic attribution of this cadherin is likely to be at the basis of its specialized function. Indeed, VE cadherin is expressed at the surface of a peculiar tissue, the vascular endothelium (9.Lampugnani M.G. Resnati M. Raiteri M. Pigott R. Pisacane A. Houen G. Ruco L.P. Dejana E. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 118: 1511-1522Crossref PubMed Scopus (552) Google Scholar). This tissue is formed of a continuous monolayer of endothelial cells that constitute a physical barrier between blood and underlying tissues. The highly dynamic modulation of endothelial adherens junctions allows the passage of leukocytes from blood toward inflamed tissues (22.Johnson-Leger C. Aurrand-Lions M. Imhof B.A. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 921-933PubMed Google Scholar). In fact, recently, we and others (23.Gulino D. Delachanal E. Concord E. Genoux Y. Morand B. Valiron M.O. Sulpice E. Scaife R. Alemany M. Vernet T.

Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 1915-1923Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) established a critical role for VE cadherin in the modulation of endothelial monolayer permeability and consequently in the control of leukocyte trafficking. Moreover, targeted inactivation of the VE cadherin gene in mice affects remodeling and maturation of endothelial vessels leading to the death of the embryos from severe vascular defects at mid-gestation (25.Gory-Faure S.

Collen D. Dejana E. Cell. 1999; 98: 147-157Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1061) Google Scholar). This demonstrates that VE cadherin is also required for vascular morphology. Furthermore, in contrast to other cadherin family members, VE cadherin is both connected to the actin cytoskeleton and to intermediate filaments (27.Valiron O. Chevrier V. Usson Y. Breviario F. Job D. Dejana E. J. Cell Sci. 1996; 109: 2141-2149Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 28.Kowalczyk A.P. Navarro P. Dejana E. Bornslaeger E.A. Green K.J. Kopp D.S. Borgwardt J.E. J.

Gulino D. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 3581-3588Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar) for the Ca2+-dependent hexameric association of the extracellular region of VE cadherin. This type of oligomerization is difficult to reconcile with structural data obtained for shorter fragments of other cadherins. We have now extended our previous study by analyzing a series of VE cadherin-derived arrays of modules. We show that the degree of oligomerization is related to the number of modules within the array indicating that each module acts in synergy with the neighboring ones during the homotypic assembly of VE cadherin. Altogether, our results suggest that VE cadherin molecules first self-assemble as intermediate dimers involving extracellular modules EC3 and EC4 before elaborating mature hexameric structures. The single module fragments were named VE-ECi, with i corresponding to the position of the respective extracellular module within the extracellular domain of VE cadherin. The multidomain fragments were designated VE-ECi-j, where i and j correspond to the positions of the most N- and the most C-terminal modules, respectively. For instance, VE-EC1–3 starts at the N terminus of module EC1, ends at the C terminus of module EC3, and consequently overlaps the three modules EC1, EC2, and EC3 (Fig. 1A). The oligonucleotide pairs used to produce the cDNA fragments encoding the VE cadherin-derived proteins are summarized in Table I. PCR-amplified products were cloned into different expression vectors. The single module fragments, cloned into the vector pGEX-4T1 (Amersham Biosciences), were expressed as glutathione S-transferase fusion proteins, whereas multimodule fragments, cloned into the vector pET30b+ (Novagen), were expressed as native proteins. The resulting pET-VE cadherin plasmids allowed the expression of VE cadherin multiple module fragments fused to an N-terminal methionine. The coding sequence of all VE cadherin-derived constructs was verified by sequence analysis.Table IOligonucleotides used to produce the different VE cadherin-derived recombinant fragmentsFragmentsOligonucleotidesVE-EC15′5′GGA TCC GAT TGG ATT TGG AAC CAG ATG CAC 3′ BamHI Asp13′5′ GAA TTC TTA CCG ATG CGT GAA CAC AGG CCA GTT GTC 3′ EcoRI stop Arg107VE-EC1–25′5′ TATA CAT ATG GAT TGG ATT TGG AAC CAG ATG CAC 3′ NdeI Asp13′5′ CTC GAA TTC TCA CCG GTT CTG GGG CTC ATC TGG GTC 3′ EcoRI stop Arg244VE-EC1–35′5′ TATA CAT ATG GAT TGG ATT TGG AAC CAG ATG CAC 3′ NdeI Asp13′5′ CTC GAA TTC TCA CTC GTC CAC ATC TGT GAT GTT GAT 3′ EcoRI stop Glu321VE-EC1–45′5′ TATA CAT ATG GAT TGG ATT TGG AAC CAG ATG CAC 3′ NdeI Asp13′5′ CTC GAA TTC TCA CTC CGG GGC ATT GTC ATT CTC ATC 3′ EcoRI stop Glu431VE-EC45′5′ CGT GGA TCC CGA TAC ATG AGC CCT CCC GCG GGA AAC 3′ BamHI Arg3003′5′ GAA TTC TCA CTC CGG GGC ATT GTC ATT CTC ATC 3′ EcoRI stop Glu431VE-EC3–45′5′ TATA CAT ATG ACC CAG ACC AAG TAC ACA TTT GTC 3′ NdeI Thr2123′5′ CTC GAA TTC TCA CTC CGG GGC ATT GTC ATT CTC ATC 3′ EcoRI stop Glu431VE-EC2–45′5′ TATA CAT ATG ACG CAT CGG TTG TTC AAT GCG TCC 3′ NdeI Thr1053′5′ CTC GAA TTC TCA CTC CGG GGC ATT GTC ATT CTC ATC 3′ EcoRI stop Glu431VE-EC1–4m5′5′ GTT CAT GAG GTG GCC GCC AAC TGG CCT GTG 3′ Ala98Ala993′5′ CAC AGG CCA GTT GGC GGC CAG GTC ATG AAC 3′ Ala99 Ala98Restriction sites (underlined) and stop codons are shown in bold.

The first and the last encoded amino acids as well as the mutated positions are also indicated. The mutated fragment VE-EC1–4m was elaborated using the QuickChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene Europe, Amsterdam, The Netherlands). The mutations N98A and D99A were introduced using the synthetic oligonucleotide primers shown in Table I. The single module fragments VE-EC1 and VE-EC4 were purified as GST fusion proteins directly from bacterial lysates using the affinity matrix glutathione-Sepharose 4B (Amersham Biosciences). Removal of the GST tail was achieved by cleavage with thrombin (2× 1 unit/mg fusion protein, 2× for 2 h at room temperature). Following complete digestion, GST was retained by an affinity chromatography step on glutathione-Sepharose 4B (Amersham Biosciences), whereas the VE cadherin fragments eluted in the flow-through. After concentration to 1 mg/ml, VE cadherin-derived proteins were run on a gel filtration Superdex S200 column (Amersham Biosciences) to eliminate degradation products. The multimodule fragments VE-EC1–2, VE-EC1–3, VE-EC1–4, VE-EC3–4, and VE-EC2–4 (Fig. 1A) were produced and purified as described (29.Legrand P. Bibert S. Jaquinod M. Ebel C. Hewat E. Vincent F. Vanbelle C. Concord E. Vernet T. Gulino D. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 3581-3588Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Molar extinction coefficients for VE cadherin fragments were calculated based on their respective amino acid composition using the computer program Protparam Tools of the Expasy server (www.expasy.ch/tools/protparam.html). Multimers of VE cadherin fragments were fractionated at 4 °C by analytical gel filtration on a Superdex S200 column (fractionation range 10,000–500,000 Da, Amersham Biosciences). The hydrodynamic radii (Rh) corresponding to the oligomeric forms of the different VE cadherin fragments were deduced from chromatograms as described previously (29.Legrand P. Bibert S. Jaquinod M. Ebel C. Hewat E. Vincent F. Vanbelle C. Concord E. Vernet T. Gulino D. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 3581-3588Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Two calibration curves connecting Rh to the molecular weights of the corresponding proteins were established using either standard globular proteins (30.Le Maire M. Aggerbeck L.P. Monteilhet C. Andersen J.P. Moller J.V. Anal. Biochem. 1986; 154: 525-535Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar) or VE cadherin fragments. Molecular weight values, used to establish the VE cadherin curve, were calculated from sedimentation coefficients (see the experimental section under “Analytical Ultracentrifugation”) or deduced from the degree of oligomerization determined using cross-linking experiments. The equilibrium between the monomeric (M) and dimeric (D) forms of both VE-EC3–4 and VE-EC2–4 fragments can be described as 2M ↔ D with apparent dissociation constants KD = [M]2/[D], where [M] and [D] correspond to the concentrations of monomer and dimer, respectively. To estimate KD, serial dilutions of the fragments VE-EC3–4 and VE-EC2–4 (10–210 μm) were prepared from 250 μm stock solutions and equilibrated at 4 °C for periods exceeding 48 h. 100 μl of each dilution were injected on the Superdex S200 column using 50 mm Tris, pH 8, containing 150 mm NaCl, and 5 mm CaCl2 as running buffer (0.5 ml/min). No significant dissociation was noticed in a protein concentration range of 10–210 μm despite dilution occurring during the chromatographic run. This very slow dissociation rate allowed estimation of the percentages of monomeric (%M) and dimeric (%D) forms from chromatographic profiles. They were calculated, from their respective chromatographic peaks, after fitting and integration with two Gaussian curves. From these percentages, [M] and [D] were deduced using the following equation: [D] = (%D)Ci/200 and [M] = (%M) Ci/100, where Ci corresponds to the total concentration of the fragments.KD can be finally deduced from the equation ln[D] = 2ln[M] − KD. Prior to digestion, the fragments were equilibrated in 5 mm Ca2+, and their concentrations were adjusted so that they remained oligomeric. Limited proteolysis of the VE cadherin-derived fragments was performed with trypsin at room temperature for 20 min and then blocked using 2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (ICN, Biomedical Inc, Aurora, OH). To establish a comparison between trypsin sensitivity, the various VE cadherin-derived fragments were simultaneously digested using identical standard conditions. The mixtures of peptides were separated by SDS-PAGE, and the gels were stained by Coomassie Blue. The different protein fragments generated by trypsin digestion were individually excised from polyacrylamide gels (lanes 5, Fig. 2A) and subjected to in-gel total proteolysis with trypsin. Practically, excised bands were washed with 50 mm ammonium bicarbonate, destained with acetonitrile (diluted 50/50 in 50 mm ammonium bicarbonate), and dried in a Speedvac evaporator. The gel pieces were re-swollen in 20 μl of 50 mm acetate buffer, pH 7.2, containing 1 μg of trypsin. Following a 2-h digestion at 37 °C, the peptides were extracted with 20 μl of 60% acetonitrile containing 1% trifluoroacetic acid. The combined extracts were desalted on Poros R2 resin. One microliter of the eluate was applied on the dried matrix spot and analyzed as described (31.Shevchenko A. Jensen O.N. Podtelejnikov A.V. Sagliocco F. Wilm M. Vorm O. Mortensen P. Shevchenko A. Boucherie H. Mann M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 14440-14445Crossref PubMed Scopus (1303) Google Scholar). The molecular masses of the resulting peptides were determined using MALDI mass spectrometry that allowed assignment of the cleavage sites. Mass spectra of the recombinant fragments, cross-linked or not, were determined as described previously (29.Legrand P. Bibert S. Jaquinod M. Ebel C. Hewat E. Vincent F. Vanbelle C. Concord E. Vernet T. Gulino D. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 3581-3588Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). The recombinant fragments were cross-linked using N-ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)carbodiimide (EDC from Pierce). EDC was chosen because the coupling reaction is restricted to carboxyl and amino groups separated by only 6 Å, thus preventing unwanted cross-linking between two oligomers. To maintain the oligomeric states, concentrations of the fragments and calcium were adjusted to 50 μm and 5 mm, respectively. Various cross-linking assays were systematically performed with molar ratios between the recombinant fragments and the cross-linker reagent of 37.5, 75, 150, 300, and 600. These experiments were carried out for 2 h at 20 °C in MES buffer, pH 7.0. The cross-linking reactions were terminated by adding 1 m Tris, pH 8.0. Analysis of cross-linked products was then performed on 4–15% gradient Phast gels (Amersham Biosciences). Sedimentation velocity experiments were performed using a Beckman model XL-A analytical centrifuge as described previously (29.Legrand P. Bibert S. Jaquinod M. Ebel C. Hewat E. Vincent F. Vanbelle C. Concord E. Vernet T. Gulino D. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 3581-3588Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). By combining the sedimentation coefficients (s) and the Rh of VE-EC1–3, determined by ultracentrifugation and gel filtration chromatography experiments, the molar mass (M) of this fragment could be calculated using the following equation: s = M(1 − ρv̄)/6πNηRh, where N is the Avogadro number. The partial specific volumes (v̄) for VE-EC1–3 (0.718 ml/g), the density (ρ) (1.0059 g/ml), and the viscosity (η) (1.022 centipoise) were calculated according to the program Sedinterp supplied by D. B. Hayes, T. Laue, and J. Philo (software available at www.bbri.harward.edu/rasmb/rasmb.html). Sedimentation velocity experiments were performed at 42,000 and 60,000 rpm. To evaluate the relative contribution of each extracellular module of VE cadherin to homotypic binding, several recombinant fragments, encompassing variable parts of the extracellular region of human VE cadherin, were expressed in Escherichia coli. The boundary of these fragments was defined according to the cadherin domain organization proposed by Tanihara et al. (6.Tanihara H. Sano K. Heimark R.L. St. John T. Suzuki S. Cell. Adhes. Commun. 1994; 2: 15-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). To improve the stability of some of them, the boundaries of the fragments were also delineated by means of limited proteolysis experiments. Individual modules or arrays of modules are depicted in Fig. 1A. The single module fragments VE-EC1 and VE-EC4 were expressed as N-terminal glutathione S-transferase (GST) fusion proteins and purified by affinity chromatography using glutathione-Sepharose prior to proteolytic cleavage of the GST tag. The multimodule fragments were purified from inclusion bodies and refolded by dilution as described previously (29.Legrand P. Bibert S. Jaquinod M. Ebel C. Hewat E. Vincent F. Vanbelle C. Concord E. Vernet T. Gulino D. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 3581-3588Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). The purity of the VE cadherin fragments was verified by SDS-PAGE analysis (Fig. 1B). N-terminal sequencing revealed that cleavage by thrombin left the exogenous sequence GS at the N termini of fragment VE-EC1 (Table II). Concerning the multimodule fragments, N-terminal sequences corresponded to the expected ones, except for those of the inner fragments VE-EC3–4 and VE-EC2–4 for which the N-terminal methionine was cleaved off (Table II). MALDI mass spectrometry analysis confirmed the identity of the VE cadherin fragments (Table II).Table IICharacterization of VE cadherin recombinant fragmentsFragmentsN-terminal sequencingMassTheoreticalExperimentalTheoretical2-aDetermined using the computer program Protparam Tools of the Expasy server (www.expasy.ch/tools/protparam.html).Experimental2-bMeasured by MALDI mass spectrometry.DaVE-EC1GSDWIWNQMGSDWIWNQ12,55212,554VE-EC1–2MDWIWNQMMDWIWN27,45527,473VE-EC1–3MDWIWNQMMDWI–NQM36,27836,269VE-EC1–4MDWIWNQMMDWIWNQM48,94148,948VE-EC4GSPEFQQPGSPEFQQP12,89012,892VE-EC3–4MTQTKYTFVTQTKYTFV25,19825,198VE-EC2–4MTHRLFNASTHRLFNAS36,81436,816Exogenous methionines at the N termini are shown in bold.

The capacity of the fragments to self-associate was analyzed by gel filtration chromatography, chemical cross-linking, and analytical ultracentrifugation experiments. As illustrated in Fig. 2, the chromatographic profiles differ according to the nature of the fragments. Thus, fragments VE-EC1, VE-EC4, VE-EC1–2 (not shown), and VE-EC1–3 gave single elution peaks for fragment concentrations tested up to 200 μm. In contrast, double distributions (peaks I and II) were observed for the fragments VE-EC3–4, VE-EC2–4, and VE-EC1–4, even at the relatively low concentration of 10 μm, indicating that they possess two different oligomeric states. From the elution volumes of the peaks observed on the chromatograms, the hydrodynamic radii of the different species of each fragment were deduced (Table III and “Materials and Methods”).Table IIIOligomeric states of different VE cadherin fragmentsVE cadherin fragmentsRhS (Svedberg)Molar massesMultimerC50%ÅkDamVE-EC1–438; 672.9; 9.849; 3013-aDetermined by analytical centrifugation.Monomer, hexamer0.5VE-EC1–3332.2363-aDetermined by analytical centrifugation.MonomerVE-EC1–226MonomerVE-EC118.5123-bDetermined by cross-linking experiments.MonomerVE-EC420.5153-bDetermined by cross-linking experiments.MonomerVE-EC3–430; 4030; 603-bDetermined by cross-linking experiments.Monomer, dimer80VE-EC2–436; 5036; 673-bDetermined by cross-linking experiments.Monomer, dimer25The oligomeric states of the different fragments were determined either by analytical centrifugation or by cross-linking experiments.

The estimation that mammalian cells suffer at least 10 spontaneous DSB/day suggests that efficient repair of DSB is critical for cell survival (1.Haber J.E. Trends Genet. 2000; 16: 259-264Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (461) Google Scholar). Failure to do so can result in deleterious genomic rearrangements, cell cycle arrest, or cell death. double-strand break(s) blunt ccc, covalently closed circle nonhomologous DNA end joining open circle purine pyrimidine restriction enzyme single-strand break(s) triplex-forming oligo Chinese hamster ovary 3-(N-morpholino)-2-hydroxypropanesulfonic acid double-strand break(s) blunt ccc, covalently closed circle nonhomologous DNA end joining open circle purine pyrimidine restriction enzyme single-strand break(s) triplex-forming oligo Chinese hamster ovary 3-(N-morpholino)-2-hydroxypropanesulfonic acid Recent studies have revealed that DSB in the genomes of higher eukaryotes can be repaired by at least three different pathways (2.Pfeiffer P. Goedecke W. Obe G. Mutagenesis. 2000; 15: 289-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (338) Google Scholar): (i) Homologous recombination repair, the most accurate process, is able to restore the original sequence at the break. Because of its strict dependence on extensive sequence homology, this mechanism is suggested to be active mainly during the S and G2 phases of the cell cycle (3.Haber J.E. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1999; 24: 271-275Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar, 4.Haber J.E. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2000; 12: 286-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). (ii) Single-stranded annealing is another homology-dependent but less accurate process that can repair DSB between direct repeats and thereby produces mainly interstitial deletions (4.Haber J.E. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2000; 12: 286-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). (iii) Nonhomologous DNA end joining (NHEJ) comprises at least two different processes (5.Feldmann E. Schmiemann V. Goedecke W. Reichenberger S. Pfeiffer P. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 2585-2596Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). The major and best investigated NHEJ pathway depends on the Ku70/80 heterodimer, the catalytic subunit of the DNA-dependent protein kinase, DNA ligase IV, and its essential co-factor XRCC4 (6.Critchlow S.E. Jackson S.P. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1998; 23: 394-398Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (485) Google Scholar, 7.Featherstone C. Jackson S.P. Curr. Biol. 1999; 9: R759-R761Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). In contrast to homologous recombination repair and single-stranded annealing, NHEJ can operate in the absence of sequence homology (although short sequence homologies, so-called microhomologies, may facilitate the process) and is able to rejoin broken ends directly (2.Pfeiffer P. Goedecke W. Obe G. Mutagenesis. 2000; 15: 289-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (338) Google Scholar). This process is supposed to occur mainly in the G0 and G1 phases of the cell cycle and is considered to be the major pathway of DSB repair in mammalian cells, although it is typically accompanied by loss or gain of a few nucleotides. The regulation of these different pathways and their relative contributions to mammalian DSB repair have yet to be comprehended (1.Haber J.E. Trends Genet. 2000; 16: 259-264Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (461) Google Scholar). To elucidate the mechanisms of NHEJ, many studies have made use of restriction endonucleases (RE) to introduce defined DSB in the genomic DNA of cultured mammalian cells (8.Bryant P.E. Int. J.

The fact that RE-induced DSB are exactly defined with respect to their structure (depending on the enzyme used: 5′- or 3′-overhangs or blunt ends; always 3′-hydroxyl and 5′-phosphate) and position within a given DNA sequence has greatly facilitated study of the efficiency and fidelity of DSB repair mechanisms in the above-mentioned systems by comparing the original DSB termini and the resulting repair site (junction). As opposed to such “clean” DSB, which are repaired very efficiently because they are accepted substrates of DNA-modifying enzymes, DSB generated by ionizing radiation or certain chemical agents are more complex and may, for instance, contain damaged sugar and base moieties and 5′-hydroxyl and 3′-phosphate groups. In addition, the investigation of the repair of such complex DSB on the molecular level is aggravated by the fact that these “dirty” DSB are usually randomly distributed and not positioned within a specific DNA sequence. Experimental approaches comprise the analysis of the mutational spectra generated by ionizing radiation or chemicals in selectable cellular genes (23.Phillips J.W. Morgan W.F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 5794-5803Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar) and the use of oligonucleotides with unusual terminal structures in cell-free extracts (24.Beyert N. Reichenberger S. Peters M. Hartung M. Gottlich B. Goedecke W. Vielmetter W. Pfeiffer P. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 1643-1650Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar) and plasmids carrying at their ends oligonucleotides damaged by bleomycin (25.Chen S. Inamdar K.V. Pfeiffer P. Feldmann E. Hannah M.F. Yu Y. Lee J.W. Zhou T. Lees-Miller S.P. Povirk L.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 24323-24330Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar, 26.Bennett R.A.

Chem. 1996; 271: 19660-19663Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). A novel approach called gene-targeted radiotherapy has recently opened the possibility to target the radiodamage produced by Auger electron emitters such as 125I to a specific DNA sequence (as opposed to random targeting of total genomic DNA in traditional radiotherapy) (28.Panyutin I.G. Winters T.A. Feinendegen L.E. Neumann R.D. Q. J. Nucl. Med. 2000; 44: 256-267PubMed Google Scholar). Auger electron emitters are a large group of radioisotopes that decay by electron capture and/or conversion emitting a cascade of low energy electrons that produces a highly charged daughter atom. The combined effect of low energy electrons and positively charged daughter atoms results in highly localized damage to the molecular structures within a short range from the decay site (Auger effect). Decay of 125I results in emission of, on average, 21 electrons and produces a correspondingly positively charged tellurium atom. Incorporated into DNA, the decay of125I produces DSB localized mostly within one turn of the double-helix around the decay site (10 bp) with an efficiency of 0.8 DSB/decay. This extremely short range of radiodamage produced by125I led to the idea of targeting this Auger electron emitter to specific genes within genomic or plasmid DNA (29.Sedelnikova O.A. Luu A.N. Karamychev V.N. Panyutin I.G. Neumann R.D. Int. J. Radiat. Oncol. Biol. Phys. 2001; 49: 391-396Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Sequence-specific delivery of 125I-induced radiodamage is achieved by the use of triplex-forming oligonucleotides (TFO), short single-stranded oligonucleotides capable of forming triple helixes (triplexes) with polypurine:polypyrimidine sequences. In such triplexes, the TFO occupies the major groove of the target double-helix and forms Hoogsteen hydrogen bonds with the purines of the Watson-Crick base pairs. The specificity of sequence recognition is comparable with that provided by complementary Watson-Crick base pairing (30.Panyutin I.G. Neumann R.D. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 883-887Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 31.Panyutin I.G. Neumann R.D. Acta Oncol. 1996; 35: 817-823Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 32.Panyutin I.G. Neumann R.D. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 4979-4982Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). To investigate the repair of site-specific 125I-induced DSB, a TFO labeled on its 3′-end with 125I (125I-TFO) was used to introduce DSB within its target sequence on plasmid pUC19-MDR1 (33.Panyutin I.V. Luu A.N. Panyutin I.G. Neumann R.D. Radiat. Res. 2001; 156: 158-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). The linearized plasmid was incubated with cell-free extracts from CHO cells capable of performing efficient NHEJ (5.Feldmann E. Schmiemann V. Goedecke W. Reichenberger S. Pfeiffer P. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 2585-2596Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). We show that the repair of the125I-induced DSB is about a factor of 10 less efficient than the repair of RE-induced DSB. The resulting spectrum of junctions shows deletions of varying sizes resembling the ones found in selectable genes after irradiation of mammalian cells with ionizing radiation. Our study may contribute to the understanding of how the damage produced by Auger electron emitters is repaired by mechanisms of NHEJ, which is important for their application in gene-targeted radiotherapy. The two wild-type Chinese hamster ovary cell lines, CHO-K1 and AA8, were grown at 37 °C in a humidified 5% CO2atmosphere in Ham's F-12 medium enriched with 10% fetal calf serum, 2 mml-glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. Whole cell extracts from CHO-K1 and AA8 cells were prepared exactly as described previously (5.Feldmann E. Schmiemann V. Goedecke W. Reichenberger S. Pfeiffer P. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 2585-2596Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar, 17.Daza P. Reichenberger S. Göttlich B. Hagmann M. Feldmann E. Pfeiffer P. Biol. Chem. Hoppe-Seyler. 1996; 377: 775-786Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). In each preparation, ∼5 × 108 cells of each cell line were used to yield 0.5–1 ml of extract with a protein concentration ranging between 6–10 mg/ml. The extracts were stored in 50-μl aliquots in liquid nitrogen and remained active for 6–12 months. Directly prior to use in the NHEJ reaction, the extract aliquot was dialyzed against freshly prepared M buffer (50 mm MOPSO-NaOH, pH 7.5, 40 mmKCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 5 mm2-mercaptoethanol) on microdialysis filters (0.025-μm pore diameter; catalog number VSWPO2500; Millipore) for 30 min at 4 °C. Labeling of the TFO with125I-dC was performed by extension of the 3′-end of a primer in the presence of 125I-dCTP (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) and Klenow fragment of DNA polymerase I as described previously (33.Panyutin I.V. Luu A.N. Panyutin I.G. Neumann R.D. Radiat. Res. 2001; 156: 158-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). To form a triplex, topoisomerase-relaxed pUC19-MDR1, a 2727-bp derivative of pUC19 containing a 32-bp polypurine-polypyrimidine fragment from the MDR1 gene as TFO-target sequence (see Fig. 1 and Refs. 33.Panyutin I.V. Luu A.N. Panyutin I.G. Neumann R.D. Radiat. Res. 2001; 156: 158-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar and 34.Sedelnikova O.A. Panyutin I.G. Luu A.N. Reed M.W. Licht T. Gottesman M.M. Neumann R.D. Antisense Nucleic Acid Drug Dev. 2000; 10: 443-452Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar) was mixed with purified125I-TFO in 30 mm NaAc buffer, pH 5.0, and heated to 70 °C for 3 min followed by slow cooling to room temperature. For the accumulation of 125I decays, the sample was stored at −70 °C. After a period of 60 days (the half-life of 125I), about 50% of total covalently closed circular (ccc) pUC19-MDR1 was converted to open circle (oc), and about 20% was converted to linear DNA indicative of double-strand breakage of the plasmid as estimated by separation of the products in 1.5% agarose gels containing ethidium bromide. To remove contaminating oc and ccc DNA, the linear form of pUC19-MDR1 was purified twice over 1.5% preparative low melting point NuSieve agarose (BioProducts FMC) gels in TAE buffer (40 mm Tris-HAc, pH 7.4, 12 mm NaAc, 0.1 mm EDTA) containing 0.5 μg/ml ethidium bromide. Electrophoresis was performed at 2 V/cm for 24 h with continuously recirculated TAE buffer containing 0.5 μg/ml ethidium bromide, and separation of DNA in oc, linear, and ccc forms was visualized under UV light. Linear DNA was purified using the Agar ACETM agarose-digesting enzyme (Promega) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The samples were purified further by two extractions with phenol and phenol:chloroform:isoamyl alcohol (25:24:1; Invitrogen) and precipitated with ethanol. After resuspension in 50 μl of TE (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 0.1 mmEDTA) the samples were finally purified by gel filtration through G-50 Microspin columns (Amersham Biosciences). The resulting linearized pUC19-MDR1 substrate used in extract joining assays was found to contain on the average less than 5% of contaminating oc DNA and no ccc DNA at all. The three substrates for cohesive (coh.) and blunt (bl.) end ligation were derived from pUC19-MDR1 by digestion with a single restriction enzyme (BamHI: 5′-coh.;PstI: 3′-coh.; HincII: bl.). The five substrates containing noncomplementary ends were derived from a 4-kb modified pUC19-MDR1-λ construct harboring a 1.25-kb fragment of λ-DNA between the restriction sites used for substrate preparation. Generation of substrates containing two noncomplementary ends was controlled by quantitative excision of the λ insert. Each substrate was named after the pair of RE used in its preparation (Eco/Asp, 5′/5′; Sac/Kpn, 3′/3′; Eco/Sma, 5′/bl.;Sac/Sma, 3′/bl.; Eco/Kpn, 5′/3′). All RE-linearized substrates were gel-purified using a gel extraction kit (Qiagen). In standard reactions, 10 ng of 125I-TFO- or RE-linearized plasmid substrate, respectively, were incubated for up to 360 min at 25 °C in a total volume of 10 μl containing 6–8 μg/μl of extract protein in M buffer supplemented with 1 mm ATP, pH 7.5, and 200 μm dNTPs (50 μm each) and 50 ng/μl bovine serum albumin. The reactions were terminated by adjustment to 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 10 mm EDTA, 1% SDS and incubation at 65 °C for 5 min. After digestion for 30 min at 37 °C with 2 mg/ml proteinase K, equivalents of 2 ng of substrate DNA were electrophoresed in 1% agarose gels in the presence of 1 μg/ml ethidium bromide to separate oc from ccc products and visualized by in situ gel hybridization (35.Thode S. Schäfer A. Pfeiffer P. Vielmetter W. Cell. 1990; 60: 921-928Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar) using a pUC19-specific probe labeled with [32P]α-dCTP by random priming. Reaction products were quantified in a phosphorimaging facility (Packard Bioscience) as percentages of the total radioactivity/lane. Circular joined products were cloned by transformation of 4-ng equivalents of substrate DNA of each NHEJ sample in Escherichia coli strain DH5α to yield single clones that were purified by miniscale extraction. In the case of 125I-TFO-linearized pUC19-MDR1, the samples were digested with BglII prior to transformation to remove oc contaminants originating from substrate preparation that could yield false positives. Clones from 125I-TFO-linearized pUC19-MDR1 were subjected again to cleavage with BglII, and only BglII-resistant clones were analyzed by sequencing (Seqlab). The clones from ligation products (Bam, Pst, and Sma) were subjected to cleavage with the original RE to check for accurate ligation. The clones from NHEJ products (Eco/Asp, Sac/Kpn, Eco/Sma, Sac/Sma, and Eco/Kpn) were analyzed directly by sequencing (ABI Prism 377 DNA Sequencer; PerkinElmer Life Sciences). For the analysis of dimer products from 125I-TFO-linearized pUC19-MDR1, the dimer band was gel-purified using a gel extraction kit (Qiagen). Dimer junctions were amplified by PCR with 2.5 units of Taq polymerase in Taq buffer (MBI Fermentas) in a total volume of 50 μl containing 1 ng of dimer product, 20 pmol of each primer (pUC19-MDR1-For, 5′-GGGGCCTCTTCGCTATTACG; pUC19-MDR1-Rev, 5′-AGGCACCCCAGGCTTTACACTTTA), 2.5 mm MgCl2, and 200 μm of each dNTP. PCR was performed in a thermocycler (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) for 30 cycles (30 s 95 °C; 30 s 54 °C; 1 min 72 °C). The resulting 300-bp PCR product was digested with BglII to remove PCR products possibly originating from oc contaminants. BglII-resistant PCR product was gel-purified and subcloned using a cloning kit (Invitrogen). The resulting clones were purified by miniscale extraction and subjected again to cleavage with BglII, and only BglII-resistant clones were analyzed by sequencing. For the diagrams in Fig. 8 (A and B), the following calculations were performed. The distribution of breaks around the125I decay site had been measured previously as single-strand breaks (SSB) occurring in the Pu-rich and Py-rich strand, respectively (33.Panyutin I.V. Luu A.N. Panyutin I.G. Neumann R.D. Radiat. Res. 2001; 156: 158-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar) (see bars in Fig. 1) and is given here as the average probability ((Pu + Py)/2) of all types of DSB (gray bars in Fig. 8, A and B; see “Discussion” for details) to occur at a given base pair position. The relative frequencies for the occurrence of the breakpoints of junctions 2–34 (see Fig. 5) at a particular nucleotide (black bars in Fig. 8A) were calculated as follows: (i) Blunt junctions. The number of a particular junction was normalized to the total number of junctions (64) and divided by two because the breakpoint can be either counted to the left or to the right side of the deletion (e.g. junction 8 in Fig. 5); because this junction occurred twice, its relative frequency would be 2/64 = 0.0313. Because the breakpoint can be counted either to the A on the left side or to the C on the right side, the relative frequency of this breakpoint at the A and C, respectively, is 0.0156. (ii) Microhomology junctions. The calculation was performed as for blunt junctions with the additional inclusion of a factor for the microhomology (e.g. junction 23 in Fig. 5) that occurs twice and exhibits a 2-bp homology (AG) with three possible breakpoints. Therefore, the relative frequency of the breakpoints would be 2/64 × 2 × 3= 0.0052 for any nucleotide within the microhomology and each of the nucleotides flanking the microhomology on the left and right side, respectively (A, A, and G on the left side and the A, G, and T, on the right side). Each black bar in the diagram represents the sum of the relative frequencies of all breakpoints occurring at a particular nucleotide of the target sequence. The χ2 test was performed for Fig. 8A. Multiplication of the average probability of a DSB at a given base pair by the number of total junctions [(Pu + Py)/2] × 4 yields the expected frequency (E) of a junction to occur at this base pair, which was compared with the observed frequency (O) of junctions occurring at this position. The χ2 value was calculated using the formula (O −E)2/E. Because the distribution of observed junctions spans a larger sequence region (27 bp) than the distribution of DSB (19 bp; 5′-GAAG…… GAGT), only the junctions falling into this 19-bp region were taken into account resulting in 19 categories yielding a degree of freedom of 18. The estimated χ2 value is 49.54 (Σ(O −E)2/E) and significantly larger than 28.87, the value for the 5% interval for the degree of freedom of 18. Therefore, the hypothesis that junction formation is a random process that follows the distribution of the 125I-TFO-induced DSB has to be rejected (see “Discussion”). The distribution of nucleotides deleted around the decay site (see black bars in Fig. 8B) was calculated as follows. In the 64 junctions (see Fig. 4, junctions 2–34), a total of 422 nucleotides were deleted (e.g. the G* in the target sequence that was lost unambiguously in 41 cases and was part of a microhomology in 14 cases; see the dots in the sequences of Fig. 5). Because it was unknown from which of the two DSB ends the G in the corresponding microhomology originated, 14 was divided by two (14/2 = 7) so that the relative frequency at which the G* is lost in all 64 junctions is (41+7)/422 = 0.1137. Each black bar in the diagram represents the relative frequency with which a particular nucleotide was deleted from the target sequence. Annealing the 125I-TFO to its target sequence within pUC19-MDR1 and subsequent incubation for 60 days at −70 °C yield sequence-specific DSB within a short region of about 10 bp in each direction opposite the 125I-dC within the unique BglII site (A/GATCT) of the plasmid (Fig. 1). The distribution and relative frequencies of breaks had been determined previously by analysis of the SSB occurring in the Pu- and Py-rich strand, respectively, which is indicated schematically in Fig. 1 (33.Panyutin I.V. Luu A.N. Panyutin I.G. Neumann R.D. Radiat. Res. 2001; 156: 158-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). The slightly asymmetric distribution of SSB in the two strands reflects the structure of the Py motif triple helix. Gel-purified 125I-TFO-linearized pUC19-MDR was subjected to DNA end joining in cell-free extracts from CHO-K1 and AA8 cells as described under “Experimental Procedures.” For comparison, extract joining reactions were also carried out with pUC19-MDR1 linearized by restriction endonucleases. NHEJ reaction products were separated in agarose gels, and the corresponding repair sites (junctions) were cloned in E. coli for subsequent sequence analysis. To determine the efficiency of NHEJ of the 125I-TFO-linearized substrate, we used different RE-linearized substrates for comparison. Substrates generated by cleavage with a single RE have compatible ends that allow measurement of the efficiency of ligation of cohesive 5′- (Bam) or 3′-ends (Pst), respectively, or blunt ends (HincII). Substrates generated by cleavage with two different RE have noncomplementary DNA ends (Eco/Asp, 5′/5′; Sac/Kpn, 3′/3′; Eco/Sma, 5′/bl.;Sac/Sma, 3′/bl.; Eco/Kpn, 5′/3′) that allow measurement of the efficiency of genuine nonhomologous end joining. This type of end joining is more complex and requires more factors than “simple” cohesive or blunt end ligation because the ends must be converted first into a ligatable form by DNA fill-in synthesis and/or exonucleolytic removal of nonmatching bases (36.Pfeiffer P. Toxicol. Lett. 1998; 96–97: 119-129Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar) (Fig. 2 and below). Rejoining of125I-TFO-induced DSB is expected to be even more complex because these dirty breaks may contain damaged sugar and base moieties, 5′-hydroxyl and 3′-phosphate groups that are not substrates for DNA-modifying enzymes such as DNA ligase or DNA polymerase and therefore must be removed prior to NHEJ (25.Chen S. Inamdar K.V. Pfeiffer P. Feldmann E. Hannah M.F. Yu Y. Lee J.W. Zhou T. Lees-Miller S.P. Povirk L.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 24323-24330Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar, 27.Gu X.Y. Bennett R.A. Povirk L.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 19660-19663Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). In addition to that, it is important to note that each RE substrate contains only a single type of DSB with ends exactly defined in structure and sequence. In contrast, the 125I-TFO substrate represents a mixture of molecules containing many different types of DSB because of the fact that the 125I-TFO induces multiple breaks distributed along a 19-bp region (see also “Discussion” and Fig. 8). Therefore, the term “complex DSB” used below not only includes the presumptive dirty DSB but also a large variety of DSB ends differing in structure and sequence. The extract-mediated NHEJ reaction converts all three different substrate types into monomeric oc reaction intermediates, ccc products, and linear multimers (mostly dimers), which are readily separated in agarose gels. In standard reactions, about 30–50% of the RE substrate input are converted into ccc and dimer products and the ratio of ccc:dimer product is ∼2:1 (but may vary with the batch of extract used and other factors like protein concentration and DNA concentration). We did not find any quantitative or qualitative differences between the CHO-K1 extract and the AA8 extract. A representative example of the reaction kinetics of three of the eight RE substrates and the 125I-TFO substrate is given in Fig. 3. As reflected by the levels of ccc product formation after 6 h at 25 °C, the reaction is most efficient with the ligation of cohesive (Pst) and blunt ends (HincII) that converts on the average 37% of the input substrate into ccc product (and 12% into dimers). Rejoining of noncomplementary RE ends (Eco/Kpn) is somewhat less efficient and converts on the average 29% of the linear"

Although the concept of DNA repair coupled with transcription has been widely accepted, its mechanisms remain elusive. We recently reported that in Chinese hamster ovary cells while ultraviolet light-induced cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers (CPDs) are preferentially repaired in the transcribed strand of dihydrofolate reductase gene, CPDs are efficiently repaired in both strands of adenine phosphoribosyltransferase (APRT) locus, in either a transcribed or nontranscribed APRT gene (1.Zheng Y.

These results suggested that the transcription dependence of repair may depend on genomic context. To test this hypothesis, we constructed transfectant cell lines containing a single, actively transcribed APRT gene, integrated at different genomic sites. Mapping of CPD repair in the integrated APRT genes in three transfectant cell lines revealed two distinct repair patterns, either preferential repair of CPDs in the transcribed strand or very poor repair in both strands. Similar kinetics of micrococcal nuclease digestion were seen for all three transfectant APRT gene domains and endogenous APRT locus. Our results suggest that both the efficiency and strand-specificity of repair of an actively transcribed gene are profoundly affected by genomic context but do not reflect changes in first order nucleosomal structure.

We further found that in two different mutant cell lines (ATS-88 and T2S-24) in which the entire promoter region and first two exons of the APRT gene have been deleted CPDs are also repaired with equal efficiency in both strands of the APRT gene domain even though neither strand is transcribed in these cell lines (1.Zheng Y.

Our results suggested that NER of DNA damage in the APRT gene is not dependent on transcription. These findings raise the following important questions. (i) Is the endogenous APRT locus intrinsically more accessible to DNA repair than other genomic regions? (ii) If so, would translocation of the APRT gene to different genomic locations change either the overall efficiency or strand-specificity with which it is repaired? (iii) Finally, what are the factors that determine the role of the transcription process in repair?To address these questions we transfected APRT− T2S-24 cells with genomic DNA from wild-type (APRT+) Chinese hamster cells to obtain stable APRT+ transfectants that contained single-copy random integrations of a functional APRT gene integrated into different genomic sites. In this study we used three such independently derived APRT+transfectants (G-37, G-47, and G-69) to examine the effects of genomic context on the efficiency and strand-specificity of DNA repair.DISCUSSIONEnhanced or preferential repair of DNA damage on the T strand has been observed in a number of genes in mammalian cells including the dihydrofolate reductase, p53, hypoxanthine phosphoribosyltransferase, and adenine deaminase gene loci (Refs. 9.Mellon I.

Sancar A. Science. 1993; 260: 53-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (560) Google Scholar,8.Selby C.P. Sancar A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 8232-8236Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar), the mechanisms and factors involved in TCR in eukaryotic cells remain elusive. Recent studies by Sweder and co-workers (32.Bucheli M. Lommel L. Sweder K. Genetics. 2001; 158: 989-997PubMed Google Scholar, 33.Gregory S.M. Sweder K. Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: 3080-3086Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar) found the following observations. (i) The defect in TCR displayed by the original Saccharomyces cerevisiae rad26 mutant (the yeast counterpart of the mammalian CSB Cockayne syndrome gene) is not observed when these cells are grown using galactose as a carbon source. (ii) Deletion of the RAD26 gene in two other repair-proficient yeast genetic backgrounds resulted in strains that are proficient in TCR regardless of carbon source. Furthermore, whereas it has been possible to reconstitute NER in mammalian cell-free systems, TCR has not yet been demonstrated in such systems despite the concerted efforts of many well established laboratories (5.Hanawalt P.C. Mutat. Res. 2001; 485: 3-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Most attempts to demonstrate TCR in vitro in mammalian cell-free systems have used a single plasmid-borne gene that can be transcribed in vitro. However, such repair substrates lack chromatin structure and are poor models for endogenous genes whose normal genomic contexts typically involve large domains including the surrounding flanking regions. Based on our findings we would argue that TCR in mammalian cells may not be a uniform phenomenon for all gene loci but may be strongly dependent on genomic context.The APRT+/0 hemizygous CHO-AT3-2 cell line (which contains a single functional copy of the APRT gene at its normal endogenous locus) together with our G-37, G-47, and G-69 APRT+ transfectant cell lines (in which a single functional APRT gene along with its normal 5′- and 3′-flanking sequences has been randomly integrated into different genomic sites) provide an experimental system that has allowed us to examine how TCR and repair in general are affected by placing the same actively transcribed gene into different genomic contexts. We have demonstrated the following points. (i) In each of these three APRT+transfectant cell lines the integrated APRT gene is actively expressed at approximately the same level as the endogenous APRT locus in CHO-AT3-2 cells (which are hemizygous). (ii) In each case only one strand of the APRT gene is transcribed. All four cell lines have a clear-cut APRT+phenotype; they grow vigorously in ALASA selection medium and rapidly die when plated into medium containing 8-azaadenine.We have observed three different patterns of CPD repair in the APRT gene in these four cell lines. First, in CHO-AT3-2 cells CPDs are efficiently repaired in both the T and NT strands in exons 1 and 2 of the endogenous APRT gene. These results further support and reinforce our original findings that NER at the endogenous APRT gene locus is not dependent upon transcription (1.Zheng Y. Pao A. Adair G.M. Tang M.-s. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 16786-16796Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). In contrast, CPDs are preferentially repaired in the T strand in exons 1 and 2 of the integrated APRT gene in G-69 cells. Finally, CPDs are poorly repaired in both the T and NT strands in exons 1 and 2 of the integrated APRT gene in G-37 and G-47 cells even though the APRT genes in both of these APRT+ transfectant cell lines are actively transcribed. Together these results suggest that both the efficiency and strand-specificity of CPD repair in transcriptionally active genes in mammalian cells are highly dependent upon genomic context. How can different genomic contexts that do not appear to have any noticeable effects on APRT gene transcription so profoundly affect the efficiency and strand-specificity of repair of this gene?Using mononucleosome or dinucleosome systems, several laboratories have demonstrated that nucleosomal structure can inhibit repair of CPD (34.Liu X. Smerdon M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 23729-23735Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar) and <6–4> photoproducts (35.Hara R. Mo J. Sancar A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 9173-9181Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar, 36.Ura K. Araki M. Saeki H. Masutani C. Ito T. Iwai S. Mizukoshi T. Kaneda Y. Hanaoka F. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 2004-2014Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar) in in vitro nucleotide excision assays. We therefore sought to determine whether the differences in CPD repair efficiencies we have observed for transfectant APRT gene domains and the endogenous APRT locus might be caused by differences in nucleosomal structure or nucleosome density in the APRT gene in these different genomic contexts. To investigate this possibility we examined the kinetics of micrococcal nuclease digestion at the integrated APRT gene domains in the G-37, G-47, and G-69 transfectant cell lines, compared with digestion at the endogenous APRTgene locus. As shown in Fig. 6 no differences were apparent. Essentially identical results were obtained for all four cell lines (only data from AT3-2, G-37, and G-69 are shown). These results suggest that genomic context-dependent regulation of repair does not involve first order nucleosome structure but might involve higher order chromatin structure.Our current understanding of chromatin structure and the effects of transcription on chromatin structure have not yet provided a clear picture of how these two factors regulate DNA repair. Our results together with other data accumulated to date suggest that the efficiency of repair of a region of genomic DNA is determined primarily by chromatin structure. Active genes typically have very different chromatin structures than inactive genes or noncoding regions and may be much more accessible to or have a greater affinity for DNA repair proteins. Transcription itself may increase the regional accessibility of a localized region or enhance its affinity for damage recognition/repair proteins, but transcription per se does not appear to be a prerequisite for remodeling; remodeling may precede transcription. If the inherent chromatin structure of a gene does not allow ready access by DNA repair proteins it is possible that chromatin remodeling preceding transcription or transcription-mediated chromatin changes may greatly enhance the accessibility of the gene to repair or at least promote TCR in its T strand. We believe that CPD repair in the integrated APRT gene in G-69 cells may reflect such processes. However, if the local chromatin structure surrounding a gene has already rendered the region maximally accessible to repair proteins, as may be the case for the endogenous CHO APRTgene locus, then further chromatin remodeling or active transcription would not be necessary to facilitate repair, and DNA damage on both strands might be repaired with equal efficiency.Our findings that UV-induced CPDs on both strands are poorly repaired in the actively transcribed integrated APRT gene domains in G-37 and G-47 cells are difficult to reconcile with the results obtained for the G-69 cell line. Whereas it is easy to envision how chromatin remodeling preceding transcription or chromatin changes produced by transcription might increase accessibility or enhance affinity for damage-recognition/repair proteins, it is harder to explain how a genomic environment that allows normal levels of transcription could be so refractory to repair. However, integration of actively transcribed APRT genes (which are somewhat protected by buffering 5′- and 3′-flanking sequences, including a 5′-unmethylated CpG island) into regions of heterochromatin in the G-37 and G-47 transfectants could result in progressive de novomethylation that might gradually spread from downstream sequences into the APRT gene. Hypermethylation of CpG sites in the coding sequence of the integrated APRT genes in the G-37 and G-47 cell lines might interfere with the interactions with histones or other nucleoproteins in ways that might impede or slow down the normal repair processes. The CpG sites in exons 1 and 2 of the APRTgene are normally completely unmethylated, but their methylation would be unlikely to affect transcription unless de novomethylation has spread all the way to the APRT promoter region. However, results in Fig. 4A and B show that all the CpG sites at exon 1 and exon 2 in AT3-2, G-37, and G69 cell lines are equally sensitive to hydrazine modification indicating that these sites are not methylated. Alternatively, it is possible that the APRT gene domains in the G-37 and G-47 transfectant cell lines could have been integrated into late replicating regions that may still allow transcription but are refractory to repair during most of the cell cycle. Both prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells have the capacity to repair DNA damage preferentially in the transcribed (T)1 strand of transcriptionally active genes (for review, see Refs. 2.Bohr V.A.

Sancar A. Science. 1993; 260: 53-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (560) Google Scholar,8.Selby C.P. Sancar A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 8232-8236Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar), the mechanisms and factors involved in TCR in eukaryotic cells remain elusive. Recent studies by Sweder and co-workers (32.Bucheli M. Lommel L. Sweder K. Genetics. 2001; 158: 989-997PubMed Google Scholar, 33.Gregory S.M. Sweder K. Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: 3080-3086Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar) found the following observations. (i) The defect in TCR displayed by the original Saccharomyces cerevisiae rad26 mutant (the yeast counterpart of the mammalian CSB Cockayne syndrome gene) is not observed when these cells are grown using galactose as a carbon source. (ii) Deletion of the RAD26 gene in two other repair-proficient yeast genetic backgrounds resulted in strains that are proficient in TCR regardless of carbon source. Furthermore, whereas it has been possible to reconstitute NER in mammalian cell-free systems, TCR has not yet been demonstrated in such systems despite the concerted efforts of many well established laboratories (5.Hanawalt P.C. Mutat. Res. 2001; 485: 3-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Most attempts to demonstrate TCR in vitro in mammalian cell-free systems have used a single plasmid-borne gene that can be transcribed in vitro. However, such repair substrates lack chromatin structure and are poor models for endogenous genes whose normal genomic contexts typically involve large domains including the surrounding flanking regions. Based on our findings we would argue that TCR in mammalian cells may not be a uniform phenomenon for all gene loci but may be strongly dependent on genomic context.The APRT+/0 hemizygous CHO-AT3-2 cell line (which contains a single functional copy of the APRT gene at its normal endogenous locus) together with our G-37, G-47, and G-69 APRT+ transfectant cell lines (in which a single functional APRT gene along with its normal 5′- and 3′-flanking sequences has been randomly integrated into different genomic sites) provide an experimental system that has allowed us to examine how TCR and repair in general are affected by placing the same actively transcribed gene into different genomic contexts. We have demonstrated the following points. (i) In each of these three APRT+transfectant cell lines the integrated APRT gene is actively expressed at approximately the same level as the endogenous APRT locus in CHO-AT3-2 cells (which are hemizygous). (ii) In each case only one strand of the APRT gene is transcribed. All four cell lines have a clear-cut APRT+phenotype; they grow vigorously in ALASA selection medium and rapidly die when plated into medium containing 8-azaadenine.We have observed three different patterns of CPD repair in the APRT gene in these four cell lines. First, in CHO-AT3-2 cells CPDs are efficiently repaired in both the T and NT strands in exons 1 and 2 of the endogenous APRT gene. These results further support and reinforce our original findings that NER at the endogenous APRT gene locus is not dependent upon transcription (1.Zheng Y. Pao A. Adair G.M. Tang M.-s. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 16786-16796Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). In contrast, CPDs are preferentially repaired in the T strand in exons 1 and 2 of the integrated APRT gene in G-69 cells. Finally, CPDs are poorly repaired in both the T and NT strands in exons 1 and 2 of the integrated APRT gene in G-37 and G-47 cells even though the APRT genes in both of these APRT+ transfectant cell lines are actively transcribed. Together these results suggest that both the efficiency and strand-specificity of CPD repair in transcriptionally active genes in mammalian cells are highly dependent upon genomic context. How can different genomic contexts that do not appear to have any noticeable effects on APRT gene transcription so profoundly affect the efficiency and strand-specificity of repair of this gene?Using mononucleosome or dinucleosome systems, several laboratories have demonstrated that nucleosomal structure can inhibit repair of CPD (34.Liu X. Smerdon M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 23729-23735Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar) and <6–4> photoproducts (35.Hara R. Mo J. Sancar A. Mol. Cell.

EMBO J. 2001; 20: 2004-2014Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar) in in vitro nucleotide excision assays. We therefore sought to determine whether the differences in CPD repair efficiencies we have observed for transfectant APRT gene domains and the endogenous APRT locus might be caused by differences in nucleosomal structure or nucleosome density in the APRT gene in these different genomic contexts. To investigate this possibility we examined the kinetics of micrococcal nuclease digestion at the integrated APRT gene domains in the G-37, G-47, and G-69 transfectant cell lines, compared with digestion at the endogenous APRTgene locus. As shown in Fig. 6 no differences were apparent. Essentially identical results were obtained for all four cell lines (only data from AT3-2, G-37, and G-69 are shown). These results suggest that genomic context-dependent regulation of repair does not involve first order nucleosome structure but might involve higher order chromatin structure.Our current understanding of chromatin structure and the effects of transcription on chromatin structure have not yet provided a clear picture of how these two factors regulate DNA repair. Our results together with other data accumulated to date suggest that the efficiency of repair of a region of genomic DNA is determined primarily by chromatin structure. Active genes typically have very different chromatin structures than inactive genes or noncoding regions and may be much more accessible to or have a greater affinity for DNA repair proteins. Transcription itself may increase the regional accessibility of a localized region or enhance its affinity for damage recognition/repair proteins, but transcription per se does not appear to be a prerequisite for remodeling; remodeling may precede transcription. If the inherent chromatin structure of a gene does not allow ready access by DNA repair proteins it is possible that chromatin remodeling preceding transcription or transcription-mediated chromatin changes may greatly enhance the accessibility of the gene to repair or at least promote TCR in its T strand. We believe that CPD repair in the integrated APRT gene in G-69 cells may reflect such processes. However, if the local chromatin structure surrounding a gene has already rendered the region maximally accessible to repair proteins, as may be the case for the endogenous CHO APRTgene locus, then further chromatin remodeling or active transcription would not be necessary to facilitate repair, and DNA damage on both strands might be repaired with equal efficiency.Our findings that UV-induced CPDs on both strands are poorly repaired in the actively transcribed integrated APRT gene domains in G-37 and G-47 cells are difficult to reconcile with the results obtained for the G-69 cell line. Whereas it is easy to envision how chromatin remodeling preceding transcription or chromatin changes produced by transcription might increase accessibility or enhance affinity for damage-recognition/repair proteins, it is harder to explain how a genomic environment that allows normal levels of transcription could be so refractory to repair. However, integration of actively transcribed APRT genes (which are somewhat protected by buffering 5′- and 3′-flanking sequences, including a 5′-unmethylated CpG island) into regions of heterochromatin in the G-37 and G-47 transfectants could result in progressive de novomethylation that might gradually spread from downstream sequences into the APRT gene. Hypermethylation of CpG sites in the coding sequence of the integrated APRT genes in the G-37 and G-47 cell lines might interfere with the interactions with histones or other nucleoproteins in ways that might impede or slow down the normal repair processes. The CpG sites in exons 1 and 2 of the APRTgene are normally completely unmethylated, but their methylation would be unlikely to affect transcription unless de novomethylation has spread all the way to the APRT promoter region. However, results in Fig. 4A and B show that all the CpG sites at exon 1 and exon 2 in AT3-2, G-37, and G69 cell lines are equally sensitive to hydrazine modification indicating that these sites are not methylated. Alternatively, it is possible that the APRT gene domains in the G-37 and G-47 transfectant cell lines could have been integrated into late replicating regions that may still allow transcription but are refractory to repair during most of the cell cycle. Enhanced or preferential repair of DNA damage on the T strand has been observed in a number of genes in mammalian cells including the dihydrofolate reductase, p53, hypoxanthine phosphoribosyltransferase, and adenine deaminase gene loci (Refs. 9.Mellon I.

We have identified three groups of genes whose expressions are distinctly regulated during this process. One cluster (Cluster A) revealed a VP-16-dependent but Myc-independent induction of a set of genes that is not linked to the apoptotic response. Two other gene clusters, however, were associated with VP-16-induced apoptosis. Cluster B, which includes p53-responsive genes, was associated with the temporal onset of apoptosis but accounted for only the basal apoptosis. However, Cluster C, which includes c-jun, was highly regulated by Myc and appeared to be critical to mounting the maximal apoptotic response in Myc -expressing cells. Furthermore, the Myc level dropped sharply following VP-16 exposure, which varied inversely with the induction of Cluster C genes, suggesting Myc normally represses their transcription. Thus, we have proposed that removal of Myc-mediated repression of apoptotic signals, combined with Myc-associated acceleration of the p53 responsive pathway, results in complete and rapid cell death following DNA damage.

Cleveland J.L. Sherr C.J. Roussel M.F. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 2424-2433Crossref PubMed Scopus (1056) Google Scholar) and cyclin A (7.Adachi S. Obaya A.J. Han Z. Ramos-Desimone N. Wyche J.H. Sedivy J.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 4929-4937Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar) have been shown to be specific for mediating the apoptotic function of Myc, thus providing direct molecular links between Myc and the induction of apoptosis. Gene expression is required for transmitting DNA damage signals to apoptotic signaling machinery. Among the best characterized transcriptional programs activated by DNA damage is p53-dependent transactivation of its target genes such as p21, gadd45, and Bax, leading to cell growth arrest or apoptosis, depending on the cellular context. p53 has been implicated as a target of Myc regulation (9.Roy B. Beamon J. Balint E. Reisman D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 7805-7815Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar, 10.Reisman D. Elkind N.B. Roy B. Beamon J. Rotter V. Cell Growth & Differ. 1993; 4: 57-65PubMed Google Scholar), and execution of a full Myc-mediated apoptotic response requires p53 (6.Rupnow B.A. Alarcon R.M. Giaccia A.J. Knox S.J. Cell Death Differ. 1998; 5: 141-147Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar,11.Hermeking H. Eick D. Science. 1994; 265: 2091-2093Crossref PubMed Scopus (701) Google Scholar, 12.Wagner A.J. Kokontis J.M. Hay N. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 2817-2830Crossref PubMed Scopus (513) Google Scholar). The requirement of p53 for Myc-mediated apoptosis has been recently linked to p19ARF, which negatively regulates the inhibitory MDM2 pathway, thus preventing MDM2-induced p53 degradation (8.Zindy F. Eischen C.M. Randle D.H. Kamijo T. Cleveland J.L. Sherr C.J. Roussel M.F. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 2424-2433Crossref PubMed Scopus (1056) Google Scholar). However, the exact contribution of p53 to Myc-mediated apoptosis remains to be established. Other transcriptional programs independent of p53 response are also implicated in the DNA damage-induced apoptotic pathway (13.Siede W. Mutat. Res. 1995; 337: 73-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar, 14.Herrlich P. Sachsenmaier C. Radler-Pohl A. Gebel S. Blattner C. Rahmsdorf H.J. Adv. Enzyme Regul. 1994; 34: 381-395Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). The complexity of these results suggests that a genome-wide survey for Myc-mediated gene expression under apoptotic conditions might allow the unbiased identification of Myc target genes responsible for its pro-apoptotic function. In this study, we describe the identification of Myc-mediated transcriptional programs in DNA damage-induced apoptosis. We have used three isogenic Rat-1 fibroblast cell lines that either overexpress Myc (Rat1-myc) or lack Myc (myc-null), as well as their parental cells (Rat1), to systematically compare gene expression profiles with cDNA microarray. Our study identified certain gene clusters that are most linked to Myc-mediated apoptosis. Myc wild-type fibroblast cells TGR-1 (Rat1) and the Myc−/− derivative (myc-null) were from John Sedivy (Brown University, Providence, RI) and have been described (15.Mateyak M.K. Obaya A.J. Adachi S. Sedivy J.M. Cell Growth & Differ. 1997; 8: 1039-1048PubMed Google Scholar). The Rat1 cells overexpressing Myc (Rat1-myc) were obtained from C. V. Dang (The Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, MD) and have been described (16.Hoang A.T. Cohen K.J. Barrett J.F. Bergstrom D.A. Dang C.V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 6875-6879Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar, 17.Hoang A.T. Lutterbach B. Lewis B.C. Yano T. Chou T.Y. Barrett J.F. Raffeld M. Hann S.R. Dang C.V. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 4031-4042Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). VP-16 was purchased from Sigma and SB203580 fromCalbiochem. Construction of the microarray containing 6,500 rat cDNA clones selected from the Rat Gene Index of the Institute for Genomic Research was as described (18.Guo Q.M. Malek R.L. Kim S. Chiao C. He M. Ruffy M. Sanka K. Lee N.H. Dang C.V. Liu E.T. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 5922-5928PubMed Google Scholar). cDNA probes were synthesized from amplified RNA using a modified method of Eberwine et al. (19.Eberwine J. Yeh H. Miyashiro K. Cao Y. Nair S. Finnell R. Zettel M. Coleman P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 3010-3014Crossref PubMed Scopus (766) Google Scholar) and have been described. 2A. Jazaeri and E. T. Liu, submitted for publication. The cDNA probes were made from 3 μg of amplified RNA with SuperScript II RT (Invitrogen) to incorporate Cy3 or Cy5 dye (Amersham Biosciences). Labeled Cy3 and Cy5 cDNA probes were cleaned up using a Microcon column (Millipore, Bedford, MA) and were combined, along with 2 μl of Cot-1 DNA, 2 μl of poly(A), and added H2O, to a volume of 20 μl. After heating the samples at 95 °C for 5 min, cDNA probes were added to 20 μl of 2× hybridization buffer (50% formamide, 10× SSC, 0.2% SDS) and centrifuged at 13,000 rpm for 10 min. For hybridization, array slides were first prehybridized with 5× SSC, 0.1% SDS, and 1% bovine serum albumin for 1 h, rinsed with H2O for 2 min, and dehydrated in isopropyl alcohol for 2 min. 40 μl of cDNA probe were added to the slides and incubated overnight at 42 °C. The slides were then washed sequentially in 2× SSC, 0.1% SDS; 1× SSC, 0.1% SDS; 0.2× SSC; and 0.05× SSC before being scanned for image analysis using Genepix 3.0 software (Axon Instruments, Inc., Foster City, CA). To ensure the reliability of data, samples from each time point were also reciprocally labeled in all hybridization experiments. Microarray slides were scanned for image analysis using Genepix 3.0 software (Axon Instruments, Inc.). Total intensity normalization was used to correct bias caused by systematic differences in labeling and detection efficiencies for the fluorescence labels. A normalization factor was calculated to rescale each gene in the array so that the median fluorescence ratio of all spots was 1.0. The data were then filtered so that only spots with intensities two times greater than background were used in the analysis. Changes of gene expression were presented as logarithmic ratios of fluorescence intensities. Data from reciprocal replicates were averaged after appropriate transformation. The log ratios of each time point were then normalized for each gene to that of untreated cells (time 0) to obtain the relative expression pattern. The genes that showed substantial differences after drug treatment were selected based on a 1.5-fold change of expression value for at least two time points across all experiment conditions. A total of 985 of ∼6,500 clones met the criteria and were further analyzed using clustering and display programs (rana.stanford.edu/software) developed by Eisen et al. (21.Eisen M.B. Spellman P.T. Brown P.O. Botstein D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 14863-14868Crossref PubMed Scopus (13157) Google Scholar). One microgram of total RNA from each sample was subjected to PCR with reverse transcription using the One Step RT-PCR kit (CLONTECH) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Selected RNA species were amplified using the following primers: c-Jun, sense, 5′-accattgagaagtagcccc-3′ and antisense, 5′-aggagtcgtcagaatccaag-3′; Fra-2, sense, 5′-actgtgtgtgacacaagcc-3′and antisense, 5′-gaaagccaacaagacaacaag-3′; IEX-1, sense, 5′-gctaactcagaacactaccacc-3′ and antisense, 5′-atcttattacaccccccccc-3′; and Gadd45, sense, 5′-gacgaacccacattcatcac-3′ and antisense, 5-′ttgaactcagccccttgac-3′. Amplification of the β-actin fragment was used as a PCR and gel-loading control. PCR was carried out for 20–30 cycles, with each cycle consisting of a denaturing step for 1 min at 94 °C, an annealing step for 2 min at 58 °C, and a polymerization step for 2 min at 72 °C. The PCR product was separated on a 1.0% agarose gel containing ethidium bromide and photographed under ultraviolet light. Cell lysates were lysed with cell lysis buffer (0.3% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm EDTA, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 2 mm EGTA, 1% Triton X-100, 150 mm NaCl, 25 mm NaF, 1 mmNa3VO4, 2 mm AEBSF, 5 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 μg/ml leupeptin) for 30 min on ice, and the lysates were clarified by centrifugation at 12,000 g for 15 min at 4 °C. Protein concentration was quantified (Bio-Rad), and protein samples (100 μg) were separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred onto immobilon membranes (Millipore, Bedford, MA). To study the effect of SB203580 on c -Jun expression, cells were treated with 50 μm SB203580 for 1 h prior to VP-16 treatment, and c-Jun proteins were identified using anti-Jun antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA). Reactive bands were visualized using the enhanced chemiluminescence detection system (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). We first assessed the effect of Myc on the cell death kinetics of Rat-1 cells in response to DNA damage. Rat-1 cells overexpressing Myc (Rat1-myc), lacking Myc (myc-null), and their parental TGR-1 cells (Rat1) were treated with 20 μm VP-16, a DNA-damaging agent that inhibits topoisomerase II (22.Strumberg D. Nitiss J.L. Dong J. Kohn K.W. Pommier Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 28246-28255Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar) and causes double strand DNA breaks. The apoptotic Rat-1 cells became detached (Ref. 7.Adachi S. Obaya A.J. Han Z. Ramos-Desimone N. Wyche J.H. Sedivy J.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 4929-4937Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar and Fig. 1A), and cell viability was determined by a trypan blue exclusion assay. As shown in Fig. 1, about 5 h after VP-16 treatment the Rat1-myc cells began to undergo apoptosis. In contrast, little apoptosis was observed in Rat1 and myc-null cells (Fig. 1A). To obtain detailed cell death kinetics for each cell line, cells were treated with VP-16 and monitored for up to 48 h. As shown in Fig. 1B, Rat1-myc cells underwent rapid apoptosis. Approximately 25% of the cells became apoptotic after 4 h of drug treatment, and the majority of cells became apoptotic after 12 h. By contrast, induction of apoptosis was delayed in Rat1 and markedly attenuated in myc-null cells. In Rat1 cells, 25% apoptosis was observed around 8 h after drug treatment, and most of the cells became apoptotic after 24 h, whereas the myc-null cells did not undergo detectable apoptotic response until 48 h after drug treatment. Moreover, a maximum of 25% apoptosis in myc-null cells was observed even 72 h after drug treatment (data not shown). We used this end point of a 25% apoptotic population as a target for our experiments. This observation indicated that Myc potentiated DNA damage-induced apoptosis: the apoptotic process was not just delayed but also impaired in the absence of Myc. Our observation is consistent with a recent study by Adachi et al (7.Adachi S. Obaya A.J. Han Z. Ramos-Desimone N. Wyche J.H. Sedivy J.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 4929-4937Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar) demonstrating that the reduced susceptibility of myc-null Rat-1 cells to VP-16-induced apoptosis was not because of the slow growth rate of these cells. Thus, induction of apoptosis by VP-16 in Rat-1 cells appeared to depend upon the level of Myc. The differential apoptotic responses observed in these cells also suggested that VP-16 may activate two apoptotic signaling pathways in Rat1 fibroblast cells. One is a Myc-dependent signaling pathway that induced a strong and rapid apoptosis in Myc-expressing cells. The other appeared to be Myc-independent and accounted for the weak residual apoptotic response (25%) as was observed in myc-null cells. To investigate the transcriptional programs that underlie the differential cellular response as reported in Fig. 1, we made use of cDNA microarray technology to study the expression of 6,500 genes. Cells treated with VP-16 were harvested at different time points until a similar level of an apoptotic end point (25% cell death) had been reached in all three cell lines (Fig. 1B). Using RNA taken at the zero time point of untreated cells as reference, gene expression for each time point after drug treatment was monitored. Scatter plots in Fig. 2A show the effect of Myc on gene expression in response to VP-16 in the three cell lines. Four hours after drug treatment, greater alterations in gene expression were observed in myc-overexpressing Rat-1 cells than Rat1 and myc-null cells. To ensure the reliability of data, samples from each time point were also reciprocally labeled in all hybridization experiments. The resulting two sets of duplicate data were plotted to assess assay reproducibility. As shown in Fig. 2B, a representative plot showed a correlation coefficient factor of 0.72 for total genes and 0.82 for genes with a change greater than 1.5-fold, respectively, indicating a good reproducibility between two duplicate assays. To compile a global view of gene expression response of the three cell lines following exposure to VP-16 treatment, genes that showed a greater than 1.5-fold difference after drug treatment for at least two time points in each cell line were selected. Based on these criteria, we found a total of 901 genes differentially expressed in VP-16-treated Rat1-myc cells, whereas 562 and 537 genes were differentially expressed in Rat1 and myc-null cells, respectively (Fig. 2C). Noticeably, the number of genes induced by VP-16 diminished with decreasing levels of Myc. Compared with the 356 genes induced by VP-16 in Rat1-myc cells, there were 304 and 199 genes induced in wild-type Rat1 and myc-null cells, respectively (Fig. 2C). This observation indicates that Myc expression augments the transcriptional response to DNA damage caused by VP-16 treatment. To visualize the time-dependent expression patterns that could potentially reveal the principles underlying the Myc-mediated cellular phenotype, we performed hierarchical clustering of the outlier genes as defined above. To further reduce random fluctuations of gene expression, we applied an additional selection for outlier genes, selecting those that vary in the same direction in two of the three Myc conditions. This criterion demands consistent directionality in the temporal expression profiles as related to the expression dose of Myc. Our analysis revealed three clusters of up-regulated genes that responded to VP-16 in a Myc-associated manner based on the magnitude of induction and the timing of the peak effect. The first cluster (Fig. 3A, Cluster A) represents a group of genes that is dramatically induced by VP-16 in magnitude and in time but appears to be independent of cellular Myc status. This group includes members of the Ras/MAPK pathway and suggests that these genes may be proximately induced by the DNA damaging agent. The second group contains genes (Fig. 3A, Cluster B) associated with the timing of apoptosis but whose magnitude of induction by VP-16 was unrelated to Myc levels. Gene expression in this cluster showed a rapid increase within 4 h after VP-16 treatment in Rat1-Myc cells. In contrast, a similar level of gene induction was not observed until 8 h after drug treatment in Rat1 cells and 48 h in myc-null cells, respectively (Fig. 3B). Of interest, this cluster contains genes involved in cellular stress and growth arrest, and many of them have been previously recognized as p53 target genes. For example,gadd45, gadd153, cyclin G1,PCNA, BTG2, fas, and MCl-1have been well known p53 target genes that are involved in DNA damage-induced growth arrest or apoptosis. RT-PCR analysis of Gadd45 confirmed the expression pattern observed in the array data (Fig. 3C). This observation suggested that p53 responsive genes are associated with the physical onset of VP-16-induced apoptosis and that their trigger for temporal expression is linked to Myc status. An alternative explanation is that these genes are associated with the residual 25% apoptosis that can be induced in the absence of Myc but that this portion of the apoptotic response is an important initiator for a wider Myc-associated death response. This cluster also contains other genes involved in stress response (hyaluronan synthase, histone H3, Hsp70, and translation initiation factors) and growth arrest (nerve growth factor inducible protein) that have not previously been associated with p53 and may represent markers of the apoptotic process. Other well studied p53 target genes involved in mediating cell cycle arrest (p21) and apoptosis (Bax) were not present in our microarray and therefore could not be assessed. The most striking cluster, (Fig. 4A, Cluster C) represents genes whose optimum induction after DNA damage is highly dependent on the Myc status of the cells. Gene expression in this cluster was strongly induced by VP-16 in Rat1-myc cells, leading to a mean 5-fold induction in magnitude within 4 h after drug treatment. In contrast, induction of these genes was significantly reduced in Rat1 cells, and little response was observed in myc-null cells even up to 48 h (Fig. 4, Aand B), coinciding with the impaired ability to undergo apoptosis in these cells. Genes in this cluster include c-jun, fra-2, IEX-1, raf-1, and ID-1 that have been previously reported to be involved in the regulation of apoptosis (23.Chen J. Fujii K. Zhang L. Roberts T. Fu H.

Chem. 2001; 276: 39213-39219Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Among them, induction of c-Jun, Fra-2, NRP/B, and ID-1 by VP-16 appeared to be completely dependent on the Myc status because there was no transcriptional activation in myc-null cells. These observations were confirmed by RT-PCR analysis (Fig. 4C). Taken together, this suggests that Cluster C genes are the primary Myc-regulated genes associated with the optimal induction of apoptosis after VP-16 exposure. Of note is that this response is not required for the 25% basal level of apoptosis at 48 h seen in myc-null cells. Therefore, expression of these genes during apoptosis may account for the full Myc-dependent apoptosis in Myc-expressing cells. Genes identified in Cluster C such as c-jun and IEX-1have been implicated in both pro-survival and pro-apoptotic events (24.Arlt A. Grobe O. Sieke A. Kruse M.L. Folsch U.R. Schmidt W.E. Schafer H. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 69-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar, 25.Wu M.X. Ao Z. Prasad K.V. Wu R. Schlossman S.F. Science. 1998; 281: 998-1001Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 27.Shaulian E. Karin M. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 2390-2400Crossref PubMed Scopus (1370) Google Scholar). To determine the exact effects of these genes in Myc-mediated apoptosis, we examined whether changes in c-Jun expression correlate to Myc-mediated apoptosis. We took advantage of previous reports that activation of p38 kinase results in c-Jun and c-Fos induction (30.Hazzalin C.A. Cano E. Cuenda A. Barratt M.J. Cohen P. Mahadevan L.C. Curr. Biol. 1996; 6: 1028-1031Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar, 31.Hazzalin C.A. Cuenda A. Cano E. Cohen P. Mahadevan L.C. Oncogene. 1997; 15: 2321-2331Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar) and that p38 kinase is implicated in Myc-mediated apoptosis putatively through Jun and Fos induction (32.Deschesnes R.G. Huot J. Valerie K. Landry J. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2001; 12: 1569-1582Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar, 33.Noguchi K. Yamana H. Kitanaka C. Mochizuki T. Kokubu A. Kuchino Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 267: 221-227Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). This was accomplished by testing the effect of SB203580, a p38 kinase inhibitor, on VP-16-induced c-Jun expression and its correlation to apoptosis. The level of c-Jun protein increased following VP-16 treatment of Rat1-myc cells in a time-dependent manner (Fig. 5A), paralleling the increase in c-Jun mRNA from RT-PCR and array analysis. Pretreatment of Rat1-myc cells with SB203580 blocked the induction of c-Jun by VP-16 (Fig. 5A) and decreased VP-16-induced apoptosis in Myc-expressing cells (Fig. 5B). However, in myc-null cells where no detectable induction of c-Jun was seen after DNA damage (Fig. 4, A and C and data not shown), no inhibition of apoptosis was observed (Fig. 5B). These data suggest that c-Jun expression contributes to Myc-dependent apoptosis. Interestingly, we found that Myc protein expression dropped dramatically after VP-16 treatment (Fig. 5C), which was followed by an immediate induction in c-Jun expression. This finding suggests that genes shown in Cluster C may potentially be the targets of transcriptional repression by Myc. A drop in Myc during DNA damage-induced apoptosis removed the Myc-mediated gene repression, allowing activation of transcription of these genes. As noted before, we selected only those outlier genes that varied consistently with the dose of Myc expression and found consistent up-regulated genes with such an association. Our microarray data analysis, however, did not reveal genetic elements that were consistently down-regulated by VP-16 yet displayed a Myc- or apoptosis-dependent manner. For example, though a set of 89 genes was found to be down-regulated by VP-16 in Rat-myc cells (data not shown), repression of this gene set was not observed to be Myc dose-dependent in Rat-1 and myc-null cells and thus was considered to be irrelevant to Myc-dependent apoptosis. Therefore, though down-regulated genes may have a function in VP-16-induced apoptosis, neither the pathways nor the functions are consistent across different dosages of steady-state Myc expression. In our previous study (18.Guo Q.M. Malek R.L. Kim S. Chiao C. He M. Ruffy M. Sanka K. Lee N.H. Dang C.V. Liu E.T. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 5922-5928PubMed Google Scholar) as well as a study by others (34.Coller H.A. Grandori C. Tamayo P. Colbert T. Lander E.S. Eisenman R.N. Golub T.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 3260-3265Crossref PubMed Scopus (707) Google Scholar), microarray technology was used to identify Myc responsive genes associated with growth and proliferation. These observations showed that Myc induces gene cassettes associated with protein synthesis. One of the most intriguing aspects of Myc is its ability to potentiate the apoptotic effects of a wide range of cellular insults. In this research, we extended those studies to systematically examine the genes altered during apoptotic response to a DNA-damaging agent, VP-16, that may be differentially regulated by Myc. The substantial difference in apoptotic response in Rat1 fibroblast cell lines differing only in Myc status provided an ideal system to interrogate expression of genes associated with death pathways supported by Myc. Furthermore, our study design allows for subtraction of transcriptional “noise” due to clonal selection and clonal drift. In filtering outlier genes, we demanded that these outliers be associated with either a common phenotype (apoptosis) or with the gene dosage of Myc. Our array data analysis suggests that there are discernable Myc-dependent and Myc-independent apoptotic pathways that are transcriptionally regulated. Cluster A (Fig. 3A) represents general responsive genes induced by VP-16 regardless of cellular status of Myc and may represent genes whose promoters are sensitive to DNA damage or cellular stress. Included in this cluster are Ha-Ras and mitogen-activated kinase kinase (MKK) that often mediate the earlier signaling events in response to a stress stimulus. Thus, though the downstream function of their gene products cannot be discerned by our experiments, this gene list may represent those that act as indicators of cellular stress. Analysis of our data shows that members of the p53 pathway (Cluster B) are induced in the apoptotic process. It has been reported that Rat1 fibroblast cells null for myc displayed an impaired p53 response to VP-16 compared with its parental cells (7.Adachi S. Obaya A.J. Han Z. Ramos-Desimone N. Wyche J.H. Sedivy J.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 4929-4937Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar), possibly due to defective expression of the Myc target gene,ARF (8.Zindy F. Eischen C.M. Randle D.H. Kamijo T. Cleveland J.L. Sherr C.J. Roussel M.F. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 2424-2433Crossref PubMed Scopus (1056) Google Scholar). Though it has been proposed that p53 is required for Myc-induced apoptosis (4.Evan G. Littlewood T. Science. 1998; 281: 1317-1322Crossref PubMed Scopus (1361) Google Scholar, 12.Wagner A.J. Kokontis J.M. Hay N. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 2817-2830Crossref PubMed Scopus (513) Google Scholar), our results suggest a more complicated picture. Our time course analysis of gene expression suggests that though the induction of p53 responsive genes is delayed in the absence of steady-state Myc expression, the p53 pathway alone may not be fully responsible for the Myc-mediated death response. This is because only a maximum of 25% apoptosis could be reached in myc-null cells even though a comparable level of p53 response was obtained at 48 h. In support of this, overexpression of p53 in myc-null Rat-1 cells did not fully restore DNA damage-induced apoptosis (7.Adachi S. Obaya A.J. Han Z. Ramos-Desimone N. Wyche J.H. Sedivy J.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 4929-4937Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Moreover, p53 null mouse embryo fibroblasts are not totally resistant to Myc-induced apoptosis (8.Zindy F. Eischen C.M. Randle D.H. Kamijo T. Cleveland J.L. Sherr C.J. Roussel M.F. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 2424-2433Crossref PubMed Scopus (1056) Google Scholar). Thus, the p53-mediated response may be mainly responsible for the initiation of cellular apoptosis or a necessary step for sensitizing the apoptotic process. Our results suggest a further model: the p53 pathway triggers a basal level of apoptosis after VP-16 in the absence of Myc (i.e. the residual 25% apoptosis at 48 h in myc-null cells) but requires Myc to engage additional death effector pathways necessary for a maximal apoptotic response. The most striking finding of our data analysis is the identification of a class of genes that responded to VP-16 that are highly dependent on the cellular Myc status. These genes were induced mainly in Myc-expressing cells undergoing optimal apoptotic response to VP-16. Thus, we have proposed that Cluster C genes may represent those Myc-regulated t-elements that can collaborate with p53 responsive triggers to engage a strong cellular apoptosis. We found that the Myc protein level dropped sharply in response to VP-16 treatment. This effect could be due to the transcriptional down-regulation of Myc as reported by others (36.Meng L. Ding J. FEBS Lett. 2001; 501: 59-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar, 37.Yang W. Shen J. Wu M. Arsura M. FitzGerald M. Suldan Z. Kim D.W. Hofmann C.S. Pianetti S. Romieu-Mourez R. Freedman L.P.

Oncogene. 1999; 18: 3666-3672Crossref PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar). The immediate increase of gene transcription seen in Cluster C following the drop in Myc protein indicates that Myc normally represses the transcription of these genes. Increasing evidence suggests that transcriptional repression is necessary for Myc-induced transformation and proliferation (39.Claassen G.F. Hann S.R. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 2925-2933Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Myc has been found to repress the transcription of a growing number of genes involved in cell cycle control or growth arrest, such as p21 (40,41), p27 (37,39,41),p15 (42.Warner B.J. Blain S.W. Seoane J. Massague J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 5913-5922Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), gadd45 (43.Marhin W.W. Chen S. Facchini L.M. Fornace Jr., A.J. Penn L.Z.

A. 1997; 94: 12886-12891Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar) in order to promote cell proliferation. More recently, Myc-mediated transrepression and not transactivation has been shown to be directly responsible for Myc-induced apoptosis, because deletion of the MB II domain of Myc that mediates a transrepression function drastically impaired the ability of Myc to drive apoptosis (20.Conzen S.D. Gottlob K. Kandel E.S. Khanduri P. Wagner A.J. O'Leary M. Hay N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 6008-6018Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). In further support of this, our data analysis revealed no cluster of VP-16 down-regulated genes correlating with Myc-dependent apoptosis. Thus, this study is in agreement with the previous report by Conzen et al. (20.Conzen S.D. Gottlob K. Kandel E.S. Khanduri P. Wagner A.J. O'Leary M. Hay N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 6008-6018Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar) and further suggests that selective transcription of death-associated genes due to the removal of Myc-mediated transrepression may be critical for Myc-induced apoptosis. The results presented in this study, together with those by others, suggest a working model for Myc in DNA damage-induced apoptosis (Fig. 6). This model reflects a balance between the ability of Myc to drive transformation and apoptosis. In the normal situation, Myc selectively represses the transcription of apoptotic signals in favor of cell proliferation. In the presence of DNA damage or other apoptotic stimuli, a drop in Myc expression will elevate those otherwise repressed pro-apoptotic genes contributing to Myc-dependent cell death. Induction of p53 responsive transcripts accounts for the baseline of Myc-independent apoptosis, but the onset for this pathway appears to be accelerated in the presence of Myc, which synergizes the Myc-specific pathway and results in an optimal apoptotic response.

We describe here a third ferritin-related subunit cloned from human placenta cDNA library and named PLIF (placental immunomodulatory ferritin). The PLIF coding region is composed of ferritin heavy chain (FTH) sequence lacking the 65 C-terminal amino acids, which are substituted with a novel 48 amino acid domain (C48). In contrast to FTH, PLIF mRNA does not include the iron response element in the 5′-untranslated region, suggesting that PLIF synthesis is not regulated by iron. The linkage between the FTH and C48 domains created a restriction site for EcoRI. PLIF protein was found to localize in syncytiotrophoblasts of placentas (8 weeks of gestation) at the fetal-maternal interface. Increased levels of PLIF transcript and protein were also detected in the breast carcinoma cell lines T47D and MCF-7 but not in the benign corresponding cell line HBL-100. In vitro, PLIF was shown to down-modulate mixed lymphocyte reactions and to inhibit the proliferation of peripheral blood mononuclear cells stimulated with OKT3.

Nevertheless, many studies in cancer patients have demonstrated elevated serum levels of acidic isoferritin (H ferritin) in some malignancies like Hodgkin's disease and breast cancer (2.Hazard J.T. Drysdale J.W. Nature. 1977; 265: 755-756Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar, 3.Marcus D.M. Zimberg N. Arch. Biochem.

Others have demonstrated the ability of this isoferritin to suppress immune response functions like T cell proliferation and down-regulation of important surface molecules required for normal immune reactions (4.Moroz C.

In our previous work, following the development and use of a unique anti placental ferritin monoclonal antibody (mAb CM-H9), we had purified and identified an unusual form of isoferritin named p43 placental isoferritin (PLF) (9.Moroz C. Kupfer B. Twig S. Parhami-Seren B. Clin. Chim. Acta. 1985; 148: 111-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). PLF exhibited immunosuppressive activity associated with T helper type II cytokine secretion (6.Sirota L. Kupfer B. Moroz C. Clin. Exp. Immunol. 1989; 77: 257-262PubMed Google Scholar, 8.Rosen H.R. Ausch C. Reinerova M. Zaspin E. Renner K. Rosen A.C. Schiessel R. Moroz C. Cancer Lett. 1998; 127: 129-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Furthermore, It was found to be present at high levels in serum and placenta tissue during normal pregnancy and at low or below detection level in pregnancy failure (10.Maymon R. Moroz C. Br. J. Obstet. Gynecol. 1996; 103: 301-305Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 11.Maymon R. Jauniaux E. Greenwald N. Moroz C. Am. J. Obstet.

Placenta. 2000; 21: 408-411Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). PLF was also elevated in patients with breast cancer and leukemia-lymphoma (13.Moroz C. Bessler H. de Sousa M. Brock J. Iron, the Lymphomyeloid System, Inflammation, and Malignancy. John Wiley and Sons, United Kingdom1989: 283-291Google Scholar, 14.Moroz C. Bessler H. Lurie Y. Shaklai M. Exp. Hematol. 1987; 15: 258-262PubMed Google Scholar), but not in small cell lung carcinoma patients, although high levels of H ferritin were measured (15.Strumowicz M. Szczepek B. Zych J. Radizikowska E. Sakowicz A. Rowinska-Zakrzeska E. Moroz C. J. Tumor Marker Oncol. 1996; 11: 1-5Google Scholar). We believed that P43 in PLF is a novel H ferritin homologue rather than the “normal” heavy chain and thus searched for it. In this work, we report the cloning and characterization of a cDNA coding for a novel ferritin subunit composed, in part, of ferritin heavy chain sequence and a C-terminal domain with a unique amino acid sequence.DISCUSSIONIn this report, we introduce a new human ferritin subunit cloned from placenta and designated PLIF. One of the fascinating features of PLIF is its unique molecular structure: a fusion of apparently two unrelated components to compose a bioactive molecule. This could be a result of an early recombination event between one of the several ferritin heavy chain genes (17.Constanzo F. Colombo M. Stuempfili S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1986; 14: 721-733Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar) with another, yet unknown, gene(s).The difficulty in isolating PLIF cDNA may refer to several reasons. First, the fusion of the ferritin-like domain and the C48 domain created a restriction site for EcoRI, a site that does not exist in the DNA sequence of ferritin heavy chain. The EcoRI site is commonly used as a linker in constructing cDNA libraries. Thus, such a site will become deceptive when unexpectedly detected in the middle of known genes such as in ferritin heavy chain. Second, PLIF transcripts exist at very low copy number, compared with ferritin heavy chain, in placental tissues at term delivery (40 weeks) as we observed in the placenta cDNA library screen and the Northern blot analysis. It is noteworthy that in the current study PLIF expression was exhibited by immunohistochemical staining in syncytiotrophoblast cells of human placenta (8 weeks of gestation). This is compatible with the previous report on the expression of PLF (11.Maymon R. Jauniaux E. Greenwald N. Moroz C. Am. J. Obstet. Gynecol. 2000; 182: 670-674Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar).However, it was also shown that PLF is down-regulated in those cells at 17 weeks of gestation up to term (11.Maymon R. Jauniaux E. Greenwald N. Moroz C. Am. J. Obstet. Gynecol. 2000; 182: 670-674Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). This may explain the current observation of the proportionally low PLIF mRNA transcripts exhibited in the tissue mRNA blot, as it was obtained from term placenta. Third, the size of PLIF mRNA and its translated peptide are overlapping with H ferritin and therefore cannot be differentiated by electrophoresis (16.Costanzo F. Santoro C. Colantuoni V. Bensi G. Raugei G. Romano V. Cortese R. EMBO J. 1984; 3: 23-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 18.Boyd D. Vecoli Ch. Belcher D.M. Swatantra K.J. Drysdale W. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 11755-11761Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).The data presented in this work shed light on the structural and functional properties of this novel ferritin subunit. Structurally, PLIF lacks the IRE, suggesting that its synthesis, in contrast to H and L ferritin subunits, is not regulated by iron. For the H, but not L, subunit, it was reported that cell differentiation and other factors might regulate its transcription (19.Munro H. Nutr. Rev. 1993; 51: 65-73Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Likewise, PLIF acting as an immunomodulatory factor may be regulated by differentiation processes in the appropriate cells. There is a need to carefully analyze the 5′-UTR of PLIF and identify possible regulatory elements other than IRE.The immunosuppressive characteristic of PLIF is demonstrated in two immune activation models in vitro, MLC and anti-CD3 stimulation. Furthermore, PLIF was localized in the placenta at fetal-maternal interface and in the immune Hofbauer cells.Taken together, the localization and activity of PLIF suggest its possible involvement in the modulation of the maternal immune recognition of embryo toward anergy.The increased level of PLIF transcripts and its protein expression observed in T47D and MCF-7 breast carcinoma cell lines, but not in the breast epithelial cell line HBL-100, suggest that PLIF may function as an immunosuppressive protein enabling immune escape of the developing breast cancer cells, as has been suggested previously for PLF (8.Rosen H.R. Ausch C. Reinerova M. Zaspin E. Renner K. Rosen A.C. Schiessel R. Moroz C. Cancer Lett. 1998; 127: 129-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar).It was shown that the immunomodulatory activity of PLIF is related to the C48 domain irrespective to ferritin domain. C48 is proline-rich, which may indicate that it functions through binding to Src homology 3 domains of signaling molecules in target cells (20.Holdorf A.D. Green J.M. Levin S.D. Denny M.F. Straus D.B. Link V. Changelian P.S. Allen P.M. Shaw A.S. J. Exp. Med. 1999; 190: 375-384Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). It even contains the consensus Src homology 3 binding motif, P XXP (21.Feng S. Chen J.K. Yu H. Simon J.A. Schreiber S.L. Science. 1994; 266: 1241-1247Crossref PubMed Scopus (739) Google Scholar) (P, proline and X, any amino acid) at position 121–124 of the PLIF polypeptide (Fig. 1). C48 contains also an Arg-Arg (RR) cellular kinase-binding motif that is important for binding to serine/threonine kinases (22.Swingler S. Gallay P. Camaur D. Song J. Abo A. Trono D. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 4372-4377Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).There is a similarity between PLF and PLIF in their immunological cross-reactivity with CM-H9 mAb, placenta expression, and immunosuppressive function. Moreover, the p43 subunit of PLF may represent a dimer of PLIF (22 kDa). With such characteristics, PLIF could become a therapeutic modality in high risk pregnancies associated with low levels or deficiency of PLF (10.Maymon R. Moroz C. Br. J. Obstet. Gynecol. 1996; 103: 301-305Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 11.Maymon R. Jauniaux E. Greenwald N. Moroz C. Am. J. Obstet.

Placenta. 2000; 21: 408-411Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). Furthermore, PLIF and its active domain C48 may be developed into an immunosuppressive therapeutic factor for treatment of various immune-related disorders. Ferritin is a mulitmeric protein composed of 24 heavy (H)1 and light (L) subunits that play a critical role in iron storage and regulation of intracellular iron homeostasis. Synthesis of both subunits is regulated through an iron response element (IRE) at the 5′-untranslated region (5′-UTR) of mRNA (1.Rouault T.A. Tang C.K. Kaptain S. Burgess W.H. Haile D.J. Samaniego F.

C48 contains also an Arg-Arg (RR) cellular kinase-binding motif that is important for binding to serine/threonine kinases (22.Swingler S. Gallay P. Camaur D. Song J. Abo A. Trono D. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 4372-4377Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).There is a similarity between PLF and PLIF in their immunological cross-reactivity with CM-H9 mAb, placenta expression, and immunosuppressive function. Moreover, the p43 subunit of PLF may represent a dimer of PLIF (22 kDa). With such characteristics, PLIF could become a therapeutic modality in high risk pregnancies associated with low levels or deficiency of PLF (10.Maymon R. Moroz C. Br. J. Obstet. Gynecol. 1996; 103: 301-305Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 11.Maymon R. Jauniaux E. Greenwald N. Moroz C. Am. J. Obstet.

Placenta. 2000; 21: 408-411Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). Furthermore, PLIF and its active domain C48 may be developed into an immunosuppressive therapeutic factor for treatment of various immune-related disorders. In this report, we introduce a new human ferritin subunit cloned from placenta and designated PLIF. One of the fascinating features of PLIF is its unique molecular structure: a fusion of apparently two unrelated components to compose a bioactive molecule. This could be a result of an early recombination event between one of the several ferritin heavy chain genes (17.Constanzo F. Colombo M. Stuempfili S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1986; 14: 721-733Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar) with another, yet unknown, gene(s). The difficulty in isolating PLIF cDNA may refer to several reasons. First, the fusion of the ferritin-like domain and the C48 domain created a restriction site for EcoRI, a site that does not exist in the DNA sequence of ferritin heavy chain. The EcoRI site is commonly used as a linker in constructing cDNA libraries. Thus, such a site will become deceptive when unexpectedly detected in the middle of known genes such as in ferritin heavy chain. Second, PLIF transcripts exist at very low copy number, compared with ferritin heavy chain, in placental tissues at term delivery (40 weeks) as we observed in the placenta cDNA library screen and the Northern blot analysis. It is noteworthy that in the current study PLIF expression was exhibited by immunohistochemical staining in syncytiotrophoblast cells of human placenta (8 weeks of gestation). This is compatible with the previous report on the expression of PLF (11.Maymon R. Jauniaux E. Greenwald N. Moroz C. Am. J. Obstet. Gynecol. 2000; 182: 670-674Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). However, it was also shown that PLF is down-regulated in those cells at 17 weeks of gestation up to term (11.Maymon R. Jauniaux E. Greenwald N. Moroz C. Am. J. Obstet. Gynecol. 2000; 182: 670-674Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). This may explain the current observation of the proportionally low PLIF mRNA transcripts exhibited in the tissue mRNA blot, as it was obtained from term placenta. Third, the size of PLIF mRNA and its translated peptide are overlapping with H ferritin and therefore cannot be differentiated by electrophoresis (16.Costanzo F. Santoro C. Colantuoni V. Bensi G. Raugei G. Romano V. Cortese R. EMBO J. 1984; 3: 23-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 18.Boyd D. Vecoli Ch. Belcher D.M. Swatantra K.J. Drysdale W. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 11755-11761Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The data presented in this work shed light on the structural and functional properties of this novel ferritin subunit. Structurally, PLIF lacks the IRE, suggesting that its synthesis, in contrast to H and L ferritin subunits, is not regulated by iron. For the H, but not L, subunit, it was reported that cell differentiation and other factors might regulate its transcription (19.Munro H. Nutr. Rev. 1993; 51: 65-73Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Likewise, PLIF acting as an immunomodulatory factor may be regulated by differentiation processes in the appropriate cells. There is a need to carefully analyze the 5′-UTR of PLIF and identify possible regulatory elements other than IRE. The immunosuppressive characteristic of PLIF is demonstrated in two immune activation models in vitro, MLC and anti-CD3 stimulation. Furthermore, PLIF was localized in the placenta at fetal-maternal interface and in the immune Hofbauer cells. Taken together, the localization and activity of PLIF suggest its possible involvement in the modulation of the maternal immune recognition of embryo toward anergy. The increased level of PLIF transcripts and its protein expression observed in T47D and MCF-7 breast carcinoma cell lines, but not in the breast epithelial cell line HBL-100, suggest that PLIF may function as an immunosuppressive protein enabling immune escape of the developing breast cancer cells, as has been suggested previously for PLF (8.Rosen H.R. Ausch C. Reinerova M. Zaspin E. Renner K. Rosen A.C. Schiessel R. Moroz C. Cancer Lett. 1998; 127: 129-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). It was shown that the immunomodulatory activity of PLIF is related to the C48 domain irrespective to ferritin domain. C48 is proline-rich, which may indicate that it functions through binding to Src homology 3 domains of signaling molecules in target cells (20.Holdorf A.D. Green J.M. Levin S.D. Denny M.F. Straus D.B. Link V. Changelian P.S. Allen P.M. Shaw A.S. J. Exp. Med. 1999; 190: 375-384Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). It even contains the consensus Src homology 3 binding motif, P XXP (21.Feng S. Chen J.K. Yu H. Simon J.A. Schreiber S.L.

It has been suggested that both transcription-activating proteins, Yap1p and Skn7p, regulate the transcription of cTPx II upon exposure to oxidative stress. However, a dramatic loss of transcriptional response to various stresses in yeast mutant strains lacking both Msn2p and Msn4p suggests that the transcription factors act as a principal transcriptional activator. In addition to two Yap1p response elements (YREs), TTACTAA and TTAGTAA, the presence of two stress response elements (STREs) (CCCCT) in the upstream sequence of cTPx II also suggests that Msn2p/Msn4p could control stress-induced expression of cTPx II. Analysis of the transcriptional activity of site-directed mutagenesis of the putative STREs (STRE1 and STRE2) and YREs (TRE1 and YRE2) in terms of the activity of a lacZ reporter gene under control of the cTPx II promoter indicates that STRE2 acts as a principal binding element essential for transactivation of the cTPx II promoter. The transcriptional activity of the cTPx II promoter was exponentially increased after postdiauxic growth. The transcriptional activity of the cTPx II promoter is greatly increased by rapamycin. Deletion of Tor1, Tor2, Ras1, and Ras2 resulted in a considerable induction when compared with their parent strains, suggesting that the transcription of cTPx II is under negative control of the Ras/cAMP and target of rapamycin signaling pathways. Taken together, these results suggest that cTPx II is a target of Msn2p/Msn4p transcription factors under negative control of the Ras-protein kinase A and target of rapamycin signaling pathways. Furthermore, the accumulation of cTPx II upon exposure to oxidative stress and during the postdiauxic shift suggests an important antioxidant role in stationary phase yeast cells.

Aerobically growing cells are continuously challenged by reactive oxygen species. Reactive oxygen species are potent oxidants capable of damaging all cellular components including DNA, protein, and membrane lipid. To protect against the toxicity of reactive oxygen species, aerobic organisms are equipped with an array of defense mechanisms (1.Halliwell B. Gutterridge J.M.C.

The TPx family, also referred to as the TSA/alkyl hydroperoxide reductase family or peroxiredoxin family, is a large family of a new type of peroxidase. In mammalian tissue, at least six types of TPx isoenzymes have been identified. Recently, in addition to two types of TPx isoenzymes (TSA I, YML028W (2.Kim K. Kim I.H. Lee K.Y. Rhee S.G.

TSA I and TSA II (Ahp1) were described as a general hydroperoxide peroxidase to remove H2O2 and alkyl hydroperoxide (2.Kim K. Kim I.H. Lee K.Y. Rhee S.G. Stadtman E.R. J. Biol.

Three novel isoforms showed a distinct thiol peroxidase activity supported by thioredoxin and appeared to be distinctively localized in the cytoplasm, mitochondria, and nucleus. Each isoform was named after its subcellular localization such as cytoplasmic TPx I (cTPx I or TSA I), cTPx II (YDR453C), cTPx III (TSA II/alkyl hydroperoxide reductase 1), mitochondrial TPx (YBL064C), and nuclear TPx (YIL010W) (22.Park S.K.

Unlike other TPx-null mutants, the cTPx II-null mutant showed a slow growth phenotype (22.Park S.K. Cha M.K. Jeong W. Kim I.H. J. Biol.

In contrast to other cTPx-null mutants, the cTPx II-null mutant did not recover growth comparable with that of its parent type during the longer cultivation. Transcriptional activities of the TPx isoenzyme genes during the yeast growth cycle from log phase to stationary phase were quite different from each other. Expression of the cTPx II gene appeared to be elevated gradually as yeast cells grew and highly induced in response to various oxidative stresses (22.Park S.K. Cha M.K. Jeong W. Kim I.H. J. Biol.

The Saccharomyces cerevisiae transcription factor Yap1p plays an important role in oxidative stress response by activating target genes involved in cellular defense against oxidative damage. Yap1p activates transcription by binding to a specific DNA sequence located in the promoter of its targets (23.Toone W.M. Jones N. Curr. Opin. Genet.

In addition to two YREs, the promoter of the cTPx II gene contains two potential STREs, which suggests that Msn2p/Msn4p control expression of cTPx II. It has been suggested that both stress-related transcription-activating proteins, Yap1p and Skn7p, regulate the transcription of cTPx II in response to oxidative stress (28.Lee J. Godon C. Lagniel G.

In the present study, we have demonstrated for the first time that cTPx II is a transcriptional target of Msn2p/Msn4p. Furthermore, we have shown that transactivation of the cTPx II promoter by Msn2p/Msn4p is attributed to stress-responsive down-regulation of the Ras/cAMP and TOR signaling pathways. S. cerevisiae strains used in this study were grown in rich medium (YPD, 1% yeast extract, 2% Bactopepton, and 2% glucose; YPGE; 1% yeast extract, 2% Bactopepton, 3% glycerol, and 1% ethanol) or in synthetic minimal medium (SD) supplemented with the appropriate nutrients.

Coleman (University of Iowa). Wild-type strain JD7-7C (MATα, ura3–52, leu2, trpA, K+) used in the promoter study is from our laboratory stock. The msn2/4 double mutant strain YM24 (MATα, ade2, can1, leu2, ura3, msn2–3::HIS3, msn4–1::TRP1) and its wild-type strain, W303-1A, were kindly provided by Dr. Michael Jacquet (Universite Paris-Sud).

A cTPx II promoter-lacZ fusion plasmid was constructed using a PCR-amplified DNA fragment. A putative promoter sequence of cTPx II was identified by the analysis with the SGD program (Stanford University). The promoter sequence (position −601 to −1) was amplified using genomic DNA from a yeast strain (JD7-7C) and oligonucleotides TF (5″-CGGGGTACCTGTAGCCCTATATA GACATTACC) (forward primer) and TR (5″-CGCGGATTCGATTGGTTTTTT ACGTTCTTGTAA) (reverse primer). These primers introduce a KpnI (forward) and Bam HI (reverse) site (underlined) for in-frame directional cloning into plasmid digested with KpnI and BamHI. To make β-galactosidase-fused promoter sequences, the lacZ gene was amplified with primers 5′-CGCGGATCCATGACCATGATTACGGATTCACT (forward primer) and 5′-GGTGAAGCTTATATTATTTTTGACACCAGACC (reverse primer), digested with BamHI and HindIII, and cloned into YEGα-HIR525 digested with the same enzymes to produce pYLac. The PCR products of the cTPx II promoter were digested with KpnI and BamHI and cloned into p YLac digested with KpnI and BamHI to give p YcTPxIIP-LacZ fusion vector. DNA sequencing confirmed that no mutation had been introduced in the promoter during PCR amplification. Site-directed mutagenesis was carried out using an overlap extension PCR method. The TF and TR primers for amplification of the cTPx II promoter were used as external primers. Four internal primers (5″- CGGGGTACCTGTAGCCCTATATAGACAAAAGAAAGTATG, YRE1 forward; 5″-CCAGGTACATACTTTCTTTTGTCTA, YRE1 reverse; 5″- GTTTTTTTTGAAAGAAAGCGCTACGAC, YRE2 forward; and 5″-GTCGTAGCGCTTTCTTTCAAAAAAAAC, YRE2 reverse) were designed to introduce substitutions (TTACTAA, YRE1 site to AAAGAAA, TTAGTAA, and YRE2 site to AAAGAAA) in each of the two YREs present in the cTPx II promoter. Four internal primers (5″-CTATATGCGAACATCTAGTTTACAAG, STRE1 forward; 5″-CTTGTAAACTAGATGTTCGCATATAG, STRE1 reverse; 5′-GGGCTGATCCAACATTACAATTGG, STRE2 forward; and 5″-CCAATTGTAATGTTGGATCAGCCC, STRE2 reverse) were designed to introduce substitutions (CCCCT to AACAT) in each of the two STRES (STRE1 and STRE2) present in the promoter. Each of the PCR products was digested with KpnI and BamHI and cloned into p YLac digested with KpnI and BamHI to give p YcTPxIIP-Mutant-LacZ fusion vector. DNA sequencing confirmed that mutation had been introduced in the corresponding STRE and YRE sites in the TPx II promoter. All kinds of STRE and YRE mutants (double, triple, and quadruple mutants) were made using the appropriate p YcTPxIIP-Mutant-LacZ vector and the combination of internal and external primers. The location of the respective YREs and STREs with reference to the cTPx II start codon is shown in Fig. 1. Cells were harvested and disrupted by vortexing with glass beads, and β-galactosidase activity was assayed using O-nitrophenyl-β-d-galactoside essentially as described previously (42.Rose M. Botstein D. Methods Enzymol. 1983; 101: 167-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar). The β-galactosidase activity is expressed as unit (increase in A412 nm resulting from O-nitrophenyl-β-d-galactoside hydrolyzed by β-galatosidase/10 min/mg protein). Immunoblot analysis was performed using rabbit polyclonal antibodies against cTPx II. Transfer of proteins from 12% SDS-PAGE gels to nitrocellulose and processing of nitrocellulose blots were carried out according to a standard protocol. Northern blot analysis of c TPx IImRNA was carried out according to a standard protocol. Yeast total RNA (20 μg) was fractionated in a 1.5% formaldehyde-agarose gel and transferred to a nylon membrane, and the resultant blot was hybridized with 32P-labeled cTPx II structural gene. For RT-PCR analysis of cTPx II mRNA, 2 μg of yeast total RNA was reverse-transcribed with a forward primer of the cTPx II structural gene according to a standard protocol. Amplifications of cDNAs of cTPx II and control ACT1(actin 1) were performed for 15 cycles, and the PCR products were electrophoresed in 1.5% agarose gels and visualized with ethidium bromide. Protein concentration was determined using the Bradford protein assay kit (Bio-Rad). Yeast transformation, DNA, protein extraction from yeast, and other methods not mentioned were carried out according to the supplier's manual or a standard protocol described previously (43.Adams A. Gottschling D.E. Kaiser C.A. Stearms T. Methods in Yeast Genetics. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1997Google Scholar). Previously, we reported that exposure of yeast cells harboring the cTPx II-lacZ gene fusion vector to oxidative stress increases the β-galactosidase activities (22.Park S.K. Cha M.K. Jeong W. Kim I.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 5723-5732Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). To investigate the cTPx II transcriptional response to oxidative stress, exponentially growing cells were exposed to varying concentrations of H2O2 (0.1, 0.2, and 0.5 mm) and diamide (0.5, 1, and 1.5 mm) for 30 min, and the intracellular levels of the cTPx II protein and mRNA were analyzed. The immunoblot analysis for cTPx II in late log-phase cells grown in a rich media (YPD; cell density, A600 nm = 20) indicates that the protein level is very low (about 0.02% of total soluble protein) compared with that of cTPx I (Fig. 1A). There are very similar types of cytoplasmic TPxs in yeasts (i.e. cTPx I and cTPx II) (i.e. 86% identities, 96% positives) (22.Park S.K. Cha M.K. Jeong W. Kim I.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 5723-5732Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). Cytoplasmic TPx I (TSA1) is an abundant protein even under noninduced conditions (0.7% of total soluble protein), and its synthesis rate was constant throughout yeast life but increased upon exposure to oxidative stress (3.Kim I.H. Kim K. Rhee S.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 6018-6022Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar, 22.Park S.K. Cha M.K. Jeong W. Kim I.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 5723-5732Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). Cytoplasmic TPx II is also an inducible protein in response to oxidative stress, but in contrast to cTPx I, cTPx II was elevated as a function of yeast growth (Fig. 1B) (22.Park S.K. Cha M.K. Jeong W. Kim I.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 5723-5732Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). A gradual increase of band intensity as a function of cell growth was consistent with the previous observation of growth-dependent increase of transcriptional activity in terms of the β-galactosidase activity under control of the cTPx II promoter (22.Park S.K. Cha M.K. Jeong W. Kim I.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 5723-5732Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). Comparative Western blot (Fig. 1B) and RT-PCR (Fig. 1C) analyses showed that the protein and mRNA levels in early log-phase cells (cell density, A600 nm = 5) were very low but that the expression of cTPx II was dramatically induced in response to exposure of the yeasts to H2O2 and diamide. Taken together, these results demonstrate that expression of cTPx II is increased as a function of yeast growth and that cTPx II is an inducible protein in response to oxidative stress. Recently, it has been reported that both transcription factors Yap1p and Skn7p regulate cTPx I and cTPx II expression (28.Lee J. Godon C. Lagniel G. Spector D. Garin J. Labarre J. Toledano M.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 16040-16046Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (467) Google Scholar). However, the difference in expression pattern between cTPx II and cTPx I during yeast life suggests that another transcription factor could be involved in cTPx II expression. To test this possibility, the mRNA level of cTPx II was investigated in various mutant strains lacking oxidative stress-related transcription factors such as Yap1p, Skn7p, and Msn2p/Msn4p (Fig. 2). Comparative analyses of the cTPx II transcripts in yeast mutants lacking Yap1p, Skn7p, and Msn2p/Msn4p (i.e. yap1Δ, skn7Δ, and msn2/4Δ, respectively) were performed. To determine whether Msn2p/Msn4p are involved in the induction of cTPx II in response to H2O2 and diamide, reverse transcription was carried out, followed by amplification. The fold induction in msn2/4Δ in response to H2O2 and diamide was very low compared with that of its parent strain, W303-1a (Fig. 2A). To compare the inducibility of the transcription factors in response to H2O2, the levels of the transcripts in yap1Δ, skn7Δ, and msn2/4Δ were analyzed using RT-PCR (Fig. 2B) and Northern blots (Fig. 2D) after treatment of the exponentially growing cells (A600 nm = 5) with 0.5 mmH2O2. In wild-type cells, the cTPx II mRNA level was dramatically induced upon H2O2 treatment. Only in msn2/4Δ was a significant induction of the cTPx II mRNA level not observed. In skn7Δ, the induced level was significantly higher compared with that in msn2/4Δ, although the level is significantly lower when compared with that of the wild-type (W303-1a). In contrast, the induced level in yap1Δ was similar to that of its wild-type (SEY6210). Also, RT-PCR and Northern blots were performed using total RNA from the late log-phase wild-type and the null mutants (A600 nm = 20) (Fig. 2, C and D). The mRNA level in msn2/4Δ was very low even though when compared with those of yap1Δ and skn7Δ, confirming that Msn2p/Msn4p act as principal transcription factors to regulate cTPx II expression. Interestingly, the transcript of cTPx II in yap1Δ is rather increased compared with its wild-type. This contrary result could be explained in terms of the Msn2p/Msn4p-mediated induction by an oxidative stress caused by deletion of Yap1p. Taken together, these results suggest that Msn2p/Msn4p act as key transcription factors to regulate expression of cTPx II. Computer-assisted analysis of the cTPx II promoter identified two potential YREs located at positions −582 (YRE1; 5′-TTACTAA) and −472 (YRE2; 5″-TTAGTAA) relative to the ATG translation initiatio"

Kukolj and Skalka (Kukolj, G., and Skalka, A. M. (1995) Genes Dev. 9, 2556–2567) have previously shown that tethering of the termini enhances the endonucleolytic activities of integrase. We have used 5′-5′ phosphoramidites to design reverse-polarity tethers that allowed us to examine the reactivity of two viral long terminal repeat-derived sequences when concurrently bound to integrase and, additionally, developed presteady-state assays to analyze the initial exponential phase of the reaction, which is a measure of the amount of productive nucleoprotein complexes formed during preincubation of integrase and DNA. Furthermore, the reverse-polarity tether circumvents the integrase-catalyzed splicing reaction (Bao, K., Skalka, A. M., and Wong, I. (2002) J. Biol. Chem. 277, 12089–12098) that obscures accurate analysis of the reactivities of synapsed DNA substrates. Consequently, we were able to establish a lower limit of 0.2 s−1 for the rate constant of the processing reaction. The analysis showed the physiologically relevant U3/U5 pair of viral ends to be the preferred substrate for integrase with the U3/U3 combination favored over the U5/U5 pair. The integrase-catalyzed insertion of the retroviral genome into the host chromosome involves two reactions in vivo: 1) the binding and endonucleolytic removal of the terminal dinucleotides of the viral DNA termini and 2) the recombination of the ends with the host DNA.

Consequently, we were able to establish a lower limit of 0.2 s−1 for the rate constant of the processing reaction. The analysis showed the physiologically relevant U3/U5 pair of viral ends to be the preferred substrate for integrase with the U3/U3 combination favored over the U5/U5 pair. The insertion of a DNA copy of the viral RNA genome into the host chromosome is a critical step in the reproduction cycle of retroviruses (1.Katz R.A. Skalka A.M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1994; 63: 133-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (535) Google Scholar). Integrase catalyzes this reaction via a 2-step process, 1) the processing reaction, which is the recognition and endonucleolytic “trimming” of DNA sequences at the two 3′-ends of linear viral DNA and 2) the joining reaction, which is the concerted cleavage-ligation of the processed ends into the host chromosomal DNA. In avian sarcoma virus (ASV), 1The abbreviations used are: ASVavian sarcoma virusINintegraseLTRlong terminal repeatA260absorbance at 260 nmTBETris borate-EDTA the processing reaction produces site-specific cuts at the CATT sequence of the viral 3′-ends, removing the terminal TT dinucleotide to create new recessed 3′ OH ends. The two 3′ OH groups then serve as nucleophiles in the joining reaction to attack the phosphate bonds of the cellular target DNA in a single-step transesterification to produce a gapped covalent intermediate with 2-nucleotide overhangs. Overhang removal, gap fill-in, and ligation to complete the integration are likely mediated by host repair mechanisms (2.Daniel R. Katz R.A. Skalka A.M. Science. 1999; 284: 644-647Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar), although participation by viral proteins has been suggested (3.Chow S.A. Vincent K.A. Ellison V. Brown P.O.

The final product is a 4-base pair shortened viral genome inserted in the host DNA flanked by 6-base pair inverted repeats derived from the six base pairs separating the sites of concerted joining. The CA near the ends of the viral long terminal repeats (LTR) is conserved among retroviruses, whereas the length of the flanking host repeats is virus-specific and is thought to be a structural consequence of a particular integrase (6.Hishinuma F.

For clarity, the remainder of this report will refer to the dinucleotide TT-trimming activity as the “processing” reaction and the subsequent sequence-dependent insertion of processed ends into a double-stranded DNA target as the “joining” reaction.

In the course of retroviral replication, the RNA genome is reverse-transcribed into a duplex DNA copy, and as a result of the strand-transfer mechanism of reverse transcriptase, the U5 and U3 sequences become the termini of the DNA genome (11.Peliska J.A. Benkovic S.J. Science. 1992; 258: 1112-1118Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar). Purified integrase along with Mn2+ or Mg2+ as a cofactor is sufficient to catalyze both processing and joining reactions in in vitro assays using synthetic oligodeoxynucleotide substrates with DNA sequences derived from the U3 and/or U5 viral LTR ends (12.Kukolj G. Skalka A.M. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 2556-2567Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 13.Chow S.A. Methods. 1997; 12: 306-317Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar, 14.Vora A.C. Chiu R. McCord M.

Typical in vitro integrase processing assays use radiolabeled substrates, with the reaction(s) allowed to proceed for 30–90 min before quenching since integrase shows low reactivity in such assays (13.Chow S.A. Methods. 1997; 12: 306-317Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar, 15.Scottoline B.P. Chow S. Ellison V. Brown P.O.

Virol. 2001; 75: 3556-3567Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar) studied the integrase-catalyzed joining reaction using an assay time of 5 min after a period of preincubation, aimed at “more closely reflecting the effects of the initial assembly events.” In either case, the reaction products and unreacted substrates are separated by electrophoresis on agarose or denaturing polyacrylamide gels to resolve the dinucleotide-shortened processing products and the extended joining products from the original substrates. Subsequent quantitation of the two products is used to measure the extent of catalytic activity. Single-end substrate assays show poor processing efficiency, and they also fail to produce measurable amounts of concerted integration products (where, in the case of ASV, two viral ends are inserted six base pairs apart) as is observed with preintegration complexes purified from infected cells (18.Craigie R. Fujiwara T. Bushman F. Cell. 1990; 62: 829-837Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar, 19.Katz R.A. Merkel G. Kulkosky J. Leis J. Skalka A.M. Cell. 1990; 63: 87-95Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar). Consequently, products larger than the original substrate in these assays that use a substrate containing only one LTR-end-derived sequence are considered to be products of only half-reactions, as only one viral DNA end is joined to a target site (19.Katz R.A. Merkel G. Kulkosky J. Leis J. Skalka A.M. Cell. 1990; 63: 87-95Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar). Assays involving substrates designed to resemble the linear retroviral genome, with an LTR end-derived sequence at either terminus, have resulted in >95% of the joining products coming from the recombination of two separate substrate molecules integrating into a single target molecule (14.Vora A.C. Chiu R. McCord M. Goodarzi G. Stahl S.J. Mueser T.C. Hyde C.C. Grandgenett D.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 23938-23945Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 20.Aiyar A.

Despite the lack of similarity to the nucleoprotein complex assembled in vivo, the assays involving such trimolecular reactions have been used to suggest the preference of integrase for a U3/U3 combination of ends over that of a U5/U5 combination, with the specificity for the biologically significant U3/U5 arrangement intermediately between the two (14.Vora A.C. Chiu R. McCord M. Goodarzi G. Stahl S.J. Mueser T.C. Hyde C.C. Grandgenett D.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 23938-23945Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). More recently, Brin and Leis (22.Brin E. Leis J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277 (in press)Google Scholar), using a reconstituted HIV-1 integration system, demonstrated that concerted DNA integration requires the presence of both U3 and U5 ends in the donor DNA. DNase I footprint analysis of the assembled integrase-DNA complex required for integration has revealed that the region of protection at the U3 LTR end (∼20 base pairs) was at least twice that at the U5 LTR end (<10 base pairs), suggesting that the nucleoprotein complex is asymmetric when assembled in a fashion capable of full-site integration (17.Vora A. Grandgenett D.P. J. Virol. 2001; 75: 3556-3567Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). In an attempt to mimic the geometric organization of the viral LTR ends of the in vivo preintegration complex at a more molecular level, Kukolj and Skalka (12.Kukolj G. Skalka A.M. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 2556-2567Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar) designed a series of substrates that covalently linked two single-end substrates together in a head-to-head configuration using 1–3 nucleotides of single-stranded DNA (see Fig. 1A). It was hypothesized that these single-stranded tethers would provide sufficient flexibility to alleviate torsional or rotational strains arising from the structural alignment of the two viral ends bound within the integrase active site(s). By designing the substrates asymmetrically with respect to the length of the two ends and 5′ radiolabeling both ends, it was possible to quantitate processing products for both ends simultaneously in addition to what appeared to be extended joining products. Using in vitro integrase assays similar to those described above, these authors observed enhanced processing efficiencies with these synapsed-end substrates and concluded that the tether effectively brought together integrase subunits bound separately to the two cognate sites, thereby coordinating the formation of a requisite higher order oligomeric structure with enhanced activity. These observations were consistent with the suggestion by Murphy and Goff (23.Murphy J.E. Goff S.P. J. Virol. 1992; 66: 5092-5095Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) that integrase must recognize both DNA ends for efficient processing at either end to occur in vivo. Whereas the results with these synapsed substrates clearly illustrated the important relationship between assembly of an integrase multimer and the coordinated binding of both viral DNA ends, the assays were performed in the time regime where the enzyme-catalyzed reaction had undergone multiple turnovers. Although much effort has been expended to demonstrate that integrase functions as a true enzyme in its ability to catalyze multiple turnovers under steady-state conditions (24.Jones K.S. Coleman J. Merkel G.W. Laue T.M. Skalka A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 16037-16040Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), the physiological relevance of multiple turnover events is questionable considering that only a single round of catalysis is sufficient to achieve integration in vivo. To complete a first-turnover investigation of the processing reaction using synapsed-end substrates, 5′-5′ reverse-polarity substrates were designed (see Fig. 1B) that allow the simultaneous binding of two LTR ends at the active site. Additionally, these substrates were not susceptible to the integrase-catalyzed splicing reaction and consequently simplified the comparisons of the LTR ends. Analysis of presteady-state assays of these reverse-polarity substrates revealed that, although the U3 LTR sequence appears to be preferred by avian integrase when the termini are studied individually (25.Fitzgerald M.L.

Virol. 1993; 67: 2628-2636Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), the U3/U5 combination of retroviral ends is the preferred substrate for integrase microscopically within a single turnover. Results from the first-turnover exponential analyses also have important bearing on previous interpretations of multiple-turnover product distributions. An examination of the exponential phases and their usefulness to a further understanding of the mechanism of integrase activity and the binding of substrates is also discussed. Oligodeoxyribonucleotides were synthesized by the Center for Gene Research and Biotechnology Central Services Laboratory (Oregon State University). Reversed-polarity oligodeoxyribonucleotides were synthesized using 5′-β-cyanoethyl phosphoramidites (Glen Research, Sterling, VA).

The intensity of each product band, Ii(t), at each time, t, was first normalized with respect to the sum of intensities in the starting substrate band, I0(t), plus all product bands according to Equation 1 to determine the normalized product fraction Fi,norm(t). Fi,norm(t)=−Ii(t)I,(t)+∑i=1nIi(t)Equation 1 Fi,norm, was then corrected for background intensity present at t = 0 for the i th band and renormalized for background intensities of all product bands to obtain the final corrected product fraction, Fi,corr according to Equation 2.

These materials and protocols were identical to those described in detail in the first paper of this series (10.Bao K. Skalka A.M. Wong I. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 12089-12098Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). The normal-polarity substrate, used originally to develop the presteady-state assay for integrase (10.Bao K. Skalka A.M. Wong I. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 12089-12098Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar), positioned the cognate CATT of the U3 sequence internally (see Fig. 1A). As a result, this sequence became the site of a spurious site-specific splicing reaction (10.Bao K. Skalka A.M. Wong I. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 12089-12098Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). Because the site preference of the splicing reaction is identical to that of the processing reaction, i.e. the internal CATT, its presence interfered with accurate quantitation of enzymatic processing activity. A reverse-polarity substrate (Fig. 1B), incorporating a 5′-5′ reverse-polarity tether and containing the same sequence as that of the normal-polarity substrate (Table I), was therefore designed specifically to circumvent the splicing reaction while maintaining the advantages of tethering the viral LTR sequences (Fig. 1B). At high concentration of NaCl (400 mm), the activity of integrase with normal-polarity substrates was predominated by the splicing activity (Fig. 2A). To demonstrate that the reverse-polarity substrate is not susceptible to this splicing reaction, presteady-state assays comparing different DNA substrates with and without a tether were performed at high salt conditions favorable to the splicing reaction. Reactions were performed as described under “Experimental Procedures” with all substrates radiolabeled on *5t, a 21-mer that is endonucleolytically cleaved by integrase at the normal processing, minus 2 position and at a second, minus 3 position to yield radiolabeled 19- and 18-mer products. The splicing reaction would yield a 46-mer product with the normal-polarity substrate *5t/5b(2)3t/3b and an anticipated 23/24-mer with the reverse-polarity substrate *5t/5b(2)3b/3t. Fig. 2A shows that the major product, at 400 mmNaCl, with the normal-polarity substrate was the 46-mer splicing product, whereas the 19-mer processing and shorter products were present in minor but detectable amounts. In contrast, reactions performed under identical conditions with the reverse-polarity substrate, *5t/3b(2)5b/3t, yielded predominantly processing products (19- and 18-mers) (Fig. 2B). Integrase-mediated splicing activity of this reverse-polarity substrate would have resulted in +2 and +3 products of 23- and 24-nucleotide lengths, respectively; products of such sizes accumulated in minute amounts and only at the two longest reaction times examined (1200 and 1800 s). By comparison, the processing products appeared within 5–10 s and in much greater quantities. These data demonstrated that even under reaction conditions chosen specifically to favor splicing over processing, the 5′-5′ tethering preferentially mediates integrase-catalyzed processing. To rule out the possibility that the increased NaCl concentration itself was capable of having promoted the initial exponential phase of processing activity with the reverse-polarity substrate, a control experiment was performed with an unsynapsed, single-ended substrate *5t/5b. Fig. 2C shows clearly the lack of any detectable integrase activity with this substrate under these conditions. Even at the longest time point assayed, 1800 s, *5t/5b was minimally processed. These results showed that without the scaffolding provided by the tethering of the two ends, integrase was unable to utilize the cognate sequence for enzymatic activity at this higher NaCl concentration. Fig. 3A shows the results from a typical first-turnover experiment performed as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Assay results with synapsed 5t/5b(2)3b/*3t and unsynapsed *3t/3b substrates (see Table I) are shown to illustrate the effect of tethering two viral end sequences in a head-to-head manner via a 5′-5′ linkage. The radiolabeled 21-mer, *3t, with a sequence corresponding to the viral U3 LTR, used in both substrates, contained the 3′ terminal cognate sequence CATT-OH. In the processing reaction, this sequence was endonucleolytically cleaved by integrase at the minus 2 position to yield a 19-mer and a TT dinucleotide as the major products. Additionally, an 18-mer minor product was also observed that is consistent with the less specific processing activity at the minus 3 position observed when Mn2+ is used as the metal cofactor (19.Katz R.A. Merkel G. Kulkosky J. Leis J. Skalka A.M. Cell. 1990; 63: 87-95Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar, 30.Katzman M. Katz R.A. Skalka A.M. Leis J. J. Virol. 1989; 63: 5319-5327Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 31.Terry R. Soltis D.A. Katzman M. Cobrinik D. Leis J. Skalka A.M. J. Virol. 1988; 62: 2358-2365Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Both 19- and 18-mer products were summed and plotted to quantitate total integrase-catalyzed processing activity. Kinetic experiments revealed multi-phasic reactions at all integrase concentrations tested. The time-dependent appearance of the processing product was best described by a series of presteady-state exponential phases followed by a linear phase according to Equation 3. The number of exponential phases observed was dependent on both the substrate used and the duration of time course examined. For all time courses, we have chosen to report the model-independent, actual molar concentration of product observed without further interpretation for accuracy. Compared with an unsynapsed substrate (*3t/3b), the initial exponential product formation phase of the synapsed substrate (5t/5b(2)3b/*3t) reaction occurred with larger amplitude and a significantly faster rate. The difference in burst amplitudes and rate constants for the synapsed versus unsynapsed substrates directly reflected differences in the extent of productive complex formation between enzyme and DNA during the preincubation period (before the initiation of the reaction with Mn2+). Furthermore, the synapsed substrate contained two CATT-OH cognate sites at which processing could have occurred, one at the 3′-end of the 3t strand and one at the 3′-end of the 5t strand. Because only the 3t strand was radiolabeled, however, processing at the cognate site of the U5 sequence was silent in these assays. As a consequence, the amplitude measured for the synapsed substrate did not include the amount of productive complexes formed at the U5 cognate site, and the large difference in amplitudes observed in this experiment actually underestimated the true enhancement of productive nucleoprotein complex formation attributable to the tethering of the two viral LTR ends. At time points extended beyond the early exponential phases, both time courses paralleled each other for the synapsed and unsynapsed substrates, indicating similar rates of reaction in subsequent steps of the enzyme. Experiments performed using radiolabeled *5t showed similar but lower reactivity under the same conditions. To assess the effect of enzyme concentration on the differences in reactivities of the two substrates, titrations of enzyme concentration were performed for both substrates. Typical results are shown in Figs.3, B and C, for assays conducted at integrase concentrations varying from 0.5 to 5.0 μm and a substrate concentration of 0.5 μm. The data were fit to Equation 3, and the best fit amplitudes and rate constants of the initial phase were plotted as a function of integrase concentrations. In the case of *3t/3b (closed squares, solid lines), both the apparent rate constant, λ1, and amplitude, A1, increased linearly with increasing integrase concentration with slopes of 0.0287 (r = 0.99) and 0.0049 (r = 0.99), respectively. In contrast, although the amplitude of the initial exponential phase in the synapsed substrate reaction increased with increasing protein concentration (with the exception of the highest protein concentration where protein aggregation becomes a problem), the rate constant for the initial exponential phase remained 0.2 s−1, independent of integrase concentration for the range of concentrations tested. In contrast, the single-end substrate only approached this rate at the highest integrase concentration range. These data show that the lower limit of the rate constant for the processing reaction is 0.2 s−1. The reverse-polarity substrates allowed exclusive examination of the processing activity and, therefore, made possible the direct comparison of the reactivities of the U5 and U3 sequences. The reactivities of all four possible combinations of synapsed end sequences, U3/U3, U3/U5, U5/U5, and U5/U3, were separately measured using *3t/3b(2)3b/*3t, 5t/5b(2)3b/*3t, *5t/3b(2)5b/*5t, and *5t/5b(2)3b/3t, respectively. The results from presteady-state assays, as described under in “Experimental Procedures,” were obtained and compared over a range of both NaCl (130–500 mm) and integrase (0.5–20 μm) concentrations. Fig. 4A shows a typical direct comparison of the time-dependent appearance of processing products of the U3 end in the context of a synapsed U3/U3 pair (open circles, *3t/3b(2)3b/*3t) versus that of the same U3 sequence in a synapsed U3/U5 combination (closed circles, 5t/5b(2)3b/*3t). At 5 μmintegrase, 0.5 μm reverse-polarity substrate DNA, and 130 mm NaCl, the best fits of the time-dependent appearance of processing products were characterized by two initial exponential phases followed by a slower linear phase representing the beginning of a third exponential phase. However, because the substrate used to assay the U3/U3 combination, *3t/3b(2)5b/*3t, contained two radiolabeled 21-mers, whereas 5t/5b(2)3b/*3t was radiolabeled on only one DNA strand, it was necessary to divide the best fit of the U3/U3 data by two. Comparison of the adjusted curve (dotted curve) with the best fit of the data from the U3/U5 substrate (solid curve) revealed that the U3 end is processed to a greater extent when bound concurrently with a U5 end than when bound with another U3 sequence. Similarly, Fig. 4B shows the results from parallel presteady-state experiments comparing the reactivity of the U5 end in the context of either a U5/U5 pair (open squares, *5t/3b(2)5b/*5t) or a U5/U3 combination of ends (closed squares, *5t/3b(2)5b/3t).

After reverse transcription, integrase binds specifically to the ends of the duplex retroviral DNA, endonucleolytically cleaves two nucleotides from each 3′-end (the processing activity), and inserts these ends into the host DNA (the joining activity) in a concerted manner. In first-turnover experiments with synapsed DNA substrates, we observed a novel splicing activity that resembles an integrase joining reaction but uses unprocessed ends. This splicing reaction showed an initial exponential phase (ksplicing = 0.02 s−1) of product formation and generated products macroscopically indistinguishable from those created by the processing and joining activities, thus bringing into question methods previously used to quantitate these reactions in a time regime where multiple turnovers of the enzyme have occurred. With a presteady-state assay, however, we were able to distinguish between different pathways that led to formation of identical products. Furthermore, the splicing reaction allowed characterization of substrate binding and specificity. Although integrase requires only a 3′ hydroxyl with respect to nucleophiles derived from DNA, it specifically favors the cognate sequence CATT as the electrophile. These experimental results support a two-site “switching” model for binding and catalysis of all three integrase activities.

After infection, retroviruses create a linear DNA copy of their RNA genome that, through the strand-transfer mechanism of reverse transcriptase, places the U3 region of the LTR sequence at one terminus and the U5 region of the LTR sequence at the other terminus (1.Peliska J.A. Benkovic S.J. Science. 1992; 258: 1112-1118Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar). Retroviral replication is dependent on the viral protein integrase catalyzing the recombination of the viral DNA genome into the host genomic DNA. Integrase binds to the two blunt-ended viral LTRs, hydrolyzes the terminal two nucleotides to expose a recessed 3′-OH of the conserved CA dinucleotide at each of the ends (the processing activity), and inserts these “processed” ends into the host DNA (the joining activity) at sites separated by a virus-specific stagger of six base pairs for avian sarcoma virus (ASV). 1The abbreviations used are: ASVavian sarcoma virusINintegrase A260 and A280, absorbances at 260 nm and 280 nm, respectivelyLTRlong terminal repeatTBETris-Borate-EDTAPEIpolyethyleneimine The location of the insertion is nearly random as there is little sequence specificity for the site of recombination within the host genome (2.Aiyar A.

The processing and joining activities are biochemically similar in that both use a hydroxyl group as the nucleophile in an endonucleolytic cleavage. In the case of the processing activity (3′-dinucleotide removal), the enzyme is specific in its choice of electrophile (the cognate CATT), whereas the nucleophile (the processed CA-OH) is specified in the joining reaction (strand transfer). Both the ends-processing and joining activities have been reproduced in vitro with purified recombinant integrase and oligonucleotides whose sequences are derived from the retroviral U3 and U5 LTR sequences (5.Kukolj G.

Detailed examination of the processing activity in vitro has revealed that integrase requires the physiologically relevant configuration of both U3 and U5 ends to be bound concurrently for maximal efficiency of processing catalysis, with the U3 sequence undergoing both the cleavage and recombination reactions earlier than the U5 sequence (8.Bao K.

Buckle M. Buc H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 1498-1506Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar), it is still undetermined how the three domains interact with each other within a single integrase monomer or a multimer integrase-DNA complex. Wang et al.(16.Wang, J., Ling, H., Yang, W., and Craigie, R. (2001) EMBO J. 7333–7343Google Scholar) have recently reported the structural solution of a two-domain fragment of human immunodeficiency virus-1 integrase that suggests a dimer of dimers resembling Tn5 transposase. However, the actual oligomeric state and geometric arrangement of integrase monomers within the active DNA-protein complex remain unconfirmed, and the detailed catalytic mechanism of the coordinated cleavage of four different DNA segments, resulting in the concerted insertion of the two LTR ends, remains unsolved. Two general models of the organization of the multimeric complex necessary to catalyze the insertion of the two ends of DNA have been proposed (17.Katz R.A. Skalka A.M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1994; 63: 133-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (535) Google Scholar, 18.Engelman A. Mizuuchi K. Craigie R. Cell. 1991; 67: 1211-1221Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (543) Google Scholar, 19.Vincent K.A. Ellison V. Chow S.A. Brown P.O. J. Virol. 1993; 67: 425-437Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In one model, separate integrase molecules bind each of the two processed viral DNA ends with two separate integrase molecules binding host DNA to prepare the two host phosphates for attack. In the other model, each integrase monomer contains separate binding sites for host and viral DNA, and a single active site catalyzes both processing and joining reactions, thus requiring the active integrase complex to only be a dimer. An unanswered question with both of the models, however, is the manner in which the LTR ends, which serve as electrophiles in the processing reaction, come to reside in the active site as nucleophiles in the joining reaction (where the host DNA is the electrophile). This question becomes increasingly complex when one considers the possible combinations of nucleophiles recognized by integrase (20.Skinner L.M. Sudol M. Harper A.L. Katzman M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 114-124Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar) and the fact that there must be specific and nonspecific DNA binding sites. In the course of undertaking a presteady-state investigation of the processing reaction using synapsed-end substrates, we developed an assay that features a preincubation step to form DNA-protein complexes before the initiation of catalytic activity. Along with analysis of product formation during the first enzymatic turnover, the presteady-state assay enabled direct comparison of the reactivity of substrates while minimizing the complications involved in the quantitation of enzymatic activity. Using this assay for the processing reaction with synapsed-end substrates modeled after those of Kukolj and Skalka (5.Kukolj G. Skalka A.M. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 2556-2567Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar), we report here the discovery of a novel splicing reaction with products nearly indistinguishable from those of the processing and joining reactions. The identification of the splicing reaction resolved complications with the accurate quantitation of enzymatic activity. Additionally, the splicing reaction was used as a tool to gain significant insight into the structure-function relationship in the mechanism of sequence recognition by integrase. Specifically, the splicing reaction allowed us to probe the selection of nucleophiles and electrophiles by the structurally defined, sequence-specific binding sites of integrase. The results from these experiments allow us to propose a model for the configuration of the nucleophile and electrophile within the enzyme active site that satisfies the varying specificity requirements of the three integrase-catalyzed reactions. For clarity, the remainder of this report will refer to the 3′-end dinucleotide TT-trimming activity as the “processing” reaction, the subsequent sequence-dependent insertion of processed ends into a double-stranded DNA target as the “joining” reaction, and this novel activity with synapsed substrates as the “splicing” reaction.

Final yield and purity of radiolabeled substrates were determined by thin-layer liquid chromatography on PEI cellulose plates developed in a mobile phase of 0.75 m LiCl, 1.25 m formic acid, 40% ethanol. Under these conditions, labeled DNA remains at the origin, whereas unincorporated nucleotides are eluted by the mobile phase. Accurate quantitation of DNA yield is achieved by comparing the amount of radioactivity bound at the origin for samples obtained before and after purification steps. Typically, 87–90% of the DNA is recovered with complete removal of unincorporated nucleotides. In addition, comparison of the radioactivity in unincorporated label and DNA in the pre-purification sample shows that the efficiency of the labeling reaction exceeds 90% under these conditions.Table INomenclature and μM extinction coefficients at 260 nm DNA substratesNameaThe following is the naming convention used for annealed DNA substrates.

Plasmid pRC23(IN) in Escherichia coli MC1061 has been described (23.Terry R. Soltis D.A. Katzman M. Cobrinik D. Leis J. Skalka A.M. J. Virol. 1988; 62: 2358-2365Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The translated sequence of this construct differs from the sequence recorded for the Schmidt-Ruppin B strain in the GenBank (accession number AF052428). These differences have been attributed to strain variance. 2R. Katz, personal communication. Because of the possible importance of one of these differences, a glutamic acid at position 256 was altered to match the lysine of the reported sequence by PCR site-directed mutagenesis. The altered gene was subsequently subcloned into pET24a (Novagen Madison, WI) to produce the recombinant plasmid, pET24a(IN). Overproduction of integrase from this construct was obtained in E. coli BL21(DE3) (Novagen) by using isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside induction at 25 °C. Although recombinant integrase from either variant is biologically competent,2 in pre-steady state in vitro assays, integrase with Lys-256 produced 2-fold greater processing and splicing burst amplitudes (data not shown). E. coli BL21(DE3)/pET24a(IN) was grown in Luria-Bertani broth with 30 μg/ml kanamycin, 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, and 6 drops/liter Sigma antifoam B at 25 °C to A600 ≅ 0.8 (∼4 × 108 cells/ml) and induced with 1 mm isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside, 0.5 mmZnCl2, and additional Sigma antifoam B. The cells were then grown for 3 h at 25 °C and harvested by centrifugation, rinsed in buffer A containing 100 mm NaCl (A100), recentrifuged, and the pellet was stored at −80 °C. The average yield of wet weight cell paste ranged from 4 to 5 g/l of culture. The crude post-induction cell lysate was analyzed by SDS-PAGE stained with Coomassie Blue. All purification steps were performed at 4 °C or on ice except where noted. Frozen cells (35 g) were thawed and completely resuspended in 80 ml of buffer A20 plus 1 ml of protease inhibitor cocktail (Sigma, P8849), 5 mg of carboxypeptidase inhibitor from potato tuber (Sigma), and 300 μg/ml lysozyme. The suspension was incubated for 25 min at room temperature with constant stirring, placed on ice, and adjusted to 0.52 m NaCl, 1 mm ZnCl2, 5 mm dithiothreitol. An additional 1 ml of protease inhibitor mixture and 5 mg of carboxypeptidase inhibitor were added, and the suspension was stirred for an additional 20 min. The lysate was sonicated for 20 min (20-W output, Fisher Scientific 60 Sonic Dismembrator) to reduce viscosity followed by centrifugation at 43,700 × g for 60 min to remove cellular debris, yielding 90 ml of cleared lysate. The cleared lysate was adjusted to 100 mm NaCl by the addition of buffer B with no salt (B0). Integrase was precipitated by the addition of 5% PEI while stirring to a final concentration of 0.05% (v/v). Stirring was continued for an additional 20 min, and the precipitate was collected by centrifugation at 15,300 × g for 20 min. The pellet was washed by homogenization using a Dounce homogenizer with 100 ml of buffer B with 350 mm NaCl (B350), and the pellet was recovered by centrifugation at 15,300 × g for 15 min. The pellet was then extracted twice using a Dounce Homogenizer with 150 ml of buffer B500 containing 3 mmdithiothreitol and 50 nm ZnCl2 followed by centrifugation at 15,300 × g for 20 min each. The combined 300 ml of “PEI eluate” was diluted to 350 mmNaCl with buffer B0 and loaded at a flow rate of 5 ml/min onto a 38-ml Macro-Prep High S (Bio-Rad) column (6.4 × 2.6 cm) pre-equilibrated in B350. The column was washed to base line with 3–4 column volumes of buffer B500, and integrase was eluted with a 225-ml linear NaCl gradient from 0.5 to 1.5 m NaCl in buffer B at the same flow rate. Integrase was eluted as a broad peak centered around 1.1 m NaCl. Fractions from 900 mm to 1.4m NaCl were pooled. The front portion of the elution peak, corresponding to an NaCl concentration lower than 900 mm, was excluded from the pooled eluate to avoid a nuclease contaminant. Integrase was precipitated with ammonium sulfate at 56.4% saturation and redissolved in 20 ml of storage buffer. The concentrated protein was dialyzed against 3 changes of 500 ml of storage buffer. The final integrase concentration in storage buffer after a 45-min clearing spin at 43,700 × g typically ranged from 130 to 200 μm as determined spectrophotometrically using ε280 = 59,940 m−1cm−1. This value of ε280 was calculated based on the presence of 2 Tyr, 10 Trp, and 4 Cys (24.Gill S.C. von Hippel P.H. Anal. Biochem. 1989; 182: 319-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (5073) Google Scholar). UV spectra of integrase obtained in 0–8 m urea showed no changes in A280 upon unfolding of the protein. Protein was stored at −80 °C in 0.3–1-ml aliquots. The protocol yielded 2–2.5 mg of purified integrase (>99% homogeneity as judged by SDS-PAGE stained with Coomassie Blue)/g of wet cells. The purified pooled fractions, when assayed for both single and double-stranded nuclease activity, showed less than 5% nonspecific degradation of labeled DNA at incubation times in excess of 60 min, which exceeds the longest time points used in our experiments. Standard reaction mixtures (100 μl) contained 10 mm Na-HEPES, pH 7.5, 4% glycerol, 20 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 10 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, 0.050 mg/ml acetylated bovine serum albumin, and 130 mm NaCl. Integrase was first preincubated with radiolabeled oligonucleotide substrates on ice for 30 min then warmed briefly for 2 min at 37 °C immediately before the start of the assay. A complete range of preincubation (0–2 h) and warm-up times (0–15 min) were tested to ensure the mixtures had achieved equilibrium while minimizing enzyme degradation. Reactions were initiated by the addition of 37 °C MnCl2 to 5 mm. Although there is uncertainty in the literature with regard to the physiological divalent metal cofactor for integrase, Mn2+ was used because it has been observed that retroviral integrases exhibit maximal activity in standard assays with this divalent cation (20.Skinner L.M. Sudol M. Harper A.L. Katzman M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 114-124Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Additionally, no activity was detected with ASV integrase when Mg2+ was used at physiological concentrations. A range of MnCl2concentrations (0–20 mm) were examined to optimize enzymatic activity. At time points ranging from 4 s to 30 min, aliquots of the reaction mixture were withdrawn and added to a quenching solution (8 m urea, 0.25 m EDTA, 20% sucrose) in a 2:1 quench:reaction mix ratio. Generally, seven time points were taken in the first 30 s of the reaction with seven more time points in the ensuing 29 min. The reaction products were then analyzed by denaturing sequencing PAGE (20% acrylamide, 8m urea, TBE) using a Sequi-Gen GT 38 × 39 cm apparatus (Bio-Rad). Bands in the gel were visualized by using a Molecular Dynamics PhosphorImager (Amersham Biosciences), and the intensity of DNA bands was quantitated using ImageQuant software (Amersham Biosciences). The intensity of each product band, Ii(t), at each time, t, was first normalized with respect to the sum of intensities in the starting substrate band, I0(t), plus all product bands according to Equation 1. Fi,norm(t)=Ii(t)I0(t)+∑i=1nIi(t)Equation 1 This normalized product fraction, Fi,norm, was then corrected for background intensity present at t = 0 for the i th band and renormalized for background intensities of all product bands to obtain the final corrected product fraction, Fi,corr according to Equation 2. Fi,corr(t)=Fi,norm(t)−Fi,norm(0)1−∑i=1nFi,norm(0)Equation 2 The number of exponential phases observable for any particular experiment increased with the length of the time regime under examination (8.Bao K. Skalka A.M. Wong I. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 12099-12108Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). Accordingly, the resulting time courses were fitted to Equation 3 consisting of n exponential terms, with amplitudes Ai and apparent rate constants λburst,i, plus a linear term with an apparent rate constant λlin to fit to the linear portion of the ensuing exponential phase. y=∑i−1nAi(1−e−λburstt)+λlintEquation 3 Non-linear least squares fittings were performed using Kaleidagraph software (Synergy, Redding, PA). A 300-μl reaction was performed under standard conditions with 3 μm integrase and 3 μm *5t/5b(2)3t/3b or *5t-2/5b(2)3t/3b (for oligodeoxyribonucleotide definitions see Table I) and allowed to proceed for 6.5 min. The reaction was stopped with quench solution, and the products were separated by denaturing sequencing PAGE in a 20% acrylamide, 8 m urea gel. The product bands were recorded on Kodak X-Omat film, and the largest product band was excised from the gel and isolated with an Elutrap electroelution device (Schleicher & Schuell). Maxam-Gilbert sequencing was performed on the purified product DNA according to the published protocol (25.Ausubel F.M. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. Greene Publishing Associates and Wiley-Interscience, New York1988Google Scholar). Nitrocellulose filter binding experiments were performed with only minor modifications to the double-filter method previously described (26.Wong I. Lohman T.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 5428-5432Crossref PubMed Scopus (363) Google Scholar). Standard assay buffer without Mn2+ was used for binding studies. Integrase was first incubated on ice for 30 min with radiolabeled oligonucleotide substrates. After incubation, the solution was filtered through a combination of nitrocellulose (BA-S83) and DEAE (1 NA-45 or 3 DE-81) membranes (Schleicher & Schuell or Whatman, Maidstone, England) by using a 96-well Bio-Dot microfiltration apparatus (Bio-Rad). Immediately after filtration of the reaction solution, the wells of the apparatus were rinsed twice with an equal volume of ice-cold buffer. The filters were imaged by using a Molecular Dynamics PhosphorImager (Amersham Biosciences) and quantitated as described (26.Wong I. Lohman T.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 5428-5432Crossref PubMed Scopus (363) Google Scholar). For experiments using DE-81 membranes, the radioactivity of all three membranes was quantified and summed. Fig. 1A shows results from a typical first-turnover experiment performed with a synapsed DNA substrate, *5t/5b(2)3t/3b, as detected by electrophoresis on an 8 m urea, 20% acrylamide sequencing gel. This substrate contains DNA sequences from the U3 and U5 ends of the viral LTR organized with the cognate CATT sites held together by a two-nucleotide single-stranded tether in a head-to-head configuration (5.Kukolj G. Skalka A.M. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 2556-2567Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). The substrate was radiolabeled at 5t, the 21-mer DNA strand containing the U5 sequence. This 21-mer terminates at the 3′-end with the processing cognate sequence, CATT, which is endonucleolytically cleaved by integrase at the −2 position to exponentially yield an expected 19-mer as the major product at 0.2 s−1 (Fig. 1B) plus a dinucleotide TT product, which is silent in this assay (27.Brown P.O. Bowerman B. Varmus H.E. Bishop J.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 2525-2529Crossref PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar, 28.Katzman M. Katz R.A. Skalka A.M. Leis J. J.

Although the concentrations used (500 nm integrase, 500 nm DNA) were known to be not saturating, the propensity of integrase to aggregate at higher concentrations precluded experiments under saturating conditions (8.Bao K. Skalka A.M. Wong I. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 12099-12108Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). In addition, a minor 18-mer side produc"
