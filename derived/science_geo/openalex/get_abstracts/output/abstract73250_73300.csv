https://openalex.org/W2070213858,"Neonatal thymectomy of mice, when no ectopic thymus existed, constantly resulted in developmental arrest of the ovary but not of the testis; it also caused sterility in the female. The ovaries of thymectomized mice were extremely small and were characterized by absence of follicles and corpora lutea. Such an ovarian dysgenesia was observed when the mice were thymectomized at 3 days of age, but not at 7 days or later; it was prevented by thymus grafting."

Amphetamine always increased activity, but scopolamine had no effect on younger rats, which suggests that adrenergic excitatory areas in the brainstem mature more rapidly than cholinergic inhibitory areas in the forebrain."

The DNA produced systematic changes in the absorption spectrum of berberine which suggest that single alkaloid molecules bind to DNA. Flow dichroism of purines and pyrimidines and of berberine in the complex with DNA had the same signs and magnitudes. Berberine shifted the thermal strand separation profile of DNA to higher temperatures. Therefore, the alkaloid forms a complex with DNA, probably by intercalation."
https://openalex.org/W2009906629,The net sodium extrusion rate by the gill of the seawater-adapted euryhaline flounder is identical to the potassium influx. The excretion of sodium is blocked in K(+)-free seawater solutions. The instantaneous sodium outflux readjustment pattern of flounders transferred from seawater to solutions of various sodium chloride or potassium chloride concentrations is consistent with the hypothesis of a linkage between Na(+) outflux and K(+) influx through a common exchange carrier. External Na(+) and K(+) compete for this comnmonz carrier. It is suggested that the exchange diffusion mechanism (linkage of sodium influx and outflux) and the high internal sodium turnover rate which characterizes all seawater teleosts are the results of this competitive process. The sodium-potassium dependent adenosine triphosphatase system occurring in the gill of the seawater teleosts may play a central role in this sodium-potassium exchange pump.
https://openalex.org/W2099475871,"Abstract The methylation of histones was studied in mature and immature red cells of the duck. Histone Fractions I, II, III-IV, and V were prepared from cells which had been incubated in the presence of l-methionine-(methyl-3H). The histones were hydrolyzed in acid and the digests were chromatographed on an amino acid analyzer under conditions which have been shown to resolve the methyl derivatives of lysine as well as those of histidine. All of the histone digests were radioactive, due in part to the incorporation of methionine during protein synthesis de novo (Fraction III-IV) and in part to methylation of preformed histones (Fractions I and V). Histone Fractions I and V were found to contain radioactive 3-methylhistidine. The formation of 3-methylhistidine occurs much more rapidly in immature erythroid cells than in the mature erythrocytes."

https://openalex.org/W1502219802,"The kinetic properties of purified yeast pyruvate kinase were investigated. The enzyme showed cooperative kinetics toward the essential activating monovalent cations K+ and NH4+, Mg2+, and phosphoenolpyruvate. Fructose 1,6-diphosphate, which yielded homotropic cooperative kinetics and did not affect maximal velocity, transformed the sigmoidal kinetics of K+ and NH4+, Mg2+, and phosphoenolpyruvate to hyperbolic and lowered the apparent Km for each variable. Adenosine diphosphate, however, exhibited no cooperativity and was relatively unaffected by fructose 1,6-diphosphate. The enzyme displayed a complex velocity dependence on pH."

https://openalex.org/W1546110934,"Abstract Rats and mice were given 3H-thymidine, and 18 to 24 hours later nuclei, mitochondria, and microsomes were isolated from the livers by differential centrifugation. The nucleic acids were extracted from the fractions by means of the phenol-sodium dodecyl sulfate procedure. DNA in amounts of 1% or less of the total tissue content was obtained from both the mitochondria and the microsomes. The specific radioactivity of the DNA samples followed the order mitochondrial g microsomal g nuclear. The radioactivity of the mitochondria- and microsome-associated DNA had half-lives of 8 to 9 days in vivo. The microsome-associated DNA was recovered mainly in the membranous portions of the microsomes, was removed by deoxyribonuclease, and closely resembled nuclear DNA in melting behavior, banding in CsCl, sedimentation rate, appearance under the electron microscope, and hybridization with cytoplasmic RNA. The possibility was examined that microsome-associated DNA represented a mixture of contaminating nuclear and mitochondrial DNA. Assays for succinic dehydrogenase, a mitochondrial marker enzyme, indicated a contamination of microsomes by mitochondria of ≤2%, a value insufficient to account for the results on this basis. In other experiments, the loss of DNA from nuclei and its adsorption by microsome were described; the specific radioactivity of the nuclear DNA released, however, was considerably lower than the radioactivity of the microsome-associated DNA, so nuclear leakage of DNA also did not appear to explain the results with microsomes. Microsomes were shown to have RNA polymerase activity but no evidence could be obtained for the involvement of microsome-associated DNA in this activity. The data obtained lead to the conclusion that although DNA has been found to be associated with microsomes and may be an integral component of the latter, alternate explanations based upon contamination by nuclear or mitochondrial DNA, or both, could also account for the recovery of DNA in the microsomal fraction. Since the data do not decide between these possibilities, further experiments will be required to decide if the DNA associated with microsomes is a true microsomal DNA."

https://openalex.org/W1523349002,"Abstract The stimulation of DNA synthesis which occurs in mouse salivary gland 20 to 30 hours after a single administration of isoproterenol is inhibited by drugs that inhibit protein synthesis. Both cycloheximide and puromycin are most effective in inhibiting isoproterenol-stimulated DNA synthesis when given 1 hour after the isoproterenol. At this time, the aminonucleoside of puromycin has no effect on the subsequent onset of DNA synthesis. Although cycloheximide has only a temporary effect on protein synthesis in mouse salivary gland, its effect on isoproterenol-stimulated DNA synthesis, when given 1 hour after isoproterenol, consists not in a mere delay but in a true inhibition. The free ribosome fraction of mouse salivary gland shows an increase in protein synthesis 1 hour after isoproterenol, when the stimulated gland is incubated in vitro. In addition, ribosomes isolated from salivary glands of mice killed 1 hour after the administration of isoproterenol have a higher amino acid-incorporating activity in a cell-free system than free ribosomes isolated from control salivary glands. This increased capacity for protein synthesis is accompanied by an increase in the number of free polysomes in the stimulated gland. These results indicate that isoproterenol causes an early stimulation of protein synthesis in mouse salivary gland and that this stimulation is relevant to the subsequent onset of DNA synthesis."

Rat liver nuclei and chromatin incubated in adenosine triphosphate labeled in the gamma position with phosphorus-32 demonstrated rapid phosphorylation in vitro of the nuclear proteins. Dipteran salivary glands incubated in either labeled adenosine triphosphate or orthophosphate labeled with phosphorus-32 showed that there is phosphorylation of chromosomal protein. The phosphorus is associated in protein from both liver and salivary gland nuclei predominantly with phosphoserine.

Phenylacetylene is hydrated to phenylacetaldehyde by way of both nucleophilic and radical additions of H2S followed by hydrolysis of the thioaldehyde. The addition of NH3 and HCN to phenylacetaldehyde yields phenylalanine nitrile which is hydrolyzed to phenylalanine. A small yield of tyrosine is obtained from the radical addition of H2S to phenylacetylene.

https://openalex.org/W1502686008,"Abstract The equilibria of copper(II) (M) with two amino acids, l-histidine (A) and l-threonine (B), and their mixtures were investigated by potentiometry in aqueous solution (0.1 m KNO3, 25°). The concentrations of the free ligands were estimated by means of the graphic techniques of the potentiometric area and/or Sillen's method. The graphically determined stoichiometric stability constants of the following complexes (MHA, MA, MH-1A, MH2A2, MHA2, MA2, M2H-2A2, MB, MB2, MH-1B2, MH-2B2, MHAB, MAB) were refined with a general least squares treatment which also confirmed the presence of an additional species, MH-1AB. As in previous studies of mixed ligand systems, the stability constants of the mixed species were found to be greater than those of their parent complexes. The identity of the standardized neutralization curves of corresponding mixtures of Cu(II)-l-histidine-l-threonine and Cu(II)-d-histidine-l-threonine showed that the formation of the mixed complexes is not stereospecific."

https://openalex.org/W1662984506,"Abstract Fractions of poly-l-proline Form II ranging in molecular weight from 1,600 to 21,000 were compared in their ability to serve as competitive inhibitors for the synthesis of hydroxyproline by protocollagen proline hydroxylase. The degree of inhibition of the enzyme increased with the size of the polymer, and the Ki values decreased progressively with molecular weight. The results indicated that poly-l-proline polymers with 150 to 200 residues have higher affinities for the inhibitor site or sites on the enzyme than smaller poly-l-proline fractions with the same structure in solution. The data could not be explained solely on the basis that large fractions of poly-l-proline act as multifunctional reactants with cooperative or noncooperative binding of several enzyme molecules per polypeptide. Accordingly, it appears that interaction between the enzyme and poly-l-proline involves some unusual feature such as an inhibitor site large enough to accommodate 150 to 200 prolyl residues or lateral movement of the enzyme along the polypeptide."

https://openalex.org/W1496789868,"Hog thyroid tautomerase (EC 5.3.2.1, phenylpyruvate keto-enol isomerase), an enzyme which is believed to play a role in the biosynthesis of thyroxine, has been purified over 1000-fold. The purification procedure involves a heat step at 70°, gel filtration on Sephadex G-100, ion exchange chromatography on carboxymethyl Sephadex C-50, and, finally, gel filtration on Sephadex G-50. The enzyme is homogeneous by the following criteria. It gives a single peak in sedimentation velocity analysis and shows a single band on disc polyacrylamide gel and starch gel electrophoresis, and the sedimentation equilibrium plot is linear, even at the lowest protein concentrations. The pH optimum of the purified tautomerase is 6.2. Its molecular weight is 44,000. The amino acid composition of the enzyme, as well as some of its physico-chemical properties, are presented. The enzyme is able to substitute for borate ions in the coupling reaction of thyroxine synthesis."

https://openalex.org/W1652227814,Abstract Suspensions of tadpole liver cells have been developed as a model to further understanding of the biochemical differentiation of this tissue during thyroxine-induced metamorphosis. The cell population is homogeneous and stable; no cell division or DNA synthesis occurs in these isolated cells. RNA synthesis in cell suspensions is stimulated by thyroxine and triiodothyronine. The optimum concentration of both thyroxine and triiodothyronine for stimulation of RNA synthesis is about 10-7 m. Rapidly labeled RNA isolated from thyroxine-treated and nontreated cell suspensions sediments in the region between 4 and 10 S. The base composition of RNA synthesized by liver cells treated in vitro with thyroxine differs significantly from that of untreated liver cells and from bulk tadpole liver RNA. The ratio of cytosine plus guanine to total bases of RNA from thyroxine-treated cells is similar to that of DNA from this species. Neither thyroxine nor triiodothyronine had any effect on the incorporation of amino acids into protein. Frog serum stimulates RNA and protein synthesis. Rana catesbeiana serum causes the aggregation of isolated liver cells.

https://openalex.org/W1492817925,"Abstract The reactions between l-threonine dehydratase from Clostridium tetanomorphum and N-ethylmaleimide, tetranitromethane, iodine, fluorodinitrobenzene, or diazobenzene sulfonic acid were studied at 2° in order to determine the effects of chemical modification on certain kinetic parameters. At times from 0 to 1 hour after treatment, samples were taken for the determination of Michaelis constant (Km) for l-threonine and the maximum velocity of dehydration (Vmax). The data revealed that N-ethylmaleimide at pH 6.5 and tetranitromethane at pH 6.3 were able to alter catalytic ability as determined by a 10-fold decrease in Vmax. The Km for threonine was not appreciably affected under these conditions. The substrate analogue, allothreonine, was protective against the changes in Vmax. Iodination at pH 7.6 or pH 6.3 modified the enzyme so that the Km for threonine increased up to 4-fold, but Vmax was unaffected. At pH 6.3, the presence of ADP during iodination prevented the increase in Km but allothreonine was without effect. Tetranitromethane at pH 8.3 or fluorodinitrobenzene and diazobenzene sulfonic acid at pH 7.6 modified the enzyme such that the Km for threonine increased 3- to 5-fold and Vmax decreased to 10% the original value. In most cases, ADP could protect against large increases in Km but not against changes in Vmax, whereas allothreonine could prevent decreases in Vmax but was largely ineffective against increases in Km. Protection by ADP or allothreonine was generally more effective at pH 6.3 to 6.5 than at pH 7.6 or higher. The extent of change in Km upon chemical modification was approximately the same as that seen with native dehydratase assayed in the absence and presence of ADP. In both cases, Km increased to near 70 mm from the 20 mm value obtained for the native ADP-activated enzyme. Concomitant with the increase in Km promoted by iodination or dinitrophenylation, Ka for ADP increased dramatically. The results presented provide a correlation between modifications which are protected by ADP and changes in the Michaelis constant for l-threonine, as well as between modifications which are protected by allothreonine and decreases in Vmax for dehydration. These kinetic parameters seem to indicate that sites specifically protected by allothreonine or ADP can be modified through appropriate choice of reagent and conditions. In these sites can be equated with the binding sites for substrate and ADP, then it would appear that important differences exist in the composition or degree of exposure of certain reactive amino acids associated with each site."
