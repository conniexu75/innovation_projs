https://openalex.org/W2997579068,"Video and image data are regularly used in the field of benthic ecology to document biodiversity. However, their use is subject to a number of challenges, principally the identification of taxa within the images without associated physical specimens. The challenge of applying traditional taxonomic keys to the identification of fauna from images has led to the development of personal, group, or institution level reference image catalogues of operational taxonomic units (OTUs) or morphospecies. Lack of standardisation among these reference catalogues has led to problems with observer bias and the inability to combine datasets across studies. In addition, lack of a common reference standard is stifling efforts in the application of artificial intelligence to taxon identification. Using the North Atlantic deep sea as a case study, we propose a database structure to facilitate standardisation of morphospecies image catalogues between research groups and support future use in multiple front-end applications. We also propose a framework for coordination of international efforts to develop reference guides for the identification of marine species from images. The proposed structure maps to the Darwin Core standard to allow integration with existing databases. We suggest a management framework where high-level taxonomic groups are curated by a regional team, consisting of both end users and taxonomic experts. We identify a mechanism by which overall quality of data within a common reference guide could be raised over the next decade. Finally, we discuss the role of a common reference standard in advancing marine ecology and supporting sustainable use of this ecosystem."
https://openalex.org/W2997827971,"Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is a progressive liver disease characterized by dysregulated lipid metabolism and chronic inflammation ultimately resulting in fibrosis. Untreated, NAFLD may progress to non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), cirrhosis and death. However, currently there are no FDA approved therapies that treat NAFLD/NASH. Thrombospondin-I (TSP-1) is a large glycoprotein in the extracellular matrix that regulates numerous cellular pathways including transforming growth factor beta 1 (TGF-β1) activation, angiogenesis, inflammation and cellular adhesion. Increased expression of TSP-1 has been reported in various liver diseases; however, its role in NAFLD/NASH is not well understood. We first examined TSP-1 modulation in hepatic stellate cell activation, a critical initiating step in hepatic fibrosis. Knockdown or inhibition of TSP-1 attenuated HSC activation measured by alpha smooth muscle actin (α-SMA) and Collagen I expression. To investigate the impact of TSP-1 modulation in context of NAFLD/NASH, we examined the effect of TSP-1 deficiency in the choline deficient L-amino acid defined high fat diet (CDAHFD) model of NASH in mice by assessing total body and liver weight, serum liver enzyme levels, serum lipid levels, liver steatosis, liver fibrosis and liver gene expression in wild type (WT) and TSP-1 null mice. CDAHFD fed mice, regardless of genotype, developed phenotypes of NASH, including significant increase in liver weight and liver enzymes, steatosis and fibrosis. However, in comparison to WT, CDAHFD-fed TSP-1 deficient mice were protected against numerous NASH phenotypes. TSP-1 null mice exhibited a decrease in serum lipid levels, inflammation markers and hepatic fibrosis. RNA-seq based transcriptomic profiles from the liver of CDAHFD fed mice determined that both WT and TSP-1 null mice exhibited similar gene expression signatures following CDAHFD, similar to biophysical and histological assessment comparison. Comparison of transcriptomic profiles based on genotype suggested that peroxisome proliferator activated receptor alpha (PPARα) pathway and amino acid metabolism pathways are differentially expressed in TSP-1 null mice. Activation of PPARα pathway was supported by observed decrease in serum lipid levels. Our findings provide important insights into the role of TSP-1 in context of NAFLD/NASH and TSP-1 may be a target of interest to develop anti-fibrotic therapeutics for NAFLD/NASH."
https://openalex.org/W2998373628,"Objectives To assess the association between salivary ultrasonography (sUS) findings and disease activity and damage in patients with primary Sjogren’s syndrome (pSS). We investigated the potential prognostic role of sUS as a tool in the assessment of disease activity. Methods In 303 pSS patients, disease activity was assessed by the European League Against Rheumatism (EULAR) Sjogren’s Syndrome Disease Activity Index (ESSDAI), the EULAR Sjogren’s Syndrome Patient Reported Index (ESSPRI), the Sjogren’s Syndrome Disease Activity Index (SSDAI) and the Sjogren’s Syndrome Disease Damage Index (SSDDI). The sUS parenchymal inhomogeneity (de Vita scoring system) was assessed in 303 pSS patients and 111 heathy controls. A receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve was used to determine the cut-off value of the pathological sUS score. Logistic regression analysis was performed to assess risk factors for moderate and high disease activity. Results A pathological sUS score ≥ 2 was recorded in 271 (89.7%) patients and 8 (8.6%) healthy controls. Patients with moderate and high ESSDAI and SSDAI scores had significantly higher US activity in comparison to that of pSS patients with low disease activity (p = 0.006; p = 0.01, respectively). Additionally, pSS patients with moderate and high SSDDI scores had higher US activity (p = 0.031). Pathological sUS correlated with the glandular domain within the ESSDAI and SSDDI (p<0.001). The patients with a severe US score (5–6) had a 3.5 times greater chance of having moderate or high disease activity. The specificity of the severe de Vita sUS score for ESSDAI and SSDAI was 85.1% and 85.2%, respectively. In contrast, the sensitivity of a severe de Vita sUS score for ESSDAI was low, at 29.2%, while the sensitivity for the SSDAI was higher, 42.3%. In the analysis of disease activity, a de Vita score ≥ 5 could be used as a risk factor for moderate and high ESSDAI (p = 0.042) and SSDAI (p = 0.006). Conclusions Pathological salivary gland ultrasonography is associated with high disease activity and damage in pSS. Consequently, sUS abnormalities might be surrogate items for glandular domains in the assessment of disease activity and damage. Thus, ultrasonography of the salivary gland combined with clinical and serological markers might be part of the next prognostic and therapeutic algorithm in the near future."
https://openalex.org/W2997633080,"The Job Demands and Control model classifies job types as active, passive, low-strain or high-strain, based on a combination of job demands and control. While studies have shown high-strain jobs to have adverse consequences for health and work participation, prognostic factors for the four job types have been less explored. The aim of this study was to assess the associations between sociodemographic factors and job descriptors and being in high-strain, low-strain, active and passive jobs.The WIRUS Screening study targeted Norwegian employees in private and public enterprises. In this study, associations with job types among 4,487 employees were investigated with binary logistic regression analyses, adjusting for sociodemographic and job-related variables.In fully adjusted models, high-strain job was associated with female gender; lower education; shift work; and doing work outside the workplace. Low-strain job was associated with opposite scores on the same variables, and with lower job position. Active job was associated with lower age; female gender; higher levels of education; higher job position level; shift work; and not doing work outside the workplace. Passive job was associated with opposite scores on the same variables.The study corroborates the role gender and education have for experiencing the job, and expands on existing knowledge on the role of job position and irregular working hours and spaces. By identifying factors associated with job types, the prevention of health problems and work disability may become be more targeted."
https://openalex.org/W2996837020,"The iron dependent, programmed cell death, ferroptosis was described first in tumour cells. It showed distinct features from the already known cell death forms such as apoptosis, necrosis and autophagy. The caspase independent cell death could be induced by the depletion of glutathione by erastin or by the inhibition of the lipid peroxide scavenger enzyme GPX4 by RSL3 and it was accompanied by the generation of lipid reactive oxygen species. Recently, ferroptosis-like cell death associated to glutathione depletion, lipid peroxidation and iron dependency could also be induced in plant cells by heat treatment. Unfortunately, the mediators and elements of the ferroptotic pathway have not been described yet. Our present results on Arabidopsis thaliana cell cultures suggest that acrolein, a lipid peroxide-derived reactive carbonyl species, is involved in plant ferroptosis-like cell death. The acrolein induced cell death could be mitigated by the known ferroptosis inhibitors such as Ferrostatin-1, Deferoxamine, α-Tocopherol, and glutathione. At the same time acrolein can be a mediator of ferroptosis-like cell death in plant cells since the known ferroptosis inducer RSL3 induced cell death could be mitigated by the acrolein scavenger carnosine. Finally, on the contrary to the caspase independent ferroptosis in human cells, we found that caspase-like activity can be involved in plant ferroptosis-like cell death."
https://openalex.org/W2998257217,"Background Children who have lost a parent to HIV/AIDS, known as AIDS orphans, face multiple stressors affecting their health and development. Family economic empowerment (FEE) interventions have the potential to improve these outcomes and mitigate the risks they face. We present efficacy and cost-effectiveness analyses of the Bridges study, a savings-led FEE intervention among AIDS-orphaned adolescents in Uganda at four-year follow-up. Methods Intent-to-treat analyses using multilevel models compared the effects of two savings-led treatment arms: Bridges (1:1 matched incentive) and BridgesPLUS (2:1 matched incentive) to a usual care control group on the following outcomes: self-rated health, sexual health, and mental health functioning. Total per-participant costs for each arm were calculated using the treatment-on-the-treated sample. Intervention effects and per-participant costs were used to calculate incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs). Findings Among 1,383 participants, 55% were female, 20% were double orphans. Mean age was 12 years at baseline. At 48-months, BridgesPLUS significantly improved self-rated health, (0.25, 95% CI 0.06, 0.43), HIV knowledge (0.21, 95% CI 0.01, 0.41), self-concept (0.26, 95% CI 0.09, 0.44), and self-efficacy (0.26, 95% CI 0.09, 0.43) and lowered hopelessness (-0.28, 95% CI -0.43, -0.12); whereas Bridges improved self-rated health (0.26, 95% CI 0.08, 0.43) and HIV knowledge (0.22, 95% CI 0.05, 0.39). ICERs ranged from $224 for hopelessness to $298 for HIV knowledge per 0.2 standard deviation change. Conclusions Most intervention effects were sustained in both treatment arms at two years post-intervention. Higher matching incentives yielded a significant and lasting effect on a greater number of outcomes among adolescents compared to lower matching incentives at a similar incremental cost per unit effect. These findings contribute to the evidence supporting the incorporation of FEE interventions within national social protection frameworks."
https://openalex.org/W2997503318,"Trichoderma has been used as an alternative to synthetic pesticides to control a variety of phytopathogenic fungi, oomycetes, and nematodes. Although its mechanism of pathogen suppression has been extensively studied, how Trichoderma interacts with non-target microbes is not well understood. Here, we investigated how two Trichoderma biological control agents (BCAs) interact with rhizosphere bacteria isolated from a tomato plant via secreted proteins, metabolites, and volatile compounds (VCs). Culture filtrates (CFs) of T. virens and T. harzianum, containing secreted proteins and metabolites, strongly inhibited (>75% reduction in growth) 39 and 19, respectively, out of 47 bacterial strains tested. Their CFs inhibited the remaining strains at lower degrees. Both metabolites and proteins are involved in inhibiting bacteria, but they seem to antagonize each other in inhibiting some strains. Trichoderma and bacteria suppressed the growth of each other using VCs. The secretion of antibacterial and antifungal molecules by T. virens and T. harzianum was significantly affected by VCs from some bacteria, suggesting that both Trichoderma BCAs and rhizosphere bacteria use VCs to influence each other in multiple ways. In light of these results, we discuss how metabolite-mediated interactions can potentially affect the effectiveness of biocontrol."
https://openalex.org/W2997446107,"Treating insects with a lower oxygen atmosphere before and during exposure to radiation can mitigate some of the negative physiological effects due to the irradiation. The irradiation of pupae under oxygen-reduced environment such as hypoxia or anoxia is routinely used in the sterile insect technique (SIT) of some tephritid species as it provides radiological protection. This treatment allows to have the sterile pupae already in sealed containers facilitating the shipment. SIT is an environment friendly control tactic that could be used to manage populations of Drosophila suzukii in confined areas such as greenhouses. The objectives of this study were to assess the effect of irradiation on the reproductive sterility in D. suzukii males and females under low-oxygen atmosphere (hypoxia) and atmosphere conditions (normoxia). Additionally, we assessed the differences in radiological sensitivity of pupae treated under hypoxia and normoxia conditions. Finally, the effect on emergence rate and flight ability of the irradiated D. suzukii adults exposed to doses that induced >99% of sterility were assessed. Pupae needed a 220 Gy irradiation dose to achieve >99% of egg hatch sterility in males irrespective of the atmosphere condition. For females the same level of sterility was achieved already at 75 Gy and 90 Gy for the normoxia and hypoxia treatments, respectively. Radiation exposure at 170 and 220 Gy under the two atmosphere treatments did not have any effect on the emergence rate and flight ability of D. suzukii males and females. Therefore, hypoxia conditions can be used as part of an area-wide insect pest management program applying SIT to facilitate the protocols of packing, irradiation and shipment of sterile D. suzukii pupae."
https://openalex.org/W2997123279,"This study aimed to determine the microbial diversity at different soil depths (0-5 and 5-20 cm) in a subtropical orchard during different seasons (i.e., spring, summer and autumn) to advance knowledge of the roles of microbes in orchard ecosystem balance. In tracking experiments conducted in an orchard (established in 1996), the phospholipid fatty acid (PLFA) biomarker method was employed to determine the soil microbial system. The total PLFA concentration did not vary significantly between soil depths but changed between seasons. It peaked in the summer at 258.97 ± 23.48 μg g soil-1 from 0-5 cm and at 270.99 ± 58.94 μg g soil-1 from 5-20 cm. A total of 33 microbial fatty acid biomarkers were observed and identified in the sampled soil. The quantities of PLFAs for 29 microbial groups varied significantly between seasons, except for 15:0 iso 3OH, 15:1 iso G, 16:0 2OH, and 17:0 iso 3OH. The bacterial PLFAs and fungal and actinomycetic PLFAs in the orchard soil collected in summer were significantly more abundant than those collected in the spring or autumn (P < 0.01). The number of soil microorganism species (richness) and the Simpson and Shannon-Wiener indexes were all highest in summer. The total PLFAs, bacterial PLFAs, fungal PLFAs, actinomycetic PLFAs, richness, and Simpson and Shannon-Wiener indexes were all significantly negatively correlated with soil pH, total organic carbon (TOC), total nitrogen (TN) and the cation exchange capacity (CEC) (P < 0.05)."
https://openalex.org/W2996907978,"Background Postural stability is one of the determinants of proper body posture and a condition for developing motor abilities in every human being. The measurement of the centre of pressure (COP) location and displacement is the most common technique of postural stability assessment. Objective The aim of this study was to assess differences in postural stability depending on sex of 5-year-old children with different body heights. Methods A study included 435 healthy children (200 girls and 235 boys) born in 2010 whose parents gave a written consent to their participation in the project. Postural stability was assessed with the use of the dynamographic platform (Zebris FDM 1.8). The assessment of postural stability was based on COP shift parameters (sway path length of COP and average velocity of COP) and COP surface area parameters (area of the ellipse, length of ellipse in the anterior-posterior direction and length of the ellipse in the medial-lateral direction). Body height was measured with Holtein anthropometer and the obtained values were compared with percentile ranks determined by the WHO. Results The analysis of the parameters describing postural stability in the examined children revealed dimorphism. For the COP shift parameters and COP surface area parameters, the level of statistical significance was recorded for girls and boys. Girls achieved lower results of these parameters than boys regardless of their body height. In the groups of normal- and tall-statured children, differences between the genders were statistically significant. Conclusions The present study characterised sex differences in postural stability of 5-year-old children. Sex-related differences were found during a natural stance for all COP parameters. Girls maintained a two-legged standing position with lower sway velocity and a smaller range of sway than their male counterparts. Normal- and tall-statured girls demonstrated better postural stability significantly more often than boys."
https://openalex.org/W2998250865,"Effective and safe practices during extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) including infection precautions and securement of lines (cannulas and circuits) are critical to prevent life-threatening patient complications, yet little is known about the practices of bedside clinicians and data to support best practice is lacking. Therefore, the aim of this study was to identify and describe common line-related practices for patients supported by peripheral ECMO worldwide and to highlight any gaps for further investigation. An electronic survey was conducted to examine common line practices for patients managed on peripheral ECMO. Responses were obtained from 45 countries with the majority from the United States (n = 181) and United Kingdom (n = 32). Standardised infection precautions including hand hygiene, maximal barrier precautions and skin antisepsis were commonplace for cannulation. The most common antisepsis strategies included alcohol-based chlorhexidine gluconate (CHG) for cannula insertion (53%) and maintenance (54%), isopropyl alcohol on circuit access ports (39%), and CHG-impregnated dressings to cover insertion sites (36%). Adverse patient events due to line malposition or dislodgement were reported by 34% of respondents with most attributable to ineffective securement. Centres 'always' suturing peripheral cannula sites were more likely to experience a cannula adverse event than centres that 'never' sutured (35% [95% CI 30, 41] vs 0% [95% CI 0, 28]; Chi-square 4.40; p = 0.04) but this did not meet the a priori significance level of <0.01. An evidence-based guideline would be beneficial to improve ECMO line management according to 78% of respondents. Evidence gaps were identified for antiseptic agents, dressing products and regimens, securement methods, and needleless valves. Future research addressing these areas may provide opportunities for consensus guideline development and practice improvement."
https://openalex.org/W2997487768,"The popularity of electronic cigarettes (E-cigarettes) has risen considerably. Several studies have suggested that nicotine may affect insulin resistance, however, the impact of E-cigarette exposure on insulin resistance, an early measure of cardiometabolic risk, is not known.Using experimental animals and human data obtained from 3,989 participants of the United States National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES), respectively, we assessed the association between E-cigarette and conventional cigarette exposures and insulin resistance, as modelled using the homeostatic model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) and glucose tolerance tests (GTT). C57BL6/J mice (on standard chow diet) exposed to E-cigarette aerosol or mainstream cigarette smoke (MCS) for 12 weeks showed HOMA-IR and GTT levels comparable with filtered air-exposed controls. In the NHANES cohort, there was no significant association between defined tobacco product use categories (non-users; sole E-cigarette users; cigarette smokers and dual users) and insulin resistance. Compared with non-users of e-cigarettes/conventional cigarettes, sole E-cigarette users showed no significant difference in HOMA-IR or GTT levels following adjustment for age, sex, race, physical activity, alcohol use and BMI.E-cigarettes do not appear to be linked with insulin resistance. Our findings may inform future studies assessing potential cardiometabolic harms associated with E-cigarette use."
https://openalex.org/W2998199451,"Successful hand-object interactions require precise hand-eye coordination with continual movement adjustments. Quantitative measurement of this visuomotor behaviour could provide valuable insight into upper limb impairments. The Gaze and Movement Assessment (GaMA) was developed to provide protocols for simultaneous motion capture and eye tracking during the administration of two functional tasks, along with data analysis methods to generate standard measures of visuomotor behaviour. The objective of this study was to investigate the reproducibility of the GaMA protocol across two independent groups of non-disabled participants, with different raters using different motion capture and eye tracking technology.Twenty non-disabled adults performed the Pasta Box Task and the Cup Transfer Task. Upper body and eye movements were recorded using motion capture and eye tracking, respectively. Measures of hand movement, angular joint kinematics, and eye gaze were compared to those from a different sample of twenty non-disabled adults who had previously performed the same protocol with different technology, rater and site.Participants took longer to perform the tasks versus those from the earlier study, although the relative time of each movement phase was similar. Measures that were dissimilar between the groups included hand distances travelled, hand trajectories, number of movement units, eye latencies, and peak angular velocities. Similarities included all hand velocity and grip aperture measures, eye fixations, and most peak joint angle and range of motion measures.The reproducibility of GaMA was confirmed by this study, despite a few differences introduced by learning effects, task demonstration variation, and limitations of the kinematic model. GaMA accurately quantifies the typical behaviours of a non-disabled population, producing precise quantitative measures of hand function, trunk and angular joint kinematics, and associated visuomotor behaviour. This work advances the consideration for use of GaMA in populations with upper limb sensorimotor impairment."
https://openalex.org/W2997579777,"Background Hepatitis B Virus (HBV) and Hepatitis C Virus (HCV) are the leading causes of liver-related morbidity and mortality throughout the world. The magnitude of HBV and HCV infections in Ethiopia has not been well studied at community level. This study aimed at investigating the sero-prevalence and associated risk factors of HBV and HCV among HBV unvaccinated community members in South Omo Zone, Southern Ethiopia. Methods A community-based cross-sectional study was conducted in three districts from March to May 2018. Structured questionnaire was used to collect relevant clinical and socio-demographic data. Three milliliter of blood sample was collected from each study participant and screened for HBV and HCV using one step hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) test strip and one step HCV test strip, respectively. Samples found positive for HBsAg were further tested using immunoassay of Alere DetermineTM HBsAg (Alere Inc., USA). Data were analyzed using SPSS version 25.0. Results A total of 625 (51.4% males, age 6–80 years, mean age ± SD = 30.83 ± 13.51 years) individuals participated in the study. The sero-prevalence for HBV infection was 8.0% as detected using one step HBsAg test strip, while it was 7.2% using Alere DetermineTM HBsAg test. The sero-prevalence for HCV infection was 1.9%. Two (0.3%) of the participants were seropositive for both HBV and HCV infections. High sero-prevalence for HBV infection was associated with weakness and fatigue (AOR = 5.20; 95% CI: 1.58, 17.15), while high sero-prevalence of HCV infection was associated with age group between 46 and 65 years (AOR = 13.02; 95% CI: 1.11, 152.41). Conclusion This study revealed higher-intermediate endemicity level of HBV infection and low to intermediate endemicity level of HCV infection in the study area. Clinical symptoms like weakness and fatigue were found to be indictors for HBV infection, while individuals in the age group between 46 and 65 years were at higher risk for HCV infection. Provision of community- based health education; vaccination, mass screening and providing treatment would have utmost importance in reducing the transmission of these diseases in the present study area."
https://openalex.org/W2998045348,"We hypothesized that heat-induced perturbations in cumulus cells surrounding the maturing oocyte may extend to the mural granulosa of the periovulatory follicle in the heat-stressed cow to subsequently the follicular fluid proteome. Lactating Holsteins were pharmacologically stimulated to have a dominant follicle that was capable of responding to a gonadotropin releasing hormone-induced luteinizing hormone surge. Following gonadotropin releasing hormone administration, cows were maintained at ~67 temperature humidity index (THI; thermoneutral conditions) or exposed to conditions simulating an acute heat stress event (71 to 86 THI; heat stress for ~12 h). Dominant follicle collection was conducted in the periovulatory period ~16 h after gonadotropin releasing hormone. Follicular fluid proteome from thermoneutral (n = 5) and hyperthermic (n = 5) cows was evaluated by quantitative tandem mass spectrometry (nano LC-MS/MS). We identified 35 differentially-abundant proteins. Functional annotation revealed numerous immune-related proteins. Subsequent efforts revealed an increase in levels of the proinflammatory mediator bradykinin in follicular fluid (P = 0.0456) but not in serum (P = 0.9319) of hyperthermic cows. Intrafollicular increases in transferrin (negative acute phase protein) in hyperthermic cows (P = 0.0181) coincided with a tendency for levels to be increased in the circulation (P = 0.0683). Nine out of 15 cytokines evaluated were detected in follicular fluid. Heat stress increased intrafollicular interleukin 6 levels (P = 0.0160). Whether hyperthermia-induced changes in the heat-stressed cow’s follicular fluid milieu reflect changes in mural granulosa, cumulus, other cell types secretions, and/or transudative changes from circulation remains unclear. Regardless of origin, heat stress/hyperthermia related changes in the follicular fluid milieu may have an impact on components important for ovulation and competence of the cumulus-oocyte complex contained within the periovulatory follicle."
https://openalex.org/W2998295178,"Background Well-advised priority setting in prevention and treatment of injuries relies on detailed insight into costs of injury. This study aimed to provide a detailed overview of medical and productivity costs due to injury up to two years post-injury and compare these costs across subgroups for injury severity and age. Methods A prospective longitudinal cohort study followed all adult (≥18 years) injury patients admitted to a hospital in Noord-Brabant, the Netherlands. Patients filled out questionnaires 1 week, 1, 3, 6, 12 and 24 months after trauma, including items on health care consumption from the medical consumption questionnaire (iMCQ) and productivity loss from the productivity cost questionnaire (PCQ). Furthermore, injury severity was defined by Injury Severity Score (ISS). Data on diagnostics was retrieved from hospital registries. We calculated medical costs, consisting of in-hospital costs and post-hospital medical costs, and productivity costs due to injury up to two years post-injury. Results Approximately 50% (N = 4883) of registered patients provided informed consent, and 3785 filled out at least one questionnaire. In total, the average costs per patient were €12,190. In-hospital costs, post-hospital medical costs and productivity costs contributed €4810, €5110 and €5830, respectively. Total costs per patient increased with injury severity, from €7030 in ISS1-3 to €23,750 in ISS16+ and were lowest for age category 18-24y (€7980), highest for age category 85 years and over (€15,580), and fluctuated over age groups in between. Conclusion Both medical costs and productivity costs generally increased with injury severity. Furthermore, productivity costs were found to be a large component of total costs of injury in ISS1-8 and are therefore a potentially interesting area with regard to reducing costs."
https://openalex.org/W2998098452,"Domestication is an evolutionary process during which we expect populations to progressively adapt to an environment controlled by humans. It is accompanied by genetic and presumably epigenetic changes potentially leading to modifications in the transcriptomic profile in various tissues. Reproduction is a key function often affected by this process in numerous species, regardless of the mechanism. The maternal mRNA in fish eggs is crucial for the proper embryogenesis. Our working hypothesis is that modifications of maternal mRNAs may reflect potential genetic and/or epigenetic modifications occurring during domestication and could have consequences during embryogenesis. Consequently, we investigated the trancriptomic profile of unfertilized eggs from two populations of Eurasian perch. These two populations differed by their domestication histories (F1 vs. F7+-at least seven generations of reproduction in captivity) and were genetically differentiated (FST = 0.1055, p<0.05). A broad follow up of the oogenesis progression failed to show significant differences during oogenesis between populations. However, the F1 population spawned earlier with embryos presenting an overall higher survivorship than those from the F7+ population. The transcriptomic profile of unfertilized eggs showed 358 differentially expressed genes between populations. In conclusion, our data suggests that the domestication process may influence the regulation of the maternal transcripts in fish eggs, which could in turn explain differences of developmental success."
https://openalex.org/W2997847849,"Bike-sharing systems (BSS) have widely spread over many cities in the world as an environmentally friendly means to reduce air pollution and traffic congestion. This paper focuses on the bike-sharing rebalancing problem (BRP), which consists of two aspects: determining desired demands at each station and designing routes to redistribute bikes among stations. For the first task, we firstly apply the random forest, a very efficient machine learning algorithm, to forecast desired demands for each station, which can be easily implemented with distributed computing. For the second task, it belongs to the broad class of the vehicle routing problem with pickup and delivery (VRPPD). In most existing settings, all of the demands being strictly satisfied can lead to longer routes and add operational costs. In this paper, we propose a new model with unserved demands by relaxing demands satisfying constraints. Then, we design a distributed ant colony optimization (ACO) based algorithm with some specific modifications to increase its efficiency for the proposed model. We propose to use the percentage of average cost saving per bike as a metric to evaluate the performance of our method on cost-reducing and compare with existing methods and best-known values. Computational results on benchmarks show the advantage of our approach. Finally, we provide a real case study of BSS in Hangzhou, China, with insightful elaborations."
https://openalex.org/W2997072707,"Mucor circinelloides is one of the causal agents of mucormycosis, an emerging and high mortality rate fungal infection produced by asexual spores (sporangiospores) of fungi that belong to the order Mucorales. M. circinelloides has served as a model genetic system to understand the virulence mechanism of this infection. Although the G-protein signaling cascade plays crucial roles in virulence in many pathogenic fungi, its roles in Mucorales are yet to be elucidated. Previous study found that sporangiospore size and calcineurin are related to the virulence in Mucor, in which larger spores are more virulent in an animal mucormycosis model and loss of a calcineurin A catalytic subunit CnaA results in larger spore production and virulent phenotype. The M. circinelloides genome is known to harbor twelve gpa (gpa1 to gpa12) encoding G-protein alpha subunits and the transcripts of the gpa11 and gpa12 comprise nearly 72% of all twelve gpa genes transcript in spores. In this study we demonstrated that loss of function of Gpa11 and Gpa12 led to larger spore size associated with reduced activation of the calcineurin pathway. Interestingly, we found lower levels of the cnaA mRNAs in sporangiospores from the Δgpa12 and double Δgpa11/Δgpa12 mutant strains compared to wild-type and the ΔcnaA mutant had significantly lower gpa11 and gpa12 mRNA levels compared to wild-type. However, in contrast to the high virulence showed by the large spores of ΔcnaA, the spores from Δgpa11/Δgpa12 were avirulent and produced lower tissue invasion and cellular damage, suggesting that the gpa11 and gpa12 define a signal pathway with two branches. One of the branches controls spore size through regulation of calcineurin pathway, whereas virulences is controlled by an independent pathway. This virulence-related regulatory pathway could control the expression of genes involved in cellular responses important for virulence, since sporangiospores of Δgpa11/Δgpa12 were less resistant to oxidative stress and phagocytosis by macrophages than the ΔcnaA and wild-type strains. The characterization of this pathway could contribute to decipher the signals and mechanism used by Mucorales to produce mucormycosis."

Epilepsy has a prevalence of 1% and is the fourth most common neurological disorder. While a number of anti-seizure drugs exist to treat seizures symptomatically, none is curative or preventive. This reflects a lack of understanding of disease progression. We used a novel systems approach to mine transcriptome profiles of rodent and human epileptic brain samples to identify regulators of transcriptional networks in the epileptic brain. We find that Enhancer of Zeste Homolog 2 (EZH2) regulates differentially expressed genes in epilepsy across multiple rodent models of acquired epilepsy. EZH2 undergoes a prolonged upregulation in the epileptic brain. A transient inhibition of EZH2 immediately after status epilepticus (SE) robustly increases spontaneous seizure burden weeks later. This suggests that EZH2 upregulation is a protective. These findings are the first to characterize a role for EZH2 in opposing epileptogenesis and debut a bioinformatic approach to identify nuclear drivers of complex transcriptional changes in disease."

Like other public health guidelines, they are often influenced by political and economic factors that could place other concerns ahead of the population's health. In order to determine their effectiveness on obesity prevention, we prospectively examined the association between adherence to the latest available national dietary guidelines and the incidence of overweight/obesity in a Spanish cohort study. A sample of 11,554 participants of the ""Seguimiento Universidad de Navarra"" (SUN) cohort, initially free of overweight or obesity, was included in the study. The Spanish Society of Community Nutrition (SENC) food pyramid (FP) score was computed based on the ratio of consumed to recommended daily servings of grains, fruits, vegetables, dairy, protein-rich foods, olive oil, red and processed meat, sweets, salty snacks and spreadable fats, fermented alcoholic beverages and water. The same approach was followed to calculate the SENC hydration pyramid (HP) score, considering the intake of water and different kind of beverages. Adherence was calculated at baseline and after 10 years of follow-up. Cox proportional hazards models were used to assess the incidence of overweight/obesity (BMI ≥25 kg/m2). During a median follow-up of 10.3 years, 2320 incident cases were identified. The highest level of adherence to the SENC FP score was modestly associated with a reduced risk of overweight/obesity (multivariable-adjusted HR for the fifth quintile vs. the first quintile = 0.78; 95% CI: 0.67-0.91; p-trend: 0.007). No consistent trends were found for the SENC HP. In a large prospective cohort of Spanish university graduates, we found an inverse linear association between adherence to the SENC FP and overweight/obesity risk, whereas this was not the case for the HP."
https://openalex.org/W2997733976,"An increasingly appreciated conundrum in the discovery of antibody drug conjugates (ADCs) is that an antibody that was selected primarily for strong binding to its cancer target may not serve as an optimal ADC. In this study, we performed mechanistic cell-based experiments to determine the correlation between antibody affinity, avidity, internalization and ADC efficacy. We used structure-guided design to assemble a panel of antibody mutants with predicted Her2 affinities ranging from higher to lower relative to the parent antibody, Herceptin. These antibodies were ranked for binding via SPR and via flow-cytometry on high-Her2 SKOV3 cells and low-Her2 MCF7 cells, the latter acting as a surrogate for low-Her2 normal cells. A subpanel of variants, representative of different Her2-binding affinities (2 strong, 2 moderate and 3 weak), were further screened via high-content imaging for internalization efficacies in high versus low-Her2 cells. Finally, these antibodies were evaluated in ADC cytotoxicity screening assays (using DM1 and MMAE secondary antibodies) and as antibody-drug conjugates (DM1 and PNU159682). Our results identified specific but weak Her2-binding variants as optimal candidates for developing DM1 and PNU ADCs since they exhibited high potencies (low to sub-nM) in high-Her2 SKOV3 cells and low toxicities in low-Her2 cells. The 2 strong-affinity variants were highly potent in SKOV3 cells but also showed significant toxicities in low-Her2 cells and therefore are predicted to be toxic in normal tissues. Our findings show that pharmacological profiling of an antibody library in multiple binding and functional assays allows for selection of optimal ADCs."
https://openalex.org/W2996846095,"Introduction Tuberculosis in children may be difficult to diagnose and is often not reported to routine surveillance systems. Understanding and addressing the tuberculosis (TB) case detection and reporting gaps strengthens national routine TB surveillance systems. Objective The present study aimed to measure the percentage of childhood TB cases that are diagnosed but not reported to the national surveillance system in Pakistan. Design The study design was cross sectional. The study was nationwide in 12 selected districts across Pakistan, each representing a cluster. Health facilities that diagnose and treat childhood TB from all sectors were mapped and invited to participate. Lists of child TB cases were created for the study period (April-June 2016) from all study facilities and compared against the list of child TB cases notified to the national TB surveillance system for the same districts and the same period. Results All public and private health facilities were mapped across 12 sampled districts in Pakistan and those providing health services to child TB cases were included in the study. From all private health facilities, 7,125 children were found with presumptive TB during the study period. Of them, 5,258 were diagnosed with tuberculosis: 11% were bacteriologically-confirmed and 89% clinically-diagnosed; only 4% were notified to National TB Control Program. An additional 1,267 children with TB were also registered in the National TB Control Program. Underreporting was measured to be 78%. Conclusion This is the first nationwide childhood TB inventory study globally and confirmed that childhood TB underreporting is very high in Pakistan. TB surveillance in the country must be strengthened to address this, with particular attention to guiding and supporting general practitioners and pediatricians to notify their TB cases."
https://openalex.org/W2997020264,"Introduction The pathophysiology of preeclampsia is largely unknown. Serum placental induced growth factor (PlGF) levels are decreased during second trimester pregnancy. Aberrant DNA methylation is suggested to be involved in the etiology of preeclampsia (PE). We hypothesize that DNA methylation is altered in PE placentas determined the methylation index by measuring placental S-adenosylmethionine (SAM) and S-adenosylhomocysteine (SAH) levels. In addition, we assessed global DNA methylation status by long-interspersed nuclear element-1 (LINE-1) and DNA methylation status of the PlGF gene. Methods Placental tissue of 11 early onset PE (EOPE), 11 late onset PE (LOPE) and 60 controls consisting of 25 uncomplicated controls 20 fetal growth restriction (FGR) and 15 preterm births (PTB) controls was collected from a nested case-control study of The Rotterdam Periconceptional Cohort. RNA and DNA was isolated from placental tissue and DNA was treated with sodium bisulfite. SAM and SAH levels were measured by LC-ESI-MS/MS. Methylation of LINE-1 and PlGF genes was analyzed by Sequenom Epityper and. mRNA expression of PlGF was assessed with qPCR. Differences were assessed by analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) corrected for gestational age and birth weight. Results Placental SAM levels were significantly lower in placental tissue of EOPE pregnancies compared to PTB controls (mean difference -240 ± 71.4 nmol/g protein, P = 0.01). PlGF DNA methylation was decreased in placental tissue of EOPE cases versus LOPE (mean difference -17.4 ± 5.1%, P = 0.01), uncomplicated controls (mean difference -23.4 ± 5.4%%, P <0.001), FGR controls (mean difference -17.9 ± 4.6%, P = 0.002) and PTB controls (mean difference -11.3 ± 3.8% P = 0.04). No significant differences were observed in SAH, SAM:SAH ratio, LINE-1 DNA methylation and PlGF mRNA expression between groups. Discussion The hypomethylation state of the placenta in EOPE, which is reflected by lower SAM and PlGF DNA hypomethylation underlines the possible role of placental DNA hypomethylation in the pathophysiology of EOPE, which needs further investigation."
https://openalex.org/W2997266130,"Fowl adenovirus (FAdV) is the causative agent of inclusion body hepatitis (IBH) in chickens with significant economic losses due to high mortality and poor production. It was objectives of the study to attenuate and determine the molecular characteristic of FAdV isolate (UPM1137) of Malaysia passages in primary chicken embryo liver (CEL) cells. The cytopathic effect (CPE) was recorded and the present of the virus was detected by polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Nucleotide and amino acid changes were determined and a phylogenetic tree was constructed. The pathogenicity and immunogenicity of the virus at passage 35 (CEL35) with virus titre of 106.7TCID50/mL was determined in day old specific pathogen free (SPF) chicks via oral or subcutaneous route of inoculation. The study demonstrated that the FAdV isolate was successfully propagated and attenuated in CEL cells up to 35th consecutive passages (CEL35) with delayed of CPE formation within 48 to 72 post inoculation (pi) from CEL20 onwards. The virus caused typical CPE with basophilic intranuclear inclusion bodies, refractile and clumping of cells. The virus is belong to serotype 8b with substitution of amino acid at position 44, 133 and 185 in L1 loop of hexon gene and in knob of fiber gene at position 348 and 360 at CEL35. It is non-pathogenic, but immunogenic in SPF chickens. It was concluded that the FAdV isolate was successfully attenuated in CEL cells with molecular changes in major capsid proteins which affect its infectivity in cell culture and SPF chickens."
https://openalex.org/W2997568193,"Biochemical markers for cold-induced sweetening (CIS) resistance were tested for their stability over years and their use in selection of parents for crossing to achieve high selection efficiency in potato breeding programs. Two regulatory enzymes directly associated with reducing sugar (RS) accumulation during potato tubers cold storage were tested as a predictor for CIS resistance. These enzymes were studied in 33 potato clones from various breeding programs over four years. Clones with the presence of A-II isozymes of UDP-glucose pyrophosphorylase (UGPase) and low activity of vacuolar acid invertase (VAcInv) enzyme had increased resistance to cold-induced sweetening (CIS). Depending on the levels of these enzymes, clones were divided into class A, class B and class C. Clones categorized as class A had average RS of 0.73 mg per g FW after six months at 5.5°C storage. Class B and C had average RS of 1.15 and 3.80 mg per g FW respectively. The enzyme activity was closely associated with RS accumulation over long-term cold storage. The biochemical markers were found to be stable over the years. Repeated-measure analysis showed 75% chance of maintaining class from one year to the next and a 25% chance of switching, No clone switched between class A and class C, even across all four years. Application of these biochemical markers can identify clones with CIS resistance early in the selection process. Biochemical markers were used to select parents for crossing and six families were established. Results showed that with both parents from class A, 95% of their offspring had desirable glucose levels and chip color, which dropped to 52% when one parent was from class A and other from class B. These results suggest that two regulatory enzymes, i.e., UGPase and VAcInv, can be used as stable prognostic biochemical markers for CIS resistance for precise parent selection resulting in progenies with significantly higher percentage of clones with acceptable processing quality."
https://openalex.org/W2997605000,"Chronic cough is a distressing symptom and a common reason for people to seek health care services. It is a symptom that can indicate underlying tuberculosis (TB) and/or chronic airways diseases (CAD) including asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and bronchiectasis. In developing countries including Malawi, provision of diagnostic services and clinical management of CAD is rudimentary, so it is thought that patients make costly and unyielding repeated care-seeking visits. There is, however, a lack of information on cost of illness, both direct and indirect, to patients with chronic cough symptom. Such data are needed to inform policy-makers in making decisions on allocating resources for designing and developing the relevant health care services to address universal coverage programmes for CAD. This paper therefore explores health seeking costs associated with chronic cough and explores information on usage of the coping mechanisms which indicate financial hardship, such as borrowing and selling household assets.This economic study was nested within a community-based, population-proportional cross-sectional survey of 15,795 individuals aged 15 years and above, in Dowa and Ntchisi districts. The study sought to identify individuals with symptoms of chronic airways disease whose health records documented at least one of the following diagnoses within the previous year: TB, Asthma, COPD, Bronchitis and Lower Respiratory Tract Infection (LRTI). We interviewed these chronic coughers to collect information on socioeconomic and socio-demographic characteristics, health care utilization, and associated costs of care in 2015. We also collected information on how they funded their health seeking costs.We identified 608 chronic coughers who reported costs in relation to their latest confirmed diagnosis in their hand-held health record. The mean care-seeking cost per patient was US$ 3.9 (95% CI: 3.00-5.03); 2.3 times the average per capita expenditure on health of US$ 1.69. The largest costs were due to transport (US$ 1.4), followed by drugs (US$ 1.3). The costs of non-medical inputs (US$ 2.09) was considerable (52.3%). Nearly a quarter (24.4%) of all the patients reportedly borrowed or/and sold assets/property to finance their healthcare. CCs with COPD and LRTI had 85.6% and 62.0% lower chance of incurring any costs compared with the TB patients and any patients with comorbidity had 2.9 times higher chance to incur any costs than the patients with single disease. COPD, Bronchitis and LRTI patients had 123.9%, 211.4% and 87.9% lower costs than the patients with TB. The patients with comorbidity incurred 53.9% higher costs than those with single disease.The costs of healthcare per chronic cougher was mainly influenced by the transport and drugs costs. Types of diseases and comorbidity led to significantly different chances of incurring costs as well as difference in magnitude of costs. The costs appeared to be unaffordable for many patients."
https://openalex.org/W2998225261,"Children's well-being is highly influenced by their fetal growth. Adequate intrauterine growth (IUG) is a basic feature of a healthy pregnancy. The aim of our study was to assess IUG patterns in a rural and drought-affected population in the Rift Valley area of the Adami Tullu district in Oromia, Ethiopia.We conducted a longitudinal, community-based study of IUG patterns utilizing serial ultrasound measurements. Data were collected for 17 months, from July 2016 to November 2017. We included 675 singleton foetuses ≤ 24 weeks old, based on ultrasound-derived estimates of gestational age, and followed them until delivery. We obtained head circumference, biparietal diameter, abdominal circumference, femur length, and estimated fetal weight at 26, 30, and 36 weeks. Fetal weight was estimated using the Hadlock algorithm, and the 5th, 10th, 25th, 50th, 75th, 90th, and 95th centiles were developed from this model. We compared the biometric measurements and fetal weight data from our study to the World Health Organization (WHO) and INTERGROWTH-21st fetal growth reference standards.Distribution of the biometric measurements and estimated fetal weights in our study were similar to those for the WHO and INTERGROWTH-21st references. Most measurements were between -2 and +2 of the reference z-scores. Based on the smoothed percentiles, the 5th, 50th, and 95th percentiles of our study had similar distribution patterns to the WHO chart, and the 50th percentile had a similar pattern to the INTERGROWTH-21st chart.Our study determined fetal growth patterns in a drought-affected rural community of Ethiopia using common ultrasound biometric measurements. We found similar IUG patterns to those indicated in the WHO and INTERGROWTH-21st fetal growth reference standards."
https://openalex.org/W2997073046,"Prompt clinical diagnosis and initiation of treatment are critical in the management of infectious endophthalmitis. Current methods used to identify causative agents of infectious endophthalmitis are mostly inefficient, owing to suboptimal sensitivity, length, and cost. Matrix Assisted Laser Desorption-Ionization Time-of-Flight Mass Spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS) can be used to rapidly identity pathogens without a need for culture. Similarly, automated antimicrobial susceptibility test systems (AST, VITEK 2) provide accurate antimicrobial susceptibility profiles. In this proof-of-concept study, we apply these technologies for the direct identification and characterization of pathogens in vitreous samples, without culture, as an in vitro model of infectious endophthalmitis.Vitreous humor aspirated from freshly enucleated porcine eyes was inoculated with different inocula of Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus) and incubated at 37°C. Vitreous endophthalmitis samples were centrifuged and pellets were directly analyzed with MALDI-TOF MS and VITEK 2 without prior culture. S. aureus colonies that were conventionally grown on culture medium were used as control samples. Time-to-identification, minimum concentration of bacteria required for identification, and accuracy of results compared to standard methods were determined.MALDI-TOF MS achieved accurate pathogen identification from direct analysis of intraocular samples with confidence values of up to 99.9%. Time from sample processing to pathogen identification was <30 minutes. The minimum number of bacteria needed for positive identification was 7.889x106 colony forming units (cfu/μl). Direct analysis of intraocular samples with VITEK 2 gave AST profiles that were up to 94.4% identical to the positive control S. aureus analyzed per standard protocol.Our findings demonstrate that the direct analysis of vitreous samples with MALDI-TOF MS and VITEK 2 without prior culture could serve as new, improved methods for rapid, accurate pathogen identification and targeted treatment design in infectious endophthalmitis. In vivo models and standardized comparisons against other microbiological methods are needed to determine the value of direct analysis of intraocular samples from infectious endophthalmitis with MALDI-TOF MS and VITEK 2."
https://openalex.org/W2997492648,"The endocannabinoid system modulates coronary circulatory function and atherogenesis. The two major endocannabinoids (eCB), 2-arachidonoylglycerol (2-AG) and N-arachidonoylethanolamide (AEA), are increased in venous blood from patients with coronary artery disease (CAD). However, given their short half-life and their autocrine/paracrine mechanism of action, eCB levels in venous blood samples might not reflect arterial or coronary eCB concentrations. The aim of this cross-sectional study was to identify the local concentration profile of eCB and to detect whether and how this concentration profile changes in CAD and NSTEMI versus patients without CAD.83 patients undergoing coronary angiography were included in this study. Patients were divided into three groups based on their definite diagnosis of a) no CAD, b) stable CAD, or c) non-ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI). Blood was drawn from the arterial sheath and the aorta in all patients and additionally distal to the culprit coronary lesion in CAD- and NSTEMI patients. 2-AG levels varied significantly between patient groups and between the sites of blood extraction. The lowest levels were detected in patients without CAD; the highest 2-AG concentrations were detected in NSTEMI patients and in the coronary arteries. Peripheral 2-AG levels were significantly higher in NSTEMI patients (107.4 ± 28.4 pmol/ml) than in CAD- (17.4 ± 5.4 pmol/ml; p < 0.001), or no-CAD patients (23.9 ± 7.1 pmol/ml; p < 0.001). Moreover, coronary 2-AG levels were significantly higher in NSTEMI patients than in CAD patients (369.3 ± 57.2 pmol/ml vs. 240.1 ± 25.3 pmol/ml; p = 0.024).2-AG showed significant variability in arterial blood samples drawn from distinct locations. Possibly, lesional macrophages synthesise 2-AG locally, which thereby contributes to endothelial dysfunction and local inflammation."
https://openalex.org/W2997557907,"Conservation practitioners are increasingly looking to species translocations as a tool to recover imperiled taxa. Quantitative predictions of where animals are likely to move when released into new areas would allow managers to better address the social, institutional, and ecological dimensions of conservation translocations. Using >5 million California condor (Gymnogyps californianus) occurrence locations from 75 individuals, we developed and tested circuit-based models to predict condor movement away from release sites. We found that circuit-based models of electrical current were well calibrated to the distribution of condor movement data in southern and central California (continuous Boyce Index = 0.86 and 0.98, respectively). Model calibration was improved in southern California when additional nodes were added to the circuit to account for nesting and feeding areas, where condor movement densities were higher (continuous Boyce Index = 0.95). Circuit-based projections of electrical current around a proposed release site in northern California comported with the condor's historical distribution and revealed that, initially, condor movements would likely be most concentrated in northwestern California and southwest Oregon. Landscape linkage maps, which incorporate information on landscape resistance, complement circuit-based models and aid in the identification of specific avenues for population connectivity or areas where movement between populations may be constrained. We found landscape linkages in the Coast Range and the Sierra Nevada provided the most connectivity to a proposed reintroduction site in northern California. Our methods are applicable to conservation translocations for other species and are flexible, allowing researchers to develop multiple competing hypotheses when there are uncertainties about landscape or social attractants, or uncertainties in the landscape conductance surface."
https://openalex.org/W2998227971,"Predator-prey relations, as well as the trophic ecology of highly migratory marine species, is important to understand their impact on the ecosystem. Conventional methods were used to study the diet composition and feeding strategy of the Northeast Atlantic mackerel (Scombrus scomber), during their summer feeding migration to Icelandic waters in 2009–2014. In addition, generalised additive modelling (GAM) was used to determine which biological and environmental factors contribute to the variation of their stomach weight in the years 2011–2014. From the dietary analysis, we found that calanoid copepods (especially Calanus finmarchicus) were the most important contributor to the overall diet of mackerel in the years studied. Although in some years and areas, they also preyed heavily on larger prey items such as euphausiids, amphipods and megalopa larvae of crab and shrimp. The GAM showed that temperature and the time the day of sampling were significant explanatory variables for the stomach weight, while zooplankton biomass did not seem to have much influence. The Northeast Atlantic mackerel are ferocious feeders upon copepods, as well as exhibiting an overall opportunistic feeding strategy. During their feeding migration in Icelandic waters, they were found to feed on the most dominant species available to them."
https://openalex.org/W2998450966,"Generosity is a human behavior common in social contexts. However, humans are not equally generous to everyone alike. Instead, generosity decreases as a function of social distance, an effect called social discounting. Studies show that such social discounting effect depends on diverse factors including personality traits, cultures, stress or hormonal levels. Recently, the importance of the neurotransmitter dopamine in regulating social interactions has been highlighted. However, it remains unclear how exactly dopamine agonist administration modulates generous behavior as a function of social discounting. Here, we investigate the causal effect of dopamine agonist administration on social discounting in a pharmacological intervention study. We employ a randomized, double-blind, within-subject design to investigate the impact of the D2/D3 receptor agonist pramipexole on social discounting by keeping gender constant. We apply hyperbolic social discount model to the data and provide evidence that women under pramipexole become less generous in general, especially towards close others. Our results highlight the crucial role of dopamine in social decision making."
https://openalex.org/W2998642808,"Malayan krait (Bungarus candidus) is a medically important snake species found in Southeast Asia. The neurotoxic effects of envenoming present as flaccid paralysis of skeletal muscles. It is unclear whether geographical variation in venom composition plays a significant role in the degree of clinical neurotoxicity. In this study, the effects of geographical variation on neurotoxicity and venom composition of B. candidus venoms from Indonesia, Malaysia and Thailand were examined. In the chick biventer cervicis nerve-muscle preparation, all venoms abolished indirect twitches and attenuated contractile responses to nicotinic receptor agonists, with venom from Indonesia displaying the most rapid neurotoxicity. A proteomic analysis indicated that three finger toxins (3FTx), phospholipase A2 (PLA2) and Kunitz-type serine protease inhibitors were common toxin groups in the venoms. In addition, venom from Thailand contained L-amino acid oxidase (LAAO), cysteine rich secretory protein (CRISP), thrombin-like enzyme (TLE) and snake venom metalloproteinase (SVMP). Short-chain post-synaptic neurotoxins were not detected in any of the venoms. The largest quantity of long-chain post-synaptic neurotoxins and non-conventional toxins was found in the venom from Thailand. Analysis of PLA2 activity did not show any correlation between the amount of PLA2 and the degree of neurotoxicity of the venoms. Our study shows that variation in venom composition is not limited to the degree of neurotoxicity. This investigation provides additional insights into the geographical differences in venom composition and provides information that could be used to improve the management of Malayan krait envenoming in Southeast Asia."

These items are often referred to as amalgams of silver, and take the form of shivlings, statues of gods, necklaces, and other jewelry. Fourteen parad items were purchased from online vendors in India and the United States and analyzed. All items produced copious amounts of Hg0 vapor, with Hg0 concentrations exceeding 1,000,000 ng/m3 as measured using a Mercury Instruments Mercury Tracker 3000 IP atomic absorption spectrometer. Measured concentrations were highly variable, so a simple qualitative experiment employing a UV-C light source and a thin-layer chromatography plate impregnated with a fluorescent dye that glows green when irradiated at 254 nm allowed for the indirect visualization of the Hg0 being evolved. In addition, all items were screened using a hand-held X-ray fluorescence analyzer to estimate the concentration of Hg, Sn, Pb, As, and Cd on the surface of the item. Select samples were then digested in aqua regia and analyzed for Hg content using a direct mercury analyzer. All samples were found to exceed 20% by mass Hg. The digestates were analyzed using inductively-coupled plasma–optical emission spectrometry and were determined to be between 10–55% by mass Pb and contain up to 0.3% by mass As. While Article 4 of the Minamata Convention on Mercury specifically requires parties to stop importing, exporting, and manufacturing Hg-added products, products used in traditional and religious practices are excluded."
https://openalex.org/W2997986817,"Assessing population trends and their underlying factors is critical to propose efficient conservation actions. This assessment can be particularly challenging when dealing with highly mobile, shy and nocturnal animals such as flying-foxes. Here we investigated the dynamics of hunted populations of Pteropus ornatus and P. tonganus in the Northern Province of New Caledonia. First, an ethno-ecological survey involving 219 local experts identified 494 flying-fox roosts. Current status was assessed for 379 of them, among which 125 were no longer occupied, representing a loss of 33% over ca. 40 years. Second, species-specific counts conducted at 35 roosts, and a sample of animals killed by hunters, revealed that the endemic species, P. ornatus, was dominant (68.5%). Between 2010 and 2016, 30 roosts were counted annually during the pre-parturition period. Roosts size averaged 1,425 ± 2,151 individuals (N = 180 counts) and showed high among-year variations (roost-specific CV = 37-162%). If we recorded significant inter-annual variation, we did not detect a significant decline over the 7-yr period, although one roost went possibly extinct. Population size of the two species combined was estimated at 338,000-859,000 individuals distributed over ca. 400 roosts in the Northern Province. Flying-foxes are popular game species and constitute traditional food for all communities of New Caledonia. Annual bags derived from a food survey allowed us to estimate harvesting rates at 5-14%. Such a level of harvesting for species with a 'slow' demography, the occurrence of poaching and illegal trade, suggest the current species use might not be sustainable and further investigations are critically needed."
https://openalex.org/W2998090282,"Pupillometry have recently added valuable insights about the cognitive and possible neurobiological processes underlying episodic memory. Most of the studies, however, investigated recognition memory, which only partially relies on cue-driven recollection, the hallmark feature of episodic memory. Here we measured pupil size during a paired associate learning task, where participants encoded word-pairs, and after a short delay they took part in a cued recall. Importantly, we manipulated the size of the learning set: participants either learnt two, four or eight word-pairs in a row. As expected, increasing set size resulted in larger forgetting, assumingly as a consequence of weaker memory strength for the word-pairs. Our results show an important difference between pupil size changes observed during encoding and retrieval. During retrieval, the pupil instantly begun to dilate, as a sign of increased processing load accompanying the retrieval of the target memory. Importantly, large set size was also associated with larger pupil dilation during retrieval. This supports the notion that pupil dilation can be regarded as a marker of memory strength. In contrast, during encoding, pupil dilation decreased with increasing amount of encoded information, which might be due to the overuse of attentional resources. Furthermore, we also found that serial position during encoding modulated subsequent memory effects: for the first three serial positions, successful recall was predicted by larger pupil dilation during encoding, whereas such subsequent memory effect was absent for later serial positions. These results suggest that the amount of information independently modulates pupil dilation during encoding and retrieval, and support the assumption that pupillometric investigation of paired associate learning could be an informative way to investigate the cognitive and neurobiological processes of episodic memory."
https://openalex.org/W2996897709,"Loss of habitat, specifically deforestation, is a major driver of biodiversity loss. Species-area relationship (SAR) models traditionally have been used for estimating species richness, species loss as a function of habitat loss, and extrapolation of richness for given areas. Sampling-species relationships (SSRs) are interrelated yet separate drivers for species richness estimates. Traditionally, however, SAR and SSR models have been used independently and not incorporated into a single approach. We developed and compared predictive models that incorporate sampling effort species-area relationships (SESARS) along the entire Atlantic Forest of South America, and then applied the best-fit model to estimate richness in forest remnants of Interior Atlantic Forest of eastern Paraguay. This framework was applied to non-volant small mammal assemblages that reflect different tolerances to forest loss and fragmentation. In order to account for differences in functionality we estimated small mammal richness of 1) the entire non-volant small mammal assemblage, including introduced species; 2) the native species forest assemblage; and 3) the forest-specialist assemblage, with the latter two assemblages being subsets of the entire assemblage. Finally, we geospatially modeled species richness for each of the three assemblages throughout eastern Paraguay to identify remnants with high species richness. We found that multiple regression power-law interaction-term models that only included area and the interactions of area and sampling as predictors, worked best for predicting species richness for the entire assemblage and the native species forest assemblage, while several traditional SAR models (logistic, power, exponential, and ratio) best described forest-specialist richness. Species richness was significantly different between assemblages. We identified obvious remnants with high species richness in eastern Paraguay, and these remnants often were geographically isolated. We also found relatively high predicted species richness (in relation to the entire range of predicted richness values) in several geographically-isolated, medium-size forest remnants that likely have not been considered as possible priority areas for conservation. These findings highlight the importance of using an empirical dataset, created using sources representing diverse sampling efforts, to develop robust predictive models. This approach is particularly important in geographic locations where field sampling is limited yet the geographic area is experiencing rapid and dramatic land cover changes. When combined, area and sampling are powerful modeling predictors for questions of biogeography, ecology, and conservation, especially when addressing habitat loss and fragmentation."

The remainder activated basal ganglia and anterior insulae during a cognitive task (STOPP: Stress Test Originated Phantom Perception). Here, the role of attention in cognitive dysfunction was assessed by seed region correlations during a simple 0-back stimulus matching task (""see a letter, push a button"") performed before exercise. Analysis was analogous to resting state, but different from psychophysiological interactions (PPI). The patterns of correlations between nodes in task and default networks were significantly different for START (n = 9), STOPP (n = 18) and control (n = 8) subjects. Edges shared by the 3 groups may represent co-activation caused by the 0-back task. Controls had a task network of right dorsolateral and left ventrolateral prefrontal cortex, dorsal anterior cingulate cortex, posterior insulae and frontal eye fields (dorsal attention network). START had a large task module centered on the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex with direct links to basal ganglia, anterior insulae, and right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex nodes, and through dorsal attention network (intraparietal sulci and frontal eye fields) nodes to a default module. STOPP had 2 task submodules of basal ganglia-anterior insulae, and dorsolateral prefrontal executive control regions. Dorsal attention and posterior insulae nodes were embedded in the default module and were distant from the task networks. These three unique connectivity patterns during an attention task support the concept of Gulf War Disease with recognizable, objective patterns of cognitive dysfunction."
https://openalex.org/W2997262233,"High efficiency video coding screen content coding (HEVC-SCC) extension is the latest HEVC development to improve the compression performance of screen content (SC) video. Similar to HEVC, the intra mode selection in HEVC-SCC is performed all the coding unit (CU) partitions to find the least rate distortion (RD) cost. Furthermore, additional intra tools are introduced to improve HEVC-SCC coding efficiency. However, these new tools could cause high computation complexity which restricts HEVC-SCC from ongoing applications. To solve the problem, an efficient intra mode decision for HEVC-SCC that adaptively utilizes the texture complexity of SC treeblock is proposed. The texture complexity of a SC treeblock is first analyzed according to the variation degree of the luminance value. And then, two efficient approaches are proposed based on the constructed model, which are early CU depth level determination and adaptive intra mode selection. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method can save 48.5% encoder runtime while keeping nearly the same coding efficiency as the HEVC-SCC encoders."
https://openalex.org/W2997767683,"Tankyrase (TNKS) 1/2 are positive regulators of WNT signaling by controlling the activity of the ß-catenin destruction complex. TNKS inhibitors provide an opportunity to suppress hyperactive WNT signaling in tumors, however, they have shown limited anti-proliferative activity as a monotherapy in human cancer cell lines. Here we perform a kinome-focused CRISPR screen to identify potential effective drug combinations with TNKS inhibition. We show that the loss of CDK4, but not CDK6, synergizes with TNKS1/2 blockade to drive G1 cell cycle arrest and senescence. Through precise modelling of cancer-associated mutations using cytidine base editors, we show that this therapeutic approach is absolutely dependent on suppression of canonical WNT signaling by TNKS inhibitors and is effective in cells from multiple epithelial cancer types. Together, our results suggest that combined WNT and CDK4 inhibition might provide a potential therapeutic strategy for difficult-to-treat epithelial tumors."
https://openalex.org/W2998224474,"Introduction Domiciliary High-flow, humidified, nasal cannula (HFNC) is a possible add-on in patients with chronic respiratory diseases. This post-hoc study investigates benefit of HFNC in subgroups of advanced COPD patients with chronic hypoxic failure on reduction of exacerbations and hospitalizations. Methods One hundred patients were randomized to HFNC in a previous trial. Subgroups with 0–1 (N = 32) respectively two or more (2+) (N = 68) exacerbations 12 months pre-study were investigated. Changes in number of exacerbations and hospitalizations pre- and in study were analyzed, corrected for HFNC days with HFNC. Results Patients were comparable at baseline. Exacerbations increased in subgroup 0–1 (p = 0.01) and decreased in subgroup 2+ (p = 0.03). Correcting for HFNC days no correlation was seen in subgroup 0–1 (p = 0.08), but in subgroup 2+ (p<0.001). Number of hospitalizations increased in subgroup 0–1 (p = 0.01) with no change in days of hospitalization (p = 0.08). Number and days of hospitalization decreased in subgroup 2+ (p = 0.002 resp. 0.025). Correcting for HFNC days no correlation was found in number or days of hospitalization in subgroup 0–1 (p = 0.48 and p = 0.65). Positive correlation was found in subgroup 2+ (both p<0.001). Conclusion In patients with advanced COPD, chronic hypoxic failure and two or more exacerbations per year, HFNC significantly reduced exacerbations and hospitalizations."
https://openalex.org/W2996888846,"Gene effects on osteoporosis have been studied separately and may have been masked by gene–gene and gene–environment interactions. We evaluated gene–gene and gene–physical activity interactions of the variants of tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) and vitamin D receptor (VDR) genes on osteoporosis. A total of 472 elders were included. Seven variants (TNF-α: rs1799964, rs1800629, rs3093662; VDR: rs7975232, rs1544410, rs2239185, rs3782905) were genotyped. Bone mineral densities of the lumbar spine, femoral neck, and total hip were measured by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry. Predictive models’ ability to discriminate osteoporosis status was evaluated by areas under the receiver operating characteristics (AUROC) curve. After multivariable adjustment, significant interactions of TNF-α rs1800629 and VDR rs3782905 were observed on overall and lumbar spine osteoporosis. In elderly women, we found that those carrying the CG/CC genotype of VDR rs3782905 were significantly associated with increased odds of overall osteoporosis compared with those carrying the GG genotype of VDR rs3782905 among those carrying TNF-α rs1800629 GG genotype. The adjusted odds ratios (ORs) for VDR rs3782905 CG/CC genotype in elderly women carrying TNF-α rs1800629 AG/AA and GG genotypes were 0.1 (0.01, 0.98) and 3.54 (1.51, 8.30), respectively. We observed significant differences in AUROCs between the model with traditional covariates plus variants and their interaction term and the model with traditional covariates only (AUROCs: 0.77 and 0.81; p = 0.028). Although the sample size of this study may have been relatively small, our results suggest that the interaction of the CG/CC genotype of VDR rs3782905 with TNF-α rs1800629 GG genotype was associated with increased odds of overall and lumbar spine osteoporosis in elderly women."
https://openalex.org/W2997017908,"Background The prognostic role of BDNF val66met polymorphism on long-term cardiac outcomes in acute coronary syndrome (ACS) has been unclear. Environmental factors may modify the association, but these have not been investigated to date. This study aimed to investigate the potential interactive effects of BDNF val66met polymorphism and personality traits, one of the main environmental prognostic factors of ACS, on major adverse cardiac events (MACEs) in patients with ACS. Methods A total of 611 patients with recent ACS were recruited at a university hospital in Korea. Baseline evaluations from 2007 to 2012 assessed BDNF val66met polymorphism and personality using the Big Five Inventory, which yielded two personality clusters (resilient and vulnerable) and five dimensions (extraversion, agreeableness, conscientiousness, neuroticism, and openness). Over a 5~12 year follow-up after the index ACS, times to MACE were investigated using Cox regression models after adjustment for a range of covariates. Results The BDNF val66met polymorphism modified the associations between vulnerable personality type and worse long-term cardiac outcomes in ACS patients with significant interaction terms, in that the associations were statistically significant in the presence met allele. Similar findings were observed for the individual personality dimensions of agreeableness and neuroticism. Conclusions Gene (BDNF val66met polymorphism) x environment (personality traits) interactions on long-term cardiac outcomes were found in ACS."
https://openalex.org/W2997520606,"We have developed a unified, versatile vector set for expression of recombinant proteins, fit for use in any bacterial, yeast, insect or mammalian cell host. The advantage of this system is its versatility at the vector level, achieved by the introduction of a novel expression cassette. This cassette contains a unified multi-cloning site, affinity tags, protease cleavable linkers, an optional secretion signal, and common restriction endonuclease sites at key positions. This way, genes of interest and all elements of the cassette can be switched freely among the vectors, using restriction digestion and ligation without the need of polymerase chain reaction (PCR). This vector set allows rapid protein expression screening of various hosts and affinity tags. The reason behind this approach was that it is difficult to predict which expression host and which affinity tag will lead to functional expression. The new system is based on four optimized and frequently used expression systems (Escherichia coli pET, the yeast Pichia pastoris, pVL and pIEx for Spodoptera frugiperda insect cells and pLEXm based mammalian systems), which were modified as described above. The resulting vector set was named pONE series. We have successfully applied the pONE vector set for expression of the following human proteins: the tumour suppressor RASSF1A and the protein kinases Aurora A and LIMK1. Finally, we used it to express the large multidomain protein, Rho-associated protein kinase 2 (ROCK2, 164 kDa) and demonstrated that the yeast Pichia pastoris reproducibly expresses the large ROCK2 kinase with identical activity to the insect cell produced counterpart. To our knowledge this is among the largest proteins ever expressed in yeast. This demonstrates that the cost-effective yeast system can match and replace the industry-standard insect cell expression system even for large and complex mammalian proteins. These experiments demonstrate the applicability of our pONE vector set."
https://openalex.org/W2998183444,"Background Physicians and nurses play vital roles in addressing palliative care (PC) needs of people living with HIV/AIDS (PLWHA). The healthcare workers’ (HCWs) experiences determine the success of palliative care delivery. There is paucity of data on PC for PLWHA. For this reason, we assessed the knowledge, attitude and practice of PC for PLWHA and associated factors among health care professionals. Methods We conducted a cross-sectional descriptive study among HCWs in public health facilities in the Federal Capital Territory, Nigeria between February and May, 2017. Multistage sampling technique with proportionate-to-size allocation was used to determine facility sample size and HCWs per professional discipline. Data were collected with questionnaires adapted from Palliative Care Quiz for Nursing, Frommelt Attitude toward Care of the Dying and practical questions adapted from PC standard guidelines. Participants' knowledge, attitude and practice were assessed by awarding one (1) point for each correct answer; incorrect or “not sure” answers took a zero (0) score. Correct responses were summed up to get a total score for each participant. Descriptive statistics was done to describe frequencies and proportions displayed on tables. Linear regression was done to determine factors associated with HCW’s knowledge, attitude and practice of PC for PLWHA Result With a 100% response rate, the mean age of the 348 participants was 37.5 years (SD: ±8.9), 201 (57.8%) were female, 222 (63.8) were nurses and 230 (66.0%) had a work experience of 10 years or less. Majority of the participants, 310 (89.1%) agreed that palliative care focuses on the relief and prevention of suffering and 319 (91.7%) believe that PLWHA required palliative care. Misconceptions about palliative care include “palliative care is disease-oriented and not person oriented”, 252 (72.6%) believed; “palliative care is concerned with prolongation of life”, 279 (80.6%); and “use of placebos is appropriate in the treatment of some types of pain”, 252 (72.6%). Among the participants, 52% disagreed that “palliative care should be given only for dying PLWHA” while only 18 (5.2%) were right on “family should be involved in the physical care of the dying PLWHA”. Majority of the participants, 292 (84.1%) initiated palliative care discussion during patients’ diagnosis while 290 (83.6%) informed terminally ill patients about their diagnosis. Regarding psychological issues, 22 (6.3%) participants hid the truth from the patients while 196 (56.3%) provided emotional support to the patients. Morphine 240 (69.0%) and Pentazocine 194 (55.7%) were the most commonly used drugs for treatment of severe pain by participants across all centres. Conclusion In-service training and undergraduate training on palliative care were associated with knowledge and practice of palliative care for people living with HIV/AIDS. We recommended continuous quality in-service training and education on palliative care for HCWs. While we ensure voluntariness of participation and other ethical principles, the high response rate could be as a result of more motivated health worker than the norm. The results are unlikely to be representative of doctors and nurses in primary health care centres."
https://openalex.org/W2996859436,"We aimed to demonstrate a single institution experience of treatment of pancreatic ductal carcinoma and to identify the role of radiation therapy. We assessed all patients who were diagnosed with pancreatic ductal carcinoma from January 2011 to December 2017. A total of 342 patients were enrolled. Thirteen, 131, 36, and 162 patients had stage I, II, III, and IV disease, respectively (UICC TNM, 7th edition). Among the patients with stages I-III disease, 94 underwent surgery, and the median overall survival (OS) was 33 months. Of patients with stages I-III disease who were not suitable for surgery, 58 patients received chemotherapy, and the median OS was 12 months. Among them, 17 patients received chemoradiotherapy added on chemotherapy and their OS was significantly better than that of patients who received chemotherapy alone. Of patients with stage IV disease, 111 received chemotherapy, and the median OS was 6 months. This study evaluated the demand, role, and outcome of each treatment modality and demonstrated a single institution experience of treatment of pancreatic ductal carcinoma. The demand and role of radiation therapy remained small; however, radiation therapy might have some importance as a local treatment."
