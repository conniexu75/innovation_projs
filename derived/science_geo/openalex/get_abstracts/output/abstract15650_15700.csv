https://openalex.org/W2021124272,"Chimeric rats were produced by the aggregation of embryos of the pink-eyed, retinal dystrophic RCS strain with those of pigmented, normal rats. In the mosaic eyes, patches of neural retina with abnormal and degenerated photoreceptors were present only opposite patches of nonpigmented, mutant pigment epithelium. This indicates that the retinal dystrophy gene acts in the pigment epithelial cell rather than in the photoreceptor cell."

https://openalex.org/W1533225291,"The glycoprotein which accounts for approximately 50% of the protein and all of the nonlipid carbohydrate of the cell envelope of Halobacterium salinarium (Mescher, M. F., Strominger, J. L., and Watson S. W. (1974) J. Bacteriol. 120, 945-954) has been purified and partially characterized. The glycoprotein has an apparent molecular weight of 200,000, is extremely acidic, and has a carbohydrate content of approximately 10 to 12%. The carbohydrate included neutral hexoses, amino sugar, and uronic acid. Information regarding the number, composition, and mode of attachment of the carbohydrate chains was obtained by isolation and examination of the glycopeptides derived from degradation of cell envelope protein with trypsin and pronase. Trypsin digestion resulted in two glycopeptides. One of these was large (approximately 55,000 daltons) and had most of the neutral hexose linked to it. The carbohydrate moieties consisted of di- and trisaccharides of glucosylgalactose and (uronic acid, glucose)-galactose attached via O-glycosidic linkages between galactose and threonine. The other tryptic glycopeptide had a relatively large heterosaccharide attached to it via an alkaline-stable linkage. The heterosaccharide contained 1 glucose, 8 to 9 galactose, 1 mannose, and 10 to 11 glucosamine residues, and approximately 6 residues of an unidentified amino augar. The alkaline stability of the linkage and the amino acid composition of glycopeptides resulting from Pronase digestion of the tryptic glycopeptide showed that the heterosaccharide was attached to an asparagine residue, presumably via an N-glycosylamine bond to the amide group. The intact glycoprotein has a single N-linked heterosaccharide, 22 to 24 O-linked disaccharides, and 12 to 14 O-linked trisaccharides per molecule. N- and O-glycosidic linkages are the most common carbohydrate-protein linkages in mammalian glycoproteins but, to our knowledge, this is the first report of either type of linkage in a prokaryotic cell envelope protein."

Trypsin inhibitors, found in both P. vulgaris and V. unguiculata seeds, have virtually no effect on the bruchid larvae. The conclusion is that a major part of the adaptive significance of phytohemagglutinins in black bean and other legume seeds is to protect them from attack by insect seed predators."
https://openalex.org/W2119144097,"We have devised a general protein fractionation procedure which selects for eukaryotic DNA-binding proteins, some of which resemble DNA-unwinding proteins from prokaryotes. Proteins were selected which (a) pass through a native DNA-cellulose column, (b) bind to a denatured DNA-cellulose column, and (c) remain bound to the latter column during a rinse with a dilute solution of the sodium salt of the polyanion dextran sulfate. When this fractionation was applied to the soluble proteins of calf thymus, three major protein species were recovered. The predominant one has an apparent molecular weight of about 24,000 in sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, is isoelectric near neutrality, and elutes as a monomer from denatured DNA-cellulose at moderate NaCl concentrations. This protein, designated calf-unwinding protein 1 (UPl), has been purified to homogeneity. However, isoelectric focusing reveals four or five subspecies (apparently separated by single-charge differences) which differ appreciably in their affinities for DNA."
https://openalex.org/W1542333814,"Amino acid transport was studied in primary cultures of parenchymal cells isolated from adult rat liver by a collagenase perfusion technique and maintained as a monolayer in a serum-free culture medium. Amino acid transport was assayed by measuring the uptake of the nonmetabolizable amino acid, alpha-aminoisobutyric acid. Rat liver parenchymal cells transported alpha-aminoisobutyric acid by an energy-dependent Na+-requiring system which displayed Michaelis-Menten kinetics. Addition of insulin to cultured rat liver parenchymal cells resulted in an increased influx of alpha-aminoisobutyric acid which was reflected in a higher initial rate of alpha-aminoisobutyric acid transport as well as an increased accumulation of alpha-aminoisobutyric acid at later time points. Cycloheximide effectively blocked the increase while results with actinomycin D were equivocal. Insulin at concentrations as low as 50 pM was effective in stimulating alpha-aminoisobutyric acid transport while the maximal response was observed at 80 nM."
https://openalex.org/W1539688129,"The catalytic activity of phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase in rat liver cytosol is stimulated by incubating with Fe2+, Mn2+, Co2+, and Cd2+. When purified, the enzyme no longer responds to Fe2+, Co2+, or Cd2+ but retains a response to Mn2+. Low concentrations of SO4(2-) in the incubation medium with enzyme and divalent transition metal allow stimulation by Fe2+ and Co2+ and enhance the response to Mn2+. Under identical conditions, orthophosphate with Fe2+ is a potent inhibitor of the enzyme (half-maximal inhibition at 50 muM). A thiol is required in the incubation medium for the effects of Fe2+ plus sulfate or orthophosphate to be expressed. The magnitude of these effects depends on the thiol concentration. Dithiothreitol is more effective than GSH and activation by sulfate plus Fe2+ appears to require the reduced form of dithiothreitol. Sulfate ion is not considered to be the physiological Fe2+-activator of P-enolpyruvate carboxykinase in rat liver cytosol, as this function is fulfilled by a newly discovered liver protein. Knowledge concerning the interaction of Fe2+ and sulfate with the enzyme may be useful in examining their interaction between the enzyme, ferrous ion, and this activator protein."
https://openalex.org/W1596468514,"The relative stabilities of individual HeLa ribosomal proteins and their capacity for exchange between ribosome-bound and -free states in the cytoplasm were examined. Most ribosomal proteins on cytoplasmic ribosomes were found to have uniform, high stability as measured by comparing the short term (12-hour) to steady state (3-day) labeling ratios determined for each ribosomal protein. This would be expected if the proteins in ribosomes either were all stable or were all degraded as a unit. The data do not rule out the possibility that individual proteins have different stabilities prior to their assembly into ribosomes. Four proteins labeled atypically. One large subunit protein (L5) had a lower than average ratio. We interpret this low ratio as being due to a large free pool of this protein. Three proteins (L10, L28, S2) had higher than average ratios, interpreted as being due to reduced protein stability. Two of these proteins (L10, L28) with high ratios were also found to exchange in vivo. The exchangeable proteins may be subject to increased degradation during the time that they spend in the exchangeable free pool. The third protein (S2) with an atypically high ratio is thought to be degraded or altered while on the ribosome, or slowly lost as ribosomes age, because exchange of this protein was not detected. These interpretations and some alternate interpretations are explained. The exchange of three large subunit proteins (L10, L19, L28) was detected by labeling of protein after ribosome synthesis had been inhibited with actinomycin D. Autoradiography of two-dimensional polyacrylamide gels showed labeling of these spots."
https://openalex.org/W1483640756,"Conclusive evidence is presented that a recently purified (Stenflo, J. (1976) J. Biol. Chem. 251, 355-363) vitamin K-dependent protein (arbitrarily referred to as Protein C) which is not related to prothrombin, Factors IX or X is also unrelated to Factor VII. It therefore appears to be a new, previously unrecognized vitamin K-dependent protein. In contrast to prothrombin, which binds to negatively charged phospholipid only in the presence of Ca2+ ions, Protein C, like the other vitamin K-dependent proteins, is a precursor of a serine esterase, presumably a protease, but it does not seem to be necessary for blood coagulation. Although the lipid-binding properties of Protein C may suggest that it is associated with membrane structures, its biological function remains unknown."

https://openalex.org/W1503517711,"We have studied nucleic acid double helix destabilization mediated by purified calf helix-unwinding proteins, measuring ultraviolet hyperchromicity to detect helix melting. Both calf unwinding protein 1 (UP1) and a high salt eluting protein fraction are found to depress strongly the helix melting temperature (Tm) of the synthetic alternating copolymers poly[d(AT)] and poly[r(AU)], indicating that both DNA and RNA are recognized by these proteins. UP1 also destabilizes natural, GC-containing DNA helices, but to a smaller extent than observed with the above polymers. A simple model is presented to aid in the qualitative interpretation of the data, outlining the expected effect on the helix-coil transition of a protein ligand with differential affinity for the helix or coil form of nucleic acid. The observed helix-destabilizing effect of UP1 is dependent on the protein to nucleic acid ratio in an expected manner. Competition studies demonstrate a low, but appreciable affinity of UP1 for native DNA, opening the possibility that protein-mediated denaturation might be initiated by protein binding to the double helix. Hairpin helical regions of denatured DNA are strongly destabilized by UP1. Despite the fact that removal of these hairpin helices might greatly facilitate DNA renaturation, we failed to observe renaturation from the UP1-DNA complex after a switch to helix-stabilizing conditions. Thus, UP1 shows an important difference from its presumed prokaryotic analogue, T4 gene 32-protein. Possible in vivo functions of the calf proteins are discussed in light of these observations."
https://openalex.org/W1603523537,"In the preceding articles we have described the isolation and some of the properties of two calf thymus proteins which bind selectively to single-stranded DNA and which appear analogous to previously isolated prokaryotic DNA-unwinding proteins. In the present work we demonstrate two further points of analogy. First, both the calf UP1 and the high salt eluting proteins form protein-rich complexes with single-stranded DNA, and hold this DNA in a rigid, extended conformation. Second, these proteins stimulate the calf thymus DNA polymerase-alpha; phage T4 gene 32-protein does not. The stimulation of a homologous DNA polymerase is characteristic of several prokaryotic DNA-unwinding proteins and is assumed to reflect their in vivo role in DNA synthesis."

Similar blood levels of BSA were also obtained by placing the fish in 1650 millosmoles of sodium chloride for about 2 minutes, and then immersing them in 2 percent BSA solution for 3 minutes. Uptake of BSA into the fish appeared to be primarily through the lateral line system and secondarily through the gills."
https://openalex.org/W1544388596,"Studies on the mechanism of the glutathione regeneration (Saxena, V.P., and Wetlaufer, D.B. (1970) Biochemistry 9, 5015-5023) of hen egg lysozyme have been carried out. The first two stoichiometric disulfides in lysozyme are formed about 8 times more rapidly than the second two. Almost no enzymic activity is regained until the first two disulfides are formed, thus ruling out an all-or-none mechanism. The disulfide peptides formed early in the regeneration have been isolated and identified. The results show a limited search of folding intermediates, and outline a folding pathway. The early disulfides involve cysteinyl residues III, IV, V, and VI. At the same time cysteinyl residues I, II, VII, and VIII are still reduced, as demonstrated by their isolation as S-alkylated derivatives. At slightly later times a peptide is found which contains the (native) disulfide between cysteinyl residues II and VII. It is likely, but as yet unproven, that formation of disulfide I-VIII completes the cross-linking of lysozyme."

https://openalex.org/W1631710106,"In order to determine whether microtubular proteins of flagellar axonemes were phosphorylated, cells of Chlamydomonas reinhardtii were grown in medium containing [32P]orthophosphate for several generations. Only one (alpha subunit) of the two tubulin polypeptides separated by Na dodecyl-SO4-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis appeared labeled, as detected by autoradiography of the dried gel. 3H- and 32P-labeled alpha tubulin subunit purified by preparative Na dodecyl-SO4-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and Na dodecyl-SO4-hydroxyapatite chromatography contained about 0.2 mol of phosphate per mol of polypeptide. Upon partial acid hydrolysis, radioactivity could be accounted for as serine and threonine phosphate. By altering the conditions of the Na dodecyl-SO4-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis is was possible to resolve the purified alpha-tubulin subunit into five or more components: a major band comprising approximately 65% of the total mass, not phosphorylated, and four or more minor bands comprising together 35% of the mass. Among the minor components at least two were phosphorylated."
https://openalex.org/W1482432108,"The initial step in the fermentation of leucine to acetate, isobutyrate, and ammonia by Clostridium sporogenes is the B12 coenzyme-dependent conversion of alpha-leucine to beta-leucine (3-amino-4-methylpentanoate). The amino group migration reaction, catalyzed by leucine 2,3-aminomutase, is reversible and is inhibited by intrinsic factor. The enzyme activity has been found in several clostridia, in rat, sheep, rhesus, and African green monkey livers, and in human leukocytes."

Initially they received placebo, then a sustained dose of 210 milligrams of delta9-tetrahydrocannabinol (delta9-THC) per day for 18 days, followed by placebo. Lymphocyte responses to phytohemagglutinin were examined during each of these periods. Neither the daily ingestion of marijuana extract containing 210 milligrams of delta9-THC for 18 days nor the history of chronic marijuana smoking had a depressive effect on the lymphocyte responses of these subjects to phytohemagglutinin."
https://openalex.org/W1580262149,"The role of fatty acyl chain unsaturation in promoting asymmetry in phospholipid vesicle bilayers was investigated in mixed lipid systems with differing acyl chains and a constant phosphatidylcholine headgroup. Ratios of outside to inside components were determined by nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy of 13C-enriched egg phosphatidylcholine. An asymmetry or disproportionation ratio is defined and used to express quantitatively how a mixture of two lipids distributes in the outer and inner vesicle surfaces. In mixed systems with 13C-enriched egg phosphatidylcholine as one component, increasing fatty acyl unsaturation in the other component results in an increasing preference of the unsaturated chains for the outer surface."
https://openalex.org/W1641141638,"Lipophosphonoglycan, a major component of the plasma membrane of Acanthamoeba castellanii, has now been shown to contain 8% inositol and 13% C25- and C24-phytosphingosines in addition to the previously identified content of neutral sugars (26%), amino sugars (3%), aminophosphonates (10%), acidhydrolyzable phosphate (3%), and long chain fatty acids (14%). The fatty acids and phytosphingosines are in ceramide groups. Lipophosphonoglycan can be separated by dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide electrophoresis into two major components that are similar in composition except for different oligosaccharide groups. A tentative structural model incorporating these features is proposed in which each of the two components of lipophosphonoglycan is conceived as an oligomeric inositol-containing glycosphingolipid."

These may be detected by the anomalously large increase in the number of ethidium bromide binding sites and the large alteration of the circular dichroism spectra of chromatin. Structural alterations are also suggested by the disappearance of differential light scattering after shearing."
https://openalex.org/W1562623863,"The aggregation state of detergent-extracted cytochrome b5 was examined by gel filtration and sedimentation equilibrium ultracentrifugation. Both techniques indicated the presence of a mixture of monomer and octomer. The proportion of monomer was decreased as the buffer salt concentration was raised and was approximately 1 muM in 10 mM Tris acetate/0.1 mM EDTA. The monomeric cytochrome b5 was isolated by gel filtration and showed a decreased tendency to aggregate in dilute buffer, although its other physical properties were identical to those of the original cytochrome b5. The monomer was found to have a Stokes radius of approximately 26 A, as determined by classical gel filtration and by an equilibrium saturation method where the sample was monitored in the gel by measuring the absorbance of the gel column directly in a dual wavelength spectrophotometer. The gel filtration and ultracentrifugation data together with the studied on the monomeric cytochrome b5 suggest the octomer is not a rapid equilibrium with monomer and this observation should be taken into account in lipid binding experiments with cytochrome b5."
https://openalex.org/W1496717455,"Newly hatched chicks fed a commercial diet containing 1% cyclocreatine (1-carboxymethyl-2-iminoimidazolidine) rapidly accumulate in breast muscle a derivative of cyclocreatine; within a few days concentrations up to 35 mumol of this derivative/g fresh weight of muscle are attained. The following evidence suggests that this derivative is N-phosphorylated cyclocreatine. (a) The derivative is adsorbed by Dowex 1 resin and eluted near phosphocreatine. (b) The derivative present in muscle is converted to free cyclocreatine either by homogenization of muscle in water at room temperature, conditions under which endogenous creatine kinase is active, or by heating a cold acidic muscle extract at 65 degrees for 45 min. (c) The isolated derivative reacts in vitro with the specific reagents crystalline creatine kinase and MgADP to give cyclocreatine. Essentially all of breast muscle cyclocreatine appears to be in the form of P-cyclocreatine, which persists in muscle long after cyclocreatine is removed from the diet. Long term conservation of P-cyclocreatine in muscle is aided by the fact that, unlike P-creatine, P-cyclocreatine is not continuously degraded to an inactive cyclic lactam. It is suggested that the maximal concentrations of P-cyclocreatine2- (and P-creatine2-) attained in sarcoplasm not only affect the phosphorylation potential of muscle cells, but also can account for more than half of the normal inorganic cation concentration of muscle sarcoplasm, and hence play an important role in muscle function. Other chick tissues active in accumulation of cyclocreatine are heart (up to 20 mumol/g fresh weight within 11 days on the diet) and brain (up to 10 mumol/g fresh weight after 30 days on the diet). Addition of 1% creatine to the diet of cyclocreatine-fed chicks does not prevent accumulation of cyclocreatine in muscle. Chicks fed cyclocreatine do not grow as rapidly as those on control diets, but they appear healthy, and mortality is very low when oxytetracycline is added to the drinking water. Cyclocreatine is also taken up by rat muscle, heart, and brain. A sensitive and specific assay for cyclocreatine has been developed. Cyclocreatine reacts with an aged aqueous solution of Na3[Fe(CN)8NH3] under alkaline conditions to give a blue product with a molar absorption coefficient (epsilon) of 4,400 M(-1) cm(? at 605 nm. The following compounds give an epsilon605 in this assay of less than 4 M%? cm(% N-phosphorylcyclocreatine, creatine, P-creatine, creatinine, 1-carboxymethyl-2-iminohexahydropyrimidine, guanidinoacetate, 3-guanidinopropionate, and arginine. Cyclocreatine does not interfere with the diacetyl-alpha-naphthol assay for creatine."
https://openalex.org/W1983164857,"In a voltage-clamped aplysia neuron (R15), depolarization beyond -30 millivolts produces an inward sodium current. Depolarization beyond -10 millivolts produces an additional inward calcium current with slower kinetics than the sodium current. When these ionic currents have been suppressed and capacitive currents subtracted out, a small outward displacement current can be seen with depolarizations beyond -30 millivolts. An additional, slower displacement current is seen with depolarizations beyond -10 millivolts. The currents have an exponential decay with an increase in rate per 10°C increase in temperature of about 3 and are thought to be sodium and calcium gating currents."

https://openalex.org/W1598890192,"Total protein was released from isolated HeLa cell nucleoli by guanidine hydrochloride, purified by cesium chloride density gradient centrifugation, and analyzed by two-dimensional polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Conditions of electrophoresis restricted attention to proteins that are positively charged at pH 8.6. Most of the major nucleolar protein spots co-electrophoresed with ribosomal proteins; the majority of ribosomal proteins from both the large and small ribosomal subunits were represented. Several proteins found in association with polysomes but not on ribosomal subunits and several proteins unique to the nucleolus were also identified in these nucleolar protein patterns. In order to determine whether the ribosomal proteins found in the nucleolus represented sizable pools of ribosomal proteins, or merely ribosomal proteins contained in the preribosomal particles, [35S]methionine-labeled nucleoli were mixed with [3H]methionine-labeled polysomes. From analysis of isotopic ratios in individual protein spots it was possible to determine the stoidchiometry of individual ribosomal proteins in the nucleolus relative to their complement on cytoplasmic ribosomes. All but a few proteins exhibited relative nucleolar stoichiometry values of approximately one, indicating that there are not significant pools of most ribosomal proteins in isolated nucleoli."

https://openalex.org/W1535850064,"Quantitative affinity chromatography on uridine-5'-(Sepharose-4-aminophenylphosphoryl)-2'(3')-phosphate was developed for the study of binding of ribonuclease species to nucleotide ligands. Elution of the native species ribonuclease-A and -S on the afffinity matrix in 0.4 M ammonium acetate, pH 5.2, containing various amounts of the soluble competing ligand 2'-cytidine monophosphate, reveals an inverse response of elution volume to concentration of soluble ligand. This response conforms to behavior expected for the competing binding equilibria enzyme-soluble ligand and enzyme-insoluble ligand. A-NALYSIS OF ELUTION DATA ALLOWS CALCULATION OF KI and KIM, the dissociation constants, respectively, for the soluble and insoluble protein-ligand complexes. The values of these chromatographically derived constants are similar to values of dissocation constants determined in solution by kinetics of inhibition by 2'-cytidine monophosphate and uridine-5'-(j-aminophenylphosphoryl)-2'(3')-phosphate. Successful competitive elution experiments with [p-F-Phe8]semisynthetic ribonuclease-S' and individual elution trials for [4-F-His12]semisynthetic ribonuclease-S' indicate the utility of the quantitative affinity chromatographic technique for determination of ligand binding properties of ribonuclease derivatives, including inactive species. Nonbiospecific aspects of the interaction of ribonuclease with the affinity matrix in ammonium acetate buffers of concentrations 0.1 M and below were noted, delinating limits of conditions allowing the biospecificity needed for ligand-binding analyses by competitive elution. The dependence of ribonuclease competitive elution behavior on the amount of protein eluted also was examined and related to theoretical considerations in the quantitative application of affinity chromatography."

It was obtained in immunologically pure form and in 56% yield. The Stokes radius of pure free secretory component was found to be 4.3 nm by gel filtration, and an (see article) of 4.1 S was determined by the ultracentrifuge. The molecular weight was 79,000 by sodium dodecyl sulfate gel electrophoresis and by sedimentation dquilibrium in the ultracentrifuge, using a v of 0.73 determined by ultracentrifugation in D2O and H2O. A minimal axial ratio of approximately 5 was calculated. Amino acid analysis of bovine free secretory component showed remarkable similarity to that of human, dog, and rabbit but carbohydrate analysis showed significant differences. In contrast to the human, bovine free secretory compoennt has 2 methionine residues/mol. The NH2-terminal sequence was found to be Lys-Ser-Pro-Ile-PPHE-Gly-Pro-Glu-Glu-Val-Asp-Ser-Val. This sequence is identical with that the human and dog. However, the poor immunological cross-reactivity between the dog, human, and bovine proteins suggests that significant structural differences will be found in other regions of the molecule."
