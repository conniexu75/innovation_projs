https://openalex.org/W1195318580,"All eukaryotes utilize a single termination factor, eRF1, to halt translation when the ribosome encounters one of three possible stop codons; here electron cryo-microscopy structures of ribosome–eRF1 complexes in the process of recognizing each stop codon reveal how stop codons are discriminated from sense codons. Mammalian messenger RNAs utilize three stop codons, but have a single termination factor, eRF1, that can recognize all three. To understand how eRF1 can distinguish stop codons from sense codons, Alan Brown et al. determined the structures of the mammalian 80S ribosome bound to eRF1 and mRNAs containing each of the stop codons. They find that two nucleotides from the 18S rRNA are stacked with two of the stop codon nucleotides, and the next nucleotide, to compact the mRNA, a conformation that favours stop codons to the exclusion of sense codons. Termination of protein synthesis occurs when a translating ribosome encounters one of three universally conserved stop codons: UAA, UAG or UGA. Release factors recognize stop codons in the ribosomal A-site to mediate release of the nascent chain and recycling of the ribosome. Bacteria decode stop codons using two separate release factors with differing specificities for the second and third bases1. By contrast, eukaryotes rely on an evolutionarily unrelated omnipotent release factor (eRF1) to recognize all three stop codons2. The molecular basis of eRF1 discrimination for stop codons over sense codons is not known. Here we present cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) structures at 3.5–3.8 Å resolution of mammalian ribosomal complexes containing eRF1 interacting with each of the three stop codons in the A-site. Binding of eRF1 flips nucleotide A1825 of 18S ribosomal RNA so that it stacks on the second and third stop codon bases. This configuration pulls the fourth position base into the A-site, where it is stabilized by stacking against G626 of 18S rRNA. Thus, eRF1 exploits two rRNA nucleotides also used during transfer RNA selection to drive messenger RNA compaction. In this compacted mRNA conformation, stop codons are favoured by a hydrogen-bonding network formed between rRNA and essential eRF1 residues that constrains the identity of the bases. These results provide a molecular framework for eukaryotic stop codon recognition and have implications for future studies on the mechanisms of canonical and premature translation termination3,4."
https://openalex.org/W1722494167,"The chemotherapeutic use of cisplatin is limited by its severe side effects. In this study, by conducting different omics data analyses, we demonstrated that cisplatin induces cell death in a proximal tubular cell line by suppressing glycolysis- and tricarboxylic acid (TCA)/mitochondria-related genes. Furthermore, analysis of the urine from cisplatin-treated rats revealed the lower expression levels of enzymes involved in glycolysis, TCA cycle, and genes related to mitochondrial stability and confirmed the cisplatin-related metabolic abnormalities. Additionally, an increase in the level of p53, which directly inhibits glycolysis, has been observed. Inhibition of p53 restored glycolysis and significantly reduced the rate of cell death at 24 h and 48 h due to p53 inhibition. The foremost reason of cisplatin-related cytotoxicity has been correlated to the generation of mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (ROS) that influence multiple pathways. Abnormalities in these pathways resulted in the collapse of mitochondrial energy production, which in turn sensitized the cells to death. The quenching of ROS led to the amelioration of the affected pathways. Considering these observations, it can be concluded that there is a significant correlation between cisplatin and metabolic dysfunctions involving mROS as the major player."
https://openalex.org/W1935778529,"Only three elements are ferromagnetic at room temperature: the transition metals iron, cobalt and nickel. The Stoner criterion explains why iron is ferromagnetic but manganese, for example, is not, even though both elements have an unfilled 3d shell and are adjacent in the periodic table: according to this criterion, the product of the density of states and the exchange integral must be greater than unity for spontaneous spin ordering to emerge. Here we demonstrate that it is possible to alter the electronic states of non-ferromagnetic materials, such as diamagnetic copper and paramagnetic manganese, to overcome the Stoner criterion and make them ferromagnetic at room temperature. This effect is achieved via interfaces between metallic thin films and C60 molecular layers. The emergent ferromagnetic state exists over several layers of the metal before being quenched at large sample thicknesses by the material's bulk properties. Although the induced magnetization is easily measurable by magnetometry, low-energy muon spin spectroscopy provides insight into its distribution by studying the depolarization process of low-energy muons implanted in the sample. This technique indicates localized spin-ordered states at, and close to, the metal-molecule interface. Density functional theory simulations suggest a mechanism based on magnetic hardening of the metal atoms, owing to electron transfer. This mechanism might allow for the exploitation of molecular coupling to design magnetic metamaterials using abundant, non-toxic components such as organic semiconductors. Charge transfer at molecular interfaces may thus be used to control spin polarization or magnetization, with consequences for the design of devices for electronic, power or computing applications (see, for example, refs 6 and 7)."
https://openalex.org/W2135608154,"Soils of the northern high latitudes store carbon over millennial timescales (thousands of years) and contain approximately double the carbon stock of the atmosphere. Warming and associated permafrost thaw can expose soil organic carbon and result in mineralization and carbon dioxide (CO2) release. However, some of this soil organic carbon may be eroded and transferred to rivers. If it escapes degradation during river transport and is buried in marine sediments, then it can contribute to a longer-term (more than ten thousand years), geological CO2 sink. Despite this recognition, the erosional flux and fate of particulate organic carbon (POC) in large rivers at high latitudes remains poorly constrained. Here, we quantify the source of POC in the Mackenzie River, the main sediment supplier to the Arctic Ocean, and assess its flux and fate. We combine measurements of radiocarbon, stable carbon isotopes and element ratios to correct for rock-derived POC. Our samples reveal that the eroded biospheric POC has resided in the basin for millennia, with a mean radiocarbon age of 5,800 ± 800 years, much older than the POC in large tropical rivers. From the measured biospheric POC content and variability in annual sediment yield, we calculate a biospheric POC flux of 2.2(+1.3)(-0.9) teragrams of carbon per year from the Mackenzie River, which is three times the CO2 drawdown by silicate weathering in this basin. Offshore, we find evidence for efficient terrestrial organic carbon burial over the Holocene period, suggesting that erosion of organic carbon-rich, high-latitude soils may result in an important geological CO2 sink."
https://openalex.org/W1899700528,"Little research has focused on the relationship between religion and climate change attitudes and behavior. Further, while there have been some studies examining the relationship between environmental attitudes and religion, most are focused on Christian denominations and secularism, and few have examined other religions such as Buddhism. Using an online survey of 1,927 Australians we examined links between membership of four religious groupings (Buddhists, Christian literalists and non-literalists, and Secularists) and climate change attitudes and behaviors. Differences were found across religious groups in terms of their belief in: (a) human induced climate change, (b) the level of consensus among scientists, (c) their own efficacy, and (d) the need for policy responses. We show, using ordinal regression, that religion explains these differences even after taking into account socio-demographic factors, knowledge and environmental attitude, including belief in man's dominion over nature. Differences in attitude and behavior between these religious groups suggest the importance of engaging denominations to encourage change in attitudes and behavior among their members."
https://openalex.org/W2203735107,"Why mammalian cells possess multiple DNA glycosylases (DGs) with overlapping substrate ranges for repairing oxidatively damaged bases via the base excision repair (BER) pathway is a long-standing question. To determine the biological role of these DGs, null animal models have been generated. Here, we report the generation and characterization of mice lacking Neil2 (Nei-like 2). As in mice deficient in each of the other four oxidized base-specific DGs (OGG1, NTH1, NEIL1, and NEIL3), Neil2-null mice show no overt phenotype. However, middle-aged to old Neil2-null mice show the accumulation of oxidative genomic damage, mostly in the transcribed regions. Immuno-pulldown analysis from wild-type (WT) mouse tissue showed the association of NEIL2 with RNA polymerase II, along with Cockayne syndrome group B protein, TFIIH, and other BER proteins. Chromatin immunoprecipitation analysis from mouse tissue showed co-occupancy of NEIL2 and RNA polymerase II only on the transcribed genes, consistent with our earlier in vitro findings on NEIL2's role in transcription-coupled BER. This study provides the first in vivo evidence of genomic region-specific repair in mammals. Furthermore, telomere loss and genomic instability were observed at a higher frequency in embryonic fibroblasts from Neil2-null mice than from the WT. Moreover, Neil2-null mice are much more responsive to inflammatory agents than WT mice. Taken together, our results underscore the importance of NEIL2 in protecting mammals from the development of various pathologies that are linked to genomic instability and/or inflammation. NEIL2 is thus likely to play an important role in long term genomic maintenance, particularly in long-lived mammals such as humans."
https://openalex.org/W1909974720,"Glioblastoma (grade IV glioma/GBM) is the most common primary adult malignant brain tumor with poor prognosis. To characterize molecular determinants of tumor-stroma interaction in GBM, we profiled 48 serum cytokines and identified macrophage colony-stimulating factor (MCSF) as one of the elevated cytokines in sera from GBM patients. Both MCSF transcript and protein were up-regulated in GBM tissue samples through a spleen tyrosine kinase (SYK)-dependent activation of the PI3K-NFκB pathway. Ectopic overexpression and silencing experiments revealed that glioma-secreted MCSF has no role in autocrine functions and M2 polarization of macrophages. In contrast, silencing expression of MCSF in glioma cells prevented tube formation of human umbilical vein endothelial cells elicited by the supernatant from monocytes/microglial cells treated with conditioned medium from glioma cells. Quantitative proteomics based on stable isotope labeling by amino acids in cell culture showed that glioma-derived MCSF induces changes in microglial secretome and identified insulin-like growth factor-binding protein 1 (IGFBP1) as one of the MCSF-regulated proteins secreted by microglia. Silencing IGFBP1 expression in microglial cells or its neutralization by an antibody reduced the ability of supernatants derived from microglial cells treated with glioma cell-conditioned medium to induce angiogenesis. In conclusion, this study shows up-regulation of MCSF in GBM via a SYK-PI3K-NFκB-dependent mechanism and identifies IGFBP1 released by microglial cells as a novel mediator of MCSF-induced angiogenesis, of potential interest for developing targeted therapy to prevent GBM progression.

https://openalex.org/W1919860420,"Titanium dioxide (TiO2) nanoparticles are one of the most highly manufactured and employed nanomaterials in the world with applications in copious industrial and consumer products. The liver is a major accumulation site for many nanoparticles, including TiO2, directly through intentional exposure or indirectly through unintentional ingestion via water, food or animals and increased environmental contamination. Growing concerns over the current usage of TiO2 coupled with the lack of mechanistic understanding of its potential health risk is the motivation for this study. Here we determined the toxic effect of three different TiO2 nanoparticles (commercially available rutile, anatase and P25) on primary rat hepatocytes. Specifically, we evaluated events related to hepatocyte functions and mitochondrial dynamics: (1) urea and albumin synthesis using colorimetric and ELISA assays, respectively; (2) redox signaling mechanisms by measuring reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, manganese superoxide dismutase (MnSOD) activity and mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP); (3) OPA1 and Mfn-1 expression that mediates the mitochondrial dynamics by PCR; and (4) mitochondrial morphology by MitoTracker Green FM staining. All three TiO2 nanoparticles induced a significant loss (p < 0.05) in hepatocyte functions even at concentrations as low as 50 ppm with commercially used P25 causing maximum damage. TiO2 nanoparticles induced a strong oxidative stress in primary hepatocytes. TiO2 nanoparticles exposure also resulted in morphological changes in mitochondria and substantial loss in the fusion process, thus impairing the mitochondrial dynamics. Although this study demonstrated that TiO2 nanoparticles exposure resulted in substantial damage to primary hepatocytes, more in vitro and in vivo studies are required to determine the complete toxicological mechanism in primary hepatocytes and subsequently liver function."
https://openalex.org/W2285812380,"Nedd4-family E3 ubiquitin ligases regulate an array of biologic processes. Autoinhibition maintains these catalytic ligases in an inactive state through several mechanisms. However, although some Nedd4 family members are activated by binding to Nedd4 family-interacting proteins (Ndfips), how binding activates E3 function remains unclear. Our data reveal how these two regulatory processes are linked functionally. In the absence of Ndfip1, the Nedd4 family member Itch can bind an E2 but cannot accept ubiquitin onto its catalytic cysteine. This is because Itch is autoinhibited by an intramolecular interaction between its HECT (homologous to the E6-AP carboxy terminus domain) and two central WW domains. Ndfip1 binds these WW domains to release the HECT, allowing trans-thiolation and Itch catalytic activity. This molecular switch also regulates the closely related family member WWP2. Importantly, multiple PY motifs are required for Ndfip1 to activate Itch, functionally distinguishing Ndfips from single PY-containing substrates.

This includes an N-terminal C2 domain, two to four WW domains, and a HECT domain that is the defining feature of HECT E3 ligases. The catalytic HECT domain is comprised of an E2 binding “N-lobe” and a catalytic cysteine residue in the “C-lobe.” The catalytic cysteine accepts ubiquitin from an E2 in a trans-thiolation reaction to form a HECT∼Ub intermediate, rendering the ligase catalytically active (11Huang L.

Control of the activity of WW-HECT domain E3 ubiquitin ligases by NDFIP proteins.EMBO Rep. 2009; 10: 501-507Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). It has been shown that phosphorylation of Itch by JNK1 can promote Itch activity (16Gallagher E. Gao M. Liu Y.C. Karin M. Activation of the E3 ubiquitin ligase Itch through a phosphorylation-induced conformational change.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2006; 103: 1717-1722Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar). Additionally, Itch can be activated by its interaction with Ndfip1 (24Mund T. Pelham H.R. Control of the activity of WW-HECT domain E3 ubiquitin ligases by NDFIP proteins.EMBO Rep. 2009; 10: 501-507Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). The dependence of Itch on Ndfip1 for function suggests that phosphorylation alone is not sufficient to promote Itch function. How intramolecular autoinhibition prevents Itch catalytic function and how Ndfip1 binding releases this has still to be determined. Here we defined the enzymatic step at which Itch catalytic function is inhibited. Itch autoinhibition is maintained by an intramolecular interaction between its HECT and two core WW domains. This autoinhibited state prevents E2-Itch trans-thiolation from occurring, thereby rendering Itch catalytically inactive. Ndfip1 binding to Itch releases the autoinhibitory conformation that holds Itch in an “off” state. Binding of Ndfip1 to the core WW domains releases the HECT and allows the trans-thiolation reaction between the E2 and Itch to take place. Our data show that these regulatory mechanisms may be true for WWP2 and, possibly, other Nedd4 family members. Nedd4 family member E3 ligase constructs were prepared using PCR amplification to insert restriction sites in cDNA encoding specified variants. The cDNA constructs used were as follows: mouse Itch variant 1 (catalog no. MC205232, Origene), mouse Ndfip1 (catalog no. MG202546, Origene), mouse Nedd4 (catalog no. MG222243, Origene), and mouse WWP2 (catalog no. MC202685, Origene). These inserts were ligated into an N-terminal His-MBP tag pRSF-1B plasmid. WW domain mutants were made by introducing a tryptophan-to-alanine point mutation in the hydrophobic binding pocket. Truncation mutants of Itch were constructed from mouse Itch cDNA. The ItchWW1-HECT construct contains residues 285–864. ItchWW3-HECT contains residues 397–864, and ItchHECT contains residues 486–864. Site-directed mutagenesis was performed using the QuikChange mutagenesis kit (Agilent). UbcH5B and UbcH7 fused with a small ubiquitin-like modifier and a hexahistidine tag were cloned into pRSF-duet expression vectors. GST-tagged full-length Itch and the HECT domain were cloned into pGEX 4T-1 to provide GST-Itch for affinity studies. Ndfip family constructs were prepared as described previously and ligated into the pGEX-4T-2 vector (GE Life Sciences). Plasmids were transformed into BL21(DE3) Escherichia coli and purified with nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose (Qiagen) in the case of His-MBP fusion proteins or glutathione-Sepharose 4B (GE Life Sciences) in the case of GST fusion proteins, followed by size-exclusion chromatography. Anti-GST antibody-conjugated biosensors were used to trap GST-ITCH as ligand. 1–50 μm UbcH5B and 3–250 μm UbcH7 as analytes were prepared in assay buffer (25 mm Tris (pH 7.6), 150 mm NaCl, 0.1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, and 0.01% Tween 20) to titrate the GST-ITCH-bound biosensor to measure the binding kinetics. All experiments were carried out on an Octet Red96 (Pall ForteBio Corp., Menlo Park, CA) with four repeats at 26 °C. Both association and dissociation steps in the BioLayer interferometry assays lasted 60 s. The response shifts were extracted and fitted to an equivalent binding model to obtain the Kd values. The E1 ubiquitin-activating enzyme Ube1 (Boston Biochem), the E2 ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme UbcH7 (Boston Biochem), and biotinylated ubiquitin (Boston Biochem) were incubated at 25 °C in ubiquitylation buffer (40 mm Tris (pH 7.6), 250 mm NaCl, 1.7 mm ATP, 8.3 mm MgCl2, and 3.3 μg/ml ovalbumin). After 30 min, the reaction was quenched on ice by 5-fold dilution with quenching solution (25 mm EDTA, 25 mm HEPES (pH 7.5), and 100 mm NaCl). The resultant ubiquitin-loaded E2 mixture was then introduced to the E3 mixture on ice, resulting in a final mixture concentration of 6 μm E3, 200 nm E2, 10 nm E1, and 400 nm Ub. Ndfip1 constructs introduced to the mixture were at a final concentration of 16 μm. WW domain trans-inhibition assays used a final concentration of 30 μm WW domain and 60 μm Ndfip1. Loading of ubiquitin onto E3 via thioester bond formation was stopped by quenching with an equal volume of Laemmli buffer at the indicated time points. Ubiquitylated products were resolved on SDS gels and detected using Li-Cor IRDye 800CW streptavidin (Li-Cor). Confirmation of thioester loading was obtained by introducing samples to 50 μm DTT to reduce the thioester bond. E3 ubiquitylation activity was monitored using a homogeneous Time-resolved-FRET assay as described previously with slight modifications (27Marblestone J.G. Larocque J.P. Mattern M.R. Leach C.A. Analysis of ubiquitin E3 ligase activity using selective polyubiquitin binding proteins.Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2012; 1823: 2094-2097Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). The reaction components were diluted in assay buffer (50 mm Tris (pH 8.0), 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm β-mercaptoethanol, and 0.05% CHAPS) to a final volume of 20 μl and assembled in a 384-well polypropylene plate. Briefly, ubiquitylation mixture (0.2 mm ATP, 5 nm E1, and 100 nm UbcH5c) containing varying concentrations of E3 was combined with varying doses of Ndfip1/2 or peptides and homogeneous time-resolved fluorescence detection mixture (Biotin-K63TUBE (LifeSensors), Streptavidin-Terbium (CisBio), and wild-type and fluorescein-labeled ubiquitin). Time-resolved-FRET was monitored in real time using a PerkinElmer Life Sciences Envision plate reader (excitation, 340 nm; emission 1, 520 nm; emission 2, 480 nm). The TR-FRET ratio was calculated by emission520/emission480. ItchWT and the ItchWW2,3A mutant were cloned into the MSCV-IRES-NGFR vector (provided by Dr. Andrew Wells, Children's Hospital of Philadelphia). Cells were transfected using the Invitrogen neon electroporation system (Invitrogen) according to the protocols of the manufacturer. Prior to transfection, Jurkat E6.1 cells (Progenra) were grown in RPMI 1640 medium (Gibco) supplemented with 10% FCS, 20 mm GlutaMAX (Gibco), and 25 mm HEPES (pH 7.0) with no antibiotics. Cells were washed with PBS and resuspended at 2.0 × 107 cells/ml in buffer R (Invitrogen) prior to electroporation. 24 h later, transfected cells were purified based on NGFR expression using phycoerythrin-NGFR antibody (BD Biosciences), anti-phycoerythrin magnetic beads, and LS columns (Miltenyi). To assess protein stability, NGFR+ cells were stimulated for 2 h with phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (30 ng/ml) and ionomycin (1 μg/ml), and cycloheximide (Sigma) was added to a final concentration of 10 μg/ml for an additional 2 h of stimulation. JunB was quantified using rabbit anti-JunB (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, catalog no. SC-44). The degradation of JunB in ItchWW2,3A was then compared with the degradation of JunB in ItchWT to normalize for variations in JunB expression. ItchWT, ItchC832A, ItchWW2,3A, and ItchWW2,3A-C832A in the MSCV-IRES-NGFR vector were incubated with Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen). 2 μg of plasmid was incubated with 20 μl of Lipofectamine 2000 for 20 min in 1 ml of Opti-MEM (Gibco) and then introduced to 70% confluent HEK293T cells on 60-mm cell culture dishes (Corning). Cells were then incubated with Lipofectamine and plasmid mixture at 37 °C in 5% CO2 for 4 h. Transfection medium was replaced with growth media, and cells were incubated at 37 °C overnight. Cycloheximide was added to a final concentration of 10 μg/ml, and time points were harvested every 2 h. Cells were washed in PBS and lysed in 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.6), 1% Nonidet P-40, and 150 mm NaCl with complete protease inhibitors (Roche). Lysates were run on Bio-Rad Criterion 4–20% Tris-HCl gradient gels at 20 μg of lysate/lane. PepSpot peptide arrays (JPT peptides) containing 81 overlapping peptides covering the mouse HECT domain (amino acids 530–864) were synthesized. Each peptide was 16 residues in length and overlapped adjacent sequences by 12 residues. The PepSpot array was activated in methanol, washed in TBS, and then blocked for 3 h in Western blocking reagent solution (Roche). The MBP-tagged WW1-WW4 cassette was then added at 10 μg/ml and incubated at 4 °C overnight. MBP was detected using a mouse monoclonal anti-MBP antibody (New England Biolabs) and IRDye 800 CW anti-mouse IgG (Li-Cor). Binding was quantified using laser densitometry on the Li-Cor Odyssey system. Ndfip1 peptide mimics were synthesized by the W. M. Keck Foundation Biotechnology Resource Laboratory (Yale University, New Haven, CT). Peptides were purified using reverse-phase HPLC, and mass was confirmed by MALDI-TOF and LC-MS. Lyophilized peptides were resuspended in water, incubated at 37 °C for 1 h, and vortexed. Peptide amino acid sequences were as follows: peptide 1, N-PEQTAGDAPPPYSSITAESAAYFDY-C; peptide 2, N-GDAPPPYSSITAESAAYFDYKDESGFPKPPSYNVA-C; peptide 3, N-GDAPPPYSSITAESAAYFDYKDESGFPKPPSYNVATTLPSYDEAE-C. Itch has been shown to be autoinhibited (24Mund T. Pelham H.R. Control of the activity of WW-HECT domain E3 ubiquitin ligases by NDFIP proteins.EMBO Rep. 2009; 10: 501-507Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar) in a way that can be relieved by interaction with Ndfip1, but the stage of the catalytic cycle at which Itch is autoinhibited is unknown. Therefore, we first asked whether Ndfip1 is required for E2-E3 trans-thiolation, a requisite step in Itch E3 activation. We incubated Itch in the presence or absence of Ndfip1 with ubiquitin-loaded E2 (UbcH7). To track ubiquitin transfer to Itch, we used biotinylated ubiquitin and visualized it using streptavidin. No ubiquitin was transferred to Itch in the absence of Ndfip1 (Fig. 1A). However, when the cytoplasmic region of Ndfip1 was added to the reaction, the transfer of ubiquitin to Itch became evident. This was confirmed to be a transfer of ubiquitin to the catalytic cysteine of Itch and not autoubiquitylation by demonstrating that the Itch∼Ub species was lost after DTT treatment (Fig. 1B). This confirmed that Itch is autoinhibited at a catalytic step prior to ubiquitin ligation or interaction with substrate. This block in Itch ubiquitin charging suggested that Itch might be unable to bind to its conjugate E2 in the absence of an adaptor, as has been shown with Smurf2. To test this, we examined Itch-E2 binding in the presence or absence of Ndfip1. Native gel analysis of Itch-E2 complexes showed that Itch does not require Ndfip1 to associate with an E2 (Fig. 2A). To further test whether autoinhibited Itch could interact with its E2, we compared the E2 binding of full-length Itch to that of ItchHECT alone, which is robustly active in the absence of Ndfip1. We tested the binding of ItchWT and ItchHECT to UbcH7 as well as UbcH5b (Fig. 2, B and C). Interestingly, ItchWT shows a marked preference for binding UbcH5B in this assay. However, it remains to be seen whether these data imply any functional preference of Itch for an E2 encountered in vivo. Nevertheless, these data show that full-length Itch can bind an E2 with similar affinity as that of the HECT domain alone, indicating that Itch can interact with an E2 even in its autoinhibited state. Therefore, unlike Smurf2, Itch autoinhibition does not appear to be controlled at the level of E2 interaction. This fits well with structural data showing that, unlike Smurf2, Itch does not have a suboptimal E2 binding pocket (18Ogunjimi A.A. Briant D.J. Pece-Barbara N. Le Roy C. Di Guglielmo G.M. Kavsak P. Rasmussen R.K. Seet B.T. Sicheri F. Wrana J.L. Regulation of Smurf2 ubiquitin ligase activity by anchoring the E2 to the HECT domain.Mol. Cell. 2005; 19: 297-308Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). One motif proposed to maintain Itch autoinhibition lies in a proline-rich region unique to Itch, between the C2 and its most N-terminal WW domain (16Gallagher E. Gao M. Liu Y.C. Karin M. Activation of the E3 ubiquitin ligase Itch through a phosphorylation-induced conformational change.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2006; 103: 1717-1722Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar, 24Mund T. Pelham H.R. Control of the activity of WW-HECT domain E3 ubiquitin ligases by NDFIP proteins.EMBO Rep. 2009; 10: 501-507Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). To test the contribution of this region to the block in E2-E3 trans-thiolation, we generated a truncated version of Itch (ItchWW1-HECT, illustrated in Fig. 3A). Surprisingly, as with ItchWT, ubiquitin transfer to ItchWW1-HECT was promoted by, and therefore dependent on, Ndfip1 (Fig. 3, A and B). Therefore, even in the absence of the C2 domain and the proline-rich region, E2-mediated transfer of ubiquitin to the catalytic cysteine was inhibited robustly. Because ItchWW1-HECT contains the WW and HECT domains, we hypothesized that autoinhibition might require the WW domains. We tested this by reducing the number of WW domains in Itch. Constructs of Itch were made that contained four, two or no WW domains (ItchWW1-HECT, ItchWW3-HECT, and ItchHECT, respectively; Fig. 4A). Consistent with our previous results, the construct containing four WW domains was inactive and relied on the addition of Ndfip1 to become efficiently charged by the E2. As shown previously, loss of all four WW domains in the ItchHECT construct leads to robust, Ndfip1-independent catalytic function. Supporting a role for multiple WW domains in blocking E2-E3 trans-thiolation, loss of two of the four WW domains led to partial relief of auto"

Methods Healthy girls with different percentages of body fat at baseline (40 obese, 40 normal, and 40 lean) were recruited from three elementary schools in Shenyang, China. These girls (mean age 8.5 years) were also matched by height, school grade, Tanner stage, and family economic status at baseline. Anthropometry, puberty characteristics, and sex hormone concentrations were measured at baseline and at each follow-up visit. The generalized estimating equation model and analysis of variance for repeated measures using a generalized linear model were used to determine the differences in puberty characteristics and sex hormones among three groups. Results Over 4 years, mean age of breast II onset was earlier among obese girls (8.8 years) than normal girls (9.2 years) and lean girls (9.3 years). The prevalence (%) of early-maturation in the obese, normal, and lean groups was 25.9%, 11.1%, and 7.4%, respectively. Obesity was associated with an increased risk for breast stage II (year 2: RR, 6.3; 95% CI, 1.9–21.1 and year 3: RR, 6.9; 95% CI, 0.8–60.1). None of the girls experienced menarche in the first year; however, by the fourth year 50.0% of obese girls had menarche onset, which was higher than normal weight (27.5%) and lean girls (8.1%). The mean estradiol level increased with age in the obese, normal, and lean groups. The mean estradiol concentration was higher in obese girls than in normal and lean girls throughout the 4-year period (P<0.05). Conclusions Childhood obesity contributes to early onset of puberty and elevated levels of estradiol in girls."
https://openalex.org/W1094547483,"Nuclear factor erythroid-2-related factor 2 (NFE2L2) is a transcription factor associated with resistance to chemotherapy and increased tumor growth. NRF2 is repressed by the inhibitor Keap1. The Keap1-NRF2 pathway is dysfunctional in multiple tumor types. Among Uighur women, the incidence of cervical squamous cell carcinoma (CSCC) and cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) was associated with elevated nuclear expression of NRF2 and decreased cytoplasmic expression of Keap1. Up-regulation of nuclear NRF2 was significantly associated with reduced cytoplasmic Keap1 expression. NRF2 positivity and Keap1 negativity were frequently associated with more advanced tumors (i.e., higher histological grade, lymph node involvement, and higher tumor stages) (p<0.05 for all). Methylated CpG islands in the Keap1 gene promoter in cervical cancer tissue were identified using MassARRAY. Moreover, promoter hypermethylation of this gene was significantly associated with decreased protein expression and increased nuclear NRF2 expression in cervical cancer tissues. Overexpression and knockdown of NRF2 in CSCC cell lines showed that NRF2 promotes proliferation, inhibits apoptosis, and enhances migration and invasion. These studies support the concept that epigenetic changes regulate expression of Keap1 in cervical cancer tissues. The association of NRF2 expression with aggressive tumor behavior suggests that NRF2 may be a marker of poor prognosis in patients with cervical cancer."

https://openalex.org/W1915662031,"Background Performance in primary school is a determinant of children’s educational attainment and their socio-economic position and health inequalities in adulthood. We examined the relationship between five common childhood health conditions (asthma symptoms, eczema, general health, frequent respiratory infections, and overweight), health related school absence and family socio-economic status on children’s school performance. Methods We used data from 1,865 children in the Dutch PIAMA birth cohort study. School performance was measured as the teacher’s assessment of a suitable secondary school level for the child, and the child’s score on a standardized achievement test (Cito Test). Both school performance indicators were standardised using Z-scores. Childhood health was indicated by eczema, asthma symptoms, general health, frequent respiratory infections, overweight, and health related school absence. Children’s health conditions were reported repeatedly between the age of one to eleven. School absenteeism was reported at age eleven. Highest attained educational level of the mother and father indicated family socio-economic status. We used linear regression models with heteroskedasticity-robust standard errors for our analyses with adjustment for sex of the child. Results The health indicators used in our study were not associated with children’s school performance, independently from parental educational level, with the exception of asthma symptoms (-0.03 z-score / -0.04 z-score with Cito Test score after adjusting for respectively maternal and paternal education) and missing more than 5 schooldays due to illness (-0.18 z-score with Cito Test score and -0.17 z-score with school level assessment after adjustment for paternal education). The effect estimates for these health indicators were much smaller though than the effect estimates for parental education, which was strongly associated with children’s school performance. Conclusion Children’s school performance was affected only slightly by a number of common childhood health problems, but was strongly associated with parental education."
https://openalex.org/W1951313895,"The use of khat (Catha edulis) is a major public health and social problem that is believed to be growing globally. The khat chewing habit is prevalent in all areas of the Jazan region, Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA). However, few studies have been conducted at the community level to investigate the khat chewing habits in this area. This study was conducted with the aim of assessing the prevalence and predictors of khat chewing among the Jazan community population. A cross-sectional study was conducted with a sample (n = 4,500) of the Jizani population who attended primary heath care centers in Jazan region. The participants were selected using a two-stage cluster random sampling. A structured questionnaire was used for data collection. The overall lifetime prevalence of khat chewing was 33.2% (95% CI 31.8–34.7) and was significantly higher for males 42.2% (95% CI 40.4–43.9) than for females 11.3% (95% CI 9.6–13.1) (P < 0.001). Current khat chewers accounted for 28.7% (95% CI 27.4–30.1) of the population sampled; 36.9% (95% CI 35.2–38.6) of whom were males, which is a significantly higher percentage than the 8.7% (95% CI 7.3–10.4) of current khat chewers who were females (P < 0.001). The multivariate logistic regression analysis suggests that the most important independent predictors of khat chewing were having a friend who chewed khat (OR = 20.1, P < 0.001), participant's smoking status (OR) = 3.9, P < 0.001), friend's smoking status (OR = 2.2, P < 0.001), gender (OR = 2.2, P < 0.001) and educational level (OR = 1.5, P < 0.05).

https://openalex.org/W2238529478,"Lupus nephritis (LN) is a complication of the autoimmune disease systemic lupus erythematosus. Because the complement system plays a critical role in orchestrating inflammatory and immune responses as well as in the clearance of immune complexes, autoreactivity to complement components may have considerable pathological consequences. Autoantibodies against the central complement component C3 have been reported in systemic lupus erythematosus, but their molecular mechanism and functional relevance are not well understood. The objective of this study was to evaluate the frequency and the functional properties of the anti-C3 autoantibodies. Anti-C3 autoantibodies were measured in plasma of 39 LN patients, and identification of their epitopes on the C3 molecule was performed. By using surface plasmon resonance, we analyzed the influence of patient-derived IgG antibodies on the interaction of C3b with Factor B, Factor H, and complement receptor 1. The capacity of these antibodies to dysregulate the C3 convertase on the surface of endothelial cell was measured by flow cytometry. Here we report that the frequency of anti-C3 autoantibodies in LN is ∼30%. They inhibited interactions of the negative complement regulators Factor H and complement receptor 1 with C3b. An enhanced C3 deposition was also observed on human endothelial cells in the presence of C3 autoantibodies. In addition, anti-C3 autoantibody levels correlated with disease activity. In conclusion, the anti-C3 autoantibodies in LN may contribute to the autoimmune pathology by their capacity to overactivate the complement system."

The objectives of this study were to quantify the spatial extent of contemporary suitable habitat for acid- and thermally sensitive aquatic species and to forecast future habitat loss resulting from expected temperature increases on national forest lands in the southern Appalachian Mountain region. The goal of this study was to help watershed managers identify and assess stream reaches that are potentially vulnerable to warming, acidification, or both. To our knowledge, these results represent the first regional assessment of aquatic habitat suitability with respect to the combined effects of stream water temperature and acid-base status in the United States. Statistical models were developed to predict July mean daily maximum water temperatures and air-water temperature relations to determine potential changes in future stream water temperatures. The length of stream considered suitable habitat for acid- and thermally sensitive species, based on temperature and acid neutralizing capacity thresholds of 20°C and 50 μeq/L, was variable throughout the national forests considered. Stream length displaying temperature above 20°C was generally more than five times greater than the length predicted to have acid neutralizing capacity below 50 μeq/L. It was uncommon for these two stressors to occur within the same stream segment. Results suggested that species’ distributional shifts to colder, higher elevation habitats under a warming climate can be constrained by acidification of headwater streams. The approach used in this study can be applied to evaluate climate change impacts to stream water resources in other regions."
https://openalex.org/W1942275012,"Brazil has presided over the most comprehensive agrarian reform frontier colonization program on Earth, in which ~1.2 million settlers have been translocated by successive governments since the 1970’s, mostly into forested hinterlands of Brazilian Amazonia. These settlements encompass 5.3% of this ~5 million km2 region, but have contributed with 13.5% of all land conversion into agropastoral land uses. The Brazilian Federal Agrarian Agency (INCRA) has repeatedly claimed that deforestation in these areas largely predates the sanctioned arrival of new settlers. Here, we quantify rates of natural vegetation conversion across 1911 agrarian settlements allocated to 568 Amazonian counties and compare fire incidence and deforestation rates before and after the official occupation of settlements by migrant farmers. The timing and spatial distribution of deforestation and fires in our analysis provides irrefutable chronological and spatially explicit evidence of agropastoral conversion both inside and immediately outside agrarian settlements over the last decade. Deforestation rates are strongly related to local human population density and road access to regional markets. Agrarian settlements consistently accelerated rates of deforestation and fires, compared to neighboring areas outside settlements, but within the same counties. Relocated smallholders allocated to forest areas undoubtedly operate as pivotal agents of deforestation, and most of the forest clearance occurs in the aftermath of government-induced migration."

In the biochemical and protein interaction assays, representative GTPases from Rho, Ras, and Rab, the three most generic subfamilies of the GTPases, were probed, while in the functional assays, physiological processes regulated by each of the three subfamilies of the GTPases were examined. The chemical functionalities essential for the activity of the compound were identified through structural derivatization. The compound is validated as a useful molecular probe upon which GTPase-targeting inhibitors with drug potentials might be developed."
https://openalex.org/W1894074469,"Background Long-stemmed and semi-dwarf cultivars of triticale were exposed to water stress at tillering, heading and anthesis stage. Quantitative determination of free and cell wall-bound polyamines, i.e. agmatine, cadaverine, putrescine, spermidine and spermine, was supplemented with an analysis of quantitative relationships between free and cell wall-bound polyamines. Results The content of free and cell wall-bound polyamines varied depending on the development stage, both under optimal and water stress conditions. Drought-induced increase in free agmatine content was observed at all developmental stages in long-stemmed cultivar. A depletion of spermidine and putrescine was also reported in this cultivar, and spermidine was less abundant in semi-dwarf cultivar exposed to drought stress at the three analyzed developmental stages. Changes in the content of the other free polyamines did not follow a steady pattern reflecting the developmental stages. On the contrary, the content of cell wall-bound polyamines gradually increased from tillering, through heading and until anthesis period. Conclusion Water stress seemed to induce a progressive decrease in the content of free polyamines and an accumulation of cell wall-bound polyamines."

https://openalex.org/W1820496084,"This paper examines relationships between religion and two forms of homonegativity across 43 European countries using a bivariate response binary logistic multilevel model. The model analyzes effects of religious believing, belonging and practice on two response variables: a) a moral rejection of homosexuality as a practice and b) intolerance toward homosexuals as a group. The findings indicate that both forms of homonegativity are prevalent in Europe. Traditional doctrinal religious believing (belief in a personal God) is positively related to a moral rejection of homosexuality but to a much lesser extent associated with intolerance toward homosexuals as a group. Members of religious denominations are more likely than non-members to reject homosexuality as morally wrong and to reject homosexuals as neighbors. The analysis found significant differences between denominations that are likely context-dependent. Attendance at religious services is positively related to homonegativity in a majority of countries. The findings vary considerably across countries: Religion is more strongly related to homonegativity in Western than in Eastern Europe. In the post-soviet countries homonegativity appears to be largely a secular phenomenon. National contexts of high religiosity, high perceived government corruption, high income inequality and shortcomings in the implementation of gay rights in the countries' legislations are statistically related to higher levels of both moralistic homonegativity and intolerance toward homosexuals as a group."

https://openalex.org/W1920444788,"The analysis of heart rate variability (HRV) has been shown as a promising non-invasive technique for assessing the cardiac autonomic modulation in trauma. The aim of this study was to evaluate HRV during hemorrhagic shock and fluid resuscitation, comparing to traditional hemodynamic and metabolic parameters.Twenty anesthetized and mechanically ventilated pigs were submitted to hemorrhagic shock (60% of estimated blood volume) and evaluated for 60 minutes without fluid replacement. Surviving animals were treated with Ringer solution and evaluated for an additional period of 180 minutes. HRV metrics (time and frequency domain) as well as hemodynamic and metabolic parameters were evaluated in survivors and non-survivors animals.Seven of the 20 animals died during hemorrhage and initial fluid resuscitation. All animals presented an increase in time-domain HRV measures during haemorrhage and fluid resuscitation restored baseline values. Although not significantly, normalized low-frequency and LF/HF ratio decreased during early stages of haemorrhage, recovering baseline values later during hemorrhagic shock, and increased after fluid resuscitation. Non-surviving animals presented significantly lower mean arterial pressure (43±7 vs 57±9 mmHg, P<0.05) and cardiac index (1.7±0.2 vs 2.6±0.5 L/min/m2, P<0.05), and higher levels of plasma lactate (7.2±2.4 vs 3.7±1.4 mmol/L, P<0.05), base excess (-6.8±3.3 vs -2.3±2.8 mmol/L, P<0.05) and potassium (5.3±0.6 vs 4.2±0.3 mmol/L, P<0.05) at 30 minutes after hemorrhagic shock compared with surviving animals.The HRV increased early during hemorrhage but none of the evaluated HRV metrics was able to discriminate survivors from non-survivors during hemorrhagic shock. Moreover, metabolic and hemodynamic variables were more reliable to reflect hemorrhagic shock severity than HRV metrics."
https://openalex.org/W1738359034,"Spain has implemented several in-pharmacy HIV testing programmes performed by pharmacists as part of their everyday routine. We aim to assess the feasibility and the main outcomes of three programmes implemented in three Spanish regions with different sociological profiles and also different epidemiology for HIV.The characteristics of the 24151 people tested between 2009 and 2013 at 74 urban pharmacies are studied. We compare the main outcomes of the programmes with those of each Regional HIV Surveillance System (RHSS) assessing the contribution to the total new diagnosis in each region and if priority groups are being reached.45.7% were heterosexual men (MSW), 14.4% men who have sex with men (MSM), and 27% women. The 35% were younger than 30 and 9.6% foreigners. The 52% were previously untested, and women were the most likely to be untested. The three programmes altogether diagnosed 226 people, resulting in a global prevalence of 0.9% (95%CI: 0.8-1.1); 3.4% in MSM (95%CI: 2.8-4.0). The prevalence among Spaniards was 0.8% (0.7-1.0) vs. 2.2 (1.6-2.9) among foreigners. The percentages of MSM diagnosed by all three programmes were higher than the one reported by their respective RHSS. Thirty four percent of the reactive MSM and the 71.4% of the reactive MSW did not have a previous HIV test although big testing history differences were observed across the programmes. Altogether, these services contributed with the 10.6% of all HIV diagnoses in these regions.In-pharmacy HIV testing programmes are a valuable testing option, having been able to uncover 1 out of 10 the new diagnoses reported in each region. They showed a good capacity of reaching and diagnosing previously untested populations, not only a priority population such as MSM but also heterosexual population who are more affected by delayed diagnosis. They seem to be particularly suitable for regions without large cities and specific HIV diagnostic services."
https://openalex.org/W2299882708,"Methyl-CpG binding protein 2 (MeCP2) is a nuclear protein with important roles in regulating chromatin structure and gene expression, and mutations in MECP2 cause Rett syndrome (RTT). Within the MeCP2 protein sequence, the nuclear localization signal (NLS) is reported to reside between amino acids 255-271, and certain RTT-causing mutations overlap with the MeCP2 NLS, suggesting that they may alter nuclear localization. One such mutation, R270X, is predicted to interfere with the localization of MeCP2, but recent in vivo studies have demonstrated that this mutant remains entirely nuclear. To clarify the mechanism of MeCP2 nuclear import, we isolated proteins that interact with the NLS and identified karyopherin α 3 (KPNA3 or Kap-α3) and karyopherin α 4 (KPNA4 or Kap-α4) as key binding partners of MeCP2. MeCP2-R270X did not interact with KPNA4, consistent with a requirement for an intact NLS in this interaction. However, this mutant retains binding to KPNA3, accounting for the normal localization of MeCP2-R270X to the nucleus. These data provide a mechanism for MeCP2 nuclear import and have implications for the design of therapeutics aimed at modulating the function of MeCP2 in RTT patients."
https://openalex.org/W2260550123,"Cytochrome bc1 is one of the key enzymes of many bioenergetic systems. Its operation involves a large scale movement of a head domain of iron-sulfur protein (ISP-HD), which functionally connects the catalytic quinol oxidation Qo site in cytochrome b with cytochrome c1. The Qo site under certain conditions can generate reactive oxygen species in the reaction scheme depending on the actual position of ISP-HD in respect to the Qo site. Here, using a bacterial system, we show that mutation G167P in cytochrome b shifts the equilibrium distribution of ISP-HD toward positions remote from the Qo site. This renders cytochrome bc1 non-functional in vivo. This effect is remediated by addition of alanine insertions (1Ala and 2Ala) in the neck region of the ISP subunit. These insertions, which on their own shift the equilibrium distribution of ISP-HD in the opposite direction (i.e. toward the Qo site), also act in this manner in the presence of G167P. Changes in the equilibrium distribution of ISP-HD in G167P lead to an increased propensity of cytochrome bc1 to generate superoxide, which becomes evident when the concentration of quinone increases. This result corroborates the recently proposed model in which “semireverse” electron transfer back to the Qo site, occurring when ISP-HD is remote from the site, favors reactive oxygen species production. G167P suggests possible molecular effects of S151P (corresponding in sequence to G167P) identified as a mitochondrial disease-related mutation in human cytochrome b.

https://openalex.org/W1678808496,"Research Question Preterm birth (PTB) is the leading cause of perinatal mortality worldwide, with the greatest burden occurring in resource-constrained settings. Based on the hypothesis that altered placental angiogenesis and inflammation early in pregnancy lead to PTB, we examined whether levels of inflammatory and angiogenic mediators, measured early in pregnancy, were predictive of spontaneous PTB (sPTB). Study Design Plasma samples were collected from a prospective cohort of primigravid Tanzanian women between 12–27 weeks gestation. A panel of 18 markers was screened on a training cohort of 426 women. Markers associated with sPTB in the training cohort were repeated in a test cohort of 628 women. All markers were measured by ELISA. Findings In both the training and test cohorts plasma levels of IL-18BP, sICAM-1, sEndoglin and CHI3L1 were elevated and Leptin was lower at enrollment in women who subsequently experienced sPTB. In multivariate analysis women with plasma levels of CHI3L1, C5a, sICAM-1, AngptL3, sEndgolin, sFlt-1 and IL-18BP in the highest quartile had an increased risk of sPTB compared with those in the lowest quartile. Women with Leptin and Ang2 in the highest quartile had a reduced risk of sPTB compared with women in the lowest quartile. Implications Levels of angiogenic and inflammatory mediators measured at mid-pregnancy were associated with subsequent sPTB. These findings provide insight into mechanisms underlying sPTB and suggest biomarkers that may have clinical utility in risk-stratifying pregnancies."

For reasons that are largely unknown, patients with the same clinical and pathologic staging have heterogeneous response to treatment and different probability of recurrence and survival, with patients with Human Papillomavirus (HPV)-positive oropharyngeal tumors having the most favorable survival. To gain insight into the complexity of OSCC and to identify potential chromosomal changes that may be associated with OSCC mortality, we used Affymtrix 6.0 SNP arrays to examine paired DNA from peripheral blood and tumor cell populations isolated by laser capture microdissection to assess genome-wide loss of heterozygosity (LOH) and DNA copy number aberration (CNA) and their associations with risk factors, tumor characteristics, and oral cancer-specific mortality among 75 patients with HPV-negative OSCC. We found a highly heterogeneous and complex genomic landscape of HPV-negative tumors, and identified regions in 4q, 8p, 9p and 11q that seem to play an important role in oral cancer biology and survival from this disease. If confirmed, these findings could assist in designing personalized treatment or in the creation of models to predict survival in patients with HPV-negative OSCC."
https://openalex.org/W1051817145,"The neuroinflammation associated with multiple sclerosis involves activation of astrocytes that secrete and respond to inflammatory mediators such as IL-1. IL-1 stimulates expression of many chemokines, including C-C motif ligand (CCL) 5, that recruit immune cells, but it also stimulates sphingosine kinase-1, an enzyme that generates sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P), a bioactive lipid mediator essential for inflammation. We found that whereas S1P promotes IL-1-induced expression of IL-6, it inhibits IL-1-induced CCL5 expression in astrocytes. This inhibition is mediated by the S1P receptor (S1PR)-2 via an inhibitory G—dependent mechanism. Consistent with this surprising finding, infiltration of macrophages into sites of inflammation increased significantly in S1PR2–/– animals. However, activation of NF-κB, IFN regulatory f actor-1, and MAPKs, all of which regulate CCL5 expression in response to IL-1, was not diminished by the S1P in astrocytes. Instead, S1PR2 stimulated inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate-dependent Ca++ release and Elk-1 phosphorylation and enhanced c-Fos expression. In our study, IL-1 induced the IFNβ production that supports CCL5 expression. An intriguing finding was that S1P induced c-Fos-inhibited CCL5 directly and also indirectly through inhibition of the IFN-β amplification loop. We propose that in addition to S1PR1, which promotes inflammation, S1PR2 mediates opposing inhibitory functions that limit CCL5 expression and diminish the recruitment of immune cells.—Yester, J.

https://openalex.org/W1620207771,"Nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs) play an important role in regulating appetite and have been shown to do so by influencing neural activity in the hypothalamus. To shed light on the hypothalamic circuits governing acetylcholine’s (ACh) regulation of appetite this study investigated the influence of hypothalamic nAChRs expressing the α4 subunit. We found that antagonizing the α4β2 nAChR locally in the lateral hypothalamus with di-hydro-ß-erythroidine (DHβE), an α4 nAChR antagonist with moderate affinity, caused an increase in food intake following free access to food after a 12 hour fast, compared to saline-infused animals. Immunocytochemical analysis revealed that orexin/hypocretin (HO), oxytocin, and tyrosine hydroxylase (TH)-containing neurons in the A13 and A12 of the hypothalamus expressed the nAChR α4 subunit in varying amounts (34%, 42%, 50%, and 51%, respectively) whereas melanin concentrating hormone (MCH) neurons did not, suggesting that DHβE-mediated increases in food intake may be due to a direct activation of specific hypothalamic circuits. Systemic DHβE (2 mg/kg) administration similarly increased food intake following a 12 hour fast. In these animals a subpopulation of orexin/hypocretin neurons showed elevated activity compared to control animals and MCH neuronal activity was overall lower as measured by expression of the immediate early gene marker for neuronal activity cFos. However, oxytocin neurons in the paraventricular hypothalamus and TH-containing neurons in the A13 and A12 did not show differential activity patterns. These results indicate that various neurochemically distinct hypothalamic populations are under the influence of α4β2 nAChRs and that cholinergic inputs to the lateral hypothalamus can affect satiety signals through activation of local α4β2 nAChR-mediated transmission."
https://openalex.org/W1941061338,"Objective The relationship between mechanical stress and radiographic progression in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is unclear. The assumption is that mechanical stress is greater in the dominant hand. Therefore, the aim of the present study was to compare the presence and progression of erosions and joint space narrowing (JSN) in the dominant and non-dominant hand. Methods Data from 194 patients recently diagnosed with seropositive RA, and with hand radiographs taken at the time of diagnosis and at 2-year follow-up, were analyzed retrospectively. Radiographs were scored using the van der Heijde-modified Sharp Score (HSS) method. Each joint group within each hand was rated separately by two independent examiners in a double-blinded manner. Results One hundred and ninety-four patients were enrolled (80% female, 88% positive rheumatoid factor, 92% positive anti-citrullinated protein antibody, and 95.4% right-handed). The baseline, follow-up erosion and JSN HSS were significantly higher in the dominant hand than in the non-dominant hand. The annual rate of radiographic progression was also higher in the dominant hand. The erosive progression in the wrist joints varied significantly according to handedness, but the erosion in the proximal interphalangeal joints and metacarpophalangeal joints was similar in both hands. The radiographic progression was associated with the dominant hand, an abnormal baseline C-reactive protein level, and joint damage at baseline. There was no significant difference in bone mineral density between the right and left hands. Conclusion Radiological damage was worse and progressed faster in the dominant hand, suggesting that mechanical stress is associated with radiographic joint damage in early and active RA."

To determine the direct relationship between echogenicity and GFR, we retrospectively analyzed 91 patients with a solitary functioning kidney under the age of 10, who underwent ultrasonography and serum cystatin C evaluation on a single day between January 2013 and December 2014. Echogenicity was quantified as previously reported. Echogenicity and kidney length were correlated with age-matched values of serum cystatin C-based GFR. Evaluation was performed at a median age of 17.1 months. GFR was low for age in eight of 54 right solitary kidney patients and four of 37 left solitary kidney patients. The right kidney-liver ratio was significantly elevated in the right decreased GFR group, while the left kidney-spleen ratio was not different in the left decreased GFR group. Age-matched longitudinal kidney length ratios were similar between the decreased and normal GFR groups for both sides. This is the first report to objectively prove the relationship between echogenicity and renal function in patients with a right solitary kidney. The right kidney-liver echogenicity ratio, measured objectively, showed feasibility in clinical practice as it showed a close relationship with decreased renal function when increased. However, absolute kidney echogenicity values, or the left kidney-spleen echogenicity ratio, were not independent markers for decreased renal function."
https://openalex.org/W1901761056,"Coastal plants with simple linear distribution ranges along coastlines provide a suitable system for improving our understanding of patterns of intra-specific distributional history and genetic variation. Due to the combination of high seed longevity and high dispersibility of seeds via seawater, we hypothesized that wild radish would poorly represent phylogeographic structure at the local scale. On the other hand, we also hypothesized that wild radish populations might be geographically differentiated, as has been exhibited by their considerable phenotypic variations along the islands of Japan. We conducted nuclear DNA microsatellite loci and chloroplast DNA haplotype analyses for 486 samples and 144 samples, respectively, from 18 populations to investigate the phylogeographic structure of wild radish in Japan. Cluster analysis supported the existence of differential genetic structures between the Ryukyu Islands and mainland Japan populations. A significant strong pattern of isolation by distance and significant evidence of a recent bottleneck were detected. The chloroplast marker analysis resulted in the generation of eight haplotypes, of which two haplotypes (A and B) were broadly distributed in most wild radish populations. High levels of variation in microsatellite loci were identified, whereas cpDNA displayed low levels of genetic diversity within populations. Our results indicate that the Kuroshio Current would have contributed to the sculpting of the phylogeographic structure by shaping genetic gaps between isolated populations. In addition, the Tokara Strait would have created a geographic barrier between the Ryukyu Islands and mainland Japan. Finally, extant habitat disturbances (coastal erosion), migration patterns (linear expansion), and geographic characteristics (small islands and sea currents) have influenced the expansion and historical population dynamics of wild radish. Our study is the first to record the robust phylogeographic structure in wild radish between the Ryukyu Islands and mainland Japan, and might provide new insight into the genetic differentiation of coastal plants across islands."
https://openalex.org/W1661585058,"Background Recent genomic information has revealed that neuroglobin and cytoglobin are the two principal lineages of vertebrate hemoglobins, with the latter encompassing the familiar myoglobin and α-globin/β-globin tetramer hemoglobin, and several minor groups. In contrast, very little is known about hemoglobins in echinoderms, a phylum of exclusively marine organisms closely related to vertebrates, beyond the presence of coelomic hemoglobins in sea cucumbers and brittle stars. We identified about 50 hemoglobins in sea urchin, starfish and sea cucumber genomes and transcriptomes, and used Bayesian inference to carry out a molecular phylogenetic analysis of their relationship to vertebrate sequences, specifically, to assess the hypothesis that the neuroglobin and cytoglobin lineages are also present in echinoderms. Results The genome of the sea urchin Strongylocentrotus purpuratus encodes several hemoglobins, including a unique chimeric 14-domain globin, 2 androglobin isoforms and a unique single androglobin domain protein. Other strongylocentrotid genomes appear to have similar repertoires of globin genes. We carried out molecular phylogenetic analyses of 52 hemoglobins identified in sea urchin, brittle star and sea cucumber genomes and transcriptomes, using different multiple sequence alignment methods coupled with Bayesian and maximum likelihood approaches. The results demonstrate that there are two major globin lineages in echinoderms, which are related to the vertebrate neuroglobin and cytoglobin lineages. Furthermore, the brittle star and sea cucumber coelomic hemoglobins appear to have evolved independently from the cytoglobin lineage, similar to the evolution of erythroid oxygen binding globins in cyclostomes and vertebrates. Conclusion The presence of echinoderm globins related to the vertebrate neuroglobin and cytoglobin lineages suggests that the split between neuroglobins and cytoglobins occurred in the deuterostome ancestor shared by echinoderms and vertebrates."

Thirteen adults with CP underwent bilateral masseter and temporalis neuromuscular electrical stimulation (NMES) therapy. The effects on the masticatory muscles and sleep variables were evaluated using electromyography (EMG) and polysomnography (PSG), respectively, prior and after 2 months of NMES. EMG consisted of 3 tests in different positions: rest, mouth opening and maximum clenching effort (MCE). EMG values in the rest position were 100% higher than values recorded prior to therapy for all muscles analyzed (p < 0.05); mean mouth opening increased from 38.0 ± 8.0 to 44.0 ± 10.0 cm (p = 0.03). A significant difference in MCE was found only for the right masseter.

https://openalex.org/W1513401228,"Langerhans cell histiocytosis (LCH) is a rare disease caused by the clonal accumulation of dendritic Langerhans cells, which is often accompanied by osteolytic lesions. It has been reported that osteoclast-like cells play a major role in the pathogenic bone destruction seen in patients with LCH and these cells are postulated to originate from the fusion of DCs. However, due to the lack of reliable animal models the pathogenesis of LCH is still poorly understood. In this study, we have established a mouse model of histiocytosis- recapitulating human disease for osteolytic lesions seen in LCH patients. At 12 weeks after birth, severe bone lesions were observed in our multisystem histiocytosis (Mushi) model, when CD8α conventional dendritic cells (DCs) are transformed (MuTuDC) and accumulate. Most importantly, our study demonstrates that bone loss in LCH can be accounted for the transdifferentiation of MuTuDCs into functional osteoclasts both in vivo and in vitro. Moreover, we have shown that injected MuTuDCs reverse the osteopetrotic phenotype of oc/oc mice in vivo. In conclusion, our results support a crucial role of DCs in bone lesions in histiocytosis patients. Furthermore, our new model of LCH based on adoptive transfer of MuTuDC lines, leading to bone lesions within 1-2 weeks, will be an important tool for investigating the pathophysiology of this disease and ultimately for evaluating the potential of anti-resorptive drugs for the treatment of bone lesions."

Although PELP1 is known to be regulated by estrogens in vitro, its association with estrogen levels within the tissue of breast cancer patients has not previously been assessed. Here, we determined PELP1 mRNA expression levels in paired samples of normal and malignant breast tissue obtained from 32 postmenopausal and 11 premenopausal women. In the total sample set, PELP1 levels were higher in tumors compared to normal breast tissue (P = 0.041). Among postmenopausal women, PELP1 tumor levels correlated positively with estrone (E1) and estradiol (E2) levels in both normal tissue (r = 0.543, P = 0.003 and r = 0.601, P = 0.001, respectively) and plasma (r = 0.392, P = 0.053 and r = 0.403, P = 0.046, respectively). Analyzing all ER+ tumors (n = 26), PELP1 correlated positively with E1 and E2 in tumor tissue (r = 0.562, P = 0.003 and r = 0.411, P = 0.037, respectively) and normal tissue (r = 0.461, P = 0.018 and r = 0.427, P = 0.030, respectively) in addition to plasma E1, E2 and estrone sulphate (E1S) concentrations (r = 0.576, P = 0.003, r = 0.456, P = 0.025 and r = 0.406, P = 0.049, respectively). Finally, PELP1 correlated positively with ER mRNA (ESR1) (r = 0.553, P = 0.026) in ER+ tumors, whereas a negative association between PELP1 and ESR1 (r = -0.733, P = 0.010) was observed in ER- breast tumors. Taken together, tumor PELP1 mRNA expression is associated with estrogen levels in breast cancer, suggesting a potentially important role of PELP1 in ER+ breast cancer growth in vivo."
https://openalex.org/W1923146424,"Maraviroc activity against HIV-2, a virus naturally resistant to different HIV-1 antiretroviral drugs, has been recently demonstrated. The aim of this study was to assess HIV-2 susceptibility to cenicriviroc, a novel, once-daily, dual CCR5 and CCR2 antagonist that has completed Phase 2b development in HIV-1 infection.Cenicriviroc phenotypic activity has been tested using a PBMC phenotypic susceptibility assay against four R5-, one X4- and one dual-tropic HIV-2 clinical primary isolates. All isolates were obtained by co-cultivation of PHA-activated PBMC from distinct HIV-2-infected CCR5-antagonist-naïve patients included in the French HIV-2 cohort and were previously tested for maraviroc susceptibility using the same protocol. HIV-2 tropism was determined by phenotypic assay using Ghost(3) cell lines.Regarding the 4 R5 HIV-2 clinical isolates tested, effective concentration 50% EC50 for cenicriviroc were 0.03, 0.33, 0.45 and 0.98 nM, similar to those observed with maraviroc: 1.13, 0.58, 0.48 and 0.68 nM, respectively. Maximum percentages of inhibition (MPI) of cenicriviroc were 94, 94, 93 and 98%, similar to those observed with maraviroc (93, 90, 82, 100%, respectively). The dual- and X4-tropic HIV-2 strains were resistant to cenicriviroc with EC50 >1000 nM and MPI at 33% and 4%, respectively.In this first study assessing HIV-2 susceptibility to cenicriviroc, we observed an in vitro activity against HIV-2 R5-tropic strains similar to that observed with maraviroc. Thus, cenicriviroc may offer a once-daily treatment opportunity in the limited therapeutic arsenal for HIV-2. Clinical studies are warranted."
https://openalex.org/W1963293473,"Bordetella bronchiseptica is genetically related to B. pertussis and B. parapertussis, which cause respiratory tract infections in humans. These pathogens possess a large number of virulence factors, including the type III secretion system (T3SS), which is required for the delivery of effectors into the host cells. In a previous study, we identified a transcriptional regulator, BspR, that is involved in the regulation of the T3SS-related genes in response to iron-starved conditions. A unique feature of BspR is that this regulator is secreted into the extracellular milieu via the T3SS. To further characterize the role of BspR in extracellular localization, we constructed various truncated derivatives of BspR and investigated their translocation into the host cells using conventional translocation assays. In this study, the effector translocation was evaluated by the T3SS of enteropathogenic E. coli (EPEC), since the exogenous expression of BspR triggers severe repression of the Bordetella T3SS expression. The results of the translocation assays using the EPEC T3SS showed that the N-terminal 150 amino acid (aa) residues of BspR are sufficient for translocation into the host cells in a T3SS-dependent manner. In addition, exogenous expression of BspR in HeLa cells demonstrated that the N-terminal 100 aa residues are involved in the nuclear localization. In contrast, the N-terminal 54 aa residues are sufficient for the extracellular secretion into the bacterial culture supernatant via the EPEC T3SS. Thus, BspR is not only a transcriptional regulator in bacteria cytosol, but also functions as an effector that translocates into the nuclei of infected host cells."
https://openalex.org/W1701464274,"Objectives Visuo-spatial neglect and vestibular disorders have common clinical findings and involve the same cortical areas. We questioned (1) whether visuo-spatial hemineglect is not only a disorder of spatial attention but may also reflect a disorder of higher cortical vestibular function and (2) whether a vestibular tone imbalance due to an acute peripheral dysfunction can also cause symptoms of neglect or extinction. Therefore, patients with an acute unilateral peripheral vestibular failure (VF) were tested for symptoms of hemineglect. Methods Twenty-eight patients with acute VF were assessed for signs of vestibular deficits and spatial neglect using clinical measures and various common standardized paper-pencil tests. Neglect severity was evaluated further with the Center of Cancellation method. Pathological neglect test scores were correlated with the degree of vestibular dysfunction determined by the subjective visual vertical and caloric testing. Results Three patients showed isolated pathological scores in one or the other neglect test, either ipsilesionally or contralesionally to the VF. None of the patients fulfilled the diagnostic criteria of spatial hemineglect or extinction. Conclusions A vestibular tone imbalance due to unilateral failure of the vestibular endorgan does not cause spatial hemineglect, but evidence indicates it causes mild attentional deficits in both visual hemifields."

https://openalex.org/W1951612752,"Nurses and other healthcare workers frequently experience belief conflict, one of the most important, new stress-related problems in both academic and clinical fields.In this study, using a sample of 1,683 nursing practitioners, we developed The Assessment of Belief Conflict in Relationship-14 (ABCR-14), a new scale that assesses belief conflict in the healthcare field. Standard psychometric procedures were used to develop and test the scale, including a qualitative framework concept and item-pool development, item reduction, and scale development. We analyzed the psychometric properties of ABCR-14 according to entropy, polyserial correlation coefficient, exploratory factor analysis, confirmatory factor analysis, average variance extracted, Cronbach's alpha, Pearson product-moment correlation coefficient, and multidimensional item response theory (MIRT).The results of the analysis supported a three-factor model consisting of 14 items. The validity and reliability of ABCR-14 was suggested by evidence from high construct validity, structural validity, hypothesis testing, internal consistency reliability, and concurrent validity. The result of the MIRT offered strong support for good item response of item slope parameters and difficulty parameters. However, the ABCR-14 Likert scale might need to be explored from the MIRT point of view. Yet, as mentioned above, there is sufficient evidence to support that ABCR-14 has high validity and reliability.The ABCR-14 demonstrates good psychometric properties for nursing belief conflict. Further studies are recommended to confirm its application in clinical practice."
https://openalex.org/W1953461747,"Oxothiazolidine carboxylic acid is a prodrug of cysteine that acts as an anti-diabetic agent via insulin secretion and the formation of the Ca2+-mobilizing second messenger, cyclic ADP-ribose (cADPR). Here we show that a hybrid compound, arginine thiazolidine carboxylate (ATC), increases cytoplasmic Ca2+ in pancreatic β-cells, and that the ATC-induced Ca2+ signals result from the sequential formation of two Ca2+-mobilizing second messengers: nicotinic acid adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NAADP) and cADPR. Our data demonstrate that ATC has potent insulin-releasing properties, due to the additive action of its two components; thiazolidine carboxylate (TC) and L-arginine. TC increases glutathione (GSH) levels, resulting in cAMP production, followed by a cascade pathway of NAADP/nitric oxide (NO)/cGMP/cADPR synthesis. L-arginine serves as the substrate for NO synthase (NOS), which results in cADPR synthesis via cGMP formation. Neuronal NOS is specifically activated in pancreatic β-cells upon ATC treatment. These results suggest that ATC is an ideal candidate as an anti-diabetic, capable of modulating the physiological Ca2+ signalling pathway to stimulate insulin secretion."
https://openalex.org/W2146708263,"Successful gamete production is ensured by meiotic quality control, a process in which germ cells that fail in bivalent chromosome formation are eliminated during meiotic prophase. To date, numerous meiotic mutants have been isolated in a variety of model organisms, using defects associated with a failure in bivalent formation as hallmarks of the mutant. Presumably, the meiotic quality control mechanism in those mutants is overwhelmed. In these mutants, all germ cells fail in bivalent formation, and a subset of cells seem to survive the elimination process and develop into gametes. It is possible that mutants that are partially defective in bivalent formation were missed in past genetic screens, because no evident meiotic defects associated with failure in bivalent formation would have been detectable. Meiotic quality control effectively eliminates most failed germ cells, leaving predominately successful ones. Here, we provide evidence supporting this possibility. The Caenorhabditis elegans mrg-1 loss-of-function mutant does not appear to be defective in bivalent formation in diakinesis oocytes. However, defects in homologous chromosome pairing and synapsis during the preceding meiotic prophase, prerequisites for successful bivalent formation, were observed in most, but not all, germ cells. Failed bivalent formation in the oocytes became evident once meiotic quality control was abrogated in the mrg-1 mutant. Both double-strand break repair and synapsis checkpoints are partly responsible for eliminating failed germ cells in the mrg-1 mutant. Interestingly, removal of both checkpoint activities from the mrg-1 mutant is not sufficient to completely suppress the increased germline apoptosis, suggesting the presence of a novel meiotic checkpoint mechanism."
https://openalex.org/W1775969770,"The present study aimed to explore the inter-relationships among maternal death, household economic status after the event, and potential influencing factors.We conducted a prospective cohort study of households that had experienced maternal death (n = 195) and those that experienced childbirth without maternal death (n = 384) in rural China. All the households were interviewed after the event occurred and were followed up 12 months later. Structural equation modeling was used to test the relationship model, utilizing income and expenditure per capita in the following year after the event as the main outcome variables, maternal death as the predictor, and direct costs, the amount of money offset by positive and negative coping strategies, whether the husband remarried, and whether the newborn was alive as the mediators.In the following year after the event, the path analysis revealed a direct effect from maternal death to lower income per capita (standardized coefficient = -0.43, p = 0.041) and to lower expenditure per capita (standardized coefficient = -0.51, p<0.001). A significant indirect effect was found from maternal death to lower income and expenditure per capita mediated by the influencing factors of higher direct costs, less money from positive coping methods, more money from negative coping, and the survival of the newborn.This study analyzed the direct and indirect effects of maternal death on a household economy. The results provided evidence for better understanding the mechanism of how this event affects a household economy and provided a reference for social welfare policies to target the most vulnerable households that have suffered from maternal deaths."
