This difficulty is no longer insuperable, and in the light of new data and a critical review we now believe that the structure interprets the whole behaviour of strychnine better than any other."

https://openalex.org/W2005377391,"THE word 'plasticity' although one which has attained a state almost of ubiquity in several branches of applied physics and industrial chemistry, has, according to Scott Blair1, never been given a quantitative and dimensional definition. In the technical literature a group of quantitative 'plasticity numbers' have taken their place. Such expressions as the Williams plasticity number, or the Goodrich plasticity number (both used in rubber technology), have no quantitative meaning other than that of the reading of a particular type of testing equipment when used in a particular manner, and as such cannot be expressed in C.G.S. units."

https://openalex.org/W179759207,"Most procedures used for the separation of thyroxine from other iodinecontaining compounds of the thyroid gland are based on either the method of Harington and Randall (I) or that of Leland and Foster (2). In the former the thyroxine is separated from diiodotyrosine by precipitation in a slightly acid medium, whereas in Leland and Foster’s method thyroxine is extracted with butyl alcohol from an alkaline hydrolysate of thyroid tissue. Leland and Foster observed that their method yielded much lower values for the thyroxine content of thyroid material than did the method of Harington and Randall; they attributed this to the presence of diiodotyrosine in the acid-insoluble fraction. Blau (3) modified the method of Leland and Foster by adjusting the alkaline hydrolysate to pH 3.5 to 4.0 before its extraction with butyl alcohol. The thyroxine values obtained by this modification are 10 to 20 per cent higher than those obtained by the original Leland and Foster method, but still much lower than those obtained by the acid precipitation procedure of Harington and Randall (4). The methods referred to above were designed for the analysis of relatively large amounts of thyroid tissue. Foster (5) subsequently adapted the butyl alcohol extraction procedure for the determination of the thyroxine content of the guinea pig thyroid. In the present communication a modification of Foster’s method is described. Data on the thyroxine content of the rat thyroid are also presented."

https://openalex.org/W2079374670,"OUR planet the earth is studied in many ways, some of which correspond roughly to the main divisions of universal science, for example, mechanics, physics and chemistry. Such specialized branches of the universal sciences are appropriately indicated by the prefix 'geo', giving the words 'geomechanics', 'geophysics' and 'geochemistry'. These are modelled on the old word 'geometry', which itself has long since lost its special association with the earth, to become the name of the universal science of the measurement and properties of space. Hence the need for another word ('geodesy') relating to the measurement of the 'figure' of the earth, which must be the basis of geography, the mapping of the earth. The meaning of geography has gradually become elaborated to include much more than graphical representation, and besides physical geography, which shades off into geophysics, covers studies that merge into economics, sociology and general biology."

The tests were made by the cylinder plate method of Heatley1, with watery extracts obtained by grinding up the mushroom or toadstool in a mortar with a little water. All the active extracts inhibited the growth of Staph. aureus, but extracts of only two fungi showed wider activity. Cortinarius rotundisporus and Psalliota xanthoderma produced extracts which inhibited not only the Gram-positive organism, Staph. aureus, but also the Gram-negative organism, Bact. typhosum, and the acid-fast organism, Myco. phlei."

https://openalex.org/W2051565801,"THERE is evidence that in certain parts of Ireland a degree of mineral deficiency exists in old pastures, and, from time to time, isolated cases of disorders which respond to supplemental mineral feeding occur. A more pronounced condition of mineral deficiency is now reported from County Offaly. Mr. J. O', county instructor in agriculture, and I are investigating the occurrence ; and our results to date show that, over considerable stretches, particularly of the semimoory type in that county, the old pastures supply insufficient phosphorus to meet the needs of the grazing animal."

https://openalex.org/W2002275342,"THE physiological activity of a single ovarian follicle is difficult to assess because assay of its fluid content does not entirely represent its functional capacity. No account is taken of the hormones within the cells of its wall. In fortuitous circumstances, an aberrant ovary containing but a single large follicle was observed in a baboon from which two complete ovaries, shown by serial section, had been removed in 1940. Subsequent oestrogen experiments, as originally reported1, showed that a daily dose of 0.4 mgm. of aestradiol benzoate was the minimum capable of producing optimum swelling of the sex skin, previously attained by both ovaries. Although these experiments were continued for two and a half years, after the first year bleeding did not occur following the withdrawal of oestrogen in any dose whatsoever."

The biochemical and microbiological investigations of Pears on and Smith3, and Smith and Baker4, have also shown that in the ox such micro-organisms may afford a major contribution to the synthesis of protein from non-protein nitrogen occurring in the rumen."

https://openalex.org/W1964067961,"OUR knowledge of the effects of antibacterial substances produced by or derived from bacteria or fungi continues to increase. A new antibacterial substance named 'bacitracin' has been described by B. A. Johnson, H. Anker and F. L. Meleney (Science, 102, 376, 1945 ; and see the Lancet, 641, Nov. 17, 1945). It is produced by a Gram-positive aerobic sporing rod, and the crude brew obtained inhibited a haemo-lytic streptococcus when it was diluted 1: 2,000 to 1: 10,000. Some of the most susceptible organisms were 3-hæmolytic streptococcus, pneumococcus, some clostridia, anaerobic staphylococci and some strains of anaerobic streptococci. Gram-negative organisms were not sensitive to it. 'Bacitracin' is soluble in water and butanol, unstable to alkali, stable to acid and to heating to 100° C. for fifteen minutes. Impure extracts were not toxic to animals and did not irritate the conjunctiva. A single intraperitoneal injection of it ensured the survival of 80 per cent of mice infected via the peritoneal cavity with a streptococcus, but 30-40 per cent also survived after a single subcutaneous injection and 80-90 per cent after subcutaneous injections repeated every three hours. Subcutaneous injections repeated every three hours ensured the survival of 80 per cent of guinea pigs infected with the gas-gangrene organisms, Clostridium welchii and C. septicum. It is claimed that local treatment of human infections caused by susceptible organisms are comparable to those of penicillin."

https://openalex.org/W2057135162,"THE recent publication1 of an examination of Svedberg's theory of molecular weight distribution, in which the theory is considered to be invalid, suggests that a treatment, similar in some of its details, might be of interest. This was prepared in 19442, and the conclusions agree with those of Johnston, Longuet-Higgins and Ogston1, and with those of Bull3. It seemed clear that the explanation of the imperfection of his theory given by Svedberg4, namely, that the mean molecular weights of the amino-acid residues in the different proteins were not the same, is inadequate, since, for example, the mean residue weights of zein and ovalbumin are in a ratio not far different from 1:1.1, while the molecular weights of the proteins themselves are in a ratio of approximately 1:1.3. Moreover, the arbitrary omission of gliadin, hordein and two haemocyanins from Svedberg's classification4 needs a better reason than the maintenance of his hypothesis. Further, the existence of proteins of lower molecular weights than the basic unit of 17,600 (such as ribonuclease and cytochrome-c at 13,000) is a serious complication to the theory, and there are certain groups, such as Svedberg's 'x 96' group, where the actual mean of the molecular weights cited is not even approximately that of the characteristic 'group value'."
https://openalex.org/W2066481059,"UNINCUBATED eggs were injected with 0.3–0.7 ml. of sodium thiocyanate of various concentrations (0.1 M, 0.5 M, 1 M) and incubated for 42–47 hours. The embryos thus developed showed a number of anomalies, first of all in the prosencephalon and partly in the mesencephalon; the metencephalon and myelencephalon being, in general, not so much affected. One of the most frequently observed anomalies of the latter was due to the abnormal closing of the neural tube: it seems that one of the neural folds was growing more quickly, thus being overlapped by the other (see section). This anomaly extended in various cases to the middle of the myelencephalon. Further changes were observed in the position of the heart, which was displaced, in extreme cases, into the precephalic region. No morpho-genetical changes of the somites were observed, though the number was lower (14–17) than that of normal embryos of the same age."
https://openalex.org/W2052647576,"FROM the days when prehistoric man first observed the 'fervent' liquor and experienced the aftereffects of a possibly too-potent brew, alcoholic beverages have played an important part in social history. The desire for variety in what we drink manifests itself at an early age, as evinced by the child's preference for coloured and 'fizzy' drinks. As an adult he frequently acquires a taste for a drink which in Britain justifies the term 'national beverage', namely, beer. With social aspects we are not here concerned ; as in a number of other cases, while moderation is harmless and even beneficial, excess is disastrous. None will dispute that the cause of true temperance, ably abetted by H.M. Commissioners of Excise, has made enormous strides."
