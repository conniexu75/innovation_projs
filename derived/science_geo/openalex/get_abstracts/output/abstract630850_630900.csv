https://openalex.org/W2924139971,"Nucleotide-binding, leucine-rich repeat receptors (NLRs) perceive pathogen effectors to trigger plant immunity. Biochemical mechanisms underlying plant NLR activation have until now remained poorly understood. We reconstituted an active complex containing the Arabidopsis coiled-coil NLR ZAR1, the pseudokinase RKS1, uridylated protein kinase PBL2, and 2′-deoxyadenosine 5′-triphosphate (dATP), demonstrating the oligomerization of the complex during immune activation. The cryo–electron microscopy structure reveals a wheel-like pentameric ZAR1 resistosome. Besides the nucleotide-binding domain, the coiled-coil domain of ZAR1 also contributes to resistosome pentamerization by forming an α-helical barrel that interacts with the leucine-rich repeat and winged-helix domains. Structural remodeling and fold switching during activation release the very N-terminal amphipathic α helix of ZAR1 to form a funnel-shaped structure that is required for the plasma membrane association, cell death triggering, and disease resistance, offering clues to the biochemical function of a plant resistosome."
https://openalex.org/W2927068340,"Pathogen recognition by nucleotide-binding (NB), leucine-rich repeat (LRR) receptors (NLRs) plays roles in plant immunity. The Xanthomonas campestris pv. campestris effector AvrAC uridylylates the Arabidopsis PBL2 kinase, and the latter (PBL2UMP) acts as a ligand to activate the NLR ZAR1 precomplexed with the RKS1 pseudokinase. Here we report the cryo-electron microscopy structures of ZAR1-RKS1 and ZAR1-RKS1-PBL2UMP in an inactive and intermediate state, respectively. The ZAR1LRR domain, compared with animal NLRLRR domains, is differently positioned to sequester ZAR1 in an inactive state. Recognition of PBL2UMP is exclusively through RKS1, which interacts with ZAR1LRR PBL2UMP binding stabilizes the RKS1 activation segment, which sterically blocks ZAR1 adenosine diphosphate (ADP) binding. This engenders a more flexible NB domain without conformational changes in the other ZAR1 domains. Our study provides a structural template for understanding plant NLRs."

Interactions between motor neurons and glia contribute to motor neuron loss, but the spatiotemporal ordering of molecular events that drive these processes in intact spinal tissue remains poorly understood. Here, we use spatial transcriptomics to obtain gene expression measurements of mouse spinal cords over the course of disease, as well as of postmortem tissue from ALS patients, to characterize the underlying molecular mechanisms in ALS. We identify pathway dynamics, distinguish regional differences between microglia and astrocyte populations at early time points, and discern perturbations in several transcriptional pathways shared between murine models of ALS and human postmortem spinal cords."
https://openalex.org/W2929712475,"Physiological needs produce motivational drives, such as thirst and hunger, that regulate behaviors essential to survival. Hypothalamic neurons sense these needs and must coordinate relevant brainwide neuronal activity to produce the appropriate behavior. We studied dynamics from ~24,000 neurons in 34 brain regions during thirst-motivated choice behavior in 21 mice as they consumed water and became sated. Water-predicting sensory cues elicited activity that rapidly spread throughout the brain of thirsty animals. These dynamics were gated by a brainwide mode of population activity that encoded motivational state. After satiation, focal optogenetic activation of hypothalamic thirst-sensing neurons returned global activity to the pre-satiation state. Thus, motivational states specify initial conditions that determine how a brainwide dynamical system transforms sensory input into behavioral output."
https://openalex.org/W2931347332,"A core question in evolutionary biology is whether convergent phenotypic evolution is driven by convergent molecular changes in proteins or regulatory regions. We combined phylogenomic, developmental, and epigenomic analysis of 11 new genomes of paleognathous birds, including an extinct moa, to show that convergent evolution of regulatory regions, more so than protein-coding genes, is prevalent among developmental pathways associated with independent losses of flight. A Bayesian analysis of 284,001 conserved noncoding elements, 60,665 of which are corroborated as enhancers by open chromatin states during development, identified 2355 independent accelerations along lineages of flightless paleognaths, with functional consequences for driving gene expression in the developing forelimb. Our results suggest that the genomic landscape associated with morphological convergence in ratites has a substantial shared regulatory component."
https://openalex.org/W2927881966,"Rho guanosine triphosphatases (GTPases) are master regulators of cell signaling, but how they are regulated depending on the cellular context is unclear. We found that the phospholipid phosphatidylserine acts as a developmentally controlled lipid rheostat that tunes Rho GTPase signaling in Arabidopsis . Live superresolution single-molecule imaging revealed that the protein Rho of Plants 6 (ROP6) is stabilized by phosphatidylserine into plasma membrane nanodomains, which are required for auxin signaling. Our experiments also revealed that the plasma membrane phosphatidylserine content varies during plant root development and that the level of phosphatidylserine modulates the quantity of ROP6 nanoclusters induced by auxin and hence downstream signaling, including regulation of endocytosis and gravitropism. Our work shows that variations in phosphatidylserine levels are a physiological process that may be leveraged to regulate small GTPase signaling during development."
https://openalex.org/W2927482818,"Group formation in living systems typically results from a delicate balance of repulsive, aligning, and attractive interactions. We found that a mere motility change of the individuals in response to the visual perception of their peers induces group formation and cohesion. We tested this principle in a real system of active particles whose motilities are controlled by an external feedback loop. For narrow fields of view, individuals gathered into cohesive nonpolarized groups without requiring active reorientations. For wider fields of view, cohesion could be achieved by lowering the response threshold. We expect this motility-induced cohesion mechanism to be relevant not only for the self-organization of living systems, but also for the design of robust and scalable autonomous systems."

A small number of these systems contain gaseous debris discs, visible through emission lines. We report a stable 123.4min periodic variation in the strength and shape of the CaII emission line profiles originating from the debris disc around the white dwarf SDSSJ122859.93+104032.9. We interpret this short-period signal as the signature of a solid body held together by its internal strength."
https://openalex.org/W2895023973,"In multicellular organisms, the entry into meiosis is a complex process characterized by increasing meiotic specialization. Using single-cell RNA sequencing, we reconstructed the developmental program into maize male meiosis. A smooth continuum of expression stages before meiosis was followed by a two-step transcriptome reorganization in leptotene, during which 26.7% of transcripts changed in abundance by twofold or more. Analysis of cell-cycle gene expression indicated that nearly all pregerminal cells proliferate, eliminating a stem-cell model to generate meiotic cells. Mutants defective in somatic differentiation or meiotic commitment expressed transcripts normally present in early meiosis after a delay; thus, the germinal transcriptional program is cell autonomous and can proceed despite meiotic failure."

Aβ is reported to have various impacts on the lipid bilayer, but a clearer picture of Aβ influence on membranes is required. Here, we use atomic force and transmission electron microscopies to image the impact of different isolated Aβ assembly types on lipid bilayers. We show that only oligomeric Aβ can profoundly disrupt the bilayer, visualized as widespread lipid extraction and subsequent deposition, which can be likened to an effect expected from the action of a detergent. We further show that Aβ oligomers cause widespread curvature and discontinuities within lipid vesicle membranes. In contrast, this detergent-like effect was not observed for Aβ monomers and fibers, although Aβ fibers did laterally associate and embed into the upper leaflet of the bilayer. The marked impact of Aβ oligomers on membrane integrity identified here reveals a mechanism by which these oligomers may be cytotoxic.

This hypothesis is centered on a small hydrophobic peptide, β-amyloid, which is typically 40 or 42 amino acids in length (Aβ40/42). The self-association of Aβ and subsequent interaction with the lipid bilayer are thought to cause disrupted synaptic function; the resulting loss of cellular homeostasis ultimately leads to hyperphosphorylation of tau, cell death, and dementia (1Selkoe D.J.

Alternatively, a carpeting effect of Aβ has been proposed, which is thought to result in a general increase in membrane conductance either by membrane thinning or a lateral spreading of lipid headgroups (8Kayed R.

Studies have also revealed that Aβ42 can extract and incorporate lipid into growing Aβ42 fibers by an effect likened to the action of a detergent, which has the potential to rupture the lipid bilayer (11Sasahara K.

Nevertheless, a clear picture of the impact of Aβ on membranes is lacking, perhaps in part due to insufficient assembly state characterization and separation of Aβ oligomers from monomers and fibers.

Here, we report a systematic investigation of the effects of both Aβ40 and Aβ42 isoforms on lipid bilayers. The Aβ isoforms have been studied in three broad assembly states: monomers, prefibrillar heterogeneous oligomeric assemblies, and fibers. We have employed AFM and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) to show that these different Aβ structures have profoundly different impacts on membrane integrity, which can explain the diverse effects reported. Lipid bilayers were deposited onto muscovite mica surfaces from an aqueous mixture of phosphatidylcholine (PC), cholesterol, and GM1 ganglioside (68:30:2 by weight, a ratio chosen to mimic the typical composition of the extracellular face of a cellular membrane). A liposomal suspension in aqueous buffer was incubated with the negatively charged mica, allowing the lipid headgroups to adhere and fuse with the mica substrate to form a double-leaflet lipid bilayer. The remaining suspension was then blotted off the mica and air-dried. AFM images indicate this to be an effective method of generating flat, continuous patches of lipid bilayer with a sharp “cliff-edge” boundary between the membrane patch and lipid-free mica, as shown in Fig. S1. A mean bilayer height has been measured at 4.6 ± 0.1 nm, as would be expected for this lipid composition. To understand the nature of the interactions between monomeric, oligomeric, and fibrillar Aβ40/42 with lipid bilayers, it is important to isolate and characterize the different Aβ assembly types, see “Experimental procedures”; Figs. S2 and S3 for details. We first deposited size-exclusion chromatographically–purified monomeric Aβ40 and Aβ42 preparations (10 μm) onto the lipid bilayer. After 60 min on the bilayer surface, the Aβ solution was blotted off, and the mica was allowed to air-dry for imaging. It is clear that neither monomeric Aβ42 nor Aβ40 has a detectable impact on the integrity of the bilayer, as seen in Fig. 1a and Fig. S4a. There is an even distribution of lipid with minimal disruption both on the lipid surface and at the lipid edge, where a very sharp cliff-edge transition between the lipid-bilayer and the mica is observed. Moreover, the bilayers seen in these images are indistinguishable from the bilayer treated with aqueous buffer. In contrast, prefibrillar heterogeneous oligomeric preparations of Aβ42 and Aβ40 (10 μm monomer equivalent) have a very disruptive impact on the integrity of the bilayer (see Fig. 1b and Fig. S4b, respectively). In particular, there is widespread extraction of lipid from bilayer islands, suggesting a very strong detergent effect by Aβ oligomers. Furthermore, small clumps of lipid appear deposited on the surrounding mica in close proximity to the more substantial lipid islands. This is evident in membrane height cross-sections (see Fig. 1d and Fig. S4d). The impact of Aβ42 and Aβ40 mature amyloid fibers was much less pronounced than observed for the oligomeric preparations, with almost no Aβ fiber–induced lipid extraction and deposition (no detergent effect). The lipid bilayers remained predominantly intact in the presence of Aβ fibers, as shown in Fig. 1c and Fig. S4c. We aimed to quantify the extent of the detergent effect for the three Aβ assembly types. This was achieved by measuring lipid coverage at the lipid-edge interface between regions of bilayer and lipid-free mica for multiple (n = 20) preparations (Fig. 1e and Fig. S4e). These data are presented as percentage of area lipid coverage versus distance from an island of lipid (for details, see Fig. S5). The mean lipid coverage data confirm that neither monomer nor fiber had an impact on the sharp cliff-edge transition between the lipid bilayer and mica substrate. Conversely, a very poorly defined transition between the lipid bilayer and the mica was consistently observed upon the addition of Aβ oligomers. The highly disrupted islands of lipid bilayer were surrounded by small deposits of lipid that become less abundant and dispersed at further distances from the main island of lipid, suggesting an extraction of lipid away from the bilayer origin. We observed this consistently in numerous bilayers and Aβ preparations; mean values from typically 20 measurements are shown for each Aβ type. Further examples are shown for Aβ42 and Aβ40 in Figs. S6 and S7, respectively. Previous studies have utilized Aβ-reconstituted liposomes to form an Aβ-infused mica-supported bilayer, leading to membrane-spanning pore-like annular-oligomer structures, but with this method of bilayer preparation, the extraction and resulting deposition of lipid was not observed (26Lashuel H.A.

In addition to the widespread disruption of lipid at the edges of the bilayer, extraction of lipid by Aβ oligomers also resulted in large holes in the membrane that span the bilayer, as reported previously (22Williams T.L.

A similar range of hole sizes in the bilayer is observed for Aβ40 (see Fig. S8). These holes, caused by lipid extraction, should not be conflated with the formation of ion channel pores. The diameters of Aβ ion channels have been shown to be between 1.7 and 2.4 nm based on measurements of their ionic conductance (7Bode D.C. Baker M.D. Viles J.H.

The holes observed in Fig. 2 are much larger and would be indistinguishable from membrane patch breakdown in ionic conductance measurements (7Bode D.C. Baker M.D. Viles J.H. Ion channel formation by amyloid-β42 oligomers but not amyloid-β40 in cellular membranes.J. Biol.

These large holes are also very occasionally observed upon the addition of Aβ fibers; however, their occurrence is relatively rare and may be explained by the presence of a small number of oligomers in the Aβ fiber preparation. We were also interested in quantifying the extent by which the amyloid fibers embed into bilayers. AFM is particularly suited to measuring lipid bilayer heights, measured to be 4.6 ± 0.1 nm, whereas single Aβ fibers are typically 5.3 ± 0.1 nm in height (see Fig. 3 and Figs. S9 and S10). Measurements of the height of fibers laterally associated to the surface of the membrane indicate the extent to which the fibers embed and displace lipids within the bilayer. Fibers that laterally associate onto the surface of the membrane consistently protrude to a height of 2.5 ± 0.05 nm above the lipid bilayer surface. This indicates that the fibers do indeed embed into the membrane to a depth where the upper leaflet of the bilayer is displaced, as shown in Fig. 3c. It seems that fibers do not displace lipid from the lower leaflet of the supported lipid bilayer; nor do fibers rest on the surface of the membrane to leave the bilayer unperturbed. Lateral association of amyloid fibers on the surface of a lipid bilayer has been reported using a range of techniques, including EM and fluorescence microscopy (11Sasahara K. Morigaki K. Shinya K.

Rep. 2017; 7 (28240273)4357710.1038/srep43577Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). However, this is the first clear evidence that laterally associated Aβ fibers are capable of embedding and displacing the upper leaflet of the bilayer rather than simply residing on the charged surface of the bilayer. To investigate the extent to which oligomers and curvy linear protofibrils embed into the lipid bilayer, we used AFM to record both topographical and phase-contrast information. Oligomers and curvy linear protofibrils generated here are typically at least 4 nm in diameter. Phase imaging can be used to distinguish differences in viscoelastic properties that in turn can be explained by different surface properties even when there is little change in height topology. In this way, Aβ oligomers can be observed even when they are fully embedded into the membrane (see Fig. S11). Phase imaging of bilayers exposed to Aβ oligomer revealed dark regions within the bilayer that are indicative of increased probe adhesion to membrane-inserted Aβ; these oligomers were otherwise poorly visualized by height topography. The oligomer and curvy linear protofibrils have a widespread presence in the membrane and are sufficiently buried to be a similar height as the surrounding bilayer, displacing both leaflets of the membrane, which might then facilitate the observed lipid extraction. We further investigated the impact of Aβ assemblies on the structure of lipid membranes within large unilamellar vesicles (LUVs) by negative-stain TEM imaging. In agreement with the AFM data, monomers of Aβ have little impact on the membrane, as the vesicles show little difference in appearance from vesicles imaged in the absence of Aβ (Fig. 4a and Fig. S12). Aβ42 oligomers clearly disrupt the shape of the vesicles, causing numerous discontinuities and curvatures within the bilayer (Fig. 4b and Fig. S12). Peptide-induced membrane curvature has also been reported for anti-microbial peptides whose toxic action is linked to a detergent effect dependent on membrane insertion (34Bechinger B. Lohner K. Detergent-like actions of linear amphipathic cationic antimicrobial peptides.Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2006; 1758 (16928357): 1529-153910.1016/j.bbamem.2006.07.001Crossref PubMed Scopus (474) Google Scholar, 35Koller D. Lohner K.

In contrast, Aβ fibers cause less distortion in the vesicle appearance, with only the ends of the fibers causing membrane curvature (Fig. 4c and Fig. S13). This behavior is also apparent for β2-microglobulin and amylin amyloid fibers imaged by TEM (13Engel M.F. Khemtémourian L. Kleijer C.C. Meeldijk H.J.D. Jacobs J. Verkleij A.J. de Kruijff B.

In summary, nanoscale imaging of supported lipid bilayers has revealed very different impacts on the membrane when challenged with Aβ monomers, heterogeneous oligomers, or fibers (Fig. 5). In the presence of isolated monomers of Aβ40 or Aβ42, the lipid membrane remains unperturbed, whereas fibers laterally embed into the bilayer to displace the upper leaflet. Notably, only Aβ oligomers cause extraction of lipid from the membrane, explaining the high levels of lipid deposited within extracellular Aβ plaques in the AD brain. In vivo, this detergent effect is likely to impact cellular homeostasis and integrity and is in line with the relative cytotoxicity of Aβ oligomers compared with fibrillar assembly states (36Walsh D.M.

Cell viability assays report cytotoxicity for both Aβ40 and Aβ42, although Aβ40 is less potent than Aβ42 (38Dahlgren K.N. Manelli A.M. Stine Jr., W.B. Baker L.K. Krafft G.A. LaDu M.J. Oligomeric and fibrillar species of amyloid-β peptides differentially affect neuronal viability.J. Biol.

Here we show there is not a significant difference in membrane disruption caused by Aβ40 oligomers compared with Aβ42, whereas only Aβ42 oligomers form ion channels (7Bode D.C. Baker M.D. Viles J.H. Ion channel formation by amyloid-β42 oligomers but not amyloid-β40 in cellular membranes.J. Biol.

The differences in ion channel formation and lipid bilayer disruption (Fig. 5) suggest there may be two or more mechanisms by which Aβ can disrupt neuronal homeostasis and trigger the cascade of events that culminate in dementia. Multiple modes of toxic action present numerous therapeutic targets; our study indicates that therapeutic molecules that prevent insertion of the Aβ oligomer into membranes may circumvent both mechanisms of toxicity. Lyophilized Aβ40 and Aβ42 peptides were purchased from Cambridge Research Biochemicals and EZBiolab Inc. Aβ peptides were synthesized using solid-phase Fmoc (N-(9-fluorenyl)methoxycarbonyl) chemistry, producing a single elution band in HPLC with correct mass verified by MS. Unless otherwise stated, all other chemicals were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. Peptides were solubilized in ultra-high quality (UHQ) water (0.7 mg/ml at pH 10) and left at 4 °C for 12 h. Samples were then centrifuged for 15 min at 16,000 × g at 4 °C to remove any high-molecular weight aggregates. Aβ concentration was determined by absorbance of stock solutions at 280 nm (ε = 1280 m−1 cm−1). Size-exclusion chromatography (SEC) was utilized to separate Aβ monomer from amyloid assemblies of higher molecular weight. Superdex 75 10/300 GL column (GE Healthcare) was used to purify and elute a monomeric fraction of solubilized Aβ preparations using AKTA FPLC. Stock Aβ solution (90 μm) in UHQ water was loaded onto the column, and the monomer peak was eluted with a solution of NaCl (160 mm), HEPES (30 mm) using a 0.5 ml/min flow rate at 4 °C. Eluted monomer had a typical concentration of 30 μm. SEC-purified Aβ was deemed to be seed-free, evidenced by a single elution band and an absence of observable assemblies by negative-stain TEM. Seed-free Aβ, termed here as monomeric, also had no thioflavin T (ThT) fluorescence signal and exhibited a clear lag phase in the nucleation polymerization reaction (see Fig. S2). Monomeric samples were used directly after SEC elution or immediately stored at −80 °C. Amyloid fiber preparations of Aβ40 and Aβ42 (10 μm monomer-equivalent) were generated in a 96-well plate in aqueous buffer containing NaCl (160 mm) and HEPES (30 mm) at pH 7.4, as described previously (39Younan N.D. Viles J.H. A comparison of three fluorophores for the detection of amyloid fibers and prefibrillar oligomeric assemblies. ThT (thioflavin T); ANS (1-anilinonaphthalene-8-sulfonic acid); and bisANS (4,4′-dianilino-1,1′-binaphthyl-5,5′-disulfonic acid).Biochemistry. 2015; 54 (26087242): 4297-430610.1021/acs.biochem.5b00309Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar) (see supporting information for further details). Assembly kinetics were monitored with ThT fluorescence (10 μm). Adjacent sample wells with no ThT added were used to generate assemblies for use in all experiments. To remove any low-molecular weight oligomers, fiber preparations were centrifuged at 16,100 × g for 5 min. The supernatant, which contained small diffusible oligomers, was removed, and the fiber pellet was resuspended. At equilibrium, Aβ assemblies had the typical amyloid fibrous appearance according to AFM and TEM (see Fig. S3). Fiber preparations have a low level of Aβ monomer and oligomer content. Similarly, Aβ40 and Aβ42 assemblies with predominantly circular oligomeric structure were obtained from the well plate toward the end of the lag phase, as monitored by ThT fluorescent dye in separate wells. Oligomeric samples were used immediately or stored at −80 °C to halt further assembly. The heterogeneous lag-phase mixture contains a range of oligomer sizes, whereas appreciable monomeric Aβ is still present, as indicated by SEC elusion profiles (Fig. S2d). According to TEM, these oligomeric preparations are heterogeneous in nature but contain a large number of circular oligomeric assemblies that range in size, with typical diameters between 10 and 12 nm, identified by TEM and AFM (see Fig. S3). TEM micrographs of negatively stained prefibrillar oligomeric assemblies of Aβ42 were further characterized using single-particle analyses. A total data set of 3997 single particles were grouped into 25 class averages (see Fig. S3a). From this data set, 70% were broadly circular in appearance and ranged in diameter between 10 and 12 nm. Using the relationship, volume (nm3) = mass (kDa)/1.27 (nm3/kDa), and assuming spherical protein assemblies, approximate masses of between 400 and 700 kDa are indicated. Whereas SEC suggests smaller oligomers are also present (Fig. S2d), the remaining particles appeared elongated up to 16 nm, with some approaching curvy linear status. Some much longer curvy linear protofibrillar assemblies were indeed present, typically 100 nm long. In agreement with our SEC elution profiles (Fig. S2d), it has been shown much of Aβ remains monomeric in the prefibrillar lag-phase preparations (40Arosio P. Knowles T.P. Linse S. On the lag phase in amyloid fibril formation.Phys. Chem. Chem. Phys. 2015; 17 (25719972): 7606-761810.1039/C4CP05563BCrossref PubMed Google Scholar). The nature of the heterogeneous Aβ assemblies present in lag-phase preparations has been reviewed previously (40Arosio P. Knowles T.P. Linse S. On the lag phase in amyloid fibril formation.Phys. Chem. Chem. Phys. 2015; 17 (25719972): 7606-761810.1039/C4CP05563BCrossref PubMed Google Scholar). Lipid bilayers were prepared using methods similar to those described previously (31Matheou C.J. Younan N.D. Viles J.H. Cu2+ accentuates distinct misfolding of Aβ1–40 and Aβ1–42 peptides, and potentiates membrane disruption.Biochem. J. 2015; 466 (25471541): 233-24210.1042/BJ20141168Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). A lipid mixture of egg PC (Avanti Polar Lipids Inc.), GM1 ganglioside (Avanti Polar Lipids Inc.), and cholesterol (Sigma-Aldrich) solubilized to 5 mg/ml at a ratio of 68:2:30 (w/v), in a 2:1 (v/v) mixture of chloroform and methanol. Organic solvent was then gently removed under a stream of nitrogen and left overnight in a fume hood to form a lipid film. For AFM studies, the dried lipid film of PC/GM1/cholesterol was rehydrated in an aqueous buffer (160 mm NaCl, 30 mm HEPES, pH 7.4) to achieve a 0.6 mg/ml liposome solution. This vesicle suspension was then tip-sonicated at low power for three 30-s periods, until the cloudy lipid solution was clear, ready for deposition onto mica. For TEM lipid vesicle studies, LUVs were generated by the extrusion method (31Matheou C.J. Younan N.D. Viles J.H. Cu2+ accentuates distinct misfolding of Aβ1–40 and Aβ1–42 peptides, and potentiates membrane disruption.Biochem. J. 2015; 466 (25471541): 233-24210.1042/BJ20141168Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). A 1 mg/ml lipid solution was immediately passed through a lipid extruder (Avanti Lipids Ltd.), which contained a 100-nm polycarbonate filter (Avanti Polar Lipids Inc.), seven times to generate a uniform size. LUVs were typically 100–200 nm in diameter. Mica discs (Agar Scientific Ltd.) were cleaved five times with sticky tape, and both the mica and the lipid vesicle suspension were heated to 60 °C in a benchtop oven. The heated suspension was then pipetted onto mica discs in a Corning sterile 6-well plate (Sigma-Aldrich). The plate was then sealed in a humid box and incubated at 60 °C for 30 min before decreasing the temperature to 25 °C at a rate of 5 °C every 15 min until reaching room temperature. Slow cooling of the sample enables large micro-islands of bilayer to form on the mica (Fig. S1). The mica was then washed three times with UHQ water, ready for exposure to Aβ. Typically, 200 μl of Aβ (10 μm) with NaCl (160 mm) and HEPES (30 mm), pH 7.4, was applied by pipette to evenly coat the surface of the mica. The Aβ droplet was incubated in a sealed container for 1 h to minimize evaporation and maintain salt/Aβ concentration. The droplet was then removed using filter paper, and the mica surface was washed again three times with UHQ water. Mica samples were finally left to dry in ambient air conditions under the cover of pierced parafilm. The samples were then imaged by AFM. Aβ was also deposited directly onto the mica in the absence of lipid bilayer using a similar protocol. Details of the measurements made using both AFM and TEM can be found in the supporting information.

To investigate how such changes affect communities, we performed multiscale analyses of seed dispersal networks on Oʻahu, Hawaiʻi. Networks consisted exclusively of novel interactions, were largely dominated by introduced species, and exhibited specialized and modular structure at local and regional scales, despite high interaction dissimilarity across communities. Furthermore, the structure and stability of the novel networks were similar to native-dominated communities worldwide. Our findings suggest that shared evolutionary history is not a necessary process for the emergence of complex network structure, and interaction patterns may be highly conserved, regardless of species identity and environment. Introduced species can quickly become well integrated into novel networks, making restoration of native ecosystems more challenging than previously thought."
https://openalex.org/W2934245145,"Interest in pharmacological agents capable of increasing cellular NAD+ concentrations has stimulated investigations of nicotinamide riboside (NR) and nicotinamide mononucleotide (NMN). NR and NMN require large dosages for effect. Herein, we describe synthesis of dihydronicotinamide riboside (NRH) and the discovery that NRH is a potent NAD+ concentration-enhancing agent, which acts within as little as 1 h after administration to mammalian cells to increase NAD+ concentrations by 2.5–10-fold over control values. Comparisons with NR and NMN show that in every instance, NRH provides greater NAD+ increases at equivalent concentrations. NRH also provides substantial NAD+ increases in tissues when administered by intraperitoneal injection to C57BL/6J mice. NRH substantially increases NAD+/NADH ratio in cultured cells and in liver and no induction of apoptotic markers or significant increases in lactate levels in cells. Cells treated with NRH are resistant to cell death caused by NAD+-depleting genotoxins such as hydrogen peroxide and methylmethane sulfonate. Studies to identify its biochemical mechanism of action showed that it does not inhibit NAD+ consumption, suggesting that it acts as a biochemical precursor to NAD+. Cell lysates possess an ATP-dependent kinase activity that efficiently converts NRH to the compound NMNH, but independent of Nrk1 or Nrk2. These studies identify a putative new metabolic pathway to NAD+ and a potent pharmacologic agent for NAD+ concentration enhancement in cells and tissues."
https://openalex.org/W2928742649,"Self-recognition is observed abundantly throughout the natural world, regulating diverse biological processes. Although ubiquitous, often little is known of the associated molecular machinery, and so far, organismal self-recognition has never been described in nematodes. We investigated the predatory nematode Pristionchus pacificus and, through interactions with its prey, revealed a self-recognition mechanism acting on the nematode surface, capable of distinguishing self-progeny from closely related strains. We identified the small peptide SELF-1, which is composed of an invariant domain and a hypervariable C terminus, as a key component of self-recognition. Modifications to the hypervariable region, including single–amino acid substitutions, are sufficient to eliminate self-recognition. Thus, the P. pacificus self-recognition system enables this nematode to avoid cannibalism while promoting the killing of competing nematodes."
https://openalex.org/W2932007531,"Accessing enantiomerically enriched amines often demands oxidation-state adjustments, protection and deprotection processes, and purification procedures that increase cost and waste, limiting applicability. When diastereomers can be formed, one isomer is attainable. Here, we show that nitriles, largely viewed as insufficiently reactive, can be transformed directly to multifunctional unprotected homoallylic amines by enantioselective addition of a carbon-based nucleophile and diastereodivergent reduction of the resulting ketimine. Successful implementation requires that competing copper-based catalysts be present simultaneously and that the slower-forming and less reactive one engages first. This challenge was addressed by incorporation of a nonproductive side cycle, fueled selectively by inexpensive additives, to delay the function of the more active catalyst. The utility of this approach is highlighted by its application to the efficient preparation of the anticancer agent (+)-tangutorine."
https://openalex.org/W2931737578,"Degenerative cervical myelopathy (DCM) is a spinal cord condition that results in progressive non-traumatic compression of the cervical spinal cord. Spine surgeons must consider a large quantity of information relating to disease presentation, imaging features, and patient characteristics to determine if a patient will benefit from surgery for DCM. We applied a supervised machine learning approach to develop a classification model to predict individual patient outcome after surgery for DCM. Patients undergoing surgery for DCM as a part of the AOSpine CSM-NA or CSM-I prospective, multi-centre studies were included in the analysis. Out of 757 patients 605, 583, and 539 patients had complete follow-up information at 6, 12, and 24 months respectively and were included in the analysis. The primary outcome was improvement in the SF-6D quality of life indicator score by the minimum clinically important difference (MCID). The secondary outcome was improvement in the modified Japanese Orthopedic Association (mJOA) score by the MCID. Predictor variables reflected information about pre-operative disease severity, disease presentation, patient demographics, and comorbidities. A machine learning approach of feature engineering, data pre-processing, and model optimization was used to create the most accurate predictive model of outcome after surgery for DCM. Following data pre-processing 48, 108, and 101 features were chosen for model training at 6, 12, and 24 months respectively. The best performing predictive model used a random forest structure and had an average area under the curve (AUC) of 0.70, classification accuracy of 77%, and sensitivity of 78% when evaluated on a testing cohort that was not used for model training. Worse pre-operative disease severity, longer duration of DCM symptoms, older age, higher body weight, and current smoking status were associated with worse surgical outcomes. We developed a model that predicted positive surgical outcome for DCM with good accuracy at the individual patient level on an independent testing cohort. Our analysis demonstrates the applicability of machine-learning to predictive modeling in spine surgery."
https://openalex.org/W2901308664,"During tendon healing, it is postulated that tendon cells drive tissue regeneration, whereas extrinsic cells drive pathologic scar formation. Tendon cells are frequently described as a homogenous, fibroblast population that is positive for the marker Scleraxis (Scx). It is controversial whether tendon cells localize within the forming scar tissue during adult tendon healing. We have previously demonstrated that S100 calcium-binding protein A4 (S100a4) is a driver of tendon scar formation and marks a subset of tendon cells. The relationship between Scx and S100a4 has not been explored. In this study, we assessed the localization of Scx lineage cells (ScxLin) following adult murine flexor tendon repair and established the relationship between Scx and S100a4 throughout both homeostasis and healing. We showed that adult ScxLin localize within the scar tissue and organize into a cellular bridge during tendon healing. Additionally, we demonstrate that markers Scx and S100a4 label distinct populations in tendon during homeostasis and healing, with Scx found in the organized bridging tissue and S100a4 localized throughout the entire scar region. These studies define a heterogeneous tendon cell environment and demonstrate discrete contributions of subpopulations during healing.

https://openalex.org/W2925810998,"Functional activation of the transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) receptors (TGFBRs) is carefully regulated through integration of post-translational modifications, spatial regulation at the cellular level, and TGFBR availability at the cell surface. Although the bulk of TGFBRs resides inside the cells, AKT Ser/Thr kinase (AKT) activation in response to insulin or other growth factors rapidly induces transport of TGFBRs to the cell surface, thereby increasing the cell's responsiveness to TGF-β. We now demonstrate that TGF-β itself induces a rapid translocation of its own receptors to the cell surface and thus amplifies its own response. This mechanism of response amplification, which hitherto has not been reported for other cell-surface receptors, depended on AKT activation and TGF-β type I receptor kinase. In addition to an increase in cell-surface TGFBR levels, TGF-β treatment promoted TGFBR internalization, suggesting an overall amplification of TGFBR cycling. The TGF-β-induced increase in receptor presentation at the cell surface amplified TGF-β-induced SMAD family member (SMAD) activation and gene expression. Furthermore, bone morphogenetic protein 4 (BMP-4), which also induces AKT activation, increased TGFBR levels at the cell surface, leading to enhanced autocrine activation of TGF-β-responsive SMADs and gene expression, providing context for the activation of TGF-β signaling in response to BMP during development. In summary, our results indicate that TGF-β- and BMP-induced activation of low levels of cell surface-associated TGFBRs rapidly mobilizes additional TGFBRs from intracellular stores to the cell surface, increasing the abundance of cell-surface TGFBRs and cells' responsiveness to TGF-β signaling."
https://openalex.org/W2931800632,"In this study, we examined the effect of MC1568, a selective class IIa histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitor, on the development and progression of renal fibrosis in a murine model of renal fibrosis induced by unilateral ureteral obstruction (UUO). All 4 class IIa HDAC isoforms, in particular HDAC4, were up-regulated in renal epithelial cells of the injured kidney. Administration of MC1568 immediately after UUO injury reduced expression of α–smooth muscle actin (α-SMA), fibronectin, and collagen 1. MC1568 treatment or small interfering RNA–mediated silencing of HDAC4 also suppressed expression of those proteins in cultured renal epithelial cells. Mechanistically, MC1568 abrogated UUO-induced phosphorylation of Smad3, NF-κB, and up-regulation of integrin a Vβ6 in the kidney and inhibited TGF-β1-induced responses in cultured renal epithelial cells. MCI568 also increased renal expression of klotho, bone morphogenetic protein 7, and Smad7. Moreover, delayed administration of MC1568 at 3 d after ureteral obstruction reversed the expression of α-SMA, fibronectin, and collagen 1 and increased expression of matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-2 and -9. Collectively, these results suggest that selectively targeting class IIa HD AC isoforms (in particular HDAC4) may inhibit development and progression of renal fibrosis by suppressing activation and expression of multiple prof ibrotic molecules and increasing expression of antif ibrotic proteins and MMPs.—Xiong, C., Guan, Y., Zhou, X., Liu, L., Zhuang, M.

The poultry industry is an increasingly important segment of food production and contributor to AR. The objective of this study was to evaluate the prevalence, AR patterns and the characterization of relevant resistance genes in Extended Spectrum β-lactamases (ESBL) and AmpC-producing E. coli from large poultry farms in Ecuador. Sampling was performed from June 2013 to July 2014 in 6 slaughterhouses that slaughter broilers from 115 farms totaling 384 flocks. Each sample of collected caeca was streaked onto TBX agar supplemented with cefotaxime (3 mg/l). In total, 176 isolates were analyzed for AR patterns by the disk diffusion method and for blaCTX-M, blaTEM, blaCMY, blaSHV, blaKPC, and mcr-1 by PCR and sequencing. ESBL and AmpC E. coli were found in 362 flocks (94.3%) from 112 farms (97.4%). We found that 98.3% of the cefotaxime-resistant isolates were multi-resistant to antibiotics. Low resistance was observed for ertapenem and nitrofurantoin. The most prevalent ESBL genes were the ones belonging to the blaCTX-M group (90.9%), specifically the blaCTX-M-65, blaCTX-M-55 and blaCTX-M-3 alleles. Most of the AmpC strains presented the blaCMY-2 gene. Three isolates showed the mcr-1 gene. Poultry production systems represent a hotspot for AR in Ecuador, possibly mediated by the extensive use of antibiotics. Monitoring this sector in national and regional plans of AR surveillance should therefore be considered."

Plants can detect and respond to pathogen-derived molecules (effectors) through cell surface receptors and intracellular receptors, typically encoded by disease resistance (R) genes. Analysis of plant genome sequences reveals hundreds of such nucleotide-binding, leucine-rich repeat (NLR) proteins encoded by putative R genes. How such NLR proteins function has long been a matter of speculation. On page 43 and 44 of this issue, Wang et al. (1) and Wang et al.

Because of their unique developmental system, avian species offer many advantages as model vertebrates. Here, we report the development of novel chicken models using the CRISPR/Cas9-mediated nonhomologous end joining repair pathway in chicken primordial germ cells (PGCs). Through the introduction of a donor plasmid containing short guide RNA recognition sequences and CRISPR/Cas9 plasmids into chicken PGCs, exogenous genes of donor plasmids were precisely inserted into target loci, and production of transgenic chickens was accomplished through subsequent transplantation of the Z chromosome-targeted PGCs. Using this method, we successfully accomplished the targeted gene insertion to the chicken sex Z chromosome without detected off-target effects. The genome-modified chickens robustly expressed green fluorescent protein from the Z chromosome, which could then be used for easy sex identification during embryogenesis. Our results suggest that this powerful genome-editing method could be used to develop many chicken models and should significantly expand the application of genome-modified avians.-Lee, H.

https://openalex.org/W2935640431,"Extracellular vesicles (EVs) released by cells have a role in intercellular communication to regulate a wide range of biological processes. Two types of EVs can be recognized. Exosomes, which are released from multi-vesicular bodies upon fusion with the plasma membrane, and ectosomes, which directly bud from the plasma membrane. How cells regulate the quantity of EV release is largely unknown. One of the initiating events in vesicle biogenesis is the regulated transport of phospholipids from the exoplasmic to the cytosolic leaflet of biological membranes. This process is catalyzed by P4-ATPases. The role of these phospholipid transporters in intracellular vesicle transport has been established in lower eukaryotes and is slowly emerging in mammalian cells. In Caenorhabditis elegans (C. elegans), deficiency of the P4-ATPase member TAT-5 resulted in enhanced EV shedding, indicating a role in the regulation of EV release. In this study, we investigated whether the mammalian ortholog of TAT-5, ATP9A, has a similar function in mammalian cells. We show that knockdown of ATP9A expression in human hepatoma cells resulted in a significant increase in EV release that was independent of caspase-3 activation. Pharmacological blocking of exosome release in ATP9A knockdown cells did significantly reduce the total number of EVs. Our data support a role for ATP9A in the regulation of exosome release from human cells."

Recently, E. crusgalli has evolved quinclorac resistance, making it among the most serious herbicide resistant weeds in China. The present study explored differences in germination and growth between quinclorac-resistant and -susceptible E. crusgalli collected in Hunan Province. The order of the seven E. crusgalli biotypes assessed, from high to low quinclorac-resistance, was: quinclorac-resistant, Chunhua, Hanshou, Shimen, Hekou, Dingcheng, and quinclorac-susceptible. With an increased in the level of quinclorac-resistance, the germination rate, length of young shoots and roots, and fresh weight of E. crusgalli were all decreased compared with that in more susceptible biotypes. However, there were no significant differences between quinclorac-resistant and susceptible E. crusgalli biotypes without polyethylene glycol 6000 treatment. Drought had a more obvious effect on glutathione S-transferases (GST) activity, determined by spectrophotometric method, in quinclorac-resistant E. crusgalli. Higher resistance level biotypes showed greater activity, and when treated with polyethylene glycol 6000 for 3 days, all E. crusgalli biotypes showed the highest GST activity. This study demonstrated that as the level of quinclorac-resistance increased, the rate of seed germination decreased, while the growth of young buds, young roots, and fresh weight decreased. Increased quinclorac-resistance may be related to the increased metabolic activity of GST in E. crusgalli."
https://openalex.org/W2934048216,"Understanding and quantifying total economic impacts of flood events is essential for flood risk management and adaptation planning. Yet, detailed estimations of joint direct and indirect flood-induced economic impacts are rare. In this study an innovative modeling procedure for the joint assessment of short-term direct and indirect economic flood impacts is introduced. The procedure is applied to 19 economic sectors in eight federal states of Germany after the flood events in 2013. The assessment of the direct economic impacts is object-based and considers uncertainties associated with the hazard, the exposed objects and their vulnerability. The direct economic impacts are then coupled to a supply-side Input-Output-Model to estimate the indirect economic impacts. The procedure provides distributions of direct and indirect economic impacts which capture the associated uncertainties. The distributions of the direct economic impacts in the federal states are plausible when compared to reported values. The ratio between indirect and direct economic impacts shows that the sectors Manufacturing, Financial and Insurance activities suffered the most from indirect economic impacts. These ratios also indicate that indirect economic impacts can be almost as high as direct economic impacts. They differ strongly between the economic sectors indicating that the application of a single factor as a proxy for the indirect impacts of all economic sectors is not appropriate."

Statins have been also reported to slow tumor progression. In cancer cells, ATP is generated both by glycolysis and oxidative phosphorylation. Mitochondrial membrane potential (ΔΨ), a readout of mitochondrial metabolism, is sustained by the oxidation of respiratory substrates in the Krebs cycle to generate NADH and flavin adenine dinucleotide, which are further oxidized by the respiratory chain. Here, we studied the short-term effects of statins (3-24 h) on mitochondrial metabolism on cancer cells. Lovastatin (LOV) and simvastatin (SIM) increased ΔΨ in HepG2 and Huh7 human hepatocarcinoma cells and HCC4006 human lung adenocarcinoma cells. Mitochondrial hyperpolarization after LOV and SIM was dose and time dependent. Maximal increase in ΔΨ occurred at 10 µM and 24 h for both statins. The structurally unrelated atorvastatin also hyperpolarized mitochondria in HepG2 cells. Cellular and mitochondrial Chol remained unchanged after SIM. Both LOV and SIM decreased basal respiration, ATP-linked respiration, and ATP production. LOV and SIM did not change the rate of lactic acid production. In summary, statins modulate mitochondrial metabolism in cancer cells independently of the Chol content in cellular membranes without affecting glycolysis.-Christie, C. F., Fang, D., Hunt, E.

https://openalex.org/W2927963087,"People with Down syndrome (DS) are at high risk of developing Alzheimer disease (AD) with aging. The diagnosis and treatment trials are hampered by a lack of reliable blood biomarkers. Plasma neurofilament light chain (NfL) is one of the established biomarkers of AD, suggesting that it may be useful as an indicator of dementia in DS patients. The aims of this study were: 1) to examine whether plasma levels of NfL in DS patients are correlated with decreased adaptive behavior scores one year after sample collection, and 2) to compare plasma levels of NfL in adults with DS and an age-matched healthy control population. In this study, plasma levels of NfL in 24 patients with DS and 24 control participants were measured by the single-molecule immunoarray (Simoa) method. We observed significantly increased plasma NfL levels in the DS compared with the control group. There was a significant correlation between age and levels of plasma NfL in both groups. This age-dependent elevation was steeper in the DS compared with the control group. Moreover, elevated plasma NfL was associated with decreased adaptive behavior scores one year later, after age-adjustment. Previously reported blood-based biomarkers available in Simoa for DS, plasma total tau and phosphorylated tau, were not significantly correlated with the annual decrement of adaptive behavior scores after age-adjustment. These results suggest that plasma NfL has the potential to serve as an objective biomarker to predict dementia in adult DS patients."
https://openalex.org/W2932895520,"The liver is a central immunologic organ with a high density of myeloid and lymphoid immune cells that play important roles in the development and progression of nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH). However, the immune-cell–mediated regulation of NASH and its underlying mechanisms remain obscure. In this study, Prf1null mice showed significantly higher plasma alanine transaminase levels, with increased liver fat accumulation, lobular inflammation, and focal necrosis compared with wild-type (WT) mice after 4 wk of feeding on a methionine- and choline-deficient diet (MCD) or 16 wk of feeding on a high-fat diet. Perforin deficiency promoted the M1 polarization of infiltrated monocytes. Moreover, MCD-fed Prf1null mice exhibited increased accumulation, survival, activation, and proinflammatory cytokine production of CD8 T cells but not NK cells or CD4 T cells. Adoptive transfer of CD8 T cells or NK cells from WT or Prf1null mice, together with non-CD8 cells or non-NK cells from WT mice, indicated that CD8 T-cell–derived perforin participates in the mechanism regulating liver inflammation and thus plays a protective role in the development of NASH. Perforin-deficient CD8 T cells exhibited decreased cytotoxicity toward bone marrow-derived M1 monocytes and macrophages. According to the RNA sequencing data, the perforin deficiency inhibited cell apoptosis and enhanced the activation, migration, and proinflammatory cytokine production of CD8 T cells in mice with NASH. Furthermore, we found higher plasma soluble perforin levels and hepatic perforin expression in NASH patients, suggesting clinical relevance of the findings. We have elucidated an important role for the cytotoxic immune effector molecule perforin from CD8 T cells in restricting hepatic inflammation in mice with NASH and suggest that therapies designed to maximize the function of endogenous perforin in CD8 T cells might have potential benefits as NASH treatments.—Wang, T., Sun, G., Wang, Y., Li, S., Zhao, X., Zhang, C., Jin, H., Tian, D., Liu, K., Shi, W., Tian, Y., Zhang, D.

Therefore, the aim of this study was to provide reference ranges for hair cortisol concentrations by sex and age and to study the relationship between subjective and objective measures of stress and temporal stability.The participants were 170 adolescents aged between 12 and 14 years (mean = 12.78 years; standard deviation = 0.71 years; 52.40% girls) who completed the Perceived Stress Scale 4 and had their hair sampled.The results revealed hair cortisol concentrations ranging from 0.07 pg/mg to 9.54 pg/mg. Subjective and objective measures of stress were not related, nor was there intraindividual stability of the hair cortisol concentrations. Girls had higher hair cortisol concentrations, and there were no age differences.This research provides cortisol reference values for adolescents that will allow the early detection of chronic stress. Such detection methods make it possible to prevent problems arising from stress because we can act more quickly and the treatments will be more effective. The study suggests that there is no relationship between perceived and objective stress; while perceived stress remained stable, the levels of hair cortisol were increased at 6 months. Despite the interesting findings of the study, there are some limitations: the sample was not obtained through probabilistic sampling, the age range was narrow, and some demographic, anthropomorphic and clinical factors are missing, which make the generalization of results difficult."

In mice, FOXA2 is a critical regulator of uterine gland development in the neonate and gland function in the adult. An integrative approach was used here to define the FOXA2 cistrome in the human endometrium. Genome-wide mapping of FOXA2 binding intervals by chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing was performed using proliferative (P)- and midsecretory (MS)-phase endometrium and integrated with the transcriptome determined by RNA sequencing. Distinctive FOXA2 binding intervals, enriched for different transcription factor binding site motifs, were detected in the P and MS endometrium. Pathway analysis revealed different biologic processes regulated by genes with FOXA2 binding intervals in the P and MS endometrium. Thus, FOXA2 is postulated to regulate gene expression in concert with other transcription factors and impact uterine gland development and function in a cycle phase–dependent manner. Analyses also identified potential FOXA2-regulated genes that influence uterine receptivity, blastocyst implantation, and stromal cell decidualization, which are key events in pregnancy establishment.—Kelleher, A.

PPD was categorised into no depression (CES-D 10 total score <5), low to medium depression (CES-D 10 total score ≥5 and <10) and major depressive symptoms (CES-D 10 total score≥10). We used ordered logistic regression to identify predictors of postpartum depression and report adjusted odds ratio (aOR) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs).Overall 288 (25.0%) women screened positive for postpartum depression, a total of 168 (14.6%) women had low to medium PPD and 120 (10.4%) had major PPD. A higher proportion of HIV negative women experienced PPD, 129/461 (28.0%) among HIV negative vs. 159/690 (23.0%) among HIV-1 infected. Among HIV positive women, there was no meaningful difference in PPD between newly HIV diagnosed and those diagnosed before the most recent pregnancy (aOR 1.3, 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.9-1.8). Predictors of PPD among HIV positive women were living with friends/in a house-share (aOR 0.5 for house-share vs. own home, 95% CI: 0.3-0.9), and attending antenatal care (ANC) for the most recent pregnancy (aOR 0.2 for ANC attendance vs. no ANC attendance, 95% CI: 0.0-0.5). Living with friends/in a house-share was also a predictor of PPD among HIV negative women (aOR 0.4 for house-share vs. own home, 95% CI: 0.2-0.8).Targeted symptom screening based on identified risk factors should be considered for postpartum women to increase PPD case-finding and referral to specialised social support services."

Here, we used affinity purification with MS in HEK293T cells to isolate NACA complexes and identified protein phosphatase 1 catalytic subunit α (PP1A) as a NACA-associated Ser/Thr phosphatase. NACA interacted with multiple components of the PP1A holoenzyme complex: the PPP1CA catalytic subunit and the regulatory subunits PPP1R9B, PPP1R12A and PPP1R18.

We combined medical imaging and motion capture of healthy subjects (four males and one female) to develop subject-specific knee models that simulated the 12 degrees of freedom of tibiofemoral and patellofemoral joint behaviors. These computational models were validated by comparing electromyographic (EMG) data with muscle activation data and were based on previous experimental studies. A rigid multi-body dynamics simulation using a lower extremity musculoskeletal model was performed to incorporate intact and selective resection of ligaments, based on a novel force-dependent kinematics method, during gait (walking) and squatting.

https://openalex.org/W2926175524,"Transcutaneous electrical stimulation is a relatively new technique to evoke spinal reflexes in lower limb muscles. The advantage of this technique is that the spinal reflex responses can be obtained from multiple lower limb muscles simultaneously. However, repeatability of spinal reflexes evoked by transcutaneous spinal cord stimulation between days has not been evaluated. We aimed to examine repeatability of recruitment properties of the spinal reflexes evoked by transcutaneous spinal cord stimulation. Recruitment curves of the spinal reflexes evoked by transcutaneous spinal cord stimulation of 8 lower limb muscles (i.e., foot, lower leg, and thigh muscles) of 20 males were measured on two consecutive days. To confirm that responses were caused by activation of the sensory fiber, a double-pulse stimulation with 50 ms inter-pulse interval was delivered. Peak-to-peak amplitude of the first response was calculated for each muscle when no response was observed in the second response owing to post-activation depression. For comparison with the spinal reflexes evoked by transcutaneous spinal cord stimulation, the recruitment curves of the H-reflex amplitude of the soleus of 9 males were measured. Threshold intensity and maximal slope of the recruitment curves were calculated, and inter-day repeatability of the properties was quantified using intraclass correlation coefficients. For the spinal reflexes evoked by transcutaneous spinal cord stimulation, the intraclass correlation coefficient values of threshold intensity and maximal slope for each muscle ranged from 0.487 to 0.874 and from 0.471 to 0.964, respectively. Regarding the soleus H-reflex, the intraclass correlation coefficients of threshold intensity and maximal slope were 0.936 and 0.751, respectively. The present data showed that repeatability of the recruitment properties of the spinal reflexes evoked by transcutaneous spinal cord stimulation in the lower limb was moderate to high. Measurement of the spinal reflexes evoked by transcutaneous spinal cord stimulation would be useful for longitudinal neurophysiological studies."
https://openalex.org/W2935610176,"REDD+ projects primarily focus on reducing carbon emissions from deforestation and forest degradation in developing countries. These projects are regularly evaluated against their core objective of conserving carbon stocks, but their contribution to biodiversity conservation has rarely been assessed. To assess the conservation value of the area and the relative performance of a REDD+ land use plan in Yaeda Valley, a semi-arid savannah ecosystem in northern Tanzania, we implemented an annual wildlife monitoring scheme. Based on direct sightings and indirect signs of wildlife, obtained from stratified walking transects conducted annually from 2015-2018, we estimated annual trends of mammal species richness and wildlife densities in three REDD+ and three non-REDD+ land-use strata. Our surveys document a near complete mammal community in the area. Species accumulation curves, and subsequent statistical comparisons, indicated highest mammal species richness in the woodland habitats (both REDD+ and non REDD+ strata) as compared to more human and livestock impacted areas, and suggested constant species richness from 2015-2018. To estimate stratum- and year-specific livestock and wildlife densities (cattle, donkey, goat and sheep combined, Thomson's gazelle, Kirk's dik-dik) and wildlife sign densities (aardvark, bushbuck, bushpig, Kirk's dik dik, eland, elephant, Maasai giraffe, greater kudu, hyena, impala, lesser kudu, warthog, wildebeest, Plains zebra), we fitted species-specific detection functions in a distance sampling framework. Species-specific densities varied between 2015 and 2018 and showed substantial increases and occasional declines in other species-stratum combinations. However, population growth rates were not systematically associated with specific land-use strata. Although our results do not explicitly provide evidence that REDD+ land-use plans directly co-benefit wildlife conservation, they show that REDD+ areas have the potential to maintain intact wildlife assemblages. To ensure effective long-term conservation outcomes, we advocate for a more formal integration of wildlife conservation goals in the REDD+ scheme."
https://openalex.org/W2951939739,"Human sample, from patients or healthy donors, are a valuable link between basic research and clinic. Especially in translational research, they play an essential role in understanding development and progression of diseases as well as in developing new diagnostic and therapeutic tools. Stored in biobanks, fast access to appropriate material becomes possible. However, biobanking in a clinical context faces several challenges. In practice, collecting samples during clinical routine does not allow to strictly adhere to protocols of sample collection in all aspects. This may influence sample quality to variable degrees. Time from sample draw to asservation is a variable factor, and influences of prolonged storage at ambient temperature of tissues are not well understood. We investigated whether delays between 5 minutes and 3 hours, and the use of RNAlater RNA-preserving reagent would lead to a relevant drop in sample quality, measured by quantitative mRNA expression analysis. Our findings suggest that even under ambient conditions, delays up to 3 hours do not have a major impact on sample quality as long as the tissue remains intact."
https://openalex.org/W2930102608,"Most living creatures have a circadian rhythm that is generated by a precisely regulated transcriptional–translational feedback loop of clock genes. Brain and muscle ARNT-like 1 (BMAL1) is one of the core clock genes and transcription factors that represents a positive arm of this autoregulatory circadian clock system. Despite the indispensable role of BMAL1 in the circadian rhythm, the molecular mechanisms underlying translational control of BMAL1 are largely unknown. Here, using murine NIH-3T3 cells, gene constructs, and a variety of biochemical approaches, including RNAi- and luciferase reporter gene–based assays, along with immunoblotting, in vitro transcription, quantitative real-time PCR, and real-time bioluminescence experiments, we show that translation of Bmal1 is negatively regulated by an RNA-binding protein, heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein Q (hnRNP Q). Interestingly, we found that hnRNP Q rhythmically binds to a specific region of the Bmal1 mRNA 5′ UTR and controls its time-dependent expression. Moreover, we demonstrate that knockdown of hnRNP Q modulates BMAL1 protein oscillation amplitude without affecting mRNA rhythmic patterns. Furthermore, hnRNP Q depletion increases the mRNA oscillation amplitudes of BMAL1-regulated target genes. Together, our results suggest that hnRNP Q plays a pivotal role in both Bmal1 translation and BMAL1-regulated gene expression."
https://openalex.org/W2931560152,"A reasonable micro-pits texture has been initially proved that it can improve friction characteristics between wood and cemented carbide surface and reduce surface friction coefficient. In order to study the cutting performance of the micro-texture when it is applied to the cutting tool for cutting wood more effectively, this paper selected micro-pit texture for studying influence of surface micro-texture cutting tool on wood cutting performance and cutting temperature, finding that when micro-pit cemented carbide cutting tool is adopted for turning the northeast China ash (Fraxinus spp.), it can reduce cutting force of turning and surface friction coefficient between rake face and cuttings. Moreover, for type A and type B cutting tools, when the texture parameters are that the diameter of the micro-pit is 80μm, the depth of the micro pit is: 10μm, area occupancy is 20% and the diameter of the micro-pit is 120μm, the depth of the micro-pit is 10μm and the area occupancy is 20%, the effect generated is the best. When a texture cutting tool is used for cutting, the decrease of the highest temperature in the cutting area is not very great, but the average temperature in the cutting area changes a lot, which is mainly caused by that micro-texture is processed at a position of the rake face close to the main cutting edge and that the highest temperature of cutting is mainly generated on the contact point between tool tip and wood. A reasonable micro-texture parameter can form a layer of liquid lubricating film on the up and down contact surfaces such that the direct contact between cemented carbide and northeast China ash is changed into indirect contact between lubricating films formed by the liquid so as to reduce the surface friction coefficient."
https://openalex.org/W2935618569,"Psychophysical measurements are used to examine the perception of ocular stray light, for example, with C-Quant. These measurements are subjective due to their principles. This work aims to determine ocular stray light objectively; thus, a psychophysical method is transferred into an electrophysiological setup.Stray light perception was measured using steady-state visual evoked potentials (VEPs) in 10 healthy subjects (7 males, 3 females, mean age ± SD: 29.6 ± 4.1 years). Stray light emulating filters (Tiffen Black Pro Mist 2) were used for simulating the effect of cataracts to validate the results for increased scattered light conditions. Based on the direct compensation method, the stimulus consisted of a central test field (radius = 2°) with a luminance adjustable compensation light and surrounding ring-shaped stray light source (radius = 5 to 10°). Both flickered in the counter phase at a frequency of 7.5 Hz. The stimuli were presented for 15 luminance levels of the compensation light. The recorded steady-state VEPs at Oz channel were transformed by means of Fourier analysis. The magnitudes at the evoked frequency were plotted against the measured brightness levels of the compensation light. By fitting two linear functions to the resulting data points, a robust minimum log(Leq) was determined, which was correlated with the amount of stray light perception. We measured the stray light parameter log(sc) using C-Quant. For comparison, our results were converted into the C-Quant equivalent parameter log(sepm) and paired t-tests were performed for normal distributed results.A significant difference is observed between log(sepm) (without filter) and log(sepm) (with BPM 2 Filter) (p>0.05). No significant difference is observed between log(sepm) (without filter) and log(sc) (without filter) (p > 0.05) and between log(sepm) (with BPM 2 filter) and log(sc) (with BPM 2 filter) (p > 0.05).The electrophysiological approach offers the ability to measure stray light perception in an objective manner."
https://openalex.org/W2925964156,"On 6 February, Manfred Eigen died at the age of 91. Manfred was a role model to countless colleagues and students, and his contributions to science ranged from measuring the velocities of ultrafast chemical reactions to defining how information content expressed as functional complexity dictates the evolution of life forms. With his death, the world has lost one of its most outstanding, creative, and unconventional thinkers and scientists.

Born in Bochum, Germany, to a cellist father, Manfred became a proficient pianist and seriously considered a musical career. World War II intervened. After being drafted into the German army and escaping from an Allied prisoner-of-war camp in 1945, Manfred trudged across Germany to Gottingen, a historical center of science in Lower Saxony. At the University of Gottingen, he studied chemistry and physics, mentored by Arnold Eucken but also influenced by physicists Werner Heisenberg and Wolfgang Paul. He obtained a D.Sc. in physical chemistry in 1951.

Gottingen was the seat of the Max Planck Society (MPS), newly established as the successor to the former Kaiser Wilhelm Society. Manfred worked as an assistant to Karl-Friedrich Bonhoeffer, head of the Max Planck Institute (MPI) for Physical Chemistry. Manfred inherited this position in 1964, after being elected as a scientific member of the MPS and department director. A mere 3 years later, he shared the Nobel Prize for Chemistry for his pathbreaking invention and application of relaxation methods for studying ultrafast chemical reactions. In 1971, Manfred's dream of an MPI exploiting the synergism of research in physics, chemistry, and biology under one roof took form as the MPI for Biophysical Chemistry (MPIBPC), where he directed the Department of Biochemical Kinetics. His sustained vision catapulted the MPIBPC to great success, including three Nobel Prizes. (Manfred had less luck in trying to establish an MPI for Music with composer Pierre Boulez as director.) After his formal retirement in 1995, he was a frequent guest of Richard Lerner, the then-president of the Scripps Research Institute in La Jolla, California.

Manfred's Nobel Prize marked a turning point in his research. In the ensuing decades, he focused on the origin and definition of “life” and “information,” leading to the establishment of a revolutionary theoretical framework for evolution, also examined experimentally. Manfred and his colleagues concluded that Darwin's principle of natural selection, operating through nonlinear feedback processes, leads to optimal performance via the mechanisms of reproductive multiplication, variation through mutation and recombination, adaptation through selection, and proliferation of well-functioning descendants. Over 15 years, Manfred labored on his monumental monograph From Strange Simplicity to Complex Familiarity. He cites chemist Leslie Orgel, a pioneer in origin-of-life research, as the person who most affected his work. Manfred aimed to serve the needs of society through evolutionary biotechnology based on the research instruments he developed to explore the dynamic properties of evolving populations of molecules and organisms. Along with colleagues, he founded the companies Evotec Biosystems and Direvo Biotech to promote the use of these tools in biomedicine, including for drug discovery.

Manfred had a deep, intuitive grasp of physics, chemistry, mathematics, and biology. He was unassuming, but not humble, as he was supremely confident in his ability to perceive important challenges and meet them using his own abilities and those of others he inspired. Throughout his career, he recruited exceptionally competent colleagues, summoning their best efforts by example and propelling them on their own distinguished careers. Manfred also attracted a continuous stream of prominent visitors, mesmerized by his magnetic, eloquent personality and intellect, his engaging smile, and his refined sense of humor. Manfred's Courses, Gottingen Colloquia, Winter (ski) Seminars, and “Teestunden” (rapid-fire afternoon discussions) were legendary, demanding, instructive, fun, and almost always accompanied by music.

We both joined Manfred in 1967. I.P. was the first Israeli postdoc to study in Germany after the Holocaust, and T.J. came from a postdoc at Stanford University. With labmates Rudolf Rigler and Ernst Grell, we sought to apply the new relaxation kinetics methods in biology; it was the heyday of allosterism. In unforgettable Teestunden, Manfred elaborated the middle way between the sequential induced fit model of Daniel Koshland (former editor-in-chief of Science ) and the concerted model of Monod, Wyman, and Changeux.

Manfred was very generous with his time and advice. Although we never saw him with a pipette, he was a stickler for optimal design of instruments, experiments, and data analysis. Because of his engaging personality, a spirit of congeniality imbued the institute, extending to the personnel of the many workshops, who revered Manfred and became our personal friends as a result.

Manfred was a committed humanist and a German with a profound sense of responsibility for the obligations to the Jewish people and the nation of Israel. During the early days of rapprochement after World War II, he was instrumental in establishing close ties with Israel's scientific community, particularly the Weizmann Institute of Science, serving on its Board of Governors, and the Hebrew University of Jerusalem. Those relationships were personal, prolific, deep, and enduring.

In Europe, Manfred was an untiring promoter of science and scientists. He served as president of the German Academic Scholarship Foundation, member of the German Science Council, and chairperson of the European Molecular Biology Organization (EMBO) Council. He communicated eloquently and directly with society about pressing issues, such as the mad cow disease hysteria in 2001. Manfred was awarded numerous honorary degrees and was elected to many academic societies, including the U.S. National Academy of Sciences.

Manfred is survived by his second wife, scientist Ruthild Oswatitsch-Eigen, who accompanied him on his scientific journey for more than 50 years, and the children of his first marriage, Angela and Gerald. Along with them and his many colleagues, we will greatly miss the humanity, warmth, and intellect of this extraordinary individual, who now joins the historical pantheon of great scientists.

https://openalex.org/W2952564497,"Yra1 is an mRNA export adaptor involved in mRNA biogenesis and export in S. cerevisiae. Yra1 overexpression was recently shown to promote accumulation of DNA:RNA hybrids favoring DNA double strand breaks (DSB), cell senescence and telomere shortening, via an unknown mechanism. Yra1 was also identified at an HO-induced DSB and Yra1 depletion causes defects in DSB repair. Previous work from our laboratory showed that Yra1 ubiquitination by Tom1 is important for mRNA export. Here, we found that Yra1 is also ubiquitinated by the SUMO-targeted ubiquitin ligases Slx5-Slx8 implicated in the interaction of irreparable DSB with nuclear pores. We further show that Yra1 binds an HO-induced irreparable DSB in a process dependent on resection. Importantly, a Yra1 mutant lacking the evolutionarily conserved C-box is not recruited to an HO-induced irreparable DSB and becomes lethal under DSB induction in a HO-cut reparable system. Together, the data provide evidence that Yra1 plays a crucial role in DSB repair via homologous recombination. While Yra1 sumoylation and/or ubiquitination are dispensable, the Yra1 C-box region is essential in this process."
https://openalex.org/W2925357640,"My lab bench was strewn with tubes and pipettes—remnants of an experiment that had refused to work for several weeks. I was slouched against the bench, deep in despair. It was a far cry from how I had felt just a few months earlier, when I started my master's research project. At that point, I thought I had cracked the code to academic success. After years of excelling in the classroom thanks to intensive studying, the idea that I would be rewarded if I worked hard enough was deeply rooted in me. So I spent long hours in the lab, steadily filled pages in my notebook, and was praised for my diligence. When my experiments didn't produce the exciting results they were supposed to, I thought I just needed to work more.

Yet here I was, working harder than ever—but not getting anywhere. I didn't know what to do.

It was late in the evening. One other person was still in the lab: A postdoc, who noticed my distress, came over and gently asked how I was doing. I told him about my struggles with the experiment. I didn't tell him that I was also wondering what was wrong with me and that I felt like a failure. After we talked through the experiment, the postdoc said, “I think it's time to go home and get some sleep.” He added with a smile, “Taking a break is also hard work, you know?”

Those comments planted the seed of a new approach. Previously, when my nonresearch friends questioned whether the “always working” ethos that is common among academics was normal or healthy, I had brushed off their concerns. Now, I realized that they were on to something. I started to go easier on myself, to try to make being in the lab from early morning to late evening the exception rather than the norm. Pushing back against the belief that long working hours are the hallmark of a good researcher was hard, and I slipped back into my old routine more than once. But things got a little better. I felt less stressed and my research started to progress. Yet, in the back of my head I still felt guilty for not working “enough.” I hadn't fully understood what the postdoc was trying to tell me.

A few years later, during my Ph.D., the penny dropped the rest of the way. My adviser and I were at a cafe, discussing a hurdle facing our field of nanomedicine and many other biomedical fields: that research rarely translates to improved clinical outcomes. As he finished his coffee and rubbed his forehead, he said, “We need to work smarter, not harder.” I had never heard that mantra before, although I now know it is common, and it resonated with me. It also helped me see how academia is often set up around the opposite premise: Working harder and longer is seen as a virtue, regardless of how “smart” that work is.

That conversation helped me understand that exciting, novel ideas do not come from a mind constantly under pressure. My best ideas and “aha” moments almost always come after I allow my mind to relax, to drift—whether that's playing video games with my brother, cooking a nice dinner, or going on long hikes with my wife. Part of working smarter, I realized, can be taking a break. Fighting academia's norm of overwork to detach for a while and fully experience something else is an effort—but one worth making.

Today, a decade after that eye-opening evening in the lab, I try to pass this mindset on to my own students. Not too long ago, in the lab one night, I walked by one of my students slumped over her bench. I gently asked how she was doing. With a defeated look, she responded that the protocol refused to work, again, despite many attempts. I couldn't help but see myself all those years ago. We talked for a while about academic life and what it means to be a researcher. I asked her why we do what we do. Often it comes down to pursuing curiosity and passion.

How can we nurture that spirit? The answer does not include working ourselves to exhaustion. Work-life balance is not a detriment to excellent research, or an optional bonus, but an integral part of it.
