https://openalex.org/W2018624269,"The principal conclusion is that Fibonacci phyllotaxis follows as a mathematical necessity from the combination of an expanding apex and a suitable spacing mechanism for positioning new leaves. I have considered an inhibitory spacing mechanism at some length, as it is a plausible candidate. However, the same treatment would apply equally well to depletion of, or competition for, a compound by developing leaves, and could no doubt accommodate other ingredients. The mathematical principles involved are clear when it is assumed that only two leaves (the contacts) position a new leaf. There is some experimental evidence for this assumption. Nonetheless, it is not a precondition for Fibonacci phyllotaxis, since a computer model shows that this pattern is generated even when many leaves contribute to inhibition at a given point. Indeed, the Fibonacci pattern seems to be a robust and stable mathematical phenomenon, a finding which goes some way to explaining its widespread occurrence throughout the plant kingdom."
https://openalex.org/W2010192870,"A variety of recent experiments on both the static and the dynamic properties of vortices and flux-line lattices in the mixed state of the copper oxide superconductors are discussed. The experiments are of two basic types: (i) experiments that image the magnetic flux patterns either with magnetic decoration or neutrons and give information about static structures, and (ii) experiments that explore the dynamics of vortices either through the resistivity or other electrodynamic responses of the material. Results of these experiments argue in favor of the existence of a true phase transition in the high-field vortex state from a low-temperature superconducting vortex glass phase into a disordered high-temperature vortex fluid phase. The vortex glass phase transition model does a good job of explaining high-precision measurements of the dynamics at the transition. At low fields and temperatures, very long range hexatic order in the flux-line lattice is observed."
https://openalex.org/W2040407988,"Holocene deformation indicative of large subduction-zone earthquakes has occurred on two large thrust fault systems in the Humboldt Bay region of northern California. Displaced stratigraphic markers record three offsets of 5 to 7 meters each on the Little Salmon fault during the past 1700 years. Smaller and less frequent Holocene displacements have occurred in the Mad River fault zone. Elsewhere, as many as five episodes of sudden subsidence of marsh peats and fossil forests and uplift of marine terraces are recorded. Carbon-14 dates suggest that the faulting, subsidence, and uplift events were synchronous. Relations between magnitude and various fault-offset parameters indicate that earthquakes accompanying displacements on the Little Salmon fault had magnitudes of at least 7.6 to 7.8. More likely this faulting accompanied rupture of the boundary between the Gorda and North American plates, and magnitudes were about 8.4 or greater."
https://openalex.org/W2027584896,"Electrical resistances of polycrystalline fullerene (C60) films were monitored while the films were being doped in ultrahigh vacuum with potassium from a molecular-beam effusion source. Temperature- and concentration-dependent resistivities of KxC60 films in equilibrium near room temperature were measured. The resistance changes smoothly from metallic at x ≈ 3 to activated as x → 0 or x → 6. The minimum resistivity for K3C60 films is 2.2 milliohm-centimeters, near the Mott limit. The resistivities are interpreted in terms of a granular microstructure where K3C60 regions form nonpercolating grains, except perhaps at x ≈ 3. Stoichiometries at the resistivity extrema were determined by ex situ Rutherford backscattering spectrometry to be x = 3 ± 0.05 at the resistance minimum and x = 6 ± 0.05 at the fully doped resistance maximum."
https://openalex.org/W2032128903,"The East Pacific Barrier (EPB) is the most effective marine barrier to dispersal of tropical shallow-water fauna in the world today. The fossil record of corals in the eastern Pacific suggests this has been true throughout the Cenozoic. In the Cretaceous, the EPB was apparently less effective in limiting dispersal. Equatorial circulation in the Pacific then appears to have been primarily east to west and the existence of oceanic atolls (now drowned guyots) in the eastern Pacific probably aided dispersal. Similarly, in the middle and early Mesozoic and late Paleozoic, terranes in the central tropical Pacific likely served as stepping stones to dispersal of tropical shelf faunas, reducing the isolating effect of an otherwise wider Pacific Ocean (Panthalassa)."
https://openalex.org/W1980947846,"That the earth-crack ground rupturing of the Baldwin Hills was genetically related to high-pressure injection of fluid into the previously faulted and subsidence-stressed subsurface seems established beyond reasonable doubt (note geological structural maps and cross section line drawings). The fault activation appears to be a near-surface manifestation of stress-relief faulting triggered by fluid injection, a mechanism identified as being responsible for the 1962-1965 Denver earthquakes and for generation of small earthquakes at the Rangely oil field in W. Colorado. These examples of fault activation through response of stressed ground to artificially induced increases in subsurface fluid pressure demonstrate some of the mechanically predictable consequences of injection of fluid into the ground, a practice that is becoming increasingly widespread not only in secondary oil recovery operations, but as a means of industrial waste disposal and ground-water management. Experience in the Baldwin Hills suggests that although fluid injection operations may be conducted for beneficial purposes, the effects of such injection on the geologic fabric can be serious and far-reaching.

https://openalex.org/W1982737321,"Hydrogen can be used as an effective probe of the structure of semiconductor surfaces. Such surfaces consist of bonds with varying degrees of bond strain, and hydrogen can react with each selectively depending on the reaction conditions. This selectivity is derived from a reduced barrier to reaction associated with strained bonds. In this manner, hydrogen can be used to pick apart the surface one bond type at a time, thereby revealing the structure of even complex multilayer reconstructions. This method is used to directly show that the rest-layer of the Ge(111)-c(2 x 8) surface has a bulk structure."
https://openalex.org/W1994919499,"The chief conclusion to be drawn from the results of this study is that redwoods are amazingly vigorous. The results support both the lumber companies and the conservationists. There is no question that old growth giant redwoods must be preserved. Only commercial greed could be a basis for refuting that stand. On the other hand, the lumber companies seem to be supported in their contention that redwoods can be farmed without driving them to extinction. The central issue revolves around the old trees. And here profit is the big factor. Lumbering is an important industry in California, and redwood lumbering represents about 20 percent of the industry (l). Most of the big names in timber, such as Weyerhaeuser and Georgia-Pacific, are involved in logging the California redwood. At the current rate of logging, particularly of old growth stands, the Bank of America estimates that employment in Humboldt County will be down significantly by 1975 (4). It has been argued that tourism would more than compensate for the lower employment in logging. But not if the trees that the tourists come to see are gone. Why can't young and mature trees be harvested at a reasonable rate, the old trees saved, and both tourism and logging flourish? The question posed earlier has been answered. Redwood growth and survival can be modeled, using matrix methods in a new context. Meaningful conclusions may be drawn. And the results are sufficiently tantalizing to inspire further research."
https://openalex.org/W2062365661,X-ray emission from the Cygnus Loop was observed in the energy region around 0.2 to 1 kiloelectronvolt with a collector that focused x-rays along one dimension while scanning across the nebula. The total integrated intensity is 1.3x 10(-8) erg per square centimeter per second. The one-dimensional x-ray structure has the same angular size-about 3 degrees-as the outermost boundaries of the optical filaments. There is no increase in x-ray emission at the center of the nebula nor at the strong feature that is seen in certain radio maps. The x-ray spectrum is consistent with thermal radiation from a hot plasma at a temperature of about 4 x 10(6) degrees K with evidence for a line at 19 angstroms corresponding to the 2p-->1s transition of O VIII.

https://openalex.org/W2034740430,"Two possible interpretations of the recent soft x-ray observation of the Cygnus Loop are discussed. A synchrotron model requires a magnetic field less than 10-6 gauss and electron energies in excess of 1014 electron volts. These electrons must either have been reaccelerated or continuously injected into the source for about 50,000 years. The observations are also consistent with the radiation from a hot plasma having the cosmic abundances of the elements. A likely origin for the hot plasma is a blast wave produced by the explosion of a supernova in the interstellar medium. Fitting such a model to the observations implies a kinetic energy release in the explosion of 6 × 1050 ergs, for an assumed distance of 770 parsec."

Most of the volcanics were erupted about 4500 years ago and overlie a regionally extensive paleosol which developed largely during the last glaciation."
