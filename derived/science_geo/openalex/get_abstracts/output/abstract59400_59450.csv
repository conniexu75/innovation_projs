https://openalex.org/W2050764161,"A significant number of schizophrenic patients show patterns of smooth pursuit eye-tracking patterns that differ strikingly from the generally smooth eye-tracking seen in normals and in nonschizophrenic patients. These deviations are probably referable not only to motivational or attentional factors, but also to oculomotor involvement that may have a critical relevance for perceptual dysfunction in schizophrenia."
https://openalex.org/W1580463159,"Abstract Intact mitochondria from human, beef, and rat heart, as well as rat brain and rat skeletal and smooth muscle, contain considerable creatine kinase activity; those from rat or rabbit liver, kidney, and testis contain essentially none. In rat heart mitochondria creatine kinase activity is far higher than the activity of adenylate kinase and nucleoside diphosphokinase. The heart mitochondrial creatine kinase is specific for ATP and ADP as phosphate donor and acceptor. The optimum pH is 6.7 in the direction of ATP formation and 8.0 in the direction of phosphocreatine formation. The mitochondrial isoenzyme of creatine kinase is not present in the same compartment as the intermembrane marker enzyme adenylate kinase, but may be released in soluble form by exposure to sodium acetate or sodium phosphate medium at pH 7.4. The phosphorylation of creatine by intact mitochondria takes place outside the atractyloside-sensitive ADP-ATP carrier system of the inner membrane and thus requires external ATP. When creatine in the concentration range known to be present in intact heart is added to rat heart mitochondria neither the initial State 4 or State 3 rate of respiration (succinate) is affected; however, there is a large increase in the State 4 rate following addition of ADP, whose magnitude increases as the creatine concentration is increased. In the presence of physiological concentrations of creatine and ADP rat heart mitochondria respire at a constant high rate equal to 75 to 85% of their maximal State 3 rate; under these conditions phosphocreatine is the end product of oxidative phosphorylation. The Km values for rat heart mitochondria are 35 µm for ADP, 0.72 mm for phosphocreatine, 100 µm for ATP, and 6 mm for creatine. These and other properties suggest that in addition to the ∼P storage function usually postulated for it, the phosphocreatine-creatine kinase system serves to smooth out or buffer the rate of respiration of heart mitochondria at a high and constant rate, as well as to channel ∼P to the contractile system via the mitochondrial and sarcoplasmic isoenzymes of creatine kinase."
https://openalex.org/W1486293218,"Abstract The levels of total magnesium in rat liver, brain, and kidney have been determined, and the distribution of the magnesium between free and bound forms has been calculated. Total tissue magnesium measured by atomic absorption was found to be 6.92, 8.25, and 10.4 µmoles per g wet weight of brain, kidney cortex, and liver, respectively. The calculation of the intracellular free magnesium concentrations (free [Mg2+]) in these tissues was approached experimentally in two different ways. In the first method the concentration of the magnesium binding sites and the corresponding stability constants were determined experimentally for the various fractions of tissue and were used together with the total [Mg] to calculate the free [Mg2+]. Operationally, the tissue was separated into three fractions: the insoluble binding sites (those sedimented at 40,000 x g for 30 min), the soluble binding sites (large molecules of molecular weight g1000 remaining in the supernatant after centrifugation), and the (small molecules of molecular weight l1000). Using various tissue dilutions and magnesium concentrations, the binding to insoluble and soluble binding sites was studied with centrifugation and equilibrium dialysis techniques. By Scatchard-type plots estimates of the concentrations of these binding sites and the corresponding constants could be made. The concentrations of insoluble binding sites were estimated to be 3.0, 2.0, and 2.8 µmoles per g wet weight of brain, kidney, and liver, respectively, with corresponding binding constants of 4,300, 1,860, and 3,740 kg wet weight of tissue per mole of binding sites. The concentration of soluble binding sites was estimated to be 4.7 and 10.6 µmoles per g wet weight in kidney and liver, respectively, with corresponding binding constants of 727 and 532 kg wet weight of tissue per mole of binding sites. From these values and the concentrations of a number of metabolites measured in freeze-clamped tissue and their binding constants, the free [Mg2+] could be calculated from a complex polynomial of the form: [see PDF for equation] where free [Mg2+] = [MgB1]/([B1] - [MgB1])K1 and MgB1 is the concentration of the magnesium complex and K1 the binding constant of the first binding agent; and Bi and Ki are the concentration and binding constant respectively of the ith binding agent. The second method for the calculation of the free [Mg2+] involves the use of the equilibrium constant of aconitate hydratase (EC 4.2.1.3). The measured Σcitrate/Σisocitrate (concentrations of total citrate/total ls(+)-isocitrate) in freeze-clamped tissue was compared with the equilibrium ratios in vitro for the aconitate hydratase reactions at various free [Mg2+], 38°, ionic strength = 0.25, [K+] = 125 mm, and [Na+] = 25 mm. Free intracellular [Mg2+] was calculated to range between 0.6 and 1.3 µmoles per g wet weight in all tissues studied. The values obtained with the two independent methods showed good agreement. From the similarity of these values with those estimated by other authors in various extracellular fluids, it is implied that there is little or no free [Mg2+] gradient between intracellular and extracellular fluids in spite of very different total magnesium concentrations between tissue and extracellular fluid. It is also implied that the free [Mg2+] like pH is relatively constant in various tissues and extracellular fluids, the free [Mg2+] being buffered by relatively large concentrations of bound magnesium and magnesium-binding sites."

https://openalex.org/W1674445303,"Abstract The metabolism of 4-[4-14C]androstene-3,17-dione, 4-[4-14C]pregnene-3,20-dione, 5α-[4-14C]androstane-3α,17β-diol, 4,16-[7α-3H]androstadien-3-one, [4-14C]cholesterol, and 7α-hydroxy-4-[6β-3H]cholesten-3-one was studied in the microsomal fraction of livers from adult male and female rats which had been castrated neonatally or postpubertally. The effect of testosterone propionate treatment on postpubertally castrated male and female rats was also studied with respect to the hepatic microsomal metabolism of the mentioned steroid substrates. It was found that the different microsomal enzyme activities could be grouped into three categories according to their specific characteristics. One category of enzymes (represented by the 2β-hydroxylase active on 5α-androstane-3α,17β-diol, the 6β-hydroxylase active on 4-androstene-3,17-dione and 4-pregnene-3,20-dione, and the 18-hydroxylase active on 5α-androstane-3α, 17β-diol) was more active in male than in female rats. This sexual difference was completely abolished both by postpubertal and neonatal testectomy. The activities of the enzymes in this group were stimulated by treatment with testosterone propionate. A second category of enzymes (the 2α-hydroxylase active on 4-pregnene-3,20-dione and 5α-androstane-3α,17β-diol, the 16α-hydroxylase active on 4-androstene-3,17-dione, the Δ16-C19 steroid epoxidase active on 4,16-androstadien-3-one, and the 17β-hydroxysteroid reductase active on 4-androstene-3,17-dione) was generally much more active in male than in female rats. Only neonatal testectomy completely abolished this sexual difference, whereas postpubertal testectomy reduced but did not abolish the differences in enzyme activities between male and female rats. Testosterone propionate treatment led to increased activities of these enzymes. The third category of enzymes (the 7α-hydroxylase active on 4-androstene-3,17-dione and cholesterol, the 12α-hydroxylase active on 7α-hydroxy-4-cholesten-3-one, and the 16α-hydroxylase active on 4-pregnene-3,20-dione) was generally slightly more active in female than in male rats. The activities of the enzymes in this group were not significantly affected by neonatal or postpubertal gonadectomy or by treatment with testosterone propionate. Based on these findings the microsomal steroid-metabolizing enzyme activities may be grouped into three classes with regard to the mechanisms regulating their activity: (a) enzymes with a basal activity level regulated by nongonadal factors but reversibly inducible by androgens; (b) enzymes irreversibly imprinted or programmed by androgens during the prepubertal period and reversibly stimulated by androgens postpubertally; and (c) enzymes primarily regulated by nongonadal factors and only slightly affected by androgens. The 5α-reductase active on 4-androstene-3,17-dione, 4-pregnene-3,20-dione and 7α-hydroxy-4-cholesten-3-one is basally regulated by nongonadal factors in both male and female rats. In addition, the activity of this enzyme in male rats, which is about 8 to 10 times lower than that in female rats, is suppressed by testicular androgens by two mechanisms: (a) irreversibly by prepubertal imprinting or programming; and (b) reversibly by postpubertal suppression."
https://openalex.org/W1482154419,"Abstract Rat liver microsomes contain three spectrally distinguishable forms of cytochrome P-450. Each form is identified qualitatively and quantitatively by visible spectral changes that occur when the cytochromes P-450 combine with various ligands, such as cyanide. In addition to cytochrome P-450, rat liver microsomes also contain cytochrome b5, which may be removed from the microsomes by digestion with Subtilisin VII. The relative amounts and spectral properties of the three forms of cytochrome P-450 remaining in treated particles are not altered by the partial proteolytic digestion. With difference spectral assays, methods have been developed for the chromatographic separation of the three forms of cytochrome P-450 in Subtilisin-treated particles. The particles are first treated with deoxycholate, and the clarified suspension is chromatographed on diethylaminoethylcellulose; a discontinuous gradient of KCl is used. Analysis of the affinities of the three separated forms (Forms I, II, and III) for various ligands yields the following binding constants for cyanide: Form I, K = 0.5 mm; Form II, K = 1.5 mm; Form III, K = 5.0 mm; and for octylamine: Form I, K1 = 0.025 mm and K2 = 0.12 mm; Form II, K1 = 0.016 mm and K2 = 0.056 mm; Form III, K = 0.30 mm. The binding constants are essentially identical with those observed for the three forms of cytochrome P-450 in microsomes and Subtilisin-treated particles. Thus, Subtilisin treatment, solubilization, or chromatography does not alter either the relative amounts of the three forms or their difference spectral characteristics. Assays of the three forms after various pretreatments of rats have been undertaken. The relative amounts of the three forms of cytochrome P-450 are altered by pretreatment of the rats. Form III is increased by pretreatment with 3-methylcholanthrene; Form II is preferentially induced by phenobarbital; and dietary ethyl alcohol preferentially induces Form I, the form of cytochrome P-450 that exhibits the highest affinity for cyanide. Thus, this work has provided not only an assay for the various forms of cytochrome P-450 and a chromatographic separation for future work on recombination of the multienzymic oxidases, but a functional relationship for the three forms is suggested by the induction experiments. These are only spectrally identifiable forms that may be separated by these procedures, and, to date, there is no information on whether or not these forms differ structurally."
https://openalex.org/W1551211932,"Abstract The interaction of human plasma retinol-binding protein with plasma prealbumin was studied by the techniques of velocity ultracentrifugation and polarization of retinol fluorescence. In the first method the unbound fraction of retinol-binding protein, which sediments more slowly than its complexes with prealbumin, was measured by its absorption. A stoichiometry of retinol-binding protein to prealbumin, 4:1 was found. The polarization of fluorescence of retinol increases when retinol-binding protein combines with prealbumin; the relaxation time of retinol-binding protein was 6.6 x 10-8 s at 25° and increased to 28 x 10-8 s for the complex. The polarization data indicate that there are four independent binding sites with an apparent association constant of approximately 1.2 x 106 m-1 at 25° and pH 7.4. The affinity was maximal near pH 7.4 and decreased gradually at lower and higher pH values. Between pH 6.0 and 9.4, the extent of interaction between retinol-binding protein and prealbumin was dependent on ionic strength. In this pH range almost no binding occurred without added salt and the affinity increased rapidly with increasing KCl concentration to 0.1 m. At pH values below 6 the interaction was less dependent on ionic strength and became independent at pH 4.2."

https://openalex.org/W2112031479,"The spatial limitations of stereoscopic vision were studied by using vertical line stimuli containing sinusoidal disparity variations such that different parts of the line appeared at different depths. Stimuli with a finer grain than about 3 cycles per degree did not elicit depth perception, even though the sinusoidal curvature was clearly visible monocularly. At low spatial frequencies of curvature, stereoacuity was limited to the same extent as the monocular sensitivity. The limiting disparity for Panum's fusional region and the upper depth limit are subject to a scaling effect in proportion to stimulus dimensions. The disparity scaling can be characterized by a fixed maximum angular difference between the parts of the stereoscopic half-images."

The changes in the ratio of carbon-13 to carbon-12 in carbon dioxide expired after oral glucose administration were determined by mass spectrometry. In six healthy male volunteers, the administration of glucose resulted in a marked, reproducible rise in the isotopic ratio in expired carbon dioxide; the ratio reached its maximum at 4 hours and then declined progressively."
https://openalex.org/W1574201030,"Abstract Salmon calcitonin (synthetic) was iodinated with the chloramine-T method and purified by gel filtration. The product was virtually free of uniodinated molecules as determined by enzymatic digestion and amino acid analysis. Greater than 80% of the incorporated iodine was in the form of monoiodotyrosine. The iodinated hormone bound specifically to renal and skeletal receptors and was indistinguishable from the uniodinated species by bioassays based on either the renal or skeletal action of calcitonin. The degradation of salmon 125I-calcitonin by renal plasma membranes was inhibited by agents that did not block the high affinity binding to receptors. Hormone bound to receptors remained biologically intact; after elution from receptors the hormone bound specifically to fresh membranes. High affinity, low capacity sites similar to those identified in renal plasma membranes were also found in membranes prepared from skeletal tissue; the apparent affinity constants were in the range of 1011 m-1 for each tissue. High affinity receptors for calcitonin were found in renal membrane preparations containing brush borders as well as preparations, presumably antiluminal in origin, that did not contain brush borders."
https://openalex.org/W1550540627,"Abstract A purification procedure for a poly(A) polymerase has been developed for calf thymus tissue which gives a protein without detectable ribonuclease activity. During the purification, a manganese stimulated poly(A) synthesis is removed and poly(A) synthesis becomes dependent on exogenous polyribonucleotides. This same purification procedure applied to calf thymus nuclei gives a poly(A) polymerase activity indistinguishable from that of homogenates of the whole tissue. The most purified polymerase shows one major band after electrophoresis on polyacrylamide gel. A molecular weight of 140,000 to 160,000 has been estimated by gel filtration analysis. The polymerase is highly specific for ATP and is inhibited by other ribonucleoside triphosphates. It is more active in the presence of Mg++ than Mn++ and is inhibited at 0.1 ionic strength. Polymerization of ATP can proceed at linear rates for several hours. Some basic kinetic properties of the reaction have been studied. The reaction is insensitive to high levels of cordycepin, α-amanitin, and actinomycin D."
https://openalex.org/W1512435793,"The effects of hypophysectomy on amino acid metabolism were studied both in vivo and in the perfused rat liver. Hypophysectomized rats exhibited elevated plasma urea concentrations and reduced plasma and liver amino acid levels, while perfused livers from these animals showed enhanced rates of amino acid uptake. No effect of hypophysectomy on hepatic amino acid transport was noted, suggesting that the enhanced hepatic amino acid uptake resulted from an increased flux through the metabolic pathway (or pathways) operating in the liver. Livers from hypophysectomized rats produced substantially more glucose and urea than livers from normal animals when both were perfused with medium containing various levels of amino acids. The rate of glucose synthesis from either labeled alanine, pyruvate, glutamate, or aspartate was stimulated 3- to 4-fold in livers from hypophysectomized rats, showing an increased flux of amino acids through the pathway of gluconeogenesis. Treatment of hypophysectomized rats with growth hormone for 2 days returned the rate of gluconeogenesis from alanine toward normal, although the reversion was incomplete. The data suggested that the enhanced hepatic utilization of amino acids following hypophysectomy resulted from increased metabolism of the compounds in the liver, involving increased fluxes through the pathways of gluconeogenesis and ureogenesis."

Under these conditions, the carboxylase was activated by fructose-6-P and deactivated by fructose-1,6-P2, two intermediates of the reductive pentose phosphate cycle. Activation by fructose-6-P was most pronounced at a limiting level of Mg2+ or at neutral or acidic pH. Fructose-6-P induced a shift from sigmoidal to Michaelian kinetics and decreased (up to a factor of 6) the Km for bi-bicarbonate. Fructose-6-P also decreased the Km for Mg2+ and increased the Km for ribulose-1,5-P2. On deactivation by fructose-1,6-P2, the carboxylase showed, in general, its original kinetic characteristics. Certain other intermediates of the reductive pentose phosphate cycle (ribulose-5-P, xylulose-5-P, erythrose-4-P, ribose-5-P) also activated the carboxylase, but less effectively than did fructose-6-P. 6-Phosphogluconate, a compound not formed by chloroplasts, was a strong activator of the enzyme; its mode of action resembled that of fructose-6-P. Fructose-1,6-P2 was the only intermediate of the reductive pentose phosphate cycle that deactivated the carboxylase. Two intermediates in starch synthesis, glucose-1,6-P2 and glucose-6-P, deactivated the carboxylase as well as did fructose-1,6-P2. A regulatory mechanism based on these and other findings is proposed for the conversion of CO2 to starch in photosynthesis."
https://openalex.org/W1506526502,"Abstract 1. Epidermal prekeratin, which has a molecular weight of 640,000 and an α helix content of about 40%, has been subjected to a specific procedure involving limited tryptic digestion. Upon acidification, the digest yielded a highly α helical precipitate which contained all of the α helix of prekeratin, and a supernatant. 2. The redissolved precipitate was separable by Sephadex G-200 chromatography into major α helical Fractions I and II and minor non-α helical Fractions III and IV. Fraction II was produced in increasing amounts by cleavage of Fraction I and was a relatively stable product of proteolysis. 3. Isolated Fraction II was 83% α helical and exhibited a large degree of size homogeneity. It had a molecular weight of 46,400, a length of about 200 A, and was enriched in helix-favoring residues. It had three NH2-terminal amino acids and, in sodium dodecyl sulfate or urea solutions, dissociated into three chains which had molecular weights of 17,000, 15,200, and 15,000, and were present in the estimated ratio of 1.00:1.07:0.89. The three chains in the Fraction II molecule were shown to be arranged side-by-side and to interact solely through secondary forces. 4. The material in the supernatant of the acidified digest was enriched in helix-inhibiting residues. 5. It was concluded that the α helix of prekeratin occurs in discrete regions, about 200 A long, which consist of a continuous or segmented triple α helix. Between these regions are non-α helical regions in which helix-inhibiting residues are preferentially located."

https://openalex.org/W1612482068,"Abstract The effects of temperature on two membrane transport systems in alveolar macrophages and one system in polymorphonuclear leukocytes which have been well characterized at 37° were analyzed. The results show a discontinuity in the Arrhenius plots (transition temperature) for both the alveolar macrophage systems but none in the polymorphonuclear leukocytes. A detailed analysis of the specificity of nucleoside transport in alveolar macrophages reveals a marked temperature dependence which is reflected mainly in requirements at the 3' (ribose)-position. Pretreatment of the alveolar macrophages with colchicine alkaloids results in a transport system for nucleosides which shows no transition temperature and has the specificity and activation energy of the untreated system in the low temperature range. On the basis of these findings it is proposed that the nucleoside carrier exists as two or more conformers, one of which is favored by high temperatures, and the other by low temperatures or colchicine alkaloids."

https://openalex.org/W1502479830,"Abstract The rate of lysozyme-catalyzed reaction of the β(1 → 4)-linked hexasaccharide of N-acetylglucosamine was determined at 40°, 0.1 ionic strength, and pH 2 to 10.5. Reaction rate was determined by measuring increase in reducing sugar for the hydrolysis reaction or by charcoal column analysis for the transglycosylation reaction. At all pH values, only one bond in the hexasaccharide is cleaved. Apparent first order kinetics is followed at substrate concentrations above Km, in accord with equally strong binding of hexasaccharide substrate and tetrasaccharide product. Measurements of the hydrolysis reaction above 10-4 m substrate were complicated by transglycosylation to the substrate as acceptor. The pH profile gave for κcat the kinetic apparent pK values 3.8 and 6.7 and a maximum value of κcat 0.15 s-1, and for κcat/Km the pK values 4.2 and 6.1. Equilibrium measurements of hexasaccharide binding at 40° and 0.1 ionic strength showed that Km equals Ks, with maximum value 9 x 10-6 m at pH 5. Detailed interpretation of the pH profiles was carried out under the assumptions that non-productive complexes are of kinetic importance and the structure of the productive complex and the catalytic mechanism are those suggested by the crystallography. This analysis gave for the free enzyme and nonproductive enzyme-hexamer complex, respectively, the values pK 6.1 and pK 6.7 for Glu-35 and pK 3.4 to 3.7 and pK 3.8 for Asp-52."

https://openalex.org/W1598862427,"Abstract A difference hydrogen exchange method was developed and applied to hemoglobin. The method can be used to pick out, from the total hydrogen exchange curve of a protein, the hydrogen exchange behavior of just those segments of the protein that alter in exchange rate in response to structural change. With the method even quite subtle structure changes can be individually recognized since protein mechanisms act to translate structure changes into greatly amplified hydrogen exchange signals. A fraction of hemoglobin's hydrogen exchange curve containing about 40% of the protein's hydrogen-bonded peptide groups was analyzed. Among these the difference techniques portrayed the exchange behavior of 20 ligand-responsive hydrogens in reduced and liganded hemoglobin and also the exchange of 30 ligand-indifferent hydrogens. The ligand-responsive hydrogens fall into three kinetically distinct groups having 3, 8, and 9 hydrogens on a per subunit basis. All three groups experience much faster exchange in the liganded form of the protein. The exchange character of these groups demonstrates that their exchange, and probably protein hydrogen exchange in general, is controlled by breathing reactions—cooperative, reversible denaturations—of the segments of protein structure holding them. This picture leads immediately to a quantitative relationship connecting energetic structure change, breathing change, and alteration in hydrogen exchange rate. The results, interpreted in this way, show that when ligand is bound to hemoglobin the two larger responsive segments studied are destabilized by close to 2 Cal in structural free energy and the smaller one by perhaps 4 Cal."

https://openalex.org/W1990190695,"Treatment of HeLa S(3) cells with actinomycin D during mitosis suppresses the synthesis of several major classes of nonhistone chromosomal proteins during the subsequent period before DNA replication, but allows the synthesis of other species of these proteins. Such results are consistent with the utilization of preexisting, as well as newly transcribed, messenger RNA's for nonhistone chromosomal protein synthesis during the prereplicative phase of the cell cycle."
https://openalex.org/W1965354366,"The dynamic mechanical response of fresh human cancellous bone at low audio frequencies contains two resonance spectra. The spectral frequencies in each series have the ratios 1:4:9:16 ... n2. The frequencies are in quantitative agreement with the concept of momentum wave modes of calcium and phosphorus atoms in the lamellae, with no variable parameters."
https://openalex.org/W2019243563,"The diffusion coefficient of potassium ion (DK) in frog muscles was studied by a new method. In normal cytoplasm DK averaged one-eighth of the value in the free solution. Arrest of metabolism or injury caused an increase in DK. In muscles killed with iodoacetate, DK rose to three-quarters of the value in free solution. The data support the association-induction hypothesis."

Micropuncture studies indicate that the cystic fluid has a variable sodium concentration, but that the ratios of inulin concentration in tubular fluid to that in plasma are high."
https://openalex.org/W1591859959,"Abstract Previous experiments have shown that pepsinogen reacts with the cottonseed pigment gossypol in the presence of ethanol to form a stable complex with little or no potenitial pepsin activity. We now find the reaction is both temperature- and alcohol-dependent, suggesting a conformational change in the zymogen prior to reaction with gossypol. A yellow, ninhydrin-positive material has been recovered from the acid hydrolysate of borohydride-reduced, gossypol-inactivated pepsinogen. This material is identical with synthetic lysine-gossypol prepared by the reduction of the gossypol-lysine Schiff base. These results confirm that inactivation is due to Schiff base formation between the aldehyde functional groups of the gossypol and lysines 18 and 358 of the zymogen. Pyridoxal phosphate, another Schiff base-forming reagent, was found to protect pepsinogen from inactivation by gossypol. Gossypol has been found to be a good competitive inhibitor of pepsin with a Ki of 4.7 x 10-5 m when Z-Gly-Gly-Phe-Phe-3-(4-pyridyl)propyl-1-oxy was used as a substrate. Under the same conditions, pyridoxal phosphate does not inhibit pepsin at 1.25 x 10-3 m."

The alpha-esterase isozyme patterns of tumors, kidney, and brain are similar except that there is an additional slowest-moving form of esterase in all tumor tissues. The malate dehydrogenase pattern is not altered in any of the tissues."

https://openalex.org/W1554801774,"Abstract Uridine-5'-diphospho-N-acetyl-2-amino-2-deoxy-3-O-lactylglucose:NADP-oxidoreductase, an enzyme which catalyzes the reduction of UDP-GlcNAc-enolpyruvate to form uridine-5'-diphospho-N-acetylmuramic acid, was further purified to 1520-fold purification from Enterobacter cloacae NRC 492. Its molecular weight was estimated to be 35,500 by Sephadex gel filtration method. The reductase was greatly stimulated by a number of monovalent cations (T1+ g K+ g NH4+ g Rb+ >> Li+ ≃ Na+). The activation by K+ gave a normal hyperbolic saturation curve with a Ka of 5.8 x 10-3 m. Hill plots suggested a single binding site for K+ in association with each catalytic center. The activation by K+ was instantaneous and did not cause any shift in the pH optimum. The increase in K+ concentration from 2 mm to 20 mm markedly lowered the apparent Km value for UDP-GlcNAc-enolpyruvate. The value changed from 10.5 x 10-6 m to 6.5 x 10-6m. Effect on the Km value for NADPH was small. The data were consistent with the proposal that K+ might be acting as a bridge between UDP-GlcNAc-enolpyruvate and the enzyme."
https://openalex.org/W1555682998,"Abstract Human peripheral lymphocytes were incubated in the presence of Phaseolus vulgaris phytohemagglutinin. The effect of external uridine in the culture on the rate of [14C]bicarbonate incorporation into the acid-soluble uridine nucleotides via the de novo pathway was examined. About 85 and 50% of the incorporation at 48 hours of culture without uridine were inhibited by the addition of uridine at a concentration of 1 x 10-3 m and 1 x 10-5 m, respectively. In order to find out the inhibition site, the effect of uridine on the rate of [14C]bicarbonate incorporation into carbamyl aspartate, the second intermediate of the de novo pathway, was examined. About 85% of the incorporation without uridine was inhibited by the addition of uridine at a concentration of 1 x 10-3 m. The results indicate that the inhibition site is the step of biosynthesis of either carbamyl phosphate or carbamyl aspartate. Our previous findings that aspartate transcarbamylase (EC 2.1.3.2) activity is approximately 100 times as much as that of carbamyl phosphate synthetase (EC 2.7.2.5) and that the latter enzyme is subjected to the feedback inhibition by uridine triphosphate suggested that the inhibition site is probably the step of carbamyl phosphate synthesis. An addition of uridine to the culture with phytohemagglutinin at 48 hours of incubation resulted in a rapid accumulation of uridine triphosphate and a concomitant inhibition of the [14C]bicarbonate incorporation into the acid-soluble uridine nucleotides, followed by replacement of the de novo pathway by the salvage pathway for pyrimidine biosynthesis."

https://openalex.org/W1591768733,"Sodium borohydride-reduced phosphorylase b dissociates completely to a monomeric form in 6.7% formamide, as determined by sedimentation velocity and equilibrium methods. No dissociation of the native enzyme occurs under these same conditions. A slow inactivation of NaBH4-reduced phosphorylase b occurs in formamide, and the degree of inactivation in different formamide concentrations seems related to the extent of dissociation. Removal of formamide by dialysis restores the enzymic activity and subunit structure. Results of several experiments suggest that the monomeric form is catalytically active. Approximately 30% activity remains after 1 hour of incubation in 6.7% formamide. After this stage, little change of enzymic activity occurs even after 7 hours of incubation. After 1 hour, sedimentation velocity experiments show that a single component is present with an s20,w of 5.6 S, indicating that dissociation is complete at this time. No change in s20,w was observed in the presence of substrates, glucose 1-phosphate, amylodextrin, and activator, AMP, indicating that reassociation of the monomer does not occur under conditions that closely approximate those used in the assay. Kinetic studies showed that the affinities of the enzyme with respect to its substrates and activator were reduced markedly by formamide. No homotropic interactions were seen with respect to AMP for the reduced enzyme incubated in formamide, further indicating the presence of an active monomer. Formamide affects the spectral properties of enzyme-bound pyridoxal phosphate in NaBH4-reduced phosphorylase b."
