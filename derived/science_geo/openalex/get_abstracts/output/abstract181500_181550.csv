Oxidative stress also limits the growth potential of human cells, and recent data show that the effect of mild oxidative stress is mediated by a stress-related increased rate of telomere shortening. Thus, fibroblast strains have donor-specific antioxidant defense, telomere shortening rate, and growth potential. We used low-density gene expression array analysis of fibroblast strains with different antioxidant potentials and telomere shortening rates to identify gene products responsible for these differences. Extracellular superoxide dismutase was identified as the strongest candidate, a correlation that was confirmed by Northern blotting. Over-expression of this gene in human fibroblasts with low antioxidant capacity increased total cellular superoxide dismutase activity, decreased the intracellular peroxide content, slowed the telomere shortening rate, and elongated the life span of these cells under normoxia and hyperoxia. These results identify extracellular superoxide dismutase as an important antioxidant gene product in human fibroblasts, confirm the causal role of oxidative stress for telomere shortening, and strongly suggest that the senescence-like arrest under mild oxidative stress is telomere-driven.

Nature. 2000; 408: 233-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (1247) Google Scholar). This might be true even for human cellular replicative senescence, which is the complete and irreversible loss of replicative capacity in telomerase-negative cells after a number of population doublings, a number that is constant under standard cell culture conditions. The ability to maintain telomeres above a critical length appears to be crucial for replicative senescence; mortal cells lose some DNA from the tips of telomeres with every round of DNA replication until they senesce (4Harley C.B. Futcher A.B. Greider C.W. Nature. 1990; 345: 458-460Crossref PubMed Scopus (4528) Google Scholar), and expression of telomerase in the same cells stabilizes telomere length and allows unlimited growth (5Bodnar A.G. Ouellette M. Frolkis M. Holt S.E. Chiu C.P. Morin G.B. Harley C.B. Shay J.W. Lichtsteiner S. Wright W.E. Science. 1998; 279: 349-352Crossref PubMed Scopus (4040) Google Scholar). Telomere shortening in telomerase-negative cells is partly caused by the inability of the DNA replication machinery to fully copy the very end of the lagging strand (the “end replication problem” (6Olovnikov A.M. J. Theor. Biol. 1973; 41: 181-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (1390) Google Scholar)), which sets a lower limit to the amount of telomeric sequence lost per generation. In addition, mild oxidative stress accelerates telomere shortening and is actually responsible for most of the shortening seen, for instance, in human fibroblasts under standard culture conditions (7von Zglinicki T. Pilger R. Sitte N. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2000; 28: 64-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (426) Google Scholar, 8von Zglinicki T. Saretzki G. Docke W. Lotze C. Exp. Cell Res. 1995; 220: 186-193Crossref PubMed Scopus (698) Google Scholar). Mild oxidative stress is not immediately cytostatic. However, it diminishes the replicative capacity of cells. A good experimental example of mild oxidative stress is chronic hyperoxia, which, depending on the oxygen partial pressure and the antioxidant properties of the cells, increases markers of oxidative stress such as malondialdehydes, protein carbonyls (9Sitte N. Merker K. Von Zglinicki T. Grune T. Davies K.J. FASEB J. 2000; 14: 2495-2502Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar), lipofuscin (10Sohal R.S. Marzabadi M.R. Galaris D. Brunk U.T. Free Radic.

Med. 2001; 31: 824-831Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar) and can seriously limit replicative capacity (8von Zglinicki T. Saretzki G. Docke W. Lotze C. Exp.

On the other hand, culture of cells under chronic hypoxia (down to about 3% oxygen partial pressure) results in a slower accumulation of stress markers (10Sohal R.S. Marzabadi M.R. Galaris D. Brunk U.T. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 1989; 6: 23-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar) and an increased replicative life span (13Balin A.K. Goodman D.B. Rasmussen H. Cristofalo V.J. J. Cell Biol. 1977; 74: 58-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar, 15Packer L. Fuehr K. Nature. 1977; 267: 423-425Crossref PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar, 16Chen Q. Fischer A. Reagan J.D. Yan L.J. Ames B.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 4337-4341Crossref PubMed Scopus (563) Google Scholar), indicating that the standard cell culture condition in itself already poses a mild oxidative stress. Interestingly, using different pro- and antioxidant treatments, telomere shortening per cell division could be varied by 1–2 orders of magnitude (for review, see Ref. 17von Zglinicki T. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2002; 27: 339-344Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1754) Google Scholar). A highly significant variation of telomere shortening rates was already found under constant environmental conditions comparing human fibroblast strains from different donors, and this variation was correlated to differences in antioxidant defense capacity (18von Zglinicki T. Serra V. Lorenz M. Saretzki G. Lenzen-Grossimlighaus R. Gessner R. Risch A. Steinhagen-Thiessen E. Lab. Invest. 2000; 80: 1739-1747Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar). However, such differences could not be explained completely by expression patterns of CuZn superoxide dismutase (CuZn-SOD),1manganese superoxide dismutase (Mn-SOD), and catalase (19Serra V. Grune T. Sitte N. Saretzki G. von Zglinicki T. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 2000; 908: 327-330Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). It was further shown that oxidative stress-induced single-strand breaks accumulate preferentially in telomeres (7von Zglinicki T. Pilger R. Sitte N. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2000; 28: 64-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (426) Google Scholar, 20Petersen S. Saretzki G. von Zglinicki T. Exp. Cell Res. 1998; 239: 152-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar) and that these breaks lead to faster telomere loss during DNA replication (21Sitte N. Saretzki G. von Zglinicki T. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 1998; 24: 885-893Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar), possibly by transiently stalling the replication fork (22von Zglinicki T. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 2000; 908: 99-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar). These results suggested that a telomere-specific deficiency of single-strand break repair causes the stress-dependence of telomere shortening. However, the gene products responsible for low telomeric repair efficiency are unknown. To identify possible candidate genes for antioxidant defense and telomere damage repair, we compared the expression patterns of stress-related genes in seven human fibroblast strains with different antioxidant capacity and different telomere shortening rates under conditions of both normoxia and hyperoxia. Of 234 genes, 11 showed a variation in the expression pattern, which correlated to antioxidant capacity and/or telomere shortening rate. Although there were four DNA modification/repair genes among them, a correlation of gene expression to telomere shortening rate was confirmed only for topoisomerase 1 (TOP1). The expression of three heat shock genes (HSP47, HSP90, and HSPB2) as well as two genes known to be involved in drug metabolism (NNMT and GST M1) correlated with differences in antioxidant defense capacity between strains. Most strikingly, among all antioxidant genes, extracellular superoxide dismutase (EC-SOD) was the one with the highest expression level, the greatest differences between cell strains, and the clearest correlation to both steady-state peroxide levels and telomere shortening rate. This result was confirmed using Northern blotting in a wider panel of cell lines. Higher EC-SOD expression correlated with a higher SOD activity in cell lysates. Over-expression of EC-SODincreased cellular SOD activity, elongated the replicative life span under normoxia and hyperoxia, and slowed down telomere shortening. We conclude that EC-SOD has a major function in the protection of human fibroblasts against mild oxidative stress and that prevention of telomere damage is a major part of this function. Human embryonic lung fibroblasts MRC-5 and WI-38 were obtained from ECACC and ATCC, respectively. Human foreskin fibroblasts (BJ strain) originated from the laboratory of J. R. Smith (Houston, TX). All other strains were dermal fibroblasts from adult donors. All strains were extensively characterized in our laboratory in terms of oxidative stress markers, growth potential and telomere length maintenance (12Lorenz M. Saretzki G. Sitte N. Metzkow S. von Zglinicki T. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2001; 31: 824-831Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 18von Zglinicki T. Serra V. Lorenz M. Saretzki G. Lenzen-Grossimlighaus R. Gessner R.

FEBS Lett. 2002; 516: 71-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium plus 10% fetal calf serum in parallel under either normoxia (control) or 40% normobaric hyperoxia using a three-gas cell culture incubator (Zapf Instruments, Sarstedt, Germany). An EC-SOD cDNA clone (24Hjalmarsson K. Marklund S.L. Engstroem A. Edlund T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 6340-6344Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar) was obtained from S. L. Marklund (Umea, Sweden). Full-length cDNA was cloned into pBabe-puro and verified by sequencing. MRC-5 fibroblasts at a population doubling (PD) level of 25–30 were transduced with either empty pBabe-puro or pBabe-EC-SOD retrovirus. Fibroblasts were grown for at least 1 week in parallel under either normoxia or hyperoxia and then stained with dihydrochlorofluorescin diacetate as described (12Lorenz M. Saretzki G. Sitte N. Metzkow S. von Zglinicki T. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2001; 31: 824-831Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). The fluorescence intensity of the intracellularly trapped dihydrochlorofluorescein (DCF) indicates the amount of intracellular peroxides and other oxidizing species. The DCF fluorescence in 2 × 104 cells was measured in a flow cytometer (PARTEC, Munster, Germany) using blue excitation and green emission wavelengths. The steady-state antioxidative capacity (AOC) was defined as the ratio DCF(normoxia)/DCF(hyperoxia), resulting in an AOC of 1 for cell strains that can completely counteract the rise in intracellular peroxides under chronic hyperoxic stress. Atlas Human Stress Arrays (Clontech) were used according to the manufacturer's manual. Total RNA from 1–2 × 107cells in logarithmic growth phase was DNase-treated, and poly(A) RNA was enriched by hybridization to biotinylated oligo(dT). Probes were labeled with 50 μCi of [α-33P]dATP during reverse transcription. cDNA was purified by column chromatography and hybridized to the arrays. Quantification was performed using ImageQuaNT software (Amersham Biosciences). The threshold for a hybridization signal was defined as at least two times background variation (determined as the average of all absolute background measurements). Signals lower than this threshold were excluded from the analysis. β-Actin was used as the reference signal. Reproducibility was demonstrated in two strains with independent RNA preparations. For each strain, processing and arraying of normoxia and hyperoxia samples were done in parallel. Threshold values were set at 2-fold for the comparison of expression data between normoxia and hyperoxia within the same strain, and at 3-fold for comparison of expression values between cell strains. RNA was prepared either as described above or using the RNeasy Total RNA kit (Qiagen). Northern blots were probed for Mn-SOD, EC-SOD , GADD153, and β-actin as control. Probes were generated by RT-PCR or by PCR using theEC-SOD cDNA (24Hjalmarsson K. Marklund S.L. Engstroem A. Edlund T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 6340-6344Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar) as template with the primers given in Table I. Fragments were gel-purified, tested by restriction analysis, and random prime labeled with 32P-dCTP. ImageQuaNT software (Amersham Biosciences) was used for quantitation.Table IPrimers for Northern probe production and semiquantitative RT-PCRGene5′-Forward primer-3′5′-Reverse primer-3′Product sizebpMn-SODTAC GTG AAC AAC CTG AAC GTC ACC GAG GGGT AGT AAG CGT GCT CCC ACA CAT CAA TCC400EC-SOD ITCC ATT TGT ACC GAA ACA CCC CGC TCA CCAA ACA TTC CCC CAA AGG AGC AGC TCT CAG330EC-SOD IITGG ATC CGA GAC ATG TAC GCC AGGTTC AGC AGA GGC GAA GGT GAG ACC738GADD153CTC AGC ATG CCT TGC GAA GAA CCTGA ATT TGG CCA CAA ACG CTT CC443MTH1GCC TTT GGG GGC AAA GTG CAA GCAA TGC CCC CAG GTG AAG ATG G448TOP1TGC TGA AGA GAC GAA TCA TGC CCG AGGGAA TTG CAA CAG CTC GAT TGG CAC GG771β-ActinATC TGG CAC CAC ACC TTC TAC ATT GAG CTG CGCGT CAT ACT CCT GCT TGC TGA TCC ACA TCT GC838 Open table in a new tab Genes for MTH1 and TOP1 were expressed at low level and thus were analyzed by RT-PCR (SuperScipt One-Step RT-PCR, Invitrogen). β-Actin was included as the reference control in each sample. Primers are given in Table I. PCR reactions were run for 30, 33, and 36 cycles to control the linearity of amplification. The expression of the EC-SOD transgene was also controlled by RT-PCR. RNA was reverse transcribed using random priming with Truescript RT (Hybaid-AGS), and cDNA equivalent to 50 ng of total RNA was used for a PCR reaction of 30 cycles at 58 °C. Two different non-overlapping primer pairs were used (see TableI). The 738-bp PCR band was cloned, and its correspondence to the cDNA sequence of EC-SOD was confirmed by sequencing. 2 × 106 cells were carefully washed and homogenized in 60 μl of phosphate buffer (25Marklund S.L. Biochem. J. 1990; 266: 213-219Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). After centrifugation the total SOD activity in the supernatant was measured using the Bioxytech SOD-525 Kit (OXIS Health Products). Cells at subconfluency were embedded in 0.65% low-melting agarose plugs at a density of 107cells/ml before treatment with proteinase K (7von Zglinicki T. Pilger R. Sitte N. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2000; 28: 64-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (426) Google Scholar). DNA was digested completely by HinfI (60 units/plug, Roche Molecular Biochemicals) at 37 °C. Plugs were analyzed in a 1% agarose gel by pulsed field gel electrophoresis (BioRad). Gels were blotted to Hybond N+ membranes (Amersham Biosciences) and hybridized with the telomeric probe (TTAGGG)4 directly conjugated to alkaline phosphatase (Promega, Madison, WI). A chemiluminescence signal was recorded on film within the linear range and analyzed in an imaging densitometer (BioRad). The average telomere length was calculated as the weighted mean of the optical density as described previously (20Petersen S. Saretzki G. von Zglinicki T. Exp. Cell Res. 1998; 239: 152-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar). The telomere shortening rate per PD was calculated as the slope of the linear regression. To test for nonspecific degradation of DNA, blots were rehybridized with the minisatellite probe (CAC)8, which was end-labeled with [32P-γ]ATP (7von Zglinicki T. Pilger R. Sitte N. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2000; 28: 64-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (426) Google Scholar). We had shown previously that both the antioxidative capacity (measured as the ability of cells to maintain their peroxidative potential under increased oxygen partial pressure) and the telomere shortening rate varied widely among fibroblast strains derived from different donors (18von Zglinicki T. Serra V. Lorenz M. Saretzki G. Lenzen-Grossimlighaus R. Gessner R. Risch A. Steinhagen-Thiessen E. Lab. Invest. 2000; 80: 1739-1747Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar). Interestingly, both parameters were significantly correlated, suggesting that oxidative stress might be a major cause of telomere shortening in agreement with earlier data (for review, see Ref. 17von Zglinicki T. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2002; 27: 339-344Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1754) Google Scholar). To identify genes that might be responsible for the observed differences, we selected seven fibroblast strains, representing the extremes in terms of telomere shortening rate and antioxidative capacity, for array analysis (Fig.1). Four of the selected strains (BJ, P30, P35, P36) showed low telomere shortening rates and either high (BJ, P36) or moderate (P30, P35) antioxidative capacity, whereas two others (MRC-5, WI-38) displayed a large increase in DCF fluorescence under hyperoxia and high telomere shortening rates. One strain (P13) showed a high telomere shortening rate and a moderate antioxidant capacity. In these seven cell strains, we measured the expression of 234 genes involved in stress response under both normoxia and hyperoxia using low-density arrays. Of these, 129 genes did not display any significant differences between strains or under increased oxidative stress using the significance levels as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Differences in the expression levels in most of the remaining 105 genes were clearly not correlated to either the telomere shortening rate or AOC. Only a few genes showed an expression pattern that might suggest correlation to cellular peroxide levels or telomere shortening rates. Among these were none of the kinases, cell cycle-related genes, or structural proteins included in the arrays. Those genes with potentially related patterns fall into four groups, namely drug-metabolizing enzymes, heat shock proteins, DNA modification and repair enzymes, and antioxidant enzymes (Fig.2). Among the drug-metabolizing enzymes (Fig. 2 A), nicotinamide-n-methyltransferase (NNMT) was expressed at a significantly lower level in strains with low antioxidant capacity. By catalyzing NAD methylation, NNMT might be involved in free radical defense. On the other hand, glutathioneS-transferase M1 (GST M1) tended to be higher in MRC-5 and WI-38. GST M1 transfers reduced glutathione to a wide variety of exogenous and endogenous substances to detoxify them. Three heat shock proteins, HSPB2, HSP90, and HSP47, showed lower mRNA levels in those fibroblast strains with low AOC. None of these mRNAs appeared to be regulated by hyperoxia (Fig. 2 B). It is possible that a relative deficiency in these gene products contributes to an increased pro-oxidant state in MRC-5 and WI-38 fibroblasts. Among the DNA modification and repair genes, four of them showed expression patterns in the arrays that appeared related to antioxidant capacity and telomere shortening rate (Fig. 2 C). However, such a correlation remains to be evaluated in the case of replication factor A 2 (RPA2), whereas Northern blotting and semiquantitative RT-PCR failed to confirm a significant correlation of either MTH1 or GADD153 expression with telomere shortening rate (data not shown). Topoisomerase 1 (TOP1) mRNA expression was at the limit of significance in the array data (Fig. 2 C). However, topoisomerases have been implicated in telomere stability in both yeast (26Kim R.A. Caron P.R. Wang J.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 2667-2671Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar) and human cells (27Ludwig A. Saretzki G. Holm P.S. Tiemann F. Lorenz M. Emrich T. Harley C.B. von Zglinicki T. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 3053-3061PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, the expression pattern warranted further examination by RT-PCR. Results from seven fibroblast strains showed a significant inverse correlation between TOP1 levels and telomere shortening rates (Fig. 3,A and B). The mRNA levels for the antioxidant enzymes CuZn-SOD, glutathione peroxidase, heme oxygenase 1, and catalase were generally low and were hardly different between strains and between normoxia and hyperoxia (Fig. 2 D). This result is not unexpected in the case of catalase, which is known to be posttranscriptionally regulated. In fact, Western blotting showed significantly higher catalase immunoreactivity in BJ as compared with MRC-5 or WI-38 (not shown). The array analysis indicated a higher Mn-SOD content in BJ fibroblasts as compared with all other strains (Fig. 2 D), a result that has been confirmed by Northern blotting (not shown). However, the most striking result was the considerable difference in EC-SODmRNA levels between cells with low and high peroxide contents (Fig.2 D). Moreover, hyperoxia resulted in a compensatory up-regulation of this mRNA in the two strains with the best antioxidant capacity (BJ and P36). These results were confirmed by Northern blot (Fig. 3 C). The correlation between array and Northern blot results forEC-SOD was significant (p = 0.02, hyperoxia). To establish the relevance of EC-SOD expression more firmly, additional fibroblast strains (including those shown in Fig. 1), which had previously been characterized in terms of DCF fluorescence and telomere shortening rate (18von Zglinicki T. Serra V. Lorenz M. Saretzki G. Lenzen-Grossimlighaus R. Gessner R. Risch A. Steinhagen-Thiessen E. Lab. Invest. 2000; 80: 1739-1747Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar), were included in the analysis. Up-regulation of EC-SOD by hyperoxia was observed in a number of cell strains, especially those with high antioxidant capacity (Fig. 3 C). In one strain (P30), up-regulation by hyperoxia was seen by Northern, but not in the arrays, possibly because of a higher noise level in the arrays. For 13 of 18 examined fibroblast strains grown under normoxia, EC-SOD expression correlated strongly with cellular antioxidative capacity (Fig.4 A). Essentially the same result was found for the correlation between EC-SODexpression under hyperoxia and antioxidant capacity (Fig.4 B), although only 11 strains were examined there. The two strains with high EC-SOD expression but comparatively low antioxidant capacity (Fig. 4 A) displayed conspicuous deregulation of the catalase protein content (data not shown). We have not yet identified a plausible explanation for the deviation from the common trend toward high antioxidant capacity in three strains. EC-SOD expression is not only a strong statistical predictor of antioxidant defense in most fibroblast strains; it is also significantly inversely correlated to the rate of telomere shortening both under normoxia (Fig. 4 C) and under hyperoxia (Fig.4 D). Interestingly, even strains that do not fit the general trend, in Fig. 4, A and B, did not obviously deviate from the correlations shown in Fig. 4, C andD, which might indicate that a moderately good antioxidant capacity suffices to maintain a low telomere shortening rate. Taken together, these correlative data point to EC-SOD as the strongest candidate for maintaining low levels of oxidative stress in human fibroblasts under hyperoxia and low rates of telomere shortening. To discover whether cellular SOD activity is dependent on the level of transcription of EC-SOD mRNA, we measured total SOD activity in cell extracts from the most extreme cell strains, BJ and MRC-5. SOD activity in BJ cells was significantly higher than that in MRC-5 (Fig. 5). Retroviral transduction of an EC-SOD cDNA (24Hjalmarsson K. Marklund S.L. Engstroem A. Edlund T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 6340-6344Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar) resulted in an at least a 10-fold over-expression of EC-SOD mRNA in MRC-5 fibroblasts as judged by RT-PCR (not shown). This increased the total cellular SOD activity in MRC-5 mass cultures up to a level similar to that in BJ fibroblasts (Fig. 5). Thus, we conclude that expression ofEC-SOD contributes significantly to cellular SOD activity. Over-expression of EC-SOD markedly decreased the concentration of intracellular peroxides as measured by cellular median DCF fluorescence intensity, both under normoxia and under hyperoxia (Fig. 6 A). In accordance with their lower antioxidant capacity, MRC-5 fibroblasts achieve significantly less population doublings than BJ fibroblasts, both under normoxia and, even more so, under hyperoxia (7von Zglinicki T. Pilger R. Sitte N. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2000; 28: 64-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (426) Google Scholar, 12Lorenz M. Saretzki G. Sitte N. Metzkow S. von Zglinicki T. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2001; 31: 824-831Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). The replicative life span of MRC-5 fibroblasts under normoxia increased by about 25% after transfection with EC-SOD as compared with parallel vector only-transfected controls (Fig. 6 B). This is comparable with the magnitude of effect of typical antioxidants and free radical scavengers (7von Zglinicki T. Pilger R. Sitte N. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2000; 28: 64-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (426) Google Scholar, 8von Zglinicki T. Saretzki G. Docke W. Lotze C. Exp. Cell Res. 1995; 220: 186-193Crossref PubMed Scopus (698) Google Scholar, 16Chen Q. Fischer A. Reagan J.D. Yan L.J. Ames B.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 4337-4341Crossref PubMed Scopus (563) Google Scholar). When parental MRC-5 and vector-transfected cells were transferred to hyperoxia at a PD of about 30, they became senescent after about 1 PD in accordance with earlier results (7von Zglinicki T. Pilger R. Sitte N. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2000; 28: 64-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (426) Google Scholar, 8von Zglinicki T. Saretzki G. Docke W. Lotze C. Exp. Cell Res. 1995; 220: 186-193Crossref PubMed Scopus (698) Google Scholar). EC-SOD over-expression sustained growth of MRC-5 cells under hyperoxia more than twice as long (Fig.6 B). To examine whether EC-SOD expression would influence the telomere shortening rate of MRC-5 cells, we measured telomere lengths in both vector-transfected and EC-SOD-over-expressing MRC-5 fibroblasts. Cells transduced with empty virus showed an even faster rate of telomere shortening under hyperoxia than parental ones. This was not because of unspecific DNA degradation, as shown by rehybridization of the blots with an interstitial minisatellite probe (Fig. 7 A). Mitochondrial uncoupling results in an even more exaggerated telomere shortening within a single cell cycle in mouse zygotes (28Liu J. Trimarchi J.R. Smith P.J.S. Keefe D.L. Aging Cell. 2002; 1: 40-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). Over-expression ofEC-SOD resulted in a significantly lower shortening rate under both normoxia and hyperoxia (Fig. 7). Telomere shortening inEC-SOD-over-expressing fibroblasts under hyperoxia was even slower than in control cells under normoxia. Thus, increased expression of EC-SOD both slows down telomere shortening and postpones replicative senescence in MRC-5 fibroblasts under normoxic and hyperoxic culture conditions. We used low-density arrays of stress-related genes to identify possible candidates involved in the control of telomere shortening rate and antioxidant capacity in human fibroblasts under mild oxidative stress. This resulted in the identification of only one of the DNA modification and repair enzymes; high TOP1 expression was correlated significantly to low telomere shortening rate. A number of data link the action of topoisomerases to telomeres. Loss of topoisomerase III leads to telomere shortening in yeast (26Kim R.A. Caron P.R. Wang J.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 2667-2671Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Topoisomerase II was shown to cleave telomeres preferentially (29Yoon H.J. Choi I.Y. Kang M.R. Kim S.S. Muller M.T. Spitzner J.R. Chung I.K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1395: 110-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Topoisomerases interact with members of the RecQ helicase family (30Duguet M. J. Cell Sci. 1997; 110: 1345-1350Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), which are known to bind telomeres. Telomerase activity modifies the sensitivity of human cells to topoisomerase inhibitors (27Ludwig A. Saretzki G. Holm P.S. Tiemann F. Lorenz M. Emrich T. Harley C.B. von Zglinicki T. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 3053-3061PubMed Google Scholar). TOP1 is involved in the resolution and repair of single-strand breaks, and we have shown that oxidant-induced single-strand breaks in telomeres are a major determinant of the telomere shortening rate (7von Zglinicki T. Pilger R. Sitte N. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2000; 28: 64-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (426) Google Scholar, 21Sitte N. Saretzki G. von Zglinicki T. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 1998; 24: 885-893Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). It will be interesting, therefore, to examine the possible role of TOP1 in telomere repair and length maintenance more closely. Our array studies revealed that the expression of only one superoxide dismutase, EC-SOD, correlated strongly with antioxidant defense capacity in human fibroblast strains. Steady-state levels ofEC-SOD mRNA in antioxidatively competent strains were between 5 and 20 times higher than levels of CuZn-SOD. They were also 5–20 times higher than EC-SOD levels in incompetent strains. This is in agreement with earlier data showing up to 100-fold variation in EC-SOD expression between human fibroblast strains (25Marklund S.L. Biochem. J. 1990; 266: 213-219Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). EC-SOD expression was found to be inducible by mild chronic hyperoxia in some (generally antioxidatively competent) strains but not in others. Such noninducibility has been reported previously (31Stralin P. Marklund S.L. Biochem. J. 1994; 298: 347-352Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Strains with high expression ofEC-SOD (either endogenously or from a transgene) showed high total SOD activity in cellular lysates, suggesting that EC-SOD contributes significantly to the cellular superoxide dismutase activity. It has previously been shown that between 5 and 25% of EC-SOD protein is not secreted but is retained in the cell lysates (25Marklund S.L. Biochem. J. 1990; 266: 213-219Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). This retained fraction is not bound to extracellular heparin sulfate proteoglycan, but little more is known about its distribution. The two most obvious locations for cell-bound EC-SOD protein are at the plasma membrane and within the endolysosomal system. In both locations, the enzyme might contribute significantly to cellular antioxidant defenses; NADH oxidation by the plasma membrane oxidoreductase system has recently been suggested as a likely source of superoxide (32de Grey A.D.N.J. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2000; 373: 295-301Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). SOD activity at the plasma membrane might thus block the generation of reactive oxygen species at source. Alternatively, lysosomes are a major site for cellular iron storage and are thus highly susceptible to damage by hydrogen peroxide (33Antunes F. Cadenas E. Brunk U.T. Biochem. J. 2001; 356: 549-555Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). The presence of EC-SOD in the endolysosomal system could inhibit superoxide-dependent recycling of catalytically active iron. In line with these hypotheses, over-expression of EC-SOD was found to decrease the amount of cellular peroxides and to slow down telomere shortening, under both standard conditions and increased oxidative load, i.e. hyperoxia. This result confirms that telomere shortening under conditions of low to mild oxidative stress is to a large extent caused by telomeric DNA damage (7von Zglinicki T. Pilger R. Sitte N. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2000; 28: 64-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (426) Google Scholar, 17von Zglinicki T. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2002; 27: 339-344Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1754) Google Scholar). The senescence-like growth arrest of human fibroblasts exposed to mild oxidative stress is undistinguishable from “Hayflick senescence” under standard culture conditions, in terms of telomere length (8von Zglinicki T. Saretzki G. Docke W. Lotze C. Exp. Cell Res. 1995; 220: 186-193Crossref PubMed Scopus (698) Google Scholar, 23Serra V. von Zglinicki T. FEBS Lett. 2002; 516: 71-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar) and phenotype (34Saretzki G. Feng J. von Zglinicki T. Villeponteau B. J. Gerontol. 1998; 53A: B438-B442Crossref Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 35Toussaint O. Medrano E.E. von Zglinicki T. Exp. Gerontol. 2000; 35: 927-945Crossref PubMed Scopus (511) Google Scholar). The fact that over-expression of an antioxidant, EC-SOD, slows down telomere shortening and extends the replicative life span under both normoxia and hyperoxia in parallel strongly suggests that senescence under such mild oxidative stress conditions is telomere-driven. In mice, EC-SOD over-expression or knockout phenotypes are comparatively mild. However, EC-SOD knockout mice are more sensitive to hyperoxia (36Carlsson L.M. Jonsson J. Edlund T. Marklund S.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 6264-6268Crossref PubMed Scopus (403) Google Scholar), and this increased sensitivity does not seem to be due to modification of the inflammatory response in the lungs (37Sentman M.L. Brannstrom T. Marklund S.L. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2002; 32: 975-981Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). More interestingly, EC-SOD plays an important role in brain function, as both young EC-SOD-over-expressing and knockout mice are impaired in spatial learning and memory, which has been attributed to a deregulation of nitric oxide catabolism (38Levin E.D. Brady T.C. Hochrein E.C. Oury T.D. Jonsson L.M. Marklund S.L. Crapo J.D. Behav. Genet. 1998; 28: 381-390Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 39Thiels E. Urban N.N. Gonzales-Burgos G.R. Kanterewicz B.I. Barrionuevo G. Chu C.T. Oury T.D. Klann E. J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 7631-7639Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Conversely, knockout mice are more sensitive to focal cerebral ischemia (40Sheng H. Brady T.C. Pearlstein R.D. Crapo J.D. Warner D.S. Neurosci. Lett. 1999; : 267Google Scholar), and EC-SOD over-expression increases the resistance of mice to global ischemia (41Sheng H. Kudo M. Mackensen G.B. Pearlstein R.D. Crapo J.D. Warner D.S. Exp. Neurol. 2000; 163: 392-398Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Furthermore, improved learning and memory performance in aged mice over-expressing EC-SOD has been demonstrated recently (42Levin E.D. Christopher N.C. Lateef S. Elamir B.M. Patel M. Liang L.P. Crapo J.D. Behav. Genet. 2002; 32: 119-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Together, these data suggest a protective role of EC-SOD in the brain, possibly related to its antioxidant function rather than to its role in nitric oxide turnover. In humans, we found short telomeres in patients with stroke-related (vascular) dementia. We assumed that short telomeres might indicate low antioxidant capacity and thus higher risk of stroke-induced brain damage in vivo (18von Zglinicki T. Serra V. Lorenz M. Saretzki G.

Quiescent satellite cells are activated to reenter the cell cycle and to differentiate for repair, recapitulating features of myogenesis during embryonic development. To understand better the molecular mechanism involved in this process in vivo, we employed high density cDNA microarrays for gene expression profiling in mouse tibialis anterior muscles after a cardiotoxin injection. Among 16,267 gene elements surveyed, 3,532 elements showed at least a 2.5-fold change at one or more time points during a 14-day time course. Hierarchical cluster analysis and semiquantitative reverse transcription-PCR showed induction of genes important for cell cycle control and DNA replication during the early phase of muscle regeneration. Subsequently, genes for myogenic regulatory factors, a group of imprinted genes and genes with functions to inhibit cell cycle progression and promote myogenic differentiation, were induced when myogenic stem cells started to differentiate. Induction of a majority of these genes, including E2f1 and E2f2, was abolished in muscles lacking satellite cell activity after gamma radiation. Regeneration was severely compromised in E2f1 null mice but not affected in E2f2 null mice. This study identifies novel genes potentially important for muscle regeneration and reveals highly coordinated myogenic cell proliferation and differentiation programs in adult skeletal muscle regeneration in vivo.

Muscle regeneration maintains locomotor function during aging and delays the appearance of clinical symptoms in neuromuscular diseases, such as Duchenne muscular dystrophy (1Pearce G.W. Walton J.N. J. Neurol. Bacteriol. 1962; 83: 535-550Google Scholar, 2Pearson C.M. Brain. 1962; 85: 109-118Google Scholar). This capacity for tissue repair is conferred by satellite cells located between the basal lamina and the sarcolemma of mature myofibers (3Bischoff R. Franszini-Armstrong A.G.E.a.C. Myogenesis. McGraw-Hill, Inc., New York1994: 97-118Google Scholar, 4Grounds M.D. Yablonka-Reuveni Z. Mol. Cell. Biol. Hum. Dis. Ser. 1993; 3: 210-256Google Scholar). Upon injury, satellite cells reenter the cell cycle, proliferate, and then exit the cell cycle either to renew the quiescent satellite cell pool or to differentiate into mature myofibers (5Anderson J.E. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1998; 76: 13-26Google Scholar). Understanding the molecular mechanism by which satellite cell activity is regulated could promote development of novel countermeasures to enhance muscle performance that is compromised by diseases or aging. Both the cell proliferation and differentiation programs are essential for myogenesis. Mammalian cells escape from quiescence (G0) and enter the cell cycle by activating the Cdk1/Rb/E2f signaling pathway (6Nevins J.R. Cell Growth Differ. 1998; 9: 585-593Google Scholar, 7Dyson N. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 2245-2262Google Scholar). In general, mitogen stimulation induces expression and assembly of the G1 cyclin-dependent kinases (Cdks) (8Won K.A. Xiong Y. Beach D. Gilman M.Z. Proc.

Activation of Cdks causes phosphorylation of the retinoblastoma protein (Rb) (10Kato J. Matsushime H. Hiebert S.W. Ewen M.E. Sherr C.J. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 331-342Google Scholar, 11Ewen M.E.

Ohtani K. Nevins J.R. Mol. Cell.

On the other hand, myogenic differentiation is controlled by interactions of a network of myogenic transcription factors (15Olson E.N. Brennan T.J. Chakraborty T. Cheng T.C. Cserjesi P. Edmondson D.

MADS box transcription factors, such as myocyte enhancer factor 2, cooperate with MRFs in muscle-specific gene expression (29Cserjesi P. Olson E.N. Mol. Cell.

However, the functional roles of these regulatory proteins in adult skeletal muscle have not been well defined. Several animal models of muscle regeneration have been described, but there has not been a comprehensive analysis of gene regulation in any model. In this study, we have taken advantage of high density cDNA microarray to assess global gene expression followed by detailed semiquantitative reverse transcription (RT)-PCR analysis in a mouse skeletal muscle regeneration model. Expression of some genes directly related to cell cycle control and myogenic differentiation was compared in the presence and absence of satellite cell activities. We have identified genes previously unknown to be regulated during skeletal muscle regeneration. We have also uncovered differential functional roles of E2f1 and E2f2in vivo using mice with targeted mutations. We modified a previously described muscle injury model (22Garry D.J. Meeson A. Elterman J. Zhao Y. Yang P. Bassel-Duby R. Williams R.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 5416-5421Google Scholar) by injecting cardiotoxin into the tibialis anterior (TA) muscles of 6-week-old male C57BL/6 mice (Harlen). The muscles were harvested at various times (1, 2, 3, 5, 10, or 14 days) after injection. Uninjected TA muscles were used as control. 6 h before muscle harvesting, 500 mg/kg bromodeoxyuridine (BrdUrd) was injected intraperitoneally to label DNA-replicating nuclei. The left TA muscle was harvested, fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde, frozen or embedded in paraffin, sectioned, and stained with hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) or antibodies against various antigens. Total RNA was isolated from the right TA muscle using TriPure® kit (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). To assess the contribution of satellite cell activities in global gene expression, we injected cardiotoxin into TA muscles that had been subjected to 2,200 rads of gamma radiation (31Phelan J.N. Gonyea W.J. Anat. Rec. 1997; 247: 179-188Google Scholar) 24 h earlier. To determine whether induced expression of E2f1 or E2f2 is essential for injury-induced muscle regeneration, cardiotoxin was injected in TA muscles in mice with targeted mutation of E2f1 (Jackson Laboratory) or E2f2 allele (kind gifts from J. R. Nevins). 8-μm frozen or paraffin-embedded muscle sections were permeabilized in 0.3% Triton X-100 and PBS, blocked with normal goat serum, and incubated overnight at 4 °C with rabbit anti-MyoD antibody (1:50, Santa Cruz), rat anti-Mac-1 (1:400, Serotec), or rat anti-ag 7/4 (1:400, Serotec) in 5% normal goat serum and PBS. The sections were incubated with fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated secondary antibody (1:50, Jackson Laboratory) in 5% normal goat serum and PBS for 30 min at room temperature. To detect BrdUrd incorporation, the sections were then fixed for 10 min in 2% formaldehyde on ice and treated with 2 n HCl for 60 min at 37 °C to denature the DNA followed by neutralization in 0.1m borate buffer (pH 8.5). The sections were then permeabilized in 0.3% Triton X-100 and PBS and blocked with 1.5% normal horse serum and PBS and incubated overnight at 4 °C with mouse monoclonal anti-BrdUrd antibodies (1:25, Roche) in 0.1% bovine serum albumin and PBS followed by an incubation with biotinylated horse anti-mouse IgG (1:200, Dako) in 1% normal horse serum and PBS. The biotinylated IgG was detected by application of fluorescein isothiocyanate and streptavidin (1:50, Vector) and examined under epifluorescent or confocal microscope. TA muscles were fixed in a solution containing 2.5% glutaldehyde, 137 mm NaCl, 2 mm CaCl2, 4 mm KCl, 100 mm MOPS (pH 7.4) for 24 h, rinsed in the fixation solution lacking glutaldehyde for 24 h, treated with 1% osmium tetroxide in 100 mmC2H6AsO2Na (cacodylate) for 2 h, stained with 0.5% uranyl acetate for 2 h, dehydrated in ethanol, and embedded in Spurr's resin. Thin sections were cut, collected on 400-mesh copper grids, and stained with uranyl acetate and lead citrate. Microscopy was carried out using a JEOL 1200 EX electron microscope at 80 kV. A National Institute on Aging mouse cDNA chip (16,000 bytes) was used for the microarray analysis. PCR products from cDNA clones prepared by the Caltech Genome Research Laboratory (date.tree.caltech.edu/local_clones.html) were spotted onto CMT-GAPS-coated slides (Corning). Probes for microarray hybridization were generated using 5 μg of pooled muscle total RNA from five mice of the same time point. The RNA was first annealed with 100 pmol of T7-(dT)24 primer (5′-GGCCAGTGAATTGTAATACGACTCACTATAGGGAGGCGG-(dT)24-3′) in 12 μl at 70 °C for 10 min. The first strand cDNA was synthesized at 42 °C for 1 h in the first strand cDNA buffer containing 50 mm Tris (pH 8.3), 75 mmKCl, 3 mm MgCl2, 10 mmdithiothreitol, 0.5 mm dNTP, and 10 units/μl Superscript II reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen). The second strand cDNA was synthesized at 16 °C for 2 h in the second strand cDNA buffer containing 20 mm Tris (pH 6.9), 90 mmKCl, 4.6 mm MgCl2, 0.15 mm NAD, 10 mm (NH4)2SO4, 0.2 mm dNTP, 0.07 unit/μl Escherichia coli DNA ligase (New England Biolabs), 0.27 unit/μl E. coli DNA polymerase I (New England Biolabs), and 0.013 unit/μl RNase H (Invitrogen). T4 DNA Polymerase (20 units, Invitrogen) was added and incubated at 16 °C for 5 min. To stop the reaction, 7.5 μl of 1m NaOH and 2 mm EDTA (pH 8.0) was added, and the sample was heated at 65 °C for 10 min. The cDNA was extracted with phenol:chloroform:isoamyl alcohol (25:24:1) and precipitated with ammonium acetate and ethanol. In vitrotranscription was carried out using a T7 Megascript kit (Ambion). To generate a Cy3- or Cy5-labeled probe, 10 μg of amplified antisense RNA and 6 μg of random hexamer primers were annealed in 14 μl at 70 °C for 10 min followed by incubation at 42 °C for 2 h in 50 mm Tris (pH 8.3), 75 mm KCl, 3 mm MgCl2, 10 mm dithiothreitol, 10 μm dATP/dCTP/dGTP, 4 μm dTTP, 13.3 units/μl Superscript II reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen), and 3 μl Cy5 or Cy3 dUTP. The probes were purified by filtering through Microcon-30 filters (Millipore) before hybridization at 42 °C in a water bath overnight according to the instructions for CMT-GAPS-coated slides. The slides were scanned with a GenePix 4000A scanner (Axon Instruments) and analyzed using the GENEPIX PRO 3.0 (Axon Instruments). The raw data were normalized using a total intensity normalization method under the assumption that the total quantities of messages from both channels should be the same. Briefly, the average fold difference of all elements of the array was calculated and used as a normalization factor. This normalization factor was then used to adjust the fold for each gene in the array. We then eliminated spots that had median intensities less than the mean plus three times S.D. of the background Cy3 or Cy5 intensity. Once the normalized data were obtained and lower than background data points were removed, we processed the data further by removing any gene element that had not shown a change >2.5-fold at any time point. This cutoff level was set after we repeatedly tested the reproducibility of the microarray hybridization and found an average of only 10 gene elements with changes greater than 2.5-fold (maximal change of 2.8-fold) among 16,267 elements assayed (0.061%) when unstimulated control samples were compared (not shown). For clustering analysis, we converted the Cy5:Cy3 ratio to a log ratio (base 2), analyzed with GeneCluster 2.0 available at www-genome.wi.mit.edu, and generated a 4 × 4 self-organization map (32Tamayo P. Slonim D. Mesirov J. Zhu Q. Kitareewan S. Dmitrovsky E. Lander E.S. Golub T.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 2907-2912Google Scholar). To confirm the microarray findings and to survey additional genes pertinent to satellite cell proliferation and differentiation, semiquantitative RT-PCR analysis was performed as described (22Garry D.J. Meeson A. Elterman J. Zhao Y. Yang P. Bassel-Duby R. Williams R.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 5416-5421Google Scholar). Each data point was normalized by the abundance of glyceraldhyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase mRNA and expressed as a log2 ratio to the uninjected control in the randomly preassigned time course group. PCR primer pairs were designed using a Primer3 search engine at www-genome.wi.mit.edu.

Piras G. Stewart C.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 8674-8680Google Scholar). We injected cardiotoxin into the anatomically more confined TA muscles and showed regeneration in more than 90% of the myofibers (Fig.1 A). In three independent experiments, similar morphological changes were observed repeatedly. Histological analysis demonstrated global myofiber fragmentation and edema at days 1 and 2 after injury. The number of mononucleated cells/cross-sectional area increased significantly after cardiotoxin injection with a peak around day 3. This increase in cell number is attributable to both inflammatory cell infiltration and proliferation of satellite cells. Myotubes started to appear at day 3 and became more evident at days 5 and 10 postinjection. Morphology at day 14 postinjection was not significantly different from that of the uninjected control muscles except for the presence of central nuclei, a known hallmark of recent muscle regeneration, in nearly all myofibers. The percent BrdUrd-positive nuclei increased significantly at days 2 and 3 after injury (Fig. 1, A and B), indicating active cell proliferation. These results suggest that cardiotoxin injection in TA muscle induces extensive and complete regeneration, and the regeneration process shifts morphologically from a phase of proliferation to differentiation at around day 3 after injury. To assess the functional role of satellite cell activities in skeletal muscle regeneration in vivo, transmission electron microscopy was performed. As shown in Fig. 2 A, satellite cell activation was apparent as early as 6 h after the cardiotoxin injection. The activated satellite cells were often separated from the adjacent myofiber, leaving electron-lucent gaps and exhibit more abundant cytoplasm and less condensed heterochromatin compared with quiescent satellite cells. At days 2 and 3 after injury, as many as seven or eight pairs of postmitotic satellite cells were often detected in a large cleft in degenerating myofiber beneath a single basal lamina. Myotubes with central nuclei and thick and thin filaments of nascent sarcomeres were apparent at day 5 postinjection. Adjacent to the myotubes were many small, mononucleated cells with condensed heterochromatin and little cytoplasm and organelles. These cells were universally in contact with both the basal lamina and the cell membrane of the growing myofiber and are likely to represent myogenic precursor cells that have reverted to a quiescent state. The timing of satellite cell activation, proliferation, and resumption of quiescence as evidenced by the morphological data is in agreement with the molecular events detected by cDNA microarray and RT-PCR observations in this study. Inflammatory cell infiltration, as a part of the physiological responses to muscle injury, has complicated the analysis of global gene expression. A key question is how to distinguish and ascertain the contribution of myoblast proliferation from inflammatory cell infiltration. Here we performed indirect immunofluorescence for detection of BrdUrd incorporation to mark proliferative cells on control and injured (day 3) muscle sections. We also stained the same sections for MyoD, Mac-1, or ag 7/4 as markers for proliferating myoblasts (34Koishi K. Zhang M. McLennan I.S. Harris A.J. Dev. Dyn. 1995; 202: 244-254Google Scholar, 35Cooper R.N. Tajbakhsh S. Mouly V. Cossu G. Buckingham M. Butler-Browne G.S. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 2895-2901Google Scholar), peripheral macrophages (36Springer T. Galfre G. Secher D.S. Milstein C. Eur. J. Immunol. 1979; 9: 301-306Google Scholar), and infiltrating neutrophils (37Hirsch S. Gordon S. Immunogenetics. 1983; 18: 229-239Google Scholar), respectively. We predicted that a great portion of MyoD-positive cells would be positive for BrdUrd staining, and none of the Mac-1 or ag 7/4-positive cells would be positive for BrdUrd because cycling myoblasts expresses MyoD prior to terminal differentiation, whereas peripheral functional macrophages and neutrophils are terminally differentiated. Normal muscle sections showed negative results for any above mentioned staining (not shown). In any given field of a day 3 muscle section, we estimated that at least 30% of all cells were positive for MyoD, BrdUrd, or both (Fig. 2 B). Consistent with our expectation, 45% of the MyoD-positive cells (759 cells counted) were detected positive for BrdUrd, whereas none of the cells positive for Mac-1 (508 cells counted) or ag 7/4 (114 cells counted) incorporated BrdUrd. These results provided unambiguous evidence that proliferating satellite cells are the main source of cells directly involved in myogenesis in skeletal muscle regeneration, and inflammatory cells do not proliferate in injured skeletal muscle. Those cells expressing MyoD, but with no BrdUrd incorporation, may be the cycling myoblasts in phases other than S phase of DNA replication. Our BrdUrd labeling lasted 6 h, which is only a fraction of a normal cell cycle time (∼20 h) for normal mammalian cells. It is also possible that some of these MyoD-positive cells might have already exited the cell cycle and initiated the differentiation process. Consistent with this notion is the observation that many of these cells had strong staining for MyoD, which promotes myogenic differentiation (38Choi J. Costa M.L. Mermelstein C.S. Chagas C. Holtzer S. Holtzer H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 7988-7992Google Scholar). To evaluate further the role of satellite cell activities in our model, gamma radiation was used to compromise the proliferative capacity of muscle stem cells, which have often been used to determine satellite cell function in skeletal muscle in vivo (31Phelan J.N. Gonyea W.J. Anat. Rec. 1997; 247: 179-188Google Scholar, 39Rosenblatt J.D. Parry D.J. J. Appl. Physiol. 1992; 73: 2538-2543Google Scholar). We subjected mouse hind limb muscles to 2,200 rads of gamma radiation 24 h before the cardiotoxin injection. Irradiated TA muscles were not morphologically different from normal TA muscles (not shown). However, myogenic cell proliferation and differentiation after cardiotoxin injection were blocked as indicated by a significantly lower increase in cell number, very few BrdUrd-positive nuclei at day 3, and the absence of newly formed myotubes at day 10 after injury (Fig. 2 C). To confirm the findings at the molecular level, we performed semiquantitative RT-PCR to quantify transcripts for Cdc6, myogenin, and p57Kip2; their expression has been shown previously to be essential for cell proliferation or myogenesis (18Hasty P. Bradley A. Morris J.H. Edmondson D.G. Venuti J.M. Olson E.N. Klein W.H. Nature. 1993; 364: 501-506Google Scholar, 40Yan Z. DeGregori J. Shohet R. Leone G. Stillman B. Nevins J.R. Williams R.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 3603-3608Google Scholar, 41Zhang P. Wong C. Liu D. Finegold M. Harper J.W. Elledge S.J. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 213-224Google Scholar). Irradiated TA muscles had attenuated or delayed induction of these transcripts (Fig. 2 D), suggesting that satellite cells play a pivotal role in skeletal muscle regeneration. To investigate global gene expression during injury-induced skeletal muscle regeneration, cDNA microarray hybridizations were performed using a National Institute on Aging mouse 16,000-byte cDNA chip. Of 16,267 elements screened, 3,532 (21.7%) were altered more than 2.5-fold at one or more time points. A significant number of genes were altered during the early phase of regeneration before day 5 after cardiotoxin injection as shown by the scatter plots (Fig. 3 A). The trend became less evident as regeneration approached completion by days 10 and 14 after injury. Quantification confirmed a phasic change in the number of differentially expressed genes (>2.5-fold change) with a peak around day 2 (2,310 elements, 14.2% of total) and day 3 (2,324 elements, 14.3% of total) after injury (Fig. 3 B). By day 14 after cardiotoxin injection, only 199 gene elements (1.2% of total) showed differential expression. The self-organizing map (32Tamayo P. Slonim D. Mesirov J. Zhu Q. Kitareewan S. Dmitrovsky E. Lander E.S. Golub T.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 2907-2912Google Scholar) was used to assemble and analyze the data. The clustering procedure groups together cDNA elements on the basis of their common expression patterns over the time points. 16 cluster groups were used (Fig. 3 C). Fig.4 shows part of the results of a hierarchical clustering as described previously (42Eisen M.B. Spellman P.T. Brown P.O. Botstein D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 14863-14868Google Scholar), and complete results are presented as supplemental data (self-organization map in supplemental data 1 and functional groups in supplemental data 2) in the Journal of Biological Chemistry on-line. In most cases, redundant cDNA probe sets were in the same cluster or in clusters with similar profiles. For example, eight redundant H2A histone family member Z gene elements were clustered in c5, and seven mouse heat shock protein 86 were clustered in c4 and c8 with a similar expression pattern. These results confirmed the fidelity of the microarray analysis used in this study. Furthermore, many functionally related genes were clustered together. For example, 48 gene elements related to energy and metabolism were clustered in c14 (26.8%, total 179 elements). There is a nearly 4-fold enrichment of these gene elements in this cluster because there are 258 gene elements related to energy and metabolism in the population (7.3%, total 3,532 elements). These findings indicate that the assay system is suitable for detecting genetic regulatory events during muscle regeneration, and we could use the hierarchical cluster analysis to identify novel genes with expression patterns similar to those well known functional genes. To identify novel genes related to myogenic differentiation, we focused our attention on genes with a peak expression pattern concurrent with muscle differentiation. For example, we noticed that three paternally imprinted genes, H19, p57Kip2, andRex3/Bex1, and four maternally imprinted genes,Igf2, Peg1/Mest,Peg3/Pw1, and Zac1, are clustered in c3 and/or c1. Because genes in these two clusters have peak induction of mRNA at day 3 or day 5, concurrent with morphological signs of myogenic differentiation, coordinated induction of these genes may play important functional roles in muscle differentiation. We also noticed similar induction of bone morphogenetic protein-6, growth arrest-specific 7 (Gas-7) and Gas"

Breast cancer is the most frequently diagnosed cancer in women and accounts for 30% of all cancers diagnosed in the United States (1Greenlee R.T. Murray T. Bolden S. Wingo P.A. Cancer J. Clin. 2000; 50: 7-33Google Scholar). The implementation of screening programs for the early detection of breast cancer and the advent of anticancer treatments such as chemotherapy, radiotherapy, and anti-estrogen therapies to augment surgical resection have improved the survival of breast cancer patients. However, some breast tumors become refractory to such treatments as the cancer cells develop resistance to chemotherapy drugs or lose their hormone sensitivity, leading to recurrent or metastatic disease that is often incurable. Cancer membrane-associated proteins form the basis of a number of new drug and antibody cancer therapeutics such as Gleevec (abl-kinase) (2.(2001) Expert Rev. Anticancer Ther. 1,3.Google Scholar), herceptin (her2neu) (3Brenner T.L. Adams V.R. J. Am. Pharm. Assoc. 1999; 39: 236-238Google Scholar), Panorex (Ep-CAM) (4Abicht A. Lochmuller H. Curr. Opin. Mol. Ther. 2000; 2: 539-600Google Scholar), and IRESSA (EGF 1The abbreviations used are: EGF, epidermal growth factor; AFP, autofluorescent protein; BCMP, breast cancer membrane protein; EST, expressed sequence tag; IM, integral membrane-associated; MALDI, matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization; MS/MS, tandem mass spectrometry; ORF, open reading frame; PA, plasma membrane-associated; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; RT, reverse transcription; T, trans-plasma membrane; TOF, time of flight receptor) (5Ranson M. Mansoor W. Jayson G. Expert Rev. Anticancer Ther. 2002; 2: 161-168Google Scholar). Furthermore many other membrane-associated proteins such as small GTPases, kinases, and catenins are implicated in carcinogenesis. Thus a comprehensive definition of cancer cell membrane-associated proteins can reveal further proteins involved in cancer biology which may themselves represent new therapeutic targets. Tumor-specific proteins have been identified for a number of cancer types using techniques such as differential screening of cDNAs (6Hubert R.S. Vivanco I. Chen E. Rastegar S. Leong K. Mitchell S.C. Madraswala R. Zhou Y. Kuo J. Raitano A.B. Jakobovits A. Saffran D.C. Afar D.E. Proc. Natl. Acad, Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 14523-14528Google Scholar) and the purification of cell surface proteins that are recognized by tumor-specific antibodies (7Catimel B. Ritter G. Welt S. Old L.J. Cohen L. Nerrie M.A. White S.J. Heath J.K. Demediuk B. Domagala T. Lee F.T. Scott A.M. Tu G.F. Ji H. Moritz R.L. Simpson R.J. Burgess A.W. Nice E.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 25664-25670Google Scholar). More recently, DNA “chips” containing up to 12,000 expressed sequence elements have been used to characterize tumor cell gene expression (8Dhanasekaran S.M. Barrette T.R. Ghosh D. Shah R. Varambally S. Kurachi K. Pienta K.J. Rubin M.A. Chinnaiyan A.M. Nature. 2001; 412: 822-826Google Scholar). However, there are several reasons why the numerous and extensive previous transcriptomic analyses of breast cancer may not have revealed all tumor-associated proteins. These include (i) a lack of correlation between transcript and disease-associated protein levels; (ii) translocation of a protein in the disease state rather than simply differential levels of the transcript; (iii) novel/uncharacterized genes that are not highly represented within the “closed system” of a cDNA array where there are restrictions on the number of expressed sequence elements per chip and the knowledge and availability of DNA clones. There have been previous attempts to use plasma membrane-enriched preparations from cancer cell lines to discover new proteins associated with tumor biology (9Simpson R.J. Connolly L.M. Eddes J.S. Pereira J.J. Moritz R.L. Reid G.E. Electrophoresis. 2000; 21: 1707-1732Google Scholar). In this study we have improved the proportion and total number of membrane proteins obtained from around 30% in previous studies (9Simpson R.J. Connolly L.M. Eddes J.S. Pereira J.J. Moritz R.L. Reid G.E. Electrophoresis. 2000; 21: 1707-1732Google Scholar) to more than 50%, with 31% being trans-plasma membrane or plasma membrane-associated. Furthermore, 27% of the proteins identified are of unknown function. Indeed, the three uncharacterized proteins described in this paper (named breast cancer membrane protein BCMP11, BCMP84, and BCMP101) all show cancer cell membrane association as well as protein expression levels and localizations that are unique to cancer cells over normal breast epithelial cells. The human breast carcinoma cell lines MDA-MB-468 (ATCC:HB-132), T-47D (ATCC:HB-133), BT-474 (ATCC:HTB-20), and MCF-7 (ATCC:HTB-22) were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/F12 medium containing 10% fetal calf serum, 2 mmglutamine, and 1% penicillin/streptomycin. The cells were maintained at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere of 95% air and 5% CO2. Adherent cells (2 × 108) were washed three times with PBS and scraped using a plastic cell lifter. Cells were centrifuged at 1,000 × g for 5 min at 4 °C, and the cell pellet was resuspended in homogenization buffer (250 mm sucrose, 10 mm HEPES, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm vanadate, and 0.02% azide protease inhibitors). Cells were fractionated using a ball bearing homogenizer (8.002-mm ball, HGM Laboratory Equipment) until approximately 95% of the cells were broken. Membranes were fractionated using the method described by Pasquali et al. (10Pasquali C. Fialka I. Huber L.A. J. Chromatogr. 1999; 722: 89-102Google Scholar). The fractionated cells were centrifuged at 3,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C, and the postnuclear supernatant was layered onto a 60% sucrose cushion and centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 45 min. The membranes were collected using a Pasteur pipette, layered on a preformed 15–60% sucrose gradient, and spun at 100,000 × g for 17 h. Proteins from the fractionated sucrose gradient were run on a 4–20% one-dimensional gel (Novex) and subjected to Western blotting. Those fractions containing alkaline phosphatase and transferrin immunoreactivity but not oxidoreductase II or calnexin immunoreactivity were pooled and represented the plasma membrane fraction. Proteins excised from the one-dimensional gels were analyzed by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry (Voyager STR, Applied Biosystems, Framingham, MA) using a 337-nm wavelength laser for desorption and the reflectron mode of analysis. Selected masses for BCMP11 ((M+H) = 1,226.604, 1,258.674, and 922.455), BCMP84 ((M+H) = 1,648.697), and BCMP101 ((M+H) = 2,099, 1,649 and 1,170) were characterized further by MS/MS using a quadrupole TOF mass spectrometer equipped with a nanospray ion source (Micromass U. K. Ltd., Manchester). Prior to MALDI analysis the samples were desalted and concentrated using C18 Zip Tips™ (Millipore, Bedford, MA). Samples for MS/MS were purified using a nano LC system (LC Packings, Amsterdam, The Netherlands) incorporating C18 SPE material. Using the SEQUEST search program (11Eng J.K. McCormack A.L. Yates III, J.R. J. Am. Soc. Mass Spectrom. 1994; 5: 976-989Google Scholar), uninterpreted tandem mass spectra of tryptic digest peptides were searched against a FASTA data base of public domain proteins constructed of protein entries in the nonredundant data base held by the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) and Swiss-Prot which are accessible at www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/and www.expasy.com. Peptide matches identified by SEQUEST were filtered according to their cross-correlation score, normalized difference correlation score, compatibility with trypsin digestion, and number of observations of proteins and peptides. Peptides were only used for protein identification where the cross-correlation score was ≥ 1.2 and the normalized difference correlation score ≥ 0.2. For conservative identification of abundant proteins two peptides with these scores were required, but for some of the novel lower abundance proteins and low molecular weight proteins identified we accepted a single tandem peptide with these scores as long as there were mass matches on the same protein sequence from the same gel slice. Total RNA was prepared from cultured MDA-MB-468 and T-47D cells using Trizol reagent (Invitrogen) and resuspended in RNase-free water at a concentration of 1 μg/μl. 5 μg of total RNA was used for oligo(dT) primed first strand cDNA synthesis using Superscript II reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen). The predicted full-length BCMP11, BCMP84, and BCMP101 open reading frames (ORFs) were amplified by PCR from T-47D and MDA-MB-468 cDNAs using the following primers: BCMP11F, 5′-ggccaagtcagcttcttctg-3′; BCMP11R, 5′-gtatttgtcaatgtgccagagg-3′; BCMP84F, 5′-ataggacaacagaactctcacc-3′; BCMP84R, 5′-gcttcaacggaactttgcagag-3′; BCMP101F, 5′-tgtgcaaatgaccctggagttg-3′; BCMP101R, 5′-ggctgctactgcaaacagttcc-3′. Reactions contained 10 ng of cDNA and reagents for PCR (Qiagen) and used 40 cycles at 94 °C for 30 s and 60 °C for 30 s. PCR products were column purified (Qiagen), cloned into T:A vector (Invitrogen) and the sequence verified. For fluorescent tagging, the BCMP11, BCMP84, and BCMP101 full-length ORFs were PCR cloned into the pQBI25/50-fN1 vector (Qbiogene) resulting in an in-frame addition of the SuperGlo™ autofluorescent protein (AFP) to the C terminus of each expressed protein. Transient transfection of SuperGlo™ AFP-tagged BCMP11, BCMP84, and BCMP101 cDNAs into MDA-MB-468, T-47D, and normal human mammary epithelial (Clonetics, BioWhittaker, Inc. International) cell lines was achieved using Superfect™ transfection reagent (Qiagen). Immunohistochemical analysis was carried out on formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissue microarrays containing 1-mm sections of breast carcinoma tissue from 50 donors as well as 200 sections of various normal tissues (Clinomics Laboratories Inc., Pittsfield, MA). A variety of other ethically approved carcinoma tissues sections were provided by the University of Oxford, U. K. Formalin-fixed sections were deparaffinized by two 5-min washes in xylene, then rehydrated through successive graded ethanol solutions and washed for 5 min in PBS. Antigen retrieval was achieved in 0.01m citrate buffer (pH 6) and microwaving for 10 min at full power (950 W). In addition, detection with the BCMP84 antibody required that the tissue be treated with 1 mg/ml pepsin for 1.5 min at room temperature. Thawed frozen sections were fixed in acetone for 10 min at room temperature then washed twice in PBS. Endogenous hydrogen peroxidase activity was quenched by treating the slides in 3% hydrogen peroxidase and PBS for 10 min. The tissue was blocked in 10% donkey serum and PBS for 1 h before the addition of 2 μg/ml primary polyclonal antibody (in 2.5% donkey serum). The BCMP11, BCMP84, and BCMP101 polyclonal antibodies were raised in rabbits immunized with two specific peptides (ABCAM Ltd., Cambridge, U. K.). The BCMP11 peptides used were CAQNEEIQEMAQNKFIMLNLMHET and CTYEPRDLPLLIENMKKALRLIQSEL, the BCMP84 peptides used were CEGGKETLTPSELRDLV and CEAAKSVKLERPVRGH, and the BCMP101 peptides used were SYKEVPTADPTGVDR and LTDASQGRRGRVVND. Western blot analysis of T-47D, MDA-MB-468, and other negative cell line lysates was used to confirm that each antibody cross-reacted with a single band of the predicted size in the correct samples. After three washes in PBS the tissue sections were incubated with biotin-conjugated secondary antibodies (Biotin-SP-conjugated AffiniPure donkey anti-rabbit, Jackson ImmunoResearch) diluted at 1:200 (2.5 μg/ml in 2.5% donkey serum and PBS) for 1 h. Slides were washed three times in PBS and the tissue incubated with streptavidin-horseradish peroxidase (Jackson ImmunoResearch) diluted 1:100 (5 μg/ml in 2.5% donkey serum and PBS). Immunostaining was detected using DAB substrate solution (Dako Ltd.) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Immunocytochemical analysis was carried out on MDA-MB-468 cells fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde and PBS and permeabilized on 0.3% Triton X-100. After a 1-h incubation in blocking buffer (10% donkey serum and PBS) BCMP84 antibodies (1:50 dilution in blocking buffer) were incubated on the cells for a further 1 h. Cells were washed three times in PBS and incubated for 1 h in biotinylated anti-rabbit secondary antibody (Jackson Laboratories) followed by the addition of streptavidin-Alexa 488 (Molecular Probes). Direct in situ RT-PCR detection of BCMP101 mRNA expression was examined in formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded breast cancer tissues (provided by Human Research Tissue Bank, Department of Cellular Pathology, Peterborough District Hospital, Peterborough PE3 6DA, U. K.). Briefly, dewaxed and rehydrated tissue was permeabilized in 0.01% Triton X-100 for 3 min followed by treatment with proteinase K for 30 min at 37 °C. Directin situ RT-PCR was carried out in a GeneAmp in Situ PCR System 1000 (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) using a GeneAmp Thermostable rTth RT-PCR kit (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). The primers used to amplify BCMP101 were: sense, 5′-ttcacctctccgcgggtagcct-3′, antisense, 5′-ggaagttacccacatatacggc -3′. The thermal cycling parameters were 1 cycle of 94 °C for 2.5 min followed by 20 cycles of 94 °C for 40 s, 60 °C for 50 s, and 72 °C for 30 s. Amplified product was detectable through the direct incorporation of alkali-stable digoxigenin-11-dUTP (Roche Molecular Biosciences), which was added to the reaction mix. After washing in PBS an anti-digoxigenin-gold antibody (Roche) was incubated on the tissue section for 30 min at room temperature. This was followed by a silver enhancement step (Roche silver enhancement reagents) during which time the amplified expression product became visible by light microscopy. The tissue was counterstained with hematoxylin (Dako Ltd.). Baits were PCR amplified (Pfu, Stratagene) and then cloned in the pB6 plasmid derived from the original pAS2ΔΔ (12Fromont-Racine M. Rain J.C. Legrain P. Nat. Genet. 1997; 16: 277-282Google Scholar). Random and oligo(dT)-primed cDNA libraries from human placenta poly(A)+ RNA and pooled breast cancer-derived cell line (T47-D, MDA-MB-468, MCF-7, BT-20) poly(A)+ RNA were constructed into the pP6 plasmid derived from the original pACT2 plasmid (13Rain J.C. Selig L. De Reuse H. Battaglia V. Reverdy C. Simon S. Lenzen G. Petel F. Wojcik J. Schachter V. Chemama Y. Labigne A. Legrain P. Nature. 2001; 409: 211-215Google Scholar) and transformed inEscherichia coli (DH10B; Invitrogen). The complexity of the primary libraries was more than 50 million clones. The libraries were then transformed into yeast, and 10 million independent yeast colonies were collected, pooled, and stored at −80 °C as equivalent aliquot fractions of the same library. The mating protocol has been described elsewhere (12Fromont-Racine M. Rain J.C. Legrain P. Nat. Genet. 1997; 16: 277-282Google Scholar). Briefly, the screening conditions were adapted for each bait (test screen) before performing the full-size screening. The selectivity of theHIS3 reporter gene was modulated with 3-aminotriazole to obtain a maximum of 384 histidine-positive clones. For all selected clones, LacZ activity was measured in a semiquantitative 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-β-d-galactopyranoside overlay assay. The interacting “prey” fragments of the positive clones were amplified by PCR, analyzed on an agarose gel, and sequenced at their 5′- and 3′-junctions on a PE3700 sequencer. The resulting sequences were then used to identify the corresponding gene in the GenBank data base (NCBI). To discover proteins with novel relevance to breast cancer, bioinformatic filters were applied to exclude those expressed ubiquitously or at high levels in vital organs (liver, lung, heart, central nervous system, digestive system, kidney). Proteomic data bases were queried for frequency, and tissue and subcellular distribution, of proteins identified in the present study. Accumulated cDNA data were also queried for absolute abundance in various tissue types. Proteins were identified for further analysis on the basis of the highest expression in breast cancer, coupled with low or absent expression in vital organs. A further exclusion step was applied to remove proteins already known to be involved in breast cancer or those obviously not associated with plasma membranes. The resulting class of breast cancer-specific or transcriptionally low level proteins were examined for further evidence relevant to tumorigenic processes, such as homology to protein families known to be associated with breast cancer or involved in cancer biology. Other proteins in this class which were previously supported only by cDNA evidence were also included as potential novel breast cancer-specific membrane proteins. Of the 22 proteins selected using the above methods, the three described here were particularly interesting with respect to mRNA distribution, breast cancer-specific changes, and relevant interacting proteins. Purified cell membrane protein preparations were isolated from the MDA-MB-468, T-47D, BT-474, and MCF-7 breast cancer cell lines. The T-47D/MCF-7 estrogen receptor-positive and MDA-MB-468/BT-474 EGF receptor-positive cell lines were pooled, and each pool was independently separated by one-dimensional-PAGE. Sequential 0.5-mm gel slices containing the proteins were subjected to trypsinolysis, and the resulting peptide fragments analyzed by MALDI-TOF and MS/MS. Proteins were identified by mass- and fragment-based data base searching (11Eng J.K. McCormack A.L. Yates III, J.R. J. Am. Soc. Mass Spectrom. 1994; 5: 976-989Google Scholar, 14Page M.J. Amess B. Townsend R.R. Parekh R. Herath A. Brusten L. Zvelebil M.J. Stein R.C. Waterfield M.D. Davies S.C. O'Hare M.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 22: 12589-12594Google Scholar). Selection of peptides for MS/MS analysis was deliberately biased away from those masses contained in highly abundant proteins so as to increase the discovery potential and coverage of lower abundance proteins. In total, 501 distinct proteins were identified from both cell membrane pools (see Table I in the supplemental material). This table provides an accession to each protein sequence obtained by MS/MS and indicates in which cell line pool each protein was identified. The tandem mass peptides used to identify each protein have also been included in supplemental Table I because accession numbers can frequently change, particularly for the more recently identified hypothetical/functionally uncharacterized proteins. The proteins are categorized into five locational groups based on Swiss-Prot annotations, literature citations, and homology searches. However, it is noteworthy that many of the proteins identified can exist in multiple cell locations, but where there is good literature evidence of membrane association we have reflected this in the categorizations in supplemental Table I, which determines the contribution of each locational group to Fig.1 A. The proportion of proteins in each category is illustrated in Fig. 1 A. Categories T, PA, and IM, which represented 51% of the total, contained known trans-plasma membrane (T), plasma membrane-associated (PA), and integral membrane-associated (IM) proteins, respectively (Fig.1 A). Examples of proteins in each of these categories are shown in Fig. 1 B and include known breast cancer membrane antigens such as erbB2/her2neu tyrosine kinase receptor (accession P04626) and EGF receptor (O00688). Intracellular signaling proteins, such as Ras-related proteins and nonreceptor tyrosine kinases, which bind to plasma membrane-associated proteins, were observed in category PA (Fig. 1 B and supplemental Table I), demonstrating that multiple components of cancer signal transduction pathways can be extracted and identified by these proteomic methods. Of the proteins identified, 27% were either hypothetical (proteins predicted from the transcriptome) or of unknown function and cell localization (Fig. 1 A). Based on the number of known membrane-associated proteins found, it is likely that ∼50% of these hypothetical/uncharacterized proteins represent trans-plasma membrane or generally membrane-associated proteins. The two breast cancer cell line pools, one representing estrogen receptor-positive cell lines and the other EGF receptor-positive cell lines, were deliberately chosen to reflect some of the different molecular pathologies known in breast cancer. Although failure to identify a protein is not evidence of its absence in a membrane preparation, many proteins were apparently restricted to, or denoted in, either the EGF receptor pool or the estrogen receptor-positive pool (supplemental Table I). From the pool of hypothetical/uncharacterized proteins we describe more detailed analyses on three, BCMP11, BCMP84, and BCMP101. A representative MS/MS result used to identify protein BCMP84 is shown in Fig.2. All three unique proteins were represented by a low number of expressed sequence tags (ESTs) that did not represent a complete expression profile. In addition, BCMP11 was chosen because of its similarity to the Xenopus laevis XAG embryonic differentiation proteins. BCMP84 was an uncharacterized member of the S100 protein family, several of which are associated with tumor biology. BCMP101 was chosen because, with no known functionally characterized homologs, it represented a completely unique breast cancer membrane-associated protein. Four spectra from protein BCMP11, isolated from T-47D/MCF-7 cell membranes, were found to match a translation of an EST from a human lung carcinoma library (accession AI458391) (supplemental Table I) defining an ORF of 166 amino acids (Fig.3 A). A BLAST search of a human EST data base (www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/blast) identified several overlapping ESTs with matches to the sequence of AI458391, providing additional 5′- and 3′-untranslated region sequences. Primers designated to the 5′- and 3′-untranslated region sequences were used to amplify a full-length clone from T-47D cDNA by PCR (Fig. 3 A). The predicted BCMP11 protein is highly homologous to hAG-2, a novel human protein encoded by a cDNA cloned from the MCF-7 breast cancer cell line (15Thompson D.A. Weigel R.J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 251: 111-116Google Scholar) and localized to chromosomal band 7p21.3 (16Petek E. Windpassinger C. Egger H. Kroisel P.M. Wagner K. Cytogenet. Cell Genet. 2000; 89: 141-142Google Scholar). hAG-2 is the human homolog of XAG-2, a secreted X. laevis protein that is thought to be involved in the regulation of dorsoanterior ectodermal cell fate during cement gland differentiation (17Aberger F. Weidinger G. Grunz H. Richter K. Mech. Dev. 1998; 72: 115-130Google Scholar). BCMP11, like hAG-2, is predicted to be an extracellular protein with an N-terminal signal sequence (psort.nibb.ac.jp). In view of the high degree of sequence identity between the two proteins, we have named BCMP11 “hAG-3” (GenBank AY069977; Swiss-Prot Q8TD06). Protein BCMP84 was isolated from the MDA-MB-468/BT-474 cell membrane pool. Amino acid sequences from a single MS/MS were found to match a translation of an EST from a human colon carcinoma cell line (accession number AA315020) (Fig. 3 B). Overlapping ESTs were identified which established a complete ORF of 104 amino acids. A full-length clone was amplified by PCR from MDA-MB-468 cDNA (Fig.3 B). The predicted BCMP84 protein shows similarity to the S100 family of calcium-binding proteins and the predicted protein product of a recently identified cDNA (AY007220), which is identical to BCMP84. The protein encoded by AY007220 has been named S100A14 and annotated as a novel member of the S100 family of calcium binding proteins (Swiss-Prot Q9HCY8). The BCMP84 gene lies at chromosomal position 1q21 within the S100 calcium binding protein gene cluster (18Schafer B.W. Wicki R. Engelkamp D. Mattei M.G. Heizmann C.W. Genomics. 1995; 25: 638-643Google Scholar). Three spectra from protein BCMP101, isolated from MDA-MB-468/BT-474 cell membranes, were found to match a translation of an EST from a human pooled library of testis, fetal lung, and B-cell cDNA (GenBank accession AI827549; dbEST identification 2915502). Additional overlapping ESTs were identified, and alignment with genomic cloneAC021396.2 established a complete ORF of 310 amino acids. Primers designed to the 5′- and 3′-untranslated region sequences were used to amplify a full-length clone from MDA-MB-468 cDNA by PCR (Fig.3 C). The predicted protein product of a recently identified, uncharacterized cDNA clone, NSE-2 (GenBank AJ417849; Swiss-Prot Q96KN1) is identical to BCMP101. The BCMP101 gene lies on chromosome 8 at position q24.21, and the ORF is encoded by a single exon. The predicted BCMP101 protein has a homolog on chromosome 2 (GenBankCAD10038); however, the functions of both proteins are unknown, and analysis of the BCMP101 protein sequence identified no motifs that might suggest a particular function or cellular location. C-terminal tagging with green SuperGloTM-AFP and immunocytochemistry were used to determine the cellular localization of BCMP11, BCMP84, and BCMP101 proteins in MDA-MB-468 and T-47D cell lines. In addition, yeast two-hybrid cloning analysis was used to identify tumor cell line-derived proteins interacting with full-length BCMP84 and BCMP101 proteins and mature BCMP11 protein (signal sequence deleted). Transient transfection analysis of AFP-tagged BCMP11 cDNA construct demonstrated that the translated AFP fusion protein was localized in secretory or endosome-like organelles in both T-47D and MDA-MB-468 cells (Fig. 4 A). Indeed, BCMP11 has a putative signal sequence and is predicted to be a secreted extracellular protein. In addition, yeast two-hybrid cloning identified the human homolog of a rat glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored metastasis-associated protein, C4.4A, (GenBank NM_014400) (19Rosel M. Claas C. Seiter S. Herlevsen M. Zoller M. Oncogene. 1998; 17: 1989-2002Google Scholar) and the extracellular domain of dystroglycan as BCMP11-interacting proteins (20Fletcher G.C. Patel S. Tyson K. Adam P.J. Schenker M. Loader J.A. Daviet L. Legrain P. Parekh R. Harris A.L. Terrett J.A. Br. J. Cancer. 2003; (in press)Google Scholar). An interaction between BCMP11 and C4.4A is particularly interesting given that both proteins are expressed in carcinoma tissues prone to metastasis. Analysis of the cellular location of an AFP-tagged BCMP101 demonstrated widespread intracellular localization but also significant expression associated with the plasma membrane in both MDA-MB-468 and T-47D cell lines (Fig. 4 B). Indeed, we observed particularly high levels of BCMP101 plasma membrane localization in areas of cell-cell contact (Fig. 4 B, ii). Consistent with this, BCMP101 was found to interact specifically with α1-catenin (Swiss-Prot accession P35221) by yeast two-hybrid analysis. α1-Catenin protein was also identified in our breast cancer cell membrane preparations (see supplemental Table I; plasma membrane-associated accession P35221). Transient transfection analysis of an AFP-tagged BCMP84 cDNA construct demonstrated that the translated AFP fusion protein was localized in the plasma membrane"
https://openalex.org/W2046961412,"Perilipin A coats the lipid storage droplets in adipocytes and is polyphosphorylated by protein kinase A (PKA); the fact that PKA activates lipolysis in adipocytes suggests a role for perilipins in this process. To assess whether perilipins participate directly in PKA-mediated lipolysis, we have expressed constructs coding for native and mutated forms of the two major splice variants of the perilipin gene, perilipins A and B, in Chinese hamster ovary fibroblasts. Perilipins localize to lipid droplet surfaces and displace the adipose differentiation-related protein that normally coats the droplets in these cells. Perilipin A inhibits triacylglycerol hydrolysis by 87% when PKA is quiescent, but activation of PKA and phosphorylation of perilipin A engenders a 7-fold lipolytic activation. Mutation of PKA sites within the N-terminal region of perilipin abrogates the PKA-mediated lipolytic response. In contrast, perilipin B exerts only minimal protection against lipolysis and is unresponsive to PKA activation. Since Chinese hamster ovary cells contain no PKA-activated lipase, we conclude that the expression of perilipin A alone is sufficient to confer PKA-mediated lipolysis in these cells. Moreover, the data indicate that the unique C-terminal portion of perilipin A is responsible for its protection against lipolysis and that phosphorylation at the N-terminal PKA sites attenuates this protective effect.

Dhillon G.S. Londos C. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 15130-15138Google Scholar). Historically, this stimulation has been attributed to phosphorylation and activation of hormone-sensitive lipase (HSL), but as noted previously (2Londos C. Brasaemle D.L. Schultz C.J. Adler-Wailes D.C. Levin D.M. Kimmel A.R. Rondinone C.M. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1999; 892: 155-168Google Scholar, 3Holm C. Osterlund T. Laurell H. Contreras J.A. Annu. Rev. Nutr. 2000; 20: 365-393Google Scholar), the meager doubling of HSL activity upon phosphorylation in vitro falls far short of explaining the 30–100-fold activation of cellular lipolysis upon elevation of PKA activity in isolated primary adipocytes. Although some the of differences between the magnitude of the in vitro and in vivo responses may be attributed to the PKA-induced translocation of HSL from the cytosol to the lipid storage droplets within adipocytes (4Brasaemle D.L. Levin D.M. Adler-Wailes D.C. Londos C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1483: 251-262Google Scholar), it is likely that additional factors, notably the perilipins, contribute to the cellular response.The perilipins are a class of proteins found exclusively at the limiting surface of lipid storage droplets, i.e. at the lipid/aqueous interface, in adipocytes and in steroidogenic cells (5Greenberg A.S. Egan J.J. Wek S.A. Garty N.B. Blanchette-Mackie E.J. Londos C. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 11341-11346Google Scholar, 6Servetnick D.A. Brasaemle D.L. Gruia-Gray J. Kimmel A.R. Wolff J. Londos C. J.

These proteins are the most abundant PKA substrates in adipocytes (5Greenberg A.S. Egan J.J. Wek S.A. Garty N.B. Blanchette-Mackie E.J. Londos C. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 11341-11346Google Scholar), and both their subcellular location and polyphosphorylation by PKA suggest a role for the perilipins in PKA-mediated lipolysis. In adipocytes, alternative mRNA splicing gives rise to perilipins A and B, the former at much higher levels than the latter (8Greenberg A.S. Egan J.J. Wek S.A. Moos Jr., M.C. Londos C. Kimmel A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 12035-12039Google Scholar). Thus far, functional studies point to a role for the perilipins in protecting stored TAG from hydrolysis by cellular lipases. Ectopic expression of perilipin A in 3T3-L1 adipoblasts results in perilipin A-coated lipid droplets and increases the half-life of stored TAG deposits by a factor of 4.5 (9Brasaemle D.L. Rubin B. Harten I.A. Gruia-Gray J. Kimmel A.R. Londos C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 38486-38493Google Scholar). Also, treatment of 3T3-L1 adipocytes with tumor necrosis factor-α both reduces expression of perilipin A and increases basal lipolysis. With the use of an adenovirus vector to maintain perilipin expression during tumor necrosis factor-α treatment, Souza et al. (10Souza S.C. de Vargas L.M. Yamamoto M.T. Lien P. Franciosa M.D. Moss L.G. Greenberg A.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 24665-24669Google Scholar) found that expression of either perilipin A or B was sufficient to maintain a coating of perilipin on the droplets and to suppress tumor necrosis factor-α-activated lipolysis. Such findings further support the conclusion that perilipins can protect the intracellular TAG from hydrolysis by lipases. Finally, two reports describing the phenotype of the perilipin null (11Martinez-Botas J. Anderson J.B. Tessier D. Lapillone A. Chang B.H.J. Quast M.J. Forenstein D. Chen K.H. Chan L. Nat. Genet. 2000; 26: 474-479Google Scholar, 12Tansey J.T. Sztalryd C. Gruia-Gray J. Roush D.L. Zee J.V. Gavrilova O. Reitman M.L. Deng C.X. Li C. Kimmel A.R. Londos C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 6494-6499Google Scholar) mouse show that these animals have greatly reduced adipose stores and constitutively high levels of basal lipolysis in their isolated adipose cells, again consistent with the loss of the protective effect of perilipin. In one of these reports (12Tansey J.T. Sztalryd C. Gruia-Gray J. Roush D.L. Zee J.V. Gavrilova O. Reitman M.L. Deng C.X. Li C. Kimmel A.R. Londos C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 6494-6499Google Scholar), it was shown that in the absence of perilipin, the adipose cells droplets were coated with adipose differentiation-related protein (ADRP), indicating that this related protein did not substitute for perilipin in providing a protective barrier against lipolysis in the absence of PKA activation.None of the above studies address a role for phosphorylation of perilipin in the lipolytic response. To this end, using CHO cells, we have examined the functional consequences of introducing perilipin A, perilipin B, and mutant variants of these species. We report herein that the expression of perilipin A alone is sufficient to inhibit lipolysis by 87% and that upon activation of PKA, lipolysis is stimulated by 7-fold. These results re-create the strong regulatory role for perilipin seen in adipocytes and contrast with results from another system that detected only a modest, ∼50% stimulation by PKA upon introduction of perilipin A into cells (13Souza S.C. Muliro K.V. Liscum L. Lien P. Yamamoto M.T. Schaffer J.E. Dallal G.E. Wang X. Kraemer F.B. Obin M. Greenberg A.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 8267-8272Google Scholar). We further show that such regulation is abrogated upon mutation of the PKA sites that lie within the N-terminal region of perilipin, as did Souza et al. (13Souza S.C. Muliro K.V. Liscum L. Lien P. Yamamoto M.T. Schaffer J.E. Dallal G.E. Wang X. Kraemer F.B. Obin M. Greenberg A.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 8267-8272Google Scholar). In contrast, we report that neither native nor mutated perilipin B provide protection.RESULTSAs we reported previously (20Brasaemle D.L. Barber T. Wolins N.E. Serrero G. Blanchette-Mackie E.J. Londos C. J. Lipid Res. 1997; 38: 2249-2263Google Scholar), lipid droplets in CHO cells are coated with ADRP (Figs. 2 and 3); this protein and the perilipins share significant sequence homology over their N-terminal domains (7Londos C. Brasaemle D.L. Schultz C.J. Segrest J.P. Kimmel A.R. Semin. Cell Dev. Biol. 1999; 10: 51-58Google Scholar). Upon expression of constructs that encode either native or mutated perilipin A, as well as native or mutated perilipin B, the droplets acquired a coating of perilipin and the ADRP diminished, as evidenced both by immunostaining (Fig. 3) and immunoblotting (Figs. 2 and4). This change in the lipid droplet coat protein is a reprise of the perilipin-for-ADRP switch that occurs during differentiation of 3T3-L1 adipocytes (20Brasaemle D.L. Barber T. Wolins N.E. Serrero G. Blanchette-Mackie E.J. Londos C. J. Lipid Res. 1997; 38: 2249-2263Google Scholar). Moreover, the amounts of unmodified and mutated perilipins A and B were highly similar. The only cell lines carried forth to the metabolic studies below were those in which the perilipin (A or B) expression was sufficient to eliminate all ADRP expression, as judged both by immunofluorescence and by immunoblotting. Upon repeated passage of some perilipin A-expressing cell lines, the perilipin expression waned, and the metabolic phenotype reverted to that similar to the control cells with ADRP-coated droplets. In general, a reversal of the perilipin A phenotype occurred when the perilipin expression declined by ∼50%.Figure 4Immunoblot analysis of different types of cells. Cells from Fig. 3 were homogenized, subjected to SDS-PAGE, and stained for perilipin and ADRP. Abbreviations are as described in legend for Fig 1. VC, vector control; PA, perilipin A; PB, perilipin B.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)To assess lipolytic activity, CHO cells were loaded with [3H]oleic acids as described previously (9Brasaemle D.L. Rubin B. Harten I.A. Gruia-Gray J. Kimmel A.R. Londos C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 38486-38493Google Scholar), after which the efflux of [3H]oleic acid to the medium was monitored for 3 h. Triacsin C was included in all incubations during the efflux phase to prevent reutilization of fatty acids released from hydrolyzed TAG (21Igal R.A. Wang P. Coleman R.A. Biochem. J. 1997; 324: 529-534Google Scholar, 22Tomoda H. Igarashi K. Cyong J.C. Omura S. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 4214-4219Google Scholar, 23Tomoda H. Igarashi K. Omura S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1987; 921: 595-598Google Scholar). In control cells (with ADRP-coated droplets), nearly 30% of the stored [3H]oleic acid was released to the medium over 3 h, and PKA activation inhibited fatty acid efflux by about 30%. In contrast, in cells expressing perilipin A, in the absence of PKA activation, the release of [3H]oleic acid was suppressed by 87% when compared with that in control cells with ADRP-coated lipid droplets. Upon activation of PKA with the combination of forskolin and IBMX, lipolysis was activated by 7-fold (range of 3–13-fold) over the unstimulated cells. Iin Fig.5 (Perilipin A panel), note that the stimulatory effects of PKA activation on oleic acid release in Peri A cells occurred only after a lag of ∼30 min. During this 30-min period, there were no differences in the rates of oleic acid release in unstimulated and stimulated cells; thereafter, lipolysis under the two conditions diverged and remained nearly linear over the next 2.5 h. There was another highly reproducible break in the curve at 120 min, indicating that the perilipin-mediated increase in lipolysis is a slowly evolving process. The lipolytic rates for all constructs tested over the 2.5-h period are depicted in TableI. The 30-min lag was evident in all cells infected with perilipin species that were responsive to PKA activation. The paradoxical inhibition of oleic acid release upon PKA activation of control cells occurred without a detectable lag, as shown in Fig. 4 (Vector Control Panel). Perilipin A from mouse contains six consensus PKA phosphorylation sites (Fig. 1). We also tested a mutant variant of perilipin A in which the three most N-terminal serines within PKA sites were mutated to alanines (Peri 3XN). Introduction of this form of perilipin A also prevented the release of radiolabeled fatty acid stores in the absence of PKA activation, but unlike native perilipin A, the mutant form was relatively unresponsive to PKA activation. In contrast to the 7-fold increase with the perilipin A cells, the activation of the mutated perilipin was merely 1.7-fold (Table I). In contrast, perilipin B, the shorter splice variant of the perilipin gene failed to shield the TAG from hydrolysis and the native perilipin B, inhibiting activity by only 13%, when compared with the 90% inhibition by perilipin A. Also, perilipin B cells were unresponsive to PKA activation. Oddly, the mutated form of perilipin B (Peri B 3X) was more protective than native perilipin B, inhibiting lipolysis by 63% but unresponsive to PKA activation (Table I).Figure 5Time courses of [3H]oleic acid release under unstimulated and stimulated conditions.

Open table in a new tab Under the loading conditions used in these studies, the great majority of the fatty acids taken up by the cells (>75%) were stored as TAG, and the distribution of tritiated oleic acid among the phospholipid, diacylglycerol, cholesteryl ester, and fatty acid pools was independent of the nature of coating on the lipid droplets (Fig.6). However, the magnitude of uptake and storage of [3H]oleic acid in the TAG pool was dependent on which protein coated the droplets. Cells expressing perilipin A accumulated the greatest amount, 148.9 ± 19.4 nmol oleic acid, greater than the perilipin B-expressing cells, 125.6 ± 3 nmol oleic acid, which, in turn, was greater than control cells with ADRP-coated droplets, 103.0 ± 10.3 nmol oleic acid (mean ± S.E., n = 6). These accumulations represent the steady state balance between lipogenesis and lipolysis during the lipid loading phase; accordingly, these levels reflect the differences in unstimulated lipolysis since the cells were loaded under the non-stimulated condition, i.e. no IBMX or forskolin. After the 3-h efflux incubation, the non-TAG pools lost no measurable [3H]oleic acid (Fig. 6), whereas the TAG pools exhibited substantial losses, which again was dependent on the lipid droplet coat protein and the PKA activation state (Fig.7). Moreover, TLC analysis revealed that all of the radiolabel that appeared in the medium was in the form of [3H]oleic acid, which could be accounted for entirely by the loss of radiolabeled fatty acid from the intracellular TAG pool.Figure 6Distribution of [3H]oleic acid among lipid pools in loaded CHO cells.

(n = 6).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)The percentages of TAG hydrolyzed over 3 h in control, Peri A, and Peri A 3XN cells are summarized in Fig. 7. It is clear that the TAG pool, presumably within the Peri A-coated pool, is the source of the accelerated oleic acid release under PKA-stimulation.DISCUSSIONIn the present study, we have demonstrated that expression of perilipin in CHO fibroblasts results in perilipin-coated lipid droplets from which the ADRP has disappeared. Perilipin A, but not perilipin B, suppresses lipolysis of droplet TAG, and PKA phosphorylation of perilipin A engenders a robust lipolytic reaction despite the absence of HSL or any other PKA-mediated lipase. Unlike PKA-mediated lipolysis in adipocytes, the perilipin A-mediated lipolysis occurs only after a lag of ∼30 min. Lipolysis is not stimulated when the serine residues within the three PKA sites at the N-terminal region of perilipin A are mutated to alanines.The finding that the proteinaceous coating of the lipid droplets may confer PKA-mediated regulation of TAG hydrolysis prompts a reconsideration of the conventional view of PKA-mediated lipolysis in adipocytes. Heretofore, such activation was attributed primarily to the phosphorylation of HSL, following which the lipase was activated, but only minimally, and translocated from the cytosol to the lipid droplet surface. Clearly, given the above findings, one must account for the contribution of PKA phosphorylation of perilipin to the regulation of lipolysis. Interestingly, the HSL null mouse retains a modicum of isoproterenol-stimulated lipolytic activity, which led to the suggestion that adipocytes may contain a second hormone-sensitive lipase (24Slatiel A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 97: 535-537Google Scholar). Given the present results, plus the likelihood that theHSL null mouse expresses perilipins in its adipocytes, the presence of these lipid droplet-coating proteins may explain the residual PKA-activated lipolysis in the HSL null mouse (25Osuga J. Ishibashi S. Oka T. Yagyu H. Tozawa R. Fujimoto A. Shionoiri F. Yahagi N. Kraemer F.B. Tsutsumi O. Yamada N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 787-792Google Scholar).Despite the earlier report suggesting that HSL may be expressed in CHO cells (26Osuga J. Ishibashi S. Shimano H. Inaba T. Kawamura M. Yazaki Y. Yamada N. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 233: 655-657Google Scholar), we detected no HSL by immunoblotting the these cells nor could we detect any PKA-stimulated lipolytic activity in CHO cell homogenates (data not shown). Thus, the neutral lipid lipase responsible for the TAG hydrolysis in the CHO cells appears unresponsive to PKA, and it is concluded that PKA regulation of lipolysis in CHO cells expressing perilipin A results solely from the PKA phosphorylation of the perilipin. Clearly, the ability of the endogenous CHO cell lipase(s) to hydrolyze stored TAG under the PKA-stimulated condition is dependent on the phosphorylation of perilipin A. This conclusion is supported by the finding that mutation of selected PKA sites eliminated the regulated response. In a separate study, we show that perilipin A acts cooperatively with HSL in lipolysis when both proteins are introduced into CHO cells. 2C. Sztalryd, G. D. H. Xu, A. R. Kimmel, and C. Londos, submitted for publication. Thus, the ability of perilipin to regulate lipolysis of the TAG within lipid droplets appears to be manifested with any lipase that has access to the lipid droplet surface. The enhancement of lipolytic activity by perilipin A and the endogenous lipase of CHO cells is clearly a time-dependent process that requires at least 30 min after stimulation to become manifest. In contrast, when both HSL and perilipin are introduced into CHO cells, the lipolytic activation is nearly immediate with no detectable lag.2 We assume that the phosphorylation of HSL fosters this immediate reaction in contrast to the endogenous lipase, which is apparently not a PKA substrate. Oddly, perilipin B neither protected against lipolysis nor conferred significant PKA regulation of lipolysis, which was not anticipated given the results of Souza et al. (10Souza S.C. de Vargas L.M. Yamamoto M.T. Lien P. Franciosa M.D. Moss L.G. Greenberg A.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 24665-24669Google Scholar). However, in the present study, we expressed perilipin B without perilipin A, whereas in the studies of Souza et al. (10Souza S.C. de Vargas L.M. Yamamoto M.T. Lien P. Franciosa M.D. Moss L.G. Greenberg A.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 24665-24669Google Scholar), perilipin B was introduced into cells that contained abundant perilipin A.The fatty acids that appeared in the CHO cell medium in the present study derived from the triolein stored in the intracellular neutral lipid droplets, which were coated with either ADRP or the perilipins introduced into the cells. No other lipid pool contributed to the fatty acid that was released. Moreover, stimulation of cells expressing perilipin A led to a loss solely from the triolein from within the perilipin-coated droplets. Thus, one may assume that the PKA-mediated increase in fatty acid release stems from changes in the lipid droplet surface upon phosphorylation of perilipin A, a conclusion supported by the finding that the 3XN mutant species failed to respond to PKA activation.The present data permit speculation on the structural determinants for perilipin function at the lipid droplet surface. If perilipins A and B assume similar extended conformations at the droplet surface, the greater protection against hydrolysis of the longer splice variant, perilipin A, may be attributed to its greater length and thus greater coverage of droplet surface, i.e. it is the extended C-terminal tail (∼12 kDa) of perilipin A that is important in protecting against lipolysis in the unstimulated state. It follows that phosphorylation of PKA sites in the N-terminal region induces a conformational change in the C-terminal region that exposes portions of the lipid droplet surface to lipase action under conditions of PKA activation.In addition to the present studies on CHO cells, it is reasonable to assume that phosphorylation of perilipin contributes to the lipolytic activation in adipocytes. This conclusion is reinforced by the finding that lipolytic stimulation by β-adrenergic agonists of adipocytes from perilipin null mice is strongly blunted despite the presence of normal amounts of HSL (12Tansey J.T. Sztalryd C. Gruia-Gray J. Roush D.L. Zee J.V. Gavrilova O. Reitman M.L. Deng C.X. Li C. Kimmel A.R. Londos C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 6494-6499Google Scholar).After completion of the present studies, a similar study appeared that largely agrees with a number of the findings reported herein (13Souza S.C. Muliro K.V. Liscum L. Lien P. Yamamoto M.T. Schaffer J.E. Dallal G.E. Wang X. Kraemer F.B. Obin M. Greenberg A.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 8267-8272Google Scholar), but that study did not include studies with perilipin B, and mutational analysis was limited to the construct we term Peri A 3XN (13Souza S.C. Muliro K.V. Liscum L. Lien P. Yamamoto M.T. Schaffer J.E. Dallal G.E. Wang X. Kraemer F.B. Obin M. Greenberg A.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 8267-8272Google Scholar). Although the present studies and those of Souza et al.(13Souza S.C. Muliro K.V. Liscum L. Lien P. Yamamoto M.T. Schaffer J.E. Dallal G.E. Wang X. Kraemer F.B. Obin M. Greenberg A.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 8267-8272Google Scholar) agree qualitatively, there are large quantitative differences between the two studies. For example, we find that introduction of perilipin A suppresses lipolysis by ∼90% when compared with control cells, whereas Souza et al. (13Souza S.C. Muliro K.V. Liscum L. Lien P. Yamamoto M.T. Schaffer J.E. Dallal G.E. Wang X. Kraemer F.B. Obin M. Greenberg A.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 8267-8272Google Scholar) observed a suppression of about 50%. Also, we find that activation of Peri A cells leads to 162% greater lipolysis than in control cells, as compared with a 50% increment in the other study. Further, PKA activation of perilipin A cells produced a 700% increase in lipolysis, as compared with a 160% increase in the published study. Our findings suggest that PKA phosphorylation of perilipin A does far more than merely abrogate the protective effect of the perilipin, as suggested by Souza et al. (13Souza S.C. Muliro K.V. Liscum L. Lien P. Yamamoto M.T. Schaffer J.E. Dallal G.E. Wang X. Kraemer F.B. Obin M. Greenberg A.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 8267-8272Google Scholar), but additionally, exposes considerably more TAG to lipase activity than is exposed in the control cells containing droplets coated with ADRP. Reasons for these differences may include the use by Souza et al. (13Souza S.C. Muliro K.V. Liscum L. Lien P. Yamamoto M.T. Schaffer J.E. Dallal G.E. Wang X. Kraemer F.B. Obin M. Greenberg A.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 8267-8272Google Scholar) of NIH 3T3 fibroblasts engineered to be more lipogenic by using cells that also expressed an ectopic fatty acid transporter and an ectopic acyl synthase, whereas in the present studies, we used an acyl synthase inhibitor to block re-esterification of fatty acids. Also, we used CHO cells that were stably transfected with the various perilipin constructs, whereas Souzaet al. (13Souza S.C. Muliro K.V. Liscum L. Lien P. Yamamoto M.T. Schaffer J.E. Dallal G.E. Wang X. Kraemer F.B. Obin M. Greenberg A.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 8267-8272Google Scholar) infected the cells with perilipin adenovirus. In separate studies, we, too, used adenovirus to introduce perilipin into cells and find modest effects with CHO cells similar to those reported by Souza et al. (13Souza S.C. Muliro K.V. Liscum L. Lien P. Yamamoto M.T. Schaffer J.E. Dallal G.E. Wang X. Kraemer F.B. Obin M. Greenberg A.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 8267-8272Google Scholar) for NIH 3T3 cells.2In parallel studies, we demonstrate both that HSL translocation to lipid droplets requires that such droplets be coated with PKA-phosphorylatable perilipin A2 and that HSL be phosphorylated at one of its C-terminal PKA sites, Ser-659 or 660. 3C.-L. Su, C. Sztalryd, J. A. Contreras, C. Holm, A. R. Kimmel, and C. Londos, submitted for publication. Thus, the physiological activation lipolysis in adipocytes is a concerted reaction between phospho-HSL and phospho-perilipin. Acute mobilization of adipose triacylglyerol stores for energy is regulated primarily by the activation state of cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA)1 (1Honnor R.C. Dhillon G.S. Londos C. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 15130-15138Google Scholar). Historically, this stimulation has been attributed to phosphorylation and activa"

Among them, PPARγ has been further characterized into three subtypes, PPARγ1, PPARγ2, and PPARγ3 (2Fajas L. Auboeuf D. Raspe E. Schoonjans K. Lefebvre A.M. Saladin R. Najib J. Laville M.

There are several known ligands for PPARγ, including the natural prostaglandin 15-deoxy-Δ12,14-prostaglandin J2 (PGJ2), the synthetic anti-diabetic thiazolidinediones, and certain polyunsaturated fatty acids. PPARγ ligands are able to bind to the PPARγ transcription factor, which then forms a heterodimeric complex with retinoid X receptor that functions as a central regulator of differentiation, and modulator of cell growth.

Among PPARγ ligands, the anti-tumorigenic activity of troglitazone (TGZ) has been well established. For example, TGZ significantly inhibits tumor growth of human colorectal cancer cells (HCT-116), human breast cancer cells (MCF-7), and human prostate cancer cells (PC-3) in immunodeficient mice (11Kubota T.

However, the molecular mechanism of TGZ effects on anti-tumorigenesis, other than PPARγ activation, is not known. TGZ has specific functions, in addition to being a PPARγ agonist. For example, TGZ up-regulates nitric oxide synthesis (14Hattori Y. Hattori S. Kasai K. Hypertension. 1999; 33: 943-948Google Scholar), induces the p53 pathway (15Okura T. Nakamura M. Takata Y. Watanabe S. Kitami Y. Hiwada K. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 2000; 407: 227-235Google Scholar), inhibits cholesterol biosynthesis (16Wang M. Wise S.C. Leff T. Su T.Z. Diabetes. 1999; 48: 254-260Google Scholar), induces p21 cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor (17Sugimura A. Kiriyama Y. Nochi H. Tsuchiya H. Tamoto K. Sakurada Y. Ui M. Tokumitsu Y. Biochem. Biophys.

Pharmacol. 2001; 62: 1071-1079Google Scholar), and activates extracellular signal-regulated protein kinase (ERK) (19Takeda K. Ichiki T. Tokunou T. Iino N. Takeshita A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 48950-48955Google Scholar) in a PPARγ-independent manner. Thus, the molecular mechanism of TGZ-induced anti-tumorigenesis may result from multiple mechanisms. The Egr-1 transcription factor (also known as NGFI-A, TIS8, Krox-24, and Zif268) is a member of the immediate early gene family and encodes a nuclear phosphoprotein involved in the regulation of cell growth and differentiation in response to signals such as mitogens, growth factors, and stress stimuli. However, many reports have recently suggested Egr-1 as a tumor suppressor gene (20Liu C. Rangnekar V.M. Adamson E. Mercola D. Cancer Gene Ther. 1998; 5: 3-28Google Scholar). Egr-1 activates PTEN (phosphatase and tensin homolog) tumor suppressor gene during UV irradiation (21Virolle T. Adamson E.D. Baron V. Birle D. Mercola D. Mustelin T. de Belle I. Nat. Cell. Biol. 2001; 3: 1124-1128Google Scholar), and re-expression of Egr-1 suppresses the growth of transformed cells both in soft agar and in athymic nude mice (22Liu C. Yao J. Mercola D. Adamson E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 20315-20323Google Scholar). Egr-1 is induced very early in the apoptotic process, where it mediates the activation of downstream regulators such as p53 (23Muthukkumar S.

However, Egr-1-induced apoptosis has been reported in p53−/− cells (26Zhang W. Chen S. Exp.

Moreover, Egr-1 is down-regulated in several types of neoplasia, as well as in an array of tumor cell lines (27Huang R.P. Fan Y. de Belle I. Niemeyer C. Gottardis M.M. Mercola D. Adamson E.D. Int. J. Cancer. 1997; 72: 102-109Google Scholar, 28Huang R.P. Liu C. Fan Y. Mercola D. Adamson E.D. Cancer Res. 1995; 55: 5054-5062Google Scholar). These results indicate that Egr-1 plays a consistent role in growth suppression. Therefore, it is reasonable to think that Egr-1 could be regulated, at least in part by TGZ, because both TGZ and Egr-1 have anti-tumorigenic effects. In the present study, we examine the relationship between TGZ and Egr-1 expression and the effect of TGZ-induced apoptosis. We show that TGZ induces Egr-1 expression by transcriptional and post-transcriptional regulation. Egr-1 induction by TGZ results in the increase of binding affinity and transactivation of the promoter containing Egr-1 consensus sequences, thereby possibly inducing other anti-tumorigenic proteins. Furthermore, Egr-1 induction by TGZ appears to be independent of PPARγ, because other PPARγ ligands do not induce Egr-1. These data provide a novel mechanism for understanding how troglitazone exerts its anti-tumorigenic activity. Human colorectal carcinoma cells, HCT-116, were purchased from ATCC (Manassas, VA) and maintained in McCoy's 5A medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and gentamicin (10 μg/ml). All of HCT-116 cell experiments were done within passage 16. Rosiglitazone (BRL), azelaoyl PAF (PAF), PGJ2, and ciglitazone were purchased from Cayman Chemical (Ann Arbor, MI). TGZ was obtained from Parke-Davis Pharmaceutical Research. PD98059, SB203580, and herbimycin were purchased from Sigma. Egr-1 (sc-110), Egr-2 (sc-190), Egr-3 (sc-191), p53 (sc-263), PTEN (sc-7974), ERK1 (sc-94), ERK2 (sc-154), PPARγ1 (sc-7273), and actin (sc-1615) antibodies were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA). Phospho-ERK antibody was obtained from Cell Signaling (Beverly, MA). The full-length Egr cDNAs were generated by PCR from human universal QUICK-Clone cDNA (Clontech, Palo Alto, CA) using the following primers: for the Egr-1, 5′-GACACCAGCTCTCCAGCCTGCTCGTCCAGG-3′ (top strand) and 5′-TTCCCTTTAGCAAATTTCAATTGTCCTGGG-3′ (bottom strand); for the Egr-2, 5′-GTGCGAGGAGCAAATGATGACCGCCAAGGC-3′ (top strand) and 5′-CAGCCTGAGTCTCATCTCAAGGTGTCCGGG-3′ (bottom strand); for the Egr-3, 5′-CGGCGGCAGCTCGGGAGTGCTATGACCGGC-3′ (top strand) and 5′-TCTGGGGGCCCGATCCTCAGGCGCAGGTGG-3′ (bottom strand). The amplified products were cloned into pCR2.1 TOPO vector (Stratagene, CA) and followed by cloning into pCDNA3.1/NEO expression vector (Invitrogen). The pEBS14luc construct was generously provided by Dr. Gerald Thiel (University of Bari, Bari, Italy). The Egr-1 promoter (−1260 to +35) linked to the luciferase gene was cloned by PCR from human genomic DNA (Promega, Madison, WI) using the following primers: 5′-CGGCTCGAGCGGGAGGAGGAGCGAGGAGGCGGCGG-3′ (top strand; XhoI site is underlined) and 5′-CCCAAGCTTGGGCGGCGGCGGCTCCCCAAGTTCTGCGGC-3′ (bottom strand; HindIII site is underlined). After PCR amplification, the fragment was digested with XhoI andHindIII and ligated into pGLBasic3 luciferase vector. All plasmids were sequenced for verification. The DNA content for sub-G1 population was determined by flow cytometry. HCT-116 cells were plated at 3 × 105 cells/well in 6-well plates, incubated for 16 h, and then treated with TGZ at different time points in the presence of serum. The cells (attached and floating cells) were then harvested, washed with phosphate-buffered saline, fixed by the slow addition of cold 70% ethanol to a total of 1 ml, and stored at 4 °C overnight. The fixed cells were pelleted, washed with ethanol (50%, then 30%), followed by phosphate-buffered saline, and stained in 1 ml of 20 μg/ml propidium iodide containing 1 mg/ml RNase in phosphate-buffered saline for 20 min. 7,500 cells were examined by flow cytometry using BD Biosciences FACSort equipped with CellQuest software by gating on an area versus width dot plot to exclude cell debris and cell aggregates. Apoptosis was measured by the level of sub-diploid DNA contained in cells following treatment with compounds using CellQuest software. Soft agar assays were performed to compare the clonogenic potential of HCT-116 cells in semisolid medium. HCT-116 cells were resuspended at 10,000 cells in 2 ml of 0.4% agarose-containing TGZ in McCoy's 5A medium and plated on top of 1 ml of 0.8% agarose in 6-well plates. Plates were incubated for 2–3 weeks at 37 °C. Cell colonies were visualized by staining with 0.5 ml of p-iodonitrotetrazolium violet staining (Sigma). HCT-116 cells were plated in 6-well plates at 2 × 105 cells/well in McCoy's 5A medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. After growth for 16 h, plasmid mixtures containing 0.5 μg of promoter linked to luciferase, 0.5 μg of expression vector, and 0.05 μg of pRL-null (Promega) were transfected by LipofectAMINE (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's protocol. After 48 h of transfection, the cells were harvested in 1× luciferase lysis buffer, and luciferase activity was determined and normalized to the pRL-null luciferase activity using a dual luciferase assay kit (Promega). For the PPARγ ligand treatments, cells were treated with PPARγ ligand in the absence of serum for 24 h and assayed for luciferase activity. When reaching 60–80% confluence in 10-cm plates, the cells were grown in the absence of serum for 24 h and then treated with either vehicle or TGZ (5 μm) for 2 h. The transcription inhibitor, actinomycin D (5 μg/ml), was treated at the indicated time points. Total RNAs were isolated using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's protocol. For Northern blot analysis, 20 μg of total RNA was denatured at 55 °C for 15 min and separated in a 1.0% agarose gel containing 2.2 m formaldehyde and transferred to Hybond-N membrane (Amersham Biosciences). After fixing the membrane by UV, blots were prehybridized in hybridization solution (Rapid-hyb buffer; Amersham Biosciences) for 1 h at 65 °C followed by hybridization with cDNA labeled with [α-32P]dCTP using random primer extension (DECAprimeII kit; Ambion). The probes used were full-length human Egr-1 fragment. After 4 h of incubation at 65 °C, the blots were washed once with 2× SSC/0.1% SDS at room temperature and twice with 0.1× SSC/0.1% SDS at 65 °C. Messenger RNA abundance was estimated by intensities of the hybridization bands of autoradiographs using Scion Image (Scion Image Co.). Equivalent loading of RNA samples was confirmed by hybridizing the same blot with a 32P-labeled glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase probe, which recognizes RNA of ∼1.3 kb. The level of protein expression was evaluated using Western blot analysis with Egr-1, Egr-2, Egr-3, PPARγ1, PTEN, and phospho-ERK antibodies. Cells were grown to 60–80% confluency in 10-cm plates followed by 24 h of additional growth in the absence of serum. Cells were treated with indicated compounds, and total cell lysates were isolated using 0.1 mTris/pH 8.0 containing proteinase inhibitors (Sigma). After sonication of samples, proteins (30 μg) were separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred for 1 h onto nitrocellulose membrane (Schleicher & Schuell). The blots were blocked overnight with 5% skim milk in TBS-T (Tris-buffered saline/Tween 0.05%), and probed with each antibody for 2 h at room temperature. After washing with TBS-T, the blots were treated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody for 1 h and washed several times. Proteins were detected by the enhanced chemiluminescence system (Amersham Biosciences). Western analysis for p53 was described previously (29Baek S.J. Wilson L.C. Eling T.E. Carcinogenesis. 2002; 23: 425-432Google Scholar). Nuclear extracts were prepared as described previously (30Baek S.J. Horowitz J.M. Eling T.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 33384-33392Google Scholar). For the gel shift assay, double stranded oligonucleotides were end-labeled with [γ-32P]ATP by T4 polynucleotide kinase (New England Biolabs). Assays were performed by incubating 10 μg of nuclear extracts in the binding buffer (Geneka Biotechnology) containing 200,000 cpm of labeled probe for 20 min at room temperature. To assure the specific binding of transcription factors to the probe, the probe was chased by 50-fold molar excess of cold wild type or mutant oligonucleotide. For the supershift experiments, Egr-1 antibody (Geneka Biotechnology) was incubated with nuclear extracts on ice for 30 min before adding to the binding reaction. Samples were then electrophoresed on 5% nondenaturing polyacrylamide gels with 0.5× TBE (Tris/borate/EDTA), and gels were dried and subjected to autoradiography. HCT-116 cells were grown in the absence of serum for 24 h and treated with 5 μm TGZ or vehicle for 3 h. Nuclei were isolated as described previously (30Baek S.J. Horowitz J.M. Eling T.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 33384-33392Google Scholar).In vitro nuclear run-on transcription was carried out using 1 × 107 nuclei and 250 μCi of [α-32P]UTP in transcription-optimized buffer (P118A;Promega). The reaction was performed at 30 °C for 30 min. Labeled transcripts were purified using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen) according to manufacturer's protocol. A total of 1 × 107 cpm elongated nascent RNA per assay was hybridized for 24 h at 65 °C to filter-immobilized 5 μg of plasmid DNA. The filters were washed with 2× SSC/0.1% SDS for 20 min, followed by 0.1× SSC/0.1% SDS for 40 min. The autoradiographs were subjected to densitometric analysis using Scion Image. We examined the correlation between TGZ-induced apoptosis and TGZ-induced anti-tumorigenesis in HCT-116 cells. Anti-tumorigenic activity was measured by soft agar assay, whereas apoptosis was measured by flow cytometry. As shown in Fig.1 A, TGZ treatment in HCT-116 cells dramatically inhibited the growth of HCT-116 cells on soft agar. The growth inhibition by TGZ was concentration-dependent, and 5 μm TGZ completely inhibited the growth of HCT-116 cells in soft agar assays. To determine whether TGZ induces cell cycle arrest and/or apoptosis in HCT-116 cells, flow cytometry analysis was performed (Fig. 1 B). Apoptosis and G1 cell cycle arrest were observed as early as 12 h after treatment with 5 μm TGZ. The stimulation of apoptosis and G1cell cycle arrest by TGZ are consistent with previous publications (8Yin F. Wakino S. Liu Z. Kim S. Hsueh W.A. Collins A.R. Van Herle A.J. Law R.E. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 286: 916-922Google Scholar,31Kitamura S. Miyazaki Y. Shinomura Y. Kondo S. Kanayama S. Matsuzawa Y. Jpn. J. Cancer Res. 1999; 90: 75-80Google Scholar) reporting that TGZ induces apoptosis and cell cycle arrest in human colon and breast cancer cells. One logical mechanism by which TGZ exerts anti-tumorigenesis is the up-regulation of anti-tumorigenic proteins. To address this question, we measured the expression of known anti-tumorigenic proteins, Egr-1, PTEN, and p53. HCT-116 cells were treated with 5 μm TGZ at indicated time points, and Western analysis was performed. As shown in Fig. 2 A, Egr-1 is induced dramatically within 3 h, and longer treatment, up to 24 h, results in a decrease of Egr-1 expression. TGZ-induced Egr-1 expression was also seen in Northern analysis using HCT-116 cells treated with 5 μm TGZ for 2 h (data not shown). We also measured PTEN and p53 tumor suppressor gene expression. PTEN is only marginally induced at an early time point, whereas p53 expression is not altered by TGZ in HCT-116 cells. Taken together, these results suggest that Egr-1 induction by TGZ may be pivotal to the anti-tumorigenic activity of TGZ. Because TGZ is a PPARγ ligand, we next compared TGZ to other PPARγ ligands with regard to Egr-1 induction. HCT-116 cells were treated with several PPARγ ligands, BRL, PGJ2, PAF, ciglitazone, and 13-hydroxyoctadecadienoic acid, for 3 h. These PPARγ ligands are reported to bind and activate PPARγ transcription factor (32Davies S.S. Pontsler A.V. Marathe G.K. Harrison K.A. Murphy R.C. Hinshaw J.C. Prestwich G.D. Hilaire A.S. Prescott S.M. Zimmerman G.A. McIntyre T.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 16015-16023Google Scholar, 33Lehmann J.M. Moore L.B. Smith-Oliver T.A. Wilkison W.O. Willson T.M. Kliewer S.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 12953-12956Google Scholar). Consistent with previous data, Egr-1 induction was seen in TGZ-treated cells, but poor or no induction was observed in other PPARγ ligand-treated cells (Fig. 2 B), suggesting that Egr-1 induction by TGZ may be independent of PPARγ. In addition, the expression of other Egr family proteins, Egr-2 and Egr-3, was not altered by TGZ and other PPARγ ligands, indicating that the effect of TGZ is specific for Egr-1. To address whether Egr-1 protein, produced by TGZ-treated HCT-116 cells, has potential binding activity to the Egr-1 consensus sequences, EMSA was performed. Because Egr-1 protein increases in the presence of TGZ, the protein should bind to the Egr-1 consensus binding site. As shown in Fig.3 A, oligonucleotides containing two copies of Egr-1 binding sites were generated and used as a probe. Nuclear extracts prepared from 5 μm TGZ treatment at different time points (Fig. 3 B, lanes 2–5) and the recombinant proteins, Egr-1, Egr-2, and Egr-3, generated by in vitro translation (Fig. 3 B,lanes 6–8), were used for the EMSA. Using nuclear extracts from TGZ-treated HCT-116 cells and a probe corresponding to the Egr-1 binding site, results show multiple DNA·protein complexes with a mobility shift (Fig. 3 B, arrows α and β). Compared with in vitro synthesized Egr proteins, the shifted band α correspond to Egr-1 proteins, whereas β indicates Egr-3 proteins. Interestingly, a shifted band representing Egr-1 was seen only at the 3-h time point, whereas Egr-3 was constitutively expressed during the time course. A shifted band representing Egr-2 was not detected in TGZ-treated HCT-116 cells. These results are consistent with Egr-1 induction at the 3-h time point after TGZ treatment as assessed by Western analysis. These bands represent a specific protein binding to the Egr-1 sequence elements, because complex formation was diminished by the addition of 50 molar excess of non-radiolabeled identical competitor but not by addition of the identical oligonucleotide in which the Egr-1 sites were point-mutated (Fig.3 C, lanes 2 and 3). To confirm that Egr-1 binds to these sites, we performed a gel shift assay in the presence of Egr-1 antibody to demonstrate supershifting. As shown in Fig. 3 C, the Egr-1 antibody supershifted the band (lanes 4 and 6). This indicates that the shifted bands (SS) contain Egr-1 protein. As a control, we examined Egr-1 binding affinity using nuclear extracts from 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate-treated K562 cells and observed similar results as with the nuclear extracts from TGZ-treated HCT-116 cells (Fig. 3 C, lanes 5 and6). It has been shown that Egr-1 is induced by 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate-treated K562 cells (34Cheng T. Wang Y. Dai W. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 30848-30853Google Scholar). Taken together, TGZ specifically induces Egr-1, and the induced Egr-1 can bind to the Egr-1 consensus sequence as assessed by EMSA. The transactivation activity of Egr-1 in TGZ-treated HCT-116 cells was determined using an Egr-1-responsive reporter. The plasmid pEBS14luc contained four copies of Egr-1 response elements linked to the basal promoter followed by a luciferase reporter gene (Fig.4 A) (35Cibelli G. Policastro V. Rossler O.G. Thiel G. J. Neurosci. Res. 2002; 67: 450-460Google Scholar). To determine whether the expression of Egr-1, Egr-2, and Egr-3 proteins could activate the luciferase reporter, the plasmid pEBS14luc was transfected into HCT-116 cells, in combination with empty, Egr-1, Egr-2, or Egr-3 expression vectors. As shown in Fig. 4 B, the luciferase activity was increased by overexpression of Egr-1, Egr-2, and Egr-3 compared with vector-transfected cells, suggesting that overexpression of Egr family proteins is able to bind and transactivate the reporter vector. Subsequently, to determine whether TGZ induced Egr-1 expression would also transactivate the reporter vector containing Egr-1 binding sites, we transfected the reporter vector and treated with varying concentrations of TGZ. Indeed, TGZ induced luciferase activity in a concentration-dependent manner, with 4- and 12-fold induction observed with 10 and 20 μm TGZ treatment, respectively. Because TGZ is a PPARγ ligand, we tested whether other PPARγ ligands would also induce luciferase activity. We examined BRL, PGJ2, and PAF, which have been known to bind to PPARγ. TGZ is the strongest Egr-1 inducer of luciferase activity (Fig.4 D), although the other compounds are better PPARγ ligands in terms of PPARγ binding activity. However, in this system, 10 μm TGZ is required to see any significant luciferase induction, compared with 5 μm TGZ being used for Western and Northern analyses. This system is an artificial construct and may require higher concentration of TGZ to see effects. Taken together with previous results, these data demonstrate that TGZ not only induces Egr-1 expression and binding activity but also transactivates Egr-1 responsive genes. We performed nuclear run-on experiments to examine whether the Egr-1 induction by TGZ is regulated at a transcriptional level. HCT-116 cells were treated with serum-free medium for 24 h followed by treatment with TGZ or vehicle for 3 h. Radioactive-labeled nascent transcripts were analyzed by hybridization to immobilized DNAs. Egr-1 gene transcription at 3 h after TGZ treatment was increased 2-fold, as determined by triplicate independent experiments. The gene for Sp1 transcription factor was used as an internal control, because Sp1 expression is not altered by TGZ treatment in HCT-116 cells (data not shown). Thus, Egr-1 transcripts were induced by TGZ at the transcriptional level. Fig.5 A is a representative autoradiogram of three experiments. To confirm whether TGZ induces Egr-1 at the transcription level, the Egr-1 promoter was cloned into the luciferase reporter gene. A plasmid, pEgr1260/LUC, was transfected into HCT-116 cells, and several PPARγ ligands were treated. As shown in Fig. 5 B, TGZ enhances Egr-1 promoter activity 2-fold, whereas the other PPARγ ligands do not enhance promoter activity significantly. Taken together with the nuclear run-on experiments, these results suggest that TGZ induces Egr-1 expression at the transcription level by at least 2-fold. However, these data do not fully explain the dramatic induction shown in Western analysis (Fig.2), indicating that TGZ may be involved with other mechanisms of Egr-1 induction. Because TGZ affects minimum induction at the Egr-1 promoter, and Egr-1 proteins were dramatically induced in HCT-116 cells, it is possible that TGZ may increase Egr-1 mRNA stability. HCT-116 cells were treated with either TGZ or vehicle for 2 h and then 5 μg/ml of actinomycin D was added at the indicated time points. Fig.6, A and Bdemonstrates that the half-life of Egr-1 mRNA in control HCT-116 cells was ∼15 min compared with 48 min in TGZ-treated cells. These results suggest that an increase in stability of Egr-1 mRNA is also a major factor in the induction of Egr-1 proteins by TGZ. Therefore, TGZ-induced Egr-1 promoter activity and increased Egr-1 mRNA stability may explain the dramatic induction of Egr-1 at the protein level. TGZ activates ERK1/2 activity in smooth muscle cells (19Takeda K. Ichiki T. Tokunou T. Iino N. Takeshita A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 48950-48955Google Scholar), and the activated ERK pathway induces Egr-1 activity (36Sakaue M. Adachi H. Dawson M. Jetten A.M. Cell Death Differ. 2001; 8: 411-424Google Scholar, 37Kaufmann K. Bach K. Thiel G. Biol. Chem. 2001; 382: 1077-1081Google Scholar). In addition, ERK phosphorylates PPARγ, which results in the inactivation of PPARγ activity (38Reginato M.J. Krakow S.L. Bailey S.T. Lazar M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 1855-1858Google Scholar, 39Hu E."

While investigating the role of Src kinases in SCF signaling, we found that PP1 completely abrogated the proliferation of M07e cells in response to SCF. PP1 inhibited SCF-induced c-Kit autophosphorylation in intact cells and blocked the activation of mitogen-activated protein kinase and Akt. In vitro kinase assays using immunoprecipitated c-Kit confirmed direct inhibition by PP1. SCF-induced c-Kit phosphorylation was also inhibited by the related inhibitor 4-amino-5- (4-chlorophenyl)-7-(t-butyl)pyrazolo[3,4-d]-pyrimidine (PP2) and by STI571 but not by the Src inhibitor SU6656. PP1 inhibited the activity of mutant constitutively active forms of c-Kit (D814V and D814Y) found in mast cell disorders, and triggered apoptosis in the rat basophilic leukemia cell line RBL-2H3 that expresses mutant c-Kit. In addition, PP1 (and PP2) inhibited the in vitrokinase activity and autophosphorylation in whole cells of p210 Bcr-Abl. PP1 reduced the constitutive activation of signal transducer and activators of transcription 5 and mitogen-activated protein kinase and triggered apoptosis in FDCP1 cells expressing Bcr-Abl. These results have implications for the use of PP1 in investigating intracellular signaling and suggest that PP1 or related compounds may be useful in the treatment of malignant diseases associated with dysregulated c-Kit or Abl tyrosine kinase activity. 4-Amino-5-(4-methylphenyl)-7-(t-butyl)pyrazolo[3,4-d]- pyrimidine (PP1) was identified as an Src-selective tyrosine kinase inhibitor and has been used extensively to investigate signaling pathways involving Src kinases, including events downstream of the stem cell factor (SCF) receptor c-Kit.

Genes Dev. 1989; 3: 816-826Crossref PubMed Scopus (386) Google Scholar). c-Kit has been implicated in tumor cell development, including mast cell disorders, (12Valent P. Escribano L. Parwaresch R.M.

In some instances, this is because of activating mutations in c-Kit (e.g. in mastocytosis, acute myeloid leukemia, and gastrointestinal stromal tumors) (17Boissan M. Feger F. Guillosson J.J. Arock M. J. Leukoc. Biol. 2000; 67: 135-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar); in others, the receptor is wild type but there is associated autocrine production of SCF (16Krystal G.W. Hines S.J. Organ C.P. Cancer Res. 1996; 56: 370-376PubMed Google Scholar). The development of inhibitors of c-Kit-mediated signals would be useful to investigate the role of c-Kit in maintaining these tumors and could provide the basis for a potential therapeutic agent. In this study, we have examined the effects of PP1 on signaling via c-Kit. We find that PP1 and the related compound PP2 block SCF-induced proliferation and activation of the ERK mitogen-activated protein kinase and Akt. This is associated with an inhibition of c-Kit autophosphorylation both in intact cells and in in vitro kinase assays. PP1 decreases the activity of constitutively active c-Kit and triggers the apoptosis of mast cell leukemia cells expressing this mutant. PP1 also inhibits Bcr-Abl kinase activity and triggers apoptosis in Bcr-Abl-dependent cells. These results have implications for the use of PP1 and related compounds in the experimental investigation of cell signaling pathways and suggest that this family of molecules may be useful in the development of treatment for diseases with abnormal c-Kit signaling. The RBL-2H3 cell line (18Morita Y. Siraganian R.P. J. Immunol. 1981; 127: 1339-1344PubMed Google Scholar) (kindly supplied by S. Cockcroft, Dept. of Physiology, University College, London, UK) was maintained in Earle's minimal essential medium supplemented with 10% (v/v) heat-inactivated fetal calf serum (FCS). M07e cells (originally described by Avanzi et al. (19Avanzi G.C. Lista P. Giovinazzo B. Miniero R. Saglio G. Benetton G. Coda R. Cattoretti G. Pegoraro L. Br. J Haematol. 1988; 69: 359-366Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar)) were maintained in RPMI 1640 medium with 10% (v/v) FCS, supplemented with 20 ng/ml recombinant human GM-CSF and 20 ng/ml human IL-3 (Sandoz, Frimley Park, UK). FDCP1 cells expressing p210 Bcr-Abl were generated as described previously (20Cambier N. Chopra R. Strasser A. Metcalf D. Elefanty A.G. Oncogene. 1998; 16: 335-348Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar) and were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% FCS without additional growth factors. PP1 was from Affiniti (Exeter, UK), whereas PP2 and the inactive PP3 were from Calbiochem-Novabiochem Biosciences. Human SCF and thrombopoietin (Tpo) were from PeproTech EC Ltd. (London, UK), andEscherichia coli-derived recombinant human GM-CSF was from Behringwerke-Hoechst (Marburg, Germany). After overnight growth factor withdrawal in RPMI 1640 medium with 10% FCS, M07e cells were plated at 3 × 105/ml in 12-well plates, and inhibitors were added. After 60 min of incubation, growth factors were added. Cells were then incubated at 37 °C, 5% CO2 for up to 72 h. Cell proliferation was measured using an MTS assay (CellTiter 96;Promega). The assay was performed according to manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, at specified time points, 100 μl of sample was added to 20 μl of MTS reagent in a 96-well plate and incubated at 37 °C for 2 h. Absorbance at 490 nm was measured using a 96-well plate reader. All measurements were performed in triplicate. RBL-2H3 cells were plated at 1 × 105/ml in 12-well plates in Earle's minimal essential medium with 10% FCS and allowed to adhere before addition of inhibitors. Subsequently, cells were removed from wells at 24-h intervals using trypsin/EDTA (5 min at 37 °C, 5% CO2) and pelleted by centrifugation. Fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated Annexin-V (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) was used according to the manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, cells were incubated at room temperature for 5 min in Annexin-V binding buffer (140 mm NaCl2 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 5 mm CaCl2) with 40 μg/ml propidium iodide (Sigma-Aldrich) and 10 μl/ml Annexin-V-fluorescein isothiocyanate. Samples were then placed on ice and immediately analyzed for Annexin-V binding and propidium iodide uptake by flow cytometry (Epics Elite; Beckman Coulter). Murine c-Kit cDNA in pUC19 was cloned into the pCDNA3.1 vector and site-directed mutagenesis (Stratagene QuikChange kit) was used to generate D814V and D814Y mutants. Human embryonic kidney 293T cells were transfected by the calcium phosphate method using a Promega kit according to the manufacturer's instructions. Cells were transfected on 10-cm dishes with the respective constructs and replated into 6-well plates 24 h later. Incubation with PP1 at the indicated concentrations for 2 h was carried out 48 h after initial transfection, and cells were lysed as detailed below. Immunoprecipitation with goat anti-c-Kit antibody (Santa Cruz) was for 4 h; the last hour included protein G-Sepharose (Sigma). Cells were incubated overnight in the absence of growth factor before resuspension at 4 × 106/ml in PBS with 5 mm glucose. The indicated concentrations of inhibitor were added, and cells were incubated for 60 min at 37 °C. M07e were then stimulated with 20 ng/ml human SCF for 10 min at 37 °C. Cells were pelleted by centrifugation and lysed in lysis buffer (50 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 2 mm EDTA, 20 mm NaF, 1 mm NaVO4, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 μg/ml pepstatin, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 mm Pefabloc, and 5 μm microcystin) for 10 min at 4 °C. Lysates were cleared of nuclear debris (centrifuged at 14,000 rpm for 5 min at 4 °C), added to sample buffer, and boiled for 5 min. Equal volumes of sample were resolved using SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes (Hybond-C extra; Amersham Biosciences). Activated proteins were detected using phosphospecific primary antibodies. The monoclonal anti-phosphotyrosine antibody 4G10 was from Upstate Biotechnology, and polyclonal antibodies raised against phosphorylated (active) ERK1&2 (T202/Y204), Akt (S473), and STAT5 (Y694) were from New England Biolabs, as was the Akt antibody. Polyclonal ERK2, c-Kit, and monoclonal Abl antibodies were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Peroxidase conjugated secondary antibodies were from Amersham Biosciences. Phosphorylation was quantified using NIH Image software. M07e cells taken from culture were lysed at 40 × 106/ml as described above, and c-Kit was immunoprecipitated by incubation overnight at 4 °C with 2 μg/ml polyclonal antibody. c-Kit receptor-antibody complexes were captured by protein-G Agarose (incubated at 4 °C for 2 h), and immunoprecipitates were washed at 4 °C three times in phosphate-buffered saline, 0.1% Triton X-100, and 2 mmEDTA and twice in kinase buffer (20 mm HEPES, 20 mm PIPES) pH 7.4, and 10 mm MnCl2before resuspension in 25 μl of kinase buffer containing varying concentrations of PP1 or other inhibitors. After a 30-min incubation at 37 °C, a further 25-μl kinase buffer (in which PP1 concentrations were maintained) containing 100 μm ATP and 10 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP was added, and samples were incubated for 10 min at 30 °C. Reactions were terminated by the addition of 1 ml of kinase buffer at 4 °C and washed rapidly. c-Kit was eluted with the addition of sample buffer, and samples were resolved by SDS-PAGE. Bcr-Abl was immunoprecipitated from either 293T cells expressing MSCV-p210Bcr-Abl (kind gift of R. Van Etten, Boston, MA) or Bcr-Abl-FDCP1 cells and processed as for c-Kit kinase assays. Abl kinase assay was carried out in kinase buffer (20 mm HEPES, 20 mm PIPES), pH 7.4, 10 mm MnCl2, 10 mm MgCl2 and 10 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP supplemented with 4 μg GST-Crk as substrate. Phosphorylation of GST-Crk and c-Kit was detected using autoradiography and quantified using NIH Image software. SCF and GM-CSF, Tpo, and IL-3 stimulate proliferation of the human myeloid factor-dependent cell line M07e. It has previously been shown that of the Src family of tyrosine kinases, Lyn is present in M07e cells and that activation of this kinase can be detected after SCF stimulation (3Linnekin D. DeBerry C.S. Mou S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 27450-27455Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar, 21Price D.J. Rivnay B. Avraham H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 259: 611-616Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). To investigate the potential role of Src family kinases in the SCF-induced proliferation of M07e cells, we used PP1, a selective inhibitor of Src kinases. M07e cells became quiescent without undergoing apoptosis after 24 h of factor withdrawal and remained so for 48–72 h in growth factor-free conditions (data not shown). Proliferation was measured using the colorimetric MTS assay over a 72-h period after factor re-addition. Fig. 1 A shows that PP1 inhibited SCF-induced proliferation in a dose-dependent manner (IC50, 0.5–1 μm), whereas 2.5 μm PP1 completely prevented SCF-induced proliferation. PP2 had a similar effect (IC50, ∼1 μm), whereas the inactive analogue PP3 had no significant effect on proliferation (Fig. 1 B). In contrast, PP1 had only a minor effect on thrombopoietin-induced proliferation of M07e cells (Fig. 1 C), indicating that the effects of PP1 on SCF-stimulated proliferation were not caused by nonspecific toxicity. These effects of PP1 suggested a very significant role for Src family kinases in SCF-induced biological responses. However, these results could potentially come about from the direct inhibition of c-Kit by PP1 and not exclusively from inhibition of Src kinases. To investigate this possibility, M07e were incubated with or without PP1, stimulated with SCF, and cell extracts were assessed by immunoblotting with an anti-phosphotyrosine antibody. Fig. 2 A shows that c-Kit autophosphorylation was inhibited in a dose-dependent manner by PP1 and completely blocked at a concentration of 1 μm PP1. These results suggested that PP1 could be inhibiting c-Kit kinase activity. To examine this further, unstimulated M07e were lysed and c-Kit immunoprecipitated, and in vitro autophosphorylation kinase assays were performed in the absence or presence of different PP1 concentrations. Fig. 2 B shows that PP1 (and PP2) directly inhibit c-Kit kinase activity in vitro in a dose-dependent manner (PP1 IC50, ∼75 nm). To further exclude the possibility that the effects of PP1 on c-Kit autophosphorylation were dependent on Src kinases, we used the unrelated Src inhibitor SU6656 (22Blake R.A. Broome M.A. Liu X. Wu J. Gishizky M. Sun L. Courtneidge S.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 9018-9027Crossref PubMed Scopus (532) Google Scholar, 23Bowman T. Broome M.A. Sinibaldi D. Wharton W. Pledger W.J. Sedivy J.M. Irby R. Yeatman T. Courtneidge S.A. Jove R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 7319-7324Crossref PubMed Scopus (412) Google Scholar). This inhibits Src family kinases with IC50 values in the nanomolar range, with an IC50 for lyn kinase of 130 nm. Inhibition by SU6656 of lyn kinase activity was confirmed in an in vitrokinase assay using immunoprecipitated lyn from MO7e cells with complete inhibition of autophosphorylation at 1 μm inhibitor (data not shown). SU6656 failed to inhibit c-Kit in an in vitrokinase assay, whereas imatinib mesylate/STI571 (24Buchdunger E. Cioffi C.L. Law N. Stover D. Ohno-Jones S. Druker B.J. Lydon N.B. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 2000; 295: 139-145PubMed Google Scholar, 25Heinrich M.C. Griffith D.J. Druker B.J. Wait C.L. Ott K.A. Zigler A.J. Blood. 2000; 96: 925-932Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) was able to reduce activity (Fig. 2 C). Fig. 3 A shows that SU6656 is unable to inhibit c-Kit autophosphorylation in whole cells even at concentrations of up to 10 μm. Preincubation with PP1 and STI571, but not SU6656, was also able to inhibit the activation of Akt and ERK1/2 in response to SCF (Fig. 3 B). Inhibition of Akt and extracellular signal-regulated kinase activation was nearly complete at concentrations between 1 and 2.5 μm PP1. In contrast, PP1 at 20 μm did not affect the tyrosine phosphorylation of STAT5 in response to GM-CSF (Fig. 3 C), in keeping with its reported lack of activity against Jak family kinases. Several kinase inhibitors, including STI571 and SU9529, have been reported to potently inhibit the activity of wild-type c-Kit but to have low or no activity against enzymatic site point mutants (D814V and D814Y in murine or D816V and D816Y in human numbering) (26Ma Y. Carter E. Wang X. Shu C. McMahon G. Longley B.J. J. Invest. Dermatol. 2000; 114: 392-394Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 27Ma Y. Zeng S. Metcalfe D.D. Akin C. Dimitrijevic S. Butterfield J.H. McMahon G. Longley B.J. Blood. 2002; 99: 1741-1744Crossref PubMed Scopus (414) Google Scholar). We investigated the effects of PP1 on wild-type and activated kit mutants by transfection of 293 cells. Incubation of cells expressing wild-type kit with PP1 confirmed the inhibition of SCF-induced kinase activity (Fig. 4 A) with complete block at 0.2 μm PP1. PP1 potently inhibited the basal kit autophosphorylation in whole-cell assays of the D814V mutant (IC50, ∼1 μm) and the D814Y mutant (IC50, ∼0.2 μm) and markedly reduced the phosphorylation of multiple intracellular substrates at these concentrations (Fig. 4 B). These results indicate that PP1 has significant activity against both wild-type c-Kit and enzymatic site point mutants found in mast cell disorders. RBL-2H3 cells are a factor independent, rat basophilic leukemia cell line with a point mutation in c-Kit (D817Y), which renders it constitutively active (28Tsujimura T. Furitsu T. Morimoto M. Kanayama Y. Nomura S. Matsuzawa Y. Kitamura Y. Kanakura Y. Int. Arch. Allergy Appl. Immunol. 1995; 106: 377-385Crossref Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Cells in complete medium were incubated with increasing concentrations of PP1 and apoptosis was measured by annexin-V-fluorescein isothiocyanate binding using flow cytometry (Fig. 4 C). Incubation with PP1 triggered apoptosis in these cells. PP2 had similar effects, whereas the inactive analogue PP3 had no effect on cell viability (data not shown). The kinase inhibitor imatinib mesylate/STI571, currently being employed in the treatment of chronic myelogenous leukemia, blocks the activity of Abl, Bcr-Abl, and c-Kit tyrosine kinases (25Heinrich M.C. Griffith D.J. Druker B.J. Wait C.L. Ott K.A. Zigler A.J. Blood. 2000; 96: 925-932Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Having detected the unexpected effects of PP1 on c-Kit, we investigated whether it could also inhibit Bcr-Abl kinase activity. FDCP1 cells were transfected with p210 Bcr-Abl and clonal stable cell lines isolated by standard techniques. Parental FDCP1 cells are normally dependent on IL-3, but the p210 Bcr-Abl/FDCP1 cells are factor-independent for survival and proliferation and can be cultured without IL-3 (20Cambier N. Chopra R. Strasser A. Metcalf D. Elefanty A.G. Oncogene. 1998; 16: 335-348Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Fig. 5 shows that incubation of p210 Bcr-Abl/FDCP1 with PP1 led to a dose-dependent reduction in Bcr-Abl autophosphorylation (Fig. 5 A) and inhibited the activation of STAT5 and ERK1&2 (Fig. 5 B). PP1 and PP2 directly inhibited Bcr-Abl kinase activity in an in vitro assay (Fig. 5 C) with an IC50 for PP1 of ∼1 μm. A decrease in the number of viable cells as measured by an MTS assay (IC50, ∼3 μm) (Fig. 5 D) was also observed upon incubation of p210 Bcr-Abl/FDCP1 cells with PP1. Assessment of cell survival by flow cytometric assay of annexin-V binding showed that this was caused by rapid apoptosis (Fig. 5 E). In contrast, survival of parental cells incubated with PP1 (in the presence of IL-3) was unaffected (data not shown). PP1 was originally described as a selective, ATP-competitive inhibitor of Src family kinases (1Hanke J.H. Gardner J.P. Dow R.L. Changelian P.S. Brissette W.H. Weringer E.J. Pollok B.A. Connelly P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 695-701Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1790) Google Scholar) and has been widely used to investigate the contribution of Src kinases to a number of biological functions. In vitro kinase assays carried out by Hankeet al. (1Hanke J.H. Gardner J.P. Dow R.L. Changelian P.S. Brissette W.H. Weringer E.J. Pollok B.A. Connelly P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 695-701Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1790) Google Scholar) showed that Src family kinases were inhibited at low nanomolar concentrations and that Zap-70 and Jak-2 were not inhibited at concentrations up to 50 μm. Biological effects on intact T-cell function were seen with an IC50 around 0.5 μm—this higher concentration requirement may be caused by high intracellular levels of ATP compared with the low concentrations used in in vitro kinase assays. Since then, Waltenberger and colleagues (29Waltenberger J. Uecker A. Kroll J. Frank H. Mayr U. Bjorge J.D. Fujita D. Gazit A. Hombach V. Levitzki A. Bohmer F.D. Circ. Res. 1999; 85: 12-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar) have shown that PP1 can also directly inhibit the platelet-derived growth factor-β receptor tyrosine kinase with an in vitro IC50 of 0.1 μm and an IC50 in intact cells of 0.6 μm; more recently, Carlomagno et al. have shown inhibition of Ret tyrosine kinase by PP1 (30Carlomagno F. Vitagliano D. Guida T. Napolitano M. Vecchio G. Fusco A. Gazit A. Levitzki A. Santoro M. Cancer Res. 2002; 62: 1077-1082PubMed Google Scholar). In this study, we investigated the effect of PP1 on signaling via the SCF receptor c-Kit. We found that PP1 abrogated the proliferative effects of SCF on M07e cells and that this was associated with blockade of downstream signaling pathways, including mitogen-activated protein kinase and Akt, and of receptor autophosphorylation. c-Kit autophosphorylation in intact cells was blocked with an IC50 of ∼100 nm. In vitro kinase assays done with immunoprecipitated c-Kit and incubated with PP1 gave an IC50 of ∼75 nm. This indicates that PP1 is a direct inhibitor of c-Kit. Bondzi and colleagues (31Bondzi C. Litz J. Dent P. Krystal G.W. Cell Growth Differ. 2000; 11: 305-314PubMed Google Scholar) have also shown that PP1, at a single concentration of 10 μm, could inhibit the in vitro kinase activity of c-Kit. We found that the closely related inhibitor PP2 is also an inhibitor of c-Kit. Src kinases have been postulated to play a significant role in signaling downstream from c-Kit; these conclusions have partly relied on the effects of PP1 and PP2 (3Linnekin D. DeBerry C.S. Mou S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 27450-27455Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar, 4Broudy V.C. Lin N.L. Liles W.C. Corey S.J. O'Laughlin B. Mou S. Linnekin D.

J. 1999; 342: 163-170Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) Our data suggest that, as with most inhibitor studies, corroborating evidence using other experimental techniques should be obtained where possible. c-Kit plays a significant role in the pathophysiology of a number of human malignancies. Mutations have been identified in mast cell disorders, gastrointestinal stromal tumors, and acute myeloid leukemia, among others (13Hirota S. Isozaki K. Moriyama Y. Hashimoto K. Nishida T. Ishiguro S. Kawano K. Hanada M. Kurata A. Takeda M. Muhammad Tunio G. Matsuzawa Y. Kanakura Y. Shinomura Y. Kitamura Y.

A. 1999; 96: 1609-1614Crossref PubMed Scopus (497) Google Scholar). These mutations take a number of forms; the majority have been shown to confer constitutive activation. The best characterized mutation is in the kinase domain at aspartate 816 (human numbering) (34Furitsu T. Tsujimura T. Tono T. Ikeda H. Kitayama H. Koshimizu U. Sugahara H. Butterfield J.H. Ashman L.K. Kanayama Y. Matsuzawa Y. Kanakura Y. J. Clin. Invest. 1993; 92: 1736-1744Crossref PubMed Scopus (743) Google Scholar, 35Nagata H. Okada T. Worobec A.S. Semere T. Metcalfe D.D. Int. Arch. Allergy Appl. Immunol. 1997; 113: 184-186Crossref Scopus (71) Google Scholar); in a recent series, this mutation was identified in all cases of adult sporadic cutaneous mastocytosis and in a significant proportion of pediatric cases (36Buttner C. Henz B.M. Welker P. Sepp N.T. Grabbe J. J Investig. Dermatol. 1998; 111: 1227-1231Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). In addition, many tumor types, including ovarian, lung, and breast malignancies, express both c-Kit and SCF, indicating the possibility of autocrine growth stimulation (16Krystal G.W. Hines S.J. Organ C.P. Cancer Res. 1996; 56: 370-376PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, there has been interest in developing kinase inhibitors that target c-Kit to increase the treatment options for patients with c-Kit abnormalities. Investigation of a number of indolinone compounds showed that several could inhibit wild type c-Kit but were generally inefficient at inhibiting the kinase activity of c-Kit with a mutation in the kinase domain (814 murine, 816 human, 817 rat); only SU6577 was effective at the high concentration of 40 μm (26Ma Y. Carter E. Wang X. Shu C. McMahon G. Longley B.J. J. Invest. Dermatol. 2000; 114: 392-394Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). The Abl-selective tyrosine kinase inhibitor STI571 can inhibit wild-type c-Kit with an IC50 around 0.1 μm (24Buchdunger E. Cioffi C.L. Law N. Stover D. Ohno-Jones S. Druker B.J. Lydon N.B. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 2000; 295: 139-145PubMed Google Scholar) but has been reported not to inhibit the activity of 814/816 mutant c-Kit at concentrations up to 10 μm (27Ma Y. Zeng S. Metcalfe D.D. Akin C. Dimitrijevic S. Butterfield J.H. McMahon G. Longley B.J. Blood. 2002; 99: 1741-1744Crossref PubMed Scopus (414) Google Scholar). We found that PP1 could potently inhibit the activation of D816V and D816Y mutant forms of c-Kit. PP1 triggered apoptosis in rat basophilic leukemia cells with the homologous D817Y mutation. These results indicate that further investigation of the effects of PP1 and related compounds on primary mastocytosis cells expressing the human counterpart of this mutation are required. The inhibitory effects of PP1 on additional kinases, such as Src, Abl, and the platelet-derived growth factor receptor have the potential to increase the toxic effects of PP1 on normal cells. Our data show a relative lack of effect of PP1 on thrombopoietin-induced proliferation, but this area requires further study with other growth factors and cell types. Using PP1 as a starting point, it may be possible to refine the development of an inhibitor that is more selective for c-Kit and its mutants. We have also identified PP1 (and PP2) as direct inhibitors of the Bcr-Abl kinase. Inhibition of Bcr-Abl autophosphorylation was seen in intact cells with an IC50 of ∼1 μm, and apoptosis was induced in Bcr-Abl-transformed cells with an IC50 of ∼2 μm. This compares with biological effects of STI571 on Bcr-Abl-transformed cell lines that are seen at concentrations between 0.1 and 0.5 μm. STI571 is being investigated widely for its effects on Bcr-Abl in chronic myelogenous leukemia and acute lymphoblastic leukemia, its effects on c-Kit in a number of disorders, including mast cell neoplasms, and its effects on the platelet-derived growth factor receptor in malignant glioblastomas (37Kilic T. Alberta J.A. Zdunek P.R. Acar M. Iannarelli P. O'Reilly T. Buchdunger E. Black P.M. Stiles C.D. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 5143-5150PubMed Google Scholar). It is interesting that PP1 is also able to inhibit each of these kinases. Resistance to STI571 may result from a number of factors, such as overexpression of Bcr-Abl (38Mahon F.X. Deininger M.W.

This indicates that although PP1 shows some selectivity, it can inhibit a significant number of tyrosine kinases. In our study we found that PP2 also inhibits c-Kit and Bcr-Abl; it is likely that this compound has an inhibitory profile similar to that of PP1. Recent articles have shed some light on the structural basis of PP1 inhibition of Src kinases. A single residue, corresponding to threonine 338 in c-Src, largely controls the ability of PP1 to inhibit protein kinases with high potency (43Liu Y. Bishop A. Witucki L. Kraybill B. Shimizu E. Tsien J. Ubersax J. Blethrow J. Morgan D.O. Shokat K.M. Chem. Biol. 1999; 6: 671-678Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). Mutation of this residue to, or the natural occurrence of, a larger amino acid (e.g. methionine or phenylalanine) is sufficient to confer resistance to PP1. The corresponding residue in the PP1-sensitive kinases platelet-derived growth factor receptor, c-Kit, and c-Abl is a threonine but in both Jak2 and Zap-70 is a methionine, which have both been shown to be resistant to PP1. In conclusion, we have shown that, at concentrations routinely used by investigators to study the role of Src kinases in cell function, the Src-selective inhibitors PP1 and PP2 are also potent inhibitors of the c-Kit and the Bcr-Abl tyrosine kinases. In addition, PP1 is able to inhibit the activity of mutant forms of kit commonly found in mast cell disorders. These results have implications for the use of PP1 and PP2 for the investigation of intracellular signaling pathways and biological function and also indicate a potential role for PP1 or related compounds in the treatment of human disease."
https://openalex.org/W2003870055,"The receptor protein-tyrosine phosphatase (PTP) DEP-1 (CD148/PTP-η) has been implicated in the regulation of cell growth, differentiation, and transformation, and most recently has been identified as a potential tumor suppressor gene mutated in colon, lung, and breast cancers. We have generated constructs comprising the cytoplasmic segment of DEP-1 fused to the maltose-binding protein to identify potential substrates and thereby suggest a physiological function for DEP-1. We have shown that the substrate-trapping mutant form of DEP-1 interacted with a small subset of tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins from lysates of the human breast tumor cell lines MDA-MB-231, T-47D, and T-47D/Met and have identified the hepatocyte growth factor/scatter factor receptor Met, the adapter protein Gab1, and the junctional component p120 catenin as potential substrates. Following ligand stimulation, phosphorylation of specific tyrosyl residues in Met induces mitogenic, motogenic, and morphogenic responses. When co-expressed in 293 cells, the full-length substrate-trapping mutant form of DEP-1 formed a stable complex with the chimeric receptor colony stimulating factor 1 (CSF)-Met and wild type DEP-1 dephosphorylated CSF-Met. Furthermore, we observed that DEP-1 preferentially dephosphorylated a Gab1 binding site (Tyr1349) and a COOH-terminal tyrosine implicated in morphogenesis (Tyr1365), whereas tyrosine residues in the activation loop of Met (Tyr1230, Tyr1234, and Tyr1235) were not preferred targets of the PTP. The ability of DEP-1 preferentially to dephosphorylate particular tyrosine residues that are required for Met-induced signaling suggests that DEP-1 may function in controlling the specificity of signals induced by this PTK, rather than as a simple “off-switch” to counteract PTK activity.

A variety of ligands trigger the reversible phosphorylation of tyrosyl residues in cellular proteins, a process that underlies the control of such fundamental cellular functions as growth and proliferation, migration, and morphogenesis. Tyrosine phosphorylation is regulated by the coordinated action of protein-tyrosine kinases (PTKs) 1The abbreviations used are: PTK, protein-tyrosine kinases; PTP, protein-tyrosine phosphatases; HGF/SF, hepatocyte growth factor/scatter factor; CSF-1R, colony-stimulating factor 1 receptor; MBP, maltose-binding protein; PLC-γ, phospholipase Cγ 1The abbreviations used are: PTK, protein-tyrosine kinases; PTP, protein-tyrosine phosphatases; HGF/SF, hepatocyte growth factor/scatter factor; CSF-1R, colony-stimulating factor 1 receptor; MBP, maltose-binding protein; PLC-γ, phospholipase Cγ and protein-tyrosine phosphatases (PTPs). Classically it was thought that the PTKs provided the “on-switch” to initiate a physiological response, whereas the PTPs functioned to counteract the PTKs and to return the system to its basal state. However, it was soon shown that PTPs may themselves function positively to promote signaling, for example, by promoting the dephosphorylation and activation of PTKs, thus coordinating with, rather than antagonizing PTK function (reviewed in Ref. 1Hermiston M.L. Xu Z. Majeti R. Weiss A. J. Clin. Invest. 2002; 109: 9-14Google Scholar). A further level of complexity has been introduced with the realization that whether a defined PTP functions positively or negatively may depend upon the signaling context. Thus, SHP-2 is an activator of signaling through the HGF/SF receptor Met (2Maroun C.R. Naujokas M.A. Holgado-Madruga M. Wong A.J. Park M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 8513-8525Google Scholar) and the epidermal growth factor receptor (3Bennett A.M. Hausdorff S.F. O'Reilly A.M. Freeman R.M. Neel B.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 1189-1202Google Scholar), but is an inhibitor of signaling through the platelet-derived growth factor receptor (4Meng T.C. Fukada T. Tonks N.K. Mol. Cell. 2002; 9: 387-399Google Scholar). Following ligand binding, a receptor PTK may become phosphorylated on multiple tyrosine residues, which serve as docking sites for distinct signaling proteins. The spectrum of such signaling molecules that associate with the PTK will determine the nature of the response that is initiated following ligand stimulation. The possibility exists, therefore, that a PTP may dephosphorylate a particular site in a receptor PTK and thereby determine the signaling outcome of a particular stimulus. Thus, dephosphorylation of receptor PTKs by members of the PTP family may function as a mechanism for regulating the specificity of a signaling event rather than simply as an “off-switch.” DEP-1 is a receptor PTP whose expression is enhanced as cells approach confluence (5Ostman A. Yang Q. Tonks N.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 9680-9684Google Scholar). Initially cloned from human cDNA libraries (5Ostman A. Yang Q. Tonks N.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Blood. 1994; 84: 4186-4194Google Scholar), DEP-1 homologues were subsequently identified in rat and mouse (7Kuramochi S. Matsuda S. Matsuda Y. Saitoh T. Ohsugi M. Yamamoto T.

Res. 1996; 79: 570-580Google Scholar). DEP-1 comprises an extracellular segment of eight fibronectin type III repeats, a transmembrane domain, and a single cytoplasmic PTP domain. Also known as PTP-η (6Honda H. Inazawa J. Nishida J. Yazaki Y. Hirai H. Blood. 1994; 84: 4186-4194Google Scholar) and CD148 (9Palou E. de la Fuente-Garcia M.A. Nicolas J.M. Vilardell C. Vives J.

Immunol. 1998; 161: 3249-3255Google Scholar), DEP-1 is expressed in a variety of tissues and cell types. There is a growing body of evidence suggesting a role for DEP-1 in the inhibition of cell growth. After vascular injury DEP-1 expression is down-regulated in migrating and proliferating rat endothelial cells (8Borges L.G. Seifert R.A. Grant F.J. Hart C.E. Disteche C.M. Edelhoff S. Solca F.F. Lieberman M.A. Lindner V. Fischer E.H. Lok S. Bowen-Pope D.F. Circ. Res. 1996; 79: 570-580Google Scholar). Attempts have been made to express DEP-1 constitutively in breast cells and macrophages (11Keane M.M. Lowrey G.A. Ettenberg S.A. Dayton M.A. Lipkowitz S. Cancer Res. 1996; 56: 4236-4243Google Scholar, 12Osborne J.M. den Elzen N. Lichanska A.M. Costelloe E.O. Yamada T. Cassady A.I. Hume D.A. J. Leukocyte Biol. 1998; 64: 692-701Google Scholar), however, this inhibited development of stable cell lines, further reinforcing a role for DEP-1 in growth inhibition. In addition to its role in growth inhibition, DEP-1 has also been implicated in differentiation. The levels of DEP-1 mRNA are increased in various cell lines in response to factors that lead to differentiation (8Borges L.G. Seifert R.A. Grant F.J. Hart C.E. Disteche C.M. Edelhoff S. Solca F.F.

Fusco A. Schettini G. Endocrinology. 1997; 138: 3756-3763Google Scholar). Re-introduction of DEP-1 into the transformed cells leads to reduced growth rates, stabilization of the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p27, and partial re-acquisition of a differentiated phenotype (16Trapasso F. Iuliano R. Boccia A. Stella A. Visconti R. Bruni P. Baldassarre G. Santoro M. Viglietto G. Fusco A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 9236-9246Google Scholar). Loss of DEP-1 expression has also been observed in human thyroid tumors (16Trapasso F. Iuliano R. Boccia A. Stella A. Visconti R. Bruni P. Baldassarre G. Santoro M. Viglietto G. Fusco A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 9236-9246Google Scholar). Furthermore, the DEP-1 gene Ptprj was identified as a positional candidate for the mouse colon-cancer susceptibility locus Scc1 (17Ruivenkamp C.A. Van Wezel T. Zanon C. Stassen A.P. Vlcek C. Csikos T. Klous A.M. Tripodis N. Perrakis A. Boerrigter L. Groot P.C. Lindeman J. Mooi W.J. Meijjer G.A. Scholten G. Dauwerse H. Paces V. Van Zandwijk N. Van Ommen G.J. Demant P. Nat. Genet. 2002; 31: 295-300Google Scholar). Frequent deletions, loss of heterozygosity, and missense mutations in the human Ptprj gene have also been identified in colon, lung, and breast cancers (17Ruivenkamp C.A. Van Wezel T. Zanon C. Stassen A.P. Vlcek C. Csikos T. Klous A.M. Tripodis N. Perrakis A. Boerrigter L. Groot P.C. Lindeman J. Mooi W.J. Meijjer G.A. Scholten G. Dauwerse H. Paces V. Van Zandwijk N. Van Ommen G.J. Demant P. Nat. Genet. 2002; 31: 295-300Google Scholar). Taken together these data indicate that DEP-1 may be a critical factor in controlling cellular growth and transformation. DEP-1 has recently been shown to localize at cell borders in endothelial cells and its staining pattern overlapped with that of the junctional protein VE-cadherin (18Takahashi T. Takahashi K. Mernaugh R. Drozdoff V. Sipe C. Schoecklmann H. Robert B. Abrahamson D.R. Daniel T.O. J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 1999; 10: 2135-2145Google Scholar). Interestingly, members of the cadherin family of cell-cell adhesion molecules function in the suppression of cell growth and tumor invasion. Junctional components such as β-catenin, however, can also promote cell growth by inducing the transcription of genes involved in proliferation and cancer progression (reviewed in Ref. 19Ben-Ze'ev A. Shtutman M. Zhurinsky J. Exp. Cell Res. 2000; 261: 75-82Google Scholar). The growth inhibitory effects of cadherins may involve binding and sequestration of the signaling pool of the catenins (20Gottardi C.J. Wong E. Gumbiner B.M. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 153: 1049-1060Google Scholar, 21Stockinger A. Eger A. Wolf J. Beug H. Foisner R. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 154: 1185-1196Google Scholar). Reversible tyrosine phosphorylation is an important aspect of the regulation of junctional integrity and the control of signals emanating from these sites (reviewed in Ref. 22Conacci-Sorrell M. Zhurinsky J. Ben-Ze'ev A. J. Clin. Invest. 2002; 109: 987-991Google Scholar). The identification of the PTKs and PTPs that act upon the components of cell junctions will be important for understanding the regulation of cell morphology and the control of gene expression, events that ultimately influence growth and migration. Using an in vitro affinity chromatography system we identified a set of proteins from human breast tumor cell lines (MDA-MB-231, T-47D, and T-47D/Met) that interacted specifically with the substrate-trapping mutant form of DEP-1. These proteins included the junctional component p120 catenin (p120Ctn), the adaptor protein Gab1, and the HGF/SF receptor Met. Met induces mitogenic, motogenic, and morphogenic responses after ligand activation by recruiting a number of signaling and docking molecules and has been implicated in the phosphorylation of cell junction proteins. Disruption of normal signaling through Met has been implicated in certain cancers. Ligand-induced activation of Met by HGF/SF leads to the autophosphorylation of specific tyrosine residues within the PTK. Phosphorylation of Tyr1234 and Tyr1235 in the activation loop of Met is required for kinase activity, whereas phosphorylation of COOH-terminal tyrosine residues (Tyr1349and Tyr1356) is required for the recruitment of signaling and adapter molecules including Gab1 (reviewed in Ref. 23Furge K.A. Zhang Y.W. Vande Woude G.F. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 5582-5589Google Scholar). Additional COOH-terminal tyrosines such as Tyr1365 appear to be important for mediating a morphogenic signal although the identity of proteins that interact with this site is currently unknown (24Weidner K.M. Sachs M. Riethmacher D. Birchmeier W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 2597-2601Google Scholar). We present evidence that DEP-1 preferentially dephosphorylates specific tyrosine residues in the COOH-terminal domain of Met. By selectively dephosphorylating such sites in the kinase, DEP-1 may attenuate particular signaling events emanating from Met thus, potentially, regulating the outcome of cellular responses induced by HGF/SF stimulation. Full-length human DEP-1 cDNA was isolated and subcloned into the mammalian expression vector pMT2 (5Ostman A. Yang Q. Tonks N.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 9680-9684Google Scholar). The nucleotide and amino acid numbers listed below correspond to the human DEP-1 sequence reported previously (5Ostman A. Yang Q. Tonks N.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 9680-9684Google Scholar) (GenBankTM accession number U10886). DEP-1 point mutants (C1239S and D1205A) were generated by overlap extension using pMT2.DEP-1 as template. The resulting mutant PCR products were exchanged with the wild type sequence in pMT2.DEP-1 and sequenced to confirm the mutations. DEP-1 cytoplasmic domain constructs were generated using the pMT2.DEP-1 wild type or point mutant (C1239S and D1205A) constructs as template. A 5′ primer introduced a BamHI site before the DEP-1 cytoplasmic sequence at nucleotide 3338, whereas a 3′ primer added a SalI site after the DEP-1 stop codon. The resulting PCR products (DEP-1 nucleotides 3338–4362) were cloned into theBamHI/SalI sites of the pMAL-c2E vector from New England Biolabs (Beverly, MA) generating wild type and point mutant (C1239S and D1205A) pMAL.DEP-1 constructs. The fusion proteins were expressed in Escherichia coli and purified on amylose resin according to the manufacturer's instructions. The resulting proteins (∼84 kDa) have maltose-binding protein (MBP) fused to the NH2 terminus of the DEP-1 cytoplasmic domain (amino acids 997–1337). The chimeric receptor colony stimulating factor 1 (CSF)-Met comprising the extracellular domain of human CSF-1R and the transmembrane and cytoplasmic domains of human Met was described previously (25Zhu H. Naujokas M.A. Park M. Cell Growth Differ. 1994; 5: 359-366Google Scholar). MDA-MB-231 (ATTC HTB-26) and T-47D (ATTC HTB-133) human breast tumor cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 5% fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 1% nonessential amino acids. The T-47D/Met cell line (26Shen Y. Naujokas M. Park M. Ireton K. Cell. 2000; 103: 501-510Google Scholar) was cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium as above supplemented with 200 μg/ml G418. Human embryonal kidney 293 cells (ATTC CRL-1573) were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% bovine calf serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. Transfection of 293 cells was performed using the calcium phosphate-mediated transfection protocol. For trapping experiments, 293 cells were transfected with 20 μg of CSF-Met DNA (pXM.CSF-Met) and 20 μg of empty vector DNA (pMT2) or 20 μg of DEP-1 DNA (pMT2.DEP-1, pMT2.DEP-1(CS), and pMT2.DEP-1(DA)) per 10-cm dish. To examine dephosphorylation in 293 cells, 20 μg of CSF-Met DNA (pXM.CSF-Met) was co-transfected with increasing amounts of DEP-1 DNA (pMT2.DEP-1) (0, 1, 2, 5, and 10 μg) or 10 μg of DEP-1(CS) DNA (pMT2.DEP-1(CS)) per 10-cm dish of cells. The total amount of DNA in each transfection was normalized using empty vector DNA (pMT2). DEP-1 monoclonal antibodies A3 and 143-41 used for immunoprecipitations were generous gifts from Dr. Gregorio Aversa and Dr. Antoni Gayá, respectively, and were described previously (9Palou E. de la Fuente-Garcia M.A. Nicolas J.M. Vilardell C. Vives J. Gaya A. Immunol. Lett. 1997; 57: 101-103Google Scholar, 10Tangye S.G. Phillips J.H. Lanier L.L. de Vries J.E. Aversa G. J. Immunol. 1998; 161: 3249-3255Google Scholar). The DEP-1 polyclonal antibody CS895A was generated against the DEP-1 extracellular domain peptide (CDASNTERSRAGSPTAP) corresponding to amino acids 292–307 coupled to KLH (Pierce, Rockford, IL). The Met polyclonal antibody 144 used for immunoprecipitations was generated against a carboxyl-terminal peptide and was described previously (27Rodrigues G.A. Naujokas M.A. Park M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 2962-2970Google Scholar). The antiphosphotyrosine monoclonal antibodies G98 and G104 were generated in our laboratory and described previously (28Garton A.J. Flint A.J. Tonks N.K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 6408-6418Google Scholar). Antiphosphotyrosine-agarose (PT-66) was purchased from Sigma and antiphosphotyrosine (4G10)-agarose conjugate was purchased from Upstate Biotechnology (Lake Placid, NY). The Met antibody C-12 was purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). Antibodies for p120Ctn, E-cadherin, Grb2, and phosphotyrosine (PY20) were purchased from BD Transduction Labs (Lexington KY). β-Catenin (6F9) and plakoglobin (15F11) antibodies were purchased from Sigma and the Gab1 COOH-terminal antibody was purchased from Upstate Biotechnology. Anti-c-Met (Tyr(P)1230-Tyr(P)1234-Tyr(P)1235and Tyr(P)1365) antibodies were purchased from BioSource International (Camarillo, CA) and phospho-Met (Tyr1349) was purchased from Cell Signaling Technology (Beverly, MA). Prior to lysis, T-47D and T-47D/Met cells were treated with 50 μm pervanadate for 20 min while MDA-MB-231 cells were treated with 100 μmpervanadate for 20 min. Cells were rinsed with phosphate-buffered saline and lysed in 1% Nonidet P-40 buffer (1% Nonidet P-40, 150 mm NaCl, 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 1 mmEDTA, 5 μg/ml aprotinin, 5 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 mmbenzamidine). For trapping experiments in vitro the lysis buffer also contained 5 mm iodoacetic acid to inhibit cellular PTPs irreversibly. After incubation on ice for 5 min dithiothreitol was added to a final concentration of 10 mmto inactivate any unreacted iodoacetic acid. Insoluble material was removed by centrifugation. T-47D (1 mg) or MDA-MB-231 lysates (5 mg) were mixed with MBP or the MBP.DEP-1 constructs bound to amylose resin at a ratio of 1 μg of fusion to 500 μg of lysate. Lysates and fusion proteins were incubated at 4 °C for 2 h and washed extensively with 1% Nonidet P-40 buffer. Tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins were immunoprecipitated using 0.1 mg of T-47D cell lysate and a combination of 5 μl each of antiphosphotyrosine antibodies PT-66 and 4G10. Lysate and antibodies were incubated at 4 °C for 2 h and washed extensively with 1% Nonidet P-40 buffer. Protein complexes were released by incubation in reducing Laemmli sample buffer at 95 °C subjected to SDS-PAGE on 8% gels and transferred onto Immobilon-P membranes (Millipore, Bedford, MA) for immunoblotting. To determine whether the tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins bound to the substrate-trapping mutants at the PTP active site, we tested the effects of vanadate on complex formation. MBP fusion proteins bound to amylose were preincubated in 1% Nonidet P-40 buffer (without EDTA) with or without 2 mm vanadate. Cells were rinsed with phosphate-buffered saline and lysed in 1% Nonidet P-40 buffer (without EDTA) with or without 2 mm vanadate. For vanadate-competition experiments, the lysis buffer also contained 5 mm iodoacetic acid and after 5 min on ice dithiothreitol was added to a final concentration of 10 mm. Insoluble material was removed by centrifugation and samples were processed as above. Proteins bound to the DEP-1 substrate-trapping mutant were analyzed by immunoblotting. T-47D and T-47D/Met cells were treated and lysed as above. Lysates (30 mg) were mixed with MBP.DEP-1 or MBP.DEP-1(DA) bound to amylose resin at a ratio of 1 μg of fusion protein to 500 μg of lysate. Lysates and fusion proteins were incubated at 4 °C for 2 h and washed extensively with 1% Nonidet P-40 buffer. Protein complexes were released by incubation in reducing Laemmli sample buffer at 95 °C subjected to SDS-PAGE on 8% gels and transferred onto Immobilon-P membranes for immunoblotting. The samples were divided into 5-mg lysate equivalents per fusion per lane. Transfected cells were rinsed with phosphate-buffered saline and lysed in 1% Nonidet P-40 buffer (1% Nonidet P-40, 150 mm NaCl, 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 1 mm EDTA, 5 μg/ml aprotinin, 5 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 mm benzamidine, 50 mm NaF, 5 mmiodoacetic acid) and processed as above. For substrate-trapping experiments, DEP-1 was immunoprecipitated from 1 mg of lysate with the DEP-1 antibodies A3 and 143-41 and Met was immunoprecipitated from 1 mg of cell lysate using the Met antibody 144. For dephosphorylation and recruitment experiments transfected cells were rinsed with phosphate-buffered saline and lysed in 1% Nonidet P-40 buffer (1% Nonidet P-40, 150 mm NaCl, 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 1 mm EDTA, 5 μg/ml aprotinin, 5 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 mm benzamidine, 50 mm NaF, 5 mm iodoacetic acid, 1 mmvanadate) and processed as above. Met was immunoprecipitated from 1 mg of lysate using the Met antibody 144. Lysate and antibody were incubated at 4 °C for 1 h. Protein A-Sepharose 4 fast flow (Amersham Biosciences) was added for 45 min at 4 °C. Immune complexes were washed extensively with 1% Nonidet P-40 buffer, released by incubation in reducing Laemmli sample buffer at 95 °C subjected to SDS-PAGE on 8% gels, and transferred onto Immobilon-P membranes for immunoblotting. We employed two human breast tumor lines (T-47D and MDA-MB-231), which express DEP-1, for in vitro studies to identify potential physiological substrates of the PTP. The cells were treated with pervanadate to generate the broadest spectrum of potential phosphotyrosine-containing substrates for analysis. DEP-1 fusion proteins comprising the MBP fused to the NH2terminus of the DEP-1 cytoplasmic domain (amino acids 997–1337) were generated. Wild type (MBP.DEP-1), catalytically inactive (MBP.DEP-1(CS)), and substrate-trapping (MBP.DEP-1(DA)) mutant forms of DEP-1 were used for purification of potential substrates by affinity chromatography in vitro. DEP-1 fusion proteins were incubated with lysate of pervanadate-treated T-47D cells. Tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins that interacted with the fusion proteins were visualized by immunoblotting with antiphosphotyrosine antibodies. Only the substrate-trapping mutant form of DEP-1 (MBP.DEP-1(DA)) bound tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins (Fig.1 A). In addition, when a comparison was made between the tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins that bound to the DEP-1 substrate-trapping mutant and the proteins immunoprecipitated with antiphosphotyrosine antibodies, we observed that MBP.DEP-1(DA) recognized only a small subset of the tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins from the lysate of pervanadate-treated T-47D cells (Fig. 1 A). To determine whether the proteins that interacted with MBP.DEP-1(DA) were potential substrates, the fusion proteins were preincubated with vanadate. Vanadate is a competitive inhibitor that blocks the PTP active site and prevents substrate binding and phosphatase activity (29Huyer G. Liu S. Kelly J. Moffat J. Payette P. Kennedy B. Tsaprailis G. Gresser M.J. Ramachandran C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 843-851Google Scholar). The interaction between the tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins and MBP.DEP-1(DA) was inhibited by vanadate, suggesting that they bound to the active site and may represent substrates of DEP-1 (Fig. 1 B). Similarly, DEP-1 fusion proteins were incubated with the lysate of pervanadate-treated MDA-MB-231 cells. As was seen with the T-47D cell lysates, only the substrate-trapping mutant form of DEP-1 (MBP.DEP-1(DA)) interacted with tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins from MDA-MB-231 cell lysates (Fig. 1 C) and only a small subset of the pool of available tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins was recognized by the PTP (data not shown). This interaction was also inhibited by vanadate (Fig. 1 D). Pervanadate treatment resulted in the accumulation of tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins in both cell lines, however, a lower concentration of pervanadate was needed to induce high levels of tyrosine phosphorylation in T-47D cells compared with MDA-MB-231 cells. Similar results were obtained for both cell lines and we present data obtained from T-47D cells in the subsequent figure. Although the tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins that interacted with MBP.DEP-1(DA) were easily detected by immunoblotting with antiphosphotyrosine antibodies, they were difficult to detect on Coomassie-stained gels, suggesting that they were not abundant proteins. After a large scale preparation of DEP-1 substrates from T-47D cells we detected a 100-kDa protein on Coomassie-stained gels (data not shown) that corresponded to a 100-kDa tyrosine-phosphorylated protein detected by immunoblotting (Fig.1 A,arrow). Peptides derived from this protein were sequenced by mass spectrometry. Two individual peptides (NLSYQVHR, SQSSHSYDDSTLPLIDR) matched sequences in the Src substrate and adherens junction component p120Ctn (TableI). Both sequences can be found in all the p120Ctn isoforms identified to date (30Keirsebilck A. Bonne S. Staes K. van Hengel J. Nollet F. Reynolds A. van Roy F. Genomics. 1998; 50: 129-146Google Scholar).Table IIdentification of p120Ctn as a substrate of DEP-1p120Ctn isoformPeptide sequence and matching p120Ctn amino acidsGenBankTM accession numberNLSYQVHRSQSSHSYDDSTLPLIDR1ABC585–592859–875AF062321,AF0623172ABC531–538805–821AF0623193AB484–491752–768AF0623384ABC262–269536–552AF062342A potential substrate isolated by affinity chromatography on the substrate-trapping mutant form of DEP-1 was excised from an SDS-PAGE gel.

Open table in a new tab A potential substrate isolated by affinity chromatography on the substrate-trapping mutant form of DEP-1 was excised from an SDS-PAGE gel. The peptides derived from the protein were identified by mass spectrometry. The table illustrates the peptide sequences and their positions within the various isoforms of p120Ctn. Based on the identification of p120Ctn as a potential substrate of DEP-1, we sought to determine whether the PTP interacted with other junctional components. Immunoblot analysis revealed that the DEP-1 substrate-trapping mutant did not interact with the transmembrane protein E-cadherin from pervanadate-treated T-47D cell lysates (Fig.2). The cytoplasmic proteins β-catenin and plakoglobin, however, were found in a complex with MBP.DEP-1(DA). Although p120Ctn only interacted with the DEP-1 substrate-trapping mutant, β-catenin and plakoglobin also interacted with the wild type form of the enzyme (MBP.DEP-1) (Fig. 2) suggesting that β-catenin and plakoglobin may interact with DEP-1 constitutively. The DEP-1 substrate-trapping mutant bound several tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins from both T-47D and MDA-MB-231 cell lines (Fig. 1). Based on the molecular weights of these proteins and our observation that DEP-1 interacted with components of adherens junctions, we probed for signaling molecules known to localize to cell-cell junctions. We observed that MBP.DEP-1(DA) trapped Met, the HGF/SF receptor, from pervanadate-treated MDA-MB-231 cells (data not shown). Because Met is expressed at low levels in T-47D cells we employed a T-47D stable cell line ectopically expressing the PTK (T-47D/Met), which has been used previously in analysis of Met function (26Shen Y. Naujokas M. Park M. Ireton K. Cell. 2000; 103: 501-510Google Scholar)."
https://openalex.org/W1990766685,"The CBP and p300 proteins are transcriptional co-activators that are involved in a variety of transcriptional pathways in development and in response to specific signaling pathways. We have previously demonstrated that the ability of both these factors to stimulate transcription is greatly enhanced by treatment of cardiac cells with the hypertrophic agent phenylephrine (PE). Here, we show that inhibition of either CBP or p300 with antisense or dominant negative mutant constructs inhibits PE-induced hypertrophy as assayed by atrial naturetic protein production, cardiac cell protein:DNA ratio and cell size. Furthermore, we show that overexpression of CBP or p300 can induce hypertrophy and that this effect requires their histone acetyltransferase (HAT) activity. Moreover, we show that PE can directly enhance CBP HAT activity and that artificial enhancement of HAT activity is sufficient to induce hypertrophy. Hence, CBP and p300 play an essential role in hypertrophy induced by PE, and this effect is mediated via PE-induced enhancement of their HAT activity.

Sassone-Corsi P. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 17359-17362Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Such recruitment of CBP to DNA-bound CREB results in transcriptional activation, because CBP links CREB to the basal transcriptional complex stimulating transcriptional activity and has histone acetyltransferase (HAT) activity allowing it to produce a more open chromatin structure compatible with transcription (for reviews see Refs. 2Giordano A.

Trends Cell Biol. 1997; 7: 230-236Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (430) Google Scholar). Although initially discovered via its association with CREB, it has subsequently been shown that CBP and the related p300 factor interact with a wide variety of transcription factors and play a key role in a number of different aspects of cellular signaling and gene regulation during development (for reviews see Refs. 2Giordano A.

Factors that interact with CBP and/or p300 include, for example, the steroid/thyroid hormone receptors, the hypoxia-inducible factor HIF-1, and a number of factors important in gene regulation in cardiac muscle, including, for example, MEF-2 and GATA-4 (5Bhalla S.S.

As expected from this critical role in a variety of aspects of transcription factor function, loss of CBP or p300 is incompatible with survival of the organism. Indeed, even the loss of a single CBP gene (with a functional copy remaining) results in humans in the severe developmental disorder Rubinstein-Taybi syndrome (8Petrij F. Giles R.H. Dauwerse H.G. Saris J.J. Hennekam R.C. Masuno M. Tommerup N. van Ommen G.J. Goodman R.H. Peters D.J. Breuning M.H.

This indication that these factors may play a role in regulating gene expression in the heart has been directly confirmed in the case of p300, where knockout mice lacking both copies of the p300 gene show abnormal heart development with reduced trabeculation of the ventricular chambers and weaker/less extensive heart contractions (12Yao T.P.

Similarly, these embryos show reduced expression of cardiac muscle structural proteins such as myosin heavy chain and α-actinin (12Yao T.P. Oh S.P. Fuchs M. Zhou N.D. Ch'ng L.E. Newsome D. Bronson R.T. Li E. Livingston D.M. Eckner R. Cell. 1998; 93: 361-372Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (824) Google Scholar). Moreover, inhibition of p300 with E1A also inhibits cardiac-specific gene expression (13Hasegawa K. Lee S.J. Jobe S.M. Markham B.E. Kitsis R.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 20049-20054Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). As well as being involved in the development of the heart, it appears that CBP and p300 are also involved in the process of cardiac hypertrophy in which the heart increases in size in response to increasing demand, leading ultimately to heart failure. Indeed, CBP and p300 can interact with transcription factors such as AP-1 and STAT-3, which are involved in the hypertrophic response of cardiac cells to factors such as angiotensin II (14Herzig T.C. Jobe S.M. Aoki H. Molkentin J.D. Cowley Jr., A.W. Izumo S. Markham B.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 7543-7548Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar, 15Mascareno E. Dhar M.

Circulation. 1998; 98: 346-352Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). Moreover, it has been shown that the activation of the brain natriuretic peptide gene during hypertrophy involves the interaction of CBP with the transcription factors GATA-4 and YY1 (5Bhalla S.S. Robitaille L. Nemer M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 11439-11445Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar), whereas the interaction of p300 with the GATA-4 transcription factor has been shown to be responsible for the stimulation of endothelin-1 activity following treatment with PE (18Morimoto T. Hasegawa K. Kaburagi S. Kakita T. Wada H. Yanazume T. Sasayama S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 3721-13726Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (130) Google Scholar, 19Morimoto T. Kakita T. Wada H. Hasegawa K. Abstr. Am. Heart Assoc. Annu. Meet. 2000; 1060: 219Google Scholar). The interaction of CBP and p300 with transcription factors involved in hypertrophy, is of considerable interest, because this initially adaptive increase in muscle mass is ultimately deleterious and results in heart failure (for review see Ref. 20van Bilsen M. Chien K.R. Cardiovasc. Res. 1993; 27: 1140-1149Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). Hence, an understanding of the gene regulatory mechanisms mediating this response could be of potential importance. To analyze these mechanisms and provide evidence for an involvement of CBP and p300, we previously used constructs in which the DNA binding domain of the Gal-4 transcription factor had been fused to either CBP or p300. We demonstrated that the ability of these constructs to stimulate transcription from a reporter gene containing Gal-4 DNA binding sites was strongly stimulated by the hypertrophic agent PE but not by other hypertrophic agents such as urocortin (21Gusterson R.J. Brar B.K. Faulkes D. Giordano A. Chrivia J.C. Latchman D.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 2517-2524Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Hence, a hypertrophic agent can enhance the ability of CBP and p300 to stimulate transcription following recruitment to the DNA via a heterologous DNA binding domain. Moreover, inhibition of CBP or p300 (using an antisense or dominant negative mutant approach) was able to block the ability of PE to activate a construct containing the promoter of the gene encoding ANP (21Gusterson R.J.

Although these findings suggest a role for CBP and p300 in PE-induced cardiac hypertrophy, they do not directly prove that this is the case. We have therefore tested the effect of specifically inhibiting CBP and p300 on the ability of PE to induce hypertrophy in cultured cardiac cells using a variety of different assays. Furthermore, we have attempted to probe the mechanisms by which CBP and p300 can induce hypertrophy, and in particular to relate them to their known HAT activities. Phenylephrine (PE) and trichostatin A (TSA) were from Sigma. An ANP-(1–28) (rat) radioimmunoassay kit was from Bachem. An HAT assay kit was from Upstate Biotechnology.

The CBP antisense vector was constructed by cloning CBP full-length (1–7326) into the BamHI site of Bluescript SK (Stratagene) in the reversed orientation and subsequently excising the insert withNotI and SalI and inserting it into pBI-G expression vector (Clontech).

Green fluorescent protein (GFP-N1) and cyan fluorescent protein (CFP-N1) were both obtained from Clontech. Ventricular myocytes were isolated from the hearts of neonatal rats (Sprague-Dawley) less than 2 days old and were cultured as described previously (22Knowlton K.U. Baracchini E. Ross R.S.

Cardiac myocyte cell suspension was transferred to 24-well (1-cm diameter) gelatin-coated plates at a density of 106 cells/well, or six-well (3.5-cm diameter) for FACS analysis, in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 15% fetal calf serum. Cells used for microscopy were plated at 105 cells/well on four-well (1-cm diameter) gelatin-coated slides. After 24 h, the cardiac cultures could be seen to beat in synchrony. Transient transfections of rat neonatal cardiac myocytes were performed using the calcium phosphate procedure as described by Gorman (27Gorman C.M. DNA Cloning, a Practical Approach. IRL Press, Oxford, UK1985: 143-190Google Scholar). The amounts of expression vector used are indicated in the figure legends. For each transfection, cells were incubated for 20 h in media containing 15% fetal calf serum. Cells were incubated in maintenance media (1% fetal calf serum) in the presence or absence of PE. After 24 h, cells were harvested and assayed for luciferase activities according to the manufacturer's instructions (Promega). Results were normalized to protein content as determined by Bradford protein assay (28Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (216377) Google Scholar). Cells were incubated in maintenance media (1% fetal calf serum) for 48 h. Cells were harvested by trypsinization, washed in PBS without calcium to prevent cell aggregation, and fixed in 4%. Cells were again washed in PBS and resuspended in block buffer (10% fetal calf serum, 0.05% sodium azide in PBS) to block nonspecific sites of antibody adsorption. Cells were permeabilized in 0.05% saponin in block buffer for 15 min at room temperature. Primary CBP antibody was added to each sample for 1 h at 4 °C and washed in PBS, and nonspecific sites were blocked in blocking buffer for 15 min at room temperature. Secondary anti-mouse IgG1:RPE (phycoerythrin) was added for 30 min at room temperature. Cells were washed in PBS, and the samples were read on a Coulter EPICS XL using Epo2 software to detect GFP-positive cells at 525 nm and RPE at 575 nm. Cells were incubated in serum-free media in the presence or absence of PE for 48 h. The concentration of immunoreactive ANP in cell culture supernatants was determined by radioimmunoassay by competition between labeled 125I-rat ANP and unlabeled ANP peptide. The amount of ANP in each unknown sample was calculated from a standard curve prepared with purified rat ANP. Cells were incubated in maintenance media in the presence or absence of PE. After 48 h, cells were harvested by trypsinization, washed in PBS (without calcium) to prevent cell aggregation, and resuspended in ice-cold 70% ethanol in PBS. Cells were fixed at 4 °C, resuspended in 100 μl of fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC) stain (0.1 μg/ml FITC, 50 μg/ml RNase A, in PBS), and stained for 2 h. Cells were washed twice in PBS and resuspended in 400 μl of propidium iodide (PI) buffer (50 μg/ml PI, 0.1% trisodium citrate, 0.1% Triton X-100, in dH2O). Cells were passed through a fine needle to prevent cell aggregation and analyzed on a Beckman Coulter Elite FACS machine. The mean fluorescence from 10,000 cells was measured for FITC (protein) at 525 nm and PI (DNA) at 620 nm, and the mean ratio of protein to DNA was calculated for cells positive for CFP at 424 nm. Cells were incubated in serum-free media for 24 h and treated for a further 48 h in the absence or presence of PE. Cells were rinsed with PBS, fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde, washed in PBS, and observed under phase-contrast microscopy. Planimetry was performed using Zeiss AxioVision image analysis software to measure GFP-positive cells. Cells were incubated in serum-free media in the presence or absence of PE for 48 h. Cells were then harvested in ice-cold Hanks' balance salt solution, and the protein concentration of each sample was determined by the Bradford protein assay (28Bradford M.M. Anal.

CBP was isolated by immunoprecipitation, using mouse CBP antibody. An indirect enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kit was used to detect acetyl residues according to the manufacturer's instructions (Upstate Biotechnology). The HAT activity in each unknown sample was determined on a plate reader at a wavelength of 450 and 550 nm and calculated from a standard curve prepared with acetylated histone H4 peptide. Values are expressed as mean ± S.E. ofn experiments. Values are given as percent activity relative to the activity in unstimulated cells (set at 100%). Statistical analysis was performed by the two-tailed Student's t test for unpaired data. Analysis of variance was used to look for differences in cell size between treatment groups, and Bonferroni tests were performed post-hoc to test for significant difference between specific treatments. Significance was determined at the level ofp < 0.05. In our previous experiments (21Gusterson R.J. Brar B.K. Faulkes D. Giordano A. Chrivia J.C. Latchman D.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 2517-2524Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar) we utilized a construct containing the full-length CBP sequence in an antisense orientation and a construct encoding a dominant negative mutant of p300 to, respectively, inhibit CBP and p300 and to show that this blocks the ability of PE to stimulate an ANP promoter-reporter gene construct. To further validate these constructs, they were co-transfected with constructs containing the Gal-4 DNA binding domain linked to either a C-terminal fragment of CBP or full-length p300. The activity of these constructs has previously been shown to be stimulated by PE, whereas constructs containing, for example, other regions of CBP linked to the Gal-4 DNA binding domain are unaffected by PE treatment (21Gusterson R.J. Brar B.K. Faulkes D. Giordano A. Chrivia J.C. Latchman D.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 2517-2524Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). In accordance with our previous results (21Gusterson R.J. Brar B.K. Faulkes D. Giordano A. Chrivia J.C. Latchman D.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 2517-2524Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar), treatment with PE stimulated the ability of these constructs to activate a reporter construct containing Gal-4 DNA binding sites when the constructs were co-transfected into cardiac cells together with empty expression vector (Fig. 1). In contrast, however, when the empty expression vectors were replaced with the vector encoding antisense CBP (Fig. 1 A) or dominant negative p300 (Fig.1 B), stimulation by PE was either abolished or reduced to non-significant levels. Hence, the antisense CBP or dominant negative p300 constructs can indeed interfere with the ability of CBP or p300 to respond to PE when delivered to the DNA via the Gal-4 DNA binding domain. Furthermore, basal transcription induced by Gal-CBP-(1678–2441) alone in the absence of PE was also inhibited by antisense CBP (data not shown). In parallel experiments, cardiac cells transfected with the antisense CBP construct showed a dramatic decrease in the expression of endogenous CBP (Fig. 2), further confirming that the antisense construct is capable of inhibiting both the expression of endogenous CBP and the activation of Gal4-CBP constructs. Having established that the constructs were able to block CBP or p300, we wished to test whether they could inhibit hypertrophy induced by PE as assayed by various parameters. In particular, because induction of ANP expression by PE is characteristic of its hypertrophic effect (22Knowlton K.U. Baracchini E. Ross R.S. Harris A.N. Henderson S.A. Evans S.M. Glembotski C.C. Chien K.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 7759-7768Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar,23Lee R.T. Bloch K.D. Pfeffer J.M. Pfeffer M.A. Neer E.J. Seidman C.E. J. Clin. Invest. 1988; 81: 431-434Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar), we wished to determine whether transfection of cardiac cells with antisense CBP or dominant negative p300 would result in reduced endogenous ANP release following PE stimulation. As illustrated in Figs. 3 A and4 A, enhanced levels of ANP were clearly assayable in the medium of cultured cardiac cells treated with PE, compared with untreated controls. However, in cells transfected with either antisense CBP (Fig. 3 A) or dominant negative p300 (Fig. 4 A), this increase was greatly reduced to a non-statistically significant level. Thus, inhibition of CBP or p300 can indeed significantly reduce the ability of PE to stimulate endogenous ANP protein production, indicating that the effect on the ANP promoter observed in our previous experiments is paralleled by reduced production of active ANP (21Gusterson R.J. Brar B.K. Faulkes D. Giordano A. Chrivia J.C. Latchman D.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 2517-2524Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Indeed, because the cultures will include a number of untransfected cells in which ANP production is unlikely to be affected, it is likely that in the transfected cells inhibition of CBP or p300 function produces complete inhibition of PE-mediated stimulation of ANP production.Figure 4Effect of dominant negative p300 on ANP production (A), protein:DNA ratio (B), and cell area (C) and cell length (D) in cultured neonatal cardiac myocytes.To measure ANP production (A) cells were either left untreated or treated with 100 μm PE for 48 h in serum-free media following transfection with 2.5 μg of empty expression vector or dominant negative p300 plasmid. To analyze cells for protein:DNA ratio (B), cardiac myocytes were either left untreated or treated with 100 μm PE for 48 h in maintenance media following co-transfection with 10 μg of CFP plasmid and 10 μg of empty expression vector or vector expressing dominant negative p300. To measure cell area (C) and cell length (D), cells were either left untreated or treated with 100 μm PE for 48 h in serum-free media following co-transfection with 5 μg of GFP plasmid and 5 μg of empty expression vector or expression vector expressing dominant negative p300.

Initially, therefore, we measured the effect of antisense CBP or dominant negative p300 on the increase in protein:DNA ratio, which occurs in hypertrophy when cells increase in size without any increase in DNA content. To do this, cells were transfected with antisense CBP or dominant negative p300 and a marker gene encoding cyan fluorescent protein (CFP) to mark the successfully transfected cells. Cells were then gated in a FACS analyzer for CFP-positive cells and assayed for protein or DNA content. Treatment with PE produced a clear, statistically significant increase in the protein:DNA ratio of cells transfected with empty expression vector alone (Figs. 3 B and Fig. 4 B). In contrast, no such PE-induced increase was observed in the cardiac cells transfected with antisense CBP (Fig.3 B) or dominant negative p300 (Fig. 4 B). Hence, antisense CBP or dominant negative p300 can indeed prevent PE-induced hypertrophy as assayed by the enhanced protein:DNA ratio. To further confirm the effect of antisense CBP or dominant negative p300 on hypertrophy, we also measured their effect on PE-induced increases in cell area or cell length, as measured by microscopy of the transfected cells. As indicated in Figs. 3 C, 3 D,4 C, and 4 D, PE induced increases in both cell area and cell length in the cells transfected with empty expression vector alone. However, these increases were abolished in the cells transfected with antisense CBP (Fig. 3, C and D) or dominant negative p300 (Fig. 4, C and D). Hence, inhibition of CBP or p300 activity can block PE-induced hypertrophy as assayed by cell length or cell area. To confirm these results by using another means of inhibiting CBP and p300, we transfected cultured cardiac cells with an expression vector encoding the adenovirus E1A protein. Thus, both CBP and p300 bind to E1A and are therefore removed from their cellular targets upon E1A overexpression (3Shikama N. Lyon J. La Thangue N.B. Trends Cell Biol. 1997; 7: 230-236Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (430) Google Scholar, 4Goodman R.H. Smolik S. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 1553-1577PubMed Google Scholar). This method has therefore been widely used to inhibit CBP and p300 activity and in particular has been used to demonstrate the role of these factors in the regulation of myosin heavy chain and α-actinin gene expression in cardiac cells (13Hasegawa K. Lee S.J. Jobe S.M. Markham B.E. Kitsis R.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 20049-20054Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar,29Bishopric N.H. Zeng G.Q. Sato B. Webster K.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 20584-20594Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). In these experiments, overexpression of E1A abolished the ability of PE to induce the ANP promoter (Fig.5 A) or to induce enhanced cell area (Fig. 5 B) or cell length (Fig. 5 C). In contrast, an E1A mutant that does not interact with CBP or p300 (24Rossow K.L. Janknecht R. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 2690-2695PubMed Google Scholar) did not inhibit the action of PE (Fig. 5) indicating that the effect of wild type E1A was indeed mediated via CBP/p300. To determine whether the histone acetyltransferase (HAT) activity of CBP has any role in the effect of PE-induced hypertrophy, we utilized a construct (25Bordoli L. Husser S. Luthi U. Netsch M. Osmani H. Eckner R. Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: 4462-4471Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar) in which full-length CBP containing a mutation (WY), which completely abolishes its HAT activity, has been linked to the DNA binding domain of Gal-4. As illustrated in Fig.6, this construct was incapable of inducing enhanced promoter activity in response to PE, whereas this was observed as before with a construct containing full-length wild type CBP linked to Gal4. Hence, a mutant CBP lacking HAT activity also fails to respond to PE in terms of enhanced transcription activating ability. We next wished to determine the effect of such inactivation of HAT activity on the ability of CBP to induce hypertrophy itself. However, all our previous experiments have involved the inhibition of CBP or p300, resulting in inhibition of hypertrophy induced by PE. To provide a means of analyzing specific mutations for their effects on hypertrophy, we therefore tested whether overexpression of wild type CBP or p300 would be sufficient to induce hypertrophy even in the absence of PE. In this experiment, we were indeed able to observe a statistically significant increase in ANP production (Fig.7 A), cell protein:DNA ratio (Fig. 7 B), and cell area (Fig. 7 C) or cell length (Fig. 7 D) in the cardiac cells transfected with full-length active CBP. Hence, overexpression of CBP can indeed induce hypertrophy as measured by these specific parameters of cardiac hypertrophy, the first time this effect has been demonstrated. Moreover, similar transfection with a CBP mutant lacking HAT activity (26Ait-Si-Ali S. Polesskaya A. Filleur S. Ferreira R. Duquet A. Robin P. Vervish A. Trouche D. Cabon F. Harel-Bellan A. Oncogene"

The factors that determine the specific biological response in a given cell type, however, remain largely unknown. We report opposite effects of the p38 isoforms on regulation of AP-1-dependent activities by p38 activators MAPK kinase 6 (MKK6) and/or arsenite in human breast cancer cells. The p38β isoform increases the activation of AP-1 transcriptional activities by MKK6 and/or arsenite, whereas p38γ/p38δ inhibits or has no effect on the stimulation. The p38β does so by increasing the levels of phosphorylated c-Jun, whereas the p38γ and -δ isoforms may act by regulating the c-jun transcription. AP-1-dependent processes such as vitamin D receptor gene promoter activation and cellular proliferation were similarly activated by the p38β or inhibited by the p38γ and/or -δ isoforms. Whereas the human breast cancer cells express all four isoforms, mouse NIH 3T3 and EMT-6 cells express only some of the p38 family members, with p38β higher in 3T3 cells but p38δ only detected in the EMT-6 line. Consistent with the positive and negative roles of p38β and p38δ in AP-1 regulation, MKK6 stimulates AP-1-dependent transcription in NIH 3T3 but not EMT-6 cells. In support of a role of c-Jun regulation by p38 isoforms in determining AP-1 activity, the levels of endogenous c-Jun and its phosphorylated form on p38 activation are higher in NIH 3T3 cells. These results demonstrate the contrasting activities of the different p38 isoforms in transmitting the upstream signal to AP-1 and show that the expression profile of p38 isoforms determines whether the p38 signal pathway activates or inhibits AP-1-dependent processes. p38 MAPK pathway signaling is known to participate in cell proliferation, apoptosis, and differentiation, in a manner dependent on the cellular context.

Nature. 2001; 410: 37-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (4382) Google Scholar). The ERK MAPKs are most frequently activated by mitogenes, whereas the JNK and p38 MAPKs are strongly responsive to stress and inflammatory signals. The then individual MAPK activities often either collaborate or oppose each other in the regulation of biological responses to different stimuli. ERK activity, for example, has been shown to antagonize the p38 and JNK activities in regulation of apoptosis in PC-12 cells (5Xia Z. Dickens M. Raingeaud J. Davis R.J. Greenberg M.E. Science. 1995; 270: 1326-1331Crossref PubMed Scopus (5032) Google Scholar). At the level of a target gene expression, ERK kinase stimulates cyclin D1 transcription, which is suppressed by p38 MAPK (6Lavoie J. L'Allemain G. Brunet A. Muller R. Pouyssegur J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 20608-20616Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1082) Google Scholar). A similar opposing effect between ERKs and p38 MAPK is also observed in regulation of chondrogenesis of mesenchymes (7Oh C. Chang S. Yoon Y. Lee S. Lee Y. Kang S. Chun J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 5613-5619Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). Moreover, an antagonizing effect can occur between the JNK and p38 kinases, despite the fact that both pathways frequently respond to the same classes of stimuli (8Adler V. Yin Z. Tew K.D. Ronai Z. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 6104-6111Crossref PubMed Scopus (591) Google Scholar, 9Ichijo H. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 6087-6093Crossref PubMed Scopus (472) Google Scholar). Hypertrophic agonists including endothelin-1 and phenylephrine, for example, stimulate p38 and JNK kinases in myocytes, in which p38 promotes but JNK suppresses the development of myocyte hypertrophy (10Nemoto S. Sheng Z. Lin A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 3518-3526Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). Our previous work of analyzing Ras signal transduction pathways demonstrated that oncogenic Ras stimulates ERK, JNK, and p38 in NIH 3T3 cells, but the p38 activation in this process blocks the Ras signal through its inhibition of Ras-induced JNK downstream effects (11Chen G. Hitomi M. Han J. Stacey D.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 38973-38980Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). In addition to their opposing activities, under certain circumstances ERK and p38 kinases cooperate in regulation of c-fos expression in response to UV light (12Price M.A. Cruzalegui F.H. Treisman R. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6552-6563Crossref PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar, 13Chen W. Bowden G.T. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 7469-7476Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). It appears, therefore, that signaling cross-talks and integrations among the ERK, JNK, and p38 MAPK pathways are important steps to regulate the final signaling output from MAPK pathway activations. Since each of MAPKs has several subfamily members, it is possible that this signaling cross-talk and integration might also occur inside each type of MAPK among its isoforms to meet cellular requirements for various intricate and delicate biological processing of signals from stimuli. AP-1 (activating proteins 1) are sequence-specific transcription factors composed of homodimers or heterodimers of the Jun family (c-Jun, JunD, and JunB) or heterodimers of the Jun family member with any of the Fos family members (c-Fos, FosB, Fra1, and Fra2) or other transcription factors such as activating transcription factor-2 (ATF2, cAMP-response element-binding protein, and NFAT (14Shaulian E.

Members of the AP-1 family are regulated at both the transcriptional and posttranscriptional levels by MAPKs (14Shaulian E. Karin M. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 2390-2400Crossref PubMed Scopus (1382) Google Scholar, 16Karin M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 16483-16486Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2253) Google Scholar). c-fos expression, for example, is regulated by all of the MAPK pathways including the ERK (19Stacey D.W. Watson T. Kung H.-F. Curran T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 523-527Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar), JNK (20Cavigelli M. Dolfi F. Claret F. Karin M. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 5957-5964Crossref PubMed Scopus (487) Google Scholar), and p38 pathways (12Price M.A. Cruzalegui F.H. Treisman R. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6552-6563Crossref PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar). c-Jun, on the other hand, is phosphorylated at Ser-63 and Ser-73 by JNK (21Derijard B. Hibi M. Wu I. Barrett T. Su B. Deng T. Karin M. Davis R.J. Cell. 1994; 76: 1025-1035Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2954) Google Scholar, 22Hibi M. Smeal T. Minden A. Karin M. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 2135-2148Crossref PubMed Scopus (1709) Google Scholar). The activated c-Jun can then autoregulate its own expression through a c-Jun/AP-1 enhancer element in its promoter (23Angel P. Hattori K. Smeal T. Karin M. Cell. 1988; 55: 875-885Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (990) Google Scholar). p38 can also stimulate c-Jun expression by activation of the transcription factor ATF2 (24Raingeaud J. Gupta S. Rogers J. Dickens M. Han J. Ulevitch R.J. Davis R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 7420-7426Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2040) Google Scholar, 25Raingeaud J. Whitmarsh A.J. Barrett T. Derijard B. Davis R. Mol. Cell.

Karin M. Cell. 1988; 55: 875-885Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (990) Google Scholar). Moreover, p38 may activate transcription factors myocyte-enhancing factor 2C (MEF2C) and MEF2A, which transactivate c-Jun through a MEF-responsive element also present in the c-jun gene regulatory region (26Han J. Jiang Y. Li Z. Kravchenko V.V. Ulevitch R.J. Nature. 1997; 386: 296-299Crossref PubMed Scopus (684) Google Scholar, 27Marinissen M.J. Chiariello M. Gutkind J.S.

Thus, AP-1 can be activated by all three MAPK pathways in a selective manner and serve as a common integrator of MAPK signaling to specific target gene expressions (14Shaulian E. Karin M. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 2390-2400Crossref PubMed Scopus (1382) Google Scholar, 16Karin M. J. Biol.

The signal relay along the p38 pathway involves a kinase cascade, which generally consists of the upstream stimulators MAPK kinase 6 (MKK6) and 3 (MKK3), the p38 kinases (α, β, γ, and δ), and the downstream effectors (3Ono K. Han J. Cell. Signal. 2000; 12: 1-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (1389) Google Scholar). p38 kinases downstream phosphorylate protein kinases including MAPK-activated protein kinase 2 and p38-related/activated protein kinase as well as the nonkinase small heat shock protein 27 (Hsp27) and transcription factors such as AP-1 family proteins ATF2, c-fos, and MEF2 (3Ono K. Han J. Cell. Signal. 2000; 12: 1-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (1389) Google Scholar). p38α, also called p38, was first cloned as a 38-kDa protein (31Han J. Lee J.D. Tobias P.S. Ulevitch R.J. J. Biol.

Three other p38 isoforms (p38β, -γ, and -δ) were isolated later and have more than 60% identity in sequence in comparison with p38α. p38α and p38β are ubiquitously expressed, whereas the p38γ and p38δ products are only detected in certain cell types (3Ono K. Han J. Cell. Signal. 2000; 12: 1-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (1389) Google Scholar). The most important functions of the p38 pathway so far deduced were largely discovered by analyzing p38α, despite the fact that each p38 family member may have distinct functions (3Ono K. Han J. Cell. Signal. 2000; 12: 1-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (1389) Google Scholar). p38α, for example, is known to be essential for mammalian embryonic development as demonstrated by knock-out studies (34Adams R.H.

Whereas some of these functions have also recently been ascribed to p38γ in some cell types (15Chiariello M. Marinissen M.J. Gutkind J.S. Mol. Cell.

Since p38 family members are expressed differently in different cell types and tissues, and each of the family members may have distinct functions, we sought to test the hypothesis that the cell type-specific isoform expression profiles of p38 family members determine the biological effect of p38 pathway activation in that cell type. Our results demonstrated that p38β has an opposing effect to p38γ and p38δ in mediating MKK6 and sodium arsenite (ARS) signaling to activate AP-1 trans-activation of target genes through mechanisms involving c-Jun regulation. These results suggest that an upstream signal of the p38 pathway is interpreted by the p38 isoform expression pattern through differentially regulating AP-1 transcription factor activity, leading to a specific cellular outcome that is dependent on the spectrum of isoform expression but independent of the upstream pathway stimulator. pcDNA3-HA-MKK6 is a constitutively active mutant of MKK6 with Ser-207 and Thr-211 replaced by Glu (MKK6/2E) (39Han J.

The AFs are p38 mutants that cannot be phosphorylated, since the TGY dual phosphorylation site has been changed to AGF, whereas the kinase-dead KM mutants were generated by a mutation of the ATP-binding site (Lys to Met (K to M)). Mutations were generated by PCR-based techniques using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit from Stratagene as described (40Jiang Y. Chen C. Li Z. Guo W. Gegner J.A. Lin S. Han J. J. Biol.

Human breast cancer cell line MCF-7 and MDA-MB-468 were obtained from ATCC and maintained in minimal essential medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum and antibiotics at 37 °C with 5% CO2. Mouse fibroblasts NIH 3T3, the Ras-transformed counterpart, and mammary carcinoma cells EMT-6 have been previously described (11Chen G. Hitomi M. Han J. Stacey D.W. J. Biol.

EMBO J. 1999; 18: 188-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (528) Google Scholar). For promoter analyses, the protocol of calcium phosphate-mediated transfection from Promega was followed. To increase transfection efficiency, Fugene 6 was used for cell proliferation, kinase assay, and MKK6-p38s binding. The luciferase construct (AP-1-Luc or VDR-Luc) or FLAG-tagged p38 (wild type or the AF or KM mutant p38α, p38β, p38γ, and p38δ) was expressed at a 1:1 ratio with vector or the active MKK6 (MKK6/E). For cell proliferation, MCF-7 cells were transfected with p38β or p38γ together with a marker plasmid pSV-GFP and, after 48 h, were pulse-labeled with 5-bromo-2′-dexoyuridine (BrdUrd) (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) and fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde. The GFP-positive and BrdUrd-positive cells were counted under fluorescence microscope (Leica). For luciferase assay, cells were collected 48 h later in the lysis buffer, and the luciferase activity of the promoter was assayed with a dual luciferase kit from Promega by using pRL-TK (encoding Renilla luciferase) as a normalization control in a TD-20/20 Luminometer (Turner Designs). To assess ARS-induced AP-1 activity, cells were treated with 2 mm ARS for 30 min 24 h before the luciferase assay. The results from at least three separate experiments were analyzed with Student's t test for the statistically significant difference. For Western blot analyses, cells in good growth condition were lysed in modified radioimmune precipitation buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.25% sodium deoxycholate, 1 mm EGTA, 10 mm NaF, 1 mmNa3VO4, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 1 μg/ml aprotinin, leupeptin, and pepstatin). Protein concentration was determined by a DC Protein Assay kit (Bio-Rad). Typically, 50 μg of protein was separated on a SDS-PAGE, which was transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane for detection of the molecule of interest, using ECL (Amersham Biosciences) as previously described (48Chen G. Templeton D. Suttle D.P. Stacey D. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 7149-7160Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). For detection of endogenous or FLAG-tagged p38s, the experimental conditions of previous publications (38Wang X. McGowan C.H. Zhao M. He L. Downey J.S. Fearns C. Wang Y. Huang S. Han J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 4543-4552Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar, 49Li Z. Jiang Y. Ulevitch R.J. Han J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 228: 334-340Crossref PubMed Scopus (353) Google Scholar) were followed by using either p38 isoform-specific or anti-FLAG antibodies. The different dilutions of the polyclonal rabbit anti-p38 antibodies have been previously titrated and shown to yield similar binding affinities to their respective proteins (38Wang X. McGowan C.H. Zhao M. He L. Downey J.S. Fearns C. Wang Y. Huang S. Han J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 4543-4552Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar). The antibody dilutions used in this work were as follows: anti-p38α, 1:5,000; p38β, 1:5,000; p38γ, 1:2,000; p38δ, 1:1,000. Under the these experimental conditions, the dilutions of the antibodies showed similar affinities toward their respective bacterially expressed recombinant p38 isoform proteins with little cross-reactions (data not shown). Following transfection, cells were collected by trypsinization, and pellets were quick-frozen in liquid nitrogen after washing and spin. For ARS-induced p38 activation, cells transiently expressing different FLAG-tagged p38s were treated with 2 mm ARS for 30 min, followed by cell collection in the lysis buffer. The cell pellet was either stored at −80 °C or used immediately for protein preparation (resuspended in 100 μl of the lysis buffer and incubated on ice for 30 min with vortexing for 30 s every 10 min). Protein (200 μg) was incubated with 20 μl of anti-FLAG M2 affinity gel (Sigma) for FLAG-tagged p38 at 4 °C in a rotating plate overnight. The precipitates were washed two times with respective lysis buffer and two times with kinase binding buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.6, 50 mmNaCl, 0.05% Triton X-100, 0.1 mm EDTA, 2.5 mmMgCl2). The kinase reaction was carried out at 30 °C for 30 min in 25 μl of kinase reaction buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.6, 20 mm MgCl2, 15 μm ATP, 20 mm β-glycerolphosphate, 20 mm p-nitrophenyl phosphate, 0.5 mmNa3VO4, 2 mm dithiothreitol) as described previously (11Chen G. Hitomi M. Han J. Stacey D.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 38973-38980Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar, 48Chen G. Templeton D. Suttle D.P. Stacey D. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 7149-7160Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). [γ-32P]ATP (5 μCi) and 1 μg of GST-ATF2-(1–109) were used for each sample. Following a 30-min reaction at 30 °C, an equal volume of 2× Laemmli buffer was added to stop the reaction. The phosphorylated protein was separated in a SDS-PAGE. The gels were dried, scanned, and quantitated in a PhosphorImager (Amersham Biosciences). Each kinase assay, starting at transfection and ending with the determination of the protein kinase activity, was repeated two or three times with similar results. p38 kinase is known to stimulate AP-1 via activation of one or more its components (12Price M.A. Cruzalegui F.H. Treisman R. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6552-6563Crossref PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar, 25Raingeaud J. Whitmarsh A.J. Barrett T. Derijard B. Davis R. Mol. Cell.

To assess the contribution of each p38 family member to transduction of AP-1 stimulatory signaling, Western blot analyses was carried out to determine the expression of endogenous p38 family members in the two human breast cancer cell lines, MCF-7 and MDA-MB-468 (468). Cell lysates were prepared and examined for p38 isoform expressions using the isoform-specific antibodies as previously described (38Wang X. McGowan C.H. Zhao M. He L. Downey J.S. Fearns C. Wang Y. Huang S. Han J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 4543-4552Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar). A similar ECL staining intensity was shown for these antibodies toward the same amount of the purified recombinant p38 isoform proteins under the antibody dilutions utilized here (see “Materials and Methods”). The results of Fig. 1 (upper panel) reveal that all four p38 isoforms are present in MCF-7 and 468 cells, which are migrated differently on SDS-PAGE due to their"

Of these extremophilic micro-organisms, the thermophiles and hyperthermophiles have been extensively studied for several years, while cold-dwelling organisms have only recently attracted attention. Cold-adapted, or psychrophilic, organisms have developed adaptation mechanisms to overcome the low temperature challenge, the most important of which is the production of cold-active enzymes. Various adaptational strategies have been proposed for these enzymes. The current accepted consensus is that they have an increased flexibility, thus enabling the conformational changes necessary for activity at low temperature (see Refs. 1Zecchinon L. Claverie P. Collins T. D'Amico S. Delille D. Feller G. Georlette D. Gratia E. Hoyoux A. Meuwis M.A. Sonan G. Gerday C. Extremophiles. 2001; 5: 313-321Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar and 2Russell N.J.

They are characterized by an increased turnover number and physiological efficiency (k cat/K m) at low and moderate temperatures, as well as by a reduced stability. To date, only four crystal structures of cold-adapted enzymes originating from psychrophilic micro-organisms have been reported (3Russell R.J. Gerike U. Danson M.J. Hough D.W. Taylor G.L.

Here we describe the structure of a xylanase from the Antarctic bacterium Pseudoalteromonas haloplanktis. Xylanases (EC3.2.1.8) catalyze the hydrolysis of the β-1,4-d-glycosidic bonds in xylan, a major component of plant hemicellulose. A classification system for glycosyl hydrolases has been introduced by Henrissat (8Henrissat B. Biochem. J. 1991; 280: 309-316Crossref PubMed Scopus (2605) Google Scholar) and, at present, at least 89 different families have been identified, with xylanases usually being grouped into families 10 and 11. 1P.

Chauvaux S. Beguin P. Alzari P.M. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1995; 2: 569-576Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar) while the family 11 members have a β-jelly roll fold (11Torronen A. Harkki A. Rouvinen J. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 2493-2501Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar). The psychrophilic xylanase, on the contrary, can be classified into glycosyl hydrolase family 8 on the basis of its primary structure (EMBL nucleotide sequence data baseAJ427921), sharing 20–30% sequence identity with its members (12Collins T. Meuwis M.A. Stals I. Claeyssens M. Feller G. Gerday C. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 35133-35139Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). The latter family mainly contains endoglucanases (EC 3.2.1.4), but also chitosanases (EC 3.2.1.132) and lichenases (EC 3.2.1.73). The psychrophilic xylanase hydrolyzes xylan to principally xylotriose (X3) and xylotetraose (X4) and, in contrast to other currently identified xylanases, it operates with inversion of anomeric configuration. The activity of the enzyme on X5 is extremely low, while the catalytic efficiency on X6 is much higher, indicating that the enzyme has a large substrate binding cleft, containing at least six xylose binding subsites (12Collins T. Meuwis M.A. Stals I. Claeyssens M. Feller G. Gerday C. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 35133-35139Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). The structure of the xylanase is analyzed in terms of cold adaptation, and features that may be important for substrate binding and selectivity are described. In addition, the native enzyme is compared with an enzyme/xylobiose complex and a partly inactivated D144N mutant. The psychrophilic xylanase (pXyl)2 was expressed inEscherichia coli and purified as previously described (12Collins T. Meuwis M.A. Stals I. Claeyssens M. Feller G. Gerday C. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 35133-35139Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). The psychrophilic xylanase gene, including its signal sequence, was introduced into the Ndel and Xhol sites of the cloning vector pSP 73® (Novagen). The mutation was introduced by PCR with Pwo polymerase, using the sense primer (5′-GCCCCGCTCCCAATGGCGAAGAGTAC-3′) containing the Asp to Asn mutation D144N (underlined), and the antisense primer (5′-CTCATCCACTTTATAAACAAAGCCGTTTTGA-3′). The PCR product was purified and circularized, used to transform to E. coli DINO RR1®, and double-strand sequenced using an ALF DNA sequencer (Amersham Biosciences). The mutated xylanase gene was excised with NdeI and XhoI, ligated into the pET22b(+) cloning vector (Novagen) and used to transform to E. coliBL21 (DE3) cells (Stratagene). Production and purification was carried out as described for the wild type recombinant xylanase (12Collins T. Meuwis M.A. Stals I. Claeyssens M. Feller G. Gerday C. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 35133-35139Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). Thek cat/K m ratio was determined from initial rates at substrate concentrations of 2.0, 2.2, and 2.5 mg/ml soluble birchwood xylan, using the following relation:k cat/K m = v0/S0E0, which is valid at S0 ≪ K m. The pH activity profile and an estimate of the apparent K m of the wild type and mutant xylanase were determined at 25 °C as already described (12Collins T. Meuwis M.A. Stals I. Claeyssens M. Feller G. Gerday C. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 35133-35139Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). Crystallization, data collection, and SAD phasing of the native enzyme and the selenomethionine-labeled mutant were performed as described previously (13Van Petegem F. Collins T. Meuwis M.A. Gerday C. Feller G. Van Beeumen J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D. 2002; 58: 1494-1496Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Crystals of the D144N mutant were obtained under the same conditions as the wild type enzyme. A complex of the native enzyme with xylobiose was obtained by soaking the native crystals in a solution containing 70% 2-methyl-2,4-pentanediol, 0.1 m sodium phosphate, pH 7.0, and 10 mg/ml xylobiose for 48 h. Data collection statistics for the complexed xylanase and the D144N mutant are shown in Table I. These data were collected at the protein crystallography beamline of the ELETTRA synchrotron (Trieste, Italy).

A FOM of 0.93 was obtained for the selenomethionine mutant after density modification, resulting in an interpretable electron density map for the native enzyme and the autotracing of 400 residues using ARP-wARP (14Perrakis A. Sixma T.K. Wilson K.S. Lamzin V.S. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D. 1997; 53: 448-455Crossref PubMed Scopus (480) Google Scholar). The structure was further refined against the native 1.3 Å data using the graphics program TURBO-FRODO (15Roussel A. Cambillau C. Silicon Graphics Geometry Directory. 86. Silicon Graphics, Mountain View, CA1992Google Scholar) and Refmac5 (16The CCP4 Suite: Programs for Protein Crystallography. Acta Crystallogr. Sect.

The stereochemistry was checked using PROCHECK (17Laskowski R.A. MacArthur M.W. Moss D.S. Thornton J.M. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1993; 26: 283-291Crossref Google Scholar), which showed that all the residues are in allowed regions of the Ramachandran plot. The structures of the xylobiose complex and mutant D144N were refined using the coordinates of the native enzyme as a starting model. Refinement was as for the native enzyme except that the B-factors were refined isotropically for mutant D144N. Refinement statistics are shown in TableII. Side chains with missing electron density were not modeled. For the xylobiose complex, final electron density was good enough to place only one xylosyl residue. The hydroxyl group on the anomeric carbon of this residue was refined with a double conformation corresponding to 65% β-anomer and 35% α-anomer, typical values for xylose in solution (18Schmidt R.K.

The structure of the psychrophilic xylanase consists of 13 α-helices and 13 β-strands. The helices form a barrel with roughly 6 pairs of helices surrounding the central axis, and the structure can be described as a distorted (α/α)6 barrel (Fig. 1,A and B). A stereodiagram of the Cα atom positions is shown in Fig. 2. This protein folding topology is common among inverting glycosidases and is observed in family 8 and 9 endoglucanases (25Alzari P.M. Souchon H. Dominguez R. Structure. 1996; 4: 265-275Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar, 26Juy M. Souchon H. Alzari P.M. Poljak R.J. Claeyssens M. Béguin P.

EMBO J. 1998; 17: 5551-5562Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). The inner helices of the barrel have many hydrophobic residues that constitute the core of the protein, and an extra α-helix in comparison to common (α/α)6 barrel proteins, comprising residues 19–25, is present. One 2-stranded sheet is present at the bottom side in Fig.1 A, while the other β-strands occur at the top side, forming either small or irregular sheets. On the top side, an acidic cleft is clearly visible (Fig.3 A), indicative of the catalytic site. Both the N and C terminus of the protein lie at the bottom side and are separated by a distance of 39 Å. Two cysteine residues are present, forming one disulfide bridge. Cys-324 is at the end of helix 10, while Cys-339 lies before helix 11.Figure 2Stereo drawing of the Cα atoms in the native cold-adapted xylanase.

A decreased negativity and accessibility of the substrate binding cleft is visible for the cold-adapted xylanase.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) The psychrophilic xylanase belongs to glycosyl hydrolase family 8, which mainly comprises endoglucanases (9Ozaki K. Sumitomo N. Hayashi Y. Kawai S. Ito S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1207: 159-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). The structure of the catalytic domain of one of these endoglucanases, CelA from the thermophilic bacterium C. thermocellum, has been reported earlier (25Alzari P.M. Souchon H. Dominguez R. Structure. 1996; 4: 265-275Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). The (α/α)6 fold is also observed in this enzyme; however, there are many differences between the two structures (Fig.1). CelA has only 12 helices and also fewer β-strands. The barrel is less distorted than in pXyl and has a more circular cross-section. Furthermore, 5 cysteine residues are present, none of which occur in disulfide bridges. The acidic cleft is larger than in the case of pXyl and has a greater accessibility (Fig. 3). The full-length CelA also contains a C-terminal dockerin domain, not present in the crystal structure, which serves to anchor the protein to the cellulosome (29Béguin P. Cornet P. Aubert J.-P. J. Bacteriol. 1985; 162: 102-105Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, the N and C terminus of the catalytic domain are separated from each other by only 8.13 Å, in contrast with 39 Å for the pXyl. It is generally accepted that cold-adapted proteins are more flexible than their mesophilic counterparts, with a reduced number of weak interactions. This flexibility often coincides with a reduced stability of the psychrophilic protein. In order to identify the cold-adapted properties of pXyl, the structure was analyzed and compared in detail with that of the C. thermocellum CelA, a summary of which is given in Table III. It must be taken into account, however, that the amount of sequence identity between both enzymes is quite low (23%), and differences may therefore be due to this distant relationship. In relation to their adaptation to temperature, it has been found that CelA has an optimum temperature for activity near 80 °C (30Petre J. Longin R. Millet J. Biochimie (Paris). 1981; 63: 629-639Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar), while pXyl has maximum activity near 35 °C (12Collins T. Meuwis M.A. Stals I. Claeyssens M. Feller G. Gerday C. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 35133-35139Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). Differential scanning calorimetry studies have also demonstrated the lower stability of the psychrophilic enzyme, with an estimated melting temperature (Tmm) of 52.6 °C (12Collins T. Meuwis M.A. Stals I. Claeyssens M. Feller G. Gerday C. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 35133-35139Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar) and 83.4 °C 3T. Collins, M. A. Meuwis, C. Gerday, and G. Feller, manuscript in preparation. for pXyl and CelA (minus the C-terminal dockerin domain), respectively.Table IIIParameters affecting stability and flexibility in the cold-adapted xylanase (pXyl) and the C. thermocellum endoglucanase (CelA)Native pXylNative CelANo. salt bridges1330No. hydrogen bonds418382No. disulfide bridges10Accessible surface (Å)15,20313,215% hydrophobic16.6713.98Hydrophobic surface (Å)2,5341,847No. glycine residues3136No. arginine residues1113No. proline residues1511In loops129In helices12In β-sheets20Net surface charge+4−8% residues in secondary structure elements51.3651.79 Open table in a new tab It can be seen from Table III that the most striking difference between the two proteins is in the number of salt bridges, with clearly more stabilizing ionic pairs in CelA. This latter protein also has two extra arginine residues, and as arginines can form 5 different hydrogen bonds, they are therefore expected to be important for stabilization. In addition, pXyl has a higher accessible surface area than CelA and it exposes a larger percentage of hydrophobic residues, a destabilizing factor due to the ordering of water molecules. An increased exposure of hydrophobic residues has also been reported for the structures of α-amylase (4Aghajari N. Feller G. Gerday C. Haser R. Structure. 1998; 6: 1503-1516Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar) and citrate synthase (3Russell R.J. Gerike U. Danson M.J. Hough D.W. Taylor G.L. Structure. 1998; 6: 351-361Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) from Antarctic bacteria and for trypsin from Arctic salmon (31Smalås A.O. Heimstad E.S. Hordvik A. Willasen P. Male R. Proteins. 1994; 20: 149-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). Previous studies have indicated that, in addition to the features already mentioned, some psychrophilic enzymes may be characterized by a decreased number of hydrogen and/or disulfide bonds, a decreased number of proline residues, an increased number of glycine residues and/or by insertions in loops, as compared with their mesophilic and thermophilic counterparts (32Smalås A.O. Leiros H.K. Os V. Willassen N.P. Biotechnol. Annu. Rev. 2002; 6: 1-57Google Scholar, 33Feller G. Arpigny J. Narinx E. Gerday C. Comp. Biochem. Physiol. 1997; 118A: 495-499Crossref Scopus (66) Google Scholar). From Table III, however, it can be seen that this is not the case for pXyl, indicating that this enzyme does not use these strategies for cold-adaptation. In addition to the destabilizing adjustments noted above, many psychrophilic enzymes are characterized by alterations in their active site with, in particular, an increased size and accessibility (3Russell R.J. Gerike U. Danson M.J. Hough D.W. Taylor G.L. Structure. 1998; 6: 351-361Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 32Smalås A.O. Leiros H.K. Os V. Willassen N.P. Biotechnol. Annu. Rev. 2002; 6: 1-57Google Scholar) as well as an optimization of the electrostatic potential (6Kim S.-Y. Hwang K.Y. Kim S.-H. Sung H.-C. Han Y.S. Cho Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 11761-11767Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar, 32Smalås A.O. Leiros H.K. Os V. Willassen N.P. Biotechnol. Annu. Rev. 2002; 6: 1-57Google Scholar). Fig.3 gives a surface representation of CelA and pXyl, and it is clear that the substrate binding groove is larger and contains more acidic residues in the case of CelA. The xylanase is known to cleave xylan, which can be substituted with negatively chargedd-glucuronic acid or 4-O-methyl-d-glucuronic acid at the OH-2 position (12Collins T. Meuwis M.A. Stals I. Claeyssens M. Feller G. Gerday C. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 35133-35139Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar, 34Sunna A. Antranikian G. Crit. Rev. Biotechnol. 1997; 17: 39-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (454) Google Scholar, 35Li K. Azadi P. Collins R. Tolan J. Kim J. Eriksson K. Enzyme Microb. Technol. 2000; 27: 89-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). At low temperatures, both a decreased flexibility of the enzyme and a decreased diffusion rate can influence the overall enzymatic reaction rate. Thus, the decreased negativity of pXyl compared with CelA may be an adaptation of the enzyme to circumvent repulsive interactions between negatively charged residues and substrate, and may enhance the rate at which pXyl binds substituted xylan. Nonetheless, it is necessary to compare this situation with the structure of mesophilic family 8 xylanases in order to determine whether or not this is a true factor of cold adaptation. Indeed, the importance of redistribution of charges has also been described for a cold-adapted citrate synthase (3Russell R.J. Gerike U. Danson M.J. Hough D.W. Taylor G.L. Structure. 1998; 6: 351-361Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and a psychrophilic malate dehydrogenase (6Kim S.-Y. Hwang K.Y. Kim S.-H. Sung H.-C. Han Y.S. Cho Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 11761-11767Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar) where decreased negative potentials or increased positive potentials are found at the protein surface surrounding the binding site for negatively charged substrate. A greater accessibility of the active site may enhance the binding of substrate to enzyme and may be an adaptive strategy of cold-adapted enzymes (3Russell R.J. Gerike U. Danson M.J. Hough D.W. Taylor G.L. Structure. 1998; 6: 351-361Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Mutagenesis studies have, however, questioned this proposition (36Gerike U. Danson M.J. Hough D.W. Protein Eng. 2001; 14: 655-661Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). In pXyl, the accessibility of the substrate-binding region is substantially lower than in CelA (Fig. 3), which is mainly the result of loop 263–276 folding over the groove in pXyl. The pXyl structure therefore also questions the importance of substrate accessibility in the cold adaptation of this enzyme. The flexibility of specific residues in the substrate binding site is another factor suggested to be important for adaptation to low temperatures and, indeed, in pXyl the aromatic residues that line subsites +1 and +2, Tyr-381 and Phe-280 respectively, were refined with a double conformation. Both double conformations are dependent on one another: conformation B from Tyr-381 sterically clashes with conformation A from Phe-280 (Fig. 5). In the case of a cold-adapted protease, it has been observed that an active site tyrosine adopts a double conformation as well, corresponding to both a substrate-bound and a substrate-free form (37Aghajari N. Van Petegem F. Villeret V. Chessa J.P. Gerday C. Haser R. Van Beeumen J. Proteins. 2003; (in press)PubMed Google Scholar). The flexibility of residues in the active site was therefore proposed to be a cold-adapted feature. In pXyl it is not clear why extra flexibility of these two residues is necessary because, in CelA, a similar conformation is found in both the native and the substrate-bound enzyme (25Alzari P.M. Souchon H. Dominguez R. Structure. 1996; 4: 265-275Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar, 38Guérin D.M. Lascombe M.B. Costabel M. Souchon H. Lamzin V. Beguin P. Alzari P.M. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 316: 1061-1069Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). However, small movements of these side chains may be necessary for the accommodation of substrate, and an increased flexibility of these residues may therefore assist in binding the substrate rapidly. In the structure of a psychrophilic malate dehydrogenase (6Kim S.-Y. Hwang K.Y. Kim S.-H. Sung H.-C. Han Y.S. Cho Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 11761-11767Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar), it was observed that the relative B-factors for residues interacting with substrate were higher than for a thermophilic counterpart. This suggests that the relative flexibility of these residues is higher in the psychrophile, which may lead to an increased catalytic efficiency. The relative B-factors for the aromatic residues lining the different subsites in pXyl and CelA are shown in TableIV. Absolute B-values can vary because of differences in data quality or refinement procedures, and the usefulness of relative B-factors resides in the fact that this bias is removed. It is clear that the highest flexibility is observed for Tyr-378 in both enzymes, and compared with CelA, a relatively higher B-factor is observed for Trp-124, Tyr-381, and Phe-280 in pXyl. No significantly increased flexibility in terms of relative B-values is observed for the aromatic residues lining subsites −3 and +3. In addition, no conclusions can be drawn concerning relative B-factors on comparison of their values for the catalytically important residues Glu-78, Asp-144, and Asp-281 (Table IV).Table IVRelati"

Kengen S.W.M. Voorhorst W.G.B. van der Oost J. Extremophiles. 1998; 2: 201-205Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). In some cases, these proteins are very specific to particular carbohydrates, whereas in other situations they mediate the processing of a broader range of glycosides. For simple sugars, such as glucose, binding and transport proteins alone mediate substrate entry into specific intracellular anabolic and catabolic pathways (2Galperin M.Y. Noll K.M. Romano A.H. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 1996; 62: 2915-2918PubMed Google Scholar). However, for complex carbohydrates, a series of glycoside hydrolases must first process the polysaccharide so that its backbone and side chain glycosidic linkages are hydrolyzed to the extent needed for binding, transport, and intracellular utilization. How specific organisms develop the capacity to utilize complex carbohydrates is not known, but this probably involves evolutionary pressures in addition to acquisition of this genetic potential through horizontal gene transfer events. In any case, a microorganism's capacity to utilize carbohydrates presumably reflects the availability of such substrates in its habitat. Therefore, insights into the repertoire of carbohydrate-active proteins in a given organism and how the expression of these proteins is regulated would reveal much about particular metabolic features in addition to how it interacts within a given ecosystem. Thermotoga maritima is an obligately anaerobic, heterotrophic, hyperthermophilic bacterium originally isolated from geothermal features associated with Vulcano Island, Italy (3Huber R.

Its capacity to utilize a wide range of simple and complex carbohydrates was confirmed by the inventory of glycoside hydrolases encoded in its genome (4Nelson K.E. Clayton R.A. Gill S.R. Gwinn M.L.

In fact, the T. maritima genome, despite its relatively small size, encodes the largest number of glycoside hydrolases of any bacterial or archaeal genome sequenced to date (see Fig. 1).

Passador-Gurgel G. Gibson G. Nat. Genet. 2001; 29: 389-395Crossref PubMed Scopus (522) Google Scholar, 9Wolfinger R.D. Gibson G. Wolfinger E.D. Bennett L. Hamadeh H. Bushel P. Afshari C. Paules R.S. J. Comput. Biol. 2001; 8: 625-637Crossref PubMed Scopus (856) Google Scholar) to explore issues related to saccharide utilization by this organism. Despite the fact thatT. maritima has been phylogenetically characterized as a primitive microorganism from an evolutionary perspective (10Achenbach-Richter L. Gupta R. Stetter K.O. Woese C.R. Syst. Appl. Microbiol. 1987; 9: 34-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar), results here support that it has versatile and discriminating mechanisms for regulating and effecting complex carbohydrate utilization. The relative importance of evolutionary processes and horizontal gene transfer (4Nelson K.E. Clayton R.A. Gill S.R. Gwinn M.L. Dodson R.J. Haft D.H. Hickey E.K. Peterson J.D. Nelson W.C. Ketchum K.A.

Fraser C.M. et al.Nature. 1999; 399: 323-329Crossref PubMed Scopus (1206) Google Scholar) in developing its carbohydrate utilization capacity is not known, butT. maritima's ability to respond to various substrates in its growth environment underlies its ubiquity in global geothermal settings (11Nesbo C.L. Nelson K.E. Doolittle W.F. J. Bacteriol. 2002; 184: 4475-4488Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Open reading frames (total of 269) of known and putative genes related to sugar processing and other related metabolic functions were identified through BLAST (12Altschul S.F. Gish W. Miller W. Myers E.W. Lipman D.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 215: 403-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (69678) Google Scholar) comparisons of protein sequences from the T. maritima MSB8 genome available on the World Wide Web at www.tigr.org/ tigrscripts/CMR2/GenomePage3.spl?database=btm. DNA primers were designed with similar annealing temperatures and minimal hairpin formation using Vector NTI 7.0 (Informax, Bethesda, MD). The selected probes were PCR-amplified in a PTC-100 Thermocycler (MJ Research, Inc., Waltham, MA) using Taq polymerase (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) and T. maritima genomic DNA, isolated as described previously (5Chhabra S.R. Shockley K.R. Ward D.E. Kelly R.M. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 2002; 68: 545-554Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). The integrity and concentration of the PCR products were verified on 1% agarose gels. PCR products were purified to 100 ng/μl using 96-well QIAquick PCR purification kits (Qiagen, Valencia, CA), resuspended in 50% Me2SO, and printed onto CMT-GAPS aminosilane-coated microscope slides (Corning Glass) using a 417 Arrayer (Affymetrix, Santa Clara, CA) in the North Carolina State University Genome Research Laboratory (Raleigh, NC). Eight replicates of each gene fragment were printed onto each slide. The DNA was then attached to the slides by UV cross-linking using a GS GeneLinker UV Chamber (Bio-Rad) set at 250 mJ and baked at 75 °C for 2 h. Growth ofT. maritima MSB8 cultures in artificial sea water was followed using optical density measurements and epifluorescence microscopic cell density enumeration, as described previously (5Chhabra S.R. Shockley K.R. Ward D.E. Kelly R.M. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 2002; 68: 545-554Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Growth substrates glucose, mannose, xylose, β-xylan (birchwood), laminarin (Laminaria digitata), and starch (potato) were obtained from Sigma. Galactomannan (carob), glucomannan (konjac), carboxymethylcellulose, and β-glucan (barley) were obtained from Megazyme (Wicklow, Ireland). Growth substrates were prepared as described previously (5Chhabra S.R. Shockley K.R. Ward D.E. Kelly R.M. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 2002; 68: 545-554Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar) and included in the medium at a final concentration of 0.25% (w/v). Substrate purities as provided by the manufacturers varied from 95 to 99%. To ensure minimum carryover between substrates, cells were grown for at least 10 passes on each carbon source using a 0.5% (v/v) starting innoculum before obtaining the growth curves. Specific growth rates on mono- and polysaccharide substrates were determined from the slopes of semilog plots of exponential cell growth versus time. Isolation of total RNA from T. maritima was performed on cells that were grown until early- to mid-exponential phase on the various growth substrates, as described in detail previously (5Chhabra S.R. Shockley K.R. Ward D.E. Kelly R.M. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 2002; 68: 545-554Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). First-strand cDNA was prepared from T. maritima total RNA using Stratascript (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) and random hexamer primers (Invitrogen) by the incorporation of 5-[3-aminoallyl]-2′-deoxyuridine-5′-triphosphate (Sigma) as described elsewhere (13Hasseman J. TIGR Microarray Protocols. 2001; (http://www.tigr.org/tdb/microarray/protocolsTIGR.shtml)Google Scholar). The slides were scanned using a Scanarray 4000 scanner (GSI Lumonics and Billerica) in the North Carolina State University Genome Research Laboratory. Signal intensity data were obtained using Quantarray (GSI Lumonics). A loop design was constructed (see Fig. 2) to ensure reciprocal labeling for all 10 different experimental conditions. Replication of treatments, arrays, dyes, and cDNA spots allowed the use of analysis of variance (ANOVA)2 models for data analysis. ANOVAs are especially appropriate for loop designs in which a large number of conditions are compared with one another, eliminating uninteresting reference samples and allowing for the collection of more information on experimental conditions (14Kerr M.K. Churchill G.A. Genet. Res. 2001; 77: 123-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (465) Google Scholar). Mixed ANOVA models, in which some effects are considered fixed and others are considered random, have been used to re-examine published microarray data sets (9Wolfinger R.D. Gibson G. Wolfinger E.D. Bennett L. Hamadeh H. Bushel P. Afshari C. Paules R.S. J. Comput. Biol. 2001; 8: 625-637Crossref PubMed Scopus (856) Google Scholar) and examine the effects of sex, genotype, and age on transcription inDrosophila melanogaster (8Jin W. Riley R.M. Wolfinger R.D. White K.P. Passador-Gurgel G. Gibson G. Nat. Genet. 2001; 29: 389-395Crossref PubMed Scopus (522) Google Scholar). Using existing SAS procedures and customized Perl code, an automated data import system was developed to merge Quantarray intensity measurements, coordinate files generated by the array printer, and corresponding T. maritima locus numbers in a SAS data set (SAS Institute, Cary, NC). The data import system was verified through independent calculations in Excel (Microsoft, Seattle, WA). A linear normalization ANOVA model (9Wolfinger R.D. Gibson G. Wolfinger E.D. Bennett L. Hamadeh H. Bushel P. Afshari C. Paules R.S. J. Comput. Biol. 2001; 8: 625-637Crossref PubMed Scopus (856) Google Scholar) of log base 2 intensities was used to estimate global variation in the form of fixed (dye, treatment) and random (array, pin within array, pin spot within array) effects and random error using the following model: log2(y ijklmn) =m + Dj + T k +A i + A i(P1) +A i(S m P l) + εijklmn. The estimated effects calculated from this model were used to predict an expected intensity for each value, and then a residual was calculated as the difference between a replicate's observed and predicted intensity and then used as data to capture variation attributable to gene-specific effects after accounting for global variation. Gene-specific ANOVA models were then used to partition variation into gene-specific treatment effects, dye effects, and the same hierarchy of random effects described previously. Specifically, the model r ijklmn =m+ D i + T k +A i + A i(P1) +A i(S m P1) + εijklmn was fit separately to the residuals for each gene, and the resulting parameter estimates and S.E. values were then used for statistical inference. Volcano plots were used to visualize interesting contrasts or comparisons between two treatments or two groups of treatments (9Wolfinger R.D. Gibson G. Wolfinger E.D. Bennett L. Hamadeh H. Bushel P. Afshari C. Paules R.S. J. Comput. Biol. 2001; 8: 625-637Crossref PubMed Scopus (856) Google Scholar). A Bonferroni correction was utilized to adjust for the expected increase in false positives due to multiple comparisons (9Wolfinger R.D. Gibson G. Wolfinger E.D. Bennett L. Hamadeh H. Bushel P. Afshari C. Paules R.S. J. Comput. Biol. 2001; 8: 625-637Crossref PubMed Scopus (856) Google Scholar). Genes meeting the Bonferroni significance criteria were selected for further study, ensuring that genes with inconsistent fold changes would be eliminated from further analysis. Two complementary approaches were utilized to cluster data from T. maritima growth on 10 saccharides. To visualize the relative expression levels of all genes withina treatment, hierarchical clustering was performed on least squares means calculated from the linear models for each sugar (Fig. 3). To visualize the expression pattern of each single gene acrosstreatments, the least squares mean estimates were standardized using the mean and S.D. of the 10 least squares means estimates for a given gene. Each of the 10 least squares means estimates were standardized accordingly with the formula Y i = (X i − μ)/ς, where Y i = the standardized least squares means variable, μ = ΣX i/n, and ς = (Σ(X i − μ)2) 12. The standardized variable was then utilized for clustering (Fig. 3). For complete information on signal intensity, significance of expression changes, -fold changes, pairwise volcano plots, and hierarchical clustering for all of the genes included on the array, see the Supplemental Material. A targeted cDNA microarray for T. maritima was constructed that included 269 known and putative genes or about 15% of the total open reading frames in the T. maritima genome. This included the known set of genes related to glycoside utilization and modification (65 genes), proteolysis (40 genes), stress response, and proteolytic fermentation. Genes related to sugar transport (21 genes) or transcriptional regulation (69 genes) and 66 other genes of interest were also included. Genes apparently related to glycoside utilization and modification in T. maritima include 41 glycoside hydrolases, 17 glycosyl transferases, 6 carbohydrate esters, and 1 polysaccharide lyase. The corresponding encoded proteins have been classified into several families, based on amino acid sequence homology (15Henrissat B. Bairoch A. Biochem. J. 1996; 316: 695-696Crossref PubMed Scopus (1179) Google Scholar) (available on the World Wide Web at afmb.cnrs-mrs.fr/CAZY). There are over 130T. maritima proteins with sufficient BLAST homology to be classified into transcriptional regulatory or signal transduction COG categories (16Tatusov R.L. Natale D.A. Garkavtsev I.V. Tatusova T.A. Shankavaram U.T. Rao B.S. Kiryutin B. Galperin M.Y. Fedorova N.D. Koonin E.V. Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: 22-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (1539) Google Scholar). These regulatory proteins have been assigned to families based on sequence homology; however, different proteins in the same families may have different DNA and substrate-binding specificities (17Mirny L.A. Gelfand M.S. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 321: 7-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Also, proteins placed in different families may share the same name because of their regulon composition, as in the case of the Escherichia coli and Bacillus subtilis xylR protein (18Song S. Park C. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 7025-7032Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar, 19Kreuzer P. Gartner D. Allmansberger R. Hillen W. J. Bacteriol. 1989; 171: 3840-3845Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Of the 69 transcription/transduction genes on the array, six share similarity with the ROK (receptor, open reading frame,kinase) family of transcriptional regulators, which include glucokinases, B. subtilis XylR, and E. coli NagC (COG1940) (20Titgemeyer F. J. Cell. Biochem. 1993; 51: 69-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Six members of the PurR/LacI superfamily (COG1609) were included (21Mirny L.A. Gelfand M.S. Nucleic Acids Res. 2002; 30: 1704-1711Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar) along with the T. maritima IclR transcriptional regulator, whose structure was recently solved (22Zhang R.G. Kim Y.

Several pairs of sensor histidine kinases and response regulators of putative two-component regulatory systems were included, as were regulators from the MarR (23Cohen S.P. Hachler H. Levy S.B. J.

Microbiol. 1999; 2: 175-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar) families. The T. maritima genome contains ∼120 genes involved in oligopeptide/sugar transport. In the targeted microarray used here, 21 genes related to sugar transport were included on the basis of their proximity to the genes involved in glycoside utilization. This targeted microarray was used to examine the differential response of T. maritima grown on a range of mono- and polysaccharides at its optimal growth temperature of 80 °C. Growth conditions were analyzed based on an incomplete loop design (Fig.2). Treatments in the loop design were balanced with respect to dyes so that treatment effects were not confounded with dye effects. T. maritima cultures were grown on a variety of saccharides, including the monosaccharides glucose, mannose, and xylose. The polysaccharides investigated differed in backbone sugar type (glucose, mannose, and xylose), backbone linkage type (β-1,3; β-1,4; or α-1,4), and side chain residue type (galactose, glucuronic acid, or glucose) (see TableI). Included in these were a mixed backbone (konjac glucomannan: glucose/mannose) and a mixed linkage (barley glucan: β-1,4/1,3) polysaccharide. Final cell densities were in the range of 108 to 109cells/ml in all cases. Doubling times (min) for galactomannan (carob), β-glucan (barley), laminarin (L. digitata), β-xylan (birchwood), starch (potato), glucomannan (konjac), and carboxymethylcellulose were estimated to be 85, 72, 143, 61, 117, 74, and 78, respectively. On the monosaccharides, the doubling times (min) were 162, 253, and 188, for glucose, mannose, and xylose, respectively. Under identical conditions, the average doubling time for growth on monosaccharides (201 min) was observed to be substantially higher than that on the corresponding polysaccharide substrates (90 min).Table ICarbon sources used in this studyPoly/monosaccharideSourceBackbone structureSide chainMassDaGlucoseNAaNA, not available.Glc180MannoseNAMan180XyloseNAXylbXyl, xylose.150GalactomannanCarob(Man β1→4 Man)nGal (α1→6)NAGlucomannanKonjac(Glc β1→4 Man)n100,000Carboxymethyl celluloseNA(Glc β1→4 Glc)n90,000β-1,3/1,4-GlucanBarley(Glc β1→3,4 Glc)n250,000LaminarinL. digitata(Glc β1→3 Glc)n5,000StarchPotato(Glc α1→4 Glc)nGlc (α→16)nNAβ-XylanBirchwood(Xyl β1→4 Xyl)nGlr (α1→6)cGlr, glucuronic acid.NAa NA, not available.b Xyl, xylose.c Glr, glucuronic acid. Open table in a new tab Two hierarchical clusters are shown in Fig.3 to summarize the expression patterns of 269 T. maritima genes during growth on 10 saccharides. The first cluster is based on least squares means and compares the normalized expression levels of all genes within each treatment condition. The second cluster is based on standardized least squares means for a single gene across all 10 treatments to show the effect of different treatments on the relative expression of a particular gene. The hierarchical clustering based on standardized least squares means revealed many cases of apparent co-regulation of genes within potential operons (29McGuire A.M. Hughes J.D. Church G.M. Genome Res. 2000; 10: 744-757Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). Several sets of spatially distant gene strings were observed to cluster with similar expression profiles, suggesting the presence of regulons in the T. maritima genome. Representative clusters are displayed in Fig.4. Overall expression levels of a number of genes remained consistently high or low regardless of the growth condition. These included constitutively expressed genes like TM0017 (pyruvate ferredoxin oxidoreductase) and TM0688 (glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase) (30Blamey J.M. Adams M.W. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 1000-1007Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar) as well as genes related to proteolytic activity. Both sets of genes with the corresponding known or putative functions are displayed in Fig. 5. Individual genes with high overall expression levels on only a single carbon source are indicated in Table II. Least squares means for all genes included in this study for all growth conditions are shown in Supplemental Table IV, along with the corresponding standardized values in Supplemental Table V. Below, gene regulation patterns within each functional category are examined for each monosaccharide and corresponding polysaccharide growth substrate.Figure 4Substrate-dependent regulation.

Examination of cluster I (Fig. 3) reveals that expression levels of cel74 were substantially lower than those ofcel12A on glucan polysaccharides. Although the presence of a β-1,4-glucosidase gene (bglA) (accession number CAA52276) in T. maritima MSB8 has been reported (31Liebl W. Methods Enzymol. 2001; 330: 290-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar), the corresponding protein sequence does not show homology to deduced sequences identified in the T. maritima MSB8 genome (4Nelson K.E.

Furthermore, mice with targeted deletion of the sod1gene do not develop an ALS phenotype (3Reaume A.G. Elliott J.L. Hoffman E.K. Kowall N.W. Ferrante R.J. Siwek D.F. Wilcox H.M. Flood D.G. Beal M.F.

Neurol. 1998; 44: 763-770Google Scholar, 11Shaw P.J. Ince P.G. Falkous G. Mantle M. Ann. Neurol. 1995; 38: 691-695Google Scholar). Cultured cells expressing SOD1 mutants have been shown to exhibit increased oxygen radical production and sensitivity to exogenously produced free radicals (12Ciriolo M.R. Martino A. Lafavia E. Rossi L. Carri M.T. Rotilio G. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 5065-5072Google Scholar, 13Ghadge G.D. Lee J.P. Bindokas V.P. Jordan J. Ma L. Miller R.J. Roos R.P. J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 8756-8766Google Scholar). Intracellular superoxide can react with nitric oxide to produce the oxidant peroxynitrite (14Xia Y. Dawson V.L. Dawson T.M. Snyder S.H. Zweier J.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 6770-6774Google Scholar). Several studies have provided evidence for the role of peroxynitrite and nitric oxide in SOD1-related ALS. Increased nitrosylation of proteins by peroxynitrite has been suggested by elevated levels of 3-nitrotyrosine in transgenic mutant SOD1 mice (15Bruijn L.I. Beal M.F. Becher M.W. Schulz J.B. Wong P.C. Price D.L. Cleveland D.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 7606-7611Google Scholar, 16Ferrante R.J. Shinobu L.A. Schulz J.B. Matthews R.T. Thomas C.E. Kowall N.W. Gurney M.E. Beal M.F. Ann. Neurol. 1997; 42: 326-334Google Scholar). Reduced zinc binding has been demonstrated for several SOD1 mutants (17Crow J.P. Sampson J.B. Zhuang Y. Thompson J.A. Beckman J.S. J. Neurochem. 1997; 69: 1936-1944Google Scholar). Interestingly, zinc-deficient wild-type SOD1, as well as mutant SOD1, generates superoxide, which in turn increases peroxynitrite production. Apoptosis of cultured primary neurons induced by zinc-deficient SOD1 can be reduced by treatment with inhibitors of nitric-oxide synthase (18Estevez A.G. Crow J.P. Sampson J.B. Reiter C. Zhuang Y. Richardson G.J. Tarpey M.M. Barbeito L. Beckman J.S. Science. 1999; 286: 2498-2500Google Scholar). Protein aggregation as a toxic gain-of-function was initially proposed after the demonstration of anti-SOD1-reactive cytoplasmic inclusions in motor neurons and surrounding astrocytes in mutant SOD1 transgenic mouse models (19Bruijn L.I. Houseweart M.K. Kato S. Anderson K.L. Anderson S.D. Ohama E. Reaume A.G. Scott R.W. Cleveland D.W. Science. 1998; 281: 1851-1854Google Scholar) and cell culture models (20Durham H.D. Roy J. Dong L. Figlewicz D.A. J. Neuropathol. Exp. Neurol. 1997; 56: 523-530Google Scholar) of human FALS. Aggregation may lead to toxicity in a number of ways. SOD1 aggregates may have altered free radical and metal ion chemistry as described above. They may also challenge the protein folding and degradative machinery of the cell, compromising housekeeping protein functions essential for cell viability (8Cleveland D.W. Rothstein J.D. Nat. Neurosci. Rev. 2001; 2: 806-819Google Scholar). Indeed only modest inhibition of the proteasome complex is required to generate mutant SOD1 aggregates in transfected cell lines (21Johnston J.A. Dalton M.J. Gurney M.E. Kopito R.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 12571-12576Google Scholar). Whatever the relative contributions of these potentially inclusive modes of SOD1 toxicity are, the molecular pathways they trigger that ultimately lead to neuronal degeneration are poorly understood. Studies using cell models (13Ghadge G.D. Lee J.P. Bindokas V.P. Jordan J. Ma L. Miller R.J. Roos R.P. J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 8756-8766Google Scholar) or transgenic mutant SOD1 mice (22Li M. Ona V.O. Guegan C. Chen M. Jackson-Lewis V. Andrews L.J. Olszewski A.J. Steig P.E. Lee J.-P. Przedborski S. Friedlander R.M. Science. 2000; 288: 335-339Google Scholar) have demonstrated biochemical markers suggesting an apoptotic mode of programmed cell death for degenerating neurons (reviewed in Ref. 23Sathasivam S. Ince P.G. Shaw P.J. Neuropathol. Appl. Neurobiol. 2001; 27: 257-274Google Scholar). Recent developments in gene expression profiling technology have provided new impetus in the identification of molecular pathways activated by mutant ALS SOD1. Two independent studies using microarray analysis of transgenic mice expressing the human FALS-associated G93A SOD1 mutant (24Olsen M.K. Roberds S.L. Ellerbrock B.R. Fleck T.J. McKinley D.K. Gurney M.E. Ann. Neurol. 2001; 50: 730-740Google Scholar, 25Yoshihara T. Ishigaki S. Yamamoto M. Liang Y. Niwa J.-I. Takeuchi H. Doyu M. Sobue G. J. Neurochem. 2002; 80: 158-167Google Scholar) and microarray analysis of human ALS spinal cord (26Malaspina A. Kaushik N. Belleroche J. J. Neurochem. 2001; 77: 132-145Google Scholar) have detected some characteristic gene expression changes. Differential regulation of apoptosis-, inflammation-, and antioxidant-related genes were findings common to all of these studies. The use of spinal cord tissue in these studies also underlined the possible involvement of protein expression changes in non-neuronal cells including microglia and astrocytes in motor neuron degeneration. Attributing any of these changes specifically to the motor neurons that account for a very small proportion of spinal cord tissue may not be possible. Primary alterations within degenerating motor neurons in response to mutant ALS SOD1 may go undetected among the protein changes occurring within the complex mixture of more abundant cell types in the central nervous system. We have addressed this issue by developing a cell culture model of FALS based upon a murine motor neuron-like cell line, NSC34, stably transfected with human FALS associated SOD1 mutants G93A and G37R (27Menzies F.M. Cookson M.R. Taylor R.W. Turnbull D.M. Dong L. Figlewicz D.A. Shaw P.J. Brain. 2002; 125: 1522-1533Google Scholar, 28Kirby J. Menzies F.M. Cookson M.R. Bushby K. Shaw P.J. Hum. Mol.

Other Motor Neuron Disord. 2002; 3: 75-85Google Scholar). The NSC34 cells are a hybrid motor neuron × neuroblastoma cell line that exhibits several features of motor neurons including neurofilament expression, the ability to generate action potentials, and induction of twitching in co-cultured muscle cells (30Cashman N.R. Durham H.D. Blusztajn J.K. Oda K. Tabira T. Shaw I.T. Dahrouge S. Antel J.P. Dev. Dyn. 1992; 194: 209-221Google Scholar). Alterations in gene expression in this model were analyzed previously using a microarray approach. Expression of genes involved in the regulation of axonal transport, vesicular trafficking, and apoptosis were found to be altered by expression of ALS mutant hSOD1 (28Kirby J. Menzies F.M. Cookson M.R. Bushby K. Shaw P.J. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2002; 11: 2061-2075Google Scholar). Here we extend these studies using proteomic techniques to analyze the alterations in protein expression. We have demonstrated that expression of both G37R and G93A hSOD1 results in the differential expression and altered function of proteins that regulate nitric oxide metabolism, intracellular redox conditions, and protein degradation.

NSC34 single cell clones stably expressing pCEP4 expression vector only, wild-type hSOD1, G93A hSOD1, and G37R hSOD1 have been described previously (27Menzies F.M. Cookson M.R. Taylor R.W. Turnbull D.M. Dong L. Figlewicz D.A. Shaw P.J. Brain. 2002; 125: 1522-1533Google Scholar). Cytosol was prepared from NSC34 cells using a modified version of the method of Yang and co-workers (31Yang J. Liu X. Bhalla K. Kim C.N. Ibrado A.M. Cai J. Peng T.-I. Jones D.P. Wang X. Science. 1997; 275: 1129-1132Google Scholar). NSC34 cells were seeded into T175 flasks at a density of 9 × 105 cells per flask and maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle medium containing 10% v/v fetal bovine serum at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere with 5% CO2for 96 h. The medium was aspirated, and the cells were resuspended in 10 ml of ice-cold PBS, pH 7.4. Cells from two flasks were pooled for each cytosol preparation. The cells were centrifuged at 600 ×g for 5 min. The pellets were washed twice with 30 ml of ice-cold PBS and pelleted as above. The pellets were resuspended in 200 μl of extract buffer (20 mm HEPES/KOH, pH 7.4, containing 10 mm KCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol (DTT), 2 m sucrose, COMPLETE EDTA-freeTM protease inhibitor mixture 1 tablet per 10 ml). The cells were homogenized with 30 passes of a mini homogenizer. The homogenates were centrifuged at 3000 rpm for 6 min at 4 °C; the post-nuclear S1 supernatant was harvested; the pellet was resuspended in 100 μl of extract buffer and homogenized as above; and the centrifugation step was repeated. The S1 supernatants were pooled and centrifuged at 13,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. The protein concentration of the resulting S2 supernatant was determined using a Coomassie G-250 assay (Pierce). For analytical gels, cytosol containing 25 μg of protein was made up to 300 μl with 7m urea, 2 m thiourea, 4% CHAPS, 30 mm DTT, and 0.2% v/v ampholyte, pH 3–10 (Bio-Rad). For preparative gels, 100–500 μg of cytosolic protein was used. Each 300-μl sample was applied to a 17-cm, pH 3–10, immobilized pH gradient gel strip (IPG). The IPG strips were then rehydrated actively at 50 V for 16 h in a Bio-Rad Protean isoelectric focusing (IEF) cell. IEF consisted of 250 V for 15 min, linear ramping from 250 to 10,000 V over 3 h, followed by 10,000 for 60,000 V-h. The strips were then incubated at room temperature for 10 min in SDS-PAGE equilibration buffer (0.375 m Tris, pH 8.8, containing 6m urea, 2% w/v SDS, 20% v/v glycerol) containing 2% w/v DTT followed by 10 min in SDS-PAGE equilibration buffer containing 2.5% w/v iodoacetamide. The strips were loaded onto 20 × 18 cm 14% SDS-polyacrylamide gels, and overlaid with 0.5% low melting temperature agarose (Bio-Rad). Electrophoresis was performed in a Protean II xi electrophoresis cell (Bio-Rad). Analytical and preparative two-dimensional gels were stained with Owl silver stain and Biosafe Coomassie G-250 stain (Bio-Rad), respectively, according to the manufacturer's instructions. Molecular weight and pI values of proteins were estimated with two-dimensional standards (Bio-Rad). Analytical two-dimensional gels were scanned using a Powerlook III scanner (UMax, Ascot, UK) and analyzed using Phoretix two-dimensional software (Non-linear Dynamics, Newcastle, UK). A previously described pairwise approach (32Arnott D. O'Connell K.L. King K.L. Stults J.T. Anal. Biochem. 1998; 258: 1-18Google Scholar) was used to compare the intensities of protein spots between cell clones. Here we compared single cell clones of NSC34 stable transfectants (27Menzies F.M. Cookson M.R. Taylor R.W. Turnbull D.M. Dong L. Figlewicz D.A. Shaw P.J. Brain. 2002; 125: 1522-1533Google Scholar) expressing pCEP4 vector only with those expressing wild-type hSOD1 and NSC34 stable transfectants expressing pCEP4 vector only with those expressing G93A hSOD1. Comparisons of spot intensities were made between a pair of gels electrophoresed and stained at the same time using samples prepared within the same experiment. Differences in spot intensities were tested with Wilcoxont test using no less than six pairs of gels. NSC34 cells grown in T175 flasks were resuspended in ice-cold PBS, pH 7.4. The cells were centrifuged at 600 × g for 5 min. The pellets were washed twice with ice-cold PBS and pelleted as above. The resulting pellets were resuspended in 0.5 ml per flask of GST extract buffer (20 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.0, containing 0.1% v/v Triton X-100 and protease inhibitors). The cells were homogenized with 30 passes of a mini homogenizer and then centrifuged at 13,000 ×g for 10 min at 4 °C. The protein concentrations of the resulting supernatants were determined using the above Coomassie G-250 assay. Appropriate volumes containing 2.5 mg of protein were adjusted to 1 ml with GST extract buffer and incubated with 100 μl of 25% v/v glutathione-Sepharose, equilibrated in 20 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.0, for 60 min at 4 °C with end-over rotation. The glutathione-Sepharose precipitates were pelleted by centrifugation at 13,000 × g for 30 s and then washed 6 times with 1 ml of 20 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.0, containing 50 mm NaCl followed by 3 washes with 1 ml of 20 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.0. The pellets were thoroughly aspirated and resuspended each in 300 μl of 7m urea, 2 m thiourea, 4% CHAPS, 30 mm DTT, and 0.2% v/v ampholyte, pH 3–10. The resuspended pellets were incubated at room temperature for 10 min to denature and dissociate the glutathione-protein complexes and then centrifuged at 13,000 × g for 30 s. The resulting supernatants were subjected to two-dimensional electrophoresis as described above. The relative expression levels of glutathione-Sepharose binding proteins between cell lines were analyzed using silver staining and Wilcoxon t test as described above. All glutathione-Sepharose binding proteins detectable by Coomassie Blue staining were selected for identification by MALDI-TOF-MS. Samples were Western-blotted as described previously (27Menzies F.M. Cookson M.R. Taylor R.W. Turnbull D.M. Dong L. Figlewicz D.A. Shaw P.J. Brain. 2002; 125: 1522-1533Google Scholar) using antibodies diluted as indicated in the figure legends. The proteins were visualized using an ECL kit according to the manufacturer's instructions. To determine the positions of spots corresponding to endogenous mouse SOD1 (mSOD1) and G93A hSOD1, two-dimensional gels were performed in duplicate using 25 μg of cytosolic protein. Both gels were transferred onto polyvinylidene difluoride membrane. One of the membranes was probed with 1:1000 primary sheep anti-SOD1 polyclonal followed by 1:2000 secondary donkey anti-sheep IgG horseradish peroxidase conjugate. Antibody binding was visualized with 3,3′-diaminobenzidine (DAB). Both membranes were stained with Coomassie R-250. Spot positions of endogenous mouse SOD1 and G93A human SOD1 were located by comparing the DAB and Coomassie-stained spot pattern. Protein identification of Coomassie Blue-stained spots with tryptic peptide mass fingerprinting by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF-MS) and data base searching was performed at the Aberdeen Proteome Facility (University of Aberdeen, UK). In-gel trypsin digestion of proteins of interest was performed using an Investigator ProGest work station (Genomic Solutions, Huntingdon, UK). MALDI-TOF-MS was performed using a Voyager-DE STR instrument (Perspective Biosystems). Data base searching was performed using the MS-Fit (University of California, San Francisco) and Mascot Software (Matrix Science, London, UK) to search the Swiss Prot/TrEMBL (www.ca.expasy.org) and NCBI (ncbi.nlm.nih.gov) data bases. GlutathioneS-transferase assay reaction mixtures (33Habig W.H. Pabst M.J. Jakoby W.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1974; 249: 7130-7139Google Scholar) consisted of 100 mm potassium phosphate, pH 6.5, containing 1 mmEDTA, 1 mm 1-chloro-2,4-dinitrobenzene, and 2 mm reduced glutathione. Reactions were initiated by adding 100 μg of NSC34 post-nuclear S1 protein per ml assay reaction. The increase in absorbance at 340 nm was measured at 0–5 min at room temperature. Glutathione reductase assay reaction mixtures (34Anderson J.W. Foyer C.H. Walker D.A. Planta. 1983; 158: 442-450Google Scholar) consisted of 50 mm HEPES/KOH, pH 8.0, containing 0.1 mm EDTA, 0.1 mm oxidized glutathione (Sigma), and 0.1 mmNADPH. Reactions were initiated by adding 100 μg of NSC34 post-nuclear S1 protein per ml of assay reaction. The decrease in absorbance at 340 nm was measured at 0–5 min at room temperature. Proteasome assays were performed with modification to the method of Beyette and co-workers (35Beyette J. Mason G.G. Murray R.Z. Cohen G.M. Rivett A.J. Biochem. J. 1998; 332: 315-320Google Scholar). NSC34 cells grown in T175 flasks were resuspended ice-cold PBS, pH 7.4. The cells were centrifuged at 600 × g for 5 min. The pellets were washed twice with ice-cold PBS and pelleted as above. The resulting pellets were resuspended in 0.3 ml of proteasome extract buffer (20 mmTris/HCl, pH 7.4, containing 0.1 mm EDTA, 1 mm2-mercaptoethanol, 5 mm ATP, 20% v/v glycerol, and 0.04% v/v Nonidet P-40). The resuspended cells were homogenized by 25 passes through a 21-gauge needle. The resulting homogenates were centrifuged at 13,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C. The protein concentrations of the supernatants were determined using the Coomassie G-250 assay. Proteasome assay reaction mixtures consisted of 50 mm HEPES/KOH, pH 8.0, containing 5 mm EGTA, 100 μg of NSC34 extract protein per ml of assay reaction. The reactions were initiated by adding the appropriate proteasome substrate and incubating the reactions at 37 °C for 45 min. Suc-LLVY-AMC was used at 50 μm. Z-ARR-AMC and Z-LLE-AMC were used at 100 μm. Hydrolysis of the peptides was measured at 340 nm excitation and 460 nm emission for AMC using a Denley spectrofluorimeter. Standard curves were constructed using 0–50 μm AMC to convert fluorescence units to AMC concentration. Reduced glutathione concentration in NSC34 cells was determined using a commercial assay kit (Calbiochem) according to the manufacturer's instructions. NSC34 cells expressing pCEP4 vector or G93A hSOD1 were harvested, washed in Hanks' buffered saline solution, and resuspended in TRIzol (Invitrogen). RNA was extracted according to the manufacturer's protocol. Following treatment with DNase I (Invitrogen), the sample was divided in two, and cDNA synthesis was performed both with and without the addition of Superscript II reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen), according to the manufacturer's instructions. The Arcturus Pixcell II Laser Capture Microdissector was used to isolate motor neurons from 10 μm toluidine blue-stained sections of human lumbar spinal cord. The material used was collected at autopsy from two neuropathologically normal control subjects (1 male and 1 female, mean age 50 ± 3 years, post-mortem delay 16.5 ± 2.5 h), and two subjects with FALS resulting from an I113T mutation in SOD1 (1 male and 1 female, mean age 62 ± 2 years, post-mortem delay 23.5 ± 3.5 h). RNA was extracted using TRIzol according to the manufacturer's instructions, except that 0.1 μg/ml glycogen was added to assist in the recovery of RNA. As above, following DNase I treatment, samples were divided in two, and cDNA synthesis was carried out. PCR was performed using 1 μl of cDNA, 10 pmol of each primer (see Table I), 200 μm total dNTPs, 0.5 units of Taq polymerase, and 1× reaction buffer (75 mm Tris/HCl, pH 8.8, 20 mm(NH4)2SO4, 1.5 mmMgCl2, 0.01% (v/v) Tween 20). NSC34 samples were denatured at 95 °C for 5 min, followed by 30 cycles of 95 °C for 15 s and 60 °C for 1 min. Isolated human motor neurons required 35 cycles of amplification due to limited amounts of starting material. PCR products were electrophoresed on 3% agarose, and relative band intensities were determined by densitometry. The relative level of expression of each of the genes of interest was calculated relative to that of actin in the same sample.Table IPrimer pairs used for RT-PCR analysis of gene expression in human motor neurones and mouse NSC34 cellsProduct sizebpHumanASS forwardCCAGCAGGCACCATCCTTTA67ASS reverseCGCACTTCCCGGTCCATGST Mu 1 forwardACCTTCCTTCCTGTTAGTGGTTGT115GST Mu 1 reverseAAACCAGTCAATGCTGCTCCTTnNOS forwardAGTTTTGTAAGAGCCACTGCAGATT74nNOS reverseTGTCGAATCCAAGATAGATCATATCLMP7 forwardCCTAGCCTGAGCCCAAAGAGAGA74LMP7 reverseAGGAGTCGTCAACATGTACCACALTB4 12HD forwardCACTGTTATCGGCCAGATGAAG78LTB4 12HD reverseTGGGCCGGTTCTGTTATATGTAActin forwardGAGCTACGAGCTGCCTGACG113Actin reverseGTAGTTTCGTGGATGCCACAGMouseASS forwardTGCCAAATAGACCCTGACAAAGA86ASS reverseCAAATTTATCACAACAATTAATGCTGAAGST Mu 1 forwardTCACATGGCCCCTTCTTCA66GST Mu 1 reverseAGACCTCAGTTCGCAGAAACGnNOS forwardTGTCGACAATCCAAGATAGATCATATC134nNOS reverseCAGCACGTCCTGTACATATTTCTTTGLMP7 forwardAGGAGTCGTCAACATGTACCACA82LMP7 reverseACTTGTACAGCAGGTCACTGACATCLTB4 12HD forwardTCAATACAACCGTACTGTACCATG70LTB4 12HD reverseTGCGGAGTTGCTGATAGATAACCActin forwardATGCTCCCCGGGCTGTAT87Actin reverseCATAGGAGTCCTTCTGACCCATTC Open table in a new tab Serial sections were cut from paraffin-embedded lumbar spinal cords from normal neurological controls and sporadic ALS cases.

https://openalex.org/W2061139879,"The significant role that estrogens play in spermatogenesis has opened up an exciting area of research in male reproductive biology. The realization that estrogens are essential for proper maintenance of spermatogenesis, as well as growing evidence pointing to the deleterious effects of estrogen-like chemicals on male reproductive health, has made it imperative to dissect the role estrogens play in the male. Using a model estrogen, diethylstilbestrol (DES), to induce spermatogenic cell apoptosis in vivo in the male rat, we provide a new insight into an estrogen-dependent regulation of the Fas-FasL system specifically in spermatogenic cells. We show a distinct increase in Fas-FasL expression in spermatogenic cells upon exposure to diethylstilbestrol. This increase is confined to the spermatid population, which correlates with increased apoptosis seen in the haploid cells. Testosterone supplementation is able to prevent DES-induced Fas-FasL up-regulation and apoptosis in the spermatogenic cells. DES-induced germ cell apoptosis does not occur in Fas-deficient lpr mice. One other important finding is that spermatogenic cells are type II cells, as the increase in Fas-FasL expression in the spermatogenic cells is followed by the cleavage of caspase-8 to its active form, following which Bax translocates to the mitochondria and precipitates the release of cytochrome cthat is accompanied by a drop in mitochondrial potential. Subsequent to this, activation of caspase-9 occurs that in turn activates caspase-3 leading to the cleavage of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase. Taken together, the data indicate that estrogen-like chemicals can precipitate apoptotic death in spermatogenic cells by increasing the expression of spermatogenic cell Fas-FasL, thus initiating apoptosis in the same lineage of cells through the activation of the apoptotic pathway chosen by type II cells.

Reprod. 1998; 3: 164-171Google Scholar), and estrogen-like chemicals present in the environment adversely affect male reproductive health (4Akingbemi B.T. Hardy M.P. Ann. Med. 2001; 33: 391-403Google Scholar). Such chemicals have the ability to affect gene expression and cellular function by binding to the hormone receptors (5Hall J.M. Korach K.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 44455-44461Google Scholar) and have been implicated in the declining trend of male fertility and an increase in testicular cancers (4Akingbemi B.T. Hardy M.P. Ann. Med. 2001; 33: 391-403Google Scholar). Effects of endocrine disruptors (ED), a term used to describe agents that mimic hormones have been particularly well documented in wildlife populations (6Colborn T. vom Saal F.S. Soto A.M. Environ. Health Perspect. 1993; 101: 378-384Google Scholar). In the male animal, one of the most susceptible pathways that can be disrupted by EDs is the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis. This axis regulates spermatogenesis by controlling the circulating levels of luteinizing hormone and follicle-stimulating hormone through the feedback regulation of steroid hormones (4Akingbemi B.T. Hardy M.P. Ann. Med. 2001; 33: 391-403Google Scholar), and this feedback loop can be intercepted by EDs binding to ERs in the pituitary. Direct interference with spermatogenic cells is also possible because these cells are known to express ERs (7Saunders P.T. Millar M.R. Macpherson S. Irvine D.S. Groome N.P. Evans L.R. Sharpe R.M. Scobie G.A. J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. 2002; 87: 2706-2715Google Scholar). Diethylstilbestrol (DES) is a stilbene estrogen that can bind to ERs in the pituitary and has been widely used as a model estrogen to study changes in male reproductive function in response to estrogens (8Goyal H.O. Braden T.D. Mansour M. Williams C.S. Kamaleldin A. Srivastava K.K. Biol. Reprod. 2001; 64: 927-934Google Scholar, 9Williams K. Saunders P.T. Atanassova N. Fisher J.S. Turner K.J. Millar M.R. McKinnell C. Sharpe R.M. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 2000; 164: 117-131Google Scholar). DES can mimic estrogen action by interfering with the functioning of the pituitary-gonadal axis, leading to the suppression of testosterone levels that result in increased spermatogenic cell apoptosis (4Akingbemi B.T. Hardy M.P. Ann. Med. 2001; 33: 391-403Google Scholar, 10Nonclercq D. Reverse D. Toubeau G. Beckers J.F. Sulon J. Laurent G. Anen J. Euson-Stiennon J.A. Biol. Reprod. 1996; 55: 1368-1376Google Scholar). Therefore, DES-induced spermatogenic cell death is a suitable model to study the pathways involved in estrogen-induced spermatogenic cell apoptosis. Regular apoptosis of spermatogenic cells is required to maintain proper testicular homeostasis, although increased cell death can result in defective spermatogenesis leading to infertility (11Moline J.M. Golden A.L. Bar-Chama N. Smith E. Rauch M.E. Chapin R.E. Perreault S.D. Schrader S.M. Suk W.A. Landrigan P.J. Environ. Health Perspect. 2000; 108: 803-813Google Scholar). As in other cells, male spermatogenic cells respond to external signals and to their internal milieu by activating intracellular signaling pathways that ultimately determine their fate. Signals that induce programmed cell death are known to initiate apoptotic pathways in spermatogenic cells involving members of the Bcl-2 family and also the Fas-FasL system (12Xu J.P. Li X. Mori E. Guo M.W. Matsuda I. Takaichi H. Amano T. Mori T. Am. J. Reprod. Immunol. 1999; 42: 381-388Google Scholar). In FasL-induced spermatogenic cell death, it is generally accepted that FasL from Sertoli cells kill the spermatogenic cells by engaging the Fas receptors present on them. The Fas system of regulation in the testis is operative under various conditions of stress like ethanol injury (13Eid N.A. Shibata M.A. Ito Y. Kusakabe K. Hammad H. Otsuki Y. Int. J. Androl. 2002; 25: 159-167Google Scholar), heat exposure (14Miura M. Sasagawa I. Suzuki Y. Nakada T. Fujii J. Fertil. Steril. 2002; 77: 787-793Google Scholar), and cryptorchidism (15Yin Y. Stahl B.C. DeWolf W.C. Morgentaler A. J. Androl. 2002; 23: 64-70Google Scholar), where increases in Sertoli cell FasL expression have been described but no spermatogenic cell FasL expression was reported. However, recently, it has been shown that FasL is expressed in spermatogenic cells (16D'Alessio A. Riccioli A. Lauretti P. Padula F. Muciaccia B. De Cesaris P. Filippini A. Nagata S. Ziparo E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 3316-3321Google Scholar). To our knowledge, no study has so far shown the up-regulation of the Fas-FasL system specifically in the spermatogenic cells as a means of initiating cell death in response to any stimuli. Although the Fas-FasL system is reportedly important for spermatogenic cell apoptosis, a functional Bax protein is also known to be crucial, as expression of this protein helps initiate massive spermatogenic cell apoptosis at a critical time during testicular maturation (17Russell L.D. Chiarini-Garcia H. Korsmeyer S.J. Knudson C.M. Biol. Reprod. 2002; 66: 950-958Google Scholar). Even though it is well established that estrogens induce spermatogenic cell apoptosis, the dissection of complete pathways leading to apoptotic death because of exposure to estrogens have not been worked out. With increasing data accumulating on the role of estrogens in spermatogenesis and the detrimental effects of environmental estrogens on the same process (4Akingbemi B.T. Hardy M.P. Ann. Med. 2001; 33: 391-403Google Scholar), it has become essential to investigate the mechanism of estrogen-induced apoptosis to understand spermatogenetic disorders. Most of the studies addressing cellular apoptosis in the testis using different model systems have used total testicular tissue and not isolated spermatogenic cells to dissect pathways leading to cell death (13Eid N.A. Shibata M.A. Ito Y. Kusakabe K. Hammad H. Otsuki Y. Int. J. Androl. 2002; 25: 159-167Google Scholar, 14Miura M. Sasagawa I. Suzuki Y. Nakada T. Fujii J. Fertil. Steril. 2002; 77: 787-793Google Scholar, 15Yin Y. Stahl B.C. DeWolf W.C. Morgentaler A. J. Androl. 2002; 23: 64-70Google Scholar). Failure to use isolated spermatogenic cells might provide a completely different view, as the testis is a heterogeneous organ composed of multiple cell types. To circumvent the possibility of introducing variables contributed by other cell types, we have used a purified spermatogenic cell population that is devoid of mature testicular sperm. This study projects a new possibility that under conditions of estrogen exposure in vivo, increased expression of the spermatogenic cell Fas-FasL system may be responsible for initiating apoptotic death in the same lineage of cells by inducing translocation of Bax from the cytosol to the mitochondria, followed by the release of cytochrome c accompanied by a loss of mitochondrial membrane potential (Δψm), leading to the activation of caspase-9 and -3. The Apoptosis Detection System was procured fromPromega (Madison, WI). Bicinchoninic protein assay reagents A & B were purchased from Pierce. Antibodies and secondary antibodies were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA) or PharMingen (San Diego, CA) and Jackson Immunoresearch (West Grove, PA). Caspase assay kit was from Bio-Rad. For color development, VIP peroxidase substrate kit for Western blots and diaminobenzidine kit for immunohistochemical staining were procured from Vector Laboratories Inc. (Burlingame, CA). Proteinase K and AmpliTaq GoldTM reverse transcriptase were from Roche Molecular Biochemicals GmbH (Mannheim, Germany). 5,5,6,6′-Tetrachloro1,1′,3,3′-tetraethylbenzimidazolecarbocyanide iodide (JC-1), MitoTracker®, Red AM, and ATP determination kit were obtained from Molecular Probes (Eugene, OR). TRIzol reagent was from Invitrogen. All other chemicals were of the highest reagent grade and were purchased from Sigma. Adult male Wistar rats (Rattus rattus) were obtained from the Small Animal Facility of the National Institute of Immunology (New Delhi, India). Wild type C57BL/6 (B6) and B6.MRL.lpr (B6-lpr,lpr) mice were obtained from the Jackson Laboratory (Bar Harbor, ME) and maintained at the Small Animal Facility of the National Institute of Immunology (New Delhi, India). Rats were injected with different doses of DES (0.01, 0.1, and 1 mg of DES/kg of body weight) every alternate day for varying periods of time with the first day of injection being considered as day 0. After completion of each treatment schedule, rats were killed by CO2asphyxiation and testes were collected for various studies. Similarly, adult 8-week-old lpr mice were treated with DES at 1 mg/kg body weight for 7 days and were killed as above. For testosterone supplementation studies, testosterone was administered at the dose of 30 μg/day for appropriate time periods. Spermatogenic cells were prepared according to Meistrichet al. (18Meistrich M.L. Longtin J. Brock W.A. Grimes S.R. Mace M.L. Biol. Reprod. 1981; 25: 1065-1077Google Scholar) with slight modifications as described previously (19Rao A.V. Shaha C. Free Radicals Biol. Med. 2000; 29: 1015-1027Google Scholar). Briefly, decapsulated rat testes were finely chopped in spermatogenic cell medium (Ham's F-12/Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, supplemented with 14.2 mm sodium bicarbonate, 10 mm sodium pyruvate, 2 mml-glutamine, 1 mm sodium pyruvate, 10−7m testosterone, and 1% BSA) and the cells were filtered through Nitex mesh (1000 and 20 μm), mira cloth, and glass wool sequentially. After centrifugation, flow cytometry was used to check the purity of the cellular preparation as described earlier (19Rao A.V. Shaha C. Free Radicals Biol. Med. 2000; 29: 1015-1027Google Scholar). FLOW JO software (Tree Star, Inc., Stanford, CA) was used for DNA analysis. Cell viability was checked by propidium iodide (PI) staining at a final concentration of 5 μg/ml. PI-stained cell suspensions were analyzed immediately on Coulter EPICS® ELITE ESP Flow Cytometer (Coulter Corp., Miami, FL). DNA analysis of spermatogenic cells was performed according to the procedure of Blanchard et al.(20Blanchard Y. Lavault M.T. Quernee D. Le Lannou D. Lobel B. Lescoat D. Mol. Reprod. Dev. 1991; 30: 282Google Scholar). Briefly, cells from treated and control animals were resuspended in 50 mm PBS and chilled ethanol in a 1:1 ratio and incubated on ice for 10 min. After washes, RNase treatment was given at 37 °C for 30 min and PI (50 μg/ml) was added to the cells, which were analyzed in a flow cytometer as described above. Spermatogenic cell mitochondria were prepared according to Graham and Higgins (21Graham J.C. Higgins J. Methods in Molecular Biology. Humana Press, Totowa, NJ1993Google Scholar). Briefly, 108 spermatogenic cells were suspended in mitochondrial isolation buffer (150 mm sucrose, 10 mm succinate, 5 mm potassium phosphate, 10 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.4, 0.1% BSA) and lysed by nitrogen cavitation (450 p.s.i. for 30 min at 4 °C with constant stirring). The lysate was centrifuged sequentially at 500 and 2,500 ×g for 10 min at 4 °C to remove unbroken cells and nuclei, respectively. The resulting supernatant was centrifuged at 20,000 × g for 20 min at 4 °C to retrieve the pellet enriched in mitochondria and stored in mitochondrial resuspension buffer (200 mm mannitol, 50 mm sucrose, 10 mmsuccinate, 5 mm potassium phosphate, 10 mmHEPES, pH 7.4, 0.1% BSA) for a few hours without significant loss of the mitochondrial membrane potential (Δψm). The supernatant obtained from the mitochondrial pellet was centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 1 h at 4 °C in an OptimaTM XL-100K ultracentrifuge (Beckman, Palo Alto, CA) to obtain the cell cytosol. Testes from rats were fixed in Bouin's fixative (saturated picric acid:formaldehyde:acetic acid in the ratio of 15:5:1) for assessing morphological changes and in 4% formaldehyde (4% formaldehyde in 50 mm PBS) for TUNEL assays. Tissues were processed by standard procedures. Briefly, post-fixation wash and dehydration in graded ethanol (50–100%) was followed by paraffin embedding. Four-μm sections were cut with a Reichert Jung Microtome 1640 (Reichert, Germany) and transferred to albumin-coated slides. For assessment of the morphological integrity of the seminiferous tubules, tissue sections were stained with hematoxylin (0.5%) and eosin (0.01%) after deparaffinization and hydration. Enumeration of seminiferous epithelium stages I–IV, V–VI, VII–VIII, IX–XI, and XII–XIV was carried out using a Nikon E600W upright microscope with a 40× objective. For each rat, at least 10 tubules per stage group were analyzed. These stages were identified according to the criteria proposed by Russell et al. (22Russell L.D. Ren H.P. Sinha Hikim I. Schulze W. Sinha Hikim A.P. Am. J. Anat. 1990; 188: 21-30Google Scholar) for paraffin sections. The rate of spermatogenic cell apoptosis was expressed as the number of apoptotic spermatogenic cells per tubule. Detection of DNA fragmentation by TUNEL staining was carried out as described previously (19Rao A.V. Shaha C. Free Radicals Biol. Med. 2000; 29: 1015-1027Google Scholar, 23Rao A.V.S. Shaha C. FEBS Lett. 2002; 527: 133-137Google Scholar) using a TUNEL assay kit according to instructions from the manufacturer. Briefly, deparaffinized tissue sections were treated with equilibration buffer (200 mmpotassium cacodylate, 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 0.2 mm DTT, 0.25 mg/ml BSA, 2.5 mm cobalt chloride) for 10 min at room temperature followed by incubation with TdT buffer containing nucleotide mix (50 μm dUTP-biotin, 100 μm dATP, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1 mm EDTA, pH 7.6) for 1 h at 37 °C. The incorporation was visualized with avidin conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (1:500) using a diaminobenzidine substrate kit, and sections were counterstained with hematoxylin (0.5%) and visualized under a Nikon E600W microscope. At least 100 seminiferous tubules per rat from four independent experiments were counted for TUNEL-positive nuclei. For Fas-FasL immunostaining, fixed sections were deparaffinized and blocked for endogenous peroxidase activity with 0.3% H2O2 in PBS for 15 min and for nonspecific binding with 10% normal goat serum for 30 min. Fas and FasL antibody (1:100 dilution in 10% normal goat serum) incubation was carried out at 4 °C, for 16 h. Appropriate blocking peptide at 4 μg/ml concentration adsorbed with the antibody was added to the tissue sections for identification of nonspecific staining. Anti-rabbit IgG peroxidase (1:200) was used as secondary antibody for 1 h at room temperature. After washing, color was developed with a diaminobenzidine kit and sections were counterstained in hematoxylin (0.5%) for 30 s, dehydrated, and mounted in DPX mountant. For co-localization of Fas-FasL, isolated spermatogenic cells fixed in 2% paraformaldehyde were blocked for nonspecific sites with 10% normal goat serum and permeabilized with 0.1% saponin prior to staining. The cells were incubated with monoclonal antibodies against FasL (1:50) and Fas (1:50) tagged to phycoerythrin and fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC), respectively. The dual staining was visualized with a confocal microscope (Zeiss LSM 510, Zeiss Inc., Thornwood, NY) by illuminating with a 488-nm argon ion laser at 15% power and images recorded through a band pass filter at 505–550 nm and a long pass filter at 560 nm. For staining of Bax and cytochrome c, isolated spermatogenic cells were fixed in 2% paraformaldehyde and stained for the respective antigens with anti-Bax and anti- cytochrome c antibodies (1:50) for 1 h at room temperature. Secondary antibody tagged to FITC was used at 1:200 dilution. For Bax-stained cells labeled with FITC, to identify the site of staining, cells were incubated with MitoTracker® Red AM, a mitochondria-specific dye, prior to observation with a confocal system using same settings as above. Stainings for MitoTracker® Red and Bax (green) were overlapped and source of staining with anti-Bax antibody was identified. Cytochrome c-FITC distribution in spermatogenic cells was visualized at 540 nm using an E600W Nikon microscope. Total RNA was isolated from whole testis and spermatogenic cells using TRIzol reagent. First strand complementary DNA was made using 1–5 μg of total RNA in the presence of AmpliTaq GoldTM reverse transcriptase and random primer. After the RT reaction, 1 μl of incubation mixture was used as a template for the subsequent PCR reaction. Primer sets used as a template to obtain PCR products of FasL were 5′-AGCCCGTGAATTACCCATGTC-3′ and 5′-TGCTGGGGTTGGCTATTTGCT-3′ and for β-actin were 5′-AGGCATCCTGACCCTGAAGTAC-3′ and 5′-TCTTCATGAGGTAGTCTGTCAG-3′. For semiquantitative analysis, β-actin was used as an internal control, and was coamplified with FasL messenger RNA by using β-actin primers and FasL primer (1 μl) in the same mixture. All PCR reactions were performed for 30 cycles with an annealing temperature of 55–65 °C in 1.5 mmMgCl2. Electrophoresis on 12% polyacrylamide gels, Western blots, and DNA extractions were carried out as described previously (19Rao A.V. Shaha C. Free Radicals Biol. Med. 2000; 29: 1015-1027Google Scholar, 23Rao A.V.S. Shaha C. FEBS Lett. 2002; 527: 133-137Google Scholar). Δψm was estimated using JC-1 as a probe according to the method of Dey and Moraes (24Dey R. Moraes C.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 7094Google Scholar) with slight modifications. JC-1 is a cationic mitochondrial vital dye that is lipophilic and becomes concentrated in the mitochondria in proportion to their Δψm; more dye accumulates in mitochondria with greater Δψm and ATP-generating capacity. The dye exists as a monomer at low concentrations (emission, 530 nm; green fluorescence) but at higher concentrations forms J aggregates (emission, 590 nm; red fluorescence). JC-1 was chosen because of its reliability for analyzing Δψm in intact cells, whereas other probes capable of binding mitochondria show a lower sensitivity or a noncoherent behavior because of a high sensitivity to changes in plasma membrane potential (25Bortner C.D. Cidlowski J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 21962Google Scholar). Briefly, cells after different treatments were collected and incubated for 10 min with 5 μm JC-1 at 37 °C, washed, and resuspended in media, and Δψm was measured at 590 nm for J-aggregates and at 530 nm for J-monomer. The ratio of 530/590 nm was considered as the relative Δψm value. ATP was measured by a bioluminescence assay (26Kricka L.J. Anal. Biochem. 1998; 175: 14-21Google Scholar) using an ATP determination kit. The assay is based on the requirement of luciferase for ATP in producing light (emission maximum ∼ 560 nm at pH 7.8). Briefly, cells (106) after different treatments were resuspended in reaction buffer containing 1 mm DTT, 0.5 mm luciferin, and 12.5 μg/ml luciferase and gently mixed, following which readings were taken in a luminometer (Lumicount, Packard, CT). ATP standard curves were run in all experiments with different concentrations of ATP, and calculations were made against the curve and cellular ATP levels were expressed as nmol/106 cells. Quantification of oxidized glutathione (GSSG) and reduced glutathione (GSH) in the samples was done using the fluorescent probe o-phthalaldehyde (23Rao A.V.S. Shaha C. FEBS Lett. 2002; 527: 133-137Google Scholar, 27Senft A.P. Dalton T.P. Shertzer H.G. Anal. Biochem. 2000; 280: 80-86Google Scholar). Cell lysates (200 μg of protein) were incubated with caspase buffer (50 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 100 mm sodium chloride, 10% sucrose, 1 mm EDTA, 0.1% CHAPS, and 100 mm DTT) containing 100 mm fluorogenic peptide substrate, acetyl-Asp-Glu-Val-Asp-7-amino-4-trifluoromethyl coumarin (Ac-DEVD-AFC) at 33 °C. Apopain from caspase-3 assay kit was used as a positive control. 7-Amino-4-trifluoromethyl coumarin release was measured with a PerkinElmer Life Sciences LS-50B luminescence spectrometer at excitation wavelength of 400 nm and emission wavelength of 550 nm. Plasma levels of testosterone were measured by radioimmunoassay according to Sufi et al. (28Sufi S.B. Donaldson A. Jeffcoate S.L. WHO Matched Reagents Programme Methods Manual. 18th Ed. World Health Organization, Geneva1994: 74-84Google Scholar). The sensitivity of radioimmunoassay was 2.7 pg/assay tube. The intra-assay and interassay variations were 10 and 7%, respectively. Bicinchoninic acid assay was performed in microtiter plates as described previously (23Rao A.V.S. Shaha C. FEBS Lett. 2002; 527: 133-137Google Scholar). An unpaired two-tailed Student'st test using T-EASE software (version 2.0; Institute for Scientific Information, Philadelphia, PA) and analysis of variance were used for statistical analyses. Data are reported as mean ± S.E. from at least three separate experimental groups unless specifically mentioned. Each experimental group consisted of 6 rats. Data sets were said to be significantly different for p < 0.05 (*),p < 0.01 (**), and p < 0.001 (***). DES, a potent estrogenic analogue, is known to disrupt spermatogenesis by the suppression of pituitary gonadotropins, which leads to the inhibition of testosterone production (8Goyal H.O. Braden T.D. Mansour M. Williams C.S. Kamaleldin A. Srivastava K.K. Biol. Reprod. 2001; 64: 927-934Google Scholar) leading to insufficient circulating and intratesticular concentration of the hormone. This results in abnormal spermatogenesis, as testosterone is vital for spermatogenic cell survival (4Akingbemi B.T. Hardy M.P. Ann. Med. 2001; 33: 391-403Google Scholar). Even though the importance of estrogen-induced deregulation of spermatogenesis in male infertility has been acknowledged, the mechanism of DES-induced apoptosis in the adult testis has not been worked upon. Therefore, we first examined the kinetics of DES-induced cell death in the adult testis by using two different doses administered for varying periods of time. We observed a loss of testicular weight in treated animals in a dose- and time-dependent manner (Fig.1 A), indicating a decrease in the number of testicular cells. This observation corroborates previous studies where DES treatment in rat (8Goyal H.O. Braden T.D. Mansour M. Williams C.S. Kamaleldin A. Srivastava K.K. Biol. Reprod. 2001; 64: 927-934Google Scholar, 29Amador A.G. Esquifino A.I. Bartke A. Chandrashekar V. Fernandez-Ruiz J.J. Steger R.W. Hodges S.L. Rev. Esp. Fisiol. 1989; 45: 245-253Google Scholar) and hamsters (10Nonclercq D. Reverse D. Toubeau G. Beckers J.F. Sulon J. Laurent G. Anen J. Euson-Stiennon J.A. Biol. Reprod. 1996; 55: 1368-1376Google Scholar) have been shown to reduce testis weight that was accompanied by cell death. Because DES is known to interfere with testosterone levels (30Sinha Hikim A.P. Swerdloff R.S. Rev. Reprod. 1999; 4: 38-47Google Scholar), we checked serum testosterone and found a significant decrease in circulating testosterone in treated animals in comparison to controls, although a total shut-off was not achieved (Fig. 1 B). In addition to the above two doses of 0.1 and 1 mg of DES, we used 0.01 mg of DES to look at similar parameters, but no appreciable change in either testicular weight or testosterone levels were found (data not shown). Histological examination of sections from the treated and control testis showed that spermatogenic cell loss was more severe with 1-mg DES treatment as compared with the 0.1-mg DES-treated group (Fig.2 A, a–g), even though reduction in testosterone achieved with both the doses was similar. The loss in testicular weight and spermatogenic cells from the testis corresponded to a time- and dose-dependent decrease in mean cross-sectional area of seminiferous tubules (Fig.2 B, a and b). The seminiferous tubular atrophy observed during exposure to DES was accompanied by important modifications in seminiferous epithelium composition and morphology. There was an apparent decrease in total number of spermatogenic cells, with both the number of spermatozoa and spermatid having decreased. The type of spermatogenic cells affected by DES-induced testosterone suppression is different from those affected by gonadotropin-releasing hormone antagonist-induced suppression of testosterone (31Blanco-Rodriguez J. Martinez-Garcia C. J. Reprod. Fertil. 1997; 110: 61-70Google Scholar). In the regimen of hormone administration that we used, the group treated with 1 mg of DES exhibited a severe depletion of spermatogenic cells by day 22, whereas treatment with 0.1 mg of DES showed a nearly comparable depletion of spermatogenic cells only by day 31, showing that depletion of spermatogenic cells was dependent on dose as well as time of treatment. Testosterone treatment along with DES was able to restore serum testosterone levels to control levels from day 7 onward (TableI). However, as shown in Table I, the cell viability was not"
https://openalex.org/W2112021618,"Caspase-2 is unique among mammalian caspases because it localizes to the nucleus in a prodomain-dependent manner. The caspase-2 prodomain also regulates caspase-2 activity via a caspase recruitment domain that mediates oligomerization of procaspase-2 molecules and their subsequent autoactivation. In this study we sought to map specific functional regions in the caspase-2 prodomain that regulate its nuclear transport and also its activation. Our data indicate that caspase-2 contains a classical nuclear localization signal (NLS) at the C terminus of the prodomain which is recognized by the importin α/β heterodimer. The mutation of a conserved Lys residue in the NLS abolishes nuclear localization of caspase-2 and binding to the importin α/β heterodimer. Although caspase-2 is imported into the nucleus, mutants lacking the NLS were still capable of inducing apoptosis upon overexpression in transfected cells. We define a region in the prodomain that regulates the ability of caspase-2 to form dot- and filament-like structures when ectopically expressed, which in turn promotes cell killing. Our data provides a mechanism for caspase-2 nuclear import and demonstrate that association of procaspase-2 into higher order structures, rather than its nuclear localization, is required for caspase-2 activation and its ability to induce apoptosis.

Caspase activation is a key event in the execution of apoptosis (reviewed in Refs. 1Nicholson D.W. Cell Death Differ. 1999; 6: 1028-1042Crossref PubMed Scopus (1306) Google Scholar and 2Wang X. Gene Dev. 2000; 15: 1060-1066Google Scholar). Based on structure and function, caspases are grouped into two main classes (reviewed in Refs.3Kumar S. Colussi P.A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1999; 24: 1-4Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar and 4Shi Y. Mol. Cell. 2002; 9: 459-470Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1465) Google Scholar). The initiator caspases, including caspase-2, have a long prodomain that mediates their autoactivation early during apoptosis. The effector caspases, including caspase-3, -6, and -7, have short prodomains and require cleavage by initiator caspases for their activation. Effector caspases are primarily responsible for the cleavage of a large number of cellular substrates which leads to the morphological changes that characterize apoptotic cell death (1Nicholson D.W. Cell Death Differ. 1999; 6: 1028-1042Crossref PubMed Scopus (1306) Google Scholar, 2Wang X. Gene Dev. 2000; 15: 1060-1066Google Scholar, 3Kumar S. Colussi P.A. Trends Biochem.

The long prodomain of caspase-2 contains a caspase recruitment domain (CARD), 1The abbreviations used are: CARD, caspase recruitment domain; NLS, nuclear localization signal; GFP, green fluorescent protein; DED, death effector domain; WT, wild type; PDM, caspase-2 prodomain; HA, hemagglutinin; X-gal, 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-β-d-galactopyranoside a six α-helical motif shared by other initiator caspases including CED-3 in the worm, DRONC in Drosophila, and caspase-9 in mammals (3Kumar S.

Cell Death Differ. 2002; 9: 358-361Crossref PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar). A structurally and functionally related motif, the death effector domain (DED), is found in the prodomains of some other initiator caspases including caspase-8 and -10 (3Kumar S. Colussi P.A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1999; 24: 1-4Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar, 4Shi Y. Mol. Cell. 2002; 9: 459-470Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1465) Google Scholar). The proximal activation of initiator caspases in vivo is regulated by adaptor proteins that, like the caspases, contain CARDs or DEDs (3Kumar S. Colussi P.A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1999; 24: 1-4Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar, 4Shi Y. Mol. Cell. 2002; 9: 459-470Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1465) Google Scholar). In response to an apoptotic stimulus, adaptor proteins bind to initiator caspases via their CARDs or DEDs and recruit them to specific death complexes. High local concentrations of procaspase molecules are generated, allowing their activation and autoprocessing. When expressed ectopically, however, activation of initiator caspases usually occurs spontaneously because of high intracellular concentrations of caspases (3Kumar S. Colussi P.A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1999; 24: 1-4Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar, 4Shi Y. Mol. Cell. 2002; 9: 459-470Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1465) Google Scholar). Upon overexpression in transfected cells, via its CARD-containing prodomain, caspase-2 associates into distinctive dot-like and filamentous nuclear structures that may represent sites of caspase-2 homodimerization and activation (7Colussi P.A. Harvey N.L. Kumar S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 24535-24542Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar, 8Kumar S.

In a similar fashion, the DEDs of caspase-8 and -10 mediate their formation into structures in the cytoplasm called death effector filaments (10Siegel R.M. Martin D.A. Zheng L. Ng S.Y. Bertin J. Cohen J. Lenardo M.J. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 1243-1253Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). Because of their propensity to homodimerize at high concentrations, overexpression of initiator caspases, including caspase-2, is sufficient to trigger apoptosis in transiently transfected cells (11Kumar S. Kinoshita M. Noda M. Copeland N.G. Jenkins N.A. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 1613-1626Crossref PubMed Scopus (588) Google Scholar, 12Kumar S. Kinoshita M. Dorstyn L. Noda M.

In fact, enforced dimerization of effector caspases is sufficient to trigger their activation (14MacCorkle R.A. Freeman K.W. Spencer D.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

It appears to be required for mitochondrial permeabilization and the release of apoptogenic factors such as cytochrome c and Diablo (17Lassus P. Opitz-Araya X. Lazebnik Y.

Although adaptor proteins have been described for most initiator caspases, an in vivo adaptor for caspase-2 has yet to be identified. Via its CARD, caspase-2 can interact with the CARD-containing proteins RAIDD (21Duan H. Dixit V.M. Nature. 1997; 385: 86-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (469) Google Scholar, 22Shearwin-Whyatt L.M. Harvey N.L. Kumar S. Cell Death Differ. 2000; 7: 155-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar) and ARC (23Dowds T.A. Sabban E.L. Cell Death Differ. 2001; 8: 640-648Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar), although the physiological significance of these interactions remains to be confirmed. Following gel filtration, endogenous caspase-2 elutes in high molecular weight fractions of cell lysates incubated at 37 °C, suggesting that caspase-2 has the ability to be recruited to and/or form a large protein complex in vivo, in a similar manner to the Apaf-1-mediated caspase-9 apoptosome (24Read S.H. Baliga B.C. Ekert P.G. Vaux D.L. Kumar S. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 159: 739-745Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). One of the most distinguishing features of caspase-2 is its ability to localize to the nucleus constitutively (7Colussi P.A. Harvey N.L. Kumar S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 24535-24542Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar, 25Zhivotovsky B. Samali A. Gahm A. Orrenius S.

Cell Biol. 2000; 149: 603-612Crossref PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar), although its role in this subcellular compartment is not known. A recent study (27Paroni G. Henderson C. Schneider C. Brancolini C. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 15147-15161Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar) reports that caspase-2 is retained in the nucleus until the late stages of apoptosis, suggesting that the nucleus is the site of procaspase-2 activation. Supporting this, another study has shown that in the absence of cytosolic factors, the nuclear pool of caspase-2 is sufficient to induce cytochrome c release from mitochondria (18Robertson J.D. Enoksson M. Suomela M. Zhivotovsky B. Orrenius S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 29803-29809Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (360) Google Scholar). Previously, we have shown that caspase-2 localizes to the nucleus in a prodomain-dependent manner (7Colussi P.A. Harvey N.L. Kumar S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 24535-24542Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). Deletion of a 44-amino acid region containing a putative bipartite NLS was sufficient to interrupt nuclear localization of caspase-2. However, this region alone was not sufficient to direct nuclear import of GFP, suggesting the existence of additional or alternative NLSs in the caspase-2 prodomain (7Colussi P.A. Harvey N.L. Kumar S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 24535-24542Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). NLSs normally mediate nuclear entry by conferring interaction with the cellular nuclear import machinery (reviewed in Ref. 29Jans D.A. Lam M.H.C. Xiao C.-Y. Bioessays. 2000; 22: 532-544Crossref PubMed Scopus (478) Google Scholar). The best characterized pathway of nuclear protein import involves importin α/β recognition of “classical” NLSs, such as those described for the SV40 large T-antigen and retinoblastoma tumor suppressor protein (29Jans D.A. Lam M.H.C. Xiao C.-Y. Bioessays. 2000; 22: 532-544Crossref PubMed Scopus (478) Google Scholar). By binding to the NLS, importin-α captures the protein to be imported, whereas importin-β targets this complex to the nuclear pore (29Jans D.A. Lam M.H.C. Xiao C.-Y. Bioessays. 2000; 22: 532-544Crossref PubMed Scopus (478) Google Scholar). This study focuses on dissecting the functional regions of the caspase-2 prodomain that modulate nuclear transport and enzyme activation. By using various caspase-2 mutants, we define a classical NLS in the prodomain of mouse caspase-2 that contains a conserved Lys residue critical for its function. This newly characterized NLS is shown to be necessary and sufficient for nuclear transport of caspase-2. We provide evidence that this NLS strongly interacts with the importin α/β heterodimer, whereas a single point mutation abolishes binding, suggesting that caspase-2 is likely to be imported into the nucleus via the well characterized classical pathway in vivo. We also define a region in the prodomain at the N terminus of the CARD that regulates the formation of dots/filaments that correlate with the cell killing ability of caspase-2. WT and catalytically inactive C320G mutant mouse caspase-2 GFP and C2PD-GFP constructs have been described previously (7Colussi P.A. Harvey N.L. Kumar S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 24535-24542Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar, 15Colussi P.A. Harvey N.L. Shearwin-Whyatt L.M. Kumar S. J. Biol.

Cecconi F. Kuida K. Strasser A. Huang D.C. Kumar S. Cell Death Differ. 2002; 9: 832-841Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). Caspase-2 GFP fusions containing various prodomain deletions were generated by PCR amplification using Pfu polymerase, with either the wild-type (WT) or the catalytically inactive mutant (C320G) caspase-2 (11Kumar S. Kinoshita M. Noda M. Copeland N.G. Jenkins N.A. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 1613-1626Crossref PubMed Scopus (588) Google Scholar, 12Kumar S. Kinoshita M. Dorstyn L. Noda M. Cell Death Differ. 1997; 4: 378-387Crossref Scopus (28) Google Scholar, 30Dorstyn L. Kumar S. Cell Death Differ. 1997; 4: 570-579Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar) as a template and forward and reverse primers containingXhoI and BamHI restriction sites, respectively. Amplified products were subcloned into the GFP N-terminal fusion vector pEGFP-N1 (Clontech). To generate prodomain deletion mutants PDMΔ25, PDMΔ44, and PDMΔCARD, coding regions were amplified using appropriate primers. An initiation codon was engineered in the forward primers immediately 5′ of the codons encoding Ile26, Val45, and Leu122, respectively. To construct PDMΔLink, which contains only the CARD region (Met1–Thr121) and lacks the prodomain linker region (Leu122–Asp169), CARD was amplified and cloned into the XhoI and BamHI sites of pEGFP-N1. Next, the region encoding the caspase-2 p18 and p14 subunits (the caspase domain) was amplified and subcloned into theBamHI site of the CARD-GFP fusion construct resulting in an in-frame fusion of CARD with the caspase domain. Caspase-2 mutants containing a K152A substitution were created by PCR-based mutagenesis using WT or catalytically inactive caspase-2 GFP as templates. A chimeric construct consisting of the caspase-2 prodomain linker fused in-frame to the coding sequence of caspase-3 was constructed by PCR on the previously described C2P-caspase-3Δ9-GFP plasmid template (15Colussi P.A. Harvey N.L. Shearwin-Whyatt L.M. Kumar S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 26566-26570Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Bacterial expression plasmids encoding GFP-caspase-2 fusion proteins were derived using the GatewayTM technology (Invitrogen). DNA fragments encoding the caspase-2 prodomain (residues 19–167) or the caspase-2 linker (residues 122–167) were derived by PCR using either wild-type or mutant (K152A) plasmid DNA templates and appropriate primers. PCR fragments were gel-purified and then recombined successively with plasmid pDON201 (BP clonase reaction) and then pGFP-attC (LR clonase reaction) to yield the expression plasmids: pGFP-caspase-2 (residues 19–167), pGFP-caspase-2 (residues 19–167, K152A), pGFP-caspase-2 (residues 122–167), and pGFP-caspase-2 (residues 122–167, K152A). Plasmid pGFP-attC was derived previously from plasmid pTRCAgfp (31Forwood J.K. Harley V. Jans D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 46575-46582Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar) by restriction digestion and blunt end ligation of the appropriate cassette and the Gateway Plasmid Conversion Kit (Invitrogen) to enable an in-frame GFP fusion, containing a His6 tag at the N terminus. HA-tagged full-length caspase-2, PDMΔ25, and PDMΔ44 constructs were generated by amplifying DNA using the same forward primers as used for the GFP fusions and a reverse primer incorporating an HA tag. All HA-tagged constructs were amplified using the caspase-2 C320G catalytically inactive mutant as template. Amplified products were cloned into the XhoI and EcoRV restriction sites of the expression vector pcDNA3 (Invitrogen). NIH3T3 and COS cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium and HEK293T cells in 1640 RPMI, each supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. For cell death assays, 2 × 105 NIH3T3 cells were plated per 35-mm dish the day before transfection. GFP expression constructs (2 μg of total DNA) were transfected into cells using the FuGENE 6 reagent (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Cells were scored for apoptotic morphology 24 h after transfection using a fluorescence microscope (Olympus BH2-RFCA), as described previously (15Colussi P.A. Harvey N.L. Shearwin-Whyatt L.M. Kumar S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 26566-26570Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar, 16Shearwin-Whyatt L. Baliga B. Doumanis J. Kumar S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 282: 1114-1119Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). Cells transfected with GFP fusion constructs were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 30 min and then photographed using a camera mounted on the fluorescence microscope. A confocal microscope (Bio-Rad) was used to capture images for localization experiments. For immunoprecipitation experiments, 1.5 × 106 HEK293T cells were plated per 100-mm dish the day before transfection. Cells were transfected with 4 μg of total DNA (2 μg of each construct) as described above and harvested 24 h after transfection. His-tagged GFP fusion proteins were expressed essentially as described previously (31Forwood J.K. Harley V. Jans D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 46575-46582Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar) under denaturing conditions (8 m urea) followed by refolding on the nitrilotriacetic acid-affinity column. Caspase fusion proteins eluted at 200 mm imidazole. Proteins were subsequently dialyzed, concentrated using Centricons (30,000 molecular weight cut-off), and stored in small aliquots at −70 °C until use. Control molecules used were His6-tagged GFP alone and SV40 large T-antigen residues 111–135, including the importin α/β-recognized NLS (PKKKRKV132), fused to GFP, expressed from a construct generated in identical fashion to the caspase-2 constructs using the GatewayTM technology, except that plasmid pPR28 (32Rihs H.-P. Jans D.A. Fan H. Peters R. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 633-639Crossref PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar) was used as the PCR template. Mouse α1 and β1 importin proteins used in binding experiments were expressed as GST fusion proteins and purified by affinity chromatography (33Hu W. Jans D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 15820-15827Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Native gel electrophoresis followed by fluorimaging was performed as described previously (31Forwood J.K. Harley V. Jans D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 46575-46582Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). GFP fusion proteins (5–25 pmol), with or without preincubation (15 min, room temperature), with importins (α, β or predimerized α/β at a final concentration of 5–12.5 μm) in 25 μl were loaded onto 12% native polyacrylamide gels and electrophoresed at 80 V for 4–7 h at 4 °C. Subsequently, the positions of the GFP fusion proteins in the gel were determined by fluorescent gel imaging using a Wallac Arthur 1422 Multi-wavelength Fluorimager, using side illumination, and exposure times of 0.25–2 s. For immunoprecipitation, cells were lysed on ice in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 150 mmNaCl, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, and CompleteTM protease inhibitors (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Cellular debris was removed by centrifugation at 4 °C, and antibody binding was carried out overnight at 4 °C with 2 μg of an anti-GFP monoclonal antibody (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Antibody-protein complexes were precipitated with protein G-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences), and precipitated proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE and then transferred to polyvinylidine difluoride membrane. Blots were probed with an anti-HA monoclonal antibody (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) followed by anti-rat horseradish peroxidase-coupled secondary antibody (AmershamBiosciences). Signals were detected using the ECL system (AmershamBiosciences). The components of the yeast two-hybrid system were purchased from Clontech. Caspase-2 lacking the first 44 amino acids (PDMΔ44) was amplified and subcloned into the SmaI/BamHI restriction sites of the Gal4 DNA-binding domain vector, pAS2.1, and the Gal4 activation domain vector, pACT2. The pAS2.1-PDMΔ44 and pACT2-PDMΔ44 constructs were co-transformed into Saccharomyces cerevisiae strain Y190 as was pAS2.1-PDMΔ44 and empty pACT2 vector and pACT2-PDMΔ44 with empty pAS2.1 vector. Colonies containing both vectors were selected on SD medium lacking Leu and Trp as described previously (13Butt A.J. Harvey N.L. Parasivam G. Kumar S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 6763-6768Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Interacting fusion proteins were screened for β-galactosidase activity in a colony-lift filter assay using 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-β-d-galactopyranoside (X-gal) according to the instructions provided by Clontech. Positive and negative controls for two-hybrid assays were as described earlier (13Butt A.J. Harvey N.L. Parasivam G. Kumar S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 6763-6768Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). In previous studies (7Colussi P.A. Harvey N.L. Kumar S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 24535-24542Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar) we have shown that nuclear transport of caspase-2 is mediated by the prodomain region of the molecule. When ectopically expressed, caspase-2 concentrates in the nucleus of transfected cells in distinct structures resembling dots or filaments. A potential bipartite NLS identified in the N terminus of the caspase-2 prodomain was shown by us to be necessary but not sufficient for nuclear transport of caspase-2 (7Colussi P.A. Harvey N.L. Kumar S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 24535-24542Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar), suggesting the presence of an additional element(s) in the caspase-2 prodomain. The caspase-2 prodomain is 169 amino acids in length and consists of a 34-residue N-terminal region (Met1–Pro34), a CARD (Asp35–Thr121), and a 48-amino acid region (Leu122–Asp169) linking the CARD to the enzymatic domain encompassing the p18 and p14 subunits (Fig. 1 A). Because the first 34 amino acids in the prodomain do not appear to be involved in any specific function (7Colussi P.A. Harvey N.L. Kumar S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 24535-24542Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar, 12Kumar S. Kinoshita M. Dorstyn L. Noda M. Cell Death Differ. 1997; 4: 378-387Crossref Scopus (28) Google Scholar, 13Butt A.J. Harvey N.L. Parasivam G. Kumar S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 6763-6768Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar), we have divided the caspase-2 prodomain into two regions consisting of the CARD (Met1–Thr121) at the N terminus and the linker region at the C terminus (Leu122–Asp169). For localization studies, we generated a series of prodomain mutants containing a GFP tag at the C terminus (Fig. 1 B). To test whether the caspase-2 CARD alone is capable of mediating nuclear transport, we fused the mouse caspase-2 CARD directly to GFP and assessed the localization of the fusion protein in transfected COS cells. Unlike the caspase-2 prodomain-GFP fusion that forms elaborate filaments in the nucleus (Fig. 2 A), the CARD-GFP construct is predominantly localized as perinuclear filamentous structures (Fig. 2 B). Thus the CARD alone can not localize efficiently to the nucleus in the absence of the linker region, despite the fact that it contains the bipartite NLS. Indeed, when the CARD is fused directly to the caspase domains, deleting the linker region (PDMΔLink), the GFP fusion protein forms aggregates in the cytoplasm (Fig. 2 C), indicating that the CARD in conjunction with the caspase domains cannot mediate nuclear transport. On the other hand, a GFP fusion lacking the CARD but containing the linker region connected to the caspase domains (PDMΔCARD) localizes diffusely in the nucleus, in the absence of the previously characterized NLS (Fig. 2 D). To test further the ability of the linker region to direct nuclear transport, we fused the mouse caspase-2 linker region to caspase-3. Addition of the caspase-2 linker region to caspase-3 was sufficient to drive transport of the usually cytoplasmic caspase-3-GFP fusion protein wholly to the nucleus (Fig. 2, E and F), confirming that this region directs nuclear localization. Collectively, our localization data point to the linker region of mouse caspase-2 as containing an element(s) that is required for nuclear transport of caspase-2. Our deletion mutant analysis implicated a role for the linker region of the caspase-2 prodomain in mediating nuclear transport. An examination of the sequence of the caspase-2 prodomain linker region identified a putative NLS spanning residues 149–156 that is similar to the NLS of the c-Myc protein (29Jans D.A. Lam M.H.C. Xiao C.-Y. Bioessays. 2000; 22: 532-544Crossref PubMed Scopus (478) Google Scholar). This 8-amino acid region contains conserved Pro, Lys, and Leu residues (PPHKQLRL) that correspond to identical residues in c-Myc and that are conserved in human, rat, and mouse caspase-2 (Fig. 3 A). In order to determine whether this putative NLS is functional, we carried out site-directed mutagenesis studies. By analogy with the well characterized c-Myc NLS, we predicted that Lys152 would be a critical residue. Mouse caspase-2 mutants were generated in which this Lys152 residue was substituted with an Ala (K152A). In all cases, catalytically inactive forms of each fusion protein were used for localization studies to prevent cell killing. As shown in Fig. 3, K152A mutation resulted in a strikingly altered caspase-2 localization. Whereas caspase-2-GFP characteristically accumulates in the nucleus forming dots or filaments (Fig. 3 B), the mutant caspase-2-GFP (K152A) was mostly localized outside and exclusive of the nucleus, forming dot-like aggregates in the cytoplasm (Fig. 3 C). Interestingly, the K152A mutant retains the ability to form aggregates despite being restricted to the cytoplasm, suggesting that nuclear localization is not necessary for caspase-2 to form aggregates when overexpressed. To determine whether mutation of Lys152 also affects nuclear localization of the caspase-2 prodomain, we generated a mutant caspase-2 prodomain-GFP (K152A) construct and transfected it into COS cells. As mentioned before, caspase-2 prodomain-GFP forms elaborate filament-like structures in the nucleus of transfected COS cells (Fig. 3 D). Similar to the data obtained for the full-length molecule, K152A mutation resulted in caspase-2 prodom"
https://openalex.org/W2001296234,"ICAM-4 (LW blood group glycoprotein) is an erythroid-specific membrane component that belongs to the family of intercellular adhesion molecules and interacts in vitrowith different members of the integrin family, suggesting a potential role in adhesion or cell interaction events, including hemostasis and thrombosis. To evaluate the capacity of ICAM-4 to interact with platelets, we have immobilized red blood cells (RBCs), platelets, and ICAM-Fc fusion proteins to a plastic surface and analyzed their interaction in cell adhesion assays with RBCs and platelets from normal individuals and patients, as well as with cell transfectants expressing the αIIbβ3 integrin. The platelet fibrinogen receptor αIIbβ3 (platelet GPIIb-IIIa) in a high affinity state following GRGDSP peptide activation was identified for the first time as the receptor for RBC ICAM-4. The specificity of the interaction was demonstrated by showing that: (i) activated platelets adhered less efficiently to immobilized ICAM-4-negative than to ICAM-4-positive RBCs, (ii) monoclonal antibodies specific for the β3-chain alone and for a complex-specific epitope of the αIIbβ3integrin, and specific for ICAM-4 to a lesser extent, inhibited platelet adhesion, whereas monoclonal antibodies to GPIb, CD36, and CD47 did not, (iii) activated platelets from two unrelated type-I glanzmann's thrombasthenia patients did not bind to coated ICAM-4. Further support to RBC-platelet interaction was provided by showing that dithiothreitol-activated αIIbβ3-Chinese hamster ovary transfectants strongly adhere to coated ICAM-4-Fc protein but not to ICAM-1-Fc and was inhibitable by specific antibodies. Deletion of individual Ig domains of ICAM-4 and inhibition by synthetic peptides showed that the αIIbβ3 integrin binding site encompassed the first and second Ig domains and that the G65-V74 sequence of domain D1 might play a role in this interaction. Although normal RBCs are considered passively entrapped in fibrin polymers during thrombus, these studies identify ICAM-4 as the first RBC protein ligand of platelets that may have relevant physiological significance.

Although normal RBCs are considered passively entrapped in fibrin polymers during thrombus, these studies identify ICAM-4 as the first RBC protein ligand of platelets that may have relevant physiological significance. The main physiological function of red blood cells (RBCs), 1The abbreviations used are: RBCs, red blood cells; FBI, fibrinogen binding inhibitor; TSP, thrombospondin; vWF, von Willebrand Factor; mAb, monoclonal antibody; PGE1, prostaglandin-E1; TNF-α, tumor necrosis factor-α; HUVEC, human umbilical vein endothelium cells; DTT, dithiothreitol; CHO, Chinese hamster ovary; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline which encapsulate hemoglobin, is to ensure the respiratory gases transport throughout the human body. However, the recent demonstration that mature RBCs express a growing number of adhesion molecules, many of which exhibit blood group specificities (1Telen M.J. Semin. Hematol. 2000; 37: 130-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar, 2Spring F.A. Parsons S.F. Transfus. Med. Rev. 2000; 14: 351-363Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar, 3Cartron J.P. Colin Y. Transfus. Clin. Biol. 2001; 8: 163-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar), reinforces the necessity to revisit the functional interaction of RBCs with leukocytes, platelets, and vascular endothelium under normal and pathological conditions. It is interesting that many RBC adhesion molecules contain protein domains characteristic of the immunoglobulin superfamily, suggesting some recognition function. These molecules might participate in the normal RBC physiology by playing a role during erythropoiesis (differentiation, maturation, enucleation, release), self-recognition mechanisms, red cell turnover, and cell aging through cellular interactions with counter receptors present on macrophages from bone marrow or reticuloendothelial system in spleen and liver (1Telen M.J.

Along this process, some adhesion molecules are rapidly down-regulated and others are expressed at different stages and remain on RBCs (Refs.10Bony V. Gane P. Bailly P. Cartron J.P. Br. J. Haematol. 1999; 107: 263-274Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar and 11Southcott M.J. Tanner M.J. Anstee D.J. Blood. 1999; 93: 4425-4435Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, and references therein). Finally, mature RBCs still express adhesion molecules which are usually associated with leukocytes (CD44, CD47, CD58) and others that have potential adhesion properties such as LW/ICAM-4 (CD242), Lu (CD239), Oka (CD147), CD99/Xg, JMH (CD108), and DO (1Telen M.J. Semin. Hematol. 2000; 37: 130-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar, 2Spring F.A. Parsons S.F. Transfus. Med. Rev. 2000; 14: 351-363Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar, 3Cartron J.P.

Nevertheless, normal RBCs do not adhere to circulating cells and vessel walls under normal circumstances, suggesting that the RBC adhesion molecules are inaccessible to their ligands. In contrast, the conversion of non-adherent RBCs to adherent state arises in several diseases. In such circumstances, adhesion molecules might be involved in the pathophysiology of malaria (12Ward T.M. Chitnis C.E. Miller L.H. Baillère's Clin. Infect. Dis. 1994; 1: 155-190Google Scholar, 13Oh S.S. Chishti A.H. Palek J. Liu S.C. Curr. Opin. Hematol. 1997; 4: 148-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar), sickle cell disease (14Wick T.M.

Additionally, both phosphatidylserine exposure at the RBC surface and adhesion molecules on these cells might also play a role in hemostasis and thrombosis, for instance through interaction with cells expressing integrins, like activated leukocytes, monocytes, platelets, and endothelial cells (21Marcus A.J. Safier L.B. FASEB J. 1993; 7: 516-522Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar, 22Andrews D.A. Low P.S. Curr. Opin. Hematol. 1999; 6: 76-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar). Interestingly also, RBCs have the necessary signal transduction pathways to mediate these functions (23Minetti G. Low P.S. Curr. Opin. Hematol. 1997; 4: 116-121Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Among RBC adhesion molecules, ICAM-4 (LW blood group glycoprotein, CD242) emerges from the others by its structural similarities to the ICAM family and its interaction characterized in vitro with different members of the β integrin subfamilies (αLβ2(LFA-1), αMβ2 (Mac-1) (24Bailly P.

Ortlepp S. Olsson M.L. Sessions R. Brady R.L. Anstee D.J. Blood. 2001; 98: 458-466Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). These two families of proteins are well known to play crucial role in cell-cell interactions and to be involved in a large range of biological functions (28Springer T.A. Nature. 1990; 346: 425-434Crossref PubMed Scopus (5860) Google Scholar, 29Luscinskas F.W. Lawler J. FASEB J. 1994; 8: 929-938Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar, 30Gahmberg C.G. Tolvanen M.

For instance, ICAM-4/integrin interaction might play a role during erythroid maturation in bone-marrow or in the red cell turnover by spleen macrophages that express the αdβ2integrin (25Bailly P.

Additionally, ICAM-4 as well as the Lu blood group protein might be involved in adhesion of sickle RBCs to TNF-α-activated endothelial cells (HUVEC) (7Parsons S.F. Spring F.A. Chasis J.A. Anstee D.J.

It is suspected that abnormal adhesion of sickle RBCs to endothelial cells and extracellular matrix proteins might be responsible for the painful crisis of the disease that result from vaso-occlusive episodes (35Hebbel R.P.

The purpose of this report was to examine the potential role of ICAM-4 in RBC-platelet interaction and to demonstrate that this protein interacts in vitro with the high affinity state of activated platelet αIIbβ3 integrin. RBC from donors with common and rare phenotypes (Donull, Lunullof the Lu(a-b-) type, LWnull, JMHnull) came from the frozen RBC collection of the Centre National de Référence pour les Groupes Sanguins (Paris, France). Fresh blood samples from two unrelated type-I glanzmann's thrombasthenia patients were obtained after informed consent. Apyrase, prostaglandin-E1 (PGE1), thrombin from human origin and anti-glycophorin-A mAb (clone E4), and the peptide Arg-Gly-Glu (RGE) were purchased from Sigma. Peptides Gly-Arg-Gly-Asp-Ser-Pro (GRGDSP), Arg-Gly-Asp (RGD), and the fibrinogen binding inhibitor (FBI) peptide (residues 400–411 of the fibrinogen γ-chain; Fg) were from Bachem (Budendorf, Switzerland). Other peptides Gly-Trp-Val-Ser-Tyr-Gln-Leu-Leu-Asp-Val (Gly–Val, residues 65–74 of ICAM-4), Cys-His-Ala-Arg-Leu-Asn-Leu-Asp-Gly-Leu-Val-Val-Arg (C–R, residues 180–192 of ICAM-4) and corresponding random (rd) peptides used were synthesized and purified by Neosystem (Strasbourg, France). Specific mAbs used in this study include clones P2 and SZ22 recognizing the αIIb-chain (CD41) in the presence and the absence of the β3-chain, respectively, clones SZ21 and SZ2 specific for the β3-chain (CD61) and GpIb protein (CD42b), respectively, clone FA6.152 specific for CD36, and clone AICD58 specific for CD58, which were purchased from Coulter/Immunotech (Marseille, France). The mAb AP-2 specific for a complex-specific epitope of the αIIbβ3 integrin came from GTI (Brookfield, WI). PAC-1 and AK-4 mAbs specific for activated αIIbβ3 complex and P-selectin (CD62P), respectively, came from BD PharMingen (San Diego, CA). The mAb 3E12 to CD47 was from BioAtlantique (Nantes, France). The murine mAb BS56 to ICAM-4/LWab was previously described (36Sonneborn H.H. Ernst M. Voak D. Vox Sanguinis. 1994; 67: 114Google Scholar). ImmunoPure mouse IgG from Pierce was used as negative control IgG. Chimeric ICAM-pIgI constructs derived from intact ICAM-4 (LWa allele) carrying the two Ig-like domains D1 and D2 (residues 1–208), or deletion mutants D1-ICAM-4 (residues 1–101) or D2-ICAM-4/(residues 102–208) were used to produce soluble Fc-fusion proteins as described (26Hermand P.

ICAM-1- and ICAM-2-pIgI constructs (kindly provided by Dr. D. Simmons and E. Ferguson, Oxford, UK) were used to produce ICAM-Fc soluble fusion proteins as above. Human platelets were obtained from fresh ACD-anticoagulated blood from volunteers not taking any medication and were washed three times in modified Tyrode's albumin buffer (5 mm Hepes, 150 mm NaCl, 2.5 mm KCl, 12 mm NaHCO3, 5.5 mm glucose, 0.1% (w/v) bovine serum albumin (pH 6.5), 250 ng/ml PGE1, 25 μg/ml apyrase) by centrifugation at 1,200 × g for 10 min. Platelets were activated as previously described (37Du X.P. Plow E.F. Frelinger III, A.L. O'Toole T.E. Loftus J.C. Ginsberg M.H. Cell. 1991; 65: 409-416Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (419) Google Scholar, 38Xia Z. Frojmovic M.M. Biophys. J. 1994; 66: 2190-2201Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Briefly, 1 × 108washed platelets resuspended in 0.1 ml of Tyrode's-albumin buffer (pH 7.4) containing 2 mm CaCl2 and 1 mmMgCl2, were incubated at 22 °C for 5 min with 1 mm GRGDSP peptide. Then, an equal volume of phosphate-buffered saline (PBS, 10 mm phosphate buffer in 0.15 m NaCl, pH 7.2) containing PGE1 (250 ng/ml), apyrase (25 μg/ml), 2 mm CaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2, and 1% (w/v) paraformaldehyde, was added, and the mixture was incubated for 1 h at 22 °C. Then, 0.2 ml of 500 mm NH4Cl was added to stop the reaction in PBS. Fixed activated platelets were washed several times to remove the activating peptide prior to assays and resuspended in modified Tyrode's buffer, pH 7.4 containing divalent cations. Fixed unactivated platelets used as control, were prepared by omitting divalent cations and the activating peptide in the different buffers. RBCs were immobilized on microtiter plates through binding to coated anti-glycophorin A. Briefly, mAb E4 at 20 μg/ml (50 μl/well) in 25 mm Tris, pH 8, 150 mm NaCl, was adsorbed overnight at 4 °C on flat-bottom 96-well microtiter plates (Nunc A/S, Roskilde, Denmark). After two washes of wells with the same buffer, RBCs (2.0 × 106/well in a final volume of 300 μl) resuspended in modified Tyrode's buffer, pH 7.4 with or without cations (2 mm MgCl2 and 2 mmCaCl2) were added. After 1 h of incubation at 22 °C, fixed GRGDSP-activated or unactivated platelets (5.0 × 106/well in a final volume of 100 μl) in modified Tyrode's buffer, pH 7.4 with or without divalent cations, respectively, were added to RBC-coated wells. After 90 min at 22 °C, non-adherent cells were removed by filling the wells with binding buffer, and the microplates were put to float upside down in a PBS solution. Cells that adhered to the plastic wells were recovered by vigorous shaking in 400 μl of PBS and were counted by flow cytometric analysis using a FACSCalibur. Platelets and RBCs were distinguished by forward scatters and platelet staining with the fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-anti-human CD61 mAb (clone VI-PL2, BD Biosciences). Following isolation, unactivated platelets (1 × 107/well in a final volume of 100 μl) resuspended in RPMI 1640, 10 mm Hepes containing PGE1 and apyrase were added to wells to adhere overnight at 37 °C. After washing, adherent platelets were stimulated with thrombin (0.5 unit in 100 μl/well) diluted in Hanks' Balanced Salts (HBSS) containing 2 mm CaCl2 for 20 min at room temperature. After another washing, RBCs (3.3 × 106/well in a final volume of 300 μl) resuspended in HBSS with 2 mm CaCl2, 1 mmMgCl2, were added to each well. After 90 min at 22 °C, non-adherent RBCs were removed by filling the wells with binding buffer, and the microplates were put to float upside down in a PBS solution. Then RBCs numeration was done using a Nikon Eclipse TE300 microscope (Nikon, Paris, France) (×10 objective) coupled to a Biocom informatic system of images integration (Biocom, les Ulis, France). For blocking experiments, RBCs and adherent platelets stimulated by thrombin were pretreated with specific mAbs (2.5 μg/well) and ICAM-Fc protein (2.5 μg/well), respectively, for 30 min at 22 °C. The Chinese hamster ovary cell line (CHO) was grown in Iscove's modified Dulbecco medium with Glutamax-1 (Invitrogen) supplemented with amphotericin-B-penicillin-streptamycin and 10% fetal calf serum. CD41 (αIIb-chain) and CD61 (β3-chain) cDNAs subcloned into pcDNA3.1 vector (Invitrogen), kindly provided by Dr. P. J. Newman (Blood Center of Southeastern Wisconsin, Milwaukee, WI), were cotransfected into CHO cells using the lipofectin reagent according to the manufacturer's instructions (Invitrogen). Stable transformants resistant to G418 (0.6 mg/ml of geneticin) were selected for CD41 and CD61 expression by immuno-magnetic separation using mAb AP-2 and magnetic beads coated with anti-mouse IgG (Dynabeads-M-450, DYNAL, Oslo, Norway). CD41 and CD61 expression of stable clones was analyzed and quantified by flow cytometric analysis with Qifikit calibration beads, used according to the manufacturer's instructions (Dako, Denmark). One clone with the strongest expression of αIIbβ3 integrin was selected. For adhesion assays, αIIbβ3-CHO transfectant and wild-type (parental) CHO cells were treated with or without 10 mm DTT in RPMI 1640, 10 mm Hepes, at 22 °C for 20 min to activate the αIIbβ3complex receptor (39Zucker M.B. Masiello N.C. Thromb. Haemost. 1984; 51: 119-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Purified ICAM-Fc proteins diluted in 25 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 2 mm MgCl2, and 2 mm CaCl2, were absorbed to flat-bottom 96-well microtiter plates overnight at 4 °C, at 2.5–20 μg/ml (50 μl/well in triplicate). The wells were then blocked for 2 h at 22 °C with 1% nonfat milk in the same buffer. For adhesion assays, either fixed GRGDSP-activated or unactivated platelets (5 × 106/well in a final volume of 100 μl) in modified Tyrode's buffer, pH 7.4, with or without divalent cations, respectively, wild-type CHO cells, DTT-activated or unactivated αIIbβ3-CHO transfectants (1 × 105/well in a final volume of 100 μl) resuspended in RPMI 1640, 10 mm Hepes containing 2 mmMgCl2 and 2 mm CaCl2, were added to the coated wells and incubated for 90 min at 22 °C. Non-adherent cells were removed by washings before microscopic observation and CHO cell numeration was done as indicated above. Platelets were counted by flow cytometric analysis as above. For blocking experiments, the cells were pretreated with specific peptides and their corresponding random counterpart (125 μm final concentration) or with different mAbs (5 μg for 5 × 106 platelets or 1 × 105 CHO cells/100 μl) for 30 min at 22 °C prior addition to protein-coated wells. To analyze molecular events occurring during RBC-platelet interaction, in vitrocell adhesion assays were developed using RBCs from donors of common and rare phenotypes immobilized to plastic surface via anti-GPA binding and platelets from normal healthy donors, pretreated or not with the synthetic GRGDSP peptide in the presence of inhibitors of platelet activation, thus resulting in specific αIIbβ3 integrin activation and the acquisition of high affinity Fg-binding state without addition of a cellular agonist (37Du X.P.

Accordingly, in addition to bind Fg, GRGDSP-treated platelets reacted strongly with the mAb PAC-1, which binds to the activated αIIbβ3 complex (40Abrams C.S. Ellison N. Budzynski A.Z. Shattil S.J.

Science. 1992; 258: 964-969Crossref PubMed Scopus (1153) Google Scholar), which binds to P-selectin normally contained in intracellular α-granules (not shown). As shown in Fig. 1, GRGDSP-activated platelets adhered more efficiently than unactivated platelets to immobilized ICAM-4-positive RBCs from control donors. The 100% relative binding was equivalent to 220 ± 100 GRGDSP-activated platelets adhered to 1.0 × 103 immobilized RBCs. When unactivated platelets were used as control, a 69% reduced adhesion was noted that corresponded to a mean background of 31 ± 12%. As preliminary assays showed that similar results were obtained with fresh and unfrozen RBCs (not shown), the following studies were performed with unthawed RBCs since rare RBC variants lacking different membrane proteins were available from our frozen collection. Activated platelets bind to coated RBCs lacking the blood group proteins Lu (CD239, laminin receptor of 78–85 kDa), JMH (CD108, 80 kDa), and DO (ADP-ribosyltransferase 4 of 47–67 kDa) but expressing normal levels of ICAM-4, as efficiently as would normal ICAM-4-positive RBCs. Interestingly, when ICAM-4 negative (LWnull) RBCs lacking of the ICAM-4/LW glycoprotein (42 kDa) from three unrelated donors were coated to plastic wells, a 40% decrease binding of GRGDSP-activated platelets was observed after deduction of the mean background corresponding to the unactivated platelet adhesion to all types of RBCs (p < 0.001 versus unactivated platelets and p < 0.05 versuscontrols). To confirm that ICAM-4 plays a role in RBC-platelet interactions, RBC adhesion on adherent platelets stimulated by thrombin, a more physiologically relevant platelet activator than the RGDS peptide, was also analyzed although in this assay platelets are more activated with α-granule release than GRGDSP-activated platelets (see above). Although ICAM-4-positive RBCs did not bind to unstimulated adherent platelets in the presence of PGE1 and apyrase (not shown), they bind strongly to thrombin-stimulated platelets (Fig. 2). This binding was efficiently decrease to 50 ± 9% and 11 ± 1% by mAb BS56 and soluble ICAM-4-Fc protein, respectively, whereas the mAb AICD58 reacting with the erythroid membrane CD58 protein and the soluble ICAM-2-Fc protein had only a minor inhibitory effect (88 ± 4 and 85 ± 7%, respectively). Similarly, mAbs anti-RhD (LOR-15C9), anti-Fy6 (BAM9917) and anti-MER2 (1D12 or 2F7) directed against various RBC surface membrane proteins did not exhibit any effect (not shown). Unfortunately, the nonspecific adherence of frozen RBCs in this assay made impossible the comparative analysis between the ICAM-4-positive and -negative RBCs. Altogether, these data suggests that ICAM-4 might take a significant part (about 50%) in the adhesion of RBCs to activated platelets. As the GRGDSP peptide is a trigger of a high affinity state of αIIbβ3 integrin, which mediates Fg binding and platelet aggregation (37Du X.P. Plow E.F. Frelinger III, A.L. O'Toole T.E. Loftus J.C. Ginsberg M.H. Cell. 1991; 65: 409-416Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (419) Google Scholar), our data suggested that ICAM-4 might interact with αIIbβ3 integrin but also with other adhesive molecules. To obtain further evidence that ICAM-4 might interact with a high affinity state of αIIbβ3 integrin, type-I glanzmann's thrombastenia platelets from two unrelated patients who both exhibit a 6-bp deletion in exon 7 of the β3 gene (42Morel-Kopp M.C. Kaplan C. Proulle V. Jallu V. Melchior C. Peyruchaud O. Aurousseau M.H. Kieffer N. Blood. 1997; 90: 669-677Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), were used for cell adhesion assays to coated ICAM-4-Fc protein. Fig. 3 A shows that unactivated platelets from normal control donors did not bind to immobilized ICAM-4-Fc, as expected from above data, whereas the same platelets activated by the GRGDSP peptide bound readily to coated ICAM-4-Fc, but not to immobilized ICAM-1. The 100% relative binding of GRGDSP-activated platelets to ICAM-4-Fc was equivalent to 12.5 ± 3.0% of the total added platelets. Conversely, platelets from the thrombasthenic patients type 1 with a severe defect of αIIbβ3 integrin surface expression, either unactivated (not shown) or GRGDSP-activated, failed to bind to coated ICAM-4-Fc (Fig. 3 A). In order to determine the specificity of these interactions, the effect of different mAbs and synthetic peptides on the platelet adhesion to immobilized ICAM-4-Fc protein was investigated (Fig. 3 B). Adhesion of activated platelets from normal control donors was efficiently blocked (approximately, 70 and 60%, respectively) by P2 and AP2 mAbs specific for the αIIb-chain in the presence of the β3-chain and the complex-specific epitope of the αIIbβ3 integrin, respectively. SZ21 and SZ22 mAbs that recognize the β3- and αIIb-chains alone, respectively, and the BS56 mAb specific for ICAM-4, partially but significantly inhibited the interaction between ICAM-4 and activated platelets, whereas the SZ2 mAb directed against the GPIb platelet glycoprotein and the control mouse IgG had no significant effect (Fig. 3 B). In addition, mAbs FA6 and 3E12 directed against CD36 and CD47, respectively, did not inhibit the platelet-ICAM-4 interaction. Blocking experiments by synthetic peptides revealed that the RGD peptide that binds to αIIbβ3 integrin and inhibits Fg binding, strongly reduced by 75% the adhesion of activated platelets to ICAM-4, whereas the RGE peptide had no effect. To provide further evidence that ICAM-4 may interact with the αIIbβ3 integrin, stable CHO transfectants expressing recombinant human αIIbβ3 were generated and used in cell adhesion assays (Fig. 4). Several αIIbβ3-CHO transfectants were obtained, and one clone expressing a high level of αIIbβ3integrin (αIIb, 18,600 molecules/cell and β3, 67,000 molecules/cell, as estimated by flow cytometric analysis with specific mAbs) was chosen for further studies. The αIIbβ3 integrin of these cells was activated by DTT treatment and the adhesion of DTT-activated and unactivated αIIbβ3-CHO transfectants to immobilized ICAM-4-Fc was examined (Fig. 4). In a preliminary experiment we found that these cells also reacted with PCA-1 mAb that recognized the activated αIIbβ3 integrin complex (not shown). DTT-activated αIIbβ3-CHO trans"

Here we describe the muscle-specific intermediate filament protein desmin as a novel caspase substrate. Desmin is cleaved selectively at a conserved Asp residue in its L1-L2 linker domain (VEMD↓M264) by caspase-6 in vitro and in myogenic cells undergoing apoptosis. We demonstrate that caspase cleavage of desmin at Asp263 has important functional consequences, including the production of an amino-terminal cleavage product, N-desmin, which is unable to assemble into intermediate filaments, instead forming large intracellular aggregates. Moreover, N-desmin functions as a dominant-negative inhibitor of filament assembly, both for desmin and the structurally related intermediate filament protein vimentin. We also show that stable expression of a caspase cleavage-resistant desmin D263E mutant partially protects cells from tumor necrosis factor-α-induced apoptosis. Taken together, these results indicate that caspase proteolysis of desmin at Asp263produces a dominant-negative inhibitor of intermediate filaments and actively participates in the execution of apoptosis.

Each of these intermediate filament proteins is cleaved at a conserved Asp residue in its L1-L2 linker domain by caspase-6 (and/or other caspases). Because several other intermediate filament proteins, including desmin, also contain a consensus caspase-6 cleavage motif (VEXD) (18Talanian R.V. Quinlan C. Trautz S. Hackett M.C. Mankovich J.A.

Milner D. Subcell. Biochem. 1998; 31: 463-495PubMed Google Scholar). Indeed, recent studies indicate that desmin is essential for both the structural integrity and the survival of muscle cells. Desmin-deficient mice develop a progressive and fatal generalized myopathy, which affects cardiac, skeletal, and smooth muscles and is characterized by myofibril disarray and accelerated muscle cell death. These abnormalities are particularly prominent in the myocardium, resulting in heart failure (21Milner D.J. Weitzer G. Tran D. Bradley A. Capetanaki Y. J.

In addition, mutations of the desmin gene have been identified in patients with a familial generalized myopathy that closely resembles the myopathy seen in desmin-deficient mice and in patients with idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy (25Goldfarb L.

Many of these mutations encode a desmin gene product that is unable to assemble into intermediate filaments; these mutant desmin proteins form intracellular aggregates/inclusions in muscle cells. These findings underscore the importance of desmin in muscle function and survival.Here we report for the first time that desmin is cleaved specifically by caspase-6 at VEMD↓M264 in its L1-L2 linker domainin vitro and in myogenic cells induced to undergo apoptosis by treatment with tumor necrosis factor (TNF)1-α. Caspase proteolysis of desmin at Asp263 produces an amino-terminal cleavage product that functions as a dominant-negative inhibitor of intermediate filament assembly. Furthermore, we show that a caspase cleavage-resistant desmin mutant partly protects against TNF-α-induced apoptosis, thereby indicating that caspase cleavage of desmin is a functionally relevant proteolytic event during the induction of apoptosis.DISCUSSIONWe have identified the muscle-specific intermediate filament protein desmin as a novel caspase substrate that is selectively proteolyzed by caspase-6 at a highly conserved Asp residue in its L1-L2 linker domain (VEMD↓M264) in vitro and in apoptotic myogenic cells. The P1–P4 positions of this substrate recognition sequence (VEMD) in desmin have been conserved absolutely from chicken to man and match the VEXD consensus caspase-6 cleavage motif (18Talanian R.V. Quinlan C. Trautz S. Hackett M.C. Mankovich J.A. Banach D. Ghayur T. Brady K.D. Wong W.W. J. Biol.

Interestingly, a similar or identical caspase-6 cleavage motif is present in each of the intermediate filament proteins previously demonstrated to be caspase substrates: the nuclear lamins (VE(I/V)D), cytokeratin 14 (VEMD), cytokeratins 18 and 19 (VEVD), and vimentin (IDVD) (11Rao L.

Of these substrates, all but the lamins and desmin also are cleaved by other caspases at sites outside the L1-L2 linker domain. Together with our results, these findings strongly suggest that caspase-6 may play a specialized role in the proteolytic dismantling of the intermediate filament network. This notion is supported by the recent demonstration of defects in lamin (A/C) cleavage, chromatin condensation, and apoptotic body formation in nuclei that were added to apoptotic extracts lacking caspase-6 (36Ruchaud S. Korfali N. Villa P. Kottke T.J. Dingwall C. Kaufmann S.H. Earnshaw W.C. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 1967-1977Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar).We also have demonstrated that caspase proteolysis of desmin has profound effects on its ability to assemble into intermediate filaments. Indeed, the amino-terminal caspase cleavage product (N-desmin encoding amino acids 1–263) is completely unable to assemble into filaments and forms intracellular aggregates/inclusions. These desmin aggregates morphologically are very similar to those formed by caspase-cleaved cytokeratins and vimentin (13Caulı́n C. Salvesen G.S. Oshima R.G. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 138: 1379-1394Crossref PubMed Scopus (542) Google Scholar, 17Byun Y. Chen F. Chang R. Trivedi M. Green K.J. Cryns V.L.

Cell Biol. 2002; 158: 1051-1066Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). The cytokeratin aggregates have been studied most extensively and contain activated caspase-3, the putative scaffold proteins DEDD and DEDD2, and cytokeratins 8, 18, and 19, in addition to caspase-cleaved cytokeratin 18 (37, 38). Although the other components of the aggregates formed by N-desmin are currently unknown, they likely contain the small heat shock protein αB-crystallin, a molecular chaperone that binds to desmin and other intermediate filament proteins (39Quinlan R. Van Den Ijssel P. Nat. Med. 1999; 5: 25-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Interestingly, mutations in either desmin (predominantly in the carboxyl terminus) or αB-crystallin result in similar appearing cytoplasmic aggregates composed of desmin and αB-crystallin in muscle cells of individuals with desmin-related myopathies (26Muñoz-Mármol A.

Nat. Genet. 1998; 20: 92-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (961) Google Scholar).Furthermore, we have shown that N-desmin interferes in a dominant-negative fashion with the assembly of WT desmin and vimentin into intermediate filaments. In this way, proteolytic production of even a small amount of N-desmin likely would have a substantial deleterious impact on the intermediate filament network. Importantly, our results are entirely consistent with earlier studies using an arbitrarily truncated desmin cDNA (encoding amino acids 1–272 of hamster desmin); expression of this cDNA in cultured skeletal myoblasts or in muscles of transgenic animals led to the formation of aggregates and the disassembly of the desmin and vimentin intermediate filament networks (41Schultheiss T. Lin Z. Ishikawa H. Zamir I. Stoeckert C. Holtzer H. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 114: 953-966Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar, 42Raats J. Schaart G. Henderik J. van der Kemp A. Dunia I. Benedetti E. Pieper F. Ramaekers F. Bloemendal H. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 71: 221-236PubMed Google Scholar). Moreover, expression of this truncated hamster desmin cDNA in the PtK2 epithelial cell line led to the disruption of cytokeratin filaments as well as the desmin and vimentin cytoskeletal networks (43Yu K. Hijikata T. Lin Z. Sweeney H. Englander S. Holtzer H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 2497-2501Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Although it seems plausible that N-desmin likewise may disrupt cytokeratin assembly, we have not yet examined this potential interaction experimentally. Nevertheless, our results indicate that the proteolytic removal of the carboxyl terminus of desmin by caspases generates a dominant-negative inhibitor of both desmin and vimentin filament assembly, a potent and parsimonious strategy to potentially dismantle multiple intermediate filament networks during the induction of apoptosis. As noted, the concept that truncated desmin can disrupt the intermediate filament cytoskeleton in a dominant-negative manner (41Schultheiss T. Lin Z. Ishikawa H. Zamir I. Stoeckert C. Holtzer H. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 114: 953-966Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar, 42Raats J. Schaart G. Henderik J. van der Kemp A. Dunia I. Benedetti E. Pieper F. Ramaekers F. Bloemendal H. Eur. J.

A. 1994; 91: 2497-2501Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar) is not a new one; however, the findings presented here provide the first evidence for the production of such an inhibitor during apoptosis in vivo.In addition, our observation that a caspase cleavage-resistant desmin mutant (D263E) partially protects cells from TNF-α-induced apoptosis clearly indicates that caspase proteolysis of desmin is a functionally relevant event in the execution of apoptotic cell death. How might caspase cleavage of desmin promote apoptosis? We previously have demonstrated that caspase proteolysis of vimentin produces a pro-apoptotic amino-terminal product that is sufficient to induce cell death (17Byun Y. Chen F. Chang R. Trivedi M. Green K.J. Cryns V.L. Cell Death Differ. 2001; 8: 443-450Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar). In contrast, neither of the desmin cleavage products significantly induced apoptosis in myogenic H9c2 cells in transient transfection experiments. Indeed, the vast majority of myoblasts transfected with N-desmin were still viable at 72 h despite the presence of extensive aggregates (data not shown). These findings are in agreement with those of Schultheiss et al. (41Schultheiss T. Lin Z. Ishikawa H. Zamir I. Stoeckert C. Holtzer H. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 114: 953-966Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar), who demonstrated that expression of a similarly truncated hamster desmin cDNA (encoding amino acids 1–272) in chicken skeletal myoblasts is well tolerated for up to 2 weeks in culture, despite the complete disruption of the intermediate filament network. Although we cannot exclude the possibility that N-desmin (or C-desmin) might sensitize muscle cells to the induction of apoptosis by oxidative stress or other apoptotic signals, our results argue against a potent direct pro-apoptotic function for either desmin cleavage product.Instead, the findings presented here suggest that caspase cleavage of desmin impairs, in some way, its pro-survival function. In support of this model is the observation that mice deficient in desmin develop a generalized myopathy, especially prominent in cardiac muscle, that is characterized by a disruption of the lateral alignment of myofibrils and a dramatic increase in cardiac myocyte cell death, ultimately leading to heart failure (21Milner D.J.

One potential mechanism linking these structural deficits to cell death is the observation that the mitochondria of desmin-deficient mice are morphologically abnormal with matrix swelling and degeneration; furthermore, the mitochondria are defective in ADP-stimulated respiratory function in vivo (44Milner D.J. Mavroidis M. Weisleder N. Capetanaki Y. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 150: 1283-1298Crossref PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar). Given the central role of the mitochondria in stress-induced apoptosis (1Cryns V.L. Yuan J. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 1551-1570Crossref PubMed Scopus (1160) Google Scholar), these mitochondrial defects stemming from desmin deficiency or potentially resulting from caspase cleavage of desmin could promote muscle cell death. Moreover, desmin (or vimentin in mesenchymal cells) is tightly associated with the nuclear matrix via binding to lamin B (45Georgatos S.D. Weber K. Geisler N. Blobel G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 6780-6784Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar, 46Luderus M.E. den Blaauwen J.L. de Smit O.J. Compton D.A. van Driel R. Mol. Cell.

Hence, caspase proteolysis of desmin may be important for the apoptotic disassembly of the nuclear envelope, as has been previously demonstrated for caspase cleavage of the nuclear lamins and vimentin (9Lazebnik Y.A.

Alternatively, desmin may sequester components of the TNF-α apoptotic signaling pathway, such as TRADD or TNFR2 (or others), that have been shown to interact with cytokeratins, thereby negatively regulating TNF-α-induced apoptosis (48Caulin C. Ware C.F. Magin T.M. Oshima R.G. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 149: 17-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar, 49Inada H. Izawa I. Nishizawa M. Fujita E. Kiyono T. Takahashi T. Momoi T. Inagaki M. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 155: 415-426Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). Regardless of the mechanism(s), the results presented here indicate that caspase cleavage of desmin is a functionally important molecular event in apoptosis, producing a truncated desmin protein that disrupts intermediate filaments. Caspases are a novel family of pro-apoptotic proteases that dismantle and reorganize the cytoskeleton and nucleus during the execution of apoptosis by specifically proteolyzing proteins at Asp residues (1Cryns V.L. Yuan J. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 1551-1570Crossref PubMed Scopus (1160) Google Scholar, 2Thornberry N.A. Lazebnik Y. Science. 1998; 281: 1312-1316Crossref PubMed Scopus (6132) Google Scholar). For example, caspase proteolysis of ROCK1 promotes the phosphorylation of myosin light chain and triggers membrane blebbing (3Sebbagh M. Renvoize C. Hamelin J. Riche N. Bertoglio J. Breard J. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 346-352Crossref PubMed Scopus (691) Google Scholar, 4Coleman M.L. Sahai E.A. Yeo M. Bosch M. Dewar A. Olson M.F. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 339-345Crossref PubMed Scopus (959) Google Scholar). In addition, caspase cleavage of actin, the actin-severing protein gelsolin, or Gas2 directly induces the disassembly of the actin microfilament network (5Kayalar C. Örd T. Testa M.P. Zhong L.-T.

Similarly, caspase proteolysis of several intermediate filament proteins, including the nuclear lamins and the tissue-specific cytokeratins 14, 18, and 19 (epithelial cells) and vimentin (mesenchymal cells), leads to the disassembly of the nuclear envelope and the cytosolic intermediate filament network that links the nucleus to the plasma membrane (9Lazebnik Y.A.

Each of these intermediate filament proteins is cleaved at a conserved Asp residue in its L1-L2 linker domain by caspase-6 (and/or other caspases). Because several other intermediate filament proteins, including desmin, also contain a consensus caspase-6 cleavage motif (VEXD) (18Talanian R.V. Quinlan C. Trautz S. Hackett M.C. Mankovich J.A.

Desmin is an abundant muscle-specific protein that polymerizes to form an extensive network of 10-nm intermediate filaments that span the nuclear envelope to the sarcolemma and link myofibrils together laterally at Z discs (20Capetanaki Y. Milner D. Subcell. Biochem. 1998; 31: 463-495PubMed Google Scholar). Indeed, recent studies indicate that desmin is essential for both the structural integrity and the survival of muscle cells. Desmin-deficient mice develop a progressive and fatal generalized myopathy, which affects cardiac, skeletal, and smooth muscles and is characterized by myofibril disarray and accelerated muscle cell death. These abnormalities are particularly prominent in the myocardium, resulting in heart failure (21Milner D.J. Weitzer G. Tran D. Bradley A. Capetanaki Y. J.

In addition, mutations of the desmin gene have been identified in patients with a familial generalized myopathy that closely resembles the myopathy seen in desmin-deficient mice and in patients with idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy (25G"
https://openalex.org/W2087734679,"Bcl-2 family members have been shown to be key mediators of apoptosis as either pro- or anti-apoptotic factors. It is thought that both classes of Bcl-2 family members act at the level of the mitochondria to regulate apoptosis, although the founding anti-apoptotic family member, Bcl-2 is localized to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), mitochondrial, and nuclear membranes. In order to better understand the effect of Bcl-2 localization on its activity, we have utilized a Bcl-2 mutant that localizes only to the ER membrane, designated Bcl-2Cb5. Bcl-2Cb5 was expressed in MDA-MB-468 cells, which protected against apoptosis induced by the kinase inhibitor, staurosporine. Data presented here show that Bcl-2Cb5 inhibits this process by blocking Bax activation and cytochrome<i>c</i> release. Furthermore, we show that Bcl-2Cb5 can inhibit the activation of a constitutively mitochondrial mutant of Bax, indicating that an intermediate between Bcl-2 on the ER and Bax on the mitochondria must exist. We demonstrate that this intermediate is likely a BH3-only subfamily member. Data presented here show that Bcl-2Cb5 can sequester a constitutively active form of Bad (Bad3A) from the mitochondria and prevent it from activating Bax. These data suggest that Bcl-2 indirectly protects mitochondrial membranes from Bax, via BH3-only proteins."
https://openalex.org/W2021528631,"TRBP (HIV-1 transactivating response (TAR) RNA-binding protein) and PKR, the interferon-induced dsRNA-regulated protein kinase, contain two dsRNA binding domains. They both bind to HIV-1 TAR RNAs through different sites. Binding to dsRNA activates PKR that phosphorylates the eukaryotic initiation factor eIF-2α leading to protein synthesis inhibition. TRBP and PKR can heterodimerize, which inhibits the kinase function of PKR and has a positive effect on HIV-1 expression. In this study, an in vitro reticulocyte assay revealed the poor expression of TAR containing CAT RNAs compared with CAT RNAs. Addition of TRBP restored translation efficiency of TAR-CAT RNA and decreased the phosphorylation status of eIF-2α, confirming its role as a PKR inhibitor. Unexpectedly, eIF-2α was phosphorylated in the presence of TAR-CAT as well as CAT RNA devoid of the TAR structure. TRBP inhibited eIF-2α phosphorylation in both cases, suggesting that it restores the translation of TAR-CAT RNA independently and in addition to its ability to inhibit PKR. TRBP activity on gene expression was then analyzed in a PKR-free environment using PKR-deficient murine embryo fibroblasts. In a transient reporter gene assay, TRBP stimulated the expression of a TAR-containing luciferase 3.8-fold whereas the reporter gene with mutated TAR structures or devoid of TAR was stimulated 1.5- to 2.4-fold. Overall, the activity of TRBP2 was higher when the 5′-end of the mRNA was structured and was mediated independently by each dsRBD in TRBP. Increasing concentrations of TRBP showed no significant modification of the luciferase RNA levels, suggesting that TRBP stimulates translation of TAR-containing RNAs. Therefore, TRBP is an important cellular factor for efficient translation of dsRNA containing transcripts, both by inhibiting PKR and in a PKR-independent pathway.

They are identical but for an alternative first exon that arises from the use of a second internal promoter in the first intron of TRBP1. TRBP2 is the longer isoform and has 21 additional amino acids at its N terminus (2Duarte M. Graham K. Daher A. Battisti P.L. Bannwarth S. Segeral E. Jeang K.T. Gatignol A. J. Biomed.

TRBP1 and TRBP2 each contain two double-stranded RNA binding domains (dsRBD), although dsRBD1 binds RNA with low affinity whereas dsRBD2 binds TAR with high affinity because of the presence of a KR helix motif (5Daviet L.

TRBPs, its dsRBD2, and a 24-amino acid TRBP peptide corresponding to the KR helix motif bind to two different sites of the highly ordered RNA structures of TAR. One site of high affinity is located between the bulge and the loop, and a second site of low affinity is located within the stem structure (1Gatignol A. Buckler-White A. Berkhout B. Jeang K.T.

Once phosphorylated, eIF-2α prevents translation initiation (10Hershey J.W. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1991; 60: 717-755Crossref PubMed Scopus (840) Google Scholar, 11Pain V.M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 236: 747-771Crossref PubMed Scopus (636) Google Scholar). As a dsRNA-binding protein, PKR, also binds TAR RNA, which leads to its activation as a kinase (12Maitra R.K. McMillan N.A. Desai S. McSwiggen J. Hovanessian A.G. Sen G. Williams B.R. Silverman R.H. Virology. 1994; 204: 823-827Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). The PKR/TAR interaction can be displaced by the addition of a 60-amino acid synthetic peptide corresponding to residues of the first dsRBD present in PKR (13Nekhai S. Kumar A. Bottaro D.P. Petryshyn R. Virology. 1996; 222: 193-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). The integrity of the stem structure of TAR is required for its interaction with PKR. TAR mutants whose structure is disrupted are no longer able to bind to and activate PKR (14Roy S. Agy M. Hovanessian A.G. Sonenberg N. Katze M.G. J. Virol. 1991; 65: 632-640Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).TRBP has been reported to behave as an inhibitor of PKR. By cotransfection analysis, TRBP was found to enhance the translational efficiency of DHFR mRNAs and to restore vaccinia protein synthesis in E3L-vaccinia mutant-infected cells (15Park H. Davies M.V.

Yeast two-hybrid assays as well as Far-Western techniques showed heterodimerization between PKR and TRBP and conveyed the idea that PKR and TRBP need dsRNA as a bridge for their mutual interaction (16Cosentino G.P.

The ability of TRBP to inhibit PKR activity was confirmed by overexpression of TRBP cloned into thenef gene of the HIV-1 genome. This allowed the virus to escape the PKR-mediated inhibition of virus replication. In addition, this work demonstrated that PKR and TRBP can heterodimerize in the absence of dsRNA (17Benkirane M.

These activities include its binding to HIV-1 TAR RNA and PKR inhibition and activation of HIV LTR expression. Recent data indicate a direct correlation between a weak expression of TRBP and a low HIV replication in astrocytoma cells, which suggests a major role in viral expression (4Bannwarth S. Talakoub L.

PRBP, the murine homologue of TRBP, binds the 3′-UTR of Prm1 protamine RNA, regulates its translation and plays a physiological role in spermatogenesis (20Lee K. Fajardo M.A. Braun R.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 3023-3034Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar, 21Zhong J. Peters A.H. Lee K. Braun R.E. Nat. Genet. 1999; 22: 171-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). Mice that carry a targeted disruption of the tarbp2 gene have a growth defect, are sterile, and severely oligospermic. Xlrbpa, theXenopus homologue of TRBP, is associated with ribosomes and hnRNPs (22Eckmann C.R. Jantsch M.F. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 138: 239-253Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). These data point to a stimulatory role of TRBP on translation by a direct activation through its RNA binding properties and/or through its inhibitory effect on PKR.Here, we have analyzed the effect of TRBP on the in vitrotranslation of CAT RNAs with or without the HIV-1 TAR structure at their 5′-end. The ability of TRBP to inhibit PKR was also monitored by analyzing the phosphorylation state of the endogenous eIF-2α present in the reticulocytes used for the translation. Finally, the effect of TRBP and its different domains on the expression of different TAR transcripts was analyzed in a PKR-free environment. Our results lead us to propose that TRBP can directly stimulate translation of TAR-containing RNAs, independently, and in addition to its ability to suppress the block imposed by PKR.DISCUSSIONSecondary structure of the 5′-UTR RNAs as well as cellular proteins influence the rate of translation of a given transcript (30Gray N.K. Wickens M. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1998; 14: 399-458Crossref PubMed Scopus (447) Google Scholar). In this study, by using a reticulocyte lysate-based system of translation, we have shown that the secondary structure of TAR RNA affects the translation efficiency of the corresponding transcripts. RNA transcripts, starting with an authentic TAR or with TAR in which the dsRNA stem structure is retained (B123, L135), were poorly translated when compared with transcripts without TAR. In contrast, TAR mutants, in which the dsRNA structure was disrupted (SΔ3–11, SΔ3–17), were translated as the controls without TAR structure (Fig. 1, A and C). A partial restoration of translation was observed with a mutant with a different TAR upper stem-loop structure (BL234). These data reinforce the role of the TAR element as a translational inhibitor and point out the importance of the dsRNA structure of transcripts in the efficiency of translation. It has been previously reported that the secondary structure of HIV-1 TAR affects translation efficiency by preventing the accessibility of the cap structure (31Parkin N.T. Cohen E.A. Darveau A.

A. 1990; 87: 7492-7496Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Our results indicate that the TAR secondary structure is a significant impediment to translational initiation.The ability of TAR-CAT transcripts to induce eIF-2α phosphorylation (Fig. 5) was expected as a result of the activation of the reticulocyte endogenous PKR by the dsRNA TAR structure (12Maitra R.K. McMillan N.A. Desai S. McSwiggen J. Hovanessian A.G. Sen G. Williams B.R. Silverman R.H. Virology. 1994; 204: 823-827Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar, 32Edery I. Petryshyn R. Sonenberg N. Cell. 1989; 56: 303-312Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). Therefore, it was surprising to observe that the CAT RNA transcript, that has no TAR structure, was similarly capable of inducing eIF-2α phosphorylation to a level comparable to that achieved with TAR-CAT RNA and with similar kinetics (Fig. 5). The phosphorylation of eIF-2α may occur from activation of other eIF-2α kinases such as the hemin-controlled repressor HRI (35Chen J.J. Throop M.S. Gehrke L. Kuo I. Pal J.K. Brodsky M. London I.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 7729-7733Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). Indeed, a measurable low level of phosphorylated eIF-2α can be observed after incubation during 30 min of the control lysates incubated in the absence of RNA transcript (Fig. 5 B,lane 1). It is also possible that the in vitrotranscript preparations contain traces of dsRNA (36Gunnery S. Rice A.P. Robertson H.D. Mathews M.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 8687-8691Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). Indeed, very low amounts of dsRNA are known to activate PKR in reticulocyte lysates, as seen by the control experiment carried out with poly(I)-poly(C) (Fig. 5 B, lane 12). Hence, since TAR-CAT and CAT transcripts were prepared under similar conditions, this potential dsRNA contamination cannot account for the difference in the translational behavior of TAR and CAT transcripts. Another explanation is that long RNAs most often have double-stranded regions in their structure, which might be sufficient to activate PKR. Indeed, folding of the first 500 nt of CAT and TAR-CAT RNAs on the Mfold server showed 18 and 12 alternative putative structures and the most stable of each have several double-stranded regions besides TAR when present (data not shown). These multiple structures probably can activate PKR and, as a consequence, eIF-2α will become phosphorylated. Whatever the case, our results indicate that translation of CAT RNA is not impaired by the accumulation of phosphorylated eIF-2α and that the difference in translation efficiency between the two RNAs must have a different origin. The stable structure of TAR RNA located at the 5′-end of the transcript is the most plausible explanation to a decreased translation. The translational initiation complex may be more difficult to assemble with this structure rather than with a less stable structure and will require the activity of additional proteins to increase the recruitment of ribosome subunits and translational factors. The direct relationship between the RNA stability of the 5′-UTRs and the decrease in translation supports this hypothesis (Fig. 1).TRBP interacts with both the TAR dsRNA structure present at the 5′-end of all HIV-1 mRNAs and with PKR. In the latter case, TRBP has been shown to directly bind PKR in the absence of dsRNA and to reverse the inhibitory effect of PKR on HIV replication (17Benkirane M. Neuveut C. Chun R.F. Smith S.M. Samuel C.E. Gatignol A. Jeang K.T. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 611-624Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). In agreement with that, we have recently identified TRBP as a partner for PKR in the screening of a human cDNA library with PKR using the yeast two-hybrid assay. 3M. Bonnet and E. Meurs, unpublished observations. TRBP reverses the inhibitory effect of PKR on HIV-1 replication (17Benkirane M. Neuveut C. Chun R.F. Smith S.M. Samuel C.E. Gatignol A. Jeang K.T. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 611-624Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar) and on HIV-1 LTR expression in a reporter assay (18Francois C. Duverlie G. Rebouillat D. Khorsi H. Castelain S. Blum H.E. Gatignol A. Wychowski C. Moradpour D. Meurs E.F. J. Virol. 2000; 74: 5587-5596Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). TRBP can also reverse the PKR-mediated control of yeast growth (19Daher A. Longuet M. Dorin D. Bois F. Segeral E. Bannwarth S. Battisti P.L. Purcell D.F. Benarous R. Vaquero C. Meurs E.F. Gatignol A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 33899-33905Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). The ability of TRBP to inhibit PKR is believed to occur by antagonizing the translational block imposed by PKR, but no direct evidence has been demonstrated in an in vitro translation assay. Our initial aim was to study the effect of TRBP on the translation of TAR-containing RNA, in the context of dsRNA-mediated PKR activation. TRBP increased specifically translation of TAR-CAT RNA but not the translation of CAT RNA, which proves its ability to antagonize a translational block. In this context, incubation of the reticulocyte lysate with TAR-CAT or CAT RNAs led to similar increase in eIF-2α phosphorylation, suggesting identical activation of PKR (Fig. 5 A). Furthermore, a purified preparation of TRBP blocked the phosphorylation of eIF-2α to the same extent, whether it was triggered by TAR-CAT or CAT messengers (Fig. 5 B). Finally, TRBP increased specifically the translation efficiency of the TAR-CAT RNA but did not modify translation of CAT transcripts (Figs. 3 and 4). Taken together, these results strongly suggest that TRBP increases TAR-CAT translation through a mechanism independent from PKR inhibition.To verify this hypothesis, the activity of TRBP was assayed in a PKR-free context. We performed reporter gene assays in PKR-deficient MEFs (23Yang Y.L. Reis L.F. Pavlovic J. Aguzzi A. Schafer R. Kumar A. Williams B.R. Aguet M. Weissmann C. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 6095-6106Crossref PubMed Scopus (562) Google Scholar), to demonstrate that TRBP has a direct stimulatory effect on the expression of the TAR-containing RNAs (Fig. 6). We measured the expression of CMV-Luc plasmids containing the authentic TAR, TAR mutated in the upper stem-loop region (BL234), TAR deleted in the bottom stem (SΔ3–17) or in the absence of TAR (ΔTAR). These TAR sequences are representative of the most stable, relatively stable and weakly stable 5′ RNA structure, respectively (Fig. 1). A better stimulation effect of TRBP on TAR-Luc plasmid, followed by the BL234 mutant, by the SΔ3–17 mutant suggests that the TRBP-mediated stimulation requires the dsRNA structure of the RNA. The small increase in the absence of TAR remains unexplained and may be due to specific RNA structure not seen in the folding or to a low TRBP activity on all RNAs. Because luciferase assays represent all expression steps between transcription and translation, we analyzed whether the mRNA level was affected. An absence of variation of the Luc mRNA in an RT-PCR assay showed that neither the transcription rate, nor the stability was affected by TRBP. The remaining and most likely explanation is a direct activity of TRBP on translation. This effect can be due to either an unfolding of the TAR structure that increases its accessibility to ribosomes or to a direct activity on the translational machinery. A destabilization of the TAR RNA structure has been previously observed with TRBP peptides that bind the RNA (6Erard M. Barker D.G. Amalric F. Jeang K.T. Gatignol A. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 279: 1085-1099Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar) but the similar activity of both dsRBDs (TR-AB, TR-A, and TR-B in Fig. 6 B) suggests that only low affinity binding is necessary to mediate this function. Therefore, the overall effect of the protein may be a destabilization of the stable RNA structure to allow efficient translation. These results demonstrate that the ability of TRBP to stimulate TAR RNA containing structures is not solely mediated by its ability to inhibit the translational block imposed by PKR, but also by a PKR-independent activity on translation.

Buckler-White A. Berkhout B. Jeang K.T. Science. 1991; 251: 1597-1600Crossref PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar). Two cDNAs have been isolated and have been named TRBP1 (originally TRBP) and TRBP2. They are identical but for an alternative first exon that arises from the use of a second internal promoter in the first intron of TRBP1. TRBP2 is the longer isoform and has 21 additional amino acids at its N terminus (2Duarte M. Graham K. Daher A. Battisti P.L. Bannwarth S. Segeral E. Jeang K.T. Gatignol A. J. Biomed.

TRBP1 and TRBP2 each contain two double-stranded RNA binding domains (dsRBD), although dsRBD1 binds RNA with low affinity whereas dsRBD2 binds TAR with high affinity because of the presence of a KR helix motif (5Daviet L. Erard M. Dorin D. Duarte M. Vaquero C. Gatignol A. Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 2419-2431Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). TRBPs, its dsRBD2, and a 24-amino acid TRBP peptide corresponding to the KR helix motif bind to two different sites of the highly ordered RNA structures of TAR. One site of high affinity is located between the bulge and the loop, and a second site of low affinity is located within the stem structure (1Gatignol A. Buckler-White A. Berkhout B. Jeang K.T.

The dsRBDs have also been found in several other proteins (8Fierro-Monti I. Mathews M.B. Trends Biochem.

The interferon-induced, dsRNA-regulated protein kinase, PKR, a cellular serine/threonine kinase activated upon binding to dsRNA, induces inhibition of protein synthesis by phosphorylating the α subunit of eukaryotic initiation factor 2 (eIF-2α). Once phosphorylated, eIF-2α prevents translation initiation (10Hershey J.W. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1991; 60: 717-755Crossref PubMed Scopus (840) Google Scholar, 11Pain V.M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 236: 747-771Crossref PubMed Scopus (636) Google Scholar). As a dsRNA-binding protein, PKR, also binds TAR RNA, which leads to its activation as a kinase (12Maitra R.K. McMillan N.A. Desai S. McSwiggen J. Hovanessian A.G. Sen G. Williams B.R. Silverman R.H. Virology. 1994; 204: 823-827Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). The PKR/TAR interaction can be displaced by the addition of a 60-amino acid synthetic peptide corresponding to residues of the first dsRBD present in PKR (13Nekhai S. Kumar A. Bottaro D.P. Petryshyn R. Virology. 1996; 222: 193-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). The integrity of the stem structure of TAR is required for its interaction with PKR. TAR mutants whose structure is disrupted are no longer able to bind to and activate PKR (14Roy S. Agy M. Hovanessian A.G. Sonenberg N. Katze M.G. J. Virol. 1991; 65: 632-640Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). TRBP has been reported to behave as an inhibitor of PKR. By cotransfection analysis, TRBP was found to enhance the translational efficiency of DHFR mRNAs and to restore vaccinia protein synthesis in E3L-vaccinia mutant-infected cells (15Park H. Davies M.V. Langland J.O. Chang H.W. Nam Y.S. Tartaglia J. Paoletti E. Jacobs B.L. Kaufman R.J. Venkatesan S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 4713-4717Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). Yeast two-hybrid assays as well as Far-Western techniques showed heterodimerization between PKR and TRBP and conveyed the idea that PKR and TRBP need dsRNA as a bridge for their mutual interaction (16Cosentino G.P. Venkatesan S. Serluca F.C. Green S.R. Mathews M.B. Sonenberg N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 9445-9449Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). The ability of TRBP to inhibit PKR activity was confirmed by overexpression of TRBP cloned into thenef gene of the HIV-1 genome. This allowed the virus to escape the PKR-mediated inhibition of virus replication. In addition, this work demonstrated that PKR and TRBP can heterodimerize in the absence of dsRNA (17Benkirane M. Neuveut C. Chun R.F. Smith S.M. Samuel C.E. Gatignol A. Jeang K.T. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 611-624Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). Furthermore, recent data have shown that TRBP reverses the PKR-induced HIV-1 LTR inhibition of expression (18Francois C. Duverlie G. Rebouillat D. Khorsi H. Castelain S. Blum H.E. Gatignol A.

Budding yeast Rad9 (scRad9) is required for activation of scRad53 (mammalian homolog Chk2) and transduction of the signal further downstream in this pathway. In the search for a mammalian homolog, three proteins in the human data base, including BRCA1, 53BP1, and nuclear factor with BRCT domains protein 1 (NFBD1), were found to share significant homology with the BRCT motifs of scRad9. Because BRCA1 and 53BP1 are involved in DNA damage responses, a similar role for NFBD1 was tested. We show that NFBD1 is a 250-kDa nuclear protein containing a forkhead-associated motif at its N terminus, two BRCT motifs at its C terminus, and 13 internal repetitions of a 41-amino acid sequence. Five minutes after γ-irradiation, NFBD1 formed nuclear foci that colocalized with the phosphorylated form of H2AX and Chk2, two phosphorylation events known to be involved in early DNA damage response. NFBD1 foci are also detected in response to camptothecin, etoposide, and methylmethanesulfonate treatments. Deletion of the forkhead-associated motif or the internal repeats of NFBD1 has no effect on DNA damage-induced NFBD1 foci formation. Conversely, deletion of the BRCT motifs abrogates damage-induced NFBD1 foci. Ectopic expression of the BRCT motifs reduced damage-induced NFBD1 foci and compromised phosphorylated Chk2- and phosphorylated H2AX-containing foci.

Genomic DNA in all living species is continuously assaulted by exogenous sources, such as environmental mutagens, and endogenous factors, such as reactive oxygen species, that arise during normal cellular metabolism (1Hartwell L. Cell. 1992; 71: 543-546Google Scholar). Cells have evolved surveillance mechanisms to promote faithful transmission of genetic information, which involves detection of DNA damage and a resulting signal transduction cascade leading to the induction of cell cycle checkpoints and initiation of DNA repair (2Nurse P.

Elledge S.J. Nature. 2002; 408: 433-439Google Scholar). Defects in DNA damage response pathways may result in inefficient repair and accumulation of mutations. Participants in the DNA damage response pathways can be divided into sensors, proximal kinases, adaptors, transducer kinases, and effectors (4Rouse J. Jackson S.P.

In budding yeast, a heterotrimeric complex, Rad17-Ddc1-Mec3, which shares homology with proliferating cell nuclear antigen and the replication factor c-like factor Rad24 are thought to be DNA damage sensors (6Melo J.A. Cohen J. Toczyski D.P. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 2809-2821Google Scholar). Mec1 and Tel1, members of the phosphatidyl inositol-3 kinase-like kinase family, are classified as proximal kinases that activated in response to DNA damage (7Morrow D.M. Tagle D.A. Shiloh Y.

Rad9, an adaptor protein, is phosphorylated by Mec1, which in turn activates the downstream transducer kinase Rad53, a serine/threonine kinase (9Sun Z. Hsiao J. Fay D.S. Stern D.F.

Finally, activation of the downstream effectors, such as p53 and CDC25, leads to cell cycle arrest (26Bartek J. Lukas J. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2001; 13: 738-747Google Scholar, 27Taylor W.R.

It is essential for arresting division upon DNA damage (28Weinert T.A. Hartwell L.H. Science. 1988; 241: 317-322Google Scholar). When yeast is treated with DNA-damaging agents, scRad9 is phosphorylated, which promotes binding to the C-terminal forkhead homology-associated (FHA) motif of Rad53 (12Schwartz M.F. Duong J.K. Sun Z. Morrow J.S. Pradhan D. Stern D.F. Mol. Cell. 2002; 9: 1055-1065Google Scholar). Therefore, scRad9 plays a critical role in this signaling pathway by ensuring that the damage signal is transduced downstream. A mammalian homologue of scRad9, however, has not been identified. The structural signature motifs of scRad9 are two BRCT repeats in its C terminus. Based on this structural similarity, it was predicted that three mammalian proteins, BRCA1, p53BP1, and an uncharacterized protein, KIAA0170, might be the candidates for the scRad9 homologue (29Koonin E.V. Altschul S.F. Bork P. Nat. Genet. 1996; 13: 266-268Google Scholar, 30Bork P. Hofmann K. Bucher P. Neuwald A.F. Altschul S.F. Koonin E.V. FASEB J. 1997; 11: 68-76Google Scholar, 31Callebaut I. Mornon J.P. FEBS Lett. 1997; 400: 25-30Google Scholar). Only BRCA1 and 53BP1 have been significantly characterized to date. In addition to their structural similarity, BRCA1 and Rad9 both serve as substrates of ATM and ATR kinases in response to DNA damage (32Cortez D. Wang Y. Qin J. Elledge S.J. Science. 1999; 286: 1162-1166Google Scholar, 33Tibbetts R.S. Cortez D. Brumbaugh K.M. Scully R. Livingston D. Elledge S.J. Abraham R.T. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 2989-3002Google Scholar, 34Xu B. Kim S.t. Kastan M.B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 3445-3450Google Scholar) and compromised G2/M checkpoint control upon inactivation (35Xu X. Weaver Z. Linke S.P. Li C. Gotay J. Wang X.W. Harris C.C. Ried T. Deng C.X. Mol. Cell. 1999; 3: 389-395Google Scholar). However, BRCA1 also has unique functions, including acting as a substrate of Chk2 (36Lee J.S. Collins K.M. Brown A.L. Lee C.H. Chung J.H. Nature. 2000; 404: 201-204Google Scholar), directly participating in homologous recombination, and microhomology-mediated end-joining through interaction with the Rad50-Mre11-NBS1 complex (37Moynahan M.E. Chiu J.W. Koller B.H. Jasin M. Mol. Cell. 1999; 4: 511-518Google Scholar, 38Zhong Q. Chen C.F. Chen P.L. Lee W.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 28641-28647Google Scholar, 39Zhong Q. Boyer T.G. Chen P.L. Lee W.H. Cancer Res. 2002; 62: 3966-3970Google Scholar). Moreover, BRCA1 contains a ring-finger motif at its N terminus and has ubiquitin ligase activity (40Hashizume R. Fukuda M. Maeda I. Nishikawa H. Oyake D. Yabuki Y. Ogata H. Ohta T. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 14537-14540Google Scholar). BRCA1 also interacts with many transcription factors and coordinately regulates the critical cell cycle inhibitor p21 and the G2/M checkpoint protein Gadd45 (41Zheng L. Li S. Boyer T.G. Lee W.H. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 6159-6175Google Scholar). Because of these diverse functions, BRCA1 may not be a bona fide homolog of Rad9. Another protein, 53BP1 also resembles scRad9. It has two C-terminal BRCT repeats and participates in early DNA damage response (42Schultz L.B. Chehab N.H. Malikzay A. Halazonetis T.D. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 151: 1381-1390Google Scholar, 43Rappold I. Iwabuchi K. Date T. Chen J. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 153: 613-620Google Scholar). It is also a substrate for ATM (44Xia Z. Morales J.C. Dunphy W.G. Carpenter P.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 2708-2718Google Scholar, 45Anderson L. Henderson C. Adachi Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 1719-1729Google Scholar) and is required for G2/M checkpoint arrest in response to γ-irradiation (46Wang B. Matsuoka S. Carpenter P.B. Elledge S.J. Science. 2002; (epub ahead of print)Google Scholar). Thus, 53BP1 seems to be even more functionally similar to scRad9 than BRCA1. KIAA0170 was an anonymous gene identified by random sequencing of cDNA library derived from a human immature myeloid cell line (47Nagase T. Seki N. Ishikawa K. Tanaka A. Nomura N. DNA Res. 1996; 3: 17-24Google Scholar). The KIAA0170 gene product was later reported to have transactivation activity and was renamed 'nuclear factor contains BRCT domains protein 1′ (NFBD1) (48Ozaki T. Nagase T. Ichimiya S. Seki N. Ohiri M. Nomura N. Takada N. Sakiyama S. Weber B.L. Nakagawara A. DNA Cell Biol. 2000; 19: 475-485Google Scholar). NFBD1 is predicted to have an N-terminal FHA motif (49Hofmann K. Bucher P. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1995; 20: 347-349Google Scholar) and two C-terminal BRCT repeats. Besides this preliminary characterization of secondary structure, however, very little is known about NFBD1. In particular, nothing has yet been published about its potential function in the DNA damage response. Here, we show for the first time that NFBD1 does participate in the early DNA damage responses. Deletion of BRCT motifs, but not the FHA motif or the internal repeats of NFBD1, abolished foci formation. Ectopic expression of the NFBD1-derived BRCT motifs greatly reduced IR-induced nuclear foci containing NFBD1, Chk2 phosphorylated at threonine 68 (Chk2T68P), and H2AX phosphorylated on serine 139 (γ-H2AX). The NFBD1 full-length cDNA (kindly provided by T. Nagase, Kazusa DNA Research Institute, Chiba, Japan) was cloned into the EGFP-C2 expression vector (Clontech, Palo Alto, CA). Subsequent motif deletions were made in the EGFP-NFBD1 construct using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) and confirmed by DNA sequencing. Primers encoding the nuclear localization signal were synthesized, annealed, and cloned into EGFP-C2. The fragment containing the BRCT motifs of NFBD1 (codon 1839–2089) was obtained by polymerase chain reaction using Pfu polymerase (Stratagene) and cloned in-frame with nuclear localization signal in EGFP-C2. HeLa, a human cervical carcinoma cell line; IMR90, a human diploid fibroblast; and LEM, an Epstein-Barr virus-immortalized human B cell line, were cultured in Dulbeco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 2 mml-glutamine, 50 units of penicillin, and 50 μg/ml of streptomycin at 37 °C with 10% CO2. Cells grown in log-phase were irradiated in a137Cs radiation source (Mark I, Model 68A Irradiator; JL Shepherd & Associates). UV irradiation was performed using a Stratalinker UV source (Stratagene). Before UV irradiation, the culture medium was removed and cells were washed once with phosphate-buffered saline. The medium was replaced immediately after irradiation. All the cells were then cultured at 37 °C and harvested at the indicated time points. For treatment with genotoxic agents, the cells were exposed for 1 h at the indicated dose, washed with phosphate-buffered saline, and cultured in fresh medium for another hour before being fixed for immunostaining. Untreated or mock-treated cells were treated identically with phosphate-buffered saline washes and medium changes but no irradiation. The fragment of the NFBD1 gene encoding amino acids 2–224 was amplified by polymerase chain reaction using Pfu polymerase (Stratagene) and was cloned into the pGEX vector (Amersham Biosciences). The recombinant protein was expressed in BL21-LysS cells and purified with glutathioneS-transferase beads. The purified recombinant protein was resolved by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and stained with imidazole-zinc. The polypeptide band was excised, electroeluted from the gel, and subsequently used as an antigen to immunize mice and rabbits. Rabbit antibodies were purified using antigen-coupled affinity chromatography. Rabbit α-γ-H2AX was purchased from Upstate Biotechnology (Lake Placid, NY), rabbit α-Chk2T68P from Cell Signaling Technology (Beverly, MA), and mouse α-GFP from Roche Applied Science. [35S]Methionine labeling, immunoprecipitations, and immunoblotting were performed as described previously (50Chen P.L. Scully P. Shew J.Y. Wang J.Y. Lee W.H. Cell. 1989; 58: 1193-1198Google Scholar, 51Chen Y. Farmer A.A. Chen C.-F. Jones D.C. Chen P.-L. Lee W.-H. Cancer Res. 1996; 56: 3168-3172Google Scholar). α-NFBD1 and α-GFP monoclonal antibodies were used for antigen detection in the immunoblots. Procedures for immunostaining were adapted from Durfee et al. (52Durfee T. Mancini M.A. Jones D. Elledge S.J. Lee W.-H. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 127: 609-622Google Scholar). Briefly, cells grown on coverslips to 60–70% confluence were treated with various DNA-damaging agents and fixed in 3% formaldehyde with 0.1% Triton X-100. Cells on coverslips were permeabilized by 0.05% saponin and blocked with 10% normal goat serum. All primary antibodies were used at a dilution of 1:100 to 1:1000 in 10% goat serum. The secondary antibodies, including anti-rabbit or mouse Alexa 555 and anti-rabbit or anti-mouse Alexa 488 (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) were used at a dilution of 1:1000. Cells were further stained with 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole for detection of DNA and mounted in Permafluor (Lipshaw-Immunonon, Pittsburgh, PA). Immunofluorescence images were captured using a Zeiss Axiplan2 fluorescence microscope. Transfections were performed using Lipofectin (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The transfected cells were supplemented with fresh medium and irradiated at 36–38 h after transfection. We found that NFBD1, in addition to its N-terminal FHA motif and two C-terminal BRCT motifs, had 13 unique internal repeats, each containing 41 amino acids enriched with serine, threonine, and proline residues (Fig. 1). Interestingly, potential ATM/ATR and cyclin-dependent kinase phosphorylation sites are scattered throughout these repeats. To identify the encoded protein of NFBD1, we used the recombinant GST fusion protein containing the N-terminal 223 amino acids of NFBD1 as an antigen (named GST-FHA) to raise mouse and rabbit polyclonal antibodies. Cell extracts prepared from [35S]methionine-labeled lymphoid cells (LEM) were used for immunoprecipitation with either mouse NFBD1 antisera or preimmune serum. As shown in Fig. 1 C, a protein with an apparent molecular mass of 250 kDa, which is near the predicted molecular mass, was specifically immunoprecipitated by anti-NFBD1 antisera but not pre-immune sera (lanes 1 and 2). Addition of the original GST-FHA antigen (lane 4), but not GST alone (lane 3), blocked the immunoprecipitation of 250-kDa protein. To further ensure the specificity of the antibodies, the anti-NFBD1 immunoprecipitates were released and reprecipitated by anti-NFBD1, as described previously (51Chen Y. Farmer A.A. Chen C.-F. Jones D.C. Chen P.-L. Lee W.-H. Cancer Res. 1996; 56: 3168-3172Google Scholar). Under these conditions, only the single 250-kDa band was detected (lane 5), suggesting that the NFBD1 antisera were specific for the 250-kDa protein. In addition, protein with the same relative mobility was also immunoprecipitated by rabbit NFBD1 antisera (lane 6). Mouse (lane 7) and rabbit (lane 8) NFBD1 antibodies specifically purified by antigen-coupled affinity chromatography also detected a major band with the same apparent mobility, although minor bands with faster mobilities were also detected. The latter may be degradation products of NFBD1 or yet to be identified proteins. These results suggest that a protein with an apparent mass of ∼250 kDa is the endogenous NFBD1 gene product. Proteins involved in DNA damage response pathway, including 53BP1 and BRCA1, form subnuclear foci after DNA damage (42Schultz L.B. Chehab N.H. Malikzay A. Halazonetis T.D. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 151: 1381-1390Google Scholar,43Rappold I. Iwabuchi K. Date T. Chen J. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 153: 613-620Google Scholar, 53Zhong Q. Chen C.F. Li S. Chen Y. Wang C.C. Xiao J. Chen P.L. Sharp Z.D. Lee W.H. Science. 1999; 285: 747-750Google Scholar). To determine whether NFBD1 has similar properties, we examined its subcellular localization by immunostaining with anti-NFBD1 antibodies. In actively growing HeLa cells, purified rabbit NFBD1 antisera but neither pre-immune nor GST-FHA antigen block demonstrated immunoreactivity confined to nuclei (Fig.2 A). HeLa cells treated with ionizing radiation (IR) showed distinct nuclear foci positive for anti-NFBD1 immunoreactivity (Fig. 2 B). To confirm that these signals are attributed to NFBD1, full-length NFBD1 protein was tagged with GFP and expressed in the same HeLa cells. GFP-NFBD1, like endogenous NFBD1, localized exclusively in nuclei and was present in subnuclear foci after IR (Fig. 2 C). Furthermore, when HeLa cells expressing the GFP-NFBD1 were immunostained with anti-NFBD1 antibodies, the IR-induced nuclear foci derived from GFP signals (exogenous) colocalized with the foci detected by immunostaining with anti-NFBD1 antibodies (endogenous) (Fig.3 D). These results suggest that NFBD1 is present in nuclear foci upon IR.Figure 3NFBD1 relocalizes to nuclear foci in response to treatments with various DNA damaging-agents. HeLa cells were treated with γ-radiation (1 Gy and 8 Gy) or UV (50 J/m2). Cells were fixed and immunostained for NFBD1 after 30 min. Cells were also treated with 0.5 μg/ml mitomycin C (MMC), 2 μm camptothecin (CPT), 40 μg/ml etoposide (VP16), or 0.01% methylmethanesulfonate (MMS) for 1 h, washed, and refed with fresh medium (without drugs) and incubated for another hour, then fixed and immunostained with rabbit anti-NFBD1.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Next we tried to determined whether the foci that form in response to other DNA-damaging agents contain NFBD1. Camptothecin, a DNA topoisomerase I inhibitor, and etoposide, a topoisomerase II inhibitor, produced single-strand breaks and double-strand breaks (DSBs), respectively. Treatment with these two drugs induced prominent formation of foci containing NFBD1. Similar results were also observed in cells treated with the alkylating agent methylmethanesulfonate or the cross-linking agent mitomycin C, which both produce synthetic strand breaks (Fig. 3). Cells treated with UV light, which causes pyrimidine dimers but not DSBs, showed only a few foci positive for NFBD1 (Fig. 3). These results suggest damage-specific recruitment of NFBD1 to subnuclear foci during cellular responses. DNA DSBs induce formation of nuclear foci at the sites of breaks containing several damage response proteins. First, we characterized the kinetics of NFBD1 foci formation induced by IR in a normal human fibroblast line, IMR90. Cells were fixed at different time points after 1 Gy of γ-irradiation and immunostained with NFBD1 antisera. NFBD1-containing foci were clearly present within 5 min after IR (Fig.4 A). The average number of NFBD1-positive foci per cell increased with time and peaked 30 min after irradiation. Gradually, the number of NFBD1-positive foci decreased to background levels within 4 h (Fig. 4 B). The percentage of cells with more than five NFBD1 foci in the entire culture populations were also counted. The percentage of cells with IR-induced foci reached a peak of 95% within 5 min after IR, then gradually decreased to the background level after 4 h (Fig.4 B). These results indicate that cells, regardless of cell cycle stage, responded to form IR-induced foci containing NFBD1. They further suggest that NFBD1 localizes at sites of DNA breaks and participates in the early DNA damage response. γ-H2AX and Chk2T68P form nuclear foci at the sites of DNA DSBs upon IR (54Rogakou E.P. Pilch D.R. Orr A.H. Ivanova V.S. Bonner W.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 5858-5868Google Scholar, 55Ward I.M. Wu X. Chen J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 47755-47758Google Scholar). H2AX is a variant of H2A that undergoes phosphorylation at serine 139. γ-H2AX appears in discrete nuclear foci at sites of DNA breaks within 1–3 min after irradiation. The kinetics of NFBD1-positive foci formation described above are similar to those of γ-H2AX (54Rogakou E.P. Pilch D.R. Orr A.H. Ivanova V.S. Bonner W.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 5858-5868Google Scholar, 56Paull T.T. Rogakou E.P. Yamazaki V. Kirchgessner C.U. Gellert M. Bonner W.M. Curr. Biol. 2000; 10: 886-895Google Scholar), prompting us to ask whether NFBD1 and co-localize in IR-induced foci. Indeed, NFBD1 and γ-H2AX immunoreactivity colocalize in foci that formed within 15 min to 4 h after irradiation (Fig.5 A). In addition to γ-H2AX, Chk2, a mammalian homologue of the transducing kinase Rad53, was also examined. In response to IR, ATM rapidly phosphorylates Chk2 at threonine 68, which activates Chk2 kinase activity (23Matsuoka S. Huang M. Elledge S.J. Science. 1998; 282: 1893-1897Google Scholar, 57Ahn J.Y. Schwarz J.K. Piwnica-Worms H. Canman C.E. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 5934-5936Google Scholar, 58Matsuoka S. Rotman G. Ogawa A. Shiloh Y. Tamai K. Elledge S.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 10389-10394Google Scholar) and its relocation to sites of DNA DSBs (55Ward I.M. Wu X. Chen J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 47755-47758Google Scholar). To test whether NFBD1 also co-localizes with Chk2T68P after IR, we immunostained irradiated cells using antibodies specific for T68-phosphorylated Chk2. As shown in Fig. 5 B, immunoreactivity to both Chk2T68P and NFBD1 antibodies colocalized at the IR-induced foci at all time points from 15 min to 4 h after irradiation. Collectively, these results indicate that NFBD1, like γ-H2AX and Chk2T68P, is recruited to sites of DNA breaks during the early stage of the response to DNA damage. NFBD1 contains three significant signature motifs. Each of them can be important in mediating the function it plays in DNA damage response. To determine which of the three motifs of NFBD1 was essential for the IR-induced foci formation, we generated deletion mutants of NFBD1 that removed them individually (Fig.6 A). The mutated proteins were N-terminally tagged with GFP, and their expression was assayed in transfected HeLa cells by immunoprecipitation with anti-GFP antibodies followed by Western blotting. As shown in Fig. 6 B, each of the mutated proteins was detected in transfected HeLa cells. Interestingly, all the mutated fusion proteins were localized in nuclei, suggesting that none are important for nuclear localization of NFBD1 (Fig. 6 C). Removal of the C-terminal BRCT motifs, but not the N-terminal FHA motif or the internal repeats, abolished its localization in IR-induced foci (Fig. 6 C). These results indicate that the BRCT motif is essential for the localization of NFBD1 to IR-induced foci. The major function of the BRCT motifs is to establish protein-protein interactions. Their limited sequence homology indicates that each BRCT motif has a distinct binding partner. To determine the effect of expression of the BRCT motifs in NFDB1 on NFBD1 subnuclear partitioning, we generated a plasmid to express a GFP-BRCT fusion protein that also contains a nuclear localization signal. Cells transfected and expressing GFP-BRCT, but not GFP alone, demonstrated significantly reduced NFBD1 immunoreactive foci (Fig.7 A), suggesting that the BRCT motifs have a dominant-negative effect on NFBD1 localization. Because NFBD1 colocalizes with γ-H2AX and Chk2T68P at IR-induced foci upon irradiation, we tested whether γ-H2AX- and Chk2T68P-containing foci would be altered in cells expressing the NFBD1-derived GFP-BRCT fusion protein. We immunostained the transfected cells with anti-γ-H2AX and found that the intensity of γ-H2AX staining was similar to that of the control, indicating that the phosphorylation of H2AX remained intact (Fig. 7, C and D). IR-induced foci were substantially reduced, however, in cells expressing the dominant-negative GFP-BRCT fusion protein (Fig.7 D). These results suggest that NFBD1 may have a role in recruitment of γ-H2AX to sites of DNA breaks but no obvious role in H2AX phosphorylation at serine 139. Similarly, when we immunostained the transfected cells with anti- Chk2T68P antibodies, IR-induced Chk2T68P foci were diminished in the presence of GFP-BRCT (Fig.7 F), suggesting that NFBD1 is also required for recruitment of Chk2T68P to sites of DNA breaks. In a search for a mammalian homolog of scRad9, a critical adaptor protein in DNA damage signal pathway, we characterized a novel nuclear protein, NFBD1, the BRCT motifs of which share significant homology with those of scRad9. NFBD1 was identified as a 250-kDa nuclear protein with specific antibodies. Within 5 min after IR, NFBD1 was found in nuclear foci, which also seemed to contain phosphorylated forms of H2AX (γ-H2AX) and Chk2 (Chk2T68P), two proteins known to be involved in early DNA damage response. NFBD1 foci formation was also detected in response to camptothecin, etoposide, and methylmethanesulfonate treatment. Deletion of the BRCT motif of NFBD1 had significant effects on the formation of IR-induced foci containing NFBD1. Moreover, ectopic expression of the NFBD1-derived BRCT motif alone not only greatly reduced IR-induced formation of foci containing NFBD1 but also reduced formation of foci containing either Chk2T68P or γ-H2AX. These results suggest that NFBD1 participates in the early stage of cellular response to DNA damage, a functional property similar to that of scRad9. In the DNA damage signal cascade of budding yeast, Rad9 is required for the activation of the Chk2 homolog Rad53 (10Vialard J.E. Gilbert C.S. Green C.M. Lowndes N.F. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 5679-5688Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of Rad9 by Mec1 upon DNA damage results in the formation of an epitope that binds to the FHA motif of Rad53. Rad9 self-associates (59Soulier J. Curr. Biol. 1999; 9: 551-554Google Scholar) and forms oligomers to bring two Rad53 molecules into close proximity to facilitate in trans autophosphorylation of the bound Rad53 molecules (60Gilbert C.S. Green C.M. Lowndes N.F. Mol. Cell. 2001; 8: 129-136Google Scholar). Thus, Rad9 serves as an adaptor to recruit Rad53. In mammalian cells, Chk2 activation in response to IR requires initial phosphorylation of Thr-68 by ATM and subsequent autophosphorylation (57Ahn J.Y. Schwarz J.K. Piwnica-Worms H. Canman C.E. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 5934-5936Google Scholar, 58Matsuoka S. Rotman G. Ogawa A. Shiloh Y. Tamai K. Elledge S.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 10389-10394Google Scholar, 61Melchionna R. Chen X.B. Blasina A. McGowan C.H. Nat. Cell. Biol. 2000; 2: 762-765Google Scholar). How Thr-68 phosphorylation leads to Chk2 autophosphorylation and activation is currently unclear. Because the DNA damage signaling pathway is highly conserved among different eukaryotes and because ATM can only phosphorylate Chk2 but fails to activate it in vitro (58Matsuoka S. Rotman G. Ogawa A. Shiloh Y. Tamai K. Elledge S.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 10389-10394Google Scholar), it is likely that an adaptor protein for Chk2 activation exists in mammals. 53BP1 and BRCA1 were speculated as the adaptors for Chk2 activation, but in the absence of functional BRCA1, Chk2 nonetheless can be efficiently activated upon IR. On the other hand, depletion of 53BP1 can partially affect the phosphorylation of Chk2 at T68 (46Wang B. Matsuoka S. Carpenter P.B. Elledge S.J. Science. 2002; (epub ahead of print)Google Scholar). Thus, 53BP1, but not BRCA1, may serve as an adaptor protein to facilitate Chk2 activation. Our immunostaining results have shown that NFBD1 colocalizes with Chk2T68P at the site of DNA breaks, and overexpression of the NFBD1-derived BRCT motif diminished the IR-induced foci positive for Chk2T68P. This finding, combined with structural clues, suggests an intriguing possibility that NFBD1 may also function as an adaptor protein, and is required for the phosphorylation of Chk2 and its localization to DNA break sites. However, further biochemical and genetic evidence is required to directly support this possibility. A known function of BRCT motifs is to enable protein-protein interaction, and many proteins in the DNA damage response pathways contain them (30Bork P. Hofmann K. Bucher P. Neuwald A.F. Altschul S.F. Koonin E.V. FASEB J. 1997; 11: 68-76Google Scholar, 31Callebaut I. Mornon J.P. FEBS Lett. 1997; 400: 25-30Google Scholar). However, the sequence homology among BRCT motifs is limited, although they form a similar three-dimensional structure (62Zhang X. Morera S. Bates P.A. Whitehead P.C. Coffer A.I. Hainbucher K. Nash R.A. Sternberg M.J. Lindahl T. Freemont P.S. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 6404-6411Google Scholar, 63Williams R.S. Green R. Glover J.N. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2001; 8: 838-842Google Scholar, 64Joo W.S.

EMBO J. 2002; 21: 3863-3872Google Scholar). We have shown that the BRCT motif of NFBD1 is required for its localization to the site of DNA breaks and that overexpression of this specific motif abolished IR-induced foci containing NFBD1 and Chk2T68P. These results suggest that the BRCT motif of NFBD1 has a dominant-negative effect on NFBD1 function. This notion is consistent with the potential role of NFBD1 as an adaptor protein. Several examples of protein-protein interactions important for DNA damage responses are known. Interaction between BRCA1 and CtIP is mediated by BRCT motifs (66Wong A.K. Ormonde P.A. Pero R. Chen Y. Lian L. Salada G. Berry S. Oncogene. 1998; 17: 2279-2285Google Scholar, 67Yu X. Wu L.C. Bowcock A.M. Aronheim A. Baer R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 25388-25392Google Scholar, 68Li S. Chen P.L. Subramanian T. Chinnadurai G. Tomlinson G. Osborne C.K. Sharp Z.D. Lee W.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 11334-11338Google Scholar) and has been shown to play an important role in regulating Gadd45, a critical G2/M checkpoint protein (69Li S. Ting N.S. Zheng L. Chen P.L. Ziv Y. Shiloh Y. Lee E.Y. Lee W.H. Nature. 2000; 406: 210-215Google Scholar). In addition, the BRCT motifs of 53BP1 interact with p53 (64Joo W.S. Jeffrey P.D. Cantor S.B. Finnin M.S. Livingston D.M. Pavletich N.P. Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 583-593Google Scholar, 65Derbyshire D.J. Basu B.P. Serpell L.C. Joo W.S. Date T. Iwabuchi K. Doherty A.J. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 3863-3872Google Scholar, 70Iwabuchi K. Bartel P.L. Li B. Marraccino R. Fields S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 6098-6102Google Scholar), a key player in both G1/S and G2/M checkpoint response, as well as in DNA damage-induced apoptosis (71Lakin N.D. Jackson S.P.

However, our preliminary results show that the expression of the BRCT motif of BRCA1 or 53BP1 has no influence on NFBD1 foci formation (data not shown), suggesting that the BRCT motif of NFBD1 has a unique role independent of BRCA1 or 53BP1 in the DNA damage response signaling pathway. Phosphorylation of histone H2AX on serine 139 by ATM has been observed in response to DNA double-strand breaks (72Burma S. Chen B.P. Murphy M. Kurimasa A. Chen D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 42462-42467Google Scholar) and by ATR in response to DNA replicative stress (73Ward I.M. Chen J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 47759-47762Google Scholar). γ-H2AX is found in subnuclear foci, which colocalize with BRCA1 and 53BP1 at the arrested replication fork in S-phase cells (43Rappold I. Iwabuchi K.

In the absence of histone H2AX, cells display increased sensitivity to ionizing radiation and increased genomic instability (74Celeste A. Petersen S. Romanienko P.J. Fernandez-Capetillo O. Chen H.T.

Nussenzweig M.C. Nussenzweig A. Science. 2002; 296: 922-928Google Scholar). These observations suggest a critical role for H2AX in the mammalian DNA damage response. The effects of NFBD1-derived BRCT motifs we observed on the IR-induced foci formation of γ-H2AX suggest that functional NFBD1 may play a role in the recruitment of γ-H2AX to sites of DNA breaks but very little role in the phosphorylation of H2AX at serine 139. Although further confirmation is needed, our data suggest that NFBD1 may play little role in sensing DNA damage. The results presented in this study suggest strongly that NFBD1 may serve as an adaptor protein in the DNA damage response pathway in mammalian cells. Because mutation of either BRCA1 (75Futreal P.A.

https://openalex.org/W2001060450,"RNA polymerase II (pol II) is subject to an early elongation delay induced by negative factors Spt5/Spt4 and NELF, which is overcome by the positive factor P-TEFb (Cdk9/cyclin T), a protein kinase that phosphorylates the pol II C-terminal domain (CTD) and the transcription elongation factor Spt5. Although the rationale for this arrest and restart is unclear, recent studies suggest a connection to mRNA capping, which is coupled to transcription elongation via physical and functional interactions between the cap-forming enzymes, the CTD-PO4, and Spt5. Here we identify a novel interaction between fission yeast RNA triphosphatase Pct1, the enzyme that initiates cap formation, andSchizosaccharomyces pombe Cdk9. The C-terminal segment of SpCdk9 comprises a Pct1-binding domain distinct from the N-terminal Cdk domain. We show that the Cdk domain interacts with S. pombePch1, a homolog of cyclin T, and that the purified recombinant SpCdk9/Pch1 heterodimer can phosphorylate both the pol II CTD and the C-terminal domain of S. pombe Spt5. We provide genetic evidence that SpCdk9 and Pch1 are functional orthologs of theSaccharomyces cerevisiae CTD kinase Bur1/Bur2, a putative yeast P-TEFb. Mutations of the kinase active site and the regulatory T-loop of SpCdk9 abolish its activity in vivo. Deleting the C-terminal domain of SpCdk9 causes a severe growth defect. We suggest a model whereby Spt5-induced arrest of early elongation ensures a temporal window for recruitment of the capping enzymes, which in turn attract Cdk9 to alleviate the arrest. This elongation checkpoint may avoid wasteful rounds of transcription of uncapped pre-mRNAs."

Due to the low water solubility, a 2 mm stock solution of MnIIIBr8T-2-PyP+ in methanol was used throughout this study. Measurements were performed on a CH Instruments Model 600 voltammetric analyzer. A three-electrode system was utilized with a glassy carbon (3 mm) or gold (2 mm) button working electrode (Bioanalytical Systems), a Ag/AgCl reference, and a platinum wire as auxiliary electrode. Due to the low water solubility of the MnIIIBr8T-2-PyP+, electrochemical studies of both compounds were performed in 9/1 (v/v) methanol/aqueous solutions as previously reported (49Spasojevic I. Batinic-Haberle I. Stevens R.D. Hambright P. Thorpe A.N. Grodkowski J. Neta P. Fridovich I. Inorg. Chem. 2001; 40: 726-739Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). The 9/1 (v/v) methanol/aqueous solutions contained 0.05 m Tris, pH 7.8, 0.1 m NaCl, and 0.3 mm metalloporphyrin. Tris buffer was used instead of phosphate buffer, because the latter precipitates in methanol. The potentials were standardized against potassium ferrocyanide/ferricyanide (51Kolthoff I.M. Tomsicek W.J. J. Phys. Chem. 1935; 39: 945-954Crossref Scopus (165) Google Scholar) and MnIIITE-2-PyP5+. The redox potential of the MnIII/MnIV redox couple, which was previously found to be proton-dependent (52Ferrer-Sueta G. Batinic-Haberle I. Spasojevic I. Fridovich I. Radi R. Chem. Res. Toxicol. 1999; 12: 442-449Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar) was determined at pH 12.3. The scan rates were 0.01–10 V/s. The E 12values for MnII/MnIII and MnIII/MnIV redox couples obtained in 9/1 (v/v) methanol/aqueous solutions were extrapolated to aqueous medium values as previously described (49Spasojevic I. Batinic-Haberle I. Stevens R.D. Hambright P. Thorpe A.N. Grodkowski J. Neta P. Fridovich I. Inorg. Chem. 2001; 40: 726-739Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). We have previously shown that the convenient cytochrome c assay gives the same catalytic rate constants as does pulse radiolysis in the case of MnIIITE-2-PyP5+, {MnIIIBVDME}2, {MnIIIBV2−}2, and MnIICl2 (49Spasojevic I.

Chem. 2001; 40: 726-739Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar), and it was therefore utilized in this study. The xanthine/xanthine oxidase reaction was the source of O 2·_, and ferricytochrome c was used as the indicating scavenger for O 2·_ (53McCord J.M. Fridovich I. J. Biol. Chem. 1969; 244: 6049-6055Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The reduction of cytochromec was followed at 550 nm. Assays were conducted at 25 ± 1 °C, in 0.05 m phosphate buffer, pH 7.8, 0.1 mm EDTA, 10 μm cytochrome c, 40 μm xanthine, with or without 15 μg/ml catalase. Aqueous stock solutions of MnIIITE(M)-2-PyP5+ and MnTM-3(4)-PyP5+ and the methanolic stock solution of MnIIIBr8T-2-PyP+ were diluted into the assay mixture. Rate constants for the reaction of metalloporphyrins with O 2·_ were based upon competition with 10 μmcytochrome c as described elsewhere (49Spasojevic I. Batinic-Haberle I. Stevens R.D. Hambright P. Thorpe A.N. Grodkowski J. Neta P. Fridovich I. Inorg. Chem. 2001; 40: 726-739Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Thek cytc = 2.6 × 105m−1 s−1 obtained under the same experimental conditions (pH 7.8, 21 °C, 0.05 mphosphate buffer, 0.1 mm EDTA) (50Butler J. Koppenol W.H. Margoliash E. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 10747-10750Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) was used to calculate k cat. The O 2·_ was produced at the rate of 1.2 μm per minute. Any possible interference through inhibition of the xanthine/xanthine oxidase reaction by the test compounds was examined by following the rate of urate accumulation at 295 nm in the absence of cytochrome c.No reoxidation of ferrocytochrome c by metalloporphyrins was observed. No effect of catalase was detected implying sufficient stability of the compounds toward H2O2. We have previously determined the rate constants for the degradation of MnIIITE-2-PyP5+ and of MnIIITM-2-PyP5+ by H2O2to be 1.3 m−1 s−1 and for MnIIITM-3-PyP5+ and MnIIITM-4-PyP5+ 4.9 and 4.6m−1 s−1, respectively. In this work we found that the MnIIIBr8T-2-PyP+ proved to be at least two orders of magnitude more stable. The dependence of the catalytic rate constant for the O 2·_ dismutation upon ionic strength was determined in 0.05 m phosphate buffer, pH 7.8, with NaCl ranging from 0 to 0.4 m. Reversible cyclic voltammograms of the MnII/MnIII redox were obtained for both compounds, MnIIITE-2-PyP5+ and MnIIIBr8T-2-PyP+, at scan rates of 0.1 V/s (Fig. 1). Thus it was possible to determine the half-wave potentials, E 12, given in Table I. The two compounds have almost identical MnII/MnIII metal-centeredE 12 values at pH 7.8, as predicted from the number and the nature of the electron-withdrawing substituents on themeso positions of the porphyrin ring (41Batinic-Haberle I.

Moreover, their voltammetric behavior in terms of electrochemical reversibility (peak-to-peak potential separation, ΔE pp (Fig.2 A), and current response to a change in scan rate (Fig. 2 C)) as well as the chemical reversibility (ratio between the reduction and oxidation peak currents (Fig. 2 B)) is strikingly similar, which leaves us to believe that the difference in the reactivity toward superoxide is indeed due to the difference in the overall positive charge (electrostatic attraction of superoxide anion) and not due to a difference in the rates of electron transfer (electronic and structural differences).Table IThe E 12 for the MnII /MnIII and MnIII /MnIV redox couples and kcatfor the O 2·_ dismutation by MnIIITE-2-PyP5+ and MnIIIBr8T-2-PyP+CompoundE 12(MnII/MnIII)aE 12 (±3 mV) values were obtained in 9/1 (v/v) methanol/aqueous solution, 0.05 m Tris buffer, pH 7.8, 0.1 m NaCl and extrapolated in aqueous solution as previously described (49).

Because the hydroxo-MnIII and oxo-MnIV species are involved (52Ferrer-Sueta G. Batinic-Haberle I. Spasojevic I. Fridovich I. Radi R. Chem. Res. Toxicol. 1999; 12: 442-449Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar), this redox process is accessible only in basic solution and is proton-dependent. At pH 12.3, reversible cyclic voltammograms were obtained in the case of both compounds, MnIIITE-2-PyP5+ and MnIIIBr8T-2-PyP+, with essentially equal MnIII/MnIV redox couple potentials of +381 mV and +372 mV versus NHE, respectively (Fig.1 B and Table I). The MnIII/MnIV and MnII/MnIII redox processes are independent as demonstrated on Fig. 1 B (dashed traces), whereas reversible voltammetric waves were obtained even when the cycling was done only in a narrow potential range around theE 12 of the corresponding redox couple. Because a deprotonation of the axially ligated water on Mn(III) porphyrins occurs at pH 12.3, the MnII/MnIIIredox potential shifts negatively (52Ferrer-Sueta G. Batinic-Haberle I. Spasojevic I. Fridovich I. Radi R. Chem. Res. Toxicol. 1999; 12: 442-449Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). Therefore, we ascribe the 145-mV difference in the shift between the two redox couples (Fig.1 B and Table I) to a difference in the pK a,ax values of their axially ligated water. We have previously found that E 12 reflects the electron density of the porphyrin ring and the metal center in such a way that there is a linear relationship between the pK a of the pyrrolic nitrogen protons of the porphyrin ligand and the metal-centered E 12 for a series of differently substituted manganese porphyrins (26Batinic-Haberle I.

Syk is a member of a tyrosine kinase family that is expressed mostly in hematopoietic cells. Syk is expressed in cell lines of epithelial origin, but its function in these cells remains unknown. Here we report that Syk is expressed in MCF-7 cells but not in MDA-MB-231 cells. The overexpression of wild type Syk kinase but not kinase-negative Syk suppressed cell motility and inhibited the activation of phosphatidylinositol (PI) 3′-kinase in MDA-MB-231 cells. In contrast, when Syk-specific antisense S-oligonucleotide but not the sense S-oligonucleotide was transfected to MCF-7 cells the level of PI 3′-kinase activity as well as cell motility were increased. The MDA-MB-231 cells transfected with wild type Syk cDNA followed by treatment with piceatannol, a Syk inhibitor, enhanced cell motility and PI 3′-kinase activity. Pervanadate, a phosphotyrosine phosphatase inhibitor, induced PI 3′-kinase activity and stimulated the interaction between the inhibitor of nuclear factor κBα (IκBα) and the p85α domain of PI 3′-kinase through tyrosine phosphorylation of the IκBα, which ultimately resulted in nuclear factor κB (NFκB) activation. Pervanadate had no effect on the activation of Syk in these cells. However, Syk suppressed the NFκB transcriptional activation and interaction between IκBα and PI 3′-kinase by inhibiting the tyrosine phosphorylation of IκBα. Syk, PI 3′-kinase inhibitors, and NFκB inhibitory peptide inhibited urokinase type plasminogen activator (uPA) secretion and cell motility in these cells. To our knowledge, this is the first report that Syk suppresses the cell motility and inhibits the PI 3′-kinase activity and uPA secretion by blocking NFκB activity through tyrosine phosphorylation of IκBα. These data further demonstrate a functional molecular link between Syk-regulated PI 3′-kinase activity and NFκB-mediated uPA secretion, and all of these ultimately control the motility of breast cancer cells.

The SH2 domains bind phosphorylated immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motifs and play significant roles in signaling through immunoreceptors (9Cheng A.M. Negishi I. Anderson S.J. Chan A.C. Bolen J. Loh D.Y. Pawson T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 9797-9801Google Scholar). ZAP-70 is a cytoplasmic tyrosine kinase, and both Syk and ZAP-70 share the same tandem SH2 domains at the amino terminus and play important roles in coupling antigen and Fc receptors to downstream signaling events that mediate diverse cellular responses including proliferation, differentiation, and phagocytosis (9Cheng A.M.

Blood. 1995; 85: 1175-1180Google Scholar). Fc receptors are members of the family of membrane proteins, called immunoreceptors, and they are expressed in all cells of the immune system. Both Syk and ZAP-70 are regulated by β3 integrin-dependent cell adhesion via phosphorylation-independent interaction with the cytoplasmic domain of β3 integrin (11Woodside D.G. Obergfell A. Talapatra A. Calderwood D.A. Shattil S.J. Ginsberg M.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 39401-39408Google Scholar). The expression of Syk has also been reported in cell lines of epithelial origin (12Fluck M. Zurcher G. Andres A.C. Ziemiecki A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 213: 273-281Google Scholar), but its function in these cells is not well understood. Recently it has been documented that Syk is commonly expressed in normal human breast tissue, benign breast lesions, and low tumorigenic breast cancer cell lines (13Coopmen P.J.P. Do M.T.H. Barth M. Bowden E.T. Hayes A.J. Basyuk E. Blancato J.K. Vezza P.R. McLeskey S.W. Mangeat P.H. Mueller S.C. Nature. 2000; 406: 742-747Google Scholar).Several cytokines, growth factors, and other agents control the regulation of cell motility. Phosphatidylinositol 3′-kinase (PI 3′-kinase) also plays significant role in regulation of cell motility (14Derman M.P. Toker A. Hartwig J.H. Spokes K. Falck J.R. Chen C.-S. Cantley L.C. Cantley L.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 6465-6470Google Scholar). Two subunits are present among all of the classes of PI 3′-kinases. One is catalytic subunit p110 (α, β, δ) or p110γ, and the other is regulatory subunit p85 (α, β, p55γ, and p101) (15Domin J. Waterfield M.D. FEBS Lett. 1997; 410: 91-95Google Scholar). The regulatory subunit of PI 3′-kinase is responsible for B cell development and proliferation (16Suzuki H. Terauchi Y. Fujiwara M. Aizawa S. Yazaki Y. Kadowaki T. Koyasu S. Science. 1999; 283: 390-392Google Scholar), and the catalytic subunits are critical for chemotactic activity (17Vanhaesebroeck B. Jones G.E. Allen W.E. Zicha D. Hooshmand-Rad R. Sawyer C. Waterfield M.D. Ridley A.J. Nat. Cell Biol. 1999; 1: 69-71Google Scholar).The activation of NFκB is regulated by a number of proinflammatory stimuli (18Bauerle P.A. Baltimore D. Cell. 1996; 87: 13-20Google Scholar, 19Baldwin A.S. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1996; 14: 649-681Google Scholar). The NFκB family consists of several members including p65, p50, RelB, and c-Rel molecules (18Bauerle P.A. Baltimore D. Cell. 1996; 87: 13-20Google Scholar). The activity of NFκB is also tightly controlled by its inhibitor, IκB family of proteins (20Karin M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 27339-27342Google Scholar). NFκB forms a complex with IκBα, and the complex can be removed from the nucleus by exportin-mediated transport to the cytoplasm. Recent report indicated that constitutively active PI 3′-kinase controls the activation of NFκB by the association of tyrosine-phosphorylated IκBα with the regulatory subunit of PI 3′-kinase, p85α (21Beraud C.M. Henzel W.J. Baeuerle P.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 429-434Google Scholar). The recent data also demonstrated that interleukin-1 stimulates PI 3′-kinase dependent phosphorylation and transactivation of NFκB without nuclear translocation of NFκB, indicating an alternative pathway other than IκBα-mediated pathway (22Sizemore N. Leung S. Stark G.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 4798-4805Google Scholar). But the molecular mechanism by which Syk, a tyrosine kinase, regulates the PI 3′-kinase dependent activation of NFκB in breast cancer cells is not well defined.Urokinase-type plasminogen activator (uPA) is a member of the serine protease family which induces the conversion of plasminogen to plasmin (23Besser D.

Plasmin regulates cell invasion by degrading matrix proteins such as fibronectin, type IV collagen, and laminin or indirectly by activating matrix metalloproteinases and uPA (24Sheela S. Barrett J.C.

Previous reports shown that uPA plays a significant role in tumor growth and metastasis. The signaling pathway by which Syk controls uPA secretion through PI 3′-kinase-dependent activation of NFκB is not clearly understood.In this study, we demonstrate that overexpression of wild type Syk in MDA-MB-231 cells suppressed cell motility and reduced PI 3′-kinase activity. Syk-specific antisense phosphorothioate oligonucleotide (ASSyk), when transfected to MCF-7 cells, increased cell motility and up-regulated PI 3′-kinase activity. Pervanadate (pV) stimulated PI 3′-kinase activity and induced transactivation of NFκB through tyrosine phosphorylation of IκBα, whereas Syk down-regulated the NFκB activity by inhibiting tyrosine phosphorylation of IκBα in these cells. Syk, PI 3′-kinase inhibitor, and NFκB inhibitors inhibited cell motility and uPA secretion in these cells. Taken together, Syk suppressed cell motility, uPA secretion, and PI 3′-kinase-mediated NFκB activation by inhibiting the interaction between the p85α subunits of PI 3′-kinase and tyrosine-phosphorylated IκBα.DISCUSSIONIn this study, we have demonstrated that Syk, a nonreceptor protein-tyrosine kinase, inhibited PI 3′-kinase activity and subsequently suppressed cell motility in both highly invasive (MDA-MB-231) and low invasive (MCF-7) breast cancer cells. Syk is expressed in MCF-7 cells, but its expression is not detectable in highly invasive MDA-MB-231 cells. The wild type Syk cDNA was transfected in MDA-MB-231 cells, and its expression and autophosphorylation activity in these cells were comparable with the endogenous Syk activity in MCF-7 cells (data not shown). Furthermore, we have demonstrated that Syk suppresses the pV-induced interaction of p85 subunit of PI 3′-kinase and tyrosine-phosphorylated IκBα. Syk reduced the NFκB luciferase activity and piceatannol, a Syk inhibitor, enhanced the NFκB activity in both MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 cells. The inhibition of PI 3′-kinase activity down-regulates the NFκB transactivation as well as cell motility in these cells. Moreover, inhibition of PI 3′-kinase and NFκB activities by their specific inhibitors reduced uPA secretion and cell motility in these cells. Syk also inhibits the uPA secretion in both MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 cells. These data demonstrated that Syk suppresses cell motility and down-regulates NFκB activity by inhibiting the PI 3′-kinase activity and uPA secretion in both MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 cells.ZAP-70, a nonreceptor protein-tyrosine kinase that shares the same tandem SH2 domains with Syk at the amino terminus, was not detected in the breast cancer cells (data not shown). Previous reports have indicated that pV, a phosphotyrosine phosphatase inhibitor, induces autophosphorylation of Syk in MCF-7 cells (13Coopmen P.J.P. Do M.T.H. Barth M. Bowden E.T. Hayes A.J. Basyuk E. Blancato J.K. Vezza P.R. McLeskey S.W. Mangeat P.H. Mueller S.C. Nature. 2000; 406: 742-747Google Scholar). However, our data revealed that pV had no effect on activation of Syk in MCF-7 cells. Earlier reports have shown that PI 3′-kinase signaling is required for depolarization and cell migration of MCF-7 cells by insulin-like growth factor I (31Guvakova M.A. Surmacz E. Exp. Cell Res. 1999; 251: 244-255Google Scholar). The data also suggested that increased PI 3′-kinase activity is correlated with the migratory potential and metastatic activity of highly invasive breast cancer (MDA-MB-231) cells (30Sliva D. Rizzo M.T. English D. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 3150-3157Google Scholar). Using genetic (wild type Syk and SykK−) and pharmacological (piceatannol) inhibitors of Syk, we have demonstrated that Syk is involved in the suppression of cell motility, PI 3′-kinase activity, and NFκB-mediated uPA secretion in both MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 cells. The p110 isoforms of PI 3′-kinase played significant roles in cell migration, and differential activation of specific p110 isoforms is responsible for particular signaling events in different cell types (32Sasaki T. Irie-Sasaki J. Jones R.G. Oliviera-dos-Santos A.J. Stanford W.L. Bolon B. Wakeham A. Itie A. Bouchard D. Kozieradzki I. Joza N. Mak T.W. Ohashi P.S. Suzuki A. Penninger J.M.

Recently, Sliva et al. (30Sliva D. Rizzo M.T. English D. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 3150-3157Google Scholar) reported that the regulatory p85α subunit of PI 3′-kinase is essential for enhanced migration of metastatic tumor cells because overexpression of a dominant negative regulatory subunit (p85DN) drastically reduced the cell migration.It has been documented recently that PI 3′-kinase plays a significant role in NFκB activation in different cell types (34Reddy S.A.G. Huang J.H. Liao W.S.-L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 29167-29173Google Scholar, 35Pan Z.K. Christiansen S.C. Ptasznik A. Zuraw B.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 9918-9922Google Scholar). Tumor necrosis factor α-induced NFκB activation is not affected by PI 3′-kinase inhibitors (wortmannin and LY294002). Similarly, a PI 3′-kinase inhibitor has no effect on interleukin-1-dependent IκBα degradation, nuclear translocation of NFκB, and NFκB-DNA binding (22Sizemore N. Leung S. Stark G.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 4798-4805Google Scholar). Our results demonstrated that Syk down-regulates NFκB transactivation by inhibiting the interaction between the tyrosine-phosphorylated IκBα and the p85 subunit of PI 3′-kinase. Earlier reports have shown that pV and tumor necrosis factor α induced NFκB activation in Jurkat cells, and only pV-induced activation of NFκB is inhibited by wortmannin (21Beraud C.M. Henzel W.J. Baeuerle P.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 429-434Google Scholar). Both wortmannin and LY294002 abrogated the transactivation of NFκB but had no effect on NFκB-DNA binding in MDA-MB-231 cells (30Sliva D. Rizzo M.T. English D. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 3150-3157Google Scholar). Our data also revealed that Syk and PI 3′-kinase inhibitors down-regulate the transactivation of NFκB but not NFκB-DNA binding (data not shown) in both MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 cells. Thus we conclude that Syk-regulated transactivation of NFκB is independent of NFκB-DNA binding in breast cancer cells.We have shown that MDA-MB-231 cells transfected with wild type Syk but not with SykK− suppressed the cellular migration and treatment of wild type Syk-transfected cells with increasing concentrations of piceatannol enhanced the cell migration in these cells. Both wortmannin and LY294002 inhibited, but pV induced the migration of MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 cells. The pV-induced migration is blocked by wortmannin or LY294002 in these cells. Similarly, the NFκB inhibitory peptide SN-50, curcumin, and protein synthesis inhibitor (actinomycin-D) reduced cell migration. Pretreatment of nontransfected or Syk-transfected cells with anti-uPA antibody reduced the migration of these cells. These data suggested that Syk suppressed the cell migration by down-regulating the constitutively active NFκB activation and uPA secretion by inhibiting the PI 3′-kinase activity in breast cancer cells.Our data also revealed that pV induces tyrosine phosphorylation of IκBα and subsequently enhances the interaction between tyrosine-phosphorylated IκBα with the p85α domain of PI 3′-kinase in a time-dependent manner in both cell lines. ST 638, a tyrosine kinase inhibitor, blocked the pV-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of IκBα. However, pV had no effect on serine phosphorylation of IκBα in these cells, suggesting that pV-induced transactivation of NFκB occurs through tyrosine phosphorylation of IκBα. Syk suppressed the tyrosine phosphorylation of IκBα and reduced the interaction between tyrosine-phosphorylated IκBα and p85 subunit of PI 3′-kinase. These data demonstrated that Syk regulates the transactivation of NFκB by inhibiting the direct interaction of tyrosine-phosphorylated IκBα and the p85 domain of PI 3′-kinase and suggested an alternative pathway not involving the phosphorylation and degradation of IκBα pathways.Matrix metalloproteinases play a major role in the regulation of cancer cell migration, extracellular matrix invasion, and metastasis by degrading the extracellular matrix proteins (3Liotta L.A. Steeg P.S. Stetler-Stevenson W.G. Cell. 1992; 71: 411-421Google Scholar, 4Testa J.E. Quigley J.P. Cancer Metastasis Rev. 1990; 9: 353-367Google Scholar, 36Murphy G. Gavrilovic J. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1990; 11: 614-621Google Scholar). We and others have shown recently that NFκB plays significant roles in the activation of matrix metalloproteinases-1, -2, -3, and -9 (27Philip S. Bulbule A. Kundu G.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 44926-44935Google Scholar, 37Hansen S.K. Nerlov C. Zabel U. Verde P. Johnsen M. Baeuerle P.A. Blasi F. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 205-213Google Scholar, 38Bond M. Baker A.H. Newby A.C. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 264: 561-567Google Scholar). uPA is also responsible for the migration and regulation of matrix metalloproteinases activation through NFκB-mediated pathways (39Bond M. Fabunmi R.P. Baker A.H. Newby A.C. FEBS Lett. 1998; 435: 29-34Google Scholar). In this study, we have detected the level of uPA in both highly invasive (MDA-MB-231) and low invasive (MCF-7) breast cancer cells. The constitutive secretion of uPA is significantly higher in MDA-MB-231 cells; however, a low level of uPA expression is observed in MCF-7 cells. The data also indicate that Syk down-regulates whereas pV up-regulates the uPA production in these cells. The PI 3′-kinase inhibitors wortmannin and LY294002 or the NFκB inhibitor SN-50 reduced uPA secretion, especially in MDA-MB-231 cells.In summary, we have demonstrated for the first time that overexpression of wild type Syk kinase but not the SykK− suppresses cell motility and reduces the activation of PI 3′-kinase in MDA-MB-231 cells. In contrast, in ASSyk but not SSyk, when transfected to the MCF-7 cells, the level of PI 3′-kinase activity as well as cell motility were increased. In the wild type Syk cDNA-transfected MDA-MB-231 cells, when treated with piceatannol, a Syk inhibitor, PI 3′-kinase activity increased. pV, a tyrosine phosphatase inhibitor, enhances the activity of PI 3′-kinase and induces the interaction between p85α, the regulatory subunit of PI 3′-kinase, and IκBα through tyrosine phosphorylation of IκBα. Syk suppresses the transactivation of NFκB by inhibiting the tyrosine phosphorylation of IκBα. PI 3′-kinase inhibitor reduces the pV-induced transactivation of NFκB. Both PI 3′-kinase inhibitors wortmannin and LY294002 and NFκB inhibitory peptide SN-50 suppress cell motility, indicating that PI 3′-kinase and NFκB play significant roles in this process. ASSyk-transfected MCF-7 cells enhanced uPA secretion, whereas wild type Syk cDNA-transfected MDA-MB-231 cells reduced uPA production, indicating that Syk down-regulates uPA secretion. These data suggested that Syk suppresses the NFκB transactivation by inhibiting the direct interaction of tyrosine-phosphorylated IκBα with the p85α domain of PI 3′-kinase in breast cancer cells. Finally, these data demonstrated that Syk down-regulates PI 3′-kinase activity and suppresses the constitutive NFκB activity and uPA secretion that ultimately lead to the suppression of cell motility of breast cancer cells (Fig. 9). These findings may be useful in designing novel therapeutic interventions using Syk as a target molecule that will disrupt the PI 3′-kinase and NFκB signaling pathways, resulting in reduction of uPA secretion and consequent blocking of invasiveness, migration, and metastatic spread of breast cancer. Cell migration and extracellular matrix invasion are two of the major steps in embryonic development (1Strickland S. Riech E. Sherman M.I. Cell. 1976; 9: 231-240Google Scholar, 2Sappiono A.P. Huarte D. Vassali J.D. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 109: 2471-2479Google Scholar), wound healing, and cancer cell metastasis (3Liotta L.A. Steeg P.S. Stetler-Stevenson W.G.

However, the exact molecular mechanisms that regulate these processes are not well understood. Syk, a nonreceptor protein-tyrosine kinase, is expressed widely in hematopoietic cells (5Kurosaki T. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 2000; 12: 276-281Google Scholar,6Turner M. Schweighoffer E. Colucci F. Di Santo J.P. Tybulewicz V.L. Immunol. Today. 2000; 21: 148-154Google Scholar).

Signal. 1995; 7: 185-193Google Scholar). The SH2 domains bind phosphorylated immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motifs and play significant roles in signaling through immunoreceptors (9Cheng A.M. Negishi I. Anderson S.J. Chan A.C. Bolen J. Loh D.Y. Pawson T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 9797-9801Google Scholar). ZAP-70 is a cytoplasmic tyrosine kinase, and both Syk and ZAP-70 share the same tandem SH2 domains at the amino terminus and play important roles in coupling antigen and Fc receptors to downstream signaling events that mediate diverse cellular responses including proliferation, differentiation, and phagocytosis (9Cheng A.M.

Blood. 1995; 85: 1175-1180Google Scholar). Fc receptors are members of the family of membrane proteins, called immunoreceptors, and they are expressed in all cells of the immune system. Both Syk and ZAP-70 are regulated by β3 integrin-dependent cell adhesion via phosphorylation-independent interaction with the cytoplasmic domain of β3 integrin (11Woodside D.G. Obergfell A. Talapatra A. Calderwood D.A. Shattil S.J. Ginsberg M.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 39401-39408Google Scholar). The expression of Syk has also been reported in cell lines of epithelial origin (12Fluck M. Zurcher G. Andres A.C. Ziemiecki A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 213: 273-281Google Scholar), but its function in these cells is not well understood. Recently it has been documented that Syk is commonly expressed in normal human breast tissue, benign breast lesions, and low tumorigenic breast cancer cell lines (13Coopmen P.J.P. Do M.T.H. Barth M. Bowden E.T. Hayes A.J. Basyuk E. Blancato J.K. Vezza P.R. McLeskey S.W. Mangeat P.H. Mueller S.C. Nature. 2000; 406: 742-747Google Scholar). Several cytokines, growth factors, and other agents control the regulation of cell motility. Phosphatidylinositol 3′-kinase (PI 3′-kinase) also plays significant role in regulation of cell motility (14Derman M.P. Toker A. Hartwig J.H. Spokes K. Falck J.R. Chen C.-S. Cantley L.C. Cantley L.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 6465-6470Google Scholar). Two subunits are present among all of the classes of PI 3′-kinases. One is catalytic subunit p110 (α, β, δ) or p110γ, and the other is regulatory subunit p85 (α, β, p55γ, and p101) (15Domin J. Waterfield M.D. FEBS Lett. 1997; 410: 91-95Google Scholar). The regulatory subunit of PI 3′-kinase is responsible for B cell development and proliferation (16Suzuki H. Terauchi Y. Fujiwara M. Aizawa S. Yazaki Y. Kadowaki T. Koyasu S. Science. 1999; 283: 390-392Google Scholar), and the catalytic subunits are critical for chemotactic activity (17Vanhaesebroeck B. Jones G.E. Allen W.E. Zicha D. Hooshmand-Rad R. Sawyer C. Waterfield M.D. Ridley A.J. Nat. Cell Biol. 1999; 1: 69-71Google Scholar). The activation of NFκB is regulated by a number of proinflammatory stimuli (18Bauerle P.A. Baltimore D. Cell. 1996; 87: 13-20Google Scholar, 19Baldwin A.S. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1996; 14: 649-681Google Scholar). The NFκB family consists of several members including p65, p50, RelB, and c-Rel molecules (18Bauerle P.A. Baltimore D. Cell. 1996; 87: 13-20Google Scholar). The activity of NFκB is also tightly controlled by its inhibitor, IκB family of proteins (20Karin M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 27339-27342Google Scholar). NFκB forms a complex with IκBα, and the complex can be removed from the nucleus by exportin-mediated transport to the cytoplasm. Recent report indicated that constitutively active PI 3′-kinase controls the activation of NFκB by the association of tyrosine-phosphorylated IκBα with the regulatory subunit of PI 3′-kinase, p85α (21Beraud C.M. Henzel W.J. Baeuerle P.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 429-434Google Scholar). The recent data also demonstrated that interleukin-1 stimulates PI 3′-kinase dependent phosphorylation and transactivation of NFκB without nuclear translocation of NFκB, indicating an alternative pathway other than IκBα-mediated pathway (22Sizemore N. Leung S. Stark G.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 4798-4805Google Scholar). But the molecular mechanism by which Syk, a tyrosine kinase, regulates the PI 3′-kinase dependent activation of NFκB in breast cancer cells is not well defined. Urokinase-type plasminogen activator (uPA) is a member of the serine protease family which induces the conversion of plasminogen to plasmin (23Besser D. Verde P. Nagamine Y. Blasi F. Fibrinolysis. 1996; 10: 214-237Google Scholar). Plasmin regulates cell invasion by degrading matrix proteins such as fibronectin, type IV collagen, and laminin or indirectly by activating matrix metalloproteinases and uPA (24Sheela S. Barrett J.C. Carcinogenesis. 1982; 3: 363-369Google Scholar, 25Dano K. Andreasen P.A. Grondahl-Hansen J. Kristensen P. Nielsen L.S. Skriver L. Adv. Cancer Res. 1985; 44: 139-266Google Scholar, 26Murphy G.

Previous reports shown that uPA plays a significant role in tumor growth and metastasis. The signaling pathway by which Syk controls uPA secretion through PI 3′-kinase-dependent activation of NFκB is not clearly understood. In this study, we demonstrate that overexpression of wild type Syk in MDA-MB-231 cells suppressed cell motility and reduced PI 3′-kinase activity. Syk-specific antisense phosphorothioate oligonucleotide (ASSyk), when transfected to MCF-7 cells, increased cell motility and up-regulated PI 3′-kinase activity. Pervanadate (pV) stimulated PI 3′-kinase activity and induced transactivation of NFκB through tyrosine phosphorylation of IκBα, whereas Syk down-regulated the NFκB activity by inhibiting tyrosine phosphorylation of IκBα in these cells. Syk, PI 3′-kinase inhibitor, and NFκB inhibitors inhibited cell motility and uPA secretion in these cells. Taken together, Syk suppressed cell motility, uPA secretion, and PI 3′-kinase-mediated NFκB activation by inhibiting the interaction between the p85α subunits of PI 3′-kinase and tyrosine-phosphorylated IκBα. DISCUSSIONIn this study, we have demonstrated that Syk, a nonreceptor protein-tyrosine kinase, inhibited PI 3′-kinase activity and subsequently suppressed cell motility in both highly invasive (MDA-MB-231) and low invasive (MCF-7) breast cancer cells. Syk is expressed in MCF-7 cells, but its expression is not detectable in highly invasive MDA-MB-231 cells. The wild type Syk cDNA was transfected in MDA-MB-231 cells, and its expression and autophosphorylation activity in these cells were comparable with the endogenous Syk activity in MCF-7 cells (data not shown). Furthermore, we have demonstrated that Syk suppresses the pV-induced interaction of p85 subunit of PI 3′-kinase and tyrosine-phosphorylated IκBα. Syk reduced the NFκB luciferase activity and piceatannol, a Syk inhibitor, enhanced the NFκB activity in both MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 cells. The inhibition of PI 3′-kinase activity down-regulates the NFκB transactivation as well as cell motility in these cells. Moreover, inhibition of PI 3′-kinase and NFκB activities by their specific inhibitors reduced uPA secretion and cell motility in these cells. Syk also inhibits the uPA secretion in both MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 cells. These data demonstrated that Syk suppresses cell motility and down-regulates NFκB activity by inhibiting the PI 3′-kinase activity and uPA secretion in both MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 cells.ZAP-70, a nonreceptor protein-tyrosine kinase that shares the same tandem SH2 domains with Syk at the amino terminus, was not detected in the breast cancer cells (data not shown).

Thus we conclude that Syk-regulated transactivation of NFκB is independent of NFκB-DNA binding in breast cancer cells.We have shown that MDA-MB-231 cells transfected with wild type Syk but not with SykK− suppressed the cellular migration and treatment of wild type Syk-transfected cells with increasing concentrations of piceatannol enhanced the cell migration in these cells. Both wortmannin and LY294002 inhibited, but pV induced the migration of MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 cells. The pV-induced migration is blocked by wortmannin or LY294002 in these cells. Similarly, the NFκB inhibitory peptide SN-50, curcumin, and protein synthesis inhibitor (actinomycin-D) reduced cell migration. Pretreatment of nontransfected or Syk-transfected cells with anti-uPA antibody reduced the migration of these cells. These data suggested that Syk suppressed the cell migration by down-regulating the constitutively active NFκB activation and uPA secretion by inhibiting the PI 3′-kinase activity in breast cancer cells.Our data also revealed that pV induces tyrosine phosphorylation of IκBα and subsequently enhances the interaction between tyrosine-phosphorylated IκBα with the p85α domain of PI 3′-kinase in a time-dependent manner in both cell lines. ST 638, a tyrosine kinase inhibitor, blocked the pV-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of IκBα. However, pV had no effect on serine phosphorylation of IκBα in these cells, suggesting that pV-induced transactivation of NFκB occurs through tyrosine phosphorylation of IκBα. Syk suppressed the tyrosine phosphorylation of IκBα and reduced the interaction between tyrosine-phosphorylated IκBα and p85 subunit of PI 3′-kinase. These data demonstrated that Syk regulates the transactivation of NFκB by inhibiting the direct interaction of tyrosine-phosphorylated IκBα and the p85 domain of PI 3′-kinase and suggested an alternative pathway not involving the phosphorylation and degradation of IκBα pathways.Matrix metalloproteinases play a major role in the regulation of cancer cell migration, extracellular matrix invasion, and metastasis by degrading the extracellular matrix proteins (3Liotta L.A. Steeg P.S. Stetler-Stevenson W.G. Cell. 1992; 71: 411-421Google Scholar, 4Testa J.E. Quigley J.P. Cancer Metastasis Rev. 1990; 9: 353-367Google Scholar, 36Murphy G. Gavrilovic J. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1990; 11: 614-621Google Scholar). We and others have shown recently that NFκB plays significant roles in the activation of matrix metalloproteinases-1, -2, -3, and -9 (27Philip S. Bulbule A. Kundu G.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 44926-44935Google Scholar, 37Hansen S.K. Nerlov C. Zabel U. Verde P. Johnsen M. Baeuerle P.A. Blasi F. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 205-213Google Scholar, 38Bond M. Baker A.H. Newby A.C. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 264: 561-567Google Scholar). uPA is also responsible for the migration and regulation of matrix metalloproteinases activation through NFκB-mediated pathways (39Bond M. Fabunmi R.P. Baker A.H. Newby A.C. FEBS Lett. 1998; 435: 29-34Google Scholar). In this study, we have detected the level of uPA in both highly invasive (MDA-MB-231) and low invasive (MCF-7) breast cancer cells. The constitutive secretion of uPA is significantly higher in MDA-MB-231 cells; however, a low level of uPA expression is observed in MCF-7 cells. The data also indicate that Syk down-regulates whereas pV up-regulates the uPA production in these cells. The PI 3′-kinase inhibitors wortmannin and LY294002 or the NFκB inhibitor SN-50 reduced uPA secretion, especially in MDA-MB-231 cells.In summary, we have demonstrated for the first time that overexpression of wild type Syk kinase but not the SykK− suppresses cell motility and reduces the activation of PI 3′-kinase in MDA-MB-231 cells. In contrast, in ASSyk but not SSyk, when transfected to the MCF-7 cells, the level of PI 3′-kinase activity as well as cell motility were increased. In the wild type Syk cDNA-transfected MDA-MB-231 cells, when treated with piceatannol, a Syk inhibitor, PI 3′-kinase activity increased. pV, a tyrosine phosphatase inhibitor, enhances the activity of PI 3′-kinase and induces the interaction between p85α, the regulatory subunit of PI 3′-kinase, and IκBα through tyrosine phosphorylation of IκBα. Syk suppresses the transactivation of NFκB by inhibiting the tyrosine phosphorylation of IκBα. PI 3′-kinase inhibitor reduces the pV-induced transactivation of NFκB. Both PI 3′-kinase inhibitors wortmannin and LY294002 and NFκB inhibitory peptide SN-50 suppress cell motility, indicating that PI 3′-kinase and NFκB play significant roles in this process. ASSyk-transfected MCF-7 cells enhanced uPA secretion, whereas wild type Syk cDNA-transfected MDA-MB-231 cells reduced uPA production, indicating that Syk down-regulates uPA secretion. These data suggested that Syk suppresses the NFκB transactivation by inhibiting the direct interaction of tyrosine-phosphorylated IκBα with the p85α domain of PI 3′-kinase in breast cancer cells. Finally, these data demonstrated that Syk down-regulates PI 3′-kinase activity and suppresses the constitutive NFκB activity and uPA secretion that ultimately lead to the suppression of cell motility of breast cancer cells (Fig. 9). These findings may be useful in designing novel therapeutic interventions using Syk as a target molecule that will disrupt the PI 3′-kinase and NFκB signaling pathways, resulting in reduction of uPA secretion and consequent blocking of invasiveness, migration, and metastatic spread of breast cancer. In this study, we have demonstrated that Syk, a nonreceptor protein-tyrosine kinase, inhibited PI 3′-kinase activity and subsequently suppressed cell motility in both highly invasive (MDA-MB-231) and low invasive (MCF-7) breast cancer cells. Syk is expressed in MCF-7 cells, but its expression is not detectable in highly invasive MDA-MB-231 cells. The wild type Syk cDNA was transfected in MDA-MB-231 cells, and its expression and autophosphorylation activity in these cells were comparable with the endogenous Syk activity in MCF-7 cells (data not shown). Furthermore, we have demonstrated that Syk suppresses the pV-induced interaction of p85 subunit of PI 3′-kinase and tyrosine-phosphorylated IκBα. Syk reduced the NFκB luciferase activity and piceatannol, a Syk inhibitor, enhanced the NFκB activity in both MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 cells. The inhibition of PI 3′-kinase activity down-regulates the NFκB transactivation as well as cell motility in these cells. Moreover, inhibition of PI 3′-kinase and NFκB activities by their specific inhibitors reduced uPA secretion and cell motility in these cells. Syk also inhibits the uPA secretion in both MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 cells. These data demonstrated that Syk suppresses cell motility and down-regulates NFκB activity by inhibiting the PI 3′-kinase activity and uPA secretion in both MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 cells. ZAP-70, a nonreceptor protein-tyrosine kinase that shares the same tandem SH2 domains with Syk at the amino terminus, was not detected in the breast cancer cells (data not shown). Previous reports have indicated that pV, a phosphotyrosine phosphatase inhibitor, induces autophosphorylation of Syk in MCF-7 cells (13Coopmen P.J.P. Do M.T.H. Barth M. Bowden E.T. Hayes A.J. Basyuk E. Blancato J.K. Vezza P.R. McLeskey S.W. Mangeat P.H. Mueller S.C. Nature. 2000; 406: 742-747Google Scholar). However, our data revealed that pV had no effect on activation of Syk in MCF-7 cells. Earlier reports have shown that PI 3′-kinase signaling is required for depolarization and cell migration of MCF-7 cells by insulin-like growth factor I (31Guvakova M.A. Surmacz E. Exp. Cell Res. 1999; 251: 244-255Google Scholar). The data also suggested that increased PI 3′-kinase activity is correlated with the migratory potential and metastatic activity of highly invasive breast cancer (MDA-MB-231) cells (30Sliva D. Rizzo M.T. English D. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 3150-3157Google Scholar). Using genetic (wild type Syk and SykK−) and pharmacological (piceatannol) inhibitors of Syk, we have demonstrated that Syk is involved in the suppression of cell motility, PI 3′-kinase activity, and NFκB-mediated uPA secretion in both MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 cells. The p110 isoforms of PI 3′-kinase played significant roles in cell migration, and differential activation of specific p110 isoforms is responsible for particular signaling events in different cell types (32Sasaki T. Irie-Sasaki J. Jones R.G. Oliviera-dos-Santos A.J. Stanford W.L. Bolon B. Wakeham A. Itie A. Bouchard D. Kozieradzki I. Joza N. Mak T.W. Ohashi P.S. Suzuki A. Penninger J.M.

Recently, Sliva et al. (30Sliva D. Rizzo M.T. English D. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 3150-3157Google Scholar) reported that the regulatory p85α subunit of PI 3′-kinase is essential for enhanced migration of metastatic tumor cells because overexpression of a dominant negative regulatory subunit (p85DN) drastically reduced the cell migration. It has been documented recently that PI 3′-kinase plays a significant role in NFκB activation in different cell types (34Reddy S.A.G. Huang J.H. Liao W.S.-L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 29167-29173Google Scholar, 35Pan Z.K. Christiansen S.C. Ptasznik A. Zuraw B.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 9918-9922Google Scholar). Tumor necrosis factor α-induced NFκB activation is not affected by PI 3′-kinase inhibitors (wortmannin and LY294002). Similarly, a PI 3′-kinase inhibitor has no effect on interleukin-1-dependent IκBα degradation, nuclear translocation of NFκB, and NFκB-DNA binding (22Sizemore N. Leung S. Stark G.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 4798-4805Google Scholar). Our results demonstrated that Syk down-regulates NFκB transactivation by inhibiting the interaction between the tyrosine-phosphorylated IκBα and the p85 subunit of PI 3′-kinase. Earlier reports have shown that pV and tumor necrosis factor α induced NFκB activation in Jurkat cells, and only pV-induced activation of NFκB is inhibited by wortmannin (21Beraud C.M. Henzel W.J. Baeuerle P.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 429-434Google Scholar). Both wortmannin and LY294002 abrogated the transactivation of NFκB but had no effect on NFκB-DNA binding in MDA-MB-231 cells (30Sliva D. Rizzo M.T. English D. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 3150-3157Google Scholar). Our data also revealed that Syk and PI 3′-kinase inhibitors down-regulate the transactivation of NFκB but not NFκB-DNA binding (data not shown) in both MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 cells. Thus we conclude that Syk-regulated transactivation of NFκB is independent of NFκB-DNA binding in breast cancer cells. We have shown that MDA-MB-231 cells transfected with wild type Syk but not with SykK− suppressed the cellular migration and treatment of wild type Syk-transfected cells with increasing concentrations of piceatannol enhanced the cell migration in these cells.

https://openalex.org/W2005477432,"Mcl-1L (myeloid cell leukemia-1 long) is an antiapoptotic Bcl-2 family protein discovered as an early induction gene during leukemia cell differentiation. Previously, we identified Mcl-1S (short) as a short splicing variant of theMcl-1 gene with proapoptotic activity. To identify Mcl-1-interacting proteins, we performed yeast two-hybrid screening and found cDNAs encoding tankyrase 1. This protein possesses poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase activity and presumably facilitates the turnover of substrates following ADP-ribosylation. In yeast and mammalian cells, tankyrase 1 interacts with both Mcl-1L and Mcl-1S, but does not bind to other Bcl-2 family proteins tested. Analysis of truncated tankyrase 1 mutants indicated that the first 10 ankyrin repeats are involved in interaction with Mcl-1. In the N terminus of Mcl-1, a stretch of 25 amino acids is sufficient for binding to tankyrase 1. Overexpression of tankyrase 1 antagonizes both Mcl-1L-mediated cell survival and Mcl-1S-induced cell death. Furthermore, coexpression of tankyrase 1 with Mcl-1L or Mcl-1S decreased the levels of Mcl-1 proteins. Although tankyrase 1 down-regulates Mcl-1 protein expression, no ADP-ribosylation of Mcl-1 was detected. In contrast, overexpression of Mcl-1 proteins suppressed the ADP-ribosylation of the telomeric repeat binding factor 1, another tankyrase 1-interacting protein. Thus, interaction of Mcl-1L and Mcl-1S with tankyrase 1 could serve as a unique mechanism to decrease the expression of these Bcl-2 family proteins, thereby leading to the modulation of the apoptosis pathway.

Phylogenetically conserved Bcl-2 family proteins play a pivotal role in the regulation of apoptosis from virus to human (1Adams J.M. Cory S. Science. 1998; 281: 1322-1326Crossref PubMed Scopus (4780) Google Scholar). Members of the Bcl-2 family consist of antiapoptotic proteins such as Bcl-2, Bcl-xL, and Bcl-w, and proapoptotic proteins such as BAD, Bax, BOD, and Bok. It has been proposed that anti- and proapoptotic Bcl-2 proteins regulate cell death by binding to each other and forming heterodimers (2Yang E. Zha J. Jockel J. Boise L.H. Thompson C.B. Korsmeyer S.J. Cell. 1995; 80: 285-291Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1883) Google Scholar). A delicate balance between anti- and proapoptotic Bcl-2 family members exists in each cell and the relative concentration of these two groups of proteins determines whether the cell survives or undergoes apoptosis.Myeloid cell leukemia-1(Mcl-1) 1The abbreviations used are: Mcl-1, myeloid cell leukemia-1; BH domain, Bcl-2 homology domain; Mcl-1L, Mcl-1 long; Mcl-1S, Mcl-1 short; TRF1, telomeric repeat binding factor 1; CHO, Chinese hamster ovary; HA, hemagglutinin; PARP, poly(adenosine diphosphate ribose) polymerase; IRAP, insulin-responsive aminopeptidase 1The abbreviations used are: Mcl-1, myeloid cell leukemia-1; BH domain, Bcl-2 homology domain; Mcl-1L, Mcl-1 long; Mcl-1S, Mcl-1 short; TRF1, telomeric repeat binding factor 1; CHO, Chinese hamster ovary; HA, hemagglutinin; PARP, poly(adenosine diphosphate ribose) polymerase; IRAP, insulin-responsive aminopeptidase is a Bcl-2 family protein and was originally cloned as a differentiation-induced early gene that was activated in a human myeloblastic leukemia cell line (3Kozopas K.M.

Although both Mcl-1L and Mcl-1S proteins contain BH domains found in other Bcl-2 family proteins, they are distinguished by their unusually long N-terminal sequences containing PEST (proline, glutamic acid, serine, and threonine) motifs, four pairs of arginine residues, and alanine- and glycine-rich regions. In addition, the tissue expression pattern of the Mcl-1 protein is different from that of Bcl-2 suggesting a unique role for Mcl-1 in apoptosis regulation (4Krajewski S. Bodrug S. Krajewska M.

Unlike other known tankyrase 1-interacting proteins, tankyrase 1 did not poly(ADP-ribosyl)ate either of the Mcl-1 proteins despite its ability to decrease Mcl-1 protein levels following coexpression. Therefore, tankyrase 1 could regulate Mcl-1-modulated apoptosis by down-regulating the expression of Mcl-1 proteins without the involvement of its ADP-ribosylation activity.DISCUSSIONMcl-1, a unique Bcl-2 family protein, is transiently induced by various growth factors and shows a rapid turnover rate (20Akgul C. Moulding D.A. White M.R. Edwards S.W. FEBS Lett. 2000; 478: 72-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar, 21Schubert K.M. Duronio V. Biochem. J. 2001; 356: 473-480Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Earlier studies demonstrated that Mcl-1 expression is up-regulated by epidermal growth factor, elk-1, granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor, gonadotropins, stem cell factor, interferon-α, and different interleukins in diverse cell lineages (22Puthier D.

Oncogene. 2001; 20: 5799-5809Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). Despite numerous studies on the induction of Mcl-1, no information is available regarding the suppression of the rapidly induced Mcl-1 proteins. Based on yeast two-hybrid screening, we identified an Mcl-1-interacting protein, tankyrase 1, that could provide a novel mechanism to decrease the levels and to suppress the actions of both Mcl-1L and its splicing variant Mcl-1S.We demonstrated that overexpression of tankyrase 1 suppressed cell survival induced by Mcl-1L. In addition, tankyrase 1 also effectively blocked apoptosis induced by Mcl-1S. In contrast, overexpression of tankyrase 1 itself exhibited no significant effect on CHO cell viability, consistent with a recent observation (34Kaminker P.G. Kim S.H. Taylor R.D. Zebarjadian Y. Funk W.D. Morin G.B. Yaswen P. Campisi J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 35891-35899Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). Furthermore, immunoblot studies showed that coexpression of tankyrase 1 resulted in lower levels of both Mcl-1L and Mcl-1S proteins. Thus, tankyrase 1-mediated changes in cell viability may be related to its ability to down-regulate Mcl-1 proteins. The finding of endogenous interactions between Mcl-1L and tankyrase 1 in a human leukemia cell line further supports the physiological importance of the present findings.More than 20 known mammalian Bcl-2 family proteins share common regulatory mechanisms to modulate apoptosis. They dimerize with other Bcl-2 family members (1Adams J.M. Cory S. Science. 1998; 281: 1322-1326Crossref PubMed Scopus (4780) Google Scholar) or interact with specific interacting proteins. For instance, BAD binding to 14-3-3 proteins suppresses the apoptotic activity of BAD (18Hsu S.Y. Kaipia A. Zhu L. Hsueh A.J. Mol. Endocrinol. 1997; 11: 1858-1867Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar, 27Zha J. Harada H. Yang E. Jockel J. Korsmeyer S.J. Cell. 1996; 87: 619-628Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2241) Google Scholar), whereas Bim/BOD binding to the LC8 dynein light chain leads to its sequestration to the microtubule-associated dynein motor complex (28Puthalakath H. Huang D.C. O'Reilly L.A. King S.M. Strasser A. Mol. Cell. 1999; 3: 287-296Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (904) Google Scholar). Likewise, Bmf interacts with the dynein light chain 2 before being sequestered to the myosin V actin motor complex (29Puthalakath H. Villunger A. O'Reilly L.A. Beaumont J.G. Coultas L. Cheney R.E. Huang D.C. Strasser A. Science. 2001; 293: 1829-1832Crossref PubMed Scopus (497) Google Scholar), leading to apoptosis suppression. Here, we have demonstrated that both Mcl-1L and Mcl-1S are strongly associated with tankyrase 1 in yeast and mammalian cells. Interactions of tankyrase 1 with Mcl-1 proteins were specific because none of the other members of the Bcl-2 family that were tested bound to tankyrase 1.The antiapoptotic Mcl-1L protein consists of two consensus PEST sequences as well as the BH3, BH1, BH2, and a transmembrane domain. However, the proapoptotic splicing variant, Mcl-1S, possesses only the PEST sequences and the BH3 domain. The common N-terminal end of both Mcl-1 proteins contain the two PEST motifs and four pairs of arginine residues found in rapidly degraded proteins such as c-Myc and p53 (30Rogers S. Wells R. Rechsteiner M. Science. 1986; 234: 364-368Crossref PubMed Scopus (1946) Google Scholar). Although the deletion of these two PEST sequences in Mcl-1 does not affect the half-life of the mutant protein (20Akgul C. Moulding D.A. White M.R. Edwards S.W. FEBS Lett. 2000; 478: 72-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar), the extreme N-terminal end of Mcl-1 has a stretch of residues with a weak PEST homology. We demonstrated that the binding of Mcl-1 proteins to tankyrase 1 involves this short stretch of 25 amino acids (76 to 100). Of interest, the same region also contains aRPPPIG sequence that resembles the consensus tankyrase-binding motif (RXXPDG) found in other tankyrase 1-interacting proteins (31Sbodio J.I. Lodish H.F. Chi N.W. Biochem. J. 2002; 361: 451-459Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar).Tankyrase 1 possesses four distinct motifs: the HPS module, 24 ankyrin motifs, SAM, and the catalytic domain of PARP (9Smith S. Giriat I. Schmitt A. de Lange T. Science. 1998; 282: 1484-1487Crossref PubMed Scopus (895) Google Scholar). Tankyrase 1 is a unique protein with structural features found in both ankyrin and PARP family genes. Ankyrin family proteins are linkers that couple diverse membrane proteins via ankyrin motifs to the underlying cytoskeleton (32Bennett V. Chen L. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2001; 13: 61-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar, 33Rubtsov A.M. Lopina O.D. FEBS Lett. 2000; 482: 1-5Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). All known tankyrase 1-interacting proteins (TRF1, IRAP, and TAB182) bind to tankyrase 1 through ankyrin repeat regions (9Smith S. Giriat I. Schmitt A. de Lange T. Science. 1998; 282: 1484-1487Crossref PubMed Scopus (895) Google Scholar, 11Chi N.W. Lodish H.F. J. Biol.

Chem. 2002; 277: 14116-14126Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Likewise, our data indicated that interactions between Mcl-1 proteins and tankyrase 1 also involved the ankyrin motifs, and the first half of the ankyrin repeats (1 to 12) was sufficient for dimerization. Of particular interest, TRF1 and Mcl-1 are capable of binding to overlapping ankyrin repeats in tankyrase 1, suggesting potential competition between these tankyrase 1-interacting proteins.Tankyrase 1 contains the catalytic domain of PARP and is known to poly(ADP-ribosyl)ate its interacting proteins, TRF1, IRAP, and TAB182 (9Smith S. Giriat I. Schmitt A. de Lange T. Science. 1998; 282: 1484-1487Crossref PubMed Scopus (895) Google Scholar, 11Chi N.W. Lodish H.F. J. Biol.

PARP family proteins catalyze the attachment of the poly(ADP-ribose) moiety onto a protein acceptor using the substrate NAD+ (nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide), and ADP-ribosylation of proteins usually leads to protein inactivation (13Althaus F.R. Richter C. Mol. Biol. Biochem. Biophys. 1987; 37: 1-237PubMed Google Scholar, 14Burkle A. Biogerontology. 2000; 1: 41-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 15de Murcia G. Schreiber V.

Poirier G.G. Biochem. J. 1999; 342: 249-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar). However, our study demonstrated that tankyrase 1 does not poly(ADP-ribosyl)ate either of the Mcl-1 proteins. Furthermore, a tankyrase 1 mutant with the PARP domain deleted is still capable of decreasing the Mcl-1 protein levels and blocking the actions of the Mcl-1 proteins. These data suggest that the ability of tankyrase 1 to suppress both anti- and pro-apoptotic actions of the Mcl-1 proteins is not mediated by ADP-ribosylation of these proteins. The findings also suggest that tankyrase 1-interacting proteins are not always the substrates for tankyrase 1. Consistent with the unique structural features and subcellular localization of tankyrase 1, the current study suggests that tankyrase 1 is different from other PARP enzymes (9Smith S. Giriat I. Schmitt A. de Lange T. Science. 1998; 282: 1484-1487Crossref PubMed Scopus (895) Google Scholar, 11Chi N.W. Lodish H.F. J. Biol.

Of interest, tankyrase 2, a gene with 83% sequence identity to tankyrase 1, has recently been isolated (37Kuimov A.N. Kuprash D.V. Petrov V.N. Vdovichenko K.K. Scanlan M.J. Jongeneel C.V. Lagarkova M.A. Nedospasov S.A. Genes Immun. 2001; 2: 52-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 38Lyons R.J. Deane R. Lynch D.K. Ye Z.S. Sanderson G.M. Eyre H.J. Sutherland G.R. Daly R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 17172-17180Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar) and found to induce cell death in different cell lines (34Kaminker P.G. Kim S.H. Taylor R.D. Zebarjadian Y. Funk W.D. Morin G.B. Yaswen P. Campisi J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 35891-35899Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar).In addition to the tankyrase 1 regulation of Mcl-1 functions, Mcl-1 proteins could reciprocally regulate the function of tankyrase 1. When Mcl-1L or Mcl-1S are coincubated with tankyrase 1, auto-ADP-ribosylation of tankyrase 1 decreases in a Mcl-1 concentration-dependent manner. Although the physiological significance of the apparent decrease in poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation of tankyrase 1 is still unclear and one cannot completely rule out the nonspecific effects of unknown contaminants in the purified Mcl-1 preparation, Mcl-1 proteins caused a more profound suppression of the poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation of TRF1 in the same in vitro test. Because both Mcl-1 proteins and TRF1 interact with the ankyrin repeats in tankyrase 1, Mcl-1 proteins could compete with TRF1 for binding to tankyrase 1, leading to lower ADP-ribosylation of TRF1. Because tankyrase 1-mediated telomere extension is dependent on ADP-ribosylation of TRF1 (10Smith S. de Lange T. Curr. Biol. 2000; 10: 1299-1302Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (342) Google Scholar), inhibition of the ADP-ribosylation of TRF1 by Mcl-1 could prevent telomere elongation and facilitate cell senescence. This is consistent with the ability of tankyrase 1 to suppress the survival action of Mcl-1L, thus leading to the prevention of cell immortalization.Recent studies indicated that Mcl-1L is localized to the nucleus (39Fujise K. Zhang D. Liu J. Yeh E.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 39458-39465Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar,40Zhang D. Li F. Weidner D. Mnjoyan Z.H. Fujise K. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 37430-37438Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). and is involved in cell cycle regulation by interacting with the proliferating cell nuclear antigen (39Fujise K. Zhang D. Liu J. Yeh E.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 39458-39465Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). Mcl-1 also serves as a nuclear chaperone for another antiapoptotic protein, fortilin (40Zhang D. Li F. Weidner D. Mnjoyan Z.H. Fujise K. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 37430-37438Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Together with our observation of interactions between Mcl-1 and tankyrase 1, these findings suggest an important role of Mcl-1 in the regulation of diverse nuclear events including cell cycle regulation and telomere elongation. In conclusion, the observed interactions between Mcl-1 proteins and tankyrase 1 represent a novel mechanism for the regulation of the apoptosis function of Mcl-1 proteins. Because Mcl-1 could also regulate the function of tankyrase 1 and other nuclear proteins, Mcl-1 could play an important role in the coordinated regulation of cell survival, proliferation, and immortalization. Phylogenetically conserved Bcl-2 family proteins play a pivotal role in the regulation of apoptosis from virus to human (1Adams J.M. Cory S. Science. 1998; 281: 1322-1326Crossref PubMed Scopus (4780) Google Scholar). Members of the Bcl-2 family consist of antiapoptotic proteins such as Bcl-2, Bcl-xL, and Bcl-w, and proapoptotic proteins such as BAD, Bax, BOD, and Bok. It has been proposed that anti- and proapoptotic Bcl-2 proteins regulate cell death by binding to each other and forming heterodimers (2Yang E. Zha J. Jockel J. Boise L.H. Thompson C.B. Korsmeyer S.J. Cell. 1995; 80: 285-291Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1883) Google Scholar). A delicate balance between anti- and proapoptotic Bcl-2 family members exists in each cell and the relative concentration of these two groups of proteins determines whether the cell survives or undergoes apoptosis.

We and others recently identified a short splicing variant of Mcl-1 short (Mcl-1S) and designated the known Mcl-1 as Mcl-1 long (Mcl-1L) (6Bae J. Leo C.P. Hsu S.Y. Hsueh A.J. J. Biol.

Mcl-1L protein exhibits antiapoptotic activity and possesses the BH (Bcl-2 homology) 1, BH2, BH3, and transmembrane domains found in the related Bcl-2 proteins (3Kozopas K.M. Yang T. Buchan H.L.

Blood. 1998; 92: 3226-3239Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast, Mcl-1S is a BH3 domain-only proapoptotic protein that heterodimerizes with Mcl-1L (6Bae J. Leo C.P. Hsu S.Y. Hsueh A.J. J.

Although both Mcl-1L and Mcl-1S proteins contain BH domains found in other Bcl-2 family proteins, they are distinguished by their unusually long N-terminal sequences containing PEST (proline, glutamic acid, serine, and threonine) motifs, four pairs of arginine residues, and alanine- and glycine-rich regions. In addition, the tissue expression pattern of the Mcl-1 protein is different from that of Bcl-2 suggesting a unique role for Mcl-1 in apoptosis regulation (4Krajewski S. Bodrug S. Krajewska M.

Tankyrase 1 (TRF1-interacting,ankyrin-elated ADP-ribose polymerase 1) was originally isolated based on its binding to TRF1 (telomeric repeat bindingfactor-1) and contains the HPS (homopolymeric runs of histidine, proline, and serine) sequence, 24 ankyrin repeats, SAM (sterile α-motif), and the catalytic domain of poly(adenosine diphosphate-ribose) polymerase (PARP) (9Smith S. Giriat I. Schmitt A. de Lange T. Science. 1998; 282: 1484-1487Crossref PubMed Scopus (895) Google Scholar). Previous studies have shown that tankyrase 1 promotes telomere elongation in human cells by inhibiting TRF1 through its poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation by tankyrase 1 (9Smith S. Giriat I.

In addition, tankyrase 1 poly(ADP-ribosyl)atesinsulin-responsive aminopeptidase (IRAP), a resident protein of GLUT4 vesicles, and insulin stimulates the PARP activity of tankyrase 1 through its phosphorylation by mitogen-activated protein kinase (11Chi N.W. Lodish H.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 38437-38444Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar).

Sucrose gradient fractionation experiments and immunofluorescence studies with anti-N-WASP antibody revealed that N-WASP is recruited together with clathrin and dynamin, which play essential roles in clathrin-mediated endocytosis, to lipid rafts in an epidermal growth factor (EGF)-dependent manner. Endophilin A (EA) binds to dynamin and plays an essential role in the fission step of clathrin-mediated endocytosis.

Four principal steps in vesicular membrane traffic can be distinguished. First, the coated membrane is invaginated by the assembly of coat proteins and formation of the coated pits. This is followed by a pinching off of the coated vesicles, transport of the vesicles to the appropriate acceptor membrane, and fusion of the vesicles with this membrane. Numerous proteins and lipids are involved in and regulated properly in a molecular cascade (1Sorkin A. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 4375-4376Google Scholar). In mammalian cells, endocytosis of vesicles can occur via clathrin-coated pits, a clathrin-independent pathway, or caveolae. It is thought that endocytosis occurs at rafts, which are plasma membrane domains enriched in cholesterol and sphingolipids (2Simons K. Ikonen E. Nature. 1997; 387: 569-572Google Scholar, 3Ikonen E. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2001; 13: 470-477Google Scholar). Rafts also contain glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored proteins and various transmembrane proteins (4Skibbens J.E. Roth M.G. Matlin K.S. J.

Waters C.M. Bioessays. 1993; 15: 375-382Google Scholar). EGF-activated receptors are internalized via the clathrin-coated pit pathway (10Sorkin A. Mazzotti M. Sorkina T. Scotto L. Beguinot L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 13377-13384Google Scholar) through interactions with the clathrin adaptor complex AP2 that recruits the clathrin triskelion (11Sorkin A. Carpenter G. Science. 1993; 261: 612-615Google Scholar). Various accessory proteins, such as Eps15 and Epsin, are recruited to the AP2-clathrin complex and subsequently form an endocytic clathrin coat (12Brodin L. Low P. Shupliakov O. Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 2000; 10: 312-320Google Scholar). The clathrin-adaptor coats undergo rearrangement, resulting in invagination of the coated membrane, i.e. the clathrin-coated pit (13Springer S. Spang A. Schekman R. Cell. 1999; 97: 145-148Google Scholar). For constriction from shallow to deeply invaginated coated pits and fission, endophilin A (EA) and dynamin are recruited to the rim of the polymerizing clathrin coat (14Hannah M.J. Schmidt A.A. Huttner W.B. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1999; 15: 733-798Google Scholar). EA has lysophosphatidic acid acyltransferase (LPA-AT) activity that catalyzes transfer of fatty acids from co-enzyme A to LPA, thereby generating phosphatidic acid (PA) (15Schmidt A. Wolde M. Thiele C. Fest W. Kratzin H. Podtelejnikov A.V. Witke W. Huttner W.B. Soling H.D. Nature. 1999; 401: 133-141Google Scholar). This shift in the biophysical properties of phospholipids in the cytoplasmic leaflet of the membrane bilayer would cause inward distortion of the luminal leaflets and subsequent membrane fission (16Scales S.J. Scheller R.H. Nature. 1999; 401: 123-124Google Scholar). This finding was confirmed by a recent study (17Ringstad N. Gad H. Low P. Di Paolo G. Brodin L. Shupliakov O. De Camilli P. Neuron. 1999; 24: 143-154Google Scholar) showing that microinjection of an antibody against EA into lamprey reticulospinal synapses interferes with synaptic vesicle recycling and clathrin-coated vesicle formation. The 100-kDa GTPase dynamin acts as an essential factor in the fission stage of clathrin-mediated endocytosis (18Sever S. Damke H. Schmid S.L. Traffic. 2000; 1: 385-392Google Scholar). Dynamin assembles at the site of fission and garrotes the membrane in a process driven by GTP hydrolysis (19Takei K. McPherson P.S. Schmid S.L. De Camilli P. Nature. 1995; 374: 186-190Google Scholar). It was reported that purified dynamin causes vesiculation of liposomes in vitro in a GTP-dependent fashion (20Sever S. Muhlberg A.B. Schmid S.L. Nature. 1999; 398: 481-486Google Scholar). The newly formed detached clathrin-coated vesicles were internalized and moved through the cytoplasm to early endosomes. Vesicular trafficking at the plasma membrane would require rearrangement of the cortical actin filaments to remove the barrier to vesicular fusion or budding events (21Qualmann B. Kessels M.M. Kelly R.B. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 150: 111-116Google Scholar). Actin filaments and actin-based motor proteins play an essential role in endocytosis in yeast (22Kubler E. Riezman H. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 2855-2862Google Scholar, 23Benedetti H. Raths S. Crausaz F. Riezman H. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1994; 5: 1023-1037Google Scholar, 24Munn A.L. Stevenson B.J. Geli M.I. Riezman H. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1995; 6: 1721-1742Google Scholar, 25Geli M.I. Riezman H. Science. 1996; 272: 533-535Google Scholar). It was also reported that treatment of several actin-disrupting agents inhibit receptor-mediated endocytosis in mammalian cells (26Gottlieb T.A. Ivanov I.E. Adesnik M. Sabatini D.D. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 120: 695-710Google Scholar, 27Lamaze C. Fujimoto L.M. Yin H.L. Schmid S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 20332-20335Google Scholar). These data suggest that the actin cytoskeleton plays an essential role in endocytosis. The actin-related protein 2/3 (Arp2/3) complex enhances the nucleation and polymerization of actin filaments to promote filament assembly in vivo (28Machesky L.M. Atkinson S.J. Ampe C. Vandekerckhove J. Pollard T.D. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 127: 107-115Google Scholar,29Mullins R.D. Heuser J.A. Pollard T.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 6181-6186Google Scholar). Neural Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome protein (N-WASP) plays an essential role in Arp2/3-dependent actin dynamics by enhancing Arp2/3 complex-induced nucleation of actin filaments (30Miki H. Sasaki T. Takai Y. Takenawa T. Nature. 1998; 391: 93-96Google Scholar). N-WASP contains a WASP homology domain, a Cdc42 binding domain, a proline-rich domain, two G-actin-binding verprolin-homology domains, a cofilin-homology domain, and a carboxyl-terminal acidic segment (31Miki H. Miura K. Takenawa T. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 5326-5335Google Scholar). The verprolin-homology-cofilin-homology-acidic (VCA) domain of N-WASP is an essential minimal region for activation of Arp2/3 complex. At rest, N-WASP is thought to be an auto-inhibited through an intramolecular interaction between its Cdc42 interaction and COOH-terminal domains (32Prehoda K.E. Scott J.A. Mullins R.D. Lim W.A. Science. 2000; 290: 801-806Google Scholar). Binding of GTP-bound Cdc42 and phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2) to N-WASP causes a conformational change in N-WASP that allows the VCA domain to interact with the Arp2/3 complex and initiate actin polymerization (33Rohatgi R. Ho H.Y. Kirschner M.W. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 150: 1299-1310Google Scholar). The yeast homologue of WASPs, Las17, was implicated in endocytosis (34Naqvi S.N. Zahn R. Mitchell D.A. Stevenson B.J. Munn A.L. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: 959-962Google Scholar), and lymphocytes from WASP knockout mice exhibited reduced actin polymerization and defective T cell receptor endocytosis (35Zhang J. Shehabeldin A. da Cruz L.A. Butler J. Somani A.K. McGavin M. Kozieradzki I. dos Santos A.O. Nagy A. Grinstein S. Penninger J.M. Siminovitch K.A. J. Exp. Med. 1999; 190: 1329-1342Google Scholar). These data suggest that N-WASP plays various roles at many steps of endocytosis. Here we show that EGF induces recruitment of N-WASP from the cytoplasm to rafts. We also show that N-WASP interacts with EA through its proline-rich domain, playing an essential role in the fission step of clathrin-mediated endocytosis. For expression in mammalian cells, several N-WASP constructs, inducing full-length N-WASP and proline-rich domain (amino acids 271–385)-deleted N-WASP (N-WASPΔP), were constructed in pcDL-SRα and pEYFP (Clontech). EA3 cDNA (gift from Dr. T. Endo, University of Chiba, Japan) was amplified by PCR with primers that introduced 5′ BamHI and 3′ HindIII sites. PCR products were cloned into theBamHI-HindIII sites of pCMV-tag3B (Clontech) and into the BglII andHindIII sites of pEGFP (Clontech) to produce proteins tagged with Myc and green fluorescence protein (GFP). To obtain the glutathione S-transferase (GST) fusion protein of EA (GST-EA), full-length EA3 cDNA was subcloned into pCMV-tag3B, cut with BamHI and XhoI, and inserted into pGEX-2T (Amersham Biosciences). GST fusion proteins of EA3, GST-EAΔSH3 (amino acids 1–254) and GST-SH3 (amino acids 278–348), were produced by in-frame insertion of the PCR-amplified fragment corresponding to each sequence into theBamHI-EcoRI sites of pGEX-2T. Anti-Myc antibody was purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, and the anti-clathrin heavy chain antibody (Ab-1) was from Oncogene. The anti-dynamin antibody (mouse clone 41), the anti-caveolin 1, the anti-Rab5, and the anti-phosphotyrosine antibody (PY20) were from Transduction Laboratories. The anti-N-WASP antibody was prepared as described (36Miki H. Takenawa T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 243: 73-78Google Scholar). The secondary antibodies linked to peroxidase were from Cappel. The secondary antibodies linked to fluorescein, Texas Red, and Cy5 were from Molecular Probes. HeLa cells plated on 150-mm dishes were serum-starved for 24 h and then stimulated with 100 ng/ml EGF (Invitrogen). After two washes with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), HeLa cells were scraped into 800 μl of 500 mmsodium carbonate (pH 11.0). The cell lysates were extruded through a 23-gauge needle 10 times and then sonicated for 5 min in a sonicator bath. One milliliter of the homogenate was then adjusted to 45% sucrose by the addition of 1 ml of 90% sucrose prepared in MES buffered saline (MBS) (25 mm MES, pH 6.5, 90% sucrose, 150 mm NaCl) and placed at the bottom of an ultracentrifuge tube (14 × 89 mm, Beckman Instruments). A discontinuous sucrose gradient was formed (2 ml of 5% sucrose/3 ml of 25% sucrose/3 ml of 35% sucrose; all in MBS containing 250 mm sodium carbonate) and centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 3 h in an SW41 rotor (Beckman Instruments). Proteins at the 5/25, 25/35, and 35/45% interfaces were collected and separated by SDS-PAGE (10% acrylamide) followed by Western blot analysis with the ECL detection system (Pierce). HeLa cells, A431 cells, and COS7 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. For immunofluorescence microscopy, 1 × 105 cells were plated on 2% gelatin-coated coverslips in 35-mm dishes. Cells were serum-starved for 24 h and then stimulated with 100 ng/ml EGF and fixed with 3.7% formaldehyde in PBS. Fixed cells were permeabilized with 0.2% Triton X-100 in PBS for 5 min and then incubated with primary antibodies for 60 min. After washing, cells were incubated with secondary antibodies. To stain EGF receptors, biotin-conjugated anti-EGF receptor (EGFR1, Biogenesis) was used as primary antibody and ultra avidin-rhodamine (Leinca Technologies, Inc.) as secondary antibody. To visualize actin filaments, rhodamine-conjugated phalloidin (Molecular Probes) was also added during the incubation with secondary antibodies. After a 30-min incubation, coverslips were washed and mounted on glass slides. Cells were observed with a confocal laser scanning microscope (MRC 1024; Bio-Rad). HeLa cells plated on coverslips were incubated with 10 mmmethyl-β-cyclodextrin (CDX, Sigma) in the serum-free DMEM, 50 mm HEPES (pH 7.6) at 37 °C for 1 h. After incubation in serum-free DMEM without CDX for 15 min, they cells were stimulated with 100 ng/ml EGF and fixed. COS7 cells were transfected in Opti-MEM (Invitrogen) using 6 μl of LipofectAMINE (Invitrogen) and 3 μg of plasmid DNA per 35-mm dish according to the manufacturer's instructions. The DNA/LipofectAMINE was maintained on the cells for 4 h, and the medium was then exchanged with maintenance medium. Twenty-four hours after transfection, cells were subjected to EGF internalization assay. For EGF stimulation, transfected cells were cultured for 2 h in maintenance medium and then for 24 h in serum-free DMEM. To obtain cell lysates, 20 μg of recombinant plasmid was mixed with 107 cells, and the mixtures were subjected to electroporation with a Gene Pulser (Bio-Rad). EGF-treated or transfected cells in 100-mm dishes were washed twice with ice-cold PBS and lysed in 200 μl of TGH buffer (50 mm HEPES (pH 7.6), 50 mmNaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 1 mm orthovanadate, 10% glycerol, 1% Triton X-100, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). After addition of 800 μl of IP buffer (50 mmHEPES (pH 7.6), 50 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 1 mm orthovanadate, 10% glycerol, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride), lysates were extruded 10 times through a 23-gauge needle and centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 5 min. Supernatants were mixed with 10 μg of anti-N-WASP antibody or anti-Myc antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) for 2 h. As a negative control, normal mouse IgG (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) or pre-immune rabbit serum was used. Then protein A- and G-agarose beads (Pierce) were added, and the mixtures were incubated for 1 h. Immunoprecipitates were washed three times with IP buffer and then analyzed by Western blotting. GST fusion proteins were expressed inEscherichia coli JM109 and purified from E. colilysates with glutathione-Sepharose beads (Amersham Biosciences) according to standard methods. GST fusion proteins were eluted with 50 mm glutathione in 10 mm HEPES (pH 7.6). Glutathione in the samples was removed by dialysis with IP buffer. Protein concentrations were measured by Bradford assays with bovine serum albumin as a standard. Twenty micrograms of the GST fusion proteins were immobilized on glutathione-Sepharose beads and mixed with HeLa cell lysates or COS7 cell lysates. After the beads were washed with IP buffer, they were suspended in SDS sample buffer and subjected to SDS-PAGE and Western blot analysis. Actin was purified from rabbit skeletal muscle, and monomeric actin was isolated by gel filtration on Superdex 200 (Amersham Biosciences) in G buffer (2 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 0.2 mm ATP, 0.2 mm CaCl2, 0.5 mm DTT). Arp2/3 complex was purified from bovine brain extracts as described previously (37Rohatgi R. Ma L. Miki H. Lopez M. Kirchhausen T. Takenawa T. Kirschner M.W. Cell. 1999; 97: 221-231Google Scholar). N-WASP was prepared with a baculovirus system as described previously (30Miki H. Sasaki T. Takai Y. Takenawa T. Nature. 1998; 391: 93-96Google Scholar). A GST fusion protein containing the verplorin homology, cofilin homology, acidic region (VCA domains) and the GST fusion protein of the Ash/Grb2 NH2-terminal SH3 domain was used as a positive control (36Miki H. Takenawa T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 243: 73-78Google Scholar). All GST fusion proteins used in the actin polymerization assay were eluted with 50 mm glutathione in 10 mmHEPES (pH 7.6). For the actin polymerization assay, phospholipid vesicles were prepared from phosphatidylcholine, egg (PC) (Avanti), phosphatidylinositol (PI) (Doosan Sedary Research Laboratories), PIP2 (Cell Signals, Inc), phosphatidic acid, dioleoyl (PA) (Sigma), and lysophosphatidic acid, oleoyl (LPA) (Sigma). Chloroform-dissolved phospholipids were mixed in the appropriate ratios (PC/PI (50:50), PC/PI/PIP2(48:48:4), PC/PI/PA (48:48:4), or PC/PI/LPA (48:48:4)) and dried under nitrogen. The dried lipid mixture was resuspended in lipid buffer (10 mm HEPES (pH 7.7), 100 mm NaCl, 5 mm EGTA, 50 mm sucrose) to a final concentration of 4 mm and then extruded through a 100-nm pore polycarbonate filter (Avanti) with the Mini-Extruder. The lipid vesicles were used at a final concentration of 2 or 5 μmin the assay. Actin polymerization was measured as the change in the fluorescence intensity of pyrene-labeled actin as described previously (36Miki H. Takenawa T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 243: 73-78Google Scholar). To follow actin polymerization with purified components, pyrene-labeled G-actin or unlabeled G-actin was isolated by incubation with freshly thawed proteins in G buffer (5 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 0.2 mm CaCl2, 0.2 mm ATP, 0.2 mm DTT) for 12 h at 4 °C followed by removal of residual F-actin by centrifugation at 40,000 × g for 1 h. Polymerization reaction mixtures contained 60 nm Arp2/3 complex and various proteins and lipids in 95 μl of the assay buffer (10 mmHEPES (pH 7.6), 100 mm KCl, 1 mmMgCl2, 0.1 mm EDTA, 1 mm DTT) and were preincubated for 5 min. The reaction was initiated by adding a 5-μl mixture of 40 μm unlabeled actin, 4 μm labeled actin, and 4 mm ATP to the preincubated reaction mixtures. The change in fluorescence was measured at 407 nm with excitation at 365 nm in a fluorescence spectrometer (Jasco). All kinetic analyses were performed with the software provided by the manufacturer. To study the function of N-WASP, we examined localization of N-WASP during EGF-induced endocytosis. It is believed that endocytosis occurs at particular sites in the plasma membrane called rafts (2Simons K. Ikonen E. Nature. 1997; 387: 569-572Google Scholar, 3Ikonen E. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2001; 13: 470-477Google Scholar). EGF-induced clathrin-coated vesicles are sorted primarily to early endosomes. Both rafts and early endosomes are rich in cholesterol and sphingolipid and can be separated from the cytosol by discontinuous sucrose gradient fractionation (38Song K.S. Scherer P.E. Tang Z. Okamoto T. Li S. Chafel M. Chu C. Kohtz D.S. Lisanti M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 15160-15165Google Scholar). The components of rafts and early endosomes were fractionated from lysates of EGF-stimulated HeLa cells to determine the EGF-dependent distribution of N-WASP. Raft components are enriched at the 5/25% interface of the gradient, whereas the early endosome marker early endosome antigen-1 (EEA1) is found at the 25/35% interface. The rest of the cell lysates, mainly cytosolic proteins, are localized at the 35/45% interface (38Song K.S. Scherer P.E. Tang Z. Okamoto T. Li S. Chafel M. Chu C. Kohtz D.S. Lisanti M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 15160-15165Google Scholar, 39Gagescu R. Demaurex N. Parton R.G. Hunziker W. Huber L.A. Gruenberg J. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 2775-2791Google Scholar). In the present study, caveolins, marker proteins of rafts, were detected in all fractions including the 5/25% interface (Fig. 1 A). This distribution did not change after EGF stimulation (data not shown). Rab5, a small GTPase associated with EEA1, was localized at the 25/35% interface (Fig. 1 A). These data indicate that raft components were localized at the 5/25% interface, and those of early endosomes were at the 25/35% interface. Hereafter, the collections of proteins at the 5/25, 25/35, and 35/45% interfaces will be referred to as the rafts fraction, EEA1 fraction, and cytosol fraction, respectively. Activated EGF-receptors were detected with an anti-phosphotyrosine antibody and used as a marker of internalized clathrin-coated vesicles. Phosphorylated receptors were detected in the rafts fraction at 1.5 min after EGF treatment and were then detected in the EEA1 fraction after 15 and 30 min (Fig. 1 B). This change in distribution supports the idea that EGF receptors are internalized from rafts to early endosomes via a clathrin-dependent pathway. Clathrin, localized at early endosomes and cytosol in unstimulated cells, was recruited to rafts and then subsequently moved to early endosomes similar to EGF receptors. In contrast to clathrin, dynamin was not detected in early endosomes prior to EGF stimulation. Dynamin was also recruited to rafts after EGF stimulation, but this recruitment was later than that of clathrin. This time difference supports the hypothesis that dynamin is recruited to the edge of the neck of the clathrin-coated pit (14Hannah M.J. Schmidt A.A. Huttner W.B. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1999; 15: 733-798Google Scholar). Like dynamin and many other proteins, N-WASP was detected in the cytosol fraction. After EGF treatment, N-WASP was recruited to rafts and then internalized into early endosomes (Fig. 1 B). The results of sucrose fractionation indicate that after EGF treatment, N-WASP was recruited approximately at the same time as clathrin. To visualize the recruitment of N-WASP induced by EGF, HeLa cells were stained with anti-N-WASP antibody (Fig. 1 C) before and after EGF stimulation. In serum-starved cells, N-WASP was localized in a dot-like pattern around the perinuclear region. At 1.5–5 min after EGF stimulation, N-WASP was located throughout the cytoplasm, and a portion was present at the plasma membrane (Fig. 1 C,left). The translocation of N-WASP was well observed at the cell periphery (Fig. 1 C), where membrane ruffles were induced upon EGF stimulation. After 15 and 30 min, N-WASP had returned to its resting localization pattern. CDX is a useful tool to extract cholesterol from biological membranes with high preference over other lipid species (40Rodal S.K. Skretting G. Garred O. Vilhardt F. van Deurs B. Sandvig K. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 961-974Google Scholar, 41Subtil A. Gaidarov I. Kobylarz K. Lampson M.A. Keen J.H. McGraw T.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 6775-6780Google Scholar). The major component of rafts is cholesterol, and therefore, CDX treatment should disrupt rafts in living cells. In the present study, CDX treatment inhibited uptake of the Texas Red-labeled EGF into HeLa cells (data not shown), suggesting that clathrin-mediated endocytosis is dependent upon rafts. In CDX-treated cells, N-WASP remained at the perinuclear region after EGF stimulation (Fig. 1 C,right), and no translocation to the plasma membrane was observed. These data suggest that EGF induces the recruitment of N-WASP to rafts in the plasma membrane and confirm the sucrose fractionation data. To examine whether N-WASP co-localizes with EGF receptor (EGFR) in rafts, EGF-treated A431 cells were double-stained with anti-EGFR and anti-N-WASP antibodies. At 1.5–5 min after EGF stimulation, EGFRs were accumulated to the plasma membranes together with N-WASP (Fig.1 D) and subsequently internalized with the clathrin-coated vesicles. The internalized EGFRs were co-localized clathrin and dynamin (data not shown). In CDX-treated cells, neither EGFR nor N-WASP showed recruitment to the plasma membranes (data not shown). These data suggest that both EGFR and N-WASP were recruited to raft fractions upon EGF stimulation. Some components of the endocytic machinery, such as Pacsin and Intersectin (42Merrifield C.J. Moss S.E. Ballestrem C. Imhof B.A. Giese G. Wunderlich I. Almers W. Nat. Cell Biol. 1999; 1: 72-74Google Scholar, 43Roos J. Kelly R.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 19108-19119Google Scholar), have been reported to bind to both dynamin and N-WASP. These proteins have SH3 domains and associate with dynamin and N-WASP through the proline-rich domains. EA also has an SH3 domain in its COOH terminus and binds to dynamin (44Simpson F. Hussain N.K. Qualmann B. Kelly R.B. Kay B.K. McPherson P.S. Schmid S.L. Nat. Cell Biol. 1999; 1: 119-124Google Scholar). EA has LPA-AT activity and plays an essential role in the fission step of clathrin-mediated endocytosis (45Huttner W.B. Schmidt A. Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 2000; 10: 543-551Google Scholar). We hypothesized that EA associates with N-WASP through its SH3 domain. To evaluate this hypothesis, we performed co-immunoprecipitation experiments. Myc-tagged full-length EA expression plasmids (Myc-EA) and full-length N-WASP expression plasmids were co-transfected transiently into COS7 cells, and the EA/N-WASP interaction was detected by Western blot analysis after precipitation of cell lysates with anti-N-WASP antibody or anti-Myc antibody (Fig.2 A). Both immunoprecipitates contained Myc-EA and N-WASP. Positive signals were specific, as preimmune serum and control IgG immunoprecipitates did not yield positive signals. These findings indicate that EA associates with N-WASP in vivo. We then examined whether the SH3 domain of EA can associate with the proline-rich domain of N-WASP. As shown in Fig. 2 B, we constructed a variety of GST fusion proteins of EA, including full-length (GST-EA), SH3 domain-deleted (GST-EAΔSH3), and domain only (GST-SH3). These fusion proteins were mixed with COS7 cell lysates for pull-down assays. Western blotting revealed that the precipitates collected with GST-EA and GST-SH3 contained dynamin and N-WASP (Fig.2 C). When the same assay was performed with lysates of cells in which proline-rich domain-deleted N-WASP (N-WASPΔP) was overexpressed, endogenous N-WASP but not N-WASPΔP was detected in precipitates (Fig. 2 D). These results show that the SH3 domain of EA interacts with the proline-rich domain. As shown in Fig. 2, when both Myc-EA and N-WASP were expressed transiently, association of EA and N-WASP was revealed by co-immunoprecipitation. But surprisingly, when only Myc-EA was transfected into COS7 cells and anti-N-WASP antibody immunoprecipitates were blotted with anti-Myc antibody, however, no signal was detected (Fig. 3 A). Because EA is a cytosolic enzyme, it may be recruited to rafts in an EGF-dependent manner together with N-WASP. Therefore, we tested the possibility that EGF might induce the interaction between N-WASP and EA.

In RK and Gα12/13 KO cells, LPA induced PKD activation through a phospholipase C/protein kinase C pathway in a concentration-dependent fashion with maximal stimulation (6-fold for RK cells and 4-fold for Gα12/13 KO cells in autophosphorylation activity) achieved at 3 μm. In contrast, LPA did not induce any significant increase in PKD activity in Gαq/11 KO cells. However, LPA induced a significantly increased PKD activity when Gαq/11 KO cells were transfected with Gαq. LPA-induced PKD activation was modestly attenuated by prior exposure of RK cells to pertussis toxin (PTx) but abolished by the combination treatments of PTx and Clostridium difficile toxin B. Surprisingly, PTx alone strikingly inhibited LPA-induced PKD activation in a concentration-dependent fashion in Gα12/13 KO cells. Similar results were obtained when activation loop phosphorylation at Ser-744 was determined using an antibody that detects the phosphorylated state of this residue. Our results indicate that Gq is necessary but not sufficient to mediate LPA-induced PKD activation. In addition to Gq, LPA requires additional G-protein pathways to elicit a maximal response with Gi playing a critical role in Gα12/13 KO cells. We conclude that LPA induces PKD activation through Gq, Gi, and G12 and propose that PKD activation is a point of convergence in the action of multiple G-protein pathways.

Trans. 1997; 25: 565-571Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). In particular, PKD is rapidly activated in intact cells through a mechanism that involves phosphorylation (8Rozengurt E. Sinnett-Smith J. Zugaza J.L. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 1997; 25: 565-571Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Specifically, exposure of intact cells to phorbol esters, cell-permeant diacylglycerols, or bryostatin induces rapid PKD phosphorylation and activation, which is maintained during cell lysis and immunoprecipitation (8Rozengurt E.

Several lines of evidence, including the use of PKC-specific inhibitors and co-transfection of PKD with constitutively active PKC mutants indicate that PKD is activated through a novel PKC-dependent signal transduction pathway in vivo (9Zugaza J.L. Sinnett-Smith J. Van Lint J. Rozengurt E. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6220-6230Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar, 10Yuan J. Bae D. Cantrell D. Nel A.E. Rozengurt E. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

The residues Ser-744 and Ser-748 in the activation loop of PKD have been identified as critical phosphorylation sites in PKD activation (14Iglesias T. Waldron R.T. Rozengurt E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 27662-27667Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar, 15Waldron R.T. Rey O. Iglesias T. Tugal T. Cantrell D. Rozengurt E. J. Biol.

Taken together, these results suggest an important connection between PKCs and PKD and indicate that PKD can function downstream of PKC in a novel signal transduction pathway. Heterotrimeric guanine nucleotide-binding regulatory proteins (G proteins) are composed of α, β, and γ subunits and transduce external signals from heptahelical receptors to intracellular effectors (16Offermanns S. Simon M.I. Cancer Surv. 1996; 27: 177-198PubMed Google Scholar). Mammalian G protein α subunits are classified into four subfamilies: Gs, Gi, Gq, and G12. The α subunit of Gq stimulates the β isoforms of phospholipase C (PLC), which catalyze the production of inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate that triggers the release of Ca2+ from internal stores and diacylglycerol that activates the classical and novel isoforms of PKC (reviewed in Ref. 17Exton J.H. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 1996; 36: 481-509Crossref PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar). A variety of neuropeptide agonists that signal through heptahelical receptors and couple to heterotrimeric G proteins, including bombesin, bradykinin, endothelin, and vasopressin, induce rapid PKD activation in normal and neoplastic cells (11Zugaza J.L.

Physiol. 2001; 280: C929-C942Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Although each of these receptors activates Gq and Gαqsignaling stimulates PKD activity (20Yuan J. Slice L. Walsh J.H. Rozengurt E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 2157-2164Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar), expression of a COOH-terminal fragment of Gαq that acts in a dominant-negative fashion, attenuated (but did not eliminate) PKD activation in response to agonist stimulation of bombesin receptor (20Yuan J. Slice L. Walsh J.H. Rozengurt E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 2157-2164Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). These results suggested that G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) stimulate PKD activation not only via Gαq but also through other G protein-mediated signaling pathways. Many GPCRs also interact with other heterotrimeric G proteins including members of the G12 family, which mediate activation of the low molecular weight G proteins of the Rho subfamily (21Hooley R.

Rho plays a major role in promoting cytoskeletal responses including formation of actin stress fibers, assembly of focal adhesions, and tyrosine phosphorylation of focal adhesion proteins and has been implicated in gene expression, cell migration, proliferation, and transformation (30Rozengurt E.

Interestingly, a number of recent studies have suggested a convergence between Rho- and PKC-mediated signaling in yeast and mammalian cells (33Kamada Y. Qadota H. Python C.P. Anraku Y. Ohya Y.

Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 4437-4445Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar) have demonstrated that Rho-GTP potently stimulates PKCα activity in vitro using recombinant proteins and Sagi et al. (38Sagi S.A. Seasholtz T.M. Kobiashvili M. Wilson B.A. Toksoz D. Brown J.H. J. Biol.

Recently, we demonstrated that in addition to Gαq, Rho- and Gα13-mediated signaling can promote PKD activation in intact cells and that endogenous Rho and Gα13 contribute to PKD activation in response to bombesin GPCR stimulation (39Yuan J. Slice L.W. Rozengurt E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 38619-38627Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Thus, our results identified PKD as a novel downstream target in Gα13 and Rho signaling and indicated that GPCR stimulation promotes PKD activation via both Gq- and Gα13/Rho-dependent pathways. Lysophosphatidic acid (LPA), a major bioactive lipid of serum (40Eichholtz T. Jalink K. Fahrenfort I. Moolenaar W.H. Biochem. J. 1993; 291: 677-680Crossref PubMed Scopus (577) Google Scholar), elicits a plethora of biological responses by activation of its specific GPCRs (41Moolenaar W.H. J. Biol.

Thus far, three genes (lp A1, lp A2, andlp A3) encoding LPA receptors, LPA1/EDG-2, LPA2/EDG-4, and LPA3/EDG-7, have been identified in mammals (43Contos J.J.A. Ishii I. Chun J. Mol.

All LPA receptors are coupled to Gi and Gq and, at least LPA1 and LPA2 are also coupled to G12 (42Moolenaar W.H. Kranenburg O. Postma F.R. Zondag G.C. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 168-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (474) Google Scholar, 45Yang A.H. Ishii I. Chun J. Biochim. Biophys.

FASEB J. 1998; 12: 1589-1598Crossref PubMed Scopus (490) Google Scholar). LPA stimulates PLC-mediated generation of inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate and diacylglycerol, leading to Ca2+ mobilization from intracellular stores and PKC activation, respectively. These PLC-dependent responses are mediated by the α subunit of Gq and/or the βγ subunits of the PTx-sensitive Gi (52Exton J.H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 243: 10-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). LPA also promotes PTx-insensitive stress fiber formation, assembly of focal adhesions, and tyrosine phosphorylation of focal adhesion proteins (53Seufferlein T. Rozengurt E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 9345-9351Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) via activation of Gα13 and Rho (24Needham L.K. Rozengurt E. J. Biol.

Chem. 1998; 273: 4653-4659Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar). Because LPA receptors are expressed in most cell types, this bioactive lipid is a prototype agonist that promotes the activation of multiple endogenous G protein pathways that are responsible for transducing LPA signals into a broad spectrum of biological responses (43Contos J.J.A. Ishii I. Chun J. Mol. Pharmacol. 2000; 58: 1188-1196Crossref PubMed Scopus (369) Google Scholar, 45Yang A.H. Ishii I. Chun J. Biochim. Biophys.

LPA has also been shown to induce a rapid PKC-dependent PKD activation in intact Swiss 3T3, Rat-1, and IEC-6 cells (56Paolucci L. Sinnett-Smith J. Rozengurt E. Am. J. Physiol. 2000; 278: C33-C39Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 57Chiu T. Rozengurt E. Am. J. Physiol. 2001; 280: C929-C942Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Interestingly, treatment of these cells with PTx markedly attenuated PKD activation in response to LPA. These results identified the involvement of an additional Gi-dependent pathway leading to PKD activation and indicated that the endogenous Gq pathway is not sufficient to promote PKD activation in response to LPA. Because our previous studies demonstrated that PKD can be activated through Gq- and G12-dependent pathways (see above) and because LPA receptors are also coupled to Gq and G12, we hypothesized that LPA induces PKD through multiple G protein signal transduction pathways. Here, we tested this hypothesis using mouse embryonic cell lines deficient in Gαq/11(Gαq/11 KO cells) or Gα12/13(Gα12/13 KO cells), and used a cell line lacking rhodopsin kinase (RK cells), as a control. Based on our results, we conclude that LPA induces PKD activation through the cooperation of Gq with either Gi or G12 and that PKD activation is a point of convergence in the action of multiple G protein pathways. Mouse embryonic fibroblasts were generated from genetically engineered mice (58Xu J. Dodd R.L. Makino C.L. Simon M.I. Baylor D.A. Chen J.

Stock cultures of these cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and 250 μg/ml G418 in a humidified atmosphere containing 10% CO2and 90% air at 37 °C. For experimental purposes, cells were plated in 60- or 100-mm dishes at about 30% confluency in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum and 250 μg/ml G418 and were allowed to grow to near confluency (6–7 days) and then changed to serum-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium for 8–24 h prior to the experiment. To transfect the cells, RK cells and Gαq/11 KO cells were subcultured to 80–90% confluency in 10-cm dishes. All transfections and cotransfections were carried out with equivalent amounts of DNA (20 μg/dish). Transfections were carried out in Opti-MEM using LipofectAMINE 2000 reagent according to the protocol from the manufacturer (Invitrogen). Cells were used for experiments 48–72 h after of transfection. Chimeric fusion proteins between GFP and PKD (GFP-PKD) have been described previously (69Matthews S. Iglesias T. Cantrell D.

Cultures of RK, Gαq/11, and Gα12/13 cells, treated as described in the individual experiments, were washed and lysed in lysis buffer (50 mmTris/HCl, pH 7.6, 2 mm EGTA, 2 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 mm 4-(2-aminoethyl)-benzenesulfonyl fluoride hydrochloride, and 1% Triton X-100). Cell lysates were clarified by centrifugation at 15,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. PKD was immunoprecipitated at 4 °C for 2–4 h with the PA-1 antiserum (1:100) or with GFP antibody for GFP-PKD transfected cell lysates, as previously described (9Zugaza J.L. Sinnett-Smith J.

PKD autophosphorylation was determined in an in vitro kinase assay by mixing 20 μl of PKD immunocomplexes with 10 μl of a phosphorylation mixture containing (final concentration) 100 μm [γ-32P]ATP (specific activity 400–600 cpm/pmol), 30 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.4, 10 mm MgCl2, and 1 mmdithiothreitol. After 10 min of incubation at 30 °C, the reaction was stopped by washing with 1 ml of kinase buffer and then adding an equal volume of 2× SDS-PAGE sample buffer (200 mmTris/HCl, pH 6.8, 2 mm EDTA, 0.1 mNa3VO4, 6% SDS, 10% glycerol, and 4% 2-mercaptoethanol), followed by SDS-PAGE analysis (9Zugaza J.L. Sinnett-Smith J. Van Lint J. Rozengurt E. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6220-6230Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar, 60Van Lint J.V. Sinnett-Smith J. Rozengurt E. J. Biol.

The gels were dried and the 110- or 140-kDa radioactive band corresponding to autophosphorylated PKD or GFP-PKD was visualized by autoradiography. Autoradiographs were scanned in a GS-710 Calibrated Imaging Densitometer (Bio-Rad), and the labeled band was quantified using the Quantity OneTM software program. Exogenous substrate phosphorylation by immunoprecipitated PKD was carried out by mixing 20 μl of the washed immunocomplexes with 20 μl of a phosphorylation mixture containing 2.5 mg/ml syntide-2 (PLARTLSVAGLPGKK), a peptide based on phosphorylation site two of glycogen synthase. After 10 min of incubation at 30 °C, the reaction was stopped by adding 100 μl of 75 mmH3PO4, and 75 μl of the supernatant was spotted on P-81 phosphocellulose paper. Free [γ-32P]ATP was separated from the labeled substrate by washing the P-81 paper four times for 5 min, in 75 mm H3PO4. The papers were dried, and the radioactivity incorporated into syntide-2 was determined by Cerenkov counting. Samples of cell lysates were directly solubilized by boiling in 2× SDS-PAGE sample buffer. Following SDS-PAGE on 8% gels, proteins were transferred to Immobilon-P membranes (Millipore) and blocked by 3–6 h incubation with 5% nonfat milk in phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.2. Membranes were then incubated 3 h with the respective antibodies. PKD phosphorylation was determined by incubating the membrane with an antibody that specifically recognizes the phosphorylated state of serine 744 and serine 748 of PKD at a dilution of 1:1000 in phosphate-buffered saline, 0.1% Tween 20 containing 5% bovine serum albumin. Activation of ERK-2 and ERK-1 occurs through phosphorylation of specific threonine and tyrosine residues, resulting in slower migrating forms in SDS-PAGE gels. These activated forms were monitored by using a specific antiphospho-ERK-1/ERK-2 monoclonal antibody that recognizes the phosphorylated state of Thr-202 and Tyr-204 of ERL-1/2 at a dilution of 1:1000 in phosphate-buffered saline, 0.1% Tween 20 containing 5% nonfat dried milk. The same membranes were stripped and probed in a similar fashion with goat anti-ERK-2 polyclonal antibody. Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG antibody (1:5000,Amersham Biosciences) was then applied for 1 h at room temperature after washing 3 times with phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.05% Tween. Immunoreactive bands were detected by enhanced chemiluminescence Western blotting ECLTM reagents. [γ-32P]ATP (370 MBq/ml), horseradish peroxidase-conjugated donkey anti-rabbit IgG, and enhanced chemiluminescence reagents were from Amersham Biosciences. Protein-A agarose and 4-(2-aminoethyl)-benzenesulfonyl fluoride hydrochloride were from Roche Molecular Biochemicals. LPA, PDB, GF 109203X, GF V, U-0126, PD 098059, and Clostridium difficile toxin B were obtained from Sigma. Ro 31-8220, U73122, and PTx were purchased fromCalbiochem (La Jolla, CA). Opti-MEM and LipofectAMINE 2000 reagent were from Invitrogen. PA-1 antiserum was raised against the synthetic peptide EEREMKALSERVSIL that corresponds to the carboxyl-terminal region of the predicted amino acid sequence of PKD, as previously described (9Zugaza J.L.

Anti-phospho-ERK-1/2 monoclonal antibody was obtained from New England Biolabs. Anti-Gαq/11, anti-Gα12/13, anti-GFP, and anti-ERK-2 polyclonal antibodies were from Santa Cruz Biotechnologies (Palo Alto, CA). Other items were from standard suppliers or as specifically indicated. To examine the contribution of different G protein pathways to LPA-induced PKD activation, we decided to test the effect of this agonist on PKD activity isolated from murine embryonic cell lines lacking RK, Gαq/11, and Gα12/13. Initially, we determined whether LPA induces PKD activation in RK cells, used as controls. Cultures of these cells were stimulated with increasing concentrations of LPA (0.01–10 μm) for 10 min and lysed. PKD was immunoprecipitated from the extracts of these cells and the immune complexes were incubated with [γ-32P]ATP, subjected to SDS-PAGE, and analyzed by autoradiography to detect the prominent 110-kDa band corresponding to autophosphorylated PKD. The results presented in Fig. 1 A show that LPA induced a marked increase in PKD autophosphorylation activity in a concentration-dependent fashion in RK cells. Half-maximal and maximal stimulation (6-fold increase) were achieved at 0.07 and 3 μm, respectively. As illustrated in the insetto Fig. 1, similar results were obtained when PKD activity in immunocomplexes was determined by phosphorylation of syntide-2 (61Mochizuki H. Ito T. Hidaka H. J. Biol.

https://openalex.org/W2023278771,"Plant mutants with defects in intermediate enzymes of the tryptophan biosynthetic pathway often display a blue fluorescent phenotype. This phenotype results from the accumulation of the fluorescent tryptophan precursor anthranilate, the bulk of which is found in a glucose-conjugated form. To elucidate factors that control fluorescent tryptophan metabolites, we conducted a genetic screen for suppressors of blue fluorescence in the Arabidopsis trp1–100 mutant, which has a defect in the second enzymatic step of the tryptophan pathway. This screen yielded loss-of-function mutations in the UDP-glucosyltransferase gene UGT74F2. The bacterially expressed UGT74F2 enzyme catalyzed a conjugation reaction, with free anthranilate and UDP-glucose as substrates, that yielded the same fluorescent glucose ester compound as extracted from thetrp1–100 mutant. These results indicate that sugar conjugation of anthranilate by UGT74F2 allows its stable accumulation in plant tissues. A highly related Arabidopsis enzyme UGT74F1 could also catalyze this reaction in vitro and could complement the ugt74F2 mutation when overexpressedin vivo. However, the UGT74F1 gene is expressed at a lower level than the UGT74F2 gene. Therefore, even though UGT74F1 and UGT74F2 have redundant conjugating activities toward anthranilate, UGT74F2 is the major source of this activity in the plant.

The Arabidopsis genome encodes over 100 predicted UDP-glucosyltransferase (UGT) 1The abbreviations used are: UGT, UDP-glucosyltransferase; IAA, indole-3-acetic acid; Col, Columbia; WS, Wassilewskija; EST, expressed sequence tag; RT, reverse transcriptase; TUB, β-tubulin-4; GST, glutathione S-transferase; HPLC, high-performance liquid chromatography; ORF, open reading frame; SA, salicylic acid; ABA, abscisic acid genes (1Li Y. Baldauf S. Lim E.K. Bowles D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 4338-4343Google Scholar). These genes are identified by a conserved amino acid motif in the carboxyl-terminal region of the protein sequence that binds the common UDP-glucose substrate molecule. UGT enzymes can form either glucose esters or glucosides with a wide range of substrate molecules. These enzymes serve a variety of important biological functions, including converting metabolically active molecules into inactive storage/transport forms or in some cases generating intermediates for the subsequent conversion into other metabolites. To understand the substrate specificity of the Arabidopsis UGTs, ninety of these enzymes have been expressed in bacteria and are being systematically tested for activity against a battery of potential substrate compounds. This strategy has identified specificArabidopsis UGTs that can use the plant growth regulator indole-3-acetic acid (IAA) (2Jackson R.G. Lim E.K. Li Y. Kowalczyk M. Sandberg G. Hoggett J. Ashford D.A. Bowles D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 4350-4356Google Scholar), various phenylpropanoid compounds (3Lim E.K. Li Y. Parr A. Jackson R. Ashford D.A. Bowles D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 4344-4349Google Scholar), and various hydroxybenzoic acid compounds (4Lim E.K. Doucet C.J. Li Y. Elias L. Worrall D. Spencer S.P. Ross J. Bowles D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 586-592Google Scholar) as substrates in vitro. However, understanding the roles of specific UGTs in the plant is only in its early stages. The previous in vitro screening strategy identified the UGT74F1 and UGT74F2 enzymes as being able to use benzoic acid, 2-hydroxybenzoic acid (salicylic acid), and 3-hydroxybenzoic acid as substrates for glucose conjugation (4Lim E.K. Doucet C.J. Li Y. Elias L. Worrall D. Spencer S.P. Ross J. Bowles D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 586-592Google Scholar). Here we report that UGT74F1 and UGT74F2 can also use the tryptophan precursor compound 2-aminobenzoic acid (anthranilate) as a substrate for glucose ester conjugation bothin vitro and in vivo. This finding has important implications for understanding the flux of metabolites in the tryptophan pathway. The tryptophan pathway is of particular interest in plants, because it provides critical secondary metabolites, including the growth regulator IAA and indole glucosinolate defense compounds (5Radwanski E.R. Last R.L. Plant Cell. 1995; 7: 921-934Google Scholar). Studies of this pathway have been greatly facilitated by the isolation of mutants with defects in tryptophan biosynthetic enzyme structural genes. A striking feature of some tryptophan mutants is a blue fluorescent phenotype under ultraviolet (UV) light, caused by accumulation of the first intermediate compound in the pathway, anthranilate (see Fig. 1). For example, the Arabidopsis mutant trp1–1, which has a defect in the second enzyme of the pathway, is strongly fluorescent throughout the plant (6Last R.L. Fink G.R. Science. 1988; 240: 305-310Google Scholar). Biochemical analysis showed that the major fluorescent compound present in this mutant is an anthranilate-glucose conjugate. Blue fluorescence due to tryptophan pathway mutations is a valuable reporter phenotype for probing tryptophan metabolism (7Niyogi K.K. Last R.L. Fink G.R. Keith B. Plant Cell. 1993; 5: 1011-1027Google Scholar, 8Bender J. Fink G.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 5655-5660Google Scholar, 9Smolen G. Bender J. Genetics. 2002; 160: 323-332Google Scholar). This reporter phenotype has also been exploited to study factors that regulate cytosine methylation and gene silencing in plants (10Jeddeloh J.A. Bender J. Richards E.J. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 1714-1725Google Scholar, 11Bartee L. Bender J. Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: 2127-2134Google Scholar, 12Bartee L. Malagnac F. Bender J. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 1753-1758Google Scholar, 13Malagnac F. Bartee L. Bender J. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 6842-6852Google Scholar). For example, a blue fluorescence Arabidopsis mutation, the weak trp1–100 allele in the gene encoding the second enzyme of the pathway (14Rose A.B. Casselman A.L. Last R.L. Plant Physiol. 1992; 100: 582-592Google Scholar, 15Rose A.B. Li J. Last R.L. Genetics. 1997; 145: 197-205Google Scholar), was used to identify second site mutations that block the production of fluorescent compounds (7Niyogi K.K. Last R.L. Fink G.R. Keith B. Plant Cell. 1993; 5: 1011-1027Google Scholar). In this work, the goal was to recover mutations that impair the synthesis of anthranilate. The suppressor mutations were therefore characterized for whether they conferred tryptophan auxotrophy. This screen yielded twotrp4 loss-of-function alleles in the anthranilate synthase β subunit-encoding gene ASB1 (Fig.1). Several other suppressor mutations were isolated in this screen, but because they were not tryptophan auxotrophs they were not studied further. To better understand the homeostasis of fluorescent metabolites in tryptophan mutants, we extended the previous trp1–100fluorescence suppressor analysis with a focus on non-auxotrophic isolates. This study yielded a single major complementation group of suppressor mutations with loss-of-function defects in UGT74F2, which catalyzes glucose conjugation to anthranilate through an ester linkage. Our findings provide new insights into specificity and function for the large and important plant UGT enzyme family. The Columbia (Col) trp1–100 gl1–1 strain was mutagenized by ethyl methane sulfonate as previously described (7Niyogi K.K. Last R.L. Fink G.R. Keith B. Plant Cell. 1993; 5: 1011-1027Google Scholar). Seedlings were screened for fluorescence by plating on plant nutrient plus 0.5% sucrose (PNS) agar medium (16Haughn G.W. Somerville C. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1986; 204: 430-434Google Scholar) and inspecting under short-wave UV light from a hand-held source at 2 weeks. This screen yielded the six alleles P155S, E206K, T341I, G344D, W364*, and W421*. The ugt74F2 alleles obtained from a previous screen were isolated by similar methods except that the agar medium contained supplements of tryptophan, phenylalanine, tyrosine, and para-aminobenzoic acid to aid the growth of aromatic amino acid auxotropic seedlings (7Niyogi K.K. Last R.L. Fink G.R. Keith B. Plant Cell. 1993; 5: 1011-1027Google Scholar). This screen yielded the four alleles G64D, Q153*, i1a, and Q327*. All the trp1–100 ugt74F2 alleles were back-crossed at least one time totrp1–100 prior to subsequent analysis. The Wassilewskija (WS) pat1E151K mutant was isolated in a previously described screen for fluorescent mutants in the WS background (11Bartee L. Bender J. Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: 2127-2134Google Scholar). The mutation was found to be allelic with trp1–100 in complementation crosses. The PAT1 gene was PCR-amplified and sequenced from the mutant to determine the nature of the mutation. The wild type WSPAT1 gene was also sequenced to determine Colversus WS polymorphisms in the gene, and the sequence is available as GenBankTMAF498914. The splice junction alleleugt74F2i1a was used for positional cloning of the locus. The Col trp1–100 gl1–1 ugt74F2 strain was crossed to WSpat1E151K, and F2 progeny of the cross were scored for non-fluorescence, diagnostic of ugt74F2 homozygosity. A population of non-fluorescent F2 plants was used for mapping with standard cleaved amplified polymorphic sequence (17Konieczny A. Ausubel F.M. Plant J. 1993; 4: 403-410Google Scholar) and single sequence length polymorphism (18Bell C.J. Ecker J.R. Genomics. 1994; 19: 137-144Google Scholar) markers that are polymorphic between the Col and WS strain backgrounds. This analysis showed linkage to the m429 cleaved amplified polymorphic sequence marker on the lower arm of chromosome 2. Additional Col versus WS polymorphic markers in the region were developed based on known polymorphisms between Col and the Landsberg erecta strain. Fine-structure mapping with these markers on a population of 710 plants from the mapping cross narrowed down the mutant locus to the region between the markers 56IN-F18O19 and 28IN-F4I1. The 56IN-F18O19 marker used primers 56IN-F18O19F 5′-GATCAATGATTGATTGAGTGG-3′ and 56IN-F18O19R 5′-TCTTGCATTTCCTCCTTGGTG-3′; these primers amplify a 226-bp fragment in Col versus a 170-bp fragment in WS. The 28IN-F4I1 marker used primers 28IN-F4I1F 5′-TATGAATTCGAGTGTGTTTGCG-3′ and 28IN-F4I1R 5′-GACATGATTGTCTTCCAAATG-3′; these primers amplify a 209-bp fragment in Col versus a 181-bp fragment in WS. No recombination breakpoints were detected at a central marker 29IN-F16E13. The 29IN-F16E13 marker used primers 29IN-F16E13F 5′-TCTAATTGTGGTTGGTAAATC-3′ and 29IN-F16E13R 5′-GTAGTTAGACAACATGAGTTAC-3′; these primers amplify a 224-bp fragment in Col versus a 195-bp fragment in WS. Mutant alleles were amplified by PCR and cloned into the pGEM-T Easy vector (Promega) for sequencing. Two independent PCR products were sequenced for each allele to control for PCR-induced mutations. Neither the trp1–100 nor theugt74F2 splice junction mutation changes a restriction enzyme recognition site. However, we were able to convert these base changes into restriction site changes by combining them with nearby mismatches in PCR primers, which result in PCR amplification of novel DNA species (19Neff M.M. Neff J.D. Chory J. Pepper A.E. Plant J. 1998; 14: 387-392Google Scholar). For the trp1–100 mutation, we used primers TRP1100F 5′-GCTAAATGATCTTCGTCTGG-3′, and TRP1100R 5′-CCACTCCTAGTGCCTCTAGTACATCAGAG-3′, where the underlined base is mismatched with the genomic sequence. This primer set amplifies a 114-bp fragment. For TRP1 template DNA, the fragment cleaves with HaeII into 84- and 30-bp products, whereas fortrp1–100 template DNA the fragment does not cleave withHaeII. For the ugt74F2 splice mutation, we used primers BKD4F 5′-CATGTACTAACTGCTCTTTTTTTGTTTACC-3′, and BK-D4R 5′-GGTCTAAGTAAATTGATGG-3′, where the underlined base is mismatched with the genomic sequence. The primer set amplifies a 104-bp fragment. For UGT74F2 template DNA, the fragment cleaves with MspI into 74- and 30-bp products, whereas forugt74F2 splice mutant template DNA the fragment does not cleave with MspI. An Agrobacterium tumefaciens-mediated in planta transformation method was used to introduce transgene constructs into Arabidopsis(20Clough S.J. Bent A.F. Plant J. 1998; 16: 735-743Google Scholar). The Col trp1–100 gl1–1 ugt74F2 splice junction mutation strain was used for transgene complementation experiments. This strain was transformed with four constructs: a UGT74F2genomic clone, a UGT74F1 genomic clone, theUGT74F2 cDNA driven by the 35S promoter, and theUGT74F1 cDNA driven by the 35S promoter. Genomic sequences of both UGT74F2 and UGT74F1 were obtained by hybridization screening of a Col genomic plaque library (8Bender J. Fink G.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 5655-5660Google Scholar). The UGT74F2 genomic clone consisted of anEcoRV fragment extending from 2.3 kb upstream of the translational start codon to 0.5 kb downstream of the translational stop codon inserted in the filled-in KpnI site of the pBIN19 plant transformation vector (21Bevan M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1984; 12: 8711-8721Google Scholar). The UGT74F1 genomic clone consisted of an XbaI fragment extending from 1.8 kb upstream of the translational start codon to 2.4 kb downstream of the translational stop codon inserted into the XbaI site of pBIN19. The full-length UGT74F2 cDNA was obtained as an EST isolate 127P19T7 from the Arabidopsis Biological Resource Center. This cDNA was cloned in the sense orientation as a blunt-ended fragment into the SmaI site of the 35S expression vector pBICaMV (22Hull A.K. Vij R. Celenza J.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 2379-2384Google Scholar). The full-length UGT74F1cDNA was obtained by RT-PCR, and cloned as an EcoRI fragment into the EcoRI site of pBICaMV. For theUGT74F2 genomic transgene, all of 44 transformants were fluorescent. For the UGT74F1 genomic clone, all of 40 transformants were non-fluorescent. For the 35S-UGT74F2cDNA construct, 23 out of 31 transformants were fluorescent. For the 35S-UGT74F1 cDNA construct, 11 out of 38 transformants were fluorescent. We suspect that the non-fluorescent 35S-UGT74F2 and 35S-UGT74F1 isolates did not express the transgene sequences due to transgene silencing. Southern blot analysis of the 35S-UGT74F2 cDNA transgenic lines revealed that the non-complementing lines contained high copy numbers of the transgene, consistent with this hypothesis. Plant RNA extractions, formaldehyde gel electrophoresis, transfer to nylon membranes, and hybridization with radiolabeled probes were performed as previously described (23Melquist S. Luff B. Bender J. Genetics. 1999; 153: 401-413Google Scholar). Probes were cDNA fragments from the indicated genes. TheUGT74F2 (At2g43820) probe was an internal NcoI fragment. The UGT74F1 (At2g43840) probe was an internalEcoRV fragment. Neither of these probes significantly cross-hybridized to the related gene, as determined by high stringency Southern blot analysis. The β-tubulin-4 (TUB) full-length cDNA (At5g44340) probe was used as a control for loading differences. RNA blot results were reproduced in two or three independent experiments. The UGT74F2 cDNA EST clone was modified by oligonucleotide-directed mutagenesis (24Kunkel T.A. Roberts J.D. Zakour R.A. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 154: 367-382Google Scholar) to create an NdeI site at the start codon of the gene. The cDNA was then subcloned as an NdeI to BamHI fragment into the corresponding sites in the pGEX* vector (25Haldeman M.T. Xia G. Kasperek E.M. Pickart C.M. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 10526-10537Google Scholar) to make an amino-terminal GST fusion of the protein expressed from the lac promoter. An analogous GST fusion construct was made for the UGT74F1 cDNA by similar methods. All constructs were verified by DNA sequencing. The constructs were transformed into the BL21(DE3) bacterial strain harboring a helper plasmid, JY2, that encodes both the AGA-specific argU tRNA and T7 lysozyme (26You J. Cohen R.E. Pickart C.M. BioTechniques. 1999; 27: 950-954Google Scholar) for protein expression. Expression was induced by the addition of 0.4 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside to mid-logarithmic cultures of each strain grown in 2XYT broth (16 g of tryptone, 10 g of yeast extract, 5 g of sodium chloride per liter of water) at 17 °C. Cells were harvested after 16 h of induction. GST fusion proteins were purified from cell lysates using glutathione-coupled Sepharose gel according to the manufacturer's instructions (Amersham Biosciences) and assessed by Coomassie Blue gel analysis. Enzyme activity assays were performed with 1 μg of purified protein, 2 mm of anthranilate (Sigma A1506), 14 mm 2-mercaptoethanol (Sigma M6250), and 5 mmUDP-glucose (Sigma U4625) in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.0, buffer. Reactions were incubated for 30 min at 30 °C before stopping by addition of 20 μl 240 mg/ml trichloroacetic acid. Reaction products were analyzed by TLC analysis using Silica Gel 60 TLC plates (VWR EM5721-7) using a 55:25:20 ethyl acetate:chloroform:formic acid mixture as mobile phase. Plant extracts for TLC analysis of fluorescent compounds were prepared as previously described (6Last R.L. Fink G.R. Science. 1988; 240: 305-310Google Scholar). For mass spectrometry, fluorescent spots were scraped off of TLC plates, extracted with ethyl acetate, passed over a ZipTip C4 desalting system (Millipore Corp.) according to manufacturer's instructions, and dried down. Electrospray ionization-mass spectrometry was performed at The Scripps Center for Mass Spectrometry facility. For analysis of conjugate linkages, conjugates were purified from TLC plates as described above. Conjugate treatments were as follows: TLC-purified fluorescent conjugate compounds were resuspended in water and incubated either in 10 mm Tris, pH 6.8, at 37 °C for 5 min (mock treatment), in 0.1 n sodium hydroxide for 1 h at 25 °C before neutralization with 3 m sodium acetate, pH 5.2 (NaOH treatment), with 2.5 units of β-glucosidase in 50 mm sodium citrate, pH 5.0, at 37 °C for 5 min (β-glucosidase treatment), or with 2.5 units of α-glucosidase in 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, at 37 °C for 5 min (α-glucosidase treatment). Commercially available β-glucosidase (Sigma G4511) and α-glucosidase (Sigma G3651) were used to test the nature of the linkage of the anthranilate glucose conjugate. For the evaluation of Michaelis-Menten kinetic parameters, enzyme assays were performed as described above using a range of anthranilate concentrations from 0 to 3 mm. Consistent with previous reports (4Lim E.K. Doucet C.J. Li Y. Elias L. Worrall D. Spencer S.P. Ross J. Bowles D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 586-592Google Scholar) we found that both enzymes, UGT74F1 and UGT74F2, sustained linear activity at 20 °C for at least 60 min; therefore, we conducted our kinetics analysis at this temperature. Reactions were stopped as described above, quick-frozen, and stored until further analysis. The reverse-phase HPLC analysis of enzyme reactions was performed using a Varian ProStar HPLC system. Resolution of free and conjugated anthranilate was achieved over a LUNA 5-μm C18 column (150 × 4.6 mm, Phenomenex) using a linear gradient (10–65% over 20 min) of acetonitrile in water (0.1% trifluoroacetic acid) at a rate of 1 ml/min. Absorbance was monitored at 320 nm. The retention times under our HPLC conditions were 5.4 and 7.6 min for the conjugated and free anthranilate forms, respectively. The specific activity for each enzyme was expressed as nanomoles of anthranilate glucosylated per second (nanokatals) by 1 mg of recombinant protein at 30 min of reaction time at 20 °C with 1 mm anthranilate and 5 mm UDP-glucose. The Michaelis-Menten kinetics parameters,K m andk cat/K m were derived from Lineweaver-Burk plots. To estimate the upper limit ofK m for the UGT74F2 enzyme, we assumed that the rate was 85% of V max at the lowest substrate concentration assayed (based on 15% error on individual measurements) and calculated K m accordingly. The ugt74F2mutations described here were isolated by screening ethyl methane sulfonate-mutagenized Col trp1–100 seedlings for loss of cotyledon fluorescence (see “Experimental Procedures”). Thetrp1–100 mutation is caused by a serine to asparagine mutation at codon 224 of the PAT1 gene, which encodesphosphoribosylanthranilatetransferase (15Rose A.B. Li J. Last R.L. Genetics. 1997; 145: 197-205Google Scholar). This defect confers strong fluorescence in cotyledons and weaker fluorescence in adult plant tissues without any additional morphological or fertility defects (14Rose A.B. Casselman A.L. Last R.L. Plant Physiol. 1992; 100: 582-592Google Scholar). Thetrp1–100 fluorescence phenotype is caused by accumulation of glucose-conjugated anthranilate (6Last R.L. Fink G.R. Science. 1988; 240: 305-310Google Scholar). The suppressor screen yielded six independent trp1–100 ugt74F2 mutant isolates that were non-fluorescent both in seedling tissues (Fig. 2) and in adult rosette leaves but displayed weak residual fluorescence in silique tissue (data not shown). The residual silique fluorescence is likely to be due to the activity of an UGT74F2-related gene product UGT74F1 (see Fig. 7results below). The ugt74F2 suppressor mutations in thetrp1–100 background were found to be recessive when back-crossed to the trp1–100 parental strain, yielding fluorescent F1 heterozygous plants and segregating ∼25% non-fluorescent seedlings in the F2 generation. The suppressor mutations comprised a single complementation group: pairwise crosses between mutant candidates yielded non-fluorescent F1 heterozygous seedlings. The trp1–100 ugt74F2 double mutants had no obvious morphological phenotypes.Figure 7UGT74F2 and UGT74F1 can catalyze a conjugation reaction utilizing UDP-glucose and anthranilate as substrates to form a glucose ester compound. A, a Coomassie Blue-stained gel of preparations of the indicated GST fusion proteins used in enzyme assays is shown. Approximately 0.5 μg of each recombinant protein was loaded in each lane. B, a TLC assay for resolution of free anthranilate from conjugated anthranilate is shown. The TLC plate was photographed under long wave UV light to visualize the fluorescent compounds. Plant extracts were prepared from seedlings at 10 days post-germination as previously described (6Last R.L. Fink G.R. Science. 1988; 240: 305-310Google Scholar). Enzyme assays were performed as described under “Experimental Procedures.” O indicates the origin, and Findicates the solvent front. C, the fluorescent conjugate compounds from the in vitro UGT74F2-catalyzed reaction, or from the in vitro UGT74F1-catalyzed reaction, were purified by isolation from TLC plates and subjected to the indicated treatments, and the reaction products were resolved by TLC to determine whether the conjugate was cleaved or uncleaved. See “Experimental Procedures” for conjugate treatment details.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) We also received a set of non-auxotrophic suppressors oftrp1–100 fluorescence that were recovered in the previous screen that yielded the trp4 mutations (7Niyogi K.K. Last R.L. Fink G.R. Keith B. Plant Cell. 1993; 5: 1011-1027Google Scholar). These previously isolated mutants included an additional four alleles ofugt74F2, as determined by complementation crosses. One of these alleles displayed only a partial suppression of fluorescence in seedling and leaf tissues. To understand the molecular nature of the trp1–100 suppressor mutants, we cloned the ugt74F2 suppressor locus by positional methods. For this analysis, we took advantage of a fluorescenttrp1–100-like mutant that was isolated in the polymorphic strain background WS. The WS mutant carries a glutamic acid to lysine missense mutation of codon 151 of the PAT1 gene (WSpat1E151K). Similarly to trp1–100 mutation in the Col PAT1 gene, the WS pat1E151K allele conferred fluorescence without additional morphological defects. For mapping, a representative Col ugt74F2 trp1–100(pat1S224N) double-mutant isolate was crossed to the WSpat1E151K mutant, and F2 progeny seedlings were examined for the suppressed non-fluorescent phenotype diagnostic of the homozygousugt74F2 suppressor mutation. Approximately 25% of the F2 progeny of the mapping cross were non-fluorescent, showing that theugt74F2 defect can suppress both pat1 mutations segregating in the cross. Standard mapping analysis on a population of suppressed non-fluorescent F2 plants from the mapping cross revealed linkage to a locus on the lower arm of chromosome 2. Fine-structure mapping of this region on a population of 710 plants (1420 chromosomes) narrowed down the mutant locus to an interval containing ∼70 predicted open reading frames (ORFs) (Fig. 3). Within this interval, we focused on two ORFs encoding glucosyltransferases, UGT74F1 and UGT74F2 (1Li Y. Baldauf S. Lim E.K. Bowles D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 4338-4343Google Scholar), as candidate genes where loss-of-function mutations could block the accumulation of fluorescent glucose-conjugated anthranilate (Fig. 1). Although the UGT74F1 and UGT74F2 genes encode similar predicted protein products (Fig.4), we identified UGT74F2 as the more likely candidate, because this gene is represented by cDNAs in the Arabidopsis expressed sequence tag (EST) collection, whereas the UGT74F1 gene is not. We showed that the UGT74F2 gene is in fact the mutant locus with two approaches. First, we cloned and sequenced this gene from the ten mutant isolates, and found a coding sequence G:C to A:T transition mutation in each case. Four of the alleles created premature stop codons, one allele created a splice junction mutation at the acceptor site of the single intron in the gene, and five alleles created missense mutations (Fig. 4). Of the five missense mutations, two affected highly conserved residues in the sugar binding region of the protein sequence. The weak allele that only partially suppressedtrp1–100 fluorescence was a missense mutation G64D. To understand the effects of the splice mutation, ugt74F2i1a(intron 1 acceptor), we used reverse transcriptase PCR (RT-PCR) to amplify the UGT74F2 transcript from this mutant. Sequencing of the product revealed that the intron missplices to a new acceptor site just 1 bp downstream of the normal site to yield a product with an incorrect downstream reading frame, causing premature translation termination at codon 220. We also sequenced the neighboringUGT74F1 gene from the ugt74F2i1a splice junction mutant and found that this related gene contained no mutations. Thus, the mutant phenotype was not caused by a combination of lesions in both predicted glucosyltransferase genes. Second, we found that the cloned UGT74F2 gene introduced on a transgene could complement the ugt74F2 trp1–100 double mutant to restore seedling fluorescence (Fig.5). Fluorescence was complemented by either a genomic clone carrying UGT74F2 but no other complete ORFs or a cDNA of UGT74F2 driven from the strong constitutive Cauliflower Mosaic Virus 35S promoter (35S-UGT74F2 cDNA). Fluorescence was not complemented by a genomic clone of the related UGT74F1, even in transgenic lines that carried multiple copies of the transgene insert. These results indicate that UGT74F2 is the fluorescence suppressor locus. However, fluorescence was complemented by a 35S-UGT74F1 cDNA construct. This result suggests that the UGT74F1 gene product is capable of catalyzing the same reaction as the UGT74F2 gene product when expressed at sufficiently high levels. Using sequence information for the trp1–100 mutation and the ugt74F2 splice junction mutation, we designed PCR-based strategies to follow both of these lesions through genetic crosses (see “Experimental Procedures”). The markers allowed us to identify progeny plants of a cross between wild type Col and the trp1–100 ugt74F2i1a splice mutant strain that had segregated the homozygousugt74F2i1a mutation into an otherwise wild type background. These ugt74F2 mutant plants had no obvious morphological abnormalities. To understand the expression patterns of UGT74F2, we carried out RNA gel blot analysis on tissue-specific RNA samples with a UGT74F2 cDNA probe. The expression analysis revealed that, in wild type Col,UGT74F2 was most strongly expressed in seedling tissues with weaker expression in adult leaves (Fig.6 A). The gene was up-regulated by treatment of seedlings with exogenous salicylic acid (SA) or abscisic acid (ABA) and down-regulated by gibberellic acid (Fig.6 B). Treatment with methyl jasmonate, IAA, a cytokinin (6-benzylaminopurine), or the ethylene precursor 1-aminocyclopropane 1-carboxylic acid had little o"

To discover TNFα-induced factors that regulate GR activity at the coactivator level, we performed yeast two-hybrid screening using the NRB domain of the glucocorticoid receptor-interacting protein 1 (GRIP1) as bait. We found that FLICE-associated huge protein (FLASH), which transduces TNFα and Fas ligand signals, bound the NRB domain of GRIP1 at a region between the second and third LXXLL motifs. FLASH suppressed both GR transactivation and GRIP1 enhancement of the glucocorticoid signal and inhibited the physical interaction between GR and the GRIP1 NRB domain. Transfected green fluorescent protein-fused FLASH was located in both the cytoplasm and nucleus, while endogenous FLASH shifted its subcellular localization from the cytoplasm into the nucleus in response to TNFα. FLASH antisense and super-repressor IκBα inhibited the action of TNFα independently of each other and additively. These findings indicate that FLASH participates in TNFα-induced blockade of GR transactivation at the nuclear receptor coactivator level, upstream and independently of NF-κB.

Schulte H.M. Chrousos G.P. Endocr. Rev. 1996; 17: 245-261Google Scholar, 2Munck A. Guyre P.M. Holbrook N.J. Endocr. Rev. 1984; 5: 25-44Google Scholar). The presence of glucocorticoids is crucial for the integrity of central nervous system function and for maintenance of cardiovascular, metabolic, and immune homeostasis (3Chrousos G.P. N. Engl. J. Med. 1995; 332: 1351-1362Google Scholar). Their actions are mediated by the glucocorticoid receptor (GR),1 which functions as a hormone-activated transcription factor that regulates the expression of glucocorticoid target genes (4Beato M. Sanchez-Pacheco A. Endocr. Rev. 1996; 17: 587-609Google Scholar). The transcriptional activity of the ligand-activated GR is exerted by interaction with molecular components of the transcription machinery. Of particular importance is a family of proteins, the nuclear receptor coactivators, which bridge promoter-bound GR and the transcription initiation complex. Coactivators also possess histone acetyltransferase activity through which they help unwind DNA from nucleosomes, increasing the accessibility of promoter DNA to nuclear receptors, other transcription factors, and components of the transcription machinery (5McKenna N.J. Lanz R.B. O'Malley B.W. Endocr. Rev. 1999; 20: 321-344Google Scholar). p160 type nuclear receptor coactivators play an essential role in GR-induced transcriptional activation (6Leo C. Chen J.D. Gene. 2000; 245: 1-11Google Scholar). These large proteins are mainly localized in the nucleus. The promoter-bound GR helps tethering them to the promoter regions of glucocorticoid-responsive genes. Other coactivators, such as p300 and its homologous protein cAMP-responsive element-binding protein (CREB)-binding protein (CBP), as well as the p300/CBP-associated protein (p/CAF), are then attracted to the promoters forming receptor-coactivator complexes (7Baumann C.T., Ma, H.

There are three subclasses of p160 proteins: steroid receptor coactivator 1 (SRC1); TIF-II or glucocorticoid receptor-interacting polypeptide 1 (GRIP1), also called SRC2; and, p300/CBP/co-integrator-associated protein (p/CIP), also called ACTR, TRAM-1, RAC3, or SRC3 (5McKenna N.J. Lanz R.B. O'Malley B.W. Endocr. Rev. 1999; 20: 321-344Google Scholar, 6Leo C. Chen J.D. Gene. 2000; 245: 1-11Google Scholar). All three exhibit high similarity in the amino acid sequences and contain three copies of the coactivator signature motif sequence LXXLL in their nuclear receptor-binding (NRB) domain at the middle region of the molecule. Through these motifs, p160 coactivators specifically interact with the activation function (AF) 2 surface formed in the ligand-binding domain (LBD) of the GR after ligand activation (12Glass C.K. Rose D.W. Rosenfeld M.G. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 222-232Google Scholar, 13Heery D.M. Kalkhoven E. Hoare S. Parker M.G. Nature. 1997; 387: 733-736Google Scholar). Since glucocorticoids have a broad array of life-sustaining functions and play an important role in the therapy of many human diseases, changes of tissue sensitivity to glucocorticoids may be associated with and influence the natural history of and response to glucocorticoid treatment of many of these states (14Kino T. Chrousos G.P. J. Allergy Clin. Immunol. 2002; 109: 609-613Google Scholar, 15Chrousos G.P. Detera-Wadleigh S.D. Karl M. Ann. Intern. Med. 1993; 119: 1113-1124Google Scholar). Several autoimmune and allergic/inflammatory states, such as rheumatoid arthritis, osteoarthritis, Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis, and asthma, are often associated with resistance of the inflamed tissues to glucocorticoids (14Kino T. Chrousos G.P. J. Allergy Clin. Immunol. 2002; 109: 609-613Google Scholar, 16Kino T. Chrousos G.P. J. Endocrinol. 2001; 169: 437-445Google Scholar, 17Franchimont D. Louis E. Dupont P. Vrindts-Gevaert Y. Dewe W. Chrousos G. Geenen V. Belaiche J. Dig. Dis. Sci. 1999; 44: 1208-1215Google Scholar). In addition, the acute respiratory distress syndrome and septic shock have been associated with systemic glucocorticoid resistance (18Meduri G.U. Tolley E.A. Chrousos G.P. Stentz F. Am. J. Respir. Crit. Care Med. 2002; 165: 983-991Google Scholar). The mechanism(s) underlying such inflammation-related glucocorticoid resistance is not well understood, but several proinflammatory cytokines and their downstream signaling cascades may be involved in the process (1Bamberger C.M. Schulte H.M. Chrousos G.P. Endocr. Rev. 1996; 17: 245-261Google Scholar). Tumor necrosis factor α (TNFα) and its homologues play a central role in the development and maintenance of inflammation in many pathologic inflammatory states (19Santamaria P. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 2001; 13: 663-669Google Scholar, 20O'Shea J.J., Ma, A. Lipsky P. Nature Rev. Immunol. 2002; 2: 37-45Google Scholar). TNFα is produced by variety of immune and immune accessory cells, including monocytes, macrophages, and dendritic cells, and exerts diverse effects on cell growth and differentiation, promotes inflammation, and may cause apoptosis (21Locksley R.M. Killeen N. Lenardo M.J. Cell. 2001; 104: 487-501Google Scholar). TNFα activates nuclear factor κB (NF-κB), a heterodimer transcription factor of the Rel family proteins that plays a major role in inflammation and the immune response. NF-κB is also stimulated by many inflammation-promoting substances, including other proinflammatory cytokines, endotoxins, intracellular proteins liberated from necrotic cells, oxygen radicals, and oxidized molecules (22Rothwarf, D. M., and Karin, M. (1999) Science's STKEhttp://www.stke.org/cgi/content/full/OC_sigtrans;1999Google Scholar). NF-κB antagonizes GR action at several different steps, including direct interaction with it and interference with its transcriptional activity (23McKay L.I. Cidlowski J.A. Endocr. Rev. 1999; 20: 435-459Google Scholar, 24Caldenhoven E. Liden J. Wissink S. Van de Stolpe A. Raaijmakers J. Koenderman L. Okret S. Gustafsson J.A. Van der Saag P.T. Mol. Endocrinol. 1995; 9: 401-412Google Scholar). TNFα interacts with its cell surface receptor (TNF-R) and activates IκB and NF-κB phosphorylation, release of NF-κB from a cytoplasmic IκB-NF-κB complex, and nuclear translocation of NF-κB. In parallel, TNFα activates several other intermediate proteins, such as TNFα receptor-associating factors (TRAF), receptor-interacting protein (RIP), and FLICE-associated huge protein (FLASH) (21Locksley R.M. Killeen N. Lenardo M.J. Cell. 2001; 104: 487-501Google Scholar, 25MacEwan D.J. Cell Signal. 2002; 14: 477-492Google Scholar, 26Choi Y.H. Kim K.B. Kim H.H. Hong G.S. Kwon Y.K. Chung C.W. Park Y.M. Shen Z.J. Kim B.J. Lee S.Y. Jung Y.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 25073-25077Google Scholar). FLASH is a CED4-homologous protein, involved in apoptosis induced by both TNFα and Fas ligand (FasL) (26Choi Y.H. Kim K.B. Kim H.H. Hong G.S. Kwon Y.K. Chung C.W. Park Y.M. Shen Z.J. Kim B.J. Lee S.Y. Jung Y.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 25073-25077Google Scholar, 27Imai Y. Kimura T. Murakami A. Yajima N. Sakamaki K. Yonehara S. Nature. 1999; 398: 777-785Google Scholar). This protein forms the death-inducing signaling complex (DISC) with the cytoplasmic portion of Fas, i.e. the receptor for FasL and caspase-8 in response to FasL. FLASH also participates in the activation of NF-κB through direct interaction with TRAF2. Although FLASH was originally found as a component of a cytoplasmic complex located under the plasma membrane, it contains two putative nuclear localization signals and one nuclear export signal, findings that have led to the speculation that it might translocate into the nucleus in response to certain stimuli (27Imai Y. Kimura T. Murakami A. Yajima N. Sakamaki K. Yonehara S. Nature. 1999; 398: 777-785Google Scholar). To elucidate mechanism(s) that may contribute to glucocorticoid resistance associated with inflammation, we performed yeast two-hybrid screening using the NRB domain of GRIP1 as bait. We found that the C-terminal portion of FLASH specifically interacted with GRIP1 NRB at the region enclosed between the second and the third LXXLL motifs. FLASH inhibited both GR transactivation and its enhancement by GRIP1 on a glucocorticoid-responsive promoter by interfering with GR binding to GRIP1. Incubation of cells with TNFα caused translocation of FLASH into the nucleus, blocking ligand-activated GR interaction with GRIP1 and suppressing transactivation. We suggest that the transcriptional activity of the GR is regulated by TNFα at the level of p160 type coactivators through FLASH, independently of its parallel interaction and interference with transcription factor NF-κB signal transduction pathway. pLexA-GRIP1(596–774)-WT and LXXLLs-Mut were constructed by inserting the corresponding GRIP1 cDNAs, without or with two leucines replaced by alanines in all three LXXLLs, into pLexA (Clontech, Palo Alto, CA). pLexA-GRIP1(600–640), -GRIP1(646–689), -GRIP1(691–743), -GRIP1(747–774), -GRIP1(600–689), -GRIP1(646–743), and -GRIP1(691–774) were constructed by subcloning the corresponding GRIP1 cDNAs into pLexA. pSG5-GRIP1 fl, which expresses murine full-length GRIP1, is a generous gift from Dr. M.

For a yeast two-hybrid assay, yeast strain EGY48 (Clontech) was transformed with thelacZ reporter plasmid p8op-LacZ, indicating pLexA-GRIP1s and pB42AD-FLASH plasmids. The cells were grown in a selective medium to the early stationary phase and permeabilized by CHCl3-SDS treatment, and β-galactosidase activity was measured in the cell suspension using GalactolightTM PLUS (Tropix, Bedford, MA). β-galactosidase activity was normalized for absorbance value at 600 nm. Fold induction was calculated by the ratio of adjusted β-galactosidase values of cells transformed with pLexA-derived bait plasmids versus pLexA in the presence of the same prey plasmid. Human colon carcinoma-derived HCT116 cells, purchased from the American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA), were maintained in MacCoy's 5A medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 50 units of penicillin, and 50 μg/ml streptomycin. The cells were transfected using Lipofectin (Invitrogen) as described previously (31Kino T. Gragerov A. Kopp J.B. Stauber R.H. Pavlakis G.N. Chrousos G.P. J. Exp.

For the experiments using pMMTV-Luc or (IκB)3-Luc as a reporter plasmid, 0.1–2.0 μg/well of FLASH-expressing plasmids, 1.0 μg/well of pCDM-IκBαS32,36A and/or 1.0–2.0 μg/well of pSG5-GRIP1 fl were used with 0.8 μg/well of pMMTV-Luc or 1.5 μg/well of (IκB)3-Luc. 0.1 μg/well of pRShGRα was cotransfected in all experiments since HCT116 cells do not contain functional GR. 0.5 μg/well of pSV40-β-Gal was also included to normalize luciferase activity in all transfections. Empty vectors were used to maintain the same amount of transfected DNA. 10−6m of dexamethasone and/or 30 ng/ml of TNFα were added 24 h after transfection. The cells were harvested after an additional 24 h for luciferase and β-galactosidase assays. The morpholino antisense oligonucleotide for FLASH expression, encoding 5′-CACCATTGTCATCATCTGCTGCCAT-3′, which targets the first 25 bases of the FLASH coding sequence, was generated by Gene Tool LLC (Philomath, OR). The control the morpholino oligonucleotide, which contains the target sense sequence of FLASH antisense oligonucleotide, was also purchased from the same company. To introduce the antisense oligonucleotide, we employed the ethoxylated polyethylenimine-based special delivery protocol prepared by the company. 24 h after the treatment, cells were transfected with 0.8 μg/well of pMMTV-Luc, 0.5 μg/well of pSV40-β-Gal, and 0.1 μg/well of pRShGRα, and increasing concentrations of dexamethasone were added to the medium 24 h later. The cells were harvested after an additional 24 h of incubation for luciferase and β-galactosidase assays. HCT116 cells were transfected with 0.5–2.0 μg/well of pME18S-FLAG-FLASH, 0.2 g/well of pM-GRIP1(596–774), 1.0 μg/well of pVP16-GRα-LBD, 1.5 μg/well of pGAL4-E1B-Luc, and 0.5 μg/well of pSV40-β-Gal, using Lipofectin. 10−6m of dexamethasone was administered 24 h after transfection. The cells were harvested after an additional 24 h of incubation for luciferase and β-galactosidase assays. GST-fused FLASH(1575–1982) was produced in BL21 bacteria from pGEX-4T3-FLASH(1575–1982). FLASH(1575–1982) was liberated by thrombin treatment. The protein was dialyzed and concentrated in a buffer containing 50 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.9, 50 mm NaCl, 5 mmdithiothreitol and 5% glycerol. 35S-labeled GRα was generated by in vitro translation from pGR107 using reticulocyte lysate. 1, 10, and 100 μg/ml of purified FLASH(1575–1982) was added into the reaction containing labeled GRα and GST-GRIP1(596–774) immobilized on glutathione-Sepharose beads in a buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 50 mmNaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 10% glycerol, and 0.1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin as described previously. After vigorous washing with the buffer, proteins were eluted and separated on 8% SDS-PAGE gels. 5% of total input of labeled GR was loaded as a marker. Gels were fixed and exposed to film. Cells were lysed in a buffer containing 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 0.5% Triton X-100, and 1 tablet/50 ml of CompleteTM (Roche Applied Science, Indianapolis, IN). Whole cell homogenate was obtained by centrifugation at 100 ×g at 4 °C for 10 min. After separation of 10 mg of proteins in SDS-PAGE gels and blotting on nitrocellulose membrane, FLASH was detected by anti-FLASH (M-300, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA). For detecting endogenous FLASH by indirect immunofluorescent staining, cells were cultured in a multi-well slide glass, and FLASH was stained with anti-FLASH followed by fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled secondary antibody. For detecting EGFP-fused FLASH, cells were plated on 20-mm dishes in phenol red-free MacCoy's 5A medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum and antibiotics and then transfected with pME18S-FLASH-EGFP. The cells were analyzed using regular inverted or confocal microscopes. Statistical analysis was carried out by analysis of variance followed by Student'st-test with Bonferroni correction for multiple comparisons. To identify molecules regulating glucocorticoid receptor activity at the level of p160 coactivators, we performed a yeast two-hybrid screening using the NRB domain of the p160 coactivator GRIP1. We found four clones out of 80 colonies, which contained different C-terminal cDNA fragments of the FLASH molecule (data not shown). The shortest interactor represented the sequence included between amino acids 1636 and 1982 of FLASH. To confirm and localize the portion of FLASH that interacts with GRIP1 NRB, we constructed a series of prey vectors that contained different fragments of FLASH cDNA, and tested the interaction of their products with GRIP1 NRB in our yeast two-hybrid assay (Fig. 1 A). As expected, FLASH(1709–1982), but not the other fragments, specifically interacted with the GRIP1 NRB. Since we used the wild type GRIP1 NRB, which has three intact LXXLL motifs, it was of particular interest to determine whether FLASH interacted with GRIP1 through any of these LXXLL motifs as nuclear receptors do. To accomplish this, we examined the interaction of FLASH(1709–1982) with mutated GRIP1 NRB defective in the LXXLLs motifs by replacing two leucines with alanines in each of the three LXXLL motifs in the same yeast two-hybrid assay (Fig. 1 B). Both LXXLL mutant and wild type GRIP1 NRBs interacted similarly with FLASH, indicating that the FLASH and GRIP1 NRB interaction is LXXLL motif-independent. To further localize the portion of GRIP1 NRB necessary for binding to FLASH, we tested a set of bait plasmids expressing different portions of GRIP1 NRB for their binding to FLASH(1709–1982) (Fig. 1 C). GRIP1(597–774), -(691–743), -(646–743), and -(691–774), all of which are devoid of LXXLL motifs, strongly interacted with FLASH, indicating that GRIP1(691–743), whose amino acid sequence is highly conserved in subtypes and species, is responsible for binding to FLASH (12Glass C.K. Rose D.W. Rosenfeld M.G. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 222-232Google Scholar). Since this portion of GRIP1 is located between two LXXLL motifs that are essential for the binding of GRIP1 to the GR (32Ding X.F. Anderson C.M., Ma, H. Hong H. Uht R.M. Kushner P.J. Stallcup M.R. Mol. Endocrinol. 1998; 12: 302-313Google Scholar, 33Darimont B.D. Wagner R.L. Apriletti J.W. Stallcup M.R. Kushner P.J. Baxter J.D. Fletterick R.J. Yamamoto K.R. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 3343-3356Google Scholar), we hypothesized that FLASH might modulate the binding activity of GRIP1 to GR. To examine this, we used GST pull-down and mammalian two-hybrid assays. In the former assay, we used a bacterially produced and purified C-terminal portion of FLASH peptide, while in the latter system, we employed full-length FLASH, expressed by a plasmid (Fig. 2). GR bound to GST-GRIP NRB in a ligand-dependent fashion, as previously reported. Addition of FLASH(1574–1982) suppressed their interaction in a dose-dependent fashion (Fig. 2 A). Coexpression of full-length FLASH also dose-dependently suppressed the interaction of dexamethasone-activated GR and GRIP1-NRB, which was functionally determined in our two-hybrid assay (Fig. 2 B). These results strongly suggest that FLASH inhibits interaction of GRIP1 and the ligand-activated GR by binding to GRIP1 NRB domain. Based on the above binding results, we next examined the effect of FLASH on GR-induced transactivation in a transient transfection reporter system (Fig. 3). Full-length FLASH suppressed dexamethasone-stimulated GR transactivation on the MMTV promoter in a dose-dependent fashion (Fig. 3 A). On the other hand, FLASH(Δ1697–1982), which was devoid of its C-terminal portion necessary for the binding to the GRIP1 NRB domain, did not suppress GR activity. FLASH also suppressed GRIP1 enhancement of GR transactivation, indicating that FLASH antagonized GRIP1 coactivation of the GR (Fig. 3 B). We next examined the role of FLASH on GR transactivation employing a FLASH antisense morpholino oligonucleotide to suppress endogenous levels of FLASH (Fig. 3,C and D). This oligonucleotide targeted the translation start site of the FLASH mRNA and efficiently suppressed levels of FLASH protein measured by Western blot analysis after 48 h of incubation (Fig. 3 C). FLASH antisense shifted the dexamethasone dose-dependent curve to the left and upward, suggesting that endogenous FLASH functions as an inhibitory factor on glucocorticoid-induced GR transactivation (Fig. 3 D). How does FLASH, a cytoplasmic protein associated with the TNF-R and Fas receptor, interact with GRIP1, which resides mainly in the nucleus (7Baumann C.T., Ma, H. Wolford R. Reyes J.C. Maruvada P. Lim C. Yen P.M. Stallcup M.R. Hager G.L. Mol. Endocrinol. 2001; 15: 485-500Google Scholar, 27Imai Y. Kimura T. Murakami A. Yajima N. Sakamaki K. Yonehara S. Nature. 1999; 398: 777-785Google Scholar)? To address this, we examined the intracellular distribution and localization of FLASH. Using indirect immunofluorescent staining with anti-FLASH and regular inverted microscopy, this protein was predominantly located in the cytoplasm, although a small fraction of immunofluorescence was also detected in the nucleus (Fig. 4 A, a andb). In subsequent confocal microscope analysis, we confirmed that a small proportion of FLASH was located in the nucleus (Fig. 4 A, c). On the other hand, when we employed transfected FLASH-EGFP, we detected both cytoplasmic and nuclear localizations of the protein (Fig. 4 B, a–c). Inside the nucleus, FLASH-EGFP was distributed in small speckles (Fig. 4 B, a and b). The discrepancy of FLASH cytoplasmic versus nuclear localization in the two methods employed may indicate that FLASH shuttles between the cytoplasm and the nucleus. Since FLASH is downstream of TNFα and Fas, we examined the effect of TNFα on FLASH localization by indirect immunofluorescent staining. Incubation of cells with TNFα induced strong nuclear localization of FLASH in some cells, suggesting that TNFα may suppress GR transactivation by promoting the nuclear localization of FLASH (Fig. 5). TNFα antagonizes the effects of glucocorticoids through activation of NR-κB (23McKay L.I. Cidlowski J.A. Endocr. Rev. 1999; 20: 435-459Google Scholar, 34Franchimont D. Martens H. Hagelstein M.T. Louis E. Dewe W. Chrousos G.P. Belaiche J. Geenen V. J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. 1999; 84: 2834-2839Google Scholar). Since TNFα induced FLASH nuclear localization and FLASH suppressed GR transactivation, we examined the relative contribution of FLASH on TNFα-induced suppression of GR-induced, GRE-mediated transactivation by dissecting its activity from that of NF-κB (Fig. 6,A and B). For this purpose, we used a super-repressor IκBα, which contains serine to alanine mutations at residues 32 and 36, which inhibit signal-induced phosphorylation and subsequent proteasome-mediated degradation (29Wang C.Y. Mayo M.W. Baldwin A.S., Jr. Science. 1996; 274: 784-787Google Scholar). This IκBα mutant constitutively binds to NF-κB and suppresses its nuclear translocation and subsequent DNA binding. A concentration of 30 ng/ml of TNFα suppressed dexamethasone-stimulated GR-induced, GRE-mediated transactivation on the MMTV promoter by 60%. Coexpression of super-repressor IκBα partially eliminated the TNFα effect, while it almost completely abolished TNFα-induced NF-κB transactivation. When both the FLASH antisense and super-repressor IκBα were introduced into the cells, TNFα completely lost its suppressive effect while FLASH suppressed GR-induced, GRE-mediated transactivation regardless of presence or absence of super-repressor IκBα. These results strongly suggest that FLASH suppresses GR transactivation independently of NF-κB. To demonstrate additivity between the FLASH and NF-κB effects on GR transactivation, we examined coexpression of FLASH and the p65 component of NF-κB on the MMTV promoter. As expected, the suppressive effect of FLASH and p65 on the MMTV promoter was additive (Fig. 6 C), further supporting the conclusion that FLASH and NF-κB function separately on blocking GR-induced, GRE-mediated transactivation. The GR coactivator GRIP1 interacted specifically with the TNF-R- and Fas-associated FLASH (Fig. 7). The latter, a large protein, was originally cloned as a transducer of TNFα and FasL apoptotic signals (27Imai Y. Kimura T. Murakami A. Yajima N. Sakamaki K. Yonehara S. Nature. 1999; 398: 777-785Google Scholar). The C-terminal portion of FLASH, corresponding to amino acids 1709–1982, located just C-terminally to the death-effector domain-recruiting domain (DRD), bound GRIP1 at its region enclosed between amino acid 691 and 743, which is highly conserved in subtypes and species and located between the second and the third LXXLL motifs in the NRB region of the coactivator. FLASH interacted with GRIP1 in a LXXLL motif-independent fashion and suppressed both GR-induced transactivation and GRIP1 enhancement on the glucocorticoid-responsive MMTV promoter by possibly inhibiting access of this nuclear receptor to the LXXLL motifs of the coactivator. TNFα suppressed GR transactivation through FLASH independently and in addition to that produced by NF-κB (25MacEwan D.J. Cell Signal. 2002; 14: 477-492Google Scholar). Thus, although FLASH was originally discovered as part of cytoplasmic DISC complexes with Fas and caspase-8 (27Imai Y. Kimura T. Murakami A. Yajima N. Sakamaki K. Yonehara S. Nature. 1999; 398: 777-785Google Scholar), it was also detected in the nucleus; furthermore, TNFα treatment caused it to translocate from the cytoplasm into the nucleus. NF-κB antagonizes GR action through mutual protein-protein interactions by inhibiting its binding to GREs or by preventing the GRE-bound GR coactivator complex from effectively modulating transcription (23McKay L.I. Cidlowski J.A. Endocr. Rev. 1999; 20: 435-459Google Scholar, 24Caldenhoven E. Liden J. Wissink S. Van de Stolpe A. Raaijmakers J. Koenderman L. Okret S. Gustafsson J.A. Van der Saag P.T. Mol. Endocrinol. 1995; 9: 401-412Google Scholar) (Fig. 7). FLASH, on the other hand, suppresses GR action by inhibiting its binding to p160 coactivators through their mutual competition for the NRB domain of the coactivators (Fig. 7). FLASH binds a portion of GRIP1 NRB, located between the second and the third LXXLL motifs. Since these two motifs are essential for the binding of the coactivator to nuclear receptors (32Ding X.F. Anderson C.M., Ma, H. Hong H. Uht R.M. Kushner P.J. Stallcup M.R. Mol. Endocrinol. 1998; 12: 302-313Google Scholar), FLASH must be exerting steric hindrance, preventing access of the GR to these motifs. Glucocorticoids may function both as inducers and as inhibitors of apoptosis, depending on the target tissues/cells and the resting or activated state of these cells (35Evans-Storms R.B. Cidlowski J.A. Endocrinology. 2000; 141: 1854-1862Google Scholar, 36Schwartzman R.A. Cidlowski J.A. Int. Arch. Allergy Immunol. 1994; 105: 347-354Google Scholar, 37Ashwell J.D., Lu, F.W. Vacchio M.S. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2000; 18: 309-345Google Scholar, 38Riccardi C. Zollo O. Nocentini G. Bruscoli S. Bartoli A. D'Adamio F. Cannarile L. Delfino D. Ayroldi E. Migliorati G.

FASEB J. 1999; 13: 467-476Google Scholar). Therefore, FasL, a strong inducer of apoptosis upstream of FLASH, might promote or prevent apoptotic actions of glucocorticoids through FLASH, depending on the target tissues or cellular state. Since other nuclear receptors also interact with p160 coactivators, it is quite possible that FLASH also regulates their functions by changing their binding activity to p160 proteins (5McKenna N.J. Lanz R.B. O'Malley B.W. Endocr. Rev. 1999; 20: 321-344Google Scholar, 6Leo C. Chen J.D. Gene. 2000; 245: 1-11Google Scholar). Estrogen and progesterone, for example, have strong effects on proliferation/differentiation and apoptosis in the uterus, mammary glands, ovaries, bone, and central nervous system that may also be influenced by cytokines, such as TNFα and FasL (41Rosenfeld C.S. Wagner J.S. Roberts R.M. Lubahn D.B. Reproduction. 2001; 122: 215-226Google Scholar, 42Eisen A. Weber B.L. Curr. Opin. Oncol. 1998; 10: 486-491Google Scholar, 43Gompel A. Somai S. Chaouat M. Kazem A.

Steroids. 2000; 65: 585-592Google Scholar). Thus, FLASH might play an important role in the actions of these hormones or other nuclear hormones as well. FLASH might exert diverse influences on the actions of different nuclear hormones, given that the various nuclear receptors employ different sets of LXXLL motifs in the NRB domains of various p160 nuclear receptor coactivators in their interactions with them, and given that the relative concentrations of p160 coactivators are different between types of cells and between cells at varying functional states (32Ding X.F. Anderson C.M., Ma, H. Hong H. Uht R.M. Kushner P.J. Stallcup M.R. Mol. Endocrinol. 1998; 12: 302-313Google Scholar, 33Darimont B.D. Wagner R.L. Apriletti J.W. Stallcup M.R. Kushner P.J. Baxter J.D. Fletterick R.J. Yamamoto K.R. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 3343-3356Google Scholar). We have obtained preliminary data on such diversity of FLASH effects in different nuclear receptor systems. 2T. Kino and G. Chrousos, unpublished information. We showed that FLASH shifted its subcellular localization from the cytoplasm into the nucleus in response to TNFα (Fig. 7 A). The underlying mechanism is not known; however, FLASH contains two nuclear localization signals around amino acids 1200 and 1760 and one nuclear export signal around 1180, which could facilitate nucleocytoplasmic shuttling (27Imai Y. Kimura T. Murakami A. Yajima N. Sakamaki K. Yonehara S. Nature. 1999; 398: 777-785Google Scholar). In some cells expressing EGFP-fused FLASH, this protein showed a speckled pattern in the nucleus. The FLASH-binding partner GRIP1 and other nuclear receptor coactivators, such as p300 and CBP, also show similar subnuclear localization accumulating in ND10 nuclear bodies containing 26 S proteasome (7Baumann C.T., Ma, H.

Combe H. Lecomte P. Chrousos G.P. J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. 2002; 87: 2658-2667Google Scholar). Thus, FLASH might also be located in the same nuclear bodies with these coactivators. One of the p160 coactivators, SRC-3, was recently shown to be located in the cytoplasm in a serum-depleted condition and to translocate into the nucleus in response to TNFα (9Wang Z. Rose D.W. Hermanson O. Liu F. Herman T., Wu, W. Szeto D. Gleiberman A. Krones A. Pratt K. Rosenfeld R. Glass C.K. Rosenfeld M.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 13549-13554Google Scholar, 10Wu R.C.

Although we have not tested the association of FLASH and SCR-3, it is possible that these two proteins might form a complex in the cytoplasm and translocate into the nucleus in response to TNFα, FasL, or other extracellular factors.

https://openalex.org/W2013820126,"Phosphorylation of cdk2 on threonine 160 is essential for kinase activity. Mevastatin, an inhibitor of cholesterol synthesis, inhibits cell growth through inhibition of cdk2 and this has been suggested to be due to enhancement of p21 levels. In a prostate cancer cell line, PC3, mevastatin treatment led to elevated levels of p21 and caused a small increase in the p21 associated with cdk2. However, this increase in the associated p21 appeared out of proportion with the resulting dramatic inhibition of kinase activity. Using RNA interference we show that mevastatin inhibits cdk2 activity despite lack of induction of p21, p27, and p57. Instead the kinase was inhibited due to a decrease in activating phosphorylation. Phosphorylation of cdk2 from mevastatin-treated cells with exogenous cyclin-dependent kinase (cdk)-activating enzymes restored its functional activity. The only known mammalian cyclin H·cdk7·mat1 complex (cdk2-activating kinase, Cak), was not inhibited by mevastatin, suggesting either that a different CAK is responsible for cdk2 phosphorylation in vivo or that the regulation is at the level of substrate accessibility or of cdk2 dephosphorylation. These results suggest that mevastatin inhibits cdk2 activity in PC3 cells through the inhibition of Thr-160 phosphorylation of cdk2, providing a novel example of regulation of cdk2 at this level.

The basic cell cycle machinery is composed of regulatory cyclin subunits complexed to cyclin-dependent kinase (cdk) 1The abbreviations used are: cdk, cyclin-dependent kinase; RNAi, RNA interference; GST, glutathione S-transferase; Cak, cdk2-activating kinase; CKI, cdk inhibitor; TGF, transforming growth factor; siRNA, small interfering RNA 1The abbreviations used are: cdk, cyclin-dependent kinase; RNAi, RNA interference; GST, glutathione S-transferase; Cak, cdk2-activating kinase; CKI, cdk inhibitor; TGF, transforming growth factor; siRNA, small interfering RNA subunits (1Morgan D.O. Nature. 1995; 374: 131-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (2920) Google Scholar). When active, the cyclin·cdk complex phosphorylates specific substrates in a cell cycle-dependent manner. Cyclin E·cdk2 is active in mid G1 close to the restriction point, cyclin A·cdk2 from the beginning of S to M, whereas cyclin B·cdk1 is active at the G2-M transition (2Sherr C.J. Cell. 1993; 73: 1059-1065Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1986) Google Scholar). After binding of the cyclin to the cdk, the resulting heterodimer remains inactive because of the presence of inhibitory phosphorylation and/or lack of activating phosphorylation. cdk2 contains two sites of inhibitory phosphorylations on threonine 14 and on tyrosine 15. It also contains a site for activating phosphorylation on threonine 160 (3Solomon M.J. Kaldis P. Results Probl. Cell Differ. 1998; 22: 79-109Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). The activation of cyclin E or A·cdk2 requires the dephosphorylation of Thr-14 and Tyr-15 and the phosphorylation of Thr-160. The former is accomplished through the action of the dual specificity phosphatase CDC25 (4Gautier J. Solomon M.J. Booher R.N. Bazan J.F. Kirschner M.W. Cell. 1991; 67: 197-211Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (684) Google Scholar) and the latter through the action of the Cdk-activating enzyme; CAK (5Solomon M.J. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1994; 19: 496-500Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Inhibitory proteins, which associate with and inactivate the kinase, further regulate cyclin·cdks (6Sherr C.J. Roberts J.M. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 1149-1163Crossref PubMed Scopus (3205) Google Scholar). p21 and its close relatives p27 and p57 belong to this class of cdk inhibitors (CKIs).Regulation of cdk in response to different stimuli has until now been described at the level of CKI induction or changes in the inhibitory phosphorylation on Thr-14 and Tyr-15. Following gamma radiation or exposure to other DNA-damaging agents, p21 is induced in a p53-dependent manner to inhibit cdk2 and block the cell cycle at the G1-S transition (7Waldman T. Lengauer C. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Nature. 1996; 381: 713-716Crossref PubMed Scopus (717) Google Scholar). Intra-S phase checkpoints activated by DNA damage and mitotic checkpoints induced by DNA damage or incomplete DNA replication lead to inhibitory phosphorylation of cdks (cdk2 or cdk1, respectively) on Thr-14 and Tyr-15. In contrast, regulation of a cyclin·cdk complex at the level of Thr-160 phosphorylation appears to be rare.Because of the pivotal role of cyclin E or A·cdk2 in cell cycle progression, molecules that inhibit their activities are likely to have antineoplastic properties. Inhibitors of the rate-limiting enzyme in cholesterol synthesis, hydroxymethyl-glutaryl-CoA reductase, have growth deterrent effects in a number of normal and cancer cell lines (8Keyomarsi K. Sandoval L. Band V. Pardee A.B. Cancer Res. 1991; 51: 3602-3609PubMed Google Scholar, 9Rao S. Lowe M. Herliczek T.W. Keyomarsi K. Oncogene. 1998; 17: 2393-2402Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). Collectively known as “statins,” these drugs are used for treatment of hypercholesterolemia (10Retterstol K. Stugaard M. Gorbitz C. Ose L. Am. J. Cardiol. 1996; 78: 1369-1374Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). One explanation for their growth-altering effects is that the lack of isoprenylation of key regulatory proteins like Ras, Rap, and others leads to defective subcellular localization of these key proteins. Lovastatin, however, inhibits cdk2 through a ras-independent pathway (11DeClue J.E. Vass W.C. Papageorge A.G. Lowy D.R. Willumsen B.M. Cancer Res. 1991; 51: 712-717PubMed Google Scholar). Growth inhibition was accompanied by an induction of CKIs, p21, and/or p27 (9Rao S. Lowe M. Herliczek T.W. Keyomarsi K.

The increased association of p21 with cyclin·cdk2 that accompanies the cdk2 kinase inhibition is believed to account for the cell cycle block. However, definitive evidence that p21 and/or p27 are necessary for growth inhibition by statins has been lacking, and alternate pathways by which statins could inhibit cdks have not been explored.The studies reported here evaluate the molecular mechanism of inhibition of cell proliferation by mevastatin. Mevastatin, an analogue of lovastatin, leads to a profound G1 block in a prostate (PC3) cancer cell line. Although p21 levels are elevated and its association with cdk2 increased, it is unlikely that the inhibition of kinase activity and cellular proliferation are caused by p21. Instead a decrease in the activating phosphorylation of cdk2 likely accounts for the antiproliferative effects of this drug.DISCUSSIONLike its analog, lovastatin, mevastatin inhibits cell growth. In PC3 cells, this antiproliferative effect parallels an increase in cellular levels of p21, leading to the assumption that the increased association of p21 with cdk2 is sufficient to account for the kinase inhibition and cell-cycle block. The p21 and p27 levels are enhanced in lovastatin-treated cells via the inhibition of the proteasomes (12Rao S. Porter D.C. Chen X. Herliczek T. Lowe M. Keyomarsi K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 7797-7802Crossref PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar). Although there is no doubt that p21 levels are elevated in mevastatin-treated cells, our studies suggest that p21 may not always be the active inhibitor of the cdk2 kinase. In fact, a model where p21 interacts with the cyclin·cdk to inhibit its activity cannot explain the observations we report here, for the following reasons. 1) The p21 associated with cdk2 appears out of proportion with the dramatic reduction of kinase activity noted with mevastatin treatment. TGF-β1 enhances the levels of p21 and increases its association with cdk2 but does not inhibit the kinase activity. Thus a mere 2-fold increase in the association of p21 with the kinase complex upon treatment with mevastatin is unlikely to be enough to inhibit the cdk2. 2) Elimination of p21 from PC3 cells by RNA interference does not prevent the mevastatin-induced cell cycle block and cdk2 inhibition, suggesting that p21 is dispensable for these effects of mevastatin. 3) Lastly, in experiments to be reported elsewhere we find that, consistent with the above observations, overexpression of p21 in PC3 cells does not result in cell cycle arrest, despite elevated levels and association of p21 with cyclin E·cdk2. This implies that the p21 protein in PC3 cells is inactive in the inhibition of the cdk2. The inactivity of p21 in these cells is thus the primary reason for unmasking a second pathway by which mevastatin inhibits cdk2.In PC3 cells a decrease in activating phosphorylation of cdk2 is the critical factor that suppresses cyclin E·cdk2 kinase. This might be secondary to decreased levels or activity of the cdk2-activating kinase (Cak). There is some debate regarding the identity of the physiologic Cak in mammalian cells. Although the trimeric complex of cyclin H, cdk7, and mat1 (20Fisher R.P. Jin P. Chamberlin H.M. Morgan D.O. Cell. 1995; 83: 47-57Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar, 21Fisher R.P. Morgan D.O. Cell. 1994; 78: 713-724Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (552) Google Scholar) was long felt to assume this role, a number of lines of experimental evidence suggest that there might well be a second Cak in mammalian cells. First, in yeast the physiologic cak1p is a monomer that has no significant homology to any of the members of the trimeric mammalian Cak. Second, the trimeric Cak complex is a constituent of the basal transcriptional unit TFII-H, whereas the yeast cak1p plays no role in transcription (22Shiekhattar R. Mermelstein F. Fisher R.P. Drapkin R. Dynlacht B. Wessling H.C. Morgan D.O. Reinberg D. Nature. 1995; 374: 283-287Crossref PubMed Scopus (360) Google Scholar). Lastly, recent experimental evidence suggests that a second Cak activity can be identified in chromatographic fractions of HeLa cell lysates (23Kaldis P. Solomon M.J. Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 4213-4221Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar) and that an immunologically similar protein can be identified in HepG2 cells with antibodies to the yeast Cak1p (24Nagahara H. Ezhevsky S.A. Vocero-Akbani A.M. Kaldis P. Solomon M.J. Dowdy S.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 14961-14966Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar).We have not yet detected enhanced cdk2 phosphatase activity in cell extracts following mevastatin treatment. Furthermore, the constitutively active phosphatase (protein phosphatase type 2C) that has been identified in mammalian cells targets Thr-160 of monomeric cdk2 for dephosphorylation. Because the decreased phosphorylation of cdk2 from mevastatin-treated cells is seen on cyclin E-complexed cdk2, it is unlikely that enhanced protein phosphatase type 2C activity is responsible. As a result, we favor the possibility that a novel mammalian Cak is suppressed or that cdk2 is sequestered from cyclin H·cdk7·mat1 Cak in mevastatin-treated PC3 cells.The failure to phosphorylate Rb upon mevastatin treatment leads to decreased cyclin A transcription, decreased cyclin A complexed with cdk2, and loss of cyclin A·cdk2 kinase activity, further contributing to the cell cycle block. Therefore, the decrease in cdk2 kinase activity occurs through two different mechanisms: 1) a primary decrease in Thr-160 phosphorylation of cyclin E·cdk2 and 2) a secondary decrease of cyclin A mRNA and protein.In summary, we provide evidence for a novel pathway by which mevastatin inhibits cyclin-dependent kinases and cell cycle progression in PC3 cells. Treatment of hepatoma-derived HepG2 cells with TGF-β was reported to decrease the activating phosphorylation on cyclin E·cdk2 without any increase in p21 or other cdk inhibitors (24Nagahara H. Ezhevsky S.A. Vocero-Akbani A.M. Kaldis P. Solomon M.J. Dowdy S.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 14961-14966Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Our results provide a second example where the activating phosphorylation on cdk2 is regulated independently of changes in associated cyclin or cdk inhibitors. Because p21 is a potent inhibitor of cdk2 in vitro, there are many examples where the induction of p21 occurring concurrently with inhibition of cdk2 has led to the assumption that the p21 inhibits the kinase by simple and direct association in the affected cells. Our studies suggest that, in some of these cells, p21 may be dispensable for the inhibition of the kinase and that additional inhibitory pathways may be in use. The basic cell cycle machinery is composed of regulatory cyclin subunits complexed to cyclin-dependent kinase (cdk) 1The abbreviations used are: cdk, cyclin-dependent kinase; RNAi, RNA interference; GST, glutathione S-transferase; Cak, cdk2-activating kinase; CKI, cdk inhibitor; TGF, transforming growth factor; siRNA, small interfering RNA 1The abbreviations used are: cdk, cyclin-dependent kinase; RNAi, RNA interference; GST, glutathione S-transferase; Cak, cdk2-activating kinase; CKI, cdk inhibitor; TGF, transforming growth factor; siRNA, small interfering RNA subunits (1Morgan D.O. Nature. 1995; 374: 131-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (2920) Google Scholar). When active, the cyclin·cdk complex phosphorylates specific substrates in a cell cycle-dependent manner. Cyclin E·cdk2 is active in mid G1 close to the restriction point, cyclin A·cdk2 from the beginning of S to M, whereas cyclin B·cdk1 is active at the G2-M transition (2Sherr C.J. Cell. 1993; 73: 1059-1065Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1986) Google Scholar). After binding of the cyclin to the cdk, the resulting heterodimer remains inactive because of the presence of inhibitory phosphorylation and/or lack of activating phosphorylation. cdk2 contains two sites of inhibitory phosphorylations on threonine 14 and on tyrosine 15. It also contains a site for activating phosphorylation on threonine 160 (3Solomon M.J. Kaldis P. Results Probl. Cell Differ. 1998; 22: 79-109Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). The activation of cyclin E or A·cdk2 requires the dephosphorylation of Thr-14 and Tyr-15 and the phosphorylation of Thr-160. The former is accomplished through the action of the dual specificity phosphatase CDC25 (4Gautier J. Solomon M.J. Booher R.N. Bazan J.F. Kirschner M.W. Cell. 1991; 67: 197-211Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (684) Google Scholar) and the latter through the action of the Cdk-activating enzyme; CAK (5Solomon M.J. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1994; 19: 496-500Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Inhibitory proteins, which associate with and inactivate the kinase, further regulate cyclin·cdks (6Sherr C.J. Roberts J.M. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 1149-1163Crossref PubMed Scopus (3205) Google Scholar). p21 and its close relatives p27 and p57 belong to this class of cdk inhibitors (CKIs). Regulation of cdk in response to different stimuli has until now been described at the level of CKI induction or changes in the inhibitory phosphorylation on Thr-14 and Tyr-15. Following gamma radiation or exposure to other DNA-damaging agents, p21 is induced in a p53-dependent manner to inhibit cdk2 and block the cell cycle at the G1-S transition (7Waldman T. Lengauer C. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Nature. 1996; 381: 713-716Crossref PubMed Scopus (717) Google Scholar). Intra-S phase checkpoints activated by DNA damage and mitotic checkpoints induced by DNA damage or incomplete DNA replication lead to inhibitory phosphorylation of cdks (cdk2 or cdk1, respectively) on Thr-14 and Tyr-15. In contrast, regulation of a cyclin·cdk complex at the level of Thr-160 phosphorylation appears to be rare. Because of the pivotal role of cyclin E or A·cdk2 in cell cycle progression, molecules that inhibit their activities are likely to have antineoplastic properties. Inhibitors of the rate-limiting enzyme in cholesterol synthesis, hydroxymethyl-glutaryl-CoA reductase, have growth deterrent effects in a number of normal and cancer cell lines (8Keyomarsi K. Sandoval L. Band V. Pardee A.B. Cancer Res. 1991; 51: 3602-3609PubMed Google Scholar, 9Rao S. Lowe M. Herliczek T.W. Keyomarsi K. Oncogene. 1998; 17: 2393-2402Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). Collectively known as “statins,” these drugs are used for treatment of hypercholesterolemia (10Retterstol K. Stugaard M. Gorbitz C. Ose L. Am. J. Cardiol. 1996; 78: 1369-1374Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). One explanation for their growth-altering effects is that the lack of isoprenylation of key regulatory proteins like Ras, Rap, and others leads to defective subcellular localization of these key proteins. Lovastatin, however, inhibits cdk2 through a ras-independent pathway (11DeClue J.E. Vass W.C. Papageorge A.G. Lowy D.R. Willumsen B.M. Cancer Res. 1991; 51: 712-717PubMed Google Scholar). Growth inhibition was accompanied by an induction of CKIs, p21, and/or p27 (9Rao S. Lowe M. Herliczek T.W. Keyomarsi K. Oncogene. 1998; 17: 2393-2402Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar), due to the inhibition of proteasomes by statins (12Rao S. Porter D.C. Chen X. Herliczek T. Lowe M. Keyomarsi K. Proc. Natl.

Walton P. Oltvai Z. Korsmeyer S. Shore G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 16521-16524Google Scholar, 16Tanaka S. Saito K. Reed J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 10920-10926Google Scholar). We previously demonstrated that overexpressed Bcl-2 prevents cells that express v-Ha-rasfrom undergoing apoptosis in response to protein kinase C (PKC) down-regulation. This protection coincides with the binding of Bcl-2 to Ras (17Chen C.-Y. Faller D.V. Oncogene. 1995; 11: 1487-1498Google Scholar, 18Chen C.-Y. Faller D.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 2376-2379Google Scholar). However, the molecular mechanism by which the interaction of Bcl-2 and Ras regulates apoptosis has remained unknown. The biological effects of Ras on cell growth or apoptosis depend strongly upon the kind of stimulus, cell type, or regulatory environment (19Downward J.D. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1998; 8: 49-54Google Scholar). Human or mouse lymphocytes expressing activatedras undergo apoptosis in response to PKC down-regulation and this apoptotic process is blocked by overexpression of bcl-2(17Chen C.-Y. Faller D.V. Oncogene. 1995; 11: 1487-1498Google Scholar, 18Chen C.-Y. Faller D.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 2376-2379Google Scholar, 20Chen C.-Y. Liou J. Forman L.W. Faller D.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 16700-16709Google Scholar). Ras activity is involved in Fas-regulated, multiple signaling pathways (13Fesik S.W. Cell. 2000; 103: 273-282Google Scholar, 21Gulbins E. Brenner B. Koppenhoefer U. Linderkamp O. Lang F. J. Leukoc. Biol. 1998; 78: 247-306Google Scholar). However, Bcl-2 partially protects lymphocytes from Fas-induced apoptosis, possibly through decreasing the permeability of the mitochondrial membrane (22Itoh N. Tsujimoto Y. Nagata S. J. Immunol. 1993; 151: 621-627Google Scholar, 23Jaattela M. Benedict M. Tewari M. Shayman J.A. Dixit V.M. Oncogene. 1995; 10: 2297-2305Google Scholar). It is well known that upon activation or mitogenic stimulation a series of post-translational modifications, including prenylation, -AAX proteolysis, and carboxyl methylation, occur on the C terminus of Ras. This process allows Ras to associate with membrane compartments, especially with plasma membrane (24Bartels D.J. Mitchell D.A. Dong X. Deschenes R.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 6775-6787Google Scholar, 25Clark S. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1992; 61: 355-386Google Scholar, 26Deschenes R.J. Resh M.D. Broach J.R. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1990; 2: 1108-1113Google Scholar). Ras family proteins (Ki-, Ha-, and N-Ras) have also been demonstrated to associate with mitochondria in murine lymphokine-dependent TS1αβ cells (27Rebollo A. Perey-Sala D. Martiney-A C. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 4930-4939Google Scholar). The function of mitochondrial Ras has not been fully investigated yet. Furthermore, the CAAX motif of Ras may regulate its N-terminal conformation and further affect its ability to interact with other proteins (2Strasser A. Harris A.W. Huang D.C. Krammer P.H. Cory S. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 6136-6147Google Scholar, 26Deschenes R.J. Resh M.D. Broach J.R. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1990; 2: 1108-1113Google Scholar, 28Prior I.A. Harding A. Yan J. Sluimer J. Parton R.G. Hancock J.F. Nature Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 368-375Google Scholar). It is, so far, unclear whether prenylation on the CAAX motif of Ras is required for its apoptotic signaling. In Fas-induced apoptosis, endogenous Ras in Jurkat cells is activated via the ceramide signaling pathway (22Itoh N. Tsujimoto Y. Nagata S. J. Immunol. 1993; 151: 621-627Google Scholar, 23Jaattela M. Benedict M. Tewari M. Shayman J.A. Dixit V.M. Oncogene. 1995; 10: 2297-2305Google Scholar, 29Gulbins E. Bissonnette R. Mahboubi A. Martin S. Nishioka W. Brunner T. Baier G. Baier-Bitterlich G. Byrd G. Lang F. Green D. Immunity. 1995; 2: 341-351Google Scholar). Jurkat cells have been reported to be sensitive to Fas-engagement, which may be due to very low expression of Bcl-2 (18Chen C.-Y. Faller D.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 2376-2379Google Scholar, 30Fernandez-Sarabia M.J. Bischoff J.R. Nature. 1993; 36: 274-275Google Scholar). In order to explore further the mechanism(s) of Bcl-2 protection against Ras-mediated apoptotic signaling, we introduced either bcl-2 or ras, as well as both genes, into Jurkat cells, and then examined the consequences in the setting of Fas-engagement or PKC suppression. We demonstrate that, under apoptotic conditions, newly synthesized Bcl-2 is preferentially expressed in mitochondria, and subsequently binds to activated, mitochondrial Ras. Such regulation was confirmed in EBV-positive Burkitt's lymphoma Akata cells that express increased levels of endogenous Bcl-2 or mouse lung cancer LKR cells that contain activated ras. Also, by using various bcl-2mutants, we identified the BH4 domain of Bcl-2 as the interaction site with Ras, and this domain is crucial for protection against Ras-mediated apoptotic signaling. Furthermore, we established that the integrity of the CAAX motif of Ras and its prenylation are necessary for apoptotic activity, and regulate the ability of Ras to associate with Bcl-2. Jurkat cells were obtained from ATCC. Fas/FADD-defective Jurkat cells were generated by random mutagenesis and obtained from Dr. J. Blenis (Harvard Medical School, MA). The EBV-positive Burkitt's lymphoma Akata cell line and the EBV-negative Burkitt's lymphoma Ramos cell line were obtained from Dr. S. Ghosh (Boston University School of Medicine). The lung cancer LKR cells derived from the lung foci of v-Ki-ras transgenic mouse were given by Dr. T. Jack (MIT). v-Ha-ras orras with a C-terminal deletion was inserted into aMSCV retroviral vector containing the neo gene (Invitrogen). The expression of ras was examined by Northern blot (17Chen C.-Y. Faller D.V. Oncogene. 1995; 11: 1487-1498Google Scholar). bcl-2 and various bcl-2 mutants were generously provided by Dr. T. Parslow (University of California at San Francisco). An ER marker and a c-myc epitope (pCMV/myc/ER) were inserted into a pShooter vector for the determination of ER location (Invitrogen). Cells (50 × 106), after the treatments, were washed twice with 1× phosphate-buffered saline and resuspended in 1 ml of 1% Triton X-114 lysis buffer (31Downward J. Graves J.D. Warne P.H. Rayter S. Cantrell D.A. Nature. 1990; 346: 719-723Google Scholar). The cell suspensions were transferred to a 1-ml syringe and sheared by being passed 40 times through a 25-gauge needle. The lysates were centrifuged at 280 × g for 10 min to precipitate nuclei, and the supernatants were collected. One-third of the whole cell extract was saved, and the remainder was centrifuged at 16,000 × g for 30 min. The supernatant (cytosol) was collected, and the pellet was washed in the lysis buffer containing 1% Nonidet P-40 for 1 h on ice and centrifuged again at 100,000 × g. The supernatant (P100) was saved (50Boldin M.P. Goncharov T.M. Goltsev Y.V. Wallach D. Cell. 1996; 85: 803-815Google Scholar). For the ER fraction, an OptiPrepTM kit (Invitrogen) was used. For the mitochondrial fraction, 3 × 109 cells were resuspended in buffer A (50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 1 mm EGTA, 5 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, 0.2% bovine serum albumin, 10 mm KH2PO4, pH 7.6, 0.4 m sucrose), and allowed to swell on ice for 40 min. After differential centrifugation, the resulting pellets were resuspended in buffer B (10 mmKH2PO4, pH 7.2, 0.3 mm mannitol, 0.1% bovine serum albumin). Mitochondria were subsequently separated on a sucrose step gradient (32Scaffidi C. Fulda S. Srinivasan A. Li C. Friesen F. Tomaselli K.J. Debatin K.-M. Krammer P.H. Peter M.E. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 1675-1687Google Scholar). After treatment with anti-Fas Ab (1.5 μg/ml for 60 min for human cells (PanVera Corp.) or HMG (1-O-hexadecyl-2-O-methyl-rac-glycerol, 150 nm for 24 h, Calbiochem), cell fractions were isolated and total protein concentrations in each fraction were normalized. Subsequently, the fractions were adjusted to 0.4m NaCl, 0.5% deoxycholate, and 0.05% SDS (31Downward J. Graves J.D. Warne P.H. Rayter S. Cantrell D.A. Nature. 1990; 346: 719-723Google Scholar). Each sample was divided into two aliquots for reciprocal immunoblotting. The samples were immunoprecipitated with either anti-pan-Ras Ab (Oncogene Science) or anti-human Bcl-2 Ab (BD PharMingen) for 4 h at 4 °C. Immunoprecipitates were collected with protein A-Sepharose and separated on a 12% SDS-PAGE gel. Bcl-2 or Ras were then detected with anti-Ras Ab or anti-Bcl-2 Ab. Anti-cytochrome c, inositol trisphosphate receptor (IP3R) or tubulin Abs (Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc.) were used as immunoblot controls. For cell surface staining, the cells were incubated with anti-Fas Ab for 2 h and stained with a second Ab conjugated with fluorescein. For DNA fragmentation assay, after the treatments with anti-Fas Ab [1.5 μg/ml for 60 min for human cells (PanVera Corp.) or HMG (1-O-hexadecyl-2-O-methyl-rac-glycerol, 150 nm for 24 h, Calbiochem), cells (1 × 106/ml) were washed with phosphate-buffered saline twice, fixed with 70% ethanol, and stained with phosphate-buffered saline containing 10 ng/ml RNase and 50 ng/ml propidium iodide. We previously demonstrated that oncogenic ras elicits apoptosis once the activity of endogenous PKC is suppressed, and that the overexpression of Bcl-2 blocks this process, possibly through its association with Ras (18Chen C.-Y. Faller D.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 2376-2379Google Scholar). The mechanism of Bcl-2-mediated protection against Ras apoptotic signaling is unclear. Because Ras is involved in Fas-induced apoptosis and Bcl-2 partially protects cells from Fas-induced apoptosis (20Chen C.-Y. Liou J. Forman L.W. Faller D.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 16700-16709Google Scholar, 22Itoh N. Tsujimoto Y. Nagata S. J. Immunol. 1993; 151: 621-627Google Scholar, 23Jaattela M. Benedict M. Tewari M. Shayman J.A. Dixit V.M. Oncogene. 1995; 10: 2297-2305Google Scholar, 39Kuida K. Haydar T.F. Kuan C.Y. Gu Y. Taya C. Karasuyama H. Su M.S. Rakic P. Flavell R.A. Cell. 1998; 94: 325-337Google Scholar, 33Parijs L.V. Biuckians A. Abbas A.K. J. Immunol. 1998; 160: 2065-2071Google Scholar), we tested whether Bcl-2 interacts with Ras during Fas-induced apoptosis. v-Ha-ras, bcl-2, or both genes were introduced into Jurkat cells (designated PH1, Jurkat/bcl-2, or PH1/bcl-2, respectively), and a DNA fragmentation assay was conducted. The cells were treated with anti-Fas antibody (Ab) for 6 or 15 h to engage Fas signaling, and the percentages of the cells with fragmented DNA were analyzed by flow cytometry (Fig.1 A). Jurkat cells that overexpress v-Ha-ras (PH1 cells) were more susceptible to Fas-induced apoptosis than the other three cell lines. The percentage of PH1 cells with fragmented DNA was dramatically increased at 6 h after addition of anti-Fas Ab (about 35%), and reached more than 40% after 15 h, indicating that overexpressed, activated Ras accelerates Fas-induced apoptosis. However, DNA fragmentation in Jurkat/bcl-2 cells did not increase 6 h after Fas-ligation and was only about 12% at 15 h. The level of DNA fragmentation in PH1/bcl-2 cells was intermediate between the levels observed in Jurkat/bcl-2 and PH1 cells. It appears that overexpressed Bcl-2, in the initial period (up to 15 h after Fas-ligation), protects cells (Jurkat/bcl-2) from Fas-mediated cell death, or delays the onset of the apoptotic process. A control experiment was also conducted using an unrelated, isotype-matched Ab. An unrelated Ab did not cause apoptosis (data not shown). Indirect immunofluorescence staining of Fas was also conducted to exclude the possibility that introduction of the exogenous gene(s) affects surface expression of Fas antigen. The levels of Fas did not change if bcl-2, ras or both were overexpressed (Fig. 1 A, inset). We then examined whether Fas-engagement alters Bcl-2 or Ras protein expression using immunoblotting analysis. Jurkat or PH1 cells expressed very low amounts of Bcl-2. The levels of Bcl-2 in a whole cell extract from untreated Jurkat/bcl-2 and PH1/bcl-2 cells were higher (about 6.6-fold than Jurkat or PH1 cells), and Fas-ligation did not cause further induction of the protein (Fig. 1 B,upper panels). A Ras immunoblot showed a similar result, in which the ras transfectants express 5-fold higher levels of the protein compared with the parental cell lines (Fig. 1 B,lower panels). Again, Fas-ligation did not alter protein expression. Because the parental cells express a very low amount of Bcl-2 or Ras, we used Jurkat/bcl-2 and PH1/bcl-2cells to examine whether Fas-ligation alters the subcellular distribution of Bcl-2 and Ras. The subcellular fractions from these two cell lines, with or without Fas-ligation, were prepared for immunoblotting (Fig. 1 C). Bcl-2 was detectable in the mitochondrial fraction of untreated cells, and the protein level increased 4–6-fold in response to Fas-engagement. Significant Bcl-2 was seen in the ER fraction under normal growth conditions. After Fas-ligation, however, the level of Bcl-2 in ER was dramatically reduced (about 3–4-fold). Bcl-2 was not detected in the cytosol fractions from these cells, as expected. The expression of Ras in the subcellular fractions was also examined by immunoblot. A basal level of endogenous Ras protein was detected in various subcellular membrane fractions from Jurkat/bcl-2 cells under normal growth conditions, and Fas-ligation did not alter the protein expression. In contrast, moderate and high levels of Ras protein were detected in the mitochondrial and plasma membrane fractions from untreated PH1/bcl-2 cells, respectively, and the expression did not change upon Fas-engagement. The data suggest that apoptotic stimulation by Fas-ligation alters the expression of Bcl-2 in the subcellular compartments, but not of Ras. The relative purity of the subcellular fractions from the cells, with or without Fas-engagement, was confirmed by immunoblotting for the expression of cytochrome c (a mitochondrial marker), inositol trisphosphate receptor (IP3R, an endoplasmic reticulum marker), tubulin (a cytosol marker), and CD4 (a plasma membrane marker) respectively (Fig.1 D). After the apoptotic stimulation, equal amounts of the proteins were detected in their corresponding subcellular fractions in comparison to the untreated controls. Bcl-2 expression in various subcellular fractions was also examined in different bcl-2or bcl-2/ras clones, and similar results were obtained, which excludes the possibility of clonal variation (data not shown). We next examined whether changes of Bcl-2 expression levels in different subcellular fractions occur in PKC/Ras-mediated apoptosis. Jurkat/bcl-2 and PH1/bcl-2 cells were exposed to HMG (150 nm, a PKC inhibitor) for 24 h, and then the mitochondrial and ER fractions were prepared for immunoblotting (Fig.1 E, left panel). In response to PKC inhibition, the level of Bcl-2 in the ER fraction from PH1/bcl-2 cells was dramatically reduced, which coincided with increased protein in mitochondria. Interestingly, because PKC suppression is not a death signal to Jurkat/bcl-2 cells, the levels of the protein in the subcellular fractions from the cells did not change, which suggests that the altered expression of Bcl-2 in mitochondria of PH1/bcl-2 cells after PKC suppression is related to apoptosis. The relative purity of the subcellular fractions from the cells, with or without HMG treatment, was confirmed by the immunoblotting (Fig. 1 E, right panels). It is known that Bcl-2 is induced in some Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-positive Burkitt's lymphoma cells (34Henderson S. Rowe M. Gregory C. Croom-Carter D. Wang F. Longnecker R. Kieff E. Rickinson A. Cell. 1991; 65: 1107-1115Google Scholar). Akata (a EBV-positive) and Ramos (a EBV-negative) Burkitt's cell lines were used to test whether endogenous Bcl-2 could provide the same protection. We also employed mouse LA4 cells (a mouse lung epithelial-like cell line) and LKR (a mouse lung cancer cell line derived from the lung foci of v-Ki-ras transgenic mouse). The expression of Bcl-2 or Ras in these cells was examined by immunoblotting (Fig.2 A, upper panels). Increased amounts of Bcl-2 or Ras were detected in Akata or LKR cells, respectively. The amount of total proteins in each sample was monitored by re-probing the blots with anti-actin Ab (Fig. 2 A,lower panels). We then introduced v-Ha-ras orbcl-2 into Akata (Akata/ras) or LKR (LKR/bcl-2) cells to examine their susceptibility to PKC/Ras-mediated apoptosis, using a DNA fragmentation assay. After treating the cells with HMG, the percentages of the cells with fragmented DNA were analyzed by flow cytometry (Fig. 2 B). The inhibitor did not induce apoptosis in Akata cells, which is consistent with our previous observation in which normal cells (without oncogenic ras) do not die in response to PKC suppression (17Chen C.-Y. Faller D.V. Oncogene. 1995; 11: 1487-1498Google Scholar, 18Chen C.-Y. Faller D.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 2376-2379Google Scholar). However, the introduction of v-ras did not render the cells (Akata/ras) susceptible to HMG-mediated cell killing, indicating that overexpression of endogenous Bcl-2 blocks the apoptotic process. In comparison, about 40% of mouse lung cancer LKR cells had fragmented DNA after HMG treatment. Overexpressedbcl-2 interfered with this apoptotic process in LKR/bcl-2 cells. The expression of Bcl-2 in different subcellular compartments of the cells was also examined (Fig.2 C, left panels). The ER and mitochondrial fractions from the cells with or without HMG treatment were prepared and subsequently immunoblotted with an anti-Bcl-2 Ab. A high level of Bcl-2 was detected in the ER fraction from untreated Akata, Akata/ras, and LKR/bcl-2 cells, and the protein was moderately expressed in the ER fraction from LKR cells. Bcl-2 in the ER was significantly reduced after HMG treatment in Akata/ras, LKR/bcl-2, and LKR cells, but not in Akata cells. In mitochondria, a very low amount of the protein was detected in the untreated cells. However, the protein level in those cells (except Akata cells) was dramatically increased in response to HMG treatment. The data, again, indicate that endogenous Bcl-2 redistributes and protects the cells against PKC/Ras-mediated apoptosis. The relative purity of the subcellular fractions from the cells, with or without Fas-engagement, was confirmed by immunoblotting (Fig. 2 C, right panels). We then tried to determine whether the altered expression of Bcl-2 in the subcellular fractions during apoptosis is due to the translocation or redistribution of the protein. After Fas-ligation, immunoblotting of ER or mitochondrial Bcl-2 in PH1/bcl-2 cells, with or without cycloheximide (a protein synthesis inhibitor) treatment, was performed (Fig. 3 A). Bcl-2 was visualized in the ER fraction under normal growth conditions, and only a small amount of the protein was detected in mitochondria. After Fas-ligation, the level of Bcl-2 in ER was dramatically reduced, and, in contrast, the protein expression in mitochondria was augmented in the cells. After blocking protein synthesis by cycloheximide, the amount of ER Bcl-2, with or without Fas-engagement, was reduced to more than half in comparison to the control. In the mitochondrial fraction, in the presence of cycloheximide, the protein was decreased to an almost undetectable level. The data suggest that the increased amount of mitochondrial Bcl-2 induced by Fas-ligation (seen in Fig.1 C) is from the newly synthesized protein, but not from pre-existing Bcl-2 via translocation. To confirm this further,35S pulse-chasing analysis was conducted (Fig.3 B). After labeling PH1/bcl-2 cells with [35S]methionine, the ER and mitochondrial fractions were prepared. Each sample was divided into two portions for 35S pulse-chasing or co-immunoprecipitation and immunoblotting. Two hours after terminating the pulse, 35S-labeled Bcl-2 in ER, with or without Fas Ab treatment, was reduced (about 0.7-fold reduction) (Fig. 3 B, upper panels). In the mitochondrial fraction, a similar decay pattern of labeled Bcl-2 was also observed. In a co-immunoprecipitation and immunoblotting experiment, Bcl-2 expression in the ER fraction was dramatically reduced after Fas-ligation, and the mitochondrial Bcl-2 expression was increased (Fig. 3 B, lower panels). Therefore, the results provide the same conclusion that newly synthesized Bcl-2, upon Fas-engagement, is preferentially expressed in mitochondria. We previously demonstrated that, in PH1/bcl-2 cells, Bcl-2 bound to Ras in response to PKC down-regulation (18Chen C.-Y. Faller D.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 2376-2379Google Scholar). Here, we tried to confirm further this association by using another apoptotic setting (Fas-engagement) and to determine the location of the interaction. The reciprocal co-immunoprecipitation of Bcl-2 and Ras was performed (Fig.4). There was no co-precipitation of these two molecules in the whole cell lysate from untreated Jurkat, Jurkat/bcl-2, PH1, or PH1/bcl-2 cells (Fig.4 A, first row). After Fas-ligation, an anti-Bcl-2 immunoblot visualized Bcl-2 associated with the anti-Ras co-immunoprecipitate from PH1/bcl-2 and Jurkat/bcl-2 cells. The association was not seen in either PH1 or Jurkat cells, which is probably due to the fact that Jurkat cells express very low amounts of Bcl-2 and Ras. The similar result was obtained from the co-immunoprecipitation and immunoblotting of the mitochondrial fraction, in which a high level of Bcl-2 was recovered in the anti-Ras co-immunoprecipitate from PH1/bcl-2 cells after Fas-ligation, and a lower level of the protein was detected in Jurkat/bcl-2 cells. The interaction was not detected in the ER fractions from any of the four cell lines after Fas-engagement. In a reciprocal experiment, wherein the initial immunoprecipitation was carried out with anti-Bcl-2 Ab, an anti-Ras immunoblot detected an increased amount of Ras in the co-immunoprecipitate from the whole cell extract or mitochondrial fraction of PH1/bcl-2 cells, and a detectable level of co-bound Ras in the same subcellular fractions of Jurkat/bcl-2 cells, in response to Fas-ligation (Fig.4 A, third row). Again, Ras did not co-immunoprecipitate with the anti-Bcl-2 Ab in ER fractions from any of the four cell lines in response to Fas-engagement. The presence of Ras (Fig. 4 A, second row) or Bcl-2 (Fig.4 A, fourth row) in the immunoprecipitates from these subcellular fractions was also confirmed by re-probing the corresponding blots with either the anti-Ras Ab or the anti-Bcl-2 Ab. As a control, preimmune serum was used for immunoprecipitation in whole cell extracts from the cells, followed by immunoblotting with anti-Bcl-2 or anti-Ras Ab to eliminate the possibility of nonspecific binding of these two proteins (Fig. 4 B). There was no co-immunoprecipitation of either Bcl-2 or Ras with preimmune serum. The same results were obtained from the mitochondrial fraction (data not shown). The co-immunoprecipitation and immunoblotting of Bcl-2 and Ras, in response to PKC suppression, was also performed in Akata, Akata/ras, LKR, and LKR/bcl-2 cells (Fig.4 C, upper panels). The strong interaction between Bcl-2 and Ras, after HMG treatment, was detected in Akata/ras or LKR/bcl-2 cells. A low level of Bcl-2 was precipitated by the anti-Ras Ab in LKR cells. The association was not detected in Akata cells in response to the treatment (because PKC inhibition is not a death signal to the cells). The existence of Ras in the co-precipitates was confirmed by re-probing the same blot with the anti-Ras Ab (Fig. 4 C, lower panels). Overall, the data suggest that the physical association of Bcl-2 with Ras occurs only under apoptotic conditions and in mitochondria. Cytochrome c release indicates an increase in mitochondrial permeability, and Bcl-2 regulates the permeability transition to block apoptosis (35Adachi S. Cross A.R. Babior B.M. Gottlieb R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 21878-21882Google Scholar, 36Chao D.T. Korsmeyer S.J. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1998; 16: 395-419Google Scholar, 37Pan G. O'Rourke K. Dixit V.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 5841-5845Google Scholar). We tested if overexpressing ras,bcl-2, or both genes affects mitochondrial cytochromec release to cytosol after Fas-engagement (Fig.5 A). Cytoplasmic fractions from PH1, PH1/bcl-2, Jurkat and Jurkat/bcl-2cells at various times after Fas-engagement were prepared for immunoblot analysis. Cytochrome c was detected in the cytosol fraction from PH1 cells 6 h after Fas-ligation. Release of the protein was persistent during the apoptotic process. In Jurkat/bcl-2 cells, the protein was undetectable in the cytosol 9 h after addition of anti-Fas Ab, and cytosolic cytochrome c did appear in PH1/bcl-2 cells. The pattern of cytochrome c release in Jurkat cells was similar to PH1/bcl-2 cells. The data suggest that the anti-apoptotic effects of bcl-2 and the pro-apoptotic effect ofras both contribute to the degree of mitochondrial damage resulting from Fas-induced apoptotic signaling. The relative purity of the cytosolic fractions from the cells, with or without Fas-engagement, was confirmed by immunoblotting (data not shown). The formation of the death-inducing signaling complex (DISC) via recruitment of FADD and caspase 8 is the initial event in Fas signaling (38Hsu Y.T. Wolter K.G. Youle R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 3668-3672Google Scholar). To confirm that the redistribution of Bcl-2 and its interaction with Ras indeed depend upon an intact DISC, v-Ha-ras andbcl-2 were co-introduced into Fas or FADD mutant Jurkat cells (Fasm or FADDm cells). The defect in the formation of DISC (which is due to Fas or FADD mutation) impaired the red"

The hypoxic microenvironment may increase tumor aggressiveness (2Graeber T.G. Osmanian C. Jacks T. Housman D.E. Koch D.J. Lowe S.W. Giaccia A.J. Nature. 1996; 379: 88-91Google Scholar), presumably through specific induction of transcription factors such as hypoxia-inducible factor 1 (HIF1) 1The abbreviations used are: HIF, hypoxia-inducible factor; HRE, HIF-regulatory element; NC2, negative cofactor 2; PIC, preinitiation complex; ALLN, N-acetyl-Leu-Leu-norleucinal; AFP, α-fetoprotein; VEGF, vascular endothelial growth factor; TBP, TATA-binding protein; EPO, erythropoietin; CTD, C-terminal domain 1The abbreviations used are: HIF, hypoxia-inducible factor; HRE, HIF-regulatory element; NC2, negative cofactor 2; PIC, preinitiation complex; ALLN, N-acetyl-Leu-Leu-norleucinal; AFP, α-fetoprotein; VEGF, vascular endothelial growth factor; TBP, TATA-binding protein; EPO, erythropoietin; CTD, C-terminal domain (4Semenza G.L.

Under normoxic conditions the HIF1α subunit is hydroxylated at proline 564, promoting high affinity interaction with the von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) tumor suppressor protein and ubiquitin-mediated degradation (5Ivan M. Kondo K. Yang H. Kim W. Valiando J. Ohh M. Salic A. Asara J.M. Lane W.S. Kaelin Jr., W.G. Science. 2001; 292: 464-468Google Scholar, 6Jaakkola P. Mole D.R. Tian Y.M. Wilson M.I. Gielbert J. Gaskell S.J. Kriegsheim A. Hebestreit H.F. Mukherji M. Schofield C.J. Maxwell P.H. Pugh C.W. Ratcliffe P.J. Science. 2001; 292: 468-472Google Scholar). Upon exposure to low oxygen tension, HIF1α is not hydroxylated, is stabilized, and interacts with HIF1β. The HIF1 heterodimer binds to hypoxia-responsive elements and activates the promoters of HIF-responsive genes (7Kimura H. Weisz A. Ogura T. Hitomi Y. Kurashima Y. Hashimoto K. D'Acquisto F. Makuuchi M. Esumi H. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 2292-2298Google Scholar). In addition to HIF-mediated gene activation, cells under reduced oxygen also limit non-essential cellular processes in order to survive (2Graeber T.G. Osmanian C. Jacks T. Housman D.E. Koch D.J. Lowe S.W. Giaccia A.J. Nature. 1996; 379: 88-91Google Scholar). Thus, cells under stress may channel their energy into productive gene expression, whereas non-productive genes and processes are turned off. Gene-specific transcription inhibition can be induced by regulated repressors of transcription (reviewed in Refs. 8Lemon B. Tjian R. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 2551-2569Google Scholar and 9Gray S. Levine M. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1996; 8: 358-364Google Scholar). Certain types of these repressors modify chromatin structure (10Zhang Y. Reinberg D. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 2343-2360Google Scholar), whereas others inhibit transcription through core promoter and general transcription factor interactions (11Ghavidel A. Schultz M.C. Cell. 2001; 106: 575-584Google Scholar) (reviewed in Ref. 12Lee T.I. Young R.A. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 1398-1408Google Scholar). Among this latter group of transcriptional repressors is negative cofactor 2 (NC2α/β, Dr1/DrAP1), which blocks transcription by association with DNA-bound TFIID and inhibits PIC assembly in vitro. NC2α and NC2β are essential genes, and their gene products regulate ∼17% of all Saccharomyces cerevisiae genes either positively or negatively (13Geisberg J.V. Holstege F.C. Young R.A. Struhl K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 2736-2742Google Scholar). In S. cerevisiae, NC2 is required for specific TATA-containing gene repression under times of reduced nitrogen availability (14Lemaire M. Xie J. Meisterernst M. Collart M. Mol. Microbiol. 2000; 36: 163-173Google Scholar). Recent work surveying Drosophila promoter elements and studies with purified proteins reveal that NC2 represses transcription from TATA element-containing promoters but activates promoters that rely on downstream promoter elements (DPEs) for regulation (15Willy P.J. Kobayashi R. Kadonaga J.T. Science. 2000; 290: 982-985Google Scholar, 16Butler J.E.F. Kadonaga J.T. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 2515-2519Google Scholar, 17Kutach A.K. Kadonaga J.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 4754-4764Google Scholar). Our findings reveal an active mechanism by which mammalian cells can establish inactive promoters in response to hypoxia. We show that the physiological stimulus of hypoxia increases NC2 activity in mammalian cells, concomitant with selective transcription repression. A limited survey of cellular stress conditions reveals that hypoxia may be unique in exploiting this fundamental mechanism of gene regulation. Hepatoma cells (Hepa 1–6, American Type Culture Collection) and primary, normal human fibroblasts were plated overnight in glass dishes in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% fetal bovine serum at 10,000 cells/cm2, the media was changed, and the cells were transferred into a hypoxic chamber (Bactron 2, Sheldon Labs) for the indicated times. These conditions have been established in order to maintain stable pH and glucose over the course of the experiment. Cell viability, at the end of all treatments, was judged by trypan blue exclusion and found to be >70% even under severe, long term hypoxic conditions. Cells extracts were prepared as described (18Crowe A.J. Sang L. Li K.K. Lee K.C. Spear B.T. Barton M.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 25113-25120Google Scholar). The drug treatments 150 μm CoCl2 (in H2O, Sigma), 0.5 μg ml−1 doxorubicin (in H2O, Sigma), and 50 μm ALLN (in Me2SO, Calbiochem) were added to fresh media at the indicated times. Ionizing radiation was delivered from a 137Cs source at 3.5 gray/min. Northern blot probes were obtained from the Image Consortium (Incyte) and sequenced prior to use to confirm inserts. Primer extension analyses with lacZ-specific primer (AFP), luciferase-specific primers (3× HRE and VEGF), chick β-globin-specific primer, and a chloramphenicol acetyl transferase (CAT)-specific primer (p21) were performed under standard conditions (19Lee K.C. Crowe A.J. Barton M.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 1279-1288Google Scholar). Single-round transcription conditions were performed as published (20Hawley D.K. Roeder R.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 8163-8172Google Scholar), except that a 10-min preincubation period was used as established for supercoiled templates. Protein A beads were swollen in RNase-free H2O (250 mg/2 ml H2O) and transferred into 1× phosphate-buffered saline. Antibody (anti-NC2, gift of T. Oegelschlager; anti-TBP, Santa Cruz Biotechnology; anti-CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein, Santa Cruz Biotechnology) was added to the beads at a ratio of 200 ng of antibody/1 ml of 50% slurry beads. The beads were washed twice in nuclear dialysis buffer (NDB), (20 mm Hepes, pH 7.9, 50mm KCl, 0.2 mm EDTA, and 20% glycerol). Nuclear extract was added to the beads at 1.5× the volume of washed, antibody-bound beads and incubated for 1 h at 4 °C, rocking. Beads were removed by centrifugation, and supernatant was used as an immunodepleted extract. TFIID, PC4, and FLAG-RNA polymerase II were purified and added to transcription reactions as described previously (21Wu S.-Y. Chiang C.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 12494-12498Google Scholar). Recombinant DR1/NC2β protein was purchased from ProteinOne, College Park, MD. We investigated mechanisms of hypoxia-regulated gene expression using in vitro transcription. Whole-cell transcription extracts were prepared from murine hepatoma (Hepa 1–6) cells that are p53 wild-type and AFP positive. Activation ofAFP is associated with hepatocellular carcinoma and various malignant tumors. Extracts were prepared after cell exposure to ionizing radiation, 0.01% oxygen, the hypoxia-mimetic CoCl2 (150 μm), or the proteosome inhibitor ALLN (Fig. 1 A). In vitro transcription of AFP in each extract, including control normoxia and HeLa extracts, revealed complete inhibition of transcription only in the hypoxic cell extract. The transcription inhibitory response to hypoxia was neither tissue-specific nor restricted to transformed cells. We used extracts of normal human fibroblast cells grown as primary cultures (Fig.1 B) in normoxia, hypoxia, or the hypoxia-mimetic cobalt chloride (150 μm) and found an equally dramatic inhibition of transcription, specifically in the hypoxic extracts. This repression in hypoxic extracts is dominant in mixing experiments, suggesting the function of an inhibitor rather than the loss of an essential protein. Control and hypoxic hepatoma extracts were mixed together at the indicated ratios and tested for transcriptional activity on the AFP template (Fig. 1 C). Note that even at 20% input (lane 3) the hypoxic extract inhibited transcription activity. The dominant function of the hypoxic extract supports a model of active repression versus simply loss of energy under hypoxic conditions. The general nature of hypoxia-mediated repression was revealed by transcription of three gene templates that share few if any trans-acting regulatory elements upstream of the proximal promoter, i.e.the p21/WAF1 gene (which is p53-activated) (22El-Deiry W.S. Harper J.W. O'Connor P.M. Velculescu V.E. Canman C.E. Jackman J. Pietenpol J.A. Cancer Res. 1994; 54: 1169-1174Google Scholar),AFP (which is repressed by p53) (19Lee K.C. Crowe A.J. Barton M.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 1279-1288Google Scholar), and chickβ-globin (which is not regulated by p53) (23Ogden S.K. Lee K.C. Barton M.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 27806-27814Google Scholar) (Fig. 2 A). Transcription of each gene was strongly inhibited in hypoxic cell extracts. By contrast, treatment of cells with doxorubicin (0.5 μg ml−1 for 24 h) robustly induced p53 in these cells (data not shown) but had varied effects, including none (AFP), 2-fold inhibition (β-globin), and induction of several transcripts from aberrant start sites (p21). These data confirmed hypoxia-dependent repression of transcription conferred through a widely conserved regulatory element independently of p53 activation. Though multiple genes were repressed in hypoxic extracts, this repressive effect is selective. As observed in vivo, the transcription of gene templates containing hypoxia-inducible HIF1 regulatory elements is activated in vitro rather than repressed (Fig. 2 B). One of these constructs contains three copies of an HRE from the 3′-untranslated region of the erythropoietin (EPO) gene (24Semenza G.L. Wang G.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 5447-5454Google Scholar) fused to a heterologous promoter/luciferase reporter (3× HRE). The other hypoxia-activated template is a natural VEGF promoter and upstream regulatory region (from −2275 to +51) plasmid containing a single HRE and a luciferase reporter (VEGF). This construct lacks the identified VEGF RNA stability element (25Goldberg I. Furneaux H. Levy A.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 7: 7Google Scholar). The 3× HRE and VEGF constructs are transcriptionally induced when transfected into cells and incubated under hypoxic conditions (data not shown). Each of these DNA templates was transcribed in the same extracts under identical conditions and exhibited a different profile of time- and “dose”-dependent responses to hypoxia. AFPshowed hypoxic repression and moderate hypoxia (2% oxygen) yielding moderate repression, whereas severe hypoxia (0.01% oxygen) showed increasing repression with time, and CoCl2 showed no effect. The 3× HRE template showed hypoxic activation, and moderate hypoxia showed induction, whereas severe hypoxia clearly induced expression at 12 h, and by 24 h expression was reduced to control levels; CoCl2 treatment also showed significant induction. In contrast, the VEGF promoter showed induction that required more extreme hypoxic conditions. The naturalVEGF HRE-containing, TATA-less promoter transcribed poorly and was slightly activated at moderate hypoxia but was activated in severe hypoxia slightly at 12 h, increasing at 24 h, and was not activated by CoCl2. This pattern of hypoxia-inducedVEGF expression, including the limited response to CoCl2, matched that observed for endogenous VEGFactivation (Fig. 2 C and Ref. 26Shweiki D. Itin A. Soffer D. Keshet E. Nature. 1992; 359: 843-845Google Scholar). We determined by Northern blot analysis that hypoxia can result in repression of specific mRNAs in vivo. Fig. 2 Cshows that, in primary human fibroblasts exposed to severe hypoxia, specific genes show decreased mRNA levels, whereas others are unchanged or activated by hypoxia. The selective repression of certain genes with the activation of others suggests an active process rather than a passive loss of macromolecular synthesis under conditions of reduced energy. This decline of steady-state RNA levels for a variety of genes, combined with in vitro transcription results, supports a role for hypoxia-regulated transcription repression through widely conserved regulatory elements. Because a diverse set of templates was repressed (Fig 2 A), we focused on the promoter region and examined PIC assembly in control and hypoxic cell extracts (Fig.3 A). Under established conditions for in vitro single-round transcription (20Hawley D.K. Roeder R.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 8163-8172Google Scholar), transcription is dependent solely on protein-DNA interactions (PIC assembly) established (in the absence of NTPs) before washing the protein-bound DNA template and adding Sarkosyl detergent, which prevents subsequent protein binding (see Fig. 3 A,diagram). Addition of Sarkosyl after PIC assembly (Fig.3 A, lanes 4–8) revealed that hypoxic cell extract is incapable of functional PIC assembly (Fig. 3 A, lanes 6 and 8). PICs assembled in hypoxic extract could not elongate (Fig. 3 A, lane 8) nor could transcription be rescued by control extract when DNA binding of control extract proteins is precluded (Fig. 3 A, lane 6). Control extract rescue of hypoxic transcription does occur in the absence of Sarkosyl (Fig. 3 A, lane 3). Importantly, we found that hypoxic extract did not inhibit transcription elongation by PICs preassembled in control extract (Fig. 3 A, lane 5). Thus, any inhibitory factors present in the hypoxic cell extract must act during PIC assembly rather than by altering preassembled transcription initiation complexes or inhibiting transcription elongation. One direct consequence of complete PIC assembly is phosphorylation of the RNA polymerase II C-terminal domain (CTD) before initiation (27Dahmus M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 19009-19012Google Scholar,28Schroeder S.C. Schwer B. Shuman S. Bentley D. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 2435-2440Google Scholar). Western blot analyses with specific antibodies raised against the RNA polymerase II amino terminus (N-20), CTD phosphoserine 5 (H14), CTD phosphoserine 2 (H5), and unmodified CTD (C-19) (29Patturajan M. Schulte R.J. Sefton B.M. Berezney R. Vincent M. Bensaude O. Warren S.L. Corden J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 4689-4694Google Scholar) revealed marked differences between the hypoxic cell extract and other control or treated cell extracts (Fig. 3 B). All of the cell extract preparations contained similar levels of unphosphorylated RNA polymerase II (IIA form) as revealed by the N-20 and C19 antibodies. However, there was a dramatic absence of RNA polymerase II with its CTD phosphorylated (IIO form) at serine 5, and very low amounts of IIO phosphorylated at serine 2 in the hypoxic cell extract. Comparison of blots probed with phospho-specific antibodies and functional analysis of transcription in vitro (Fig. 1) revealed a correlation between loss of RNA polymerase II CTD phosphorylation and repression of transcription. RNA polymerase II CTD-hypophosphorylation at both serines 5 and 2 in hypoxic extracts is most consistent with inhibition of initiation (30Komarnitsky P. Cho E.-J. Buratowski S. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 2452-2460Google Scholar). These findings support a model in which PIC assembly is affected by hypoxia, a dysfunction marked by the lack of RNA polymerase II CTD phosphorylation. Assembly of a PIC is regulated at numerous levels and involves the interactions of many proteins (recently reviewed in Refs. 8Lemon B. Tjian R. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 2551-2569Google Scholar and 31Smale S.T. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 2503-2508Google Scholar). We surveyed a number of purified proteins for their potential ability to restore transcription function to the hypoxic extract. These proteins included TFIID, TFIIH, mediator complex, RNA polymerase IIA, RNA polymerase IIO, immunopurified RNA polymerase II (21Wu S.-Y. Chiang C.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 12494-12498Google Scholar), and recombinant TBP (Fig. 3 C, and data not shown). Among these factors, only relatively high concentrations of recombinant TBP could overcome hypoxia-mediated transcription repression to any degree (to 15% of the control level; Fig. 3 D) when added alone. FLAG-tagged RNA polymerase II (Fl-RNA Poll II; Ref. 21Wu S.-Y. Chiang C.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 12494-12498Google Scholar) alone was also unable to enhance hypoxic transcription (Fig. 3 C, lanes 4–6). However, the combination of both TBP and purified RNA polymerase II (Fig. 3 C, lanes 7–9) reversed hypoxia-mediated repression and increased transcription of hypoxic extract to control activated transcription levels (Fig. 3 C,lane 1). From these data, we hypothesized that high levels of recombinant TBP partially squelched the repressive effect of hypoxia to regain a basal level of transcription (compare with transcription driven by purified RNA polymerase II plus PC4 and TFIID Fig.3 D, lane 7). The addition of both FLAG-RNA polymerase II, which is not hyperphosphorylated (Fig. 3 B), and TBP could effectively rescue hypoxic transcription to control activated levels. These data suggest that a hypoxia-induced repressor interacted with both transcription factors and/or that the RNA polymerase II preparation contained proteins that augmented the ability of TBP to squelch inhibition and promote activated transcription. One of several negative regulators of PIC assembly is NC2 α/β (or Dr1/DrAP1 protein) (12Lee T.I. Young R.A. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 1398-1408Google Scholar, 32Inostroza J.A. Mermelstein F.H. Ha I. Lane W.S. Reinberg D. Cell. 1992; 70: 477-489Google Scholar, 33Meisterernst M. Roeder R.G. Cell. 1991; 67: 557-567Google Scholar). Additionally, interactions between NC2 and RNA polymerase II, which affect RNA polymerase II CTD phosphorylation, have been reported previously (34Castano E. Gross P. Wang Z. Roeder R.G. Oelgeschlager T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 7184-7189Google Scholar).In vitro experimentation supports a model wherein the NC2 protein associates with TBP bound at TATA boxes, which inhibits further assembly of the PIC. We examined this candidate repressor of hypoxic transcription by Western blot analysis with antibodies specific for the NC2 subunits Dr1/NC2β and DrAP1/NC2α. We found that both Dr1/NC2β and DrAP1/NC2α protein levels were elevated in extracts of hypoxia-treated hepatoma cells (Fig.4 A). NC2 is likely regulated post-transcriptionally, as levels of both NC2α and NC2β mRNA remain unchanged with hypoxic treatment (data not shown). In these same extracts, TBP levels are unchanged, and AFP protein levels are reduced, reflecting the transcription response of AFP under hypoxic conditions. The addition of recombinant Dr1/NC2β to control transcription extracts effected repression in a concentration-dependent manner (Fig. 4 B, lanes 1–7) of the control extract to levels observed in hypoxia-incubated cell extracts (lanes 6–10). The ability of the single subunit to repress transcription in vitro has been previously shown with multiple gene templates (reviewed in Ref. 35Maldonado E. Hampsey M. Reinberg D. Cell. 1999; 99: 455-458Google Scholar). We assayed for endogenous NC2 activity by comparing the PIC components (TBP, TFIIB, and Dr1/NC2β) present in control and hypoxic cell extracts (Fig. 4 C) to those bound to promoter DNA, as described previously (Fig. 4 C, diagram, and Ref.36Ranish J.A. Yudkovsky N. Hahn S. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 49-63Google Scholar), under conditions for single-round transcription (Fig.2 A). Similar levels of total TBP (or TFIID) and TFIIB proteins were present in hypoxic and control extracts, but NC2β/Dr1 was increased by hypoxia (Fig. 4 C, lanes 4–6). Comparison of soluble extract to DNA-bound PIC proteins (lanes 1–3, long exposure) revealed an inverse relationship between NC2 and TFIIB in the PICs (lanes 2 and 3). Analyses of mixed hypoxic/control (1:1) extracts support a concentration-dependent profile of proteins specifically bound at the PIC (TBP and NC2) versus those excluded from the PIC (TFIIB) rather than effects on protein degradation or modification. We extended the PIC analysis to RNA polymerase II and its phosphorylated forms bound to the DNA versus total protein (Fig. 4 D). Again, there were similar levels of unphosphorylated RNA polymerase IIA in both hypoxic and control extracts (N-20 antibody) and sharply reduced hypoxic levels of CTD-phosphorylated RNA polymerase II (H14 antibodies). Parallel analysis of PICs revealed that no RNA polymerase II was bound in hypoxic-assembled PICs. Therefore, in the presence of NC2 (Dr1/DrAP1), TFIIB and RNA polymerase II cannot assemble as part of a functional PIC. Reported roles for NC2 (Dr1/DrAP1) complex function (reviewed in Refs. 12Lee T.I. Young R.A. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 1398-1408Google Scholar, 35Maldonado E. Hampsey M. Reinberg D. Cell. 1999; 99: 455-458Google Scholar, and 37Kaiser K. Meisterernst M. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1996; 21: 342-345Google Scholar) in the repression of transcription by blocking entry of TFIIB in PIC assembly is consistent with our results of PIC analysis in hypoxic extracts. To determine whether NC2 protein complexes were primarily responsible for transcription repression induced by hypoxia, we immunodepleted NC2β protein complexes from hypoxic and control cellular extracts. Hypoxic and control extracts were incubated with antibody-coated beads, the beads were removed, and the depleted extracts were assayed for transcription function (Fig. 4 E). Incubation with nonspecific antibody did not alter the transcription properties established for hypoxic and control extracts. Depletion of TBP protein from control extract obliterated transcription and demonstrated the effectiveness of immunodepletion. Incubation with NC2β antibody-coated beads restored transcription capability to hypoxic cell extract and did not alter the ability of control extract to transcribein vitro (lanes 4 and 5). These data show that either NC2β or an NC2β-associated protein complex is an essential component of hypoxia-mediated transcription repression, the removal of which rescues transcription function. The NC2 (Dr1/DrAP1) complex could assume multiple roles in both transcription repression and activation due to either post-translational modifications or association with specific protein binding partners. Interpretation of the NC2/TBP/TATAA DNA ternary complex crystal structure suggests that transcriptional activators or co-activators could overcome NC2-mediated inhibition of functional PIC assembly (38Kamada K. Shu F. Chen H.Y. Malik S. Stolzer G. Roeder R.G. Meisterernst M. Burley S.K. Cell. 2001; 106: 71-81Google Scholar). Post-translational modification may be “stressor-” or target site-specific, as phosphorylation of NC2 by casein kinase II inhibits binding to DNA in general and increases the specificity of TBP interaction (39Goppelt A. Stelzer G. Lottspeich F. Meisterernst M. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 3105-3116Google Scholar). Genome-wide expression analyses and chromatin immunoprecipitation of temperature shift-induced NC2 protein inS. cerevisiae revealed NC2 association with both positively and negatively regulated promoters in response to the stress of heat shock (13Geisberg J.V. Holstege F.C. Young R.A. Struhl K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 2736-2742Google Scholar). More recently, a role for NC2 in stabilizing TBP-DNA binding to promote basal transcription and the displacement of NC2 to effect activated transcription has been demonstrated both in vivo and in vitro for S. cerevisiae(40Cang Y. Prelich G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 12727-12732Google Scholar). A mechanism for a dual role in positive and negative regulation of transcription has been proposed for NC2 (15Willy P.J. Kobayashi R. Kadonaga J.T. Science. 2000; 290: 982-985Google Scholar, 16Butler J.E.F. Kadonaga J.T. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 2515-2519Google Scholar) (reviewed in Ref. 31Smale S.T. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 2503-2508Google Scholar). NC2, which represses PIC assembly at TATA-containing core promoters, activates distal promoter element-regulated promoters inDrosophila (15Willy P.J. Kobayashi R. Kadonaga J.T. Science. 2000; 290: 982-985Google Scholar). This model presents a potential paradigm for mammalian cells in that one induced protein such as NC2 could act as a repressor at many TATA-containing promoters but as an activator at different subsets of genes, e.g. those regulated by HIF1, evoking a timely and energy-efficient response to stress. Potential interaction(s) between HIF-responsive gene promoters and NC2 protein therefore becomes an important question for future investigations. We are grateful to M. Czyzyk-Krzeska, T. Oegelschlager, D. Reinberg, K. Ladaroute, and J. Abraham for providing essential materials and to L. Sang and J. Irish for technical support. We thank M. Czyzyk-Krzeska, A. Giaccia, J.A.K.

In this study, we investigated whether SMCs from vessels with different atherogenicity exhibit distinct growth and migratory potential and investigated the underlying mechanisms. In fat-fed rabbits, we found increased cell proliferation and atheroma formation in the aortic arch versus the femoral artery. When examined in culture, SMCs isolated from the aortic arch (ASMCs) displayed a greater capacity for inducible proliferation and migration than paired cultures of femoral artery SMCs. Two lines of evidence suggested that distinct regulation of the growth suppressor p27Kip1(p27) contributes to establishing these phenotypic dissimilarities. First, p27 expression was comparably lower in ASMCs, which exhibited a higher fraction of p27 phosphorylated on Thr-187 and ubiquitinated. Second, forced p27 overexpression in ASMCs impaired their proliferative and migratory potential. We found that platelet-derived growth factor-BB-dependent induction of the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK)/extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) pathway was comparably higher in ASMCs. Importantly, pharmacological inhibition of MAPKs increased p27 expression and attenuated ASMC proliferation and migration. In contrast, forced MAPK activation diminished p27 expression and markedly augmented femoral artery SMC proliferation and migration. We propose that intrinsic differences in the regulation of MAPKs and p27 play an important role in creating variance in the proliferative and migratory capacity of vascular SMCs, which might in turn contribute to establishing regional variability in atherogenicity.

Atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of mortality and morbidity in developed countries. Although percutaneous transluminal angioplasty has become a well established technique for revascularization of patients with arterial occlusive disease. The occurrence of restenosis at the site of angioplasty remains the major limitation despite the successful procedure. The molecular basis of atherosclerosis and restenosis involves dedifferentiation of vascular smooth muscle cells (SMCs) 1The abbreviations used are: SMC, smooth muscle cells; CDK, cyclin-dependent kinase; MAPK, mitogen-activated protein kinase; p27, p27Kip1; PDGF, platelet-derived growth factor; PDGFR, platelet-derived growth factor receptor; ERK, extracellular signal-regulated kinase; P-ERK, phosphorylated ERK; BrdUrd, bromodeoxyuridine; ASMCs, SMCs isolated from the aortic arch; CSMCs, carotid artery SMCs; FSMCs, femoral artery SMCs; FBS, fetal bovine serum; ITC, insulin-transferrin-selenium medium with 250 μmol/liter ascorbic acid; MEK, mitogen-activated protein kinase/extracellular signal-regulated kinase kinase; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; FGF, fibroblast growth factor; Rev, retroviral vector; SMα-actin, smooth muscle α-actin 1The abbreviations used are: SMC, smooth muscle cells; CDK, cyclin-dependent kinase; MAPK, mitogen-activated protein kinase; p27, p27Kip1; PDGF, platelet-derived growth factor; PDGFR, platelet-derived growth factor receptor; ERK, extracellular signal-regulated kinase; P-ERK, phosphorylated ERK; BrdUrd, bromodeoxyuridine; ASMCs, SMCs isolated from the aortic arch; CSMCs, carotid artery SMCs; FSMCs, femoral artery SMCs; FBS, fetal bovine serum; ITC, insulin-transferrin-selenium medium with 250 μmol/liter ascorbic acid; MEK, mitogen-activated protein kinase/extracellular signal-regulated kinase kinase; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; FGF, fibroblast growth factor; Rev, retroviral vector; SMα-actin, smooth muscle α-actin to a so-called “synthetic state” characterized by abundant production of matrix components and excessive proliferative and migratory activities (1Owens G.K.

Cardiovasc. Dis. 1997; 40: 107-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). Therefore, a better understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying these processes should help develop novel therapeutic approaches for the treatment of cardiovascular disease. Cellular proliferation is regulated by the balance between multiple cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK)/cyclin holoenzymes and members of the Cip/Kip and INK4 families of CDK inhibitors (4Ekholm S.V. Reed S.I. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2000; 12: 676-684Crossref PubMed Scopus (501) Google Scholar,5Elledge S.J. Harper J.W. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1994; 6: 847-852Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar). Active CDK/cyclin complexes promote cell cycle progression by phosphorylating the retinoblastoma gene product, pRb, and the related pocket proteins p107 and p130 from mid-G1 to mitosis. CDK inhibitors associate with and inhibit the activity of CDK/cyclin holoenzymes. Studies arguing for a role of the Cip/Kip protein p27Kip1 (p27) in the pathophysiology of the cardiovascular system include the following. 1) p27 may contribute to the reestablishment of the quiescent phenotype after the initial proliferative response to balloon angioplasty in rat and porcine arteries, and adenovirus-mediated overexpression of p27 inhibited neointimal growth in these experimental models (6Chen D.

Circulation. 2000; 101: 2022-2025Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). 2) p27 may function as a molecular switch that regulates the phenotypic response of vascular SMCs to both hyperplastic and hypertrophic stimuli (9Braun-Dullaeus R.C.

Cell Biol. 2000; 148: 543-556Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). 3) p27 is a negative regulator of endothelial cell proliferation and migration in vitro, and adenovirus-mediated overexpression of p27 inhibited angiogenesis in vivo (11Chen D.

Isner J.M. Andrés V. FASEB J. 2001; 15: 1877-1885Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). 4) p27 may contribute to integrin-mediated control of vascular SMC proliferation (13Koyama H.

Cell. 1996; 87: 1069-1078Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (460) Google Scholar). 5) p27 may limit cardiomyocyte proliferation during early post-natal development and after injury in adult mice (14Koh K.N.

Schaefer H.E. Atherosclerosis. 1999; 144: 7-14Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar), and a causal link between reduced p27 expression and atherosclerosis has been established in apolipoprotein E-deficient mice (17Dı́ez-Juan A. Andrés V. FASEB J. 2001; 15: 1989-1995Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). It has been established that the expression of p27 is regulated mainly at the level of translation and protein turnover (18Philipp-Staheli J. Payne S.R. Kemp C.J. Exp. Cell Res. 2001; 264: 148-168Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar). Multiple growth factors and cytokines interact with specific receptors located in the cytoplasmic membrane of vascular cells in response to a variety of pathological stimuli, thus triggering a complex signal transduction cascade, which culminates in changes in gene expression that execute a proliferative and migratory response (2Ross R. N. Engl. J. Med. 1999; 340: 115-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (19127) Google Scholar, 3Bauters C. Isner J.M. Prog. Cardiovasc. Dis. 1997; 40: 107-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). The activation of the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signal transduction pathway is thought to play an important role during cardiovascular disease (19Force T. Pombo C.M. Avruch J.A.

It has been well established that different segments of the arterial tree display significant differences in their susceptibility to atherosclerosis, both in animal models and humans. In this regard, it is notable that vascular SMCs display regional phenotypic variance both when comparing cells obtained from different compartments of the same vessel or cells isolated from vessels from different vascular beds (24Chamley-Campbell J.H.

The findings of this study demonstrate that p27 and MAPKs are critical regulators of vascular SMC proliferation and migration. Our results suggest that intrinsic differences in the regulation of p27 and MAPKs may contribute to the establishment of regional variance in the proliferative and migratory capacity of SMCs from distinct regions of the vascular system. The following antibodies were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology: cyclin D1 (sc-450), cyclin A (sc-751), cyclin E (sc-198), p27 (sc-1641), α-tubulin (sc-8035), CDK2 (sc-163-G), PDGF receptor isoform β (PDGFR-β) (sc-432), P-ERK1/2 (sc-7383, reactive with Tyr-204-phosphorylated ERK1 and ERK2), and ERK2 (sc-154, reactive with ERK2 and, to a lesser extent, ERK1). Other antibodies were purchased from Calbiochem (anti-p27 phospho-specific Thr-187 (catalog number 506128) and anti-ubiquitin (catalog number 662099)), Dako (anti-5-bromodeoxyuridine (BrdUrd)), and Master Diagnostica (anti-smooth muscle α-actin (clone 1A4) and anti-desmin (clone ZC18)). Male white New Zealand rabbits (4–5-month-old) were fed either control chow (n = 5) or received for 2 months a high fat diet (n = 10) containing 10 g of cholesterol (Sigma) and 60 ml of peanut oil/kg control chow (1% cholesterol). Animals received four intraperitoneal injections of 5-BrdUrd (20 mg/kg each, Sigma) at 12-h intervals starting 48 h before sacrifice. Rabbits were killed with an overdose of pentobarbital. A cut was made in the cava vein, and the systemic circulation was thoroughly perfused with saline through the heart. The aortic arch and the right femoral artery were fixed in situ with 100% methanol. Arteries were removed, fixation was continued overnight, and tissues were paraffin-embedded and cut in 5-μm cross-sections. Immunohistochemistry using mouse monoclonal anti-BrdUrd antibody (1:50) was done with a biotin/streptavidin-peroxidase detection system (Signet Laboratories) and 3,3′-diaminobenzidine tetrahydrochloride substrate (Sigma). The aortic arch, the common carotid artery, and the femoral artery of 4-month-old male New Zealand White rabbits were extracted to prepare primary cultures (SMCs isolated from the aortic arch (ASMCs), carotid artery SMCs (CSMCs), and femoral artery SMCs (FSMCs), respectively). Arteries were dissected free from surrounding tissue and adventitia and cut into small pieces. Aortic tissue was digested with collagenase (2 mg/ml, Worthington) in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium-F12 supplemented with 5% fetal bovine serum (FBS) for 3 h in a shaking bath at 37 °C. Cells were incubated at 37 °C in a humidified 5% CO2, 95% O2 atmosphere in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium-F12 supplemented with 10% FBS, 100 units/ml penicillin, 0.1 mg/ml streptomycin, and 2 mmol/liter l-glutamine. All studies were carried out with primary cultures between passages 2 and 8. Pharmacological inhibition of MAPK kinase (MEK) was achieved by exposing ASMC cultures to PD98059 (Tocris) as indicated in the figure legends. Recombinant retrovirus were generated using the retroviral vectors pBabePuro-p27wt (31Vlach J. Hennecke S. Amati B. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 5334-5344Crossref PubMed Scopus (605) Google Scholar) and pBabePuro-MEKE, which encode for wild-type p27 and a constitutively active MEK1 mutant (32Coso O.A. Chiariello M. Yu J.C. Teramoto H. Crespo P. Xu N. Miki T. Gutkind J.S. Cell. 1995; 81: 1137-1146Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1561) Google Scholar), respectively. pBabePuro-MEKE was generated by digesting pcDNAIII-MEKE (a gift of C. Caelles) with BamHI andXhoI and subcloning the MEKE cDNA into pBabePuro. The infection of asynchronously growing cells was performed as suggested by the supplier of the PT67-packaging cells (Clontech). Infected cells were selected in the presence of puromycin (2.5 μg/ml, Sigma). Cells were plated onto glass coverslips. To examine the expression of differentiation markers, cells were grown until reaching confluence and then were maintained in mitogen-free insulin-transferrin-selenium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 250 μmol/liter ascorbic acid (ITC, Sigma) medium (33Libby P. O'Brien K.V. J. Cell. Physiol. 1983; 115: 217-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar) for 2 days. Cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) at room temperature for 1 h and permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100/PBS. Cells were blocked with 1% bovine serum albumin/PBS, and expression of smooth muscle α-actin (SM α-actin) and desmin was examined by indirect immunofluorescence. Microscopic images were digitally recorded on an Axioscope II microscope (Zeiss). For TUNEL assays, cells were grown to ∼60% confluence and were maintained in mitogen-free ITC medium for 2 days. For UV light irradiation, cell culture medium was removed and the cells were washed twice with PBS. The cultures then were placed in the tissue culture hood and exposed to UV light for 45 min (UV G-30-watt lamp, Sylvania, Japan). Control (not irradiated) and UV-irradiated cells were fixed and permeabilized as indicated above, and TUNEL assay was performed using an in situ cell death detection kit as suggested by the manufacturer (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Cells for [3H]thymidine incorporation assays were plated in 10% FBS/Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium-F12 at a density of 4 × 104 cells/well in 12-well plates. When ∼80% confluence was reached, cells were rendered quiescent by maintaining cultures for 48–72 h in mitogen-free ITC medium (33Libby P. O'Brien K.V. J. Cell. Physiol. 1983; 115: 217-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). Starvation-synchronized cultures were stimulated with platelet-derived growth factor-BB (PDGF-BB) (10 ng/ml) to induce cell cycle reentry, and cells were pulsed with 1 mCi/liter [3H]thymidine (Amersham Biosciences) during the last 4 h of incubation. After washes with cold PBS, DNA was precipitated with 15% trichloroacetic acid and solubilized with 0.2 mol/liter NaOH. Radioactivity incorporated into DNA was measured in a scintillation counter (Wallac). Migration of cultured cells labeled with the fluorescent dye calcein-AM (Molecular Probes) was assessed with the FALCON HTS FluoroBlock system as suggested by the manufacturer (BD Biosciences). Labeled cells were placed in the inserts (8.0-μm pore size, 5 × 104 cells/insert) in serum-free media. The lower chamber contained either serum-free media (unstimulated cells) or the chemotactic agent (10% FBS or 10 ng/ml PDGF-BB) (induced cells). Serum-free medium was supplemented with 0.1% bovine serum albumin. Chemotaxis at different times after plating the cells was assessed by detecting the fluorescence in the lower chamber using a Victor 4120 multilabel counter (Wallac). Results represent the average fluorescence of induced cells (n = 3) after subtracting the fluorescence of unstimulated cells (n = 2–3). Cell lysates were prepared with either ice-cold lysis buffer A or buffer B supplemented with protease inhibitor CompleteTM Mini-mixture (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Buffer A contained 50 mmol/liter Hepes (pH 7.5), 1% Triton X-100, 150 mmol/liter NaCl, 1 mmol/liter dithiothreitol, 0.1 mmorthovanadate, 10 mm β-glycerophosphate, and 10 mm sodium fluoride. Buffer B contained 20 mmol/liter Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 0.5% Triton X-100, 0.5% deoxycholate, 150 mmol/liter NaCl, 10 mmol/liter EDTA, and 1 mmol/liter dithiothreitol. 50 μg of protein was electrophoresed on 12% SDS-PAGE to perform Western blot analysis as described previously (6Chen D. Krasinski K. Chen D. Sylvester A. Chen J. Nisen P.D. Andrés V. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 99: 2334-2341Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). Antibody dilutions were 1:100 (cyclin D1, cyclin A, cyclin E, P-ERK1/2, and p27), 1:200 (α-tubulin and CDK2), 1:250 (PDGFR-β), 1:500 (anti-p27 phospho-specific Thr-187), and 1:700 (ERK2). For immunoprecipitation/Western blot assays, cell lysates were incubated with anti-ubiquitin antibody (0.5 μg) and protein A/G Plus-agarose (Santa Cruz Biotechnologies) for 4 h at 4 °C under rotation. The immune complexes were extensively washed and subjected to Western blot analysis using anti-p27 antibody. CDK activity in cell lysates (100 μg of protein) was determined as described previously (6Chen D. Krasinski K. Chen D. Sylvester A. Chen J. Nisen P.D. Andrés V. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 99: 2334-2341Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar) with the exception that CDK/cyclin holoenzymes were immunoprecipitated with 0.2 μg of each of the anti-cyclin E and anti-cyclin A antibodies. Results are reported as the mean ± S.E. Differences were evaluated using either two-tail unpaired Student's t test or ANOVA and Fisher's post hoc test (Statview, SAS Institute). We investigated atherogenesis in fat-fed New Zealand White rabbits, which rapidly develop atheromas in response to dietary manipulation (34Taylor J.M. Fan J. Front. Biosci. 1997; 2: d298-d308Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). To examine arterial cell proliferation, animals received four injections of BrdUrd prior to sacrifice. Although aortic atherosclerosis and BrdUrd immunoreactivity were essentially undetectable in rabbits fed with control chow (n = 5, data not shown), all of the fat-fed rabbits included in our study displayed atheromatous lesions in the aortic arch and exhibited abundant BrdUrd immunoreactivity in both intimal and medial cells (n = 10, Fig. 1 A). In marked contrast, only 3 of 10 fat-fed rabbits displayed small atherosclerotic lesions in the femoral artery (Fig. 1 B). Moreover, the number of BrdUrd-positive cells in femoral arteries was negligible in the media and was lower within the lesions as compared with the aortic arch (Fig. 1 B). These findings are consistent with previous rabbit studies demonstrating that the aortic arch is highly susceptible to diet-induced atherosclerosis (34Taylor J.M. Fan J. Front. Biosci. 1997; 2: d298-d308Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 35Verbeuren T.J. Jordaens F.H. Zonnekeyn L.L. Van Hove C.E. Coene M.-C. Herman A.G. Circ.

Invest. 1996; 98: 2201-2208Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). Having demonstrated distinct proliferative response and atherogenicity in the aortic arch and femoral artery, we isolated SMCs from these vessels (ASMCs and FSMCs, respectively) to ascertain whether their phenotypic dissimilarities were maintainedin vitro. In primary cultures grown to confluence in serum-free media, ASMCs exhibited an epithelioid shape (Fig. 2 A), whereas FSMCs disclosed a bipolar, spindle-shaped morphology (Fig. 2 B). We next performed indirect immunofluorescence experiments in passage 2 cultures to examine the expression of SMC differentiation markers. Both ASMCs and FSMCs revealed abundant SM α-actin immunoreactivity in a prominent stress fiber pattern (Fig. 2, C and D). In contrast, desmin expression appeared more abundant in FSMCs (Fig. 2,E and F). These phenotypes were stable at least up to passage 8 (data not shown). We next compared the migratory and proliferative capacity of cultured ASMCs and FSMCs. Although FSMCs did not migrate in response to 6 h of stimulation with either PDGF-BB or FBS, both agents elicited a robust migratory response in paired cultures of ASMCs (Fig. 2 G). Likewise, [3H]thymidine incorporation in starvation-synchronized cultures restimulated with PDGF-BB was lower in FSMCs (Fig. 2 H). For example, compared with starved cultures, maximum [3H]thymidine incorporation at 24 h post-stimulation increased by 16- and 42-fold in FSMCs and ASMCs, respectively. The proliferative response toward 10% FBS was also stronger in ASMCs (data not shown). In contrast, as determined by the TUNEL assay, apoptosis was similar in ASMCs and FSMCs, both under control conditions and after UV irradiation (Fig. 2 I). Lineage analysis experiments have suggested that neural crest-derived (ectoderm) SMCs prevail in arterial segments proximal to the heart (i.e. aortic arch and great vessels of the head and neck), whereas arteries located more distally to the heart contain mainly mesoderm-derived SMCs (i.e. abdominal aorta and hind limb arteries) (1Owens G.K. Physiol. Rev. 1995; 75: 487-517Crossref PubMed Scopus (1383) Google Scholar, 27Topouzis S. Majesky M.W. Dev. Biol. 1996; 178: 430-445Crossref Scopus (249) Google Scholar, 38Berk B.C. Physiol. Rev. 2001; 81: 999-1030Crossref PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar). Thus, dissimilar behavior and morphology of ASMCs and FSMCs raised the possibility that adult SMC phenotypic properties are related, at least in part, to their primary embryonic lineage. Consistent with this notion, we found that CSMCs (also of neural crest origin) behaved in a similar fashion as the ASMCs in proliferation and migration assays (Fig. 3). Differences in proliferation and migration between ASMCs and FSMCs prompted us to investigate the underlying molecular mechanisms. Consistent with the results of Fig. 2 Hshowing greater PDGF-BB-dependent proliferation in ASMCs than in FSMCs, CDK activity was higher in PDGF-BB-stimulated ASMCs (Fig. 4 A). Likewise, the up-regulation of the positive cell cycle regulators cyclin D1 and cyclin A, whose expression is induced as starvation-synchronized cells resume progression through G1 and S-phase upon mitogen restimulation (4Ekholm S.V. Reed S.I. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2000; 12: 676-684Crossref PubMed Scopus (501) Google Scholar, 5Elledge S.J. Harper J.W. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1994; 6: 847-852Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar), occurred earlier and was more prominent in PDGF-BB-stimulated ASMCs versus FSMCs (Fig. 4 B). The expression of the PDGFR-β was similar in ASMCs and FSMCs, both under mitogen-free conditions and upon PDGF-BB stimulation (Fig. 4 C), suggesting that dissimilar PDGF-BB-dependent proliferation and migration in ASMCs and FSMCs were not a consequence of distinct regulation of PDGFR-β expression. Down-regulation of PDGFR-β 9 h after PDGF-BB stimulation is consistent with the notion that binding of PDGF to its receptor leads to internalization and degradation of the ligand-receptor complex in endosomes (39Heldin C.H. Östman A. Rönnstrand L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1378: F79-F113PubMed Google Scholar). We next investigated the expression of the growth suppressor p27 in the same confluent cultures of ASMC and FSMC used for the PDGFR-β immunoblot. Of note, the lysis buffer used in these assays did not contain phosphatase inhibitors (buffer B). Both under mitogen-free conditions and at different time points after PDGF-BB stimulation, p27 was detected as a single band that was more abundant in confluent cultures of FSMCs versus ASMCs (Fig. 4 C). For example, whereas p27 was not detected in ASMC after 9 h of stimulation, FSMCs expressed more p27 at this time point than did unstimulated ASMCs. An analysis of subconfluent cultures also disclosed higher level of p27 expression in FSMCs (data not shown). We next examined cell lysates prepared in the presence of phosphatase inhibitors (buffer A), which also disclosed higher p27 expression in FSMCs versus ASMC (Fig. 4 D, top blot). Notably, these experiments demonstrated the presence of two p27-immunoreactive bands of different electrophoretic mobility and distinct relative abundance in these cells. Averaged over four experiments, the slower migrating band (open arrowhead) predominated in ASMCs (89.7% ± 8.0), whereas the faster migrating band (closed arrowhead) prevailed in FSMCs (95.7% ± 1.5). Western blot analysis using a phospho-specific antibody identified the slower migrating band as p27 phosphorylated on Thr-187 (Fig. 4 D, middle blot). This phosphorylation event is thought to initiate the major pathway for p27 proteolysis via a mechanism involving its ubiquitination and subsequent turnover in the proteasome (18Philipp-Staheli J. Payne S.R. Kemp C.J. Exp. Cell Res. 2001; 264: 148-168Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar). Consistent with this notion, immunoprecipitation experiments using an anti-ubiquitin antibody followed by Western blot analysis revealed the presence of ubiquitinated p27 in the slower migrating p27-immunoreactive band in both ASMCs and FSMCs (Fig. 4 E). It is noteworthy that the faster migrating p27-immnuoreactive band in ASMCs but not in FSMCs also contained ubiquitinated p27 (see “Discussion”). Collectively, these results suggest that the majority of p27 in ASMCs undergoes phosphorylation on Thr-187 and ubiquitination, whereas these post-translational modifications are detected only in a small fraction of p27 in FSMCs. We next investigated the effect of p27 overexpression on ASMC proliferation and migration by infecting these cells with retroviral vectors encoding for p27 (Rev-p27). Rev-p27-infected ASMCs disclosed a 3-fold increase in p27 expression, which caused a reduction in [3H]thymidine incorporation (Fig. 5 A) and migration (Fig. 5 B) as compared with control cultures infected with Rev-LacZ. These findings demonstrate that increased p27 express"

A synthetic peptide (residues 151–199) competed for binding of [35S]Pik1-(10–192) to bead-immobilized Frq1, whereas shorter peptides (164–199 and 174–199) did not. Correspondingly, a deletion mutant, Pik1(Δ152–191), did not co-immunoprecipitate efficiently with Frq1 and did not support growth at elevated temperature. Site-directed mutagenesis of Pik1-(10–192) suggested that recognition determinants lie over an extended region. Titration calorimetry demonstrated that binding of an 83-residue fragment, Pik1-(110–192), or the 151–199 peptide to Frq1 shows high affinity (K d ∼100 nm) and is largely entropic, consistent with hydrophobic interaction. Stoichiometry of Pik1-(110–192) binding to Frq1 was 1:1, as judged by titration calorimetry, by changes in NMR spectrum and intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence, and by light scattering. In cell extracts, Pik1 and Frq1 exist mainly in a heterodimeric complex, as shown by size exclusion chromatography. Cys-15 in Frq1 is notS-palmitoylated, as assessed by mass spectrometry; a Frq1(C15A) mutant and even a non-myristoylated Frq1(G2A,C15A) double mutant rescued the inviability of frq1Δ cells. This study defines the segment of Pik1 required for high affinity binding of Frq1.

This study defines the segment of Pik1 required for high affinity binding of Frq1. Recognition that phosphoinositides and inositol phosphates are key regulators of many processes in eukaryotic cells has brought increased attention to the enzymes that regulate the synthesis and turnover of these molecules (reviewed in Refs. 1Tolias K.F.

Of particular interest are the enzymes responsible for producing the various polyphosphoinositides situated on the cytosolic face of cellular membranes, which initiate several different signaling pathways by serving as highly specific recognition determinants for the selective recruitment of proteins to membranes (reviewed in Refs. 4Lemmon M.A. Ferguson K.M.

The first committed step in the synthesis of the polyphosphoinositide, phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate, is considered to be ATP-dependent phosphorylation of the hydrophilicmyo-inositol head group of phosphatidylinositol (PtdIns) 1The abbreviations used are: PtdIns, phosphatidylinositol; PtdIns 4-kinase, phosphatidylinositol 4-kinase; PI4Kβ, phosphatidylinositol 4-kinase beta isoform; PtdIns(4)P, phosphatidylinositol-4-phosphate; PI(4)P 5-kinase, phosphatidylinositol-4-phosphate 5-kinase; CEN , centromeric; Gal, galactose; GAP, GTPase-activating protein; GEF, guanine nucleotide exchange factor; Glc, glucose; HSQC, heteronuclear single-quantum coherence spectroscopy; K av, average retention coefficient; LKU, lipid kinase unique domain; mAb, monoclonal antibody; NCS, neuronal calcium sensor; NOE, nuclear Overhauser effect; NTA, nitrilotriacetate; Raf, raffinose; SC, synthetic complete medium; Suc, sucrose; ts, temperature-sensitive; Fmoc, N-(9-fluorenyl)methoxycarbonyl at thed-4 position by PtdIns 4-kinase (ATP:1-phosphatidyl-1D-myo-inositol 4-phosphotransferase, EC2.7.1.67) (reviewed in Refs. 11Balla T.

The resulting product, PtdIns(4)P, can be phosphorylated on the d-5 position by PtdIns(4)P 5-kinase to generate PtdIns(4,5)P2, PtdIns(4,5)P2 can be phosphorylated on the d-3 position by yet other lipid kinases, and the phosphoinositides so generated can be converted to other species by specific phosphatases and phospholipases (reviewed in Refs. 14Anderson R.A.

Chem. 1992; 267: 24117-24125Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and to have the corresponding gene cloned (19Flanagan C.A. Schnieders E.A. Emerick A.W. Kunisawa R. Admon A. Thorner J.

EMBO J. 1994; 13: 2352-2361Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar), was Pik1 from the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Thereafter, a second isoform, Stt4, which is the product of a discrete gene, was described (21Yoshida S. Ohya Y. Goebl M. Nakano A. Anraku Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 1166-1172Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Absence of either Pik1 or Stt4 is lethal, and overproduction of each protein cannot compensate for absence of the other, indicating that these enzymes participate in distinct cellular processes and generate discrete pools of PtdIns(4)P that are essential for yeast cell viability. Indeed, subsequent work has shown that, together, Pik1 and Stt4 account for all of the PtdIns(4)P generated in the yeast cell (22Audhya A. Foti M. Emr S.D. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 2673-2689Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar) and that Pik1 is required for vesicular trafficking in the late secretory pathway (23Hama H. Schnieders E.A. Thorner J.

Acta. 1998; 1436: 69-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar, 12Gehrmann T. Heilmeyer L.M.J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1998; 253: 357-370Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar, 28Fruman D.A. Meyers R.E. Cantley L.C. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 481-507Crossref PubMed Scopus (1319) Google Scholar). We have shown previously that Frq1, a small calcium-binding protein, co-purifies with Pik1 and is required for optimal activity of the enzyme (29Hendricks K.B. Wang B.Q. Schnieders E.A. Thorner J. Nat. Cell Biol. 1999; 1: 234-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar). Frq1 is the yeast ortholog of a protein called frequenin, first described in Drosophila (30Pongs O. Lindemeier J.

Members of a large subfamily of small, EF-hand-containing, calcium-binding proteins that includes frequenin (31Braunewell K.H. Gundelfinger E.D.

We have shown previously that Frq1 binds three Ca2+ (35Ames J.B. Hendricks K.B. Strahl T. Huttner I.G. Hamasaki N. Thorner J. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 12149-12161Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Available evidence indicates that frequenin/NCS-1 may also modulate PtdIns 4-kinase activity in animal cells (36Bourne Y. Dannenberg J. Pollmann V. Marchot P. Pongs O. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 11949-11955Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar, 37Zhao X. Varnai P. Tuymetova G. Balla A. Toth Z.E. Oker-Blom C. Roder J. Jeromin A. Balla T. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 40183-40189Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). Frq1, which is itself essential for the viability of yeast cells (29Hendricks K.B. Wang B.Q. Schnieders E.A. Thorner J. Nat. Cell Biol. 1999; 1: 234-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar), associates with membranes in a manner that depends on both theN-myristoyl group and conformational changes induced upon Ca2+ binding (35Ames J.B. Hendricks K.B. Strahl T. Huttner I.G. Hamasaki N. Thorner J. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 12149-12161Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Thus, in addition to its stimulation of enzymic activity, Frq1 may contribute to the optimal function of Pik1 by assisting with its membrane recruitment, because Pik1 itself lacks any obvious membrane-targeting motifs. Indeed prior work indicated thatN-myristoylation of Frq1 is important, but not essential, for its function (29Hendricks K.B. Wang B.Q. Schnieders E.A. Thorner J. Nat. Cell Biol. 1999; 1: 234-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar). In some Ca2+-binding regulatory proteins, in addition to the N-terminal myristoyl group, palmitoylation of a cysteine residue near the N terminus is also required for efficient membrane association (38Godsel L.M. Engman D.M. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 2057-2065Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar, 39Takimoto K. Yangi E.K. Conforti L. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 26904-26911Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Frq1 has only two Cys residues, one is near its N terminus and the other buried in the interior (35Ames J.B. Hendricks K.B. Strahl T. Huttner I.G. Hamasaki N. Thorner J. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 12149-12161Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). In this study, as a prelude to structural analysis to determine at atomic resolution how Frq1 recognizes Pik1, we have applied several independent methods to determine the affinity and stoichiometry of the Frq1-Pik1 interaction, used different approaches to delineate the sequences in Pik1 responsible for high affinity binding of Frq1 and utilized both biochemical and genetic techniques to explore the role, if any, of S-palmitoylation in the function of Frq1. Yeast strains used in this study are listed below in Table I. Standard rich (YP) and synthetic complete (SC) media (40Sherman F. Fink G.R. Hicks J.A.

Yeast was cultivated at 30 °C, unless otherwise noted. Conventional methods for DNA-mediated transformation and other genetic manipulations of yeast cells were used (41Guthrie C. Fink G.R.

Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar).Escherichia coli strain DH5α (43Hanahan D. J. Mol. Biol. 1983; 166: 557-580Crossref PubMed Scopus (8190) Google Scholar) was used for routine manipulation and propagation of plasmids. Unless otherwise indicated, all PCR reactions were performed using Pfu DNA polymerase (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). All recombinant plasmids were verified by dideoxy chain termination sequencing. Fragments of the N terminus of Pik1 were tagged with a C-terminal His6 tract and expressed in E. coli, as follows. pET23d–PIK1(10–192) was constructed by inserting via blunt-end ligation the HindIII fragment ofPIK1 into pET23d (Novagen, Madison, WI) that had been cleaved with NcoI and EcoRI. pET23d–PIK1(10–192, Δ31–79) was produced by cleaving pET23d–PIK1(10–192) with EcoRI andNcoI and religating the plasmid after filling in the recessed 3′-ends using Klenow fragment of E. coli DNA polymerase I. pET23d–PIK1(10–163) and pET23d–PIK1(10–125) were generated by PCR amplification of pET23d–PIK1(10–192) using as primers an oligonucleotide spanning the NcoI site of PIK1 and oligonucleotides introducing a NotI site 3′ to the sequences encoding, respectively, either codon 163 or codon 125 of thePIK1 open-reading-frame. The resulting PCR fragments were ligated into pET23d–PIK1(10–192) that had been cleaved with NcoI and NotI. AnXbaI-XhoI fragment of pET23d–PIK1(10–192) was inserted into Litmus28 (New England BioLabs, Beverly, MA) cleaved with the same enzymes, to generate the cloning intermediate, Litmus28–PIK1(10–192). Litmus28–pik1(10–192; P181A,V183A) and Litmus28–pik1(10–192; L175A,P181A,V183) were generated by exchanging the TfiI fragment in Litmus28–PIK1(10–192) with TfiI-digested PCR products carrying the appropriate substitutions, which were introduced by site-directed mutagenesis using a commercial kit (QuikChange, Stratagene, La Jolla, CA), according to the manufacturer's instructions. The XbaI-XhoI fragments from Litmus28–pik1(10–192; P181A,V183A) and Litmus28–pik1(10–192; L175A,P181A,V183) were then transferred back into pET23d that had been cleaved with XbaI and XhoI, to generate pET23d–pik1(10–192; P181A,V183A) and pET23d–pik1(10–192; L175A,P181A,V183). A PCR product carrying the appropriate substitutions and a XhoI site 3′ to sequences encoding residue 192 of Pik1, all introduced by site-directed mutagenesis, was cleaved with EcoRI and XhoI and inserted into the corresponding sites of pET23d–PIK1(10–192), yielding pET23d–pik1(10–192; R188A,R189A). pET23d–pik1(10–192; E154A,N155A,V156A,P158A) was constructed using a three-way ligation strategy, as follows. pET23d–PIK1(10–192) was cleaved with EcoRI andPstI and ligated with a PCR product (carrying the appropriate substitutions to produce E154A, N155A, and V156A) that had been cleaved with EcoRI and PvuII and a second PCR product (carrying the appropriate substitutions to produce N155A, V156A, and P158A) cleaved with PvuII andPstI. pET23d-FRQ1 has been described previously (29Hendricks K.B. Wang B.Q. Schnieders E.A. Thorner J. Nat. Cell Biol. 1999; 1: 234-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar, 35Ames J.B. Hendricks K.B. Strahl T. Huttner I.G. Hamasaki N. Thorner J.

Multicopy (2-μm, DNA-based) URA3-marked plasmids, YEp352-FRQ1, YEp352-GAL-FRQ1, and YEp352-FRQ1(G2A) have been described previously (29Hendricks K.B. Wang B.Q. Schnieders E.A. Thorner J. Nat. Cell Biol. 1999; 1: 234-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar). YEp352-GAL-FRQ1-(His) 6 was constructed by excising the corresponding fragment from pET23d-FRQ1-(His) 6(29Hendricks K.B. Wang B.Q. Schnieders E.A. Thorner J. Nat. Cell Biol. 1999; 1: 234-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar) and inserting it into YEp352-GAL (44Benton B.M. Eng W.-K. Dunn J.J. Studier F.W. Sternglanz R. Fisher P.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 353-360Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). YEp352-FRQ1(G2A,C15A) was generated by replacing anHindIII-BglII fragment of YEp352FRQ1(G2A) with a PCR product, carrying the appropriate mutations to encode C15A, that was digested with the same enzymes. The low copy (CEN-based) URA3-marked plasmid, pRS316-FRQ1(G2A,C15A), was generated by inserting an EcoRI fragment from YEp352-FRQ1(G2A,C15A) into pRS316-FRQ1 (29Hendricks K.B. Wang B.Q. Schnieders E.A. Thorner J. Nat. Cell Biol. 1999; 1: 234-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar). Construction of the TRP1-markedCEN plasmids, RS314-PIK1, pRS314-GAL1,10, and pRS314-GAL-mycPIK is described elsewhere (45Schnieders E.A. Biochemical and Genetic Analysis of a Phosphatidylinositol 4-Kinase (the PIK1 Gene Product) in the Yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae.Ph.D. thesis. University of California at Berkeley, Berkeley, CA1996Google Scholar). The cloning intermediate, Litmus28-PIK1, was produced by inserting aBamHI-SacI fragment containing the entire coding sequence of PIK1, excised from pRS314-PIK1, into Litmus28. Litmus28PIK1(Δ152–191) was generated by insertion of a PCR-derived HindIII fragment, encoding residues 10–151 of Pik1, into Litmus28-PIK1, that had been cleaved with HindIII. pRS314-PIK1(Δ152–191) was produced by subcloning the EcoRI fragment of Litmus28-PIK1(Δ152–191) into pRS314-PIK1. Inserting the BamHI-SacI fragment of pRS314-PIK1(Δ152–191) into pRS314-GAL1,10 generated pRS314-GAL-PIK1(Δ152–191). pRS314-GAL-mycPIK1(Δ152–191) was constructed by replacing the NcoI-SacI fragment of pRS314-GAL-mycPIK1 with the corresponding fragment from pRS314-GAL-PIK1(Δ152–191). Vectors for in vitroproduction of mRNA were constructed, as follows. A fragment containing the FRQ1 coding sequence, generated by PCR and containing an NcoI site overlapping the translation initiation codon and a BamHI site introduced 3′ to the stop codon, was inserted into pBAT4 (46Peranen J. Rikkonen M. Hyvonen M. Kaariainenen L. Anal. Biochem. 1996; 236: 371-373Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar), which had been cleaved withNcoI and BamHI, yielding pBAT4–FRQ1. A PCR fragment was amplified from pET23d–PIK1(10–192)using appropriate primers to introduce a SmaI site 5′ to the coding sequence and a HindIII site 3′ to codon 192 of thePIK1 open reading frame, cleaved with SmaI andHindIII, and ligated into pBAT4 that had been cleaved with the same enzymes, generating pBAT4–PIK1(10–192).35S-Labeled proteins were produced by coupled in vitro transcription and translation in the presence of [35S]Met and [35S]Cys (PerkinElmer Life Sciences, Boston, MA) using the TnTTM coupled reticulocyte lysate system (Promega, Madison, WI), according to the manufacturer's instructions. Translation mixtures were clarified by centrifugation (10 min, 4 °C) at maximum speed in a microcentrifuge. If not used immediately, the resulting supernatant fractions were mixed with an equal volume of glycerol and stored at −20 °C. The Pik1 and Frq1 constructs containing a C-terminal His6 tag were expressed in E. coli strain BL21(DE3) (Novagen, Madison, WI) and purified using Ni2+-saturated NTA-agarose (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) under denaturing conditions according to the manufacturer's specifications. To confirm their identity and purity, proteins recovered by binding to Ni2+-saturated NTA-agarose were resolved by SDS-PAGE and visualized by staining with Coomassie Brilliant Blue and by immunoblotting. Protein concentration was determined by the dye-binding method of Bradford (47Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (216412) Google Scholar) using a commercial kit (Bio-Rad, Inc., Hercules, CA) with bovine serum albumin as the standard. Protease-deficient strain, BJ2168 (Table I), transformed with YEp352-GAL-FRQ1-(His) 6, was grown in SC-Raf lacking uracil at 30 °C to mid-exponential phase and induced by addition of Gal (2% final concentration). After incubation for 6 h at 30 °C, cells were collected by centrifugation and resuspended in an equal volume of distilled water. The cell suspension was frozen by dripping into liquid nitrogen, and the resulting pellets were crushed with a pestle in a precooled mortar. The resulting frozen cell powder was dissolved in lysis buffer (5 mm imidazole, 145 mm NaCl, 50 mm Na-PO4 (pH 7.5); 20 ml/liter yeast culture) containing a mixture of protease inhibitors (CompleteTM, Promega, Madison, WI). The crude lysate was clarified by centrifugation at maximum rpm in a microcentrifuge at 4 °C for 15 min and then at 72,000 × g for 90 min in a L8–80M ultracentrifuge (Beckman-Coulter Inc., Fullerton, CA). The resulting supernatant fraction was then applied to a Ni2+-saturated NTA-agarose column (1.5-ml bed volume) that had been pre-equilibrated with three volumes of lysis buffer. After washing with 10 bed volumes of lysis buffer and 6 volumes of wash buffer (20 mm imidazole, 145 mm NaCl, 50 mm Na-PO4 (pH 7.5)), the bound Frq1-His6 was eluted with 3 volumes of elution buffer (120 mm imidazole, 145 mm NaCl, 50 mmNa-PO4 (pH 7.5)). The eluate was concentrated by ultrafiltration through an anisotropic membrane (3-kDa cut-off, Centricon YM-3, Amicon, Beverly, MA) until a final concentration of 0.5 μg/ml was reached. To confirm identity and purity, the resulting fraction was resolved by SDS-PAGE and visualized by staining with Coomassie Brilliant Blue and by immunoblotting. Prior to use, Ni2+-saturated NTA-agarose beads used in protein binding and peptide competition experiments were pre-blocked by incubation for 30 min in 8 volumes of buffer A (10 mm imidazole, 100 mm NaCl, 1 μm CaCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4)) containing 5 mg/ml ovalbumin at room temperature. All in vitro binding assays were carried out at 4 °C. Radiolabeled Frq1, prepared by coupled in vitro transcription and translation, was mixed with an equal volume of a slurry of pre-blocked Ni2+-saturated NTA-agarose beads in buffer A and incubated on a roller drum for 30 min. The beads and any nonspecifically bound radioactivity were removed by brief sedimentation in a microcentrifuge, and the resulting pre-cleared supernatant fraction was collected. Aliquots (400 μl) of the pre-cleared fraction were mixed either with 40 μl of pre-blocked Ni2+-saturated NTA-agarose beads, as a control for background binding, or with Ni2+-saturated NTA-agarose beads on which had been immobilized Pik1-(10–192)-(His)6 or its deletion derivatives (30 μg of protein/40 μl of beads) and incubated for 1 h on a rollerdrum. The beads were collected by centrifugation for 15 s in a microcentrifuge and washed three times with buffer A. Bound proteins were eluted from the beads in 50 μl of buffer A containing 300 mm imidazole, and samples of the resulting eluate were resolved by SDS-PAGE on a 12% gel and visualized by autoradiography. Synthetic peptides corresponding to Pik1-(174–199), Pik1-(164–199), and Pik1-(151–199) were prepared by standard solid phase peptide synthesis (using Fmoc chemistry) on an automated synthesizer (Model ABI 431A, PerkinElmer Life Sciences-Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA), purified by high-performance liquid chromatography, and confirmed by electrospray ionization mass spectrometry. A slurry (30 μl), of either pre-blocked Ni2+-saturated NTA-agarose beads or the same beads pre-coated to saturation with purified Frq1-His6, was mixed with 500 μl of 2×-concentrated buffer A, 290 μl of H2O, and 100 μl of either an aqueous solution of the indicated peptide in 10% acetonitrile or H2O containing 10% acetonitrile as a control. After preincubation of the samples on a roller drum for 30 min, 80 μl of35S-labeled Pik1-(10–192), produced by coupled in vitro transcription and translation, was added to each tube, and the mixture was incubated for a further 1.5 h. The beads were collected by sedimentation in a microcentrifuge and washed twice with buffer A. Bead-bound radioactivity was solubilized by boiling in SDS-PAGE sample buffer (48Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207218) Google Scholar), and the resulting eluate was subjected to SDS-PAGE. The species corresponding to [35S]Pik1-(10–192) was quantitated using a PhosphorImagerTM (Amersham Biosciences, Sunnyvale, CA). At each peptide concentration, the amount of radioactivity bound nonspecifically to empty beads was subtracted from the amount of radioactivity bound to the beads coated with Frq1-His6. 15N-Labeled and unlabeled samples of unmyristoylated Frq1 were prepared as described previously (35Ames J.B. Hendricks K.B. Strahl T. Huttner I.G. Hamasaki N. Thorner J. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 12149-12161Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Chemical synthesis of the 49-residue synthetic peptide corresponding to residues 151–199 of Pik1 was described in the preceding section. Using PCR with appropriate primers, an 83-residue segment from the N terminus of Pik1 consisting of residues 110–192, Pik1-(110–192), was tagged at its C terminus with an His6tract, inserted as an NcoI-XhoI fragment into the corresponding sites in the vector, pET23d, and expressed in E. coli strain BL21(DE3), as described above; in this construct, the Pik1-derived sequence is preceded by a 2-residue leader (Met-Ala-). Pik1-(110–192)-(His)6 was produced primarily in inclusion bodies, which were solubilized using 6 m guanidine hydrochloride (49Wingfield P.T. Palmer I. Liang S.M. Coligan J.E. Current Protocols in Protein Science. 1. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York, NY1995: 6.5.1-6.5.27Google Scholar) and purified using Ni2+-saturated NTA-agarose chromatography, essentially as described above. Samples for NMR analysis were prepared by dissolving 15N-labeled Frq1 (0.4 mm) with various amounts (0, 1, or 2 molar equiv"

In addition, the S-region transcripts generate globular forms and are assembled on the template DNA into a large aggregate that may stall replication and increase the recombinogenicity of the S-region DNA. Two subsequent DNA recombination steps are involved in immunoglobulin (Ig) production (1Manis J.P. Tian M. Alt F.W. Trends Immunol. 2002; 23: 31-39Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar, 2Honjo T. Kinoshita K. Muramatsu M. Annu. Rev.

First, V(D)J recombination assembles the V, D, and J segments into a variable region exon and contributes to the diversification of antigen-binding sites. Second, class switch recombination (CSR) 1The abbreviations used are: CSR, class switch recombination; CH, constant region of IgH; S-region, switch region; AFM, atomic force microscope 1The abbreviations used are: CSR, class switch recombination; CH, constant region of IgH; S-region, switch region; AFM, atomic force microscope converts the constant (CH) region of the immunoglobulin heavy chain (IgH) from Cμ to other classes and alters physiological functions that differ in their properties of complement fixation, binding to class-specific Fc receptors, and polymerization. Thus, class switching is a mechanism for diversifying Ig effector functions with the same antigen specificity. The mouse IgH locus of the IgM-expressing B lymphocyte contains a rearranged V(D)J exon and 8 CH exons of the following organization: 5′-V(D)J-Cμ-Cδ-Cγ3-Cγ1-Cγ2b-Cγ2a-Cε-Cα-3′. CSR is initiated by DNA breakage in the S-region featuring tandem repetitive nucleotide sequences that are located upstream of each CHexon except for the Cδ exon. In the case of CSR from IgM to IgE, DNA breakage initially occurs in both Sμ and Sε and results in deletion of the intervening region containing the Cμ to Cγ2a exons, and religation of Sμ and Sε causes juxtaposition of the V(D)J exon and the Cε exon. Despite the recent discovery of the activation-induced deaminase (AID) as an indispensable factor for CSR (2Honjo T. Kinoshita K. Muramatsu M. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2002; 20: 165-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (506) Google Scholar, 4Muramatsu M. Kinoshita K. Fagarasan S. Yamada S. Shinkai Y. Honjo T. Cell. 2000; 102: 553-563Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2692) Google Scholar), the molecular mechanism of CSR still remains elusive. In particular, the initiation step of DNA cleavage is completely unknown. Previous studies have revealed that the generation of germline transcripts from the sites upstream of each S-region is a prerequisite for CSR, and the higher order DNA structure involving S-region RNAs that are spliced out from the primary transcripts has been proposed as a critical factor for CSR (1Manis J.P. Tian M. Alt F.W. Trends Immunol. 2002; 23: 31-39Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar, 5Stavnezer J. Curr. Top. Microbiol.

Moreover, biochemical studies, including an agarose gel analysis, suggested that a persistent RNA/DNA hybrid is formed between S-region transcripts and its template DNA (8Reaban M.E. Griffin J.A. Nature. 1990; 348: 342-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar, 9Daniels G.A. Lieber M.R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 5006-5011Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar, 10Reaban M.E.

Chem. 2000; 275: 24163-24172Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). Thus, the S-region RNA may be catalytically involved in DNA breakage and CSR, and the characterization of the RNA/DNA hybrid may be critical for the understanding of CSR. However, the precise structure and the physical characteristic of both the RNA/DNA hybrid and the S-region RNA are not yet fully established. To directly determine the potential role and the physical characteristic of both the S-region transcript and the RNA/DNA hybrid at the single molecular level, we examined the S-region RNA transcribedin vitro using an atomic force microscope (AFM) (12Ushiki T. Hitomi J. Ogura S. Umemoto T. Shigeno M. Arch. Histol. Cytol. 1996; 59: 421-431Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). This approach revealed the specific characteristic of the nascent S-region transcript and the higher order structure of the RNA/DNA hybrid at the single molecular level. The pGD231 plasmid, a generous gift from M. Lieber (9Daniels G.A. Lieber M.R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 5006-5011Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar), contains an immunoglobulin Sγ3-region DNA (2.2 kb) in a pBSKS vector (Stratagene). Standard reactions were carried out using a RiboProbe in vitro transcription system (Promega). Briefly, the pGD231 plasmid DNA (1 μg) was transcribed with 10 units of T3 or T7 RNA polymerase in 40 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.9), 10 mm NaCl, 6 mm MgCl2, 10 mm dithiothreitol, 2 mm spermidine, 0.05% Tween 20, 20 units of recombinant ribonuclease inhibitor, and 0.5 mm each of rATP, rGTP, rCTP, and rUTP in a volume of 20 μl for 1 h at 37 °C. Reactions were stopped by heat inactivation for 20 min at 65 °C. Some samples were incubated with 1 μg of RNase A (Wako, Osaka, Japan) for an additional 30 min at 37 °C. Where indicated, 2 units of RNase H (Toyobo, Osaka, Japan) were added. Samples for AFM analysis were purified with MicroSpin S-400 HR columns (Amersham Biosciences). Unless otherwise specified, all samples were subjected to phenol/chloroform extraction and ethanol precipitation and suspended in TE buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.9, and 1 mm EDTA). Samples were diluted in 10 mmTris-HCl (pH 7.9) and 1 mm NaCl to 1 ng/μl DNA concentration. 5 μl of each solution was deposited onto the center of a freshly cleaved mica disk. Just before deposition, the sample solution was supplied with MgCl2 to a final concentration of 2.5 mm. After 5 min, the mica was blown dry with compressed air. To remove salts on the mica surface, 10 μl of distilled water was dropped on the mica followed immediately by a quick blow for drying. This rinsing step was repeated twice. AFM studies were performed using the SPM-400 scanning probe microscope controlled by an SPI 3700 probe station (Seiko Instruments). This microscope was equipped with a piezo translator with maximum x-yscan range of 20 μm width and a z range of 1.2 μm. The cantilevers used were rectangular, with a force constant of 35–40n m−1 and a resonance frequency of 320–400 kHz (SI-DF40, Seiko Instruments). Unless otherwise specified, all images were obtained as height mode images in a dynamic force mode in the air at room temperature. The resonance frequency shift was measured using the slope detection method at a slightly higher frequency of the cantilever than its resonance frequency. To confirm previous results (8Reaban M.E. Griffin J.A. Nature. 1990; 348: 342-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar, 9Daniels G.A. Lieber M.R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 5006-5011Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar, 10Reaban M.E. Lebowitz J. Griffin J.A. J. Biol.

Chem. 2000; 275: 24163-24172Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar), we examined the conformational change of the plasmid (pGD231, Fig. 1 A) containing an immunoglobulin Sγ3-region DNA after inducing Sγ3-region transcription on either strand of the DNA. The guanine-rich (G-rich) sense RNA and the cytosine-rich (C-rich) antisense RNA were transcribed by T7 and T3 RNA polymerases, respectively. Thereafter, free RNA was digested with RNase A. Consistent with the previous report (9Daniels G.A. Lieber M.R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 5006-5011Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar), almost all of the plasmids transcribed with T7 RNA polymerase migrated slowly in an electrophoretic gel as smears (Fig. 1 B, lane 3), but those transcribed with T3 RNA polymerase migrated normally as supercoiled plasmids (Fig. 1 B, lane 1). Treatment with RNase H, which specifically degrades the RNA in the RNA/DNA hybrid, restored those plasmids transcribed with T7 RNA polymerase to their original mobility (Fig. 1 B, lane 4). These results suggest that the sense RNA, but not the antisense RNA transcribed from the Sγ3 region, forms the RNA/DNA hybrid and is responsible for the mobility shift. However, from results of this analysis, it was not sufficiently clear whether the mobility shift is caused by the conformational change of the plasmids or merely by the added molecular weight of the associated transcripts. To visualize a possible conformational change of the pGD231 plasmid at single molecular resolution, the same samples used in the agarose gel analysis were subjected to AFM analysis after purification by phenol/chloroform extraction and ethanol precipitation. As clearly seen in Fig. 1 C, plasmids treated with T3 RNA polymerase formed the supercoiled structure (left panel), but those treated with T7 RNA polymerase formed the relaxed open circle structure to various extents (right panel). These data clearly indicate that the sense RNA transcribed from the S-region forms a persistent hybrid with its substrate DNA and relaxes its conformation, which may represent a phenomenon known as chromatin opening. Chromatin opening in the S-region, despite the lack of direct evidence, is proposed as the initial step for the access of some endonucleases to this region in CSR (1Manis J.P. Tian M. Alt F.W. Trends Immunol. 2002; 23: 31-39Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar, 3Stavnezer J. Adv. Immunol. 1996; 61: 79-146Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 5Stavnezer J. Curr. Top. Microbiol. Immunol. 2000; 245: 127-168PubMed Google Scholar). In the course of the purification of the RNA/DNA hybrid, we found that a cation and some salt is indispensable for establishing and maintaining this hybrid. In our in vitro transcription, the standard buffer contains spermidine, a trivalent cation at normal cellular pH. Spermidine is one of the polyamines (putrescine, spermidine, and spermine) and is known to be critical for cell cycle progression and induction of nucleic acid and protein syntheses (13Igarashi K. Kashiwagi K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 271: 559-564Crossref PubMed Scopus (729) Google Scholar). Polyamines are also known to preferentially bind to the GC-rich region of RNA and to change its structure (13Igarashi K. Kashiwagi K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 271: 559-564Crossref PubMed Scopus (729) Google Scholar). We found that spermidine at a physiological concentration in a reaction significantly increases the extent of RNA/DNA hybrid formation (Fig. 2,top panel) without affecting total RNA production (bottom panel). Furthermore, the purified RNA/DNA complex was found to be unstable in water, and the addition of some salt increased its stability (data not shown). These results suggest that the formation and maintenance of the RNA/DNA hybrid is regulated by spermidine and some salt. Biochemical studies have suggested that the S-region RNA/DNA hybrid forms a structure called R-loop, a protrusion of a non-template DNA strand as a result of RNA/DNA hybridization (10Reaban M.E. Lebowitz J. Griffin J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 21850-21857Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 11Tian M. Alt F.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 24163-24172Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). The single-stranded region of the R-loop is supposed to serve as a substrate for some endonucleases that may cause DNA cleavage and subsequent recombination. To inspect the RNA/DNA hybrid without the helical stress from the double-stranded circular DNA, we digested the plasmid with SacI or KpnI, and then subjected the linearized plasmid to in vitro transcription and AFM analysis (Fig. 3 A). However, we did not detect any visible alteration in structure, including an R-loop, by the transcription on either strand (Fig. 3 B,top panels). Possibly, the R-loop collapsed and clamped onto the nascent RNA, forming an intramolecular triplex as suggested by Reaban et al. (10Reaban M.E. Lebowitz J. Griffin J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 21850-21857Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and/or the R-loop is too small to be visualized using AFM. To detect RNA/DNA hybrid formation in a linear plasmid, we incubated the purified sample with RNase H. As mentioned above, RNase H specifically degrades the RNA in the RNA/DNA hybrid, and this catalytic activity requires Mg2+. Therefore, RNase H is supposed to maintain its association with the nascent RNA of the RNA/DNA hybrid in the absence of Mg2+. After incubation with RNase H without MgCl2, we detected some aggregation on each T7 (but not T3) RNA polymerase-treated DNA (Fig. 3 B, bottom panels). Also, the apparent length of the linear DNA in the T7 RNA polymerase-treated sample became shorter, and the aggregation was often associated with DNA loop or branch formation. These data suggest that the sense S-region RNA actually forms a persistent hybrid with the template DNA and that the binding of RNase H to each hybrid facilitates the secondary structure formation. In the above experiments, we used RNase A-treated samples to eliminate the nonhybridized free RNA. We next sought to determine the physical properties of the free S-region RNA transcribed in the sense or antisense direction. Thus, the in vitro transcribed samples were subjected to AFM analysis without RNase A treatment (Fig. 4). We visualized RNA molecules and identified a clear difference between the sense and antisense RNAs. An elongated form of the antisense RNA, possibly forming an intramolecular secondary structure, was released from the substrate DNA (Fig. 4,left T3 panels). In contrast, the sense RNA formed a large aggregate (Fig. 4, right T7 panels). The RNA/DNA hybrid examined in Fig. 3was supposed to serve as a core of this aggregate. The height profiles of the RNA, DNA, and RNA/DNA molecules are shown in the bottom panel of Fig. 4. The largest height of the right side T7 panel (∼3.3 nm) was significantly greater than that of the left side T3 panel (∼1.3 nm) or the height of the double-stranded DNA (∼0.4 nm). The large aggregate of the RNA/DNA complex consisted of small globular molecules, which was evident from the phase mode image (Fig. 5,right panel). Interestingly, several DNA fragments were linked via this aggregate (Fig. 5), raising a possibility that the RNA aggregate functions as an anchor for synapsing two S-region DNAs. From these results, we propose that the S-region RNA, transcribed in the sense direction, forms a persistent hybrid with the template DNA, as well as a globular form, and forms a large complex with other RNA molecules to juxtapose the other S-region DNAs.Figure 5Synapsed DNA fragments via a large aggregate composed of small globular sense RNA molecules. Left panel, height mode image. Right panel, phase mode image. Scale bars, 200 nm.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Here, we show the novel physical property of the in vitro transcribed S-region RNA by direct visualization using an AFM. The S-region sense RNA, but not the antisense RNA, forms a persistent hybrid with the template plasmid DNA and changes the plasmid conformation from supercoil to open circle in the presence of spermidine. In addition, the S-region transcripts generate globular forms and are assembled on the template DNA into a large aggregate. The globular form and the large RNA/DNA complex formed by the sense S-region RNA are intriguing, because nucleic acids are negatively charged, and electric repulsion should have an adverse effect on the aggregation. Several possibilities might explain the aggregation. One possibility is that some cations can neutralize the negative charge. As mentioned earlier, spermidine, a trivalent cation in solution, is indispensable for the S-region RNA/DNA hybrid formation (Fig. 2), and the addition of salt also increases the stability of the purified RNA/DNA hybrid (data not shown). Thus, neutralization of a charge by a cation may be indispensable for the generation of the globular RNA or RNA/DNA complex. Another possibility is that the unique structure of the S-region might facilitate the aggregate formation. Two possible structures might be critical for this phenomenon. One is a four-stranded structure (G4-DNA) in which G-rich DNA strands are linked by a Hoogsteen-bonded guanine quartet (14Sen D. Gilbert W. Nature. 1990; 344: 410-414Crossref PubMed Scopus (686) Google Scholar, 15Dempsey L.A. Sun H. Hanakahi L.A. Maizels N. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 1066-1071Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). G-rich RNA strands may be linked in the same manner and form G4-RNA and/or G4-RNA/DNA. The second is the stem-loop structure generated from palindromic sequences of the S-region, which has recently been proposed as a possibility because of its role in CSR (2Honjo T. Kinoshita K. Muramatsu M. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2002; 20: 165-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (506) Google Scholar, 16Tashiro J. Kinoshita K. Honjo T. Int. Immunol. 2001; 13: 495-505Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Further analysis of the sequence requirement for the complex formation will verify these possibilities. What is the physiological role of this RNA/DNA complex in CSR? We propose the following possibilities. 1) The RNA/DNA complex maintains the S-region of the IgH gene open, as shown in Fig. 1 C, which facilitates the access of some endonucleases and CSR machinery. 2) This complex serves as an anchor for synapsing S-region RNA/DNA complexes, as shown in Fig. 4, which is a critical step in CSR. 3) This complex stalls the movement of the replication fork, which may also create a target for some endonucleases. It was reported previously that some repetitive sequences become highly recombinogenic by stalling the replication fork with their transcription and that a stable higher order structure of DNA and RNA, despite the lack of direct evidence, is the cause of the stalling (17Krasilnikova M.M. Samadashwily G.M. Krasilnikov A.S. Mirkin S.M. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 5095-5102Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Our data directly showed that the RNA/DNA complex at repetitive sequences causes such a higher order structure, which may well explain the replication-coupled recombination of repetitive sequences. This is particularly relevant in CSR, because several reports have suggested the correlation between CSR and replication (5Stavnezer J. Curr. Top. Microbiol. Immunol. 2000; 245: 127-168PubMed Google Scholar, 18Lundgren M. Strom L. Bergquist L.O. Skog S. Heiden T. Stavnezer J. Severinson E. Eur. J. Immunol. 1995; 25: 2042-2051Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar) and the increased level of spermidine, a critical factor for the RNA/DNA hybrid, in cells entering replication (19Bettuzzi S. Davalli P. Astancolle S. Pinna C. Roncaglia R. Boraldi F. Tiozzo R. Sharrard M. Corti A. FEBS Lett. 1999; 446: 18-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Here, at the single-molecular level, we showed the unique physical characteristics of S-region transcripts that may be crucial for CSR. A similar intron-delivered repetitive RNA may be important in various aspects of cellular functions. We thank M. R. Lieber for the pGD231 plasmid and T. Kawai and H.

https://openalex.org/W2070923794,"There are significant isoform differences between the skeletal and cardiac troponin complexes. Studies of the regulatory properties of these proteins have previously shown only significant differences in the calcium dependence of their regulation. Using a sensitive myosin subfragment 1 (S1) binding assay we show that in the presence of calcium, thin filaments reconstituted with either skeletal or cardiac troponin produce virtually identical S1 binding curves. However in the absence of calcium the S1 binding curves differ considerably. Combined with kinetic measurements, curve fitting to the three-state thin filament regulatory model shows the main difference is that calcium produces a 4-fold change inK T (the closed-open equilibrium) for the skeletal system but little change in the cardiac system. The results show a significant difference in the range of regulatory effect between the cardiac and skeletal systems that we interpret as effects upon actin-troponin (Tn)I-TnC binding equilibria. As structural data show that the Ca2+-bound TnC structures differ, the additional counter-intuitive result here is that with respect to myosin binding the +Ca2+ state of the two systems is similar whereas the −Ca2+ state differs. This shows the regulatory tuning of the troponin complex produced by isoform variation is the net result of a complex series of interactions among all the troponin components. There are significant isoform differences between the skeletal and cardiac troponin complexes. Studies of the regulatory properties of these proteins have previously shown only significant differences in the calcium dependence of their regulation. Using a sensitive myosin subfragment 1 (S1) binding assay we show that in the presence of calcium, thin filaments reconstituted with either skeletal or cardiac troponin produce virtually identical S1 binding curves. However in the absence of calcium the S1 binding curves differ considerably. Combined with kinetic measurements, curve fitting to the three-state thin filament regulatory model shows the main difference is that calcium produces a 4-fold change inK T (the closed-open equilibrium) for the skeletal system but little change in the cardiac system. The results show a significant difference in the range of regulatory effect between the cardiac and skeletal systems that we interpret as effects upon actin-troponin (Tn)I-TnC binding equilibria. As structural data show that the Ca2+-bound TnC structures differ, the additional counter-intuitive result here is that with respect to myosin binding the +Ca2+ state of the two systems is similar whereas the −Ca2+ state differs. This shows the regulatory tuning of the troponin complex produced by isoform variation is the net result of a complex series of interactions among all the troponin components. troponin tropomyosin myosin subfragment 1 skeletal Tn cardiac Tn 4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acid protein phosphatase 2A In striated muscle, the troponin-tropomyosin (TnTm)1 complex functions as a calcium-dependent molecular switch that regulates the force-generating interaction between actin and myosin filaments. The calcium-induced change in tropomyosin-troponin structure is not simply a trigger for muscle contraction but produces a graded response to calcium that can modulate the speed and force of the contraction. The molecular mechanism of regulation is generally believed to be via steric blocking in which the position of Tm upon actin directly obstructs the binding of myosin to actin (reviewed in Refs. 1Farah C.S. Reinach F.C. Faseb J. 1995; 9: 755-767Crossref PubMed Scopus (476) Google Scholar and 2Gordon A.M. Homsher E. Regnier M. Physiol. Rev. 2000; 80: 853-924Crossref PubMed Scopus (1340) Google Scholar). We use a variant of this regulatory model, the three-state model of McKillop and Geeves (3McKillop D.F. Geeves M.A. Biophys. J. 1993; 65: 693-701Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (663) Google Scholar, 4Maytum R. Lehrer S.S. Geeves M.A. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 1102-1110Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar), that represents the filament as existing in a dynamic equilibrium between three biochemically differentiable states. In this model the position of Tm is influenced both by allosteric changes in troponin in response to calcium binding and the binding of myosin to actin. This results in three biochemical states of the thin filament termed the blocked, closed, and open states, which correspond closely to three subsequently determined structural states (5Lehman W. Hatch V. Korman V. Rosol M. Thomas L. Maytum R. Geeves M.A. Van Eyk J.E. Tobacman L.S. Craig R. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 302: 593-606Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar): the B-state, where the Tm position precludes myosin binding to both strong and weak sites, the C-state, in which Tm is positioned so that myosin can attach to its weak ionic binding sites, and the M-state, induced by the rigor binding of myosin where Tm is further translated allowing access to the rigor binding sites. The ratio of the three states in the absence of S1 is defined by the equilibrium constants K B (between the B- and C-states) and K T (between the C- and M-states). The B-state has only been shown to be significantly occupied in the absence of Ca2+ when Tn is tightly bound to the filament. In the presence of Tn and Ca2+ or when Tn is absent there is little or no occupancy of the B-state meaningK B is large. Major questions remain about the specific roles of Tm and the three Tn components, TnC, TnI, and TnT. At a simple level we know that TnI is responsible for the formation of the B (blocked)-state by its binding to actin (6Greaser M.L. Gergely J. J. Biol. Chem. 1971; 246: 4226-4233Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). TnC, when it binds Ca2+, allosterically interferes with the TnI-actin interaction and releases the B-state (7Zot A.S. Potter J.D. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biophys. Chem. 1987; 16: 535-559Crossref PubMed Scopus (447) Google Scholar). TnT, through its structural role of tethering TnI and TnC to Tm, transmits the structural changes to the A7TmTn structural unit. TnT also influences the Tm-Tm communication along the filament via its interaction at the Tm-Tm overlap (8Schaertl S. Lehrer S.S. Geeves M.A. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 15890-15894Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar) and has been shown recently to also influence regulation directly. Our own work has shown the TnT1 fragment of skeletal TnT effects the open-closed equilibrium significantly reducingK T (9Maytum R. Geeves M.A. Lehrer S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 29774-29780Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar), whereas work on a similar cardiac TnT1 fragment has shown strong inhibition of the actin-activated myosin ATPase (10Tobacman L.S.

Fast skeletal (hereafter referred to as skeletal) and cardiac muscle show considerable differences between their troponin isoforms, the most significant of which are that cardiac TnC has only a single regulatory calcium binding site as opposed to two in skeletal TnC and that cardiac TnI has a 32-amino acid N-terminal extension containing two phosphorylation sites that have been shown to modulate the sensitivity to calcium (11Robertson S.P.

Ritchie M.D. Geeves M.A. FEBS Lett. 1996; 384: 43-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). TnT alternative splicing can produce over 20 different isoforms, mainly by changes in the N-terminal hypervariable region, suggesting a significant area for functional modulation, but the effects of these differences are currently largely unclear (14Perry S.V. J. Muscle Res. Cell Motil. 1998; 19: 575-602Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar). The regulatory properties of skeletal and cardiac troponins had been compared previously using kinetic measurements of S1 binding to reconstituted thin filaments to determine the occupancy of the B-state. This had shown little difference between them, with similar values ofK B (the B to C equilibrium) determined for both systems (3McKillop D.F. Geeves M.A. Biophys. J. 1993; 65: 693-701Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (663) Google Scholar, 4Maytum R. Lehrer S.S.

Biochem. 1995; 227: 694-699Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). In this study we combine both kinetic and equilibrium measurements to fully characterize the regulation of the binding of S1 to thin filaments containing both skeletal and cardiac troponins. We also examine the effect of the phosphorylation state of TnI, previously shown to effect the calcium dependence of regulation (12Zhang R. Zhao J. Potter J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 30773-30780Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar, 13Reiffert S.U. Jaquet K. Heilmeyer Jr., L.M. Ritchie M.D. Geeves M.A. FEBS Lett. 1996; 384: 43-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar) upon these measurements under saturating and calcium-free conditions. The results are analyzed, and the implications of the results are discussed in terms of the most recent version of the three-state model (4Maytum R. Lehrer S.S. Geeves M.A. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 1102-1110Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). Some of this work has been presented previously in a preliminary form (16Maytum R. Westerdorf B. Jaquet K. Geeves M.A. Biophys. J. 2000; 80: A87Google Scholar). The skTnTm complex, skTn, Tm, actin, and myosin were isolated from rabbit skeletal muscle. The skTnTm complex and skTn were obtained using the methods of Ebashi et al. (17Ebashi S. Wakabayashi T. Ebashi F. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1971; 69: 441-445Crossref PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar) and Greaser and Gergely (6Greaser M.L. Gergely J. J. Biol. Chem. 1971; 246: 4226-4233Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), respectively. Tropomyosin was isolated according to Smillie (18Smillie L.B. Methods Enzymol. 1982; 85: 234-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar). cTn and PP2A were isolated from bovine heart according to the method of Beier et al. (19Beier N. Jaquet K. Schnackerz K. Heilmeyer Jr., L.M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1988; 176: 327-334Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar) and Mumby et al.(20Mumby M.C. Russell K.L. Garrard L.J. Green D.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 6257-6265Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) respectively. S1 was prepared by chymotryptic digestion of rabbit myosin, as described by Weeds and Taylor (21Weeds A.G. Taylor R.S. Nature. 1975; 257: 54-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (931) Google Scholar). Actin, purified from rabbit skeletal muscle according to Spudich and Watt (22Spudich J.A. Watt S. J. Biol. Chem. 1971; 246: 4866-4871Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), was labeled at Cys-374 with N-(1-pyrene)iodacetamide according to Criddle et al. (23Criddle A.H. Geeves M.A. Jeffries T. Biochem. J. 1985; 232: 343-349Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). Phalloidin (Roche Molecular Biochemicals)-stabilized F-actin was made by incubating a solution of 10 μm pyrene-actin with 10 μm phalloidin overnight in standard experimental buffer (20 mm MOPS, pH 7.0, 200 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2) at 4 °C. SDS-PAGE of proteins was performed according to Laemmli (24Laemmli U. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207472) Google Scholar) using 13.5% acrylamide gels followed by staining with Coomassie Blue G-250. Bovine cardiac Tn (1 mg/ml) was preincubated in 20 mm MOPS, pH 7.0, 300 mm KCl, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm ATP for 5 min at 30 °C. The phosphorylation reaction was started by the addition of the recombinant catalytic subunit of protein kinase A (25Herberg F.W. Bell S.M. Taylor S.S. Protein Eng. 1993; 6: 771-777Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar) (60 milliunits/mg cTn) and was stopped by freezing after incubation for 120 min at 30 °C. To analyze the phosphorylation level an aliquot of the reaction mixture was applied onto a C4 reversed phase column to separate cTnI as described by Swiderek et al. (26Swiderek K. Jaquet K. Meyer H.E. Heilmeyer Jr., L.M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1988; 176: 335-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Isolated cTnI was dried in vacuo and redissolved in 9 m urea, 2% (v/v) servalyte, pH 3–10. Isoelectric focusing was performed as described by Ardelt et al. (27Ardelt P. Dorka P. Jaquet K. Heilmeyer Jr., L.M. Kortke H. Korfer R. Notohamiprodjo G. Biol. Chem. 1998; 379: 341-347Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). After staining the gel with Coomassie Blue the bands of de-, mono- and bisphosphorylated TnI were quantified by scanning densitometry using Whole Band software (Bioimage). For the titrations, a stock was made of 10 μm actin with 10 μm phalloidin added to stabilize the actin filaments. For each filament type (skeletal or cardiac) 2 nmol of the 10 μm actin/phalloidin stock (200 μl) was mixed with 8 nmol of Tm and Tn at their stock concentrations (around 20–40 μm, approx 200–400 μl) and incubated for 1 h at 4 °C. For thin filament assembly with cardiac troponin, troponin-containing bisphosphorylated cTnI (position 22 and 23 in the amino acid sequence) was used (13Reiffert S.U. Jaquet K. Heilmeyer Jr., L.M. Ritchie M.D. Geeves M.A. FEBS Lett. 1996; 384: 43-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). The phosphorylation degree was checked routinely by non-equilibrium isoelectric focusing. Dephosphorylated cardiac Tn filaments were produced as described below. The stocks were then diluted in standard experimental buffer to give final concentrations of 50 nmactin/phalloidin and 200 nm Tm/Tn in a volume of 2 ml. For the stopped-flow experiments thin filaments were pre-assembled by mixing stock solutions to final concentrations of 10 μmactin, 2 μm Tm, and 2 μm of the appropriate Tn in standard experimental buffer (20 mm MOPS, pH 7.0, 200 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2) and leaving to equilibrate for 10 min. An excess of regulatory proteins was present in all assays to ensure correct assembly. To dephosphorylate cTnI in the thin filament MnCl2 (final concentration of 5 mm) was added, along with 5 μl of PP2A stock. The solutions were then incubated overnight at 4 °C before use. To confirm cTnI dephosphorylation, a portion of thin filaments containing 22 μg of cTn was rephosphorylated in 20 mm MOPS, pH 7, 300 mm KCl, 2 mm dithiothreitol, with 1 mm (final concentration) [γ-32P]ATP (20 μCi), 3 mm MgCl2 by addition of 20 μl of 14 milliunits of protein kinase A catalytic subunit/μl (total volume of 100 μl). Aliquots of 5 μl were used to measure incorporation of radioactive 32P using a liquid scintillation counter. These were precipitated on filter papers and washed to remove unbound [γ-32P]ATP. The results were curve-fitted to determine the maximum level of phosphate incorporation. Stopped-flow experiments were performed at 20 °C with either a Hi-Tech Scientific SF-61 or SF-61DX2 spectrophotometer in fluorescence mode. For both this and the titration experiments, binding is monitored by the ∼70% quenching of the pyrene-actin fluorescence upon binding of the S1 to actin (15Head J.G. Ritchie M.D. Geeves M.A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 227: 694-699Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Pyrene fluorescence was excited at 365 nm, and emission was detected at right angles using a KV 389-nm cut-off filter (Schott, Mainz, Germany). Data were stored and analyzed using Kinetasyst software provided with the instrument. Transients shown are the average of three-five shots of the machine. In these experiments the concentrations quoted are those before mixing, the final concentrations being half those quoted for the stock solutions in the syringes. The occupancy of the B-state (defined byK B) has been determined using the kinetic method of McKillop and Geeves (3McKillop D.F. Geeves M.A. Biophys. J. 1993; 65: 693-701Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (663) Google Scholar) where the rate of binding of S1 to reconstituted filaments is measured under excess actin condition. Under these conditions the observed rate constant of binding (k obs) is proportional to the fraction of actin available for binding and is shown in Equation 1. The value ofK B is then defined from the ratio of the observed rate constant of S1 binding to reconstituted thin filaments in the presence and absence of calcium (3McKillop D.F. Geeves M.A. Biophys. J. 1993; 65: 693-701Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (663) Google Scholar). kobs=[A]k+1and−Ca2+kobs+Ca2+kobs≈KB1+KBEquation 1 Fluorescence was measured at 20 °C using a PerkinElmer Life Sciences 50B spectrofluorimeter exciting at 365 nm with a 10-nm bandwidth and measuring emission at 405 nm with a 15-nm bandwidth. Titrations were performed with a Harvard Apparatus syringe pump (4Maytum R. Lehrer S.S. Geeves M.A. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 1102-1110Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). The fraction of actin bound is directly proportional to the change in pyrene fluorescence measured. The titration curves were then fitted to the three-state model as described by Maytum et al. (4Maytum R. Lehrer S.S. Geeves M.A. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 1102-1110Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). This model is shown in Equation 2 and is defined by the following parameters: K 1 (binding to the A-state),K 2 (A to R isomerization),K T (the C to M equilibrium),K B (the B to C equilibrium), and n(the apparent number of actins being switched between states). Fitting of the binding curves was by a process of systematic variation ofn and examination of the sum of the residuals and specific deviations for each value as detailed previously (4Maytum R. Lehrer S.S. Geeves M.A. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 1102-1110Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). α=K1[M](KT(1+K2)Pn−1+Qn−1)KTPn+Qn+1/KBEquation 2 In Equation 2, α represents the fraction of total actin sites occupied, [M] is the concentration of free S1 heads,P = 1 + K 1[M](1 +K 2) and Q = 1 +K 1[M]. Fig. 1 shows the clear differences between all of the skeletal and cardiac Tn components (TnT, TnI, TnC) when resolved by SDS-PAGE. As the skeletal Tn used in this study was not prepared from a single specific muscle it might contain mixed isoforms of regulatory proteins. However, the only significant isoform variants present are the minor and major TnT isoforms that run above and below βTm, respectively (Fig. 1, lane 4). The control protein preparation does contain some residual actin. However equivalent titrations using purified skTn and Tm with no actin band present (data not shown) indicate that this actin is apparently inactive (probably unpolymerizable) and not effecting the assays. The cardiac preparations also appear to consist mainly of a single cTnT band running above βTm, a single band for cTnI significantly larger than skTnI, and one for cTnC running slightly below skTnC (Fig. 1,lane 5). Titration and kinetic experiments were repeated with several different batches of cTn, two of which are shown. No significant difference was found between different batches of cTn. Analysis by isoelectric focusing and subsequent scanning densitometry of cardiac Tn after careful treatment with protein kinase A to obtain predominantly bisphosphorylated cTnI showed that about 80% of the cTnI was bisphosphorylated (data not shown). This material was used for reconstitution of thin filaments. Dephosphorylated cTn thin filaments were obtained by treatment of phosphorylated filaments with PP2A as this has been shown previously (28Lohmann K. Westerdorf B. Maytum R. Geeves M.A. Jaquet K. Protein Expression Purif. 2001; 21: 49-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar) to produce better regulating filaments. Dephosphorylation of TnI by PP2A was confirmed by measuring incorporation of 32P by protein kinase A into dephosphorylated thin filaments (28Lohmann K. Westerdorf B. Maytum R. Geeves M.A. Jaquet K. Protein Expression Purif. 2001; 21: 49-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). Fig.2 A shows 32P incorporation into filaments containing cardiac troponin, dephosphorylated with PP2A. These were referenced against filaments reconstituted with recombinant cTnI (which has no phosphorylation when expressed in Escherichia coli). The “native” filaments incorporate around 1.8 mol of Pi per mol of TnI, which represents 90% of the maximum from the controls. Under these conditions nearly no unspecific incorporation of phosphate occurs. Protein kinase A binds phosphate specifically to the cTnI subunit at positions 22 and 23 (human sequence) or 23 and 24 (bovine sequence). Separation by SDS-PAGE showed only a single radioactive labeled cTnI band (not shown). Unspecific phosphorylation as described by Ward et al. (29Ward D.G. Ashton P.R. Trayer H.R. Trayer I.P. Eur. J. Biochem. 2001; 268: 179-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar) for cardiac troponin I is observed mainly when using individual subunits or different conditions. To estimate the extent of dephosphorylation of thin filaments by PP2A used in the experiments described here, these protein kinase A-phosphorylated 32P-labeled thin filaments were then dephosphorylated with PP2A. Fig. 2 B shows that the dephosphorylated thin filaments used for the following experiments contain around a residual 0.2 mol of phosphate/mol of TnI. The occupancy of the blocked B-state was determined from measurements of the rate of binding of S1 to reconstituted filaments at a 1:10 S1 to actin ratio. The ratio of the fitted k obs in the presence and absence of Ca2+ defines K B as per Equation 1(3McKillop D.F. Geeves M.A. Biophys. J. 1993; 65: 693-701Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (663) Google Scholar). Typical kinetic traces used to determine K Bfor cTn are shown in Fig. 3. The results are similar to those published previously (3McKillop D.F. Geeves M.A. Biophys. J. 1993; 65: 693-701Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (663) Google Scholar, 4Maytum R. Lehrer S.S. Geeves M.A. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 1102-1110Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar, 15Head J.G. Ritchie M.D. Geeves M.A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 227: 694-699Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar), showing a 3–4-fold reduction in k obs for the skeletal system in the absence of calcium and a 2–3-fold reduction for the cardiac system (13Reiffert S.U. Jaquet K. Heilmeyer Jr., L.M. Ritchie M.D. Geeves M.A. FEBS Lett. 1996; 384: 43-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar, 28Lohmann K. Westerdorf B. Maytum R. Geeves M.A. Jaquet K.

Biochem. 1999; 261: 40-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). TableI shows the K Bvalues determined from these rates, which are therefore similar (0.5 for skeletal and 0.7 for cardiac) but with a small reproducible difference between them. As the rate constants of S1 binding to actin in the presence of calcium were the same for both systems this means that the cardiac system is slightly less “off” than the skeletal system in the absence of calcium. These small differences may relate to fine tuning of the two regulatory systems for their specific physiological role or incomplete filament assembly as discussed later. No significant difference was found between cardiac filaments containing phosphorylated or dephosphorylated cTnI (13Reiffert S.U. Jaquet K. Heilmeyer Jr., L.M. Ritchie M.D. Geeves M.A. FEBS Lett. 1996; 384: 43-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar).Table IParameters for fits to titration and kinetic curvesK 1 (×105m−1s−1)K 2K TK BaK B values are those used for fitting, and values in parentheses indicate range from this and previous works.n bValues of n are given as a range of values to representing closest values from fitting.Skeletal −Ca (n = 3)1.0 (± 0.1)cThe quoted deviations are based upon those between fits of multiple datasets.

Individual fits do not generate meaningful statistics for variance of the fitted parameters producing values indicating less than 5% error. Open table in a new tab The overall switching of thin filaments into the open M-state was determined by the equilibrium S1 titration curves shown in Fig.4. Representative curves of S1 binding to filaments containing either skTn or phospho-cTn are shown in Fig.4 A. The binding curves were virtually identical in the presence of calcium (only a single curve fit is shown for clarity). However, the S1 binding curves obtained with skTn and cTn in the absence of calcium clearly differ significantly from each other. The overall shape of both curves is very similar but with the cTn curve positioned between the binding curves in the presence of calcium and the skTn curve in the absence of calcium. Curve fitting of the data gives values for the parameters as shown in Table I. The values forK 1, which together withK 2, define the overall S1 affinity (K 1·K 2) to actin, are similar for all the filaments, in the range of 1.0–1.1 × 105 s−1m−1.K 2 is fixed at the previously determined value of 200 for nucleotide-free S1 (3McKillop D.F. Geeves M.A. Biophys. J. 1993; 65: 693-701Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (663) Google Scholar). Within experimental error the skeletal data show at least a 3–4-fold change inK T from ∼0.12 in the presence of Ca2+ to ∼0.02 in its absence, in agreement with previous data (4Maytum R. Lehrer S.S. Geeves M.A. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 1102-1110Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). However, for the cardiac data a good fit is obtained withK T remaining unchanged at ∼0.13 in both the presence and absence of calcium. These results are expressed in terms of percentage occupancy of the three thin filament states in TableII, which shows that in the absence of calcium the cardiac system has significantly greater occupancy of both the C- and M-states.Table IIPercentage occupancy of states for cardiac and skeletal TnBlocked (B)Closed (C)Open (M)Skeletal −Ca66%33%<5%Cardiac −Ca50%40%10%Skeletal +Ca<5%75%20%Cardiac +Ca<5%75%20% Open table in a new tab Thus in the skeletal system the overall shift in the regulatory equilibria away from the M-state in the absence of calcium is the result of significant contributions from the changes in bothK B and K T. In contrast, there is a considerably smaller difference between the two calcium states for the cardiac system. Fitting shows this is the result ofK T being insensitive to calcium in the cardiac system, despite a similar occupancy of the B-state (K B ≈ 0.7 versus K B ≈ 0.5). Values for the apparent cooperative unit size (n) are similar for skeletal and cardiac Tn in both the presence and absence of calcium. In the absence of calcium both give a value of around 6–7, which we have suggested previously (4Maytum R. Lehrer S.S. Geeves M.A. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 1102-1110Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar) is because of the “pinning” effect of the TnI, bound strongly once every seven actins, dominating the cooperativity of the filament. In the presence of calcium both the skeletal and cardiac filaments show a similar large apparent cooperative unit size (n ≥ 11). It should be noted, however, that the curves produced in the presence of calcium have a low sigmoidicity, which occurs when n is large (n ≥ 10). The low sigmoidicity results in the values of both K T and n not being well determined (31Maytum R. Konrad M. Lehrer S.S. Geeves M.A. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 7334-7341Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar), so there may be some subtle isoform-related differences that are not detected by this experiment. However, the values for n are significantly higher than the values determined previously for Tm alone. This shows that cTn has a marked effect on n and a clear effect of the presence of Tn +Ca in both systems (4Maytum R. Lehrer S.S. Geeves M.A. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 1102-1110Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). For skeletal Tn it has been shown that the TnT subunit, specifically the TnT1 region, is responsible for increasing the thin filament cooperativity above that seen for Tm alone (from 7–8 to ≥11) (4Maytum R. Lehrer S.S. Geeves M.A. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 1102-1110Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar, 8Schaertl S. Lehrer S.S. Geeves M.A. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 15890-15894Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). From this, it appears that within the limitations of the data as stated above, the effect of cardiac TnT in increasing the apparent cooperativity is the same as that produced by skeletal TnT. The effects of cTnI phosphorylation upon S1 binding are shown in Fig. 4 B where overlays of a total of 14 titration datasets of phosphorylated and dephosphorylated cardiac filaments in the presence and absence of calcium are presented with two skeletal datasets in the absence of calcium being shown for reference. As can be seen, titrations of thin filaments containing either dephospho-cTnI or bisphospho-cTnI with S1 produce indistinguishable S1 binding curves in both the presence and absence of calcium. Phosphorylation of TnI therefore seems not to effect the regulation of S1 binding to actin at very high or very low calcium levels. Therefore the parameters that are defined by the shape of the S1 binding curves (specifically K B,K T, and n) are unchanged by phosphorylation under these conditions. This is in agreement with previous measurements of K B, which showed that bisphosphorylation did not significantly effect the maximum and minimum values of the rate of S1 binding to actin (k obs) but did produce a shift in the midpoint of the pCa plot (13Reiffert S.U. Jaquet K. Heilmeyer Jr., L.M. Ritchie M.D. Geeves M.A. FEBS Lett. 1996; 384: 43-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). As K T is unchanged under high or low calcium conditions, it seems unlikely that K T is modulated at intermediate calcium concentrations. For these experiments it is important that the reconstituted filaments are well regulated to ensure that experimental differences are the result of isoform variation rather than the result of poor reconstitution. Poor reconstitution or non-functional Tn components could be expected to produce noticeable effects upon both the titration and kinetic experiments. For example, non-functional TnC would be expected to show a degree of inhibition unregulated by the presence of calcium. Evidence for good reconstitution of the filaments comes first from the fact that the results from different batches of cTn were indistinguishable in this study. Second, values ofk obs for the rate of S1 binding to actin in the presence of calcium and resulting value of K Bare similar to several previous measurements for both the skeletal and cardiac systems. Finally, the similarity of the kinetic and titration measurements in the presence of calcium for both systems is also interpreted as evidence of a well regulated system. The basic result of this work is that there are significant differences in the range of regulation of the binding of S1 to actin produced by the cardiac and skeletal troponin isoforms despite the fact thatK B was similar for both systems (this work) (13Reiffert S.U. Jaquet K. Heilmeyer Jr., L.M. Ritchie M.D. Geeves M.A. FEBS Lett. 1996; 384: 43-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). The question therefore is what is the basis for these differences? The specific conclusions relating the major effect of the isoform differences to be upon the value of K T are dependent upon the model we use for thin filament regulation. However, the basic results are obviously model-independent and could be interpreted in terms of any of the other recent models proposed (32Tobacman L.S. Butters C.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 27587-27593Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar, 33Squire J.M. Morris E.P. Faseb J. 1998; 12: 761-771Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar, 34Chen Y. Yan B. Chalovich J.M. Brenner B. Biophys.

Likewise the following discussion of how to understand these isoform effects upon switching between on and off states of the filament is generalized and should be applicable to any cooperative model with two or more states. Although the skeletal and cardiac TnC sequences are 70% identical, one of the two N-terminal domain regulatory calcium sites is inactivated because of changes in key ligating residues (36van Eerd J.P. Takahashi K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1975; 64: 122-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). This means that the TnI-C interaction is dependent upon the binding of only a single Ca2+ rather than two Ca2+ for the skeletal system (37Krudy G.A. Kleerekoper Q. Guo X. Howarth J.W. Solaro R.J. Rosevear P.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 23731-23735Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These differences result in the free energy of Ca2+ binding (ΔG) being four times smaller for cardiac as compared with skeletal muscle TnC (38Liao R. Wang C.K. Cheung H.C. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 12729-12734Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Thus there is less energy available for switching of the system, which would be expected to result in either the cardiac system being less off or less on (or even both) at high and low calcium concentrations. Our data do indeed show a reduction in difference between S1 binding curves in the presence and absence of calcium for the cardiac system in reference to the skeletal system and also show that the on states appear to be nearly the same for both with the off states differing. Structural studies have shown that binding of calcium to skeletal TnC results in the opening of the two-domain structure. This results in a change from a compact structure (39Herzberg O. Hayakawa K. James M.N. J. Mol. Biol. 1984; 172: 345-346Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar, 40Sundaralingam M. Bergstrom R. Strasburg G. Rao S.T. Roychowdhury P. Greaser M. Wang B.C. Science. 1985; 227: 945-948Crossref PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar) to one with a large hydrophobic patch exposed, which allows its interaction with TnI (41Slupsky C.M. Sykes B.D. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 15953-15964Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). However cardiac Tn undergoes only a partial opening upon binding of its single regulatory calcium (42Sia S.K. Li M.X. Spyracopoulos L. Gagne S.M. Liu W. Putkey J.A. Sykes B.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 18216-18221Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar) with the additional opening necessary to bind TnI being induced directly by the presence of TnI (43Li M.X. Spyracopoulos L. Sykes B.D. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 8289-8298Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar). This implies that cTnC is less on than skTnC in the presence of calcium. Our results show that in fact the cardiac system as a whole has a similar on state in the presence of calcium but is less off in the absence of calcium. The question is whether these results are compatible. To explain this, we would propose that regulation takes place with TnI acting as a molecular switch in which the regulatory N-terminal domain is either strongly bound to actin (off) or strongly bound to TnC (on) (shown in Equation 3). This switch is therefore dependent upon the relative affinities of TnI for the rest of the Tn complex (primarily the N-terminal region of TnC) and to actin. The overall positioning of the switch is therefore dependent not upon the absolute affinities of TnI for each, but the relative affinities, with the range of switching available dependent on the calcium-dependent change in TnC affinity for TnI. Changes in the Tn isoforms can therefore alter the relative affinities of TnI for the two switch positions and bias the overall regulatory equilibrium toward more on or more off. This suggests that in the cardiac system the overall result of the isoform changes are such that in the presence of calcium the balance of the two competing equilibria of TnC for TnI and TnI for actin is similar to the skeletal system, resulting in the same on state. This means that the reduction in the calcium sensitive change of affinity of TnC for TnI in the cardiac system produces an off state in the absence of calcium that is less inhibited than for the skeletal system. Recent work has suggested that TnT may in fact have a significant role in modulating regulation, which may contribute to the differences between the two cardiac and skeletal complexes seen here (9Maytum R. Geeves M.A. Lehrer S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 29774-29780Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 10Tobacman L.S. Nihli M. Butters C. Heller M. Hatch V. Craig R. Lehman W. Homsher E. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 27636-27642Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Although our study characterized skeletal TnT effects using similar assays to those presented here, the other used motility and ATPase measurements. Both showed significant inhibition by the two TnTs, but the different nature of the assays used does not allow direct comparison of their regulatory effects, which is of significant interest in light of this work. In combination, this shows that the fine tuning of regulation by isoform changes in the troponin complex involves a complex set of interactions between all the regulatory proteins. Only through combining studies of the effects of changes to the properties of both the isolated components and complete systems will we begin to fully understand their nature and effects.

Generally, they can be classified into two groups, hydrolases and lyases. The former catalyze the hydrolysis reaction responsible for breaking glycosidic bonds in polysaccharides. The properties of glycosyl hydrolases that act on poly- and oligosaccharides have been well documented, and the three-dimensional structures of many polysaccharide hydrolases, such as amylases, chitinases, and cellulases, have already been reviewed (1Bourne Y. Henrissat B. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2001; 11: 593-600Crossref PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar, 2Davies G.J. Henrissat B. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 2002; 30: 291-297Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). As regards the second group, the lyases, it is known that they recognize uronic acid residues in polysaccharides, catalyze the β-elimination reaction, and produce unsaturated saccharides with C=C double bonds at the nonreducing terminal uronate residues (Fig. 1). These characteristics of lyases indicate that they share common structural features determining their uronate recognition sites and reaction modes (β-elimination reaction).

To determine the structural and functional relationships exhibited by polysaccharide lyases, we have recently been focusing on bacterial heteropolysaccharide lyases (lyases for alginate (14Yoon H.-J. Hashimoto W. Miyake O. Okamoto M. Mikami B. Murata K. Protein Expression Purif. 2000; 19: 84-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar), gellan (15Hashimoto W. Sato N. Kimura S. Murata K. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1998; 354: 31-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar), and xanthan (16Hashimoto W. Miki H. Tsuchiya N. Nankai H. Murata K. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 1998; 64: 3765-3768Crossref PubMed Google Scholar)) with either an endotypic or exotypic reaction mode and with either a backbone or side chain type of cleavage site. We have already determined the crystal structure of the endotype alginate lyase from Sphingomonas sp. A1 (9Yoon H.-J. Mikami B. Hashimoto W. Murata K. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 290: 505-514Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Xanthan is an exopolysaccharide produced by the plant pathogenic bacterium Xanthomonas campestris (17Rogovin S.P. Anderson R.F. Cadmus M.C. J. Biochem. Microbiol. Technol. Eng. 1961; 3: 51-63Crossref Google Scholar). This exopolysaccharide consists of a main cellulosic chain with trisaccharide side chains composed of one glucuronyl and two mannosyl residues attached at the C-3 position of alternate glucosyl residues (18Jansson P.-E. Kenne L. Lindberg B. Carbohydr. Res. 1975; 45: 275-282Crossref PubMed Scopus (645) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1 A). The internal and terminal mannosyl residues of the side chains have an O-acetyl group at the C-6 position and a pyruvate ketal at the C-4 and C-6 positions, respectively, although the extents of acetylation and pyruvation vary with the growth conditions and bacterial strain (19Sandford P.A. Pittsley J.E. Knutson C.A. Watson P.R. Cadmus M.C. Janes A. Sandford P.A. Laskin A. Extracellular Microbial Polysaccharides Symposium Series No. 45. American Chemical Society, Washington, D. C.1977: 192-210Google Scholar). Because the polymer has the peculiar rheological properties of pseudoplasticity (reversible decrease in viscosity with increase in shear rate), high viscosity at low concentrations, and tolerance to a wide range of pH and temperatures, it is widely utilized as a gelling and stabilizing agent in the food, pharmaceutical, and oil industries (20Becker A. Katzen F. Puhler A. Ielpi L. Appl. Microbiol. Biotechnol. 1998; 50: 145-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar). Xanthan lyase produced by Bacillus sp. GL1 acts exolytically on the side chains of xanthan and liberates pyruvylated mannose (PyrMan)2 through the β-elimination reaction (Fig.1 A) (16Hashimoto W. Miki H. Tsuchiya N. Nankai H. Murata K. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 1998; 64: 3765-3768Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The enzyme is synthesized as a precursor form (99 kDa) and is then converted into the mature form (∼75 kDa) through posttranslational excision of the signal peptide (2 kDa) and C-terminal polypeptide (∼22 kDa) (21Hashimoto W. Miki H. Tsuchiya N. Nankai H. Murata K. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 2001; 67: 713-720Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). On the basis of amino acid (aa) sequence similarity, the enzyme is classified into polysaccharide lyase family 8,1 which contains lyases for hyaluronate and chondroitin AC in addition to xanthan lyase, although xanthan lyase does not act on hyaluronate and chondroitin (21Hashimoto W. Miki H. Tsuchiya N. Nankai H. Murata K. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 2001; 67: 713-720Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Moreover, xanthan lyase is peculiar in that it acts on the side chains of a polysaccharide and releases the nonreducing terminal saccharides of the side chains, because almost all polysaccharide lyases (including those for pectate, alginate, hyaluronate, chondroitin, and heparin) endolytically cleave the glycosidic bonds in the main chains of polysaccharides. Therefore, it is thought that the structural analysis of xanthan lyase will contribute to clarification of the structural features that determine the uronate recognition site, the β-elimination reaction, the reaction mode (endo/exo type), and the cleavage site (main/side chain type). In this study, the three-dimensional structures of xanthan lyase and its complex with the product were determined by x-ray crystallography at 2.3 and 2.4 Å resolution, respectively. We also identified the active cleft of the enzyme and aa residues responsible for both the recognition of the substrate and the catalytic reaction. Pyruvylated xanthan (average molecular mass, 2 × 106; pyruvylation of the terminal mannosyl residue in the side chain, ∼50%) was obtained from Kohjin Co., Tokyo, Japan. Polyethylene glycol 4000 was purchased from Nacalai Tesque, Kyoto, Japan. DEAE-Toyopearl 650 m and Super Q-Toyopearl 650C were from Tosoh Co., Tokyo, Japan. Bio-Gel P2 was from Bio-Rad. The restriction endonucleases and DNA-modifying enzymes were from Takara Shuzo Co., Kyoto, and Toyobo Co., Tokyo, respectively. Xanthan lyase was assayed as described previously (16Hashimoto W. Miki H. Tsuchiya N. Nankai H. Murata K. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 1998; 64: 3765-3768Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, the enzyme was incubated in 1 ml of a reaction mixture containing 0.05% xanthan and 50 mmsodium acetate buffer, pH 5.5, and then the activity was determined by monitoring the increase in absorbance at 235 nm. One unit of the enzyme activity was defined as the amount of enzyme required to produce an increase of 1.0 in absorbance at 235 nm/min. Protein was determined by the method of Lowry et al. (22Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) with bovine serum albumin as a standard or by measuring the absorbance at 280 nm, assuming that E280 = 2.06 corresponded to 1 mg/ml, as calculated from the aa sequence using ProtParam (www.expasy.org/tools/protparam.html). Unless otherwise specified, all operations were carried out at 0–4 °C. Cells ofEscherichia coli strain BL21(DE3)pLysS harboring a plasmid (pET17b-XL4) (21Hashimoto W. Miki H. Tsuchiya N. Nankai H. Murata K. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 2001; 67: 713-720Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar) were grown in 6 liters of LB medium (1.5 liters/flask), collected by centrifugation at 6000 × gand 4 °C for 5 min, washed with 20 mm potassium phosphate buffer (KPB), pH 7.0, and then resuspended in the same buffer. The cells were disrupted ultrasonically (Insonator model 201M, Kubota, Tokyo, Japan) at 0 °C and 9 kHz for 20 min, and the clear solution obtained upon centrifugation at 15,000 × gand 4 °C for 20 min was used as the cell extract containing the precursor form (97 kDa) of the enzyme. The cell extract, after supplementation with 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and 0.1 μm pepstatin A, was fractionated with ammonium sulfate. The precipitate (0–30% saturation) was collected by centrifugation at 15,000 × g and 4 °C for 20 min, dissolved in 20 mm KPB, pH 7.0, and then applied to a DEAE-Toyopearl 650 m column (2.6 × 15 cm) equilibrated with 20 mm KPB, pH 7.0. The enzyme was eluted with a linear gradient of NaCl (0–0.7 m) in 20 mm KPB, pH 7.0 (200 ml), with 2 ml fractions collected every 2 min. The active fractions, which were eluted with 0.4m NaCl, were combined and dialyzed against 20 mm KPB, pH 7.0. The dialysate was used as the purified precursor form (97 kDa) of the enzyme. To convert the precursor (97 kDa) autocatalytically to the mature form (∼75 kDa), the purified precursor was kept at 4 °C for 1 week. After confirmation of the conversion by SDS-PAGE (23Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (205531) Google Scholar), the enzyme solution was applied to a Super Q-Toyopearl 650C column (1.7 × 5 cm) equilibrated with 20 mm KPB, pH 7.0, and eluted with a linear gradient of NaCl (0 to 0.5 m) in 20 mm KPB, pH 7.0 (50 ml). 1-ml fractions were collected every minute. The active fractions, which were eluted with about 0.2 m NaCl, were combined and dialyzed against 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, and the dialysate was used as the purified mature form (∼75 kDa) of the enzyme. Xanthan (0.5%) dissolved in 50 mm sodium acetate (pH 5.5) (200 ml) was treated with the purified xanthan lyase (10 mg). The solution was mixed with ethanol (400 ml) and then centrifuged at 15,000 × g and 4 °C for 20 min. The supernatant was concentrated to 1.5 ml through evaporation and then applied to a Bio-Gel P2 column (0.9 by 122 cm) equilibrated with distilled water. The sugar eluted was determined to be PyrMan by confirming the release of mannose and pyruvate on hydrolysis with trifluoroacetic acid, as described previously (16Hashimoto W. Miki H. Tsuchiya N. Nankai H. Murata K. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 1998; 64: 3765-3768Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The fractions containing PyrMan were collected, freeze-dried, and dissolved in distilled water. The purity and content of PyrMan were determined by TLC analysis as described previously (16Hashimoto W. Miki H. Tsuchiya N. Nankai H. Murata K. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 1998; 64: 3765-3768Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The mature form (∼75 kDa) of xanthan lyase was crystallized by the hanging-drop vapor diffusion method. The solution for a crystallization drop was prepared on a siliconized coverslip by mixing 3 μl of protein solution (7.18 mg of protein/ml) with 3 μl of mother liquor comprising 23% polyethylene glycol 4000, 0.2 m ammonium formate, and 0.1m sodium Bicine buffer, pH 9.0. The crystals were soaked in several heavy atom derivative solutions comprising 2 mmNaAuCl4, 0.2 mm AgNO3, 1 mm Ac2UO2, 2 mmSmCl3, 1 mm GdCl3, 1 mmHoCl3, and 1 mm CdCl2 for 1 or 2 h at 20 °C. Crystals were also soaked in a sugar solution containing 75 mm PyrMan. All heavy atom and sugar solutions were prepared with a modified mother liquor consisting of 23% polyethylene glycol 4000, 0.2 m ammonium formate, and 0.1m Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.4. Diffraction data for the native and derivative crystals were collected with a Bruker Hi-Star multiwire area detector at 20 °C, using CuKα radiation generated by a MAC Science M18XHF rotating anode generator, and were processed with the SADIE and SAINT software packages (Bruker, Karlsruhe, Germany) (TableI).Table IData collection and refinement statistics for xanthan lyaseNativeComplexCrystal systemOrthorhombicOrthorhombicSpace groupP212121P212121Cell dimensions a, b, c (Å)54.323, 91.446, 160.74554.357, 91.305, 159.258Molecules/asymmetric unit11Data collectionX-ray sourceRotating anodeRotating anodeDetectorBruker Hi-starBruker Hi-starResolution range (last shell)aThe data in the highest resolution shells are given in parentheses.(Å)27.6–2.22 (2.30–2.22)26.3–2.40 (2.49–2.40)Measured reflections (last shell)112,089 (2,776)55,703 (4,006)Unique reflections (last shell)34,941 (1,632)28,677 (2,308)Completeness (last shell) (%)86.4 (58.0)89.9 (53.4)R-sym (last shell) (%)8.4 (36.8)9.1 (37.6)RefinementResolution (last shell) (Å)50–2.3 (2.38–2.30)50–2.4 (2.49–2.40)Used reflections (last shell)30,582 (2,098)26,294 (1,716)Completeness (last shell) (%)83.9 (58.3)82.6 (54.8)Residues/water752/248752/261Calcium ion11PyrMan1Average B-factor (Å2)28.120.0r.m.s. deviationBond length (Å)0.00600.0062Bond angle (deg)1.291.31R-factor (last shell) (%)17.5 (26.6)16.9 (26.0)R-free (last shell) (%)24.0 (34.4)24.2 (32.0)a The data in the highest resolution shells are given in parentheses. Open table in a new tab The crystal structure of xanthan lyase was solved by the multiple isomorphous replacement (m.i.r.) method. The major sites of heavy atoms were determined by interpretation of the peaks in difference Patterson maps obtained at 3.0 Å resolution. Additional heavy atom sites were determined from the peaks in difference Fourier maps. Phase refinement was performed with the program package PHASES (24Furey W. Swaminathan S. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 277: 590-620Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar). The results of heavy atom refinement and phasing by m.i.r. at 3.0 Å resolution are presented in Table II. The phase was improved greatly and the figure-of-merit increased to 0.854 after solvent flattening with PHASES (25Wang B.C. Methods Enzymol. 1985; 115: 90-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (939) Google Scholar). The model was built using the program TURBO-FRODO (AFMB-CNRS, Marseille, France) on a Silicon Graphics Octane computer. Simulated annealing refinement was carried out with this model using 50–2.3 Å resolution data obtained with CNS (26Brünger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. Delano W.L. Gros P. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Jiang J.-S. Kuszewski J. Nilges N. Pannu N.S. Read R.J. Rice L.M. Simonson T. Warren G.L. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1998; 54: 905-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (16919) Google Scholar). The model was heated to 2500 K and then slowly cooled to 300 K (time-step, 0.5 fs; decrease in temperature, 25 K; number of steps at each temperature, 50), and then 150 cycles of Powell minimization were carried out. Fo − Fc and 2 Fo − Fc maps were used to locate the correct model. Several rounds of positional andB-factor refinement followed by manual model building were carried out to improve the model by increasing the data to 2.3 Å resolution. Water molecules were incorporated where the difference in density was more than 3.0 ς above the mean and the 2 Fo − Fc map showed a density of more than 1.0 ς. The final R-factor was 17.5% for 30,582 data points in the 50.0–2.3 Å resolution range (83.9% completeness). The R-free value calculated for the randomly separated 10% data was 24.0%.Table IIStatistics for heavy atom derivatives of xanthan lyaseDerivativeConditionsaThe soaking solution comprised 23% polyethylene glycol 4000, 0.2 m ammonium formate, and 0.1 mTris-HCl, pH 7.4.Res.

Open table in a new tab A crystal soaked with PyrMan was isomorphous with the crystal used for the native set. A Fo − Fc map (contoured at 3.0 ς) at 2.4 Å resolution was obtained using the reflection data for the sugar-soaked crystal, and the phase was calculated from the final model of xanthan lyase. The stereo quality of the model was assessed using the programs PROCHECK (27Laskowski R.A. MacArthur M.W. Moss D.S. Thornton J.M. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1993; 26: 283-291Crossref Google Scholar) and WHAT-CHECK (28Hooft R.W. Vriend G. Sander C. Abola E.E. Nature. 1996; 381: 272Crossref PubMed Scopus (1788) Google Scholar). Ribbon plots were prepared using the programs MOLSCRIPT (29Kraulis P.J. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1991; 24: 946-950Crossref Google Scholar), BOBSCRIPT (30Esnouf R.M. J. Mol. Graph.

Genet. 1991; 11: 281-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (5311) Google Scholar). The coordinates of lyases for hyaluronate and chondroitin AC were taken from the RCSB Protein Data Bank (33Berman H.M. Westbrook J. Feng Z. Gilliland G. Bhat T.N. Weissig H. Shindyalov I.N. Bourne P.E. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 235-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (26227) Google Scholar). These molecular models were superimposed by means of fitting the programs RIGID and TOP included in TURBO-FRODO and CCP4, respectively. The mature form (about 75 kDa) of xanthan lyase of Bacillus sp. GL1 was purified from recombinant E. coli cells harboring plasmid pET17b-XL4 (21Hashimoto W. Miki H. Tsuchiya N. Nankai H. Murata K. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 2001; 67: 713-720Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). A crystal of xanthan lyase (0.3 × 0.2 × 0.05 mm) was obtained by the hanging-drop vapor diffusion method. The space group was determined to beP212121 (orthorhombic) with unit cell dimensions of a = 54.3 Å,b = 91.4 Å, and c = 160.7 Å; the solvent content was 50.2% assuming one molecule/asymmetric unit. The results of the x-ray data collection are summarized in TableI. The structure of the enzyme was determined by the m.i.r. method. Table IIshows the refinement statistics for the heavy atoms at 3.0 Å resolution. The protein model was built after solvent flattening of the m.i.r. phase with the PHASES program (24Furey W. Swaminathan S. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 277: 590-620Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar), and the model was refined by means of simulated annealing and the restrained least-squares method using CNS (26Brünger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. Delano W.L. Gros P. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Jiang J.-S. Kuszewski J. Nilges N. Pannu N.S. Read R.J. Rice L.M. Simonson T. Warren G.L. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1998; 54: 905-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (16919) Google Scholar), as shown in Table I. The refined model of xanthan lyase comprises 752 aa residues, 248 water molecules, and one calcium ion. The N- and C-terminal aa residues of the mature form produced from the preproform through posttranslational processing were confirmed to be Ser26 and Gly777, respectively, by electron density mapping. All of the polypeptide chain sequences could be well traced, and the electron density of the main and side chains was generally very well defined in the 2 Fo − Fc map. The final overallR-factor for the refined model was 0.175, with 30,582 unique reflections within the 50.0–2.3 Å resolution range. The final freeR-factor calculated with the randomly selected 10% data was 0.240. The final root-mean-square (r.m.s.) deviations from the standard geometry were 0.0060 Å for bond lengths and 1.29o for bond angles. Based on the theoretical curves in the plot calculated according to Luzzati (34Luzzati V. Acta Crystallogr. 1952; 5: 802-810Crossref Google Scholar), the absolute positional error was estimated to be close to 0.25 Å of 5.0–2.3 Å resolution. Judging from the results of Ramachandran plot analysis, in which the stereochemical correctness of the backbone structure is indicated by the (φ, ψ) torsion angles (35Ramachandran G.N. Sasisekharan V. Adv. Protein Chem. 1968; 23: 283-437Crossref PubMed Scopus (2736) Google Scholar), most of the non-glycine residues (86.1%) lay within the most favored regions, and the other residues (13.6%) fell in the additional and generously allowed regions, except for the Thr247 and Asp695 residues. The Thr247 and Asp695 residues are in β-turns. In particular, the latter turn, containing the Asp695 residue, is similar to a β-hairpin consisting of four amino acid residues with the conformation of β-ε-γ-β in a Ramachandran plot (36Sibanda B.L. Thornton J.M. Nature. 1985; 316: 170-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (507) Google Scholar), because the Ala694, Asp695, Leu696, and Ile697 residues fell in or near the β, ε, γ, and β regions of the plot, respectively. Furthermore, there is one cis-peptide between the Ala753 and Pro754residues. Figs.2 and 3 depict a ribbon model of the overall structure and topology of the secondary structure elements of xanthan lyase, respectively. The enzyme has approximate dimensions of 100 × 70 × 50 Å and is composed of two globular domains (N- and C-terminal domains) that form α- and β-structures, respectively. The N-terminal domain comprises the 352 aa residues from Ser26 to Asp377 and is composed predominantly of 13 α-helices, 10 of which form an α/α barrel structure. The C-terminal domain comprises the 389 aa residues from Leu389 to Gly777 and one calcium ion and consists of 30 β-strands arranged in five anti-parallel β-sheets. A peptide linker composed of the 11 aa residues from Asp378to Asn388 connects the N- and C-terminal domains. In the structure of xanthan lyase, 25.7% of all aa residues are in α-helices, 26.2% in β-strands, and the remaining 48.1% in turns and coils.Figure 3Topology diagram of xanthan lyase. The enzyme consists of two domains (N- and C-terminal domains). The 13 α-helices (HA1–HA13) and two short β-strands (S1 and S2) in the N-terminal domain are shown asboxes and arrows, respectively. The inner helices (HA3, HA5, HA7, HA9, andHA11) and outer helices (HA4, HA6,HA8, HA10, and HA12) in the α/α-barrel structure are shown in green andpurple, respectively, and the other helices (HA1,HA2, and HA13) are in gray. The 30 β-strands arranged into sheets A, B,C, D, and E in the C-terminal domain are shown as blue, purple, cyan, green, and red arrows, respectively. A short α-helix (HB1) and calcium ion (Ca) are shown as a gray box and ayellow ball, respectively.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) The N-terminal domain is composed primarily of two short β-strands and 13 α-helices. The latter contribute to the formation of an α/α-barrel structure with a deep cleft, which is considered to be an active site (Figs. 2 and4 A). The 13 major α-helices, numbered sequentially from HA1 to HA13 (HA1, aa residues 28–41; HA2, 51–69; HA3, 90–106; HA4, 118–131; HA5, 153–165; HA6, 173–184; HA7, 192–208; HA8, 212–221; HA9, 255–270; HA10, 284–291; HA11, 318–333; HA12, 338–354; and HA13, 366–376), vary in length between 8 and 19 aa residues and consist of 187 aa residues (Fig. 3). These α-helices are arranged as follows: four (HA5, HA6, HA8, and HA13) with three turns; seven (HA1, HA3, HA4, HA7, HA9, HA11, and HA12) with four turns; one (HA2) with five turns; and one (HA10) with two turns. There are 12 loops (from LA1 to LA12) connecting an α-helix to the following α-helix in the N-terminal domain (Fig. 3). The loop (LA8) between HA8 and HA9 includes two short β-strands (S1, aa residues 235–238, and S2, 243–245). Therefore, in the N-terminal domain, 52.3% of all aa residues are in α-helices, 2.0% in β-strands, and the remaining 45.7% in turns and coils. The N-terminal α-helical domain includes an incomplete α5/α5-barrel formed by five inner and five outer α-helices, and the 10 α-helices (from HA3 to HA12) constituting the α5/α5-barrel are located within the core of the domain (Fig. 4 A). These 10 helices are connected by short and long loops in a nearest neighbor, up-and-down pattern. This arrangement is described as a “twisted α/α-barrel” with five inner α-helices (HA3, HA5, HA7, HA9, and HA11), which are oriented in roughly the same direction, and five outer α-helices (HA4, HA6, HA8, HA10, and HA12) running in the opposite direction. The C-terminal domain consists predominantly of 30 β-strands (SA1, aa residues 389–396; SA2, 398–402; SA3, 407–"

Recently, an additional RNS was postulated to contribute to 3-nitrotyrosine formation in vivo; nitryl chloride formed from the reaction of nitrite and neutrophil myeloperoxidase-derived hypochlorous acid (HOCl). Whether nitryl chloride nitrates intracellular protein is unknown. Therefore, we exposed intact human HepG2 and SW1353 cells or cell lysates to HOCl and nitrite and examined each for 3-nitrotyrosine formation by: 1) Western blotting, 2) using a commercial 3-nitrotyrosine enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kit, 3) flow cytometric analysis, and 4) confocal microscopic analysis. With each approach, no significant 3-nitrotyrosine formation was observed in either whole cells or cell lysates. However, substantial 3-nitrotyrosine was observed when peroxynitrite (100 μm) was added to cells or cell lysates. These data suggest that nitryl chloride formed from the reaction of nitrite with HOCl does not contribute to the elevated levels of 3-nitrotyrosine observed in human diseases.

Zhao K. Whiteman M. Free Radic. Res. 1999; 31: 651-669Google Scholar and 2Greenacre S.A.B. Ischiropoulos H. Free Radic. Res. 2001; 34: 541-581Google Scholar). Numerous cell types are capable of producing high micromolar concentrations of nitric oxide (⋅NO) through the activation of inducible nitric-oxide synthase (reviewed in Refs. 3Moncada S. Verh. K. Acad. Geneeskd. Belg. 2001; 62: 171-179Google Scholar and 4Ellis G. Adatia I. Yazdanpanah M. Makela S.K. Clin. Biochem. 1998; 31: 195-220Google Scholar). In vivo, ⋅NO is readily oxidized via heme proteins to nitrite (NO2−) and nitrate (NO3−). Thus, evidence for an elevated production of ⋅NO comes from the measurement of NO2− and NO3− in human body fluids such as plasma, cerebrospinal fluid, synovial fluid, respiratory tract lining fluid, saliva, and sputum. This has implicated ⋅NO in a large number and diverse range of human diseases (reviewed in Ref. 4Ellis G. Adatia I. Yazdanpanah M. Makela S.K. Clin. Biochem. 1998; 31: 195-220Google Scholar). Typically, levels of NO2− found in plasma taken from healthy human volunteers range between 0.5 and 21.0 μm(5Leone A.M. Francis P.L. Rhodes P. Moncada S. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

Electrophoresis. 1995; 16: 1002-1004Google Scholar), and levels are significantly elevated during inflammation,e.g. up to 36 μm in patients with human immunodeficiency virus infection (7Torre D. Ferrario G. Speranza F. Fiori G.P. Zeroli P. J. Clin. Path. 1996; 49: 574-576Google Scholar). Serum NO2−levels in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (8Wanchu A. Agnihotri N. Deodhar S.D. Ganguly N.K.

Nitrite has been extensively used for decades in the food industry as a preservative and for curing meat. Approximately 5% of ingested nitrate is reduced to nitrite by oral microflora where it enters the gastrointestinal tract and protonates to form nitrous acid (NHO2, pK a ∼ 3.4) (reviewed in Refs. 14McKnight G.M. Duncan C.W. Leifert C. Golden M.H. Br. J. Nutr. 1999; 81: 349-358Google Scholar and 15Weitzberg E. Lundberg J.O.N. Nitric Oxide Biol. Chem. 1998; 2: 1-7Google Scholar). Furthermore, dietary NO2− has been proposed as an oral and gut anti-microbial agent (14McKnight G.M. Duncan C.W. Leifert C. Golden M.H. Br. J. Nutr. 1999; 81: 349-358Google Scholar, 15Weitzberg E. Lundberg J.O.N. Nitric Oxide Biol. Chem. 1998; 2: 1-7Google Scholar) where salivary levels of NO2− of up to 98 μm have been reported (16Helaleh M.I.H. Korenaga T. J. Chromatogr. B. 2000; 744: 433-437Google Scholar), and near millimolar concentrations are reported to be reached in the saliva of patients with systemic sclerosis (17Konttinen Y.T. Platts L.A. Tuominen S. Eklund K.K. Santavirta N. Tornwall J. Sorsa T. Hukkanen M. Polak J.M. Arthritis Rheum. 1997; 40: 875-883Google Scholar). Over 50 human disease conditions have elevated levels of 3-nitrotyrosine, a biomarker for RNS traditionally attributed to ONOO− formation in vivo. These include neurodegenerative, chronic inflammatory, gastrointestinal tract, and cardiovascular disorders as well as viral and bacterial infections (reviewed in Refs. 1Halliwell B. Zhao K. Whiteman M. Free Radic. Res. 1999; 31: 651-669Google Scholar and 2Greenacre S.A.B. Ischiropoulos H. Free Radic. Res. 2001; 34: 541-581Google Scholar). Recent research has shown that 3-nitrotyrosine formation is not solely a ONOO−-mediated phenomenon. It is also observed with peroxidases such as eosinophil peroxidase (18Duguet A. Iijima H. Eum S.Y. Hamid Q. Eidelman D.H. Am. J. Resp. Crit. Care Med. 2001; 164: 1119-1126Google Scholar), myeloperoxidase (released by activated neutrophils at sites of inflammation) (19Eiserich J.P. Cross C.E. Jones A.D. Halliwell B. Van der Vliet A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 19199-19208Google Scholar), and other peroxidases (20Sampson J.B. Ye Y. Rosen H. Beckman J.S. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1998; 356: 207-213Google Scholar) in the presence of NO2−. In addition, hemoglobin and other heme proteins such as catalase may also serve as a mechanism for nitrating tyrosine residues in proteins using NO2− as a substrate (21Grzelak A. Balcerczyk A. Majeta A. Bartosz G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1528: 97-100Google Scholar). Recently, a further mechanism for 3-nitrotyrosine formation was proposed (22Johnson D.W. Margerum D.W. Inorg. Chem. 1991; 30: 4845-4851Google Scholar, 23Eiserich J.P. Hristova M. Cross C.E. Jones A.D. Freeman B.A. Halliwell B. Van der Vliet A. Nature. 1998; 391: 393-397Google Scholar); the formation of nitryl chloride (NO2Cl) by reaction of myeloperoxidase-derived hypochlorous acid (HOCl) with NO2− (Reaction 1) (24Panasenko O.M. Briviba J.

Am. J. Med. 2000; 109: 33-44Google Scholar). Consequently, NO2Cl formation from activated human neutrophils and nitration of extracellular phenolics in the presence of added NO2− have been demonstrated (23Eiserich J.P. Hristova M. Cross C.E. Jones A.D. Freeman B.A. Halliwell B. Van der Vliet A. Nature. 1998; 391: 393-397Google Scholar). Although NO2−, NO3−, and HOCl are formed in substantial amounts during inflammation and the former two are normally present in saliva and are present in the gut at high concentrations, whether NO2Cl plays any part in the tyrosine nitration observed in vivo is unclear. Therefore, in this report we investigated whether HOCl in the presence of NO2− could nitrate intracellular protein using HepG2 hepatoma and SW1353 chondrosarcoma cells as models of human liver (26Ahn B. Han B.S. Kim D.J. Ohshima H. Carcinogenesis. 1999; 20: 1337-1344Google Scholar) and cartilage cells (27Mapp P.I. Klocke R. Walsh D.A. Chana J.K. Stevens C.R. Gallagher P.J. Blake D.R. Arthritis Rheum. 2001; 44: 1534-1539Google Scholar, 28Whiteman M. Hooper D.C. Scott G.S. Koprowski H. Halliwell B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2002; 99: 12061-12066Google Scholar) exposed to RNS. We used four analytical approaches: immunochemistry with monoclonal and polyclonal antibodies from two commercial sources using confocal microscopy, flow cytometry, and Western blotting as well as a commercial ELISA kit. Bovine serum albumin (BSA), oxidized glutathione (GSSG), sodium nitrite (NaNO2), sodium nitrate (NaNO3), sodium hypochlorite, and all other reagents were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, MO). HOCl concentration was quantified immediately before use spectrophotometrically at 290 nm (pH 12, ε = 350 m−1 cm−1) (29Morris J.C. J. Phys. Chem. 1996; 70: 3798-3805Google Scholar). Hydrogen peroxide-free peroxynitrite was synthesized as described previously (30Beckman J.S. Chen J. Ischiropolous H. Crow J.P. Methods Enzymol. 1996; 223: 229-240Google Scholar) and quantified in 1 n NaOH at 302 nm (ε = 1670 m−1 cm−1). Rabbit polyclonal anti-nitrotyrosine antibodies were from either Upstate Biotechnology Inc. (#12-348) or BIOMOL (Plymouth Meeting, PA, #SA-297). Mouse monoclonal anti-nitrotyrosine antibodies were obtained from Calbiochem (La Jolla, CA, #487923) or Alexis (#804-204). Peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies for Western blotting were purchased from Promega. Fluorescently labeled rhodamine anti-mouse IgG (#12-329) was obtained from Calbiochem, and AlexaFluor 488 anti-rabbit IgG (#A11008) was obtained from Molecular Probes (Eugene, OR). The nitrotyrosine ELISA was purchased from Cambridge Biosciences (Cambridge, England, #HK501). Human HepG2 hepatoma and SW1353 chondrosarcoma cells were obtained from the American Tissue Culture Collection (Gaithersburg, MD). HepG2 cells were grown in Minimum essential media, and SW1353 cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium. Media were supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and 1% penicillin/streptomycin, and cells were grown at 37 °C in 5% CO2:95% O2 with ∼95% humidity to 90% confluency before seeding into six-well plates (Falcon) overnight at a density of 1 × 106cells/well. Cells were washed three times in warm PBS and further incubated for 10 min with PBS containing increasing concentrations of NaNO2(10 μm to 1 mm). After this time, HOCl was added to give final concentrations between 7 and 125 μm. Cells were then incubated at 37 °C for 5 min. In parallel experiments, cell lysates were obtained by freeze-thawing in 0.5 ml of PBS and sonication at 4 °C for 10 min before addition of HOCl/NO2− or ONOO− for 5 min and the addition of protease inhibitors (1 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 μg/ml pepstatin A, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, and 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) as described (31Eiserich J.P. Estevez A.G. Bamberg T.V. Ye Y.Z. Chumley P.H. Beckman J.S. Freeman B.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 6365-6370Google Scholar). After exposure to HOCl, ONOO−, NO2−, or NO2−/HOCl, cell viability was assessed using 3-(4,5-dimethyl-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) as described (32Spencer J.P.E. Whiteman M. Jenner A. Halliwell B. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2000; 28: 1039-1050Google Scholar). After treatment, 10 mm GSSG was added to quench any unreacted HOCl, and cells were washed twice with warm (37 °C) PBS. Cells were then lysed with PBS containing 0.1% SDS and protease inhibitors (1 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 μg/ml pepstatin A, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, and 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) as described (31Eiserich J.P. Estevez A.G. Bamberg T.V. Ye Y.Z. Chumley P.H. Beckman J.S. Freeman B.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 6365-6370Google Scholar). Western blotting for nitrotyrosine-containing proteins was conducted as described (31Eiserich J.P. Estevez A.G. Bamberg T.V. Ye Y.Z. Chumley P.H. Beckman J.S. Freeman B.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 6365-6370Google Scholar) using polyclonal or monoclonal anti-nitrotyrosine antibodies with an enhanced chemiluminescence detection kit (AmershamBiosciences, Buckinghamshire, United Kingdom) followed by analysis using a Kodak image analyzer (IS440CF, PerkinElmer Life Sciences, Boston, MA), and captured images were analyzed using Kodak Digital Science one-dimensional image analysis software. The same samples obtained for Western blotting were also analyzed for nitrotyrosine content by commercial ELISA, prepared using the manufacturer's instructions. Protein concentration was determined using a commercial kit (Bio-Rad Dc protein assay), and samples were normalized for protein content. As an additional control, 1 mm ONOO−was added to BSA (4 mg/ml) to generate nitrated BSA. 1 × 105 cells were seeded overnight in glass bottom Petri dishes (WillCo-dish, Willco Wells, Amsterdam, The Netherlands) and washed three times in warm (37 °C) NO2−-free PBS before addition of HOCl, NO2−, or ONOO− as described above. Cells were then fixed and permeabilized in 1 ml of ice-cold ethanol (70% v/v) and incubated at 4 °C for 2 h. Control experiments using 100 μm NO2− alone were also performed (33Clement M.-V. Hirpara J. Chowdhury S. Pervaiz S. Blood. 1998; 92: 996-1002Google Scholar). Cells were then incubated with either monoclonal or polyclonal anti-nitrotyrosine antibodies for 1 h at room temperature followed by rhodamine- or AlexaFluor 488-labeled secondary anti-IgG antibodies as described (33Clement M.-V. Hirpara J. Chowdhury S. Pervaiz S. Blood. 1998; 92: 996-1002Google Scholar). Cells were processed and analyzed within 5 h of initial treatment. Laser confocal microscopy was performed with a Zeiss LSM410 confocal microscope. The red fluorescence of rhodamine and the green fluorescence of AlexaFlour 488 were excited with the 568- and 488-nm lines of an argon-krypton laser. Fluorescence was split by a 560-nm emission dichroic filter and collected by separate photomultipliers through 515- to 565-nm band pass and 590-nm long pass barrier filters with the following settings held constant: photo-multiplier tube (610), gain (4.2%), and offset (2%). Cells were seeded overnight in six-well plates at a density of 1 × 106 cells per well and treated with HOCl, NO2−, or ONOO− as described above. Cells were then washed three times in NO2−-free PBS, scraped into 1.5 ml of PBS in Eppendorf tubes, centrifuged at 3000 rpm for 5 min, and fixed and permeabilized with 1 ml of ice-cold ethanol (70%, v/v) at 4 °C for 2 h as described (33Clement M.-V. Hirpara J. Chowdhury S. Pervaiz S. Blood. 1998; 92: 996-1002Google Scholar, 34Choi J.-J. Oh Y.-K. Kim H.-S. Kim H.-C. Ko K.H. Kim W.-K. Glia. 2002; 39: 37-42Google Scholar). Polyclonal or monoclonal anti-nitrotyrosine antibodies were then added and incubated in PBS containing 1% (v/v) fetal bovine serum for 1 h at room temperature. After washing, fluorescently labeled secondary antibodies (rhodamine or AlexaFluor 488) were then added for 1 h. Cells were then analyzed by flow cytometry using a Epics Elite flow cytometer (ESP, Coulter, Miami, FL) within 5 h of initial treatment. Data were analyzed from 20,000 cells using WinMDI 2.7 software (Scripps Institute, La Jolla, CA), and the percentage of nitrotyrosine-stained cells was determined from histogram analysis. All graphs were plotted with mean ± S.D. In all cases the mean values were calculated from data taken from at least six separate experiments performed on separate days using freshly prepared reagents. Where significance testing was performed, an independent test (Student's t test, two populations) was used (*, p < 0.1; **,p < 0.05; and ***, p < 0.01). The addition of HOCl to SW1353 and HepG2 cells for 5 min resulted in negligible loss of cell viability as measured using MTT. For example, the addition of 125 μm HOCl for 5 min resulted in a 8.8 ± 3.4% and 5.6 ± 4.8% reduction in SW1353 and HepG2 cell viability, respectively. The addition of HOCl, NO2−, or ONOO− did not significantly alter the pH of the reaction mixture. Using a commercially available nitrotyrosine ELISA kit, extensive tyrosine nitration was observed after human HepG2 cells or SW1353 cells (Fig. 1 A) or cell lysates (Fig. 1 B) were exposed to 100 μmONOO− for 5 min. In sharp contrast, cells treated with HOCl and NO2− did not show any significant increase in tyrosine nitration at any of the HOCl (7–125 μm) and NO2− (10 μm to 1 mm) concentrations used. Fig. 1 A shows the results obtained with 125 μm HOCl and is representative of all the HOCl concentrations used. Similarly, the addition of HOCl and NO2− to freshly prepared cell lysates did not show any observable tyrosine nitration (Fig. 1 B). Western blotting using monoclonal and polyclonal anti-nitrotyrosine antibodies from several commercial sources was also performed. Treating cells or freshly prepared cell lysates with ONOO− (100 μm, positive control) resulted in extensive tyrosine nitration in cell lysates. However, exposure of the cells or cell lysates to HOCl or HOCl and NO2− did not result in any detectable tyrosine nitration with any of the commercial antibodies used. Fig. 2 (A andB) shows representative Western blots obtained using an Upstate Biotechnology rabbit polyclonal antibody (Fig. 2 A) and the Calbiochem mouse monoclonal antibody (Fig. 2 B) on whole cell extracts and cell lysates from SW1353 cells. It can be seen that, even after lengthy exposure (20 min) in ECL reagent, tyrosine nitration was only detected in the positive control (100 μm ONOO−) using either monoclonal or polyclonal antibodies. The same results were obtained with HepG2 cells and cell lysates (data not shown). Flow cytometric analysis of whole cells exposed to ONOO−, HOCl, and HOCl with NO2− was also performed with monoclonal and polyclonal anti-nitrotyrosine antibodies. Fig. 3 is representative of results obtained using polyclonal (Fig. 3, A–D) and monoclonal antibodies (Fig. 3, E–H) against nitrotyrosine in HepG2 (Fig. 3, A–D) and SW1353 cells (Fig. 3, E–H). Treatment of cells with 100 μm ONOO−resulted in a substantial increase in the number of nitrotyrosine-positive cells compared with untreated cells (Fig. 3,A and E). Complete inhibition of antibody binding was achieved by incubating the primary antibodies with 10 mm nitrotyrosine (Fig. 3, B and F). Incubation of cells with up to 125 μm HOCl for 5 min did not result in the formation of intracellular 3-nitrotyrosine (Fig. 3,C and G). Fig. 3 (D and H) is representative of all the concentrations of NO2−(0–1 mm) and HOCl (0–125 μm) tested, and, in contrast to ONOO− treatment, cells treated with HOCl in the presence of up to 1 mm NO2− did not show any observable nitrotyrosine formation (Fig. 3, D andH). Laser scanning confocal microscopy was also used to assess intracellular tyrosine nitration. Fig.4 is representative of data obtained when cells were exposed to either ONOO− or HOCl in the presence of NO2−. HepG2 cells were immunostained with polyclonal anti-nitrotyrosine antibodies coupled to AlexaFluor 488-conjugated secondary anti-rabbit IgG (Fig. 4, A–C), and SW1353 cells were immunostained with monoclonal anti-nitrotyrosine antibodies coupled to rhodamine-conjugated anti-mouse IgG (Fig. 4,D and E). Substantial positive 3-nitrotyrosine immunostaining was observed in HepG2cells and SW1353 cells exposed to non-lethal concentrations of ONOO− (100 μm) using either polyclonal (Fig. 4 B) or monoclonal (Fig.4 E) anti-nitrotyrosine antibodies. In contrast, treating the cells with PBS alone (Fig. 4, A and D) or incubating cells with NO2− followed by subsequent addition of HOCl (Fig. 4, C and F) did not result in any detectable nitrotyrosine formation at any of the NO2− concentrations (10 μm to 1 mm) or HOCl concentrations (7–125 μm) used. The formation of 3-nitrotyrosine has been observed in over 50 human disease conditions (reviewed in Refs. 1Halliwell B. Zhao K. Whiteman M. Free Radic. Res. 1999; 31: 651-669Google Scholar and 2Greenacre S.A.B. Ischiropoulos H. Free Radic. Res. 2001; 34: 541-581Google Scholar). The formation of this biomarker has been attributed to an overproduction of ⋅NO and subsequent formation of highly reactive nitrogen species (RNS) usually attributed as ONOO−. However, an overproduction of⋅NO also results in the accumulation of NO2−, which has been reported to reach millimolar concentrations in certain disease conditions (8Wanchu A. Agnihotri N. Deodhar S.D. Ganguly N.K. Indian J. Med. Res. 1996; 104: 263-268Google Scholar, 9Sud A. Khullar M. Wanchu A. Bambert P. Nitric Oxide Biol. Chem. 2000; 4: 615-619Google Scholar, 10Wanchu A. Khullar M. Deodhar S.D. Bambery P. Sud A. Rheum. Int. 1998; 18: 41-43Google Scholar). Nitrite also serves as a substrate for peroxidases (20Sampson J.B. Ye Y. Rosen H. Beckman J.S. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1998; 356: 207-213Google Scholar) such as myeloperoxidase (20Sampson J.B. Ye Y. Rosen H. Beckman J.S. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1998; 356: 207-213Google Scholar, 23Eiserich J.P. Hristova M. Cross C.E. Jones A.D. Freeman B.A. Halliwell B. Van der Vliet A. Nature. 1998; 391: 393-397Google Scholar) and eosinophil peroxidase (18Duguet A. Iijima H. Eum S.Y. Hamid Q. Eidelman D.H. Am. J. Resp. Crit. Care Med. 2001; 164: 1119-1126Google Scholar) as well as heme proteins (21Grzelak A. Balcerczyk A. Majeta A. Bartosz G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1528: 97-100Google Scholar) to generate tyrosine-nitrating species. At sites of chronic inflammation, neutrophils produce the oxidant HOCl, which in the presence of NO2−, forms an additional tyrosine-nitrating species, nitryl chloride (NO2Cl) (22Johnson D.W. Margerum D.W. Inorg. Chem. 1991; 30: 4845-4851Google Scholar, 23Eiserich J.P. Hristova M. Cross C.E. Jones A.D. Freeman B.A. Halliwell B. Van der Vliet A. Nature. 1998; 391: 393-397Google Scholar). Although there is a wealth of information on RNS-mediated processes, limited information is available on the consequences of HOCl and NO2−accumulation and resulting NO2Cl formation generated from this reaction (28Whiteman M. Hooper D.C. Scott G.S. Koprowski H. Halliwell B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2002; 99: 12061-12066Google Scholar, 32Spencer J.P.E. Whiteman M. Jenner A. Halliwell B. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2000; 28: 1039-1050Google Scholar). The relatively fast second order rate constant of reaction of NO2− with HOCl (pH 7.2, 25 °C, 7.4 ± 1.3 × 103m−1s−1) (24Panasenko O.M. Briviba J. Klotz L.O. Sies H. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1997; 343: 254-259Google Scholar) and the high concentrations of HOCl and accumulation of NO2− at sites of chronic inflammation or in the gut after a meal (14McKnight G.M. Duncan C.W. Leifert C. Golden M.H. Br. J. Nutr. 1999; 81: 349-358Google Scholar, 15Weitzberg E. Lundberg J.O.N. Nitric Oxide Biol. Chem. 1998; 2: 1-7Google Scholar), suggest this reaction is plausiblein vivo. Recently, Panasenko et al. (24Panasenko O.M. Briviba J. Klotz L.O. Sies H. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1997; 343: 254-259Google Scholar) demonstrated protein modification, low density lipoprotein oxidation, and β-carotene and α-tocopherol depletion by NO2−and HOCl mixtures. NO2− also enhanced formation of some DNA base damage products in HOCl-treated isolated calf thymus DNA (35Whiteman M. Spencer J.P.E. Jenner A. Halliwell B. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 257: 572-576Google Scholar) as well as in DNA isolated from human bronchial epithelial cells exposed to HOCl (32Spencer J.P.E. Whiteman M. Jenner A. Halliwell B. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2000; 28: 1039-1050Google Scholar). The majority of reports thus far have focused on the potentiation of oxidative and chlorinative reactions of HOCl by NO2−, and the data on nitration of phenolics have been conducted on cell media or buffer (23Eiserich J.P. Hristova M. Cross C.E. Jones A.D. Freeman B.A. Halliwell B. Van der Vliet A. Nature. 1998; 391: 393-397Google Scholar, 24Panasenko O.M. Briviba J. Klotz L.O. Sies H. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1997; 343: 254-259Google Scholar) rather than the effects on cells themselves. The extent to which NO2Cl penetrates the cell membrane and reacts with intracellular tyrosine residues to contribute to the tyrosine nitration observed in the diverse and large number of human diseases is unknown. The relatively fast rate of reaction and high concentrations of NO2− in vivo also confers HOCl-scavenging abilities on NO2−, such as inhibition of HOCl-mediated anti-microbial activity (36Klebanoff S.J. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 1993; 14: 351-360Google Scholar, 37Kono Y. Bioch. Mol. Biol. Int. 1995; 36: 275-283Google Scholar, 38Marcinkiewicz J. Chain B. Nowak B. Grabowska A. Bryniarski K. Baran J. Inflamm. Res. 2000; 49: 280-289Google Scholar) and cell toxicity (28Whiteman M. Hooper D.C. Scott G.S. Koprowski H. Halliwell B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2002; 99: 12061-12066Google Scholar). Therefore, using two human cells lines as models of human cells exposed to RNSin vivo, the extent of tyrosine nitration induced by HOCl/NO2− was investigated using several established analytical techniques. Using several monoclonal and polyclonal commercial antibodies, substantial nitrotyrosine formation was observed only when cells or cells lysates were exposed to ONOO− added at sublethal concentrations (100 μm). No formation of 3-nitrotyrosine was observed by Western blot with enhanced chemiluminescence detection (Fig. 2) in either cells or cell lysates exposed to HOCl/NO2−. Similarly, tyrosine nitration was only detected with ONOO−-treated cells using these antibodies with flow cytometric or confocal microscopic analysis. In support, Sampson et al. (20Sampson J.B. Ye Y. Rosen H. Beckman J.S. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1998; 356: 207-213Google Scholar) also failed to detect tyrosine nitration by Western blot in homogenates of horse hearts exposed to HOCl/NO2−, but substantial nitrotyrosine formation was observed when the homogenates were exposed to ONOO−. It is unlikely that residual HOCl degraded any protein bound nitrotyrosine formed, as we recently reported in vitro (42Whiteman M. Halliwell B. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 258: 168-172Google Scholar) for the following reasons: 1) NO2− reacts with HOCl rapidly (pH 7.2, 25 °C, 7.4 ± 1.3 × 103m−1 s−1) (24Panasenko O.M. Briviba J. Klotz L.O. Sies H. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1997; 343: 254-259Google Scholar); 2) analysis of buffers after experimentation showed NO2− to be oxidized to NO3− (this reaction is stoichiometric (1 mol of NO2− consumed by 1 mol of HOCl to give 1 mol of NO3−) (24Panasenko O.M. Briviba J. Klotz L.O. Sies H. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1997; 343: 254-259Google Scholar, 28Whiteman M. Hooper D.C. Scott G.S. Koprowski H. Halliwell B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2002; 99: 12061-12066Google Scholar); and 3) the time course of exposure used was short (5 min). HOCl-mediated loss of 3-nitrotyrosine in proteins over the same time is negligible (42Whiteman M. Halliwell B. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 258: 168-172Google Scholar). The presence of a variety of protease inhibitors during Western blotting and ELISA and fixation in ethanol for flow cytometry and confocal microscopy techniques should have inhibited any endogenous nitrotyrosine-removing entities. In any case these reactions appear slow and incomplete such as those observed in dog prostate tissue (39Kuo W.N. Kanadia R.N. Shanbhag V.P. Biochem. Mol. Biol. Int. 1999; 47: 1061-1067Google Scholar), rat brain and heart homogenates (40Kuo W.N. Kanadia R.N. Shanbhag V.P. Toro R. Mol. Cell Biochem. 1999; 201: 11-16Google Scholar), and skin (41Greenacre S.A. Evans P. Halliwell B. Brain S.D. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 262: 781-786Google Scholar). Furthermore, the positive control (ONOO−-treated cells) performed adequately in each technique used. Similarly, over this short time period there was negligible loss of cell viability. However, for confocal microscopy, even dead cells would have been fixed and would have immunostained positively for nitrotyrosine if it had been formed. The possibility that the levels of tyrosine nitration are too low for each of the four separate techniques employed cannot be completely ruled out. However, the majority of the published reports dealing with tyrosine nitration in human disease have used the same techniques as described here (reviewed in Ref. 2Greenacre S.A.B. Ischiropoulos H. Free Radic. Res. 2001; 34: 541-581Google Scholar). The most commonly used detection of tyrosine nitration in human disease lesions is immunohistochemistry with colorimetric detection. This is less sensitive than fluorometric immunohistochemistry detection with confocal microscopy and flow cytometry used here. Similarly, Western blotting and ELISA are routinely used techniques (2Greenacre S.A.B. Ischiropoulos H. Free Radic. Res. 2001; 34: 541-581Google Scholar). Recently, Spencer et al. (23Eiserich J.P. Hristova M. Cross C.E. Jones A.D. Freeman B.A. Halliwell B. Van der Vliet A. Nature. 1998; 391: 393-397Google Scholar) showed a potentiation of HOCl-mediated DNA base deamination and inhibition of HOCl-mediated DNA strand breakage in HBE-1 cells with high concentrations of NO2− (1 mm) when added to high concentrations of HOCl (1 mm) followed by a prolonged period of exposure (2 h). Therefore, reactive entities from the reaction of HOCl and NO2− could penetrate the cell membrane but are unlikely to cause tyrosine nitration, because it was only observed with the positive control (100 μmONOO−) with each analytical technique used and not with mixtures of NO2− and HOCl. Therefore, it is possible that NO2Cl formed from the reaction of physiologically attainable concentrations of NO2− and HOCl in vivo contributes minimally to the formation of intracellular tyrosine nitration observed in human diseases and animal models. Consequently, the cellular nitration reported in human disease (1Halliwell B. Zhao K. Whiteman M. Free Radic. Res. 1999; 31: 651-669Google Scholar, 2Greenacre S.A.B. Ischiropoulos H. Free Radic. Res. 2001; 34: 541-581Google Scholar) is more likely to originate from ONOO−, peroxidase (18Duguet A. Iijima H. Eum S.Y. Hamid Q. Eidelman D.H. Am. J. Resp. Crit. Care Med. 2001; 164: 1119-1126Google Scholar, 20Sampson J.B. Ye Y. Rosen H. Beckman J.S. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1998; 356: 207-213Google Scholar, 23Eiserich J.P. Hristova M. Cross C.E. Jones A.D. Freeman B.A. Halliwell B. Van der Vliet A. Nature. 1998; 391: 393-397Google Scholar), or heme-mediated RNS (21Grzelak A. Balcerczyk A. Majeta A. Bartosz G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1528: 97-100Google Scholar). As with NO2Cl, the extent to which these contribute tointracellular tyrosine nitration is unknown and is currently being investigated by our laboratory. We are grateful to the National Medical Research Council of Singapore for generous research support."

No differences between mutant and wild-type enzymes were observed prior to and including open complex formation. Remarkably, the mutant enzymes produced drastically reduced levels of gal P2 abortive RNAs and increased production of full-length gal P2 RNAs relative to the wild-type enzyme, leading to greatly reduced ratios of abortive to productive RNAs. These results are attributed mainly to a decreased formation of unproductive initial transcribing complexes with the mutant polymerases and increased rates of promoter escape.

The steps in transcription initiation performed by all DNA-dependent RNA polymerases are promoter binding, DNA strand melting, RNA chain initiation and nascent RNA chain formation, and finally escape from the promoter sequences. Failure to escape from the promoter results in the production of aborted RNA transcripts and reiterative cycling through the open complex (1Johnston D.E. McClure W.R. Losick R.R. Chamberlin M.J. RNA Polymerase. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1976: 101-126Google Scholar, 2Stefano J.E. Gralla J. Biochemistry. 1979; 18: 1063-1067Google Scholar, 3Carpousis A.J. Gralla J.D. Biochemistry. 1980; 19: 3245-3484Google Scholar, 4Munson L.M. Reznikoff W.S. Biochemistry. 1981; 20: 2081-2085Google Scholar). Promoter escape appears to occur concomitantly with the release of ς70factor following the synthesis of a specific length of RNA and the conversion of the unstable initial transcribing complex to a stable elongating complex (5Hansen U.M. McClure W.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 9564-9570Google Scholar, 6Straney D.C. Crothers D.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1987; 193: 267-278Google Scholar, 7Krummel B. Chamberlin M.J. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 7829-7842Google Scholar, 8Metzger W. Schickor P. Meier T. Werel W. Heumann H. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 232: 35-49Google Scholar). Depending on the promoter, abortive RNA synthesis occurs to different degrees and can occur extensively enough that it becomes rate-limiting for the synthesis of productive RNAs (2Stefano J.E. Gralla J. Biochemistry. 1979; 18: 1063-1067Google Scholar,9Carpousis A.J. Stefano J.E. Gralla J.D. J. Mol. Biol. 1982; 157: 619-633Google Scholar). Important determinants of abortive initiation are contained along the region of melted DNA within the transcription complex encompassing the non-transcribed and the initial transcribed sequences (ITS). 1The abbreviations used are: ITS, initial transcribed sequences; RNAP, RNA polymerase; ITC, initial transcribing complex Changes in the composition of the ITS can alter the extent of productive RNA synthesis (10Kammerer W. Deuschle U. Gentz R. Bujard H. EMBO J. 1986; 5: 2995-3000Google Scholar) and cause dramatic variation in the total number of abortive events and also alter abortive probabilities from position to position within the ITS (11Hsu L.M. Methods Enzymol. 1996; 273: 59-71Google Scholar). Base residue changes specifically in the non-template strand of the −10 promoter region, which weaken or strengthen open complex stability, can lead to decreased or increased abortive probabilities, respectively (12Roberts C.W. Roberts J.W. Cell. 1996; 86: 495-501Google Scholar). Several examples of regulation at the level of promoter escape have been reported. The phage Φ29 promoter A2c was repressed by the phage regulatory protein p4 through stabilization of RNA polymerase-promoter interactions to the extent that promoter escape is reduced, and abortive transcription is increased (13Monsalve M. Mencia M. Rojo F. Salas M. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 383-391Google Scholar, 14Monsalve M. Mencia M. Salas M. Rojo F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 8913-8918Google Scholar). Alternatively, in phage P22, the Arc regulatory protein has been shown to activate transcription by increasing promoter escape through weakening the stability of open complexes (15Smith T.L. Sauer R.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 8868-8872Google Scholar). Upstream A-tracts, which activate promoter activity by improving complex formation between polymerase and promoter sequences (16McAllister C.F. Achberger E.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 11743-11749Google Scholar, 17Gartenberg M.R. Crothers D.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1991; 219: 217-230Google Scholar), can conversely inhibit the activity of a promoter presumably by stabilizing RNAP at the promoter to such a degree that it prevents efficient promoter escape (18Ellinger T. Behnke D. Bujard H. Gralla J.D. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 239: 455-465Google Scholar). In vivo, RNA polymerase bound at a consensus promoter was shown to idle excessively along the ITS and escape the promoter poorly (19Ellinger T. Behnke D. Knaus R. Bujard H. Gralla J. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 239: 466-475Google Scholar). Thus, enhancement of polymerase-promoter interactions can activate or repress promoter activity depending on whether the rate-limiting step of transcription initiation is associated with polymerase binding, open complex formation (20Roy S. Garges S. Adhya S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 14059-14062Google Scholar), or promoter escape (21Hsu L.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2002; 1577: 191-207Google Scholar). The determinants of promoter escape do not reside exclusively with the promoter sequence but also involve components of the transcription machinery, especially the ς factor. Certain mutations in region 2.2 of ς70 were found to affect promoter escape (22Ko D.C. Marr M.T. Guo J. Roberts J.W. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 3276-3285Google Scholar, 23Chan C.L. Gross C.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 38201-38209Google Scholar). We described previously (24Hernandez V.J. Cashel M. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 252: 536-549Google Scholar, 25Hernandez V.J. Hsu L.M. Cashel M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 18775-18779Google Scholar) the isolation of two mutant alleles of the gene encoding the ς70 transcription initiation factor, rpoD(P504L) andrpoD(S506F), and characterized the in vitro transcription behavior of these two mutant proteins, ς70(P504L) and ς70(S506F), reconstituted into RNA polymerase holoenzyme. On three bacteriophage promoters, T7 A1, T5 N25, and T5 N25antiDSR, the mutant enzymes transcribed to yield a reduced amount of abortive RNA chains compared with the wild-type polymerase without increasing the abundance of full-length RNA chains. These mutant enzymes behaved similarly at the λP R promoter (26Sen R. Nagai H. Hernandez V.J. Shimamoto N. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 9872-9877Google Scholar), and it was determined that ς70(P504L) and ς70(S506F) RNA polymerases do not accumulate the so-called “moribund” complexes, the nonproductive complexes that yield only abortive products (27Kubori T. Shimamoto N. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 256: 449-457Google Scholar). Thus, a lower tendency to form moribund complexes by these mutant polymerases appears to bring about a lower production of abortive RNAs predominantly (26Sen R. Nagai H. Hernandez V.J. Shimamoto N. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 9872-9877Google Scholar). These results do not fulfill the expectation that a lowered tendency to form non-productive complexes should increase the probability of forming productive complexes, consequently resulting in increased productive transcription. To resolve this discrepancy, we extended the investigation of these mutant polymerases to other well characterized highly abortive promoters. As reported below, we found that on the E. coli gal P2 promoter, the mutant polymerases drastically reduced abortive transcription while greatly stimulating productive RNA synthesis when compared with the wild-type enzyme. Subsequently, we determined the various transcription initiation constants to pinpoint the basis of this altered transcription property. The cloning of rpoD+,rpoD(P504L), andrpoD(S506F) and the overexpression and purification of ς70, ς70(P504L), and ς70(S506F) proteins have been described (25Hernandez V.J. Hsu L.M. Cashel M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 18775-18779Google Scholar). Core RNA polymerase was purchased from EpiCentre Technologies (Madison, WI). Holoenzyme was reconstituted by mixing ς70 with core RNA polymerase at a ratio of 5:1 and incubating at room temperature for 15 min immediately prior to use in the transcription reactions. The minicircle DNA template bearing thegal P1 and P2 promoters was prepared as described (28Choy H.E. Adhya S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 472-476Google Scholar). Abortive initiation assays to measure the lag times for τ-plot analysis (29McClure W.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1980; 77: 5634-5638Google Scholar) were performed in potassium chloride buffer (40 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.9; 10 mm magnesium chloride; 100 mm potassium chloride; 1 mm dithiothreitol; 100 μg/ml acetylated bovine serum albumin) with 2 nm of template DNA per reaction and different concentrations of RNA polymerase holoenzyme added to initiate transcription. Thegal P2-specific initiating dinucleotide ApU was present at 500 μm plus 10 μm[α-32P]UTP (specific activity of 15 cpm per fmol). Abortive initiation products were resolved on a 7 m urea, 20% polyacrylamide gel (acrylamide:N,N′-methylenebisacrylamide = 59:1) (30Goodrich J.A. McClure W.R. J. Mol. Biol. 1992; 224: 15-29Google Scholar) to verify formation of the appropriate abortive products. Extensive quantification at different polymerase concentrations was determined as a percentage of the total radioactivity incorporated following ascending paper chromatography as described (30Goodrich J.A. McClure W.R. J. Mol. Biol. 1992; 224: 15-29Google Scholar). The radioactivity on paper chromatograms was quantitated with the radioanalytic imaging system from Ambis (San Diego, CA). The average time for open complex formation, τobs, corresponds to the lag prior to the final steady-state rate of product formation and was determined by least square fit of the data to the theoretical exponential equation derived by Hawley and McClure (31Hawley D.K. McClure W.R. J. Mol. Biol. 1982; 157: 493-525Google Scholar). Apparent binding and isomerization constants (K B(app) andk f(app)) were solved by least square fit of the data to the classical derivation of McClure (29McClure W.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1980; 77: 5634-5638Google Scholar). Curve fitting was accomplished with the SigmaPlot program (Jandel Scientific, San Rafael, CA). Steady-state transcription reactions were performed in potassium glutamate buffer (20 mm Tris acetate, pH 7.8; 10 mm magnesium acetate; 100 mm potassium glutamate; 10 mm β-mercaptoethanol) with 10, 20, 50, or 100 μm [γ-32P]ATP (specific activity of 50 cpm per fmol), GTP, CTP, and unvarying UTP (at 10 μm) for 10 min at 37 °C in a reaction volume of 20 μl. Reactions were initiated by mixing 50 nm RNA polymerase holoenzyme together with 2 nm template plus nucleoside triphosphates all prewarmed to 37 °C for 2 min. Single-round transcription kinetics (Fig. 7) were performed by mixing RNAP (20 nm) with template (2 nm) followed by preincubation for 5 min prior to the simultaneous addition of heparin (25 μg/ml) with 100 μm ATP, GTP, CTP, and 10 μm [α-32P]UTP (specific activity of 50 cpm per fmol) in a reaction volume of 100 μl, and 10-μl aliquots were removed at subsequent times. Reactions were stopped, precipitated, resuspended, and treated as described previously (25Hernandez V.J. Hsu L.M. Cashel M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 18775-18779Google Scholar). Abortive RNAs were analyzed by electrophoresis of 1/4 of each sample on a 7m urea, 25% polyacrylamide gel (acrylamide:N,N′-methylenebisacrylamide = 12.5:1). Electrophoresis and buffer conditions were as described before (25Hernandez V.J. Hsu L.M. Cashel M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 18775-18779Google Scholar). Full-length RNAs were separated on a 7 m urea, 6% polyacrylamide gel (19:1) using a conventional Tris borate-EDTA buffer (TBE) system. Radioactivity was quantified using a Storm PhosphorImager and ImageQuant program version 4.2 from Amersham Biosciences. An excess of RNA polymerase holoenzyme (100 nm) was mixed with template (2 nm) in potassium chloride buffer (above) in a volume of 100 μl and incubated at 37 °C for 10 min to allow the formation of open complexes. Heparin or poly[d(AT)] was then added to RNA polymerase-template mix to a final concentration of 25 μg/ml. At subsequent times aliquots of 10 μl were removed and mixed with an equal volume of a pre-warmed chase mixture (400 μm ATP, GTP, CTP; 10 μm [α-32P]UTP (200 cpm per fmol); 25 μg/ml sodium poly[d(AT)] or sodium heparin). Transcription reactions were carried out for an additional 5 min at 37 °C and then stopped by mixing with 5 μl of 70% formamide, 100 mm EDTA, 1× TBE, 0.025% bromphenol blue, and 0.025% xylene cyanol. Full-length RNAs were analyzed and quantified as described above. An initial or zero time point was taken prior to the addition of heparin or poly[d(AT)]. GreA and GreB were purified from the Escherichia coli strain JM109 bearing the GreA and GreB overexpression plasmids, pDNL278 and pGF296, respectively, as described (32Hsu L.M. Vo N.V. Chamberlin M.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 11588-11592Google Scholar). Missense allelesrpoD(P504L) and rpoD(S506F) contain single amino acid substitutions of leucine for proline and phenylalanine for serine at residues 504 and 506, respectively, in subregion 3.2 of ς70 (Fig.1); subregion assignment within region 3 is based on the structural domains identified in the Thermus thermophilus RNAP holoenzyme crystal structure of Vassylyevet al. (41Vassylyev D.G. Sekine S. Laptenko O. Lee J. Vassylyeva M.N. Borukhov S. Yokoyama S. Nature. 2002; 417: 712-719Google Scholar) rather than the original assignment based on sequence alignment (44Lonetto M. Gribskov M. Gross C.A. J. Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 3843-3849Google Scholar). Proline 504 and serine 506 are 2 of only 10 residues in region 3 that are invariant among the primary ς factors (Fig. 1). The gal P1 and P2 promoters have been extensively characterized in vitro with respect to RNA polymerase binding, rate of open complex formation, abortive RNA synthesis, and promoter escape (28Choy H.E. Adhya S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 472-476Google Scholar, 30Goodrich J.A. McClure W.R. J. Mol. Biol. 1992; 224: 15-29Google Scholar, 33Herbert M. Kolb A. Buc H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 2807-2811Google Scholar). The activity of gal P1 is limited by promoter binding (33Herbert M. Kolb A. Buc H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 2807-2811Google Scholar), whereas that of gal P2 is intrinsically limited at the step of promoter escape (28Choy H.E. Adhya S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 472-476Google Scholar). The gal P1 promoter lacks an identifiable −35 promoter element; however, polymerase binding is aided by an extended −10 promoter element (34Chan B. Busby S. Gene (Amst.). 1989; 84: 227-236Google Scholar). The gal P2 promoter has both the −35 and −10 elements with a non-optimal spacing of 16 bp in addition to an extended −10 promoter element (35Ponnambalam S. Chan B. Busby S. Mol. Microbiol. 1988; 2: 165-172Google Scholar) (Fig.2). Following binding at galP2 there is extensive “idling” or abortive cycling of polymerase along the initial transcribed sequences prior to promoter escape. The probability that an RNA chain initiated at P2 is aborted rather than extended is estimated to be greater than 95%. For reasons that are unclear, abortive yields are especially high at specific sites,i.e. at positions +2, +3, and +6, within the initial transcribed sequence of gal P2 (28Choy H.E. Adhya S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 472-476Google Scholar) (Fig.3). In addition, at high UTP concentrations polymerase tends to “stutter” at the run of three U residues encoded in the initial sequence ATTTC of gal P2 after initiating at the normal A residue start site (36Jin D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 17221-17227Google Scholar). Stuttering refers to the nonproductive mode of reiterative incorporation of UMP producing poly(U) RNA chains that are released at a variety of lengths and can grow to hundreds of nucleotide residues (37Liu C. Heath L.S. Turnbough Jr., C.L. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 2904-2912Google Scholar). At low UTP concentrations, this stuttering does not occur. This substrate dependence is one feature that distinguishes stuttering from the normal abortive RNA synthesis; the latter occurs readily at low and high nucleotide concentrations (11Hsu L.M. Methods Enzymol. 1996; 273: 59-71Google Scholar).Figure 3Complete RNA synthesis reactions on gal P1 and P2. A, the production of naturally abortive RNAs and full-length terminated RNAs arising from the mini-gal template was visualized. Transcription was performed as described under “Experimental Procedures” with increasing concentrations of ATP, GTP, and CTP as indicated with UTP held constant at 10 μm. Abortive RNA species were separated on a 25% polyacrylamide gel and full-length RNAs on a 6% polyacrylamide gel (see “Experimental Procedures”). RNA was labeled with [γ-32P]ATP. Length of RNAs are labeled as follows:2, dimer; 3, trimer; 4, tetramer; etc.(P1)120 = gal P1 and (P2)125= gal P2 transcripts.

Adhya S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 472-476Google Scholar) was used to generate a supercoiled minicircle template containing only thegal P1 and P2 promoters upstream of a single Rho-independent terminator. This “mini-gal” template specifies the transcription of short abortive RNAs as well as a 120- and 125-nucleotide RNA originating from gal P1 and P2, respectively, without contaminating RNAs arising from endogenous promoters, a limitation usually encountered when using regular supercoiled plasmids as templates. Multiple roundin vitro transcription reactions were performed in the presence of all four NTPs to determine the continuous production of abortive and productive gal RNAs (11Hsu L.M. Methods Enzymol. 1996; 273: 59-71Google Scholar). We used increasing concentrations (10–100 μm) of ATP, GTP, and CTP and a fixed concentration of UTP (10 μm); the UTP concentration was kept low to prevent polymerase stuttering (see above). Because bothgal P1 and P2 initiate with an A residue, the transcripts were all 5′-labeled at a constant specific activity with [γ-32P]ATP. End labeling of RNA transcripts has the advantage of allowing direct stoichiometric comparison of radioactivity incorporated into different RNA species regardless of size. The wild-type RNA polymerase transcribes gal P1/P2 to yield an abortive RNA ladder up to a length of 7 nucleotides and the terminated P1 and P2 RNA of 120 and 125 nucleotides, respectively (Fig.3 A). The abortive RNAs arise predominantly fromgal P2 because very little difference in abortive products was observed from a mini-circle template bearing a gal P1 knock-out mutation (28Choy H.E. Adhya S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 472-476Google Scholar). With the wild-type enzyme, the level of abortive and productive RNA synthesis increased concomitantly with increasing NTP concentration, suggesting that the abortive pattern did not result from NTP substrate limitation. Rather, a higher concentration of NTP supported a higher frequency of initiation, with a fraction of the initiated chains becoming productive RNA and the remainder abortive. Compared with the wild-type enzyme, mutant polymerases accumulated many fewer abortive RNA chains and more full-length RNA chains from bothgal promoters (Fig. 3 A). The reduction of abortive RNA chains appears to be differentially affected by the mutant polymerases. The dimer RNA is reduced about 40%, and the trimer and hexamer RNAs are reduced by 4- and 10-fold, respectively (Fig.3 B). Relative reduction of abortive RNA by the mutant RNA polymerases at all positions along the initial transcribed sequence ofgal P2 is indicated with downward arrows in Fig.3 C. The mutant RNA polymerases also gave rise to increased accumulation of both gal P1 and P2 transcripts. The abundance of full-length RNA chains produced by mutant enzymes is higher by about 2-fold forgal P1, 4-fold for gal P2, and 3-fold overall (Fig. 3 B). Several interesting comparisons can be made on the changes in productive synthesis. On a number of promoters tested previously, the ς70 mutant polymerases showed reduced abortive transcription but no increase of productive synthesis (25Hernandez V.J. Hsu L.M. Cashel M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 18775-18779Google Scholar,26Sen R. Nagai H. Hernandez V.J. Shimamoto N. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 9872-9877Google Scholar); thus, increased productive synthesis, which can be equated with an enhanced ability at promoter escape, by the mutant enzymes appears to be a promoter-dependent phenomenon. We further noticed that at low NTP concentrations with the wild-type enzyme, P1 was the predominant full-length transcript, but at higher NTP concentrations, P1 and P2 RNA achieved parity. This observation can be explained by the excessive idling of wild-type polymerase at the P2 promoter relative to P1 (28Choy H.E. Adhya S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 472-476Google Scholar), and the extent of idling was reduced when NTP concentration was raised. For the mutant enzymes, however, P2 was the more abundant productive RNA at all NTP concentrations. Thus, the ς70mutations seemed to have brought about two effects on gal P2 transcription, overcoming an NTP concentration-dependent ability at escape and increasing the intrinsic rate of promoter escape. To compare further the abortive and productive synthesis by the wild-type and mutant enzymes, we plotted the abortive and productive yields (see Ref. 11Hsu L.M. Methods Enzymol. 1996; 273: 59-71Google Scholar; i.e. the mole fraction of abortive and full-length RNA per total product) and abortive probabilities at each position along the initial transcribed sequence of gal P2 (Fig. 4). This revealed aspects of mutant enzyme behavior not obvious from the data in Fig. 3. The abortive yield (Fig. 4 A) of dimer RNA is actually greater for the mutant polymerases, that of trimer and hexamer RNA is significantly reduced, and other abortive RNAs are represented by about equal yields. Full-length gal P2 RNA is increased from 1% of total RNA for the wild-type enzyme to ∼6 and 5% for P504L and S506F ς70 containing holoenzyme, respectively (Fig.4 A). Abortive probabilities were determined at each position by correcting the percentage of each abortive RNA chain by the fraction of polymerases that actually advanced to that position. This revealed that the wild-type and mutant enzymes had very similar overall probabilities of producing abortive RNAs of 5 nucleotides or shorter. Most pronounced differences occurred at +6 and +7 where the probabilities of forming the 6- and 7-mer abortive transcripts were reduced 50–70% for the mutant enzymes (Fig. 4 B). Perhaps not coincidentally, these positions correspond to the maximum length of RNA synthesized prior to escape and thus likely demarcate the positions where the initial transcribing complex makes the transition to an elongating complex. Taken together, the above analysis allows us to conclude that the mutant polymerases are more facile at promoter escape, thus producing fewer abortive RNA and more full-length RNA. To gain insight into the differential transcriptional outcome during RNA synthesis fromgal P2 by wild-type and ς70 mutant enzymes, we determined and compared the various transcription initiation constants for these enzymes. First, we evaluated whether the ς70mutants could affect the general process of promoter binding or open complex formation by determining the apparent equilibrium binding constant, K B, and the forward rate constant,k f, of open complex formation at the galP2 promoter. This was done by the steady-state abortive initiation assay using a subset of nucleoside triphosphates followed by the derivation of τ plots (29McClure W.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1980; 77: 5634-5638Google Scholar, 30Goodrich J.A. McClure W.R. J. Mol. Biol. 1992; 224: 15-29Google Scholar). Because the binding of polymerase atgal P1 and P2 is mutually exclusive, we specifically determined the apparent K B and k fvalues (K B(app) andk f(app)) only for P2 by using the initiating dinucleotide ApU and [α-32P]UTP. These limited substrates permit the synthesis of only the trimer (pApUpU) and tetramer (pApUpUpU) RNAs, the production of which was verified by PAGE (Fig. 5 A). By monitoring the length of time required for the appearance of RNA following the addition of enzyme to template and substrates, the average lag time (τobs) for polymerase binding and open complex formation was measured at five different enzyme concentrations to determineK B and k f values for the wild-type and mutant enzymes. At the low polymerase concentrations the steady-state rate of trimer and tetramer RNA production was lower for the P504L mutant than the wild-type enzyme (Fig. 5 B). However, τobs was approximately the same at all RNA polymerase concentrations (Fig. 5 C). Similarly for the S506F mutant, limited measurements at low and high polymerase concentrations revealed approximately the same τobs value (data not shown). From τobs, we obtained the values forK B(app) andk f(app) according to Goodrich and McClure (30Goodrich J.A. McClure W.R. J. Mol. Biol. 1992; 224: 15-29Google Scholar); these values are 10.5 ± 1.2 × 106m−1 and 9.76 ± 0.4 × 10−2 s−1 for both the wild-type and the mutant enzymes. Thus, the mutant polymerases appear to bind promoter and form open complexes normally on gal P2. A correlation between lower open complex stability and increased rates of productive RNA synthesis was originally noted for mutant lacpromoter variants (9Carpousis A.J. Stefano J.E. Gralla J.D. J. Mol. Biol. 1982; 157: 619-633Google Scholar). In its simplest interpretation, this correlation suggests the notion that the formation of a stable open complex and promoter escape are antagonistic processes. We next examined the stability of pre-formed open complexes of wild type, and mutant ς70 polymerases on gal P1 and P2 were monitored in the presence of a nonspecific competitor, heparin or poly[d(AT)]. Open complexes were formed in the absence of NTP using a 50-fold molar excess of RNA polymerase to template to maximize promoter occupancy. Heparin was added next, and the promoter occupancy ofgal P1 or P2 was assayed at subsequent times by adding high concentrations of NTP and monitoring the production of full-length RNA. The wild-type enzyme formed very stable open complexes on thegal promoters as found previously (33Herbert M. Kolb A. Buc H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 2807-2811Google Scholar). After 2 h, only about 5–20% of the wild-type open complexes had dissociated from either gal P1 or P2 (Fig. 6). By contrast, the mutant polymerases exhibited a 50% loss of thegal P1 and gal P2 open complexes at ∼80 and 40 min, respectively, after the addition of heparin ("
https://openalex.org/W1987382663,"The major DNA cytosine methyltransferase isoform in mouse erythroleukemia cells, Dnmt1, exhibits potent dead-end inhibition with a single-stranded nucleic acid by binding to an allosteric site on the enzyme. The previously reported substrate inhibition with double-stranded substrates also involves binding to an allosteric site. Thus, both forms of inhibition involve ternary enzyme-DNA-DNA complexes. The inhibition potency of the single-stranded nucleic acid is determined by the sequence, length, and most appreciably the presence of a single 5-methylcytosine residue. A single-stranded phosphorothioate derivative inhibits DNA methylation activity in nuclear extracts. Mouse erythroleukemia cells treated with the phosphorothioate inhibitor show a significant decrease in global genomic methylation levels. Inhibitor treatment of human colon cancer cells causes demethylation of thep16 tumor suppressor gene and subsequent p16 re-expression. Allosteric inhibitors of mammalian DNA cytosine methyltransferases, representing a new class of molecules with potential therapeutic applications, may be used to elucidate novel epigenetic mechanisms that control development. The major DNA cytosine methyltransferase isoform in mouse erythroleukemia cells, Dnmt1, exhibits potent dead-end inhibition with a single-stranded nucleic acid by binding to an allosteric site on the enzyme. The previously reported substrate inhibition with double-stranded substrates also involves binding to an allosteric site. Thus, both forms of inhibition involve ternary enzyme-DNA-DNA complexes.

DNA cytosine methyltransferase 5-aza-deoxycytidine (decitabine) mouse erythroleukemia cells S-adenosylmethionine cAMP-response element methyl-specific PCR 5-methylcytosine residue The patterns of DNA cytosine methylation in mammals evolve throughout development (1Nakao M. Gene. 2001; 278: 25-31Google Scholar). This essential process regulates imprinted genes, X chromosome inactivation, the inactivation of repetitive elements, and the expression of tissue-specific genes (2Futscher B.W. Oshiro M.M. Wozniak R.J. Holtan N. Hanigan C.L. Duan H. Domann F.E. Nat. Genet. 2002; 31: 175-179Google Scholar, 3Robertson K.D. Wolffe A.P. Nat. Rev. Genet. 2000; 1: 11-19Google Scholar). Methylated DNA is recognized by several proteins and assembled into transcriptionally silent chromatin structures. Gene regulatory regions, including normally undermethylated CpG islands, become hypermethylated with age and in tumors, thereby repressing the expression of essential genes (2Futscher B.W. Oshiro M.M. Wozniak R.J. Holtan N. Hanigan C.L. Duan H. Domann F.E. Nat. Genet. 2002; 31: 175-179Google Scholar, 4Laiho P. Launonen V. Lahermo P. Esteller M. Guo M. Herman J.G. Mecklin J.P.

These and other observations have motivated and continue to motivate the development of DCMTase inhibitors as potential “epigenetically based” drugs (2Futscher B.W. Oshiro M.M. Wozniak R.J. Holtan N. Hanigan C.L. Duan H. Domann F.E. Nat. Genet. 2002; 31: 175-179Google Scholar, 6Szyf M. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 2001; 22: 350-354Google Scholar, 7Brown R. Strathdee G. Trends Mol. Med. 2002; 8 (suppl.): S43-S48Google Scholar). Thus, antisense oligonucleotides that interfere with DCMTase expression inhibit tumor formation (8Szyf M. Ramchandani S. MacLeod A.R. Pinard M. von Hofe E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 684-689Google Scholar), and the cancer drug 5-aza-deoxycytidine (5AC; decitabine) functions by inhibiting DCMTase (9Jones P.A. Taylor S.M. Wilson V.L. Recent Results Cancer Res. 1983; 84: 202-211Google Scholar, 10Jones P.A. Laird P.W. Nat. Genet. 1999; 21: 163-167Google Scholar). 5AC virtually abolished adenoma formation in mice genetically prone to colon tumors (11Laird P.W. Jackson-Grusby L. Fazeli A. Dickinson S.L. Jung W.E. Li E. Weinberg R.A. Jaenisch R. Cell. 1995; 81: 197-205Google Scholar). 5AC is a clinically administered mechanism-based inhibitor of DCMTase. Unfortunately, it may be too carcinogenic and mutagenic for most applications (10Jones P.A. Laird P.W. Nat. Genet. 1999; 21: 163-167Google Scholar). Targeting DCMTase function with novel inhibitors has great therapeutic potential, and novel regulators could help elucidate the aspects of epigenetic control that occur throughout development (2Futscher B.W. Oshiro M.M. Wozniak R.J. Holtan N. Hanigan C.L. Duan H. Domann F.E. Nat. Genet. 2002; 31: 175-179Google Scholar, 6Szyf M. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 2001; 22: 350-354Google Scholar, 12Jones P.A. Baylin S.B. Nat. Rev. Genet. 2002; 3: 415-428Google Scholar). The major eukaryotic DCMTase, Dnmt1, has been cloned and sequenced from at least five animal sources: mouse, human, chicken, frog, and sea urchin (13Bestor T.H. Gene. 1988; 74: 9-12Google Scholar, 14Yen R.-W.C. Vertino P.M. Nelkin B.D. Yu J.J. El-Eeiry W. Cumaraswamy A. Lennon G.G. Trask B.J. Celano P. Baylin S.B.

Several variants have been identified that arise from separate gene loci and alternatively spliced mRNAs (1Nakao M. Gene. 2001; 278: 25-31Google Scholar, 3Robertson K.D. Wolffe A.P. Nat. Rev. Genet. 2000; 1: 11-19Google Scholar). Dnmt1 is the largest DCMTase, with a molecular mass of 184 kDa. The smaller C-terminal domain shares sequence homology with all DCMTases and contains all or the majority of the residues required for catalysis. Mammalian methylation occurs predominately within the context of the CpG dinucleotide. The N-terminal domain contains a phosphorylation site (18Glickman J.F. Pavlovich J.G. Reich N.O. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 17851-17857Google Scholar) as well as zinc (19Bestor T. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 2611-2617Google Scholar), nucleic acid (20Flynn J. Reich N.O. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 15162-15169Google Scholar, 21Flynn J. Azzam R. Reich N.O. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 279: 101-116Google Scholar, 22Bacolla A. Pradhan S. Roberts R.J. Wells R.D. J. Biol.

The large N-terminal domain is likely to play an active role in the complex interplay with several proteins including histone deacetylases and other Dnmts, leading to the active restructuring of chromatin (1Nakao M. Gene. 2001; 278: 25-31Google Scholar). A previous report postulating such protein-protein interactions proposed that the substrate inhibition of Dnmt1 at high DNA concentrations results from the loss of activating Dnmt1-Dnmt1 interactions with adjacent enzyme molecules on the same DNA scaffold (25Hitt M.M. Wu T.-L. Cohen G. Linn S. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 4392-4399Google Scholar). Early evidence indicated that Dnmt1 binds a second DNA molecule at an unidentified allosteric site (20Flynn J. Reich N.O. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 15162-15169Google Scholar, 21Flynn J. Azzam R. Reich N.O. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 279: 101-116Google Scholar) and that N-terminal domain-derived peptides bind nucleic acids (26Wade P.A. Wolffe A.P. Jones P.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 96: 5894-5896Google Scholar). These interactions recently have been characterized in detail (22Bacolla A. Pradhan S. Roberts R.J. Wells R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 33011-33019Google Scholar, 27Pradhan S. Bacolla A. Wells R.D. Roberts R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 33002-33010Google Scholar, 28Kim G.D. Ni J. Kelesoglu N. Roberts R.J. Pradhan S. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 4183-4195Google Scholar, 29Jeltsch A. Christ F. Fatemi M. Roth M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 19538-19544Google Scholar). The N-terminal domain comprising the first 501 amino acids represses the methylation reaction of the human Dnmt1; this repression is relieved upon binding to methylated DNA (23Bacolla A. Pradhan S. Larson J.E. Roberts R.J. Wells R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 18605-18613Google Scholar). A similar stimulation was reported for murine Dnmt1 upon the addition of fully methylated double-stranded DNA, again leading to the proposal that the enzyme forms a ternary enzyme-DNA-DNA complex (30Fatemi M. Hermann A. Pradhan S. Jeltsch A. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 309: 1189-1199Google Scholar). Another form of allosteric Dnmt1 activation, in this circumstance involving single-stranded substrates with the potential of forming transient duplexes, has been described for oligonucleotides containing 5-methylcytosine adjacent to the CpG site that undergoes methylation (31Christman J.K. Sheikhnejad G. Marasco C.J. Sufrin J.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 747-7351Google Scholar, 32Baker D.J. Laayoun A. Smith S.S. Lingeman R.G. Riley J. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 243: 143-151Google Scholar). Many of these nucleic acid-mediated effects appear to depend on the nature of the DNA substrate upon which the enzyme is initially positioned. For example, although poly(dI·dC) and hemimethylated (CGG/CCG)12, a 36-bp fragment containing the triplet repeat sequence in which expansion in the FMR1 gene causes fragile-X syndrome, show complex kinetics consistent with DNA binding to an allosteric site, no such behavior is observed with unmethylated (CGG/CCG)12 (22Bacolla A. Pradhan S. Roberts R.J. Wells R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 33011-33019Google Scholar, 23Bacolla A. Pradhan S. Larson J.E. Roberts R.J. Wells R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 18605-18613Google Scholar). The biological role most frequently invoked for allosteric regulation of Dnmt1 via DNA binding is in the context of “methylation spreading,” a process leading tode novo DNA methylation of previously ummethylated regions (30Fatemi M. Hermann A. Pradhan S. Jeltsch A. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 309: 1189-1199Google Scholar, 34Tollefsbol T.O. Hutchison III, C.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 269: 494-504Google Scholar, 35Orend G. Kuhlmann I. Doerfler W. J. Virol. 1991; 65: 4301-4308Google Scholar, 36Toth M. Müller U. Doerfler W. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 214: 673-683Google Scholar). This bidirectional spreading, which occurs in newly integrated viral DNA (36Toth M. Müller U. Doerfler W. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 214: 673-683Google Scholar), in gene regulatory sequences during X chromosome inactivation (37Barlow D.P. Science. 1995; 270: 1610-1613Google Scholar), and during cellular immortalization (38Vertino P.M. Yen R.-W.C. Baylin S.B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 4555-4565Google Scholar), in transposed DNA sequences (39Martienssen R. Trends Genet. 1998; 14: 263-264Google Scholar), may be a threat to the success of gene therapy (40Bestor T. J. Clin. Invest. 2001; 105: 409-411Google Scholar). Our interests were to address the mechanism of the well known substrate inhibition that underlies much of the complex kinetics reported for Dnmt1 and to further characterize the interactions of the enzyme with several single-stranded DNA molecules that were previously shown to be poor substrates for the enzyme (41Flynn J. Glickman J.F. Reich N.O. Biochemistry. 1966; 35: 7308-7315Google Scholar). The enzyme binds these poor substrates with affinities comparable with substrates that are readily methylated (21Flynn J. Azzam R. Reich N.O. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 279: 101-116Google Scholar), and we hypothesized that they might act as dead-end inhibitors. A previous report of nucleic acids that bind Dnmt1 but are poor substrates showed that various single- and double-stranded nucleic acids can act as inhibitors (42Bolden A. Ward C. Siedlecki J.A. Weissbach A. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 12437-12443Google Scholar). Here we report the mechanism of action of one such single-stranded inhibitor and demonstrate its ability to inhibit methylation in vitro. S-Adenosyl-l-[methyl-3H]methionine (75 Ci/mmol, 1 mCi/ ml = 37 GBq) was purchased fromAmersham Biosciences. Unlabeled AdoMet (Sigma) was further purified as described (43Reich N.O. Mashhoon N. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 8966-8970Google Scholar). Routinely, 125 μm AdoMet stocks were prepared at a specific activity of 5.8 × 103 cpm/pmol. Two lots of poly(dI·dC-dI·dC) were purchased from Amersham Biosciences, with an average length of 6250 and 5000 base pairs. DE81 filters were purchased from Whatman. LipofectAMINE was purchased from Invitrogen. Other standard chemicals and reagents were purchased from Sigma or Fisher Scientific. Oligonucleotides were synthesized by Research Genetics (Huntsville, AL) and HPLC-purified on a Dynamax PureDNA column (Rainin Instrument Co.) according to the manufacturer's specifications. Oligonucleotides were stored in 10 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 1 mm EDTA. The following sequences were prepared (GC-box pMET, LC2, and the antisense sequence (8Szyf M. Ramchandani S. MacLeod A.R. Pinard M. von Hofe E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Concentrations were determined using calculated coefficients, and the annealing of GC-boxa/b was as described previously (41Flynn J. Glickman J.F. Reich N.O. Biochemistry. 1966; 35: 7308-7315Google Scholar). Dnmt1 was isolated from mouse erythroleukemia cells (MEL cells) as described (41Flynn J. Glickman J.F. Reich N.O. Biochemistry. 1966; 35: 7308-7315Google Scholar). Filter binding assays monitored the incorporation of tritium-labeled methyl groups into DNA. Reaction and dilution buffers and filter processing were described previously (20Flynn J. Reich N.O. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 15162-15169Google Scholar). Incubations were at 37 °C for 60 min. Each point represents the average of at least two reactions. Initial velocity data were collected with a 6250-base pair poly(dI·dC) and a 30-base pair GC-boxa/b substrate. The poly(dI·dC) concentrations were ∼2.0, 4.0, 8.0, 16, 35, 80, 160, 250, 400, 700, and 1000 picomolar in duplex DNA; Dnmt1 was 3.0 nm. The GC-boxa/bsubstrate concentrations were (0.20, 0.40, 1.0, 2.0, 4.0, 8.0, 15, 23, and 35 μm); Dnmt1 was 100 nm. Initial velocity data were collected with poly(dI·dC), AdoMet, GC-boxb, and GC-boxbMET at the concentrations indicated in Fig. 2 legend. Dnmt1 was either 3 or 4 nm (see Fig. 2 legend), AdoMet was 10 μm when added as the nonchanging substrate, and poly(dI·dC) was 50 pm when added as the nonchanging substrate. IC50 determinations with GC-boxbMET, GC-boxpMET, GC-boxcMET, GC-boxdMET, GC-boxeMET, and CRE used 4 nm Dnmt1 and 50 pmpoly(dI·dC). Oligonucleotide concentrations ranged between 5-fold lower and 5-fold higher than the IC50. MEL nuclear extracts were prepared as described previously (41Flynn J. Glickman J.F. Reich N.O. Biochemistry. 1966; 35: 7308-7315Google Scholar). Freshly made nuclear extract (2 μl) was combined with 12.5 μm tritiated AdoMet, 1 nmpoly(dI·dC), and varying concentrations of oligonucleotides in a volume of 20 μl at 37 °C. The reaction was stopped after 60 min, and label incorporation into DNA was determined as described (41Flynn J. Glickman J.F. Reich N.O. Biochemistry. 1966; 35: 7308-7315Google Scholar). MEL cells, prepared as described (41Flynn J. Glickman J.F. Reich N.O. Biochemistry. 1966; 35: 7308-7315Google Scholar) to a density of 106/ml, were treated with inhibitors (7.7 μm GC-boxpMET, 1.5 μm 5AC, or 18 μm antisense oligonucleotide) along with LipofectAMINE as described by the manufacturer. The mock treatment used TE (Tris, pH 8.0 (10 mm), and EDTA, 1 mm) in place of any inhibitor. The inhibitors or the mock were added only at the initiation of the experiment, and genomic DNA was isolated after 72 and 110 h of cell culture. 5-Methylcytosine content was determined as described (44Cedar H. Solage A. Glaser G. Razin A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1979; 6: 2125-2132Google Scholar). Briefly, MspI endonuclease was used to digest the genomic DNA, and the samples were then treated sequentially with calf intestinal alkaline phosphatase, T4 polynucleotide kinase (and [γ-32P]ATP), and P1 nuclease. The 32P end-labeled cytosines, either 5-mCMP or CMP within the CpG of the MspI ends, were separated on cellulose thin layer chromatography plates. A PhophorImager (Amersham Biosciences) was used to visualize and quantify the percent 5-methylcytosine. Each reported result is the average of at least two independent determinations. HT29 cells were plated at 50% confluence in six-well plates and treated with 5AC at 1 μm or LipofectAMINE-transfected with either 10 μm GC-boxbMET or LC2 control oligonucleotides for 48–72 h. The LC2 control is identical to GC-boxbMETwith the four central bases converted to adenines. DNA was isolated using the Qiagen blood and cell culture DNA kit (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Methyl-specific PCR (MSP) was performed as described previously (45Herman J.G. Graff J.R. Myohanen S. Nelkin B.D. Baylin S.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 9821-9826Google Scholar) using primers described therein. Peripheral blood lymphocytes were used as a positive control for unmethylated p16, and peripheral blood lymphocyte DNA, methylated in vitro using SssI methylase (New England Biolabs) according to the manufacturer's instructions, was used as a positive control for methylated p16. RNA was isolated using Trizol (Invitrogen). cDNA was prepared from 1 μg of RNA using a Superscript II reverse transcription system with random hexamers as primers (Invitrogen). PCR was performed using primers forp16 designed to cross a splice junction in the gene (GenBankTM accession number L27211), 5′-ATC ATC AGT CAC CGA AGG TC-3′ (sense) and 5′-CCA CAT GAA TGT GCG CTT AG-3′ (antisense), on 1 μl of cDNA product. The reaction was initiated with a 3-min incubation at 94 °C followed by 35 amplification cycles (94 °C for 30 s, 58 °C for1 min, 72 °C for 1 min) and a final 10 min extension step of 10 min yielding a 355-bp product following electrophoresis on a 1.5% agarose gel. The gel was stained with ethidium bromide and photographed. Expression of β-actin was used as a standard for RNA integrity and equal gel loading. Primers for β-actin were 5′-GGA GTC CTG TGG CAT CCA CG-3′ (sense) and 5′-CTA GAA GCA TTT GCG GTG GA-3′ (antisense). Amplification was the same as p16 with the exception of using an annealing temperature of 60 °C and 27 amplification cycles. The original observation by Linn and co-workers (25Hitt M.M. Wu T.-L. Cohen G. Linn S. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 4392-4399Google Scholar) that hemimethylated duplex plasmid DNA and single-stranded DNA are inhibitory at high concentrations was explained with an interesting model in which Dnmt1 associates with itself upon the DNA scaffold at low ratios of DNA to enzyme, thereby activating the enzyme. Monomeric enzyme-DNA complexes are stabilized with excess substrate, thus leading to a loss of the activated form. An alternative explanation for this behavior at high DNA concentrations is the formation of an inhibitory ternary complex involving the enzyme and two or more DNA molecules. Although recent reports provide data consistent with this alternative explanation (23Bacolla A. Pradhan S. Larson J.E. Roberts R.J. Wells R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 18605-18613Google Scholar, 30Fatemi M. Hermann A. Pradhan S. Jeltsch A. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 309: 1189-1199Google Scholar), we sought to provide a simple probe of the underlying mechanism. Fig. 1 shows our results with a large multi-site 6250-bp poly(dI·dC) substrate and a short 30-bp GC-boxa/b duplex containing a single CpG site. The GC-boxa/b duplex is an excellent substrate for Dnmt1 and contains an Sp1 transcription factor recognition element (41Flynn J. Glickman J.F. Reich N.O. Biochemistry. 1966; 35: 7308-7315Google Scholar). We and others have demonstrated that poly(dI·dC) shows inhibition at high DNA concentrations (20Flynn J. Reich N.O. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 15162-15169Google Scholar, 23Bacolla A. Pradhan S. Larson J.E. Roberts R.J. Wells R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 18605-18613Google Scholar, 46Pedrali-Noy G. Weissbach A. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 7600-7602Google Scholar), which is revealed by the data in Fig. 1. The relative velocities versusS/K m plots conveniently normalize the data between the two diverse DNA substrates. The short 30-bp duplex nearly matches the footprint of the Dnmt1-DNA complex (20Flynn J. Reich N.O. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 15162-15169Google Scholar), and we reasoned that this substrate would be precluded from stabilizing the types of complexes proposed by Linn and coworkers (25Hitt M.M. Wu T.-L. Cohen G. Linn S. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 4392-4399Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 1, the GC-boxa/b duplex shows the same form of substrate inhibition as the much larger poly(dI·dC). The poorer affinity observed with the 30-bp duplex limited our ability to take the S/K m ratio as high as with the poly(dI·dC); nevertheless, both sets of data are nicely fit to a standard equation for substrate inhibition, invoking formation of an inhibitory ternary enzyme-DNA-DNA complex (47Segel I. Enzyme Kinetics. John Wiley and Sons, New York1975Google Scholar). Our results provide compelling support for a mechanism involving the binding of a second double-stranded DNA molecule to an allosteric site on Dnmt1. The observed inhibition with the short duplex DNA (Fig. 1) is unlikely to come from the preferential stabilization of monomeric enzyme forms, because these short substrates were designed to be incapable of stabilizing such complexes under any enzyme concentrations. In this circumstance limited to unmethylated duplexes (poly(dI·dC) or GC-boxa/b), the binding of a second DNA molecule is inhibitory. We recently confirmed this result with unmethylated DNA and another assay, showing that the ternary enzyme-DNA-DNA complexes dramatically decrease the processive action of the enzyme on multi-site substrates by increasing the off-rate from the substrate DNA. 2Z. Svedruzic and N. O. Reich, submitted for publication. Such an increased off-rate could have the same effect with the single-site substrate (GC-boxa/b) if the off-rate and methylation rates are comparable. In contrast to these inhibitory allosteric effects, we and others (Ref. 30Fatemi M. Hermann A. Pradhan S. Jeltsch A. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 309: 1189-1199Google Scholar and footnote 2) have shown that methylated DNA activates Dnmt1. This occurs in trans, with 5-methylcytosine attached to DNA other than that being methylated, and incis, when introduced on the same molecule at positions adjacent to the target methylation sequence (CpG) (31Christman J.K. Sheikhnejad G. Marasco C.J. Sufrin J.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 747-7351Google Scholar,48Carotti D. Funiciello S. Palitti F. Strom R. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 1101-1108Google Scholar)). 3B. Aubol and N. O. Reich, submitted for publication. It remains unclear whether the activation and inhibition effects are mediated by nucleic acid binding to the same allosteric site. Dnmt1 shows good activity with single-stranded plasmid-derived substrates (25Hitt M.M. Wu T.-L. Cohen G. Linn S. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 4392-4399Google Scholar) and single-stranded oligonucleotides (Refs. 31Christman J.K. Sheikhnejad G. Marasco C.J. Sufrin J.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 747-7351Google Scholar and 34Tollefsbol T.O. Hutchison III, C.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 269: 494-504Google Scholar, and footnote 3); we previously determined this with single-stranded versions of CRE, a cis-regulatory transcriptional element (41Flynn J. Glickman J.F. Reich N.O. Biochemistry. 1966; 35: 7308-7315Google Scholar). Some single-stranded oligonucleotides are proposed to form transient duplexes that are then acted upon by the enzyme (31Christman J.K. Sheikhnejad G. Marasco C.J. Sufrin J.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 747-7351Google Scholar); the CRE and GC-box-derived single strands used in our study show no such behavior (41Flynn J. Glickman J.F. Reich N.O. Biochemistry. 1966; 35: 7308-7315Google Scholar). In contrast to the CRE-derived strands, single-stranded substrates mimicking the GC-box element, showed no detectable activity (41Flynn J. Glickman J.F. Reich N.O. Biochemistry. 1966; 35: 7308-7315Google Scholar) despite the ability of the enzyme to bind such sequences with good affinity (21Flynn J. Azzam R. Reich N.O. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 279: 101-116Google Scholar). We therefore speculated that the single-stranded GC-box oligonucleotides could act as dead-end inhibitors of the enzyme. We submitted GC-boxb single-stranded DNA to a detailed inhibition analysis; the double reciprocal plots are shown in Fig.2 A. The pattern of lines intersects far to the left of the y axis and is best fit by a standard equation for noncompetitive inhibition. The inhibition constants were determined to be K is = 3.6 ± 1.5 μm and K ii = 6.8 ± 1.2 μm (49Spector T. Cleland W.W. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1981; 30: 1-7Google Scholar). K ii describes the inhibition constant for the enzyme-substrate complex, andK is the inhibition constant for the free enzyme. The K ii/K is ratio is a measure of which binding event is preferred (49Spector T. Cleland W.W. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1981; 30: 1-7Google Scholar), and in this case, its value of 1.9 suggests that this inhibitor slightly favors addition to the free enzyme over the enzyme-DNA complex. Thus, the pattern shows that the free enzyme can bind to single-stranded GC-boxb, as can the binary enzyme-poly(dI·dC) complex. In both cases the enzyme is inhibited. The latter ternary complex requires that GC-boxb binds to an allosteric site. Dead-end inhibition with a CpG methylated homolog of GC-boxb, GC-boxbMET, also exhibited noncompetitive inhibition (Fig. 2 B). Remarkably, a single 5-mC substitution reduces the inhibition constant associated with the allosteric site 340-fold, asK ii = 20 ± 3 nm. The pattern of lines is visibly less convergent than in Fig. 2 A, andK ii/K is = 0.57. The unmethylated and methylated inhibitors have distinct partitioning preferences as suggested by the changes in binding affinity andK ii/K is. These results strongly suggest that GC-boxbMET and poly(dI·dC) can and do bind preferentially to distinct sites on Dnmt1, with the single methyl moiety driving that preference in the favor of the allosteric site. The initial velocity patterns obtained by varying AdoMet and GC-boxbMET concentrations were best fit to a standard equation for competitive inhibition (Fig. 2 C). The intersection of the fit lines on the 1/velocity axis,K is = 25 ± 10 nm, suggests that GC-boxbMET and AdoMet bind competitively to the same poly(dI·dC)-bound form of the enzyme but not necessarily to the same site on the enzyme. The inhibition constants determined for GC-boxbMET at the proposed allosteric site,K is in Fig. 2 C andK ii in Fig. 2 B, are in good agreement at about 30 nm. In the absence of poly(dI·dC), GC-boxbMET binds free enzyme with a dissociation constant of 880 nm (21Flynn J. Azzam R. Reich N.O. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 279: 101-116Google Scholar). Therefore, poly(dI·dC) stabilizes GC-boxbMET binding 29-fold. The binding of these duplex and single-stranded nucleic acids to a site on Dnmt1 distinct from the substrate-binding site is intriguing. The evidence for the existence of such an allosteric site is compelling: (i) the substrate inhibition described in Fig. 1 for both long and short substrates is best explained by the binding of a second DNA molecule; (ii) noncompetitive, dead-end inhibition by single-stranded oligonucleotides (Fig. 2, A and B) was dramatically enhanced when the inhibitor contained 5-methylcytosine; (iii) no inhibition with either GC-boxb or GC-boxbMET was observed with two bacterial DNA cytosine methyltransferases, M.HhaI and M.SssI (data not shown); (iv) previous product inhibition studies support a Dnmt1-DNA-DNA ternary complex (20Flynn J.

Here, we have used fluorimetric techniques to investigate the effects of chronic hypoxia (2.5% O2, 24 h) on Ca2+ stores in type I cortical astrocytes, because such stores are crucial to various astrocyte functions, including Ca2+-dependent modulation of neuronal activity. Rises of [Ca2+]i evoked by exposure of astrocytes to bradykinin were enhanced following chronic hypoxia, as were transient increases in [Ca2+]i recorded in Ca2+-free perfusate. The enhanced responses were due partly to impaired plasmalemmal Na+/Ca2+ exchange following chronic hypoxia. More importantly, chronic hypoxia increased the Ca2+ content of mitochondria (as determined by exposing cells to mitochondrial inhibitors), such that they were unable to act as Ca2+ buffers following bradykinin-evoked Ca2+ release from the endoplasmic reticulum. Hypoxic enhancement of mitochondrial Ca2+ content was also observed in confocal images of cells loaded with the mitochondrial Ca2+ indicator, Rhod-2. Confocal imaging of cells loaded with tetramethylrhodamine ethyl ester, an indicator of mitochondrial membrane potential, indicated that mitochondria were hyperpolarized in astrocytes following chronic hypoxia. Our findings indicate that hypoxia disturbs Ca2+ signaling in type I astrocytes, primarily by causing mitochondrial Ca2+ overload.

Higher brain functions are susceptible to damage through exposure to the prolonged hypoxia of ischemia or chronic cardiorespiratory disease (1Incalzi R.A. Gemma A. Marra C. Muzzolon R. Capparella O.

Indeed, there is a well documented increased incidence of dementias in patients who have previously suffered prolonged hypoxic or ischemic episodes arising as a consequence of cardiovascular dysfunction such as stroke or arrhythmia (4Tatemichi T.K.

Stroke. 1996; 27: 1283-1289Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Such a clear link between hypoxic/ischemic episodes and increased incidence of dementias strongly suggests that lack of oxygen is a contributory factor in the precipitation of such diseases. Many non-neuronal cell types (particularly astrocytes) contribute to intercellular signaling in the central nervous system at several levels (7Verkhratsky A. Orkand R.K. Kettenmann H. Physiol. Rev. 1998; 78: 99-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (590) Google Scholar, 8Bezzi P. Volterra A. Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 2001; 11: 387-394Crossref PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar, 9Bezzi P. Domercq M. Vesce S. Volterra A. Prog. Brain Res. 2001; 132: 255-265Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Astrocytes, as well as other glia, are in intimate contact with neurones and have projections that are located at neuronal synapses (10Ventura R. Harris K.M. J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 6897-6906Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Indeed, chemical synapses and gap junction connections between astrocytes and neurones have been identified (11Bergles D.E. Roberts J.D. Somogyi P. Jahr C.E. Nature. 2000; 405: 187-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (742) Google Scholar, 12Alvarez-Maubecin V. Garcia-Hernandez F. Williams J.T. Van Bockstaele E.J. J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 4091-4098Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Astrocytes possess receptors for numerous transmitters (e.g. glutamate, γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA), acetylcholine, ATP, bradykinin; reviewed in Ref. 7Verkhratsky A. Orkand R.K. Kettenmann H. Physiol. Rev. 1998; 78: 99-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (590) Google Scholar) and so play important, active roles in synaptic activity. Activation of astrocytes by transmitters released from neurones has been reported at levels of transmitter concentrations found outside (but adjacent to) synaptic clefts (13Parpura V. Basarsky T.A. Liu F. Jeftinija K. Jeftinija S. Haydon P.G. Nature. 1994; 369: 744-747Crossref PubMed Scopus (1422) Google Scholar, 14Kang J. Jiang L. Goldman S.A. Nedergaard M. Nat. Neurosci. 1998; 1: 683-692Crossref PubMed Scopus (695) Google Scholar). Astrocytic activation is usually manifest as a rise of intracellular Ca2+concentration ([Ca2+]i) due to release of Ca2+ from internal stores as well as Ca2+ uptake from the extracellular space (9Bezzi P. Domercq M. Vesce S. Volterra A. Prog. Brain Res. 2001; 132: 255-265Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar, 14Kang J. Jiang L. Goldman S.A. Nedergaard M. Nat.

This fundamental initial response correlates with neuronal synaptic activity, and a rise of [Ca2+]i in one astrocyte can initiate Ca2+ waves that propagate across significant distances via adjacent astrocytes (17Araque A. Carmignoto G. Haydon P.G. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 2001; 63: 795-813Crossref PubMed Scopus (525) Google Scholar, 18Giaume C. Venance L. Glia. 1998; 24: 50-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar, 19Pasti L. Zonta M. Pozzan T. Vicini S. Carmignoto G. J. Neurosci. 2001; 21: 477-484Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This represents a means of intercellular signaling in the brain that parallels and modulates classical neuronal synaptic communication and, as such, is of fundamental importance to central neuronal activity (8Bezzi P. Volterra A. Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 2001; 11: 387-394Crossref PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar, 20Fam S.R. Gallagher C.J. Salter M.W. J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 2800-2808Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Within an individual astrocyte, a rise of [Ca2+]i can also initiate important processes. In particular, elevated [Ca2+]i triggers glutamate release which modulates neuronal activity via extrasynaptic metabotropic glutamate receptors (19Pasti L. Zonta M. Pozzan T. Vicini S. Carmignoto G. J. Neurosci. 2001; 21: 477-484Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 21Carmignoto G. Prog. Neurobiol. 2000; 62: 561-581Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). Indeed, astrocytes are capable of releasing glutamate via regulated, Ca2+-dependent exocytosis, in addition to reverse-mode uptake systems (17Araque A. Carmignoto G. Haydon P.G. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 2001; 63: 795-813Crossref PubMed Scopus (525) Google Scholar). In the present study, we have examined how intracellular Ca2+ stores, key components in astrocyte Ca2+signaling coupled to receptor activation via generation of inositol trisphosphate, are modulated by prolonged hypoxia. Hypoxia is a key feature of numerous cardiorespiratory diseases associated with disturbance of higher brain functions (see above), and is also a well known regulator of gene expression (22Beitner-Johnson D. Shull G.E. Dedman J.R. Millhorn D.E. Respir. Physiol. 1997; 110: 87-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Our results indicate that hypoxia dramatically modulates intracellular Ca2+ stores, primarily by causing mitochondrial Ca2+ loading. To obtain astrocytes, cerebral cortices were removed from 6–8 day old Wistar rat pups and placed immediately in ice-cold buffer solution consisting of 10 mmNaH2PO4, 2.7 mm KCl, 137 mm NaCl, 14 mm glucose, 1.5 mmMgSO4, and 3 mg/ml bovine serum albumin. Meninges were removed using fine forceps, and whole cortices were then minced gently with a mechanical tissue chopper (McIlwain) and dispersed into the same buffer containing 0.25 μg/ml trypsin, at 37 °C for 15 min. Trypsin digestion was halted by the addition of an equal volume of buffer supplemented with 16 μg/ml soy bean trypsin inhibitor (SBTI, type I-S; Sigma), 0.5 μg/ml DNase I (EC 3.1.21.1 type II from bovine pancreas; 125 kilounits/ml; Sigma) and 1.5 mmMgSO4. The tissue was then pelleted by centrifugation at 1300 rpm for 90 s following which the supernatant was removed and the cell pellet resuspended in 2 ml of buffer solution containing 100 μg/ml SBTI, 0.5 μg/ml DNase I, and 1.5 mmMgSO4. The tissue was subsequently triturated gently with a fire polished Pasteur pipette. After allowing larger pieces of tissue to settle for 5 min, the cell suspension was taken and centrifuged at 1300 rpm for 90 s before resuspension into 60 ml of culture medium (Eagle's minimal essential medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum and 1% penicillin-streptomycin (GIBCO)). The cell suspension was then aliquoted into 2 × 25 cm2 flasks and onto glass cover slips in 6- and 24-well tissue culture plates. Cells were then kept in a humidified incubator at 37 °C (95% air; 5% CO2). This was designated passage 1 and cells were used up to a passage of 2. 4–6 h following plating, cells were washed vigorously several times with fresh medium to remove non-adhered cells. This resulted in a culture of primarily type I cortical astrocytes (as confirmed by positive immunostaining with an anti-GFAP antibody). Culture medium was exchanged every 3–4 days, and cells were grown in culture for up to 14 days. All recordings were made from cells between days 5–12. Cells exposed to chronic hypoxia were subcultured in the same way as control cells but 24 h prior to experimentation were transferred to a humidified incubator equilibrated with 2.5% O2, 5% CO2 balanced with N2 (termed chronically hypoxic (CH) 1The abbreviations used are: CH, chronically hypoxic; MTT, 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide; TMRE, tetramethylrhodamine ethyl ester; NCX, Na+/Ca2+ exchanger; r.u., relative units; BK, bradykinin; CPZ, cyclopiazonic acid; ER, endoplasmic reticulum; FCCP, p-trifluoromethoxy carbonyl cyanide phenylhydrazone conditions). Following exposure to hypoxia, cells were kept in room air for no longer than 1 h while microfluorimetric recordings took place. Corresponding control cells were maintained in a 95% air, 5% CO2 incubator for the same period. Cell viability was assessed using the 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) reduction assay (23Mosmann T. J. Immunol. Methods. 1983; 65: 55-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (46481) Google Scholar). Absorbency was measured using a spectrophotometer at a test wavelength of 570 nm and reference wavelength of 630 nm. Student's t test (unpaired) was used to determine the significance of differences between means, with p values of less than 0.05 being considered significant. To measure cytosolic [Ca2+], glass coverslips onto which cells had grown were incubated in 2 ml of control solution containing 4μmFura-2AM for 1 h at 21–24 °C in the dark, as previously described (24Smith I.F. Boyle J.P. Vaughan P.F. Pearson H.A. Peers C. J. Neurochem. 2001; 79: 877-884Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Control solution was composed of: NaCl 135 mm, KCl 5 mm, MgSO4 1.2 mm, CaCl2 2.5 mm, Hepes 5 mm, and glucose 10 mm (pH 7.4, osmolarity adjusted to 300 mosm with sucrose, 21–24 °C). Following this incubation period, fragments of coverslips were transferred into an 80-μl recording chamber mounted on the stage of an inverted microscope, where cells were continuously perfused under gravity at a rate of 1–2 ml min−1. [Ca2+]i was determined using an Openlab System (Image Processing & Vision Company Ltd, Coventry, UK). Excitation was provided using a Xenon arc lamp (75 watts) and excitation wavelengths (340 and 380 nm) were selected by a monochromator (Till Photonics, Planegg, Germany). A quartz fiber-optic guide transmitted light to the microscope and was reflected by a dichroic mirror (Omega Optical, Glen Spectra Ltd, Stanmore, UK) into the objective. Emission was collected through the objective and a 510-nm filter (40-nm bandwidth). Digital images were sampled at 14-bit resolution by an intensified charge-coupled device camera (Hamamatsu Photonics, Hertfordshire, UK). Fura-2 was excited alternately at 340 and 380 nm for between 120 and 180 ms (this varied on a day-to-day basis, depending on dye-loading efficiency, but never varied between control and hypoxic cells on any given day), and ratios of the resulting images were produced every 4 s. Regions of interest (ROI) were used to restrict data collection to individual cells. All the imaging was controlled by Improvision software that included Openlab 2.2.5 (Image Processing & Vision Company Ltd, UK) and operated on a Macintosh PowerPC. Drugs and agonists were applied to cells as indicated under “Results” by switching the inflow with a 6-way Hamilton tap to one supplied by a reservoir of the relevant composition. All experiments were conducted at room temperature (21–24 °C). For cytosolic [Ca2+] measurements, several parameters were determined from collected data. Changes in [Ca2+]i were taken from measuring peak or plateau values and expressing them as the change in fluorescence ratio from basal levels, determined for each recording. Decay times are expressed as t 12 valuesi.e. the time taken for a response to decline to 50% of its peak value. The size of bradykinin-evoked stores was taken from the integral of transient responses recorded in Ca2+-free perfusate. All results are expressed as means ± S.E., together with sample traces, and statistical comparisons were made using unpaired Student's t-tests. For all experiments reported, 4–8 cells in any one field of view were selected at random before the experiment was performed, and data obtained from all selected cells were included in the analysis. At least three repeats of each experiment were performed. Mitochondrial Ca2+ levels were examined using a confocal system (see below), but in cells loaded with Rhod-2 (by incubation of cells with 1.5 μm Rhod-2AM for 1 h at 21 °C-24 °C in the dark, followed by a 1 h period of maintaining cells in control perfusate solution for further dye de-esterification). Rhod-2 was only excited at one wavelength (543 nm), and emission light was collected through the objective and a 570-nm filter (40-nm bandwidth). Mitochondrial membrane potential measurements were also made, using tetramethylrhodamine ethyl ester (TMRE). To load this indicator, cell monolayers incubated in 2 ml of control solution containing 300 nm TMRE for 20 min at 21 °C-24 °C in the dark. TMRE was excited at one wavelength (546 nm), and emission light was collected through the objective and a 576-nm filter (40-nm bandwidth). During TMRE fluorescence recordings, cells were continuously perfused with the same concentration of TMRE in the presence of 1 mm ascorbate (to prevent TMRE oxidation and suppress autoquenching, Ref. 25Tsien R.Y. Waggoner A. Pawley J. Handbook of Confocal Microscopy. Plenum Press, New York1994: 267-280Google Scholar). Under these conditions photobleaching was significantly reduced, and the slow decrease in the fluorescence level caused by dye bleaching or dye loss was not considered depolarization. Changes in mitochondrial membrane potential (Δψm) were determined from groups of mitochondria using the region of interest (ROI) tool. TMRE fluorescence was not calibrated to membrane potential and so is plotted as arbitrary units (256 greyscale). Confocal images were obtained from cells plated and loaded with dye as described above. Fragments of coverslips on which cells were grown were transferred to a recording chamber as described for microfluorimetric recording. This chamber was mounted on the stage of a Zeiss Axiovert 200 m inverted microscope, equipped with a C-Apochromat ×63 water immersion lens (1.2 numerical aperture) and fitted with a Zeiss LSM 510 laser-scanning module. The 543-nm laser line of a helium/neon laser was used for excitation of either Rhod-2 or TMRE-loaded cells, and the emitted light (581 nm or 574 nm respectively) collected by photomultiplier. 8 bit images (monitored using a 256 gray scale, then converted to ΔF/F o values for comparison) were acquired as single frames (frame time 7 s), and 4 images were averaged for each frame. All experiments were performed at room temperature (21–24 °C). Loading conditions and illumination intensities and duration were kept constant for all recordings. Fig. 1 A shows representative, bright-field images of type I cortical astrocytes cultured under normoxic (upper) or hypoxic (lower) conditions. The cells were typically flat and elongated in appearance, and hypoxia did not noticeably alter their morphology. In order to examine cell viability under hypoxic conditions, we performed colorimetric MTT assays (23Mosmann T. J. Immunol. Methods. 1983; 65: 55-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (46481) Google Scholar), and found that hypoxia (24–48 h) had no significant effect on cell viability as compared with cells cultured under normoxic conditions (Fig. 1 B). Basal Ca2+ levels (determined before bradykinin (BK) application) were not significantly different between chronically hypoxic (CH) and control cells, being 0.53 ± 0.03 r.u. in control cells (n > 12) and 0.58 ± 0.02 in CH cells (n > 12). When astrocytes were perfused with a solution containing 2.5 mm Ca2+, bath application of 100 nm BK evoked a rapid rise of [Ca2+]i due to release of Ca2+ from internal stores mediated by production of inositol trisphosphate, which declined with an extremely slow time course in both control and CH cells (Fig. 1 C). This slow decline is likely due to Ca2+ influx (see Fig. 2, below). Full concentration-response relationships are presented in Fig. 1 D, which indicates that the EC50 for BK was similar in both groups of cells, at ∼5 nm. However, it was notable that peak BK-evoked responses were consistently greater in CH cells. Since the peak of the response reflects Ca2+release from intracellular stores, rather than subsequent Ca2+ influx, the rest of the study employed Ca2+-free perfusates (containing 1 mm EGTA) to examine release from stores in isolation, and we selected 100 nm BK as a maximally effective agonist concentration. In Ca2+-free solution, responses to 100 nm BK were transient in both control (Fig. 2 A, left) and CH (Fig. 2 A, right) cells. However, a clear enhancement of responses was observed in CH cells. The bar graphs of all measured parameters are presented in Fig. 2 B. Thus, as was the case in Ca2+-containing perfusate, basal levels recorded in Ca2+-free solution were not significantly different in the two cell groups. The peak rise of [Ca2+]i and the total amount of Ca2+ liberated by BK (determined by integration of the transient response) were both significantly greater in CH cells. Finally, a significant slowing of the decay rate was also observed in CH cells, as compared with controls. The enhancement of BK-evoked rises of [Ca2+]i seen in CH cells could have been due to a more complete discharge of Ca2+ from internal stores in this cell group, or due to CH cells having a greater store size. To investigate this, we discharged intracellular stores completely, by exposing cells to 10 μm cyclopiazonic acid (CPZ). We found in these cells that this agent depleted stores more rapidly than the irreversible Ca2+-ATPase inhibitor, thapsigargin. As illustrated in the sample traces of Fig. 3 A and the mean data of Fig. 3 B, the amount of Ca2+ discharged from intracellular stores was clearly significantly greater in CH cells than in controls. In addition, subsequent application of BK following depletion of stores with either CPZ (Fig. 3 C) or thapsigargin (Fig. 3 D) failed to evoke a rise in [Ca2+]i in either cell group, indicating that both CPZ and thapsigargin fully discharged intracellular stores. While the data of Fig. 2 suggest that BK-sensitive Ca2+ stores are greater in CH cells, the enhanced responses could be due to altered buffering of cytosolic Ca2+ once liberated from stores. One such mechanism to account for the transient responses of cells to BK in Ca2+-free perfusate is Ca2+ extrusion across the plasma membrane on transporters such as the Na+/Ca2+ exchanger (NCX). To investigate the role of NCX in shaping the responses to BK, we applied the agonist in Na+-free solutions (replaced with NMDG). As illustrated in Fig. 4 A and the averaged data of Fig. 4 B, this maneuver caused a small increase in the peak [Ca2+]i response, which did not reach statistical significance. However, there was a significant increase in the transient integral, due to a slowing of the time course of decay (Fig. 4 B). In CH cells, no significant differences were observed in either the amplitude or time course of the response (Fig. 4, A and B). These results indicate that NCX is not the major mechanism for Ca2+ extrusion following release from intracellular stores in astrocytes, and also that modulation of such exchange cannot account for the enhanced responses observed in CH cells. However, perhaps more importantly, the significant influence of NCX in shaping the responses seen in control cells was not present in CH cells. Recent studies have indicated that inhibition of NCX can arise due to excessive Ca2+ loading of mitochondria (26Opuni K. Reeves J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 21549-21554Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). We therefore explored the possible involvement of mitochondria in the enhancement of BK-evoked rises in [Ca2+]i. Fig. 5 A (left) illustrates a recording from a control cell, which was firstly exposed to the mitochondrial inhibitor FCCP (10 μm), which was applied together with 2.5 μg/ml oligomycin (to prevent ATP consumption by the F1F0-ATP synthase functioning in reverse mode). This caused a transient rise of cytosolic [Ca2+]. In the continued presence of FCCP and oligomycin, application of 100 nm BK evoked rises in control cells that were significantly greater than those evoked without mitochondrial inhibition (Fig. 2). Responses in CH cells (e.g. Fig. 5 A, right) differed from those seen in control cells in two important aspects. Firstly, mitochondrial inhibition caused significantly greater rises of [Ca2+]i (mean data shown in Fig. 5 B) and secondly, the subsequent application of BK evoked rises in [Ca2+]i, which were not significantly different from those observed in CH cells in the absence of mitochondrial inhibitors. It is also noteworthy that during mitochondrial inhibition, there were no significant differences in the responses to BK observed between control and CH cells, as determined by integration of the transients. Data presented in Fig. 5 suggest that the cytosolic Ca2+response to BK may be attenuated in control (but not CH) cells due to Ca2+ uptake by mitochondria. In further support of this idea, responses to 10 μm CPZ were also significantly potentiated (from 9.15 ± 0.84 r.u. (n = 14) to 19.1 ± 2.56 r.u., p < 0.002,n = 18) during mitochondrial inhibition with FCCP (10 μm) and oligomycin (2.5 μg/ml), as Fig. 6 illustrates. The enhanced response to FCCP and oligomycin observed in CH cells (Fig. 5 A, right) strongly suggested that CH caused excessive mitochondrial Ca2+ accumulation, as compared with controls. To investigate this in more detail, we examined confocal images of control and CH cells loaded with the mitochondrial Ca2+ indicator, Rhod-2. To visualize the structure of mitochondria in these cells, we firstly labeled mitochondria with Mitotracker (Fig. 7 A). Clearly, mitochondria form extensive, complex networks in both control and chronically hypoxic cells, and the mitochondrial density did not appear altered by chronic hypoxia. Fig. 7 B shows typical images taken under identically matched exposure conditions in control and CH astrocytes, at two levels of magnification. Mitochondria are evident from their distribution and shape throughout the cell (see for example Ref. 27Collins T.J. Berridge M.J. Lipp P. Bootman M.D. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 1616-1627Crossref PubMed Scopus (464) Google Scholar), although the Rhod-2 images appear more fragmented that the images obtained with Mitotracker. Clearly, fluorescence is greater in the CH cells. The dashed lines in each upper trace show the point at which a line scan was performed, and the corresponding pixel intensities are plotted in Fig. 7 C. Peaks in each trace correspond to the line scan crossing mitochondria, and such peaks are consistently greater in CH cells, reflecting a higher mitochondrial Ca2+ content. It is noteworthy that while the peaks in the line scans were greater in amplitude in CH astrocytes, the absolute number was similar, indicating that hypoxia did not increase the number or density of mitochondria. These traces were typical of at least six different images of both control and CH astrocytes. While not quantitative, these data further support the Fura-2 data of Fig. 5indicating that CH causes increased mitochondrial Ca2+loading. Accumulation of Ca2+ by mitochondria is dependent on the maintenance of the mitochondrial membrane potential, (Ψm). We therefore examined whether Ψmdiffered between control and CH cells, using the Ψmindicator, TMRE. As can be seen from Fig. 8 A, confocal images were consistently brighter in CH cells as compared with control cells. While individual mitochondria could not be resolved with the clarity found using Rhod-2 (Fig. 7), staining appeared more punctate in CH cells, consistent with greater accumulation into specific organelles. Furthermore, the regions of brightest intensity (in both control and CH cells) were found in parts of cells close to nuclei. This is also reflected in the line scan plots of Fig. 8 B (made using lines indicated in the corresponding images), where in each case peaks are seen either side of a trough in the plot which represents scanning over the nuclear region of the image. These peaks are clearly greater in the CH cells, an observation consistently seen in at least six separate experiments. We also employed TMRE to monitor fluorescent signals using conventional (non-confocal) imaging, while cells were under continual perfusion. Again, fluorescence observed in CH cells was clearly greater than in control cells, and the brightest regions of each cell were found in cytosolic areas close to the nucleus (Fig. 9 A). Despite continual loss of signal, we could also observe an increased rate of signal loss in both cell types when exposed to 10 μm FCCP in the presence of 2.5 μg/ml oligomycin (Fig. 9 A, lower traces, and Fig. 9 B). These findings strongly suggest that CH causes a hyperpolarization of ΔΨm, an effect which is most likely responsible for the increased mitochondrial accumulation of Ca2+ indicated by experiments described earlier. Cellular effects of cerebral hypoxia/ischemia have received intense interest over many years, not only because of the associated neuronal damage and death (28Choi D.W. J.

Trends Neurosci. 1995; 18: 58-60Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (870) Google Scholar), but also because prolonged, milder hypoxic episodes can lead to deleterious effects on higher brain functions (1Incalzi R.A.

The majority of studies to date have focused on the effects of hypoxia/ischemia on central neurones, with perhaps less attention given to astrocytes or other, non-neuronal cell types in the central nervous system. The importance of astrocyte function to central intercellular signaling is currently receiving increasing attention (see the Introduction), in part due to emerging awareness of their anatomical proximity and important physiological regulation of neuronal synaptic transmission (11Bergles D.E. Roberts J.D. Somogyi P. Jahr C.E. Nature. 2000; 405: 187-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (742) Google Scholar, 12Alvarez-Maubecin V. Garcia-Hernandez F. Williams J.T. Van Bockstaele E.J. J.

Since Ca2+ signaling is one of the major forms of communication between astrocytes and is also a major factor in the physiological activity of individual astrocytes, we have addressed the question of whether prolonged hypoxia can modulate such signaling, using primary cultures of rat type I cortical astrocytes, a well established system for studying astrocyte function, and their robust responses to BK (30Stephens G.J. Cholewinski A.J. Wilkin G.P. Djamgoz M.B. Glia. 1993; 9: 269-279Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 31Gimpl G. Walz W. Ohlemeyer C. Kettenmann H. Neurosci. Lett. 1992; 144: 139-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 32Sergeeva M. Ubl J.J. Reiser G. Neuroscience. 2000; 97: 765-769Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Our initial observation was that BK evoked significantly greater release of Ca2+ from intracellular stores in CH cells than was observed in control cells (Fig. 2). This was not due to altered intracellular signaling between BK receptors and Ca2+ stores, since CPZ also liberated more Ca2+from stores in CH cells (Fig. 3). Likely possibilities to account for this were that the BK-sensitive (endoplasmic reticulum; ER) stores contained greater levels of Ca2+ following chronic hypoxia or that, once liberated from the ER, Ca2+ was less efficiently cleared and so could accumulate in the cytosol to a greater concentration. Mechanisms for cytosolic Ca2+ clearance include re-uptake into ER stores or other organelles, and Ca2+ extrusion via NCX or Ca2+-ATPase. Re-uptake into the ER was deemed unlikely in the continued presence of agonist, and so we firstly investigated a possible role of NCX. This was also prompted by a recent report indicating that ongoing, acute hypoxia inhibits NCX in vascular smooth muscle (33Wang Y.X. Dhulipala P.K. Kotlikoff M.I. FASEB J. 2000; 14: 1731-1740Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Results presented in Fig. 4 indicate that in control cells, NCX plays a significant role in shaping the transient rise of cytosolic [Ca2+] when ER stores are discharged with BK. By contrast, NCX appeared to be non-functional in CH cells (Fig. 4). Thus, CH somehow appeared to inhibit NCX in cortical astrocytes. Importantly, however, the absence of functional NCX could not account fully for the enhanced cytosolic rise in [Ca2+] seen in response to BK application in CH cells. At present, the underlying mechanisms accounting for inhibition of NCX by prolonged hypoxia remain to be determined. However, a recent report has demonstrated that accumulation of Ca2+ by mitochondria specifically inhibits NCX in COS cells transfected with a bovine Na+/Ca2+ exchanger (26Opuni K. Reeves J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 21549-21554Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). On the basis of this report, we investigated the Ca2+ content of mitochondria in astrocytes. Fig. 5 clearly demonstrates that CH leads to excessive Ca2+ loading of mitochondria, as evidenced by the enhanced response to application of FCCP and oligomycin, and this observation is reinforced by the confocal images of astrocytes loaded with the mitochondrial Ca2+ indicator, Rhod-2 (Fig. 7). Additionally, the subsequent exposure to BK (and also to CPZ; Fig. 6) in the continued presence of mitochondrial inhibitors caused a markedly increased rise of cytosolic [Ca2+] in control cells, while responses in CH cells were unchanged. These data indicate that, in control astrocytes, BK-evoked rises in [Ca2+]i are limited due to Ca2+ buffering into mitochondria. This finding is in accordance with numerous studies, which have documented the close anatomical and functional interactions of mitochondria and the ER (e.g. Refs. 34Barrett E.F. J. Gen. Physiol. 2001; 118: 79-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar, 35Landolfi B. Curci S. Debellis L. Pozzan T. Hofer A.M. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 142: 1235-1243Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar, 36Rutter G.A. Rizzuto R. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2000; 25: 215-221Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). Importantly, Ca2+ buffering into mitochondria does not appear to occur in CH cells, presumably because the mitochondria in these cells already contain excessive amounts of Ca2+ and so are incapable of acquiring more. Such a suggestion is supported strongly by the Rhod-2 confocal images and associated pixel intensity lines scans of Fig. 7, which demonstrated marked increases in punctate staining in CH cells. Such mitochondrial accumulation of Ca2+ is most likely due to mitochondrial hyperpolarization (upon which mitochondrial Ca2+ accumulation is dependent), a view supported by both confocal and conventional images acquired using the indicator TMRE. This dye accumulates in mitochondria in proportion to the Ψm; the more hyperpolarized Ψm is, the more dye accumulates. Clearly, in CH cells, increased (and more punctate) fluorescence was observed which reflects a hyperpolarization of mitochondria in astrocytes following a period of prolonged hypoxia. Thus, the present study indicates that CH causes mitochondrial hyperpolarization, which is likely to account for excessive accumulation of Ca2+, although a possible additional effect of hypoxia to inhibit mitochondrial Na+/Ca2+exchange has not been discounted, and is worthy of future study. Two important consequences arise from this mitochondrial Ca2+overload: firstly, via a mechanism yet to be identified, mitochondrial Ca2+ loading inhibits the plasmalemmal NCX (see also Ref.26Opuni K. Reeves J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 21549-21554Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Secondly, Ca2+-overloaded mitochondria are unable to participate in buffering of Ca2+ liberated into the cytosol from the ER following agonist application. The mechanism(s) by which prolonged hypoxia leads to hyperpolarization of Ψm will be the focus of future work. A recent study has suggested that Ψm can be hyperpolarized by Ca2+-dependent dephosphorylation of cytochromec oxidase (37Lee I. Bender E. Kadenbach B. Mol. Cell Biochem. 2002; 234–235: 63-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). This “molecular-physiological hypothesis” (see also Ref. 38Lee I. Bender E. Arnold S. Kadenbach B. Biol. Chem. 2001; 382: 1629-1636Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar) is dependent on the mitochondrial ATP:ADP ratio, which may well be altered under hypoxic conditions. Importantly, this hyperpolarization in turn leads to increased formation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), and ROS have been suggested by others to cause irreversible inhibition of the plasmalemmal Na+/Ca2+ exchanger (39Nicholls D.G. Ward M.W. Trends Neurosci. 2000; 23: 166-174Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (478) Google Scholar), a suggestion consistent with our observed lack of NCX function seen in CH astrocytes (Fig. 4). The concept that cellular ROS levels increase during prolonged periods of hypoxia is not uncontested, but is currently gathering momentum. Recently, a number of groups have suggested that the source of increased cellular ROS during hypoxia is mitochondrial (37Lee I. Bender E. Kadenbach B. Mol. Cell Biochem. 2002; 234–235: 63-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar, 38Lee I. Bender E. Arnold S. Kadenbach B. Biol.

The present study is also in accordance with these findings, and indicates that hypoxia may increase ROS production via mitochondrial hyperpolarization. Our findings are likely to have important implications for the understanding of cellular damage and death in the central nervous system following periods of hypoxia or ischemia (44Nicholls D.G.

These results reveal the existence of a novel mechanism of Rac activation by a guanine nucleotide exchange factor and suggest that the induction by Trio of a conformational change in Rac1, in the absence of nucleotide exchange, is sufficient for enhancing its effector function.

Phagocytes utilize oxygen radicals for the killing of engulfed microorganisms (reviewed in Ref. 1Klebanoff S.J. Gallin J.I. Snyderman R.

Oxygen radicals also serve as signal transduction messengers in a variety of nonphagocytic cells (reviewed in Ref. 2Irani K. Goldschmidt-Clermont P.J. Biochem.

Gallin J.I. Snyderman R. Inflammation: Basic Principles and Clinical Correlates. 3rd Ed. J. B. Lippincott, Philadelphia1999: 769-786Google Scholar). All redox stations involved in electron flow from NADPH to O2 are found on gp91phox, and it is assumed that the redox cascade is initiated by a conformational change induced in gp91phox by interaction with one or more cytosolic proteins. These are p47phox, p67phox, p40phox, and the small GTPase Rac (Rac1 or -2). Upon stimulation of the phagocyte, they translocate to the membrane, resulting in the assembly of what is known as the NADPH oxidase complex (referred to as “oxidase”) (reviewed in Ref. 4DeLeo F.R. Quinn M.T. J. Leukocyte Biol. 1996; 60: 677-691Crossref PubMed Scopus (460) Google Scholar). The identity of the cytosolic component(s) responsible for causing the conformational change in gp91phox is controversial. The principal candidate is p67phox, based on the identification of an “activation domain” in p67phox, consisting of residues 199–210 (5Han C.-H. Freeman J.L.R. Lee T. Motalebi S.A. Lambeth J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 16663-16668Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar), and on direct evidence of binding of p67phox to gp91phox, an interaction enhanced by Rac1 (6Dang P.M.-C. Cross A.R. Babior B.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 3001-3005Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). This hypothesis also implies that p47phox and Rac serve either as “carriers” for p67phox from the cytosol to the membrane or, following their own translocation, as membrane “anchors” for the correct positioning of p67phox in the assembled complex. Oxidase assembly can be elicited in vitro in a cell-free system consisting of phagocyte membranes and the cytosolic components p47phox, p67phox, and Rac, exposed to an anionic amphiphile (7Bromberg Y. Pick E. Cell. Immunol. 1984; 88: 213-221Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar, 8Abo A. Boyhan A. West I. Thrasher A. Segal A.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 16767-16770Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The role of the amphiphile is to induce a conformational change in p47phox, resulting in its binding to p22phox and the passive translocation of p67phox , by virtue of its affinity for p47phox, to the vicinity of gp91phox. Thein vivo equivalent of amphiphile action is the phosphorylation of critical serines in p47phox, a process representing the starting point of a “p47phox -initiated” pathway of oxidase activation. Under certain conditions, oxidase activation in vitro is also possible in the absence of p47phox. Originally, this was achieved in an amphiphile-dependent cell-free system by having recombinant p67phox and Rac present at micromolar concentrations (9Freeman J.L. Lambeth J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 22578-22582Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar, 10Koshkin V. Lotan O. Pick E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 30326-30329Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). A characteristic of earlier versions of the amphiphile-activated cell-free system is the use of bacterially expressed recombinant Rac, which did not undergo C-terminal geranylgeranylation (prenylation). We recently described oxidase activation in vitro in a system consisting of phagocyte membranes, p67phox and prenylated Rac1, in the absence of amphiphile and p47phox (11Gorzalczany Y. Sigal N. Itan M. Lotan O. Pick E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 40073-40081Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Amphiphile- and p47phox-independent oxidase activation could also be achieved in mixtures of membrane and a chimeric [p67phox-Rac1] construct prenylated at the C terminus of the Rac1 segment (12Gorzalczany Y.

The N-terminal fragment of Trio (residues 1225–1537) and the N1406A/D1407A mutant of this protein were expressed in E. coli as N-terminal His6-tagged fusion proteins and purified by metal affinity chromatography, as described before (21Zhang B.

Casey P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 23465-23470Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Bound nucleotides were liberated from recombinant Rac1 preparations as described before (24Bromberg Y. Shani E. Joseph G. Gorzalczany Y. Sperling O. Pick E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 7055-7058Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). They were identified and quantified by HPLC on a Partisil 10 SAX anion exchange column (250 × 4.6 mm) (Whatman), as described in Ref. 25Hartwick R.A. Brown P.R. J. Chromatogr. 1975; 112: 651-662Crossref Scopus (197) Google Scholar. Briefly, nucleotide standards or nucleotides liberated from recombinant or other proteins were injected into the column in a volume of 0.5 ml. This was followed by delivering 0.007 m KH2PO4, pH 4.0, at 1.5 ml/min for 15 min, followed by a linear gradient from 0.007m KH2PO4, pH 4.0, to 0.25m KH2PO4 and 0.5 m KCl, pH 4.5, at 1.5 ml/min over a period of 45 min, and continuing the high molarity buffer for an additional 40 min at the same flow rate. The column eluate was monitored by passage through a diode array detector, set at 220–450 nm (MD-1510, Jasco, Easton, MD). The amounts of nucleotides were determined by peak integration (based on absorbance at 254 nm) and related to 5-nmol amounts of the following nucleotide standards: AMP, GMP, ADP, GDP, ATP, and GTP. Nonprenylated Rac1, Cdc42Hs, and [p67phox-Rac1] chimera 3 were prenylatedin vitro by recombinant geranylgeranyltransferase type I, as recently described (12Gorzalczany Y. Alloul N. Sigal N. Weinbaum C. Pick E. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 18605-18610Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Prenylated Rac1 was subjected to nucleotide exchange to GTPγS, as described before (11Gorzalczany Y. Sigal N. Itan M. Lotan O. Pick E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 40073-40081Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Activation of oxidasein vitro supported by prenylated Rac1 was assessed by measuring NADPH-dependent O 2⨪ production in a semi-recombinant cell-free system, in the absence of an amphiphilic activator and of p47phox, essentially as described earlier (11Gorzalczany Y.

Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 7147-7156Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). The components of the assay were added to 96-well microplates, in the following order: TrioN or buffer, prenylated Rac1, a mixture of solubilized membrane and p67phox, and assay buffer in a total volume of 200 μl. The mixture was incubated for 90 s at 25 °C, and 240 μm NADPH was added to initiate O 2⨪ production. The concentration of membrane was constant throughout all the experiments and corresponded to 5 nmcytochrome b 559 heme; the concentrations of TrioN, prenylated Rac1, and p67phox were varied and are indicated under “Results.” Most experiments were performed in the assay buffer used by this laboratory before (18Shpungin S. Dotan I. Abo A. Pick E. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 9195-9203Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), which contains 1 mm MgCl2. In some experiments, assay buffers containing 0.4 μm and 4 mm free Mg2+ were used; these were prepared by adding EDTA and MgCl2 to the basic assay buffer in amounts calculated as described in Ref. 27Sunyer T. Codina J. Birnbaumer L. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 15447-15451Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar. The ability of TrioN to perform guanine nucleotide exchange on Rac1 and Rac1 mutants was assayed by the increase in fluorescence (excitation = 361 nm; emission = 440 nm), consequent to the uptake of the fluorescent GTP analog mant-GTP by Rac1, as described in Ref. 28Worthylake D.K. Rossman K.L. Sondek J. Nature. 2000; 408: 682-688Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar. Briefly, 1 μm Rac1 or Rac1 mutants were incubated with 0.375 μm mant-GTP at 20 °C in a magnetically stirred thermostated cuvette in a model FP-750 spectrofluorometer (Jasco, Easton, MD) in 20 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.4, also containing 150 mm NaCl and 4 mmMgCl2. This was followed by the addition of 0.5 μm TrioN, and the kinetics of change in fluorescence was recorded over time. It is generally assumed that recombinant small GTPases produced in E. coli are in the GDP-bound form. We put this hypothesis to a direct test by determining the nature and amount of nucleotide bound to native recombinant Rac1. As illustrated in Fig. 1 B, the only nucleotide identified on Rac1 was GDP, and it was present at a ratio of 1.046 ± 0.064 mol GDP/mol Rac1 (mean ± S.E. of five experiments). We have shown before that the procedure employed to liberate the nucleotides bound to Rac did not lead to degradation of GTP to GDP (24Bromberg Y. Shani E. Joseph G. Gorzalczany Y. Sperling O. Pick E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 7055-7058Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Further proof for the reliability of the procedure was offered by the finding that Rac1 mutant Q61L, known to hydrolyze GTP poorly (29Xu X. Barry D.C. Settleman J. Schwartz M.A. Bokoch G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 23569-23574Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), was found indeed to contain 0.8 mol of nucleotide/mol of Rac1, of which 83.5% was GTP and 16.5%, GDP (mean of two determinations) (Fig. 1 C). The fact that a major part of mutant Q61L shall remain in the GTP-bound state throughout protein purification was predicted by Xu et al. (30Xu X. Wang Y. Barry D.C. Chanock S.J. Bokoch G.M. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 626-632Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar) and is now proven unequivocally. All other recombinant Rac1 mutants, used in the experiments to be described, were found to contain exclusively bound GDP (results not shown). We found earlier that prenylated Rac1 exchanged to either GTPγS or GDPβS supported oxidase activation in the amphiphile- and p47phox-independent cell-free system with equal potency (11Gorzalczany Y. Sigal N. Itan M. Lotan O. Pick E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 40073-40081Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). In those experiments, Rac1 was subject to nucleotide exchange at low Mg2+ concentration achieved by metal chelation by EDTA. The original purpose of the experiments, having led to the findings described in this report, was to study the effect of “enzymatic” as opposed to “chemical” nucleotide exchange on prenylated Rac1 to GTP on its ability to support oxidase activation. We first examined the ability of prenylated native Rac1 (found to contain only GDP and, therefore, to be referred to as Rac1-GDP) to activate the oxidase in the amphiphile- and p47phox-independent cell-free system. As seen in Fig. 2 A, only a modest, dose-dependent, activation was found. We next assessed the effect of inducing nucleotide exchange on Rac1 to GTP, in a manner closest to the physiological mechanism, by using a GEF. For this purpose, we chose Trio, a GEF containing two distinct guanine nucleotide exchange domains, specific for Rac1 and Rho (17Debant A. Sierra-Pages C. Seipel K. O'Brien S. Tang M. Park S.-H. Streuli M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 5466-5471Crossref PubMed Scopus (399) Google Scholar,31Bellanger J.-M. Lazaro J.-B. Diriong S. Fernandez A. Lamb N. Debant A. Oncogene. 1998; 16: 147-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). A recombinant N-terminal segment of Trio (residues 1225–1537), including the Rac1-specific N-terminal Dbl homology (DH) and pleckstrin homology (PH) domains, to be referred to as TrioN, was found to stimulate GDP to GTP exchange on Rac1 (21Zhang B. Zhang Y. Wang Z. Zheng Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 25299-25307Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). The ability of TrioN to modulate oxidase activation by prenylated Rac1-GDP was assayed in the presence of exogenous GTPγS and, as a control, in its absence. Surprisingly, TrioN exhibited a pronounced potentiating effect on oxidase activation by prenylated Rac1-GDP in the absence of added GTPγS (Fig. 2 A). Oxidase activation by prenylated Rac1-GDP, in the presence of TrioN and in the absence of exogenous GTPγS, reached a V max of 69.5 ± 2.9 mol O 2⨪/s/mol cytochrome b 559 heme, compared with 31.3 ± 1.4, in the absence of TrioN; EC50 values were 5.1 ± 2.1 nm Rac1, in the presence of TrioN, and 69.8 ± 12.1, in its absence (means ± S.E. of three experiments for each group). Paradoxically, in the presence of exogenous GTPγS (5 μm), TrioN did not potentiate oxidase activation by prenylated Rac1-GDP (Fig. 2 A). Oxidase activation by prenylated Rac1-GDP and TrioN, in the presence of added GTPγS, was not significantly different from that in the absence of TrioN and GTPγS (V max = 37.7 ± 2.4 mol O 2⨪/s/mol cytochrome b 559 heme; EC50 = 168.7 ± 28.3 nm Rac1, representing means ± S.E. of three experiments). Dose-response studies indicated that inhibition of TrioN-enhanced oxidase activation by GTPγS was evident at 0.5 μm GTPγS and was complete at 5 μm (results not shown). The enhancing effect of TrioN was seen only in the presence of both prenylated Rac1 and p67phox (Table I) and was related to the relative concentrations of Rac1 and p67phox present in the reaction. Thus, significantly higher activities were obtained when p67phox was in excess over Rac1 than when the two components were present in equimolar amounts (results not shown). TrioN was inactive when heat-denatured and had no effect on prenylated Cdc42Hs-GDP, a Rho subfamily GTPase lacking oxidase-activating ability (Table I). p67phox could be replaced by p67phoxtruncated at residue 212, although both the basal and the TrioN-enhanced activity were lower than in the presence of non-truncated p67phox (Fig. 2 B). This suggests that the tetratricopeptide repeat region, involved in binding of p67phox to Rac (32Koga H. Terasawa H. Nunoi H. Takeshige K. Inagaki F. Sumimoto H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 25051-25060Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar), and the activation domain (5Han C.-H. Freeman J.L.R. Lee T. Motalebi S.A. Lambeth J.D. J. Biol.

Open table in a new tab Cell-free NADPH oxidase activation was performed as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The concentrations of components were as follows: membrane, equivalent of 5 nm cytochromeb 559 heme; p67phox, 300 nm; prenylated Rac1-GDP (or Cdc42Hs-GDP), 300 nm; TrioN (or TrioN mutant), 300 nm. Results represent means ± S.E. of three to seven experiments for each combination of NADPH oxidase components. TrioN exhibited no enhancing effect on oxidase activation by prenylated Rac1, exchanged to GTPγS and freed of unbound nucleotide on a desalting column (Fig. 2 C). It is of interest that although the level of oxidase activation achieved with prenylated Rac1-GTPγS was higher than that measured with native Rac1 (Rac1-GDP), it was considerably lower than that found with Rac1-GDP combined with TrioN, in the absence of free GTPγS. This suggests that the conformational change(s) occurring in Rac1 as a consequence of nucleotide exchange to GTPγS might, at least in part, be different from those taking place under the influence of TrioN, although they both lead to an enhancement in the oxidase activating capacity of Rac1. TrioN had only a minor enhancing effect on oxidase activation by nonprenylated Rac1-GDP in the canonical amphiphile- and p47phox-dependent system and did not convey an activating potential to nonprenylated Rac1-GDP, known to be inactive in the absence of amphiphile and p47phox (both situations are shown in Fig. 2 D). This was not due to a requirement for prenylation for interaction of Rac1 with TrioN to take place because nonprenylated Rac1 was found to bind TrioN (20Gao Y. Xing J. Streuli M. Leto T.L. Zheng Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 47530-47541Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). We recently showed that a chimera consisting of the N-terminal 212 residues of p67phox and full-length Rac1, when prenylated and in the GDP-bound form, was capable of moderate oxidase activation in the absence of an amphiphile and p47phox (12Gorzalczany Y. Alloul N. Sigal N. Weinbaum C. Pick E. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 18605-18610Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). In marked contrast to its enhancing effect on a combination of prenylated Rac1-GDP and p67phox-(1–212) (Fig. 2 B), TrioN did not potentiate the activity of a [p67phox-(1–212)-Rac1-(1–192)] chimera in GDP-bound form (Fig. 2 E). It is possible that Rac1 chimerized to p67phox is less accessible for interaction with TrioN or less “flexible” to respond to such an interaction by a change in conformation. We performed dose-response experiments in which the concentration of either prenylated Rac1-GDP or TrioN was varied from 10 to 500 nm, although the concentration of the counterpart component was kept constant at 300 nm. As seen in Fig. 2,A and F, in both situations, plateaus were reached when the concentration of the component added in varying amounts was close to 300 nm. This is suggestive of the possibility that [Rac1-TrioN] complexes with a 1:1 stoichiometry are involved in activation, but more rigorous evidence is required to sustain such a proposal. Because of the finding that TrioN acts on Rac1 in the absence of exogenous GTP, it was essential to ensure that GTP was not introduced inadvertently into the assay as a contaminant of one of the components, or generated enzymatically by ATP-dependent conversion of GMP or GDP to GTP (33Peveri P. Heyworth P.G. Curnutte J.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 2494-2498Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Consequently, we examined the solubilized membrane preparation, recombinant baculovirus-derived p67phox, and recombinant TrioN for a possible content of ATP, GTP, GDP, or GMP. 10-mg amounts of solubilized and dialyzed membrane (corresponding to an amount 2000 times higher than that present in an individual oxidase assay mixture) and 20-nmol amounts of p67phox and TrioN (corresponding to amounts 210 times higher than the maximal amounts present in the assay mixture) were subjected to the nucleotide extraction procedure applied to Rac1. The extracts were examined for the presence and quantity of nucleotides by chromatography on a Partisil 10 SAX anion exchange column, in relation to established nucleotide standards. No adenine or guanine nucleotides were detected in any of the samples examined. We conclude that, even if the presence of GTP-generating enzymes in the only non-recombinant component present in the assay (the membrane) is suspected, no nucleotides with the potential to serve as phosphate donors or acceptors were detected. This establishes with certainty that TrioN exerts it action on Rac1-GDP independently of nucleotide exchange to GTP. It was demonstrated that specific residues on Rac1, located in the switch I and II regions, are essential for either binding of"
https://openalex.org/W2006468675,"General transcription factor 3 (GTF3) binds specifically to the bicoid-like motif of the troponin I(slow) upstream enhancer. This motif is part of a sequence that restricts enhancer activity to slow muscle fibers. GTF3 contains multiple helix-loop-helix domains and an amino-terminal leucine zipper motif. Here we show that helix-loop-helix domain 4 is necessary and sufficient for binding the bicoid-like motif. Moreover, the affinity of this interaction is enhanced upon removal of amino-terminal sequences including domains 1 and 2, suggesting that an unmasking of the DNA binding surface may be a precondition for GTF3 to bind DNA in vivo. We have also investigated the interactions of six GTF3 splice variants of the mouse, three of which were identified in this study, with the troponin enhancer. The gamma-isoform lacking exon 23, and exons 26-28 that encode domain 6, interacted most avidly with the bicoid-like motif; the alpha- and beta- isoforms that include these exons fail to bind in gel retardation assays. We also show that GTF3 polypeptides associate with each other via the leucine zipper. We speculate that cells can generate a large number of GTF3 proteins with distinct DNA binding properties by alternative splicing and combinatorial association of GTF3 polypeptides."

Most models of p53 activation postulate the stepwise recruitment by p53 of coactivators, histone acetyltransferases, and/or chromatin remodeling factors to a promoter region to facilitate the subsequent access of the general transcriptional machinery required for transcriptional induction. We demonstrate here, however, that the promoter regions for the p53 target genes, p21, 14-3-3ς, and KARP-1, exist in a constitutively open conformation that is readily accessible to DNase I. This conformation was not altered by DNA damage or by whether p53 was present or absent in the cell. In contrast, p53 response elements, which resided outside the immediate promoter regions, existed within DNase I-resistant chromatin domains. Thus, p53 activation of downstream target genes occurs without p53 inducing chromatin alterations detectable by DNase I accessibility at either the promoter or the response element. As such, these data support models of p53 activation that do not require extensive chromatin alterations to support cognate gene expression.

Peterson C.L. Crit. Rev. Eukaryotic Gene Expression. 2000; 10: 1-12Google Scholar). Almost invariably, the promoter regions of active genes are marked experimentally by hypersensitivity to restriction endonucleases (2Mai X. Chou S. Struhl K. Mol. Cell.

Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 9384-9388Google Scholar). Although this hypersensitivity can be caused by torsional or topological stress in the DNA and distortions in the chromatin structure resulting from transcription factor binding, it is generally caused by the absence of nucleosomes or their remodeling (1Krebs J.E. Peterson C.L. Crit. Rev. Eukaryotic Gene Expression. 2000; 10: 1-12Google Scholar, 4Felsenfeld G. Boyes J. Chung J. Clark D. Studitsky V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

The paucity of nucleosomes, in turn, is a direct consequence of the repressive effect that nucleosomes have on the transcriptional machinery and the requirement to alleviate that effect for productive transcription to occur (5McAndrew P.C.

Thus, inactive genes usually have promoters that are nucleosomal, are insensitive to DNase I, and are regarded as being in a closed confirmation whereas active genes usually have core promoters that are nucleosome-free, hypersensitive to DNase I, and in an open configuration. Consequently, one of the hallmarks of gene induction mechanisms is the remodeling of the nucleosomal architecture of a promoter as it is activated (5McAndrew P.C. Svaren J. Martin S.R. Horz W.

These models usually require, in response to some extracellular cue, the induction of a specific transcription factor and the subsequent interaction of that factor with its cognate response element, which is invariably a cis-acting sequence located within the minimal promoter region of the relevant target genes. These transcription factors then recruit either chromatin remodeling factors (13Hassan A.H. Neely K.E. Vignali M. Reese J.C. Workman J.L. Front.

Implicit in all of these models is the assumption that chromatin alterations at the promoter will accompany and/or are required for gene induction (16Bhaumik S.R. Green M.R.

Toxicol. 2001; 41: 367-401Google Scholar), it has become apparent that the p53 tumor suppressor lies at the heart of the matter. In particular, p53 suppresses tumorigenic growth by transcriptionally inducing genes that facilitate either survival or death of an injured cell (reviewed in Refs. 20Colman M.S. Afshari C.A. Barrett J.C. Mutat. Res. 2000; 462: 179-188Google Scholar, 21Appella E. Anderson C.W. Eur. J. Biochem. 2001; 268: 2764-2772Google Scholar, 22Woods D.B. Vousden K.H. Exp. Cell Res. 2001; 264: 56-66Google Scholar). Active p53 binds, albeit with varying affinities (23Szak S.T. Mays D. Pietenpol J.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 3375-3386Google Scholar), to consensus response elements (p53 REs) within genetic regulatory loci. p53 REs consist of tandem palindromic decamers of 5′-PuPuPuC(A/T)(A/T)GPyPyPy-3′ (where Pu represents purine and Py represents pyrimidine) (24El-Deiry W.S. Kern S.E. Pietenpol J.A. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Nat. Genet. 1992; 1: 45-49Google Scholar). Binding of p53 to p53 REs alters the expression of a host of genes (reviewed in Ref. 25El-Deiry W.S. Semin. Cancer Biol. 1998; 8: 345-357Google Scholar), which fall into five main categories and include genes 1) that act to arrest the cell cycle at G1/S and G2, 2) that are involved in the induction of the G2/M cell cycle checkpoint, 3) that are involved in DNA repair, 4) that play roles in the induction or suppression (26Hoffman W.H. Biade S. Zilfou J.T. Chen J. Murphy M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 3247-3257Google Scholar) of apoptosis, and 5) that are involved in autoregulation (20Colman M.S. Afshari C.A. Barrett J.C. Mutat. Res. 2000; 462: 179-188Google Scholar, 21Appella E. Anderson C.W. Eur. J. Biochem. 2001; 268: 2764-2772Google Scholar, 22Woods D.B. Vousden K.H. Exp. Cell Res. 2001; 264: 56-66Google Scholar). p53 is normally expressed at very low steady-state levels, because it is rapidly turned over via proteosome-mediated degradation. This degradation requires the specific MDM2-mediated ubiquitination of p53 (27Haupt Y. Maya R. Kazaz A. Oren M. Nature. 1997; 387: 296-299Google Scholar, 28Kubbutat M.H. Jones S.N. Vousden K.H. Nature. 1997; 387: 299-303Google Scholar). The disruption of the inhibitory interaction between MDM2 and p53, which can occur by phosphorylation of either MDM2 (29Khosravi R. Maya R. Gottlieb T. Oren M. Shiloh Y. Shkedy D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 14973-14977Google Scholar, 30Maya R. Balass M. Kim S.T. Shkedy D. Leal J.F. Shifman O. Moas M. Buschmann T. Ronai Z. Shiloh Y. Kastan M.B. Katzir E. Oren M. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 1067-1077Google Scholar) or p53 (reviewed in Refs. 21Appella E. Anderson C.W. Eur. J. Biochem. 2001; 268: 2764-2772Google Scholar and 31Liu Y. Kulesz-Martin M. Carcinogenesis. 2001; 22: 851-860Google Scholar), permits the opportunistic access of HAT complexes to the N terminus of p53. Binding of HATs to p53 results in acetylation of the C-terminal regulatory domain of p53, which strongly activates the latent specific DNA binding activity of p53 in vitro (32Gu W. Roeder R.G. Cell. 1997; 90: 595-606Google Scholar). The biological consequences of p53 acetylationin vivo, however, are less clear, and it has been argued that at least one important aspect of p53-HAT interactions may rather be the ability of p53 to facilitate the delivery of the HATs to the adjacent p53-inducible promoters (33Barlev N.A. Liu L. Chehab N.H. Mansfield K. Harris K.G. Halazonetis T.D. Berger S.L. Mol. Cell. 2001; 8: 1243-1254Google Scholar, 34Espinosa J.M. Emerson B.M. Mol. Cell. 2001; 8: 57-69Google Scholar) (reviewed in Ref. 35Prives C. Manley J.L. Cell. 2001; 107: 815-818Google Scholar). Indeed, the association of p53 with HATs suggests that modulation of the promoter chromatin structure may be essential for the activation of p53-responsive genes (33Barlev N.A. Liu L. Chehab N.H. Mansfield K. Harris K.G. Halazonetis T.D. Berger S.L. Mol. Cell. 2001; 8: 1243-1254Google Scholar, 34Espinosa J.M. Emerson B.M. Mol. Cell. 2001; 8: 57-69Google Scholar). Thus, implicit in many models of p53 activation is the assumption that alteration or remodeling of the nucleosomal architecture of a promoter is likely to be a critical feature of the mechanism of gene activation. We have experimentally begun to address the question of how p53 influences the chromatin structure of promoters and p53 REs of p53 target genes. Here we demonstrate that the chromatin at three separate target promoter elements was constitutively open and accessible to DNase I, regardless of whether gene expression was induced and/or whether p53 was present. In contrast, the chromatin domains of p53 REs were closed and were not altered following genotoxic stress or by p53 binding. These experiments demonstrate that p53 activation of gene expression does not require extensive chromatin alterations at either the RE or the promoter of the target gene. A set of matched p53+/+ and p53−/− HCT116 cell lines (36Waldman T. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Cancer Res. 1995; 55: 5187-5190Google Scholar, 37Bunz F. Dutriaux A. Lengauer C. Waldman T. Zhou S. Brown J.P. Sedivy J.M. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Science. 1998; 282: 1497-1501Google Scholar) were generously provided to us by Dr. Bert Vogelstein (Johns Hopkins University). All cells were cultured in McCoy's 5A medium supplemented with 100 μg/ml penicillin and streptomycin, and 2 mm l-glutamine at 37 °C with 5% CO2. RT-PCR was performed essentially as described (38Frohman M.A. Dush M.K. Martin G.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 8998-9002Google Scholar). Total RNA was isolated from p53+/+ and p53−/−HCT116 cells at 0, 2, 4, and 6 h post-IR (10 Gy) treatment via the TRIzol (Invitrogen) protocol. 5 μg of total RNA was further purified with the DNA-Free RNA kit (Zymo Research; Orange, CA), assayed for the presence of contaminating genomic DNA, and then used in downstream protocols. cDNA synthesis reactions were performed via random hexamer priming with SuperScript™ (Invitrogen) reverse transcriptase (for p21, 14-3-3ς, and β-actin) or via gene-specific priming with ThermoScript™ (Invitrogen) thermostable reverse transcriptase at 55 °C (for KARP-1, 5′-CTTATTCCCCGACCGCACCATGTTGCCGGT-3′). The cDNA from each sample was then subjected to one round of PCR amplification consisting of an initial melting step (94 °C for 5 min) followed by a number, optimized for each amplicon, of repetitive cycles consisting of denaturation at 94 °C for 30 s, annealing at 55 °C for 1 min, and extension at 72 °C for 30 s using primers (see below) specific to different exons within p21, 14-3-3ς, KARP-1, and β-actin (the latter to control for quantification of cDNA pools) messages. 26 PCR cycles were utilized for p21 and 14-3-3ς, 30 for KARP-1, and 24 for the β-actin control. Modifications of the published method (39Hecht A. Strahl-Bolsinger S. Grunstein M. Nature. 1996; 383: 92-96Google Scholar) included harvesting in phosphate-buffered saline solution, pH 7.6, and cross-linking with 2% formaldehyde. Cross-linking was quenched by addition of 125 mm glycine for 5 min followed by two ice-cold washes with phosphate-buffered saline. Cells were permeabilized in lysis buffer (50 mmHEPES-KOH, pH 7.5, 140 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1% Triton X-100, 0.1% sodium deoxycholate/protease inhibitors) and kept on ice. Chromatin was sheared by sonication until the DNA was an average length of 600–1000 bp as assessed by agarose gel electrophoresis. Cellular debris was removed by centrifugation for 5 min at 13,000 rpm and then the supernatant was centrifuged again for 15 min. A 1/20 aliquot of the cleared extract was reserved as an input control for PCR reactions, and the remaining extract was incubated overnight with antibodies at 4 °C on a rotator. 50 μl of a protein A-Sepharose slurry was added and incubated for 1.5 h at 4 °C while rotating and then the Sepharose beads were pelleted by centrifugation. The beads were then washed at room temperature twice with lysis buffer, once with lysis buffer containing 500 mmNaCl, once with wash buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 250 mm LiCl, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 1 mm EDTA), and once with 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1 mm EDTA. Beads were resuspended in 200 μl of elution buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 10 mm EDTA), and precipitated protein-DNA complexes were eluted from the antibodies/beads by incubation at 65 °C for 30 min. The resulting supernatants, along with input aliquots, were subjected to cross-link reversal by heating to 65 °C overnight followed by treatment with 100 μg of proteinase K for 2 h at 37 °C. DNA was purified by phenol/chloroform extraction followed by addition of 2 μg of glycogen carrier for EtOH precipitation with a 1/10 volume of 3m sodium acetate. Precipitated DNA was resuspended in 100 μl of water, and 1/50 of the immunoprecipitates or 1/10,000 of the input were used as templates in PCR reactions with locus-specific primers. The basic protocol has been described (40Liu J.K. Bergman Y. Zaret K.S. Genes Dev. 1988; 2: 528-541Google Scholar), and all preparatory steps were carried out at 4 °C. Briefly, 1.5 to 2 × 108 trypsinized cells were centrifuged at 2000 rpm for 10 min. The cells were washed twice by resuspension in 25 mm Mg2+/Ca2+-free phosphate-buffered saline and centrifugation at 1500 rpm for 10 min. The cells were then resuspended in freshly made douncing buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 3 mm CaCl2, 2 mm MgCl2, 0.3% Nonidet P-40) and transferred to a Dounce homogenizer. Following incubation on ice for 10 min and removal of an aliquot to quantitate cellular breakage, cells were broken apart with ∼ 6 hard strokes and checked by visual observation under a microscope. Following quantitative breakage, nuclei were isolated by centrifugation at 900 rpm for 7 min. Nuclei were washed twice in 25 ml of resuspension buffer (10 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.4, 10 mm NaCl, 3 mmMgCl2) followed by centrifugation at 900 rpm for 7 min. Nuclei were then resuspended in 1 ml of resuspension buffer, and a 25-μl aliquot was diluted into 475 μl of 1% SDS for anA 260 measurement. The nuclear stock was diluted with resuspension buffer until the A 260 of the 1:20 dilution equaled 0.5. A quenched nuclei sample was removed and added directly to cell lysis solution (Gentra Systems, Minneapolis, MN). The purified, diluted nuclei were divided into untreated and treated aliquots and warmed to 37 °C. For the untreated aliquot, an endogenous DNase I activity sample was collected at 5 min and added to cell lysis solution. For the treated aliquot, RQDNase I (∼1 μg/5 μl; Clontech) was added to a final concentration of 1 μg/ml of nuclei. Aliquots of the treated nuclei were removed at 30 s, 2 min, and 5 min and added to cell lysis solution and mixed well. Genomic DNA was isolated from each sample as described in the DNA isolation kit (Gentra Systems, Minneapolis, MN) protocol (scaled up based on cell number) and then resuspended in DNA hydration solution (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0) at 0.5 μg/μl. Genomic DNA was then analyzed by Southern blotting to detect hypersensitive sites at particular loci. All blots were performed with 10 μg of genomic DNA/lane in 0.6 to 2.0% agarose gels following treatment with the appropriate restriction enzyme(s) as shown in each figure legend. Double digestions were performed simultaneously. Following electrophoresis, agarose gels were transferred to nitrocellulose membranes as described (41Braastad C.D. Leguia M. Hendrickson E.A. Nucleic Acids Res. 2002; 30: 1713-1724Google Scholar). Hybridizations were performed according to the PerfectHyb Plus protocol (Sigma) with a 5-min prehybridization at 64 °C with sheared salmon sperm DNA followed by the addition of 32P radiolabeled probe prepared via the random hexamer Klenow synthesis Prime-It II protocol (Stratagene) and subsequently purified over a G-50 Sephadex column. Following overnight hybridizations, the blots were washed twice at room temperature with 2× SSC for 5 min, twice (once at room temperature, once at 64 °C) with 1× SSC for 10 to 20 min, and two to four times at 64 °C with 0.1× SSC. The exposure of the blots to Eastman Kodak Co. autoradiographic film at −80 °C in the presence of an intensifying screen varied from 1 h to 3 days. Antibodies used in chromatin immunoprecipitation analysis included phosphoserine 15-p53 (Cell Signaling Technology, Beverley, MA) and Ab421 and p21/WAF1 (Calbiochem) antibodies. The PCR primers used for the chromatin immunoprecipitation assays were as follows. For the KARP-1-responsive element: KP-ChIP-9, 5′-AAGATGAGGAAGAGATGGGG-3′ and KP-ChIP-10, 5′-TGAGTCAGAAGTGTGAGAGTG-3′; for the p21/WAF1-responsive element: WAF-ChIP-1, 5′-TCCACCTTTCACCATTCCC-3′ and WAF-ChIP-2, 5′-ATAACTTCTA GCTCACCACCAC-3′; and for the 14-3-3ς-responsive element: 1433-ChIP-1, 5′-AAAATCACTCACTCTCACTACCTC-3′ and 1433-ChIP-2, 5′-TTCCTGCTTATCTGCCCCAC-3′. The KARP-1 primers generate a 200-bp fragment located 380 bp distal from the RE. The p21 and the 14-3-3 primers generate 586- and 368-bp fragments that span their respective REs. DNase I hypersensitivity assay Southern blot probes were generated as follows. For p21/WAF1: the primers WAF1–1, 5′-TCCTCACATCCTCCTTCTTC-3′ and WAF1–2, 5′-CGCTCCTATACATCCAAACC-3′ were used in a PCR reaction to make an 882-bp product; for 14-3-3ς, the primers 1433–1, 5′-TGTGTAGTGCCAGGTGAAG-3′ and 1433–5, 5′-AAGGTGGAGGGGACAAAGAG-3′ were used to make a 1216-bp product. The probe used to detect the KARP-1 promoter locus was a XmaI-BglII 1064-bp restriction derived from an 1812-bp ScaI GenomeWalker (Clontech) product generated with the primers K63–3, 5′-TCTTGACACCCGAACTAAAAACTTGAC-3′ and K63–4, 5′-CTCCCTGCTCTGCCTCTCATTATTC-3′. The PCR primers used for the RT-PCR reactions were as follows: for p21, 5′-ACTGTGATGCGCTAATGGC-3′ and 5′-ATGGTCTTCCTCTGCTGTCC-3′; for 14-3-3ς, 5′-GTCTGATCCAGAAGGCCAAG-3′ and 5′-CTCCTCGTTGCTTTTCTGCT-3′; for KARP-1, 5′-CGTACAAGAAGGGAGACAAGGACCACTGAC-3′ and 5′-CTTATTCCCCGACCGCACCATGTTGCCGGT-3′; and for β-actin, 5′-ATCTGGCACCACACCTTCTACAATGAGCTGCG-3′ and 5′-CGTCATACTCCTGCTTGCTGATCCACATCTGC-3′. HCT116 is an immortalized human colon cancer cell line that is diploid, contains wild-type p53 and p21 genes, and responds normally to DNA damaging agents with respect to the induction of p53 and cell cycle arrest (36Waldman T. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Cancer Res. 1995; 55: 5187-5190Google Scholar,37Bunz F. Dutriaux A. Lengauer C. Waldman T. Zhou S. Brown J.P. Sedivy J.M. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B.

Cell. 1993; 75: 1227-1236Google Scholar). RT-PCR analysis was used to characterize the induction of mRNA for three p53-responsive genes in HCT116 cells exposed to 10 Gy of IR. The genes investigated were p21 and 14-3-3ς, which are involved in the DNA damage-inducible G1 and G2 checkpoints, respectively (reviewed in Ref. 25El-Deiry W.S. Semin. Cancer Biol. 1998; 8: 345-357Google Scholar), and KARP-1, a DNA damage-inducible isoform of the Ku86 DNA repair gene (41Braastad C.D. Leguia M. Hendrickson E.A. Nucleic Acids Res. 2002; 30: 1713-1724Google Scholar,43Myung K. He D.M. Lee S.E. Hendrickson E.A. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 3172-3184Google Scholar). β-Actin mRNA expression was used to control for the quality of the cDNA pools. In contrast to β-actin, the p21, 14-3-3ς, and KARP-1 mRNAs were expressed at low levels (Fig.1 A, lane 0) (data not shown) in normally cycling cells. Upon exposure to X-irradiation, the message levels for all three genes rose sharply in contrast to β-actin expression, which remained essentially unchanged (Fig.1 A). An isogenic HCT116 cell line in which the p53 gene had been inactivated via somatic gene targeting (p53−/−cells) (36Waldman T. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Cancer Res. 1995; 55: 5187-5190Google Scholar, 37Bunz F. Dutriaux A. Lengauer C. Waldman T. Zhou S. Brown J.P. Sedivy J.M. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Science. 1998; 282: 1497-1501Google Scholar) had very low or non-detectable resting state levels of p21, 14-3-3ς, and KARP-1 mRNAs, and no induction of any of the genes was observed following IR exposure (Fig. 1 B). This analysis revealed the expected profiles of induction, and the previously demonstrated dependence upon p53, for these well characterized p53-inducible genes. The putative promoter regions for p21 (reviewed in Ref. 44Gartel A.L. Tyner A.L. Exp. Cell Res. 1999; 246: 280-289Google Scholar), 14-3-3ς (45Prasad G.L. Valverius E.M. McDuffie E. Cooper H.L.

Nucleic Acids Res. 2002; 30: 1713-1724Google Scholar) have been identified. These promoters correspond to CpG-rich domains to which the likely start site of transcription (+1) has been mapped (Fig. 2). Multiple putative p53 REs reside within the vicinity of these promoters, and those REs that have been defined functionally as responsive are indicated (Fig.2). To investigate the chromatin structure of these p53-inducible genes, we utilized DNase I hypersensitivity assays (reviewed in Refs. 4Felsenfeld G. Boyes J. Chung J. Clark D. Studitsky V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 9384-9388Google Scholarand 49Wu C. Methods Enzymol. 1989; 170: 269-289Google Scholar). In this technique, Southern blot analysis reveals the presence or absence of a region of chromatin that is relatively open, and therefore accessible, to the endonuclease DNase I. Nuclei, prepared from wild-type HCT116 cells that had been mock treated or X-irradiated (10 Gy), were harvested and mixed with DNase I for 0.5, 2, or 5 min. Genomic DNA was then purified, subjected to the indicated restriction enzyme cleavage(s), and analyzed by Southern blotting. Probes specific to each locus (Fig. 2) were used to detect changes in the restriction enzyme cleavage patterns of DNA isolated from irradiated versus non-irradiated cells at the varying durations of endonuclease treatment. In the absence of DNA damage, the promoter regions of p21, 14-3-3ς, and KARP-1 were already hypersensitive to DNase I indicating a relatively open (i.e.non-nucleosomal) chromatin structure (see Figs. 2 and3, Non-IR). In every case, the major DNase I hypersensitive site (DHS) detected resided immediately adjacent to the transcriptional start site (+1; see Fig. 2). For p21, a second strong DHS was also detected 2 kb downstream of the transcriptional start site within intron 1 (Fig. 3, EcoRI + EcoRV digest; see also Fig. 5), but this site was not characterized further. A distinct lack of DHSs was observed at all of the p53 REs save for a few weak DHSs flanking the p53 RE in the 14-3-3ς locus (Figs. 2 and 3, Non-IR) (data not shown). To see whether the chromatin structure of these genes was altered upon DNA damage, cells were exposed to IR (10 Gy), nuclei were isolated, and DNase I hypersensitivity assays were performed again. Although the intensities of the DHSs varied somewhat from experiment to experiment, the only consistent salient difference detected between the irradiated and non-irradiated samples was that the irradiated samples were unexpectedly more resistant to nuclease digestion (Fig. 3, compare2′ of DNase I Treatment lanes for IRwith Non-IR). This trait, which is poorly understood (see “Discussion”) was not characterized further. Most importantly, no extra IR-inducible DHSs were ever observed. From these experiments we concluded that the promoter regions for p21, 14-3-3ς, and KARP-1 were constitutively open to DNase I. In addition, we concluded that none of the p53 REs were DNase I hypersensitive and that this attribute did not change immediately following X-irradiation.Figure 3An open chromatin structure which is independent of DNA damage exists over the promoters, but not the p53 REs, of p21, 14-3-3ς, and KARP-1 genes. HCT116 cells were either left untreated (Non-IR) or X-irradiated (IR; 10 Gy) and then nuclei were isolated from the cells as described under “Experimental Procedures.” These nuclei were exposed to DNase I for 30 s (30“), 2 min (2′), or 5 min (5′) and then genomic DNA was isolated, restricted with the appropriate restriction enzyme(s) (shown on the left), and subjected to Southern blot analysis using the probes indicated in Fig. 2. Sites hypersensitive to DNase I are indicated with arrows. Thethickness of the arrow corresponds approximately to the intensity of the DHS. An identical analysis for genomic DNA isolated from cells not treated with DNase I is shown on the far left of the top blot (Ctrl gDNA). In addition, the positions (in kb) of the molecular markers used for these gels are indicated on left side of each autoradiogram.

The DNase I hypersensitivity profiles at 15 min, 30 min, 1 h, or 1.5 h post-irradiation were indistinguishable from cells that were analyzed immediately following X-irradiation (Fig. 4) with the exception that once again IR-treated samples were invariably somewhat more resistant to DNase I digestion than non-IR samples (compare 0′ lanes with 15′; see Fig. 4).

Mice defective in either Fas expression or Fas-mediated apoptotic pathways are resistant to Jo2-induced lethality (4Yin X.M. Wang K. Gross A. Zhao Y. Zinkel S. Klocke B. Roth K.A. Korsmeyer J.

Injection of a caspase inhibitor protects mice against Jo2-induced apoptosis of hepatocytes and lethality (6Rodriguez I. Matsuura K. Ody C. Nagata S. Vassalli P. J. Exp. Med. 1996; 184: 2067-2072Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar). These observations suggest that hepatocytes are the primary target and that the Jo2-induced death of hepatocytes is the cause of lethality. However, freshly isolated hepatocytes are highly resistant to Jo2, displaying weak apoptosis only after prolonged incubation in the presence of cycloheximide, which facilitates Fas-mediated apoptosis (7Nishimura Y.

Thus, whereas lethality could be induced within 2 h after application, death of hepatocytes in in vitro experiments could only be induced after 12 h of treatment or more (3Ogasawara J. Fukunaga-Watanabe R. Adachi M. Matsuzawa A. Kasugai T. Kitamura Y. Itoh N. Suda T. Nagata S. Nature. 1993; 364: 806-809Crossref PubMed Scopus (1800) Google Scholar, 7Nishimura Y. Kirabayashi Y.

A. 1999; 96: 14871-14876Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar). In addition, direct binding of Jo2 to hepatocytes in vivo has not been reported. Like hepatocyte damage, massive hemorrhage in the liver invariably accompanies Jo2-induced lethality (3Ogasawara J. Fukunaga-Watanabe R. Adachi M. Matsuzawa A. Kasugai T. Kitamura Y. Itoh N. Suda T. Nagata S. Nature. 1993; 364: 806-809Crossref PubMed Scopus (1800) Google Scholar). Jo2-induced hemorrhage is highly specific, restricted only in the liver but not in other tissues whose cells often express a higher level of Fas than hepatocytes. Thus, the selective toxicity of Jo2 toward liver cannot be explained either by its Fas expression level or by the in vitro sensitivity of hepatocytes. Conversely, a direct attack of hepatocytes by Jo2 cannot explain the induction of severe hemorrhage in liver. Jo2 but not other anti-Fas mAb effectively induces lethality in mice (7Nishimura Y. Kirabayashi Y. Matsuzaki Y. Musette P. Ishii A. Nakauchi H. Inoue T. Yonehara S. Int. Immunol. 1996; 9: 307-316Crossref Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Still, the apparent liver toxicity of Jo2 has raised a serious concern regarding the use of Fas cross-linking agents as therapeutics. We noted that Jo2-mediated cytotoxicity is critically dependent on target FcγR expression. Both hepatocytes and sinusoidal lining cells express Fas, but only the latter express FcγR (10Ravetch J.V. Bolland S. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2001; 19: 275-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (1362) Google Scholar, 11Muro H. Shirasawa H. Kosugi I. Nakamura S. Am. J.

Because a co-engagement of Fas and FcγR can facilitate binding and strengthen the subsequent signaling process, we asked the question of whether the Jo2-induced lethality requires co-engagement of Fas and FcγR. We found that Jo2-induced lethality is critically dependent on host FcγRII expression. This observation and additional studies described herein provide strong evidence for a novel mechanism for Jo2-induced hepatic injury in which hemorrhage and hepatocyte death are secondary to the killing of sinusoidal lining cells, which are the primary target of Jo2 and the deciding factor for Jo2-induced lethality. In addition, this study revives the possibility of using Fas cross-linking agents that lack the FcγRII binding activity as useful therapeutic agents. Cytotoxicity assays against the FcγR+ A20 and the FcγR− variant IIA1.6 target cells (obtained from Dr. C. J. Janeway, Yale University, New Haven, CT) were conducted as described previously (13Jodo S.

Target cells (2 × 104), labeled with Na251CrO4 (PerkinElmer Life Sciences), were cultured with various doses of Jo2 (BD Biosciences) or FasL vesicle preparation (FasL VP) (13Jodo S. Hohlbaum A.

Supernatants were removed at 5 h after culture, and radioactivity (counts/min) was determined. Background release was determined by culturing cells alone. Cytotoxicity is expressed as % specific 51Cr release, which is determined by the formula: 100% × (experimental release − background release)/(total cpm released by 0.5% Nonidet P-40 − background release). Assays were carried out in duplicate, and the experiment was repeated three times. The amount of human FasL protein present in FasL VP was determined using a capture enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kit (Oncogene, Boston, MA) (14Jodo S. Xiao S. Hohlbaum A. Strehlow D.

B6, B6;129SF2/J, B6;129S-Fcgr2 tm1Rav (FcγRII KO), C57BL/6-Fcgr3 tm1Sjv (FcγRIII KO), and B6.MRL-Fas lpr mice were obtained from The Jackson Laboratory, Bar Harbor, ME. In accordance with IACUC guidelines, mice were treated under various conditions as described in the legends of the figures and tables. To determine the lethality, mice were injected intraperitoneally with various doses of Jo2 or were untreated. Mice were euthanized at the time that the Jo2-treatedB6 mice became moribund. Tissues were fixed with 10% paraformaldehyde and photographed. Sera were collected and assayed for aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) using a commercial kit (Sigma). In some experiments, mice were euthanized at various times after injection of Jo2. Livers were fixed and examined for apoptotic cells using the in situ apoptosis detection kit (Trevigen, Inc., Gaithersburg, MD). To determine the role of FcγR and target radiosensitivity in the Jo2-induced lethal fulminant hepatitis, B6 and FcγRII KO mice were irradiated with 600 rads and used 4 days later. In some experiments, mice were reconstituted 24 h before the injection of Jo2 withB6 splenic cells (108/mouse) by intravenous injection of single cell suspension prepared from B6 spleen cells. In other experiments, mice were injected intravenously with purified, FcγR-specific 2.4G2 or control rat Ig (Jackson ImmunoResearch, Atlanta, GA) 2 h before the intraperitoneally injection of Jo2. Both B6 and FcγRII KO mice, 3 mice per group, were injected with d-Gal (0.5 g/kg body weight) plus bacterial LPS (50 μg/kg body weight) intraperitoneally as described (15Leist M. Gantner F. Boblinger I. Tiegs G. Am. J. Pathol. 1995; 146: 1220-1234PubMed Google Scholar, 16Morikawa A. Sugiyama T. Kato Y. Koide N. Jiang G.Z. Takahashi K. Tamada Y. Yokochi T. Infect. Immun. 1996; 64: 734-738Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Neither agent alone induced lethality. Mice were observed for 24 h. Sera and tissues of moribund mice were collected. Samples of control mice were collected at the same times when moribund mice were euthanized. We tested Jo2 anti-Fas mAb for FcγR-dependent cytotoxicity using 51Cr-labeled, FcγR+ A20 and FcγRII− variant IIA1.6 cells (derived from A20) as targets in a 5-h cytotoxicity assay (Fig.1). Jo2 effectively killed FcγR+ A20 cells but not IIA1.6 cells (Fig.1 a). Both targets were equally sensitive to FasL VP, the apoptosis-inducing membrane vesicles that induce cell death independent of target FcγR expression (Fig. 1 b). In addition, the killing of FcγR+ A20 targets by Jo2 was inhibited by 2.4G2 mAb that blocks Fc binding to FcγRII and FcγRIII (17Ravetch J.V. Luster A.D. Weinshank R. Kochan J. Pavlovec A. Portnoy D.A. Hulmes J. Pan Y.C. Unkeless J.C. Science. 1986; 234: 718-725Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar, 18Araujo-Jorge T. Rivera M.T. el Bouhdidi A. Daeron M. Carlier Y. Infect. Immun. 1993; 61: 4925-4928Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The control rat IgG2b did not inhibit the killing (Fig. 1 c). In addition, 2.4G2 did not inhibit FasL VP-mediated killing (Fig.1 d). These results indicate that the acute cytotoxicity of Jo2 depends on FcγR binding. Because 2.4G2 blocked both FcγRII and FcγRIII, we determined whether Jo2 induces lethality in FcγRII KO mice (B6;129S-Fcgr2 tm1Rav) or FcγRIII KOmice (C57BL/6-Fcgr2 tm1Sjv). Control groups included B6129SF2/J, B6, and B6.MRL-Fas lpr mice. FcγRII KO mice were completely resistant to Jo2, including those treated with a high dose of Jo2 (5 mg/kg body weight, Table I). In contrast, almost all of the control B6;129SF2/Jmice died even when treated with a lower dose of Jo2 (1.5 mg/kg body weight). In addition, all of the FcγRIII KO mice died after injection of a lower dose of Jo2.B6.MRL-Fas lpr mice were resistant to the high dose of Jo2 (5 mg/kg body weight). Thus, Jo2-induced lethality requires the presence of FcγRII+ and Fas+ cells and correlates with FcγR-dependent cytotoxicity in vitro.Table IThe Jo2-induced lethality depends on host FcγRII expressionStrainJo2 dosageMortalitymg/kg·body weightdeath/totalB61.53/4B653/3B6;129SF2/J1.54/4FcγRII KO1.50/4FcγRII KO50/2FcγRIII KO1.53/3B6.MRL-Faslpr50/3Mice, 5–7 weeks old, were weighed and injected, intraperitoneally, with various doses of Jo2.

The fatality was usually observed within 7 h. All survived mice were followed up for additional 3 days and all remained alive. To exclude the possibility that FcγRII KO mice are inherently resistant to death-inducing regimens that cause liver damage, they were tested with a bacterial peritonitis/endotoxin shock model in which lethality is induced by injecting d-Gal and LPS (15Leist M. Gantner F. Boblinger I. Tiegs G. Am. J. Pathol. 1995; 146: 1220-1234PubMed Google Scholar, 16Morikawa A. Sugiyama T. Kato Y. Koide N. Jiang G.Z. Takahashi K. Tamada Y. Yokochi T. Infect. Immun. 1996; 64: 734-738Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The molecule responsible for the lethality is TNF-α (19Tiegs G. Wolter M. Wendel A. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1989; 38: 627-631Crossref PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar), which, like Jo2, induces caspase-dependent fulminant hepatic failure (20Bahjat F.R. Dharnidharka V.R. Fukuzuka K. Morel L.

In contrast to Jo2 treatment, however, FcγRII KO,B6;129SF2/J, and B6 mice were equally sensitive to this regimen and died within 7 h after treatment (Table II). Thus, FcγRII KOmice are specifically resistant to Jo2-induced lethality.Table IIJo2 elevates serum transaminase of B6 but not FcγRII KO miceStrainTreatmentMortalityASTALTdeath/totalB6Not treated0/346 ± 1039 ± 27B6Jo25/55070 ± 23694520 ± 2829FcγRII KOJo20/386 ± 1770 ± 18B6d-Gal/LPS3/32017 ± 15042340 ± 1502FcγRII KOd-Gal/LPS6/73283 ± 19566332 ± 1201B6;129SF2/Jd-Gal/LPS3/43163 ± 9783400 ± 2208Mice were either untreated, injected with Jo2 (3 mg/kg. body weight, intraperitoneally), or treated with d-Gal/LPS as described under “Materials and Methods.” Mortality developed within 3–7 h after injection.

Open table in a new tab Mice were either untreated, injected with Jo2 (3 mg/kg. body weight, intraperitoneally), or treated with d-Gal/LPS as described under “Materials and Methods.” Mortality developed within 3–7 h after injection. All moribund mice displayed severe hemorrhage in the liver. Sera were collected from moribund mice. Sera of viable mice were collected at 7 h after treatment. The serum levels (units/ml) of AST and ALT were determined with a commercial kit. The serum levels of ALT and AST increased dramatically in Jo2-susceptible mice but remained normal in Jo2-treated FcγRII KO mice (Table II). However, theFcγRII KO mice that succumbed to d-Gal/LPS treatment showed high levels of serum AST and ALT. Although the lethality correlated with hepatocyte damage as indicated by high serum transaminase activities, a complete concordance between hemorrhage in liver and lethality was also observed. Extensive hemorrhage in the liver was observed in Jo2-treated B6 mice andd-Gal/LPS-treated FcγRII KO mice but not in Jo2-treated FcγRII KO mice (Fig.2). Hemorrhage was selectively induced in liver but not in kidney (Fig. 2 a), spleen, thymus, intestine, or heart. Livers from B6 mice taken at 2 h after treatment showed congestion, infiltration of erythrocytes, distorted sinusoids, and hepatocyte death, whereas livers from Jo2-treated FcγRII KO mice displayed normal structure, similar to those observed in untreated mice (Fig. 2, b andc). These observations indicate that anFcγRII-dependent event that mediates lethality by Jo2 must occur before the death of hepatocytes and the hemorrhage in the liver. In the hematopoietic system, FcγRII is abundantly expressed on macrophages, B cells, neutrophils, eosinophils, and platelets (10Ravetch J.V. Bolland S. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2001; 19: 275-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (1362) Google Scholar, 17Ravetch J.V. Luster A.D. Weinshank R. Kochan J. Pavlovec A. Portnoy D.A. Hulmes J. Pan Y.C. Unkeless J.C.

Immun. 1993; 61: 4925-4928Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In the liver, FcγRII is found on the sinusoidal lining cells but not on hepatocytes, and FcγRIII expression on the sinusoidal lining cells is controversial (11Muro H. Shirasawa H. Kosugi I. Nakamura S. Am. J. Pathol. 1993; 143: 105-120PubMed Google Scholar, 12Takezawa R.-I. Watanabe Y. Akaike T. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1995; 118: 1175-1183Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Because many FcγRII+ hematopoietic cells are radiosensitive, mice were treated with 600 rads of γ-irradiation and tested 4 days later for susceptibility to Jo2. Although irradiation eliminated more than 98% of the spleen and blood leukocytes, the mice remained susceptible to Jo2. Conversely, irradiated FcγRII KO mice remained resistant to Jo2 (TableIII). Irradiated FcγRII KO mice that had been reconstituted with B6 splenic cells 24 h earlier remained resistant to Jo2. In addition, we blocked FcγR in irradiated B6 mice with 2.4G2 and 2 h later injected Jo2. FcγR blockade prevented Jo2-induced death of irradiated mice. In contrast, irradiated mice that were either untreated or treated with normal rat Ig succumbed to Jo2 within 4–16 h (Table III). These observations indicate that under the experimental conditions, the critical cells controlling mouse susceptibility to Jo2 were radioresistant FcγRII+ cells.Table IIIAnti-FcγR mAb 2.4G2 blocks Jo2-induced lethalityStrainBlocking antibodyB6 splenic cellsMortalitydeath/totalB6NoneNone4/6B6Rat Ig (0.3 mg, intravenously)None3/4B62.4G2 (0.3 mg, intravenously)None0/5FcγRII KONoneNone0/3FcγRII KO aIrradiated FcγRII KO mice that had been reconstituted with B6 spleen cells 24 h earlier before the injection of Jo2.None108/mouse (intravenously)0/3Mice were irradiated with 600 rads and used 4 days later.

Open table in a new tab Mice were irradiated with 600 rads and used 4 days later. Some mice were injected intravenously with 2.4G2 or control rat Ig 2 h before the injection of Jo2 (3 mg/kg body weight, intraperitoneally). Because FcγR express in sinusoidal lining cells but not hepatocytes, the critical requirement of FcγRII for Jo2-induced lethality strongly suggests that the primary targets of Jo2 are sinusoidal lining cells. As sinusoidal lining cells separate blood from liver mesenchyma, destruction of sinusoids should lead to hemorrhage. According to this interpretation, hepatocyte death is secondary to sinusoid destruction. Consequently, hepatocyte death should be observed around damaged sinusoids but not in areas where sinusoids remain intact. TUNEL assays indicated that the sinusoidal lining cells become apoptotic at 1 h after injection of Jo2 (Fig.3, top versus middle panels). At 2 h after injection, focal hemorrhage and more cells, including apoptotic hepatocytes, became apparent around the damaged sinusoids (Fig. 3, bottom panel). Jo2-induced toxicity of hepatocytes is prevalent around damaged sinusoids. By contrast, hepatocytes around areas where destruction of sinusoids was not induced did not become apoptotic. The data suggest that the FcγRII-dependent destruction of sinusoids is the primary mechanism for Jo2-induced lethality by causing severe hemorrhage in liver and hepatocyte apoptosis. Our study supports a model in which the critical targets of Jo2 are the sinusoidal lining cells that co-express FcγRII and Fas. As sinusoidal lining cells are the gateway for blood components to enter liver parenchyma, our data indicate that Jo2 travels through the blood, encounters sinusoidal lining cells, and delivers a Fas-mediated apoptotic signal that is dependent on target FcγRII expression. Under in vitro conditions, we showed that the co-engagement of Fas and FcγRII provided a strong apoptotic signal, and presumably the FcγR-engaged Jo2 could enhance binding and resist endocytosis. Under in vivo conditions and within 1 h of application, Jo2 induces the detachment of sinusoidal lining cells and inhibits their microvascular perfusion function (21Wanner G.A. Mica L. Wanner-Schmid E. Kolb S.A. Hentze H. Trentz O. Ertel W. FASEB J. 1999; 13: 1239-1248Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 22.Deleted in proof.Google Scholar). Within the next hour, nuclear condensation in the sinusoidal lining cells and congestion/extravasation of erythrocytes becomes obvious (21Wanner G.A. Mica L. Wanner-Schmid E. Kolb S.A. Hentze H. Trentz O. Ertel W. FASEB J. 1999; 13: 1239-1248Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar) (Figs. 2 and 3). Death of sinusoidal lining cells could damage vascular integrity, resulting in focal hemorrhage. Our data suggest that focal hemorrhage induces secondary damage to hepatic parenchymal cells and further loss of sinusoid integrity. As the process progresses, the liver becomes severely hemorrhagic. Massive bleeding is always observed in the livers of moribund mice and is coincident with death. Together with the FcγR-dependent induction of apoptosis of targetsin vitro, our in vivo study provides strong evidence that hemorrhage in the liver is responsible for the lethality induced by Jo2. Transgenic mice in which the bcl-2 transgene is controlled by a pyruvate kinase regulatory sequence are resistant to Jo2 (23Lacronique V. Mignon A. Fabre M. Viollet B. Rouquet N. Molina T. Porteu A. Henrion A. Bouscary D. Varlet P. Joulin V. Kahn A. Nat. Med. 1996; 2: 80-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (348) Google Scholar). In contrast, transgenic mice in which the bcl-2 transgene is linked with the α1-antitrypsin promoter (pAAT-bcl-2) are susceptible (9Huang D.C.S. Hahne M. Schroeter M. Frei K. Fontana A. Villunger A. Newton K. Tschopp J. Strasser A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 14871-14876Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar, 24Rodriguez I. Matsuura K. Ody C. Nagata S. Vassalli P. J. Exp. Med. 1996; 183: 1031-1036Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). Our model can explain this conundrum. The resistance is likely due to the expression of thebcl-2 transgene in sinusoidal lining cells because the pyruvate kinase regulatory sequence used is not cell type-specific. In contrast, the α1-antitrypsin promoter is hepatocyte-specific. Therefore, the sinusoidal lining cells in thepAAT-bcl-2 transgenic mice should remain susceptible to Jo2. Also of great relevance to the present study is the observation that anti-FLAG-aggregated FasL is lethal to the pATT-bcl-2 mice (9Huang D.C.S. Hahne M. Schroeter M. Frei K. Fontana A. Villunger A. Newton K. Tschopp J. Strasser A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 14871-14876Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar), whereas recombinant sFasL alone is not even toward normal mice. According to our model, the anti-FLAG-aggregated FasL are focused onto sinusoidal lining cells by the co-engagement of Fas and FcγRII. Interestingly, lethality occurs with severe hemorrhage in liver but little apoptosis of hepatocytes in the pATT-bcl-2 mice (9Huang D.C.S. Hahne M. Schroeter M. Frei K. Fontana A. Villunger A. Newton K. Tschopp J. Strasser A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 14871-14876Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar,24Rodriguez I. Matsuura K. Ody C. Nagata S. Vassalli P. J. Exp. Med. 1996; 183: 1031-1036Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar), providing further support that hepatocyte death is not necessary for lethality. In addition to the study using anti-FLAG-aggregated rsFasL, several other observations also support the critical role of FcγR in Jo2-induced lethality. At present, Jo2 is the only anti-Fas mAb capable of inducing lethal fulminant hepatitis. The acute FcγR-facilitated cytotoxicity was not reported for other anti-Fas mAbs that do not induce lethal fulminant hepatitis (7Nishimura Y. Kirabayashi Y. Matsuzaki Y. Musette P. Ishii A. Nakauchi H. Inoue T. Yonehara S. Int. Immunol. 1996; 9: 307-316Crossref Scopus (64) Google Scholar). It appears that Jo2-induced lethality is unique to this mAb. Thus, FcγRII-nonreactive anti-Fas mAb and FasL and their derivatives may not induce hepatic toxicity, raising the possibility that they may be used as therapeutic agents. It should be noted, however, that lethality has been induced with an excessive amount of rsFasL (25Schneider P. Holler N. Bodmer J.-L. Hahne M. Frei K. Fontana A. Tschopp J. J. Exp. Med. 1998; 187: 1205-1213Crossref PubMed Scopus (694) Google Scholar, 26Tanaka M. Suda T. Yatomi Y. Nakamura N. Nagata S. J. Immunol. 1997; 158: 2303-2309PubMed Google Scholar), suggesting that the relative sensitivity of target tissues versus liver to FcγRII-nonreactive, Fas-binding agents is an important factor to consider for therapeutic purposes. Because sinusoidal lining cells form the barrier between blood and hepatocytes, their death leads to focal hemorrhage. As the welfare of hepatocytes depends on a functional barrier, hemorrhage-induced biochemical events and the loss of sinusoidal integrity may induce secondary damage to hepatocytes. This hypothesis could reconcile the strong resistance of hepatocytes to Jo2 in in vitro study and their rapid death upon Jo2 administration in vivo(3Ogasawara J. Fukunaga-Watanabe R. Adachi M. Matsuzawa A. Kasugai T. Kitamura Y. Itoh N. Suda T. Nagata S. Nature. 1993; 364: 806-809Crossref PubMed Scopus (1800) Google Scholar, 9Huang D.C.S. Hahne M. Schroeter M. Frei K. Fontana A. Villunger A. Newton K. Tschopp J. Strasser A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 14871-14876Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar, 21Wanner G.A. Mica L. Wanner-Schmid E. Kolb S.A. Hentze H. Trentz O. Ertel W. FASEB J. 1999; 13: 1239-1248Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). This hypothesis predicts that circulating Jo2 would attack sinusoidal lining cells first. Indeed, injected fluorescein isothiocyanate-Jo2 (100 μg intravenously) strongly stained sinusoidal lining cells but not hepatocytes, whereas fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated hamster Ig did not stain sinusoidal lining cells (data not shown). TUNEL assays indicated focal hemorrhage and apoptotic sinusoidal lining cells around the damaged sinusoids (Fig.3). Jo2-induced toxicity of hepatocytes apparently emanates from damaged sinusoids, and regions where sinusoids are intact the hepatocytes remained viable. Our study suggests that sinusoidal lining cells are the primary targets, and hepatocyte death is secondary to the destruction of sinusoids. This is reasonable because the welfare of hepatocytes depends on functional and intact sinusoids. The mechanism by which hepatocyte death is induced requires further study. In addition to Jo2-induced lethality, severe hemorrhage in the liver is observed in several other models of lethal hepatic failure. The acute liver toxicity of acetaminophen has been shown to be the result of a preferential toxicity toward sinusoidal endothelial cells (27DeLeve L.D. Wang X. Kaplowitz N. Shulman H.M. Bart J.A. van der Hoek A. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1997; 53: 133-1345Crossref Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Consistent with the present study, severe hemorrhage in liver was observed in moribund mice (27DeLeve L.D. Wang X. Kaplowitz N. Shulman H.M. Bart J.A. van der Hoek A. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1997; 53: 133-1345Crossref Scopus (82) Google Scholar). In the lethal fulminant hepatitis in which the apoptosis-inducing factor implicated is TNF-α or FasL, the lethality has been attributed to hepatocyte death (19Tiegs G. Wolter M. Wendel A. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1989; 38: 627-631Crossref PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar, 26Tanaka M. Suda T. Yatomi Y. Nakamura N. Nagata S. J. Immunol. 1997; 158: 2303-2309PubMed Google Scholar, 28Onda M. Willingham M. Wang Q.-C. Kreitman R.J. Tsutsumi Y. Nagata S. Pastan I. J. Immunol. 2000; 165: 7150-7156Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Our hypothesis suggests that hemorrhage is the underlying cause for lethality in these models. As with the FcγRII-mediated focusing of Jo2 on the sinusoidal lining cells, TNF-α produced by the LPS-activated Kupffer cells could preferentially attack the neighboring sinusoidal endothelial cells (20Bahjat F.R. Dharnidharka V.R. Fukuzuka K. Morel L. Crawford J.M. Clare-Salzler M.J. Moldawer L.L. J. Immunol. 2000; 165: 6559-6567Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar,28Onda M. Willingham M. Wang Q.-C. Kreitman R.J. Tsutsumi Y. Nagata S. Pastan I. J. Immunol. 2000; 165: 7150-7156Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Although the Jo2-induced lethality is an acute model for fulminant hepatitis, sinusoidal lining cells can be critical targets in chronic hepatic injury as well. Sinusoidal endothelial cells have been implicated as early targets in veno-occlusive disease observed in the setting of hematopoietic cell transplantation (29DeLeve L.D. Shulman H.M. McDonald G.B. Semin. Liver Dis. 2002; 22: 27-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (526) Google Scholar). In this setting, following injury of the sinusoidal endothelial cells, a series of biochemical processes lead to circulatory compromise of centrilobular hepatocytes, fibrosis, and obstruction of liver blood flow. Other clinical settings include the inflammation around sinusoidal lining cells in lpr bone marrow chimera in irradiatedMRL hosts (30Bobe P. Bonardelle D. Reynes M. Godeau F. Mahiou J. Joulin V. Kiger N. J. Immunol. 1997; 159: 4197-4202PubMed Google Scholar), the reperfusion injury of sinusoidal lining cells associated with liver transplantation (31Natori S. Selzner M. Valentino K.L. Fritz L.C. Srinivasan A. Clavien P.A. Gores G.J. Transplantation. 1999; 68: 89-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar), and liver hemorrhage observed after a successful post-operative period in patients of liver transplantation (32Hubscher S.G. Adams D.H. Buckels J.A. McMaster P. Neuberger J. Elias E. J. Clin. Pathol. 1989; 42: 360-370Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Finally, recent studies (6Rodriguez I. Matsuura K. Ody C. Nagata S. Vassalli P. J. Exp. Med. 1996; 184: 2067-2072Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar, 21Wanner G.A. Mica L. Wanner-Schmid E. Kolb S.A. Hentze H. Trentz O. Ertel W. FASEB J. 1999; 13: 1239-1248Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar) have shown that caspase inhibitors can block the lethality and hepatocyte death induced by Jo2 and TNF-α. Our study indicates that these inhibitors could potentially be used to treat certain hepatic injuries such as peritonitis or perfusion-induced liver damage by protecting the sinusoidal lining cells and hepatocytes from apoptosis."

To gain insights into the assembly mechanisms of the Physalis mottle tymovirus (PhMV), six interfacial residues, identified based on the crystal structure of the native and recombinant capsids, were targeted for mutagenesis. The Q37E, Y67A, R68Q, D83A, I123A, and S145A mutants of the PhMV recombinant coat protein (rCP) expressed inEscherichia coli were soluble. However, except for the S145A mutant, which assembled into VLPs similar to that of wild type rCP capsids, all the other mutants failed to assemble into VLPs. Furthermore, the purified Q37E, Y67A, R68Q, D83A, and I123A rCP mutants existed essentially as partially folded monomers as revealed by sucrose density gradient analysis, circular dichroism, fluorescence, thermal, and urea denaturation studies. The rCP mutants locked into such conformations probably lack the structural signals/features that would allow them to assemble into capsids. Thus, the mutation of residues involved in inter-subunit interactions in PhMV disrupts both subunit folding and particle assembly.

Gopinath K. Jacob A.N.K. Srividhya V. Elango P. Savithri H.S. Arch. Virol. 1998; 143: 1489-1500Google Scholar). The RNA genome is encapsidated in a protein shell comprising 180 chemically identical coat protein (CP) subunits (20,000 Da) arranged in icosahedral symmetry. Depending on the bonding interactions, the subunits are designated as A, B, and C (2Harrison S.C. Olson A.J. Schutt C.E. Winkler F.K. Bricogne G. Nature. 1978; 276: 368-373Google Scholar). The A-type subunits form pentamers at the 5-fold, and the B and C subunits form hexamers at the 3-fold icosahedral axes. The protein subunits are held by strong protein-protein interactions. Purified preparations of tymoviruses, including PhMV, consist of empty capsids (top component) in addition to the full capsids (bottom component) containing complete genomic RNA. An interesting feature of tymoviruses is that empty capsids are also formed in vitrowhen the intact virus is subjected to a freeze-thaw cycle or when exposed to high temperatures, alkaline pH, or denaturants (3Kaper J.M. The Chemical Basis of Virus Structure, Dissociation, and Assembly. 39. North-Holland Publishing Co., Amsterdam1975Google Scholar, 4Katouzian-Safadi M. Favre A. Haenni A.L. Eur. J.

Murthy M.R.N. J. Gen. Virol. 1987; 68: 1533-1542Google Scholar). The presence of empty shells in vivo and in vitrosuggests that the information required for error-free assembly is contained within the primary structure of protein subunits in these viruses. It is difficult to isolate an assembly-competent PhMV CP subunit under non-denaturing conditions from isolated viral capsids that can be used for deciphering the assembly pathway. Hence, the CP gene of PhMV and a number of its deletion mutants were cloned and expressed in Escherichia coli. Interestingly, the bacterially expressed rCP could self-assemble into stable virus-like particles (VLPs) (7Sastri M. Kekuda R. Gopinath K. Ranjith Kumar C.T. Jagath J.R. Savithri H.S. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 272: 541-552Google Scholar). Furthermore, the deletion of 30 amino acid residues or the addition of 41 amino acid residues at the N terminus of rCP did not affect the assembly into T = 3 capsids. Several site-specific mutants were also studied. One of the mutations, His-69 to Ala, led to the formation of a 19.4 S subassembly intermediate (8Sastri M. Reddy D.S. Krishna S.S. Murthy M.R.N. Savithri H.S. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 289: 905-918Google Scholar). Recently, the crystal structures of native and recombinant capsids of PhMV have been elucidated (9Krishna S.S. Hiremath C.N. Munshi S.K. Prahadeeswaran D. Sastri M. Savithri H.S. Murthy M.R. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 289: 919-934Google Scholar, 10Krishna S.S. Sastri M. Savithri H.S. Murthy M.R.N. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 307: 1035-1047Google Scholar). To gain further insights into the assembly mechanism of this virus, a careful analysis of these crystal structures was made in the present study to identify residues involved only in inter-subunit interactions, and these residues were targeted for mutagenesis. Gln-37, Tyr-67, Arg-68, Asp-83, Ile-123 and Ser-145 were mutated to Glu, Ala, Gln, Ala, Ala, and Ala respectively, with a view to examine whether such mutations could lead to the formation of assembly intermediates or monomers. The mutant rCPs were expressed inE. coli and purified. The mutants were characterized by sucrose density gradient analysis, electron microscopy, high pressure liquid chromatography, circular dichroism (CD), and fluorescence spectroscopy. Our results imply that Gln-37, Tyr-67, Arg-68, Asp-83, and Ile-123 are not only important for assembly but also crucial for the proper folding of the subunits, whereas the interactions with Ser-145 are not important either for folding or assembly. [α-32P]dATP was obtained from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. Restriction endonucleases and the SequenaseTM Version 2 DNA sequencing kit were obtained fromAmersham Biosciences. Deep Vent DNA polymerase, DpnI, and Ni-NTA agarose were obtained from New England Biolabs and Qiagen, respectively. Ampicillin, isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside, Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250, and ultra-pure urea were obtained from USB. Diaminobenzidine, bromphenol blue, and EDTA were obtained from Sigma. The oligonucleotide primers and conjugated double antibodies were purchased from Bangalore Genei Pvt. Ltd., Bangalore, India. All other chemicals were of analytical grade. The following primers were used to obtain rCP mutants by the PCR-based approach (-S, sense; -AS, antisense): Q37E-S, 5′-TCCCTTTTGAGTTTGAAG-3′; Q37E-AS, 5′-CTTCAAACTCAAAAGGGA-3′; Y67A-S, 5′-CGCCCCCGCCCGACATGC-3′; Y67A-AS, 5′-GCATGTCGGGCGGGGGCG-3′; R68Q-S, 5′-CCCCTACCAACATGCTCAG-3′; R68Q-AS, 5′-CTGAGCATGTTGGTAGGGG-3′; D83A-S, 5′-TCCAACTGCTCTTGCTGTC-3′; D83A-AS, 5′-GACAGCAAGAGCAGTTGGA-3′; I123A-S, 5′-CGGCGCCGCCTCAGCCGCC-3′; I123A-AS, 5′-GGCGGCTGAGGCGGCGCCG-3′; S145A-S, 5′-TTGAAAGACGCCGTGACCTAC-3′; and S145A-AS, 5′-GTAGGTCACGGCGTCTTTCAA-3′. The rCP mutants were constructed by the PCR-based method using corresponding sets of mutant primers (11Weiner M.P. Costa G.L. Schoettlin W. Cline J. Mathur E. Bauer J.C. Gene. 1994; 151: 119-123Google Scholar). The wild type pRBCP (i.e. CP gene in pRSET-B vector) was used as the template for PCR amplification with the sense and antisense primers with 2.5 units of Deep Vent DNA polymerase under optimal conditions. The PCR-amplified mixtures were treated withDpnI (10 units) at 37 °C for 1 h to digest the methylated template DNA and then transformed into E. coliDH5α-competent cells. The plasmid DNA isolated from the colonies was sequenced by Sanger's dideoxy chain termination method with a SequenaseTM Version 2.0 DNA sequencing kit to confirm the presence of the mutations. The wild type and mutant constructs were transformed into the BL21 (DE3) pLys S strain. 500 ml of Terrific broth containing 50 μg/ml ampicillin was inoculated with 1% of the preculture. After 4 h of growth, the cells were induced with 0.3 mmisopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside for 4 h. The virus-like particles formed (if any) were purified by using a procedure similar to that used for purification of the virus (6Savithri H.S. Munshi S.K. Suryanarayana S. Divakar S. Murthy M.R.N. J. Gen. Virol. 1987; 68: 1533-1542Google Scholar). Briefly, the cell pellet obtained after the induction was resuspended in 50 mm sodium citrate buffer (pH 5.5), sonicated, and the supernatant was subjected to 10% polyethylene glycol precipitation. The precipitate was resuspended in 50 mm citrate buffer (pH 5.5) and subjected to high speed pelleting. The pellet was dissolved in citrate buffer and layered onto 10–40% sucrose gradient and centrifuged at 26,000 rpm in an SW28 rotor for 3 h. The light scattering zone was collected with a Pasteur pipette, diluted, and subjected to ultra centrifugation for 3 h at 26,000 rpm. The pellet obtained was resuspended in 50 mm sodium citrate buffer (pH 5.5). The mutant rCPs that failed to assemble were purified by Ni-NTA affinity chromatography. The cell pellet after the induction was resuspended in 100 mm Tris HCl buffer (pH 6.8) containing 300 mm NaCl and 5% glycerol. The sample was frozen at −20 °C overnight, thawed at room temperature, and sonicated for 30 min. The sample was then centrifuged at 27,000 × g for 15 min to remove the insoluble debris. The soluble fraction was mixed with 2 ml of Ni-NTA resin pre-equilibrated with the same buffer and allowed to rotate in an end-to-end rocker for ∼2 h. The protein resin complex was washed extensively with 100 mm Tris-HCl (pH 6.8) containing 300 mm NaCl, 60 mm imidazole, and 5% glycerol. The protein was eluted with 100 mmTris-HCl (pH 6.8) containing 300 mm NaCl, 250 mm imidazole, and 5% glycerol. The purity of the mutant rCPs thus obtained was checked by 12% SDS-PAGE (12Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Google Scholar). The mutant rCPs were separated on SDS 12% acrylamide gel and transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes (13Towbin H. Staehelin T. Gordon J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 4350-4354Google Scholar). The Western blot analysis was carried out using a monoclonal antibody (PA3B2) specific for CP as the primary antibody and goat antimouse IgG conjugated to horseradish peroxidase as the secondary antibody as described earlier (14Kekuda R. Karande A.A. Jacob A.N.K. Savithri H.S. Virology. 1993; 193: 959-966Google Scholar). The blot was developed using diamino benzidine in the presence of hydrogen peroxide in 0.05 m sodium citrate buffer (pH 4.8) containing trace amounts of cobalt chloride. The wild type and mutant rCPs were analyzed on a Bio-Sil 400 gel filtration column using the Shimdzu LC6A system. The column was equilibrated with the Tris-HCl buffer (pH 6.8) containing 300 mm NaCl and 5% glycerol. The column was calibrated with standard molecular weight markers supplied by Bio-Rad. CD spectra of protein samples (0.2 mg/ml) in 0.1 m Tris-HCl buffer (pH 6.8) containing 200 mm NaCl and 5% glycerol were recorded on a Jasco-715 spectropolarimeter (Japan Spectroscopic Co., Tokyo, Japan) at room temperature (25 °C). Thermal stability of the rCP and its mutants was assessed using CD by following the changes in the secondary structure as a function of temperature. The CD measurements were carried out in a Jasco-810 spectropolarimeter (Japan Spectroscopic Co., Tokyo, Japan) using a bandwidth of 1 nm and a response time of 1 s in a cuvette with a 0.2-cm path length. The protein samples (0.2–0.3 mg/ml in 100 mm, Tris-HCl (pH 6.8) containing 200 mm NaCl and 5% glycerol) were heated from 25–95 °C at the rate of 1 °C/min. The thermal unfolding was monitored at 222 nm, and the ellipticity observed was used to calculate molar ellipticity ([θ]) as seen in Equation 1, [θ]=θ×100×Mr/c×l(Eq. 1) where θ is measured ellipticity, M r is protein molecular weight, c is the concentration of the protein in milligrams per milliliter, and l is the path length in centimeters. Fluorescence measurements were recorded on a SPEX FluoroMax-3 Spectrofluorimeter in a 1-ml cuvette with a path length of 1 cm at 25 °C. For measuring the intrinsic fluorescence, the protein was excited at 280 nm, and the emission spectrum was recorded between 300 and 400 nm. In the case of urea-induced unfolding experiments, the fluorescence intensities were recorded at 324 nm, where the difference between partially folded (untreated) and 8m urea treated proteins was maximum. The readings were converted to relative fluorescence and plotted against urea concentration. In all the experiments the protein concentration was 0.2 mg/ml in 0.1 m Tris-HCl buffer (pH 6.8) containing 200 mm NaCl and 5% glycerol at room temperature (25 °C). ANS binding was monitored by measuring the fluorescence intensities between 440 and 540 nm after excitation at 370 nm. In the case of urea unfolding, the proteins (0.2 mg/ml) were incubated at various concentrations of urea for 2 h at 25 °C. ANS was added to the protein samples to a final concentration of 10 μm. The samples were excited at 370 nm, and ANS binding was monitored by measuring the fluorescence emission at 470 nm. The readings were converted to relative fluorescence and plotted against urea concentration. Fluorescence measurements of rCP and its mutants in the presence of increasing concentrations of acrylamide/iodide (0–0.5M) were recorded on a SPEX FluoroMax-3 Spectrofluorimeter in a 1-ml cuvette with a path length of 1 cm at 25 °C. The fluorescence intensity was recorded at 324 nm after excitation at 280 nm. The fractional quenching (F0/F) was plotted against acrylamide/iodide concentration (Stern-Volmer plot), where F0 and F represent the fluorescence in the absence and presence of acrylamide/iodide, respectively. In all experiments, the protein concentration was 0.2 mg/ml in 0.1 m Tris-HCl buffer (pH 6.8) containing 200 mm NaCl and 5% glycerol at room temperature (25 °C). Purified rCP capsids were incubated with 0–8 m urea at room temperature for 4–5 h. The absorbance was recorded at 325 nm. The site-specific mutants Q37E, Y67A, R68Q, D83A, I123A, and S145A were generated by the PCR-based sense and antisense primer method (11Weiner M.P. Costa G.L. Schoettlin W. Cline J. Mathur E. Bauer J.C. Gene. 1994; 151: 119-123Google Scholar). The mutant clones were sequenced by Sanger's dideoxy chain termination method to confirm the presence of the desired mutation (15Sanger F. Nicklen S. Coulson A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 5463-5467Google Scholar). The mutants were overexpressed in E. coli BL21 (DE3) pLys S (16Studier F.W. Moffatt B.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1986; 189: 113-130Google Scholar). All of the mutants were expressed to high levels (25–30% of the total proteins) and were partially soluble. Approximately 60% of I123A and S145A were present in the soluble fraction. The solubility of the other mutant rCPs varied depending on the expression level in different batches. On average, ∼10–15% of the expressed protein was present in a soluble fraction (data not shown). The mutant proteins present in the soluble fractions were purified by the procedure similar to that used for the purification of wild type rCP capsids (6Savithri H.S. Munshi S.K. Suryanarayana S. Divakar S. Murthy M.R.N. J. Gen. Virol. 1987; 68: 1533-1542Google Scholar). The rCP expressed in E. coli has 41 additional amino acid residues (including six histidines) at the N terminus and, as shown earlier (8Sastri M. Reddy D.S. Krishna S.S. Murthy M.R.N. Savithri H.S. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 289: 905-918Google Scholar), it assembled into capsids that sedimented as a single peak when subjected to sucrose density gradient centrifugation (fractions 12–16; Fig. 1 a). The S145A mutant rCP co-sedimented with rCP capsids (Fig 1 b). However, none of the other mutant proteins exhibited peaks corresponding to assembled particles (Fig. 1 a). Furthermore, no assembled particles were seen when these mutant proteins were viewed under the electron microscope, whereas particles of 30 nm were observed for the mutant S145A capsids (Fig. 1 b, inset). The mutant rCPs that failed to assemble into T = 3 capsids could not be purified by the procedures used for the purification of rCP capsids. Hence, these mutant proteins were purified by Ni-NTA chromatography, making use of the histidine tag at the N terminus. The purified proteins were analyzed by 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gel and were authenticated by Western blot analysis (data not shown). The yields of the purified proteins were 10–15 mg/liter for Q37E, Y67A, R68Q, and D83A rCPs, whereas it was slightly higher (20–25 mg/liter) for the I123A rCP. These purified proteins were also observed under an electron microscope, which further confirmed that these mutant rCPs failed to assemble into virus-like particles. These purified mutants rCPs were retained in the loading wells when run on 1% agarose gel and 8% native polyacrylamide gels (data not shown), suggesting that these may represent proteins that are folding defective. Purified rCP capsids and the mutant rCPs were loaded onto a Bio-Sil 400 gel filtration column. The column was calibrated with standard protein molecular weight markers. The rCP capsids eluted immediately after the void volume as expected. However, the I123A mutant rCP behaved abnormally and eluted after vitamin B12 (Fig. 2). All of the three peaks in Fig. 2 were confirmed to be I123A mutant rCP by Western blot analysis (data not shown). The Q37E, Y67A, R68Q, and D83A mutant rCPs also behaved in a similar manner. S145A rCP capsids co-eluted with rCP capsids (data not shown). Therefore, it is likely that Q37E, Y67A, R68Q, D83A, and I123A rCP mutants exist as partially folded monomers that bind to the column and are eluted later in the run. Far UV CD was used to examine the secondary structural features of the mutant rCPs that failed to assemble into capsids. The far UV CD spectra of these mutants showed troughs in the 208–225 nm range, suggesting that all of them had a considerable amount of secondary structure (Fig.3). Furthermore, the fluorescence emission spectra of these mutants showed an emission maxima at 332–336 nm and was similar to that observed with the rCP capsids (Fig.4 a). This indicated that the aromatic residues, especially the single tryptophan residue, was inaccessible to the solvent. Upon incubation with 8 m urea, the emission maximum shifted to 350–356 nm, suggesting that the tryptophan side chain was exposed to the solvent (Fig. 4 b). The fluorescence intensity was measured at 324 nm, at which the maximum difference in intensity was observed between the native (0m urea) and 8 m urea unfolded proteins. The fluorescence intensities at various concentrations of urea were calculated as a percent of the fluorescence intensity at 0m urea. A discrete unfolding transition was found between 3 to 5 m urea in the case of rCP capsids (Fig.5 b), whereas no such transition was observed with the mutants rCPs (Fig. 5 a). This observation corroborates earlier studies in which the rCP capsids were found to be stable up to 4 m urea at room temperature (7Sastri M. Kekuda R. Gopinath K. Ranjith Kumar C.T. Jagath J.R. Savithri H.S. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 272: 541-552Google Scholar). Interestingly, the urea-induced denaturation of the rCP capsids, as measured by fluorescence, overlapped with the changes in light scattering as monitored by absorbance at 325 nm (Fig. 5 b). This indicated that disassembly and denaturation could be concerted events in this virus. The lack of a discrete unfolding transition in the case of rCP mutants as monitored by fluorescence reflects conformational flexibility of these mutant proteins. Furthermore, the absorbance at 325 nm for the mutant rCPs (0.2 mg/ml) was negligible (<0.005), suggesting that the spectral changes observed are not due to aggregation.Figure 4Fluorescence emission spectra of rCP capsids and its mutants. a, 0.2 mg/ml protein was excited at 280 nm, and emission was monitored between 300 and 400 nm. rCP, Q37E, Y67A, R68Q, D83A, and I123A are shown as solid (—), long dashed (— —), medium dashed (– – –), short dashed (- - -),dotted (···), anddash-dot-dash(—·—) lines, respectively. b, fluorescence emission spectra of rCP capsids and its mutants in the presence of 8 m urea. 0.2 mg/ml protein was incubated in a buffer containing 8 m urea for 2 h at room temperature, excited at 280 nm, and emissions were monitored between 300 and 400 nm. rCP, Q37E, Y67A, R68Q, D83A and I123A rCP mutants are shown as solid (—), long dashed (— —),medium dashed (– – –), short dashed (- - -), dotted (···), anddash-dot-dash(—·—) lines, respectively.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Figure 5Urea denaturation studies of rCP and its mutants. a, purified rCP mutants were treated with 0–8m urea for 2 h at 25 °C.

Stern-Volmer plots for the wild type and mutant rCPs (Fig. 6 a) showed a similar slope for Y67A, R68Q, and I123A mutant proteins, suggesting that the tryptophan in these proteins are protected from the quencher to a similar extent. The tryptophan in Q37E and D83A mutant rCPs, however, seemed to be more accessible. Similarly, when potassium iodide was used as a quencher, subtle differences in the accessibility of tryptophan in the mutants could be observed. Although rCP, I123A, and D83A had similar slopes, Q37E, Y67A, and R68Q showed increased slopes (Fig.6 b). Furthermore, the rCP mutants strongly bound ANS, suggesting the presence of exposed hydrophobic pockets (Fig.7 a). ANS binding to rCP capsids was less when compared with ANS binding to the rCP mutants (Fig. 7 a). This is understandable, as the capsids are held by strong hydrophobic interactions and, hence, hydrophobic surfaces are unavailable for ANS to bind. The urea-induced unfolding of the rCP capsids and mutant rCPs was also monitored by measuring ANS fluorescence. As in other globular proteins, there was an initial increase (up to 3 m urea), followed by a decrease in ANS binding (up to 5 m urea) in the case of wild type rCP capsids (Fig. 7 b). The unfolding transition observed here is in agreement with the results of urea-induced denaturation as monitored by intrinsic fluorescence (Fig. 5 a). In contrast, the mutant rCPs showed only a continuous decrease in ANS fluorescence, suggesting that they were already in a partially unfolded state (Fig.7 b). The partially folded nature of the mutant rCPs was further assessed by monitoring the effect of temperature on the molar ellipticity at 222 nm of the wild type and the mutant rCPs. The wild type rCP and S145A capsids exhibited aT m of 88 and 83 °C, respectively (Fig.8 a). Q37E, Y67A, and R68Q mutant rCPs did not show a discrete transition, whereas the D83A and I123A mutant rCPs showed a broad transition between 50 and 70 °C (Fig. 8 b). These results further emphasize the conformational flexibility in these mutant rCPs. We have resorted to the molecular biology approach to decipher the roles of specific amino acids in the formation of capsids of PhMV. Earlier studies by site-directed mutagenesis have shown the presence of a 19.4 S intermediate in the assembly/disassembly pathway (8Sastri M. Reddy D.S. Krishna S.S. Murthy M.R.N. Savithri H.S. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 289: 905-918Google Scholar). In this study, we have carried out a structure-based mutagenesis of six residues, namely Gln-37, Tyr-67, Arg-68, Asp-83, Ile-123, and Ser-145, which are predominantly involved in inter-subunit interactions. Except for S145A, all of the other mutant rCPs failed to assemble into T = 3 capsids, although they were found to be soluble (Fig. 1). Furthermore, these mutant proteins are partially folded, as evidenced by the following: (i) gel filtration elution behavior (Fig. 2); (ii) the presence of secondary structure as shown by far UV CD (Fig. 3); (iii) the lack of a sharp transition in thermal denaturation as shown by CD (Fig. 8); (iv) persistent high levels of innate fluorescence due to the single tryptophan present in the protein (Fig. 4); (v) lack of discrete unfolding transition upon denaturation with urea (Fig. 5); (vi) accessibility of tryptophan residue in the mutants as measured by fluorescence quenching with acrylamide and potassium iodide (Fig. 6); (vii) enhanced fluorescence of ANS in the presence of mutant proteins (Fig. 7); and (viii) the lack of a sharp structural transition in ANS binding experiments in the presence of urea (Fig. 7). Thus, the mutation of residues involved in extensive inter-subunit interactions affect both the subunit folding and particle assembly of PhMV. A detailed analysis of the position of the residues mutated and the probable consequence of the mutation on the folding and assembly is presented below. Gln-37 is conserved in all of the tymoviruses and is present at hydrogen-bonding distance to the conserved glycines 113 and 114 and leucine 109, respectively, at the A-A5 interface (Fig.9 and Fig.10 a). Gln-37 also interacts with Gly-113 and Leu-109 at B5-C interface and with Asn-188 at C-C2 contacts (Fig. 9 and Fig. 10a). This residue does not seem to interact with any of the residues within the subunit. The mutation of Gln-37 to Glu should therefore have disrupted only the inter-subunit interactions. Replacement of Gln with Glu in the structure using the molecular modeling software program “O” showed that there are no short contacts and also that all the interactions of Gln-37 can be retained by Glu. However, it introduces a negative charge in the dense interface of subunits. The results presented here demonstrate that the mutation of Gln-37, which is involved in multiple inter-subunit interactions, also affects the proper folding of the subunit. Probably, the negative charge introduced somehow interferes in the folding.Figure 10Interfacial interactions of PhMV.a, interactions of Gln-37 (Q37) with residues from the neighboring subunits. Hydrogen bonding interactions of Gln-37 with other residues at the A-A5, B5-C, and C-C2 contacts. The A, B, and C subunits are colored in green, blue, andred, respectively. b, interaction of Asp-83 (D83I) with Arg-159 (R159) from the neighboring subunits. Asp-83 (D83) is involved in salt linkage with Arg (R159) at the A-A5 and B5-C contacts. The A, B, and C subunits are colored in green, blue, andred, respectively. c, hydrophobic interaction of Ile-123 (I123) with itself from the neighboring subunit at the A-A5 contact. A subunits are shown in green. d, interaction of Ser-145 (S145) with residues from the neighboring subunits. Interactions of Ser-145 with other residues at A-B, B-C, and C-A contacts are shown. The A, B, and C subunits are colored in green, blue, andred, respectively.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Arg-68, another conserved residue in all tymoviruses, is at hydrogen-bonding distance with Asp-136, Ser-137, and Val-138 at the A-B interface and is involved in a salt bridge with Asp-150 at the B-C interface (Fig. 9). This residue does not have any obvious intra-subunit interactions. The replacement of Arg with Gln can be done without short contact within the same subunit. However, its mutation to Gln led to the partially folded and assembly-incompetent protein. These results further support the observation that the mutation of residues involved in multiple inter-subunit interactions disrupts subunit folding and particle assembly. Even here, the uncompensated negative charge might interfere in the folding of the protein. Asp-83 and Ile-123, although not conserved among all tymoviruses, are involved in extensive interactions with residues from the other subunits (Fig. 10, b and c). The mutation of these two residues to alanine also led to the partially folded proteins that were assembly-incompetent. Tyr-67 is also conserved across the tymovirus group. It is involved not only in inter-subunit interactions at C-C2 and B5-A, but also in intra-subunit hydrogen-bonding interactions. Its mutation to alanine disrupts the hydrogen-bonding interaction at the quasi-2-fold axis. This creates a cavity in the vicinity of residues Leu-34, Leu-63, Leu-180, and Ile-32. This may have a destabilizing effect on the same subunit, which could hinder proper folding of the subunit. Hence, its mutation to Ala led to the misfolding of the subunits and the consequent arrest of assembly. Interestingly, the tertiary structure of the partially folded mutant proteins is similar to that of the rCP capsids (Figs. 4 and 6). The single tryptophan residue, Trp-96, is located inside the β-barrel, and its mutation led to soluble aggregates defective in folding and assembly (8Sastri M. Reddy D.S. Krishna S.S. Murthy M.R.N. Savithri H.S. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 289: 905-918Google Scholar). Furthermore, this Trp is not an interfacial residue. Therefore, it is possible that the partially folded mutant rCPs and the wild type rCP have similar accessibility to this tryptophan. In contrast to the Q37E, Y67A, R68Q, D83A, and I123A mutant rCPs, the S145A mutant assembled into capsids that were indistinguishable from wild type rCP capsids. An analysis of the intact PhMV capsid structure shows that Ser-145 has hydrogen-bonding interactions with Thr-149 and Asp-150 in the A-B interface, Ser-19 and Thr-149 at the A-C interface, and Asp-150 and Asn-139 at the B-C interface (Fig. 10 d). These interactions are presumably less important or are compensated by other interactions in the mutant rCP and thus do not affect the folding or assembly. Earlier studies on D144N, N188Δ1, and N188A mutant rCPs have shown that they do assemble into capsids, although these residues occur at the inter-subunit interfaces (8Sastri M. Reddy D.S. Krishna S.S. Murthy M.R.N. Savithri H.S. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 289: 905-918Google Scholar). Thus, none of the mutant proteins studied thus far has resulted in a fully folded and assembly-competent monomeric subunit. It is, however, possible that the mutant rCPs are not correctly folded when synthesized in vivo and hence are assembly incompetent. To examine this, the wild type rCP capsids were incubated with 8m urea for 4 h at room temperature and subjected to stepwise dialysis or immediate dilution (20-fold) to remove the denaturant. However, it was not possible to obtain assembled particles from such refolding mixtures. Invariably, the removal of denaturant led to the complete precipitation of the protein. Because it was not possible to refold and assemble the wild type rCP, similar experiments with mutant rCPs were not attempted. In vivo studies on the related turnip yellow mosaic virus has shown that the coat protein synthesized in the endoplasmic reticulum accumulates in the cytoplasm overlying clustered vesicles in the chloroplast (17Matthews R.E.F. Plant Virology. 3rd Ed. Academic Press, New York1991: 231-239Google Scholar). These become inserted into the outer chloroplast membrane with the hydrophobic sides that are normally buried in the complete virus particle within the lipid bilayer. It is suggested that the nascent RNA strand emerges through the vesicle neck and that virus assembly takes place in the vesicular membrane (17Matthews R.E.F. Plant Virology. 3rd Ed. Academic Press, New York1991: 231-239Google Scholar). Thus, the partially folded CP attached to the membrane, upon interaction with RNA, could further fold and assemble into mature capsids. In the absence of RNA, these proteins might self-assemble to form empty capsids. The results presented in this communication clearly demonstrate that the mutation of residues crucial for interfacial interactions disrupts subunit folding and assembly in the PhMV. Furthermore, these mutants are partially folded and are probably locked in conformations that lack the signals/features that would allow them to assemble into T = 3 capsids. The unfolding transition, as monitored by fluorescence, overlapped with the changes in the light scattering when wild type rCP capsids were denatured with urea, suggesting that disassembly and unfolding are also concerted (Fig. 5 b). Thus, there is a close connection between folding and assembly in PhMV. In the flock house virus also, the disassembly and unfolding of the mature capsids was shown to be concerted (18Oliveira A.C. Gomes A.M.O. Almeida F.C.L. Mohana-Borges R. Valente A.P. Reddy V.S. Johnson J.E. Silva J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 16037-16043Google Scholar). Viral structural proteins, such as the herpes simplex virus triplex forming protein (VP23), when expressed in E. coli, are shown to exist predominantly in a molten globule state (19Kirkitadze M.D. Barlow P.N. Price N.C. Kelly S.M. Boutell C.J. Rixon F.J. McClelland D.A. J. Virol. 1998; 72: 10066-10072Google Scholar). The P22 coat protein has also been shown to be quite flexible in solution (20). Thus, concerted coat protein folding and capsid assembly may be a general phenomenon in viruses stabilized predominantly by inter-subunit interactions. We thank Dr. V. Prakash, Dr. A. G.

Igf2 imprinting is thought to be maintained by differentially methylated regions (DMRs) located at multiple sites such as upstream of H19 andIgf2 and within Kvlqt1 loci. Biallelic expression (loss of imprinting (LOI)) of Igf2 is frequently observed in cancers, and a subset of Wilms' and intestinal tumors have been shown to exhibit abnormal methylation atH19DMR associated with loss of maternal H19expression, but it is not known whether such changes are common in other neoplasms. Because cancers consist of diverse cell populations with and without Igf2 LOI, we established four independent monoclonal cell lines with Igf2 LOI from mouse hepatic tumors. We here demonstrate retention of normal differential methylation at H19, Igf2, or Kvlqt1 DMR by all of the cell lines. Furthermore,H19 was found to be expressed exclusively from the maternal allele, and levels of CTCF, a multifunctional nuclear factor that has an important role in the Igf2 imprinting, were comparable with those in normal hepatic tissues with no mutational changes detected. These data indicate that Igf2 LOI in tumor cells is not necessarily linked to abnormal methylation atH19, Igf2, or Kvlqt1loci.

These data indicate that Igf2 LOI in tumor cells is not necessarily linked to abnormal methylation atH19, Igf2, or Kvlqt1loci. Genomic imprinting is defined as an epigenetic change leading to differential expression of the two parental alleles in somatic cells (1Tilghman S.M. Cell. 1999; 96: 185-193Google Scholar, 2Reik W.

Igf2 is one of the known imprinted genes for which only the paternal allele is expressed, the maternal allele being silent. In cancers, the Igf2 imprinting is frequently relaxed so that the silent maternal allele becomes active, resulting in biallelic expression (4Feinberg A.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Walter J. Nat. Rev. Genet. 2001; 2: 21-32Google Scholar). H19DMR is located upstream of the H19 promoter and is capable of binding CTCF, a highly conserved zinc finger DNA-binding protein with multiple roles in gene regulation. One of the important functions of CTCF is as a chromatin insulator acting in a methylation-dependent manner (19Hark A.T. Schoenherr C.J. Katz D.J. Ingram R.S. Levorse J.M. Tilghman S.M.

H19 is expressed from the maternal allele, whereas the paternal allele is silent, indicating that the H19/Igf2 genes are reciprocally imprinted. Competition of these two genes for the use of sets of common enhancers located downstream of H19 is now a well documented model that explains this opposite allele specific expression (19Hark A.T. Schoenherr C.J. Katz D.J. Ingram R.S. Levorse J.M. Tilghman S.M. Nature. 2000; 405: 486-489Google Scholar, 20Bell A.C. Felsenfeld G. Nature. 2000; 405: 482-485Google Scholar, 21Szabo P. Tang S.H.

Biol. 2000; 10: 853-856Google Scholar). On the paternal allele, CTCF cannot bind to the hypermethylated H19DMR, and the common enhancer may be utilized by the Igf2 promoters. Such hypermethylation on the paternal H19DMR is established during male gametogenesis and is maintained throughout development (23Tremblay K.D. Duran K.L. Bartolomei M.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 4322-4329Google Scholar). On the other hand, on the maternal allele where the H19DMR is unmethylated, CTCF binds to the H19DMR to insulateIgf2, and then the common enhancer may be utilized only by the H19 promoter. The Igf2 gene contains three DMRs, two of which (Igf2DMR0 and DMR1) are located far upstream of the Igf2 coding region, and the other (Igf2DMR2) existing within the gene body (12Sasaki H. Jones P.A.

Furthermore, there seems to be a functional link between theH19DMR and Igf2DMRs, because deletion of the maternal H19 gene results in decreased methylation at the maternal Igf2DMR0 (18Moore T.

Thus, KvDMR appears to be an additional control center for the Igf2 imprinting, independent of Igf2/H19 loci. However, this remains controversial, because Lee et al. (16Lee M.P. DeBaun M.R. Mitsuya K. Galonek H.L. Brandenburg S. Oshimura M. Feinberg A.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 5203-5208Google Scholar) reported similar results but found that KvDMR demethylation was not correlated with the IGF2 LOI, although it was consistently associated with LIT1 LOI. The molecular events involved in the Igf2 LOI in tumors have not been determined. In a subset of Wilms' tumors (27Frevel M.A. Sowerby S.J. Petersen G.B. Reeve A.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 29331-29340Google Scholar, 28Cui H. Niemitz E.L. Ravenel J.D. Onyango P. Brandenburg S.A. Lobanenkov V.V. Feinberg A.P. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 4947-4950Google Scholar) and intestinal tumors (7Nakagawa H. Chadwick R.B. Peltomaki P. Plass C. Nakamura Y. de La Chapelle A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 591-596Google Scholar), it has been shown to be accompanied by methylation at the maternal H19DMR together with silencing of the maternal H19 allele (27Frevel M.A. Sowerby S.J. Petersen G.B. Reeve A.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 29331-29340Google Scholar, 28Cui H. Niemitz E.L. Ravenel J.D. Onyango P. Brandenburg S.A. Lobanenkov V.V. Feinberg A.P. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 4947-4950Google Scholar). Although this pattern of Igf2/H19 expression is consistent with the Igf2/H19 chromatin insulation model, there is no reciprocal pattern of Igf2/H19expression as well as no strict relationship between theIgf2 LOI and methylation at the H19DMR in various tumors (29van Gurp R.J.

Furthermore, some cases of Wilms' tumor with the Igf2 LOI show hypomethylation at the region corresponding to mouse Igf2DMR0 (34Sullivan M.J. Taniguchi T. Jhee A. Kerr N. Reeve A.E. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 7527-7534Google Scholar), suggesting the possibility that altered methylation at Igf2DMRs may be also involved. In the present study, we therefore investigated whetherIgf2 LOI is associated with specific alterations of methylation at H19DMR, Igf2DMR1, andKvDMR. In an earlier report, we documented that cells of hepatic tumors (HTs) chemically induced in C3H/HeJ × MSM (Mus musculus molossinus Mishima, Japanese wild mice) frequently show Igf2 LOI and express Igf2 at high levels (35Ooasa T. Karasaki H. Kanda H. Nomura K. Kitagawa T. Ogawa K. Mol. Carcinog. 1998; 23: 248-253Google Scholar). Furthermore, consistent polymorphisms found between the parental C3H/HeJ and MSM strains allow investigation of allele-specific methylation correlating with allele-specific expression of Igf2/H19. We here report that HT cells with Igf2 LOI are composed of diverse cell populations, with and without Igf2 LOI, but even the monoclonal cells with the Igf2 LOI retain the maternal H19 expression with normal methylation patterns at H19DMR, Igf2DMR1, and KvDMR. Male F1 hybrid mice derived from breeding female C3H/HeJ and male MSM mice were intraperitoneally administered diethylnitrosamine (5 μg/g, body weight) at the age of 2 weeks. Cells were isolated by the collagenase perfusion method from HTs that developed 12–14 months later. The HT cells were cultured at a low density as described previously (36Yoshie M. Nishimori H. Lee G.H. Ogawa K. Carcinogenesis. 1998; 19: 1103-1107Google Scholar), and colonies that were present 4–5 days after the start of cultivation were individually isolated using a cloning ring and expanded to establish cell lines. These were then examined for Igf2 LOI, and when LOI (+) clones were found, they were further cloned to determine how many subclones showed the Igf2 LOI. RNA was extracted from HT cells and tissues and from normal liver tissues of male C3H/HeJ, MSM, and C3H/HeJ×MSM F1 mice at various ages. Total RNAs were treated with RNase-free DNase (GenHunter, Nashville, TN) to destroy contaminating genomic DNA, and first strand cDNAs were generated using Superscript II (Invitrogen).

Kitagawa T. Ogawa K. Mol. Carcinog. 1998; 23: 248-253Google Scholar) was amplified by genomic or RT-PCR using the 5′-6-carboxyfluorescein-labeled forward and unlabeled reverse primers, and the products were analyzed by an Applied Biosystem automatic sequencer (ABI Prism 377; Foster City, CA) with the GeneScan software. RT negative controls were run in parallel and demonstrated to be consistently negative. To find the polymorphism in the H19coding region, the H19 exons were amplified by PCR from the genomic DNA of C3H/HeJ and MSM mice, and the products were sequenced with the automatic sequencer. The region covering H19 exons 2–3, including a polymorphic base at nt 7144 (GenBankTMaccession number AF049091), G for C3H/HeJ and A for MSM, was then amplified by RT-PCR. The products were also cloned using a TOPO TA cloning kit (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA), and the clones were individually sequenced for each sample. The polymorphic bases at the H19DMR, Igf2DMR1, andKvDMR in C3H/HeJ and MSM mice were determined by sequencing the genomic DNA. Bisulfite treatment of the DNA was carried out using a CpGenome DNA modification kit (Intergen, Purchase, NY). The regions within the DMRs containing the polymorphic bases were then amplified from the bisulfite-treated DNA using the primers listed in Table I. These PCR products were cloned using the TA cloning kit, and plasmid clones were individually sequenced. CTCF exons 2–7, including 11 zinc finger domains, were separately amplified from cDNA using the primers listed in Table I and sequenced as above. Cells were isolated from the subconfluent cultures and lysed using solution containing 50 mm Tris (pH 8.0), 120 mm NaCl, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, and 100 mm NaF. The cell lysates, each with 50 μg of denatured protein, were run on 7% polyacrylamide gels containing 0.1% SDS and then blotted onto nitrocellulose membranes. The filters were then blocked with 5% nonfat dry milk in phosphate-buffered saline plus 0.2% Tween 20 and incubated with 1:100 diluted anti-CTCF antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA). After extensive washing in phosphate-buffered saline plus 0.2% Tween 20, the filters were reacted with the horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-goat secondary antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and washed again. Finally, bound antibodies were visualized using the ECLTMsystem (Amersham Biosciences, Uppsala, Sweden). The data were statistically evaluated with Statview software (SAS Institute, Cary, NC). Differences were analyzed using the χ2 or Fisher's test, and significance was concluded at p < 0.05. Since the RT-PCR fragments from Igf2 exon 6 including the polymorphic CA repeat were four bases longer in the paternal MSM allele than the maternal C3H/HeJ allele (35Ooasa T. Karasaki H. Kanda H. Nomura K. Kitagawa T. Ogawa K. Mol. Carcinog. 1998; 23: 248-253Google Scholar), it was possible to distinguish the parental alleles from whichIgf2 was expressed (Fig.1). Although Igf2 was expressed in all 10 HT tissues and 54 of 62 cell lines, only 4 of 54 HT cell lines were demonstrated to show the Igf2 LOI (Table II). Then the four cell lines with the Igf2 LOI were subcloned, and 11–33 sublines were produced from each. Analysis of each subclone revealed mosaicism in terms of monoallelic/biallelic as well as positive/negative Igf2 expression (Table II). Therefore, three Igf2 LOI (+) clones from the first cell lines were further subcloned, and 9–12 sublines were produced from each. Analysis of these revealed 75–100% of sublines to show theIgf2 LOI (Table II). Then one of the subclones derived from the first Igf2 LOI (+) cell line and three subclones derived from the second were employed together with four Igf2 LOI (−) cell lines in the next experiment.Table IIIgf2 LOI in HCC tissues and cell linesHCC tissues and cell linesNo.Subclones examinedIgf2 expressionaNumbers in parenthesis represent percentages of Igf2-expressing tissues or cell lines among the total samples examined.Igf2 LOIbNumbers in parenthesis represent percentages of LOI (−) and (+) cells among the Igf2 expressing cells.(−)(+)%%%HCC tissues1010 (100)10 (100)0HCC cell linesFirst cell lines6254 (87)50 (93)4 (7)Second cell linescFour cell lines with Igf2 LOI were further subcloned, and each subclone was examined for Igf2LOI.42–13333 (100)23 (70)10 (30)2–22119 (90)11 (58)8 (42)2–3128 (67)2 (25)6 (75)2–41111 (100)3 (27)8 (73)Third cell linesdSubclones of the second Igf2 LOI (+) cell lines (2–1, 2–2, and 2–3) were further subcloned, and each subclone was examined for Igf2 LOI.33–199 (100)0 (0)9 (100)3–21212 (100)3 (25)9 (75)3–31010 (100)1 (10)9 (90)a Numbers in parenthesis represent percentages of Igf2-expressing tissues or cell lines among the total samples examined.b Numbers in parenthesis represent percentages of LOI (−) and (+) cells among the Igf2 expressing cells.c Four cell lines with Igf2 LOI were further subcloned, and each subclone was examined for Igf2LOI.d Subclones of the second Igf2 LOI (+) cell lines (2–1, 2–2, and 2–3) were further subcloned, and each subclone was examined for Igf2 LOI. Open table in a new tab RT-PCR analysis directed to H19exons 2–3 revealed that the normal adult mouse livers and all the cell lines expressed H19 regardless to the Igf2LOI (Fig. 2 A). Sequencing of the individual RT-PCR fragments revealed that they were all derived from the maternal H19 allele in all the cell lines, indicating that the H19 expression and imprinting are retained (Table III and Fig.2 B).Table IIIAllelic expression of H19 in Igf2 LOI (+) and (−) HCC cell linesCell linesH19 expressionH19 allelic expressionaRT-PCR products from H19 mRNA were cloned into the TA cloning vector, and each clone was sequenced for determination of the maternal/paternal allele expression.MaternalPaternalLOI (−)1+502+1003+1204+40LOI (+)1+1102+503+1004+110a RT-PCR products from H19 mRNA were cloned into the TA cloning vector, and each clone was sequenced for determination of the maternal/paternal allele expression. Open table in a new tab Allele-specific methylation at theH19DMR, including 13 CpGs and one of the fourCTCF sites (the fourth CTCF site at the 3′-end in Refs. 19Hark A.T. Schoenherr C.J. Katz D.J. Ingram R.S. Levorse J.M. Tilghman S.M. Nature. 2000; 405: 486-489Google Scholar and 20Bell A.C. Felsenfeld G. Nature. 2000; 405: 482-485Google Scholar), was then analyzed (Fig.3 A). This region includes a single polymorphic base at nt 3534 (GenBankTM accession number AF049091), C for C3H/HeJ and A for MSM, allowing distinction of the parental alleles. This region was found to be generally heavily methylated on the paternal allele and hypomethylated on the maternal allele in the normal liver in two mice as previously described (23Tremblay K.D. Duran K.L. Bartolomei M.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 4322-4329Google Scholar), but one sample showed less methylation on the paternal allele (Fig. 3,A-1). Nonmethylated CpGs on the paternal allele were more frequent on the 5′ side, including the CTCF binding site. When comparing cells with and without the Igf2 LOI (Fig. 3, B and C), aberrant methylation in the region including the CTCF site was found on the maternal allele at low frequency. This change was detected in all of the fourIgf2 LOI (+) cells (Fig. 3 C) but not in the Igf2 LOI (−) cells (Fig. 3 B) (p < 0.05). Although the same region was less methylated on the paternal allele in the Igf2 LOI (−) cells (Fig. 3 B) than the Igf2 LOI (+) cells (Fig. 3 C), this could be due to physiological variation as observed in normal hepatic tissues, because theIgf2 LOI (−) cell lines were derived from different tumors that were present in different hepatic lobes in a single mouse. RT-PCR revealed CTCF to be expressed in all of the cell lines (Fig. 4 A), and direct sequencing of the CTCF cDNA detected no mutations (data not shown). Western blotting analysis revealed that the expression levels of CTCF protein were not different between the cell lines with and without Igf2 LOI (Fig. 4 B), indicating that the CTCF may not be altered in any of them. Five CpGs in theIgf2DMR1 were examined for allele-specific methylation using the polymorphic base at nt 12826 (GenBankTM accession number MMU71085), A for C3H/HeJ and G for MSM as a marker. Although degrees of methylation were variable in each normal hepatic tissue and cell line, some characteristic methylation patterns were noted (Fig. 5). First, the CpGs at the first and fifth positions were more methylated than the others, although this was not constant either in normal livers or cell lines. Second, the CpG at the fifth position tended to be differentially methylated on the paternal allele, but such a tendency was not apparent for other CpGs, for which the results were variable in each sample. However, when cells with and without theIgf2 LOI were compared, there was no clear cut difference in the methylation patterns. Twelve CpGs in the KvDMR, including a polymorphic base at nt 2494 (GenBankTMaccession number AF119385), with G for C3H/HeJ and C for MSM, were generally hypermethylated on the maternal allele but hypomethylated on the paternal allele in the normal livers (Fig.6 A), as previously described (15Smilinich N.J. Day C.D. Fitzpatrick G.V. Caldwell G.M. Lossie A.C. Cooper P.R. Smallwood A.C. Joyce J.A. Schofield P.N. Reik W. Nicholls R.D. Weksberg R. Driscoll D.J. Maher E.R. Shows T.B. Higgins M.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 8064-8069Google Scholar). However, some PCR fragments derived from the paternal allele showed hypermethylation, and a few maternal fragments showed hypomethylation, indicating that the KvDMR creates a mosaic in terms of methylation at the individual DNA strand level in normal hepatic tissues. On the other hand, such a mosaic pattern was less prominent in the HT cell lines, presumably due to extensive selection of the clones. However, there was no significant difference in methylation patterns between the cells with and withoutIgf2 LOI. Although the examined mouse HT cell lines showedIgf2 LOI at low frequency, all 10 HT tissues were negative in this study. This suggests that the Igf2LOI (+) cells may be derived from rare cells within the HT tissues or generated de novo during establishment of the lines. BecauseIgf2 LOI has been reported in cultured mouse and rat fibroblasts (37Eversole-Cire P. Ferguson-Smith A.C. Sasaki H. Brown K.D. Cattanach B.M. Gonzales F.A. Surani M.A. Jones P.A. Mol. Cell.
