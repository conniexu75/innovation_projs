https://openalex.org/W1967822922,"Organic compounds in meteorites seem to have formed by catalytic reactions of CO, H2, and NH3 in the solar nebula, at 360 degrees to 400 degrees K and (4 to 10) x 10-6 atm. The onset of these reactions was triggered by the formation of suitable catalysts (magnetite, hydrated silicates) at these temperatures. These reactions may be a source of prebiotic carbon compounds on the inner planets, and interstellar molecules."

Numerous membrane continuities appeared between chloroplasts and other organelles of the fern Pteris vittata L., and occasionally in the leaves of the tomato Lycopersicon esculentum Mill. A number of these continuities had not been reported earlier or had been seen only infrequently."
https://openalex.org/W2004126440,"Trials conducted under controlled environments demonstrated that the delay of bud activity of Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii) seedlings occasioned by low temperature of the soil could be eliminated by application of gibberellic acid. Analyses of field-grown plants showed a parallel increase in bud activity, level of gibberellin-like compounds in xylem sap, and soil temperature during February and March."

https://openalex.org/W2003174626,Ultraviolet spectroscopic analyses of suspensions of quinazoline and Na(+)-saturated montmorillonite have indicated that covalent hydration of the monovalent organic cation is inhibited at or near the clay surface. A similar lack of hydration was observed in solutions of quinazoline and high-ionic-strength calcium chloride. The inhibition is attributed to a local competition between quinazoline and the inorganic cations for water of hydration.

https://openalex.org/W2082657234,"The study of stellar, planetary and galactic evolution leads to the conclusion that the phenomenon of life must be coursing through the universe. It is estimated, by means of telescopic sampling, that there are billions of stars capable of having those photochemical reactions necessary for the origin of life. One approach in the search for other life would be to deploy men and instruments in spacecraft. Radio contact with other civilizations is another approach. Finally, the question might be approached by considering life as an inevitable consequence of the evolution of matter. A survey of Martian characteristics shows the possibility of life there to be dubious. The possibility of life in other parts of the galaxy is supported by a fundamental conclusion of living matter that all organisms have a common chemical ancestry. The experiment of Urey and Miller, wherein four amino acids were obtained by subjecting a mixture of methane, ammonia, and water to an electric arc, is believed to duplicate the initial organic syntheses which led to the emergence of life on earth."
