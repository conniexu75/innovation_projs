https://openalex.org/W2946199134,"The electrochemical synthesis of ammonia from nitrogen under mild conditions using renewable electricity is an attractive alternative1–4 to the energy-intensive Haber–Bosch process, which dominates industrial ammonia production. However, there are considerable scientific and technical challenges5,6 facing the electrochemical alternative, and most experimental studies reported so far have achieved only low selectivities and conversions. The amount of ammonia produced is usually so small that it cannot be firmly attributed to electrochemical nitrogen fixation7–9 rather than contamination from ammonia that is either present in air, human breath or ion-conducting membranes9, or generated from labile nitrogen-containing compounds (for example, nitrates, amines, nitrites and nitrogen oxides) that are typically present in the nitrogen gas stream10, in the atmosphere or even in the catalyst itself. Although these sources of experimental artefacts are beginning to be recognized and managed11,12, concerted efforts to develop effective electrochemical nitrogen reduction processes would benefit from benchmarking protocols for the reaction and from a standardized set of control experiments designed to identify and then eliminate or quantify the sources of contamination. Here we propose a rigorous procedure using 15N2 that enables us to reliably detect and quantify the electrochemical reduction of nitrogen to ammonia. We demonstrate experimentally the importance of various sources of contamination, and show how to remove labile nitrogen-containing compounds from the nitrogen gas as well as how to perform quantitative isotope measurements with cycling of 15N2 gas to reduce both contamination and the cost of isotope measurements. Following this protocol, we find that no ammonia is produced when using the most promising pure-metal catalysts for this reaction in aqueous media, and we successfully confirm and quantify ammonia synthesis using lithium electrodeposition in tetrahydrofuran13. The use of this rigorous protocol should help to prevent false positives from appearing in the literature, thus enabling the field to focus on viable pathways towards the practical electrochemical reduction of nitrogen to ammonia. A protocol for the electrochemical reduction of nitrogen to ammonia enables isotope-sensitive quantification of the ammonia produced and the identification and removal of contaminants."
https://openalex.org/W2944997976,"The dopamine projection from ventral tegmental area (VTA) to nucleus accumbens (NAc) is critical for motivation to work for rewards and reward-driven learning. How dopamine supports both functions is unclear. Dopamine cell spiking can encode prediction errors, which are vital learning signals in computational theories of adaptive behaviour. By contrast, dopamine release ramps up as animals approach rewards, mirroring reward expectation. This mismatch might reflect differences in behavioural tasks, slower changes in dopamine cell spiking or spike-independent modulation of dopamine release. Here we compare spiking of identified VTA dopamine cells with NAc dopamine release in the same decision-making task. Cues that indicate an upcoming reward increased both spiking and release. However, NAc core dopamine release also covaried with dynamically evolving reward expectations, without corresponding changes in VTA dopamine cell spiking. Our results suggest a fundamental difference in how dopamine release is regulated to achieve distinct functions: broadcast burst signals promote learning, whereas local control drives motivation."

https://openalex.org/W2945086778,"The development of two-dimensional (2D) materials has opened up possibilities for their application in electronics, optoelectronics and photovoltaics, because they can provide devices with smaller size, higher speed and additional functionalities compared with conventional silicon-based devices1. The ability to grow large, high-quality single crystals for 2D components-that is, conductors, semiconductors and insulators-is essential for the industrial application of 2D devices2-4. Atom-layered hexagonal boron nitride (hBN), with its excellent stability, flat surface and large bandgap, has been reported to be the best 2D insulator5-12. However, the size of 2D hBN single crystals is typically limited to less than one millimetre13-18, mainly because of difficulties in the growth of such crystals; these include excessive nucleation, which precludes growth from a single nucleus to large single crystals, and the threefold symmetry of the hBN lattice, which leads to antiparallel domains and twin boundaries on most substrates19. Here we report the epitaxial growth of a 100-square-centimetre single-crystal hBN monolayer on a low-symmetry Cu (110) vicinal surface, obtained by annealing an industrial copper foil. Structural characterizations and theoretical calculations indicate that epitaxial growth was achieved by the coupling of Cu <211> step edges with hBN zigzag edges, which breaks the equivalence of antiparallel hBN domains, enabling unidirectional domain alignment better than 99 per cent. The growth kinetics, unidirectional alignment and seamless stitching of the hBN domains are unambiguously demonstrated using centimetre- to atomic-scale characterization techniques. Our findings are expected to facilitate the wide application of 2D devices and lead to the epitaxial growth of broad non-centrosymmetric 2D materials, such as various transition-metal dichalcogenides20-23, to produce large single crystals."
https://openalex.org/W2945877977,"Protein-coding genetic variants that strongly affect disease risk can yield relevant clues to disease pathogenesis. Here we report exome-sequencing analyses of 20,791 individuals with type 2 diabetes (T2D) and 24,440 non-diabetic control participants from 5 ancestries. We identify gene-level associations of rare variants (with minor allele frequencies of less than 0.5%) in 4 genes at exome-wide significance, including a series of more than 30 SLC30A8 alleles that conveys protection against T2D, and in 12 gene sets, including those corresponding to T2D drug targets (P = 6.1 × 10-3) and candidate genes from knockout mice (P = 5.2 × 10-3). Within our study, the strongest T2D gene-level signals for rare variants explain at most 25% of the heritability of the strongest common single-variant signals, and the gene-level effect sizes of the rare variants that we observed in established T2D drug targets will require 75,000-185,000 sequenced cases to achieve exome-wide significance. We propose a method to interpret these modest rare-variant associations and to incorporate these associations into future target or gene prioritization efforts."

https://openalex.org/W2945775408,"Nucleic acids from bacteria or viruses induce potent immune responses in infected cells1-4. The detection of pathogen-derived nucleic acids is a central strategy by which the host senses infection and initiates protective immune responses5,6. Cyclic GMP-AMP synthase (cGAS) is a double-stranded DNA sensor7,8. It catalyses the synthesis of cyclic GMP-AMP (cGAMP)9-12, which stimulates the induction of type I interferons through the STING-TBK1-IRF-3 signalling axis13-15. STING oligomerizes after binding of cGAMP, leading to the recruitment and activation of the TBK1 kinase8,16. The IRF-3 transcription factor is then recruited to the signalling complex and activated by TBK18,17-20. Phosphorylated IRF-3 translocates to the nucleus and initiates the expression of type I interferons21. However, the precise mechanisms that govern activation of STING by cGAMP and subsequent activation of TBK1 by STING remain unclear. Here we show that a conserved PLPLRT/SD motif within the C-terminal tail of STING mediates the recruitment and activation of TBK1. Crystal structures of TBK1 bound to STING reveal that the PLPLRT/SD motif binds to the dimer interface of TBK1. Cell-based studies confirm that the direct interaction between TBK1 and STING is essential for induction of IFNβ after cGAMP stimulation. Moreover, we show that full-length STING oligomerizes after it binds cGAMP, and highlight this as an essential step in the activation of STING-mediated signalling. These findings provide a structural basis for the development of STING agonists and antagonists for the treatment of cancer and autoimmune disorders."

https://openalex.org/W3104015996,"The physics of star formation and the deposition of mass, momentum and energy into the interstellar medium by massive stars ('feedback') are the main uncertainties in modern cosmological simulations of galaxy formation and evolution1,2. These processes determine the properties of galaxies3,4 but are poorly understood on the scale of individual giant molecular clouds (less than 100 parsecs)5,6, which are resolved in modern galaxy formation simulations7,8. The key question is why the timescale for depleting molecular gas through star formation in galaxies (about 2 billion years)9,10 exceeds the cloud dynamical timescale by two orders of magnitude11. Either most of a cloud's mass is converted into stars over many dynamical times12 or only a small fraction turns into stars before the cloud is dispersed on a dynamical timescale13,14. Here we report high-angular-resolution observations of the nearby flocculent spiral galaxy NGC 300. We find that the molecular gas and high-mass star formation on the scale of giant molecular clouds are spatially decorrelated, in contrast to their tight correlation on galactic scales5. We demonstrate that this decorrelation implies rapid evolutionary cycling between clouds, star formation and feedback. We apply a statistical method15,16 to quantify the evolutionary timeline and find that star formation is regulated by efficient stellar feedback, which drives cloud dispersal on short timescales (around 1.5 million years). The rapid feedback arises from radiation and stellar winds, before supernova explosions can occur. This feedback limits cloud lifetimes to about one dynamical timescale (about 10 million years), with integrated star formation efficiencies of only 2 to 3 per cent. Our findings reveal that galaxies consist of building blocks undergoing vigorous, feedback-driven life cycles that vary with the galactic environment and collectively define how galaxies form stars."
https://openalex.org/W2946425375,"The recovery of the stratospheric ozone layer relies on the continued decline in the atmospheric concentrations of ozone-depleting gases such as chlorofluorocarbons1. The atmospheric concentration of trichlorofluoromethane (CFC-11), the second-most abundant chlorofluorocarbon, has declined substantially since the mid-1990s2. A recently reported slowdown in the decline of the atmospheric concentration of CFC-11 after 2012, however, suggests that global emissions have increased3,4. A concurrent increase in CFC-11 emissions from eastern Asia contributes to the global emission increase, but the location and magnitude of this regional source are unknown3. Here, using high-frequency atmospheric observations from Gosan, South Korea, and Hateruma, Japan, together with global monitoring data and atmospheric chemical transport model simulations, we investigate regional CFC-11 emissions from eastern Asia. We show that emissions from eastern mainland China are 7.0 ± 3.0 (±1 standard deviation) gigagrams per year higher in 2014–2017 than in 2008–2012, and that the increase in emissions arises primarily around the northeastern provinces of Shandong and Hebei. This increase accounts for a substantial fraction (at least 40 to 60 per cent) of the global rise in CFC-11 emissions. We find no evidence for a significant increase in CFC-11 emissions from any other eastern Asian countries or other regions of the world where there are available data for the detection of regional emissions. The attribution of any remaining fraction of the global CFC-11 emission rise to other regions is limited by the sparsity of long-term measurements of sufficient frequency near potentially emissive regions. Several considerations suggest that the increase in CFC-11 emissions from eastern mainland China is likely to be the result of new production and use, which is inconsistent with the Montreal Protocol agreement to phase out global chlorofluorocarbon production by 2010. Emissions from eastern China account for approximately 40 to 60 per cent of the global rise in emissions of trichlorofluoromethane (CFC-11), which may be a result of new production and use."
https://openalex.org/W2945941840,"In mammals, the emergence of totipotency after fertilization involves extensive rearrangements of the spatial positioning of the genome1,2. However, the contribution of spatial genome organization to the regulation of developmental programs is unclear3. Here we generate high-resolution maps of genomic interactions with the nuclear lamina (a filamentous meshwork that lines the inner nuclear membrane) in mouse pre-implantation embryos. We reveal that nuclear organization is not inherited from the maternal germline but is instead established de novo shortly after fertilization. The two parental genomes establish lamina-associated domains (LADs)4 with different features that converge after the 8-cell stage. We find that the mechanism of LAD establishment is unrelated to DNA replication. Instead, we show that paternal LAD formation in zygotes is prevented by ectopic expression of Kdm5b, which suggests that LAD establishment may be dependent on remodelling of H3K4 methylation. Our data suggest a step-wise assembly model whereby early LAD formation precedes consolidation of topologically associating domains."

In the fungi, melanins, such as eumelanins, are components of the cell wall that provide protection against biotic and abiotic elements. Elucidation of the smallest fungal cell wall-associated melanin unit that serves as a building block is critical to understand the architecture of these polymers, its interaction with surrounding components, and their functional versatility. In this study, we used isopycnic gradient sedimentation, NMR, EPR, high-resolution microscopy, and proteomics to analyze the melanin in the cell wall of the human pathogenic fungus Cryptococcus neoformans. We observed that melanin is assembled into the cryptococcal cell wall in spherical structures ∼200 nm in diameter, termed melanin granules, which are in turn composed of nanospheres ∼30 nm in diameter, termed fungal melanosomes. We noted that melanin granules are closely associated with proteins that may play critical roles in the fungal melanogenesis and the supramolecular structure of this polymer. Using this structural information, we propose a model for C. neoformans’ melanization that is similar to the process used in animal melanization and is consistent with the phylogenetic relatedness of the fungal and animal kingdoms.

https://openalex.org/W2946387919,"Mitophagy has been implicated in mitochondrial quality control and in various human diseases. However, the study of in vivo mitophagy remains limited. We previously explored in vivo mitophagy using a transgenic mouse expressing the mitochondria-targeted fluorescent protein Keima (mt-Keima). Here, we generated mt-Keima Drosophila to extend our efforts to study mitophagy in vivo. A series of experiments confirmed that mitophagy can be faithfully and quantitatively measured in mt-Keima Drosophila. We also showed that alterations in mitophagy upon environmental and genetic perturbation can be measured in mt-Keima Drosophila. Analysis of different tissues revealed a variation in basal mitophagy levels in Drosophila tissues. In addition, we found a significant increase in mitophagy levels during Drosophila embryogenesis. Importantly, loss-of-function genetic analysis demonstrated that the phosphatase and tensin homolog-induced putative kinase 1 (PINK1)-Parkin pathway is essential for the induction of mitophagy in vivo in response to hypoxic exposure and rotenone treatment. These studies showed that the mt-Keima Drosophila system is a useful tool for understanding the role and molecular mechanism of mitophagy in vivo. In addition, we demonstrated the essential role of the PINK1-Parkin pathway in mitophagy induction in response to mitochondrial dysfunction.—Kim, Y.

https://openalex.org/W2946496563,"'Social media metrics' are bursting into science studies as emerging new measures of impact related to scholarly activities. However, their meaning and scope as scholarly metrics is still far from being grasped. This research seeks to shift focus from the consideration of social media metrics around science as mere indicators confined to the analysis of the use and visibility of publications on social media to their consideration as metrics of interaction and circulation of scientific knowledge across different communities of attention, and particularly as metrics that can also be used to characterize these communities. Although recent research efforts have proposed tentative typologies of social media users, no study has empirically examined the full range of Twitter user's behavior within Twitter and disclosed the latent dimensions in which activity on Twitter around science can be classified. To do so, we draw on the overall activity of social media users on Twitter interacting with research objects collected from the Altmetic.com database. Data from over 1.3 million unique users, accounting for over 14 million tweets to scientific publications, is analyzed. Based on an exploratory and confirmatory factor analysis, four latent dimensions are identified: 'Science Engagement', 'Social Media Capital', 'Social Media Activity' and 'Science Focus'. Evidence on the predominant type of users by each of the four dimensions is provided by means of VOSviewer term maps of Twitter profile descriptions. This research breaks new ground for the systematic analysis and characterization of social media users' activity around science."

Therapies designed to regenerate β-cells provide great potential for controlling glucose levels and thereby preventing the devastating complications associated with diabetes. This requires detailed knowledge of the molecular events and underlying mechanisms in this disorder. Here, we report that expression of microRNA-223 (miR-223) is up-regulated in islets from diabetic mice and humans, as well as in murine Min6 β-cells exposed to tumor necrosis factor α (TNFα) or high glucose. Interestingly, miR-223 knockout (KO) mice exhibit impaired glucose tolerance and insulin resistance. Further analysis reveals that miR-223 deficiency dramatically suppresses β-cell proliferation and insulin secretion. Mechanistically, using luciferase reporter gene assays, histological analysis, and immunoblotting, we demonstrate that miR-223 inhibits both forkhead box O1 (FOXO1) and SRY-box 6 (SOX6) signaling, a unique bipartite mechanism that modulates expression of several β-cell markers (pancreatic and duodenal homeobox 1 (PDX1), NK6 homeobox 1 (NKX6.1), and urocortin 3 (UCN3)) and cell cycle–related genes (cyclin D1, cyclin E1, and cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor P27 (P27)).

https://openalex.org/W2946363334,"The evolution and internal structure of Mars are, by comparison to its present-day surface, poorly known—although evidence of recent volcanic activity1 suggests that its deep interior remains hot and convectively cooling. The cooling rate of Mars is related to its early thermal state and to its rheology, which determines its ability to deform and to dynamically evolve2. Attempts to reconstruct the dynamic history of Mars and reveal its present-day structure, by combining the study of thermal evolution with surface observations, are limited by the interplay between several key quantities—including temperature, composition and rheology. Here we show that by considering Phobos (the closest satellite of Mars)—the orbital evolution of which is governed by the thermochemical history of Mars, through tidal interactions—we can gain insight into the thermal history and rheology of the planet. We investigated the long-term evolution of the main envelopes of Mars; these comprise a liquid metallic core that is overlain by a homogeneous silicate convecting mantle underneath an evolving heterogeneous lithospheric lid that includes a crust enriched in radiogenic elements. By exploiting the relationship between Mars and Phobos within an established in situ scenario for the early origin of the moons of Mars3, we find that—initially—Mars was moderately hotter (100 to 200 kelvin) than it is today, and that its mantle sluggishly deforms in the dislocation creep regime. This corresponds to a reference viscosity of 1022.2 ± 0.5 pascal seconds and to a moderate to relatively weak intrinsic sensitivity of viscosity to temperature and pressure. Our approach predicts a present-day average crustal thickness of 40 ± 25 kilometres and a surface heat flow of 20 ± 1 milliwatts per square metre. We show that combining these predictions with data from future and ongoing space missions—such as InSight—could reduce uncertainties in Martian thermal and rheological histories, and help to uncover the origin of Phobos. Insights into the thermal and rheological history of Mars are generated by considering the interplay between the thermochemistry of the planet and the orbital evolution of its closest satellite, Phobos."

The Microsoft Kinect camera is a possible option for contactlessly capturing human gait, which could reflect the walkers’ mental state. So we tried to propose a novel method for monitoring individual’s anxiety and depression based on the Kinect-recorded gait pattern. In this study, after finishing the 7-item Generalized Anxiety Disorder Scale (GAD-7) and the 9-item Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9), 179 participants were required to walked on the footpath naturally while shot by the Kinect cameras. Fast Fourier Transforms (FFT) were conducted to extract features from the Kinect-captured gait data after preprocessing, and different machine learning algorithms were used to train the regression models recognizing anxiety and depression levels, and the classification models detecting the cases with specific depressive symptoms. The predictive accuracies of the regression models achieved medium to large level: The correlation coefficient between predicted and questionnaire scores reached 0.51 on anxiety (by epsilon-Support Vector Regression, e-SVR) and 0.51 on depression (by Gaussian Processes, GP). The predictive accuracies could be even higher, 0.74 on anxiety (by GP) and 0.64 on depression (by GP), while training and testing the models on the female sample. The classification models also showed effectiveness on detecting the cases with some symptoms. These results demonstrate the possibility to recognize individual’s questionnaire measured anxiety/depression levels and some depressive symptoms based on Kinect-recorded gait data through machine learning method. This approach shows the potential to develop non-intrusive, low-cost methods for monitoring individuals’ mental health in real time."
https://openalex.org/W2946527179,"RET is a transmembrane growth factor receptor. Aberrantly activated RET is found in several types of human cancer and is a target for treating RET aberration-associated cancer. Multiple clinically relevant RET protein-tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) have been identified, but how TKIs bind to RET is unknown except for vandetanib. Nintedanib is a RET TKI that inhibits the vandetanib-resistant RET(G810A) mutant. Here, we determined the X-ray co-crystal structure of RET kinase domain-nintedanib complex to 1.87 Å resolution and a RET(G810A) kinase domain crystal structure to 1.99 Å resolution. We also identified a vandetanib-resistant RET(L881V) mutation previously found in familial medullary thyroid carcinoma. Drug-sensitivity profiling of RET(L881V) revealed that it remains sensitive to nintedanib. The RET-nintedanib co-crystal structure disclosed that Leu-730 in RET engages in hydrophobic interactions with the piperazine, anilino, and phenyl groups of nintedanib, providing a structural basis for explaining that the p.L730V mutation identified in nine independently isolated cell lines resistant to nintedanib. Comparisons of RET-nintedanib, RET(G810A), and RET-vandetanib crystal structures suggested that the solvent-front Ala-810 makes hydrophobic contacts with a methyl group and aniline in nintedanib and blocks water access to two oxygen atoms of vandetanib, resulting in an energetic penalty for burying polar groups. Of note, even though the p.L881V mutation did not affect sensitivity to nintedanib, RET(L881V) was resistant to nintedanib analogs lacking a phenyl group. These results provide structural insights into resistance of RET mutants against the TKIs nintedanib and vandetanib."

Globally, spacing pregnancies at least 2 years apart can prevent an estimated 10% of infant deaths and 21% of deaths in children 1–4 years of age. The main purpose of this study was to determine postpartum modern contraceptive use and associated factors in Hossana town, Hadiya zone, Southern nation nationalities peoples region, Ethiopia. Methods Facility based cross-sectional study was conducted from June 03 to July 03, 2018, in Hossana town, Hadiya zone. Data was collected by structured questionnaires using face-to-face interview on 368 women. Systematic random sampling technique was employed to approach the study participants. SPSS version 20 software was used for data analysis. Both bivariate and multiple variable logistic regression analysis were computed. Odds ratio with their 95% confidence intervals were calculated and statistical significance was decided if p < 0.05. Result Two hundred seventy one (72.9%) women used postpartum modern contraception. Educational status of mothers [AOR = 0.26; 95% Cl; 0.09–0.744], resumption of sex [AOR = 4.20; 95% Cl; 1.533–11.517], menses resumption [AOR = 8.48; 95% Cl; 3.072–23.228] and duration postpartum period [AOR = 0.26; 95% Cl; 0.107–0.644] had significant association with postpartum modern contraceptive use. Conclusions The prevalence of postpartum modern contraception use is relatively high. Educational status of mothers, resumption of sex, menses resumption and duration of postpartum period were factors significantly associated with postpartum modern contraceptive use. Improving women education & delivering messages for couples on the risk of getting pregnant prior to menses is crucial."
https://openalex.org/W2945491782,"Lactoferricin B (LfcinB) is a cationic antimicrobial peptide, and its capacity to damage the bacterial plasma membrane is suggested to be a main factor in LfcinB's antimicrobial activity. However, the specific processes and mechanisms in LfcinB-induced membrane damage are unclear. In this report, using confocal laser-scanning microscopy, we examined the interaction of LfcinB with single Escherichia coli cells and spheroplasts containing the water-soluble fluorescent probe calcein in the cytoplasm. LfcinB induced rapid calcein leakage from single E. coli cells and from single spheroplasts, indicating that LfcinB interacts directly with the plasma membrane and induces its rapid permeabilization. The proton ionophore carbonyl cyanide m-chlorophenylhydrazone suppressed this leakage. Next, we used the single giant unilamellar vesicle (GUV) method to examine LfcinB's interaction with GUVs comprising polar lipid extracts of E. coli containing a water-soluble fluorescent probe, Alexa Fluor 647 hydrazide (AF647). We observed that LfcinB stochastically induces local rupture in single GUVs, causing rapid AF647 leakage; however, higher LfcinB concentrations were required for AF647 leakage from GUVs than from E. coli cells and spheroplasts. To identify the reason for this difference, we examined the effect of membrane potential on LfcinB-induced pore formation, finding that the rate of LfcinB-induced local rupture in GUVs increases greatly with increasing negative membrane potential. These results indicate that membrane potential plays an important role in LfcinB-induced local rupture of lipid bilayers and rapid permeabilization of E. coli plasma membranes. On the basis of these results, we discuss the mode of action of LfcinB's antimicrobial activity."
https://openalex.org/W2946229385,"The Wingless/Int (Wnt)/β-catenin pathway plays an essential role in cell survival. Although postconditioning with 8% oxygen can alleviate transient global cerebral ischemia (tGCI)-induced neuronal damage in hippocampal CA1 subregion in adult rats as demonstrated by our previous studies, little is understood about the role of Wnt/β-catenin pathway in hypoxic postconditioning (HPC)-induced neuroprotection. This study tried to investigate the involvement of Wnt/β-catenin pathway in HPC-induced neuroprotection against tGCI and explore the underlying molecular mechanism thereof. We observed that HPC elevated nuclear β-catenin level as well as increased Wnt3a and decreased Dickkopf-1 (Dkk1) expression in CA1 after tGCI. Accordingly, HPC enhanced the expression of survivin and reduced the ratio of B-cell lymphoma/lewkmia-2 (Bcl-2)-associated X protein (Bax) to Bcl-2 following reperfusion. Moreover, our study has shown that these effects of HPC were abolished by lentivirus-mediated overexpression of Dkk1, and that the overexpression of Dkk1 completely reversed HPC-induced neuroprotection. Furthermore, HPC suppressed the activity of glycogen synthase kinase-3β (GSK-3β) in CA1 after tGCI, and the inhibition of GSK-3β activity with SB216763 increased the nuclear accumulation of β-catenin, up-regulated the expression of survivin, and reduced the ratio of Bax to Bcl-2, thus preventing the delayed neuronal death after tGCI. Finally, the administration of LY294002, an inhibitor of PI3K, increased GSK-3β activity and blocked nuclear β-catenin accumulation, thereby decreasing survivin expression and elevating the Bax-to-Bcl-2 ratio after HPC. These results suggest that activation of the Wnt/β-catenin pathway through Dkk1 inhibition and PI3K/protein kinase B pathway-mediated GSK-3β inactivation contributes to the neuroprotection of HPC against tGCI.-Zhan, L., Liu, D., Wen, H., Hu, J., Pang, T., Sun, W., Xu, E.

To date, a dearth of direction exists for how to best design and carry out EMA studies. The lack of guidelines renders it difficult to systematically compare findings across EMA studies. Study design decisions may be improved by including input from potential research participants (stakeholders). The goal of the present paper is to introduce a general approach for including stakeholders in the development of EMA research design. Rather than suggesting rigid prescriptive guidelines (e.g., the correct number of survey items), we present a systematic and reproducible process through which extant research and stakeholder experience can be leveraged to make design decisions. To that end, we report methods and results for a series of focus group discussions with current tobacco users that were conducted to inform the design of an EMA study aimed at identifying person-specific mechanisms driving tobacco use. We conclude by providing recommendations for item-selection procedures in EMA studies."

However, the proportion of patients aged ≥85 years enrolled in clinical trials was low and the applicability of their results to very elderly patients is still uncertain. We have carried out a prospective cohort study on AF patients aged ≥85 years enrolled in the Survey on anticoagulaTed pAtients RegisTer (START2-Register) and treated with either VKAs or DOACs, with the aim to evaluate mortality, bleeding and thrombotic rates during a long-term follow-up. We enrolled 1124 patients who started anticoagulation at ≥85 years with VKA (58.7%) or DOACs (41.3%), Clinical characteristics of patients were similar, except for a higher prevalence of coronary artery disease and renal failure in VKAs patients and of a history of previous bleeding and previous stroke/TIA in patients on DOACs. Median CHA2DS2VASc and HAS-BLED scores were similar between the two groups. During follow-up, 47 major bleedings (rate 2.3 x100 pt-yrs) and 19 stroke/TIA (0.9 x100 pt-yrs) were recorded. The incidence of bleeding was similar between patients on VKAs and DOACs. Patients on DOACs showed a higher rate of thrombotic events during treatment (rate 1.84 and 0.50,respectively). Mortality rate was higher in patients on VKAs than in patients on DOACs (HR 0.64 (95% CI 0.46–0.91). In conclusion, we confirm the overall safety and effectiveness of anticoagulant treatment in very elderly AF patients, with lower mortality rates in DOACs patients, similar bleeding risk, and a higher risk for cerebral thrombotic events in DOACs patients."
https://openalex.org/W2946394878,"Megalin/LRP2 is a receptor that plays important roles in the physiology of several organs, such as kidney, lung, intestine, and gallbladder and also in the physiology of the nervous system. Megalin expression is reduced in diseases associated with fibrosis, including diabetic nephropathy, hepatic fibrosis and cholelithiasis, as well as in some breast and prostate cancers. One of the hallmarks of these conditions is the presence of the cytokine transforming growth factor beta (TGF-ß). Although TGF-ß has been implicated in the reduction of megalin levels, the molecular mechanism underlying this regulation is not well understood. Here, we show that treatment of two epithelial cell lines (from kidney and gallbladder) with TGF-ß1 is associated with decreased megalin mRNA and protein levels, and that these effects are reversed by inhibiting the TGF-ß1 type I receptor (TGF-ßRI). Based on in silico analyses, the two SMAD-binding elements (SBEs) in the megalin promoter are located at positions -57 and -605. Site-directed mutagenesis of the SBEs and chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) experiments revealed that SMAD2/3 transcription factors interact with SBEs. Both the presence of SMAD2/3 and intact SBEs were associated with repression of the megalin promoter, in the absence as well in the presence of TGF-ß1. Also, reduced megalin expression and promoter activation triggered by high concentration of albumin are dependent on the expression of SMAD2/3. Interestingly, the histone deacetylase inhibitor Trichostatin A (TSA), which induces megalin expression, reduced the effects of TGF-ß1 on megalin mRNA levels. These data show the significance of TGF-ß and the SMAD2/3 signalling pathway in the regulation of megalin and explain the decreased megalin levels observed under conditions in which TGF-ß is upregulated, including fibrosis-associated diseases and cancer."
https://openalex.org/W2945165317,"Methyl-donor deficiency is a risk factor for neurodegenerative diseases. Dietary deficiency of the methyl-donors methionine and choline [methionine-choline-deficient (MCD) diet] is a well-established model of nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), yet brain metabolism has not been studied in this model. We hypothesized that supplemental betaine would protect both the liver and brain in this model and that any benefit to the brain would be due to improved liver metabolism because betaine is a methyl-donor in liver methylation but is not metabolically active in the brain. We fed male Sprague-Dawley rats a control diet, MCD diet, or betaine-supplemented MCD (MCD+B) diet for 8 wk and collected blood and tissue. As expected, betaine prevented MCD diet-induced NASH. However, contrary to our prediction, it did not appear to do so by stimulating methylation; the MCD+B diet worsened hyperhomocysteinemia and depressed liver methylation potential 8-fold compared with the MCD diet. Instead, it significantly increased the expression of genes involved in β-oxidation: fibroblast growth factor 21 and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor α. In contrast to that of the liver, brain methylation potential was unaffected by diet. Nevertheless, several phospholipid (PL) subclasses involved in stabilizing brain membranes were decreased by the MCD diet, and these improved modestly with betaine. The protective effect of betaine is likely due to the stimulation of β-oxidation in liver and the effects on PL metabolism in brain.-Abu Ahmad, N., Raizman, M., Weizmann, N., Wasek, B., Arning, E., Bottiglieri, T., Tirosh, O., Troen, A.

https://openalex.org/W2945326142,"The purpose of this study was to investigate the sex-based differences in the carpal arch morphology. Carpal arch morphology was quantified using palmar bowing and area of the arch formed by the transverse carpal ligament. The carpal arch was imaged at the distal and proximal tunnel levels using ultrasonography in 20 healthy young adults (10 women and 10 men). It was found that females had a smaller carpal arch height compared to men at both distal and proximal levels (p<0.05) and smaller carpal arch width only at the proximal level (p<0.05) but not distally. Palmar bowing index, the carpal arch height to width ratio, was significantly smaller in females at the distal level (p<0.05) but not at the proximal level. Carpal arch cross-sectional area normalized to the wrist cross-sectional area was found to be significantly smaller in females at both tunnel levels compared to men (p<0.05). This study demonstrates that females have a smaller carpal arch compared to men with a reduced palmar bowing distally and a smaller arch area at both tunnel levels. The findings help explain the higher incidence of carpal tunnel syndrome in women as a smaller carpal arch makes the median nerve more vulnerable to compression neuropathy."
https://openalex.org/W2945498027,"Background Leptospirosis is considered a neglected zoonosis associated with infrastructure problems and low socioeconomic status, particularly slums. Since the disease is mainly transmitted in urban settings by rat urine, this risk factor may be important predictor tool for prompt control and effective prevention at the local level in urban endemic areas. Accordingly, the present study aimed to propose an early spatial predictor tool for human leptospirosis in urban settings, to test the methodology of molecular methods for assessing Leptospira spp. in trapped rats, and report associated environmental data. Methodology/Principal findings Official city records and previous study were used to select risk factors for human leptospirosis in an endemic neighborhood of Curitiba, Brazil. Neighborhood census sectors were divided in high- and low-risk areas using 12 selected factors: flood area, water supply, water course, green coverage, afforestation, sewage network, open sewage, open garbage, garbage collection, dumpster, pavement, and rodent complaints. In addition, rats were captured in pre-determined sites from January through March 2017, euthanized, and individual kidneys samples sent for molecular diagnosis. Human cases were obtained from official city records. In total, 95/112 (84.8%) census sectors were classified as low-risk to human leptospirosis. No significant statistical differences were found in human case frequencies between high and low-risk areas. Kidney samples from 17/25 (68.0%) trapped rats were positive for Leptospira spp. The main risk factors associated with rodent presence included inadequate water supply (p = 0.04), sanitary sewage (p = 0.04), unpaved streets (p = 0.04), and complaint of rodents (p = 0.04). Conclusions/Significance This study offers a new approach to score leptospirosis transmission risk, and to compare small areas and their heterogeneity in the same census sector of endemic areas. Environmental risk factors for Leptospira spp. transmission within the neighborhood were mainly due to differences in infrastructure and basic services. To the author’s knowledge, this is the first study using Leptospira spp. in rats as predictor for human disease in an urban setting of a major city. Although the number of rats trapped was low, this methodology may be used as basis for early and effective interventions, focused on high risk areas for leptospirosis prior to human cases, and potentially reducing morbidity and mortality in low-income areas of urban settings."
https://openalex.org/W2945828846,"Myotonic dystrophy type 1 (DM1) is a severe neuromuscular disorder caused by the expression of trinucleotide repeat-containing DMPK transcripts. Abnormally expanded (CUG)n repeats in these transcripts form hairpin-like structures that cause the RNA to accumulate in the cell nucleus by sequestering isoforms of the Muscleblind (MBNL) family, tissue-specific regulators of developmentally programmed, post-transcriptional processes in RNA metabolism. Through this mechanism, the function of MBNL in RNA processing becomes dominantly perturbed, which eventually leads to aberrant alternative splicing and the expression of foetal splice variants of a wide variety of proteins, including the MBNL isoforms themselves. Here, we employ a patient-derived muscle cell model for DM1 to examine in detail the expression of MBNL RNA and protein variants during myogenic differentiation. This DM1 model consists of a panel of isogenic myoblast cell lines that either contain a pathogenic DMPK allele with a congenital mutation of 2600 triplets, or lack this expanded repeat through CRISPR/Cas9-mediated gene editing. We found that the temporal expression levels of MBNL1, MBNL2 and MBNL3 RNAs are not influenced by presence of the (CTG)2600 repeat during myogenesis in vitro. However, throughout myoblast proliferation and differentiation to myotubes a disproportionate inclusion of MBNL1 exon 5 and MBNL2 exons 5 and 8 occurs in cells with the (CTG)2600 repeat. As a consequence, a reduced quantity and imbalanced collection of splice variants of MBNL1 and MBNL2 accumulates in both the cytoplasm and the nucleus of DM1 myoblasts and myotubes. We thus propose that both the quantitative and qualitative changes in the intracellular partitioning of MBNL proteins are a pivotal cause of skeletal muscle problems in DM1, starting already in muscle progenitor cells."
https://openalex.org/W2946734845,"Background Pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) is an effective and safe intervention approved for use to prevent HIV transmission. PrEP scale-up strategies and clinical practice are currently being informed by modeling studies, which have estimated the impact of PrEP in adult and adolescent MSM populations separately. This partitioning may miss important effects or yield biased estimates by excluding dependencies between populations. Methods We combined two published models of HIV transmission among adults and adolescent MSM. We simulated an HIV epidemic among MSM aged 13–39 without PrEP, with PrEP for adult MSM ages (19–39) and with the addition of PrEP for adolescents ages (16–18), comparing percent of incident infections averted (impact), the number of person-years on PrEP per infection averted (efficiency), and changes in prevalence. Results PrEP use among eligible 19–39 year old MSM averted 29.0% of infections and reduced HIV prevalence from 23.2% to 17.0% over ten years in the population as a whole. Despite being ineligible for PrEP in this scenario, prevalence among sexually active 18 year-olds declined from 6.0% to 4.3% due to reduced transmissions across age cohorts. The addition of PrEP for adolescents ages 16–18 had a small impact on the overall epidemic, further reducing overall prevalence from 17.0% to 16.8%; however prevalence among the sexually active 18 year-olds further declined from 4.3% to 3.8%. Conclusions PrEP use among adults may significantly reduce HIV prevalence among MSM and may also have significant downstream effects on HIV incidence among adolescents; PrEP targeting adolescents remains an important intervention for HIV prevention."

Here, using size-exclusion chromatography, analytical ultracentrifugation, small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS), molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, and ligand-binding and enzyme-kinetic analyses, we studied the functional roles of the flap motif by comparing WT hcSHMT with a flap-deleted variant (hcSHMT/Δflap). We found that deletion of the flap results in a mixture of apo-dimers and holo-tetramers, whereas the WT was mostly in the tetrameric form. MD simulations indicated that the flap stabilizes structural compactness and thereby enhances oligomerization. The hcSHMT/Δflap variant exhibited different catalytic properties in (6S)-tetrahydrofolate (THF)-dependent reactions compared with the WT but had similar activity in THF-independent aldol cleavage of β-hydroxyamino acid. hcSHMT/Δflap was less sensitive to THF inhibition than the WT (Ki of 0.65 and 0.27 mm THF at pH 7.5, respectively), and the THF dissociation constant of the WT was also 3-fold lower than that of hcSHMT/Δflap, indicating that the flap is important for THF binding. hcSHMT/Δflap did not display the burst kinetics observed in the WT.

However, whether measurements of skin AF could predict renal function decline remains controversial. From April, 2014 to April, 2015, we enrolled 245 subjects with at least two conventional risk factors for coronary artery disease (CAD). All were measured for body height and weight, blood pressure, plasma creatinine level, and skin AF at the start of the study. Baseline demographics and laboratory tests data were obtained by chart reviews and patient interviews. Serial plasma creatinine levels were followed regularly every 6–12 months for 2 years. In a stepwise multivariate linear regression analysis, skin AF, was an independent factor for predicting the relative renal function decline rate after adjustment of multiple covariates (ß = -0.036±0.016; p = 0.03). Subgroups analysis revealed that skin AF was a significant factor for relative renal function decline rate in subgroups of age < 65 years (ß = -0.068±0.024; p = 0.02), male sex (ß = -0.053±0.016; p< 0.01), body mass index≧25 Kg/m2(ß = -0.042±0.021; p = 0.04), and estimated glomerular filtration rate ≥ 60 ml/min/1.73m2(ß = -0.043±0.020; p = 0.04). However, only an interaction between skin AF and age attained significance (p for interaction = 0.04). Skin AF is a useful predictor for renal function decline in patients at increased risk of CAD."

Method We made cross-sectional comparisons of FPR1/2/3 expressions of blood neutrophil, M1/M2a monocyte, and natural killer (NK) cell between 16 healthy subjects (HS), 16 primary snoring (PS) subjects, 46 treatment-naive OSA patients, and 18 severe OSA patients under long-term continuous positive airway pressure treatment (severe OSA on CPAP). Results FPR1 expressions on neutrophil were increased in treatment-naive OSA and severe OSA on CPAP groups versus either HS or PS. FPR2 expressions on neutrophil were decreased in treatment-naive OSA versus HS, and returned to normal in severe OSA on CPAP group. FPR1/FPR2 expression ratio on neutrophil was increased in treatment-naive OSA versus either HS or PS. Serum lipoxin A4, resolvin D1 levels, and FPR3 expressions of M1, M2a and NK cells were all decreased in treatment-naive OSA versus HS. OSA patients with hypertension had decreased FPR2 expressions on neutrophil and FPR3 expressions of NK cell. FPR1 expression, FPR1/FPR2 expression ratio on neutrophil, and FPR3 expression of M1 cell were all reversed after > 6-month CPAP treatment in 9 selected patients. In vitro intermittent hypoxia with re-oxygenation treatment in THP-1 cells resulted in increased FPR1/FPR2 expression ratio of M1 cells, and increased FPR1/FPR3 expression ratio of M2a cells. Conclusions FPR1 over-expression and insufficiency of FPR2 and FPR3 in association with defective lipoxin A4 and resolving D1 production were associated with disease severity of OSA and its adverse consequences."
https://openalex.org/W2945297148,"Macrophages (Mϕs) play a central role in mucosal immunity by pathogen sensing and instruction of adaptive immune responses. Prior challenge to endotoxin can render Mφs refractory to secondary exposure, suppressing the inflammatory response. Previous studies demonstrated a differential subset-specific sensitivity to endotoxin tolerance (ET), mediated by LPS from the oral pathogen, Porphyromonas gingivalis (PG). The aim of this study was to investigate ET mechanisms associated with Mφ subsets responding to entropathogenic E. coli K12-LPS. M1- and M2-like Mφs were generated in vitro from the THP-1 cell line by differentiation with PMA and Vitamin D3, respectively. This study investigated ET mechanisms induced in M1 and M2 Mφ subsets, by measuring modulation of expression by RT-PCR, secretion of cytokines by sandwich ELISA, LPS receptor, TLR4, as well as endogenous TLR inhibitors, IRAK-M and Tollip by Western blotting. In contrast to PG-LPS tolerisation, E. coli K12-LPS induced ET failed to exhibit a subset-specific response with respect to the pro-inflammatory cytokine, TNFα, whereas exhibited a differential response for IL-10 and IL-6. TNFα expression and secretion was significantly suppressed in both M1- and M2-like Mφs. IL-10 and IL-6, on the other hand, were suppressed in M1s and refractory to suppression in M2s. ET suppressed TLR4 mRNA, but not TLR4 protein, yet induced differential augmentation of the negative regulatory molecules, Tollip in M1 and IRAK-M in M2 Mφs. In conclusion, E. coli K12-LPS differentially tolerises Mφ subsets at the level of anti-inflammatory cytokines, associated with a subset-specific divergence in negative regulators and independent of TLR4 down-regulation."

By modulating immune responses at their foundation, IFNs can widely reshape immunity to control infectious diseases and malignancies. Nevertheless, their biological activities can also be detrimental to surrounding healthy cells, as prolonged IFN-I signaling is associated with excessive inflammation and immune dysfunction. The interaction of the human pDC receptor immunoglobulin-like transcript 7 (ILT7) with its IFN-I–regulated ligand, bone marrow stromal cell antigen 2 (BST2) plays a key role in controlling the IFN-I amounts produced by pDCs in response to Toll-like receptor (TLR) activation. However, the structural determinants and molecular features of BST2 that govern ILT7 engagement and activation are largely undefined.

We found that although the coiled-coil region contains a newly defined ILT7-binding surface, the N-terminal region appears to suppress ILT7 activation. We further show that a stable BST2 homodimer binds to ILT7, but post-binding events associated with the unique BST2 coiled-coil plasticity are required to trigger receptor signaling. Hence, BST2 with an unstable or a rigid coiled-coil fails to activate ILT7, whereas substitutions in its N-terminal region enhance activation.

Given the IFN-I–inducible nature of the ILT7 ligand, it was proposed that BST2 contributes to a negative feedback mechanism controlling IFN-I overproduction by pDCs after viral infection and/or sustained inflammatory responses (11.Cao W.

We recently reported that while “tethering” HIV type 1 (HIV-1), BST2 is unable to interact with ILT7 and block IFN-I production by pDCs (30.Bego M.G. Côté É. Aschman N. Mercier J. Weissenhorn W.

Understanding the structural features of BST2 that are required to engage and activate ILT7 may guide the development of new therapeutic options aimed at restoring pDC functionality and triggering IFN-I production to induce effective antitumor or antiviral immunity. Using functional assays measuring ILT7 activation by BST2 as well as biophysical studies of BST2 interaction with ILT7, we show that the structurally distinct N- and C-terminal regions of BST2 ectodomain have discrete functions during ILT7 activation. Although the unique and highly conserved C-terminal coiled-coil region of BST2 contains key residues required for ILT7 binding, the N-terminal and its central connecting flexible region acts as a modulatory region suppressing ILT7 activation. Indeed, we provide evidence that after the initial interaction, the coiled-coil internal flexibility is required for ILT7 activation suggesting a post-binding conformational rearrangement of the BST2/ILT7 complex. We further demonstrate that a stable BST2 homodimer is required to trigger ILT7 activation and that both BST2 monomers need to have an intact ILT7-binding surface for this function. Importantly, analysis of somatic mutations identified in particular tumor tissues and mapping to these newly defined BST2 functional domains reveals that specific genetic changes in BST2 are capable of either greatly enhancing ILT7-mediated suppression of IFN-I production or completely abrogating this phenotype, thus underscoring the clinical relevance of our findings. We previously demonstrated that the BST2 ectodomain is sufficient to interact with ILT7 and activate its inhibitory signaling cascade (30.Bego M.G. Côté É. Aschman N. Mercier J. Weissenhorn W. Cohen É.A. Vpu exploits the cross-talk between BST2 and the ILT7 receptor to suppress anti-HIV-1 responses by plasmacytoid dendritic cells.PLoS Pathog. 2015; 11 (26172439): e100502410.1371/journal.ppat.1005024Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). To identify the determinants in BST2 ectodomain required for ILT7 activation we used two previously described co-culture assays, namely a reconstituted ILT7 reporter assay and a PBMC-based assay (Fig. 1B). The first functional assay relies on a mouse NFAT-GFP reporter cell line, which also expresses human ILT7 and the mouse FcεRIγ chain (CT550) such that levels of GFP expression directly correlates with the degree of BST2-mediated ILT7 activation (10.Cao W.

Selected BST2 mutants were also tested in a PBMC-based co-culture assay, which directly measures the quantity of IFN-I produced by PBMCs after TLR7 agonist stimulation following engagement and activation of the ILT7 pathway in pDCs by BST2 (30.Bego M.G.

Given that the extent of ILT7 activation is directly proportional to the surface levels of BST2 expressed on co-cultured 293T targets cells (30.Bego M.G. Côté É. Aschman N. Mercier J. Weissenhorn W.

It has been well-established that NSTs are antiporters that exchange nucleotide sugars with the respective nucleoside monophosphate. Nevertheless, information about the molecular basis of ligand recognition and transport is scarce. Here, using topology predictors, cysteine-scanning mutagenesis, expression of GFP-tagged protein variants, and phenotypic complementation of the yeast strain Kl3, we identified residues involved in the activity of a mouse UDP-GlcNAc transporter, murine solute carrier family 35 member A3 (mSlc35a3). We specifically focused on the putative transmembrane helix 2 (TMH2) and observed that cells expressing E47C or K50C mSlc35a3 variants had lower levels of GlcNAc-containing glycoconjugates than WT cells, indicating impaired UDP-GlcNAc transport activity of these two variants. A conservative substitution analysis revealed that single or double substitutions of Glu-47 and Lys-50 do not restore GlcNAc glycoconjugates. Analysis of mSlc35a3 and its genetic variants reconstituted into proteoliposomes disclosed the following: (i) all variants act as UDP-GlcNAc/UMP antiporters; (ii) conservative substitutions (E47D, E47Q, K50R, or K50H) impair UDP-GlcNAc uptake; and (iii) substitutions of Glu-47 and Lys-50 dramatically alter kinetic parameters, consistent with a critical role of these two residues in mSlc35a3 function. A bioinformatics analysis revealed that an EXXK motif in TMH2 is highly conserved across SLC35 A subfamily members, and a 3D-homology model predicted that Glu-47 and Lys-50 are facing the central cavity of the protein. Nucleotide sugar transporters (NSTs) regulate the flux of activated sugars from the cytosol into the lumen of the Golgi apparatus where glycosyltransferases use them for the modification of proteins, lipids, and proteoglycans. It has been well-established that NSTs are antiporters that exchange nucleotide sugars with the respective nucleoside monophosphate. Nevertheless, information about the molecular basis of ligand recognition and transport is scarce. Here, using topology predictors, cysteine-scanning mutagenesis, expression of GFP-tagged protein variants, and phenotypic complementation of the yeast strain Kl3, we identified residues involved in the activity of a mouse UDP-GlcNAc transporter, murine solute carrier family 35 member A3 (mSlc35a3). We specifically focused on the putative transmembrane helix 2 (TMH2) and observed that cells expressing E47C or K50C mSlc35a3 variants had lower levels of GlcNAc-containing glycoconjugates than WT cells, indicating impaired UDP-GlcNAc transport activity of these two variants. A conservative substitution analysis revealed that single or double substitutions of Glu-47 and Lys-50 do not restore GlcNAc glycoconjugates. Analysis of mSlc35a3 and its genetic variants reconstituted into proteoliposomes disclosed the following: (i) all variants act as UDP-GlcNAc/UMP antiporters; (ii) conservative substitutions (E47D, E47Q, K50R, or K50H) impair UDP-GlcNAc uptake; and (iii) substitutions of Glu-47 and Lys-50 dramatically alter kinetic parameters, consistent with a critical role of these two residues in mSlc35a3 function. A bioinformatics analysis revealed that an EXXK motif in TMH2 is highly conserved across SLC35 A subfamily members, and a 3D-homology model predicted that Glu-47 and Lys-50 are facing the central cavity of the protein. Nucleotide sugars play a key role as precursors for the biosynthesis of glycoconjugates in the secretory pathway. These activated sugar donors serve as substrates for glycosyltransferases.

To enable the latter and to overcome the subcellular partitioning of substrates and enzymes, nucleotide sugars are required to be imported from the cytoplasm into the Golgi lumen by specific membrane proteins, the so-called nucleotide sugar transporters (NSTs) (1Hirschberg C.B.

However, information about the relationship between structure and function is still scarce, and mechanisms underpinning nucleotide sugar transport at the molecular level remain largely unknown. Recently, the first crystal structure of NST was determined. The obtained 3D model of the yeast Vrg4 GDP-mannose transporter provided crucial information to start understanding the molecular mechanisms of nucleotide sugar import into the Golgi (44Parker J.L.

Here, we report a simple approach to test the in vivo function of NSTs. This approach combined bioinformatic analyses, cysteine-scanning mutagenesis, GFP-based detection of protein expression, and phenotypic complementation of yeast mutants that allowed us to identify amino acids residues required for UDP-GlcNAc transport activity of the mouse Slc35a3. A detailed investigation of the transmembrane helix 2 from Slc35a3 identified two critical residues, glutamic acid 47 and lysine 50. Conservative replacements combined with in vivo and in vitro activity assays confirmed the significance of both residues for transport activity. Mouse Slc35a3 (mSLC35A3), a protein consisting of 326 amino acids, shares between 95 and 96% sequence identity with four mammalian SLC35A3 variants, which previously have been experimentally characterized as Golgi-localized UDP-GlcNAc transporters (31Guillen E.

To confirm the substrate specificity of mSlc35a3, Kl3 cells, a mutant strain of the yeast Kluveromyces lactis lacking a functional UDP-GlcNAc transporter, were transformed with either the empty vector (plasmid pE4) or pE4mSLC35A3. Subsequently, the cells were incubated with GSII lectin conjugated to FITC (GSII–FITC), which specifically binds GlcNAc-containing glycoconjugates. Only the suspension of Kl3 cells transformed with pE4mSLC35A3 showed fluorescence levels similar to that of WT Kl8 cells, carrying the functional UDP-GlcNAc transporter, indicating that they recovered the ability to bind the lectin GSII–FITC (Fig. 1A, dark gray bars). In this in vivo system, UDP-GlcNAc transport activity, mediated by mSLC35A3, is indirectly evaluated through the restoration of GlcNAc-containing glycoconjugates at the surface of Kl3 cells. This implicates at least three steps as follows: the restoration of the import of UDP-GlcNAc into the lumen of the Golgi apparatus through expression of an active transporter; the synthesis of GlcNAc glycoconjugates by specific lumenal transferases; and an appropriate membrane cell-sorting process of these products (47Abeijon C. Robbins P.W. Hirschberg C.B. Molecular cloning of the Golgi apparatus uridine diphosphate-N-acetylglucosamine transporter from Kluyveromyces lactis.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

One aim of this work was to generate a collection of mutants and conveniently test their expression while avoiding time-consuming methods. To achieve this, the sequence of the green fluorescent protein (GFP) was fused to mSlc35a3. As shown in Fig. 1C, perinuclear fluorescence in Kl3 cells transformed with mSLC35A3–GFP can be visualized by confocal microscopy, consistent with the expression of mSlc35a3–GFP in the secretory pathway. Subsequent spectrofluorimetric measurements of the cell suspensions showed an increase in GFP fluorescence compared with cells transformed with the empty vector (pE4) or pE4mslc35a3 (Fig. 1A, white bars). Heating the cell suspensions for 1 min at 90 °C reduced the fluorescence signal of mSlc35a3–GFP-expressing cells to background levels of the control cells transformed with the empty vector. This is most likely due to the irreversible denaturation of the GFP fusion protein (Fig. 1, A, gray bars, and C). The results presented in Fig. 1A indicate that fusing GFP to mSlc35a3 did not significantly alter its transport capacity (Fig. 1B) as revealed by the binding of the lectin. Next, the V180F mutation that had been shown to impair transport activity of the bovine Slc35a3 transporter (37Thomsen B. Horn P. Panitz F. Bendixen E. Petersen A.H. Holm L.E. Nielsen V.H.

Although the expression level of the mutated variant was higher than the WT protein (Fig. 1A, white bars), cells expressing the V180F variant bound less than 25% of the GSII–FITC lectin compared with cells expressing mSlc35a3–GFP (Fig. 1B).

These computational organ and cell models can be used to study the impact of pharmaceutical drugs, test hypotheses, assess risk and for closed-loop validation of medical devices. To move closer to the real-time requirements of this modeling a new flexible Fourier based general membrane potential model, called as a Resonant model, is developed that is computationally inexpensive. The new model accurately reproduces non-linear potential morphologies for a variety of cell types. Specifically, the method is used to model human and rabbit sinoatrial node, human ventricular myocyte and squid giant axon electrophysiology. The Resonant models are validated with experimental data and with other published models. Dynamic changes in biological conditions are modeled with changing model coefficients and this approach enables ionic channel alterations to be captured. The Resonant model is used to simulate entrainment between competing sinoatrial node cells. These models can be easily implemented in low-cost digital hardware and an alternative, resource-efficient implementations of sine and cosine functions are presented and it is shown that a Fourier term is produced with two additions and a binary shift."
https://openalex.org/W2945433046,"Inherited mutations in the eyes shut homolog (EYS) gene cause retinitis pigmentosa. Although knock out of eys in zebrafish is pathogenic, the molecular function of EYS in vertebrate photoreceptors is poorly understood. Here, we show that the 5' portion of EYS is eye-specific across vertebrates. We previously determined that a 3' fragment of EYS with an unknown transcription start site is expressed in human dermal fibroblasts (HDF). To obtain insights into the molecular function of EYS in vertebrate photoreceptors, we extensively analyzed EYS (eys) expression in the human fibroblast cell line HDF-adult (HDF-a), the Y79 retinoblastoma cell line, and in zebrafish eyes using rapid amplification of cDNA end, cap analysis of gene expression, RNA sequencing, and RT-PCR. In HDF-a cells, we identified a novel transcript variant (tv), tv5, transcribed from exon 37. In Y79 cells and zebrafish eyes, EYS (eys) was predominantly transcribed from exon 1 or 2, whereas it was transcribed exclusively from exon 37 in HDF-a cells. In the zebrafish eye, there were splice variants that introduced stop codons, resulting in complete loss of the 3' portion of the RNA. These comparative approaches indicate that the 5' portion of the EYS (eys) mRNA appears to be photoreceptor-specific and that the compositions of the deduced EYS proteins in the eye are well-conserved across vertebrates.-Takita, S., Miyamoto-Matsui, K., Seko, Y. Intra- and interspecies comparison of EYS transcripts highlights its characteristics in the eye."
https://openalex.org/W2946109695,"Developing a robust biofilm is a prerequisite for a biotrickling filter to obtain the good performance in removing volatile organic compounds (VOCs). But the biofilm formation can be seriously disturbed under intermittent loading condition due to carbon starvation stress in idle time. In this study, a biotrickling filter, with its packing materials being modified by 3% sodium alginate and 5% polyvinyl alcohol (v/v = 1:3), was employed to treat intermittent VOCs. Results showed that the removal efficiencies of toluene, ethylbenzene, p-xylene, m-xylene, and o-xylene was significantly enhanced in the BTF compared to the control one. Under relatively lower inlet loading, nearly complete removal of the five pollutants was achieved. A quantitative analysis showed that the concentration of total organic compound (TOC) in the leachate maintained at a high level, and had a strongly positive correlation with the divergence of microbial communities. The capacity of biofilm formation in the BTF was approximately four-fold higher than the control BTF, while the quantity of EPS secreted was more than ten-fold. EPS comprised largely of protein, and to less extent, polysaccharide. The biofilm formed on the modified packing materials maintained higher levels of microbial diversity and stability, even when modifiers were complete depleted or the VOCs inlet loading was increased. This study highlights the importance of packing materials for reducing the gap in performance between laboratory and industrial applications of BTFs."

The field of seismic data is so large or complex that traditional data processing software is incapable of dealing with it. For example, the implementation of parallel processing in seismic applications to improve the processing speed is complex in nature. To overcome this issue, a simple technique which that helps provide parallel processing for big data applications such as seismic algorithms is needed. In our framework, we used the Apache Hadoop with its MapReduce function. All experiments were conducted on the RedHat CentOS platform. Finally, we studied the bottlenecks and improved the overall performance of the system for seismic algorithms (stochastic inversion)."
https://openalex.org/W2946293820,"Quantitatively evaluating the spatiotemporal variation of soil moisture (SM) and its causes can help us to understand regional eco-hydrological processes. However, the complicated geographical environment and the scarce observation data make it difficult to evaluate SM in Northwest China. Selecting the Tarim River Basin (TRB) as a typical representative of the data-scarce area in Northwest China, we conducted an integrated approach to quantitatively assess the spatiotemporal variation of shallow soil moisture (SSM) and its responses to climate change by gathering the earth system data product. Results show that the low-value of SSM distributes in Taklamakan Desert while the high-value basically distributes in the Pamirs and the southern foothill of Tianshan Mountains, where the land types are mostly forest, grassland, and farmland. Annual average SSM of these three land types present a significant increasing trend during the study period. SM at 0-10 cm of all land types are positively correlated to precipitation in spring and autumn, and SM at 0-10 cm in the forest, grassland, and farmland are positively correlated with temperature in winter. SSM presents in-phase relation with precipitation whereas it presents anti-phase relation with temperature, with the significant resonance periods about 6-8 years and 2-3 years which mainly distribute from 1970s to early 1990s and 1960s respectively. The time lags of SSM relative to temperature change are longer than its lags relative to precipitation change, and the lags vary from different land types."
https://openalex.org/W2948095489,"In order to monitor the occurrence of zoonotic agents in pig herds as well as to improve herd health management, the development of new cost-effective diagnostic methods for pigs is necessary. In this study, a protein microarray-based assay for the simultaneous detection of immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibodies against different zoonotic agents and pathogens causing production diseases in pigs was developed. Therefore, antigens of ten different important swine pathogens (Toxoplasma gondii, Yersinia enterocolitica, Salmonella spp., Trichinella spp., Mycobacterium avium, Hepatitis E virus, Mycoplasma hyopneumoniae, Actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae, the porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus, Influenza A virus) were spotted and covalently immobilized as 'antigen-spots' on microarray chips in order to test pig serum for the occurrence of antibodies. Pig serum was sampled at three German abattoirs and ELISA tests for the different pathogens were conducted with the purpose of creating a panel of reference samples for microarray analysis. To evaluate the accuracy of the antigens on the microarray, receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis using the ELISA test results as reference was performed for the different antigens. High area under curve values were achieved for the antigens of two zoonotic agents: Toxoplasma gondii (0.91), Yersinia enterocolitica (0.97) and for three production diseases: Actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae (0.77), Mycoplasma hyopneumoniae (0.94) and the porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (0.87). With the help of the newly developed microarray assay, collecting data on the occurrence of antibodies against zoonotic agents and production diseases in pig herds could be minimized to one measurement, resulting in an efficient screening test."
https://openalex.org/W3124856544,"In this study, we designed a delayed payment mechanism in laboratory second price auctions (SPAs), under which subjects received a cash endowment two weeks after the experiment day and had to use their own money to pay the experimental losses (if any) on the experiment day. We compared the effect of delayed payment on overbidding in the induced value SPAs with the conventional “on-the-spot” payment mechanism where the subjects received an endowment on the experiment day, and the prepaid mechanism where the subjects received the endowment two weeks before the experiment day. Each auction was repeated for 20 rounds to provide sufficient learning opportunities to the bidders. Our results showed that bids converged to the corresponding values over auction rounds and overbidding was reduced by previous losses, consistently with the adaptive learning theory. Moreover, overbidding seems to depend significantly on bidders’ cash holding, and the magnitude of the payment treatment effects depends crucially on liquidity constraints. In the presence of liquidity constraints, both delayed and prepaid payment mechanisms reduced overbidding, while in the absence of liquidity constraints, only the delayed endowment mechanism reduced overbidding. Furthermore, when controlling the degree of liquidity constraints, subjects with higher GPAs were less likely to overbid and the delayed endowment mechanism significantly reduced overbidding compared to other payment mechanisms. These results suggest that overbidding in SPAs might be caused by bounded rationality and could be reduced by adaptive learning especially when overbidding becomes “truly” costly to subjects."
https://openalex.org/W2945567733,"The subtyping of breast cancer based on features of tumour biology such as hormonal receptor and HER2 status has led to increasingly patient-specific treatment and thus improved outcomes. However, such subgroups may not be sufficiently informed to best predict outcome and/or treatment response. The incorporation of multi-modal data may identify unexpected and actionable subgroups to enhance disease understanding and improve outcomes.This retrospective cross-sectional study used the cancer registry Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results (SEER), which represents 28% of the U.S. population. We included adult female patients diagnosed with breast cancer in 2010. Latent class analysis (LCA), a data-driven technique, was used to identify clinically homogeneous subgroups (""endophenotypes"") of breast cancer from receptor status (hormonal receptor and HER2), clinical, and demographic data and each subgroup was explored using Bayesian networks.Included were 44,346 patients, 1257 (3%) of whom had distant organ metastases at diagnosis. Four endophenotypes were identified with LCA: 1) ""Favourable biology"" had entirely local disease with favourable biology, 2) ""HGHR-"" had the highest incidence of HR- receptor status and highest grade but few metastases and relatively good outcomes, 3) ""HR+ bone"" had isolated bone metastases and uniform receptor status (HR+/HER2-), and 4) ""Distant organ spread"" had high metastatic burden and poor survival. Bayesian networks revealed clinically intuitive interactions between patient and disease features.We have identified four distinct subgroups of breast cancer using LCA, including one unexpected group with good outcomes despite having the highest average histologic grade and rate of HR- tumours. Deeper understanding of subgroup characteristics can allow us to 1) identify actionable group properties relating to disease biology and patient features and 2) develop group-specific diagnostics and treatments."
https://openalex.org/W2946322615,"Long-chain n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (n-3 LCPUFA) have in some studies been associated with cognitive and socioemotional outcomes in children, but results are inconsistent possibly due to the use of different tests and potential gender-specific effects. The objective of this cross-sectional study was to explore overall patterns in neuropsychological scores as well as correlations between scores within specific domains, and to examine potential gender differences and consistency in associations with n-3 LCPUFA status. In 199 Danish 8-9 year-old children, we performed a large battery of tests and questionnaires on attention, processing speed, executive functions, memory, and socioemotional traits, and measured erythrocyte fatty acid composition. Principal component analyses (PCA) showed that most of the variation in both cognitive performance and socioemotional traits was explained by overall performance, followed by speed-accuracy trade off and externalizing vs. internalizing problems, respectively. Boys had higher speed, lower attention and higher externalizing problem scores than girls. Measures of performance within both processing speed and attention domains correlated moderately, whereas no correlations were found for measures of executive functions apart from some weak correlations for impulsivity. Parent-rated scores for both externalizing and internalizing problems correlated strongly, whereas correlations with child-rated scores were weak. Scores within specific domains did not consistently associate with n-3 LCPUFA, except for processing speed measures which all pointed to faster processing with increased n-3 LCPUFA status. Gender differences in the associations were observed for attention and impulsivity. Child- but not parent-rated internalizing and social problems tended to associate directly with n-3 LCPUFA, supported by increased internalizing problems measured by the PCA component. In conclusion, measures of speed and attention seem to represent these domains in general, whereas single measures of more complex cognitive functions should be interpreted with caution. One approach could be to use multiple tests and create multivariate scores to guide interpretations. Furthermore, the results indicate a need to consider both parent- and child-rated socioemotional scores and gender differences in neuropsychological functions e.g. in investigations of n-3 LCPUFA effects."
https://openalex.org/W2946022695,"Continuity of care is considered to be an important principle of stroke care; however, few analyses of empirically related outcomes have been reported.This study examined the correlation between the continuity of care for outpatients after a stroke event and the survival of stroke patients over the year following hospital discharge.Data from the Taiwan National Health Insurance Database were used in this study. We defined stroke as the ICD-9-CM codes 430 to 437, and all patients were followed up regarding their survival for at least one year. The modified modified continuity index (MMCI) was used as the indicator of continuity of care. Cox proportional hazard models with robust sandwich variance estimates were employed to analyze the correlation between continuity of care and stroke-related death.A total of 9,252 stroke patients were included in the analysis. Those patients who had a high and a completed COC had a higher percentage of survival (97.25% and 95.39%) compared to the other two groups. After controlling for other variables, compared with the low-level continuity of care group, the moderate-level, high-level and completed continuity of care groups still showed a significantly lower risk of death HR (95% CI) were: 0.63 (0.49-0.80), 0.56 (0.40-0.79) and 0.50 (0.39-0.63), respectively.Continuity of care may increase the survival among stroke patients and therefore plays an important role in management of stroke after survival."

The aim of this study was to investigate the role of fructosylated-HSA-AGE in the pathogenesis of fatty liver (NAFLD and NASH) by biochemical, immunological and histological studies. Immunogenicity of fructosylated-HSA-AGE was probed by inducing antibodies in rabbits. Fructosylated-HSA-AGE was found to be highly immunogenic. Furthermore, fructosylated-HSA-AGE caused mild fibrosis with steatosis and portal inflammation of hepatocytes in experimental animals. Liver function test and dyslipidemic parameters in immunized animals were also found to be raised. Ultrasonography, which should form part of the assessment of chronically raised transaminases, shows fatty infiltration. Interestingly, alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), bilirubin, total cholesterol (TC) and triglyceride (TG) profiles confirms USG images of overweight, obese patients. Thus, present study demonstrates that fructosylated-HSA-AGE is hepatotoxic, immunologically active and may cause dyslipidemia."
