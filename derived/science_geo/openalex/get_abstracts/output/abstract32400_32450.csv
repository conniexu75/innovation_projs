https://openalex.org/W2159377066,"We have determined the sequences of isoforms of human tau protein, which differ from previously reported forms by insertions of 29 or 58 amino acids in the amino-terminal region. Complementary DNA cloning shows that the insertions occur in combination with both three and four tandem repeats. RNAase protection assays indicate that transcripts encoding isoforms with the insertions are expressed in an adult-specific manner. Transcripts encoding four tandem repeats are also expressed in an adult-specific manner, whereas mRNAs encoding three tandem repeats are expressed throughout life, including in fetal brain. The levels of transcripts encoding the 29 or 58 amino acid inserts were not significantly changed in cerebral cortex from patients with Alzheimer's disease. Antisera raised against synthetic peptides corresponding to these different human tau isoforms demonstrate that multiple tau protein isoforms are incorporated into the neurofibrillary tangles of Alzheimer's disease."
https://openalex.org/W1487570186,"Cell adhesion to extracellular matrices is mediated by a set of heterodimeric cell surface receptors called integrins that might be the subject of regulation by growth and differentiation factors. We have examined the effect of transforming growth factor-beta 1 (TGF-beta 1) on the expression of the very late antigens or alpha beta 1 group of integrins in human cell lines. The six known members of this family share a common beta 1 subunit but have distinct alpha subunits that confer selective affinity toward type I collagen, fibronectin, laminin, and other as yet unknown cell adhesion proteins. Using a panel of specific antibodies and cDNA probes, we show that in WI-38 lung fibroblasts TGF-beta 1 elevates concomitantly the expression of alpha 1, alpha 2, alpha 3, alpha 5, and beta 1 integrin subunits at the protein and/or mRNA level, their assembly into the corresponding alpha beta 1 complexes, and their exposure on the cell surface. The rate of synthesis of total alpha subunits relative to beta 1 subunit is higher in TGF-beta 1-treated cells than in control cells. The characteristically slow (t1/2 approximately 10 h) rate of beta 1 conversion from precursor form to mature glycoprotein in untreated cells increases markedly (to t1/2 approximately 3 h) in response to TGF-beta 1. The results suggest that in WI-38 fibroblasts the beta 1 subunit is synthesized in excess over alpha subunits, and assembly of beta 1 subunits with rate-limiting alpha subunits is required for transit through the Golgi and exposure of alpha beta 1 complex on the cell surface. TGF-beta 1 does not induce the synthesis of integrin subunits that are not expressed in unstimulated cells, such as alpha 4 and alpha 6 subunits in WI-38 fibroblasts. However, alpha 4 and alpha 6 subunits can be regulated by TGF-beta in those cells that express them. The results suggest that TGF-beta regulates the expression of individual integrin subunits by parallel but independent mechanisms. By modifying the balance of individual alpha beta 1 integrins, TGF-beta 1 might modulate those aspects of cell migration, positioning, and development that are guided by adhesion to extracellular matrices."
https://openalex.org/W1969234784,"Mechanical stimuli are thought to open the transduction channels of a hair cell by tensing elastic components, the gating springs, that pull directly on the channels. To test this model, we measured the stiffness of hair bundles during mechanical stimulation. A bundle's compliance increased by about 40% at the position where half of the channels opened. This we attribute to conformational changes of transduction channels as they open and close. The magnitude and displacement dependence of the gating compliance provide quantitative information about the molecular basis of mechanoelectrical transduction: the force required to open each channel, the number of transduction channels per hair cell, the stiffness of a gating spring, and the swing of a channel's gate as it opens."
https://openalex.org/W1966614543,"Tau protein has been shown to be an integral component of Alzheimer paired helical filaments (PHF). However, the extent to which tau is incorporated into PHF has not been clear because the antibodies used to label PHF generally do not have precisely defined epitopes. Here we define the antigenic sites for five monoclonal antibodies that react with tau and cross-react with SDS-extracted neurofibrillary tangles. The reactive sites were determined by screening a lambda gt11 sublibrary expressing small fragments of the tau sequence. The mapped epitopes were found to span almost the entire length of tau, suggesting that PHF contains tau in its entirety or nearly in its entirety. One antibody was found to cross-react with microtubule-associated protein 2, implying some degree of homology between the two proteins."
https://openalex.org/W1992559178,"Development of a culture system for mammalian olfactory epithelium has permitted the process of neurogenesis to be examined in vitro. Antibody markers allowing the unambiguous identification of putative neuroepithelial stem cells (keratin+ basal cells) and differentiated neurons (N-CAM+ olfactory receptor neurons) are described. In combination with [3H]thymidine uptake analysis, these antibodies have been used to characterize the existence, proliferation, and differentiation of the immediate neuronal precursor in this system. This cell is distinct from basal cells and rapidly sorts out from them, dividing as it migrates. Data are presented which suggest that the precursor follows a simple lineage program, dividing to give rise to two N-CAM+ daughter neurons. Although this precursor efficiently generates neurons in defined medium, neurogenesis subsequently ceases because new precursors are not produced, suggesting that epigenetic factors may regulate continual neurogenesis in this system."
https://openalex.org/W2089331767,"To obtain definitive evidence that tau is a component of paired helical filaments (PHF) in Alzheimer's disease, we fractionated and sequenced PHF-derived peptides according to a previously described procedure. In the PHF digest, we found four independent tau peptides that were located in the carboxyl third of tau. Subsequent extensive analysis of the PHF digest did not provide any other tau peptides. The conventional PHF antiserum and a new antiserum directed toward formic acid-denatured PHF reacted with the distinct CNBr fragments of tau localized on the carboxy-terminal portion of tau by protein sequencing. From these observations, we conclude that the carboxyl third of tau is tightly bound to PHF."
https://openalex.org/W2022804978,"To analyze the developmental potential of individual neural crest cells or their precursors, we have microinjected a vital dye, lysinated rhodamine dextran (LRD), into single cells in the dorsal neural tube. The phenotypes of the descendants that inherited the LRD from the injected cells were evaluated based upon their position, morphology, and neurofilament expression. Individual neural crest cells labeled before or as they emigrated from the neural tube gave rise to both sensory and sympathetic neurons as well as nonneuronal cells, some of which had the morphological characteristics of Schwann cells or pigment cells. In numerous cases, the descendants of a single cell included both neural crest- and neural tube-derived neurons, suggesting that some cells of the peripheral and central nervous systems share a common lineage. Our data demonstrate definitively that both emigrating and premigratory trunk neural crest cells can be multipotent, giving rise not only to cells in multiple neural crest derivatives, but also to both neuronal and nonneuronal elements within a given derivative."
https://openalex.org/W2081426113,"We have isolated the gene encoding the Schwann cell glycoprotein P0, the major structural protein of the peripheral myelin sheath. In rats and mice, this gene is split into six exons distributed over 7 kb of DNA. The segregation of these exons is consistent with the functional segregation of the P0 protein into extracellular, membrane-spanning, and cytoplasmic domains. We find that the P0 extracellular domain is similar in structure to a single immunoglobulin variable region domain. In contrast to prototypical immunoglobulin domains, however, this P0 domain is encoded by two exons, the partitioning of which provides genetic evidence for the evolution of immunoglobulin-related domains from an ancestral half-domain. We also describe procedures for transfection of cultures of nontransformed rat Schwann cells and use these procedures to show that the Schwann cell-specific expression of the P0 gene is controlled by cis-acting elements localized upstream of exon I."
https://openalex.org/W1745529008,"The present research describes studies which address the mechanism of prostacyclin (PGI2) and thromboxane A2 (TXA2) biosynthesis. In addition to prostaglandin H1 (PGH1), PGG2, PGH2, and PGH3, also 8-iso-PGH2, 13(S)-hydroxy-PGH2, and 15-keto-PGH2 were applied to determine the substrate specificities and kinetics of prostacyclin and thromboxane synthase in more detail. Human platelet thromboxane synthase converted PGH1, 8-iso-PGH2, 13(S)-hydroxy-PGH2 and 15-keto-PGH2 into the corresponding heptadecanoic acid (C17) plus malondialdehyde, whereas the thromboxane derivative was formed only from PGG2, PGH2, and PGH3 together with the corresponding C17 metabolite and malondialdehyde in a 1:1:1 ratio. In contrast, PGG2, PGH2, 13(S)-hydroxy-PGH2, 15-keto-PGH2 and PGH3 were almost completely isomerized to the corresponding prostacyclin derivative by bovine aortic prostacyclin synthase, whereas PGH1 and 8-iso-PGH2 only produced the corresponding C17 hydroxy acid plus malondialdehyde. Isotope-labeling experiments with [5,6,8,9,11,12,14,15-2H]PGH2 revealed complete retention of label and no isotope effect in the course of thromboxane biosynthesis, but the loss of one 2H atom at C-6 with an isotope effect of 1.20 during PGI2 formation. Prostacyclin and thromboxane synthase bind both 9,11-epoxymethano-PGF2α and 11,9-epoxymethano-PGF2α at the heme iron, but according to their difference spectra in opposite ways with respect to the 9- and 11-position. In agreement with published model studies, a cage radical mechanism is proposed for both enzymes according to which the initial radical process is terminated through oxidation of carbon-centered radicals by the iron-sulfur catalytic site, followed by ionic rearrangement to PGI2 or TXA2. Various Fe(III) model compounds as well as liver microsomes or cytochrome P-450CAM can also form small amounts of PGI2 and TXA2, but mainly yield 12(S)-hydroxy-5,8,10-heptadecatrienoic acid plus malondialdehyde probably by a radical fragmentation pathway."
https://openalex.org/W1589221052,"Cloning of complementary DNAs that encode either of two forms of the α subunit of the guanine nucleotidebinding regulatory protein (Gs) that stimulates adenylyl cyclase into appropriate plasmid vectors has allowed these proteins to be synthesized in Escherichia coli (Graziano, M. P., Casey, P. J., and Gilman, A. G. (1987) J. Biol. Chem. 262, 11375–11381). A rapid procedure for purification of milligram quantities of these proteins is described. As expressed in E. coli, both forms of Gsα, (apparent molecular weights of 45,000 and 52,000) bind guanosine 5′-(3-O-thio)triphosphate stoichiometrically. The proteins also hydrolyze GTP, although at different rates (i.e. 0.13•min−1 and 0.34•min−1 at 20 °C for the 45- and the 52-kDa forms, respectively). These rates reflect differences in the rate of dissociation of GDP from the two proteins. Both forms of recombinant Gsα, have essentially the same kcat for GTP hydrolysis, ∼4. min−1. Recombinant Gsα, interacts functionally with G protein βγ subunits and with β-adrenergic receptors. The proteins can also be ADP-ribosylated stoichiometrically by cholera toxin. This reaction requires the addition of βγ subunits. Both forms of recombinant Gsα, can reconstitute GTP-, isoproterenol + GTP-, guanosine 5′-(3-O-thio)triphosphate-, and fluoride-stimulated adenylyl cyclase activity in S49 cyc− membranes to maximal levels, although their specific activities for this reaction are lower than that observed for Gs purified from rabbit liver. Experiments with purified bovine brain adenylyl cyclase indicate that the affinity of recombinant Gsα for adenylyl cyclase is 5–10 times lower than that of liver Gs under these assay conditions; however, the intrinsic capacity of the recombinant protein to activate adenylyl cyclase is normal. These findings suggest that Gsα, when synthesized in E. coli, may fail to undergo a posttranslational modification that is crucial for high affinity interaction of the G protein with adenylyl cyclase."
https://openalex.org/W2131585770,"The protein products of the mammalian ras genes, p21ras, are regulatory guanine nucleotide binding proteins that are involved in the control of cell proliferation, though the exact biochemical processes regulated are unknown. Recently a cytoplasmic protein has been identified that interacts with and increases the GTPase activity of p21ras. It has been shown that this GTPase-activating protein, or GAP, interacts with the effector domain of ras, leading us and others to propose that GAP may be the target for regulation by p21ras. It has become apparent that ras sis part of a much larger family of proteins, and at least 15 ras-related genes have now been identified in the mammalian genome. Each encodes a small (about 21 kDa) guanine nucleotide binding protein, but the functions of none of these regulatory molecules are known. We report here that mammalian cytoplasmic extracts contain GAP-like activity toward the products of two other ras-related genes, R-ras and rho. It appears that p23R-ras interacts with the same 125-kDa GAP protein as p21ras whereas p21rho interacts with a distinct 29-kDa protein, rho GAP."
https://openalex.org/W1985431192,"Myelin-associated glycoprotein (MAG) cDNA clones for the small (p67) and large (p72) forms were expressed in heterologous cells. Purified recombinant MAG protein was incorporated into fluorescent liposomes, and both forms were shown to bind predominantly to neurites in DRG or spinal cord cultures. This adhesion was completely blocked by Fab fragments of monoclonal anti-MAG antibody. Liposomes prepared with the control protein glycophorin or no protein failed to bind neurites. Small cerebellar neurons, which are not myelinated in vivo, failed to bind MAG liposomes. In a second test of function, p67 MAG-transfected fibroblasts were markedly enhanced in their ability to promote DRG neurite extension over a 2 day culture period compared with control fibroblasts not expressing MAG. Neurite extension was blocked by anti-MAG antibodies. These results show that both forms of MAG can facilitate the interactions between glial cells and neurites that ultimately lead to myelin formation."
https://openalex.org/W2020315178,"The neuronal nicotinic acetylcholine receptor subunits alpha 2, alpha 3, and alpha 4 form functional receptors with the beta 2 subunit. Each of these subunit combinations shows two distinct open states (referred to as primary and secondary). The primary open states of alpha 2 beta 2, alpha 3 beta 2, and alpha 4 beta 2 receptors were 33.6 +/- 1.8 pS, 15.4 +/- 0.8 pS, and 13.3 +/- 1.5 pS, respectively. The open times of the alpha 3 beta 2 primary open state were significantly longer than the open times of the other primary conductance states. The secondary open states of alpha 2 beta 2 and alpha 3 beta 2 were 15.5 +/- 1.3 pS and 5.1 +/- 0.4 pS, respectively. Secondary open states were seen infrequently with alpha 4 beta 2. Oocytes injected with alpha 2 RNA and a 9-fold excess of beta 2 RNA showed an enhanced expression of the secondary open state."
https://openalex.org/W2091201090,"The regulatory region of the rat preproglucagon gene targets expression of the SV40 large T oncoprotein to two cell types in transgenic mice, the pancreatic alpha cells and a set of neurons localized in the hindbrain, both of which normally produce preproglucagon. Additional neurons in the forebrain and midbrain stain for T antigen but do not express the endogenous glucagon gene. Synthesis of T antigen in endocrine alpha cells results in the heritable development of pancreatic glucagonomas. In brains of transgenic mice from three independent lineages, expression of the hybrid gene begins at embryonic day 12 in neuroblasts of the hindbrain, where it continues throughout adult life, most notably in the medulla. Remarkably, oncoprotein expression in both proliferating neuroblasts and mature neurons has no apparent consequences, either phenotypic or tumorigenic. Expression of the hybrid glucagon gene in both neurons and islet cells supports a possible interrelationship between these cell types."
https://openalex.org/W2050271088,"Cultured human cells were transfected with cloned rat glycine receptor (GlyR) 48 kd subunit cDNA. In these cells glycine elicited large chloride currents (up to 1.5 nA), which were blocked by nanomolar concentrations of strychnine. However, no corresponding high-affinity binding of [3H]strychnine was detected in membrane preparations of the transfected cells. Analysis by monoclonal antibodies specific for the 48 kd subunit revealed high expression levels of this membrane protein. After solubilization, the 48 kd subunit behaved as a macromolecular complex when analyzed by sucrose density centrifugation. Approximately 50% of the solubilized complex bound specifically to a 2-aminostrychnine affinity column, indicating the existence of low-affinity antagonist binding sites on most of the expressed GlyR protein. Thus, the 48 kd strychnine binding subunit efficiently assembles into high molecular weight complexes, resembling the native spinal cord GlyR. However, formation of functional receptor channels of high affinity for strychnine occurs with low efficiency."
https://openalex.org/W1989624644,"Charybdotoxin (CTX), a 37 amino acid protein isolated from the venom of L. quinquestriatus, is a high-affinity blocker of various Ca2(+)-activated K+ channels. CTX also blocks Drosophila Shaker (Sh) clone H4 transient K+ currents expressed in Xenopus oocytes with similar affinity (Kd = 3.6 nM). CTX blocks both the open and the closed states of Sh channels with no apparent change in gating behavior. In addition, the block is enhanced as the ionic strength is lowered. These properties are identical to those of CTX block of Ca(+)-activated K+ channels, and these results suggest that the external pore openings of these two functionally dissimilar K+ channels may share common structural features."
https://openalex.org/W2130127829,"The potential functional significance of nerve growth factor (NGF) receptors in spinal motoneurons was studied in newborn rats. 125I-NGF was specifically retrogradely transported by motoneurons from their peripheral nerve terminals. This transport was blocked by an excess of unlabeled NGF but not by cytochrome c. 125I-cytochrome c was not transported. The monoclonal anti-rat NGF receptor antibody, but not a control antibody, was also transported. Despite this ability of motoneurons to transport NGF, treatment of newborn rats with this factor did not increase motoneuron size or synthesis of neurotransmitter enzymes and did not prevent cell death after axotomy. We conclude that NGF receptors of spinal motoneurons can bind, internalize, and retrogradely transport NGF. However, these receptors do not mediate the classic trophic effects of NGF."
https://openalex.org/W1976070297,"Serotinin (5-HT) induced a slow depolarization when superfused onto neurons of the rat brainstem nucleus prepositus hypoglossi (PH) in vitro. The depolarization was associated with a decrease in cell input resistance. In voltage clamp, 5-HT caused an inward current that activated at approximately −50 mV and was present only at potentials negative to this. With hyperpolarizing voltage-clamp steps, PH neurons exhibited a slow inward current relaxation. The properties of this conductance were consistent with the cationic, nonselective current, Ih Bath-applied 5-HT augmented Ih. Extracellular CsCI blocked both Ih and the inward current produced by 5-HT. In addition, forskolin, isobutylmethylxanthine, and 8-bromo-CAMP mimicked the inward current seen with 5-HT. The 5-HT1 agonist 5-carboxamidotryptamine produced a similar inward current. We conclude that 5-HT excites PH neurons by augmenting Ih, probably through receptor-mediated stimulation of adenylate cyclase. As Ih is found in many types of neurons, this mechanism may be a common mode of regulating cell excitability."
https://openalex.org/W2002420908,"Vertebrate rod and cone photoreceptors hyperpolarize when illuminated. However, synaptic input from horizontal cells can depolarize cones and even elicit action potentials. Using the whole-cell tight-seal recording technique, we determined that, in solitary cones isolated from a lizard retina, action potentials can be generated by depolarizing current steps under conditions where only two ionic currents are activated. A dihydropyridine-sensitive, inward Ca2+ current that activates at potentials positive to -40 mV can regeneratively depolarize the cell. Subsequently, a SITS-sensitive, Ca2(+)-dependent outward Cl- current repolarizes the cell. We suggest that these ionic currents may help explain lateral inhibition in the retina."
https://openalex.org/W2024881161,"The hypothesis that acetylcholine, substance P, and LHRH suppress M-current by activating phospholipase C was tested. Each agonist caused turnover of phosphoinositide, as measured by release of inositol phosphates, and a modest transient rise in intracellular free Ca2+ ([Ca2+]i), as determined with fura-2. Active phorhol esters depressed M-current only 50% and did not prevent further suppression by LHRH. M-current, its control by agonists, and its depression by phorbol esters were not affected by adding inositol trisphosphate or Ca2+ buffers with high or low Cal+ to the whole-cell, voltage-clamp pipette. We conclude that phospholipase C activation does occur but does not mediate the suppression of M-current by agonists. Caffeine produced large [Ca2+]i transients and acted as an agonist to suppress M-current."
https://openalex.org/W2066479669,"In adult vertebrate skeletal muscle acetylcholine receptors are localized to the neuromuscular junction. Upon denervation, this distribution changes, with new receptors appearing in extrajunctional regions of the muscle fiber. The location of acetylcholine receptors in innervated or denervated muscle may result, in part, from the distribution of their RNAs. This was tested by assaying for receptor RNAs in junctional and extrajunctional regions of innervated and denervated rat soleus muscle using in situ hybridization and RNAase protection assays. These experiments showed α, β, and δ subunit RNAs concentrated beneath the endplates of innervated muscle fibers. Following denervation, there was an unequal distribution of receptor RNAs along the muscle fiber, with highest levels occurring in extrajunctional regions near the endplate. These data are consistent with a nonuniform pattern of gene expression in adult skeletal muscle fibers."
https://openalex.org/W2080636161,"Using several antibodies against rat or human laminin and an avidin-biotin immunocytochemical protocol, laminin-like immunoreactivity was detectable in the rat nervous system in expected locations, i.e., associated with blood vessels and reactive astrocytes. However, laminin staining was also abundantly present within neuronal cell bodies in most parts of the developing and adult rat CNS. Medial septum neuronal immunoreactivity was lost after septo-hippocampal disconnection, but could be preserved or even restored by intraventricular administration of nerve growth factor. Thus, at least for medial septum neurons, this laminin-like molecule can be accumulated or produced independent of direct hippocampal (target) contact. It remains to be determined whether CNS neuronal ""laminin"" processes activities similar to those found for laminin in vitro."
https://openalex.org/W2042731416,"The alternative splicing of a previously undiscovered 30 base exon confers a new level of polypeptide diversity on the N-CAM family of cell-surface glycoproteins. It results in the insertion of 10 amino acids into the fourth of five extracellular immunoglobulin-like folds. Each major size class of rat brain N-CAM mRNAs consists of members that contain or lack the exon. Furthermore, this splicing event is developmentally controlled: RNAs containing the inserted exon are expressed at extremely low levels (less than 3%) in embryonic brain but increase postnatally to 40%-45% of all N-CAM mRNAs in adult brain. Antibodies that recognize the alternative 10 amino acid segment react with a subset of N-CAM-expressing neurons in cultures of embryonic rat cells."
https://openalex.org/W2033647807,"Single high-conductance Ca2+-activated K+ channels were incorporated into planar lipid bilayers, and the discrete block by charybdotoxin (CTX), a protein inhibitor of this channel, was studied. in particular, the effect of externally added tetraethylammonium (TEA) on CTX blocking kinetics was investigated. TEA decreases the on-rate of CTX in exact proportion to its blocking of the single-channel current. The CTX off-rate is unaffected by TEA. The results demonstrate that TEA and CTZ are mutually exclusive in their binding to the channel. Since the site of TEA binding is known to be located on the external side of the conduction pore, this result further strengthens the proposal that the CTX binding site is located in the external mouth of the channel."
https://openalex.org/W2155411818,"Mapping of the human MAOA gene to chromosomal region Xp21-p11 prompted our study of two affected males in a family previously reported to have Norrie disease resulting from a submicroscopic deletion in this chromosomal region. In this investigation we demonstrate in these cousins deletion of the MAOA gene, undetectable levels of MAO-A and MAO-B activities in their fibroblasts and platelets, respectively, loss of mRNA for MAO-A in fibroblasts, and substantial alterations in urinary catecholamine metabolites. The present study documents that a marked deficiency of MAO activity is compatible with life and that genes for MAO-A and MAO-B are near each other in this Xp chromosomal region. Some of the clinical features of these MAO deletion patients may help to identify X-linked MAO deficiency diseases in humans."
https://openalex.org/W2033964802,"Glia-derived nexin (GDN) is a 43 kd cell-secreted protease inhibitor with neurite promoting activity. We have raised specific polyclonal antisera to rat GDN. These antibodies stain a single band at 43 kd on immunoblots of concentrated C6 glioma-conditioned medium and have been used to demonstrate that GDN is present in the olfactory system of the rat. One band at 43 kd is recognized by the GDN antibodies on immunoblots of olfactory bulb homogenate. Immunohistochemistry shows that GDN occurs predominantly in the olfactory nerve layer of the olfactory bulb and in the olfactory submucosa. Comparative studies with antibodies against vimentin, GFAP, and fibronectin suggest that anti-GDN recognizes cells associated with the olfactory system, but not exclusively the olfactory neurons themselves. Data from the immunohistochemical studies were confirmed by RNA blots and GDN mRNA expression throughout development of the olfactory bulb. The high levels of GDN in the rat olfactory system may be related to the continuous degeneration and regeneration phenomena taking place in these structures."
https://openalex.org/W1544998262,"The use of digitonin to permeabilize Trypanosoma cruzi plasma membrane enabled us to study Ca2+ transport and oxidative phosphorylation in mitochondria in situ. Addition of Ca2+ to these preparations evoked a cycle of respiratory stimulation. Ca2+ uptake was partially inhibited by ruthenium red, almost totally inhibited by antimycin A, and stimulated by inorganic phosphate. Addition of carbonyl cyanide p-trifluoromethoxyphenylhydrazone to digitonin-permeabilized T. cruzi epimastigotes under steady-state conditions was followed by Ca2+ release. Antimycin A- and carbonyl cyanide p-trifluoromethoxyphenylhydrazonein-sensitive Ca2+ uptake was also detected in digitonin-permeabilized epimastigotes. Accordingly, ATP stimulated Ca2+ uptake by preparations de-energized by oligomycin and antimycin A. In conclusion, in contrast to previous reports indicating that a Ca2+ transport system occurs only in mitochondria from vertebrate tissues, T. cruzi epimastigotes also possess a similar system. In addition, these protozoan mitochondria have an extremely high resistance to the deleterious effects of massive Ca2+ loads in comparison with most types of mammalian mitochondria."
https://openalex.org/W1549735935,"A combination of in vivo and in vitro approaches were used to characterize phosphorylation sites on the 70,000-kilodalton (kDa) subunit of neurofilaments (NF-L) and to identify the protein kinases that are likely to mediate these modifications in vivo. Neurofilament proteins in a single class of neurons, the retinal ganglion cells, were pulse-labeled in vivo by injecting mice intravitreously with [32P]orthophosphate. Radiolabeled neurofilaments were isolated after they had advanced along optic axons, and the individual subunits were separated on sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gels. Two-dimensional alpha-chymotryptic phosphopeptide map analysis of NF-L revealed three phosphorylation sites: an intensely labeled peptide (L-1) and two less intensely labeled peptides (L-2 and L-3). The alpha-chymotryptic peptide L-1 was identified as the 11-kDa segment containing the C terminus of NF-L. The ability of these peptides to serve as substrates for specific protein kinases were examined by incubating neurofilament preparations with [gamma-32P]ATP in the presence of purified cAMP-dependent protein kinase or appropriate activators and/or inhibitors of endogenous cytoskeleton-associated protein kinases. The heparin-sensitive, calcium- and cyclic nucleotide-independent kinase associated with the cytoskeleton selectively phosphorylated L-1 and L-3 but had little, if any, activity toward L-2. When this kinase was inhibited with heparin, cAMP addition to the neurofilament preparation stimulated the phosphorylation of L-2, and addition of the purified catalytic subunit of cAMP-dependent protein kinase induced intense labeling of L-2. At higher labeling efficiencies, the exogenous kinase also phosphorylated L-3 and several sites at which labeling was not detected in vivo; however, L-1 was not a substrate. Calcium and calmodulin added to neurofilament preparations in the presence of heparin modestly stimulated the phosphorylation of L-1 and L-3, but not L-2, and the stimulation was reversed by trifluoperazine. The selective phosphorylation of different polypeptide domains on NF-L by second messenger-dependent and -independent kinases suggests multiple functions for phosphate groups on this protein."
https://openalex.org/W1983378730,"The action of desipramine (DMI) and promazine on the response of mouse hippocampal neurons to the excitatory amino acid N-methyl-D-aspartic acid (NMDA) was investigated using whole-cell and single-channel recording. DMI at 20-50 microM was a potent, selective antagonist of responses to NMDA but not kainate or quisqualate. At -60 mV, the Kd for DMI block of responses to NMDA was 10 microM. The potency of DMI as an NMDA antagonist was highly voltage-dependent and behaved as though the Kd increased e-fold per 36 mV depolarization, reflecting an increase in the dissociation rate constant. Prior block of NMDA receptors with Mg2+ prevented binding of DMI, suggesting an action in the open channel. Single-channel analysis showed a decrease in the open time and burst length distributions, consistent with binding of DMI to open channels. We suggest that the action of DMI on NMDA receptor channels is similar to that of MK-801 and does not reflect binding to other domains, such as the regulatory sites for Zn2+ and glycine."
https://openalex.org/W2062367006,"The response of invertebrate photoreceptors consists of the summation of quantum bumps, each representing the response to a single photon. The bumps adapt depending on the intensity of the stimulus: their average size is relatively large in dim light and small in bright light. The rate of occurrence of the bumps varies proportionally with light intensity. In the Drosophila mutant trp, unlike in the wild type, the rate does not increase with increasing light intensity and the bumps do not adapt. Here we report an analysis of the trp gene and its expression in normal and mutant flies. Our results suggest that the trp protein is a novel photoreceptor membrane-associated protein, that this protein is not required for the occurrence of bumps but is necessary for adaptation, and that proper function of the trp gene product during pupal development is important for normal visual transduction in the adult."
https://openalex.org/W1485010523,"Measurements of free cystolic Ca2+ ([Ca2+]i) and Ba2+ ([Ba2+]i) concentrations with Fura 2 were used to identify and characterize the properties of a depolarization-activated Ca2+ and Ba2+ entry in the plasma membrane of osteoblast-like cells. The presence of this pathway was demonstrated in two osteoblastic cell lines, UMR-106 and MC3T3-E1 and osteoblasts isolated from rat long bone and rat neonatal calvariae. Subsequent characterization of the pathway was performed in the osteosarcoma cell line UMR-106. Depolarization of the cells with high medium K+ was followed by an increase in [Ca2+]i which was dependent on medium Ca2+. Ba2+ ions depolarized the cells and were transported by this pathway. Mg2+ ions interfered with Ca2+ and Ba2+ entry. At 140 mM KCl and 1 mM MgCl2, the pathway could be saturated with Ca2+ or Ba2+. The apparent affinity for Ca2+ was 0.78 mM and for Ba2+ 1.82 mM. Ca2+ or Ba2+ entry into the cells was blocked by low concentrations of nicardipine, diltiazem, verapamil, and La3+. In the absence of an increase in [Ca2+]i or [Ba2+]i, the pathway inactivated within about 5 min after depolarization. When [Ca2+]i or [Ba2+]i was allowed to increase, the pathway inactivated within about 20 s. These properties suggest that Ca2+ and Ba2+ entry are mediated by an L-type, depolarization-activated Ca2+ channel in osteoblasts. The activity of these channels changes little with an increase or decrease in cell volume. Thus, it is concluded that these pathways do not provide the Ca2+ entry pathway required for initiation of volume decrease by osteoblasts."
https://openalex.org/W2072043893,"The early development of excitability of amphibian spinal neurons is characterized by a change from a long Ca2(+)-dependent action potential to a brief Na(+)-dependent impulse. The delayed rectifier K+ current plays a major role in this cell autonomous differentiation. Here we show that the maturation of the delayed rectifier current, and hence the action potential, involves a critical period of mRNA synthesis. It is blocked by inhibition of transcription during an early period of development in culture and fails to develop following removal of the inhibitor and resumption of RNA synthesis. However, the development of an inactivating K+ A-current recovers in these neurons, indicating that some programs of neuronal development are affected during this critical period, while others are spared."
https://openalex.org/W2094143658,"Expression screening was used to isolate cDNA clones encoding a synaptic vesicle membrane protein, VAT-1, which is specifically expressed in the electric lobe of marine rays. The predicted protein has a molecular weight of 41,572 daltons and contains several hydrophobic regions. An antibody raised against a fusion protein synthesized in E. coli recognizes an abundant 42 kd protein that copurifies largely with synaptic vesicles. Trypsin digestion of intact and lysed vesicles as well as membrane extractions suggests that VAT-1 is an integral membrane protein. The VAT-1 RNA is localized to the electromotor nucleus, and the fusion protein antibody stains the electric organ, demonstrating that the protein is transported to nerve terminals. These studies define a novel synaptic vesicle protein that is likely to play a central role in the functions mediated by specific classes of synaptic vesicles."
https://openalex.org/W1585729685,"Factor XIII is a transglutaminase important in blood coagulation and fibrinolysis. Its function is to catalyze peptide bond formation between the γ-carboxamide group of glutamines in one protein and the ϵ-amino group of lysine in another. There are two zymogenic forms of factor XIII: one is a noncovalent, intracellular dimer (A2); the other is a noncovalent, extracellular tetramer (A2B2). The catalytic function resides in the activated A chain (A2*). Purified forms of factor XIII (A2B2, A2, A2*B2, B) were prepared and analyzed by electron microscopy, gel filtration, and gradient centrifugation. Hydrodynamic constants were derived. Electron microscopy of rotary-shadowed molecules showed A2 to consist of two globular particles each about 6O9 nm in size. The A2 dimer is significantly elongated, 18 nm long and 6 nm in diameter. Sedimentation and gel filtration of the A2 dimer are consistent with this asymmetric structure. B protein is a filamentous, flexible strand with kinks, with a contour length of 30 nm and a diameter of ∼2–3 nm. The sedimentation and gel filtration behavior of the B subunit are characteristic of a highly asymmetric molecule. The observed structure of the B subunit, combined with data for its amino acid sequence, suggests a modular structure. The B subunit is a member of a family of proteins composed of tandem, repeating structures (referred to as GP-I domains); the structure seen by electron microscopy for B subunit is probably applicable to all proteins in this family. Plasma and platelet factor XIII zymogens are tetrameric and dimeric, but B protein, in the absence of A protein, appears to be monomeric. Our model for the A2B2 zymogen has the elongated A2 dimer forming the core and the two B strands wrapping around the outside."
https://openalex.org/W2168259812,"We describe a new strategy for producing tissue-specific cDNA libraries and subsequently identifying tissue-specific clones. This method was used to screen for cDNA clones corresponding to RNAs expressed in the Drosophila head that cannot be detected in the early embryo. RNA blots were used to assess the spatial and temporal patterns of expression of these RNAs. The ensemble of 436 head-not-embryo clones identified roughly 700 distinct RNAs that are differentially expressed in the Drosophila head. The RNA expression patterns can be classified into five major categories. It is argued that this ensemble of clones represents a large fraction of all genes differentially expressed in the adult head, but not detected in the early embryo. Many of these genes are likely to encode eye- and nervous system-specific products."
https://openalex.org/W2009082256,"Chick pineal cells contain circadian oscillators that regulate a rhythm of melatonin biosynthesis. We explored the role of cAMP in regulating this melatonin rhythm. Chick pineal cells expressed a 24 hr oscillation of cAMP efflux with a waveform similar to that of melatonin. Elevation of cAMP in chick pineal cells stimulated melatonin. These results suggest that an oscillation of cAMP regulates the rhythm of melatonin. We investigated whether cAMP was a component of the circadian oscillator by determining the effects of 8-Br cAMP pulses on the phase of the circadian melatonin rhythm. Six hour pulses of 8-Br cAMP did not cause steady-state phase shifts of the rhythm. The acute regulation of melatonin by cAMP, the 24 hr oscillation of cAMP, and the inability of cAMP to phase-shift the melatonin rhythm strongly suggest that cAMP acts as an output signal of the circadian oscillator."
https://openalex.org/W1485654010,"Abstract Polypeptide chain initiation in mammalian systems is regulated at the level of the guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF). This multisubunit protein catalyzes the exchange of GDP bound to eukaryotic initiation factor 2 (eIF-2) for GTP. Although various models have been proposed for its mode of action, the exact sequence of events involved in nucleotide exchange is still uncertain. We have studied this reaction by three different experimental techniques: (a) membrane filtration assays to measure the release of [3H]GDP from the eIF-2.[3H]GDP binary complex, (b) changes in the steady-state polarization of fluorescamine-GDP during the nucleotide exchange reaction, and (c) sucrose gradient analysis of the total reaction. The results obtained do not support the reaction as written: eIF-2.GDP + GEF in equilibrium eIF-2.GEF + GDP. The addition of GEF alone does not result in the displacement of eIF-2-bound GDP. The release of bound GDP is dependent on the presence of both GTP and GEF, and this argues against the possibility of a substituted enzyme (ping-pong) mechanism for the guanine nucleotide exchange reaction. An important finding of the present study is the observation that GTP binds to GEF. The Kd value of 4 microM for GTP was estimated (a) by the extent of quenching of tryptophan fluorescence of GEF in the presence of GTP and (b) by the binding of [3H]GTP to GEF as measured on nitrocellulose membranes. The GEF-dependent release of eIF-2-bound GDP was studied at several constant concentrations of one substrate (GTP or eIF-2.GDP) while varying the second substrate concentration, and the results were then plotted according to the Lineweaver-Burk method. Taken together, the results of GTP and eIF-2.GDP binding to GEF and the pattern of the double-reciprocal plots strongly suggest that the guanine nucleotide exchange reaction follows a sequential mechanism."
https://openalex.org/W2056261986,"The amino acid sequences of two catalytic (C) subunits of Aplysia cAMP-dependent protein kinase (cAPK) have been deduced from the nucleotide sequences of cDNAs generated from neuronal poly(A)+ RNA. Both subunits contain 352 residues and are identical except for amino acids 142-183, which differ at 10 out of 42 positions. They derive from alternatively spliced transcripts of a single gene (CAPL) containing two mutually exclusive exon cassettes. CAPL transcripts are present in several classes of identified neurons containing transmitter-sensitive adenylate cyclase, including sensory cells, bag cells, and the left pleural giant cell. Combinatorial expression of the various regulatory (R) and C subunits might produce kinase isoforms with distinct roles in neuronal modulation. Alternatively, holoenzymes with overlapping properties together might contribute to the definition of individual cell types and physiological states."
https://openalex.org/W2089712673,"We have tested the hypothesis that developmentally significant cellular subsets are present in the early stages of neural crest ontogenesis. Cultured quail trunk neural crest cells probed with the monoclonal antibodies HNK-1 and R24 exhibited heterogeneous staining patterns. Fluorescence-activated cell sorting was used to isolate the HNK-1+ and HNK-1- cell populations at 2 days in vitro. When these cell populations were cultured, the HNK-1+ sorted cells differentiated into melanocytes, unpigmented cells, and numerous catecholamine-positive (CA+) cells. In contrast, the HNK-1- sorted cells gave rise to melanocytes and unpigmented cells, but few, if any, CA+ cells. When neural crest cells at 2 days in vitro were labeled with R24 and sorted, both the R24+ the R24- sorted cell populations produced numerous CA+ cell, melanocytes, and unpigmented cells. These results provide evidence for the existence of developmental preferences in some subsets of neural crest cells early in embryogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W2090061450,"We have used P element-mediated germline transformation to express ShB channels in Shaker mutant Drosophila and have examined their properties by patch-clamp of embryonic myotubes. The transformed ShB cDNA was placed under the transcriptional control of a heat shock promoter (hsp70). Northern blots revealed that transformed DNA is efficiently transcribed in response to heat shock. Cultured myotubes from the transformants produced large A-type potassium currents in response to heat shock. Although qualitatively similar to native Shaker A-currents in wild-type myotubes, transformant A-current inactivates more rapidly and recovers from inactivation more rapidly, similar to ShB channels expressed in Xenopus oocytes. Unlike the channels in oocytes, however, the transformant A-current is insensitive to 50 nM charybdotoxin."
https://openalex.org/W2055042791,"Mice homozygous for the myelin-deficient (mld) mutation have an unusual phenotype in which the gene encoding myelin basic protein (MBP) is expressed at low levels and on an abnormal developmental schedule. In this report we describe the organization of the mld MBP locus, which results in this alteration of MBP expression. The mld MBP locus consists of two tandem MBP genes, with the upstream gene containing an inversion of its 3' region. We also demonstrate that although there are low steady-state levels of MBP RNA in mld mice, the mld MBP locus is transcribed at a rate comparable to that of the wild-type MBP gene, indicating that the MBP transcripts are abnormally unstable."
https://openalex.org/W2073652471,"During leech embryogenesis, interactions between homologous neurons in neighboring segments lead to the selective retraction of longitudinal axonal projections by midbody AP and AE neurons, which maintain lateral axonal projections to the periphery. Results of experiments reported here show that disconnecting the lateral projections from the periphery rescues the projections normally fated to retract. We propose that these neurons normally progress through two states during early development, one in which they are insensitive to interactions with their homologs (state A) and a second in which they are sensitive (state B). Establishment of lateral connections with their targets triggers the switch from state A to state B; cutting these projections puts neurons back to state A."
https://openalex.org/W1559048670,"A new reactive fluorescent ADP analog has been synthesized: 2-[(4-bromo-2,3-dioxobutyl)thio]-1,N6-ethenoadenosine 5'-diphosphate (2-BDB-T epsilon A-5'-DP). Rabbit muscle pyruvate kinase is inactivated by 200 microM 2-BDB-T epsilon A-5'-DP in a biphasic manner, with an initial loss of 75% activity followed by a slow total inactivation. The rate constants for both phases exhibit nonlinear dependence on reagent concentration, consistent with reversible formation of an enzyme-reagent complex (KI = 133 microM) prior to irreversible reaction. Loss of activity is prevented by substrates. The best protection against inactivation is provided by phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP), KCl, and MnSO4, suggesting that the reaction occurs in the region of the PEP binding site. Incorporation of 1.7 mol/mol enzyme subunit accompanies 90% inactivation by 200 microM 2-BDB-T epsilon A-5'-DP in 80 min. However, in the presence of PEP, KCl, and MnSO4, 1.0 mol of reagent is incorporated when the enzyme is only 14% inactivated. These results indicate that 2-BDB-T epsilon A-5'-DP reacts with two groups on the enzyme, one of which is at or near the PEP binding site. Incubation of pyruvate kinase with related nucleotide analogs lacking a 5'-diphosphate or a diketo group suggests that the diketo group, but not the diphosphate, is essential for inactivation. The enolized form of the bromodioxobutyl group resembles phosphoenolpyruvate and probably directs the reagent to the PEP binding site. Modified enzyme, prepared by incubating pyruvate kinase with 200 microM 2-BDB-T epsilon A-5'-DP in the absence and presence of phosphoenolpyruvate, KCl, and MnSO4, was reduced with [3H]NaBH4, carboxymethylated, and digested with trypsin. Nucleotidyl peptides were isolated by chromatography on phenylboronateagarose followed by reverse phase high pressure liquid chromatography. Two radioactive peptides were identified: Asn162-Ile-Cys-Lys165 and Ile141-Thr-Leu-Asp-Asn-Ala-Tyr-Met-Glu-Lys150. Only the tetrapeptide was modified in the presence of PEP, KCl, and Mn+ when the enzyme retained most of its activity. Cys164 is thus designated the nonessential modified residue, while modification of Tyr147 near the active site of pyruvate kinase is responsible for loss of enzymatic activity. The observed biphasic kinetics of inactivation are due to the negatively cooperative reaction of 2-BDB-T epsilon A-5'-DP with Tyr147 in the tetramer. The new compound, 2-BDB-T epsilon A-5'-DP, may have general application as an affinity label of ADP and PEP sites in other proteins."

https://openalex.org/W1507777607,"We have isolated a cDNA clone of 2160 base pairs that encodes the entire collagenous domain and large parts of the adjacent globular regions of the alpha 2 subunit of chicken type VI collagen. The collagenous domain shows one interruption in the repetitive Gly-X-Y sequence and comprises 335 amino acid residues. There are seven putative cell adhesion signals (Arg-Gly-Asp) present in this domain, as well as 1 cysteine residue which may be involved in the formation of type VI collagen dimers. The cDNA hybridizes specifically to a 4.2-kilobase pair mRNA abundant in chicken and human fibroblasts. Virally transformed fibroblasts contain drastically reduced levels of this mRNA, indicating that the synthesis of type VI collagen is blocked at the transcriptional level in transformed cells."
https://openalex.org/W1561812118,"Abstract The temperature dependence of two kinetic properties of the GT2P isoform of microsomal UDP-glucuronosyltransferase was studied for enzyme in intact microsomes and for pure enzyme reconstituted into different types of lipid bilayers. The properties studied were the non-Michaelis-Menten kinetics of the enzyme and activity at Vmax(app). For enzyme in intact microsomes, the pattern of non-Michaelis-Menten kinetics was seen at all temperatures in the range tested (23 to 48 degrees C), and the slopes of the Hill plots of the data were constant across this range of temperatures. Although non-Michaelis-Menten kinetics were present for pure enzyme in bilayers of 1,2-dimyristoylphosphatidylcholine or 1,2-dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine only in the gel phase (Hockman, Y., Kelley, M., and Zakim, D. (1983) J. Biol. Chem. 258, 6509-6519), it was not possible to reconstitute this pattern of kinetics for enzyme at T greater than 40 degrees C. For example, GT2P displayed Michaelis-Menten kinetics in bilayers of 1,2-distearoylphosphatidylcholine at 44 degrees C. For enzyme in microsomes, activities at Vmax(app) increased with increasing temperature in the range 23 to 48 degrees C, with a discontinuity in the slope of the Arrhenius plot at 34 degrees C. This thermotropic property also could not be reconstituted with pure GT2P. Instead, activities at Vmax(app) for GT2P reconstituted in 1,2-dioleoylphosphatidylcholine, 1,2-distearoylphosphatidylcholine, or 1,2-stearoyl oleoylphosphatidylcholine increased in the range 23 to 37 degrees C, but then decreased at T greater than 37 degrees C. The fall in activity at T greater than 37 degrees C was reversible, indicating that GT2P undergoes a reversible change at 37 degrees C to a less active form of the enzyme. The differences between pure, reconstituted GT2P and microsomal GT2P indicate that the thermotropic properties of the microsomal enzyme are not properties of the enzyme per se but depend on interactions between it and other components in the microsome. The data suggest, therefore, that the properties of GT2P in microsomes results in part from an organization of components in the microsomal membrane."

https://openalex.org/W1575275729,"Abstract Rat oocytes synthesize tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) in response to stimuli which initiate meiotic maturation. Purified tPA exhibits optimal activity only in the presence of fibrin or fibrin substitutes. Because oocytes are not exposed to fibrin in situ, we investigated the possible stimulation of rat oocyte tPA activity by other endogenous factor(s). Oocytes were obtained from immature female rats which were induced to ovulate with gonadotropins. tPA activity was measured by the plasminogen-dependent cleavage of a chromogenic substrate. Measurements of kinetic parameters with Glu- or Lys-plasminogen revealed a Km for the rat oocyte enzyme of 1.3-2.1 microM compared with 23-24 microM for purified human tPA. Inclusion of the soluble fibrin substitute polylysine lowered the Km of human tPA by 30-fold (0.8 microM) but had no effect on the oocyte tPA Km. Polylysine had no significant effect on the Vmax values. The rate of plasminogen activation catalyzed by oocyte tPA was increased only 4.3-fold by fibrin while fibrin stimulated purified human tPA activity by 15.2-fold. After fractionation of oocyte extract by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, polylysine enhanced oocyte tPA activity as seen by casein zymography. tPA activity in the conditioned medium of a rat insulinoma cell line was also not stimulated with polylysine prior to fractionation by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. These data suggest that extravascular cells which elaborate tPA may produce stimulatory factor(s) which allow for full tPA activity at physiological concentrations of plasminogen in the absence of fibrin."
