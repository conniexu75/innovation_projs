https://openalex.org/W1975653612,"Leukemia in man can be induced by ionizing radiations and also occurs spontaneously. For the ""average"" individual in a population, the probability of developing radiation-induced leukemia is estimated to be 2 x 10(-6) per rad (unit of absorbed dose of radiation) per year. The available data from four independent sources make it likely that this estimate is valid within a factor of about 3, giving a range from 0.7 x 10(-6) to 6 x 10(-6) per rad per year. It is pointed out that 10 to 20 percent of the spontaneous incidence of leukemia (Brooklyn, 1943-52) may result from radiation from natural background sources. It is estimated that a 5- to 10-percent increase in the current spontaneous incidence of leukemia would occur if the population were to reach and maintain a body level of Sr(90) amounting to one-tenth of the ""maximum permissible concentration."""
