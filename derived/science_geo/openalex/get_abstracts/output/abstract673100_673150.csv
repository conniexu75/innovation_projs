https://openalex.org/W3158544805,"Prime editors have been delivered using DNA or RNA vectors. Here we demonstrate prime editing with purified ribonucleoprotein complexes. We introduced somatic mutations in zebrafish embryos with frequencies as high as 30% and demonstrate germline transmission. We also observed unintended insertions, deletions and prime editing guide RNA (pegRNA) scaffold incorporations. In HEK293T and primary human T cells, prime editing with purified ribonucleoprotein complexes introduced desired edits with frequencies of up to 21 and 7.5%, respectively. Prime editors are delivered as ribonucleoproteins to zebrafish embryos and human primary cells."
https://openalex.org/W3157103618,"Because of the stochasticity associated with high-throughput single-cell sequencing, current methods for exploring cell-type diversity rely on clustering-based computational approaches in which heterogeneity is characterized at cell subpopulation rather than at full single-cell resolution. Here we present Cell-ID, a clustering-free multivariate statistical method for the robust extraction of per-cell gene signatures from single-cell sequencing data. We applied Cell-ID to data from multiple human and mouse samples, including blood cells, pancreatic islets and airway, intestinal and olfactory epithelium, as well as to comprehensive mouse cell atlas datasets. We demonstrate that Cell-ID signatures are reproducible across different donors, tissues of origin, species and single-cell omics technologies, and can be used for automatic cell-type annotation and cell matching across datasets. Cell-ID improves biological interpretation at individual cell level, enabling discovery of previously uncharacterized rare cell types or cell states. Cell-ID is distributed as an open-source R software package."

https://openalex.org/W3158694246,"CRISPR screens have been used to connect genetic perturbations with changes in gene expression and phenotypes. Here we describe a CRISPR-based, single-cell combinatorial indexing assay for transposase-accessible chromatin (CRISPR-sciATAC) to link genetic perturbations to genome-wide chromatin accessibility in a large number of cells. In human myelogenous leukemia cells, we apply CRISPR-sciATAC to target 105 chromatin-related genes, generating chromatin accessibility data for ~30,000 single cells. We correlate the loss of specific chromatin remodelers with changes in accessibility globally and at the binding sites of individual transcription factors (TFs). For example, we show that loss of the H3K27 methyltransferase EZH2 increases accessibility at heterochromatic regions involved in embryonic development and triggers expression of genes in the HOXA and HOXD clusters. At a subset of regulatory sites, we also analyze changes in nucleosome spacing following the loss of chromatin remodelers. CRISPR-sciATAC is a high-throughput, single-cell method for studying the effect of genetic perturbations on chromatin in normal and disease states."
https://openalex.org/W3159670706,"Improving genetic yield potential in major food grade crops such as soybean (Glycine max L.) is the most sustainable way to address the growing global food demand and its security concerns. Yield is a complex trait and reliant on various related variables called yield components. In this study, the five most important yield component traits in soybean were measured using a panel of 250 genotypes grown in four environments. These traits were the number of nodes per plant (NP), number of non-reproductive nodes per plant (NRNP), number of reproductive nodes per plant (RNP), number of pods per plant (PP), and the ratio of number of pods to number of nodes per plant (P/N). These data were used for predicting the total soybean seed yield using the Multilayer Perceptron (MLP), Radial Basis Function (RBF), and Random Forest (RF), machine learning (ML) algorithms, individually and collectively through an ensemble method based on bagging strategy (E-B). The RBF algorithm with highest Coefficient of Determination (R 2 ) value of 0.81 and the lowest Mean Absolute Errors (MAE) and Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) values of 148.61 kg.ha -1 , and 185.31 kg.ha -1 , respectively, was the most accurate algorithm and, therefore, selected as the metaClassifier for the E-B algorithm. Using the E-B algorithm, we were able to increase the prediction accuracy by improving the values of R 2 , MAE, and RMSE by 0.1, 0.24 kg.ha -1 , and 0.96 kg.ha -1 , respectively. Furthermore, for the first time in this study, we allied the E-B with the genetic algorithm (GA) to model the optimum values of yield components in an ideotype genotype in which the yield is maximized. The results revealed a better understanding of the relationships between soybean yield and its components, which can be used for selecting parental lines and designing promising crosses for developing cultivars with improved genetic yield potential."
https://openalex.org/W3157678196,"The COVID-19 pandemic is a global challenge that is not just limited to the physical consequences but also a significant degree of a mental health crisis. Self-harm and suicide are its extreme effects. We aim to explore the impact of this pandemic on suicide and self-harm in our Emergency Department. A cross-sectional study was conducted including all fatal and nonfatal self-harm patients presenting to the emergency department during the lockdown period (March 24-June 23, 2020; Period1), matching periods in the previous year (March 24-June 23,2019; Period 2) and 3 months period prior (December 24 2019-March 23, 2020; Period 3) were included through the electronic medical record system. The prevalence and the clinical profile were compared between these three periods. A total of 125 (periods 1 = 55, 2 = 38, and 3 = 32) suicide and self-harm cases were analyzed. Suicide and self-harm had increased by 44% and 71.9% during the lockdown in comparison to periods 2 and 3. Organophosphate poisoning was the most common mode. Females were predominant in all three periods with a mean age of 32 (95%CI: 29.3–34.7). There was a significant delay in arrival of the patients in period 1 (p = 0.045) with increased hospital admission (p = 0.003) and in-hospital mortality (18.2% vs 2.6% and 3.1%) (p&lt;0.001). Our study showed an increase in suicide and self-harm cases in the emergency department during the initial phase of the COVID-19 pandemic which may reflect the increased mental health crisis in the community in low resource settings like Nepal. This study highlights the importance of priming all mental health care stakeholders to initiate mental health screening and intervention for the vulnerable population during this period of crisis."

Dental care claims data of patients aged 60 years or older diagnosed with periodontitis (n = 4,009,345) or missing teeth (n = 662,182) were used to obtain information about the numbers of teeth present and of missing teeth, respectively, and they were combined with medical care claims data including the diagnosis of Alzheimer’s disease. Numbers of teeth present and of missing teeth excluding third molars were calculated using the dental formula in the claims for periodontitis and missing teeth, respectively, and categorized into three groups each. Percentages of subjects treated for Alzheimer’s disease with 20–28, 10–19, and 1–9 teeth present were 1.95%, 3.87%, and 6.86%, respectively, in patients diagnosed as having periodontitis, and those treated for Alzheimer’s disease with 1–13, 14–27, and 28 missing teeth were 2.67%, 5.51%, and 8.70%, respectively, in patients diagnosed as having missing teeth. Logistic regression models using treatment for Alzheimer’s disease as an outcome variable and adjusting for age and sex showed that odds ratios (95% confidence intervals) for patients with 10–19 and 1–9 teeth (reference: 20–28 teeth) were 1.11 (1.10–1.13) and 1.34 (1.32–1.37), respectively, ( p &lt;0.001), in patients diagnosed as having periodontitis, and odds ratios (95% confidence intervals) for patients with 14–27 missing teeth and 28 missing teeth (reference: 1–13 missing teeth) were 1.40 (1.36–1.44) and 1.81 (1.74–1.89), respectively, ( p &lt;0.001), in patients diagnosed as having missing teeth. In conclusion, the results of the present study using Japanese dental claims data showed that older people visiting dental offices with fewer teeth present and a greater number of missing teeth are more likely to have Alzheimer’s disease."
https://openalex.org/W3158108145,"In this study we aimed to identify the predictors of drug survival for biologic and targeted synthetic DMARDs (bDMARDs and tsDMARDs) among patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) in a real-world setting. Data from RA patients receiving bDMARDs and tsDMARDs between 2007 and 2019 were extracted from the Taiwan Rheumatology Association Clinical Electronic Registry (TRACER). Patients were categorized into tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α) inhibitors, non-TNF-α inhibitors, and tofacitinib groups. The primary outcome was 3-year drug retention and the causes of bDMARDs and tsDMARDs discontinuation were recorded. Baseline demographic data before the initiation of bDMARDs and tsDMARDs treatment were analyzed to identify the predictors of 3-year drug survival. A total of 1,270 RA patients were recruited (TNF-α inhibitors: 584; non-TNF-α inhibitors: 535; tofacitinib: 151). The independent protective factors for 3-year drug survival were positive rheumatoid factor (RF) (HR: 0.48, 95% CI: 0.27–0.85, p = 0.013) and biologics-naïve RA (HR: 0.61, 95% CI: 0.39–0.94, p = 0.024). In contrast, positive anti-citrullinated protein antibody (ACPA) (HR: 2.24, 95% CI: 1.32–3.79, p = 0.003) and pre-existing latent tuberculosis (HR: 2.90, 95% CI: 2.06–4.09, p&lt;0.001) were associated with drug discontinuation. RA patients treated with TNF-α inhibitors exhibited better drug retention, especially in the biologics-naïve subgroup ( p = 0.037). TNF-α inhibitors were associated with lower cumulative incidence of discontinuation due to inefficacy and adverse events (both p &lt;0.001). Baseline RF and ACPA positivity in abatacept-treated patients were associated with a better 3-year drug survival. However, negative ACPA levels predicted superior drug survival of TNF-α inhibitors and tofacitinib. In conclusion, bio-naïve status predicted better drug survival in TNF-α inhibitors-treated RA patients. RF and ACPA positivity predicted better abatacept drug survival. In contrast, ACPA negativity was associated with superior TNF-α inhibitors and tofacitinib survival."
https://openalex.org/W3158620103,"We aimed to describe the epidemiology of catheter-related bloodstream infections (CRBSIs) in onco-hematological neutropenic patients during a 25-year study period, to evaluate the risk factors for Gram-negative bacilli (GNB) CRBSI, as well as rates of inappropriate empirical antibiotic treatments (IEAT) and mortality.All consecutive episodes of CRBSIs were prospectively collected (1994-2018). Changing epidemiology was evaluated comparing five-year time spans. A multivariate regression model was built to evaluate risk factors for GNB CRBSIs.482 monomicrobial CRBSIs were documented. The proportion of CRBSIs among all BSIs decreased over time from 41.2% to 15.8% (p<0.001). CRBSIs epidemiology has been changing: the rate of GNB increased over time (from 11.9% to 29.4%; p<0.001), as well as the absolute number and rate of multidrug-resistant (MDR) GNB (from 9.5% to 40.0%; p = 0.039). P. aeruginosa increased and comprised up to 40% of all GNB. Independent factors related with GNB-CRBSIs were: longer duration of in-situ catheter (OR 1.007; 95%CI 1.004-1.011), older age (OR 1.016; 95%CI 1.001-1.033), prior antibiotic treatment with penicillins (OR 2.716; 95%CI 1.306-5.403), and current antibiotic treatment with glycopeptides (OR 1.931; 95%CI 1.001-3.306). IEATs were administered to 30.7% of patients, with the highest percentage among MDR P. aeruginosa (76.9%) and S. maltophillia (92.9%). Mortality rate was greater among GNB than GPC-CRBSI (14.4% vs 5.4%; p = 0.002), with mortality increasing over time (from 4.5% to 11.2%; p = 0.003).A significant shift towards GNB-CRBSIs was observed. Secondarily, and coinciding with an increasing number of GNB-MDR infections, mortality increased over time."
https://openalex.org/W3158841214,"This paper aimed to explore various factors associated with the use of sanitary napkins among adolescent girls in Uttar Pradesh and Bihar.The study uses information from the Understanding the Lives of Adolescents and Young Adults (UDAYA) project survey conducted in Uttar Pradesh and Bihar in 2016. The study sample consisted of 14,625 adolescent girls aged 10-19 years. The study sample was selected using a multi-stage systematic sampling design. Multilevel logistic regression (MLR) was used to identify the individual and community level factors associated with the use of sanitary napkins.The results revealed a wide variation in sanitary napkins' use across the socio-economic and demographic factors. The use of sanitary napkins was significantly higher among girls with 8-9 (53.2%) and 10 and more (75.4%) years of schooling compared to those who had no formal education (26.4%). The use of sanitary napkins was higher among adolescent girls who were not engaged in paid work (54.7%) than those who did any paid job (40.8%). Adolescent girls reporting frequent exposure to mass media (OR = 2.10), belonging to the richest wealth quintile (OR = 3.76), and whose mothers had 10 or more years of education (OR = 2.29) had a higher propensity to use sanitary napkins than their counterparts. We did not find a significant role of community-level education of mothers on the menstrual hygiene practices of adolescents.Ensuring that adolescent girls have access to hygienic means to manage their menses is critical from a public health perspective and in enabling them to realize their full potential. Programs to enhance menstrual hygiene are warranted. These programs should involve mothers, who are an important source of knowledge about menstrual hygiene. Facilitating girls' access to education may also produce tangible menstrual hygiene benefits."
https://openalex.org/W3157220217,"Decision-makers need signals for action as the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic progresses. Our aim was to demonstrate a novel use of statistical process control to provide timely and interpretable displays of COVID-19 data that inform local mitigation and containment strategies. Healthcare and other industries use statistical process control to study variation and disaggregate data for purposes of understanding behavior of processes and systems and intervening on them. We developed control charts at the county and city/neighborhood level within one state (California) to illustrate their potential value for decision-makers. We found that COVID-19 rates vary by region and subregion, with periods of exponential and non-exponential growth and decline. Such disaggregation provides granularity that decision-makers can use to respond to the pandemic. The annotated time series presentation connects events and policies with observed data that may help mobilize and direct the actions of residents and other stakeholders. Policy-makers and communities require access to relevant, accurate data to respond to the evolving COVID-19 pandemic. Control charts could prove valuable given their potential ease of use and interpretability in real-time decision-making and for communication about the pandemic at a meaningful level for communities."
https://openalex.org/W3159294383,"Deeply investigating the relationship between foreign direct investment (FDI), fiscal expenditure and green total-factor productivity (GTFP) is beneficial to formulating effective policies to promote the high-quality development in China. Based on theoretical mechanism analysis, with panel data of China's mainland 30 provinces during 2003-2017, this paper utilizes spatial econometric model to empirically explore the effects of FDI, fiscal expenditure and their interaction item on the growth of GTFP in China. The results show that FDI significantly promote the growth of the local and its neighboring GTFP, and both fiscal expenditure and the interaction between FDI and fiscal expenditure exert significantly negative effects on the growth of GTFP in the local and its neighboring regions. A series of robustness checks and the endogeneity test can ensure the reliability of these results. In addition, great heterogeneity can be found across China's different regions in the relationship between FDI, fiscal expenditure and GTFP. The conclusions suggest that it is necessary to give fully play to the synergy between FDI and fiscal expenditure and formulate regionally targeted policies to improve GTFP and promote high-quality development in China."
https://openalex.org/W3157746121,"Plant species are not only used as fodder or forage but also contribute substantially in the treatment of various health disorders, particularly in livestock. This study is the first quantitative ethnobotanical effort on ethnoveterinary uses of medicinal plants conducted in the Upper Neelum Valley of Azad Jammu &amp; Kashmir, Pakistan. Information pertaining to cure different ailments of animals were collected from 126 informants through semi-structured interviews, group discussion and field walks. In order to identify the plant species used and their preferred habitats, elderly and experienced members of the tribes, locally known ’Budhair’ (aged), were interviewed and sometimes accompanied in the field. The data was further analyzed through ethnobotanical indices. In all, 39 plant species, belonging to 31 genera and 21 families were documented which were used by the indigenous communities of Kashmir Himalaya for curing 21 different diseases of 7 different types of livestock. The highest number of ethno-medicinal plants were contributed by the Polygonaceae family, followed by Crassulaceae, Asteraceae and other families. Roots were the most used part of the plant for preparing ethnoveterinary medicines, followed by the aerial parts. The highest frequency of citation (41) and relative frequency of citation (7.32) was recorded for Saussurea lappa , followed by Rumex acetosa (37/6.61), Rumex nepalensis (36/6.43), Thymus linearis (28/5.0) and Angelica cyclocarpa (28/5.0). The highest use value was recorded for Saussurea lappa (0.33), followed by Rumex acetosa (0.29), Rumex nepalensis (0.29), Thymus linearis and Angelica cyclocarpa (0.22 each). The current study has made an important contribution towards the preservation of indigenous plants-based knowledge from extinction. The phytochemical and pharmacological investigations of the plants with high use value can be a potential source of novel drugs to treat health problems of animals and humans."

Integration of real-time tracking technology with a laser pico-projector allows the surgical surface to be augmented by projecting virtual images of lesions and critical structures created by multimodality imaging. We aim to quantitatively and qualitatively evaluate the performance of a prototype interactive AR surgical navigation system through a series of pre-clinical studies. Four pre-clinical animal studies using xenograft mouse models were conducted to investigate system performance. A combination of CT, PET, SPECT, and MRI images were used to augment the mouse body during image-guided procedures to assess feasibility. A phantom with machined features was employed to quantitatively estimate the system accuracy. All the image-guided procedures were successfully performed. The tracked pico-projector correctly and reliably depicted virtual images on the animal body, highlighting the location of tumour and anatomical structures. The phantom study demonstrates the system was accurate to 0.55 ± 0.33mm. This paper presents a prototype real-time tracking AR surgical navigation system that improves visualization of underlying critical structures by overlaying virtual images onto the surgical site. This proof-of-concept pre-clinical study demonstrated both the clinical applicability and high precision of the system which was noted to be accurate to &lt;1mm."
https://openalex.org/W3158792289,"Dairy farm systems have intensified to meet growing demands for animal products, but public opposition to this intensification has also grown due, in part, to concerns about animal welfare. One approach to addressing challenges in agricultural systems has been through the addition of new technologies, including genetic modification. Previous studies have reported some public resistance towards the use of these technologies in agriculture, but this research has assessed public attitudes toward individual practices and technologies and few studies have examined a range of practices on dairy farms. In the present study, we presented participants with four scenarios describing dairy practices (cow-calf separation, the fate of excess dairy calves, pasture access and disbudding). Citizens from Canada and the United States (n = 650) indicated their support (on a 7-point scale) toward five approaches (maintaining standard farm practice, using a naturalistic approach, using a technological approach, or switching to plant-based or yeast-based milk production) aimed at addressing the welfare issues associated with the four dairy practices. Respondents also provided a text-based rationale for their responses and answered a series of demographic questions including age, gender, and diet. Participant diet affected attitudes toward milk alternatives, with vegetarians and vegans showing more support for the plant-based and yeast-based milk production. Regardless of diet, most participants opposed genetic modification technologies and supported more naturalistic practices. Qualitative responses provided insight into participants' values and concerns, and illustrated a variety of perceived benefits and concerns related to the options presented. Common themes included animal welfare, ethics of animal use, and opposition toward technology. We conclude that Canadian and US citizens consider multiple aspects of farm systems when contemplating animal welfare concerns, and tend to favor naturalistic approaches over technological solutions, especially when the latter are based on genetic modification."
https://openalex.org/W3159381503,"Increasing methionine availability in dairy cow diets during the first third of lactation may enhance their performance and health. The aim of this study was to determine the effect of supplementing rumen-protected methionine (Smartamine® M, SM) in a lactation diet with protein and energy levels calculated according to the literature. Seventy-six multiparous Holstein cows (39.1 ± 6.8 kg of milk/d and 65 ± 28 DIM) were assigned to 1 of 2 dietary treatments (38/treatment) according to a randomized complete block design with a 2-wk (covariate) and 10-wk experimental period. Treatments were a basal diet (CON; 3.77 Lys:1Met); and CON + 23 g SM (2.97 Lys:1 Met). Individual milk samples were taken every 2 weeks to determine milk composition. Blood was collected from 24 cows on d+30 d to measure plasma AA levels. Body weight and body condition score (BCS) were measured at the beginning and the end of the experiment. The SM diet promoted higher milk yield (41.7 vs. 40.1 kg/d; P = 0.03). Energy-corrected milk yield (41.0 vs. 38.0 kg/d), milk protein yield (1.30 vs. 1.18 kg/d), milk protein (3.14% vs. 2.97%) and casein (2.39% vs. 2.28%) were also different ( P &lt; 0.01) as well as milk fat yield (1.42 vs. 1.29 kg/d; P = 0.02). A trend ( P = 0.06) for higher milk fat % (3.41% vs. 3.21%) was observed. Both diets resulted in similar body weight, but CON-fed cows tended ( P = 0.08) to have higher BCS. Higher plasma methionine levels were determined with SM compared with CON (29.6 vs. 18.4 μM; P &lt; 0.01), but lysine and histidine were not different. Dietary supplementation of RPM improved productive performance by increasing milk yield and milk components yields, suggesting better dietary AA utilization when Met levels are adjusted in Lys-adequate lactation diets."
https://openalex.org/W3157524313,"Research-based teaching practices can improve student learning outcomes in a variety of complex educational environments. The implementation of learner-centered teaching practices in STEM can both benefit from or be constrained by different factors related to individual instructors and the teaching environment. Additionally, we know little of how the instructional climate varies across institutions and how this climate affects teaching practices. Our study sought to examine the relative importance of environmental influences and individual characteristics on learner-centered teaching practices across institutions. We also assessed differences in our study population and departmental climate for 35 US higher education institutions across the country. We found that self-efficacy in teaching and professional development exert a strong influence on faculty teaching practices in biology. While departmental climate did not emerge as a significant predictor of teaching practices, there was consistently low support for teaching, and institution size was negatively correlated with leadership and evaluation of effective teaching. We also found that intensive professional development programs, such as the Faculty Institutes for Reforming Science Teaching IV program, may prepare instructors to teach learner-centered courses in different collegial teaching climates. Our results suggest that through cultivating self-efficacy and participating in iterative professional development, instructors can implement effective teaching practices in a variety of institutional environments."

By causing dysphagia, regurgitation, aspiration and chest pain, achalasia might tremendously affect life quality of patients. However, the impact of achalasia on the development of mood disorders including depression has largely remained unclear. The aim of this study was to evaluate the incidence of depression in achalasia patients. Methods We analyzed a large primary care cohort database in Germany capturing data from 7.49 million patients. Results A total of n = 1,057 patients with achalasia diagnosed between January 2005 and December 2018 were matched to a cohort of n = 3,171 patients without achalasia controlling for age, sex, physician, index year, and the Charlson comorbidity index. Interestingly, while the frequency of depression prior to the diagnosis of achalasia was comparable in both groups, new diagnoses of depression were significantly higher within one year after the diagnosis of achalasia compared to the control group, suggesting a direct and previously unrecognized association between achalasia and depression. Conclusion Our data suggest that the clinical management of patients with achalasia should include a careful and structured work-up for mood disorders in order to improve long-term quality of life in these patients."
https://openalex.org/W3157574288,"Voluntary contributions by citizen scientists can gather large datasets covering wide geographical areas, and are increasingly utilized by researchers for multiple applications, including arthropod vector surveillance. Online platforms such as iNaturalist accumulate crowdsourced biological observations from around the world and these data could also be useful for monitoring vectors. The aim of this study was to explore the availability of observations of important vector taxa on the iNaturalist platform and examine the utility of these data to complement existing vector surveillance activities. Of ten vector taxa investigated, records were most numerous for mosquitoes (Culicidae; 23,018 records, 222 species) and ticks (Ixodida; 16,214 records, 87 species), with most data from 2019–2020. Case studies were performed to assess whether images associated with records were of sufficient quality to identify species and compare iNaturalist observations of vector species to the known situation at the state, national and regional level based on existing published data. Firstly, tick data collected at the national (United Kingdom) or state (Minnesota, USA) level were sufficient to determine seasonal occurrence and distribution patterns of important tick species, and were able to corroborate and complement known trends in tick distribution. Importantly, tick species with expanding distributions ( Haemaphysalis punctata in the UK, and Amblyomma americanum in Minnesota) were also detected. Secondly, using iNaturalist data to monitor expanding tick species in Europe ( Hyalomma spp.) and the USA ( Haemaphysalis longicornis ), and invasive Aedes mosquitoes in Europe, showed potential for tracking these species within their known range as well as identifying possible areas of expansion. Despite known limitations associated with crowdsourced data, this study shows that iNaturalist can be a valuable source of information on vector distribution and seasonality that could be used to supplement existing vector surveillance data, especially at a time when many surveillance programs may have been interrupted by COVID-19 restrictions."
https://openalex.org/W3158945522,"Active predators obtain energy and nutrients from prey through complex processes in which the energy gained must exceed the energy invested in finding and ingesting the prey. In addition, the amount of energy available will vary with the prey that are selected for consumption. The muricid gastropod Acanthina monodon inhabits rocky shores, where it routinely feeds on the mytilids Semimytilus algosus and Perumytilus purpuratus. In this study, S. algosus was highly preferred by the predator (over 90% were eaten) versus P. purpuratus (only 9% were eaten) when offered a mixed diet. The energetic cost of attacking one S. algosus individual was 91 J bivalve-1 while for P. purpuratus it was slightly higher: 95 J bivalve-1. Also, whereas A. monodon required on average 19 h to consume S. algosus, successful attacks on P. purpuratus required about 32% more time (25 h). In addition, a longer resting time was needed by the predator after preying on P. purpuratus before it initiated another attack. Moreover, the active metabolic costs associated with successfully attacking the prey increased 3.2 times over the basal metabolic costs when attacking S. algosus, but only by 2.5 times when attacking P. purpuratus. The calculations associated with preying on each species showed that the energetic gain per unit time likely accounts for the predator's preference for attacking S. algosus, even though predation on both species provided net energy gains for the predator. However, as S. algosus occurs seasonally at our study site, P. purpuratus would probably also be consumed due to its constant availability throughout the whole year."
https://openalex.org/W3159363911,"Acute gastrointestinal infection (AGI) represents a significant public health concern. To control and treat AGI, it is critical to quickly and accurately identify its causes. The use of novel multiplex molecular assays for pathogen detection and identification provides a unique opportunity to improve pathogen detection, and better understand risk factors and burden associated with AGI in the community. In this study, de-identified results from BioFire® FilmArray® Gastrointestinal (GI) Panel were obtained from January 01, 2016 to October 31, 2018 through BioFire® Syndromic Trends (Trend), a cloud database. Data was analyzed to describe the occurrence of pathogens causing AGI across United States sites and the relative rankings of pathogens monitored by FoodNet, a CDC surveillance system were compared. During the period of the study, the number of tests performed increased 10-fold and overall, 42.6% were positive for one or more pathogens. Seventy percent of the detections were bacteria, 25% viruses, and 4% parasites. Clostridium difficile, enteropathogenic Escherichia coli (EPEC) and norovirus were the most frequently detected pathogens. Seasonality was observed for several pathogens including astrovirus, rotavirus, and norovirus, EPEC, and Campylobacter. The co-detection rate was 10.2%. Enterotoxigenic E. coli (ETEC), Plesiomonas shigelloides, enteroaggregative E. coli (EAEC), and Entamoeba histolytica were detected with another pathogen over 60% of the time, while less than 30% of C. difficile and Cyclospora cayetanensis were detected with another pathogen. Positive correlations among co-detections were found between Shigella/Enteroinvasive E. coli with E. histolytica, and ETEC with EAEC. Overall, the relative ranking of detections for the eight GI pathogens monitored by FoodNet and BioFire Trend were similar for five of them. AGI data from BioFire Trend is available in near real-time and represents a rich data source for the study of disease burden and GI pathogen circulation in the community, especially for those pathogens not often targeted by surveillance."

To ensure a complete and reliable last-mile delivery, a drone must authenticate the consumer before dropping the package. Therefore, in this work, we propose a consumer authentication (Consumer-Auth) hybrid computing framework for drone delivery as a service to make sure that the parcel is perfectly delivered to the intended customer. The proposed Consumer-Auth framework enables a drone to reach the exact destination by using the GPS coordinates of the customer autonomously. After reaching the exact location, the drone waits for the customer to come to the specific pinned location then it starts a two-factor consumer authentication process, i.e., one-time password (OTP) verification and face Recognition. The experimental results manifest the effectiveness of the proposed Consumer-Auth framework to ensure a complete and reliable drone-based last-mile delivery."

In this study, PTZ loaded Ethyl cellulose microsphere has been formulated for sustained release and improved bioavailability of PTZ. These microspheres were fabricated by oil in water emulsion solvent evaporation technique. A three factorial, three levels Box-Behnken design was applied to investigate the influence of different formulation components and process variables on the formulation response using the numeric approach through the design expert® software. All the formulations were characterized for the morphology, different physicochemical properties and the results were supported with the ANOVA analysis, three dimensional contour graphs and regression equations. The maximum percentage yield was 98.67% with 98% entrapment of PTZ. The mean particle size of the formulations ranges from 50-148μm, which directly relates to the concentration of polymer and inversely proportional to the stirring speed. SEM revealed the spherical shape of PTZ microspheres with porous structures. These are physically, chemically and thermally stable as confirmed through Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD) and thermal gravimetric (TG) analysis respectively. The microspheres provided a sustained release of the PTZ for more than 12 hours, following zero order with fickian and non fickian diffusion. The results indicate that prepared microspheres can be a potential drug delivery system (DDS) for the delivery of PTZ in the management of pains."
https://openalex.org/W3157611538,"Oscillatory neural activity is dynamically controlled to coordinate perceptual, attentional and cognitive processes. On the macroscopic scale, this control is reflected in the U-shaped deviations of EEG spectral-power dynamics from stochastic dynamics, characterized by disproportionately elevated occurrences of the lowest and highest ranges of power. To understand the mechanisms that generate these low- and high-power states, we fit a simple mathematical model of synchronization of oscillatory activity to human EEG data. The results consistently indicated that the majority (~95%) of synchronization dynamics is controlled by slowly adjusting the probability of synchronization while maintaining maximum entropy within the timescale of a few seconds. This strategy appears to be universal as the results generalized across oscillation frequencies, EEG current sources, and participants ( N = 52) whether they rested with their eyes closed, rested with their eyes open in a darkened room, or viewed a silent nature video. Given that precisely coordinated behavior requires tightly controlled oscillatory dynamics, the current results suggest that the large-scale spatial synchronization of oscillatory activity is controlled by the relatively slow, entropy-maximizing adjustments of synchronization probability (demonstrated here) in combination with temporally precise phase adjustments (e.g., phase resetting generated by sensorimotor interactions). Interestingly, we observed a modest but consistent spatial pattern of deviations from the maximum-entropy rule, potentially suggesting that the mid-central-posterior region serves as an “entropy dump” to facilitate the temporally precise control of spectral-power dynamics in the surrounding regions."
https://openalex.org/W3157783952,"Background While lactation is a physiological process requiring high energy demand to fulfill the nutrient requirements of the mother and the breastfeeding child, many factors affecting maternal nutrient intake can lead to nutritional deficits. Previous studies in Ethiopia have reported the prevalence of maternal and child undernutrition and related complications. However, qualitative studies exploring potential barriers to utilizing available nutrition interventions are limited. This study, therefore, sought to qualitatively explore barriers hindering the uptake of nutrition services among lactating mothers from rural communities in Tigray, northern Ethiopia. Methods We conducted 6 in-depth interviews, 70 key informant interviews, and 13 focus group discussions among purposively selected community groups, experts, and lactating mothers between November- 2017 and January- 2018. Audio records of all interviews and focus group discussions were transcribed verbatim (word-to-word) and translated into English. Then, translated data were analyzed thematically using qualitative data analysis software Atlas ti-version 7.4. Results The participants in this study perceived that lactating mothers in their study area are not properly utilizing available and recommended nutrition interventions, and as a result, their nutrient intake was reported as inadequate. Participants identified inadequate accessibility and availability of foods, feeding practices, cultural and religious influences, focus on agricultural production and productivity, barriers related to health services and poor access to water, sanitation and hygiene as major barriers hindering the uptake of nutrition interventions by lactating women in Tigray, northern Ethiopia. Conclusion The uptake of nutrition intervention services was low among lactating mothers and was hindered by multiple socio-cultural and health service related factors requiring problem-specific interventions at community, health facility, and administrative levels to improve the nutritional status of lactating mothers in the study area."

Host proteins may give us insight into the mechanisms of stroke in TBM and serve as biomarkers for detection of stroke, however, they have not been widely explored. In this study, we compared the concentrations of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and serum proteins between children who had TBM-related stroke and children with TBM without stroke.We collected CSF and serum from 47 children consecutively admitted to the Tygerberg Academic Hospital in Cape Town, South Africa between November 2016, and November 2017, on suspicion of having TBM. A multiplex platform was used to measure the concentrations of 69 host proteins in CSF and serum from all study participants.After classification of study participants, 23 (48.9%) out of the 47 study participants were diagnosed with TBM, of which 14 (60.9%) demonstrated radiological arterial ischemic infarction. The levels of lipocalin-2, sRAGE, IP-10/ CXCL10, sVCAM-1, MMP-1, and PDGF-AA in CSF samples and the levels of D-dimer, ADAMTS13, SAA, ferritin, MCP-1/ CCL2, GDF-15 and IL-13 in serum samples were statistically different between children who had TBM-related stroke and children with TBM without stroke. After correcting for multiple testing, only the levels of sVCAM-1, MMP-1, sRAGE, and IP-10/ CXCL10 in CSF were statistically different between the two groups. CSF and serum protein biosignatures indicated stroke in children diagnosed with TBM with up to 100% sensitivity and 88.9% specificity.Serum and CSF proteins may serve as biomarkers for identifying individuals with stroke amongst children diagnosed with TBM at admission and may guide us to understand the biology of stroke in TBM. This was a pilot study, and thus further investigations in larger studies are needed."

In this study, different concentrations of crude, hexane, chloroform, butanol, and aqueous extracts of Euphorbia nivulia Buch.-Ham., an endemic plant of the Cholistan desert in South Punjab of Pakistan, were analysed for their chemical constituents. Their various concentrations were also tested for their phytotoxic and insecticidal potential against duckweed, Lemna minor L., and the dusky cotton bug, Oxycarenus hyalinipennis Costa. various polyphenols, i.e., quercetin, gallic acid, caffeic acid, syringic acid, coumaric acid, ferulic acid, and cinnamic acid were detected in different concentrations with different solvents during the phytochemical screening of E . nivulia . In the phytotoxicity test, except for 100 μg/mL of the butanol extract gave 4.5% growth regulation, no phytotoxic lethality could be found at 10 and 100 μg/mL of all the extracts. The highest concentration, 1000 μg/mL, of the chloroform, crude, and butanol extracts showed 100, 63.1, and 27.1% of growth inhibition in duckweed, respectively. In the insecticidal bioassay, the highest O . hyalinipennis mortalities (87 and 75%) were recorded at 15% concentration of the chloroform and butanol extracts of E . nivulia . In contrast, the lower concentrations of the E . nivulia extracts caused the lower mortalities. Altogether, these findings revealed that E . nivulia chloroform extracts showed significant phytotoxicity while all the extracts showed insecticidal potential. This potential can be, further, refined to be developed for bio-control agents."
https://openalex.org/W3158579762,"Background Aging is accompanied by a drop in the level of health and autonomy, within Western countries more and more people being cared for in nursing homes (NH). The nutritional data in NH in France remain poor, not exhaustive and not representative. The objective of the study was to assess the nutritional status, dementia and mobility patterns among residents of NH in the Limousin territory of France. Methods The study was cross-sectional, descriptive and exhaustive, conducted with the residents of 13 voluntary NH. Undernutrition was identified using French High Authority for Health criteria, and obesity if Body Mass Index &gt;30, in the absence undernutrition criterion. The Mini Mental State examination scores was used for dementia assessment at the threshold of 24. The Mini Nutritional Assessment TM was used for mobilitity assessment. The statistics were significant at the 5% threshold. Results 866 residents (70.6% women) included with an average age of 85.3 ± 9.3 years. Undernutrition was 27.5%, obesity 22.9%, dementia 45.7% and very low mobility 68.9%. Women were older than men, more often undernourished, more often demented and more often had very low mobility (p&lt;0.01). Undernutrition (p&lt;0.0001) and low mobility (p&lt;0.0001) were significantly higher among those with dementia versus those without dementia. Very low mobility was higher among undernourished (p&lt;0.05). Conclusions Undernutrition and obesity are important problems in NH in France. Being a woman, having dementia and having a very low mobility may induce undernutrition."
https://openalex.org/W3157225558,"Acesta excavata (Fabricius, 1779) is a slow growing bivalve from the Limidae family and is often found associated with cold-water coral reefs along the European continental margin. Here we present the compositional variability of frequently used proxy elemental ratios (Mg/Ca, Sr/Ca, Na/Ca) measured by laser-ablation mass spectrometry (LA-ICP-MS) and compare it to in-situ recorded instrumental seawater parameters such as temperature and salinity. Shell Mg/Ca measured in the fibrous calcitic shell section was overall not correlated with seawater temperature or salinity; however, some samples show significant correlations with temperature with a sensitivity that was found to be unusually high in comparison to other marine organisms. Mg/Ca and Sr/Ca measured in the fibrous calcitic shell section display significant negative correlations with the linear extension rate of the shell, which indicates strong vital effects in these bivalves. Multiple linear regression analysis indicates that up to 79% of elemental variability is explicable with temperature and salinity as independent predictor values. Yet, the overall results clearly show that the application of Element/Ca (E/Ca) ratios in these bivalves to reconstruct past changes in temperature and salinity is likely to be complicated due to strong vital effects and the effects of organic material embedded in the shell. Therefore, we suggest to apply additional techniques, such as clumped isotopes, in order to exactly determine and quantify the underlying vital effects and possibly account for these. We found differences in the chemical composition between the two calcitic shell layers that are possibly explainable through differences of the crystal morphology. Sr/Ca ratios also appear to be partly controlled by the amount of magnesium, because the small magnesium ions bend the crystal lattice which increases the space for strontium incorporation. Oxidative cleaning with H 2 O 2 did not significantly change the Mg/Ca and Sr/Ca composition of the shell. Na/Ca ratios decreased after the oxidative cleaning, which is most likely a leaching effect and not caused by the removal of organic matter."
https://openalex.org/W3157274237,"This retrospective correlation study investigated the putative link between methylene tetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) A1298C mutations and chemotherapy-related brain function changes in adult childhood-leukemia survivors. To this end, we determined the relationship between the particular MTHFR1298 genotype (AA, AC or CC) of 31 adult childhood-leukemia survivors, and (1) their CSF Tau and phosphorylated Tau (pTau) levels at the time of treatment, (2) their adult performance intelligence quotient (PIQ), and (3) their regional brain connectivity using diffusion magnetic resonance imaging (dMRI) and resting-state functional MRI (rsfMRI). We confirmed that neuropathology markers Tau and pTau significantly increased in CSF of children after intrathecal methotrexate administration. Highest concentrations of these toxicity markers were found during the induction phase of the therapy. Moreover, CSF concentrations of Tau and pTau during treatment were influenced by the children’s particular MTHFR1298 genotype. CSF Tau (but not pTau) levels significantly dropped after folinic acid supplementation. At adult age (on average 13.1 years since the end of their treatment), their particular MTHFR1298 genotype (AA, AC or CC) influenced the changes in PIQ and cortical connectivity that we found to be related to their childhood exposure to chemotherapeutics. In summary, we suggest that homozygous MTHFR1298CC individuals are more vulnerable to the adult sequelae of antifolate chemotherapy."

As there is no clear-cut treatment recommendation, accurate information on current therapeutic strategies in real-life practice is needed. KT recipients from the multicenter Swiss Transplant Cohort Study treated for acute AMR during the first post-transplant year were included retrospectively. We aimed at describing the anti-rejection protocols used routinely, as well as patient and graft outcomes, with focus on infectious complications. Overall, 65/1669 (3.9%) KT recipients were treated for 75 episodes of acute AMR. In addition to corticosteroid boluses, most common therapies included plasmapheresis (56.0%), intravenous immunoglobulins (IVIg) (38.7%), rituximab (25.3%), and antithymocyte globulin (22.7%). At least one infectious complication occurred within 6 months from AMR treatment in 63.6% of patients. Plasmapheresis increased the risk of overall (hazard ratio [HR]: 2.89; P-value = 0.002) and opportunistic infection (HR: 5.32; P-value = 0.033). IVIg exerted a protective effect for bacterial infection (HR: 0.29; P-value = 0.053). The recovery of renal function was complete at 3 months after AMR treatment in 67% of episodes. One-year death-censored graft survival was 90.9%. Four patients (6.2%) died during the first year (two due to severe infection). In this nationwide cohort we found significant heterogeneity in therapeutic approaches for acute AMR. Infectious complications were common, particularly among KT recipients receiving plasmapheresis."
https://openalex.org/W3157526443,"We investigated the role of endothelial glycocalyx and its component syndecan-1 protein in the pathophysiology of sepsis-induced vascular hyper-permeability and examined the therapeutic effects of high-molecular-weight sodium hyaluronate (HMW-SH). Methods Sepsis was induced by cotton smoke inhalation followed by intranasal administration of Pseudomonas aeruginosa in female (&gt; 6 months) Balb/c and syndecan-1 knockout mice. Survival of mice, lung capillary endothelial glycocalyx integrity, lung water content, and vascular hyper-permeability were determined with or without HMW-SH treatment in these mice. Effects of HMW-SH on endothelial permeability and neutrophil migration were tested in in vitro setting. Results In septic wildtype mice, we found a severely damaged pulmonary microvascular endothelial glycocalyx and elevated levels of shed syndecan-1 in the circulation. These changes were associated with significantly increased pulmonary vascular permeability. In septic syndecan-1 knockout mice, extravascular lung water content was higher, and early death was observed. The administration of HMW-SH significantly reduced mortality and lung water content in septic syndecan-1 knockout mice, but not in septic wildtype mice. In in vitro setting, HMW-SH inhibited neutrophil migration and reduced cultured endothelial cell permeability increases. However, these effects were reversed by the addition of recombinant syndecan-1 ectodomain. Conclusions HMW-SH reduced lung tissue damage and mortality in the absence of syndecan-1 protein, possibly by reducing vascular hyper-permeability and neutrophil migration. Our results further suggest that increased shed syndecan-1 protein levels are linked with the inefficiency of HMW-SH in septic wildtype mice."

With the increasing effects of climate change and the annual retreat of the ice shelf, the importance of macroalgae and their diatom epiphytes in primary production also increases. The relationships and interactions between these organisms have scarcely been studied in Antarctica, and even less in the volcanic ecosystem of Deception Island, which can be seen as a natural proxy of climate change in Antarctica because of its vulcanism, and the open marine system of Livingston Island. In this study we investigated the composition of the diatom communities in the context of their macroalgal hosts and different environmental factors. We used a non-acidic method for diatom digestion, followed by slidescanning and diatom identification by manual annotation through a web-browser-based image annotation platform. Epiphytic diatom species richness was higher on Deception Island as a whole, whereas individual macroalgal specimens harboured richer diatom assemblages on Livingston Island. We hypothesize this a possible result of a higher diversity of ecological niches in the unique volcanic environment of Deception Island. Overall, our study revealed higher species richness and diversity than previous studies of macroalgae-inhabiting diatoms in Antarctica, which could however be the result of the different preparation methodologies used in the different studies, rather than an indication of a higher species richness on Deception Island and Livingston Island than other Antarctic localities."
https://openalex.org/W3157867882,"Carpobrotus species are harmful invaders to coastal areas throughout the world, particularly in Mediterranean habitats. Demographic models are ideally suited to identify and understand population processes and stages in the life cycle of the species that could be most effectively targeted with management. However, parameterizing these models has been limited by the difficulty in accessing the cliff-side locations where its populations are typically found, as well as accurately measuring the growth and spread of individuals, which form large, dense mats. This study uses small unmanned aerial vehicles (drones) to collect demographic data and parameterize an Integral Projection Model of an Israeli Carpobrotus population. We validated our data set with ground targets of known size. Through the analysis of asymptotic growth rates and population sensitivities and elasticities, we demonstrate that the population at the study site is demographically stable, and that reducing the survival and growth of the largest individuals would have the greatest effect on reducing overall population growth rate. Our results provide a first evaluation of the demography of Carpobrotus, a species of conservation and economic concern, and provide the first structured population model of a representative of the Aizoaceae family, thus contributing to our global knowledge on plant population dynamics. In addition, we demonstrate the advantages of using drones for collecting demographic data in understudied habitats such as coastal ecosystems."

This study examined the variation in body size, functional capacities, motivation for achievement, competitiveness, and deliberate practice of youth volleyball players associated with differences in biological maturity status, chronological age, and accumulated deliberate volleyball practice, adopting a Bayesian multilevel modeling approach. We considered 68 female and 94 male adolescent players (14.2 years, 90% confidence interval: 12.7 to 16.0). Players were grouped by the onset of deliberate volleyball practice as related to biologic maturation milestones [pre-puberty deliberate practice onset (12% of the sample), mid-puberty deliberate practice onset (51% of the sample), and late-puberty deliberate practice onset (37% of the sample). There was substantial variation in body dimensions and functional performance by gender. There was no variation by gender for motivation for deliberate practice and motivation for achievement and competitiveness. The young volleyball players appeared to be highly motivated and committed to deliberate practice, achievement, and competitiveness. Alignment of chronological age, biological maturation, and accumulated training experience allow more in-depth insights into young volleyball players' development, providing sounder support for coaches´ decisions."
https://openalex.org/W3158343734,"As oil production in the Permian Basin surges, the impact of shale production on groundwater resources has become a growing concern. Most existing studies focus on the impact of shale production on shallow freshwater aquifers. There is little understanding of the shale development's impact on other groundwater resources (e.g., deep carbonate aquifers and deep basin meteoric aquifers). The possible natural hydraulic connections between shallow aquifers and formation water suggest such an impact can be consequential. This study explores the relationship between shale production and groundwater using produced water (PW) samples from active unconventional oil wells. Focusing on the most productive portion of the Permian Basin-the four-county region in Southeast New Mexico between 2007 and 2016, a large produced water dataset allows us to analyze the conditional correlations between shale oil production and PW constituents. The results suggest that (1) expanding from primarily conventional wells to unconventional wells during the recent shale boom has led to dramatic increases of the TDS, chloride, sodium, and calcium levels in groundwater (i.e., producing formation). (2) Nearby oil well density positively correlates with the TDS, chloride, and sodium levels in the PW samples."

Methods The National Cancer Database (NCDB) public user file (2004–2014) was used to select patients with PC undergoing CRS and HIPEC from appendiceal cancer. Univariate and multivariable analyses were performed. Results 1,190 patients with PC from appendiceal cancer underwent HIPEC and CRS. OS was significantly longer for women than for men, with mean and median OS being 73.8 months and 98.2 months for women vs 58.7 months and 82.5 months for men, respectively (p = 0.0032). On multivariable analysis, male sex (HR: 1.444, 95% CI: 1.141–1.827, p = 0.0022) and increasing age (HR: 1.017, 95% CI: 1.006–1.027, p = 0.0017) were both found to be independent risk factors for worse OS.

https://openalex.org/W3158821631,"Background To analyze the functional and anatomical outcome after vitrectomy with subretinal rtPA (recombinant tissue plasminogen activator) combined with or without an intravitreal Bevacizumab injection. Patients and methods Retrospective, consecutive case series of 31 pseudophakic patients with submacular hemorrhage (SMH) due to neovascular age-related macular degeneration (AMD) treated with vitrectomy, subretinal rtPA and pneumatic air displacement with or without an additional intravitreal Bevacizumab injection. The primary endpoints were best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA), and central macular thickness (CMT) measured by SD‑OCT. The secondary endpoint was a displacement of hemorrhage from the subretinal space three months after surgery. Results 31 eyes of 31 patients were treated with vitrectomy and subretinal rtPA. 17/31 were treated simultaneously with an intravitreal Bevacizumab injection (group +B) and 14/31 without (group -B). The mean visual acuity improved significantly in both groups (from 1.37±0.39 to 1.03±0.57 logMAR in +B and from 1.48±0.48 to 1.01±0.38 logMAR in group –B, p&lt;0.05). The mean CMT decreased in group +B from 607±179 μm to 424±205 μm (p = 0.2) and in group –B from 722±216 μm to 460±202 μm (p&lt;0.05). A central displacement of the hemorrhage could be achieved in 47% in group +B, whereas in group -B displacement could be achieved in 50% (p = 0.44). Conclusions Vitrectomy with subretinal rtPA injection and air tamponade with or without simultaneous intravitreal Bevacizumab injection displaces SMH and improves BCVA effectively. In comparison, the postoperative outcome is comparable regardless of whether or not intravitreal bevacizumab is applied simultaneously."
https://openalex.org/W3159195572,"Although most images in industrial applications have fewer targets and simple image backgrounds, binarization is still a challenging task, and the corresponding results are usually unsatisfactory because of uneven illumination interference. In order to efficiently threshold images with nonuniform illumination, this paper proposes an efficient global binarization algorithm that estimates the inhomogeneous background surface of the original image constructed from the first k leading principal components in the Gaussian scale space (GSS). Then, we use the difference operator to extract the distinct foreground of the original image in which the interference of uneven illumination is effectively eliminated. Finally, the image can be effortlessly binarized by an existing global thresholding algorithm such as the Otsu method. In order to qualitatively and quantitatively verify the segmentation performance of the presented scheme, experiments were performed on a dataset collected from a nonuniform illumination environment. Compared with classical binarization methods, in some metrics, the experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the introduced algorithm in providing promising binarization outcomes and low computational costs."
https://openalex.org/W3159327438,"Kidney transplantation (KT) recipients are at increased risk of low bone density (LBD) and fractures. In this retrospective study, we investigated bone mineral density (BMD), vertebral fractures, calculated risk for major osteoporotic fractures (MOF), and hip fractures in the KT recipients.Patients who completed at least one year after KT were included in the analysis. Demographic, clinical, and laboratory data were recorded. Measurements of BMD were performed by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry. Vertebral fractures were assessed using semi-quantitative criteria with conventional radiography. The ten-year risk for MOF and hip fracture were calculated using the FRAX@ tool with BMD.One hundred fifty-three KT recipients were included in the study. The population included 77 women. The mean age at evaluation was 46,5±11,9 years. Seventy-eight (50.9%) patients had normal femoral neck BMD while osteoporosis and osteopenia at the femoral neck were present in 12 (7.8%) and 63 (41.1%) of the patients, respectively. Age at evaluation was the risk factor for LBD (OR 1.057; 95% CI 1.024-1.091; p = 0.001). In female KT recipients, LBD was principally affected by menopausal status whereas in males, mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) inhibitor use and lower BMI levels were the risk factors. The prevalent vertebral fracture was found in 43.4% of patients. In multivariate analysis, only steroid use (OR 0.121; 95% CI 0.015-0.988; p = 0.049) was found to be associated with prevalent fracture. Among all KT recipients, 1.9% had a high MOF probability (≥20% risk of fracture), and 23.5% had high hip fracture probability (≥3% risk of hip fracture) according to FRAX.Exploring the prevalence of LBD and vertebral fracture and the risk factors would help clinicians to modify long-term follow-up strategies. Furthermore, the high hip fracture risk probability in our cohort suggested that there is a need for longitudinal studies to confirm the validity of the FRAX tool in the transplant population."
https://openalex.org/W3157095598,"The alignment of primary sequences is a fundamental step in the analysis of protein structure, function, and evolution, and in the generation of homology-based models. Integral membrane proteins pose a significant challenge for such sequence alignment approaches, because their evolutionary relationships can be very remote, and because a high content of hydrophobic amino acids reduces their complexity. Frequently, biochemical or biophysical data is available that informs the optimum alignment, for example, indicating specific positions that share common functional or structural roles. Currently, if those positions are not correctly matched by a standard pairwise sequence alignment procedure, the incorporation of such information into the alignment is typically addressed in an ad hoc manner, with manual adjustments. However, such modifications are problematic because they reduce the robustness and reproducibility of the aligned regions either side of the newly matched positions. Previous studies have introduced restraints as a means to impose the matching of positions during sequence alignments, originally in the context of genome assembly. Here we introduce position restraints, or “anchors” as a feature in our alignment tool AlignMe, providing an aid to pairwise global sequence alignment of alpha-helical membrane proteins. Applying this approach to realistic scenarios involving distantly-related and low complexity sequences, we illustrate how the addition of anchors can be used to modify alignments, while still maintaining the reproducibility and rigor of the rest of the alignment. Anchored alignments can be generated using the online version of AlignMe available at www.bioinfo.mpg.de/AlignMe/ ."
https://openalex.org/W3158590692,"In countries of sub-Saharan Africa, many children are admitted to hospital with severe forms of anaemia. The late hospital admissions of anaemic children contribute significantly to child morbidity and mortality in these countries. This qualitative study explores local health beliefs and traditional treatment practices that may hinder timely seeking of hospital care for anaemic children. In January of 2019, nine focus group discussions were conducted with 90 participants in rural communities of Malawi. The participants represented four groups of caregivers; mothers, fathers, grandmothers and grandfathers of children under the age of five. The Malawian medical landscape is comprised of formal and informal therapeutic alternatives–and this myriad of modalities is likely to complicate the healthcare choices of caregivers. When dealing with child illness, many participants reported how they would follow a step-by-step, ‘multi-try’ therapeutic pathway where a combination of biomedical and traditional treatment options were sought at varying time points depending on the perceived cause and severity of symptoms. The participants linked anaemia to naturalistic (malaria, poor nutrition and the local illnesses kakozi and kapamba ), societal (the local illness msempho ) and supernatural or personalistic (witchcraft and Satanism) causes. Most participants agreed that anaemia due to malaria and poor nutrition should be treated at hospital. As for local illnesses, many grandparents suggested herbal treatment offered by traditional healers, while the majority of parents would opt for hospital care. However, participants across all age groups claimed that anaemia caused by witchcraft and Satanism could only be dealt with by traditional healers or prayer, respectively. The multiple theories of anaemia causality combined with extensive use of and trust in traditional and complementary medicine may explain the frequent delay in admittance of anaemic children to hospital."

We have designed a facile method for chlorophyll purification by twice solvent extraction. Twice extraction causes the loss of chlorophylls, but the purity of total chlorophylls can be enhanced 182%. Then, the purified chlorophylls can be converted to relatively pure chlorophyllides facilely. The results show that higher purity of chlorophyllides could be obtained when purified chlorophylls (ethanol-hexane extract) was used as starting materials than that of crude chlorophylls (ethanol-only extract). In biocompatibility test, the results showed that the prepared chlorophyllides can be applied as biomaterials. When the prepared chlorophyllides were applied to anticancer tests, they were active both in MCF7 and MDA-MB-231 (multidrug resistant breast cancer cells) cell lines. In addition, the results suggested that the prepared chlorophyllides could be a potential candidate of combination therapy with doxorubicin to breast cancers."

LexiCAL also comes with a set of well-documented Python scripts for each metric, that can be reproduced and/or modified for other research purposes."
https://openalex.org/W3157149923,"Activated phosphorylation-dephosphorylation biochemical reaction cycles are a class of enzymatic futile cycles. A futile cycle such as a single MAPK cascade governed by two underlying enzymatic reactions permits Hyperbolic (H), Signal transducing (ST), Threshold-hyperbolic (TH) and Ultrasensitive (U) operating regimes that characterize input-output behaviour. Retroactive signalling caused by load due to sequestration of phosphorylated or unphosphorylated form of the substrate in a single enzymatic cascade without explicit feedback can introduce two-way communication, a feature not possible otherwise. We systematically characterize the operating regimes of a futile cycle subject to retroactivity in either of the substrate forms. We demonstrate that increasing retroactivity strength, which quantifies the downstream load, can trigger five possible regime transitions. Retroactivity strength is a reflection of the fraction of the substrate sequestered by its downstream target. Remarkably, the minimum required retroactivity strength to evidence any sequestration triggered regime transition demands 23% of the substrate bound to its downstream target. This minimum retroactivity strength corresponds to the transition of the dose-response curve from ST to H regime. We show that modulation of the saturation and unsaturation levels of the enzymatic reactions by retroactivity is the fundamental mechanism governing operating regime transition."

Material and methods This retrospective study reviewed imaging of adult patients with hip pain who underwent 3D hip MRI and CT. A semi-automatically segmented CT model served as the reference standard, and MRI segmentation was performed manually for each unilateral hip joint. The differences between Dixon-VIBE-3D-MRI vs. CT, and WE-VIBE-3D-MRI vs. CT, were measured. Equivalence tests between Dixon-VIBE and WE-VIBE models were performed with a threshold of 0.1 mm. Bland–Altman plots and Lin’s concordance-correlation coefficient were used to analyze the agreement between WE and Dixon sequences. Subgroup analyses were performed for the femoral head/neck, intertrochanteric, and femoral shaft areas. Results The mean and maximum differences between Dixon-VIBE-3D-MRI vs. CT were 0.2917 and 3.4908 mm, respectively, whereas for WE-VIBE-3D-MRI vs. CT they were 0.3162 and 3.1599 mm. The mean differences of the WE and Dixon methods were equivalent ( P = 0.0292). However, the maximum difference was not equivalent between the two methods and it was higher in WE method. Lin’s concordance-correlation coefficient showed poor agreement between Dixon and WE methods. The mean differences between the CT and 3D-MRI models were significantly higher in the femoral shaft area ( P = 0.0004 for WE and P = 0.0015 for Dixon) than in the other areas. The maximum difference was greatest in the intertrochanteric area for both techniques. Conclusion The difference between 3D-MR and CT models were acceptable with a maximal difference below 3.5mm. WE and Dixon fat suppression methods were equivalent. The mean difference was highest at the femoral shaft area, which was off-center from the magnetization field."
https://openalex.org/W3158101223,"Homologous recombination (HR) faithfully restores DNA double-strand breaks. Defects in this HR repair pathway are associated with cancer predisposition. In genetic engineering, HR has been used extensively to study gene function and it represents an ideal method of gene therapy for single gene disorders. Here, we present a novel assay to measure HR in living cells. The HR substrate consisted of a non-fluorescent 3’ truncated form of the eGFP gene and was integrated into the AAVS1 locus, known as a safe harbor. The donor DNA template comprised a 5’ truncated eGFP copy and was delivered via AAV particles. HR mediated repair restored full-length eGFP coding sequence, resulting in eGFP+ cells. The utility of our assay in quantifying HR events was validated by exploring the impact of the overexpression of HR promoters and the siRNA-mediated silencing of genes known to play a role in DNA repair on the frequency of HR. We conclude that this novel assay represents a useful tool to further investigate the mechanisms that control HR and test continually emerging tools for HR-mediated genome editing."
https://openalex.org/W3159233739,"Schizophrenia is a disorder characterized by psychotic relapses. Globally, about 15%–30% of patients with schizophrenia discharged from inpatient psychiatric admissions are readmitted within 90 days due to exacerbation of symptoms that leads to self-harm, harm to others, or self-neglect. The purpose of this study was to investigate the structure and predictors of in-hospital nursing care leading to reduction in early readmission among patients with schizophrenia. A new questionnaire was developed to assess the extent to which respondents delivered in-hospital nursing care leading to reduction in early readmission among patients with schizophrenia. This study adopted a cross-sectional research design. The survey was conducted with the new questionnaires. The participants were registered nurses working in psychiatric wards. Item analyses and exploratory factor analyses were performed using the new questionnaires to investigate the structure of in-hospital nursing care leading to reduction in early readmission. Stepwise regression analyses were conducted to examine the factors predicting in-hospital nursing care leading to reduction in early readmission. Data were collected from 724 registered nurses in Japan. In-hospital nursing care leading to reduction in early readmission was found to consist of five factors: promoting cognitive functioning and self-care, identifying reasons for readmission, establishing cooperative systems within the community, sharing goals about community life, and creating restful spaces. In-hospital nursing care leading to reduction in early readmission was predicted by the following variables: the score on the nursing excellence scale in clinical practice, the score on therapeutic hold, and the participation of community care providers in pre-discharge conferences. Japanese psychiatric nurses provide nursing care based on these five factors leading to reduction in early readmission. Such nursing care would be facilitated by not only nurses’ excellence but also nurses’ environmental factors, especially the therapeutic climate of the ward and the participation of community care providers in pre-discharge conferences."
https://openalex.org/W3157783724,"Background Inappropriate antibiotic use represents a major global threat. Sepsis and bacterial lower respiratory tract infections (LRTIs) have been linked to antimicrobial resistance, carrying important consequences for patients and health systems. Procalcitonin-guided algorithms may represent helpful tools to reduce antibiotic overuse but the financial burden is unclear. The aim of this study was to estimate the healthcare and budget impact in Argentina of using procalcitonin-guided algorithms to guide antibiotic prescription. Methods A decision tree was used to model health and cost outcomes for the Argentinean health system, over a one-year duration. Patients with suspected sepsis in the intensive care unit and hospitalized patients with LRTI were included. Model parameters were obtained from a focused, non-systematic, local and international bibliographic search, and validated by a panel of local experts. Deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were performed to analyze the uncertainty of parameters. Results The model predicted that using procalcitonin-guided algorithms would result in 734.5 [95% confidence interval (CI): 1,105.2;438.8] thousand fewer antibiotic treatment days, 7.9 [95% CI: 18.5;8.5] thousand antibiotic-resistant cases avoided, and 5.1 [95% CI: 6.7;4.2] thousand fewer Clostridioides difficile cases. In total, this would save $422.4 US dollars (USD) [95% CI: $935;$267] per patient per year, meaning cost savings of $83.0 [95% CI: $183.6;$57.7] million USD for the entire health system and $0.4 [95% CI: $0.9;$0.3] million USD for a healthcare provider with 1,000 cases per year of sepsis and LRTI patients. The sensitivity analysis showed that the probability of cost-saving for the sepsis patient group was lower than for the LRTI patient group (85% vs. 100%). Conclusions Healthcare and financial benefits can be obtained by implementing procalcitonin-guided algorithms in Argentina. Although we found results to be robust on an aggregate level, some caution must be used when focusing only on sepsis patients in the intensive care unit."
https://openalex.org/W3159155643,"Current literature suggests that greater than 50% of survivors of a stroke cannot accurately perceive where their upper extremity is positioned. Our recent work demonstrates that the extent to which this perception is affected can depend on how the task is performed. For example, individuals with stroke who have a deficit in mirroring the position of their passively-placed paretic forearm during a between-arms task may accurately reproduce the position of their actively-controlled paretic forearm during a single-arm task. Moreover, the ability of individuals with various types of unilateral lesions to locate their thumb can depend on whether they reach for their paretic thumb or non-paretic thumb. Consequently, we investigated to what extent the accuracy of individuals post-hemiparetic stroke in mirroring forearm positions on a between-arms task is influenced by various conditions. Eighteen participants with hemiparetic stroke rotated their reference forearm to a target position, and then rotated their opposite forearm to concurrently mirror the position of their reference forearm. This task was performed when participants referenced each forearm (paretic, non-paretic) at two target positions (extension, flexion) for two modes of limb control (passive, active). We quantified for every testing scenario of each participant their position-mirroring error. The number of times for which participants were classified as having a deficit was least when mirroring forearm positions at the flexed position when referencing their non-paretic forearm. Additionally, the difference in the magnitude of errors when participants referenced each arm was greater during active than passive movements. Findings from this study provide further evidence that the accuracy with which individuals post stroke perceive the position of their limbs can depend on how a task is performed. Factors to consider include whether movements are active versus passive, which limb is referenced, and where the limb is positioned."
