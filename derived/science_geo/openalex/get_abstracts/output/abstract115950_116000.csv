https://openalex.org/W2002036587,"We describe here a novel homeobox gene, denoted TGIF (5′TG3' interacting factor), which belongs to an expanding TALE (three amino acid loop extension) superclass of atypical homeodomains. The TGIF homeodomain binds to a previously characterized retinoid X receptor (RXR) responsive element from the cellular retinol-binding protein II promoter (CRBPII-RXRE), which contains an unusual DNA target for a homeobox. The interactions of both the homeoprotein TGIF and receptor RXRα with the CRBPII-RXRE DNA motif occur on overlapping areas and generate a mutually exclusive binding in vitro. Transient cellular transfections demonstrate that TGIF inhibits the 9-cis-retinoic acid-dependent RXRα transcription activation of the retinoic acid responsive element. TGIF transcripts were detected in a restricted number of tissues. The canonical binding site of TGIF is conserved and is an integral part of several responsive elements which are organized like the CRBPII-RXRE. Hence, a novel auxiliary factor to the steroid receptor superfamily may participate in the transmission of nuclear signals during development and in the adult, as illustrated by the down-modulation of the RXRα activities.

INTRODUCTIONHomeobox genes play a fundamental role in directing cellular differentiation processes and in determining cell fate. Over the past 10 years, the term homeodomain has evolved to define a superfamily of protein domains of ∼60 amino acids with homology to the Drosophila homeotic proteins(15.Gehring W.J. Affolter M. Bürglin T. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1994; 63: 487-526Crossref PubMed Scopus (846) Google Scholar). Homeoproteins confer the specificity of action to a wide variety of transcription factors. They exert their action both by their DNA binding surfaces and by domains that are targets for protein:protein interactions with other transcription factors(16.Stark M.R. Johnson A.D. Nature. 1994; 371: 429-432Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 17.Lai J.S. Cleary M.A. Herr W. Genes & Dev. 1992; 6: 2058-2065Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar, 18.Kutoh E. Stromstedt P.E. Poellinger L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 4960-4969Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar).Regulated, tissue-specific, and developmental expression of eukaryotic genes results from the interplay of a variety of transcription factors, like the homeoproteins. They exert their effects on target genes by both activating and repressing transcriptional activities.Vitamin A (retinol) and other retinoids, like the retinoic acid (RA), ( (1)The abbreviations used are: RAretinoic acidRARretinoic acid receptorRAREretinoic acid response elementRXRretinoid X receptorRXREretinoid X response elementPCRpolymerase chain reactionCOUPchicken ovalbumin upstream promoterCRBPcellular retinol-binding proteinCRABPcellular retinoic acid-binding proteinCATchloramphenicol acetyltransferaseGSTglutathione S-transferaseEMSAelectrophoretic mobility shift assay.) were demonstrated to exert striking effects on cell proliferation and differentiation. Excessive intake as well as deficiency of vitamin A generate characteristic toxicity and malformation patterns in a number of organ systems. Retinoic acid as well as a number of small lipophilic hormones mediate their signals through ligand-activated transcription factors belonging to the large steroid/retinoid nuclear receptors superfamily(19.Stunnenberg H.G. Bioessays. 1993; 15: 309-315Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). Two classes of retinoid receptors have been identified; the retinoic acid receptors (RARs) and the retinoid X receptors (RXRs)(20.Chambon P. Zelent A. Petkovitch M. Mendelsohn C. Leroy P. Krust A. Kastner P. Brand N. Saurat J.H. Retinoids: 10 Years On. Karger, Basel1991: 10-27Google Scholar, 21.Mangelsdorf D.J. Borgmeyer U. Heyman R.A. Zhou J.Y. Ong E.S. Oro A.E. Kakizuka A. Evans R.M. Genes & Dev. 1992; 6: 329-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (1060) Google Scholar). Homo- as well as hetero-, dimers of these receptors act in response to retinoids by binding to specific cis-acting retinoid-responsive promoter elements(22.Heery D.M. Pierrat B. Gronemeyer H. Chambon P. Losson R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 726-731Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 23.Kurokawa R. DiRenzo J. Boehm M. Sugarman J. Gloss B. Rosenfeld M.G. Heyman R.A. Glass C.K. Nature. 1994; 371: 528-531Crossref PubMed Scopus (391) Google Scholar), thereby generating a large diversity of transcriptional controls in the retinoid signaling pathways(24.Leid M. Kastner P. Chambon P. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1992; 17: 427-433Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (803) Google Scholar). The expression of several homeogenes was demonstrated to be differentially regulated by RA, and this suggests that homeogenes are likely to control the temporal and spatial modulation of the levels of endogenous retinoids(25.Conlon R.A. Trends Genet. 1995; 11: 314-319Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar).Recently, the diversity of nuclear receptor-mediated control was found to be further extended by the synergy of other transcription factors. The interaction of retinoid receptors and transcription factors of the c-Jun and c-Fos family (AP-1), for example, can either repress or potentiate the retinoid-dependent transcription activation (26.Nicholson R.C. Mader S. Nagpal S. Leid M. Rochette-Egly C. Chambon P. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 4443-4454Crossref PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar, 27.Chen J.Y. Penco S. Ostrowski J. Balaguer P. Pons M. Starrett J.E. Reczek P. Chambon P. Gronemeyer H. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 1187-1197Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar). Therefore, there exist regulatory “cross-talk” pathways that allow modulation of the retinoid signal by the AP-1 signaling system(28.Pfahl M. Endocrin. Rev. 1993; 14: 651-658Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar).There are two classes of cytoplasmic retinoid-binding proteins implicated in the transduction of the retinoid signal which also play an important role in retinoid homeostasis: the cellular retinoic acid-binding proteins, CRABPI and -II, and the cellular retinol-binding proteins CRBPI and -II (for review, see (29.Chytil F. Stump D.G. Saurat J.H. Retinoids: 10 Years On. Karger, Basel1991: 38-45Google Scholar)). CRBPII is expressed mostly in prenatal liver and in adult intestine (29.Chytil F. Stump D.G. Saurat J.H. Retinoids: 10 Years On. Karger, Basel1991: 38-45Google Scholar) and is probably involved in the regulation of the vitamin A signaling pathway by controlling the intracellular transport and storage of retinol, a precursor of retinoic acid(30.Blomhoff R. Green M.H. Berg T. Norum K.R. Science. 1990; 250: 399-404Crossref PubMed Scopus (524) Google Scholar).We show here the functional cloning of a new member of the homeobox gene superfamily, called TGIF, that belongs to a growing superclass of atypical homeodomains, whose hallmark is an extension of three amino acids between α helices 1 and 2. The TGIF homeoprotein recognizes a previously characterized retinoid response motif (CRBPII-RXRE) which consists of an unusual DNA target for a homeobox. TGIF can prevent the retinoid X (RXR) receptor from functioning as a transcriptional activator through interference with the previously characterized CRBPII-RXRE-responsive element(1.Nakshatri H. Chambon P. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 890-902Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 2.Mangelsdorf D.J. Umesono K. Kliewer S.A. Borgmeyer U. Ong E.S. Evans R.M. Cell. 1991; 66: 555-561Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (525) Google Scholar). The consensus binding site of TGIF was identified and is conserved in several CRBPII-RXRE-like responsive elements, suggesting a broader functional association of TGIF with this type of responsive element.MATERIALS AND METHODSCloning and Sequencing of TGIFA Southwestern protocol (31.Singh H. Clerc R.G. LeBowitz J.H. BioTechniques. 1989; 7: 252-261PubMed Google Scholar) was used to screen a λgt11 human embryonic liver cDNA library (Clontech, Catalog No. HL1005b) with a radiolabeled oligonucleotide containing three ligated copies of the CRBPII-RXRE (Fig. 1). The choice of the library was dictated by the high level of RXRα expression in liver. The screening of 106 plaques enabled the identification of a clone which was plaque-purified after two additional expression screening rounds. The positive clone was used as a template to obtain an end-labeled PCR probe with two primers (GATCCGAATTCGGAGATCCAGAATG and GGTCCAAGCTTACTCCACAGAGCTC). This probe was used to rescreen the human embryonic liver cDNA library and a 5′-methylmercuric hydroxide stretched λgt11 human placenta cDNA library (Clontech, Catalog No. HL1075b). Additional positive clones were obtained, and two overlapping λgt11 clones were analyzed further. Their cDNA inserts were isolated either by PCR or enzymatically and subcloned in the EcoRV site of the pSK− plasmid (Stratagene). These cDNA clones (pSK−-TGIF), which once combined, contained the open reading frame (ORF) of TGIF, were enzymatically sequenced on both strands using the dideoxynucleotide termination procedure (U. S. Biochemical Corp.) and a Sequenase polymerase (U. S. Biochemical Corp.) using oligonucleotide primers. Both the PCR and the directly subcloned fragment showed an identical nucleotide sequence except for one error introduced by PCR on a wobble position which did not affect the corresponding amino acid sequence. This PCR fragment was used in the experiments described herein.RNA AnalysisA 300base pair fragment representing the amino-terminal coding region of TGIF was 32P-labeled by the random primers method and used to detect transcripts on a human tissues blot (Clontech) with 2 μg of oligonucleotide dT-selected RNA from different human tissues. Hybridizations were performed in 50% formamide, 5 × SSC, 5 × Denhart's solution, 50 mM sodium phosphate buffer (pH 6.8), 10 mM EDTA, 0.1% SDS, 106 cpm of DNA probe/ml, 200 μg of carrier DNA per ml for 12 h at 42°C. Membranes were washed successively in 6 × SSC, 0.1% SDS and 1 × SSC, 0.1% SDS at room temperature. The amount of RNA loaded was scored by hybridizing the membranes to a control human β-actin cDNA probe.Expression of TGIF for DNA Binding Studies or for Raising Polyclonal Rabbit AntibodiesA Y1089 lysogen strain expressing TGIF was isolated to express the β-galactosidase fusion protein. Extracts were prepared according to (31.Singh H. Clerc R.G. LeBowitz J.H. BioTechniques. 1989; 7: 252-261PubMed Google Scholar). The pSK−-TGIF plasmid was digested with Sau3A or BstUI-DraI, and the DNA fragments encoding the TGIF homeodomain or the complete open reading frame were cloned into the pBSATG vector (32.Clerc R.G. Corcoran L.M. LeBowitz J.H. Baltimore D. Sharp P.A. Genes & Dev. 1988; 2: 1570-1581Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar) in the EcoRV site (see ΔTGIF in Fig. 3A). A pBSATG-Oct plasmid (32.Clerc R.G. Corcoran L.M. LeBowitz J.H. Baltimore D. Sharp P.A. Genes & Dev. 1988; 2: 1570-1581Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar) was linearized with PstI for the expression of Oct-2 POU domain. In vitro transcription was performed using 1 μg of linearized pBSATG-derived templates in a 100-μl reaction containing 200 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 30 mM MgCl2, 10 mM spermidine, 50 mM NaCl. The mixture was incubated for 1.5 h at 37°C, phenol-chloroform-extracted, and ethanol-precipitated, and the pellets were resuspended in 10 μl of diethyl pyrocarbonate water. In vitro translation was carried out for 1 h at 30°C in a 50-μl reaction containing 1 μl of the in vitro transcribed RNA, 10 μCi of L-[35S]methionine (Amersham Catalog No. SJ1015), an amino acid mixture (minus methionine), and 35 μl of rabbit reticulocyte lysate both from Promega (Catalog No. L4960). The translation products were analyzed on SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and showed the expected length.Figure 3:TGIF homeodomain interacts specifically with the retinoid-responsive element CRBPII-RXRE.

Boxes of different sizes represent two different concentrations of GST-HD. Total protein concentration in the binding reactions has been equilibrated with nonprogrammed cell extracts.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)The GST fusion proteins were constructed by ligating in-frame, respectively, in the BamHI or in the EcoRI site from the pGEX-2T vector (Pharmacia): (i) a PCR DNA fragment encoding the TGIF homeodomain plus seven unrelated amino acids (LVPRGSI) at the amino terminus (see GST-HD in Fig. 3B), (ii) the complete open reading frame of TGIF contained in a BstUI-DraI-cut DNA fragment. The pGEX-TGIF full-length DNA fragment was deleted by SmaI and religated in-frame for the expression of the carboxyl-terminal part of TGIF lacking the homeodomain. 2 ml of a saturated overnight culture of E. coli, transformed with the pGEX-2T-TGIF vector, were grown in 50 ml of LB medium prior to isopropyl-1-thio-β-D-galactopyranoside (2 mM final) induction. After a 3-h induction, the bacteria were pelleted. Whole cell extracts were prepared by using a freeze-thaw method (0.4 M KCl buffer)(33.Kumar V. Chambon P. Cell. 1988; 55: 145-156Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (956) Google Scholar). The GST-TGIF was purified by batch adsorption to glutathione-Sepharose 4B (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.). The amino-terminally truncated TGIF protein fused with the GST was isolated from a SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, electroeluted in 50 mM (pH 8.9) (NH4)2CO2 and 0.1% SDS solution, and dialyzed against phosphate-buffered saline to remove SDS before injecting the rabbits. Polyclonal antibodies were raised and tested for specificity according to standard techniques.Generation of Recombinant TGIF-Autographa californica Multiple Nuclear Polyhedrosis Virus for Baculovirus Expression of TGIFA BamHI-SspI DNA fragment, containing the complete coding region of TGIF, was digested from the pGEX-2T-TGIF plasmid and was cloned into Klenow-blunted BamHI-NcoI sites in the pBlueBacHis vector, designed for generation of recombinant baculovirus (Invitrogen). Spodoptera frugiperda ovarian (Sf9) cells (2 × 106 Sf9 cells in TC-100 medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) without fetal calf serum) were co-transfected with 1 μg of wild type A. californica multiple nuclear polyhedrosis virus and 1 μg pBlueBacHis-TGIF. After 96 h, screening for recombinant virus in infected Sf9 cells was performed by serial dilution of the transfection medium supplemented with 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl β-D-galactoside for colorimetric test of positives. A culture of 108 Sf9 cells was infected with recombinant TGIF-A. californica multiple nuclear polyhedrosis virus (infection multiplicity = 5-10). After a 1-h infection in 25 ml of TC 100 medium with 5% fetal calf serum, the total volume was expanded up to 100 ml in a spinner flask. Cells were harvested 72 h after infection, washed once with phosphate-buffered saline buffer, and resuspended in 1 ml of high salt extraction buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 1 mM EDTA, 1 mM dithiothreitol, 600 mM KCl, and protease inhibitors, leupeptin, pepstatin, chymostatin, soybean trypsin inhibitor, aprotinin (all at 10 mg/ml), and phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (1 mM)). Whole cell protein extracts were obtained by lysing the cells with 30 strokes in a 2-ml glass Dounce homogenizer and by centrifuging twice at 10,000 × g for 30 min at 4°C in order to remove cell debris.Dimethyl Sulfate Methylation Interference and Electrophoresis Mobility Shift Assay (EMSA)The EMSAs were performed with the different recombinant proteins as described in (34.Yang N. Schüle R. Mangelsdorf D.J. Evans R.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 3559-3563Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar) and the probes shown in Fig. 1. For the G-specific dimethyl sulfate methylation interference experiment, the CRBPII-RXRE, cloned in the EcoRI site of pBluescript (Stratagene), was removed with HindIII-PstI or BamHI-HincII. This enabled the 32P labeling of the coding and the noncoding strand with Klenow polymerase. DNA probe fragments were isolated by electroelution after polyacrylamide gel separation from the vector backbone and methylated by dimethyl sulfate (Fluka) for 2 min at room temperature(35.Maxam A. Gilbert W. Methods Enzymol. 1980; 65: 449-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Methylated DNA probe (1.5-2 × 105 cpm/300 ng of DNA) was incubated with RXRα isolated from baculovirus or GST-TGIF isolated from bacterial cell extracts and analyzed in an EMSA. Complexed probe and free probe were separated in 6% nondenaturing polyacrylamide gel (acrylamide/bisacrylamide ratio 19:1), and both were isolated by electroelution and then ethanol-precipitated. Pellets were dissolved in 10% piperidine (DuPont NEN), and the DNA was cleaved at 90°C for 30 min before lyophilization followed by two rounds of washing with 20 μl of water. The hydrolysis products were resolved on 8% denaturing acrylamide/urea gels. The dried gels were exposed to x-ray films (Fuji, Inc) with an intensifying screen at −70°C for 12-36 h.Cells and ExtractsCOS-1 cells and U87 cells (glioblastoma, astrocytoma, grade III) were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 200 mM glutamine, and penicillin and streptomycin. For the transfection experiments, 5 × 107 cells (5 ml of suspension) were plated in a 6-cm diameter Petri dish in order to reach 70% confluency at the transfection time. After transfection, cells were treated with 9-cis-RA (see Transfection Experiments and CAT Assay). Whole cell extracts were prepared by using a freeze-thaw protocol (0.4 M KCl buffer)(33.Kumar V. Chambon P. Cell. 1988; 55: 145-156Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (956) Google Scholar).Recombinant Plasmids for Transient Transfection AssaysThe sequences of the DNA-responsive elements used in the reporter plasmids from this study are shown in Fig. 1. The CRBPII-RXRE promoter element (5.Ladias J.A. Karathanasis S.K. Science. 1991; 251: 561-565Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar, 9.Flink I.L. Morkin E. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 11233-11237Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) (see also Fig. 1) or mutated/deleted responsive elements were inserted in the 5′ end of the TATA tk promoter sequence and the CAT (chloramphenicol acetyltransferase) gene reporter sequence from the pBLCAT5 vector (36.Boshart M. Kluppel M. Schmidt A. Schutz G. Luckow B. Gene (Amst.). 1992; 110: 129-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar) between the BamHI and the HindIII sites. The pcDNA-TGIF recombinant plasmid consists of the TGIF cDNA sequence included between the BstUI site (21 base pairs upstream of the initiation initiation codon) and the SspI site (position 1223 in Fig. 2A) which was cloned between the EcoRI and the EcoRV sites of the pcDNA vector (Invitrogen). The pSG5-RXRα recombinant contains the RXRα ORF inserted in the pSG5 vector(37.Green S. Issemann I. Sheer E. Nucleic Acids Res. 1988; 16: 369Crossref PubMed Scopus (544) Google Scholar); the TGIF and RXRα cDNAs were introduced in expression vectors having two different promoters (respectively from cytomegalovirus and SV40) in order to avoid competition between them and therefore to optimize the expression of both proteins. A pcDNA-βGal construct was included as an internal control to standardize the different transfection assays.Figure 2:TGIF cDNA sequence and alignment of atypical homeodomains from the TALE (three amino acid loop extension) superclass. A, the sequences of two independently isolated clones were combined to form a 1.562-kilobase-long cDNA fragment which contained the complete TGIF open reading frame. The deduced amino acid sequence is shown as single-letter code. The cDNA sequence (numbering on the right) encodes a 272-amino acid-long protein (numbering on the left). The atypical homeodomain sequence is underlined. The boxed prolines in the carboxyl-terminal region indicate a putative SH3 domain binding site(13.Yu H. Chen J.K. Feng S. Dalgarno D.C. Brauer A.W. Schreiber S.L. Cell. 1994; 76: 933-945Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (870) Google Scholar). The polyadenylation consensus sequence is shown in reverse lettering. B, alignment of TGIF homeodomain with several TALE homeodomains. The alignment of the amino acid sequences, collected from the GenBank and EMBL data bases, was performed according to the algorithm Pile-up/Prettybox included in the GCG (University of Wisconsin) software package. Identical amino acids between the sequences are shown on black background, whereas the conserved amino acids are shown on gray background. For maximizing identities, 15 amino acids have been deleted in the bE-2 homeodomain at the position indicated by a solid triangle. The positions of the three α helices (α1, α2, and α3) are indicated by open rectangles as in (14.Bürglin T.R. Duboule D. Guidebook to Homeobox Genes.

Okayama H. BioTechniques. 1988; 6: 632-638Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar) with 5 μg of one of the recombinant pBLCAT reporters in the presence or absence of 3 μg of pcDNA-TGIF and/or with various amounts of pSG5-RXRα depending on the cell type used (see Fig. 6). The endogenous TGIF levels were tested, and no significant amounts were detected either by Northern or by EMSA experiments. ( (2)E. Bertolino, B. Reimund, D. Wildt-Perinic, and R. G. Clerc, unpublished data.) In order to detect the TGIF-mediated transactivation regulation, we titrated out the TGIF and the RXRα activities to establish the optimal ratio of TGIF to RXRα. Optimal transactivation was obtained by using 1 μg of the RXRα effector plasmid for the U87 cells and 0.25 μg for the COS-1 cells. 0.5 μg of the pcDNA-βGal internal control was included in each experiment to standardize the transfection efficiency. Finally, calf thymus DNA was added as double-stranded carrier DNA to equalize the DNA concentrations in each precipitate. In several cases, we also used the pcDNA and/or the pSG5 vectors without insert in order to control for a plasmid-driven effect on the expression modulation of the reporter.Figure 6:Repression of both basal and RXRα-dependent transactivation by TGIF in U87 cells and COS-1 cells. A, 5 μg of the pBLCAT5 reporter gene constructs containing several CRBPII-RXREs promoter sequences (see Fig. 1) were co-transfected in U87 cells with either 1 μg of pSG5-RXRα effector plasmid and/or 3 μg of pcDNA TGIF effector plasmid, as indicated (+). B, COS-1 cells were co-transfected with the different reporter gene constructs and effector plasmids as in A except that 0.25 μg of RXRα effector plasmid were transfected. C, control experiments were performed in U87 cells by co-transfecting the reporter plasmids together with the pSG5 and pcDNA plasmids with or without insert in the same conditions as described in A. All experiments were performed in presence of 10-6M 9-cis-retinoic acid for induction of RXRα-specific transcriptional activation. The top part of A, B, and C depict the characteristic thin layer chromatography pattern of nonacetylated and acetylated 14C-labeled chloramphenicol (CAT) obtained in the different CAT assays.

The normalized CAT activity assay was run as described previously(39.Gorman C.M. Moffat L.F. Howard B.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1982; 2: 1044-1051Crossref PubMed Scopus (5288) Google Scholar). Each transfection experiment was repeated at least three times with different plasmid preparations. The percent of chloramphenicol acetylation was determined by thin layer chromatography followed by quantification in a PhosphorImager (Fuji).

This CRBPII-RXRE promoter element is composed of five almost perfectly conserved directly repeated half-sites with the consensus hexanucleotide sequence 5′AGGTCA3'. These hexamer half-sites are spaced by one nucleotide (Figure 1:, Figure 2:, Figure 3:, Figure 4:) and generate a series of direct repeats (DR1). We have numbered these half-sites from 1 to 5 in Figure 1:, Figure 2:, Figure 3:, Figure 4:.

To elucidate the muscular proteolytic system mediated by p94 and to solve the mystery of its unusually rapid autolysis, we searched for p94-binding proteins by the two-hybrid system. Although calpain small subunit plays a crucial role for regulation of ubiquitous calpains, it did not associate with p94.

The cDNA predicts a 83-kDa protein belonging to the branch including CLC-3 and CLC-4, with which it shares approximately 80% identity. Expression of rCLC-5 in Xenopus oocytes elicits novel anion currents. They are strongly outwardly rectifying and have a conductivity sequence of NO3- > Cl- > Br- > I- >> glutamate-. Although CLC-5 has consensus sites for phosphorylation by protein kinase A, raising the intracellular cAMP concentration had no effect on these currents. Currents were also unchanged when rCLC-5 was coexpressed with rCLC-3 and rCLC-4, either singly or in combination. rCLC-5 is expressed predominantly in kidney and also in brain, lung, and liver. Along the nephron, rCLC-5 message is detectable in all tubule segments investigated, but expression in the glomerulus and the S2 segment of the proximal tubule is low."

We constructed a mutant form of VE-cadherin lacking the last 82 amino acids of the cytoplasmic domain. Surprisingly, despite any detectable association of this truncated VE-cadherin to catenin-cytoskeletal complex, the molecule was able to cluster at cell-cell contacts in a manner similar to wild type VE-cadherin.

In contrast, intercellular junction permeability to high molecular weight molecules was severely impaired by truncation of VE-cadherin cytoplasmic domain. These results suggest that the VE-cadherin extracellular domain is enough for early steps of cell adhesion and recognition. However, interaction of VE-cadherin with the cytoskeleton is necessary to provide strength and cohesion to the junction.

https://openalex.org/W2033490823,"We have isolated and cloned a novel epithelial Cl− channel protein from a bovine tracheal cDNA expression library using an antibody probe. The antibody (αp38) was raised against a 38-kDa component of a homopolymeric protein that behaves as a Ca2+/calmodulin kinase II-, DIDS-, and dithiothreitol (DTT)-sensitive, anion-selective channel when incorporated into planar lipid bilayers. The full-length cDNA is 3001 base pairs long and codes for a 903-amino acid protein. The clone does not show any significant homology to any other previously reported Cl− channel sequence. Northern analysis of bovine tracheal mRNA with a cDNA probe corresponding to the cloned sequence revealed a band at 3.1 kilobases, suggesting that close to the full-length sequence has been cloned. The full-length open reading frame (2712 base pairs) has been expressed in Xenopus oocytes and in mammalian COS-7 cells. In oocytes, expression of the clone was associated with the appearance of a novel DIDS-, and DTT-sensitive, anion-selective conductance that was outwardly rectified and exhibited a reversal potential close to 0 mV. Whole-cell patch clamp studies in COS-7 cells transfected with the clone identified an ionomycin-, and DTT-sensitive chloride conductance that was not apparent in mock-transfected or control cells. In vitro translation studies have shown that the primary transcript codes for a protein migrating at 140 kDa under reduced conditions, significantly larger than the polypeptide recognized by αp38. We therefore suggest that either the 140-kDa translated product is a prepro form of the 38-kDa subunit of the previously identified bovine tracheal anion channel and that the primary transcript is post-translationally cleaved to yield the final product, or that the cloned channel and the previously identified bovine tracheal anion channel protein share an epitope that is recognized by the αp38 antibody."

https://openalex.org/W2119356814,"To identify osteoblast-specific cis-acting elements and trans-acting factors, we initiated an analysis of the promoter of a mouse osteocalcin gene, an osteoblast-specific gene. In this promoter, we identified two osteoblast-specific cis-acting elements (Ducy, P. and Karsenty, G.(1995) Mol. Cell. Biol. 15, 1858-1869). The sequence of one of these elements, OSE2, is identical to the DNA-binding site of the PEBP2α/AML-1 transcription factors, the mammalian homologues of the Drosophila Runt protein. Here we show, using nuclear extracts, recombinant protein, and a specific antiserum against AML-1 proteins in DNA-binding assays, that one member of this family, AML-1B, binds specifically to OSE2 and is immunologically related to OSF2, the factor present in osteoblast nuclear extracts that binds to OSE2. By DNA cotransfection experiments, we also demonstrate that AML-1B can increase the activity of a short osteocalcin promoter through its binding to OSE2. Lastly, the different mobilities of osteoblast nuclear extract-DNA complexes compared with T-cell nuclear extract-DNA complexes, along with the inability of OSF2 to be up-regulated by retinoic acid, unlike the other PEBP2α factors, suggest that OSF2 is a new member of this family of transcription factors.

INTRODUCTIONTo date no osteoblast-specific transcription factor has been identified. In an attempt to identify such factors we initiated studies of the cis-acting elements and trans-acting factors that control the expression of the osteocalcin genes in osteoblasts(1.Ducy P. Karsenty G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 1858-1869Crossref PubMed Scopus (518) Google Scholar). Such studies are crucial for a better comprehension of the molecular mechanisms governing osteoblast differentiation. These studies should also increase our understanding of how, in a number of pathological situations, the synthesis of osteocalcin is altered. These include Paget's disease, secondary hyperparathyroidism, and some forms of osteoporosis (for review see (2.Hauschka P.V. Lian J.B. Cole D.E.C. Gundberg C.M. Physiol. Rev. 1989; 69: 990-1047Crossref PubMed Scopus (1028) Google Scholar)). We speculate that in these situations the alterations in the expression of the osteocalcin genes are mediated by transcriptional mechanisms.We previously identified and characterized two osteoblast-specific cis-acting elements in the promoter of mouse osteocalcin gene 2 (mOG2) (1.Ducy P. Karsenty G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 1858-1869Crossref PubMed Scopus (518) Google Scholar). In DNA transfection experiments, these two elements, called OSE1 and OSE2, activate transcription in osteoblastic cell lines only. OSE1, the most proximal element, binds a factor present in nuclear extracts of mouse primary osteoblasts before they are able to mineralize a matrix but absent from nuclear extracts of either mineralizing primary osteoblasts or other cell lines and mouse tissues tested. This finding suggests that the factor binding to OSE1, whose characterization is underway, could be a stage-specific, osteoblast-specific transcription factor.OSE2, the second osteoblast-specific cis-acting element we have characterized, binds a factor present in nuclear extracts of primary osteoblasts, regardless of their stage of differentiation but absent in nuclear extracts of any other cell lines or mouse tissues tested. In this report, we have named this factor osteoblast-specific factor 2 or OSF2. A systematic site-specific mutagenesis of OSE2 enabled us to define a core sequence of 8 bp. ( (1)The abbreviations used are: bpbase pair(s)CMVcytomegalovirusDHFRdihydrofolate reductaseRAretinoic acidivtin vitro transcribed and translatedGRAgel retardation assayslucluciferase.) A single base pair substitution mutation of any of these 8 bp either abolishes or greatly reduces the binding of OSF2 to OSE2. When we compared the OSE2 sequence with the binding sites of known transcription factors(3.Boulikas T. Crit. Rev. Eukacaryotic Gene Expression. 1994; 4: 117-321Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar), we found an identity between it and the DNA-binding site of AML-1(4.Meyers S. Downing J.R. Hiebert S.W. Mol.

The first gene to be identified in this family was the Drosophila segmentation gene runt(10.Kania M.A. Bonner A.S. Duffy J.B. Gergen J.P. Genes & Dev. 1990; 4: 1701-1713Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). The mouse homologues of runt include PEBP2αA (6) and PEBP2αB(7.Ogawa E. Maruyama M. Kagoshima H. Inuzuka M. Lu J.

The mouse and human genes have in common with their Drosophila counterpart a conserved domain called the runt domain, which encodes a 128-amino acids peptide. This domain is responsible for DNA binding and heterodimerization(7.Ogawa E. Maruyama M. Kagoshima H. Inuzuka M. Lu J. Satake M. Shigesada K. Ito Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

We present evidence that OSF2 is immunologically related to the PEBP2α/AML-1 transcription factors. Furthermore, we show by DNA cotransfection experiments that one member of this family, AML-1B, can activate transcription of a short osteocalcin promoter through its binding to OSE2. Taken together these results indicate that either an already described or a new member of the PEBP2α/AML-1B family of transcription factors is involved in osteoblast-specific gene expression.MATERIALS AND METHODSCell Culture and DNA TransfectionMouse F9 teratocarcinoma cells were cultured in Eagle's minimal essential medium/10% fetal bovine serum. The ROS 17/2.8 osteosarcoma cell line and the mouse primary osteoblasts were cultured as described previously (1.Ducy P. Karsenty G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 1858-1869Crossref PubMed Scopus (518) Google Scholar). The human T-lymphoblastic cell lines Molt 4 and Jurkat were maintained in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% calf serum. The day before transfection, F9 cells were plated on 10-cm dishes at a density of 5 × 105 cells/dish. Cells were transfected by the calcium phosphate coprecipitation method(15.Chen C. Okayama H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 2745-2752Crossref PubMed Scopus (4809) Google Scholar), using 5 μg of reporter plasmid, 5 μg of expression vector, and 2 μg of pRSV/βGal. After transfection, the cells were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline (150 mM NaCl, 10 mM sodium phosphate (pH 7.2)) and then incubated in regular medium for 24 h. Cells were harvested by scraping them into 0.3 ml of 0.25 M Tris-HCl (pH 7.9) and lysed by three cycles of freezing-thawing. β-Galactosidase activities present in each lysate, measured by a colorimetric enzyme assay using resorufin β-D-galactopyranoside (Boehringer Mannheim) as a substrate, were used to normalize the transfection efficiency between experiments. Luciferase activities were assayed by using a Monolight 2010 luminometer (Analytical Luminescence Laboratory) and D-luciferin substrate (Analytical Luminescence Laboratory) in 100 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.8), 5 mM ATP, 15 mM MgSO4, and 1 mM dithiothreitol. To induce their differentiation, the F9 cells were plated and treated with 1 μM retinoic acid (RA) (Sigma) for 5 days, as described previously(16.Furukawa K. Yamaguchi Y. Ogawa E. Shigesada K. Satake M. Ito Y. Cell Growth & Differ. 1990; 1: 135-147PubMed Google Scholar). On the second day, the medium was changed, and RA was added again. More than 95% of the cells became differentiated as judged microscopically on the fifth day of incubation. ROS 17/2.8 cells were treated with RA in the same conditions and for the same time.In Vitro Transcription and TranslationThe AML-1B plasmid DNA was transcribed/translated using the TnT kit (Promega), and unlabeled or 35S-labeled methionine for 90 min at 30°C in parallel. 35S-labeled proteins were analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and unlabeled products were used in a gel retardation assay. The ivt AML-1B plasmid was kindly provided by Dr S. Hiebert (St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, TN).DNA ConstructionsDetails of the construction of the reporter plasmids p34-luc, and p6OSE2-luc, p6OSE2 m-luc, and p6OSE1-luc, vectors containing, respectively, 6 copies of the wild-type OSE2 oligonucleotide, 6 copies of the mutant OSE2 oligonucleotide, or 6 copies of the wild-type OSE1 oligonucleotide in front of the −34/+13 mOG2 promoter-luciferase (luc) chimeric gene, have been reported(1.Ducy P. Karsenty G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 1858-1869Crossref PubMed Scopus (518) Google Scholar). The construction of expression vectors containing the AML-1B cDNA cloned, in the correct or opposite orientation, downstream of the CMV5 promoter has been reported(5.Meyers S. Lenny N. Hiebert S.W.

The construction of the expression vector containing the c-Myb cDNA cloned downstream of the DHFR promoter has been reported earlier(17.Clarke M.F. Kukowska-Latallo J.F. Westin E. Smith M. Prochownik E.V. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 884-892Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar), this plasmid was a generous gift of Dr. B. Calabreta (Jefferson Cancer Institute, Thomas Jefferson University, Philadelphia, PA).Nuclear Extract Preparation and DNA Binding AssaysNuclear extracts were prepared according to Dignam et al.(18.Dignam J.D. Lebowitz R.M. Roeder R.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1983; 11: 1475-1489Crossref PubMed Scopus (9142) Google Scholar) and Schreiber et al.(19.Schreiber E. Matthias P. Muller M.M. Schaffner W. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 6419Crossref PubMed Scopus (3908) Google Scholar). Buffers for the preparation of nuclear extracts contained 0.5 mM dithiothreitol and the protease inhibitors 0.5 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and 10 μg/ml of leupeptin and pepstatin. For the gel retardation assays (GRA), labeled double-stranded oligonucleotides were prepared as described previously(1.Ducy P. Karsenty G. Mol. Cell.

The oligonucleotides used in this study are presented in Table 1. For competition experiments, the indicated amount of double-stranded unlabeled oligonucleotide was added to the binding reaction with the other components. For experiments using anti-AML-1B antiserum, which was raised against a 17-amino acid N-terminal peptide of AML-1(4.Meyers S. Downing J.R. Hiebert S.W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 6336-6345Crossref PubMed Scopus (425) Google Scholar), the indicated amount of anti-AML-1B antiserum was added either with or without the antigenic peptide to the reaction mixture 30 min before the probe. Anti-AML-1B antiserum and AML-1B antigenic peptide were a generous gift of Dr S. Hiebert. When needed, the indicated amount of a purified antibody raised against the transcription factor c-Myb (Upstate Biotechnology Incorporated) was added during the binding reaction.Tabled 1 Open table in a new tab RESULTSThe OSE2 Sequence and PEBP2 α/AML-1 Binding Sites Are SimilarA comparison of the OSE2 sequence 5′ AACCACA 3′ with the binding site of known transcription factors (3.Boulikas T. Crit. Rev. Eukacaryotic Gene Expression. 1994; 4: 117-321Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar) showed that the most homologous binding sites were those for AML-1 and PEBP2α, a group of transcription factors conserved between mouse and human that recognize the DNA sequence 5′PuCCPuCA3' (Fig. 1). Given this sequence homology, we tested whether oligonucleotides containing either the OSE2 sequence or the Moloney murine leukemia virus PEBP2α binding site (20.Wang S. Speck N.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 89-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar) would bind similar factors present in nuclear extracts of ROS 17/2.8 cells.When we used the OSE2 oligonucleotide as a probe in GRA and ROS 17/2.8 nuclear extracts as a source of proteins, we observed a protein-DNA complex already described (Fig. 2, lane 1)(21.Gidoni D. Dynan W.S. Tjian R. Nature. 1984; 312: 409-413Crossref PubMed Scopus (334) Google Scholar). The formation of this complex was inhibited by a 50-fold molar excess of the wild-type OSE2 oligonucleotide or the wild-type PEBP2α oligonucleotide (Fig. 2, lanes 2-7). This complex was unaffected by 100-fold of a mutant OSE2 oligonucleotide containing a 2-bp substitution mutation or of a mutant PEBP2α oligonucleotide containing the same 2-bp substitution mutation (Fig. 2, lanes 8 and 9). When we used as a probe in GRA the PEBP2α oligonucleotide and incubated it with ROS 17/2.8 nuclear extracts, we detected a protein-DNA complex that had the same mobility pattern as the one formed upon incubation of these nuclear extracts with the labeled OSE2 oligonucleotide (Fig. 2, compare lanes 1 and 10). Formation of this protein-DNA complex was inhibited by a 50-100-fold molar excess of the wild-type OSE2 oligonucleotide or the wild-type PEBP2α oligonucleotide (Fig. 2, lanes 11-16). A large excess of mutant OSE2 oligonucleotide or mutant PEBP2α oligonucleotide containing the 2-bp substitution mutation failed to inhibit this binding (Fig. 2, lanes 17 and 18). In summary, the equal mobility of the complexes and the results of the DNA competition experiments indicate that OSF2, the factor present in osteoblast nuclear extracts and binding to OSE2, is related to the PEBP2α/AML-1 proteins. The fact that in DNA competition experiments the same molar excess of the PEBP2α oligonucleotide and the OSE2 oligonucleotide was necessary to abolish binding of OSF2 to either probe suggests that OSF2 has a similar affinity for the PEBP2α binding site and OSE2.Figure 2:OSF2 binds to the OSE2 oligonucleotide and the PEBP2α oligonucleotide. DNA binding was analyzed by gel retardation assay. Lanes 1-9, labeled wild-type OSE2 oligonucleotide was incubated with ROS 17/2.8 nuclear extracts. Competition experiments were performed with either the same unlabeled wild-type (wt) oligonucleotide (lanes 2-4), the wild-type PEBP2α oligonucleotide (lanes 5-7), the mutant (mut) OSE2 oligonucleotide (lane 8), or the mutant PEBP2α oligonucleotide (lane 9). Lanes 10-18, labeled PEBP2α oligonucleotide was incubated with ROS 17/2.8 nuclear extracts. Competition experiments were performed with either the unlabeled wild-type OSE2 oligonucleotide (lanes 11-13), the wild-type PEBP2α oligonucleotide (lanes 14-16), the mutant OSE2 oligonucleotide (lane 17), or the mutant PEBP2α oligonucleotide (lane 18). Molar excess of unlabeled competitors are indicated.

This ivt protein has been shown to bind to the PEBP2α binding site and to the AML-1B binding site(5.Meyers S. Lenny N. Hiebert S.W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 1974-1982Crossref PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar). The ivt AML-1B protein bound to the labeled OSE2 oligonucleotide; this binding was specific because it could be abolished by a 200-fold molar excess of the wild-type OSE2 oligonucleotide but not by a 400-fold molar excess of the mutant OSE2 oligonucleotide (Fig. 3A, lanes 1-4). As a control, we performed the same experiment using the wild-type PEBP2α oligonucleotide as a probe and showed that ivt AML-1B bound specifically to this oligonucleotide (Fig. 3A, lanes 5-11). The ivt AML-1B-DNA complex always had a slightly slower mobility when we used the PEBP2α oligonucleotide than when we used the OSE2 oligonucleotide. We then used an antiserum directed against the N-terminal part of AML-1B in GRA. As shown in Fig. 3B (lane 3), this antibody inhibited binding of ivt AML-1B protein to the OSE2 oligonucleotide. To show the specificity of this interaction, we performed two control experiments. First, when added during the binding reaction, the peptide against which this antiserum was raised prevented the abolition of binding (Fig. 3B, lane 4). Second, a purified antibody against an unrelated transcription factor, c-Myb, had no effect on the binding of the ivt AML-1B protein to the labeled OSE2 oligonucleotide (Fig. 3B, lane 5). As previously reported, the binding of ivt AML-1B to the PEBP2α oligonucleotide was abolished specifically by the anti-AML-1B antiserum but not by the unrelated anti-c-Myb antibody (Fig. 3B, lanes 6-10).Figure 3:Binding of recombinant AML-1B protein to the OSE2 or PEBP2 α oligonucleotides. DNA binding was analyzed by gel retardation assay. A, a labeled wild-type OSE2 oligonucleotide (lanes 1-4) or a labeled wild-type PEBP2α oligonucleotide (lanes 5-11) was incubated with in vitro transcribed and translated AML-1B protein (ivt AML-1B). Competition experiments were performed with 200- and 400-fold molar excess of the wild-type OSE2 oligonucleotide (lanes 2 and 3 and lanes 6 and 7), 200- and 400-fold molar excess of the wild-type PEBP2α oligonucleotide (lanes 9 and 10), 400-fold molar excess of the mutant OSE2 oligonucleotide (lanes 4 and 8), and 400-fold molar excess of the mutant PEBP2α oligonucleotide (lane 11). B, labeled wild-type OSE2 oligonucleotide (lanes 1-5) or wild-type PEBP2α oligonucleotide (lanes 6-10) was incubated with ivt AML-1B protein alone (lanes 1 and 6) or in the presence of 2 μl of a preimmune serum (lanes 2 and 7), 2 μl of the anti-AML-1B antiserum (lanes 3 and 8), 2 μl of the anti-AML-1B antiserum, and 4 μg of the corresponding antigenic peptide (lanes 4 and 9), 1 μl of a purified anti-c-Myb antibody (lanes 5 and 10).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)We then asked whether the anti-AML-1B antiserum could alter the binding of ROS 17/2.8 or mouse primary osteoblast nuclear extracts to the labeled OSE2 oligonucleotide. As shown in Fig. 4, the addition of increasing amounts of anti-AML-1B antiserum substantially decreased or abolished the binding of either ROS 17/2.8 nuclear extracts or mouse primary osteoblast nuclear extracts to the OSE2 oligonucleotide (Fig. 4, lanes 2-5 and 11-14). As was the case for the ivt AML-1B protein, this decreased binding was inhibited by the addition during the binding reaction of the AML-1 antigenic peptide against which the antiserum was raised (Fig. 4, lanes 8 and 17). This inhibition of binding was not observed when we used a 10-fold higher amount of an anti-c-Myb antibody as a control (Fig. 4, lanes 9 and 18). We chose an antibody against c-Myb because c-Myb is also a myeloid-specific transcription factor that binds to a sequence related but not identical to the OSE2 sequence(17.Clarke M.F. Kukowska-Latallo J.F. Westin E. Smith M. Prochownik E.V. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 884-892Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar). In summary, the specific binding of the ivt AML-1B protein to the OSE2 oligonucleotide, as well as the abolition of binding of osteoblast nuclear extracts to the OSE2 oligonucleotide by the addition of the anti-AML-1B antiserum in the binding reaction, indicates that a PEBP2α/AML-1-related protein is present in osteoblast nuclear extracts and binds specifically to OSE2. As stated above we named this PEBP2α/AML-1-related factor OSF2. We next asked whether we could distinguish OSF2 from the other PEBP2α factors.Figure 4:Abolition of OSF2 binding to DNA by an anti-AML-1B antiserum. DNA binding was analyzed by gel retardation assay. Labeled wild-type OSE2 oligonucleotide was incubated with either ROS 17/2.8 nuclear extracts (lanes 1-9) or mouse primary osteoblast nuclear extracts (lanes 10-18), in the absence of anti-AML-1B antiserum (lanes 1, 6, 10, and 15), in presence of the indicated amount of the anti-AML-1B antiserum alone (lanes 2-5, 7, 11-14, and 16), in presence of the indicated amount of anti-AML-1B antiserum and the AML-1B antigenic peptide (12 μg, lane 8, and 7 μg, lane 17) or in presence of a purified anti-c-Myb antibody (1 μl) (lanes 9 and 18). Incubation conditions were as described under “Materials and Methods.”View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)OSF2, the OSE2 Binding Factor, and the Factor Present in Lymphocytes Nuclear Extracts Have Different Mobilities in GRAWe showed earlier that OSF2 was present only in nuclear extracts of primary osteoblasts or osteoblastic cell lines(1.Ducy P. Karsenty G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 1858-1869Crossref PubMed Scopus (518) Google Scholar). This initial analysis included nuclear extracts of a mouse B-cell line as one of our negative controls but did not include nuclear extracts of T-cell lines or other hematopoietic cell lines known to contain PEBP2α factors. Given the results presented above, we performed a GRA using nuclear extracts of mouse primary osteoblasts, ROS 17/2.8 osteoblastic cells, the S 194 mouse B-cells, and two different human T-cell lines known to contain PEBP2α factors, the Jurkat and the Molt 4 cell lines(4.Meyers S. Downing J.R. Hiebert S.W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 6336-6345Crossref PubMed Scopus (425) Google Scholar). The mobility of the protein-DNA complexes formed upon incubation of osteoblast nuclear extracts with the OSE2 oligonucleotide or the PEBP2α oligonucleotide were different from the mobility of the protein-DNA complexes formed upon incubation of human T-cell nuclear extracts with the same oligonucleotides (Fig. 5A, lanes 1-2, 4-5, 6-7, and 9-10). Interestingly, the protein-DNA complex formed upon incubation of mouse S 194 B-cell nuclear extract with either the labeled OSE2 oligonucleotide or the labeled PEBP2α oligonucleotide migrated at the same location as the protein-DNA complexes formed upon incubation of the human T-cell nuclear extracts and any of these two probes (Fig. 5A, compare lane 3 to lanes 4 and 5, and lane 8 to lanes 9 and 10). This result indicates that the difference in migration observed between the mouse and rat osteoblast nuclear extracts-DNA complexes and the lymphocyte nuclear extracts-DNA complexes was not species dependent. As a control of the integrity of the nuclear extracts used we showed that intact Sp1 binding activity was present (Fig. 5C).Figure 5:OSF2-DNA complex has a different mobility than PEBP2 α/AML-1 DNA-complexes. DNA binding was assayed by gel retardation assay. A, labeled wild-type OSE2 oligonucleotide (lanes 1-5) or labeled wild-type PEBP2α oligonucleotide (lanes 6-10) was incubated with nuclear extracts of nonmineralizing mouse primary osteoblasts (lanes 1 and 6), of ROS 17/2.8 (lanes 2 and 7), of S 194 (lanes 3 and 8), of Molt 4 (lanes 4 and 9), and of Jurkat cells (lanes 5 and 10). The long arrow denotes the OSF2-DNA complex, the shorter arrow denotes the lymphocyte nuclear extracts-DNA complex. B, labeled wild-type OSE2 oligonucleotide was incubated with nuclear extracts of ROS 17/2.8 (lane 1), of untreated F9 (lane 2), of RA-treated F9 (lane 3), and of untreated (lane 4) or RA-treated (lane 5) ROS 17/2.8 cells. The retinoic acid treatment and incubation conditions were as described under “Materials and Methods.” C, labeled Sp1 oligonucleotide was incubated with either nuclear extracts of nonmineralizing mouse primary osteoblasts (lane 1), of ROS 17/2.8 (lane 2), of Molt 4 (lane 3), of Jurkat (lane 4), of untreated (lane 5), or RA-treated F9 cells (lane 6).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)The Synthesis of OSF2 Is Not Inducible by Retinoic Acid Treatment of F9 or ROS 17/2.8 CellsThe PEBP2α factors are not detectable in nuclear extracts of untreated F9 mouse teratocarcinoma cells but are present in nuclear extracts of F9 cells differentiated by a 5-day treatment with RA(16.Furukawa K. Yamaguchi Y. Ogawa E. Shigesada K. Satake M. Ito Y. Cell Growth & Differ. 1990; 1: 135-147PubMed Google Scholar). We took advantage of this feature of the PEBP2α factors to determine whether the mobility of diffentiated F9 nuclear extracts-DNA complexes was identical to the mobility of osteoblast nuclear extracts-DNA complexes in GRA. We generated nuclear extracts of F9 cells either untreated or treated with RA for 5 days and used them in a GRA. As shown previously(22.Satake M. Inuzuka M. Shigesada K. Oikawa T. Ito Y. Jpn. J.

However, a monoclonal antibody (JM-403) against native heparan sulfate (van den Born, J., van den Heuvel, L. P. W. J., Bakker, M. A. H., Veerkamp, J. H., Assmann, K. J. M., and Berden, J. H. M. (1992) Kidney Int. 41, 115-123) largely failed to stain tubular basement membranes, suggesting the presence of heparan sulfate chains lacking the specific JM-403 epitope. Heparan sulfate preparations from various sources differed markedly with regard to JM-403 binding, as demonstrated by liquid phase inhibition in enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, the interaction decreasing with increasing sulfate contents of the polysaccharide. Mapping of the JM-403 epitope indicated that it was dominated by one or more N-unsubstituted glucosamine unit(s), since treatments that destroyed or altered the structure of such units in heparan sulfate preparations (cleavage at N-unsubstituted glucosamine units with HNO2 at pH 3.9 and N-acetylation with acetic anhydride, respectively), abolished antibody binding. Conversely, immunoreactivity could be induced in a (D-glucuronyl-1,4-N-acetyl-D-glucosaminyl-1,4) polysaccharide by the generation of N-unsubstituted glucosamine units by chemical N-deacetylation. The presence of N-unsubstituted glucosamine in a JM-403-binding heparan sulfate (preparation HS-II from human aorta) was demonstrated by an ∼3-fold reduction in molecular size following HNO2 (pH 3.9) treatment. Further characterization of the epitope recognized by JM-403, based on enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay inhibition tests with chemically/enzymatically modified polysaccharides, indicated that one or more N-sulfated glucosamine units are invariable present, whereas L-iduronic acid and O-sulfate residues appear to inhibit JM-403 reactivity. It is concluded that the epitope contains one or more N-unsubstituted glucosamine and D-glucuronic acid units and is located in a region of the heparan sulfate chain composed of mixed N-sulfated and N-acetylated disaccharide units.

INTRODUCTIONProteoglycans consist of one or more glycosaminoglycan side chains covalently bound to a core protein(1.Ruoslahti E. Ann. Rev.

The heparan sulfate proteoglycans (HSPGs) ( (1)The abbreviations used are: HSPGheparan sulfate proteoglycanHSheparan sulfatemAbmonoclonal antibodyELISAenzyme-linked immunosorbent assayFITCfluorescein isothiocyanatePAPSadenosine 3′-phosphate 5′-phosphosulfate.) constitute a major class of proteoglycans that are found in the extracellular matrix, especially in basement membranes, and at the cell surface, associated with the cell membrane(3.David G. FASEB J. 1993; 7: 1023-1030Crossref PubMed Scopus (373) Google Scholar, 4.Gallagher J.T. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1989; 1: 1201-1218Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar, 5.Lindahl U. Lidholt K. Spillmann D. Kjellén L. Thromb. Res. 1994; 75: 1-32Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar). Many biological activities of HSPGs are due to interactions between the heparan sulfate (HS) polysaccharide side chains and a variety of proteins, which include extracellular matrix molecules, enzymes, enzyme inhibitors, growth factors and other cytokines(2.Kjellén L. Lindahl U. Ann. Rev. Biochem. 1991; 60: 443-475Crossref PubMed Scopus (1671) Google Scholar, 5.Lindahl U. Lidholt K. Spillmann D. Kjellén L. Thromb.

Biol. 1994; 4: 677-682Crossref Scopus (133) Google Scholar)).The biosynthesis of HS involves the formation of a nonsulfated (GlcAβ1,4-GlcNAcα1,4)n precursor polysaccharide, which subsequently undergoes a series of polymer-modification reactions. These reactions start with N-deacetylation/N-sulfation of GlcNAc residues, which is followed by C-5 epimerization of GlcA to iduronic acid (IdoA) units, and finally by O-sulfation at various positions(5.Lindahl U. Lidholt K. Spillmann D. Kjellén L. Thromb. Res. 1994; 75: 1-32Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar). The GlcA C-5 epimerization and O-sulfation reactions occur in the close vicinity of N-sulfate groups, pointing to a key role for the glucosaminyl N-deacetylase/N-sulfotransferase enzyme in determining the overall extent of modification of the HS chain. Structural analysis of HS preparations have revealed that the modifications tend to colocalize in block sequences, separated by relatively unmodified domains(16.Schmidt A. Lemming G. Yoshida K. Buddecke E. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 59: 322-328PubMed Google Scholar, 17.Lyon M. Deakin J.A. Gallagher J.T. J. Biol.

Bengtsson-Olivecrona G. Fransson L.Å. Biochem. J. 1991; 279: 821-829Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). The extent of biosynthetic modification, affecting the number, length, and substitution patterns of the modified domains as well as their position along the HS chain, may differ among cell types(20.Kato M. Wang H. Bernfield M. Gallagher J.T. Turnbull J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 18881-18890Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), alter during proliferation(21.Schmidt A. Buddecke E. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 52: 229-235PubMed Google Scholar), and change as a result of cell transformation(22.Pejler G. David G. Biochem. J. 1987; 248: 69-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 23.Iozzo R.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 2690-2699Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Structural analysis of HS is complicated by the fact that even highly purified and uniform preparations consist of mixtures of polysaccharide chains that have reached different levels of modification. Monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) that specifically recognize well defined epitopes in HS could be major tools in such analysis. We recently described the production of such an anti-HS mAb, JM-403(24.Born van den J. Heuvel van den L. P. W.J. Bakker M.A.H. Veerkamp J.H. Assmann K.J.M. Berden J.H.M. Kidney Int. 1992; 41: 115-123Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar), which has now been partially characterized with regard to the epitope requirement. In the present report, evidence is provided that the epitope is dominated by the presence of an unsubstituted glucosamine residue(s). Moreover, immunohistochemical application of the mAb demonstrates that the N-unsubstituted GlcN units occur in situ, hence in native HS, and is not introduced as an artifact during the isolation procedure. The possible biological significance of these findings is discussed.MATERIALS AND METHODSGlycosaminoglycansHS (preparation HS-II), isolated from human aorta essentially according to Iverius(25.Iverius P.-H. Biochem. J. 1971; 124: 677-683Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar), was provided by W. Murphy (University of Monash, Melbourne, Australia). Five HS preparations, isolated from bovine aorta, lung, intestine, and kidney (two different preparations), were provided by K. Yoshida (Seikagaku Corp., Tokyo, Japan). HS from bovine kidney (used to coat the ELISA plates) was purchased from Seikagaku. HS from bovine liver was as described previously(26.Oldberg A. Kjellén L. Höök M. J. Biol.

J. 1984; 217: 187-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar), samples (1 mg) of polysaccharides were dissolved in 1 ml of hydrazine hydrate (Fluka; H2O content, 36%) containing 1% (w/v) hydrazine sulfate and heated in sealed glass tubes at 96°C. After 4 h, the samples were repeatedly evaporated to dryness and desalted on PD-10 columns (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.) according to the instructions of the manufacturer. N-Acetylation by treatment with acetic anhydride was performed as described by Danishefsky and Steiner(32.Danishefsky I. Steiner H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1965; 101: 37-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Completely (N- and O-) desulfated, N-deacetylated heparin was prepared according to Jacobsson et al.(33.Jacobsson I. Bäckström G.

Chem. 1979; 254: 2975-2982Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).For heparin lyase digestion, samples (1 mg) of HS were dissolved in 200 μl of 50 mM HEPES, pH 7.0, 1 mM CaCl2, containing 10 milliunits of heparitinase (Seikagaku, enzyme also known as heparinase III, EC 4.2.2.8) or 10 units of heparinase I (Sigma; EC 4.2.2.7) and incubated at 37°C for 5 h. To ensure end-point digestion, the same amount of enzyme was added again twice for additional 5- and 10-h incubation periods (total incubation time, 20 h). Reactions were terminated by inactivation of the enzymes by heating at 96°C for 5 min. The supernatants obtained after centrifugation at 13,000 rpm for 5 min were recovered.Native and modified polysaccharides were analyzed by gel chromatography on a column (1 × 90 cm) of Sephacryl S-300 in 0.5 M NaCl, eluted at a rate of 4.8 ml/h. Effluent fractions of 1.6 ml were collected and analyzed for hexuronic acid by the carbazole reaction(34.Bitter T. Muir H.M. Anal. Biochem. 1962; 4: 330-334Crossref PubMed Scopus (5142) Google Scholar).Immunochemical ProceduresIndirect immunofluorescence was performed as described previously (35.Born van den J. Heuvel van den L.

The antibodies used were a goat antibody toward human glomerular basement membrane HSPG core protein, coded Bl31(36.Heuvel van den L. P. W.J. Born van den J. Velden van de T. J. A.M. Veerkamp J.H.

Immunol. 1986; 137: 3900-3908PubMed Google Scholar) (Seikagaku), and 10E4 (39.David G. Mei Bai X. van der Schueren B. Cassiman J.-J. van den Berghe H. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 119: 961-975Crossref PubMed Scopus (405) Google Scholar) (gift from Dr. G. David, Leuven, Belgium); and the mouse mAb 3G10 (IgG2b), reacting with HS stubs generated by heparitinase digestion (39.David G. Mei Bai X. van der Schueren B. Cassiman J.-J. van den Berghe H. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 119: 961-975Crossref PubMed Scopus (405) Google Scholar) (gift from Dr. G. David). As secondary antibodies we used FITC-labeled rabbit anti-goat IgG (Dako, Glostrup, Denmark), FITC-labeled goat anti-mouse IgM (Fc) (Nordic, Tilburg, The Netherlands), and FITC-labeled F(ab′)2-fragments of sheep anti-mouse IgG (Organon Teknika, Turnhout, Belgium). Control experiments in which the FITC-labeled secondary antibodies were applied to the sections without prior primary antibody incubation were consistently negative. In double-staining experiments, sections were blocked using an avidin/biotin blocking kit (Vector, Burlingame, CA) and were then incubated with anti-HS mAb JM-13 followed by tetramethylrhodamine isothiocyanate-labeled goat anti-mouse IgM (Fc) (Nordic). Thereafter, biotinylated anti-HS mAb JM-403 was applied to the sections and visualized using FITC-labeled extravidine (Southern Biotechnology Associates Inc., Alabama, AL). The double staining experiments included the following controls: (a) omitting biotinylated mAb JM-403 or mAb JM-13 or both; (b) incubating with mAb JM-13 followed by extravidine-FITC. N-Acetylation of primary amino groups within the sections was done by applying 0.5 M borate buffer (pH 9.0) containing 2.5 μl of acetic anhydride/ml for 3 × 10 min onto the sections. These were then washed in phosphate-buffered saline, and the routine immunofluorescence procedure was initiated. The effect of N-acetylation was ascertained by applying fluorescamine (Sigma), a fluorogenic reagent for primary amines, onto the sections. Sections were examined on a Zeiss Axioskop microscope equipped for fluorescence microscopy.The JM-403 inhibition ELISA on HS-coated plates was performed as described previously (40.Born van den J. Kraats van A.A. Bakker M.A.H. Assmann K.J.M. Heuvel van den L. P. W.J. Veerkamp J.H. Berden J.H.M. Diabetologia. 1995; 38: 161-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar) and is based on the inhibition of mAb JM-403 binding to coated HS by liquid phase polysaccharides. Percentage inhibition was calculated as (1 - (A450 with inhibitor/A450 without inhibitor)) × 100%. IC50 (ng of HS/ml) is defined as the concentration of HS that gives 50% inhibition in the ELISA system.StatisticsThe correlation between degree of HS sulfation and IC50 in the JM-403 inhibition ELISA was calculated using the Spearman rank correlation test; p < 0.05 was regarded as significant.RESULTSExpression of the JM-403 Epitope in Different Heparan SulfatesImmunofluorescence with anti-HS mAb JM-403 on cryostat sections showed the presence of the cognate epitope in a variety of basement membranes, as demonstrated in Fig. 1A for the rat kidney. The glomerular basement membrane stained most intensely, along with Bowman's capsule and the basal lamina surrounding vascular smooth muscle cells. By contrast, the tubular basement membranes were largely negative. On the other hand, all renal basement membranes were stained by an antibody against the core protein of a HSPG derived from human glomerular basement membrane (Fig. 1B). They were likewise positive for mAb 3G10, which reacts with the residual HS stubs remaining after enzymatic cleavage by heparitinase (Fig. 1C). The resultant 3G10 epitope contains an essential, terminal, 4,5-unsaturated uronate residue and thus can serve as a general HS marker(39.David G. Mei Bai X. van der Schueren B. Cassiman J.-J. van den Berghe H. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 119: 961-975Crossref PubMed Scopus (405) Google Scholar). These results indicate the presence of HSPG molecules in all renal basement membranes, only some of which contain the JM-403 epitope. To strengthen this conclusion, we performed double-staining experiments on rat kidney cryostat sections, using biotinylated mAb JM-403 and another anti-HS mAb (JM-13), which also shows a selective basement membrane staining (37.Born van den J. Heuvel van den L. P. W.J. Bakker M.A.H. Veerkamp J.H. Assmann K.J.M. Berden J.H.M. Lab. Invest. 1991; 65: 287-297PubMed Google Scholar). We thus found HS positive tubular basement membranes with anti-HS mAb JM-13 (Fig. 2A), which are negative (or below the detection limit of the method) for JM-403 (Fig. 2B).Figure 2:Double-staining of heparan sulfate in rat kidney cryostat sections by indirect immunofluorescence.

Magnification, × 350.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)The heterogeneity of HS preparations with regard to JM-403 binding was furthermore demonstrated by testing the inhibitory capacity of eight HS preparations, isolated from different sources, in the JM-403 ELISA. The results (Table 1) clearly demonstrate a great variability in antibody binding to these HS preparations. Interestingly, the sulfate content of these polysaccharides correlated with the IC50 (p = 0.0011) in the JM-403 ELISA, indicating that the JM-403 epitope is predominantly found in low sulfated (<1.0 sulfate group/disaccharide unit) HS species.Tabled 1 Open table in a new tab The JM-403 Epitope Is Dependent on the Presence of an N-Unsubstituted Glucosamine Residue(s)In order to further define the JM-403 epitope, HS from human aorta (HS-II) was selectively degraded so as to allow the separate isolation of N-sulfated and N-acetylated block structures. N-Sulfated oligosaccharides were isolated after deacetylation of GlcNAc residues using hydrazinolysis followed by exhaustive deamination at pH 3.9, which results in cleavage of the polysaccharide at the N-unsubstituted units (see “Materials and Methods”). N-Acetylated oligosaccharides were recovered following exhaustive deamination of the polysaccharide at pH 1.5, which cleaves the polysaccharide at N-sulfated GlcN residues. The results shown in Fig. 3A demonstrate loss of JM-403 binding for the N-sulfated as well as the N-acetylated oligosaccharides derived from HS-II. Unexpectedly, pH 3.9 deamination alone, i.e. not proceeded by N-deacetylation, also abolished antibody reactivity, pointing to the presence of N-unsubstituted GlcN in HS-II and to a role for an N-unsubstituted GlcN residue(s) in antibody recognition. Conversely, generation of N-unsubstituted GlcN by N-deacetylation not followed by deamination resulted in increased JM-403 binding. Further evidence for an essential role of N-unsubstituted GlcN derived from the complete loss of reactivity following chemical N-acetylation of HS-II using acetic anhydride (Fig. 3A). In addition, however, N-sulfated GlcN residues would seem to be important, as indicated by the loss of antibody binding after deamination at pH 1.5.Figure 3:Fluid phase inhibition of JM-403 binding to kidney heparan sulfate by chemically modified HS-II, K5, and heparin preparations. Dose-response inhibition curves were generated as described under “Materials and Methods.” A, native HS-II (•); N-deacetylated HS-II (+); HS-II treated with HNO2 at pH 1.5, HS-II treated with HNO2 at pH 3.9, N-deacetylated HS-II treated with HNO2 at pH 3.9, or N-acetylated HS-II (○; all samples showing lack of reactivity).

A shift of the peak elution position, corresponding to a decrease in Mr from ∼45 × 103 to 12-15 × 103, was observed (Fig. 4), suggesting the presence of, on the average, two or three N-unsubstituted GlcN units/chain. By contrast, HS-II that had been previously N-acetylated by reaction with acetic anhydride resisted deamination under these conditions. This control experiment ascertained that deaminative cleavage at pH 3.9 is indeed restricted to N-unsubstituted GlcN residues.Figure 4:Effect of high-pH deamination on HS-II. Samples of HS-II were subjected to gel chromatography on Sephacryl S-300, as described under “Materials and Methods,” before (○) and after (•) treatment with HNO2 at pH 3.9. Effluent fractions were analyzed for hexuronic acid by the carbazole reaction. The elution pattern of a sample of HS-II that had been subjected to chemical N-acetylation followed by deamination at pH 3.9 was essentially unchanged compared with that of native, untreated HS-II (data not shown).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)N-Acetylation of kidney cryostat sections with acetic anhydride abolished all staining due to mAb JM-403 (data not shown). This treatment simultaneously precluded staining of the section with fluorescamine, as expected for acetylation of primary amino groups. By contrast, the staining intensities of three other anti-HS mAbs (JM-13, 10E4, and HepSS1) as well as of the anti-HSPG core antibody Bl31, were only marginally affected by the treatment with acetic anhydride (data not shown). These findings indicate that unsubstituted amino groups do indeed occur in native HS, as present in tissue sections that have not been treated or fixed in any way (see Fig. 1A) and confirm our conclusion that N-unsubstituted GlcN units are essential for recognition by mAb JM-403.Recognition of Chemically Modified Heparin and E. coli K5 Capsular Polysaccharides by mAb JM-403Neither the nonsulfated E. coli K5 capsular polysaccharide, which has the same (GlcA-GlcNac)n structure as the unmodified biosynthetic precursor of heparin/HS(27.Vann W.F. Schmidt M.A. Jann B. Jann K. Eur. J. Biochem. 1981; 116: 359-364Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar), nor native heparin, which is extensively modified and carries ∼2,5 sulfate groups/disaccharide unit, showed any binding to JM-403 (Fig. 3B). N-Deacetylating the polysaccharides by hydrazinolysis induced strong antibody reactivity in the K5 polysaccharide, but not in heparin (Fig. 3B). These findings demonstrate that a structure composed of alternating GlcA and N-unsubstituted GlcN units, joined by the appropriate linkages, is sufficient for antibody recognition. Why is the N-deacetylated heparin, which is expected to contain 2-3 N-unsubstituted GlcN units/chain(41.Kusche M. Torri G. Casu B. Lindahl U. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 7292-7300Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), not recognized by JM-403? Since N-desulfation of heparin also failed to induce JM-403 reactivity (Fig. 3B), it seemed likely that factors other than the availability of N-unsubstituted GlcN units would have to be considered.N-Deacetylated, N/O-desulfated (“naked”) heparin differs from N-deacetylated K5 polysaccharide in one major regard, i.e. the occurrence of IdoA units. The effects of these constituents were evaluated by testing N-deacetylated K5 polysaccharide as well as naked heparin in the JM-403 inhibition ELISA. The inhibitory activity of naked heparin was ∼100-fold lower than that of the N-deacetylated K5 polysaccharide (Fig. 3B). Since the naked heparin differs from the N-deacetylated K5 polysaccharide merely by the presence of IdoA, it is inferred that such units interfere with antibody binding; the residual activity is probably associated with the limited number of GlcA residues present in the polymer (∼20% of the total hexuronic acid contents(41.Kusche M. Torri G. Casu B. Lindahl U. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 7292-7300Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar)). Contrary to the native heparin, N-deacetylated heparin and N-desulfated heparin, the naked heparin was reactive (Fig. 3B), indicating that removal of O-sulfate groups exposed epitope structures. To confirm the negative effect of O-sulfate groups on JM-403 binding, we compared in the ELISA the inhibition induced by N-deacetylated K5 polysaccharide with that of the N-deacetylated, O-sulfated analog. This latter K5 derivative contains an average of 1.2 O-sulfate (but no N-sulfate) groups/disaccharide unit. The locations of the O-sulfate groups were not defined but would presumably primarily involve C-6 of the GlcN units, along with C-2 and/or C-3 of the GlcA units. The results in Fig. 3B clearly show that O-sulfation of N-deacetylated K5 polysaccharide s"

Vertebrates have six classes of β-tubulin isotypes, each displaying a distinct pattern of expression. Although the functional significance of multiple β-tubulins has not been fully defined, there is evidence that the individual isotypes contribute to differences in microtubule dynamics and drug binding. To determine if alterations in the expression of β-tubulin isotypes play a role in taxol resistance, a PCR-based methodology was developed that permits highly specific amplification of each of the six known murine β-tubulin isotypes. Two isotypes, Mβ5 and Mβ3, were expressed abundantly in the drug-sensitive parental J774.2 cells. Although expressed at an extremely low level in the parental cells, expression of the Mβ2 isotype was increased 21-fold (<0.005) in the cell line most resistant to taxol. These findings suggest that a cell can alter its relative tubulin isotype composition in response to an external stress and specifically imply that altered expression of Mβ2, the class II β-tubulin isotype, may contribute to the development of high resistance to taxol.

Sci. 1986; 466: 745-756Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar) subunits have been observed. Attempts to characterize either altered expression or mutations of specific tubulin genes in mammalian cells have been hindered by the presence of multiple tubulin genes (at least 6 α-tubulin and 6 β-tubulin genes)(18.Sullivan K.F. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1988; 4: 687-716Crossref PubMed Scopus (426) Google Scholar, 19.Cowan N.J. Dudley L. Int. Rev. Cytol. 1983; 85: 147-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 20.Lewis S.A.

Within a particular species, multiple β-tubulin genes encode highly conserved polypeptides with individual sequences typically diverging in 2-8% of approximately 450 residues (21.Cleveland D.W. J. Cell Biol. 1987; 104: 381-383Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). Most of the variation between isotypes occurs in the last 15 residues of the β-tubulin molecule and these isotype-defining regions are conserved completely across species(22.Sullivan K.F. Cleveland D.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 4327-4331Crossref PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar). The classification system adopted by Sullivan and Cleveland (18.Sullivan K.F. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1988; 4: 687-716Crossref PubMed Scopus (426) Google Scholar, 22.Sullivan K.F. Cleveland D.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 4327-4331Crossref PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar) is based upon these conserved sequences and is therefore applicable to all vertebrates so far studied. In mouse, the β-tubulin isotypes are classified as follows: class I, Mβ5; class II, Mβ2; class III, Mβ6; class IVa, Mβ4; class IVb, Mβ3; and class VI, Mβ1(18.Sullivan K.F. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1988; 4: 687-716Crossref PubMed Scopus (426) Google Scholar, 20.Lewis S.A. Cowan N.J. Avila J. Microtubule Proteins. CRC Press, Boca Raton, FL1990: 37-65Google Scholar). Each isotype class has a unique pattern of tissue expression ranging from constitutive for classes I and IVb to highly restricted for the brain-specific (classes III and IVa) and the hematopoietic-specific (class VI) isotypes(23.Cowan N.J. Lewis S.A. Sarkar S. Gu W. Maccioni R. Arechays J. The Cytoskeleton in Cell Differentiation and Development. ICSU Press, Miami, FL1987: 157-166Google Scholar). Class II β-tubulin is expressed at low levels in a wide variety of tissues; however, the major site of expression is brain(22.Sullivan K.F. Cleveland D.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 4327-4331Crossref PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar). The differential expression and high conservation of isotypes have raised the question of whether isotypes provide unique biochemical properties that result in functional differences in microtubules. Several groups using isotype-specific sera have shown that microtubule structures in several cultured cell lines are composed of all of the expressed isotypes(24.Lewis S.A. Gu W. Cowan N.J. Cell. 1987; 49: 539-548Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar, 25.Lopata M.A. Cleveland D.W. J. Cell Biol. 1987; 105: 1707-1720Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). In addition, transfection with exogenous isotypes not normally expressed in the recipient cell results in incorporation of these isotypes into the microtubule cytoskeleton(24.Lewis S.A. Gu W. Cowan N.J. Cell. 1987; 49: 539-548Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar, 26.Bond J.F. Fridovich-Keil J.L. Pillus L. Mudligan R.C. Solomon F. Cell. 1986; 44: 461-468Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). In contrast, other studies have suggested a specific function for individual isotypes. For example, during differentiation of P19 (27.Falconer M.M. Echeverri C.J. Brown D.L. Cell Motil. Cytoskeleton. 1992; 21: 313-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar) and PC12 (28.Asai D.J. Remolona N.M. Dev. Biol. 1989; 132: 398-409Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar) neuronal cells, microtubule structures are preferentially made up of specific isotypes. Moreover, in vitro studies using purified bovine brain tubulin have indicated that there are inherent functional differences among the isotype classes in terms of microtubule dynamics(29.Panda D.

The functional differences among isotype classes raise the question of whether isotype composition of a cell could vary in response to taxol, a drug that interacts with microtubules. We have identified one domain of the taxol binding site on β-tubulin as the N-terminal 31 amino acids of the polypeptide(33.Rao S. Krauss N.E. Heerding J.M. Swindell C.S. Ringel I. Orr G.A. Horwitz S.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 3132-3134Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Since mutations in the drug binding site could lead to altered drug binding and result in drug resistance to taxol, it was of considerable interest to sequence this region of the β-tubulin genes expressed in taxol-resistant cell populations. Isotype-specific oligonucleotide primer pairs, which span the region of the β-tubulin genes encoding the taxol-binding domain, have been designed for use in polymerase chain reactions (PCRs). ( (1)The abbreviations used are: PCRpolymerase chain reactionUTRuntranslated regionMAPmicrotubule-associated protein.) Using a single pair of oligonucleotide primers per isotype, both the level of expression and the nucleotide sequence of each of the six known murine β-tubulin isotypes can be determined with great specificity. Moreover, we have successfully applied this methodology to murine cell lines selected in vitro for various levels of resistance to either taxol or the closely related compound taxotere. Our results indicate that expression of Mβ2, the class II β-tubulin isotype, is increased 21-fold in the most highly taxol-resistant cell line. polymerase chain reaction untranslated region microtubule-associated protein. All cell lines were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 1% L-glutamine, 1% nonessential amino acids, and 1% penicillin-streptomycin (Life Technologies, Inc.). J774.2 cells were maintained in either 10 or 20% heat-inactivated horse serum, J7-T1-45 in 20% serum, and all other cell lines were maintained in 10% serum. All drug-resistant cells lines were derived from the mouse macrophage-like drug-sensitive cell line, J774.2, by stepwise increases in drug concentration and maintained as described previously(34.Roy S.N. Horwitz S.B. Cancer Res. 1985; 45: 3856-3863PubMed Google Scholar, 35.Greenberger L.M. Lothstein L. Williams S.S. Horwitz S.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 3762-3766Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar) in the following concentrations of drug: J7-T1-45, 45 μM taxol (Drug Development Branch, National Cancer Institute); J7-T3-1.6, 1.6 μM taxol; J7-T4-0.4, 0.4 μM taxol; and J7-Ter1-0.08, 0.08 μM taxotere (a gift from Rhône-Poulenc). The ED50 of each cell line was determined using the CellTiter 96™ AQueous nonradioactive cell proliferation assay (Promega Corp., G5430). Cells were resuspended in either drug-free medium or, in the case of J7-T1, in 45 μM taxol that is required for normal cell proliferation(34.Roy S.N. Horwitz S.B. Cancer Res. 1985; 45: 3856-3863PubMed Google Scholar). 1-2 × 103 cells/well were added to a 96-well tissue culture plate and allowed to attach overnight. Following the addition of 50 μl of medium, a serial dilution of the drug to be tested was carried out. The cells were incubated for 72 h, and then 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-5-(3-carboxymethoxyphenyl)-2-(4-sulfophenyl)-2H-tetrazolium and phenazine methosulfate solutions were freshly mixed and added to the cells. After 1-2 h at 37°C, plates were read at 490 nm on a Bio-Tek Instruments microplate reader, model EL320. Cells were scraped off plates, washed twice with cold phosphate-buffered saline and resuspended in 10 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 250 mM sucrose, and 0.1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. After a 10-min incubation on ice, cells were lysed with a prechilled Dounce homogenizer and centrifuged for 10 min at 2500 × g. The supernatant was removed and centrifuged in a Beckman A95 airfuge rotor at 100,000 × g for 30 min. Equal amounts of cytosolic protein (100 μg) from each cell line were resolved by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis on 9% gels. Following electroblot transfer of the polypeptides, nitrocellulose blots were probed with a monoclonal anti-α (Sigma, T-9026) or anti-β tubulin (Sigma, T-4026) antibody, as described previously (36.Greenberger L.M. Williams S.S. Horwitz S.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 13685-13689Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and visualized using 125I labeled anti-mouse antibody (Amersham Corp., IM.131). Blots were quantitated on a Molecular Dynamics PhosphorImager, model 400E. Total RNA (20-50 μg), isolated from drug-sensitive and -resistant cell lines with TRI Reagent™(37.Chomczynski P. TRI Reagent: RNA, DNA, Protein Isolation Reagent. Manufacturer Protocol. Molecular Research Center, Inc., Cincinnati, OH1993Google Scholar) (Molecular Research Center, Inc.), was treated with RNase-free DNase (Boehringer Mannheim) to remove contaminating genomic DNA. Treated RNA (1 μg) was reverse-transcribed using Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase and random hexanucleotide primers, as described by Noonan et al.(38.Noonan K.E. Beck C. Holzmayer T.A. Chin J.E. Wunder J.S. Andrulis I.L. Gazdar A.F. Willman C.L. Griffith B. Von Hoff D.D. Roninson I.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 7160-7164Crossref PubMed Scopus (783) Google Scholar). For subsequent verification of complete removal of genomic DNA, aliquots of each RNA sample were also subjected to mock reverse transcription, in the absence of reverse transcriptase. A cDNA amount representing 50 ng of RNA was subjected to PCR for 35 cycles in a final volume of 25 μl using 1 unit of Amplitaq polymerase (Perkin-Elmer). Following an initial denaturation of 3 min at 94°C, each cycle consisted of 30 s at 94°C, 30 s at 55°C, and 90 s at 72°C. To verify removal of genomic DNA, PCR amplification was initially performed on the relevant samples using intron-spanning primers specific for the murine glyceraldehyde 3′-phosphate dehydrogenase gene. The sequences of the forward and reverse glyceraldehyde-3'-phosphate dehydrogenase primers based on published sequence (39.Sabath D.E. Broome H.E. Prystowsky M.B. Gene (Amst.). 1990; 91: 185-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (380) Google Scholar) were 5′-ACGGCAAATTCAACGGCAC-3' and 5′-TAGTGGGGTCTCGCTCCTGG-3', respectively. Unless otherwise specified, target β-tubulin and control β2-microglobulin gene sequences were co-amplified in the same reaction. The gene-specific oligonucleotide primers are listed in Table 1 along with the size of the PCR products. The primers for the Mβ1, Mβ3, Mβ4, and Mβ5 isotypes were derived from the published sequences of these genes (40.Wang D. Villasante A. Lewis S.A. Cowan N.J. J. Cell Biol. 1986; 103: 1903-1910Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar) and were designed to amplify the entire region encoding amino acids 1-31 of the relevant β-tubulin polypeptide. The unpublished nucleotide sequences of the 5′ end of the Mβ2 isotype and the 3′ end of the Mβ6 isotype were kindly provided by Drs. N. Cowan and S. Lewis (Dept. of Biochemistry, New York University School of Medicine, New York). Primers specific for the murine β2-microglobulin gene were derived from the published sequence(41.Daniel F. Morello D. Le Bail O. Chambon P. Cayre Y. Kourilsky P. EMBO J. 1983; 2: 1061-1065Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Specific amplification of individual β-tubulin isotypes using these primer pairs was confirmed with full-length cDNAs of each of the six cloned murine β-tubulin isotypes, generously provided by Drs. N. Cowan and S. Lewis.Tabled 1 Open table in a new tab Following PCR, aliquots (10 μl) were electrophoresed on 12% polyacrylamide gels, and bands were visualized by UV transillumination using ethidium bromide staining prior to photography. Densitometry was performed on photographic negatives, and the ratio between the target and control PCR products for each cDNA sample was determined by dividing the densitometric volume of the target electrophoretic band by that of the control band(42.Gilbert J. Norris M.D. Haber M. Kavallaris M. Marshall G.M. Stewart B.W. Mol. Cell. Probes. 1993; 7: 227-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 43.Bordow S.B. Haber M. Madafiglio J. Cheung B. Marshall G.M. Norris M.D. Cancer Res. 1994; 54: 5036-5040PubMed Google Scholar). At least three independent RNA-PCR analyses were performed, and the mean densitometric PCR ratio for each set of analyses was determined. Differences between the PCR ratios of various cDNA samples for a given β-tubulin isotype were assessed by Student t tests using two-sided p values. Total RNA (10 μg) was separated on a 1.5% agarose gel containing formaldehyde and transferred to GeneScreen Plus nylon membrane (DuPont NEN). Blots were prehybridized in buffer containing 10% dextran sulfate, 1% SDS, 1 M NaCl, 50 mM Tris (pH 7.8), and salmon sperm DNA. An isotype-specific oligonucleotide probe, 5′-GCTGGAGGACAACAGAAGTTCACTAAGGGTGCACACTGTA-3', was designed based on the published sequence of the 3′-untranslated region (UTR) for the Mβ2 isotype(40.Wang D. Villasante A. Lewis S.A. Cowan N.J. J. Cell Biol. 1986; 103: 1903-1910Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). Blots were hybridized at 57°C overnight with γ-32P-end-labeled probe, washed in 2 × SSC for 20-30 min at room temperature followed by a second wash in 2 × SSC, 0.1% SDS at 57°C for 30 min, and exposed to Kodak X-Omat film for 1-2 days. To control for variations in sample loading, blots were reprobed with a Xenopus histone H4 probe. For each β-tubulin isotype expressed in a given cell line, the PCR product was subjected to direct cycle sequencing (fmol DNA Sequencing System, Promega Corp.) with the same oligonucleotide primers used for amplification. Following PCR amplification, aliquots (25 μl) were electrophoresed on low melting temperature agarose, and the bands were cut from the gel and purified (PCR Wizard Preps™, Promega Corp.). Where a given β-tubulin isotype was expressed at very low levels, the amount of PCR product available for sequencing was increased by band-stabbing the product (44.Bjourson A.J. Cooper J.E. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 4675Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar) and then reamplifying it with the same primers. The two oligonucleotide primers used for amplification were end-labeled with [γ-33P]ATP prior to sequencing both strands of the PCR product. The response of the taxol-resistant cell lines to a number of cytotoxic agents was tested using an MTT-based assay. Compared with the other drugs tested, the parental J774.2 cells were exceptionally sensitive to taxotere (Table 2). The -fold resistance of each cell line for each drug was determined using the parental cells as a reference. The cell lines were most resistant to the selecting drug (taxol in the case of J7-T1, J7-T3, and J7-T4; taxotere in the case of J7-Ter1). However, there was significant cross-resistance to the other taxane, and all resistant cell lines demonstrated cross-resistance to colchicine, vinblastine, and doxorubicin.Tabled 1 Open table in a new tab All taxane-resistant cell lines had increased levels of both α- and β-tubulin as compared with the parental cell line (Fig. 1). The relative level of α-tubulin was increased to a greater extent than that of β-tubulin. The increase in tubulin was independent of the level of taxane resistance in each of the cell lines. Thus, similar levels of β-tubulin were observed in the most taxol-resistant cell line, J7-T1, and in the least resistant cell line, J7-T4, despite the fact that they were maintained in taxol concentrations varying by 2 orders of magnitude. The lowest level of β-tubulin was detected in the taxotere-selected cell line, despite it being more resistant to both taxol and taxotere than J7-T4 cells. The high level of sequence conservation within the coding regions of β-tubulin genes suggested that isotype-specific oligonucleotide primers should be designed within the nonconserved UTR of these genes(19.Cowan N.J. Dudley L. Int. Rev. Cytol. 1983; 85: 147-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). In view of the proximity of the gene sequence encoding a domain of the taxol-binding site (amino acids 1-31) to the 5′-UTR, isotype-specific primer pairs were therefore designed, where possible, so that the forward primer bound to the 5′-UTR of the relevant isotype and the reverse primer bound 3′ to the taxol-binding region (Table 1). Since the 5′-UTR of the Mβ6 isotype has not been cloned, ( (2)S. Lewis, personal communication.) primers specific for this isotype were designed entirely within the 3′-UTR of this gene. Absolute specificity of these primer pairs was confirmed by using cloned cDNAs encoding each of the six murine β-tubulin isotypes as individual templates (data not shown). The only exception involved amplification of an intense PCR product by the Mβ5-specific primers when using the cloned Mβ6 isotype as template. This resulted from a cloning artifact, whereby the cloned Mβ6 cDNA contained the complete Mβ6 coding region but juxtaposed with the Mβ5 5′-UTR due to failure to successfully clone the Mβ6 5′-UTR.2 Having confirmed the isotype specificity of each of the β-tubulin primer pairs, expression of each isotype was determined in the J774.2 cell line and in each of the drug-resistant sublines. Since the tubulin multigene family is known to include a number of genomic, intronless, nonfunctional pseudogenes(19.Cowan N.J. Dudley L. Int. Rev. Cytol. 1983; 85: 147-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar), complete absence of genomic DNA in the cDNA samples for RNA-PCR analysis was a necessity. Therefore, RNA samples were treated exhaustively with DNase prior to reverse transcription, and complete removal of genomic DNA was confirmed by PCR using primers specific for the glyceraldehyde-3'-phosphate dehydrogenase gene, which is known to have multiple genomic pseudogenes (45.Piechaczyk M. Blanchard J.M. Riaad-El-Sabouty S. Dani C. Marty L. Jeanteur P. Nature. 1984; 312: 469-471Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Expression of each of the six β-tubulin isotypes was analyzed in the parental J774.2 cells and in the four drug-resistant sublines using a competitive PCR reaction involving co-amplification of a specific β-tubulin isotype with a control gene, β2-microglobulin. The utility of this assay for semiquantitative analysis of expression of a range of genes, both in tumor samples and in cultured cells, has been previously demonstrated (42.Gilbert J. Norris M.D. Haber M. Kavallaris M. Marshall G.M. Stewart B.W. Mol. Cell. Probes. 1993; 7: 227-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 43.Bordow S.B. Haber M. Madafiglio J. Cheung B. Marshall G.M. Norris M.D. Cancer Res. 1994; 54: 5036-5040PubMed Google Scholar). Following PCR, expression of the Mβ5, Mβ3, and Mβ2 isotypes was found in all five cell lines (Fig. 2). In contrast, PCR products were not detectable for Mβ1, Mβ4, or Mβ6 isotypes in any cell line following competitive PCR (data not shown). To determine whether low level expression of these isotypes would be detectable using a more sensitive assay, PCR analyses were repeated in the absence of the primers for β2-microglobulin. Under these conditions, the Mβ4- but not the Mβ1- or Mβ6-specific primers produced a faint PCR product that was detectable at apparent equal intensity in all five cell lines (data not shown). To determine whether β-tubulin pseudogenes would be detectable by the isotype-specific primer pairs employed in this analysis, samples of genomic DNA isolated from the J774.2 cell line were amplified using each of the pairs of β-tubulin primers. A PCR product of the identical size to that amplified from cDNA samples was detected in genomic DNA following amplification with Mβ2- and Mβ3-specific primers (Fig. 2). These findings are consistent with the presence of β-tubulin pseudogenes homologous to Mβ2 and Mβ3. Following densitometric analysis, the level of expression in each cell line of the three β-tubulin isotypes yielding detectable PCR products in the competitive RNA-PCR assay was quantitated relative to expression of β2-microglobulin by determining the ratio between target and control PCR products for each sample (Table 3). The mean PCR ratio for expression of the Mβ5 isotype in the J774.2 cell line was significantly greater (p < 0.05) than that of either the Mβ3 or Mβ2 isotype. The level of expression of the Mβ5 isotype was significantly higher in each of the four cell lines selected with either taxol or taxotere (p < 0.005 in each case) than in the parental J774.2 cells (Table 3, Fig. 2). Despite its considerably higher resistance to taxol than that of the other three cell lines, the level of expression of Mβ5 in the J7-T1 cell line was not significantly different from that found in either the J7-T3 or J7-Ter1 cell line and in fact was significantly lower (p < 0.05) than the level observed in the least resistant J7-T4 cell line. A similar pattern of expression of the Mβ3 isotype was observed in the various cell lines (Table 3, Fig. 2). Expression of the Mβ3 isotype, above the level in J774.2 cells, was observed in all four of the taxol/taxotere-selected cell lines, although this effect only achieved significance in the J7-T4 cell line. In contrast, a very different pattern of expression of the Mβ2 isotype was observed in these cell lines (Table 3, Fig. 2). Expression of this isotype in J774.2, J7-T3, J7-T4, and J7-Ter1 cells lines was barely detectable, whereas high level expression of this isotype was observed in the extremely taxol-resistant J7-T1 cell line.Tabled 1 Open table in a new tab To confirm the increased expression of the Mβ2 isotype observed using RNA-PCR in the highly taxol-resistant J7-T1 cell line, Northern blot analysis was performed. A 40-base pair synthetic oligonucleotide was designed based on the sequence of the 3′-UTR of Mβ2(40.Wang D. Villasante A. Lewis S.A. Cowan N.J. J. Cell Biol. 1986; 103: 1903-1910Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). Isotype specificity of this probe was confirmed by Southern blot analysis using cloned full-length cDNAs of the murine β-tubulin isotypes (data not shown). Consistent with the RNA-PCR analysis, Mβ2 mRNA was clearly detectable in the J7-T1 cell line, whereas no Mβ2 expression was visible in J774.2 or the three other drug-resistant cell lines (Fig. 3). The complete nucleotide sequence encoding the first 31 amino acids of the β-tubulin polypeptide was determined for each of the four β-tubulin isotypes expressed in the J774.2 cells and in each of the taxol/taxotere-selected cell lines. Direct cycle sequencing of PCR products amplified by each of the isotype-specific primer pairs was performed using the same primers employed for PCR amplification. Comparison of the predicted amino acid sequences obtained for the Mβ2, Mβ3, Mβ4, and Mβ5 isotypes expressed in the J774.2 cell line with the sequences obtained for these isotypes expressed in normal mouse tissues (40.Wang D. Villasante A. Lewis S.A. Cowan N.J. J. Cell Biol. 1986; 103: 1903-1910Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar) ( (3)N. Cowan and S. Lewis, personal communication.) revealed no alterations in any of the isotypes. At the nucleotide level, the sequences of the Mβ2 and Mβ4 isotypes in the J774.2 cells were identica"

https://openalex.org/W1984941270,"Rat aorta smooth muscle cells which express all three α1-adrenoreceptors (α1A, α1B and α1D) were used to determine the effect of stimulation of α1-adrenergic receptor subtypes on cell growth. “Combined”α1-adrenoreceptor subtype stimulation with norepinephrine alone caused a concentration-dependent, prazosin-sensitive increase in protein content and synthesis: 48 h of stimulation at 1 μM increased cell protein to 216 ± 40% of time-matched controls (p = 0.008) and RNA to 140 ± 13% (p = 0.03); protein synthesis increased to 167 ± 13% (p < 0.01) after 24 h. Stimulation with norepinephrine plus the selective α1A/α1D antagonist 5-methylurapidil produced greater increases in α-actin mRNA (270 ± 40% at 8 h; p = 0.007), total cell protein (220 ± 45% at 24 h; p = 0.004), and RNA (135 ± 8% at 24 h; p = 0.01). These effects were prevented by pretreatment with the selective α1B antagonist chloroethylclonidine. Comparable results were obtained for intact aortae. Stimulation with norepinephrine plus 5-methylurapidil increased (p < 0.05) tissue protein, RNA, dry weight, and α-actin mRNA; and as in cultured cells, combined stimulation with norepinephrine alone attenuated these responses. By comparison, adventitia (fibroblasts) was unaffected.

In cholesterol-fed monkeys, elevated plasma norepinephrine (NE) greatly increased atherosclerotic lesion growth(17.Kukrega R.S. Datta B.N. Chakravarti R.N. Atherosclerosis. 1981; 40: 292-298Google Scholar). Infusion of NE over a 2-week period, at a level which did not cause sustained elevation of blood pressure, induced formation of atherosclerotic vascular lesions in rabbit aorta(18.Helin P. Lorenzen I. Garbarsch C. Matthiessen E. Atherosclerosis. 1970; 12: 125-132Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). There is also evidence that α1ARs mediate growth of myocardial cells. In cultured neonatal rat cardiac myocytes that possess both β1 and α1ARs, stimulation of α1ARs with NE increased cell protein, RNA, myocyte surface area, and contractile protein expression(19.Simpson P. Circ. Res. 1985; 56: 884-889Crossref PubMed Scopus (403) Google Scholar). However, no studies have examined whether α1ARs influence proliferation-independent growth of SMCs.Both molecular cloning and pharmacologic studies have shown that α1ARs are comprised of three closely related subtypes(20.Bylund D.B. Eikenberg D.C. Hieble J.P. Langer S.Z. Lefkowitz R.J. Minneman K.P. Molinoff P.B. Ruffolo Jr., R.R. Trendelenburg U. Pharmacol. Rev. 1994; 46: 121-136PubMed Google Scholar, 21.Dohlman H.G. Thorner J. Caron M.G. Lefkowitz R.J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1991; 60: 653-688Crossref PubMed Scopus (1130) Google Scholar). We have recently used polymerase chain reaction (22.Ping P. Faber J.E. Am. J. Physiol. 1993; 265: H1501-H1509Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and RNase protection assays ( (2)A. E. Eckhart and J. E. Faber, submitted for publication.) to determine expression of αAR subtype mRNA by rat vascular SMCs. Freshly isolated and early passage cultured aortic and vena cava SMCs express both α1B and α1D mRNA(20.Bylund D.B. Eikenberg D.C. Hieble J.P. Langer S.Z. Lefkowitz R.J. Minneman K.P. Molinoff P.B. Ruffolo Jr., R.R. Trendelenburg U. Pharmacol. Rev. 1994; 46: 121-136PubMed Google Scholar), and it appears that both receptors are present on SMCs of rat aorta (24, 25, and (22.Ping P. Faber J.E. Am. J. Physiol. 1993; 265: H1501-H1509Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and references therein). Rat aorta has been shown recently to also express α1A (formerly denoted “α1C”) mRNA(26.Perez D.M. Piascik M.T. Malik N. Gaivin R. Graham R.M. Mol. Pharmacol. 1994; 46: 823-831PubMed Google Scholar, 27.Rokosh D.G. Bailey B.A. Stewart A.F.R. Karns L.R. Long C.S. Simpson P.C. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

Given this multiplicity of α1AR expression, the purpose of the present study was first to examine both in vitro and in situ, the effects of combined stimulation of the α1AR subtypes with NE alone on proliferation-independent growth, and expression of sarcomeric α-SMC-actin and cytoskeletal β-actin mRNAs by arterial and venous SMCs. Second, effects of combined stimulation were compared with those during treatment with NE plus antagonists, 5-methylurapidil (5-MU, selectivity = α1A > α1D > α1B) to favor α1B stimulation and after pretreatment with chloroethylclonidine (CEC, selectivity = α1B > α1D > α1A) to select for stimulation of non-α1BARs. The results suggest, in both cultured aorta SMCs and intact aorta media, that stimulation of CEC-sensitive α1ARs (possibly α1B) induces hypertrophy of aorta SMCs and that stimulation of 5-MU-sensitive, non-α1BARs antagonizes this response. Thus, alterations in the relative activity of different α1AR subtype signaling pathways may participate in both normal vascular growth and remodeling and also in vascular hypertrophic diseases.MATERIALS AND METHODSCell CulturePrimary cultures of vascular SMCs were each obtained from pooled thoracic aortae or vena cavae from eight adult Sprague-Dawley rats (200 g, Sasko, Omaha, NE) by a modification (22.Ping P. Faber J.E. Am. J. Physiol. 1993; 265: H1501-H1509Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) of the method of Turla et al.(30.Turla M.B. Thompson M.M. Corjay M.H. Owens G.K. Circ. Res. 1991; 68: 288-299Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar) and maintained in Medium 199 (M199) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 200 mg/ml L-glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. Cells were passaged at 90-95% confluence with 0.05% trypsin/EDTA every 5-7 days and seeded at a density of 5000 cells/cm2 on plastic plates. Viable cell number was determined by hematocytometry with trypan blue exclusion in duplicate. To favor the differentiated phenotype and quiescence, in all experiments cells were exposed to experimental conditions beginning at 4 days after reaching confluence in passage 4. A separate cell line was used in each experimental replicate. These cultures lacked contamination by other cell types as revealed by immunohistochemistry with monoclonal antibodies (Dako A/S, Glostrup, Denmark) against SMC-specific α-actin and von Willebrand factor.ProtocolsTo examine the effect of combined α1AR stimulation on SMC growth, as reflected by changes in total protein and RNA per cell(19.Simpson P. Circ. Res. 1985; 56: 884-889Crossref PubMed Scopus (403) Google Scholar), in the first experiment aorta or vena cava cells were exposed for 8, 24, and 48 h to 1 μM NE. In this and all subsequent experiments, 100 μM ascorbate was present to prevent NE degradation(19.Simpson P. Circ. Res. 1985; 56: 884-889Crossref PubMed Scopus (403) Google Scholar), plus 0.5 μM rauwolscine and 1 μM propranolol to minimize activation of α2- and βARs. Control cells in all experiments were time-matched and exposed to these agents, but not to NE (vehicle groups). In a second experiment cells were exposed to 1 μM NE and also to the α1 antagonist prazosin (1 μM). mRNAs for SMC-specific α-actin, β-actin, α1DAR, and α1BARs were measured (below). Effects of combined α1AR stimulation were also examined in aorta SMCs maintained in serum-free media after the second day of post-confluence (48 h before start of experiment). Serum-free media consisted of 50% DMEM, 50% F-12 media supplemented with 2.85 mg/ml insulin, 5 mg/liter transferrin, 35.2 mg/liter ascorbic acid, 6 μg/ml selenium, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. Since responses were similar regardless of presence or absence of serum (see “Results”) subsequent experiments (below) were conducted in serum-free medium. In a third experiment, aorta SMCs were exposed for 24 h to NE (10-9 to 10-5M) for determination of concentration-response effects. In a fourth experiment aortic SMCs were exposed for 8 and 24 h to 1) vehicle, 2) 10 μM NE, 3) NE plus the α1A/D antagonist 5-MU (0.3 μM), or 4) NE after pretreatment with the selective α1B antagonist CEC (3 μM)(20.Bylund D.B.

Physiol., in pressGoogle Scholar). Cells were incubated with CEC for 30 min at 37°C to alkylate and irreversibly inactivate α1BARs, followed by several media changes. During this incubation rauwolscine and propranolol were present to minimize alkylation of other ARs. CEC was not present during the subsequent 24-h exposure to NE. Concentrations of all antagonists were selected based on our previous determinations of their efficacy in in vitro vascular contractile studies (31.Leech, C. J., Faber, J. E. (1995) Am. J. Physiol., in pressGoogle Scholar, 32.Ikeoka K. Faber J.E. Am. J. Physiol. 1993; 265: H1988-H1995PubMed Google Scholar) and are in agreement with concentrations used by others (cf. Refs. 20, 25, 29, 31 and references therein).Organ CultureTo examine the effects of α1AR stimulation on SMC growth and mRNA expression in cells maintained “in situ” in a state more closely resembling the normal arterial wall environment than cultured SMC monolayers, an organ culture system was devised for the thoracic aorta with intima, media, and adventitia intact. In rat thoracic aorta the media is composed entirely of SMCs, while the adventitia is ≈ 95% fibroblasts(22.Ping P. Faber J.E. Am. J. Physiol. 1993; 265: H1501-H1509Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 33.Ives H.E. Schultz G.S. Galardy R.E. Jamieson J.D. J. Exp. Med. 1978; 148: 1400-1413Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). For each experiment, 25-mm lengths of thoracic aortae (1 per 200 g rat) were dissected under sterile conditions from 16 rats after CO2 asphyxiation and decapitation. Vessels were transferred to 4°C M199, and loose connective and fatty tissue were carefully removed. Eight aortae were randomly assigned to either the control or treated group in each experiment. Individual aortae were suspended horizontally from a stainless-steel wire in serum-free medium. Circumferential wall tension was provided by a second wire connected to an adjustable weight (0.4 g/mm vessel length). This tension was selected to achieve optimal preload based on contractile studies of isolated rat aortic rings. To examine the effect of combined α1AR subtype stimulation, in the first experiment vessels were exposed for 24 h to 10 μM NE, 10 μM ascorbic acid, 0.5 μM rauwolscine, and 1 μM propranolol in a 95% air, 5% CO2 incubator. Control (vehicle) vessels were exposed to these agents but not NE. In a second experiment to examine the effect of endothelial cell presence and of selective α1BAR stimulation on SMC and adventitial growth, both endothelial cell denuded and intact vessels (four groups; n = 3 vessels per group) were compared in an experimental design identical to the preceding one, but in the presence of 0.1 μM 5-MU. In these experiments a smaller number of vessels were studied, because only total RNA, protein RNA, α-actin, and vessel dry weight were measured. Endothelial cells were removed from vessels in 4°C M199 using a nylon wire technique which avoids mechanical damage and proliferative stimulation of the underlying smooth muscle media(34.Reidy M.A. Jackson C. Lindner V. Vasc. Med. Rev. 1992; 3: 156-167Crossref Google Scholar, 35.Fingerle J. Au Y.P. Clowes A.W. Reidy M.A. Arteriosclerosis. 1990; 10: 1082-1087Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We have demonstrated that this technique results in removal of greater than 90% of the endothelial cells.2 In all experiments after 24 h, aortae were incubated in an enzyme solution (Hanks' buffered saline solution (Life Technologies, Inc.), penicillin (100 U/ml), streptomycin (10 μg/ml), 16 mM sodium bicarbonate, 1 mM calcium chloride dihydrate, pH 7.2, 2 mg/ml collagenase, 2 mg/ml soybean trypsin inhibitor, and 13.5 units/ml of elastase (Worthington)) at 37°C with 5% CO2, 95% air− Endothelial cells were then removed or sham-removed in the already denuded group by gently rubbing with a cotton tipped applicator, and the media and adventitia were separated with fine forceps using a dissection microscope and a 4°C tissue bath containing M199. Media and adventitia were washed several times, frozen in liquid nitrogen, powdered, and immediately placed in guanidinium thiocyanate (see below) and stored at −70°C until RNA extraction. Protein was determined for fresh media and adventitia as described below. Dry weights were determined for 5-mm lengths of intact vessels from each group after baking at 60°C for 4 h.RNA and Protein DeterminationTotal cellular RNA was determined (from duplicate plates or vessel extracts) using standard techniques(36.Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (62983) Google Scholar). RNA integrity was assessed, and variations in aliquoted amounts in each RNase protection assay were corrected (see below), according to film densitometry (UMAX UC630 film scanner and the Image Program (National Institutes of Health)) of 28 and 18 S rRNA bands resolved on ethidium bromide-stained, 1 × MOPS/formaldehyde, 1% agarose gels. RNA quantity and purity were determined spectrophotometrically. Total soluble protein was determined in duplicate using a modified (37.Goldschmidt R.C. Kimelberg H.K. Anal. Biochem. 1989; 177: 41-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 38.Akins R.E. Tuan R.S. BioTechniques. 1992; 12: 496-499PubMed Google Scholar) BCA assay (Pierce).Protein SynthesisFour-day, post-confluent SMCs maintained in serum-free media received a change of media containing low methionine (2 mg/liter), 100 μM ascorbate, 1 μM propranolol, and 10-9 to 10-5M NE (duplicate plates for each NE concentration). Eighteen hours later [35S]methionine (5 μCi/ml, 1000 Ci/mmol, Amersham) was added. After 6 h, cells were washed twice with 4°C phosphate-PBS and lifted with 0.05% trypsin-EDTA, which was then stopped with serum-containing M199. Pelleted cells were lysed with Nonidet P-40 at 4°C. The supernatant was treated with trichloroacetic acid at a final concentration of 10% in the presence of 100 μg/ml bovine serum albumen, and incubated for 30 min at 4°C. Trichloroacetic acid-precipitable counts were collected on Whatman GF/C filters and counted in Ecoscint H (National Diagnostics) after overnight shaking at 25°C.mRNA Quantificationα-Actin and β-actin plasmids contained, respectively, 191 and 526 base pairs (bp) of the 3′-untranslated region of the cDNA sequences. The 117-bp NcoI/BamHI fragment that encodes the third intracellular loop of the α1DAR was subcloned into pGEM-4Z (Promega). The 306-bp BamHI/PstI fragment that encodes the fourth and fifth transmembrane-spanning regions of the α1BAR was subcloned into pGEM-3Z. Identity and orientation of inserts was assessed by restriction enzyme analysis and sequencing. RNase protection assays (RPAs) were used to quantitate mRNA levels. In vitro transcribed [35P]rCTP-labeled cRNAs (riboprobes) and cold sense RNAs were made according to standard procedures. Each assay consisted of addition of a constant amount of a single labeled probe and total cell RNA corresponding to an equal number of cells or vessel length for control versus treatment groups (instead of constant amounts of RNA) to account for any treatment effects on cell size and number. Because total RNA per cell varied according to treatment groups (i.e. from hypertrophy), it was not appropriate to load a constant amount of cell RNA. Companion samples run beforehand on ethidium bromide gels for quantitation of 28 and 18 S rRNA (see above) were used to correct for variations in acutal versus expected amounts of cell RNA loaded. tRNA was added to bring each assay up to a constant amount of total RNA. Known amounts of sense RNA were similarly treated in each RPA to ensure molar excess of probe. Hybridization was performed at 57°C for 16 h and RNase digestions at 37°C for 30 min (α1D, α1B, and β-actin: RNase A (20 mg/ml, Boehringer Mannheim) + RNaseT1 (250 units/ml, Boehringer Mannheim); α-actin: RNase ONE (35 units/ml, Promega)). RNA hybrids were resolved on an 8 M urea, 6% polyacrylamide, 1 × TBE (Tris-borate-EDTA) gel. Dried gels were exposed to film (X-Omat, Kodak) with intensifying screens at −70°C for 3-96 h. Densitometry was performed as described above.Specificity of RPAsRiboprobes were tested for specificity using total RNA from liver, kidney, fresh aorta medial and adventitial layers, and cultured medial SMCs and also with homologous and heterologous sense RNAs for α1AR subtypes and actins. In agreement with polymerase chain reaction data (22.Ping P. Faber J.E. Am. J. Physiol. 1993; 265: H1501-H1509Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and using up to 100 μg of RNA, the α1D riboprobe only detected mRNA in the aortic medial layer, adventitia, cultured SMCs, and kidney; the α1B probe only detected mRNA in the medial layer, cultured SMCs, liver, and kidney; the α-actin probe detected mRNA only in the medial layer of the aorta and cultured SMCs, and the β-actin probe detected mRNA in all of these tissues and cells. No cross-reactivity was found among riboprobes and heterologous sense RNAs for expected protected fragments.Analysis and StatisticsTotal RNA, protein, and mRNA species were determined on a per cell (SMC cultures) or per millimeter of vessel length (organ culture) basis for NE-treated and time-matched control (vehicle-treated) groups. Data are given as mean ± S.E.; means for groups with n sizes ≥ 3 were analyzed using t tests and analysis of variance, followed by Dunnett's test or the Bonferroni correction for multiple comparisons. A value of p < 0.05 was considered significant. n sizes represent the number of experimental replicates, each obtained from a separate cell culture line or group of pooled aortae maintained in organ culture.RESULTSEffect of Combined α1AR Subtype Stimulation on Aorta SMCsCombined stimulation of aorta SMC α1ARs with 1 μM NE in the presence of α2AR and βAR blockade did not induce cell proliferation or change cell viability (trypan blue exclusion) (Fig. 1). In both control (vehicle-treated), NE and NE + prazosin groups, viability averaged 97 ± 0.8% (data not shown). Total cell protein and RNA at 0 h in the control group were 713 ± 49 pg/cell and 24 ± 5 pg/cell, respectively, and were unchanged in the NE and NE + prazosin groups. Combined α1AR stimulation significantly increased cell RNA to 140 ± 13% of control (p = 0.03) at 48 h and increased cell protein to 167 ± 11% (p = 0.004) at 24 h and to 216 ± 40% (p = 0.008) at 48 h (Fig. 1). These increases were prevented by the α1 antagonist prazosin (Fig. 1). Because cells in defined, serum-free medium (n = 3) exhibited responses for this same protocol that did not differ significantly from cells in the presence of serum (n = 3), the data were combined (Fig. 1).This growth effect of combined α1AR subtype stimulation was further characterized by examining α-actin and β-actin mRNA. α1AR stimulation had no effect on levels of α- or β-actin mRNA, although α-actin tended to increase at the 24-h point (240% of control, p = 0.08) (Fig. 2). In contrast, in the presence of prazosin at the 8-, 24-, and 48-h points, mRNA (in percent of time 0) for α-actin was 85 ± 25, 70 ± 5, and 110 ± 22, respectively, and for β-actin was 92 ± 4, 95 ± 5, and 95 ± 18, respectively. α1BAR mRNA transiently decreased by 42 ± 12% of control (p = 0.01) at 8 h in serum-containing and by 38 ± 14% (p = 0.02) in serum-free medium and returned to control by 24 h in both groups (Fig. 2, data combined). In contrast, α1D mRNA evidenced no significant change. In the presence of prazosin, α1D and α1B mRNAs were not significantly different from those for control cells whose levels themselves did not change significantly over the 48-h interval. In the presence of NE plus prazosin at the 8-, 24-, and 48-h points, mRNA (in percent of time 0) for α1D was 107 ± 6, 100 ± 1, and 117 ± 20, respectively, and for α1B was 88 ± 30, 86 ± 10, and 119 ± 33, respectively. The observation that β-actin mRNA remained constant while total per cell RNA increased provides an internal standard that validates as specific the changes in α1B and α-actin mRNA.Figure 2:Combined stimulation of α1-adrenoreceptor subtypes decreased α1B and increased α-actin mRNA without altering α1D-adrenoreceptor and β-actin mRNA in aortic SMCs. Left panels, total RNA from 3 × 106 cells exposed to 8 and 24 h of NE ± vehicle (V; ascorbate, rauwolscine, and propranolol) was assayed for α1D and α1B mRNA using ribonuclease protection assay (RPA).

There were no significant changes in viable cell number (0 h = 1.7 × 106± 0.2 cells/plate), total protein (0 h = 1028 ± 141 pg/cell), total RNA (0 h = 14.1 ± 2.8 pg/cell), or in α1B, α1D, α-actin, or β-actin mRNA levels at 8 and 24 h for any group.Selective Stimulation of Aorta SMC α1-Adrenoreceptor SubtypesTo determine the influence of stimulation of α1AR subtypes on aorta SMC growth, cells maintained in serum-free medium were treated for 8 and 24 h with 10 μM NE alone (combined α1AR stimulation), NE plus the competitive α1A/D antagonist 5-MU (0.3 μM), or NE after pretreatment with the irreversible α1B antagonist CEC (30 μM).

https://openalex.org/W2122745978,"Using a bovine 61-kDa (PDE1A2) calmodulin-stimulated phosphodiesterase (CaM-PDE) cDNA and a bovine lung 59-kDa (PDE1A1) CaM-PDE cDNA reported here, we have identified two new regions within the primary structure of these two related isozymes that are important for regulation by Ca2+/CaM. PDE1A1 is identical to the PDE1A2 isozyme except for the amino-terminal 18 residues. In agreement with earlier studies, the CaM concentration required for half-maximal activation (KCaM) of recombinant PDE1A1 (0.3 nM) was ≈10-fold less than the KCaM for recombinant PDE1A2 (4 nM). A series of deletion mutations of the PDE1A2 cDNA removing nucleotide sequence encoding the first 46-106 amino-terminal residues were constructed and expressed using the baculovirus system. Deletion of the amino acids encompassing a previously identified, putative CaM-binding domain (residues 4-46) produced a polypeptide that was still activated 3-fold by CaM (KCaM≈ 3 nM). However, complete CaM-independent activation occurred when residues 4-98 were deleted. To determine the location of the additional CaM-binding domain(s), the inhibitory potency of seven overlapping, synthetic peptides spanning amino acids 76-149 of PDE1A2 was tested using the CaM-activated enzyme. One peptide spanning amino acids 114-137 of PDE1A2 appeared to be the most potent inhibitor of CaM-stimulated activity. These results reveal the existence of a CaM-binding domain located approximately 90 residues carboxyl-terminal to the putative CaM-binding domains previously identified within the PDE1A1 and PDE1A2 isozymes. Moreover, a discrete segment important for holding these CaM-PDEs in a less active state at low Ca2+ concentrations is located between the two CaM-binding domains. Using a bovine 61-kDa (PDE1A2) calmodulin-stimulated phosphodiesterase (CaM-PDE) cDNA and a bovine lung 59-kDa (PDE1A1) CaM-PDE cDNA reported here, we have identified two new regions within the primary structure of these two related isozymes that are important for regulation by Ca2+/CaM. PDE1A1 is identical to the PDE1A2 isozyme except for the amino-terminal 18 residues. In agreement with earlier studies, the CaM concentration required for half-maximal activation (KCaM) of recombinant PDE1A1 (0.3 nM) was ≈10-fold less than the KCaM for recombinant PDE1A2 (4 nM).

Neil S.M. Elion G.B. Hitchings G.H. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1972; 150: 585-599Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar). The enzyme belongs to the family of molybdenum-containing protein like xanthine oxidoreductase (XD) and sulfite oxidase(2.Hille R. Massey V. Spiro T.G. Molybdenum Enzymes. Wiley Interscience, New York1985: 443-518Google Scholar), and it represents a short oxidoreductive chain characterized by four oxidation centers, i.e. two iron-sulfur clusters, a flavin cofactor, and a molybdopterin cofactor (3.Barber M.J. Coughlan M.P. Rajagopalan K.V. Siegel L.M. Biochemistry. 1982; 21: 3561-3568Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). The structure of the molybdopterin cofactor in AO is the same as that of XD and sulfite oxidase, and it is known to be different from that present in other bacterial molybdoproteins(4.Rajagopalan K.V. Johnson J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 10199-10202Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 5.Johnson J.L. Rajagopalan K.V. Meyer O. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1990; 283: 542-545Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Although the primary structure of AO has not yet been elucidated, it is known that AO is a homodimer, consisting of two identical subunits of 150 kDa each (6.Yoshihara S. Tatsumi K. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1985; 242: 213-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). AO is expressed in the liver of various animal species(6.Yoshihara S. Tatsumi K. Arch. Biochem.

Physiol. 1974; 49B: 687-703Google Scholar), although the tissue and cell distribution of the protein has not been studied in detail. The oxidase is considered to be a cytosolic protein; however, in guinea pig, a recent report demonstrates the presence of small amounts of AO in mitochondria(8.Critchley D.J.P. Rance D.J. Beedham C. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1992; 185: 54-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). aldehyde oxidase xanthine oxidoreductase polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis fast protein liquid chromatography rapid amplification of cDNA ends amino acid(s). AO plays an important role in the metabolism of xenobiotics, since it is involved in the reduction of N-oxides, nitrosamines, hydroxamic acids, azo dyes, nitropolycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons(6.Yoshihara S. Tatsumi K. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1985; 242: 213-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar), and sulfoxides(9.Kitamura S. Narai N. Hayashi M. Tatsumi K. Chem. Pharm. Bull. (Tokyo). 1983; 31: 776-779Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the enzyme mediates the oxidative metabolism of certain cancer chemotherapeutic agents such as methotrexate (10.Jacobs S.A. Stoller R.G. Chabner B.A. Johnes D.G. J. Clin. Invest. 1976; 57: 534-538Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar) and 6-methylthiopurine(11.Krenitsky T.A. Neil S.M. Elion G.B. Hitchings G.H. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1972; 150: 585-599Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In spite of its toxicological and pharmacological relevance, it is not known whether AO acts on any endogenous substrate, and the physiological function of the enzyme is still obscure. Recently, AO has been suggested to play an important role in the visual processes, since the enzyme catalyzes the biotransformation of the principal component of the visual pigments, retinaldehyde, to retinoic acid, the active form of vitamin A(12.Huang D.-Y. Ichikawa Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 205: 1278-1283Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Since retinoic acid has pleiotropic effects on various cell types(13.Sporn M.B Roberts A.B. Goodman D.S. The Retinoids: Biology, Chemistry and Medicine. 2nd Ed. Raven Press Ltd., New York1994Google Scholar), it is possible that AO participates in many other physiologically significant processes. Although a monogenic deficiency in human AO is not known, the enzymatic activity is undetectable in the very rare hereditary disease known as combined deficiency of molybdoproteins (14.Johnson J.L. Wadman S.K. Scriver C.R. Baudet A.L. Sly W.S. Valle D. The Metabolic Bases of Inherited Disease. 6th Ed. I. McGraw-Hill Book Co., New York1989: 1463-1475Google Scholar). The pathological condition is characterized by a deficit in the synthesis of the molybdenum cofactor that prevents the assembly of the apo- forms of AO and the other molybdoflavoproteins into the respective holo-enzymes(14.Johnson J.L. Wadman S.K. Scriver C.R. Baudet A.L. Sly W.S. Valle D. The Metabolic Bases of Inherited Disease. 6th Ed. I. McGraw-Hill Book Co., New York1989: 1463-1475Google Scholar). The deficit leads to impairment in the development of the central nervous system, which is accompanied by severe neurologic symptoms(15.Endres W. Shin Y.S. Gunther R. Ibel H. Duran M. Wadman S.K. Eur. J. Pediatr. 1988; 148: 246-249Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). This suggests a possible role for AO in the development or the homeostasis of the brain. In this report, we describe the purification of bovine liver AO, the sequencing of peptides obtained by proteolytic cleavage of the purified protein, and the molecular cloning of the respective cDNA. The deduced primary structure of AO shows a high degree of similarity between this protein and XDs isolated from various animal species. A cDNA probe and a monospecific antibody raised against the purified enzyme were used to study the tissue distribution of bovine AO mRNA and protein. AO enzymatic activity was determined by the spectrophotometric method outlined by Taylor et al.(16.Taylor S.M. Stubley-Beedham C. Stell J.G.P. Biochem. J. 1984; 220: 67-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar), which monitors the increase in absorbance at 322 nm caused by the production of 6-phenantridone from phenantridine in aerobic conditions at 25°C(17.Johnson C. Stubley-Beedham C. Stell J.G.P. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1984; 33: 3699-3705Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). One unit of enzyme activity was defined as 1 nmol of 6-phenantridone produced/min. Total XD activity was measured by the method of Stirpe and Della Corte (18.Stirpe F. Della Corte E. J. Biol. Chem. 1969; 244: 3855-3863Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), as modified by Carpani et al.(19.Carpani G. Racchi M. Ghezzi P. Terao M. Garattini E. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1990; 279: 237-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). One unit of XD enzyme activity was defined as 1 nmol of uric acid produced/min in aerobic conditions and in the presence of NAD+ as a cofactor. Proteins were measured according to the Bradford method using a commercially available kit (Bio-Rad). Freshly isolated bovine liver (300 g) obtained from a local abattoir was homogenized in 600 ml of 0.15 M KCl containing 0.1 mM EDTA, then centrifuged at 15,000 × g for 60 min at 4°C. AO was precipitated from the resulting supernatant by addition of ammonium sulfate to 40% saturation. The protein pellet was resuspended in 200 ml of 50 mM Tris/HCl, pH 7.4, containing 0.1 mM EDTA. Following overnight dialysis against 5 liters of the Tris buffer, the AO-containing solution was heated at 60°C for 10 min. The clear supernatant, obtained following centrifugation at 15,000 × g for 20 min, was chromatographed on a Fast-Q anion exchange column (2.5 × 35 cm) (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.), equilibrated in 50 mM Tris/HCl, pH 7.4, and run at a flow rate of 2 ml/min. AO activity was recovered in six fractions (total volume of 18 ml) following elution with a linear gradient of NaCl (0-350 mM) superimposed to the equilibration buffer. Fractions containing the active enzyme were pooled and concentrated by precipitation following addition of ammonium sulfate to 80% saturation. The AO-containing pellet was resuspended in 5 ml of 100 mM glycine buffer, pH 9.0, containing 100 mM NaCl and loaded on a Sephacryl S-300 gel permeation column (2.5 × 90 cm) (Pharmacia) equilibrated in the glycine buffer and run at a flow rate of 2 ml/min. The enzyme with an apparent molecular mass of 300 kDa was eluted in 14 fractions of 3 ml each. Active fractions were pooled and loaded on a benzamidine-Sepharose 6B column (1.5 × 15 cm) (Pharmacia) equilibrated in glycine buffer. Following extensive washing with equilibration buffer, AO was eluted (in three fractions of 3 ml each) with 6 mM benzamidine in glycine buffer. Sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) was performed under reducing conditions according to standard procedure(20.Maniatis T. Fritsch E.F. Sambrook J. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Proteins were stained with silver nitrate using a commercially available kit (Bio-Rad). The highly purified AO preparation (2.5 mg) obtained following chromatography on benzamidine-Sepharose 6B (Pharmacia) was subjected to buffer exchange into 0.1 mM CaCl2, 100 mM ammonium bicarbonate, pH 8.0, by three rounds of concentration and dilution using a Centricon 30 apparatus (Amicon, Danvers, MA). β-Mercaptoethanol (2.5 μl) was added to 150 μg of AO in 50 μl of buffer. The solution was bubbled with N2 and incubated for 18 h at room temperature. Following elimination of the reducing agent by three rounds of concentration and dilution, AO was cleaved with either 1 μg of L-1-tosylamido-2-phenylethyl chloromethyl ketone-treated bovine pancreas trypsin (Sigma) at 37°C for 18 h or with 500 μg of cyanogen bromide (Sigma) at room temperature for 24 h. Tryptic or cyanogen bromide peptides were separated by one or two passages on a PEP-RPC FPLC column (Pharmacia) using appropriate linear gradients of acetonitrile in 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid. Six peptides were subjected to amino-terminal sequencing by the automated Edman degradation using a Milligen model 6625 automated protein sequencer (Milligen, Bedford, MA). The anti-AO polyclonal antibody was obtained from rabbits immunized with the same highly purified preparation of bovine AO shown in Fig. 1, following injection of the antigen into the popliteal lymph nodes of the animals. For Western blot analysis, freshly isolated bovine organs were homogenized in 10 volumes of 50 mM Tris/HCl buffer containing EDTA (0.1 mM), phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (0.1 mM), leupeptin (1 mM), and aprotinin (0.15 μM) and the homogenates were ultracentrifuged at 100,000 × g for 1 h. Cytosolic supernatants were heated at 60°C for 10 min, briefly centrifuged to eliminate the protein precipitate, resuspended in SDS-PAGE buffer, and subjected to Western blot analysis(21.Kurosaki M. Li Calzi M. Scanziani E. Garattini E. Terao M. Biochem. J. 1995; 306: 225-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). In the case of samples used for the determination of anti-AO antibody specificity, Western blot analysis was also performed on fractions obtained from Mono-Q chromatography (Pharmacia). Electro-transfer onto nitrocellulose membranes (Schleicher & Schuell, Dassel, Germany) was as already described(8.Critchley D.J.P. Rance D.J. Beedham C. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1992; 185: 54-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Membranes were sequentially incubated with a 1-3,000 dilution of the rabbit anti-AO antiserum followed by a 1-3,000 dilution of goat anti-rabbit IgG secondary antibody linked to horse-radish peroxidase (Bio-Rad) in standard conditions(20.Maniatis T. Fritsch E.F. Sambrook J. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). AO specific bands were visualized by autoradiography on X-Omat films (Eastman Kodak Co.), using a commercially available kit (ECL, Amersham, Little Chalfont, United Kingdom). On the basis of the sequence data obtained from the AO tryptic and cyanogen bromide-generated peptides, the following oligonucleotide mixtures, containing inosines (I) in positions where a degeneracy of 4 nucleotides is possible, were synthesized. 1: 5′-TT(C/T)(A/T)(C/G)IGA(A/G)GA(A/G)GA(A/G)TT(C/T)(C/T)T-3′ 2: 5′-TA(C/T)CA(A/G)AA(C/T)GCIGA(C/T)(C/T)TIAA-3′ 3: 5′-TT(C/T)GA(A/G)GA(A/G)GGIAA(C/T)GA(A/G)AC-3′ 1′: 5′-A(A/G)(A/G)AA(C/T)TC(C/T)TCC/TTCI(C/G)(A/T)(A/G)AA-3′ 2′: 5′-TTIA(A/G)(A/G)TCIGC(A/G)TT(C/T)TG(A/G)TA-3′ 3′: 5′-GT(C/T)TC(A/G)TTICC(C/T)TC(C/T)TC(A/G)AA-3′ Oligonucleotide mixtures 1-3 correspond to possible sequences coding for the peptides H2N-Phe-Ser-Glu-Glu-Glu-Phe-Leu-COOH, H2N-Tyr-Gln-Asn-Ala-Asp-Leu-Lys-COOH and H2N-Phe-Glu-Glu-Gly-Asn-Glu-Thr-COOH, respectively, whereas oligonucleotide mixtures 1′-3' correspond to the respective complementary sequences. RNA was extracted from bovine liver, and the poly(A)+ fraction was selected according to standard procedures(20.Maniatis T. Fritsch E.F. Sambrook J. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Polymerase chain reaction amplifications were carried out using poly (A)+ RNA following reverse transcription with the Gene-AMP kit (Perkin Elmer) according to the recommended protocol. The samples were subjected to 35 cycles of amplification (94°C for 1 min, 50°C for 2 min, and 72°C for 3 min). The 1.1-kilobase pair cDNA band, obtained following amplification in the presence of the two oligonucleotide mixtures 3 and 2′, was subcloned (bAO1) in the plasmid vector pCR(TM) using the T/A cloning kit (Invitrogen, San Diego, CA) following the recommended protocol. The AO insert was sequenced in both directions by the dideoxynucleotide-chain termination method(22.Sanger F. Nicklen S. Coulsen A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 5463-5467Crossref PubMed Scopus (52055) Google Scholar), using double-stranded DNA as templates and T7 DNA polymerase (Pharmacia) according to the instruction of the manufacturer. Nucleotide sequencing of bAO1 demonstrated that the cDNA was a bona fide copy of part of the AO transcript, since it showed an uninterrupted open reading frame, which encodes amino acid sequences that match all the sequences of the tryptic and cyanogen bromide peptides determined. The clone bAO1 was labeled with [32P]dCTP and used to screen a random-primed bovine liver cDNA library constructed in the phage vector λgt10 from bovine liver poly(A)+ RNA according to standard procedures(20.Maniatis T. Fritsch E.F. Sambrook J. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Screening of the library with bAO1 and subsequently isolated cDNA clones as hybridization probes resulted in the isolation of overlapping cDNA fragments, which were subcloned in pBluescript (bAO2, bAO3 and bAO4). Screening of an oligo(dT)-primed library constructed in λgt10 with the use of bAO4 as a probe resulted in the isolation of two hybridizing phages whose inserts were subcloned in pBluescript (bAO5 and bAO6). Since neither insert contained a polyadenylation signal and a corresponding poly(A)+ tail, the sequence of the most 3′ portion of the AO cDNA (bAO7) was isolated with the use of a commercially available 3′-RACE kit (Clontech, Palo Alto, CA) using an appropriate synthetic oligonucleotide as a primer (5′-CATAAGAACATCAGAACAGACA-3') obtained from clone bAO5. The most 5′ region of the cDNA (bAO8) was isolated with a commercially available 5′-RACE kit (Clontech) with the oligonucleotide 5′-CTCGGGAGGAAATATCAGCTCTTGAGTTGGATCCA-3' synthesized on the basis of the nucleotide sequence of clone bAO1. Hybridization and washing of the plaque lifts obtained from the random-primed and oligo(dT)-primed libraries was performed in stringent conditions according to standard protocols(20.Maniatis T. Fritsch E.F. Sambrook J. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Each clone was sequenced in both directions using either vector primers or specific oligonucleotides synthesized based on the information obtained from former sequence analysis. Oligonucleotides were synthesized on an Applied Biosystems oligonucleotide synthesizer (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). Computer analysis of the DNA sequences was performed with the Genwork software package (IntelliGenetics, Mountain View, CA). Northern blot analysis was performed according to standard conditions(20.Maniatis T. Fritsch E.F. Sambrook J. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar), using 32P-radiolabeled bAO1 cDNA as a probe. Typical results for the purification of AO from bovine liver are illustrated in Table 1. Following the various purification steps, the yield of active enzyme is between 3 and 5% of the amount originally present in the homogenate (as determined by three independent purifications) and this corresponds to approximately 0.8 mg of pure AO/100 g of tissue. Enrichment of AO following each purification step is indicated by an increase in the specific activity of the enzyme. The final specific activity of pure AO is around 1,800 units/mg protein (three experiments), which is similar to that of highly purified enzyme preparations obtained from other sources(23.Stell J.G.P. Warne A.J. Lee-Wolley C. J. Chromatogr. 1989; 475: 363-372Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Pure bovine AO has an apparent molecular mass of 300 kDa, as assessed by size-exclusion chromatography, and it shows an absorption maximum at 450 nm, typical of flavoproteins. The isoelectric point of AO is 4.6, as determined by chromatofocusing on a Mono-P column (Pharmacia). As illustrated in Fig. 1, the denatured and reduced protein consists of a single 150-kDa protein band, which corresponds to the monomeric subunit of the homodimeric active enzyme. Sequencing of the amino terminus of the AO protein was attempted on three independent highly purified AO preparations with negative results. This suggests that the amino-terminal amino acid of AO was blocked as a result of unknown post-translational modifications, which are either physiological or the result of the purification procedure.Tabled 1 Open table in a new tab Partial sequence information on AO was obtained from protein subjected to cleavage with trypsin and cyanogen bromide. Both digestions resulted in the production of many peptides, which were separated by reverse phase chromatography. Six of the quantitatively most prominent peptides were sequenced, allowing the molecular cloning of overlapping cDNA fragments corresponding to the bovine liver AO mRNA. The structure of the various clones along with a partial physical map of the bovine liver AO cDNA is shown in Fig. 2. As documented in Fig. 3, the AO cDNA consists of a 102-nucleotide 5′-untranslated region, followed by a 4017-nucleotide open reading frame and a 511-nucleotide 3′-untranslated sequence. A single polyadenylation signal (AATAAA), located 23-28 nucleotides upstream of the poly(A) tail, is evident. The AO cDNA is the copy of a full-length transcript, as indicated by the sequence of several independent clones obtained by 5′- and 3′-RACE experiments, which never went beyond the sequence determined for bAO8 and bAO7, respectively. The open reading frame of the cDNA predicts a protein of 1339 amino acids with a calculated molecular weight of 147,441. This is in line with the molecular mass of the enzyme monomeric subunit obtained by SDS-PAGE in reducing conditions (see Fig. 1). The assignment of the first coding amino acid to the first in-frame methionine is presumptive, owing to the lack of amino-terminal sequence data on the protein. However, the codon for the putative first methionine is within the context of sequences that are very often found around the translation initiation site on a variety of proteins(24.Kozak M. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 108: 229-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (2780) Google Scholar). The open reading frame of the cDNA predicts a translation product that contains the sequence of the six peptides obtained by tryptic or cyanogen bromide cleavage of the AO protein. The AO transcript is devoid of a nucleotide sequence coding for a hydrophobic signal peptide, which is consistent with the generally accepted cytoplasmic localization of the AO protein. Near the amino- and the carboxyl-terminal regions of the putative translation product, two consensus sequences for the binding of NAD (aa 42-47 and 1268-1273) are observed. As AO does not require the cofactor for its catalytic activity, it is unlikely that these structural elements have functional significance. Between amino acid residues 44 and 74, the fingerprint of an Fe-S center is evident and is of the same type observed in a number of ferredoxin proteins, in bacterial fumarate reductase, and in eukaryotic succinic dehydrogenase(25.Bairoch A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 2241-2245Crossref PubMed Scopus (515) Google Scholar, 26.Rypniewsky W.R. Breiter D.R. Benning M.M. Wesenberg G. Oh B.-H. Markley J.L. Rayment I. Holden H.M.

Two tyrosine kinase recognition sequences are observed between amino acids 535 and 542 and between 958 and 965; however, it remains to be established whether the two sites are really phosphorylated in vivo by tyrosine kinases and whether this has any relevance for the catalytic activity of AO. Between amino acids 829 and 863, AO contains a sequence that conforms to the consensus for the molybdenum cofactor binding site (27.Glatigny A. Scazzocchio C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 3534-3550Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Although AO is a flavoprotein, a FAD binding consensus sequence of the type described by Correll et al. (28.Correll C.C. Ludwig M.L. Bruns C.M. Karplus P.A. Protein Sci. 1993; 2: 2112-2133Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar) cannot be determined. Nevertheless, the flavin nucleotide binding site of the oxidase must be near the molybdenum cofactor center, by analogy with what reported for the related (see below) molybdoflavoprotein XD (27.Glatigny A. Scazzocchio C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 3534-3550Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). A search in the Swiss-Prot and EMBL data banks demonstrates that the amino acid sequence derived from the bAO cDNA has a significant level of similarity with that of XDs from various sources. The overall level of identity is 19% to Aspergillus nidulans(27.Glatigny A. Scazzocchio C. J. Biol.

This is interesting, given the fact that AO and XD are both homodimeric molybdoflavoproteins, have a very similar molecular weight, contain two Fe-S centers/subunit(1.Krenitsky T.A. Neil S.M. Elion G.B. Hitchings G.H. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1972; 150: 585-599Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar, 6.Yoshihara S. Tatsumi K. Arch. Biochem.

Pharmacol. 1990; 39: 1213-1221Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 4, bAO can be easily aligned with all the known XDs along the whole length of the protein. However, two large regions show a particularly high degree of identity. The first region is located at the amino terminus of bAO and corresponds to the amino-terminal XD domain containing the two Fe-S centers (aa 5-170). In this region, we observe a cluster of 16 cysteine residues. Thirteen of these cysteines are conserved in both AO and XDs, and 8 of them must contribute to the structure of the two Fe-S centers. As already discussed in the preceding section, in bAO, cysteine residues 44, 49, 52, and 74 are likely to be part of the first Fe-S cluster. By analogy with what is proposed for XDs(27.Glatigny A. Scazzocchio C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 3534-3550Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar), two other amino-terminal cysteines (aa 114 and 117) are probably involved in the formation of the second Fe-S center present in AO, since they are conserved in the two classes of molybdoflavoproteins. It is unlikely that the cysteine at position 79 of the bovine AO sequence is critical for the formation of the second Fe-S redox center, since an analogous cysteine residue is not observed in the very recently cloned A. nidulans XD(27.Glatigny A. Scazzocchio C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 3534-3550Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). By contrast, we propose that one (or both) of the two cysteines (aa 149 and 151) located in a strictly conserved stretch of amino acids are involved in chelating iron in AO and consequently in XD. Another region with a particularly high level of convergence between bAO and XDs is near the carboxyl terminus from amino acid 1172 to am"

Expression of the cDNA in Escherichia coli and the in vitro translation products of the cDNA yielded a recombinant protein that migrated in SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis at 180 kDa. This protein was immunoprecipitated by the human anti-Golgi serum and by immune rabbit serum but not by normal human serum or preimmune rabbit serum. Western blot analysis showed that the prototype human and immune rabbit sera recognized a 245-kDa protein, suggesting that the isolated clone contained a partial cDNA. The 5′-upstream sequence obtained by the rapid amplification of cDNA ends methodology using human placental cDNA and the combined HeLa cDNA contained 6965 base pairs and encoded a protein of 245 kDa and, like other Golgi autoantigens described earlier, is highly rich in coiled-coils. The deduced amino acid sequence included the decapeptide ESLALEELEL, which was identified as one of two signature sequences previously reported in a family of peptide hormones and neuropeptides known as “granins.” This is the first report of a Golgi complex autoantigen that bears structural similarities to the granin family of proteins.

Human autoantibodies have proven to be valuable reagents in the identification and characterization of a number of intracellular macromolecules(1.von Muhlen C.A. Tan E.M. Semin. Arthritis Rheum. 1995; 24: 323-358Crossref PubMed Scopus (551) Google Scholar). Recently, human autoantibodies have been used to characterize and identify several Golgi complex proteins including golgins-95 and −160 (2.Fritzler M.J. Hamel J.C. Ochs R.L. Chan E.K.L. J. Exp. Med. 1993; 178: 49-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar) and giantin(3.Lindstedt A.D. Hauri H.P. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1993; 4: 679-693Crossref PubMed Scopus (352) Google Scholar, 4.Seelig H.P.

Macrogolgin was reported to be a new Golgi autoantigen(5.Seelig H.P. Schranz P. Schroter H. Wiemann C. Renz M. J. Autoimmun. 1994; 7: 67-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar), but subsequent studies noted that macrogolgin was identical to giantin(4.Seelig H.P. Schranz P. Schroter H. Wiemann C.

In the present study, we used the serum from a Sjögren's syndrome patient to isolate a cDNA clone encoding a novel Golgi complex protein, which we have designated golgin-245. Its amino acid sequence revealed the presence of multiple coiled-coil motifs, a sequence signature characteristic of a family of proteins known as granins, and sequence similarity to the heavy chain of myosin. The prototype serum was from a patient (FG) with idiopathic diffuse proliferative glomerulonephritis, renal failure requiring dialysis, and clinical features of Sjögren's syndrome. The specificity of the autoantibodies for Golgi antigens was first identified on the basis of indirect immunofluorescence (IIF)( (1)The abbreviations used are: IIFindirect immunofluorescencePAGEpolyacrylamide gel electrophoresisRACErapid amplification of cDNA endsRTreverse transcriptasePCRpolymerase chain reactionkbkilobase pair(s)bpbase pair(s)NuMAnuclear mitotic antigen.)

IIF was performed on commercially prepared HEp-2 cell (epithelial cells derived from a human laryngeal carcinoma) substrates (Immuno Concepts Inc., Sacramento) using a fluorescein-conjugated goat anti-human IgG (light and heavy chain) as described previously(2.Fritzler M.J. Hamel J.C. Ochs R.L. Chan E.K.L. J. Exp. Med. 1993; 178: 49-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). A murine monoclonal antibody to the coatomer protein β-COP (Sigma) was used for co-localization studies. Double labeling and co-localization studies employed rhodamine-conjugated goat anti-rabbit or -mouse IgG (Pierce) antisera. Slides were viewed with a Zeiss Universal microscope fitted with a TEC-470 CCD video camera system (Optronics Engineering, Goleta, CA), and images were processed with a SONY color video printer and recorded on SONY type 1010 photography paper. HeLa cells grown in culture flasks were extracted in buffer containing 50 mM Tris, pH 7.6, 150 mM NaCl, 20 mM EDTA, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, and protease inhibitors as described(2.Fritzler M.J. Hamel J.C. Ochs R.L. Chan E.K.L. J. Exp. Med. 1993; 178: 49-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). Proteins or whole cell preparations were solubilized in SDS sample buffer, separated by discontinuous SDS-PAGE, and then transferred to nitrocellulose as described(2.Fritzler M.J. Hamel J.C. Ochs R.L. Chan E.K.L. J. Exp. Med. 1993; 178: 49-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar, 8.Towbin H. Staehelin T. Gordon J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 4350-4354Crossref PubMed Scopus (44644) Google Scholar). After transfer, the nitrocellulose sheets were blocked with 3% nonfat milk in phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.05% Tween 20 (PBST) and again washed with PBST to remove any unbound antibodies. Bound antibodies were traced by using 125I-protein A (2-4 × 105 cpm/ml; ICN Radiochemicals, Irvine, CA) and visualized by exposing the air-dried nitrocellulose to X-Omat AR film (Eastman Kodak Co.). FG serum was used for immunoscreening 5 × 105 recombinants from a HeLa Uni-ZAP XR cDNA library (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA, catalog no. 937216) as described(2.Fritzler M.J. Hamel J.C. Ochs R.L. Chan E.K.L. J. Exp. Med. 1993; 178: 49-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). A clone ACJF521 was isolated and subcloned in vivo into pBluescript plasmid using R408 helper phage as described in the manufacturer's instructions (Stratagene). The nucleotide sequences were determined by using dye terminator sequencing and an automated sequencer from Applied Biosystems Inc. (Foster City, CA). Since ACJF521 was a partial sequence, the RACE methodology was employed to obtain overlapping 5′ clones from human placenta cDNAs (5′ RACE-Ready cDNAs, Clontech)(9.Apte A.N. Siebert P.D. BioTechniques. 1993; 15: 890-893PubMed Google Scholar). DNA sequences were determined in both strands and compiled using Applied Biosystems Inc. software SeqEd. Total cellular RNA was isolated from HeLa cells(10.Chirgwin J.M. Przybyla A.E. MacDonald R.J. Rutter W.J. Biochemistry. 1979; 18: 5294-5299Crossref PubMed Scopus (16610) Google Scholar). Ten μg of total HeLa RNA was fractionated by electrophoresis through 1% agarose containing 2.2 M formaldehyde and transferred to nitrocellulose membrane. The RNA blot was hybridized with 32P-labeled cDNA fragment from clone ACJF521 or 2-14, and blots were washed at 51°C in 0.1 × SSC and 0.1% SDS. Total HeLa RNA was analyzed by RT-PCR to provide independent confirmation that the cDNA clones derived from 5′-RACE were derived from the same mRNA. Three sets of sense and antisense primers were designed, and their positions with respect to the putative full-length cDNA are indicated on Fig. 2a: 42, antisense 5′-GAACAGCGGATCCAGCGGTTGCGAAGAATG and 43 sense, 5′-TTTCTCGAGTTTATTGGCTACATGAGGGGCCCTGAATG; 44, sense 5′-AATGGCCCGATGAATGTTG and 45, antisense 5′-TGATGCGACTACGGAGTTGAG; 46, sense 5′-GTTGGCCCAATTGCAGCAGAAG and 47, antisense 5′-TGAGTTCTCGTCGATGAACCTCAG. RT-PCR was performed using the “one-tube” method as described (11.Pfeffer U. Fecarotta E. Vidali G. BioTechniques. 1995; 18: 204-206PubMed Google Scholar) such that all reactants were added simultaneously, and the PCR steps were programmed to follow immediately after the RT reaction using a thermocycler (Eppendorf Inc., Freemont, CA). The RT reactions were performed at 50°C for 1 h using SuperScript II RNase H-minus reverse transcriptase (Life Technologies, Inc.). For primer pairs 44/45, 46/47, and 44/47, Taq polymerase (Life Technologies, Inc.) was used in PCR for 25 cycles at 54°C for 5 s, 70°C for 2.5 min, and 94°C for 5 s. For primer pair 42/43, the Expand long template PCR system (Boehringer Mannheim) was employed to increase the chance for the expected 6.4-kb amplification product. The PCR was performed using 10 cycles of 58°C for 5 s, 68°C for 7 min, and 94°C for 5 s followed by 15 cycles of 58°C for 5 s, 68°C for 15 min, and 94°C for 5 s. Amplification products were analyzed by electrophoresis using 1.0 or 1.5% agarose gels using standard procedures. Uni-ZAP clone ACJF521 phage plaques were induced to produce recombinant protein with isopropyl-β-D-thiogalactopyranoside (Fisher Scientific)-impregnated nitrocellulose filters, and the filters with the bound recombinant proteins were then used for affinity purification as described previously(2.Fritzler M.J. Hamel J.C. Ochs R.L. Chan E.K.L. J. Exp. Med. 1993; 178: 49-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). One μg of plasmid ACJF521 was used for coupled in vitro transcription and translation (TnT, Promega, Madison, WI) in the presence of T3 RNA polymerase, rabbit reticulocyte lysate, and [35S]methionine (Tran35S-label; ICN). Translation was carried out at 30°C for 1 h followed by SDS-PAGE of a 2-5-μl aliquot to confirm the presence of translation products. Immunoprecipitation of 35S-labeled in vitro translation products was performed using Protein A-Sepharose beads(2.Fritzler M.J. Hamel J.C. Ochs R.L. Chan E.K.L. J. Exp. Med. 1993; 178: 49-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). Plasmids were transformed in Escherichia coli strain XL-1 Blue (Stratagene). The recombinant protein was prepared from 200-ml cultures of the recombinant cells grown to A600 = 0.6 at 37°C and induced with isopropyl-β-D-thiogalactopyranoside added to a final concentration of 10 mM. The bacteria were cultured overnight and harvested by the method of Adams et al.(12.Adam S.A. Nakagawa T. Swanson M.S. Woodruff T.K. Dreyfus G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1986; 6: 2932-2943Crossref PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar). The final pellet of inclusion bodies was washed with 1 M urea in 0.1 M Tris (pH 7.3) on ice for 1 min to remove residual bacterial proteins. The inclusion bodies were then pelleted in an Eppendorf microcentrifuge at 13,000 rpm and extracted with 8 M urea, 0.2%β-mercaptoethanol in 0.1 M Tris buffer for 15 min on ice. After the immunoreactivity of extracted recombinant proteins was confirmed by immunoblotting(2.Fritzler M.J. Hamel J.C. Ochs R.L. Chan E.K.L. J. Exp. Med. 1993; 178: 49-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar), they were used for rabbit immunizations. New Zealand White rabbits were separately immunized by subcutaneous and intramuscular injections of 1.5 mg of extracted recombinant proteins in an equal volume of Freund's complete adjuvant. Two weeks later, the animals were boosted with 2.0 mg of the protein in incomplete Freund's adjuvant. The appearance and titer of Golgi antibodies were monitored by indirect immunofluorescence. Nucleic acid and protein sequences were analyzed by the University of Wisconsin Genetics Computer Group sequence analysis software package version 7.2 for UNIX computers(13.Devereux J. Haeberl P. Smithies O. Nucleic Acids Res. 1984; 12: 387-395Crossref PubMed Scopus (11514) Google Scholar). Comparisons to known sequences were performed by BLAST (14.Altschul S.F. Gish W. Miller W. Myers E.W. Lipman D.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 215: 403-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (68368) Google Scholar) on the Internet server. Secondary structure analysis for coiled-coil motifs was conducted with the software program “COILS”(15.Lupas A. Van Dyke M. Stock J. Science. 1991; 252: 1162-1164Crossref PubMed Scopus (3443) Google Scholar). When serum FG was used to screen 5 × 105 plaques from the HeLa Uni-ZAP cDNA expression library, one clone (ACJF521) was isolated, and the 4.6-kb cDNA insert was subcloned in vivo into pBluescript. In IIF microscopy, affinity-purified antibody from ACJF521 phage plaques showed staining of the Golgi complex (Fig. 1a), which was similar to the staining demonstrated by the whole serum (Fig. 1b) and human antibodies directed against Golgin-160 (Fig. 1c). Affinity-purified antibodies from unrelated phage plaques did not stain any cell structures (data not shown). The staining obtained with the rabbit antibodies to recombinant ACJF521 co-localized to the same cellular structure as the murine monoclonal antibody to β-COP (Fig. 1, d and e, respectively). These findings were in keeping with previous studies that have localized other autoantigens to the Golgi compartment(2.Fritzler M.J. Hamel J.C. Ochs R.L. Chan E.K.L. J. Exp. Med. 1993; 178: 49-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar, 3.Lindstedt A.D. Hauri H.P. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1993; 4: 679-693Crossref PubMed Scopus (352) Google Scholar, 5.Seelig H.P. Schranz P.

Commun. 1994; 205: 1399-1408Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Additional evidence supporting the localization of the reactive antigen to the Golgi complex came from HeLa cells treated with 7.5 μM brefeldin A. These studies demonstrated dramatic loss of staining by the prototype human and rabbit immune sera after 10 min of exposure to the drug and restoration of staining 90 min after removal of the drug (data not shown). The sensitivity of golgin-245 to brefeldin A resembles the rapid disappearance of β-COP(16.Orci L. Tagaya M. Amherdt A. Perrelett A. Donaldson J.G. Lippincott-Schwartz J. Klausner R.D. Rothman J.E. Cell. 1991; 64: 1183-1195Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (352) Google Scholar), golgin-95, and golgin-160 (2.Fritzler M.J. Hamel J.C. Ochs R.L. Chan E.K.L. J. Exp. Med. 1993; 178: 49-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar) after exposure of tissue culture cells to the drug. Sequence analysis of cDNA ACJF521 showed that it was composed of a long coding region followed by a 3′-noncoding region, a poly(A) tail (Fig. 2a), and features suggesting that it was a partial cDNA (also see below). To obtain the complete 5′-cDNA, the 5′-RACE methodology was used. In the first round of 5′-RACE, eight overlapping, independent clones were analyzed with the longest cDNA insert(29-9) containing 1856 bp and represented an open reading frame extending 5′ from the ACJF521 cDNA (Fig. 2). However, clone 29-9 lacked a methionine start site consistent with Kozak's sequence(17.Kozak M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1987; 15: 8125-8148Crossref PubMed Scopus (4148) Google Scholar). A second round of 5′-RACE was initiated with newly designed primers based on the 5′-sequence of 29-9. The sequences of four overlapping independent clones were determined, and the longest cDNA insert(2-14) contained 690 bp with an open reading frame extending 5′ to clone 29-9 (Fig. 2). The combined sequence derived from overlapping clones 2-14, 29-9, and ACJF521 contained a total of 6965 bp (Fig. 2 and 3). The first ATG was found at nucleotide position 50 and is in excellent agreement with Kozak's sequence (17.Kozak M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1987; 15: 8125-8148Crossref PubMed Scopus (4148) Google Scholar) for a methionine initiation codon. Based on the Genetics Computer Group program PEPTIDESORT analysis, the combined sequence encodes a protein of an open reading frame of 2083 amino acids with a predicted molecular mass of 244,527 daltons and a pI of 5.15. In keeping with previous nomenclature (2.Fritzler M.J. Hamel J.C. Ochs R.L. Chan E.K.L. J. Exp. Med. 1993; 178: 49-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar) the recombinant protein encoded by the combined cDNA was named golgin-245. Independent confirmation that the 5′-RACE clones are derived from a single mRNA was obtained by Northern blotting when both 5′-fragment 2-14 and 3′-fragment ACJF521 hybridized to a common band of 7 kb (Fig. 2b), a size consistent with the full-length cDNA sequence reported here. A second independent confirmation was provided from the RT-PCR mapping data (Fig. 2c). The results showed that the 3 pairs of designed primers each deriving from different cDNA fragments produced RT-PCR products consistent with the expected sizes. Taken together, these data showed that the cDNA sequences reported here derived from a single mRNA of approximately 7 kb. The deduced amino acid sequences were used to search the GenBank, EMBL, and NBRF data banks (August 30, 1995) for homologous sequences. Golgin-245 demonstrated 97% identity with a sequence tag (X76942) identified as 72.1 protein containing 149 amino acids. The location of the X76942 sequence in relation to golgin-245 is shown in Fig. 2a. There were no apparent transmembrane, nuclear localization, or other signal motifs. Like golgins-95 and −160, 20% identity of amino acid sequences was found with the myosin heavy chain and several other proteins (CENP-E, CENP-F) that contain coiled-coil domains. Since the regions of similarity are widely spread throughout the sequences of the proteins, it is assumed that they are related to the coiled-coil domain structure. There was no significant sequence similarity with β-adaptin, β-COP, previously reported Golgi complex autoantigens, or other known mammalian Golgi components. It has been previously noted that golgin-95 and golgin-160 also share significant sequence similarity to several cytoskeleton-related proteins including desmin, the 150-kDa dynein-associated protein(18.Holzbaur E.L.F.

Chem. 1989; 264: 16083-16092Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Kinesin, a microtubule-stimulated ATPase(20.Bloom G.S. Wagner M.C. Pfister K.K. Brady S.T. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 3409-3416Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar), has recently been reported to be a motor for microtubule-mediated Golgi-to-endoplasmic reticulum membrane traffic(21.Lippincott-Schwartz J. Cole N.B. Marotta A. Conrad P.A. Bloom G.S. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 128: 293-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). In support of this conclusion, it has been demonstrated that antibodies to kinesin and myosin bind to the Golgi complex(22.Marks D.L. Larkin J.M. McNiven M.A. J. Cell Sci. 1994; 107: 2417-2426Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 23.Fath K.R. Burgess D.R. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 120: 117-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). To extend the comparison, golgin-160 and macrogolgin have sequence similarity to the yeast cytoskeleton-related protein USO1, a yeast protein that is required for protein transport from the endoplasmic reticulum to the Golgi apparatus(24.Nakajima H. Hirata A. Ogawa Y. Yonehara T. Yoda K. Yamasaki M. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 113: 245-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). This evidence suggests that the Golgi complex autoantigens are functionally and structurally related. The decapeptide -ESLALEELEL- (amino acids 388-397; Fig. 3 and 4) was identified as a granins_1 “signature,” which has the consensus pattern [DE]-[SN]-L-[SAN]-X(2)[DE]XEL(25.Simon J. Aunis D. Biochem. J. 1989; 262: 1-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar, 26.Huttner W.B. Gerdes H. Rosa P. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1991; 16: 27-30Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (412) Google Scholar). The granins are a family of acidic proteins present in the secretory granules of a wide variety of endocrine and neuroendocrine cells(25.Simon J. Aunis D. Biochem. J. 1989; 262: 1-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar, 26.Huttner W.B. Gerdes H. Rosa P. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1991; 16: 27-30Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (412) Google Scholar). Two consensus sequences have been reported. The granins_1 signature is located at the carboxyl terminus of the proteins and has been identified in all granin family proteins with the exception of murine secretogranin 2. In contrast, the second signature sequence, granins_2, has been described in only two members of the granins family, chromogranin A and B, and is characterized by two cysteine residues bound together near the amino terminus of the protein. The predicted pI of golgin-245 (5.15) is similar to the pI of granins, which range between 4.9 and 5.6(26.Huttner W.B. Gerdes H. Rosa P. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1991; 16: 27-30Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (412) Google Scholar). The relatively higher content of glutamic acid (17%) compared with aspartic acid (4%) is another feature of golgin-245 that is shared with most granins(26.Huttner W.B. Gerdes H. Rosa P. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1991; 16: 27-30Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (412) Google Scholar). The function of these proteins or these signatures has not been clearly defined, but current evidence suggests that one of their functions is processing or packaging of neuropeptides. The similarities between granins and golgin-245 are remarkable and suggest that they have similar functions.Figure 3:Nucleotide and deduced amino acid sequences of the cDNA clone encoding golgin-245 antigen. Sequencing of both DNA strands was performed with custom synthetic oligonucleotide primers. The open reading frame starts at nucleotide 50 and ends at nucleotide 6298.

This feature is of interest because all Golgi complex autoantigens cloned to date are predominantly coiled-coil structures. Large domains of coiled-coils have also been noted in other autoantigens including the nuclear mitotic antigen (NuMA)(27.Yang C.H. Lambie E.J. Snyder M. J.

Virology. 1991; 16: 2431-2444Google Scholar). These observations suggest that the Golgi complex autoantigens, including golgin-245, may participate in protein-protein interactions. In immunoblotting, recombinant protein from the ACJF521 clone was reactive with the prototype serum, with antibody affinity-purified from the ACJF521 recombinant protein and with immune rabbit serum (data not shown). This was clearly demonstrated by parallel experiments, which used the in vitro translated product derived from the cDNA clone ACJF521 (Fig. 5A). The translation product protein was approximately 180 kDa (lane 1) and was immunoprecipitated by the prototype human serum (lane 3) and immune rabbit sera (lane 4) but not by normal human serum (lane 2) or preimmune rabbit sera (lane 5). Immunoblot analysis of HeLa cell extracts (Fig. 5B) with the rabbit serum directed against golgin-245 (lane 3) and the prototype human serum (lane 4) demonstrated reactivity with a >225-kDa (∼245 kDa) protein whereas the preimmune rabbit serum (lane 1) showed no reactivity. A prototype serum with antibodies directed against the 225-kDa NuMA protein (1.von Muhlen C.A. Tan E.M. Semin.

In this study, we have used the antibodies from a patient with Sjögren's syndrome, a disease characterized by lymphocytic infiltrates and fibrosis of exocrine glands, to clone and characterize a unique Golgi autoantigen. The notion that these autoantigens are part of a unique family of Golgi complex proteins is supported by the observation that they do not have significant sequence homology with other members of Golgi complex family of proteins. The observations that golgin-245 is characterized by coiled-coils, that it has sequence similarities to known motor proteins, and that it contains the granin_1 signature suggest that it is involved in processing of proteins in the Golgi complex.

https://openalex.org/W1969585167,"Many anaerobically functioning eukaryotes have an anaerobic energy metabolism in which fumarate is reduced to succinate. This reduction of fumarate is the opposite reaction to succinate oxidation catalyzed by succinate-ubiquinone oxidoreductase, complex II of the aerobic respiratory chain. Prokaryotes are known to contain two distinct enzyme complexes and distinct quinones, menaquinone and ubiquinone (Q), for the reduction of fumarate and the oxidation of succinate, respectively. Parasitic helminths are also known to contain two different quinones, Q and rhodoquinone (RQ). This report demonstrates that RQ was present in all examined eukaryotes that reduce fumarate during anoxia, not only in parasitic helminths, but also in freshwater snails, mussels, lugworms, and oysters. It was shown that the measured RQ/Q ratio correlated with the importance of fumarate reduction in vivo. This is the first demonstration of the role of RQ in eukaryotes, other than parasitic helminths. Furthermore, throughout the development of the liver fluke Fasciola hepatica, a strong correlation was found between the quinone composition and the type of metabolism: the amount of Q was correlated with the use of the aerobic respiratory chain, and the amount of RQ with the use of fumarate reduction. It can be concluded that RQ is an essential component for fumarate reduction in eukaryotes, in contrast to prokaryotes, which use menaquinone in this process. Analyses of enzyme kinetics, as well as the known differences in primary structures of prokaryotic and eukaryotic complexes that reduce fumarate, support the idea that fumarate-reducing eukaryotes possess an enzyme complex for the reduction of fumarate, structurally related to the succinate dehydrogenase-type complex II, but with the functional characteristics of the prokaryotic fumarate reductases.

Living with hypoxia or even anoxia is an everyday experience for many organisms. Not only many prokaryotes, but many eukaryotic organisms as well can function (temporarily) without oxygen. Parasitic helminths, freshwater snails, and some lower marine organisms are known to be able to survive anaerobic conditions by adaptation of their energy metabolism. In addition to simple fermentation in which glucose is degraded to ethanol or lactate, most of these facultative anaerobic eukaryotes contain another fermentation variant, malate dismutation (Fig. 1). Malate dismutation is found in both strictly and facultative anaerobically functioning prokaryotes as well as in some eukaryotes that are capable of functioning anaerobically, like parasitic helminths(1.Tielens A.G.M. Parasitol. Today. 1994; 10: 346-352Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar), freshwater snails(2.De Zwaan A. Mohamed A.M. Geraerts W.P.M. Neth. J. Zool. 1976; 26: 549-557Crossref Scopus (19) Google Scholar), mussels(3.De Zwaan A. Bryant C. Metazoan Life without Oxygen. Chapman and Hall Ltd., London1991: 186-217Google Scholar), oysters (4.Collicutt J.M. Hochachka P.W. J. Comp.

(Berl.). 1988; 99: 215-222Crossref Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Although several variations of malate dismutation with various end products occur, the use of the production of succinate as an electron sink is universal. The reduction of malate to succinate occurs in two reactions that reverse part of the Krebs cycle, and the reduction of fumarate is the essential NADH-consuming reaction to maintain redox balance. Therefore, the possibility arises that during anoxia, fumarate reduction occurs by reversal of the succinate dehydrogenase (SDH) ( (1)The abbreviations used are: SDHsuccinate dehydrogenaseFRDfumarate reductaseQubiquinoneQ02, 3-dimethoxy-5-methyl-1, 4-benzoquinoneQ7ubiquinone-35Q9ubiquinone-45Q10ubiquinone-50RQrhodoquinoneRQ10rhodoquinone-50HPLChigh pressure liquid chromatography.) already present in the aerobic respiratory chain or else is catalyzed by a fumarate reductase (FRD) specifically synthesized for this function (reviewed in (6.Ohnishi T.

Bacteria contain two distinct enzyme complexes, succinate-ubiquinone oxidoreductase (complex II) and menaquinol-fumarate oxidoreductase (FRD), for oxidizing succinate and reducing fumarate, respectively(7.Ackrell B.A.C. Johnson M.K. Gunsalus R.P. Cecchini G. Muller F. Chemistry and Biochemistry of Flavoenzymes: Structure and Function of Succinate Dehydrogenase and Fumarate Reductase. III. CRC Press, Inc., Boca Raton, FL1992: 229-297Google Scholar), although each enzyme will catalyze both reactions in vitro. These electron-transferring enzyme complexes of fumarate-reducing eukaryotes have not been studied extensively, but it has been shown that Haemonchus contortus possesses two different genes for the B-subunit of complex II that are differentially expressed during the development of this parasite(9.Roos M.H. Tielens A.G.M. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1994; 66: 273-281Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). This differential expression during development was later confirmed for another parasitic worm, Ascaris suum, in which the existence of two different stage-specific forms of complex II was also demonstrated(10.Saruta F.

Parasitic helminths are known to contain two distinct quinones, ubiquinone (Q) and rhodoquinone (RQ), for transport of electrons between the enzyme complexes of the respiratory chain. Free-living aerobic stages of several helminths contain a higher ratio of Q to RQ than parasitic anaerobic stages(11.Allen P.C. Exp. Parasitol. 1973; 34: 211-219Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 12.Takamiya S. Kita K. Wang H. Weinstein P.P. Hiraishi A. Oya H. Aoki T. Biochim. Biophys.

However, evidence for a quantitative correlation between the amount of RQ present and the importance of fumarate reduction in the energy metabolism of parasitic helminths is still lacking. Furthermore, it is still unknown whether RQ is also present in other eukaryotes that reduce fumarate. This report demonstrates that the percentage RQ of the total amount of quinones is correlated with the importance of fumarate reduction in vivo in all examined fumarate-reducing eukaryotes. In addition, during the development of the liver fluke Fasciola hepatica, a clear correlation was observed between the quinone composition and the importance of fumarate reduction in vivo. Therefore, RQ is an essential component for fumarate reduction in eukaryotes, in contrast to prokaryotes, where menaquinone serves this function(15.Wissenbach U. Kröger A. Unden G. Arch. Microbiol. 1990; 154: 60-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar, 16.Wissenbach U. Ternes D. Unden G. Arch. Microbiol. 1992; 158: 68-73Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Catalase, benzyl viologen, 2,3-dimethoxy-5-methyl-1,4-benzoquinone (Q0), Q7, Q9, and Q10 were obtained from Sigma. Glucose oxidase and bovine serum albumin were obtained from Boehringer (Mannheim, Germany). All other chemicals were of analytical grade. The wild-type inbred strain SE (susceptible Edinburgh) of H. contortus was cultured and propagated in our own facilities(9.Roos M.H. Tielens A.G.M. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1994; 66: 273-281Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). F. hepatica metacercariae were obtained from experimentally infected snails (Lymnaea truncatula). The snails were placed in aerated cold tap water to induce shedding of cercariae, which then encysted on cellophane paper. F. hepatica adults were isolated from infected sheep livers obtained at a slaughterhouse. F. hepatica adults were also obtained from male Wistar rats, which were orally infected with 30 metacercariae each. Lymnaea stagnalis and Dictyocaulus viviparus were a generous gift of Dr. M. de Jong-Brink (Faculty of Biology, Free University, Amsterdam) and Dr. M. Eysker (Department of Parasitology and Tropical Veterinary Medicine, Faculty of Veterinary Medicine, Utrecht University, Utrecht, The Netherlands), respectively. Mussels (Mytilus edulis), oysters (Crassostrea angulata), and lugworms (Arenicola marina) were collected at the Dutch coast. Before homogenization, all isolated adult parasites were washed in physiological saline containing 10 mM glucose, 25 mM NaHCO3, and 20 mM Hepes (pH 7.4) at 37°C to remove host material. All tissues were homogenized in 20 mM Hepes (pH 7.4), 150 mM KCl with a Teflon-glass homogenizer. H. contortus L3 larvae and F. hepatica metacercariae were crushed with a pestle in a liquid nitrogen-cooled mortar or crushed with quartz sand in a mortar, respectively, before they were homogenized by an Ultraturrax homogenizer. Mitochondrial fractions were prepared by differential centrifugation. Homogenates from which the cell debris was removed (10 min at 4°C and 600 × g) were centrifuged for 20 min at 4°C and 14,000 × g. The mitochondrial pellet was resuspended in homogenization buffer. Mitochondrial fractions were used in all experiments, except when the available amount of tissue was limited. The results obtained with homogenates and mitochondrial fractions of adult F. hepatica were the same, except for the quinone concentration/mg of protein, which was higher in mitochondrial fractions. To ensure that changes in fumarate reduction activities are not caused by changes in quinone composition, but really reflect changes in the enzyme complex itself, we used the direct assay of fumarate reductase activity with reduced benzyl viologen as electron donor described by Ackrell et al.(17.Ackrell B.A.C. Armstrong F.A. Cochran B. Sucheta A. Yu T. FEBS Lett. 1993; 326: 92-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar), which has been used to distinguish SDH and FRD in prokaryotes. Succinate dehydrogenase activity was determined as described by Hägerhäll et al.(18.Hägerhäll C. Aasa R. Von Wachenfeldt C. Hederstedt L. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 7411-7421Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). The measured activity was corrected for nonspecific reduction of Q0 by performing control assays with malonate instead of succinate. All enzyme assays were performed immediately after fractionation of freshly collected material. Protein was determined by a Lowry method as reported by Bensadoun and Weinstein (19.Bensadoun A. Weinstein D. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 70: 241-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (2738) Google Scholar) using bovine serum albumin as a standard. Quinones were extracted from lyophilized homogenates or lyophilized mitochondrial preparations according to Zhu et al.(20.Zhu Q.S. Berden J.A. De Vries S. Slater E.C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1982; 680: 69-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Lyophilized samples were crushed into powder before extraction with pentane. Four subsequent extractions were performed each time using five times as much pentane as the wet weight of the sample (v/w). During the third extraction, the sample was sonicated three times for 15 s on ice. Extracts were pooled, evaporated to dryness, and dissolved in ethanol, after which they were kept in the dark until HPLC analysis. Quinones were separated according to the HPLC method of Takamiya et al.(12.Takamiya S. Kita K. Wang H. Weinstein P.P. Hiraishi A. Oya H. Aoki T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1141: 65-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar) using a reversed-phase RP18 HPLC column (Ligosphere 100, 5 μm, end-capped, 4 × 250 mm; Merck, Darmstadt, Germany). The quinones were eluted using a linear gradient from 15 to 21% diisopropyl ether in methanol (v/v) in 24 min. The eluted quinones were identified by comparing their retention times with Q7, Q9, and Q10 standards and purified RQ10 of F. hepatica. In addition, RQ10 of F. hepatica was identified as RQ10 by mass spectrometry analysis. RQ of the other examined species demonstrated four characteristics identical to RQ of F. hepatica: (i) the retention time on reversed-phase HPLC; (ii) the retention value on TLC(21.Powls R. Hemming F.W. Phytochemistry (Oxf.). 1966; 5: 1235-1255Crossref Scopus (16) Google Scholar); (iii) the oxidized and reduced (by potassium borohydride) absorption spectra (230-600 nm), which were recorded using a split-beam spectrophotometer (Aminco DW2A); and (iv) a purple color in concentrated ethanol solution instead of the yellow color of ubiquinones. The quinones were spectrophotometrically quantified at 275 nm (RQ10E1cm1% = 126.8 (21.Powls R. Hemming F.W. Phytochemistry (Oxf.). 1966; 5: 1235-1255Crossref Scopus (16) Google Scholar) and Q10E1cm1% = 165 (22.Crane F.L. Barr R. Methods Enzymol. 1970; 18c: 137-165Google Scholar)). Q7 was used as an internal standard and was added to each homogenate or mitochondrial fraction (followed by gentle sonication, three times for 10 s) before the samples were lyophilized. Quinone amounts were corrected for the recovery of the Q7 internal standard (between 55 and 90% for all samples). The electron transport chains of many bacteria employ menaquinone when fumarate is the final electron acceptor(15.Wissenbach U. Kröger A. Unden G. Arch.

In parasitic helminths, which also utilize fumarate as final electron acceptor during anoxia, Allen (11.Allen P.C. Exp. Parasitol. 1973; 34: 211-219Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar) demonstrated, however, the presence of RQ. Since RQ is present mainly in anaerobic, fumarate-reducing stages of parasitic helminths, it was suggested that rhodoquinol functions as electron donor in fumarate reduction, similar to menaquinol in fumarate reduction in other organisms(11.Allen P.C. Exp. Parasitol. 1973; 34: 211-219Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). It is unknown whether RQ occurs only in parasitic helminths or is present in other fumarate-reducing eukaryotes as well, which would imply an important difference between prokaryotic and eukaryotic fumarate reduction(8.Van Hellemond J.J. Tielens A.G.M. Biochem. J. 1994; 304: 321-331Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). All examined mitochondria from eukaryotes contain Krebs cycle activity and a respiratory chain. All these mitochondria contained Q (Table 1), which is an essential component of the aerobic respiratory chain. The amounts of Q present in bovine and rat heart mitochondria (Table 1) were in accordance with other reports(26.Lenaz G. Battino M. Castelluccio C. Fato R. Cavazzoni M. Rauchova H. Bovina C. Formiggini G. Parenti Castelli G. Free Radical Res. Commun. 1990; 8: 317-327Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 27.Takahashi T. Okamoto T. Mori K. Sayo H. Kishi T.

The observed amounts of total quinones in the examined parasitic helminths were comparable to the amounts of quinone in A. suum and Paragonimus westermani, two other parasitic helminths(12.Takamiya S. Kita K. Wang H. Weinstein P.P. Hiraishi A. Oya H. Aoki T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1141: 65-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 13.Takamiya S. Wang H. Hiraishi A. Yu Y. Hamajima F. Aoki T. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1994; 312: 142-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). The amounts of Q in the abductor muscles of M. edulis and C. angulata were lower than those in parasitic helminths.Tabled 1 Open table in a new tab All examined organisms contained quinones with 9 or 10 isoprenoid units (Table 1), which is consistent with the findings in other eukaryotes. The molecular basis that causes the differences in quinone chain length, as well as possible functional differences, is not resolved yet. The mitochondria from rat or bovine heart, which are strictly aerobic and possess complex II functioning in vivo in the direction of succinate oxidation, contained only Q and no RQ (Table 1). On the other hand, RQ was present not only in the investigated parasitic helminths, but also in all examined eukaryotes that reduce fumarate under anaerobic conditions in vivo, like the marine organisms M. edulis, C. angulata, and A. marina and the snail L. stagnalis (Table 1). In lower unicellular eukaryotes that reduce fumarate during anoxia, like Euglena gracilis(29.Schneider T. Betz A. Planta (Heidelb.). 1985; 166: 67-73Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar), RQ was found(21.Powls R. Hemming F.W. Phytochemistry (Oxf.). 1966; 5: 1235-1255Crossref Scopus (16) Google Scholar), whereas in those unicellular species that do not reduce fumarate during anoxia, like rumen protozoa from cattle(30.Williams A.G. Coombs G. North M. Biochemical Protozoology. Taylor & Francis Ltd., London1991: 61-80Google Scholar), no RQ could be detected. ( (2)J. J. Van Hellemond and A. G. M. Tielens, unpublished observations.) These results demonstrate a general and essential function of RQ in fumarate reduction in eukaryotes, in contrast to prokaryotes, which use menaquinone in fumarate reduction. Interestingly, fumarate-reducing members of the family of Rhodospirillaceae, which are purple non-sulfur bacteria, contain RQ as well(31.Hiraishi A. Arch. Microbiol. 1988; 150: 56-60Crossref Scopus (29) Google Scholar). The reason for this enigmatic difference in these Rhodospirillaceae compared with all other known fumarate-reducing prokaryotes is still unknown. On the other hand, Ochman and Wilson (32.Ochman H. Wilson A.C. Neidhardt F.C. Ingraham J.L. Low K.B. Magasanik B. Schaechter M. Umbarger H.E. Escherichia coli and Salmonella typhimurium, Cellular and Molecular Biology: Evolutionary History of Enteric Bacteria. American Society for Microbiology, Washington. D. C.1987: 1649-1654Google Scholar) described a high nucleotide sequence similarity between 16 S rRNA of Rhodospirillaceae and that of mitochondria, indicating a phylogenetic relation between these prokaryotes and eukaryotes. In addition to the presence of RQ in all examined fumarate-reducing eukaryotes, a correlation was found between the ratio of RQ to Q and the dependence on fumarate reduction in the anaerobic energy metabolism of these species. F. hepatica adults produce almost exclusively acetate and propionate as end products of their energy metabolism, in which fumarate reduction is an essential step(33.Tielens A.G.M. Van den Heuvel J.M. Van den Bergh S.G. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1984; 13: 301-307Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Hence, they possess an enzyme complex that functions in the direction of fumarate reduction, which correlates with the very high RQ content as a percentage of the total amount of quinones (Table 1). Adult H. contortus produces mainly acetate, succinate, and propionate(9.Roos M.H. Tielens A.G.M. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1994; 66: 273-281Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar), which correlates well with the observed high content of RQ. In contrast to F. hepatica, adult H. contortus is also partly dependent on Krebs cycle activity(9.Roos M.H. Tielens A.G.M. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1994; 66: 273-281Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar), which is reflected in the lower ratio of RQ to Q as compared with F. hepatica (Table 1). On the other hand, free-living stages of both F. hepatica and H. contortus contained mainly Q, which correlates with the aerobic energy metabolism in these stages(1.Tielens A.G.M. Parasitol. Today. 1994; 10: 346-352Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). The snail L. stagnalis contained a low but substantial amount of RQ compared with Q, which correlates with its mainly aerobic metabolism in vivo together with its significant anaerobic capacity(2.De Zwaan A. Mohamed A.M. Geraerts W.P.M. Neth. J. Zool. 1976; 26: 549-557Crossref Scopus (19) Google Scholar). The examined facultative anaerobic lower marine organisms contained a substantial amount of both Q and RQ. This correlates with their energy metabolism, which changes every 6 h with the tides of the sea. Part of the time, fumarate is reduced when the organisms function anaerobically, but when they rely on Krebs cycle activity, succinate is oxidized by complex II in these organisms. Hence, both Q and RQ are required within a limited time span, and therefore, both substances should be present in substantial amounts as the half-life of quinones is generally on the order of days(21.Powls R. Hemming F.W. Phytochemistry (Oxf.). 1966; 5: 1235-1255Crossref Scopus (16) Google Scholar, 34.Parson W.W. Rudney H. J. Biol. Chem. 1965; 240: 1855-1863Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 35.Thelin A. Schedin S. Dallner G. FEBS Lett. 1992; 313: 118-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). The absolute amount of RQ in these lower marine organisms is low as compared with parasitic helminths. However, marine invertebrates are known to contain, besides fumarate reduction, other fermentative pathways, which produce specific end products like octopine, alanopine, and strombine(36.Pörtner H.O. Heisler N. Grieshaber M.K. J. Comp. Physiol. B. 1984; 155: 1-12Crossref Scopus (36) Google Scholar). To confirm the functional importance of RQ in fumarate reduction in eukaryotic organisms, the correlation between the relative amount of RQ compared with Q and the importance of succinate production was investigated in the developing F. hepatica liver fluke. Tielens et al.(33.Tielens A.G.M. Van den Heuvel J.M. Van den Bergh S.G. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1984; 13: 301-307Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar) demonstrated that the aerobically functioning juvenile liver fluke (F. hepatica) uses Krebs cycle (and hence SDH) activity. This aerobic energy metabolism is gradually replaced by an anaerobic energy metabolism as the juvenile develops into an adult. The energy metabolism of the adult liver fluke is almost exclusively dependent on malate dismutation and hence fumarate reduction. From these metabolic studies, it can be calculated how many electrons have to be transferred per unit of time during the development of the liver fluke, from complexes I and II to complex III by Q in the aerobic respiratory chain, as well as how many electrons have to be transferred by RQ from complex I to complex II to reduce fumarate. As shown in Fig. 2, in the juvenile liver fluke, electrons have to be transferred exclusively by Q. However, during its development, gradually more electrons have to be transferred by RQ. As also shown in Fig. 2, during the development of F. hepatica, a clear correlation was found between the amount of RQ and Q and the amount of electrons that have to be transferred by RQ and Q, respectively. The amount of RQ compared with Q increased during the development of the liver fluke from ∼17 to 84%. Interestingly, electron transport via Q, as well as the Q content, drastically decreased during development, in contrast to the rather constant electron transfer via RQ and the RQ content. This result corresponds with the observation that the juvenile liver fluke is already fully equipped for anaerobic functioning (37.Tielens A.G.M. Van den Heuvel J.M. Van den Bergh S.G. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1982; 6: 277-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar) as the RQ content is not substantially increased during development of the liver fluke. As it was not technically feasible to analyze the quinone composition of stages of F. hepatica from liver (6-25 days after infection), we were not able to investigate whether the observed increased rates of electron transport via Q as well as via RQ are accompanied by increased concentrations of quinones in that period (Fig. 2). Surprisingly, adult F. hepatica isolated from infected sheep livers obtained from a slaughterhouse had a higher RQ content than adult F. hepatica isolated from experimentally infected male Wistar rats (compare Table 1 and Fig. 2). The reason for this difference is still unknown, but it might be correlated with the increased egg production in mature liver flukes, which requires an enhanced energy metabolism. Our results demonstrated that RQ is an indispensable component for efficient electron transport in the anaerobic electron transport chain of eukaryotic organisms. This implies an important difference compared with fumarate reduction in prokaryotes, which utilize menaquinone instead of RQ for fumarate reduction. Both menaquinone and RQ have similar standard redox potentials, −74 and −63 mV, respectively, in contrast to Q (E′0 = +100 mV). These standard redox potentials correlate with the function of RQ and menaquinone in fumarate reduction and with the function of ubiquinone in succinate oxidation(8.Van Hellemond J.J. Tielens A.G.M. Biochem. J. 1994; 304: 321-331Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Interestingly, however, Q and RQ are both benzoquinones, whereas menaquinone is a naphthoquinone. Therefore, the complexes of eukaryotes or prokaryotes that function in vivo as an FRD interact with structurally distinct quinones, suggesting a difference in enzyme structure as well. This possible difference in structure between fumarate-reducing enzyme complexes of eukaryotes and those of prokaryotes was therefore further investigated by analysis of their kinetic properties and diode-like behavior (see below). In prokaryotes, two distinct enzyme complexes are known to exist, one to oxidize succinate (SDH) and another one to reduce fumarate (FRD) (but it should be realized that in vitro, both enzyme complexes are able to catalyze the reaction in both directions). Earlier investigations on parasitic helminths (9.Roos M.H. Tielens A.G.M. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1994; 66: 273-281Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 10.Saruta F. Kuramochi T. Nakamura K. Takamiya S. Yu Y. Aoki T. Sekimizu K. Kojima S. Kita K. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 928-932Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar) suggested that distinct enzyme complexes, which are adapted to their in vivo function, exist in eukaryotes as well. When measured, the activity ratio of succinate oxidation and fumarate reduction reflects the catalytic capacity of the total amount of enzymes present as one cannot distinguish between a reversible reaction in a single type of enzyme and the occurrence of two distinct enzyme complexes. The activity ratio is, however, still informative because a low ratio indicates the presence of a fumarate-reducing type of enzyme complex. Analysis of the activity ratios of succinate oxidation and fumarate reduction in mitochondrial fractions showed that complexes II from rat and bovine heart mitochondria were twice (1.9 and 2.2, respectively) as active in the direction of succinate oxidation as in that of fumarate reduction. This corresponds with their in vivo function as these strictly aerobically functioning mitochondria contain Krebs cycle activity and therefore have to oxidize succinate. Mitochondria of the other species listed in Table 1, which all contain RQ, demonstrated a low SDH/FRD activity ratio (0.09-0.35). On the other hand, significant differences in activity ratios were not detected between different stages of F. hepatica and H. contortus, although in vivo, the free-living stages of these parasites oxidize succinate, whereas the parasitic stages reduce fumarate. Apparently, the observed change in the activity ratio that was observed between free-living and parasitic stages of A. suum(10.Saruta F. Kuramochi T. Nakamura K. Takamiya S. Yu Y. Aoki T. Sekimizu K. Kojima S. Kita K. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 928-932Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar) does not occur in F. hepatica and H. contortus. The low SDH/FRD activity ratios, which we observed in all fumarate-reducing eukaryotes (parasitic helminths as well as the lower marine organisms), are mainly caused by a markedly increased fumarate reduction activity compared with rat and bovine heart mitochondria. This correlates with the significant capacity for fumarate reduction of mitochondria from fumarate-reducing eukaryotes and, in this respect, shows that the fumarate-reducing enzyme complexes of these eukaryotes resemble the FRDs of prokaryotes. Sucheta et al.(38.Sucheta A. Ackrell B.A.C. Cochran B. Armstrong F.A. Nature. 1992; 356: 361-362Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar) demonstrated by cyclic voltammetry that bovine SDH, when measured in the direction of fumarate reduction, is severely retarded when the driving force (over-potential) is increased. The authors suggested that bovine SDH functions just like a tunnel diode: preferentially unidirectional (in the direction of succinate oxidation). In contrast to bovine and Escherichia coli SDHs(17.Ackrell B.A.C. Armstrong F.A. Cochran B. Sucheta A. Yu T. FEBS Lett. 1993; 326: 92-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar), E. coli FRD does not demonstrate this diode-like behavior(39.Sucheta A. Cammack R. Weiner J. Armstrong F.A. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 5455-5465Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar), which correlates with its in vivo function, the reduction of fumarate. Ackrell et al.(17.Ackrell B.A.C. Armstrong F.A. Cochran B. Sucheta A. Yu T. FEBS Lett. 1993; 326: 92-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar) demonstrated that these contrasting behaviors could also be observed via the reduced benzyl viologen fumarate reductase assay. Diode-like behavior in this assay results in negative-order kinetics instead of the usual positive-order kinetics. E. coli, rat, cattle, and human SDHs demonstrated negative-order kinetics and therefore diode-like behavior(17.Ackrell B.A.C. Armstrong F.A. Cochran B. Sucheta A. Yu T. FEBS Lett. 1993; 326: 92-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). On the other hand, E. coli and Saccharomyces cerevisiae FRDs demonstrated positive-order kinetics. Hence, enzymes showing a positive order may be identified as FRDs, while those displaying a negative order are SDHs inasmuch as they appear to catalyze the reduction of fumarate only under conditions of moderate driving force (17.Ackrell B.A.C. Armstrong F.A. Cochran B. Sucheta A. Yu T. FEBS Lett. 1993; 326: 92-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Typical examples of positive- and negative-order kinetics in the reduced benzyl viologen fumarate reductase assay of parasitic helminths are shown in Fig. 3. Diode-like behavior of complex II was demonstrated for mammalian-type mitochondria isolated from rat and bovine heart; for homogenates of the facultative anaerobic marine organisms M. edulis, C. angulata, and A. marina; and for homogenates of the investigated free-living aerobic stages of parasitic helminths (F. hepatica metacercariae and H. contortus L3). These results suggest that all mitochondria utilizing Krebs cycle activity in vivo contain an SDH-type complex II possessing diode-like behavior. The opposite, however, that enzyme complexes known to reduce fumarate in vivo show positive-order kinetics, was not observed as adult A. suum(17.Ackrell B.A.C. Armstrong F.A. Cochran B. Sucheta A. Yu T. FEBS Lett. 1993; 326: 92-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar) and F. hepatica (Fig. 3), although both completely dependent on fumarate reductase activity(32.Ochman H. Wilson A.C. Neidhardt F.C. Ingraham J.L. Low K.B. Magasanik B. Schaechter M. Umbarger H.E. Escherichia coli and Salmonella typhimurium, Cellular and Molecular Biology: Evolutionary History of Enteric Bacteria.

Physiol. 1981; 43: 323-341Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar), showed diode-like behavior (negative order). Adult H. contortus (Fig. 3) and D. viviparus, on the other hand, which are not solely dependent on fumarate reductase activity(9.Roos M.H. Tielens A.G.M. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1994; 66: 273-281Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 41.Fry M. Jenkins D.C. Exp. Parasitol. 1984; 57: 86-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar), showed positive-order kinetics and not the diode-like behavior. Hence, the absence or presence of the diode-like behavior in crude membrane preparations from these eukaryotic organisms gives no indication as to the importance of fumarate reduction in vivo. Recent reports suggested that eukaryotes that reduce fumarate also contain, in addition to an enzyme complex for succinate oxidation, a distinct enzyme complex for fumarate reduction (9.Roos M.H. Tielens A.G.M. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1994; 66: 273-281Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 10.Saruta F. Kuramochi T. Nakamura K. Takamiya S. Yu Y. Aoki T. Sekimizu K. Kojima S. Kita K. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 928-932Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). It can now be concluded that these enzyme complexes for fumarate reduction in eukaryotes differ significantly from the prokaryotic type of FRD since (i) all known primary structures of eukaryotic enzyme complexes functioning in vivo in the direction of fumarate reduction demonstrate a higher amino acid sequence similarity to mammalian and E. coli SDHs than to prokaryotic FRD(1.Tielens A.G.M. Parasitol. Today. 1994; 10: 346-352Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar, 9.Roos M.H. Tielens A.G.M. Mol. Biochem.

FEBS Lett. 1990; 263: 325-328Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar, 43.Wang H. Takamiya S. Kita K. Oya H. Aoki T. Jpn. J. Parasitol. 1992; 41: 122-131Google Scholar); and (ii) eukaryotic complexes that reduce fumarate interact with a benzoquinone (rhodoquinone), whereas prokaryotic FRDs interact with a naphthoquinone (menaquinone). Therefore, in addition to the two known types of enzyme complexes in prokaryotes (SDH and FRD), which differ in primary structure, activity ratio of succinate oxidation and fumarate reduction, diode-like behavior, and interacting quinone, another type of complex exists. This type is present (next to the SDH-type complex) in fumarate-reducing eukaryotes and belongs to the FRD category with respect to the functional properties of the complex, like the SDH/FRD activity ratio and the relatively low standard redox potential of the interacting quinone, RQ (E′0 = −63 mV). On the other hand, this type of enzyme belongs to the SDH category of complex II with respect to its primary structure and the type of interacting quinone, a benzoquinone, as our results demonstrated that in eukaryotes the essential component in fumarate reduction is RQ. Our results support the idea that fumarate-reducing eukaryotes possess an enzyme complex for the reduction of fumarate, which is structurally related to SDH-type complex II, but has the functional characteristics of prokaryotic FRDs. For definitive conclusions, however, on the differences between enzyme complexes for succinate oxidation and fumarate reduction in eukaryotes, further experiments, like sequence comparisons and analysis of the kinetic properties of the purified enzymes, will be necessary.

( (2)In order to clarify the nomenclature for members in the growing family of latent TGF-β binding proteins, we have renamed latent TGF-β binding protein (LTBP) as latent TGF-β binding protein-1 (LTBP-1) to indicate that this was the first member of this family to be identified.) LAP is the NH2-terminal remnant of the TGF-β precursor, which confers the latency of TGF-β (9.Gentry L.E. Webb N.R. Lim G.J. Brunner A.M. Ranchalis J.E. Twardzik D.R. Lioubin M.N. Marquardt H.

LTBP-1 is disulfide-linked to LAP in the large latent TGF-β complex (10.Kanzaki T. Olofsson A. Morén A. Wernstedt C. Hellman U. Miyazono K. Claesson-Welsh L. Heldin C.-H.

About two-thirds of the sequence of LTBP-1 is composed of two different types of cysteine-rich repeat sequences; there are 16-18 copies of epidermal growth factor (EGF)-like repeats and 3-4 copies of a repeat containing eight cysteine residues (eight-cysteine repeat). EGF-like repeats are found in many other proteins and are suggested to be important in homophilic or heterophilic protein-protein interactions (12.Davis C.G. New Biol. 1990; 2: 410-419PubMed Google Scholar). The functions of the eight-cysteine repeats are unknown. Multiple EGF-like repeats and eight-cysteine repeats have thus far been identified in a family of proteins, consisting of LTBP-1, LTBP-2(13.Morén A. Olofsson A Stenman G. Sahlin P. Kanzaki T.

It plays important roles in the assembly and secretion of latent TGF-β complex from certain cell types(6.Miyazono K. Olofsson A. Colosetti P. Heldin C.-H. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 1091-1101Crossref PubMed Scopus (423) Google Scholar). In human fibroblasts and fibrosarcoma cells, LTBP-1 binds to extracellular matrix after secretion and is released from the matrix by proteolytic digestion(18.Taipale J. Miyazono K. Heldin C.-H.

In addition, LTBP-1 is important for the activation of latent TGF-β, e.g. in co-culture of endothelial cells and smooth muscle cells(20.Flaumenhaft R. Abe M. Sato Y. Miyazono K. Harpel J. Heldin C.-H. Rifkin D.B. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 120: 995-1002Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar). In human platelets, LTBP-1 is observed as multiple components of 125-160 kDa. In contrast, it is observed as 190-210-kDa components in the media from human foreskin fibroblasts (10.Kanzaki T. Olofsson A. Morén A. Wernstedt C. Hellman U. Miyazono K. Claesson-Welsh L.

EMBO J. 1991; 10: 1091-1101Crossref PubMed Scopus (423) Google Scholar). The difference in the sizes may be in part due to proteolytic processing of the protein(6.Miyazono K. Olofsson A. Colosetti P. Heldin C.-H. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 1091-1101Crossref PubMed Scopus (423) Google Scholar). In addition, two different transcript sizes (approximately 5.2 and 7.0 kb) of LTBP-1 mRNA have been observed, which suggests use of different polyadenylation sites or different promoters or the presence of alternative splice variants(10.Kanzaki T.

Here we report the cDNA cloning of a longer version of human LTBP-1 (LTBP-1L) and show that the extracellular matrix binding properties of the long and short variants of LTBP-1 differ. A partial clone for LTBP-1L was obtained by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using a sequence of rat LTBP-1 (large subunit of TGF-β masking protein; (11.Tsuji T. Okada F. Yamaguchi K. Nakamura T.

PCR was performed using a Perkin-Elmer DNA thermal cycler with Pyrococcus furiosus DNA polymerase (Stratagene) and with linearized U-1240 MG glioblastoma cDNA as a template. Thus a 570-base pair fragment specific for LTBP-1L was generated. A λgt11 HEL cDNA library, obtained from Mortimer Poncz (21.Poncz M. Surrey S. LaRocco P. Weiss M.J. Rappaport E.F. Conway T.M. Schwartz E. Blood. 1987; 69: 219-223Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) was screened with the PCR product labeled by the Megaprime DNA labeling system (Amersham Corp.). Hybridization to nitrocellulose replica filter papers and washing were performed essentially as described(10.Kanzaki T. Olofsson A. Morén A. Wernstedt C. Hellman U. Miyazono K. Claesson-Welsh L.

Maniatis T.E. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). A clone termed H4 with a 4.1-kb insert was isolated from the cDNA library. The 5′-part of clone H4 was cut by EcoRI, subcloned into pBluescript SK vector, and sequenced by the dideoxy chain termination method (23.Sanger F. Nicklen S. Coulson A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 5463-5467Crossref PubMed Scopus (52769) Google Scholar) on both strands using T7 DNA polymerase (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.). DNA sequences were analyzed by the DNA STAR computer program (DNA STAR, Ltd.). Amino acid sequences were compared by the Clustal method(24.Higgins D.G. Sharp P.M. Comput. Appl. Biosci. 1989; 4: 11-17Google Scholar). A 635-base pair PstI restriction fragment of LTBP-1S (BPA-13, nucleotides 1516-2151) and the PCR product specific for LTBP-1L were radiolabeled by the Megaprime DNA labeling system and used as probes. A Northern hybridization filter with mRNAs from different human tissues (Clontech) was hybridized and washed, essentially as described(13.Morén A. Olofsson A Stenman G. Sahlin P. Kanzaki T.

For the construction of a plasmid for LTBP-1L, the 3′-part of BPA 13 (10.Kanzaki T. Olofsson A. Morén A. Wernstedt C. Hellman U. Miyazono K. Claesson-Welsh L. Heldin C.-H.

A transient expression plasmid for LTBP-1L was then constructed by subcloning LTBP-1L cDNA into the pSV7d expression vector (25.Truett M.A. Blacher R. Burke R.L. Caput D. Chu C. Dina D. Hartog K.

Hellman U. Miyazono K. Claesson-Welsh L. Heldin C.-H. Cell. 1990; 61: 1051-1061Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (370) Google Scholar), was also used. COS-1 cells (American Type Culture Collection) were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 50 μg/ml streptomycin, and transfection was performed using Transfectam (Promega) according to the manufacturer's protocol. In brief, cells were seeded into six-well tissue culture dishes (Falcon) and transfected the following day at subconfluency with 4 μg of plasmids and 6 μl of Transfectam. After 12 h of incubation, cells were washed two times with phosphate-buffered saline (137 mM NaCl, 8 mM Na2HPO4, 2.7 mM KCl, 1.5 mM KH2PO4), and incubated with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 50 μg/ml streptomycin. One and a half days after transfection, the cells were used for metabolic labeling and immunoprecipitation. In the experiment using coated culture dishes, the culture dishes were coated with 0.5 ml of fibronectin (50 μg/ml in phosphate-buffered saline), 0.25 ml of collagen in monomeric form (300 μg/ml in 0.1 M HCl), or 0.25 ml of gelatin (200 μg/ml in 0.1 M HCl). After 6 h of incubation, the dishes were washed with phosphate-buffered saline before the cells were seeded. Metabolic labeling of transfected COS cells was performed for 36 h with 100 μCi/ml of [35S]methionine and [35S]cysteine (in vitro labeling mix; Amersham) in methionine- and cysteine-free MCDB 104 medium(13.Morén A. Olofsson A Stenman G. Sahlin P. Kanzaki T. Claesson-Welsh L. ten Dijke P. Miyazono K. Heldin C.-H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 32469-32478Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). After labeling, the conditioned media were collected. The cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline and then solubilized in 20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl, 10 mM EDTA, 0.5% Triton X-100, 0.5% deoxycholate, 1.5% Trasylol (Bayer), and 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (Sigma). After 15 min on ice, the cell lysates were recovered by scraping and centrifuged, and the supernatants were subjected to immunoprecipitation. For preparation of extracellular matrix proteins, the media were collected and the cells were washed three times with 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, for 20 min each time on ice, followed by one short wash with phosphate-buffered saline. The plates with the remaining matrix were then dried at room temperature overnight and subjected to digestion with 0.3 units of plasmin (Sigma)/ml for 1 h at 37°C in phosphate-buffered saline containing 1 mM CaCl, 1 mM MgSO4 and 0.1% N-octyl-D-β-glucopyranoside (Sigma). The digested extracellular matrix proteins were then extracted by adding the same volume of lysis buffer followed by incubation for 10 min on ice. The supernatant was recovered and subjected to immunoprecipitation using a polyclonal antiserum to LTBP, Ab 39 (10.Kanzaki T. Olofsson A. Morén A. Wernstedt C. Hellman U. Miyazono K. Claesson-Welsh L. Heldin C.-H. Cell. 1990; 61: 1051-1061Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (370) Google Scholar) as described(13.Morén A. Olofsson A Stenman G. Sahlin P. Kanzaki T. Claesson-Welsh L. ten Dijke P. Miyazono K. Heldin C.-H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 32469-32478Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The immune complexes were heated at 95°C for 5 min in SDS-sample buffer (26.Blobel G. Dobberstein B. J. Cell Biol. 1975; 67: 835-851Crossref PubMed Scopus (1838) Google Scholar) in the presence of 20 mM dithiothreitol, and analyzed by SDS-gel electrophoresis using 5-15% polyacrylamide gels(26.Blobel G. Dobberstein B. J. Cell Biol. 1975; 67: 835-851Crossref PubMed Scopus (1838) Google Scholar). Gels were fixed, incubated with Amplify (Amersham) for 20 min, and subjected to fluorography. A part of the NH2-terminal region of LTBP-1L was obtained by PCR using sequences of rat LTBP-1 (11.Tsuji T. Okada F. Yamaguchi K. Nakamura T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 8835-8839Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar) and human LTBP-1S (10.Kanzaki T. Olofsson A. Morén A. Wernstedt C. Hellman U. Miyazono K. Claesson-Welsh L. Heldin C.-H. Cell. 1990; 61: 1051-1061Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (370) Google Scholar) as primers. Screening the HEL cell cDNA library with the PCR product as a probe, a clone (H4) with a 4.1-kb insert was obtained (Fig. 1A). Nucleotide sequencing of the cDNA clone revealed that it has an NH2-terminal region of 346 amino acid residues (L-region) that is not found in LTBP-1S (Fig. 1B). In the L-region, an EGF-like repeat (amino acid residues 188-220) is present, which is less conserved compared with the other EGF-like repeats found in the molecule. Alternative splicing appears to have occurred between codons 145 and 146 of LTBP-1S. The L-region of LTBP-1L is highly similar (77%) to that of rat LTBP-1 (Fig. 1C). Moreover, it is also similar (23%) to the corresponding region of LTBP-2; in addition to the presence of an EGF-like repeat, a sequence containing four cysteine residues with a high amino acid sequence similarity is found in both LTBP-1L and LTBP-2 (Fig. 1C). The expression of the two different transcripts of LTBP-1 in human tissues was investigated using human multiple-tissue Northern blots. The 7.0-kb transcript was seen in heart, placenta, kidney, and prostate, whereas the 5.2-kb transcript was more widely expressed and was seen also in lung, skeletal muscle, testis, and ovary (Fig. 2A). The filter was then hybridized using a PCR product corresponding to the L-region of LTBP-1L as a probe; only the 7.0-kb transcript hybridized with this probe (Fig. 2B), consistent with the conclusion that 7.0- and 5.2-kb transcripts encode the LTBP-1L and LTBP-1S, respectively. The cDNAs for LTBP-1L and −1S were transfected into COS cells, and the expression and localization of the proteins were studied by metabolic labeling followed by immunoprecipitation with Ab 39. LTBP-1S was observed as a 195-kDa protein mainly in the conditioned medium, and only a minor amount of LTBP-1S was found in the cell lysates (Fig. 3A). LTBP-1L was seen as 210- and 180-kDa forms in the medium; the 180-kDa form may be a proteolytically processed form of the 210-kDa form. A small amount of LTBP-1L was found in the cell lysate fraction, mainly as a 210-kDa form. In order to investigate whether the different forms of LTBP-1 observed in the cell lysate were bound to the extracellular matrix, the transfected COS cells were first treated with 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, containing 0.5% sodium deoxycholate and washed. The remaining matrix was subjected to digestion by plasmin. The released matrix-bound proteins were recovered and subjected to immunoprecipitation with Ab 39. As shown in Fig. 3B, LTBP-1L was found as a 170-kDa band in the extracellular matrix digests, whereas only a small amount of LTBP-1S was found in this fraction. In order to show that LTBP-1 isolated from matrix by digestion by plasmin is due to LTBP-1 bound to matrix and not unspecifically bound to plastic, we coated the cell culture wells with collagen, gelatin, or fibronectin before the cells were seeded and repeated the above experiments. Analysis by plasmin digestion indicated that more LTBP-1L than LTBP-1S was associated with the matrix-coated dishes. The association was more pronounced to culture dishes coated with matrix proteins than to uncoated dishes; the most efficient association was achieved after coating with monomeric collagen (Fig. 3C). In the media there were similar amounts of LTBP-1S and LTBP-1L. We describe here the cloning of human LTBP-1L cDNA. Similar to rat LTBP-1 obtained from a rat kidney cDNA library(11.Tsuji T. Okada F. Yamaguchi K. Nakamura T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 8835-8839Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar), LTBP-1L has a region of 346 amino acid residues (L-region) in its NH2-terminal part, which is not found in LTBP-1S obtained from a human foreskin fibroblast cDNA library(10.Kanzaki T. Olofsson A. Morén A. Wernstedt C. Hellman U. Miyazono K. Claesson-Welsh L. Heldin C.-H. Cell. 1990; 61: 1051-1061Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (370) Google Scholar). A region similar to the L-region of LTBP-1L was also found in LTBP-2 (13.Morén A. Olofsson A Stenman G. Sahlin P. Kanzaki T. Claesson-Welsh L. ten Dijke P. Miyazono K. Heldin C.-H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 32469-32478Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The overall structure of LTBP-2 is very similar to that of LTBP-1L; LTBP-2 contains multiple copies of EGF-like repeats and eight-cysteine repeats. Similar to LTBP-1, LTBP-2 has been shown to form a complex with the TGF-β1 precursor (13.Morén A. Olofsson A Stenman G. Sahlin P. Kanzaki T. Claesson-Welsh L. ten Dijke P. Miyazono K. Heldin C.-H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 32469-32478Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). ( (3)A. Olofsson, unpublished data.) Northern hybridization analysis of LTBP-2 mRNA revealed two transcripts with different sizes, suggesting the presence of similar alternative splice variants in LTBP-2. Recently, a third member in the LTBP family, LTBP-3, was cloned from the mouse(14.Yin W. Smiley E. Germiller J. Mecham R.P. Florer J.B. Wenstrup R.J. Bonadio J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 10147-10160Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Its structure is similar to LTBP-1S. LTBP-3 is expressed widely in cells during murine development and can form a complex with the TGF-β1 precursor in MC 3T3-E1 osteoblasts. It is not known whether LTBP-3 also occurs as short and long forms. Transfection of LTBP-2 cDNA into COS cells revealed that a considerable amount of LTBP-2 is found in the extracellular matrix (13.Morén A. Olofsson A Stenman G. Sahlin P. Kanzaki T. Claesson-Welsh L. ten Dijke P. Miyazono K. Heldin C.-H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 32469-32478Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It will be interesting to determine whether the sequence in LTBP-2 that is homologous to the L-region of LTBP-1L mediates the association with extracellular matrix. In the L-regions, EGF-like repeats are found both in LTBP-1L and LTBP-2, which are less conserved compared with those in other parts of the molecules. In addition, a conserved sequence containing four cysteine residues is also present in both LTBP-1L and LTBP-2. Notably there is also a proline-rich region (amino acid residues 101-109) in the L-region, similar to that found in fibrillin-1(17.Zhang H. Apfelroth S.D. Hu W. Davis E.C. Sanguineti C. Bonadio J. Mecham R.P. Ramirez F. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 124: 855-863Crossref PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar). The L-region is highly basic. It is possible that the positive charges in this region are important for interactions with the extracellular matrix. The functional roles of the different parts of LTBP-1 are still not fully understood. We have found that both LTBP-1S and LTBP-1L form complexes with the TGF-β1 precursor in transfected COS cells (13.Morén A. Olofsson A Stenman G. Sahlin P. Kanzaki T. Claesson-Welsh L. ten Dijke P. Miyazono K. Heldin C.-H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 32469-32478Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).3 Thus, it is unlikely that the L-region of LTBP-1L is critical for the complex formation with the TGF-β1 precursor. The finding that LTBP-1L associates more efficiently than LTBP-1S with the extracellular matrix suggests a role of the L-region in targeting of latent TGF-β to different tissues. It is not known which matrix components LTBP-1 associates with in vivo, but in experiments using tissue culture plates coated with various extracellular matrix proteins, we could see an efficient association of LTBP-1L with collagen and, to a lesser extent, with gelatin and fibronectin. LTBP-1 was also released from the matrix by collagenase but considerably less efficiently than by plasmin.3 Latent complexes composed only of TGF-β and LAP, or with LTBP-2 and other components, also exist in certain tissues(7.Olofsson A. Miyazono K. Kanzaki T. Colosetti P. Engström U. Heldin C.-H. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 19482-19488Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 8.Dallas S.L. Park-Snyder S. Miyazono K. Twardzik D.

Thus, the localization and availability in vivo of TGF-β is regulated, at least in part, by the proteins that form complexes with the TGF-β precursors.

Purification was achieved by fractionated ammonium sulfate precipitation, dye-ligand affinity chromatography on matrex red A, gel filtration, ion exchange chromatography on Mono Q and a second dye-ligand affinity chromatography on fractogel TSK AF Blue. The purified enzyme was a single polypeptide with an Mr = 50,000 displaying an isoelectric point of 4.8, a pH optimum between pH 6 and 9 and a temperature optimum at 47°C. The Km values for the substrate salutaridinol and the co-substrate acetyl coenzyme A were 7 and 46 μM, respectively. Salutaridinol-7-O-acetyltransferase catalyzes the stoichiometric transfer of the acetyl group from acetyl coenzyme A to the 7-OH group of salutaridinol yielding salutaridinol-7-O-acetate, which is a new intermediate in morphine biosynthesis. Salutaridinol-7-O-acetate undergoes a subsequent spontaneous allylic elimination at pH 8-9, leading to the formation of thebaine(1.Lenz R. Zenk M.H.

Purification was achieved by fractionated ammonium sulfate precipitation, dye-ligand affinity chromatography on matrex red A, gel filtration, ion exchange chromatography on Mono Q and a second dye-ligand affinity chromatography on fractogel TSK AF Blue. The purified enzyme was a single polypeptide with an Mr = 50,000 displaying an isoelectric point of 4.8, a pH optimum between pH 6 and 9 and a temperature optimum at 47°C. The Km values for the substrate salutaridinol and the co-substrate acetyl coenzyme A were 7 and 46 μM, respectively. Salutaridinol-7-O-acetyltransferase catalyzes the stoichiometric transfer of the acetyl group from acetyl coenzyme A to the 7-OH group of salutaridinol yielding salutaridinol-7-O-acetate, which is a new intermediate in morphine biosynthesis. Salutaridinol-7-O-acetate undergoes a subsequent spontaneous allylic elimination at pH 8-9, leading to the formation of thebaine(1.Lenz R. Zenk M.H. Tetrahedron Lett. 1994; 35: 3897-3900Crossref Scopus (29) Google Scholar), the first morphinan alkaloid with the complete pentacyclic ring system, or at pH 7 leading to dibenz[d,f]azonine alkaloids that contain a nine-membered ring.

INTRODUCTIONSince the discovery of enzymes containing covalently bound flavin-adenine dinucleotide (FAD) or flavin mononucleotide (FMN) over 40 years ago, five types of covalent bonds between flavin and proteins have been revealed (1.Decker K.F. Annu. Rev. Nutr. 1993; 13: 17-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar, 2.Edmondson D.E. De Francisco R. Müller F. Chemistry and Biochemistry of Flavoenzymes. I. CRC Press, Boca Raton, FL1992: 73-103Google Scholar) (Fig. 1). In all this time, two major questions have remained unresolved: (a) what is the reason for covalent flavin binding in enzymes, and (b) what is the mechanism for covalent attachment of flavin?No completely satisfying explanation has been provided for the first question. The attachment of an aminoacyl group to the 8α- or 6-position of riboflavin does not confer any unusual properties on the flavin, either free in solution or in an enzyme, with the exception of the ultraviolet-visible spectrum of 6-S-cysteinylriboflavin, which is quite different from that of other forms of free and bound aminoacyl flavins(2.Edmondson D.E. De Francisco R. Müller F. Chemistry and Biochemistry of Flavoenzymes. I. CRC Press, Boca Raton, FL1992: 73-103Google Scholar, 3.Steenkamp D.J. Kenney W.C. Singer T.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1978; 253: 2812-2817Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). While the oxidation-reduction potentials (Em7) are about 50-60 mV more positive for aminoacyl flavins than for unmodified forms(2.Edmondson D.E. De Francisco R. Müller F. Chemistry and Biochemistry of Flavoenzymes. I. CRC Press, Boca Raton, FL1992: 73-103Google Scholar), this increase in potential can also be achieved by noncovalent interactions with protein. Additionally, enzymes with covalently bound flavins do not catalyze a unique or specific set of reactions.As to the second question, it is known that 2-electron reduction of protein-free 8α-O-tyrosylriboflavin or 8α-S-cysteinylsulfonylriboflavin cause expulsion of the aminoacyl groups, thus producing unmodified, oxidized riboflavin(2.Edmondson D.E. De Francisco R. Müller F. Chemistry and Biochemistry of Flavoenzymes. I. CRC Press, Boca Raton, FL1992: 73-103Google Scholar, 4.McIntire W.S. Edmondson D.E. Hopper D.J. Singer T.P. Biochemistry. 1981; 20: 3068-3075Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). The principle of microscopic reversibility suggests that the reverse reaction could occur within an enzyme, with or without intervention of an external enzyme. A mechanism for covalent flavinylation, which has long been in the literature, is shown in Fig. 2(5.Walsh C. Acc. Chem. Res. 1980; 13: 148-155Crossref Scopus (389) Google Scholar, 6.Walsh C. Massey V. Williams C.H. Flavins and Flavoproteins. Elsevier Science Publishers B.V., Amsterdam1982: 121-132Google Scholar). An analogous mechanism was proposed for nonenzymic base-catalyzed nucleophilic attack at the 8α-carbon of riboflavin derivatives in organic solvents(7.Frost J.W. Rastetter W.H. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1980; 102: 7157-7159Crossref Scopus (19) Google Scholar).Figure 2:The proposed mechanism for covalent attachment of FAD to PCMH via Tyr384 of PchF. B1, B2, B3, and their protonated forms represent hypothetical bases on PchF that are predicted to be involved in the mechanism of covalent flavinylation. B1 extracts a proton from the 8α-carbon of FAD (structure 1), yielding the iminoquinone methide form of FAD (structure 2). The stabilizing base at N-1/C-2 oxygen (B2H+) is probably Arg477 of PchF. This Arg is 3.3 and 2.5 Å from the N-1 and the C-2 oxygen positions, respectively (see Fig. 5). The phenolate oxygen of Tyr384 attacks the 8α-methylene of the iminoquinone methide form to produce covalently bound reduced FAD (structure 3). One would expect a protonated base (B3H+) to transfer a proton to the N-5-position during this step. B3H+ could be hydronium ion that is stabilized by a side chain; Tyr172 is 4.5 Å from N-5. Reoxidation produces catalytically competent 8α-O-tyrosyl-linked FAD (structure 4).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)It has been suggested that covalent tethering might require prior activation of the flavin or proteins, e.g. a high energy phosphate bond(8.Decker K. Müller F. Chemistry and Biochemistry of Flavoenzymes. II. CRC Press, Boca Raton, FL1991: 343-375Google Scholar). Of several enzymes studied to date, no specific enzyme has been implicated in the covalent modification process, which contrasts with examples of nonflavin-cofactor covalent attachment to apoenzymes(9.Bradford A.P. Aitken A. Cook K.G. Yeaman S.J. FEBS Lett. 1987; 222: 211-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar, 10.Taniuchi H. Basile G. Taniuchi M. Veloso D. J. Biol.

Rohlfs R.J. Hille R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 13942-13950Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and p-cresol methylhydroxylase (PCMH) (8α-O-tyrosyl-FAD) (18.Kim J. Fuller J.H. Cecchini G. McIntire W.S. J. Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 6349-6361.Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) (Fig. 1). In some cases, normal enzymes with covalently bound flavin are produced. For the latter three, enzymes without bound flavin could be recovered. Further, only apo-6-HDNO and apo-PCMH could be subsequently converted to the holo forms in vitro. Analytical amounts of apo-6-HDNO were obtained from a pure Escherichia coli-expressed β-galactosidase-6-HDNO fusion protein(19.Brandsch R. Bichler V. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 19056-19062Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The in vitro flavinylation of 6-HDNO required Mg2+ and mercaptoethanol and was accelerated by millimolar amounts of three-carbon compounds such as glycerol 3-phosphate, glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate, phosphoenolpyruvate, or 45% glycerol(1.Decker K.F. Annu. Rev. Nutr. 1993; 13: 17-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar, 15.Decker K. Brandsch R. Biofactors. 1991; 3: 69-81PubMed Google Scholar, 20.Brandsch R. Bichler V. Eur. J. Biochem. 1989; 182: 125-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). The phosphorylated compounds do not chemically activate FAD, but possibly act allosterically. It also has been reported that citric acid cycle intermediates accelerate covalent flavinylation of succinate dehydrogenase and fumarate reductase(14.Ackrell B.A.C. Johnson M.K. Gunsalus R.P. Cecchini G. Müller F. Chemistry and Biochemistry of Flavoenzymes. III. CRC Press, Boca Raton, FL1992: 229-297Google Scholar). These observations, together with results from GroE-dependent 6-HDNO refolding and flavinylation studies(21.Brandsch R. Bichler V. Schmidt M. Buchner J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 20844-20849Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and the characterization of a series of Cys to Ser replacements (22.Brandsch R. Bichler V. Mauch L. Decker K. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 12724-12729Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) in 6-HDNO, suggest that in vivo covalent incorporation of FAD occurs during the folding process after the entire protein chain has been synthesized. Contrary to expectation (21.Brandsch R. Bichler V. Schmidt M. Buchner J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 20844-20849Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), a specific GroE/6-HDNO complex is not formed. It is not clear why such a myriad of factors should affect covalent flavinylation of 6-HDNO, and the relationship of these agents to in vivo A. aerogenes factor(s) is unknown. No experiments reported heretofore directly addressed the chemistry of covalent flavinylation.In experiments with fumarate reductase, His44, which covalently binds to FAD, was replaced with Cys, Tyr, Arg, or Ser, amino acids capable of covalently binding to FAD at the 8α-carbon. All site-specifically altered forms displayed lowered activity, relative to the normal enzyme, but in no case was FAD covalently bound (14.Ackrell B.A.C. Johnson M.K. Gunsalus R.P. Cecchini G. Müller F. Chemistry and Biochemistry of Flavoenzymes. III. CRC Press, Boca Raton, FL1992: 229-297Google Scholar). Obviously, precisely defined conditions are necessary for covalent flavinylation, in order to properly position the aminoacyl nucleophile, and the electrophilic center of the flavin.The flavocytochrome PCMH oxidizes p-cresol (4-methylphenol) to 4-hydroxybenzyl alcohol and then oxidizes this alcohol to 4-hydroxybenzaldehyde in the periplasmic space of Pseudomonas putida and related bacteria(23.Hopper D.J. Jones M.R. Causer M.J. FEBS Lett. 1985; 182: 485-488Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Electrons from these oxidations are funneled into the membrane electron-transport chain of the bacterium for ATP production. PCMH has an α2β2 structure consisting of two α flavoprotein subunits (PchF), each with covalently bound FAD, and two β c-type cytochrome subunits (PchC). PCMH and its related 4-ethylphenol methylenehydroxylase are the only proteins known to contain FAD covalently bound via the 8α-carbon of the flavin to the phenolic oxygen of a tyrosyl residue. The genes of both subunits (pchF and pchC) of form A of PCMH from P. putida NCIMB 9869 were cloned, sequenced, and expressed in E. coli(18.Kim J. Fuller J.H. Cecchini G. McIntire W.S. J. Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 6349-6361.Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Whether PchC is expressed in the absence of or together with PchF, heme is covalently bound. When pchF and pchC are expressed together in E. coli, PchC is produced at about 20% the molar level of PchF. E. coli extracts were combined so that the final mixture contained equimolar amounts of PchC and PchF. PCMH purified from this mixture was identical to PCMH expressed by wild-type P. putida 9869. Gram quantities of pure heterologously expressed PCMH could be obtained in this way.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESChemicals, Strains, and Culture ConditionsChemicals and manufacturers: nitro blue tetrazolium, phenazine methosulfate, phenazine ethosulfate (PES), 3,5-xylenol, Bis-Tris propane, sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS), lysozyme (L-6876), nucleotide pyrophosphatase (P-7383), catalase (C-30), trypsin (T-8253), FAD, Sigma; alkaline phosphatase(713023), Boehringer Mannheim; glucose oxidase(31-617-2), Miles Laboratories; chymotrypsin, Worthington Biochemical Corp.; sodium 2,6-dichlorophenol indophenol, General Biochemical, Inc., Chagrin Falls, OH; HPLC solvents, J.T.

P. putida NCIMB 9869 was grown at 30°C on Hegeman's medium (26.Hegeman U.K. J. Bacteriol. 1966; 91: 1140-1154Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) supplemented with Huntner's “metals 44” solution and 0.03% (w/v) 3,5-xylenol (18.Kim J. Fuller J.H. Cecchini G. McIntire W.S. J.

Singer T.P. Biochem. J. 1985; 231: 383-387Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). PCMH, PchF, and PchC were purified from E. coli strain DH5α transformed with pKK vector harboring pchF, pchC, or both pchC and pchF (pKK-F, pKK-C, or pKK-CF, respectively; (18.Kim J. Fuller J.H. Cecchini G. McIntire W.S. J. Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 6349-6361.Crossref PubMed Google Scholar)), by the same method used to purify PCMH from P. putida(27.Koerber S.C. Hopper D.J. McIntire W.S. Singer T.P. Biochem. J. 1985; 231: 383-387Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar).Fractions containing PchF or PchC from chromatography steps were identified using nitrocellulose dot-blot antibody detection. The dot-blots were developed as for Western blot analysis described below.PchF and PchC (partially purified from extracts of E. coli/pKK-CF) were separated from each other by a modified isoelectric focusing procedure(27.Koerber S.C. Hopper D.J. McIntire W.S. Singer T.P. Biochem. J. 1985; 231: 383-387Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). One gram of washed Sephadex G-200 Superfine was suspended and hydrated overnight in a 1:16 (v/v) solution of Pharmacia Pharmalytes (equal amounts of pH 4-6.5 and pH 6.5-9 Pharmalytes). The slurry was layered onto a glass plate (13 × 7.5 × 0.2 cm, length × width × depth) and dried to 75% of the original weight. The samples (1-50 mg of protein in 50-500 μl) were applied directly to the gel and focused at a constant power of 7 watts at 4°C. The separated subunits were eluted from the Sephadex matrix by repeated extractions with 16 mM potassium phosphate, pH 7.0, and then concentrated.Immunodetection and Activity StainingFor native gels, cell-free extracts were prepared by a modified published method(28.Osborn M.J. Gander J.E. Parisi E. Carson J. J. Biol. Chem. 1972; 247: 3962-3972Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). E. coli cultures grown overnight at 37°C were harvested and resuspended with cell suspension buffer (10 mM Tris HCl, pH 7.4, 1 mM EDTA) containing 2 mg/ml lysozyme. After a 1-h incubation at room temperature, cell debris was centrifuged away and washed with cell suspension buffer, and the supernatants were combined. The centrifuged supernatants were diluted with 4 volumes of sample buffer (75 mM Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 50% glycerol, 0.25% bromphenol blue) and loaded onto a 7.5% native gel.Following PAGE of the cell lysates under nondenaturing conditions(29.Gabriel O. Methods Enzymol. 1971; 40: 578-604Crossref Scopus (159) Google Scholar), gels were soaked in 50 mM Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.5, for 10 min with occasional shaking, transferred to an activity-staining solution (50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 5 mMp-cresol, 2 mg/ml nitro blue tetrazolium, and 0.2 mg/ml phenazine methosulfate), and incubated for 30 min in the dark, at room temperature. The gels were rinsed with distilled H2O and washed three times, for 5 min each time, with 10% (v/v) acetic acid to fix the color.For the denaturing gels, cells were lysed in SDS sample buffer, centrifuged, and the soluble fraction separated by SDS-PAGE(30.Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (206024) Google Scholar). Protein concentrations were determined by the bicinchoninic acid method (Pierce). For immunodetection, PCMH and its subunits were electrophoretically transferred to nitrocellulose after electrophoresis (31.Towbin H. Staehelin T. Gordon H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 4350-4354Crossref PubMed Scopus (44707) Google Scholar). Rabbit polyclonal antibodies against PchF or PchC were used in conjunction with the secondary antibody-alkaline phosphatase conjugate. Color development reagents were obtained from Promega Corp. (Madison, WI), and used according to the supplied protocol.Analyses for Covalently Bound FADAliquots containing 1 mg of protein were brought to 1 ml with H2O and then mixed with 0.1 volume of 55% trichloroacetic acid. Samples were put on ice for 10 min and then centrifuged. Supernatants were recovered and analyzed for free flavin. The pellets were washed twice with 1% trichloroacetic acid and resuspended with 0.1 ml of Tris (pH 8.2). Samples were digested for 4 h at 37°C by adding 10 μl of a solution containing 10 mg/ml each trypsin and chymotrypsin. The solution was brought to 5% trichloroacetic acid and centrifuged. Recovered trichloroacetic acid solutions were heated at 100°C for 5 min to convert FAD to FMN/riboflavin. After cooling, the solutions were neutralized to pH 6 with 2 M KHCO3. Flavin contents were measured by fluorescence with a Hatachi F-4010 Fluorescence Spectrophotometer (Hatachi Instruments, Inc., San Jose, CA), using riboflavin as a standard: excitation λ= 445 nm; emission λ = 525 nm. After the initial measurement, a known volume of a standardized riboflavin solution was added to each sample. A fluorescence intensity increase less than that measured for the same amount of riboflavin in buffer alone would have indicated internal fluorescence quenching in a particular sample. No such quenching was observed.Flavin Peptide AnalysisPCMH was generated by incubating 128 nmol of E. coli-expressed apo-PchF2, 188 nmol of E. coli-expressed PchC, and 325 nmol of FAD in 2.1 ml of 16 mM potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.0, for 2 h at room temperature. The buffer and excess FAD were removed by three concentration/H2O dilution steps using a Centricon-10 (Amicon, Danvers, MA). PchF and PchC were dissociated from each other by isoelectric focusing at 4°C, in a 13 × 7.5 × 0.2-cm (length × width × depth) bed of hydrated Sephadex G-200 Superfine, using 1:16 diluted Pharmacia Pharmalytes (pH 4.5-6.0) (see above) (27.Koerber S.C. Hopper D.J. McIntire W.S. Singer T.P. Biochem. J. 1985; 231: 383-387Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). After focusing, the yellow, covalently flavinylated PchF band was removed from the bed and the gel eluted with 16 mM potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.0. The yield of recovered PchF was 131 nmol in 2 ml. Trichloroacetic acid (200 μl of 55% (w/v) solution) was added to the solution of PchF. The centrifugation pellet was washed with H2O and recentrifuged. The pellet was suspended and sonicated in 1 ml of H2O + 20 μl of 88% formic acid. Pepsin (50 μl of a 10 mg/ml solution) was added to the suspension, which was incubated at 37°C. The reaction was followed by HPLC using a 15 × 0.4-cm C-18 Spherex octadecylsilane silica gel column, 3-μm particle size (Phenomenex, Torrance, CA), eluting with a gradient from 0 to 100% CH3CN in H2O over 30 min. The solvents contained 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid, and the flow rate was 1 ml/min. The reaction was quenched after 4.5 h by adding trifluoroacetic acid to 0.1% at 0°C. Two partially pure flavin-containing peptide fractions were obtained by this HPLC method with three injections of the peptic digest (retention times: 1, 13.8 min; 2, 14.1 min; broad tailing of flavin-containing material from 14.1 to 16 min). HPLC analysis of nucleotide pyrophosphatase-treated aliquots indicated that both peptides contained FAD. Sample 1 was further purified on a Pharmacia PepRPC HR 5/5 reverse phase column. The sample was injected onto the column equilibrated with 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid in H2O. Peptides were eluted isocratically with 85:15, H2O:CH3CN + 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid with a 1 ml/min flow rate. Retention times were: FAD peptide, 13.8 min; other peptides, 1.7-13 min. The FAD peptide sample in 0.5 ml of 7.5 mM Bis Tris propane buffer and 16 mM MgCl2, pH 7.8, was treated with 0.4 units of nucleotide pyrophosphatase for 2 h at room temperature. The resulting mixture was purified on the 15 × 0.4-cm Spherex column: 81:19, H2O:CH3CN + 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid, 1 ml/min flow rate, and retention times for FMN peptides, 13.8 min (major peak, 12 nmol) and 9.2 min (minor peak). Treatment of the major flavin peptide with alkaline phosphatase, followed by HPLC analysis, confirmed that it contained FMN. Half the sample was lyophilized and not further treated. The remainder was lyophilized, dissolved in 200 μl of H2O in a stoppered tube, flushed with pure argon, and 20 μl of a 2 mg/ml sodium dithionite solution added. The yellow color bleached immediately on adding the dithionite, indicating that the flavin had been reduced. The solution was incubated under argon for 2 h, and the resulting FMN-free peptide (4.McIntire W.S. Edmondson D.E. Hopper D.J. Singer T.P. Biochemistry. 1981; 20: 3068-3075Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar) was purified on the Spherex column in the same manner as the previous step: retention time of 24 min. All HPLC runs were monitored with a Hewlett-Packard (North Hollywood, CA) 1040 M, Series II diode array detector. The peptic flavin peptides, with and without flavin attached, were sequenced in the laboratory of Professor Michael J. Barber, University of South Florida, Tampa, FL.Steady-state Kinetic AssaysFor these assays, reduction of PES by p-cresol-reduced PCMH was monitored at 600 nm due to the subsequent reduction of 2,6-dichlorophenol indophenol. The assays were done in 50 mM Tris HCl, pH 7.6, I = 0.05 at 25°C(32.McIntire W.S. Hopper D.J. Singer T.P. Biochemistry. 1987; 26: 4107-4117Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). In all assays, the sodium 2,6-dichlorophenol indophenol concentration was 92 μM. The concentration of PES was varied from 0.6 to 3.6 mM, and the concentration of p-cresol was varied from 5.25 μM to 0.6 mM. As in past studies with PCMH purified from P. putida(32.McIntire W.S. Hopper D.J. Singer T.P. Biochemistry. 1987; 26: 4107-4117Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar), steady-state kinetic assays with the various forms of recombinant enzyme produced parallel 1/v versus 1/[PES] plots for various p-cresol concentrations, and parallel 1/v versus 1/[p-cresol] plots for different PES concentrations. These patterns are indicative of ping-pong type kinetic behavior. The steady-state parameters reported in Table 1 are the true kcat and Km values for each substrate.Tabled 1 Open table in a new tab Covalent Flavinylation KineticsThese reactions were done in 16 mM potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.0, at 30°C. The reaction mixtures contained varying concentrations of apo-PchF2, PchC, and FAD. Because there was a very slow linear increase in absorbance when apo-PchF2 and PchC were mixed in the absence of FAD, the reactions were initiated by adding apo-PchF2 last. The concentrations of apo-PchF2 solutions were determined by the method of Lowry et al.(33.Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), the concentrations of FAD solutions from ∊450= 11.3 mM-1 cm-1, and the concentrations of PchC solutions from Δ∊redox = 19 mM-1 cm-1 at 552 nm. For the kinetic assays, the reduction of the heme in PchC was monitored at 552 or 417 nm (Δ∊redox = 91 mM-1 cm-1).To determine the stoichiometry of the flavinylation reaction, apo-PchF2 (3.21 μM), PchC (22.8 μM), D-glucose (61 mM), glucose oxidase (1 unit), and catalase (7.4 μg, 1.6 units) were mixed in an anaerobic cuvette. The last three components were included for O2 scavenging. A side arm contained dried FAD (114 μM when mixed with the other components). The air in the cuvette was carefully exchanged with several pump-purge steps using pure argon. The anaerobic reaction was initiated by mixing in the FAD and monitoring at 552 nm. The change in A552 was used to determine the amount of PchC reduced in the experiment. The amount of reduced PchC formed in the reaction was also determined by anaerobic back-titration with a 0.510 mM solution of K3Fe(CN)6.X-ray Structural AnalysisThe x-ray structure of PCMH, form A from P. putida 9869, was initially solved at 3.0 Å resolution by the multiple isomorphous replacement method using the known amino acid sequence for the cytochrome subunit and polyalanine for PchF(34.Mathews F.S. Chen Z.-w. Bellamy H.D. McIntire W.S. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 238-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). The deduced amino acid sequence for PchF (18.Kim J. Fuller J.H. Cecchini G. McIntire W.S. J. Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 6349-6361.Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) was subsequently fit to the electron density map and the structure of the native enzyme was partially refined to 2.5 Å resolution.A crystal of PCMH was soaked in a solution of 25 mMp-cresol, from which data were recorded to 3.0 Å resolution, and the structure was refined directly using the coordinates from the native structure. The current R factors (Σ∊Fo∊ - ∊Fc∊/Σ∊Fo∊) for the native and p-cresol derivatives are 0.219 and 0.211, with root mean square deviations of 0.018 and 0.008 Å from the ideal bond lengths, and 3.98° and 1.66° from the ideal bond angles. Further refinements of both structures are in progress and a manuscript with complete details is under preparation. ( (2)F. S. Mathews, L. Cunane, Z.-w. Chen, N. Shamala, J. Kim, J. H. Fuller, and W.

https://openalex.org/W1980420481,"Abstract The carboxyl terminus of G protein α subunits plays an important role in receptor recognition. To identify the amino acids that participate in this interaction, COOH-terminal mutants of α (the transducin α subunit) were expressed in vitro and analyzed for their ability to interact with rhodopsin and to bind guanine nucleotide. Gly-348, the reported site of a β turn, was replaced with other neutral amino acids without severely affecting rhodopsin binding. However, proline substitution abolished rhodopsin interaction, suggesting that flexibility is important at this site. A comparison between C347Y, which lost both rhodopsin and guanine nucleotide binding, and a mutant substituted with α sequence (D346E/C347Y/G348N/F350V), in which guanine nucleotide binding was restored, implies that distinct motifs maintain the structure of the α subunit and are necessary for selective interaction with receptors. Surprisingly, mutants L344A, L349A, F350stop, and stop351A demonstrated a parallel loss of rhodopsin and guanine nucleotide binding. Altered profiles of L344A and F350stop on sucrose density gradients indicate that these mutants may undergo denaturation. The equivalent of αL344A generated in α and α did not show such a severe loss of guanine nucleotide binding, revealing that the α carboxyl terminus is unique in its susceptibility to changes in amino acid sequence."
https://openalex.org/W2007705662,"To analyze the mechanisms by which estrogen receptor (ER) activity is suppressed by dominant negative mutants, we examined the role of specific ER functions and domains in transcriptional repression. We previously described three transcriptionally inactive human ER mutants (the frameshift mutant S554fs, the point mutant L540Q, and the truncated receptor ER1-530), which act as effective dominant negative mutants, inhibiting the activity of wild type ER when they are co-expressed in mammalian cells. After additional mutational modifications, the ability of the ER mutants to suppress the activity of wild type ER was analyzed in cotransfection assays of the dominant negative mutants and wild type ER and an estrogen-responsive reporter gene (2ERE-TATA-CAT or 2ERE-pS2-CAT). Eliminating the ability of the three dominant negative mutants to bind to estrogen response element (ERE) DNA (by introducing three point mutations in their DNA binding domains) dramatically reduced, but did not completely abolish, the dominant negative activity of the ER mutants. The mutation G521R, which rendered the three mutants incapable of binding estradiol, also reduced, but did not abolish, their dominant negative activity. Immunoprecipitation with monoclonal or flag antibodies followed by Western blotting demonstrated that each of the original dominant negative ER mutants formed heterodimers with wild type ER. Rendering the dominant negative mutants dimerization deficient by the mutation L507R strongly reduced, but did not eliminate, their dominant negative activity. Deletion of the N-terminal A/B domain resulted in the nearly complete loss of inhibitory activity of the three dominant negative mutants. However, these double mutants retained their ability to heterodimerize with wild type ER, suggesting that dominant negative interference also occurs at an additional step beyond dimerization. Our data indicate that competition for ERE binding, formation of inactive heterodimers, and specific transcriptional silencing can all contribute to the dominant negative phenotype and that these receptors suppress the activity of wild type ER by acting at multiple steps in the ER-response pathway.

Chitosan is a polysaccharide consisting of β-1,4-linked D-glucosamine residues, partially substituted with N-acetyl groups. This polymer can be considered as a partly deacetylated derivative of chitin. In nature, chitosan is widely distributed as a component of the cell wall in Zygomycetes (1.Davis L.L. Bartnicki-Garcia S. Biochemistry. 1984; 23: 1065-1073Crossref Scopus (123) Google Scholar) and of insect cuticles, even if not being abundant. In the last years, the chitosan itself as well as the products derived from its hydrolysis received much attention because of many potential applications in biomedical, agricultural, and environmental sciences(2.Sandford P.A. Skjåk-Bræk G. Anthonsen T. Sandford P. Chitin and Chitosan. Elsevier Applied Science, London1989: 51-69Google Scholar). A number of enzymes such as chitinases, lysozymes, and chitosanases can hydrolyze partially N-acetylated chitosan by an endo-mechanism. Chitosanases were described in prokaryotes, fungi(3.Monaghan R.L. Eveleigh D.E. Tewari R.P. Reese E.T. Nat. New Biol. 1973; 245: 78-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar), and more recently in plants(4.El Ouakfaoui S. Asselin A. Phytochemistry. 1992; 31: 1513-1518Crossref Scopus (37) Google Scholar). The distinction between chitinases and chitosanases became elucidated with the works of several groups that analyzed the structure of the hydrolysis products generated from chitosan by various enzymes of bacterial origin. They have shown that chitinases cleave specifically the N-acetyl-β-D-glucosaminidic bonds in partially N-acetylated chitosan (5.Mitsutomi M. Ohtakara A. Fukamizo T. Goto S. Agric. Biol. Chem. 1990; 54: 871-877Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 6.Ohtakara A. Matsunaga H. Mitsutomi M. Agric. Biol. Chem. 1990; 54: 3191-3199Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar) while chitosanases are specific toward the β-D-glucosaminidic bonds(7.Sakai K. Katsumi R. Isobe A. Nanjo F. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1991; 1079: 65-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 8.Izume M. Nagae S. Kawagishi H. Mitsutomi M. Ohtakara A. Biosci. Biotechnol. Biochem. 1992; 56: 448-453Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Recently, these two groups of enzymes were delimited more precisely(9.Fukamizo T. Ohkawa T. Ikeda Y. Goto S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1205: 183-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Chitosanases were defined as enzymes able to hydrolyze all kinds of linkages in chitosan except the GlcNAc-GlcNAc bond, while chitinases hydrolyzed only GlcNAc-GlcNAc and GlcNAc-GlcN bonds. The cloning and sequencing of the first two chitosanase genes from Bacillus circulans MH-K1 (10.Ando A. Noguchi K. Yanagi M. Shinoyama H. Kagawa Y. Hirata H. Yabuki M. Fujii T. J. Gen. Appl. Microbiol. 1992; 38: 135-144Crossref Scopus (38) Google Scholar) and from Streptomyces sp. N174 (11.Fink D. Boucher I. Denis F. Brzezinski R. Biotechnol.

Gene (Amst.). 1994; 140: 103-107Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar) allowed the comparison of their deduced amino acid sequences with those of known chitinases of plant, fungal, or bacterial origin (reviewed in (13.Perrakis A.

J. 1993; 293: 781-788Crossref PubMed Scopus (1768) Google Scholar)). While all the known chitinases fell into two classes (classes I and II as defined in (13.Perrakis A. Wilson K.S. Chet I. Oppenheim A.B. Vorgias C.E. Muzzarelli R.A.A. Chitin Enzymology. European Chitin Society, Ancona, Italy1993: 217-232Google Scholar) or, respectively, families 19 and 18 of glycosyl hydrolases(14.Henrissat B. Bairoch A. Biochem. J. 1993; 293: 781-788Crossref PubMed Scopus (1768) Google Scholar)) no homologies were found between the chitosanases and either class I or class II chitinases(10.Ando A. Noguchi K. Yanagi M. Shinoyama H. Kagawa Y. Hirata H. Yabuki M. Fujii T. J. Gen. Appl. Microbiol. 1992; 38: 135-144Crossref Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 12.Masson J-Y. Denis F. Brzezinski R.

On the other hand, both chitosanases showed extensive homologies in their N-terminal segments(12.Masson J-Y. Denis F. Brzezinski R. Gene (Amst.). 1994; 140: 103-107Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Two more recently available sequences, that of chitosanase from Nocardioides sp. N106 (15.Masson J.-Y. Boucher I. Neugebauer W.A. Ramotar D. Brzezinski R. Microbiology. 1995; 141: 2629-2635Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar) and a partial amino acid sequence of chitosanase from Nocardioides sp. K-01, obtained by direct sequencing of polypeptide fragments(16.Ando A. Morosawa H. Kobayashi T. Okajima S. Shinoyama H. Fujii T. Nakanishi M. Muzzarelli R.A.A. Chitin Enzymology. European Chitin Society, Ancona, Italy1993: 283-288Google Scholar), were found to be highly homologous to the Streptomyces sp. N174 chitosanase. All these biochemical and molecular data showed that chitosanases are distinct from other chitosan-hydrolyzing enzymes. Thus, they were classified into family 46 of glycosyl hydrolases. ( (1)B. Henrissat, personal communication.) So far, no information concerning essential catalytic residues is available for this enzyme family. However, in the case of glycosyl hydrolases, most, if not all, catalytic amino acids are aspartate or glutamate residues conserved in regions sharing amino acid sequence similarities(14.Henrissat B. Bairoch A. Biochem. J. 1993; 293: 781-788Crossref PubMed Scopus (1768) Google Scholar, 17.Sinnott M.L. Chem. Rev. 1990; 90: 1171-1202Crossref Scopus (1490) Google Scholar). The N-terminal chitosanase region (the only one having significant homology with the chitosanase of B. circulans MH-K1 and those from actinomycetes) includes 5 Asp or Glu residues conserved in all the four known sequences. Here we present some properties of the mutated forms of the Streptomyces sp. N174 chitosanase in which these carboxylic residues were modified by site-directed mutagenesis of the csn gene. Escherichia coli JM109 (endA1, thi, gyrA96, hsdR17 (rK−, mK−), relA1, supE44, Δ(lac-proAB), [F′, traD36, proAB, lacIqZΔM15]) obtained from Promega, Madison, WI and Streptomyces lividans TK24 (obtained from D. A. Hopwood) were used for cloning experiments. The E. coli strain BMH 71-18 (thi, supE, Δ(lac-proAB), [mutS::Tn10] [F′, proAB, lacIqZΔM15]), deficient in mismatch repair and used as transformation host after in vitro mutagenesis, and the vectors pALTER-1, used for site-directed mutagenesis, and pSP70, used for subcloning of mutated DNA segments, were obtained from Promega. The shuttle vector pFD666 (used for expression of wild-type and mutated genes in S. lividans) and the plasmid pRL270 (a pFD666 derivative carrying the chitosanase-encoding gene, csn, from Streptomyces sp. N174) were described previously(18.Denis F. Brzezinski R. Gene (Amst.). 1992; 111: 115-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 19.Masson J-Y. Li T. Boucher I. Brzezinski R. Muzzarelli R.A.A. Chitin Enzymology. European Chitin Society, Ancona, Italy1993: 423-430Google Scholar). Extraction of plasmid DNA and preparation and transformation of streptomycete protoplasts were as described(20.Hopwood D.A. Bibb M.J. Chater K.F. Kieser T. Bruton C.J. Kieser H.M. Lydiate D.J. Smith C.P. Ward J.M. Schrempf H. Genetic Manipulation of Streptomyces, A Laboratory Manual. The John Innes Foundation, Norwich, United Kingdom1985Google Scholar). Standard methods (21.Sambrook J. Fritsch E.E. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning, A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar) were used for genetic manipulation of E. coli. The mutants were constructed using a commercial kit, the Altered Sites system supplied by Promega. The vector used in this method is pALTER-1, in which we subcloned the wild-type csn gene, to obtain pALTER-csn (Fig. 1). The oligonucleotides (cited in Table 1) were synthesized using the Oligo 1000 DNA synthesizer (Beckman Instruments). The mutated ScaI-SacII segments were sequenced (22.Sanger F. Nicklen S. Coulson A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 5463-5467Crossref PubMed Scopus (52610) Google Scholar) using the oligonucleotide 5′-CTGGACGAGTTCCAGCA-3' as primer.Tabled 1 Open table in a new tab Subcloning strategy is illustrated in Fig. 1. The pALTER-1-derivatives carrying the mutated csn genes were digested with ScaI and SacII. The resulting 0.4-kilobase segments (encoding the N-terminal amino acids of the chitosanase) were purified from agarose electrophoresis gels and ligated to a pSP70 derivative carrying the wild-type csn gene and digested with EcoRV and SacII. By such a procedure, only the mutated segments that were entirely sequenced were transferred into subclones. To express the mutated genes in S. lividans TK24, the pSP70 derivatives carrying the mutated csn genes were digested with BglII and XhoI; the resulting 1.6-kilobase segments (encoding the mutated chitosanases) were purified from agarose electrophoresis gels and ligated to the pFD666 vector digested with BamHI and XhoI. The resulting plasmids (pIB-D6N, pIB-E22Q, pIB-E22D, pIB-E22A, pIB-E36Q, pIB-D37N, pIB-D37E, pIB-D40N, and pIB-D40E) were used to transform S. lividans TK24. The ten S. lividans TK24 clones carrying, respectively, the pRL270 plasmid or one of the nine pIB plasmids, were grown in 50 ml of tryptic soy broth (Difco) supplemented with 50 μg ml-1 kanamycin. Each culture was centrifuged (10 min, 800 × g), and 5 ml of the mycelial pellet were used for inoculation of 500 ml of glucosamine medium consisting of 1% D-glucosamine in minimal salts(11.Fink D. Boucher I. Denis F. Brzezinski R. Biotechnol. Lett. 1991; 13: 845-850Crossref Scopus (19) Google Scholar). After 72 h of growth at 30°C, the culture was filtered, and the filtrate was adjusted to pH 4.5 with acetic acid. Then the conductivity of the filtrate was adjusted to 9 millisiemens with distilled water, and the solution was loaded onto a 65 × 16-mm column of S-Sepharose Fast Flow (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.) previously equilibrated with 50 ml of 50 mM sodium acetate buffer, pH 4.5 (buffer A) followed by 50 ml of buffer A and 60 mM NaCl. The adjusted culture filtrate was loaded on the column through a hollow fiber on-line filter (MediaKap-5, 0.2 μm, Microgon). The column was then washed successively with 25 ml of buffer A, 60 mM NaCl and 20 ml of buffer A, 0.22 M NaCl. Elution of chitosanase was done with 20 ml of buffer A and 0.27 M NaCl, collecting 2-ml fractions. The five most active fractions were pooled and further purified by size-exclusion chromatography as described(23.Boucher I. Dupuy A. Vidal P. Neugebauer W.A. Brzezinski R. Appl. Microbiol. Biotechnol. 1992; 38: 188-193Crossref Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Spectra were obtained on a Jasco J-600 spectropolarimeter at 20-22°C. Four spectra were averaged and the data smoothed by the Jasco software. The instrument was calibrated with ammonium (+)-10-camphorsulfonate. Peptide concentrations were calculated from the absorption at 280 nm, using the coefficient of 30,300 M-1, calculated from the amino acid composition of chitosanase. Spectra were measured at peptide concentrations between 0.1 and 0.2 mg ml-1, and data are expressed per mol of residue. Chitosanase activity was determined by measuring the quantity of reducing sugars generated by hydrolysis of soluble chitosan. The substrate for this assay was chitosan (Sigma, d.a. ( (2)The abbreviations used are: d.a.degree of N-acetylation(GlcN)nβ-1, 4-linked oligosaccharide of GlcN with a polymerization degree of nHPLChigh performance liquid chromatography.) = 0.21), dissolved in 50 mM sodium acetate buffer, pH 5.5. Highly deacetylated chitosan (Katakura Chikkarin Co., d.a. <0.01) was also used in some experiments. degree of N-acetylation β-1, 4-linked oligosaccharide of GlcN with a polymerization degree of n high performance liquid chromatography. For the determination of specific activity, reaction mixtures contained 0.8 mg ml-1 chitosan. Incubation was for 10 min at 37°C. The reaction was terminated by transferring 200 μl of the reaction mixture into 400 μl of a 1% solution of p-hydroxybenzoic acid hydrazide in 0.5 N NaOH(24.Lever M. Anal. Biochem. 1972; 47: 273-279Crossref PubMed Scopus (721) Google Scholar). After heating for 5 min at 95°C, cooling into an ice bath, and pelleting of the unhydrolyzed chitosan by centrifugation (5 min, 800 × g), the reducing sugars were determined by reading the optical density at 405 nm, and comparison with a standard curve was prepared with D-glucosamine. This method was adapted for microtiter plates. One unit of chitosanase was defined as the amount of enzyme releasing 1 μmol min-1D-glucosamine equivalents. Protein concentration was determined from the absorbance at 280 nm. Kinetic constants were determined on chitosan (Sigma). 0.5-ml reactions were set up containing from 0.02 to 0.8 mg ml-1 chitosan. Wild-type chitosanase was used at 1.2 μM concentration. Mutant proteins were used at concentrations that gave the same overall hydrolysis level as the wild-type control. Liberation of reducing sugars was measured as above. Km and kcat values were obtained from direct linear plots (25.Eisenthal R. Cornish-Bowden A. Biochem. J. 1974; 139: 715-720Crossref PubMed Scopus (1237) Google Scholar) using the program COSY (provided on Internet by M. Eberhard, Biozentrum, Basel). The substrate, (GlcN)6, was dissolved in 50 mM sodium acetate buffer, pH 5.5, to give 16.6 mM solution. The enzyme (0.14-0.19 nmol) was added to 0.5 ml of the substrate solution, and the reaction mixture was incubated at 40°C. After an appropriate reaction time, a portion of the reaction mixture was withdrawn and mixed with an equal volume of 0.1 N NaOH in order to terminate the enzymatic reaction. The reaction products thus obtained were analyzed by HPLC on a gel filtration column of TSK-GEL G2000PW (0.5 × 600 mm, Tosoh) using a Shimadzu RID-2A differential refractometer. The elution was done with 0.5 M NaCl at room temperature and a flow rate of 0.3 ml min-1. (GlcN)n product concentrations were calculated from peak areas in the HPLC profiles using the standard curves obtained from pure saccharide solutions. Mutational analysis coupled with kinetic and structural studies has proven to be a valuable approach for identification of amino acid residues involved in the catalytic function of glycosyl hydrolases(26.Svensson B. S⊘gaard M. J. Biotechnol. 1993; 29: 1-37Crossref Scopus (84) Google Scholar). In order to determine the carboxylic residues that were possible candidates for such function in chitosanase, we profited from the rather unusual homology between the first two chitosanases for which the primary sequences were determined. The chitosanases from B. circulans MH-K1 (27.Yabuki M. Uchiyama A. Suzuki K. Ando A. Fujii T. J. Gen. Appl. Microbiol. 1988; 34: 255-270Crossref Scopus (83) Google Scholar) and from Streptomyces sp. N174 (23.Boucher I. Dupuy A. Vidal P. Neugebauer W.A. Brzezinski R. Appl. Microbiol. Biotechnol. 1992; 38: 188-193Crossref Scopus (91) Google Scholar) are similar in several ways. Both are alkaline proteins of similar Mr (27,000-29,000); both hydrolyze preferentially chitosans with a low acetylation degree by an endo-mechanism, generating end products of similar length; and both are inactive against chitin and carboxymethylcellulose. However, inspection of their primary sequences reveals that significant homology can be found only for a 50-residue-long box situated at the N terminus of the mature proteins (Fig. 2a). Only five carboxylic amino acids were found to be conserved in these two sequences, making them obvious targets for mutagenesis. These residues were found to be conserved in two more recently published chitosanase sequences from two actinomycete strains, members of the genus Nocardioides, isolated independently in Japan and Canada (Fig. 2b). The csn gene was modified by site-directed mutagenesis using E. coli as cloning host. However, neither the wild-type nor the mutated chitosanase forms could be obtained at satisfactory levels from periplasmic extracts of E. coli. For this reason, all the mutated genes were transferred into the pFD666 vector and expressed in S. lividans. The chitosanase activities of mutants were first estimated from clearing halos around colonies of S. lividans transformants growing on mineral medium with chitosan as the sole carbon source (Fig. 3). Clearing was absent around colonies carrying E22Q, E22D, E22A, or D40N mutations and was extremely reduced around the colony carrying the D40E mutation. The intensities of clearing of the other mutants were close to the wild-type control. In previous works, a medium with chitosan as the main carbon source was used for chitosanase production by recombinant S. lividans strains in shaken cultures. However, we have found that this medium is inefficient for the production of mutated forms of chitosanase that have lost their enzymatic activity (data not shown). Thus, a new medium composition with D-glucosamine as sole carbon source was used. In this medium, mutated chitosanases were produced almost as efficiently as the wild-type enzyme (data not shown). Chitosanase, protein, and protease levels as well as conductivity were monitored every 12 h in culture supernatants. Usually, the culture supernatant was recovered by filtration once the total protein level reached 150-175 μg ml-1, while conductivity was not higher than 10-12 millisiemens. Wild-type and mutant chitosanases were purified to homogeneity (as judged by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and Coomassie Blue staining). Western blot using an anti-chitosanase rabbit serum showed that all the purified enzymes reacted in similar way with antibodies (not shown). Relative specific activities, determined with standard chitosan (d.a. = 0. 21), highly deacetylated chitosan (d.a. <0.01), and (GlcN)6 as substrates are shown in Table 2. The relative activities determined by using chitosan as substrate appear to be consistent with those determined by (GlcN)6. These determinations confirmed what was seen on the plate assay; mutants of residues 6 or 36 had nearly normal chitosanase activity, while mutants of residues 22 or 40 were severely affected in their activity. The activities of mutants of residue 37 were reduced two to six times as compared with the wild type.Tabled 1 Open table in a new tab Kinetic parameters (Table 3) were determined under conditions that corresponded to the optimum previously found for the wild-type enzyme(23.Boucher I. Dupuy A. Vidal P. Neugebauer W.A. Brzezinski R. Appl. Microbiol. Biotechnol. 1992; 38: 188-193Crossref Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Substitutions of the Glu-22 residue drastically impaired the catalytic activity. The kcat values of mutants E22Q and E22A were, respectively, and of the wild-type chitosanase. Thus Glu-22 seems to be essential for catalytic activity and could not be efficiently substituted by an Asp residue, as the kcat of the E22D mutant had only 0.4% of the value of the wild type.Tabled 1 Open table in a new tab Substitutions of Asp-40 also had important effects on activity, even if less drastic than for Glu-22. The catalytic constants of mutants D40N and D40E were only 0.2 and 0.8% of the value for wild-type chitosanase, while Km was essentially unchanged. This aspartic acid could not be substituted efficiently by a glutamic acid. Thus, Asp-40 seems also to be essential for catalytic activity. In contrast with the above residues, the substitution of Asp-37 with glutamic acid led to an enzyme less active than the Asn-substituted mutant. Both these mutants also had a slightly higher Km value than the wild type. However, considering the overall moderate effect of these substitutions, the Asp-37 residue cannot be considered as essential for chitosanase activity. The reduced activity of chitosanases mutated in Glu-22 and Asp-40 residues could have been the result of incorrect folding of the mutated proteins. CD spectra in the far UV region are commonly used to probe for alterations in tertiary structure, especially if aromatic residues are near the mutated residues in the three-dimensional structure. The near and far UV spectra for the wild-type chitosanase are shown in Fig. 4. The spectra were identical, within experimental error, for all the mutants reported here. The profiles of products generated from (GlcN)6 were analyzed for mutants in position 37 or 40 (Fig. 5). From (GlcN)6, the wild-type chitosanase produced (GlcN)3 abundantly and (GlcN)2 and (GlcN)4 in lesser amounts. The product distribution was not changed even when each of the mutant chitosanases was used instead. Only the overall reaction rate was affected by each of the mutations. If some modification is introduced at a subsite apart from the catalytic site, the binding mode of oligosaccharide to the chitosanase should be affected resulting in a different product distribution in the time course(28.Fukamizo T. Goto S. Torikata T. Araki T. Agric. Biol. Chem. 1989; 53: 2641-2651Google Scholar). Thus, the results suggest that Asp-37 and Asp-40 participate in the enzymatic reaction at or near the catalytic site. This is compatible with the proposed function of catalytic residue for Asp-40. Asp-37 should participate in the saccharide binding near the catalytic site or in some assistance of the catalytic dyad, Glu-22 and Asp-40. The analysis of chitosanase from Streptomyces sp. N174 by site-directed mutagenesis revealed that two carboxylic residues, Glu-22 and Asp-40, localized within the conserved N-terminal region are essential for catalytic activity. The other residues studied here, Asp-6, Glu-36, and Asp-37, behaved as if they were not essential and, most probably, will be found to be not strictly conserved as more chitosanase sequences will be determined."

https://openalex.org/W2172278995,"Two non-amplified esterases were purified from the insecticide-susceptible Pel SS strain of Culex quinquefasciatus. These were the two major esterase activity peaks in this strain. The two corresponding amplified carboxylesterases, Estα2 and Estβ2, involved in organophosphate sequestration were purified from two resistant C. quinquefasciatus strains. The Pel SS esterases were significantly less reactive with the organophosphates than those from the resistant strains. One of the Pel SS esterases was electrophoretically identical to amplified Culex Estβ1. However, it differed kinetically, and in its nucleotide and predicted amino acid sequences from the two characterized amplified Estβ1s, it is classified as Estβ13. Restriction fragment analysis suggested Pel SS has only one Estα and one Estβ gene, while the resistant Pel RR has both amplified and non-amplified forms of Estα and Estβ. The EcoRI fragments for both Pel SS esterases were distinct from those of the amplified Estα21, Estβ21, or Estβ11&2. An esterase with the same size EcoRI fragment as Estβ13 was also present in Pel RR. This and restriction enzyme fragment analysis of C. quinquefasciatus field populations suggest that variability of the susceptible alleles may be lower than previously suggested. A non-amplified Estα with a unique EcoRI band was present in Pel RR. The previous esterase purification procedures may not have separated these amplified and non-amplified alleles.

INTRODUCTIONThe use of pesticides, both directly and indirectly against the mosquito Culex quinquefasciatus, has resulted in the selection of broad spectrum organophosphate and carbamate resistance. The most commonly selected resistance mechanism is the increased activity of Estα2 and Estβ2 carboxylesterases (EC 3.1.1.1) (A2 and B2 esterases on an earlier classification)(1.Vaughan A.

Classification of these esterases is based on their preferences for α- or β-naphthyl acetate, their mobility on native polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE), ( (1)The abbreviations used are: PAGEpolyacrylamide gel electrophoresiskbkilobase(s)pNPAp-nitrophenyl acetatepNPHp-nitrophenyl hexanoate.) and their nucleotide sequence(1.Vaughan A.

The overproduction of the Estα21 and a series of Estβ esterases is due to gene amplification(1.Vaughan A. Hemingway J. J. Biol.

Identical EcoRI restriction fragment sizes of the amplified Estβ2 from resistant C. quinquefasciatus worldwide has been reported, in contrast to a high level of variability in Estβ from insecticide-susceptible mosquitoes(9.Raymond M. Callaghan A. Fort P. Pasteur N. Nature. 1991; 350: 151-153Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar). A cDNA with 97% identity to Estβ21 has been cloned from an insecticide susceptible strain (Pel SS) of C. quinquefasciatus from Sri Lanka(8.Vaughan A. Rodriguez M. Hemingway J. Biochem. J. 1995; 305: 651-658Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar); however, the protein has not been characterized. After native starch or PAGE of homogenates of individual resistant Culex larvae of the amplified Estα2/Estβ2 esterase phenotype, two electromorphs can be visualized. Under the same conditions, no esterase bands are visible in homogenates of susceptible insects. This has lead to the suggestion that the susceptible insects have null alleles for these loci(10.Georghiou G.P. Pasteur N. J. Econ. Entomol. 1978; 71: 201-205Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar).Here, we report the purification and characterization of both an α- and a β-naphthyl acetate-specific esterase from the Pel SS strain of mosquito and compare these at a biochemical and basic molecular level to the elevated esterases Estα21, Estβ12, and Estβ21. The role of the amplified esterases in resistance is sequestration, which is rapid binding and slow turnover of insecticides (11.Ketterman A.J. Jayawardena K.G.I. Hemingway J. Biochem.

The current study elucidates the relative efficiencies of the purified esterases from a susceptible and two further resistant strains at binding the carbamates and biologically active oxon analogues of the organophosphorus insecticides. Characterization of the amplified and non-amplified esterases will facilitate future site-directed mutagenesis studies on the essential amino acid residues involved in the enzyme-insecticide interaction.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESFour mosquito strains of C. quinquefasciatus were used. Pel was established from a large (>1,000) sample of larvae collected from Peliyagoda (Sri Lanka) in 1984. The population was heterogeneous for insecticide resistance, and both Pel SS and Pel RR were derived from this strain. The insecticide-susceptible Pel SS strain was obtained by selection and pooling of multiple single families for low esterase activity over three generations. The resistant Pel RR strain was selected from the Pel strain by mass larval selection with temephos(2.Peiris H.T.R. Hemingway J. Bull. Entomol. Res. 1990; 80: 49-55Crossref Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 3.Peiris H.T.R. Hemingway J. Bull. Entomol. Res. 1990; 80: 453-457Crossref Scopus (29) Google Scholar). The Muheza strain was collected from Tanzania in 1987 and maintained under intermittent chlorpyrifos selection. SPerm was collected from Jeddah (Saudi Arabia) in 1989. It was selected for 20 generations with permethrin and then intermittently with malathion and temephos(15.Hemingway J. Callaghan A. Amin A.M. Med. Vet. Entomol. 1990; 4: 275-282Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). The three resistant strains both have the elevated esterases Estα2 and Estβ2.Field collections, each of >1000 larvae, were made in six suburbs of Colombo (Sri Lanka) in 1994. The areas included Peliyagoda, where the 1984 collection had been made. The frequency of the amplified esterases in these field populations was analyzed by nonspecific esterase assays of 100-200 larvae(3.Peiris H.T.R. Hemingway J. Bull. Entomol. Res. 1990; 80: 453-457Crossref Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Batches of 100 larvae of the remaining insects were used for DNA extraction.Esterases were copurified from the resistant and susceptible strains to ensure that any differences in the enzymes seen between this and previous studies were not due to minor variations in our purification and kinetic determination procedures over time.Q-Sepharose Fast Flow, phenyl-Sepharose Fast Flow, PD-10 columns, Nap-5 columns, and Nick spin columns were purchased from Pharmacia (United Kingdom). Hydroxyapatite and the protein assay kit were purchased from Bio-Rad (UK). The p-chloromercuribenzoate was from Pierce (Chester, UK). Biochemicals were purchased from Sigma (UK) except as stated. The diethyl (dimethoxythiophosphorylthio) succinate (malaoxon, 87.5% pure), diethyl-4-nitrophenyl phosphate (paraoxon, 97.4% pure), and 2-isopropoxyphenyl methylcarbamate (propoxur, 97% pure) were purchased from British Greyhound (Birkenhead, Merseyside, UK). The O,O-diethyl O-3,5,6-trichloro-2-pyridyl phosphorothioate (chlorpyrifosoxon, analytical grade) and O,O-dimethyl-O′-4-nitro-m-tolyl phosphorothioate (fenitrooxon, 98.3% pure) were gifts from Dow Elanco (Midland) and Sumitomo Chemical Co. (Osaka, Japan), respectively.Enzyme activities were assayed with the substrate p-nitrophenyl acetate (pNPA) (1 mM) in 50 mM phosphate buffer (pH 7.4) at 22°C. The protein concentration was estimated by the method of Bradford (16.Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (213288) Google Scholar) using bovine serum albumin as the standard protein.Purification of CarboxylesterasesBatches of 4th instar larvae were homogenized and centrifuged at 15,000 × g for 5 min, and the supernatant was taken. Carboxylesterases Estα and Estβ were purified several times from numerous batches of larvae of each strain by sequential column chromatography and preparative electrophoresis as described previously (12.Karunaratne S.H.P.P. Jayawardena K.G.I. Hemingway J. Ketterman A.J. Biochem. J. 1993; 294: 575-579Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar, 17.Ketterman A.J. Karunaratne S.H.P.P. Jayawardena K.G.I. Hemingway J. Pest. Biochem. Physiol. 1993; 47: 142-148Crossref Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Final enzyme preparations were homogeneous as determined by SDS-PAGE. Crude homogenates for the insecticide interaction experiments were prepared in ice-cold 50 mM phosphate buffer (pH 7.4) with 5% (v/v) glycerol and 10 mMDL-dithiothreitol.All specific activities are given in units/mg of protein. A unit corresponds to the hydrolysis of 1 μmol of substrate in 1 min under the assay conditions used. Kinetic constants were determined from at least three experiments for each substrate or inhibitor using enzymes from several different purifications. For the inhibition kinetics, stopped time inhibition assays were performed using pNPA or p-nitrophenyl hexanoate (pNPH) as the substrate. Insecticide stock solutions were prepared in acetonitrile and diluted in phosphate buffer (pH 7.4). The purified enzyme was incubated with a series of concentrations of the test insecticide (acetonitrile concentration of the medium never exceeded 1% (v/v)) for fixed time intervals. Residual activity was determined from the rate of substrate hydrolysis.Inhibitor concentrations were usually in large excess so that linear pseudo-first order kinetics were obtained. The bimolecular rate constants for the formation of acylated enzyme (ka) were derived as described previously(18.Aldridge W.N. Reiner E. Enzyme Inhibitors as Substrates. Frontiers of Biology, North Holland, Amsterdam1972Google Scholar). If inhibitor concentration could not be maintained in large excess, ka values were determined in the presence of substrate(19.Main A.R. Dauterman W.C. Nature. 1963; 198: 551-553Crossref Scopus (45) Google Scholar). To minimize the effect of the reversible enzyme-substrate complex on the rate of acylation, the substrate concentration was maintained at a very low concentration so that the [S]/Km ratio was always less than 0.5(18.Aldridge W.N. Reiner E. Enzyme Inhibitors as Substrates. Frontiers of Biology, North Holland, Amsterdam1972Google Scholar).Electrophoresis of native protein samples was performed in 7.5% acrylamide gels in Tris borate buffer, pH 8.0(20.Davis B.J. Ann. Natl. Acad. Med. Sci. 1964; 121: 404-427Crossref Scopus (15920) Google Scholar). The gels were stained for esterase activity with 0.04% (w/v) α- and β-naphthyl acetate and 0.1% (w/v) Fast Blue B in 100 mM phosphate buffer, pH 7.4. SDS-PAGE was performed with standard proteins using 4-20% acrylamide gradient gels in Tris/glycine/SDS buffer, pH 8.3(21.Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (205998) Google Scholar).Genomic DNA StudiesDNA was extracted(8.Vaughan A. Rodriguez M. Hemingway J. Biochem. J. 1995; 305: 651-658Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar), precipitated with ethanol, resuspended in a small volume of TE, and stored at 4°C until used for Southern blotting. Pel RR Estβ21 and Estα21 esterase cDNA fragments (1.Vaughan A. Hemingway J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 17044-17049Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar, 8.Vaughan A. Rodriguez M. Hemingway J. Biochem. J. 1995; 305: 651-658Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar) were used as probes to determine the haplotype of the esterases in each laboratory strain or field collection of mosquitoes. Genomic DNA (10 μg) was digested to completion with EcoRI, HindIII, or BamHI and separated on 0.8% (w/v) agarose gels. The DNA was transferred to charged nylon membranes (Amersham) and hybridized with 32P-labeled probe (specific activity > 2 × 106 cpm/μg) at 65°C for 16 h in hybridization buffer (5 × Denhardt's solution, 6 × SSC, 0.1% (w/v) SDS, 0.1% (w/v) sodium pyrophosphate, 5% (w/v) polyethylene glycol 8000, 100 μg/ml boiled sheared herring sperm DNA). The final membrane washes were at 65°C in 0.1 × SSC and 0.1% (w/v) SDS for 20 min. Membranes were probed first with the Estβ21 cDNA then stripped and probed with Estα21 cDNA.RESULTSOn native PAGE gels, the susceptible Pel SS strain had no visible esterase bands, whereas all the resistant strains had the amplified esterase bands Estα2 and Estβ2 (Fig. 1). The specific activity of Pel SS crude homogenate for the substrate pNPA was 0.02 units/mg, approximately 50-fold less than that routinely observed for resistant crude homogenates. For pNPH, the specific activities were much higher (0.14 units/mg for Pel SS crude homogenate), and this was used as the assaying substrate in subsequent esterase purifications from Pel SS, as the higher specific activity made peak detection simpler. However, the first purification was followed with both pNPA and pNPH, and the major peaks detected were the same with both substrates. Since hydrolysis of pNPH is linear for less than 1 min, pNPA was still the substrate of choice for all purifications from the resistant strains. After purification, only 5-10 μg of each of the Estα and Estβ enzymes were obtained from 10-15 g, wet weight, of Pel SS larvae.SDS-PAGE with purified esterases demonstrated that the molecular masses of the Estα and Estβ enzymes (67 and 62 kDa, respectively) from the susceptible and both resistant strains were similar to those previously reported for Estα21 and Estβ21(11.Ketterman A.J.

J. 1993; 294: 575-579Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). The electrophoretic mobility on native PAGE of the Pel SS-purified Estα was reproducibly faster than that of the resistant Estα21 (Fig. 2). In contrast, the Pel SS Estβ had a slower mobility than that of the resistant Estβ21 (Fig. 3) but exactly the same mobility as the elevated C. quinquefasciatus Estβ1(14.Bisset J.A. Rodriguez M.M.

Km values of the Pel SS Estα enzyme for pNPA and pNPH were 119.3 ± 5.7 and 40.0 ± 7.2, respectively.Previous studies showed ka to be the most important constant in the interaction between the Culex esterases and the insecticides(12.Karunaratne S.H.P.P. Jayawardena K.G.I. Hemingway J. Ketterman A.J. Biochem. J. 1993; 294: 575-579Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). 10-fold differences in ka between the Pel SS and the resistant Muheza and SPerm strains for chlorpyrifos-oxon were seen for Estα (Table 1). Efficiencies in binding chlorpyrifos-oxon and paraoxon of the Pel SS Estβ enzyme were, respectively, 1000- and 100-fold less than those of the resistant strains (Table 2). Thus, the non-amplified enzymes from Pel SS are less able to bind the insecticides than their respective amplified counterparts from various resistant strains. The ratios of the reaction rates with the insecticides for the crude homogenates of Pel RR and Pel SS were similar to those observed for the purified enzymes (Table 3). As with the purified enzymes, the greatest differences were for chlorpyrifos-oxon and paraoxon, which suggests that this method may be valid as a crude means of detecting the level of interaction between these enzymes and insecticides.Table 1: Open table in a new tab Table 2: Open table in a new tab Table 3: Open table in a new tab The genomic EcoRI digests of the Pel SS and Pel RR strains and the field-collected insects sequentially probed for the Estα and Estβ esterases are shown in Fig. 4. The amplified Estα21 and Estβ21 bands in Pel RR are clearly distinguishable. The elevated Estα21 esterase is seen as a 3.5-kb band in the Pel RR strain, along with a fainter (non-amplified) 4-kb band. In Pel SS, a single non-amplified 4.1-kb Estα band is present. In both the Pel RR and Pel SS strains, there is a fainter non-amplified 3.3-kb Estβ band. The six field collections of insects had elevated esterase frequencies ranging from 0.12 to 0.84 on the basis of nonspecific esterase assays. When DNA digests from field-collected insects were probed, the amplified Estα21 and Estβ21 bands had amplification levels broadly in agreement with the different frequencies of elevated esterase individuals in each of the populations. There were three distinct non-amplified bands of each of Estα and Estβ bands in all six field collections analyzed with each of the restriction enzymes (Fig. 4). These bands were identical in all field collections. Blots of DNA digests from individual Pel SS and field-caught insects showed that the amplified bands were easily visible in these samples, but the non-amplified bands were not visible under our experimental conditions. The non-amplified bands from Pel SS were, however, visible in the pooled DNA from 4 to 5 insects. Hence, the non-amplified restriction bands seen in the field material must be present in more than one insect from the pool of 100.Figure 4:Southern blots of EcoRI genomic digests probed with cDNA fragments of the Pel RR Estα21 and Estβ21 esterases.

Hemingway J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 17044-17049Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar, 8.Vaughan A. Rodriguez M. Hemingway J. Biochem. J. 1995; 305: 651-658Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). The two esterases from Pel SS now need classifying in line with the system adopted for mosquito esterases(1.Vaughan A. Hemingway J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 17044-17049Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Recently, two Estβ1 esterases were found to be different from each other in their nucleotide sequence and inferred amino acid sequence, demonstrating that multiple alleles of the Estβ locus with identical electrophoretic mobility occur(8.Vaughan A. Rodriguez M. Hemingway J. Biochem. J. 1995; 305: 651-658Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). The TEM-R strain of C. quinquefasciatus has an amplified Estβ11EcoRI band of 2.1 kb(9.Raymond M. Callaghan A. Fort P. Pasteur N. Nature. 1991; 350: 151-153Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar), while the MRES Estβ12 has a doublet of bands of 3 and 3.2 kb(8.Vaughan A. Rodriguez M. Hemingway J. Biochem. J. 1995; 305: 651-658Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). We have now shown that the Estβ esterase in Pel SS electrophoretically would be classified as Estβ1, but it has an EcoRI band of 3.3 kb, which is distinct from those in both the MRES and TEM-R strains, and has 98% identity at the amino acid level with the amplified Estβ(8.Vaughan A. Rodriguez M. Hemingway J. Biochem. J. 1995; 305: 651-658Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar), hence the Pel SS esterase should be classified as Estβ13. The high stringency washing conditions for the Southern blots show that the non-amplified and amplified Estα esterases must be closely related. The Estα esterase in Pel SS has a different electrophoretic mobility to Estα2 and Estα1 (formerly A1), hence it should be classified as Estα3.The Pel SS Estβ13Km for pNPA was significantly higher than those of the resistant Estβ2 previously observed for Pel RR (140.8 ± 5.24 μM), Dar91 (85.41 ± 3.94 μM), and Tanga85 (90.11 ± 6.49 μM)(12.Karunaratne S.H.P.P. Jayawardena K.G.I. Hemingway J. Ketterman A.J. Biochem. J. 1993; 294: 575-579Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar, 17.Ketterman A.J. Karunaratne S.H.P.P. Jayawardena K.G.I. Hemingway J. Pest. Biochem. Physiol. 1993; 47: 142-148Crossref Scopus (32) Google Scholar). In contrast, the Pel SS Estα3 and Estβ13 esterase pNPH Km values are not significantly different from those previously reported for Estα21 and Estβ21(17.Ketterman A.J. Karunaratne S.H.P.P. Jayawardena K.G.I. Hemingway J. Pest. Biochem. Physiol. 1993; 47: 142-148Crossref Scopus (32) Google Scholar). The differences (up to 1000-fold) between the inhibition kinetic constants for the enzymes from the susceptible and resistant strains for the oxon analogues of the organophosphorus insecticides are far greater than those observed between resistant strains. The ka values for the purified esterases from the resistant strains used in this study were only slightly different from those determined previously for other resistant strains (see Table 2:, Table 3:)(17.Ketterman A.J. Karunaratne S.H.P.P. Jayawardena K.G.I. Hemingway J. Pest. Biochem. Physiol. 1993; 47: 142-148Crossref Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Thus, the high level of variability between the ka values for the susceptible and all the resistant strains cannot be accounted for by minor variations in conditions and experimental techniques between the studies, and we conclude that all the amplified esterases are more efficient at binding the insecticides than their non-amplified Pel SS counterparts. This superiority of insecticide binding suggests that there has been a positive insecticide selection pressure to maintain amplification of favorable resistant alleles.The kinetic differences between the purified amplified Estα2 and Estβ2 enzymes from different strains were previously suggested to be due to either allelic mixtures of the esterases or different single allelic forms of both Estα2 and Estβ2 in each of the resistant strains(12.Karunaratne S.H.P.P. Jayawardena K.G.I. Hemingway J. Ketterman A.J. Biochem. J. 1993; 294: 575-579Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar, 13.Jayawardena K.G.I. Karunaratne S.H.P.P. Ketterman A.J. Hemingway J. Bull. Entomol. Res. 1994; 84: 39-44Crossref Scopus (21) Google Scholar, 17.Ketterman A.J. Karunaratne S.H.P.P. Jayawardena K.G.I. Hemingway J. Pest. Biochem. Physiol. 1993; 47: 142-148Crossref Scopus (32) Google Scholar). However, the Estβ2 EcoRI digest pattern, unlike that for Estβ1, does not appear to vary(9.Raymond M. Callaghan A. Fort P. Pasteur N. Nature. 1991; 350: 151-153Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar), hence the observed kinetic differences may not be reflected at the DNA level. Our current data show that Pel RR has the invariant Estβ21EcoRI band and that it apparently contains an allelic mixture of both Estα and Estβ, with a minor non-amplified band of each of the esterase types being present along with the prominent amplified band. Thus, in this and previous biochemical studies, all the purified Estα and Estβ esterases from the resistant strains may have been mixtures of amplified and non-amplified alleles, as the purification conditions used may not have separated these minor variants from each other. Such allelic mixtures would not have been detected, as both the Pel SS Estβ13 and the Pel RR Estβ21 esterase genes code for proteins of 540 amino acids, whose predicted molecular weights would not allow their separation by SDS-PAGE(8.Vaughan A. Rodriguez M. Hemingway J. Biochem. J. 1995; 305: 651-658Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). This may explain the reported differences between purified esterases from different resistant strains, as variability could arise from different proportions of the amplified and non-amplified alleles, given the big differences in ka values between the amplified and non-amplified alleles of both the Estα and Estβ esterases. Alternatively, different non-amplified alleles could be mixed with an identical amplified allele to give a similar result. Our results also suggest that there is limited variability in the non-amplified Estα and Estβ alleles of the Sri Lankan field population, as only single non-amplified Estα and Estβ EcoRI bands were apparent from DNA obtained from mass homogenates of Pel SS, suggesting that this colony contains only a single Estα and a single Estβ esterase, even though the strain originated from numerous pooled single families selected from a large field collection of insects. Several years of laboratory colonization could have resulted in the loss of much of the variability. However, if the latter is true, it is surprising that the non-amplified Estβ allele of Pel RR has an identical EcoRI fragment to the Estβ13 allele of Pel SS, given that the two strains are maintained in separate insectaries. Similarly, restriction digest analysis of recent field collections of C. quinquefasciatus also suggest that the variability of the non-amplified Estα and Estβ alleles in the Sri Lankan field population is limited, with three common restriction fragments, as well as the amplified EcoRI fragment, occurring with each of three different restriction enzymes in six independent field collections from the Colombo area for each esterase. INTRODUCTIONThe use of pesticides, both directly and indirectly against the mosquito Culex quinquefasciatus, has resulted in the selection of broad spectrum organophosphate and carbamate resistance. The most commonly selected resistance mechanism is the increased activity of Estα2 and Estβ2 carboxylesterases (EC 3.1.1.1) (A2 and B2 esterases on an earlier classification)(1.Vaughan A.

Classification of these esterases is based on their preferences for α- or β-naphthyl acetate, their mobility on native polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE), ( (1)The abbreviations used are: PAGEpolyacrylamide gel electrophoresiskbkilobase(s)pNPAp-nitrophenyl acetatepNPHp-nitrophenyl hexanoate.) and their nucleotide sequence(1.Vaughan A.

The overproduction of the Estα21 and a series of Estβ esterases is due to gene amplification(1.Vaughan A. Hemingway J. J. Biol.

Identical EcoRI restriction fragment sizes of the amplified Estβ2 from resistant C. quinquefasciatus worldwide has been reported, in contrast to a high level of variability in Estβ from insecticide-susceptible mosquitoes(9.Raymond M. Callaghan A. Fort P. Pasteur N. Nature. 1991; 350: 151-153Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar). A cDNA with 97% identity to Estβ21 has been cloned from an insecticide susceptible strain (Pel SS) of C. quinquefasciatus from Sri Lanka(8.Vaughan A. Rodriguez M. Hemingway J. Biochem. J. 1995; 305: 651-658Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar); however, the protein has not been characterized. After native starch or PAGE of homogenates of individual resistant Culex larvae of the amplified Estα2/Estβ2 esterase phenotype, two electromorphs can be visualized. Under the same conditions, no esterase bands are visible in homogenates of susceptible insects. This has lead to the suggestion that the susceptible insects have null alleles for these loci(10.Georghiou G.P. Pasteur N. J. Econ. Entomol. 1978; 71: 201-205Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar).Here, we report the purification and characterization of both an α- and a β-naphthyl acetate-specific esterase from the Pel SS strain of mosquito and compare these at a biochemical and basic molecular level to the elevated esterases Estα21, Estβ12, and Estβ21. The role of the amplified esterases in resistance is sequestration, which is rapid binding and slow turnover of insecticides (11.Ketterman A.J. Jayawardena K.G.I. Hemingway J. Biochem.

The current study elucidates the relative efficiencies of the purified esterases from a susceptible and two further resistant strains at binding the carbamates and biologically active oxon analogues of the organophosphorus insecticides. Characterization of the amplified and non-amplified esterases will facilitate future site-directed mutagenesis studies on the essential amino acid residues involved in the enzyme-insecticide interaction."

https://openalex.org/W1972870961,"We report the complete genomic organization of the human WNT-5A gene, which encodes a cysteine-rich growth factor involved in cell-cell signaling during growth and differentiation. The gene comprises five exons with the terminal exon coding for a large 3′-untranslated region of ≈6.5 kilobase pairs and utilizes multiple polyadenylation signals to generate at least four discrete transcripts. We discovered a new leader exon interrupted by a 411-base pair intron that was retained in our original cDNA cloning. The promoter region was located in a GpC-rich island and harbored numerous cis-acting elements including several GC boxes and Sp1, AP1, and AP2 binding motifs. It lacked TATA or CAAT boxes typical of housekeeping and growth factor genes. In support of this, primer extension revealed two transcription start sites. Transient cell transfection assays showed functional promoter activity for the 3.9-kilobase pair 5′-flanking region. Interestingly, internal and 5′ deletions revealed that the distal promoter was not required for full transcriptional activity and that the first 631 base pairs of WNT-5A harbored the strongest promoter activity. Using a panel of rodent-human hybrid DNAs carrying portions of chromosome 3p, we mapped the gene to 3p14.2-p21.1, between a constitutional and a familial renal cell carcinoma-associated translocation. In situ hybridization analyses of early human embryos at 28-42 days of gestation revealed that WNT-5A transcripts were not restricted to the developing brain and limbs but were also observed in the mesenchyme bordering the pharyngeal clefts and pouches and in the developing gonads and kidneys. The relatively high expression in the celomic epithelium and in the precursors of follicles and seminiferous tubules suggest a novel role for WNT-5A in germ-cell differentiation. This study provides the molecular basis for discerning the regulation of the WNT-5A gene and offers the opportunity to investigate genetic disorders linked to this important gene. We report the complete genomic organization of the human WNT-5A gene, which encodes a cysteine-rich growth factor involved in cell-cell signaling during growth and differentiation. The gene comprises five exons with the terminal exon coding for a large 3′-untranslated region of ≈6.5 kilobase pairs and utilizes multiple polyadenylation signals to generate at least four discrete transcripts. We discovered a new leader exon interrupted by a 411-base pair intron that was retained in our original cDNA cloning. The promoter region was located in a GpC-rich island and harbored numerous cis-acting elements including several GC boxes and Sp1, AP1, and AP2 binding motifs. It lacked TATA or CAAT boxes typical of housekeeping and growth factor genes. In support of this, primer extension revealed two transcription start sites. Transient cell transfection assays showed functional promoter activity for the 3.9-kilobase pair 5′-flanking region. Interestingly, internal and 5′ deletions revealed that the distal promoter was not required for full transcriptional activity and that the first 631 base pairs of WNT-5A harbored the strongest promoter activity. Using a panel of rodent-human hybrid DNAs carrying portions of chromosome 3p, we mapped the gene to 3p14.2-p21.1, between a constitutional and a familial renal cell carcinoma-associated translocation. In situ hybridization analyses of early human embryos at 28-42 days of gestation revealed that WNT-5A transcripts were not restricted to the developing brain and limbs but were also observed in the mesenchyme bordering the pharyngeal clefts and pouches and in the developing gonads and kidneys. The relatively high expression in the celomic epithelium and in the precursors of follicles and seminiferous tubules suggest a novel role for WNT-5A in germ-cell differentiation. This study provides the molecular basis for discerning the regulation of the WNT-5A gene and offers the opportunity to investigate genetic disorders linked to this important gene. The highly conserved WNT genes belong to a growing family of signaling molecules and potential proto-oncogenes that are involved not only in mammary carcinogenesis but also in the regulation of pattern formation during embryogenesis and differentiation of cell lineages(1.McMahon A.P.

Trends Genet. 1992; 8: 236-242Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (121) Google Scholar). In general, WNT genes encode 38-43-kDa glycoproteins with features typical of secreted growth factors, including a hydrophobic signal peptide, the absence of additional transmembrane domains, highly conserved cysteine residues, and the presence of N-linked glycosylation sites(5.McMahon A.P. Trends Genet. 1992; 8: 236-242Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (121) Google Scholar). WNT proteins are closely associated with the cell surface (6.Papkoff J. Schryver B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 2723-2730Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar) and the extracellular matrix(7.Bradley R.S. Brown A.M.C. EMBO. J. 1990; 9: 1569-1575Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar). Accordingly, the radius of action of the paracrine effect extends across a few cell lengths, consistent with a factor diffusing over short distances in the extracellular matrix(8.Jue S.F. Bradley R.S. Rudnicki J.A. Varmus H.E. Brown A.M.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 321-328Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). Some of the WNT proteins also possess an ability to induce cell proliferation via an autocrine or paracrine route. In this respect, they represent multivalent factors that are capable of governing developmental processes by acting on different cellular systems similarly to the fibroblast growth factor or transforming growth factor-β families(9.Nusse R. Varmus H.E. Cell. 1992; 69: 1073-1087Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (828) Google Scholar). For example, the neural cell line PC12 can be phenotypically modified upon transfection with the mammalian WNT-1 cDNA(10.Bradley R.S. Cowin P. Brown A.M.C. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 123: 1857-1865Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar), and these effects are associated with modulation of plakoglobin and E-cadherin and an accompanying modulation of calcium-dependent cell adhesion(10.Bradley R.S. Cowin P. Brown A.M.C. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 123: 1857-1865Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar). In support of this study is the determination that armadillo, a Drosophila homologue of mammalian plakoglobin, is directly involved in the wg-mediated signal transducing pathway(11.Slegfried E. Wilder E.L. Perrimon N. Nature. 1994; 367: 76-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar, 12.Noordermeer J. Klingensmith J. Perrimon N. Nusse R. Nature. 1994; 367: 80-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar). The first WNT-5A gene was identified in the mouse where multiple transcripts ranging from 4.6 to >8 kb ( (1)The abbreviations used are: kbkilobase pair(s)PCRpolymerase chain reactionRTreverse transcriptaseCATchloramphenicol acetyl transferasebpbase pair(s).) encode a cysteine-rich protein of 379 amino acids whose temporal expression correlates with spatial patterning and morphogenesis(13.Gavin B.J.

Korzh V. Fjose A. Johansen T. Development. 1992; 116: 249-259Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) ortholog of the mammalian WNT-5A have been cloned, and their expression is also developmentally regulated. Of note, in embryos of Xenopus laevis, overexpression of WNT-5A leads to complex malformations that are distinct from those achieved by expression of other WNT genes(19.Moon R.T. Campbell R.M. Christian J.L. McGrew L.L. Shih J. Fraser S. Development. 1993; 119: 97-111Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These findings suggest that WNT-5A has a potential activity in modifying the morphogenetic movements of tissues(19.Moon R.T. Campbell R.M. Christian J.L. McGrew L.L. Shih J. Fraser S. Development. 1993; 119: 97-111Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). During mouse embryonic development, the expression of WNT-5A gene follows a complex spatial and temporal pattern; it is associated with several distinct sites including the central nervous system, the facial processes, and the posterior region of the fetus; in the adult, expression is restricted to brain, heart, and lungs(13.Gavin B.J. McMahon J.A. McMahon A.P. Genes & Dev. 1990; 4: 2319-2332Crossref PubMed Scopus (403) Google Scholar). WNT-5A is expressed at a low level in the mammary gland of virgin animals, but expression is increased during pregnancy, with a peak in early pregnancy followed by a rapid decline to undetectable levels(20.Gavin B.J. McMahon A.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 2418-2423Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar, 21.Bühler T.A. Dale T.C. Kieback C. Humphreys R.C. Rosen J.M. Dev. Biol. 1993; 155: 87-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Moreover, WNT-5A expression is up-regulated during retinoic acid-induced neural differentiation of P19 embryonal carcinoma cells (22.Smolich B.D. Papkoff J. Dev. Biol. 1994; 166: 300-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Two recent independent reports showed a lack of WNT-5A transforming activity based upon its inability to induce morphological transformation or altered growth characteristics onto C57MG mouse mammary epithelial cells(23.Olson D.J. Papkoff J. Cell Growth Diff. 1994; 5: 197-206PubMed Google Scholar, 24.Wong G.T. Gavin B.J. McMahon A.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 6278-6286Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar). The results of a screening of 10 different WNT members (24.Wong G.T. Gavin B.J. McMahon A.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 6278-6286Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar) suggest that this family of growth factors should be divided into three distinct groups: (i) a highly transforming group comprising WNT-1, WNT-3A, and WNT-7A, (ii) a moderately transforming group comprising WNT-2, WNT-5B, and WNT-7B, and (iii) a nontransforming group comprising WNT-4, WNT-5A, and WNT-6. Overall, these data demonstrate that WNT genes have distinct effects on cell growth and that they should not be regarded as functionally equivalent(24.Wong G.T. Gavin B.J. McMahon A.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 6278-6286Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar). kilobase pair(s) polymerase chain reaction reverse transcriptase chloramphenicol acetyl transferase base pair(s). We have recently cloned the human WNT-5A cDNA (25.Clark C.C. Cohen I. Eichstetter I. Cannizzaro L.A. McPherson J.D. Wasmuth J.J. Iozzo R.V. Genomics. 1993; 18: 249-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar) and discovered an aberrant expression of the gene in several human tumors, including lung and breast carcinomas and melanomas(26.Iozzo R.V. Eichstetter I. Danielson K.G. Cancer Res. 1995; 55: 3495-3499PubMed Google Scholar). To facilitate the study of human WNT-5A gene and to understand its transcriptional control, we have characterized the entire genomic organization of WNT-5A, established functional promoter activity for the 5′-flanking region in transient cell transfection assays, determined a finer chromosomal location for the gene, and investigated its expression in early human embryogenesis. This knowledge should provide the molecular basis for understanding the genetic control and fine tuning of this important gene during developmental processes and should allow the discovery of genetic diseases linked to this signaling molecule. All the reagents were of molecular biology grade. Radionucleotides [α-32P]dCTP (≈3000 Ci/mmol), [γ-32P]dATP (5,000 Ci/mmol), [α-35S]UTP (1000 Ci/mmol), and [14C]chloramphenicol (≈100 μCi/mmol) were obtained from Amersham Corp. Restriction enzymes were purchased from Promega Corporation (Madison, WI). PCR products were obtained from Perkin-Elmer and Invitrogen Corp. (San, Diego, CA). A lambda phage FIX II library (Clontech) prepared from partial MboI digestion of human WI38 lung fibroblast DNA was used for screening. Approximately, 5 × 105 plaques were screened using two c-DNA probes, a 1.4-kb fragment derived from the 5′ end of the gene containing the coding sequence, and a 1.2-kb fragment from the 3′-untranslated region(25.Clark C.C. Cohen I. Eichstetter I. Cannizzaro L.A. McPherson J.D. Wasmuth J.J. Iozzo R.V. Genomics. 1993; 18: 249-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Both probes were labeled to high specific activity by the random priming method (27.Feinberg A.P. Vogelstein B. Anal. Biochem. 1984; 137: 266-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (5190) Google Scholar) utilizing a kit from Stratagene. The filters (Duralose from Stratagene) were hybridized separately for each probe overnight at 65°C in a solution containing 5 × SSC (1 × SSC = 0.15 M NaCl, 15 mM sodium citrate), 1 × Denhardt's reagent, 0.1% SDS, and 100 μg/ml denatured salmon sperm DNA. After washing the filters at high stringency (0.5 × SSC, 0.1% SDS at 65°C), the filters were exposed to Kodak XAR-5 film at −70°C in a cassette containing intensifying screens and subsequently eleven positive clones were identified. Two strongly positive phage clones designated W1 and W10 were selected and purified by sequential plaque screening for further characterization. DNA isolated from each phage clone was characterized by restriction enzyme digestion and Southern blotting analysis and hybridizing fragments containing exons were subcloned into pBluescript II KS (Stratagene). Plasmid DNA was sequenced by an automated sequencing system (Applied Biosystems) utilizing T3 or T7 primers in pBluescript or synthetic oligonucleotide primers. Computer analysis of DNA sequences was done using the GCG or PC/GENE computer programs as described previously(28.Danielson K.G. Fazzio A. Cohen I. Cannizzaro L.A. Eichstetter I. Iozzo R.V. Genomics. 1993; 15: 146-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). RNA was isolated from confluent monolayer of human embryonic fibroblasts or MG-63 osteosarcoma cells by a modified method of Chomczynski and Sacchi (29.Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (63087) Google Scholar) using a commercially available “Tri” reagent (Molecular Research Corp, Cincinnati, OH). RNA was dissolved in Formazol (Molecular Research Corp.) and stored at −70°C. Approximately 10-15 μg of RNA was separated by electrophoresis in 1% agarose gels containing 0.66 M formaldehyde(30.Ornitz D.M. Moreadith R.W. Leder P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 698-702Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar), transferred to nylon membranes, and hybridized to 32P-labeled DNA probes, as indicated. Hybridization was done overnight at 42°C in 50% formamide, 5 × SSC, 25 mM sodium phosphate (pH 6.8), 0.5% SDS, 10 × Denhardt's reagent, and 250 μg/ml denatured salmon sperm DNA. After hybridization, the blots were washed in 2 × SSC, 0.1% SDS at 50°C before exposure to film. The transcription start site of the human WNT-5A gene was analyzed by primer extension. Total RNA from fetal human fibroblasts (cell line CRL 1262) and human osteosarcoma cells (cell line MG-63) was isolated using “Tri” reagent. Approximately, 8 μg of RNA was used as a template for a specific 21-base oligonucleotide (AACAAGTGGAGCCAGAATTAA) corresponding to the inverse complement of +2 to +22 of the original WNT-5A cDNA sequence(25.Clark C.C. Cohen I. Eichstetter I. Cannizzaro L.A. McPherson J.D. Wasmuth J.J. Iozzo R.V. Genomics. 1993; 18: 249-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). The primer (10 pmol) was end-labeled with [γ-32P]ATP and T4 polynucleotide kinase (Promega) for 10 min at 37°C. The reaction mix was heated to 90°C to inactivate the enzyme and passed over a Sephadex G-25 spin column (5 Prime →3 Prime, Inc. Boulder, CO) to remove unincorporated ATP. Annealing of the primer (0.1 pmol) to the RNA was allowed to occur in 10 μl of Superscript (RNase-free) reverse transcriptase (Life Technologies, Inc.) buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.3, 40 mM KCl, 6 mM MgCl2, and 1 mM dithiothreitol) for 20 min at 58°C followed by slow cooling to room temperature for 10 min. Extension of the primer was done by addition of 10 μl of a solution containing 1 × Superscript II reverse transcriptase buffer, 0.5 mM each of dATP, dCTP, dGTP, and dTTP, and 200 units of Superscript reverse transcriptase. Incubation was done at 42°C for 30 min. The reaction mixture was precipitated with 0.3 M sodium acetate (pH 5.2) and 3 volumes of 100% ethanol. After centrifugation the pellet was washed in 70% ethanol, dried at room temperature, and allowed to dissolve in loading buffer (Promega). The samples were heated to 90°C for 10 min prior to loading on a 6% sequencing gel. For RT-PCR, 5 μg of total RNA from human embryonic fibroblasts (CRL-1262) were incubated with an antisense primer 5′-TGCAGTTCCACCGTCGAT-3' located in exon 3 in the presence of avian myeloblastosis virus reverse transcriptase according to the manufacturer's recommendations (Invitrogen, CA). For amplifying the cDNAs products, 2 μl of RT reaction was incubated in a 50-μl volume containing 5 μl of 10 × PCR buffer, 1 μl of 100 mM of dNTPs, 1 μM of a sense primer 5′-AGCCCAGGAGTTGCTTTG-3' located in exon 2 and the same antisense primer as above, and 4 units of Taq polymerase (Perkin-Elmer). The PCR conditions included a hot start, 5 min at 94°C, followed by 35 cycles for 1 min at 94°C, 2 min at 55°C, and 3 min at 72°C. The largest promoter construct, which contained 3888 bp of WNT-5A sequence upstream of the 307-bp leader exon, was cloned upstream of the CAT gene within the pBS vector, the pBSCAT(31.Santra M. Danielson K.G. Iozzo R.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 579-587Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The pBSCAT contained a promotorless CAT reporter gene within pBluescript and was generated as described before (31.Santra M. Danielson K.G. Iozzo R.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 579-587Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A nested deletion was generated by digesting the first construct of ≈4.2 kb with the restriction endonuclease HindIII. This resulted in an internal deletion of a ≈750-bp fragment that was subsequently ligated into the corresponding site of the pBSCAT(32.Naso M.F. Zimmermann D.R. Iozzo R.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 32999-33008Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Finally, we generated a 5′ deletion construct encompassing the 631 bp upstream of the leader exon. Briefly, the largest 3888-bp construct was partially digested with HindIII, producing three DNA fragments; two of them spanning from −3888 to −1382 and −1382 to −632 bp were discarded, whereas the remaining fragment, comprising a sequence between −631 and −1 bp relative to the major transcription start site, was isolated, purified, and subjected to self-ligation. All of these constructs were checked by sequencing both ends with either internal primers or primers based on the T3 or T7 promoter sequence of the pBSCAT vector. For transient cell transfection, HeLa cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum, 4 mML-glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin at 37°C in a humidified 5% CO2 atmosphere. Transient transfections of HeLa cells were performed by the calcium phosphate method as described previously(32.Naso M.F. Zimmermann D.R. Iozzo R.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 32999-33008Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, confluent 75-cm2 flasks of Hela cells were transfected with 20 μg of WNT-5A promoter/pBSCAT plasmid along with 10 μg of pRSV-β-galactosidase plasmid DNA in order to normalize for transfection efficiency. In addition, all the transfection assays were performed with positive (SV40-driven CAT) and negative (promotorless CAT) vectors. The cells were incubated in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium for 12 h at 37°C. After an additional 48 h of incubation, the cells were rinsed twice with a phosphate-buffered saline solution (Ca2+- and Mg2+-free) and assayed for β-galactosidase activity according to standard procedures (33.Mauviel A. Santra M. Chen Y.Q. Uitto J. Iozzo R.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 11692-11700Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). CAT assays were performed as described before(31.Santra M. Danielson K.G. Iozzo R.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 579-587Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The acetylated products were separated in preslotted thin layer chromatography plates and subjected to autoradiography. The resultant autoradiograms were quantified by scanning laser densitometry and computer integration. Additional experimental details are provided in the text and legends to figures. Genomic DNA was isolated as described before(34.Siracusa L.D. Russell L.B. Jenkins N.A. Copeland N.G. Genetics. 1987; 117: 85-92Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Tissue culture cells were centrifuged, and the resulting pellets were mixed with 600 μl of a solution containing 50 mM Tris (pH 8.0), 100 mm EDTA, 100 mM NaCl, 1% SDS, and 585 μg/ml Proteinase K (Boehringer Mannheim) and incubated at 55°C overnight with occasional mixing. The solution was then extracted once with phenol and again with phenol:chloroform (24:1), and the DNA was precipitated with 2 volumes of 100% ethanol. The DNA precipitate was removed with a capillary pipette and dissolved in 10 mM Tris, 0.1 mM EDTA, pH 8.0 (TE). Approximately 10 μg of genomic DNA was digested with HindIII, precipitated, and redissolved in TE, and DNA fragments were separated on a 0.7% Tris borate-EDTA (TBE) agarose gel. The DNA was transferred to nitrocellulose supported by polyester films (30.Ornitz D.M. Moreadith R.W. Leder P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 698-702Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar) and hybridized to a WNT-5A cDNA 1.4-kb fragment (+443 to +1904) generated by PCR. Probes labeled with [α-32P]dCTP were prepared by random priming using a kit from Stratagene (San Diego, CA). For regional chromosomal mapping, a rodent-human hybrid panel retaining partial chromosome 3 was used as described previously(35.Bullrich F. Druck T. Kunapuli P. Gomez J. Gripp K.W. Schlegelberger B. Lasota J. Aronson M. Cannizzaro L.A. Huebner K. Benovic J.L. Cytogenet. Cell Genet. 1995; 70: 250-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Hybrid DNAs were tested for the presence of specific human WNT-5A restriction fragments detected by radiolabeled WNT-5A cDNA using standard Southern hybridization methods described above. Human embryos were obtained from elective therapeutic terminations of pregnancy. Approval was obtained from the Ethical Committee of the Medical Faculty, the University of Hong Kong for work with fresh embryonic materials and archival specimens. The gestational ages of archival specimens was determined by assessing the centers of ossification and the histological characteristics of the stained sections. The crown-rump length was measured for intact fresh specimens. Five embryos, two at 28 days and one each at 33, 38, and 42 days, were studied. Archival samples of human embryos were previously fixed in 10% (v/v) neutral buffered formalin. Fresh embryos were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde. Both sources of human embryonic tissue were analyzed by in situ hybridization. Sense and antisense riboprobes for in situ hybridization were generated from a recombinant plasmid containing a 498-bp DraII-SacI fragment of human WNT-5A cDNA (8.Jue S.F. Bradley R.S. Rudnicki J.A. Varmus H.E. Brown A.M.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 321-328Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar) subcloned into pBluescript II KS (Stratagene). Synthesis of [35S]UTP-labeled riboprobes, in situ hybridization, autoradiography, and histological staining were carried out as described(36.Cheah K.S.E. Lau E.T. Au P.K.C. Tam P.P.L. Development. 1991; 111: 945-953Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 37.Ng L.J. Tam P.P.L. Cheah K.S.E. Dev. Biol. 1993; 159: 403-417Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Single-stranded sense and antisense riboprobes labeled with [α35S]UTP were generated using T3 and T7 RNA polymerase, respectively. As controls, hybridizations were also performed using sense riboprobes. Sections were counterstained with Harris hematoxylin and eosin and photographs were taken using Kodak Ektachrome ASA 64 film as described previously(36.Cheah K.S.E. Lau E.T. Au P.K.C. Tam P.P.L. Development. 1991; 111: 945-953Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 37.Ng L.J. Tam P.P.L. Cheah K.S.E. Dev. Biol. 1993; 159: 403-417Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). We previously reported (25.Clark C.C. Cohen I. Eichstetter I. Cannizzaro L.A. McPherson J.D. Wasmuth J.J. Iozzo R.V. Genomics. 1993; 18: 249-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar) a 483-bp sequence encoding the 5′-untranslated region of WNT-5A cDNA. We now have identified the sequence within two adjacent BamHI genomic fragments. A close examination of the sequence data detected possible donor and acceptor splice sites at positions 33 and 444, which would generate a 411-bp intervening sequence. Further analyses of the cDNA clones revealed that the 411-bp region was spliced out in three different clones and retained in the others (Fig. 1A). To determine whether the 411-bp fragment was intronic, we generated a PCR probe of 363 bp within this region and used it as a labeled probe in Northern blotting analyses of the same fibroblast RNA that was used in the cDNA library construction. The probe failed to hybridize to any transcript (not shown) under the same conditions in which we could detect several transcripts by using other portions of the WNT-5A gene (cf.Fig. 4). Therefore, it appears that the 411-bp fragment is a retained intron cloned from an incompletely spliced nuclear RNA present in the original cDNA library. Fig. 1A shows the position of the intron and the “correct” numbering of the cDNA, as well as the location of the three primers used for primer extension and RT-PCR shown below.Figure 4:Functional activity of the human WNT-5A promoter using transient cell transfection assays. A is a schematic representation of the various constructs used to test promoter activity. The negative numbers indicate the 5′ end of the promoter fragment relative to the major transcription start site (+1). The relative position of the regulatory motifs is also schematically shown. In addition, transfections assays were performed with the SV40-driven CAT vectors. B shows a representative autoradiogram of CAT activity in transiently transfected HeLa cells. The two acetylated species (Ac) are shown for the SV40-CAT (lane 1), promoterless CAT (lane 2), the −3888 bp construct (lanes 3-5), and the −1382/-632 internal deletion (lane 6-8). O, origin. C shows quantitation of CAT activity as determined by scanning densitometry of various autoradiograms. The values are the mean ± S.E. (n = 3) of individual experiments performed in triplicate and are expressed as a percentages of the total activity (arbitrarily set as 100%) of the construct with the highest activity, the −631 bp promoter construct (lane 3). Lane 1, −3888 CAT construct; lane 2, −1382/-632 internal deletion construct; lane 4, promoterless CAT. The values were normalized on β-galactosidase activity that was concurrently transfected in all the assays to correct for transfection efficiency.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Next, we wished to determine the start of transcription, because putative exon 1 was only 33 bp long, as deduced from the cDNA sequence. Primer extension analysis was performed with RNA from skin fibroblasts (CRL-1262) and MG-63 osteosarcoma cells, using a antisense primer located between bp 2 and 22 of the cDNA. Two putative transcription initiation sites were detected, at 155 and 295 bp upstream of the primer (Fig. 1B). This result was confirmed by additional experiments where the primary product generated by reverse transcription was hybridized to a probe containing the 5′ end of the cDNA. Specifically, first-strand cDNA synthesis was performed using RNA from skin fibroblasts (CRL-1262) and an antisense oligonucleotide between bp 356 and 373. The generation of WNT-5A cDNA was confirmed as control, by specific amplification of a 342-bp fragment between +52 and +373. The products of the RT reaction were hybridized to the 342-bp probe under stringent conditions by Northern blotting analysis. Fig. 1C shows that two bands of ≈533 and 740 bp were detected, confirming the presence of two transcription start sites. The sizes of the fragments shown in Fig. 1C corresponded well to those detected by primer extension (Fig. 1B). These data also confirm that the 411-bp segment is an intron inasmuch as the size of the fragments in Fig. 1C would have been 944 and 1151 bp, respectively, if the intron were present in the cDNA. Furthermore, these findings indicate that the WNT-5A messages begin ≈160 and 330 bp 5′ to the site predicted by our cDNA sequence(25.Clark C.C. Cohen I. Eichstetter I. Cannizzaro L.A. McPherson J.D.

https://openalex.org/W1970207562,"Cholinergic muscarinic receptor genes are members of the G-protein receptor gene superfamily. In this study we describe the structure of the gene and promoter of the rat m4 muscarinic receptor gene. A rat cosmid clone containing the coding region for the m4 gene and 25 kilobases of upstream sequence was isolated. This clone directed expression of the rat m4 gene when introduced in IMR32 cells, a human neuroblastoma that expresses m4, but did not drive expression when introduced into Chinese hamster ovary cells, a line that does not express the m4 gene. S1 nuclease, modified 5′-rapid amplification of cDNA ends and polymerase chain reaction analysis of rat cosmid DNA and cDNA showed that the gene consists of a 2.6-kilobase coding exon, extending 34 base pairs (bp) upstream from the initiating ATG, separated from a 460-493 bp noncoding exon by a 4.8-kilobase intron. DNA sequence analysis shows that the noncoding exon is GC-rich and that the promoter does not contain a TATA or CAAT box and has several consensus sequences for enhancer elements including five Sp-1 binding sites, one AP-2 site, one AP-3 binding site and two E-boxes within the proximal 600 bp.

Signal transduction in the nervous system is largely conducted by activation of G-protein coupled receptors (GPRs). ( 1The abbreviations used are: GPRG-protein coupled receptorsCHOChinese hamster ovaryPIPES1, 4-piperazinediethanesulfonic acidbpbase pair(s)PCRpolymerase chain reactionRACErapid amplification of cDNA endskbkilobase(s).) GPRs are encoded by one of the most diverse gene families in the mammalian genome, accounting for as much as 1% of the entire genome. Most, if not all, of these gene products have a unique distribution within the nervous system and hence it is of interest to determine how these expression profiles are brought about, i.e. what determines the receptor repertoire of individual neurones? Of the several hundred members of the G-protein coupled receptors very little is known about the gene structure and the transcriptional control regions that result in this tightly controlled expression (see (1.Wood I.C. Buckley N.J. Forme. 1995; 5: 29-38Google Scholar)). Muscarinic receptors mediate many of the effects of acetylcholine in the central and autonomic nervous systems, and are found in both neuronal and effector tissues. Five muscarinic receptor genes have been identified, m1-m5(2.Kubo T. Fukuda K. Mikami A. Maeda A. Takahashi H. Mishina M. Haga T. Haga K. Iciyama A. Kangawa K. Kojima M. Matsuo Hirose T. Numa S.

The present study focuses upon the m4 muscarinic receptor gene and represents the first report of the gene structure of a member of the muscarinic receptor gene family. The m4 gene is expressed mainly in telencephalic regions of the central nervous system(6.Buckley N.J. Bonner T.I. Brann M.R. J. Neurosci. 1988; 8: 4646-4652Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), autonomic ganglia(11.Hassal C.J.S. Stanford S.C. Burnstock G. Buckley N.J.

Activation of m4 receptors can lead to closing of N-type voltage sensitive Ca2+ channels, activation of K+ channels, and inhibition of adenylyl cyclase. Each of the muscarinic receptor genes contains its open reading frame encoded entirely within one exon and it is thought that each of these genes contains at least one further exon upstream containing the 5′-untranslated sequences. In order to determine the mechanisms that are involved in the initiation and maintenance of expression of these receptors, a cosmid clone containing the entire m4 receptor gene and flanking regions has been isolated. Several parallel strategies have been employed to map the upstream elements of this gene and to identify regulatory elements involved in driving cell specific expression. Cell lines were cultured in 5% CO2 at 37°C in α-minimal essential medium containing 6 g/liter penicillin, 10 g/liter streptomycin, and 2 mML-glutamine, supplemented with either 10% fetal calf serum, 3 mM hypoxanthine, 4.8 mM thymidine, and 0.12 mM aminopterin (NG108-15 cells) or 5% fetal calf serum and 5% horse serum (PC12 cells) or 10% fetal calf serum and 10 mM HEPES (IMR32 cells) or 10% newborn calf serum (CHO cells). A rat genomic library constructed in the cosmid vector pTCF (15.Grosveld F. Lund T. Murray E.J. Mellor A.L. Dahl H.H.M. Flavell R.A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1982; 10: 6715-6732Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar) was screened at moderate stringency with [α-32P]dATP tailed oligonucleotide probes and a 997-bp internally labeled cDNA fragment obtained from a PstI digest of the m4 coding region. For screening with the oligonucleotide probes, a mixture of 3 oligonucleotides, Rm4A (5′-CTCACCAGGCGCACAGACTGATTGGCTGAGCTGCATTGACAGGCGTG-3'), Rm4B (5′-GGTGTTCTGGGTGGCACTGCCTGAGCTGGACTCATTGGAAGTGTCCTT-3'), and Rm4C (5′-GCGCTCCCGGGCCGCCATCTGCCGCTTCTTGCGCACCTGGTTGCGAGC-3') complementary to nucleotides 10-58, 866-914, and 1139-1187 of the m4 cDNA were used. A random primed probe, spanning the m4 cDNA between nucleotides 6 and 1003 was also used to screen the library. Nuclei from PC12 and CHO cells were isolated according to Current Protocols(16.Ausbel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl L.K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. John Wiley & Sons, New York1987Google Scholar), and stored at −70°C prior to usage. For the transcription run-on a 200-μl aliquot of frozen nuclei was thawed and labeled with [α-32P]UTP (3000 Ci/mmol, DuPont NEN) according to Current Protocols(16.Ausbel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl L.K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. John Wiley & Sons, New York1987Google Scholar). After labeling, DNA was digested using RNase-free DNase (Promega) and protein was digested with proteinase K (Promega). Total and incorporated counts were determined and the probe hybridized to slot blots in a hybridization buffer containing 10 mM Tris-Cl (pH 7.4), 0.2% SDS, 10 mM EDTA, 300 mM NaCl, 1 × Denhardt's reagent, and 200 μg/ml tRNA at 65°C for 48 h. The blots were washed at final stringency of 0.1 × SSC, 0.1% SDS at 65°C and excess RNA removed in 2 × SSC, 10 μg/ml RNase A at 37°C for 30 min. The blots were exposed to x-ray film at −70°C for 1 week. RNA was isolated using the acid phenol/guanidinium thiocyanate method of Chomczynski and Saachi (17.Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (63232) Google Scholar). mRNA was purified using oligo(dT) (Invitrogen). Northern blots were prepared by electrophoresis through formaldehyde agarose gels and electroblotting onto nylon membranes (GeneScreen). Reverse transcriptase/PCR analyses were carried out as described previously(18.Steel M.C. Buckley N.J. Mol. Pharmacol. 1993; 43: 694-701PubMed Google Scholar). RNA was treated with RQ DNase I (Promega) prior to reverse transcription to ensure that subsequent amplification products were derived from RNA and not contaminating genomic DNA. PCR cycling conditions were: 95°C/30 s, 63°C/30 s, and 72°C/1 min. Reactions were run for 30 cycles. The primers used for PCR analysis to specifically amplify rat m4 sequences in the stable transformants were: a species degenerate sense primer, Hm4 1141s (5′-GCTCGCAACCAGGTGCGCAAGAAG-3'), and species specific antisense primer, Rm4 1559a (5′-GGTACCTCACGGTGTCTGGGAGAC-3'). Primers used to amplify hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyl transferase (hprt), were: hprt 231s (5′-CCTGCTGGATTACATTAAAGCACTG-3') and hprt 567a (5′-CCTGAAGTACTCATTATAGTCAAGG-3'). 5'-RACE was carried out using a modified procedure of Frohman et al.(19.Frohman M.A. Dush M.K. Martin G.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 8998-9002Crossref PubMed Scopus (4341) Google Scholar). PC12 RNA was reverse transcribed using an m4 specific primer, 863a (5′-GCTGGACTCATTGGAAGTGTCCT-3'). First strand cDNA was then purified and tailed with dATP prior to amplification using a t17-adapter primer, RACE-1 (5′-GACTCGAGTCGACATCGATTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTT-3'), and an m4 specific primer, Rm4 63a (5′-ACTGTCTCCAGGTGGTTGTGGGCT-3'). PCR cycling conditions were: 95°C/30 s, 58°C/30 s, and 72°C/90 s. Amplification was carried out for 30 cycles. 10% of the amplified product was used in a second amplification under the same conditions as above but using a set of nested primers, internal to the m4 specific product amplified. This second set of primers consisted of an m4 specific primer, Rm4 10a (5′-GTCACCAGGCGCACAGACTGATTGGCTGAGCTGCCATTGACAGGCGTG-3') and the adapter primer, RACE-2 (5′-GACTCGAGTCGACATCG-3'). [α-32P]dATP (6000 Ci/mmol, DuPont NEN), was also included to a final concentration of 10 mM to internally label the amplified product. After 30 cycles of PCR, labeled RACE products were purified by spinning through a G-50 column. The RACE probe was denatured by boiling for 5 min and hybridized to Southern blots containing DNA fragments of the cosmid clone, R3-6. PCR mapping of the upstream exon and exon/intron boundaries was carried out using primers indicated in Fig. 1. Cesium chloride banded DNA or Qiagen column purified DNA was transfected into cells using calcium phosphate precipitation as described by Chen and Okayama (20.Chen C.A. Okayama H. BioTechniques. 1988; 6: 632-638Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar) or with Lipofectamine (Bethesda Research Laboratories). For transient assays, cells were harvested 48 h after transfection and cell extracts prepared as described below. Stable transformants were produced by co-transfection with the cosmid clone (R3-6), and a Simian virus 40 (SV40) driven neomycin resistance gene and selection in the presence of 400 μg/ml G418. Single clones were amplified and RNA was prepared to test for rat m4 expression. For reporter gene assays NG108-15, CHO, and 3T3 cells were transfected using 0.8 μg of luciferase plasmid DNA, 0.2 μg of a standard plasmid consisting of a cytomegalovirus promoter β-galactosidase gene (pCMVβ (Clontech)) and 5 μl of Lipofectamine/35-mm dish. These conditions gave transfection efficiencies of 5-50% as adjudged by β-galactosidase histochemistry. Two to three days after transfection, cells were harvested into Reporter Lysis Buffer (Promega), the lysate freeze/thawed, and stored at −80°C. Luciferase measurements were carried out using the Promega luciferase assay system, according to manufacturers instructions in a Turner TD-20e luminometer. β-Galactosidase measurements were carried out using an o-nitrophenyl-β-D-galactopyranoside assay (21.Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar) and used to normalize luciferase results. S1 nuclease mapping was carried out by a slightly modified procedure of Sambrook et al.(21.Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). 5 μg of plasmid DNA was cut with a suitable restriction enzyme, added to 100 μg of either PC12 or CHO total RNA, precipitated, and dissolved in 30 μl of hybridization buffer (90% formamide, 400 mM NaCl, 40 mM PIPES (pH 6.4), and 1 mM EDTA). The nucleic acids were denatured at 85°C for 10 min and hybridized overnight at 50°C before digestion with S1 nuclease. Samples were electrophoresed on a 2% agarose gel and blotted onto a nylon membrane (GeneScreen). The blot was then hybridized with fragments of the R3-6 clone to identify the size and location of the protected exonic domains. The 5.0-kb BamHI fragment believed to contain the transcription initiation site for the m4 gene was subcloned into the plasmid pGem 7Zf(+) (Promega) and nested deletions were then produced using exonuclease III and an Erase-a-base kit (Promega). Single recombinant plasmids were isolated and used for DNA sequencing. DNA sequencing of PCR products was performed using the fmol DNA sequencing kit (Promega); PCR products were first purified using a Centricon 100 column and sequenced as per the manufacturers' instructions. DNA sequencing of plasmid DNA was performed with a Sequenase kit from U. S. Biochemical Corp. or by cycle sequencing using Taq polymerase and dye terminators on an Applied Biosytems automated sequencer. Reporter plasmids were constructed using a modified version of pGL3 basic (Promega). Two primers, Rm4x15s and Rm4x18s, containing KpnI linkers were used in conjunction with Rm4x6a containing a BglII linker to amplify a 1520- and a 432-bp fragment of the m4 promoter, respectively. These were cloned into a KpnI/BglII cut pGL3 basic to generate the pGL3 −1440/+80 and pGL3 −352/+80 constructs. Screening of approximately 1 × 106 recombinants in a rat cosmid library with DNA probes specific for the m4 gene yielded three overlapping DNA clones each of which contained at least some of the m4 coding region. Two of the clones contained only a truncated m4 coding region and no 5′-flanking DNA while one of the clones, R3-6 (Fig. 1), was found to contain the entire coding region for the m4 gene and approximately 25 kb of 5′-flanking DNA. Further analysis was therefore confined to the R3-6 clone. Our initial approach was to determine if R3-6 contained a functional m4 transcriptional unit. In order to test this hypothesis the R3-6 cosmid clone was used to produce stable transformants of two cell lines; IMR32, a human neuroblastoma that expresses the m4 gene and CHO, which does not express the m4 gene (Fig. 2). A PCR analysis was then performed on RNA extracted from these cell lines using species-specific primers to determine if R3-6 contained enough information to drive expression of the rat m4 gene. PCR analysis on stably transfected CHO and IMR32 cells (Fig. 2) shows that R3-6 is capable of driving m4 gene expression in IMR32 but not CHO cells thereby indicating that the R3-6 cosmid clone contains the transcription start site for the m4 gene and at least some of the transcriptional regulatory sequences that drive cell type-specific m4 expression. Although, in principle, this type of analysis could be conducted on transiently transfected cells, in practice, we found it impossible to completely digest the transfected cosmid DNA present in the nucleic acid extractions, using either exonucleases or endonucleases. Under these conditions, it was not possible to determine whether subsequent PCR products were derived from cDNA or cosmid DNA. Several independent approaches were then utilized to determine the position of the transcription start site and the location of exonic sequences within the R3-6 clone. A full-length cDNA for the m4 receptor gene has proven difficult to isolate despite using various strategies, including screening of 5′ STRETCH cDNA libraries (Clontech) which have not resulted in any cDNA sequence upstream from the initiating ATG being obtained; this was also noted in the original work describing isolation of the rat m4 cDNA(3.Bonner T.I. Buckley N.J. Young A.C. Brann M.R. Science. 1987; 237: 527-532Crossref PubMed Scopus (1222) Google Scholar). In order to determine the size of the untranslated exon in the m4 gene a series of primer extension analyses were carried out using mRNA from PC12 cells; however, even with the use of a variety of primers and a selection of extension conditions no specific products were obtained. Positive controls using primers to reverse transcribe the 5′ end of the tyrosine hydroxylase gene consistently generated specific bands of the expected length (data not shown). Problems with primer extension analysis have previously been noted for a number of genes in this gene family including the D1A gene and have generally been ascribed to the presence of GC-rich sequences within the 5′ noncoding regions(22.Minowa M.T. Minowa T. Monsma Jr., F. Sibley D.R. Mouradian M.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 3045-3049Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). To determine the regions of the R3-6 cosmid that are transcribed a nuclear run-on analysis was performed using nuclei isolated from PC12 cells which were shown to express the rat m4 gene (Fig. 2). The results of the nuclear run-on analysis suggest that there may be two transcription units within the R3-6 clone (Fig. 3). The 4.5-kb BamHI fragment containing the coding region and the 5.0-kb BamHI fragment upstream from the coding region both show hybridization signals suggesting that both fragments contain exonic sequences. The 3.0-kb fragment does not show any hybridization indicating that this fragment does not contain transcribed sequences. Repeat experiments failed to show any hybridization with this fragment. This data suggests that transcription of the m4 gene begins within the 5.0-kb fragment. The hybridization signal obtained for the 14.3-kb fragment is likely to be due to a separate transcription unit as there is no transcription occurring through the 3.0-kb fragment, or due to hybridization of repetitive sequences which have been found in intronic regions(23.Davidson E.H. Britten R.J. Science. 1979; 204: 1052-1059Crossref PubMed Scopus (373) Google Scholar). A Northern blot analysis on total RNA isolated from CHO and PC12 cells using subcloned regions of the cosmid was performed to eliminate the possibility of any hybridization due to intronic sequences. The results are shown in Fig. 4 where it can be seen that both the 5.0- and 4.5-kb BamHI fragments show hybridization signals consistent with these containing exonic material. Also the sequences tested within the 14.3-kb fragment show hybridization signals with PC12 RNA but not with CHO RNA indicating that the hybridization is likely to be due to exonic sequences rather than repetitive elements. These upstream transcribed sequences show a more intense hybridization signal than the 5.0- and 4.5-kb fragments which are hybridizing to the m4 transcript consistent with the interpretation that these fragments are hybridizing to a transcript different from the m4. Both the nuclear run-on analysis and the Northern blot analysis suggest that the transcription start site for the m4 gene is situated within the 5.0-kb BamHI fragment (Figure 3:, Figure 4:). In order to map the position of exonic sequences within this fragment more precisely it was decided to utilize the 5′-RACE procedure(19.Frohman M.A. Dush M.K. Martin G.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 8998-9002Crossref PubMed Scopus (4341) Google Scholar). Hybridization analysis of 5′-RACE products using nested oligonucleotides as hybridization probes revealed the presence of specific RACE products consistent with the presence of at least a further 200 bp of exonic sequence. However, all attempts to clone the 5′-RACE product ended with deleted clones. Use of severely rec− host cells such as SURE (Stratagene) did not help in stabilization of this clone. Hybridization and sequencing analysis revealed a consistent deletion 5 bp upstream of the initiating methionine. Interestingly, the original cloning of the rat m4 cDNA did not produce a full-length clone, all clones initiated 6 bases downstream of the first base of the open reading frame(3.Bonner T.I. Buckley N.J. Young A.C. Brann M.R. Science. 1987; 237: 527-532Crossref PubMed Scopus (1222) Google Scholar). Consequently, we decided to produce an internally labeled RACE product that could be used as a probe in Southern analysis of the R3-6 clone. This analysis should identify only those sequences in the R3-6 clone that are exonic as the probe is initially derived from mature mRNA. Amplified DNA was produced by two consecutive PCR amplifications with [α-32P]dATP incorporated in the second amplification as outlined under “Materials and Methods.” When analyzed on a 2% agarose gel the radiolabel from 2 probes appeared to be incorporated into a smear of DNA between 100 and 1500 bp with two specific DNA bands observed at approximately 330 and 560 bp (Fig. 5A). This heterogeneity is expected when using an inherently degenerate amplification procedure such as 5′-RACE. Initially the RACE probe was hybridized to a slot blot containing DNA fragments derived from the R3-6 clone (Fig. 5B). This data showed that two fragments, the 5.0- and 4.5-kb BamHI fragments, hybridized with the RACE probe indicating that both of these fragments contain exonic sequences, consistent with the previous results discussed. The 4.5-kb BamHI fragment hybridizes due to sequences from the coding exon that are contained within it. The 5.0-kb BamHI fragment, 0.5-5.5 kb 5′ from the ATG initiation codon, hybridizes because it must also contain exonic sequences for the m4 gene. Further upstream fragments also appear to give weak hybridization signals (Fig. 5B) but these are due to background as no hybridization is seen on a Southern blot of these fragments after separation on an agarose gel (Fig. 5D). To identify more closely which sequences from the 5.0-kb BamHI fragment were hybridizing and thus contained exonic material, a 9.8-kb KpnI fragment, containing 1.6 kb of the coding exon at its 3′ end and 8.2 kb of sequence 5′ to the coding exon, was subcloned into pGEM 7Zf(+) (Fig. 5D). This construct was cut with various restriction enzymes and the DNA fragments were separated on an agarose gel, transferred to a nylon membrane, and hybridized with the RACE probe (Fig. 5D). The 1-kb PstI fragment and the larger hybridizing fragments (>5 kb), seen in the HindIII, BamHI/SalI, and HindIII/SalI lanes are all due to hybridization with sequences in the coding exon. The smallest upstream DNA fragment that hybridizes is the 1.2-kb HindIII/SalI fragment suggesting that the upstream exon, or exons, are present within this fragment of DNA. However, the possibility that further exonic sequences are present upstream of this cannot be eliminated because the RACE probe produced may be not fully extended to the 5′ end of the m4 mRNA. To determine the size and number of the upstream exons an S1 nuclease analysis was performed. Two fragments of DNA from the R3-6 clone were used for this analysis in independent hybridizations. First, the 9.8-kb KpnI fragment (see Fig. 5D), which contains part of the coding exon and upstream sequences for the m4 gene, and the 4.5-kb BamHI fragment (see Fig. 5D) which is completely contained within the 9.8-kb KpnI fragment and contains upstream sequences for the m4 gene but none of the coding exon. The use of two fragments for this analysis allows the resolution of protected sequences due to hybridization with m4 mRNA from any artifacts, as the protected sequences due to upstream exons will be the same size for both of these fragments. In addition the use of RNA from PC12 cells (which express the m4 gene) and CHO cells (which do not express the m4 gene) aids in the identification of m4 specific protected fragments. Protected fragments are present in the S1 nuclease analysis of PC12 RNA with both DNA fragments (Fig. 6, lanes B and C) but no protected fragments are seen with CHO RNA (Fig. 6, lane A). This is consistent with protected fragments resulting from hybridization of the DNA with m4 mRNA. Both DNA fragments show protected sequences of higher molecular weight than the 1.3-kb DNA size marker which are most likely the result of DNA:DNA hybridization between complementary strands of the plasmids. The 9.8-kb KpnI fragment shows a protected sequence that is approximately 950 bases in length. This fragment is likely to be due to hybridization with the m4 coding exon as it is of the correct size and no equivalent protected fragment is seen for the 5.0-kb BamHI fragment which does not contain any sequence from the m4 coding exon. Both the 4.5-kb BamHI and 9.8-kb KpnI fragments produce protected fragments of 460 bases, suggesting that this is the size of the upstream exonic material. This data, suggesting that the upstream exonic material is approximately 460 bases in length, is also in good agreement with the labeled 5′-RACE product of 560 bases obtained with the RACE amplification procedure (see Fig. 5A). As well as containing exonic material the RACE product also contains approximately 80 bases of the coding exon and primer sequences. Therefore the 560-bp 5′-RACE product contains approximately 480 bp of upstream exonic material. The non-coding exon and flanking sequences were subcloned and sequenced. Oligonucleotides were constructed from this sequence data and used in a PCR analysis of m4 cDNA and genomic DNA in order to map the size and boundaries of the non-coding exon. One of the oligonucleotides used, Rm4x2s produced a specific amplified product of 163 bp when used in conjunction with a primer derived from the coding exon, Rm4 63a. Sequencing of the PCR product showed that the coding exon extended 34 bp upstream of the initiating ATG. Examination of corresponding genomic sequence identified a consensus splice acceptor site and indicated the presence of a 4.8-kb intron separating the two exons. PCR analysis using a further upstream oligonucleotide, Rm4x4s and Rm4x2a, resulted in a 400-bp amplification product using either cDNA or plasmid DNA as template, indicating that the intervening sequence was a single contiguous exon. This region proved recalcitrant to standard PCR analysis. After trying several combinations of thermostable polymerases and denaturing agents, success was achieved by using Vent polymerase (New England Biolabs) in conjunction with 10% formamide and using a commensurately lowered annealing temperature of 55°C, a similar combination of conditions has been reported previously for amplification of problematic templates(24.Moreau A. Duez C. Dusart J. BioTechniques. 1994; 17: 233-234Google Scholar). Use of further upstream primers, including Rm4x18s, Rm4x810s, and Rm4x10s in concert with Rm4x4a resulted in amplified products of appropriate size when using plasmid DNA (279, 139, and 72 bp, respectively) but yielded no amplified products when using cDNA as template. Hence, there is no further exonic DNA upstream of base −27, the most 3′ base of primer Rm4x10s. This is consistent with hybridization analyses which demonstrated an absen"

In this paper we report a mutational study of these two residues to address their role in nucleotide selection. This study was carried out by means of a new kinetic analysis that takes advantage of the competition between DNA polymerization and 3′→5' exonuclease activity to measure the Km values for correct and incorrect nucleotides in steady-state conditions. This method is valid for any 3′→5' exonuclease-containing DNA polymerase, without any restriction concerning catalytic rates of nucleotide incorporation.The results showed that the discrimination factor achieved by φ29 DNA polymerase in the nucleotide binding step of DNA polymerization is 2.4 × 103, that is, a wrong nucleotide is bound with a 2.4 × 103-fold lower affinity than the correct one.

Comparison of the discrimination factors of mutants Y390S and Y390F strongly suggests that the phenyl ring of Tyr390 is directly involved in checking base-pairing correctness of the incoming nucleotide. One of the most remarkable properties of DNA polymerases is their ability to replicate DNA with a very high fidelity (10-5-10-8 errors/nucleotide) (Loeb and Kunkel, 1982; Echols and Goodman, 1991). This is much less than the error frequency of 2 × 10-1-6 × 10-3 errors per nucleotide polymerized, predicted on the basis of energy differences between correct and incorrect base pairs (Loeb and Kunkel, 1982). The accuracy of DNA polymerization is based upon template instruction, that is changed after each nucleotide incorporation event. Taking into account that DNA polymerases synthesize DNA at high velocity (100-1000 nucleotides/s) (Kornberg and Baker, 1992), their substrate specificity has to change very rapidly, while maintaining a strong discrimination against wrong nucleotides. The molecular mechanisms underlying this amazing behavior are poorly understood. The considerable accuracy of DNA synthesis is achieved by the sequential operation of two fidelity mechanisms: (a) selection of the correct deoxynucleoside triphosphate in the polymerization reaction (base selection) and (b) exonucleolytic removal of an incorrectly inserted deoxynucleoside monophosphate from the end of the growing chain (editing). For base selection, the most likely discrimination principle is a strict demand for the precise geometry of the Watson-Crick base pair. This requirement might be manifested either in a more rapid dissociation from the enzyme active site of an incorrect nucleotide or in a considerably slower phosphodiester bond formation for mispaired bases, or most likely both. Additional mechanisms based on intermediate conformational changes have been described to discriminate against incorrect incorporation (Wong et al., 1991). Besides, the addition of the next correct nucleotide onto a mismatch occurs at a very slow rate, stalling the polymerase after misincorporation, and, therefore, allowing time for the exonuclease activity to attack the mispaired primer terminus (Donlin et al., 1991; Carroll et al., 1991; reviewed in Johnson(1993)). In the absence of structural data, site-directed mutagenesis is a powerful tool to elucidate the contribution of individual amino acid residues of the DNA polymerization site to the fine nucleotide selection exhibited by most replication enzymes. However, very few studies have addressed properly the fidelity of mutant DNA polymerases. The high catalytic rate of nucleotide incorporation compromises the utilization of standard steady-state methods to describe the kinetic properties of DNA polymerization. Besides this, most DNA polymerases contain a 3′→5' exonuclease activity that competes with DNA synthesis, this competition being unbalanced toward exonucleolytic degradation in the case of polymerization mutants, where nucleotide incorporation is impaired. Whereas this second point can be overcome by using exonuclease-deficient mutants, the study of very fast reactions in appropriate time windows seems to require rapid quench-flow techniques (Patel et al., 1991; Wong et al., 1991; Eger et al., 1991; Hsieh et al., 1993). In this paper we report that meaningful biochemical information can be obtained from steady-state kinetics when the exonuclease activity is allowed to compete with DNA polymerization. We are using this approach to study the molecular mechanisms of DNA replication fidelity using φ29 DNA polymerase as model. This polymerase provides a simple and well-characterized model for studying template-directed DNA synthesis and identifying which amino acid side chains participate in substrate selection and catalysis of phosphodiester bond formation. Extensive site-directed mutagenesis studies based on amino acid sequence comparison have allowed us to define the functional role for most of the residues belonging to highly conserved motifs in DNA polymerases (reviewed in Blanco and Salas(1995)). This large collection of φ29 DNA polymerase mutants is now available to elucidate the contribution of individual amino acids of the active center to the mechanisms maintaining fidelity. Furthermore, a basic kinetic and fidelity description of both DNA replication and protein-primed initiation has been reported for φ29 DNA polymerase (Esteban et al., 1993). Recent structural and kinetic data indicate that polymerases achieve selectivity by mechanisms that differ in detail, although, from the available evidence, it is accepted that all polymerases follow general fidelity principles for base selection and editing (Echols and Goodman, 1991). Therefore, the conclusions to be drawn from φ29 DNA polymerase (a prototype enzyme for eukaryotic-type DNA polymerases) will shed some light into the basic mechanisms maintaining fidelity. For the present study we have chosen two φ29 DNA polymerase residues: Tyr254 and Tyr390. They belong to the highly conserved motifs DXXSLYP (region 1 according to Blanco et al.(1991), region A according to Delarue et al.(1990)) and KXXXNSLYG (region 2a according to Blanco et al.(1991), region B according to Delarue et al.(1990)), respectively. The conservative mutations Y254F, Y390S, and Y390F were reported to show a defective dNTP binding affinity, closely related to a template-dependent hypersensitivity to nucleotide analogs, such as 2-(p-n-butylanilino)dATP and N2-(p-n-butylphenyl)dGTP (Blasco et al., 1992). Therefore, these DNA polymerase mutants appeared as ideal candidates for fidelity studies. Ultrapure unlabeled dNTPs were from Pharmacia Biotech Inc.; [γ-32P]ATP (3,000 Ci/mmol) was obtained from Amersham International Plc. T4 polynucleotide kinase was purchased from New England Biolabs. Wild-type φ29 DNA polymerase and mutant derivatives Y254F, Y390F, and Y390S (Blasco et al., 1992) were purified as described by Lázaro et al.(1995). Complementary single-stranded oligonucleotides SP1 (15-mer) (5′-GATCACAGTGAGTAC) and SP1c+6 (21-mer) (5′-TCTATTGTACTCACTG TGATC) were synthesized and purified by 20% polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Oligonucleotide SP1 was 5′-labeled with [γ-32P]ATP and T4 polynucleotide kinase and further purified by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The specific activity obtained was 2.5 × 105 cpm/pmol. The primer-template 5′-32P-labeled SP1/SP1c+6 molecule was obtained by hybridization between SP1 and SP1c+6. φ29 DNA polymerases, wild-type or mutants, were allowed to interact with template-primer DNA (SP1/SP1c+6) at equilibrium by preincubating for 5 min at 0°C all the components of the final reaction mixture, except the metal activator. Then the incubation mixture was tempered to 30°C, and the reactions started by adding MgCl2. The reaction samples contained, in 12 μl, 50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 1 mM dithiothreitol, 4% glycerol, 0.1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 1 nM 5′-32P-labeled SP1/SP1c+6, 75 nM wild-type or mutant φ29 DNA polymerase, 10 mM MgCl2, 20 nM dATP, and 10 μM dCTP, to prevent exonucleolytic degradation of the primer DNA. In the case of wild-type and mutant Y390S proteins, the incubation times ranged from 1 to 5 min and from 2 s to 4 min, in the case of mutants Y254F and Y390F. Samples were stopped by adding EDTA up to 100 mM and analyzed by 8 M urea-20% polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, autoradiography, and densitometry. DNA template-primer and φ29 DNA polymerase were preincubated as described above. Reaction mixtures contained, in 12 μl, 50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 1 mM dithiothreitol, 4% glycerol, 0.1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 75 nM φ29 DNA polymerase, 10 mM MgCl2, 2 μM dATP, and 10 μM dCTP, and a template-primer concentration ranging from 1 to 100 nM. After tempering for 30 s at 30°C, reactions were started by adding the metal activator and stopped after 2 min by adding EDTA up to 100 mM. The samples were processed as described above. φ29 DNA polymerase and the DNA template-primer were preincubated as described above. Then, the incubation mixture was tempered to 30°C, and the reactions started by adding MgCl2. The final reaction mixture contained, in 12 μl, 50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 1 mM dithiothreitol, 4% glycerol, 0.1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 1 nM 5′-32P-labeled SP1/SP1c+6, 75 nM wild-type or mutant φ29 DNA polymerase, 10 mM MgCl2, and various concentrations of dATP, ranging at least two orders of magnitude. In every experiment, 10 μM dCTP was included to prevent exonucleolytic degradation of the DNA template-primer. After incubation at 30°C for 15 s in the case of φ29 DNA polymerase mutants Y390F and Y254F, or 2 min in the case of wild-type or mutant Y390S, reactions were stopped with EDTA up to 100 mM. The samples were analyzed by 8 M urea-20% polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and autoradiography. The amount of the different elongation products as well as the nonelongated primer was quantified by densitometry of the autoradiograph. The ratio between the 17-mer and the 16-mer elongation products (two-nucleotide and one-nucleotide additions on the SP1 primer, respectively) was calculated and plotted against the dATP concentration, according to the theoretical method described in the text. The graphs were fitted to rectangular hyperbolas by nonlinear regression analysis using both the Newton and the steepest-descent methods. The kinetic parameters were obtained as described in the text. The reaction mixtures were as described above but, in this case, 20 μM dATP was included. This concentration was proven to be enough for the two first correct incorporations. For the incorrect nucleotide insertion on the third position of the template, different dCTP concentrations were assayed within a range of at least one order of magnitude. The dATP concentration present in the reaction mixtures also allows the incorporation of the next correct nucleotide onto the mismatch. The ratio between the error-containing elongation products (misinsertion, 18-mer, and mismatch elongation, 19-mer) and the last correctly paired elongation product (17-mer) was calculated and plotted against dCTP (incorrect nucleotide) concentration. The experimental data were fitted to a rectangular hyperbola to calculate the kinetic parameters described in the text. In the case of mutant Y390F, the highest dCTP concentrations assayed produced a severe inhibition of nucleotide insertion. Therefore, these concentrations were discarded to calculate nucleotide insertion parameters and only the initial slope of the curve was considered. Kinetics of single nucleotide incorporation catalyzed by DNA polymerases follow single or double exponential behavior (depending on experimental conditions), that usually reach equilibrium in the millisecond time scale (Patel et al., 1991). This rapid nucleotide insertion makes the steady-state studies difficult to interpret, because, in most of the cases, the rate-limiting step is DNA dissociation from the enzyme. Therefore, the information concerning the fast catalytic step is usually missed or mistaken. We have studied the influence of 3′→5' exonuclease activity on DNA polymerization kinetics. The mathematical treatment of pre-steady-state kinetics becomes considerably more complex when the exonuclease activity is included. However, we will show that, after the transient pre-steady-state, the final steady-state that is reached offers unambiguous information of some kinetic parameters governing DNA polymerization. This model represents a steady-state analysis of the competition between DNA polymerization and exonuclease activity (see below). Therefore, in order for this model to be applicable, two main conditions have to be fulfilled: DNA polymerase-DNA complex dissociation must not be rate-limiting, and solely the final steady-state phase of the time course has to be considered. First, we will describe the validity of this approach to study the kinetic parameters of correct and incorrect nucleotide incorporation catalyzed by the wild-type φ29 DNA polymerase. Then, we will apply this model to study the fidelity of Y254F, Y390S, and Y390F mutant derivatives of φ29 DNA polymerase, previously described as deficient in nucleotide binding. We have considered the insertion of a correct nucleotide on a homopolymer tract as template, in the presence of the exonuclease activity. Two conditions should be imposed. First, the initial primer (D0) has to be stable against exonucleolytic degradation, in order to keep constant the total amount of DNA template-primer in the reaction mixture. Second, the actual template has to be longer than the homopolymeric tract, to stop polymerization before reaching the end of the template. The reaction pathway that describes this system is shown in Fig. SI. In this scheme, E•Di stands for the binary complex formed by the i-mer primer DNA and DNA polymerase; kcat and kexa stand for the catalytic rates of DNA polymerization and exonuclease reactions, respectively; k1 and k-1 represent the association and dissociation rates, respectively, of nucleotide binding; n is the number of consecutive nucleotide incorporations allowed on the homopolymeric tract. Using steady-state kinetic analysis, the concentration of the different species can be derived as: Di=DT(kexokcat)n-i⋅(KMN)n-i1+(KMN+1)⋅∑i=0n-1(kexokcat)n-i⋅(KMN)n-i-1(Eq. 1) (Di⋅N)=DT(kexokcat)n-i⋅(KMN)n-i-11+(KMN+1)⋅∑i=0n-1(kexokcat)n-i⋅(KMN)n-i-1(Eq. 2) In these formulae, Di and (Di•N) represent the concentration of a certain DNA intermediate, i-bases long, and the complex i-mer DNA primer with the next nucleotide to be incorporated bound in its position, not yet catalyzed (see Fig. SI); both Di and (Di•N) stand for the corresponding complexes with DNA polymerase; Dt is the total amount of DNA polymerase/DNA complexes; N stands for dNTP concentration, and Km = (k-1+ kcat)/k1. These equations predict the steady-state distribution of the different elongated complexes as a function of kcat/kexa, Km, and nucleotide concentration. This theoretical distribution can be compared to experimental ones, generated at different dNTP concentrations, to fit the kinetic parameters kcat/kexa-1 and Km. A more straightforward approach can be followed by considering the ratio between the concentration of the two last elongated complexes (Dn and Dn): DnDn-1+(Dn-1⋅N)=kcatkexo⋅NN+Km(Eq. 3) The relative proportion between the two last DNA species appears as a function of nucleotide concentration, where kcat/kexa-1 and Km can be obtained from a nonlinear least square fit to the rectangular hyperbola. For a practical approach to this model, we used as DNA substrate a 5′-labeled 15/21-mer primer-template oligonucleotide, which allows the consecutive incorporation of two correct dAMP residues; that is, the homopolymeric tract is restricted to two nucleotides (see Fig. SII and Materials and Methods). Primer degradation was prevented by including 10 μM dCTP in all the experiments (this concentration was proven not to interfere with the incorporation of the correct dATP nucleotide; not shown). Using this experimental system, Dn/Dn (see Fig. SI) becomes D2/D1. As described previously, the mathematical treatment presented here is valid only if the steady-state has been reached, and the DNA polymerase/DNA complex dissociation is not rate-limiting in this steady-state. These two points were addressed and confirmed experimentally. The incubation time required to reach the steady-state was determined by following the time course of the reaction. In this experiment, a very low concentration of dATP (20 nM) was added, so as to evaluate the time course at a very slow forward rate, the enzyme being far away from its maximal velocity. The diagnostic feature of the steady-state is the invariance of all the elongation product concentrations. In our case, due to the low dATP concentration, the only elongation product is D1. As shown in Fig. 1, the intensity of the bands corresponding to D1 and D0 is invariant from the first time tested (1 min). To evaluate whether dissociation or dissociation-reassociation are rate-limiting steps in the reaction, another experiment was carried out with increasing amounts of template-primer DNA and a fixed concentration of φ29 DNA polymerase. As shown in Fig. 2, at the highest DNA concentrations, the relative proportions of elongated primers ((D1+ D2)/D0) is very low, indicating that φ29 DNA polymerase is titrated out. However, the proportion between the longest elongation product and the shortest one (D2/D1) is independent from the DNA polymerase/DNA ratio. These results indicate that φ29 DNA polymerase is not being dissociated from the template, and, therefore, complex dissociation does not influence the final steady-state. Correct nucleotide insertion kinetics were carried out at different dATP concentrations, which bracketed the Km value for this nucleotide, allowing the system to reach steady-state conditions. The ratio between the intensity of bands D2 and D1 was calculated and plotted against dATP concentration (see Fig. 3). Experimental data were fitted to by nonlinear regression analysis, and Km and kcat/kexa were estimated as 0.5 μM and 2.6, respectively (see Table 1).Tabled 1 Open table in a new tab To study the incorporation of a wrong nucleotide, the same 5′-labeled 15/21-mer primer-template molecule was used. In this case, a sufficient concentration (20 μM) of dATP was included to allow the incorporation of the first two correct nucleotides. The misincorporation of C opposite A in the template was monitored at different dCTP concentrations. The dATP concentration present in the experiment allows the elongation of the mispairs using the next T in the template (see Fig. SIII). In this model, kerr and kext are the catalytic rates for inserting an incorrect nucleotide and extending it with a correct one, respectively; k2 and k-2 stand for the association and dissociation rates, respectively, of dCTP binding; k3 and k-3 represent the association and dissociation rates, respectively, for binding the next correct nucleotide; kexa, kexol, and kexo2err are the catalytic rates of the exonuclease reaction on the properly paired primer terminus, on the mismatched one, and on the correctly elongated mismatch, respectively. The steady-state analysis of this system leads to the following equations: D2=DT⋅kcat2⋅kexol⋅kexo2⋅N2⋅Kmerr⋅KmextS(Eq. 4) (D2⋅I)=DT⋅kcat2⋅kexol⋅kexo2⋅N2⋅I⋅KmextS(Eq. 5) D3=DT⋅kcat2⋅kerr⋅kexo2⋅N2⋅I⋅KmextS(Eq. 6) (D3.N)=DT⋅kcat2⋅kerr⋅kexo2⋅N3⋅IS(Eq. 7) D4=DT⋅kcat2⋅kerr⋅kext⋅N3⋅IS(Eq. 8) where D2, (D2•I), D3, (D3•N), and D4 are the different elongation products in the polymerization process (positions 17, 18, and 19, respectively; see oligonucleotide sequence in Fig. SIII). These DNA products are assumed to be always forming a complex with the enzyme. Dt is the total amount of DNA polymerase/DNA complexes. N and I represent the correct and incorrect nucleotide concentrations, respectively. The different affinity constants are defined as follows: Kmerr=k-2+kerrk2(Eq. 9) and Kmerr=k-3+kextk3(Eq. 10) S stands for the following expression: S=kexo2⋅kexol⋅kexo2⋅Kmext⋅Kmerr⋅Km2+kexo2⋅kexol⋅kexo2⋅Kmext⋅Kmerr⋅Km⋅N+kexo⋅kexol⋅kexo2⋅kcat⋅Kmext⋅Kmerr⋅Km⋅N+kerr⋅kexo2⋅kcat2⋅Kmext⋅N2⋅I+kexo⋅kexol⋅kexo2⋅kcat⋅Kmext⋅Kmerr⋅N2+kexol⋅kexo2⋅Kcat2⋅Kmext⋅Kmerr⋅N2+kerr⋅kexo2⋅kcat2⋅N3⋅I+kext⋅kerr⋅kcat2⋅N3⋅I+kexol⋅kexo2+kcat2⋅Kmext⋅N2⋅I(Eq. 11) Km stands for the Michaelis constant of the two first correct nucleotide insertions, as defined for. The ratio between the error-containing products (positions D3 plus D4) and the correct nucleotide insertion (position D2) gives us the following result: D3+(D3⋅N)+D4D2+(D2⋅I)=kerr⋅(kext⋅N+kexo2⋅N+kexo2⋅Kmext)kexol⋅kexo2⋅Kmext⋅IKmerr+I(Eq. 12) Therefore, this ratio versus the concentration of the incorrect nucleotide (I) would give a rectangular hyperbola, from which the Km for the incorrect nucleotide (Km) can be obtained. The incubation times required to reach the steady-state, as well as the absence of a DNA dissociation rate-limiting step, were assessed as described for the correct nucleotide (not shown). The incorporation of the incorrect nucleotide was measured at different dCTP concentrations, and the ratio (D3+ D4)/D2 was calculated. The experimental data were fitted to by nonlinear regression analysis. The results are shown in Fig. 4(see also Table 1). φ29 DNA polymerase mutants Y254F, Y390F, and Y390S have been described as affected in dNTP binding (Blasco et al., 1992). Nevertheless, their deficiency in dNTP affinity could not be precisely assessed because Km could not be determined either for the wild type or for the mutant DNA polymerases. We have applied the exonuclease-polymerization competition model, presented above, to study the steady-state kinetics of correct and incorrect nucleotide incorporation catalyzed by φ29 DNA polymerase mutants Y254F, Y390F, and Y390S. As described for the wild-type enzyme, the absence of a rate-limiting DNA dissociation step and the incubation time required to reach steady-state conditions were evaluated experimentally for each mutant (not shown). In the case of mutants Y254F and Y390F, we observed that long incubation periods led to exonucleolytic degradation of most of the DNA primer substrate (not shown). This is probably due to their reduced DNA polymerization rate, that renders the standard dCTP concentration insufficient for protecting against their exonuclease activity. In order to avoid potential interferences with the incorporation of the correct nucleotide and taking into account that steady-state conditions were achieved after 10 s (not shown), we decided to use shorter incubation times (15 s) rather than to increase dCTP concentrations. It is worthy to note that, using this experimental approach, the incubation time is not relevant, as long as the steady-state has been reached. The incorporation of correct (dATP) and incorrect (dCTP) nucleotides were evaluated at different dNTP concentrations, and the experimental data were analyzed as described for the wild-type enzyme. The results are shown in Fig. 5. Concerning the incorporation of the correct nucleotide, mutants Y254F, Y390F, and Y390S showed 10, 4.6, and 14-fold, respectively, reduction in dNTP affinity, compared to the wild-type φ29 DNA polymerase (see Table 1). The discrimination factor achieved during nucleotide binding can be obtained from the different affinity for correct and incorrect nucleotides and represented by fdis = Km (incorrect)/Km (correct). This factor was calculated for the wild-type and mutant φ29 DNA polymerases and is shown in Table 1. Proteins Y254F and Y390S showed a reduced discrimination ability (7.0 × 102 and 2.9 × 102, respectively), whereas the discrimination value of Y390F (>1.9 × 103) was quite similar to the one of the wild-type enzyme (2.4 × 103). The quantification of these effects is also shown in Table 1, as relative discrimination factors, that were calculated relative to the wild-type enzyme. Since the first reports of in vitro studies concerning the fidelity of DNA polymerization (Trautner et al., 1962; Hall and Lehman, 1968; Brutlag and Kornberg, 1972), a large number of DNA polymerases have been purified and their accuracies measured experimentally (reviewed in Echols and Goodman(1991), Kunkel(1992), Johnson(1993)). Based on these studies, the general strategies for achieving faithful DNA synthesis have been enlightened (reviewed in Johnson(1993)). Presently, many DNA polymerase studies are devoted to understand how the active center of these enzymes promotes such a highly selective reaction mechanism. In this work, we have presented a new model for studying DNA polymerization kinetics in steady-state conditions, and we have applied it to get some insight into the molecular mechanisms of fidelity, operating at the active center of φ29 DNA polymerase. Various steady-state methods to study DNA polymerization on synthetic templates have been used widely (Boosalis et al., 1987; El-Deiry et al., 1988; Polesky et al., 1990; Reha-Krantz et al., 1991; Bakhanashvili and Hizi, 1992a and 1992b; Creighton et al., 1992; Varela-Echavarría et al., 1992; Copeland et al., 1993; Dong et al., 1993a, 1993b; Khan et al., 1994; Astatke et al., 1995). The information that can be obtained from these analyses is often compromised by the fact that DNA polymerase/DNA complex dissociation is rate-limiting in most of the steady-state kinetics of DNA polymerization. On the other hand, the presence of a 3′→5' exonuclease activity associated with many DNA polymerases makes it more difficult to correlate the experimental data with the kinetic parameters governing DNA polymerization. In this situation, an apparent Km is usually reported that simply reflects the nucleotide concentration at which half of the maximal rate of nucleotide incorporation is achieved. However, this parameter has no explicit relation with nucleotide binding affinity. In this paper, we propose a general method to calculate the true Km values for correct and incorrect nucleotides overcoming these limitations. As true Km, we consider its original explicit definition: Km = (k-1+ kcat)/k1. The kinetic analysis proposed here takes advantage of the 3′→5' exonuclease activity to compete DNA polymerization, leading to a true steady-state. Once this state has been reached, the relative amount of each DNA elongation product remains constant with time. This situation should not be taken as an equilibrium state, as there is a continuous (steady) interconversion between the different DNA products by means of deoxynucleoside triphosphate use and monophosphate production. Therefore, in order to apply this method to different systems, it has to be explicitly verified that the early transient stage of DNA product rearrangement is overcome. This requirement was specifically met with the wild-type and mutant φ29 DNA polymerases presented in this study. Another key feature of this model, noticeable from Schemes I, II, and III, is the absence of dissociation rates (koff). As described in the text, all the DNA species are considered as DNA polymerase/DNA complexes, therefore, competent for nucleotide insertion or exonucleolytic degradation. The avoidance of dissociation and association steps between DNA polymerase and DNA allows a more straightforward interpretation of the experimental data in terms of the catalytically relevant rate constants. However, the experimental conditions have to be designed in order to fulfill the requirement for a DNA dissociation-independent reaction pathway. As demonstrated in the DNA titration experiment (this paper), φ29 DNA polymerase is able to remain stably bound to the template/primer, even when it has been stalled by the absence of the next correct nucleotide. In this experiment, the probability of inserting one or two nucleotides was measured at different DNA polymerase/DNA ratios. If the insertion of the second nucleotide is mediated by DNA polymerase dissociation and reasso"

The lack of a protein-tyrosine kinase domain in v-Crk suggests its co-operation with cellular protein-tyrosine kinase activity. We have shown that suppression of a certain fraction of c-Src activity by Csk may require the binding of Csk to tyrosine-phosphorylated paxillin. In this study, we detected co-immunoprecipitation of tyrosine-phosphorylated paxillin with v-Crk in CT10-transformed chicken embryo fibroblasts (CEF), and demonstrated that v-Crk binding to paxillin can inhibit Csk binding to paxillin. A phosphotyrosine peptide, which can inhibit v-Crk binding to paxillin, did not inhibit Csk binding to paxillin, suggesting that v-Crk and Csk bind to different tyrosine-phosphorylated sites in paxillin. We also found that the kinase activity of the endogenous c-Src in CEF is elevated severalfold after CT10-transformation. We therefore suggest that the competitive binding of overexpressed v-Crk affects an efficient interaction of Csk with tyrosine-phosphorylated paxillin in CT10-transformed CEF. This would result in a failure in the suppression of the kinase activities of a population of c-Src and other Src family protein-tyrosine kinases as well, and these kinases may then contribute to the phosphorylation of cellular proteins in CT10-transformed CEF. p47gag-crk (v-Crk) encoded by avian sarcoma virus CT10, causes an elevation of tyrosine phosphorylation of several cellular proteins.

Although v-Crk shows no intrinsic protein-tyrosine kinase activity, an increase in protein tyrosine phosphorylation of several proteins (130, 125, 110, and 70-75 kDa) accompanies cellular transformation of chicken embryo fibroblasts (CEF) by the CT10 virus(1.Mayer B.J.

Deletion mutations within the SH2 domain of v-Crk abolish the transforming capacity of the protein, and such mutants fail to increase cellular protein tyrosine phosphorylation(6.Matsuda M. Mayer B.J.

The binding of the v-Crk SH2 domain to tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins has also been demonstrated to protect them from dephosphorylation by protein-tyrosine phosphatase activities(8.Birge R.B.

Thus, highly expressed v-Crk in transformed cells seems to cooperate with or activate some cellular protein-tyrosine kinase activities(5.Mayer B.J. Hanafusa H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Unlike in chicken cells, overexpression of v-Crk in rat cells does not cause efficient cell transformation(10.Sabe H. Okada M. Nakagawa H. Hanafusa H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 4706-4713Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). However, by overexpressing proteins via cDNA transfection, we previously showed that the kinase activity of c-Src can cooperate with v-Crk to increase cellular protein tyrosine phosphorylation and cause morphological transformation in rat 3Y1 cells(10.Sabe H. Okada M. Nakagawa H. Hanafusa H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 4706-4713Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). The kinase activity of the c-Src overexpressed with v-Crk was elevated 3-4-fold above basal levels, which may correspond to an activation of 10-20% of the total c-Src. The activation of c-Src kinase activity by v-Crk is indirect because no significant stable complex between c-Src and v-Crk was detected. This transformation, as well as the kinase activity of c-Src, can be suppressed to basal levels by overexpression of Csk in rat 3Y1 cells (10.Sabe H. Okada M. Nakagawa H. Hanafusa H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 4706-4713Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar), which has been shown to regulate the kinase activities of c-Src and several other Src family protein-tyrosine kinases by phosphorylation of their C-terminal tyrosine residues(11.Okada M.

In normal rat or chicken fibroblasts, we found that the major tyrosine-phosphorylated protein that binds to the Csk SH2 domain is a focal adhesion protein, paxillin (17.Turner C.E. Glenney Jr., J.R.

A minor fraction of Csk seems to associate with Focal Adhesion Kinase, pp125PAK(19.Sabe H. Hata A. Okada M. Nakagawa H. Hanafusa H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

It is conceivable that the anchoring of Csk to these proteins is required for its suppression of the activity of a certain fraction of c-Src as well as other Src family protein-tyrosine kinases, which may function at focal adhesion plaques(19.Sabe H. Hata A. Okada M. Nakagawa H. Hanafusa H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 3984-3988Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). In this study, we show that the activity of endogenous c-Src kinase is activated severalfold in CT10-transformed CEF. We also demonstrate that binding of v-Crk to paxillin (9.Birge R.B. Fajardo J.E. Reichman C. Shoelson S.E. Songyang Z. Cantley L.C. Hanafusa H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 4648-4656Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar) can inhibit the binding of Csk to paxillin, although the primary binding sites in paxillin for these proteins seem to differ. The binding of v-Crk to paxillin phosphorylated by Src protein-tyrosine kinase in vivo as well as in vitro but not by Csk was effectively inhibited by a peptide that specifically inhibited the binding of v-Crk to paxillin in v-Crk-transformed CEF. Therefore, we suggest that c-Src may participate in the phosphorylation of cellular proteins such as paxillin in CT10-transformed CEF. v-Crk binding to paxillin may account for the partial activation of c-Src in v-Crk-transformed cells. CEF cultures were prepared from 11-day-old chicken embryos and maintained in Scherer's medium contain-ing bovine calf serum (Hyclone)(22.Hanafusa H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Cells were solubilized by scraping directly on dishes in ice-cold 1% Nonidet P-40 buffer (1% Nonidet P-40, 20 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 150 mM NaCl, 5 mM EDTA, 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1% aprotinin, 2 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 mM Na3VO4, 10 μM Na2MoO4) or RIPA buffer (1% Nonidet P-40 buffer containing 1% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, and 10 mM NaF) after being washed briefly with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.05% EDTA and 0.1 mM Na3VO4. After incubating for 20 min on ice with occasional Vortex mixing, lysates were centrifuged for 10 min with 104× g at 4°C to remove insoluble materials. Protein concentrations of cell lysates were determined by the DC protein assay kit (Bio-Rad) using bovine serum albumin (BSA) as a standard. GST-Csk SH3/2 proteins containing both of the SH3 and SH2 domains of chicken Csk, its mutants within the SH2 domain, R106K and S108C, were prepared as described previously(19.Sabe H. Hata A. Okada M. Nakagawa H. Hanafusa H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 3984-3988Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). GST-v-Crk protein containing the Gag-v-Crk fragment was prepared as described previously(9.Birge R.B. Fajardo J.E. Reichman C. Shoelson S.E. Songyang Z. Cantley L.C. Hanafusa H. Mol. Cell.

Paxillin was immunoprecipitated from cell lysates prepared in RIPA buffer using an anti-paxillin antibody (Zymed) coupled to protein G-Sepharose (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.). v-Crk was immunoprecipitated from cell lysates prepared in 1% Nonidet P-40 buffer using an anti-Gag antibody (3C2) (23.Potts W.M. Olsen M. Boettiger D. Vogt V.M. J. Gen. Virol. 1987; 68: 3177-3182Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar) coupled to protein G-Sepharose. Csk was immunoprecipitated using protein A-purified anti-Csk polyclonal antibodies (gift from M. Okada and K. Tobe). For the precipitation using GST-fusion proteins, 250 μg of cell lysates prepared in 1% Nonidet P-40 buffer were incubated with 5 μg of GST-fusion proteins coupled to glutathione-Sepharose (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.) in a total volume of 300 μl for 30 min at 4°C, unless otherwise indicated. After being washed 4 times with respective buffer, the samples were boiled in Laemmli's SDS sample buffer and separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) (8% gel). After electrophoresis, the proteins were transferred to membrane filters (Immobilon P, Millipore), blocked with Tris-buffered saline containing 0.1% Tween 20 (Sigma) and 5% BSA (radioimmunoassay grade, Sigma), and probed with appropriate antibodies as described previously(10.Sabe H.

The antibodies retained on filter membranes were then detected by peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody and visualized by enzyme-linked chemiluminescence method according to the manufacture's instruction (ECL, Amersham Corp.). Anti-phosphotyrosine polyclonal antibodies were prepared against tyrosine-phosphorylated v-Abl proteins as described previously (24.Hamaguchi M. Grandori C. Hanafusa H. Mol. Cell.

Glenney) covalently coupled to Affi-Gel 10 (Bio-Rad). After being washed, paxillin was eluted from beads with 0.1 M glycine-HCl (pH 2.5); neutralized; and dialyzed against 20 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 0.14 M NaCl, and 1 mM EDTA as described previously(17.Turner C.E. Glenney Jr., J.R. Burridge K. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 111: 1059-1068Crossref PubMed Scopus (521) Google Scholar). 1 mg/ml acetylated BSA was added after paxillin was eluted from the beads. In vitro phosphorylation of paxillin was carried out in a kinase buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 0.1 mM Na3VO4, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 3 mM MgCl2, 3 mM MnCl2, 1 mg/ml acetylated BSA, 0.1 mM ATP) using 0.1 μg each of purified recombinant Csk (19.Sabe H.

Lewis A.J. Brugge J.S. J. Virol. 1983; 48: 352-360Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), coupled to protein A-Sepharose. After being washed 4 times with RIPA buffer and once with kinase buffer without divalent cations, aliquots of the samples were separated on SDS-PAGE (8% gel) and subjected to immunoblot analysis using Ab327 to quantify the relative amounts of c-Src protein in each sample. Then the samples, containing similar amounts of c-Src, were subjected to in vitro kinase assay with 10 μM ATP and 10 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP (3000 Ci/mmol, Amersham Corp.) in 50 μl of kinase buffer (20 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 5 mM MgCl2, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 0.1 mM Na3VO4) with 2 μg of acid-denatured enolase (Sigma) as a exogenous substrate, and incubated for 10 min at 30°C. The samples were run on SDS-PAGE (8% gel); the gel was then dried and exposed to film. The same amount of the samples used for in vitro kinase assay were again separated on SDS-PAGE (8% gel) and subjected to immunoblot analysis using Ab327 to quantitate the levels of c-Src protein. Specific activity was calculated by dividing each activity by the respective amount of c-Src protein quantitated by immunoblotting as described previously(19.Sabe H. Hata A. Okada M. Nakagawa H. Hanafusa H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 3984-3988Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). Affinity purification of phosphopeptides specific for GST-Csk SH3/2 has been described previously(27.Songyang Z. Shoelson S.E. McGlade J. Olivier P. Pawson T. Bustelo X.R. Barbacid M. Sabe H. Hanafusa H. Yi T. Ren R. Baltimore D. Ratnofsky S. Feldman R.A. Cantley L.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 2777-2785Crossref PubMed Scopus (828) Google Scholar). For the peptide synthesis, an Fmoc-based strategy for sequential peptide synthesis was used in combination with standard side chain-protecting groups as described previously(28.Domchek S. Auger K. Chatterjee S. Borke T. Shoelson S.E. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 9865-9870Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar, 29.Kitas E.A. Knorr R. Trzeciak A. Bannwarth W. Helv. Chim. Acta. 1991; 74: 1314-1328Crossref Scopus (117) Google Scholar), and N-Fmoc-O-(O)-dimethyloxyphosphoryl-L-tyrosine (Fmoc-Tyr-[OP(OCH3)2]) was used to incorporate phosphotyrosine(29.Kitas E.A. Knorr R. Trzeciak A. Bannwarth W. Helv. Chim. Acta. 1991; 74: 1314-1328Crossref Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Peptides were purified by preparative reversed-phase high pressure liquid chromatography(28.Domchek S. Auger K. Chatterjee S. Borke T. Shoelson S.E. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 9865-9870Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar), and purified products were analyzed by amino acid composition. Sequences used in this study were DNEpYTARNGAK (c-Src 416), PVSpYADMRTGI (IRS-1 1010), and DpYDAPA (Crk 1)(9.Birge R.B. Fajardo J.E. Reichman C. Shoelson S.E. Songyang Z. Cantley L.C. Hanafusa H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 4648-4656Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar, 30.Songyang Z. Shoelson S.E. Chaudhuri M. Gish G. Pawson T. Haser W.G. King F. Roberts T. Ratnofsky S. Leichleider R.J. Neel B.G. Birge R.B. Fajardo J.E. Chou M.M. Hanafusa H. Schaffhausen B. Cantley L.C. Cell. 1993; 72: 767-778Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2367) Google Scholar). Because c-Src activation was involved in v-Crk transformation of rat 3Y1 cells(10.Sabe H. Okada M. Nakagawa H. Hanafusa H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 4706-4713Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar), c-Src kinase activity may also be up-regulated in v-Crk-transformed chicken cells. Therefore, we examined the level of the kinase activity of endogenous c-Src in CT10-transformed CEF. With equivalent amounts of cell lysates, we noticed that the levels of c-Src protein immunoprecipitated with Ab327 from CT10-transformed CEF were often slightly lower than those from normal CEF. Thus we adjusted to use same amounts of c-Src protein in these in vitro kinase assay. As shown in Fig. 1, about 4-fold activation of the specific activity of c-Src kinase was detected in CT10-transformed cells using enolase as an exogenous substrate, as compared with that in normal CEF. The degree of the activation varied with each preparation of primary culture of CEF, but with five different preparations of CEF, we observed an average of 3-4-fold activation of the specific activity of the endogenous c-Src after transformation by the CT10 virus (data not shown). In 3Y1 cells, the specific activity of endogenous c-Src kinase was also activated to a similar level when cells were transformed by expression of v-Crk at high levels by cDNA transfection (data not shown). Again the protein levels of endogenous c-Src were significantly reduced (about 1.5-2-fold) in these cells (data not shown). Tyrosine phosphorylation of paxillin is highly elevated in v-Src-transformed cells(31.Glenney J.R. Zokas L. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 108: 2401-2408Crossref PubMed Scopus (354) Google Scholar). Elevation in the tyrosine phosphorylation of paxillin was also observed in CT10-transformed CEF (Fig. 2, A and D). Tyrosine phosphorylation of pp125PAK has also been shown to be increased 2-3-fold in CT10-transformed CEF as compared with normal CEF (3.Kanner S.B. Reynolds A.B. Vines R.R. Parsons J.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 3328-3332Crossref PubMed Scopus (396) Google Scholar) (also see Fig. 2A). To examine the binding of v-Crk protein to these tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins, we immunoprecipitated v-Crk protein with the 3C2 monoclonal antibody, which recognizes the Gag portion of the v-Crk protein. As shown in Fig. 2, paxillin was co-immunoprecipitated with v-Crk in CT10-transformed CEF (Fig. 2), as has been shown using the GST fusion form of v-Crk SH2 domain in vitro(9.Birge R.B. Fajardo J.E. Reichman C. Shoelson S.E. Songyang Z. Cantley L.C. Hanafusa H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 4648-4656Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar). On the other hand, co-immunoprecipitation of pp125PAK and v-Crk was not detected under these conditions (Fig. 2C). The GST fusion form of the Csk SH3 and SH2 (Csk SH3/2) domains binds to tyrosine-phosphorylated forms of paxillin and pp125PAK in CT10-transformed CEF cell lysates, as shown previously with normal CEF cell lysates(19.Sabe H. Hata A. Okada M. Nakagawa H. Hanafusa H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 3984-3988Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). Mutations in the SH2 domain of Csk such as R106K and S108C (19.Sabe H. Hata A. Okada M. Nakagawa H. Hanafusa H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 3984-3988Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar) reduced its binding to these proteins, suggesting that binding was primarily mediated by the SH2 domain. We have shown that both c-Src and Csk can phosphorylate paxillin on tyrosine residues generating slow migrating isoforms of paxillin (19.Sabe H. Hata A. Okada M. Nakagawa H. Hanafusa H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 3984-3988Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). ( (2)H. Sabe, A. Imamoto, P. Soriano, M. D. Schaller, J. T. Pawsons, and H. Hanafusa, submitted for publication.) Both of these kinases phosphorylate paxillin at multiple sites, but they generate isoforms of paxillin that migrate differently on SDS-PAGE2 (also see Fig. 3). As shown in Fig. 3, GST fusion forms of v-Crk and Csk SH3/2 were able to bind to both forms of these slow migrating paxillin phosphorylated in vitro either by Csk or by c-Src. Tyrosine phosphorylation of slow migrating paxillin was confirmed by immunoblotting using polyclonal anti-phosphotyrosine antibodies (data not shown). It has been shown that even subnanomolar concentrations of the v-Crk SH2 domain fused to GST can bind to tyrosine-phosphorylated paxillin in cell lysates of CT10-transformed CEF(9.Birge R.B. Fajardo J.E. Reichman C. Shoelson S.E. Songyang Z. Cantley L.C. Hanafusa H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 4648-4656Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar). Under similar conditions, we assessed an apparent binding affinity of Csk SH3/2 to paxillin from CT10-transformed CEF. A titration experiment showed that half maximal binding was observed at around 10-20 nM of the GST-Csk SH3/2 protein (Fig. 4A), an affinity that is severalfold weaker than that of v-Crk binding to paxillin. We next examined the possible competition of binding of Csk and v-Crk toward paxillin. Cell lysates from CT10-transformed CEF were preincubated with either purified recombinant v-Crk or purified recombinant Csk, and then the binding of cellular tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins to GST-Csk SH3/2 was analyzed. As shown in Fig. 5A, in the presence of almost equimolar concentrations of recombinant Csk (5 μg, 50-kDa) and GST-Csk SH3/2 (4 μg, 46-kDa), the binding of GST-Csk SH3/2 to paxillin was reduced to half (55% reduction quantitated with a densitometer). On the other hand, substantial inhibition (88% reduction quantitated with a densitometer) of GST-Csk SH3/2 binding to paxillin was observed when it was preincubated with equimolar concentrations of recombinant v-Crk (5 μg, 47 kDa). The binding of GST-Csk SH3/2 to pp125PAK was also reduced to about half in the presence of 5 μg of recombinant Csk, whereas only a slight reduction in the binding of Csk SH3/2 to pp125PAK was observed by recombinant v-Crk (Fig. 5B). To verify whether the concentration of the v-Crk protein in CT10-transformed CEF is high enough to inhibit the binding of Csk to tyrosine-phosphorylated paxillin, we measured the cellular levels of v-Crk and Csk. In 50 μg of lysate of transformed CEF prepared with 1% Nonidet P-40 buffer, the level of the v-Crk protein was found to be approximately 100-300 ng, whereas the amount of Csk was approximately 1-3 ng (Fig. 4, B and C). Therefore, the molar concentration of v-Crk appears to be almost 100 times that of Csk in CT10-transformed CEF. We then tried to assess whether this type of inhibition by v-Crk was taken place in CT10-transformed cells. Csk has been shown to be co-precipitated clearly with paxillin when Csk was overexpressed(19.Sabe H. Hata A. Okada M. Nakagawa H. Hanafusa H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 3984-3988Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). With endogenous Csk, however, it was relatively difficult to show such a high level of co-precipitation of paxillin (data not shown). Therefore, we used cell lysates prepared at high protein concentrations, and purified anti-Csk antibodies to avoid nonspecific binding of paxillin to rabbit serum. As shown in Fig. 5C, a higher level of paxillin was detected in a Csk immunoprecipitant from CEF than that from CT10-transformed CEF. By analysis of specific binding of each SH2-domain to a degenerate phosphopeptide library, a consensus amino acid sequence of pY(T/A)XX was identified for optimal Csk SH2 binding, whereas a pYXXP sequence for the v-Crk SH2 domain was determined(27.Songyang Z. Shoelson S.E. McGlade J. Olivier P. Pawson T. Bustelo X.R. Barbacid M. Sabe H. Hanafusa H. Yi T. Ren R. Baltimore D. Ratnofsky S. Feldman R.A. Cantley L.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 2777-2785Crossref PubMed Scopus (828) Google Scholar, 30.Songyang Z. Shoelson S.E. Chaudhuri M. Gish G. Pawson T. Haser W.G. King F. Roberts T. Ratnofsky S. Leichleider R.J. Neel B.G. Birge R.B. Fajardo J.E. Chou M.M. Hanafusa H. Schaffhausen B. Cantley L.C. Cell. 1993; 72: 767-778Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2367) Google Scholar). Using phosphopeptides containing these sequences, we examined difference in the binding of the SH2 domains of Csk and v-Crk toward paxillin in cell lysates prepared from CT10- transformed CEF. Preincubation of GST-v-Crk with 500 μM of the Crk binding peptide, DpYDAPA, almost completely inhibited its binding to paxillin (70-75-kDa), but only slightly inhibited its binding to proteins of 110 and 130-kDa in size, as reported previously (9.Birge R.B. Fajardo J.E. Reichman C. Shoelson S.E. Songyang Z. Cantley L.C. Hanafusa H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 4648-4656Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar) (Fig. 6A). On the other hand, the same peptide was totally ineffective in inhibition of the binding of GST-Csk SH3/2 to tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins, including paxillin (Fig. 6A). Two phosphopeptides containing pY(T/A)XX sequences, PVSpYADMRTGI and DNEpYTARGAK, significantly reduced the GST-Csk SH3/2 binding to pp125PAK (Fig. 6A). Only a marginal inhibition in the binding of the GST-Csk SH3/2 to paxillin was observed with these two peptides (Fig. 6A). These two peptides were totally ineffective in inhibition of the v-Crk binding to tyrosine phosphorylated proteins, including paxillin (Fig. 6A). Similar experiments were also performed using cell lysates prepared from v-Src-transformed CEF. Again, the peptide with the pYXXP motif inhibited the binding of GST-v-Crk to paxillin very effectively (Fig. 6B). The two peptides with pY(T/A)XX motifs partially reduced the GST-Csk SH3/2 binding to proteins of 110-130-kDa, while little inhibition was observed in its binding to paxillin (Fig. 6). The PVSpYADMRTGI peptide seemed to be slightly more effective than the DNEpYTARGAK peptide in their inhibition of GST-Csk SH3/2 to these high molecular weight proteins (Fig. 6B). Paxillin seems to have multiple tyrosine phosphorylation sites.2 The experiment described above suggested that the kinase(s), which are involved in the tyrosine phosphorylation of paxillin in CT10-transformed CEF, may have a substrate specificity similar to v-Src. To obtain a clue to the nature of the protein-tyrosine kinase(s) phosphorylating paxillin in CT10-transformed cells, we examined the ability of these peptides to inhibit the binding of v-Crk to paxillin phosphorylated in vitro. As shown in Fig. 6C, the peptide with the pYXXP motif was very effective in inhibition of GST-v-Crk binding to paxillin phosphorylated by c-Src. However, it exhibited a partial inhibition in the case of GST-v-Crk binding to paxillin phosphorylated by Csk. Two other kinds of peptides with pY(T/A)XX motifs were totally ineffective in the inhibition of v-Crk binding to these in vitro phosphorylated paxillin isoforms. None of these phosphopeptides significantly inhibited Csk SH3/2 binding to paxillin phosphorylated in vitro by either kinase (Fig. 6C). In this report, we showed that both v-Crk and Csk bind to tyrosine-phosphorylated paxillin, at primarily different sites from each other as assessed by the phosphopeptide inhibition assay. However, we demonstrated that v-Crk binding has a potential to block the binding of Csk to paxillin phosphorylated in CT10-transformed cells. No significant physical complex formation between Csk and v-Crk was observed(10.Sabe H. Okada M. Nakagawa H. Hanafusa H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 4706-4713Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Therefore, this binding competition seems to be due to steric hindrance. The 100-fold higher cellular concentration of v-Crk over Csk in CT10-transformed CEF, as well as the stronger affinity of v-Crk for paxillin than that of Csk for paxillin suggests that a significant inhibition of binding of Csk to paxillin can take place in CT10-transformed CEF. We also showed that the specific activity of c-Src kinase in CT10-transformed CEF is elevated severalfold over that in normal cells. Immunohistochemical staining of c-Src protein had revealed that the majority of c-Src seems to localize at cell-to-cell adhesion junctions, juxtanuclear regions, and centrosomes(32.David-Pfeuty T. Nouvian-Dooghe Y. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 111: 3097-3116Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). However, an increasing number of studies have suggested that c-Src localizes to and may have a function at focal adhesions; an activated form of c-Src has been shown to bind to pp125PAK via its SH2 domain(33.Cobb B.S. Schaller M.D. Leu T.-H. Parsons J.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 147-155Crossref PubMed Scopus (482) Google Scholar, 34.Schaller M.D. Hildebrand J.D. Shannon J.D. Fox J.W. Vines R.R. Parsons J.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 14: 1680-1688Crossref Scopus (1111) Google Scholar) and is also able to bind to paxillin through its SH3 domain(35.Weng Z. Taylor J.A. Turner C.E. Brugge J.S. Seidel-Dugan C. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 14956-14963Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We have indicated that Csk binds to focal adhesion proteins to suppress c-Src kinase activity(19.Sabe H. Hata A. Okada M. Nakagawa H. Hanafusa H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 3984-3988Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). Our model is consistent with the observation that Csk colocalizes with activated c-Src to cellular structures resembling podosomes(36.Howell B.W. Cooper J.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 5402-5411Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the kinase activity of a certain fraction of cellular c-Src is regulated by cell to substratum adhesion(19.Sabe H. Hata A. Okada M. Nakagawa H. Hanafusa H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 3984-3988Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). Failure to find c-Src at focal adhesion plaques by immunostaining analysis (32.David-Pfeuty T. Nouvian-Dooghe Y. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 111: 3097-3116Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar) may be due to the fact that only a small fraction of c-Src can localize to focal adhesion plaques (19.Sabe H. Hata A. Okada M. Nakagawa H. Hanafusa H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 3984-3988Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). Or, only when activated, c-Src can stay stably at focal adhesion plaques through the binding of its SH2 domains with several focal adhesion proteins including pp125PAK(33.Cobb B.S. Schaller M.D. Leu T.-H. Parsons J.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 147-155Crossref PubMed Scopus (482) Google Scholar, 34.Schaller M.D. Hildebrand J.D. Shannon J.D. Fox J.W. Vines R.R. Parsons J.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 14: 1680-1688Crossref Scopus (1111) Google Scholar). Because v-Crk overexpressed in CT10-transformed cells can block the binding of Csk to paxillin, it is likely that the negative regulation of c-Src by Csk through Csk's binding to paxillin can be reduced and thus results in activation of the kinase activity of a certain fraction of c-Src. This mechanism may also explain why only a small fraction of cellular c-Src appears to be activated in CT10-transformed CEF (Fig. 1) as well as in rat 3Y1 cells overexpressing both c-Src and v-Crk as we have shown previously(10.Sabe H. Okada M. Nakagawa H. Hanafusa H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 4706-4713Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Among Src family protein-tyrosine kinases, Fyn also has been shown to bind to pp125PAK, with relatively stronger affinity than that of Src(33.Cobb B.S. Schaller M.D. Leu T.-H. Parsons J.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 147-155Crossref PubMed Scopus (482) Google Scholar). Thus, it would be interesting to examine whether other Src-family kinases such as Fyn whose activities could be negatively regulated by Csk, are also activated in a similar way in CT10-transformed cells. Our study described here also suggests that at least one of the protein-tyrosine kinases involved in the increased phosphorylation of paxillin in CT10-transformed CEF is c-Src. Paxillin is highly phosphorylated in v-Src transformed cells(31.Glenney J.R. Zokas L. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 108: 2401-2408Crossref PubMed Scopus (354) Google Scholar). We showed that the same phosphotyrosine-peptide can block the binding of v-Crk to paxillin either from CT10-transformed CEF or from v-Src-transformed CEF. Furthermore, the same peptide blocks v-Crk binding to paxillin phosphorylated by c-Src in vitro, whereas it exhibits a partial blockage in v-Crk binding to Csk-phosphorylated paxillin. Consistent with our model, it is worthy to note a recent demonstration that depletion of c-Src kinase in csk-negative cells caused lowered tyrosine phosphorylation of paxillin(37.Thomas S.M. Soriano P. Imamoto A. Nature. 1995; 376: 267-271Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar). In addition to paxillin, other proteins whose tyrosine phosphorylation is increased in v-Src transformed CEF, such as pp125PAK and 110- and 130-kDa proteins, are also highly tyrosine-phosphorylated in CT10-transformed CEF(1.Mayer B.J. Hamaguchi M. Hanafusa H. Nature. 1988; 33: 272-275Crossref Scopus (516) Google Scholar, 3.Kanner S.B. Reynolds A.B. Vines R.R. Parsons J.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 3328-3332Crossref PubMed Scopus (396) Google Scholar). Consistent with the partial activation of the c-Src kinase, the level of overall kinase activities in CT10-transformed cells seems to be much lower than that of the v-Src kinase in v-Src-transformed cells, where an amount of v-Src protein comparable with that of endogenous c-Src is expressed(5.Mayer B.J. Hanafusa H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 2638-2642Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). ( (3)H. Sabe and H. Hanafusa, unpublished data.) In addition to the activation of the kinase activity of a small fraction of c-Src, the binding of v-Crk to tyrosine-phosphorylated forms of paxillin, pp125PAK and 110- and 130-kDa proteins with high affinity, would protect them from cellular tyrosine phosphatase activities (8.Birge R.B. Fajardo J.E. Mayer B.J. Hanafusa H. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 10588-10595Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 9.Birge R.B. Fajardo J.E. Reichman C. Shoelson S.E. Songyang Z. Cantley L.C. Hanafusa H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 4648-4656Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar) and thereby contribute to the steady state accumulation of tyrosine phosphorylation in these proteins in CT10-transformed CEF. Recently, several proteins including c-Abl protein-tyrosine kinase(38.Feller S.M. Knudsen B. Hanafusa H. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 2341-2351Crossref PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar, 39.Ren R. Ye Z.-S. Baltimore D. Genes & Dev. 1994; 8: 783-795Crossref PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar), and C3G with a guanine nucleotide-releasing property(40.Tanaka S. Morishita T. Hashimoto Y. Hattori S. Nakamura S. Shibuya M. Matuoka K. Takenawa T. Kurata T. Nagashima K. Matsuda M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 3443-3447Crossref PubMed Scopus (357) Google Scholar), have been shown to bind to the SH3 domain of Crk. How much of these Crk-binding proteins contribute to the protein-tyrosine phosphorylation as well as cell transformation in CT10-transformed cells remains to be studied. Although pp125PAK did not co-precipitate with endogenous v-Crk (Fig. 2), it was recovered in a protein complex bound to GST-v-Crk (Fig. 6A). This difference is probably due to the higher concentration of GST-v-Crk than endogenous v-Crk used in our experiments. However, since paxillin itself can associate with pp125PAK(41.Hildebrand J.D. Schaller M.D. Parsons J.T. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1995; 6: 637-647Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar), our analysis cannot distinguish whether v-Crk directly binds to pp125PAK. The cell-to-substratum adherence seems to be greatly altered in CT10-transformed CEF; cells become fusiform in morphology and acquire an ability to grow in soft agar(1.Mayer B.J. Hamaguchi M. Hanafusa H. Nature. 1988; 33: 272-275Crossref Scopus (516) Google Scholar). It is interesting to note that several types of v-Src mutants whose kinase activities are weaker than that of wild-type v-Src cause transformation with a fusiform morphology rather than a rounded-up one as caused by wild-type v-Src(42.Cross F.R. Garber E.A. Pellman D. Hanafusa H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1984; 4: 1834-1842Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar, 43.Jove R. Mayer B.J. Iba H. Laugier D. Poirier F. Calothy G. Hanafusa T.

The v-Crk-induced activation of c-Src kinase activity at focal adhesion plaques may contribute to the loss of the tight adherence of cells to the extracellular matrix and vice versa, as we have discussed previously(19.Sabe H. Hata A. Okada M. Nakagawa H. Hanafusa H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 3984-3988Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). The binding of v-Crk to paxillin may affect a function of paxillin other than its function as a mediator for the interaction between the Csk and Src kinases. v-Crk binding to paxillin may also block the phosphorylation of paxillin by Csk, which takes place at an early stage of cell to substratum adhesion,2 thus affecting the normal function of the focal adhesion plaques.

Alanine-scanning mutagenesis was used to examine the roles of residues surrounding serine 293 in catalysis by the dehydrogenase and in substrate recognition by branched-chain α-ketoacid dehydrogenase kinase. Alanine substitution of serine 293 resulted in a 10-fold increased Km for α-ketoisovalerate, a less increased (2.8-fold) Kmfor α-ketoisocaproate, but no change in Vmax or the Km for thiamine pyrophosphate. Alanine substitutions of arginine 288, histidine 292, and aspartate 296, residues highly conserved among α-ketoacid dehydrogenases, resulted in inactive enzymes. Each of the inactive E1 mutants bound to the E2 core subunit with equal affinity as wild-type E1, and each produced circular dichroism spectra identical to that of wild-type E1. Two mutations, H292A and S293E, abolished the ability of E1 apoenzyme to reconstitute with thiamine pyrophosphate. Each alanine-substituted E1 was phosphorylated at site 1 by branched-chain α-ketoacid dehydrogenase kinase with similar rates, with the exception of the R288A mutant, which displayed no detectable phosphorylation. Thiamine pyrophosphate inhibited the phosphorylation of all mutant enzymes with the exception of H292A, the mutant E1 that did not bind thiamine pyrophosphate.

Alanine substitutions of arginine 288, histidine 292, and aspartate 296, residues highly conserved among α-ketoacid dehydrogenases, resulted in inactive enzymes. Each of the inactive E1 mutants bound to the E2 core subunit with equal affinity as wild-type E1, and each produced circular dichroism spectra identical to that of wild-type E1. Two mutations, H292A and S293E, abolished the ability of E1 apoenzyme to reconstitute with thiamine pyrophosphate. Each alanine-substituted E1 was phosphorylated at site 1 by branched-chain α-ketoacid dehydrogenase kinase with similar rates, with the exception of the R288A mutant, which displayed no detectable phosphorylation. Thiamine pyrophosphate inhibited the phosphorylation of all mutant enzymes with the exception of H292A, the mutant E1 that did not bind thiamine pyrophosphate. INTRODUCTIONThe activity state of mammalian branched-chain α-ketoacid dehydrogenase (BCKDH) ( (1)The abbreviations used are: BCKDHbranched-chain α-ketoacid dehydrogenasePDHpyruvate dehydrogenasePAGEpolyacrylamide gel electrophoresisNTAnitrilotriacetic acid.) is highly regulated according to the physiological requirements for either degradation or conservation of branched-chain amino acids derived from cellular and dietary protein(1.Harper A.E. Miller R.H. Block K.P. Annu. Rev. Nutr. 1984; 4: 409-454Crossref PubMed Scopus (789) Google Scholar, 2.Harris R.A. Zhang B. Goodwin G.W. Kuntz M.J. Shimomura Y. Rougraff P. Dexter P. Zhao Y. Gibson R. Crabb D.W. Adv. Enzyme Regul. 1990; 30: 245-263Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). This regulation is primarily exerted through reversible phosphorylation of the E1α subunit by BCKDH kinase. BCKDH kinase phosphorylates two serine residues on the E1α subunit, although inactivation of the dehydrogenase results exclusively from the phosphorylation of site 1, serine 293 in rat E1α(3.Cook K.G. Lawson R. Yeaman S.J. FEBS Lett. 1983; 157: 587-591Crossref Scopus (17) Google Scholar, 4.Paxton R. Kuntz M.J. Harris R.A. Arch. Biochem.

Chem. 1994; 269: 18583-18587Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, phosphorylation of site 2 occurs at a significantly slower rate(3.Cook K.G. Lawson R. Yeaman S.J. FEBS Lett. 1983; 157: 587-591Crossref Scopus (17) Google Scholar, 4.Paxton R. Kuntz M.J. Harris R.A. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1986; 244: 187-201Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 5.Zhao Y.

Chem. 1994; 269: 18583-18587Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), suggesting that the site 2 serine, serine 303 in rat E1α, is a poor substrate either due to the primary or secondary structure surrounding this residue or the positioning of this serine residue relative to the kinase active site. BCKDH kinase is regulated in part through inhibition by branched-chain α-ketoacids and thiamine pyrophosphate, all of which are substrates for the BCKDH-catalyzed reaction(6.Paxton R. Harris R.A. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1984; 231: 48-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar, 7.Lau K.S. Fatania H.R. Randle P.J. FEBS Lett. 1982; 144: 57-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Inhibition of the kinase by branched-chain α-ketoacids is believed to occur in vivo, resulting in a fully active BCKDH in the liver of rats fed a high protein diet(2.Harris R.A. Zhang B. Goodwin G.W. Kuntz M.J. Shimomura Y. Rougraff P. Dexter P. Zhao Y. Gibson R. Crabb D.W. Adv. Enzyme Regul. 1990; 30: 245-263Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). However, the exact molecular basis for these inhibitory effects is not clearly understood. BCKDH kinase has also been reported to be activated by its interaction with the E2 subunit of the BCKDH complex, although the molecular basis for this mode of regulation is also not understood(8.Shimomura Y. Kuntz M.J. Suzuki M. Ozawa T. Harris R.A. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1988; 266: 210-218Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar, 9.Yeaman S.J. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1986; 11: 293-296Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Another important feature of BCKDH kinase is its high degree of substrate specificity, resulting in phosphorylation only of BCKDH E1α but not the highly homologous E1α subunit of pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH). The amino acid sequences surrounding the phosphorylation site 1 serine residues of BCKDH and PDH are approximately 50% conserved. Whether the specificity of BCKDH kinase or any part of its catalytic mechanism requires a specific part of this sequence is currently not known. The recent development of a dicistronic expression system for recombinant E1 subunit of BCKDH (5.Zhao Y. Hawes J.W. Popov K.P. Jaskiewicz J. Shimomura Y. Crabb D.W. Harris R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 18583-18587Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 10.Wynn R.M. Davie J.R. Cox R.P. Chuang D.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 12400-12403Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) provides a means for the analysis of the interaction of BCKDH kinase with reconstituted BCKDH complex containing specific mutant forms of E1. The present study utilizes alanine-scanning mutagenesis to examine the roles of amino acid residues surrounding serine 293 of rat BCKDH E1α in dehydrogenase activity and in phosphorylation site recognition by BCKDH kinase. Site-directed mutagenesis of protein kinase substrates has been successfully used in several studies of phosphorylation site recognition by cytosolic serine/threonine protein kinases and tyrosine protein kinases(11.Pearson R.B. Kemp B.E. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 200: 62-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (866) Google Scholar). The majority of these kinases have been found to require in their substrates the presence of specific amino acid functional groups such as acidic, basic, or hydrophobic residues at defined locations either N-terminal or C-terminal to the phosphorylation site serine. Our data indicate that BCKDH kinase has a strict requirement for the arginine residue present at the position −5 relative to serine 293 of E1α.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterialsThe pET28a expression vector and the HMS174(DE3) Escherichia coli cell line were from Novagen, Inc. (Madison, WI). Ni2+-NTA resin was from Qiagen Inc. (Chatsworth, CA). All restriction enzymes were from Life Technologies, Inc. The site-directed mutagenesis kit was from Amersham Corp. The DNA sequencing kit was from United States Biochemical Corp. The pBluescript II SK- plasmid, VCSM13 helper phage, and the TG1 E. coli cell line were from Stratagene Cloning Systems (La Jolla, CA). [γ-32P]ATP was from DuPont NEN. All other chemicals were from Sigma. BCKDH E2 was purified from rat liver according to previously published methods(12.Shimomura Y. Nanaumi N. Suzuki M. Popov K.M. Harris R.A. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1990; 283: 293-299Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar).PlasmidsThe pGroESL plasmid was kindly supplied by Dr. Anthony Gatenby (Central Research and Development, DuPont). The construction of the dicistronic expression vector for production of recombinant rat BCKDH E1 was exactly as previously reported (5.Zhao Y. Hawes J.W. Popov K.P. Jaskiewicz J. Shimomura Y. Crabb D.W. Harris R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 18583-18587Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A “His-tagged” vector for prokaryotic expression of rat BCKDH kinase was constructed as follows. The original rat BCKDH kinase cDNA was ligated to the EcoRI sites of pBluescript II SK-. Single-stranded DNA was produced by helper phage rescue procedures according to the manufacturer's protocol (Stratagene). In order to remove the DNA coding for the mitochondrial leader sequence, site-directed mutagenesis was utilized to add an SstI restriction site just prior to the first codon of the mature protein reading frame. Mutant plasmids were analyzed by restriction analysis, and the cDNA containing the mature protein reading frame was isolated by treatment with SstI and NotI. This 2-kilobase pair cDNA fragment was ligated to the SstI and NotI sites of pET28a (Novagen). The reading frame of this construct was verified by double-stranded DNA sequencing.Site-directed MutagenesisSingle-stranded S303A pET-E1 was produced by VCSM13 helper phage rescue according to the manufacturer's protocol (Stratagene). Each alanine substitution was produced using single-stranded cDNA containing the S303A mutation (5.Zhao Y. Hawes J.W. Popov K.P. Jaskiewicz J. Shimomura Y. Crabb D.W. Harris R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 18583-18587Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) in order to limit subsequent phosphorylation to serine 293 only. Synthetic oligonucleotides were designed to direct the synthesis of the desired mutations and were synthesized by the Biochemistry Biotechnology Facility of Indiana University School of Medicine. Site-directed mutagenesis was performed using the Sculptor system according to the manufacturer's protocol (Amersham Corp.). Each mutant pET-E1 plasmid was analyzed by polymerase chain reaction amplifications specific for rat E1α and rat E1β to insure the integrity of the dicistronic plasmids, and by single-stranded DNA sequencing.Recombinant Enzyme PurificationRecombinant E1 was expressed and purified exactly as described previously(5.Zhao Y. Hawes J.W. Popov K.P. Jaskiewicz J. Shimomura Y. Crabb D.W. Harris R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 18583-18587Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Recombinant BCKDH kinase was expressed and purified as follows.HMS174 (DE3) E. coli cells were double-transfected with the pET-BK plasmid (kanamycin-resistant) and the pGroESL plasmid (chloramphenicol-resistant). Double transfectants were selected by growth at 37°C in TY media containing 70 μg/ml of both kanamycin and chloramphenicol. When the cell cultures obtained an optical density of 0.8, isopropyl-1-thio-β-D-galactopyranoside was added to a final concentration of 0.5 mM, and growth of the cultures was continued for 18-20 h at 37°C. The induced bacterial cultures were pelleted, then resuspended in 10 volumes of buffer A (20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 0.5 M NaCl, 10 mM 2-mercaptoethanol, 5 mM imidazole) containing 0.5% Triton X-100, and 100 μg/ml benzamidine and phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride. The cells were lysed by sonication with a Sonifier Cell Disruptor W185 (Branson Sonic Power Co., Plainview, NY). The resulting homogenates were centrifuged at 20,000 × g for 30 min at 4°C, and the supernatants carefully removed. The supernatants were applied to 10 ml of Ni2+-NTA-agarose (Qiagen Inc.) previously equilibrated in buffer A. Following sample loading the columns were washed successively with three volumes of buffer A containing 20 mM imidazole, 40 mM imidazole, and 60 mM imidazole, followed by elution of the kinase with buffer A containing 200 mM imidazole. The BCKDH kinase expressed and purified by this procedure appeared to be phosphorylated as isolated from E. coli and was dephosphorylated by treatment with broad-specificity protein phosphatase isolated from bovine heart(6.Paxton R. Harris R.A. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1984; 231: 48-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). The phosphatase-treated BCKDH kinase was repurified by precipitation with ammonium sulfate (75% saturation) followed by Ni2+-NTA agarose chromatography as described above.Enzyme AssaysBCKDH activity was determined spectrophotometrically using reconstituted BCKDH complex as described previously(5.Zhao Y. Hawes J.W. Popov K.P. Jaskiewicz J. Shimomura Y. Crabb D.W. Harris R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 18583-18587Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Concentrations of α-ketoacid solutions used were determined by enzymatic end point assay using purified BCKDH complex (13.Goodwin G.W. Kuntz M.J. Paxton R. Harris R.A. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 536-539Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Concentrations of thiamine pyrophosphate solutions used were determined by absorbance using E267 of 8520 M-1 cm-1. Stoichiometry of phosphorylation was determined by SDS-PAGE as described previously(5.Zhao Y. Hawes J.W. Popov K.P. Jaskiewicz J. Shimomura Y. Crabb D.W. Harris R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 18583-18587Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Rates of kinase-mediated incorporation of [32P]phosphate into BCKDH were determined as described by Paxton(14.Paxton R. Methods Enzymol. 1988; 166: 313-320Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar), using 0.75 μg of E2, 0.05 μg of BCKDH kinase, and the indicated amounts of E1. S303A mutant E1 was used as control for all phosphorylation experiments, and wild-type E1 was used as control for dehydrogenase activity. Kinetic parameters were determined using the computer program of Cleland(15.Cleland W.W. Methods Enzymol. 1979; 63: 103-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (1925) Google Scholar), fitting the data to the equation V = (Vmax× A)/(Km+ A), where A is the substrate concentration. Values for kcat were calculated with a molecular weight for BCKDH E1 of 160,000.Measurement of Enzyme-bound Thiamine PyrophosphateFor reconstitution of holoenzyme, 2 mg of purified E1 was incubated at 30°C for 15 min in the presence of 200 μM thiamine pyrophosphate and 200 μM MgCl2. E1 was then separated from free cofactor by Sephadex gel filtration. The amount of thiamine pyrophosphate bound to each of the E1 enzymes was determined by fluorometric analysis of the product formed by reaction with KFe(CN)6(16.Diefenbach R.J. Duggleby R.G. Biochem. J. 1991; 276: 439-445Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar).Circular Dichroism SpectrapolarimetryCircular dichroism spectra were recorded at 21°C with a Jasco J-720 spectrapolarimeter. Enzyme concentrations were in the range of 100-300 μg/ml with a cell path length of 0.1 cm and a wavelength range of 300-190 nm. Each spectrum was averaged from three consecutive recordings. Secondary structure contents were estimated using the reference spectra of Yang et al. (17.Yang J.T. Wu C.S.C. Martinez H.M. Methods Enzymol. 1986; 130: 208-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (1730) Google Scholar) and the SSE-338 program (Japan Spectroscopic Co., Tokyo, Japan).RESULTSBCKDH Activity and Thiamine Pyrophosphate Binding Capacity of Mutant BCKDH E1sTo examine the relative importance of residues surrounding phosphorylation site 1 of BCKDH E1α, each residue spanning from Arg-288 to Ser-298 was mutated to alanine. Each of these alanine mutations was produced with Ser-303 also mutated to alanine in order to limit subsequent phosphorylation to serine 293 only. The S303A mutant E1 was previously shown to be enzymatically active and kinetically indistinguishable from wild-type E1(5.Zhao Y. Hawes J.W. Popov K.P. Jaskiewicz J. Shimomura Y. Crabb D.W. Harris R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 18583-18587Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The double mutant S293A/S303A, containing both site 1 and site 2 as alanine substitutions, was catalytically active with no change in maximal velocity or the Km for thiamine pyrophosphate but displayed a 10-fold increased Km for α-ketoisovalerate, resulting in a 10-fold decrease in catalytic efficiency as judged by kcat/Km (Table 1). This finding is in agreement with the previously reported single mutant, S293A(5.Zhao Y. Hawes J.W. Popov K.P. Jaskiewicz J. Shimomura Y. Crabb D.W. Harris R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 18583-18587Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The activity with this mutant was also analyzed with α-ketoisocaproate as the ketoacid substrate. Interestingly, the alanine substitution at position 293 produced only a 2.8-fold increase in the Km for this α-ketoacid (68 ± 15 μM for wild-type and 190 ± 25 μM for S293A). As with α-ketoisovalerate, the Vmax and kcat values were not changed by the S293A mutation when α-ketoisocaproate was used as substrate (4.8 units/mg protein and 12.8 s-1, respectively, for wild-type; 5.0 units/mg protein and 13.2 s-1, respectively, for S293A). Thus the kcat/Km values with α-ketoisocaproate as substrate were 0.188 and 0.067, respectively, for wild-type and S303A, indicating a 2.8-fold decrease in the catalytic efficiency with this substrate.Tabled 1 Open table in a new tab Further alanine substitutions were produced for each residue located at positions −5 to +5 relative to Ser-293. Of these mutations, seven produced enzymes that were similar to wild-type in their catalytic properties (Table 1). However, three specific alanine substitutions, R288A, H292A, and D296A, produced enzymes that were completely inactive under all conditions tested (Table 1). All of these mutant E1 forms were expressed and purified with an equal ratio of E1α and E1β subunits, suggesting proper formation of the E1 complex in spite of mutations in the E1α component.Measurements of the amount of thiamine pyrophosphate showed that each of the E1 mutants, as well as wild-type enzyme, were initially produced as apoenzymes containing no measurable cofactor. Whether these enzymes are expressed in E. coli as apoenzymes or our purification procedure, consisting of Ni2+-chelation chromatography and polyethylene glycol precipitation, results in the production of apoenzyme is not known. Nevertheless, it was found that the control recombinant E1 as well as the R288A and D296A mutant enzymes were readily reconstituted with thiamine pyrophosphate. Thus, incubation of E1 (2 mg) with 200 μM thiamine pyrophosphate and MgCl2 followed by removal of unbound cofactor by gel filtration chromatography resulted in stoichiometries of 1.7, 1.8, and 1.7 nmol of thiamine pyrophosphate/nmol of E1 for control, R288A, and D296A, respectively. Two mutations that are contiguous in sequence, H292A and S293E, produced enzymes which were unable to reconstitute with thiamine pyrophosphate, remaining as apoenzymes after incubation with cofactor and MgCl2 (≤0.05 nmol of cofactor/nmol of E1). This result suggests that these mutations specifically affect thiamine pyrophosphate binding, thereby explaining their lack of enzymatic activity. Previously, the S293E mutant E1 was reported to be enzymatically inactive but reconstituted normally with E2(5.Zhao Y. Hawes J.W. Popov K.P. Jaskiewicz J. Shimomura Y. Crabb D.W. Harris R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 18583-18587Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), but this mutant had not been analyzed with respect to binding of thiamine pyrophosphate.Phosphorylation of Alanine-substituted BCKDH E1s by BCKDH KinaseMost protein kinases studied to date require the presence of specific amino acid functional groups, such as hydrophobic or charged side chains, at specific locations either N-terminal or C-terminal to the site of phosphorylation(11.Pearson R.B. Kemp B.E. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 200: 62-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (866) Google Scholar). To analyze the possible roles of any amino acid side-chain surrounding Serine 293 in phosphorylation site recognition by BCKDH kinase, each mutant E1 produced for this study was tested as substrate for phosphorylation of serine 293 by recombinant BCKDH kinase. As shown in Table 2, all alanine substitutions in the range of positions −4 to +5 resulted in E1 mutants, which were phosphorylated with equal efficiency as compared to S303A as control, with no significant change in either Vmax or Km values. Since aspartate residues are present at both positions +3 and +4 relative to serine 293, a triple mutant (D296A/D297A/S303A) was also produced to remove all acidic residues from this region. This mutant was also phosphorylated with equal efficiency as the single aspartate mutants (data not shown), indicating that no acidic residues C-terminal to Ser-293 are required for the interaction of E1 with BCKDH kinase. In contrast, one alanine substitution, R288A/S303A, completely abolished phosphorylation of E1 by BCKDH kinase, even when the mutant E1 was present at relatively high concentrations (Table 2). Thus, arginine 288 appears to be critical to the interaction of BCKDH kinase with the phosphorylation site 1 of BCKDH. The lack of phosphorylation of the R288A mutant E1 was confirmed when analyzed by SDS-PAGE (Fig. 1). Each of the mutant E1s with alanine substitutions in the range of −4 to +5 relative to Ser-293 were found to be phosphorylated to the same extent, with stoichiometries between 0.9 and 1.1 nmol of phosphate incorporated/nmol of E1α (Fig. 1). That no other serine residues other than Ser-293 were phosphorylated is indicated by the stoichiometry as well as by the absence of phosphorylation in the S293A/S303A mutant E1.Tabled 1 Open table in a new tab Inhibition of BCKDH kinase by the thiamine pyrophosphate cofactor of E1 was analyzed using several mutant E1s as substrates. The phosphorylation of S303A and D296A/S303A mutant E1s was dramatically inhibited with an IC50 of approximately 1.0 μM, and 90% inhibition at 12 μM (Fig. 2). Phosphorylation of H292A mutant E1 was not affected by thiamine pyrophosphate in this concentration range, consistent with the lack of cofactor binding by this mutant.Figure 2:Inhibition of BCKDH kinase by thiamine pyrophosphate. BCKDH kinase activity was measured as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Each value is the average of three determinations. □, control; •, H292A; Δ, D296A.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)E2 BindingBinding of mutant E1 to the E2 core subunit of BCKDH was analyzed by inhibition of reconstitution of BCKDH activity with wild-type E1 and native E2. In these experiments E1 was used in excess relative to E2 to insure that E2 was rate-limiting for reconstituted BCKDH activity and that all E1 binding sites on E2 were saturated with E1(18.Cook K.G. Bradford A.P. Yeaman S.J. Biochem. J. 1985; 225: 731-735Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Therefore, if every E1 binding site present on the E2 subunit is bound by E1, then binding of inactive mutant E1 will result in inhibition of the reconstituted BCKDH activity dependent on the relative amounts and affinities of the mutant and wild-type E1 present. This experimental approach has been used previously to analyze the E2 binding capacity of inactive mutant E1s(5.Zhao Y. Hawes J.W. Popov K.P. Jaskiewicz J. Shimomura Y. Crabb D.W. Harris R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 18583-18587Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 18.Cook K.G. Bradford A.P. Yeaman S.J. Biochem. J. 1985; 225: 731-735Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). That E2 was rate-limiting is shown in Fig. 3 with reactions containing various concentrations of wild-type E1 without added mutant E1. Each of the inactive mutant E1s, R288A, H292A, and D296A, inhibited the reconstitution of wild-type recombinant E1 with purified, native E2 (Fig. 3). Approximately 50% inhibition was observed for each mutant with an equal molar ratio of mutant to wild-type E1, suggesting equal affinity for the E1 binding site on E2.Figure 3:BCKDH activity of reconstituted complex with different ratios of mutant to wild-type E1. BCKDH activity was measured as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Each value is the average of three determinations. A constant amount of purified, native E2 (0.75 μg) was used. ▪, amount of wild-type E1 varied as indicated, with no mutant E1 added. ○, amount of total E1 kept constant (8 μg) by varying wild-type and R288A mutant E1; •, by varying wild-type and H292A mutant E1; □, by varying wild-type and D296A mutant E1.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Circular Dichroism SpectrapolarimetryEach of the inactive mutant E1s, R288A, H292A, and D296A, produced circular dichroism spectra identical to that of the control E1, suggesting that no dramatic changes in secondary structure occurred as a specific result of these three mutations. Estimation of secondary structure contents by comparison to a library of peptides with defined structures (17.Yang J.T. Wu C.S.C. Martinez H.M. Methods Enzymol. 1986; 130: 208-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (1730) Google Scholar) revealed a high degree of secondary structure. By this method, each of the E1 forms analyzed was predicted to contain 39%α-helix, 42%β-sheet, and 19% other structures.DISCUSSIONLittle is known about the mechanism responsible for inactivation of BCKDH by phosphorylation. It is known that phosphorylation of site 2, serine 303 in rat E1α, is silent with respect to regulation of BCKDH activity(3.Cook K.G. Lawson R. Yeaman S.J. FEBS Lett. 1983; 157: 587-591Crossref Scopus (17) Google Scholar, 4.Paxton R. Kuntz M.J. Harris R.A. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1986; 244: 187-201Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 5.Zhao Y. Hawes J.W. Popov K.P. Jaskiewicz J. Shimomura Y. Crabb D.W. Harris R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 18583-18587Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, mutations of serine 293, the phosphorylation site 1, result in kinetically altered enzymes (5.Zhao Y. Hawes J.W. Popov K.P. Jaskiewicz J. Shimomura Y. Crabb D.W. Harris R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 18583-18587Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Mutation of serine 293 to glutamate results in complete loss of enzymatic activity(5.Zhao Y. Hawes J.W. Popov K.P. Jaskiewicz J. Shimomura Y. Crabb D.W. Harris R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 18583-18587Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), suggesting that the presence of the negative charge of glutamate or phosphate are responsible for the loss of activity. The present study provides further evidence that the region of phosphorylation site 1 of BCKDH may be part of the dehydrogenase active site by showing that specific mutations in this region result in kinetically altered E1 enzymes. Interestingly, the alanine substitution of serine 293 resulted in different kinetic effects with two different α-ketoacid substrates. This result indicates that this residue does not have a crucial catalytic role and suggests that it may be positioned in a site important for α-ketoacid substrate binding. That two different α-ketoacids with only a slight difference in the branched-chain structure should display such different kinetic changes with this mutant suggests that this residue may provide a site of interaction with the branched-chain portion of the substrate. Completely inactive mutants included R288A, H292A, and D296A. Examination of the amino acid sequences of other α-ketoacid dehydrogenases, including pyruvate dehydrogenases and α-ketoglutarate dehydrogenases from a wide variety of species, revealed that these three residues are very highly conserved, forming a distinct domain common to all of these enzymes (Fig. 4). Only the pyruvate dehydrogenase of E. coli lacks these conserved residues. This level of sequence identity suggests that these residues might have critically important functions common to the structures or mechanisms of α-ketoacid dehydrogenases in general. Little data are presently available concerning active site residues of BCKDH, with most work to date focused on the active site of the highly homologous enzyme, PDH. Chemical modification and circular dichroism studies have suggested the presence of unidentified arginine, histidine, and lysine residues in the vicinity of the active site of PDH(19.Khailova L.S.

https://openalex.org/W1495056054,"Analogs of d-tubocurarine were used to determine the individual effects of methylation, stereoisomerization, and halogenation of d-tubocurarine on the affinity for each of the two acetylcholine (ACh) binding sites of the Torpedo nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (AChR) and for the noncompetitive antagonist site. Eight analogs were synthesized, including three new compounds: 7′-O-methylchondocurarine, 12′-O-methylchondocurarine, and 13′-bromo-d-tubocurarine. The two ACh sites differ in their affinities for d-tubocurarine by 400-fold, as shown by inhibition of [3H]ACh binding, whereas the affinity ratio for metocurine, the trimethylated derivative of d-tubocurarine, is reduced to 30 due to a decreased affinity for the high affinity site. Binding analysis of five d-tubocurarine analogs demonstrates that methylation of the phenols alone is responsible for the observed changes in affinity. Substitution with bromine or iodine at the 13′-position affected affinity at both sites with a net increase in site selectivity. Stereoisomers of d-tubocurare had decreased affinity for only the high affinity ACh site. Thus, the ring systems, including the 12′- and 13′-positions and the 1-position stereocenter, appear to be important in discriminating between the two ACh binding sites. Desensitization of the AChR was measured by increased affinity for [3H]phencyclidine. Binding to only the single, high affinity acetylcholine binding site, comprised by the αγ-subunits, was required for partial desensitization of the AChR by d-tubocurarine and its analogs. Stronger desensitization, to the same extent observed in the presence of the agonist carbamylcholine, occurred upon binding by iodonated or brominated d-tubocurarine. Interaction of the analogs at the noncompetitive antagonist site of the AChR was also measured by [3H]phencyclidine binding. The bis-tertiary ammonium analogs of either the d- or l-stereoisomers bound to the noncompetitive antagonist binding site of the AChR with 100-fold higher affinity than the corresponding quaternary ammonium analogs.

Several NF-κB activators induce the proteolysis of IκB proteins, which results in the nuclear translocation and DNA binding of NF-κB complexes. Here, we report a novel mechanism of NF-κB regulation mediated by p105 (NF-κB1) precursor of p50 directly at the nuclear level. In Epstein-Barr virus-immortalized B cells, p105 was found in the nucleus, where it was complexed with p65.

Differently, phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate induced a significant proteolysis of both IκBα and p105 in the cytoplasm, while it did not affect the protein level of p105 in the nucleus.

These events result in the unmasking of the nuclear localization signal of Rel proteins and the nuclear translocation and DNA binding of NF-κB complexes. In the present study, we have examined the mechanisms of NF-κB activation by two different NF-κB inducers. For this purpose, MC3 cells, an Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)( (1)The abbreviations used are: EBVEpstein-Barr virusPMAphorbol 12-myristate 13-acetatePBSphosphate-buffered salinePMSFphenylmethylsulfonyl fluorideAPMSF4-amidinophenyl-methanesulfonylfluorideHIV-1human immunodeficiency virus, type 1.) -immortalized B cell line, were exposed to treatment with mitomycin C, a DNA alkylating agents (21.Quinto I. Ruocco M.R. Baldassarre F. Mallardo M. Dragonetti E. Scala G. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 26719-26724Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and PMA, a protein kinase C-activator(22.Nishizuka Y. Nature. 1988; 334: 661-665Crossref PubMed Scopus (3521) Google Scholar). Then, the fate of Rel proteins and IκBα inhibitor was analyzed at different times of treatment by immunoblotting analysis of cytosolic and nuclear extracts. Our data indicate that in MC3 cells p105 can be found in the cytoplasm as well as in the nucleus. In concomitance with NF-κB activation, mitomycin C induced the processing of p105 to p50 in the nucleus, while it did not significantly affect the steady-state protein level of IκBα and p105 in the cytoplasm. Concomitantly with NF-κB activation, the nuclear content of p65 and c-Rel was unmodified by the mitomycin C treatment. Differently, PMA caused a significant degradation of IκBα and the processing of p105 in the cytoplasm, while it did not affect the p105 protein level in the nucleus. Concomitantly with the PMA-mediated activation of NF-κB, both p65 and c-Rel proteins increased in the nucleus. Nuclear p105 was confirmed to occur exclusively in EBV-positive cell lines either by immunoblotting analysis of cell fractions or by cell immunostaining of different cell lines. Moreover, by immunoprecipitation, p105 was shown to be associated with p65, but not c-Rel, in the nucleus. Epstein-Barr virus phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate phosphate-buffered saline phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride 4-amidinophenyl-methanesulfonylfluoride human immunodeficiency virus, type 1. These findings indicate that in EBV-positive B cell lines p105 can down-regulate the NF-κB activity directly in the nucleus by associating with p65. Nuclear processing of p105 may be an additional mechanism of NF-κB activation in response to specific signals, such as DNA damage. MC3 cells, an EBV-positive B lymphocytes cell line(21.Quinto I. Ruocco M.R. Baldassarre F. Mallardo M. Dragonetti E. Scala G. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 26719-26724Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% v/v heat-inactivated fetal calf serum (Flow Laboratories, Italy), 3 mM glutamine and 10 mM Hepes buffer, pH 7.2 (Life Technologies, Inc., Italy). Exponential phase cultures were treated with mitomycin C (10 μM) or PMA (100 ng/ml) for the indicated time or left untreated. Cell viability was determined by trypan blue exclusion. Nuclear and cytosolic extracts were prepared as described previously(21.Quinto I. Ruocco M.R. Baldassarre F. Mallardo M. Dragonetti E. Scala G. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 26719-26724Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, cells (2 × 107) were harvested, washed twice in cold PBS, and resuspended in 200 μl of lysing buffer (10 mM Hepes buffer, pH 7.9, 1 mM EDTA, 60 mM KCl, 1 mM dithiothreitol, 1 mM PMSF, 50 μg/ml antipain, 40 μg/ml APMSF, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 40 μg/ml bestatin, 20 μg/ml chymostatin, 0.2% v/v Nonidet P-40) for 5 min. Samples were centrifuged at 400 × g for 5 min. The supernatant (cytosolic fraction) was stored at −80°C until use. The pelletted nuclei were gently rinsed twice with 1 ml of Nonidet P-40-free lysing buffer, resuspended in 300 μl of Nonidet P-40-free lysing buffer, and layered on top of 300 μl of same buffer containing 30% saccharose. After centrifugation at 2900 × g for 10 min, the supernatant was gently removed and the pelletted nuclei were resuspended in 200 μl of nuclear suspension buffer (250 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.8, 60 mM KCl, 1 mM dithiothreitol, 1 mM PMSF, 50 μg/ml antipain, 40 μg/ml APMSF, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 40 μg/ml bestatin, 20 μg/ml chymostatin). A small aliquot of nuclei preparation was stained with trypan blue and observed at the microscope to verify the integrity of nuclei. Then, the nuclei suspension was subjected to three cycles of freezing and thawing. The suspension was cleared by ultracentrifugation at 135,000 × g for 15 min, and the supernatant was stored at −80°C until use. The DNA band-shift analysis was performed as described previously(21.Quinto I. Ruocco M.R. Baldassarre F. Mallardo M. Dragonetti E. Scala G. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 26719-26724Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The HIV-1 NF-κB double-stranded oligonucleotide (5′-CAAGGGACTTTCCGCTGGGGACTTTCCAG-3') was end-labeled with [γ-32P]ATP (Amersham International, Amersham, UK) using polynucleotide kinase (New England Biolabs, Beverly, MA). Nuclear extracts (5 μg of protein) were incubated in a 20 μl of reaction mixture containing 10% glycerol, 60 mM potassium chloride, 1 mM EDTA, 1 mM dithiothreitol, and 2 μg of poly(dI-dC) (Boehringer Mannheim, Germany) for 5 min on ice. One μl of γ-32P-labeled double-stranded probe (0.2 ng, 4-6 × 104 cpm) was then added with or without a 100-fold molar excess of unlabeled oligonucleotide. The reactions were incubated at room temperature for 30 min and run on a 6% acrylamide/bis-acrylamide (30:1) gel in 22.5 mM Tris borate, 0.5 mM EDTA. Gels were dried and autoradiographed. Immunoblotting analysis was performed as described previously(23.Scala G. Quinto I. Ruocco M.R. Mallardo M. Ambrosino C. Squitieri B. Tassone P. Venuta S. J. Virol. 1993; 67: 2853-2861Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, nuclear or cytosolic proteins (5-40 μg) were separated by SDS-10% polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, transferred onto a membrane filter (Cellulosenitrate, Schleider & Schuell, Germany), and incubated with the primary antiserum in PBS plus 5% dry milk for 2 h at room temperature. The blots were washed with PBS, incubated with peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit or anti-mouse IgG (Boehringer Mannheim) at 1:2000 for 1 h and visualized by using the enhanced chemiluminescence system (Amersham). The specificity of detection was verified by the absence of immunostaining in presence of competitor peptide (10 μg/ml) or in presence of the second antibody alone. The polyclonal rabbit antisera anti-p105 1140 (amino acids 955-969 of human p105) and 1141 (amino acids 2-15 of human p105), anti-p65 1226 (amino acids 537-550 of human p65) and 1207 (amino acids 2-17 of human p65), anti-c-Rel 265 (amino acids 573-587 of human c-Rel), and anti-IκBα 1309 (amino acids 51-64 of human IκBα) were kindly provided by Dr. N. Rice (24.Rice N.R. MacKichan M.L. Israël A. Cell. 1992; 71: 243-253Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar). The monoclonal mouse antibody anti-human B cell CD20 was from Dako Corp., Carpinteria, CA. Densitometric evaluation of the protein content was performed by using an LKB 2202 ultrascan laser densitometer (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.) assisted by a Hewlett-Packard 3390A Integrator. Nuclear extracts from unstimulated MC3 (1 × 108 cells) were incubated overnight in 500 μl of radioimmune precipitation buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mM sodium chloride, 1% Nonidet P-40, 1% sodium deoxycholate, 0.2% SDS, and 4 μg/μl bovine serum albumin) with the anti-p65 antiserum 1207 (5 μl), the anti-c-Rel antiserum 265 (5 μl), or a preimmune antiserum (5 μl). Immunocomplexes were precipitated with protein A-Sepharose (Sigma) by centrifugation at 720 × g for 10 min. The precipitate was rinsed twice by resuspension in radioimmune precipitation buffer followed by centrifugation. Immunoprecipitates were analyzed by immunoblotting with anti-p105 antiserum 1140, anti-p65 antiserum 1207, and anti-c-Rel antiserum 265. Cytospins were air-dried, fixed in acetone for 1 min, rinsed in PBS, and incubated in PBS containing 5% dry milk for 30 min. Incubation with the anti-p105 antiserum 1140 was performed in PBS containing 5% dry milk for 30 min at room temperature. Immunocomplexes were revealed by peroxidase-labeled secondary antibody (Dako LSAB+ kit, peroxidase) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The competitor peptide was added to the incubation mixture at the final concentration of 10 μg/ml. Before analysis on the microscope, nuclei were counterstained blue with hematoxylin (Mayer). Immunostaining was evaluated by computer-assisted analysis using a Leica Quantimet 500C plus image analysis and processing system. In MC3 cells, the NF-κB activity was constitutively expressed, and it was increased by treatment with mitomycin C at 30 and 60 min (Fig. 1A). p105 and p50 were both detected in the nuclear extracts of unstimulated cells by immunoblotting analysis using an antiserum raised against the N terminus of p105 (Fig. 1B, lane 1). At 30 and 60 min of mitomycin C treatment, p105 significantly decreased, while p50 increased (Fig. 1B, lanes 2 and 3). By the same antiserum, a 75-kDa protein (referred to as p75) was sometimes detected (Fig. 1B, lanes 2 and 3), being a possible intermediate product of p105 proteolysis. The nuclear location and the time-dependent proteolysis of p105 was confirmed by an antiserum raised against the C terminus of p105 (Fig. 1C). p65 and c-Rel were abundantly detected by specific antisera in the nucleus of unstimulated cells, and their content did not significantly change after chemical treatment (Fig. 1, D and E). IκBα was undetected in the nuclear extracts, while it was clearly revealed in the cytosolic extracts of unstimulated cells (Fig. 1F). An intracellular epitope of B cell-associated CD20 antigen (25.Mason D.Y. Comans-Bitter W.M. Cordell J.L. Verhoeven M.-A.J. van Dongen J.J.M. Am. J. Pathol. 1990; 136: 1215-1222PubMed Google Scholar) was also exclusively detected in the cytosolic extracts, providing a further control of the absence of cytosolic contamination of nuclear preparations (Fig. 1G). In concomitance with the NF-κB activation by mitomycin C, the steady-state protein levels of p105 and IκBα in the cytoplasm were not significantly affected (Fig. 1, H and I). The proteolysis of p105 in the nucleus was observed at times of treatment with mitomycin C as soon as 2 min and up to 3 h (Fig. 2). Concomitantly, in the cytoplasm the p105 and IκBα content did not significantly change up to 60 min of mitomycin C treatment, showing a slight increase at 2 and 3 h (Fig. 2).Figure 2:Fate of p105 and IκBα following the treatment with mitomycin C. MC3 cells were treated with mitomycin C (10 μM) for the indicated time or left untreated. Nuclear and cytosolic extracts were performed and analyzed by immunoblotting analysis as detailed under “Materials and Methods.” p105 was detected in the nuclear (10 μg) and cytosolic extracts (10 μg) using the anti-p105 antiserum 1140. IκBα was detected in the cytosolic extract (30 μg) using the anti-IκBα antiserum 1309. The values of densitometric analysis relative to each protein through lanes 1-9 are: nuclear p105, 1.0, 0.6, 0.1, 0.6, 0.2, 0.3, 0.3, 0.1, 0.1; cytosolic p105, 1.0, 0.8, 1.3, 1.6, 1.6, 1.5, 1.5, 1.8, 2.5; and IκBα, 1.0, 0.8, 0.9, 1.3, 1.1, 1.0, 0.7, 1.9, 2.7. The values are expressed as the ratio between the treated samples (times 2 up to 180 min) and the relative untreated control (time 0).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) In the case of PMA, NF-κB activity was induced at 15 and up to 120 min of treatment with a maximum at 30 min (Fig. 3A). In concomitance with NF-κB activation by PMA, the processing of p105 did not occur in the nucleus (Fig. 3, B and C), and the nuclear content of p50 was unchanged (Fig. 3B). In the nucleus, p65 increased at 15 and up to 60 min of PMA treatment followed by a slight decrease at 120 min (Fig. 3D). Nuclear c-Rel also progressively increased at 15 and up to 120 min of PMA treatment (Fig. 3E). In the cytoplasm, a significant proteolysis was observed for p105 at 30 and up to 60 min of PMA treatment (Fig. 3F) and for IκBα at 15 and up to 60 min of PMA treatment (Fig. 3G). Following degradation, both p105 and IκBα increased in the cytosol at 120 min (Fig. 3, F and G, lane 6). This increase was not observed in the presence of cycloheximide (Fig. 3, F and G, lane 11), suggesting that both NF-κB inhibitors were resynthesized at 120 min of PMA treatment. To test whether p105 could be associated with Rel proteins in the nucleus, nuclear extracts from MC3 cells were immunoprecipitated with anti-p65 or anti-c-Rel antiserum, and the immunocomplexes were analyzed for the presence of p105. As shown in Fig. 4, p105 was co-precipitated with p65 (A, lane 2), but not with c-Rel (B, lane 2). However, in accordance with previous reports(20.Mercurio F. DiDonato J.A. Rosette C. Karin M. Genes & Dev. 1993; 7: 705-718Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar, 24.Rice N.R. MacKichan M.L. Israël A. Cell. 1992; 71: 243-253Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar), p105 was co-precipitated with p65 and c-Rel from cytosolic extracts of MC3 cells (Fig. 4, A and B, lane 8). These results indicate that in MC3 cells nuclear p105 was preferentially associated with p65. p105 was described as retained in the cytoplasm due to the C-terminal ankyrin repeats masking the nuclear localization signal of the protein(26.Blank V.

To investigate the nuclear distribution of p105 in different cell lines, nuclear and cytosolic extracts from EBV-positive B cells (MC3 and CB33), EBV-negative Burkitt lymphoma (De Few), T cells (Jurkat), and epithelial cells (Cos7) were analyzed by immunoblotting for the presence of p105. As shown in Fig. 5, p105 was present in the cytosolic extracts of all examined cell lines, but it was found in the nucleus only in EBV-positive B cell lines. These findings were confirmed by immunostaining of MC3 and Cos7 cells with an antiserum raised against the C terminus of p105. p105 was stained red, and it was clearly detected both in the cytoplasm and the nucleus of MC3 cells, being homogeneously diffused in the cytoplasm and patchy in the nucleus (Fig. 6A). Specificity of immunostaining was verified by the lack of p105 staining in the presence of the antagonist peptide (Fig. 6B). In Cos7, p105 was localized exclusively in the cytoplasm (Fig. 6C).Figure 6:Cell immunostaining. MC3 (A) and Cos7 (C) cells were immunostained with the anti-p105 antiserum 1140 as detailed under “Materials and Methods.” p105 is stained red.

We now report that p105 is present at significant levels in the nucleus of EBV-positive B cell lines, where it can contribute to the regulation of NF-κB. This is the first report describing the nuclear distribution of p105 in human B cell lines. Alternative spliced forms of p105 were recovered in the nucleus of murine B cells(28.Grumont R.J. Fecondo J. Gerondakis S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 8460-8470Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Moreover, in Cos7, C terminus-deleted p105 efficiently translocated into the nucleus(26.Blank V.

In our case, we rule out that the nuclear p105 detected in EBV-positive B cells was an alternative spliced form or a C terminus-deleted form of p105. In fact, the nuclear p105 was detected as a unique protein of 105 kDa using an antiserum directed against the C-terminal amino acids 955-969 of p105, which are usually lost in the alternative spliced forms (28.Grumont R.J.

In Cos7, p105 was retained in the cytoplasm due to the presence of the C-terminal ankyrin repeats, which were assumed to mask the nuclear localization signal of p105(26.Blank V. Kourilsky P. Israël A. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 4159-4167Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar, 27.Henkel T. Zabel U. van Zee K. Müller J.M. Fanning E. Baeuerle P.A.

EMBO J. 1993; 12: 201-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar). In the examined EBV-positive B cells (MC3 and CB33), cell type-specific factors as well as EBV proteins may induce post-translational modifications of p105 resulting in the unmasking of the nuclear localization signal of the protein. Alternatively, p105 may be translocated into the nucleus by direct interaction with EBV proteins or EBV-induced cellular factors. These possibilities are under investigation. In addition, we show that p105 was associated with p65, but not c-Rel, in the nucleus. This association could potentially serve to down-regulate the p65-mediated gene expression, as p105 inhibits the DNA binding of NF-κB subunits(20.Mercurio F. DiDonato J.A. Rosette C. Karin M. Genes & Dev. 1993; 7: 705-718Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar, 24.Rice N.R. MacKichan M.L. Israël A. Cell. 1992; 71: 243-253Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar). This suggests that B cell lines, such as EBV-positive B cells, which have a constitutive NF-κB activity and a high content of nuclear NF-κB/Rel proteins, may have developed an additional control of NF-κB activity mediated by p105 directly at the nuclear level. Interestingly, concomitantly with NF-κB activation by mitomycin C, p105 was processed to p50 in the nucleus but not in the cytoplasm. Moreover, the IκBα protein level was not significantly modified in the cytoplasm by the DNA alkylating agent. These events were strictly associated with the nuclear increase in p50, but not in p65 and c-Rel. Altogether these results indicate that NF-κB activation by mitomycin C was mainly due to the generation of active NF-κB complexes directly in the nucleus through the processing of nuclear p105 rather than to the nuclear translocation of NF-κB complexes released by the proteolysis of IκB inhibitors in the cytoplasm. Differently, PMA preferentially acted at the cytoplasmic level by inducing the degradation of IκBα and, to a less extent, the proteolysis of p105, which resulted in the nuclear translocation of p65 and c-Rel. Nuclear p105 content was unaffected by the PMA treatment. These findings clearly indicate the existence of different signal transduction pathways in MC3 cells leading to the degradation of specific NF-κB inhibitors either at the nuclear or at the cytoplasmic level, depending on the nature of the signaling molecules. Accordingly, a signal-specific degradation of IκBβ was reported(5.Thompson J.E. Phillips R.J. Erdjument-Bromage H. Tempst P. Ghosh S. Cell. 1995; 80: 573-582Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (691) Google Scholar). Thus, by targeting specific IκB proteins, NF-κB activators could differently modulate the nuclear content of Rel/NF-κB factors and determine the composition of nuclear NF-κB complexes.

https://openalex.org/W1506601812,"The POU proteins Brn-3a and Brn-3b belong to a family of DNA binding transcription factors that share stretches of extensive homology. Both Brn-3a and Brn-3b are expressed as shorter and longer isoforms. The long form of Brn-3a is able to oncogenically transform primary fibroblasts. By contrast, the short form of Brn-3b (Brn-3b(s)) cannot transform fibroblasts but is able to specifically inhibit the transforming activity of Brn-3a(l). Moreover, Brn-3a(l) can act as a transcriptional transactivator, while Brn-3b(s) is not only unable to do so but in addition specifically inhibits the transactivating activity of Brn-3a(l). Here, we show that the opposite and antagonistic activities of Brn-3a(l) and Brn-3b(s) proteins are due to their different DNA binding properties; Brn-3a(l) but not Brn-3b(s) can form stable complexes with several octamer-related target DNA sequences. The presence of Brn-3b(s) completely inhibits the binding of Brn-3a(l) to DNA by preventing the formation of Brn-3a(l)-DNA complexes as well as by disrupting preformed complexes. Experiments with GST fusion proteins and in vitro binding studies suggest that the inhibition of Brn-3a(l) activity by Brn-3b(s) occurs via direct interaction of the two transcription factors in solution. Therefore, we hypothesize that Brn-3b(s) can act as a direct antagonist of Brn-3a(l) by inhibiting its DNA binding through the formation of an inactive hetero-oligomeric complex."

INTRODUCTIONAdenylate kinases constitute a family of highly conserved soluble proteins that catalyzes the interconversion of nucleoside phosphates (Noda, 1973) and, thus, fulfills an essential function in maintaining the energy charge in cells (Atkinson, 1977). In mammals three types of isozymes exist. They can be divided into short and long isoforms of 21 and 25 kDa molecular mass, respectively. The short form enzyme, AK, ( (1)The abbreviations used are: AKadenylate kinaseAky2pyeast major adenylate kinaseAKY2gene encoding Aky2pAky3pGTP:AMP phosphotransferase in yeast wild strainsAKY3gene encoding Aky3pPAK3expressed, nonfunctional allele of AKY3IPTGisopropyl-1-thio-β-D-galactopyranosidePCRpolymerase chain reactionGp5Aguanosine(5′)pentaphospho(5′)- adenosinePAGEpolyacrylamide gel electrophoresis.) resides in the cytoplasm. Based on differences in primary structure, substrate utilization, and subcellular location, two distinct subgroups of the 25-kDa form can be discriminated, called AK2 and AK3 (for a review, see Schulz(1987)). AK2 is located mainly in the mitochondrial intermembrane space and uses ATP•Mg2+ as donor of the high energy phosphate, while AK3, which occurs in the mitochondrial matrix, uses GTP•Mg2+ and ITP•Mg2+ (Tomasselli et al., 1979a, 1986). The latter is thought to play a role in the interconversion of non-ATP nucleoside triphosphates, ITP, and GTP (Tomasselli et al., 1979b), generated by substrate chain phosphorylation through succinic thiokinase in the tricarboxylic acid cycle.By contrast, procaryotes were shown to contain only a single member of the adenylate kinase family, a long form isozyme (Brune et al., 1985). In yeast, the major isoform of adenylate kinases, Aky2p, is a protein of 24 kDa molecular mass displaying highest homology to mammalian AK2 isozymes. As in bacteria, this protein was considered to be the only adenylate kinase in yeast. However, the finding that haploid disruption mutants of AKY2 are viable although slowly growing on glucose (Bandlow et al., 1988) pointed to the existence of isozymes. Recently we have isolated the genes of two AMP kinase isozymes from yeast, designated URA6 and PAK3 (Liljelund et al., 1989; Schricker et al., 1992a, 1992b). URA6 was isolated as a multi-copy suppressor of AKY2 deficiency, showing that the encoded enzyme has the capacity to phosphorylate AMP (in addition to UMP and CMP). Thus, the yeast enzyme has a substrate specificity that is broader than originally assumed and different from UMP kinase from Dictyostelium discoideum (Wiesmüller et al., 1990; Schricker et al., 1992b). PAK3 was isolated by PCR. It is encoded on chromosome V (Schricker et al., 1992a) upstream of RAD3 (Reynolds et al., 1985). PAK3 displays closest similarity with mammalian AK3 and is expressed in a carbon source controlled manner. In our studies on Pak3p, we failed to detect enzymic activity with any combination of nucleoside mono- and triphosphate co-substrates tested. In addition, the gene did not complement the temperature-conditional adenylate kinase deficiency of an adk1-1ts mutant of E. coli or the aky2 null allele mutant of yeast strain DL1-D16. Moreover, a disruption of PAK3, either alone or in conjunction with an AKY2 disruption, did not produce a distinctive phenotype (Schricker et al., 1992a; Konrad, 1993).Here, we report the conversion of the apparently nonfunctional PAK3 allele into one displaying both enzymatic and biological activity by introducing a +1 frameshift mutation into the 3′-proximal coding region of the gene. We provide evidence that the nonfunctional allele is characteristic of extensively cultivated strains of Saccharomyces cerevisiae, commonly used for laboratory and brewery purposes. By contrast, functional alleles can be found in some “wild” yeasts.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESYeast StrainsAH215 (Hinnen et al., 1978), DL1 (van Loon et al., 1983), DBY939 (Carlson and Botstein, 1982), AB320 (Nasmyth and Reed, 1980), D273-10B (ATCC 24657), TF2 (Fox, 1979), IL993-5C (Wolf et al., 1973), DDY183 (obtained from D. Drubin, Berkeley, CA) YM701 (from M. Johnston, St. Louis, MO), 6657-9B (from J. R. Mattoon, Colorado Springs, CO), SP1 (from J. Thevelein, Heverlee, Belgium), S. cerevisiae Laureio (brewers' yeast, from A. Wiest, Weihenstephan, Germany), S. diastaticus, S. capensis (both from The Yeast Genetics Stock Center, Leiden, The Netherlands), wine yeast “Malaga,” wine yeast “Bordeaux” (both from Kitzinger Reinzuchthefen, Kitzingen, Germany) were used for sequence comparison of PAK3 alleles. DL1-D16 aky2::LEU2 (Schricker et al., 1992a) served as the parental strain for transformation with AKY3 on multicopy or low copy yeast shuttle plasmids.Cell Growth and Preparation and Subfractionation of MitochondriaYeast strains were grown on semisynthetic medium, which was supplemented according to the auxotrophic requirements and contained either 3% glucose, 3% lactate, or 3% glycerol plus 2% ethanol as carbon sources. Some cultures contained up to 8% glucose or ethanol as the sole carbon source as indicated. Spheroplasts were prepared from mid-logarithmic cultures (1-2 × 107 cells per ml) and lysed in 0.45 M mannitol. Mitochondria were prepared from the 10,000 × g pellet and purified by Percoll gradient centrifugation as described previously (Müller and Bandlow, 1989).MutagenesisFor random frameshift mutagenesis, 0.3 ml of an overnight culture of the E. coli strain JH17 adk1-1ts (Henson et al., 1982) harboring the PAK3 allele of yeast strain AB320 ligated to vector pKK223-3 was diluted 10-fold and, after 1 h of preincubation, treated for 1 h with 30 or 60 μg/ml acriflavin at 30°C. Then, the cells were washed 5 times and allowed to regenerate overnight at 30°C. After five more washes, 200-μl aliquots were plated onto LB agar plates containing 1 mM IPTG and 30 μg/ml ampicillin. Complementing clones were selected by incubation overnight at 39°C. Plasmids were prepared, brought back into JH17 adk1-1ts, which carried a plasmid, pREP4, overproducing lac repressor. 20 adk1-1ts-complementing plasmids were isolated from nine different experiments yielding at least 12 independent frameshift mutants. Site-specific in vitro mutagenesis was performed as described previously (Kunkel et al., 1987; Magdolen et al., 1992).Construction of AKY3-Containing Yeast Shuttle PlasmidsGenomic DNA from strain D273-10B was used to amplify the complete AKY3 gene by PCR using primers that contained a 5′-terminal SpeI and a 3′-terminal NcoI restriction site. This allowed orientation-specific insertion of the amplified fragment into the yeast expression cassette of vector pEx, containing the moderately strong constitutive promoter and the terminator region of the AKY2 gene (Schricker et al., 1992b).Construction of an aky3 Null Allele in the Yeast Strain D273-10BA homozygous diploid his3− mutant strain was constructed from the prototrophic haploid strain D273-10B. HIS3 was destroyed by one-step gene disruption, using the chloramphenicol acetyltransferase gene of E. coli as a dominant selectable marker gene. For this purpose, the 1.6-kilobase chloramphenicol acetyltransferase-containing SphI/EcoRV fragment of pCH100 (Hadfield et al., 1987) was inserted into the unique BalI site of the HIS3 gene. The disruption construct was excised as a 3500-base pair linear BamHI fragment and transfected into D273-10B. Stable transformants were selected on glycerol/EtOH medium containing chloramphenicol (2 mg/ml) and positive clones checked for correct recombination of the construct at the HIS3 locus by Southern blot analysis. For diploidization, a D273-10B his3::CAT strain was transformed by plasmid YCp-HIS3-HO harboring a 4.6-kilobase EcoRI/SalI fragment encoding the yeast HO gene (Russel et al., 1986). Zygotes were isolated by micromanipulation. The resulting homozygous, isogenic his3 diploid strain D273-5d was cured of YCp-HIS3-HO under nonselective conditions and then used to introduce an aky3 null allele mutation. For this reason, the strain was transformed with a linear 2.5-kilobase EcoRI/EcoRV fragment of the pak3::HIS3 construct described previously (Schricker et al., 1992a). Proper gene disruption was assured by Southern blotting. Tetrad analysis of the aky3/AKY3 strains obtained was performed by micromanipulation using the MSM System (Singer Instrument Co. Ltd., Watchet, Somerset, United Kingdom).Production of AntiserumThe AKY3 allele of yeast strain D273-10B, comprising the complete coding region but lacking 5′- and 3′-flanking sequences, was amplified by PCR and thereby equipped with BamHI restriction sites at both ends. This fragment was ligated to the BamHI site of the E. coli expression vector pQE8 (Diagen, Hilden), thus fusing a tag of 6 histidine residues in frame to the amino terminus of Aky3p. The recombinant protein was expressed under the guidance of the IPTG-inducible lacUV5 promoter and purified from bacterial lysates by two consecutive elutions from Ni2+ chelate columns according to the protocol obtained from the supplier. Two hens were immunized (Gassmann et al., 1990) using about 100 μg of the homogenous protein in complete Freund's adjuvant per injection. Two boost injections were applied 4 and 8 weeks after the initial injection. The immunoglobulin fraction was prepared by dextran sulfate precipitation (Jensenius et al., 1981) from the yolks of the eggs laid on six consecutive days, which exhibited the highest antibody titers.Miscellaneous ProceduresPublished procedures were used for determination of adenylate kinase activity (Bandlow et al., 1988) and protein concentration (Bradford, 1984), for Western blotting and immunodecoration, DNA sequencing, PCR amplification of DNA, and all other molecular procedures (Sambrook et al., 1989).RESULTSGain of Biological Activity by Frameshift MutationsComparison of the primary structure deduced from the nucleotide sequence of the PAK3 gene, isolated from the S. cerevisiae strain DL1, with the sequences of other adenylate kinases belonging to either short or long isoforms revealed an unusually short carboxyl terminus (Fig. 1). As a consequence, this allele lacks two hydrophobic residues at positions 235 and 239 (family numbering, cf. Magdolen et al.(1992)), which are strictly conserved in all other known adenylate kinases. In the cases of Aky2p from yeast (Magdolen et al., 1992) and AK1 from chicken (Yoneya et al., 1990), it has been shown that deletions of the carboxyl terminus or conversion of amino acid 239 into a hydrophilic residue led to drastically diminished protein stability and/or enzymatic activity. The suspicion that this AK3 allele, PAK3, might have been shortened by a frameshift mutation that has resulted in an inactive protein was corroborated by the fact that the introduction of a +1 frameshift shortly 5′-adjacent to the stop codon would extend the reading frame by 27 base pairs. Simultaneously, the amino acid sequence similarity with other adenylate kinases would be increased by the restoration of two hydrophobic amino acid residues at the highly conserved positions 235 and 239 (Fig. 1).We examined whether the introduction of such a frameshift produced an enzymatically active protein. A guanosine residue was inserted into codon 233 by site-directed in vitro mutagenesis, converting the original triplet specifying an arginine, which is not observed in any other nucleoside monophosphate kinase, into an alanine-encoding one. The altered amino acid sequence at the carboxyl terminus of PAK3, deduced from the verified nucleotide sequence, is shown in Fig. 1. To test for biological activity, the gene was inserted into the E. coli expression vector pKK223-3. IPTG-induced expression of the extended yeast gene in the temperature-sensitive adk1 E. coli mutant strain JH17 [pREP4] restored growth under the nonpermissive conditions (39°C), whereas the original PAK3 gene failed to complement (Fig. 2).Figure 2:Complementation of the temperature-conditional phenotype of the adk1-defective E. coli strain JH17 with plasmids encoding AKY3 alleles from yeast or mutants thereof obtained after random frameshift mutagenesis.

The sectors are as follows: JH17, untransformed control; fs(1), frameshift product of in vitro mutagenesis; 2A(2), 8C(3), 1B(4), frameshift mutant alleles, types 2, 3, and 4 (explained in the legend to Fig. 3) obtained after acriflavin mutagenesis; D273, AKY3 gene of wild-type D273-10B expressed in JH17; DL1, PAK3 allele of laboratory yeast strain DL1 expressed in JH17.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)We tested whether we could select for biological activity after random mutagenesis of the PAK3 allele from yeast strain DL1. After exposure of JH17 (PAK3), transformant cells to the frameshift-inducing drug, acriflavin, complementing clones were selected by their ability to restore growth of the adk1 mutant strain JH17 at a nonpermissive temperature. By this means, it was possible to isolate 20 complementing clones (derived from nine independent mutageneses) that were subsequently sequenced. The gain of complementing activity was accompanied by a +1 frameshift in each case (Fig. 3, types 2-4) occurring within seven base pairs of the 3′-end of the coding region of the gene spanning the mutation originally proposed (Fig. 3, type 1). At least eight independent isolates of mutants containing mutation type 2, three of type 3, and one of type 4 were obtained. Although all single base pair insertions 3′ of position 492 (corresponding to Glu at position 196 in the protein family numbering, Magdolen et al.(1992)) potentially lead to proteins that are 9 amino acids longer at the carboxyl terminus than Pak3p, only four nucleotide positions lying within three consecutive triplets were tolerated and led to an active protein product. All alleles capable of complementation contained amphiphilic amino acid residues at positions 235 and 239. At position 234 exclusively, a lysine was tolerated. Interestingly, position 233 showed some variability and displayed either Pro, Arg, or Ala. Since only +1 frameshifts where found, the carboxyl-terminal sequences of all mutants were identical.Figure 3:Alleles of PAK3 selected after random frameshift mutagenesis due to their capability to complement the temperature conditional adk1-1 mutation of E. coli.

AKY3, amino acid sequence of the wild yeast allele of strain D273-10B.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Alleles with a +1 Frameshift Occur in Wild Yeast StrainsThe finding that the apparently nonfunctional PAK3 allele from strain DL1 could be converted into a biologically active gene by insertion of a single base pair suggested that in DL1 an originally functional gene had been inactivated by a single base pair deletion. To investigate whether this trait is restricted to strain DL1 or is a general feature of S. cerevisiae and possibly other yeast species, we isolated, by use of PCR, the respective parts of the AKY3 genes from several strains, ranging from industrial and laboratory strains to “wild” yeasts. To have a fair chance to amplify the 3′-ends of the respective AKY3 alleles, the reverse primer was designed complementary to the noncoding strand of the 3′-adjacent RAD3 gene. Among the 18 strains examined this way, two (Saccharomyces uvarum and Saccharomyces carlesbergensis) repeatedly failed to give rise to a PCR product, probably due to either sequence divergence between the primers used and the genomic sequences or to genomic rearrangement in the intergenic region between AKY3 and RAD3. The nucleotide sequences of the remaining alleles fell into two groups (Fig. 4). The majority of them were identical to the one found in DL1. But in the residual five, a frameshift was observed within the Arg codon at position 233 (cf. Fig. 1). A C residue is introduced, changing the triplet for Arg into a proline codon (Fig. 3, AKY3). Most interestingly, all strains harboring the DL1 version of the gene, encoding an inactive protein, were strains used either in research laboratories or in the beer brewing industry. The alleles carrying the insertion and encoding the enzymatically active protein belonged, with the exception of D273-10B, to the more distantly related genera Saccharomyces diastaticus, Saccharomyces capensis, and the wine yeasts Malaga and Bordeaux. D273-10B is a laboratory strain without genetic markers.Figure 4:Nucleotide sequencing of DNA material obtained after PCR amplification of the AKY3/RAD3-intergenic region using a forward primer matching to the 3′-end of AKY3. Panel A gives an example for the results obtained with those strains and species containing the deletion: PAK3 type allele of DL1. Identical sequences were obtained with DDY193, DL1, DBY939, AB320, AH215, TF2, IL993, YM701, 6657-9B, SP1, and brewery yeast S. cerevisiae Laureiro. Panel B displays sequences from D273-10B (AKY3 allele), which were obtained in identical form also from S. diastaticus, S. capensis, and the wine yeasts Malaga and Bordeaux.

We named the allele encoding the enzymatically active protein version AKY3.Enzymatic Specificity of Aky3pThe enzymatic specificity of Aky3p was analyzed in extracts of E. coli JH17 transformant strains overproducing the biologically functional isoforms of Aky3p from yeast strain D273-10B and from some mutants obtained from the frameshift mutagenesis experiment or, as a control, overproducing the inactive Pak3p (Fig. 2). As can be seen from Table 1, the extracts derived from cells containing a biologically active, i.e. E. coli adk1-complementing, AKY3 allele also contained significant GTP:AMP phosphotransferase activity. On the other hand, cells from transformants harboring the PAK3 allele (or URA6 in inverted orientation, negative control, not shown) did not display any activity with these substrates above the level found in the control strain transformed with the vector without AKY3 gene. The background in extracts from the nontransformed JH17 mutant was below 2%. In addition to GTP:AMP kinase activity, a less pronounced ITP:AMP activity was found. With other nucleoside triphosphates including ATP, no significant enzymatic activity was observed. In contrast to any other known adenylate kinase, this isozyme could not be inhibited by the specific adenylate kinase inhibitor, Ap5A (no significant inhibition even at 0.115 mM in the presence of 0.6 mM of each GTP•Mg2+ and AMP), and only very poorly by Gp5A (about 70% inhibition at 0.08 mM Gp5A, 0.03 mM GTP•Mg2+, and 0.03 mM AMP).Tabled 1 Open table in a new tab To show unambiguosly that the observed activity is associated with the enzyme and not caused by nonspecific background, we purified the enzyme. The modification of the amino terminus of the recombinant Aky3p by a histidine tag allowed the one-step enrichment of the product using Ni2+ chelate chromatography but did not dramatically impair enzymic activity, since the altered product complemented the adk1-1ts mutation in E. coli strain JH17. The purification steps were monitored by SDS-PAGE of the fractions obtained. As seen in Fig. 5, the major protein, enriched in the eluate fractions, is clearly smaller than 30 kDa (as expected). The molecular mass calculated from the running behavior in SDS-PAGE is slightly overestimated as compared with that deduced from the gene sequence (Schricker et al., 1992a). In the final product (lane 4), very little contamination could be detected. The enrichment of the protein was associated with an about 40-fold increase in the GTP:AMP phosphotransferase activity (Fig. 5, bottom line). Coincident with the results obtained with crude extracts, this fraction contained also an increased ITP:AMP phosphotransferase activity, but no phosphorylation of AMP was observed with ATP or other nucleoside triphosphates (data not shown).Figure 5:Purification of Aky3p after heterologous expression in E. coli. Histidine-tagged recombinant Aky3p was purified by Ni2+-chelate column chromatography (see “Experimental Procedures”). Lane 1, homogenate from E. coli JH17 transformant after induction with IPTG; lane 2, column flow-through; lane 3, protein eluted from the column with imidazole; lane 4, rechromatography of the material displayed in lane 3.

To determine whether the yeast enzyme displays a similar behavior and whether a significant change in substrate specificity of yeast Aky3p occurs at an elevated pH, the activities with GTP, ATP, and ITP as phosphate donors were assayed dependent on pH. This assay has been performed likewise with crude mitochondrial extracts of an Aky3p-overproducing yeast strain (Fig. 6) and with the recombinant His-tagged soluble protein synthesized in and purified from E. coli strain JH17 transformed with an AKY3 expression plasmid (data not shown). The pH optima differ slightly between the two proteins. With both, the His-tagged recombinant protein and the natural Aky3 protein from mitochondrial extracts of an Aky3p-overproducing yeast transformant, the pH optimum of the reaction was at about 8.5 with ITP as phosphate donor, whereas with GTP it was likewise at 8.5 for the His-tagged protein (not shown), but at around 10.5 with the natural Aky3p (Fig. 6). At pH 8.5, the activity was similar with both substrates, but the maximum activity with GTP was about 2-3-fold higher at pH 10.5. Thus, like bovine AK3, also the yeast enzyme displays significantly higher activities with GTP at more alkanine pH values, but still none with ATP as phosphate donor.Figure 6:pH dependence of enzymatic activities of Aky3p. Adenosine monophosphate (0.6 mM substrate) phosphotransferase activity was measured (25°C) with GTP or ITP (0.6 mM each) as phosphate donors as described (Bandlow et al., 1988). The buffer contained 70 mM triethanolamine, and the pH was adjusted with HCl as indicated.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Overproduction of Aky3p Fails to Complement AKY2 DeficiencyThe complementation of E. coli mutant JH17 adk1-1 by AKY3 demonstrates the capability of the yeast enzyme to substitute for the sole adenylate kinase of E. coli encoded by the adk1 gene. This enzyme is equivalent to Aky2p, the major isoform in yeast. We investigated the capacity of AKY3 also to complement the deficiency of AKY2 in yeast strain DL1-D16 (aky2). AKY2-deficient yeast cells do not grow on nonfermentable substrates and, thus, display a Pet phenotype, presumably because they are unable to exchange the ATP generated by oxidative phosphorylation efficiently against ADP over the inner mitochondrial membrane due to shortage of the latter. This means that aky2 mutants are likely arrested in state 4 of respiration (Bandlow et al., 1988). Aky3p phosphorylates AMP and produces ADP and potentially can overcome this limitation. To test for complementation, the aky2 mutant strain was transformed with the yeast shuttle vector YEp352 harboring the AKY3 allele from strain D273-10B expressed under the guidance of the moderately strong yeast AKY2 promoter (Schricker et al., 1992a). No complementation was observed in yeast (Fig. 7) indicating that, in contrast to E. coli, Aky3p cannot substitute for Aky2p in yeast.Figure 7:Test for complementation by overproduction of Aky3p of the Pet phenotype caused by Aky2p deficiency. Cells were streaked onto glucose (left plate) or glycerol medium (right plate). The sectors display the following strains: DL1-D16 aky2, transformed with a multicopy plasmid expressing PAK3 under the control of the moderately strong AKY2 promoter; DL1-D16 aky2, transformed with a multicopy plasmid expressing the AKY3 gene from strain D273-10B under the control of the AKY2 promoter; wild-type D273-10B.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Subcellular Location of Aky3pThe notion that the yeast AKY3 gene complements the adk1 deficiency of E. coli, which is even more sensitive to changes in energy charge than yeast, rules out that the reason for the failure of AKY3 to complement the deficiency of AKY2 in yeast is caused by an inability of Aky3p to phosphorylate AMP efficiently. In the multicopy transformants of DL1-D16, Aky3p was expressed under the control of the moderately strong AKY2 promoter, and the level of AMP kinase activity, detected by the enzyme test in cell homogenates (data not shown), was comparable with that in URA6 multicopy transformants that have been shown previously to complement the AKY2 deficiency of the strain DL1-D16 (Schricker et al., 1992b).Since in mammals AK3 resides in the mitochondrial matrix, it seemed feasible to explain the lack of complementation by the occurrence of Aky2p and Aky3p in different subcellular compartments"
https://openalex.org/W2037397431,"A new genetic screen for mutations in the tus gene of Escherichia coli has been devised that selects for Tus proteins with altered ability to arrest DNA replication. We report here the characterization of three such mutants: TusP42S, TusE49K, and TusH50Y. TusP42S and TusE49K arrest DNA replication in vivo at 36% of the efficiency of wild-type Tus, whereas TusH50Y functions at 78% efficiency. The loss of replication arrest activity did not correlate with changes in the stability of the Tus-TerB complexes formed by the mutant proteins. TusE49K formed a more stable protein-DNA complex than wild-type Tus (t1/2 of 178 versus 149 min, respectively) and TusP42 had a 9-min half-life, yet these two mutants showed identical efficiencies for replication arrest. When tested in vitro using a helicase assay or an oriC replication system, we observed a general, but imperfect, correlation between the in vivo and in vitro assays. Finally, the half-lives of the mutant protein-DNA complexes suggested that the domain of Tus where these mutations are located is positioned close to the DNA in the Tus-Ter complex.

Finally, the half-lives of the mutant protein-DNA complexes suggested that the domain of Tus where these mutations are located is positioned close to the DNA in the Tus-Ter complex. INTRODUCTIONDNA replication forks traversing the chromosome of Escherichia coli are halted at specific protein-DNA complexes composed of the Tus protein bound to a Ter site (for reviews, see Hill(1992), Yoshikawa and Wake(1993), and Baker (1995)). Tus binds a Ter site as a monomer (Sista et al., 1991; Coskun-Ari et al., 1994) and forms an asymmetric protein-DNA complex that arrests replication forks in an orientation-dependent fashion (Gottlieb et al., 1992). Thus, the Ter sites that have been identified in the E. coli chromosome (TerA-TerF) are oriented to permit DNA replication in the origin to terminus direction, but block DNA replication forks moving in the terminus to origin direction (deMassy et al., 1987; Hill et al., 1987; Hidaka et al., 1988).The Tus protein contains 309 amino acids and binds the TerB site with high affinity, yet does not contain a recognizable DNA binding motif (Hill et al., 1989). Furthermore, it has not been possible to identify a DNA-binding fragment by proteolysis and the protein appears to be fully protected from trypsin or chymotrypsin when bound to a Ter site (Coskun-Ari et al., 1994).Tus is believed to arrest DNA replication by inhibiting the action of DnaB (Khatri et al., 1989; Lee et al., 1989; Hiasa and Marians, 1992), the major replicative helicase of E. coli (LeBowitz and McMacken, 1986). The mechanism for Tus function is proposed to occur through protein-protein interactions between a domain of Tus and DnaB. The first evidence for this type of mechanism was the apparent specificity of the interaction between Tus and DnaB (Khatri et al., 1989). More compelling evidence for a protein-protein interaction between Tus and the replisome came from studies where the length of the oligomer on a helicase substrate affected the ability of Tus to block DnaB helicase (Hiasa and Marians, 1992). When a short 60-nucleotide long oligomeric substrate was used, Tus was able to block DnaB progression in an orientation-dependent manner. But when a longer, 250-nucleotide long substrate was used, Tus was unable to block DnaB. These observations suggested that on a short substrate, one measures strand displacement rather true helicase unwinding. Therefore, on the long substrate where true helicase unwinding is occurring, Tus was not able to block DnaB progression, suggesting that binding of Tus to Ter alone does not inhibit DnaB and that protein-protein interactions must also be involved.This observation is supported by the recently characterized mutant TusA173V (Skokotas et al., 1994). TusA173V has a much lower affinity for the TerB site than wild-type Tus (Kobs of 4.4 × 10-11Mversus 7.8 × 10-13M, respectively, in KG200 buffer) and forms a less stable protein-DNA complex, yet still arrests DNA replication in vivo at approximately 75% the efficiency of wild-type Tus. This result indicated that a large decrease in the affinity of TusA173V for TerB did not lead to a corresponding decrease in replication arrest activity, as would be expected if binding alone was responsible for the inhibition of DNA replication.In order to understand further the molecular basis of replication termination, we have mutagenized the tus gene to produce proteins with altered function. Potential tus mutants identified by a new genetic screen were characterized on the basis of their ability to bind to Ter sites and by their ability to halt DNA replication in a plasmid containing a Ter site. Here we report the isolation and characterization of three new Tus mutants that bind Ter sites, yet have reduced ability to halt DNA replication forks.MATERIALS AND METHODSPlasmids and Bacterial StrainsPlasmid pBAD18 (from J. Beckwith, Harvard) contains the araC gene, pBAD promoter, and pBR322 origin of replication; it confers ampicillin resistance and is 4.6 kb ( 1The abbreviation used is: kbkilobase pair.) in size. Plasmid pACMtus was a generous gift from B. Michel (INRA, Jouy-en-Josas). It is a derivative of pBADtus (Sharma and Hill, 1995) in which the araC gene, pBAD promoter, and tus gene of pBADtus were cloned into pACYC184. It is 5.4 kb in size and confers chloramphenicol resistance. pAXtus describes pACMtus plasmids that have been passed through XL-1 Red cells. Plasmid pHV750T2+ is a derivative of pHV750 (Bierne et al., 1991) and contains a TerB site inserted in an active orientation approximately 900 base pairs from the pBR322 unidirectional origin of replication.Epicurian coli® strain XL1-Red is deficient in the primary DNA repair pathways and was purchased from Stratagene (La Jolla, CA). E. coli strain TH460 was constructed by transforming TH320 [Δtus, recA56 srl300::Tn10, InvTer::spcr cassette] (Sharma and Hill, 1995) with plasmid pBAD18. Strain TH325 was constructed by transforming TH205 (Δtus::kanr) with plasmid pHV750T2+.Mutagenesis of pACMtusMutagenesis was performed as recommended by Stratagene. Briefly, to 100 μl of XL1-Red competent cells, β-mercaptoethanol was added to give a final concentration of 25 mM and the mixture was incubated on ice for 10 min. Twenty ng of pACMtus was then added and the mixture was incubated for 30 min on ice. The mixture was then heat pulsed at 42°C for 55 s. 0.9 ml of preheated (42°C) LB media was added and the tubes were incubated at 37°C for 45 min with shaking. Two-hundred μl of the transformation mixture were plated onto each of five LB plates containing 50 μg/ml chloramphenicol and the plates were incubated for 24 h at 37°C. Colonies from each individual plate were combined to produce five distinct pools. The pools were inoculated into 5 ml of LB containing 50 μg/ml chloramphenicol for 24 h at 37°C with shaking. The cultures were then diluted 50-fold and incubated an additional 24 h in LB-Cam media. The pACMtus plasmid DNA was then extracted from each pool using the Wizard miniprep DNA purification system (Promega, Madison, WI) and renamed pAXtus to indicate that it had been mutagenized.pAXtus plasmid DNA was electroporated into strain TH460 using a Cell-Porator with Voltage Booster (Life Technologies Inc., Gaithersburg, MD), according to the manufacturer's recommendations. Cells were plated onto LB plates containing 50 μg/ml chloramphenicol, 50 μg/ml ampicillin, and 0.4% arabinose. Plates were incubated for 18 h at 37°C. Colonies that grew to normal size were then restreaked onto the same type of plates to screen for false positives. To reduce the frequency of siblings, no more than five colonies were characterized from each individual pool. Mutants that had the same mutation and which were collected from the same pool were considered to be siblings; mutants that had the same mutation and which were collected from independent pools were considered independent mutants.Assay for DNA Binding ActivityTo assay Ter binding activity of the mutants, crude cell extracts were prepared (Skokotas et al., 1994) and DNA binding activity was determined by a nitrocellulose filter assay, as described in Gottlieb et al.(1992), with the following modification. In place of KG binding buffer and filter buffers, we substituted KG200 binding buffer, containing 50 mM Tris-Cl, pH 7.5, at 25°C, 200 mM potassium glutamate, 0.1 mM dithiothreitol, 0.1 mM EDTA, and 100 μg/ml bovine serum albumin and KG200 filter buffer, containing 50 mM Tris-Cl, pH 7.5, at 25°C, 200 mM potassium glutamate, and 0.1 mM EDTA.Assay for Replication IntermediatesTo assay tus mutants for the ability to arrest DNA replication, a modification of Horiuchi's Y-fork assay was performed (Horiuchi et al., 1987). First, the appropriate pAXtus plasmid was transformed into strain TH325, a Δtus strain that contains pHV750T2+. An overnight culture of TH325(pAXtus) was diluted 100-fold in LB, ampicillin, and chloramphenicol were each added to a final concentration of 50 μg/ml, and the cells were grown at 37°C for 30 min. 0.4% arabinose was then added to the culture to induce the expression of the tus gene and the cells were grown to an A600 of 1.0. Whole cell DNA, including plasmids pHV750T2+ and pAXtus, were isolated by treating the cells with 50 mg/ml lysozyme in TE buffer for 5 min, then adding 1% SDS and 10 μg/ml proteinase K. After overnight incubation at room temperature, the DNA was phenol/CHCl3 extracted, precipitated with EtOH, and resuspended in TE buffer. The DNA was then digested with two enzymes, NdeI and SstII. NdeI cuts pHV750T2+ in the region between the pBR322 origin and the TerB site, producing linear and Y-fork replication intermediate fragments. SstII does not cut pHV750T2+, but does cut pAXtus into two fragments, thereby eliminating interference between the pAXtus and pHV750T2+ plasmids. Furthermore, the pAXtus plasmid acts as an internal control for copy number of the pHV750T2+ plasmid. The digested DNA was electrophoresed on a 0.8% agarose gel, blotted onto nitrocellulose, and probed with 32P-labeled pBR322 plasmid. The nitrocellulose was autoradiographed and bands corresponding to the linear and replication intermediates of pHV750T2+ or to the internal control (pAXtus) were cut out and counted.SequencingThe complete gene sequence of each tus mutant was determined using the following reverse sequence primers: 730 (17-mer) CCAATAGCTTGTGTTGC, 880 (17-mer) TTTCGGACTGTTGTTGA, 1030 (17-mer) GGAGTTCTGATTCAACC, 1180 (17-mer) CATCACGA-TGTAAATTC, 1344 (17-mer) AATCGGCTGCACCTTCA, 1480 (17-mer) CATTGTCGGCATCGTAA, and 1640 (17-mer) CTTGCGCTGGGGTATCT. The oligodeoxyribonucleotides were purified by polyacrylamide-urea gel electrophoresis prior to use (Sambrook et al., 1989).Purification of ProteinsTusP42S, TusE49K, and TusH50Y were purified as described previously by Hill and Marians(1990), with the following modifications. DEAE-Sepharose (Pharmacia) was substituted for DE-52. After the DEAE-Sepharose column, the Tus protein was loaded onto a 2-ml SP-Sepharose column and washed with buffer (50 mM Tris-Cl, pH 7.5, at 4°C, 1 mM EDTA, 1 mM dithiothreitol, and 20% glycerol). The protein was eluted from the column using a 0-500 mM NaCl salt gradient in the same buffer. DnaB protein was purified from strain RLM1038 (a generous gift from Roger McMacken) using the procedure described by Abarzua et al.(1984).Determination of Binding ConstantsThe activity of the mutant Tus proteins was determined by titrating a fixed amount of labeled TerB (1 × 10-10M) with increasing protein concentrations (3.72 × 10-12M to 1.86 × 10-9M) in KG200 binding buffer. Mutant Tus protein and TerB were combined in a final reaction volume of 750 μl and incubated for 3 h at 25°C. Two 300-μl aliquots were passed through nitrocellulose filters as described previously in Gottlieb et al.(1992). The amount of TerB bound at each protein concentration was then used to determine the fraction of protein that is active for binding. The activities of the proteins are: TusP42S is 20% active, TusE49K is 25% active, and TusH50Y is 50% active.Kobs, the observed dissociation constant of the equilibrium, was determined by mixing a fixed amount of labeled TerB oligomer (2 × 10-12M) with varying amounts of mutant protein (3 × 10-10M to 5 × 10-13M) in KG200 binding buffer. The total volume of the reaction was 750 μl. The mixture was incubated for 3 h at 25°C and two 300-μl aliquots were applied to filters. The filters were washed with 500 μl of KG200 filter buffer, dried, and counted.kd, the dissociation rate constant, was determined by mixing 1 × 10-11M labeled TerB with 2 × 10-11M protein in KG200 binding buffer in a total volume of 3.75 ml. The mixture was incubated for 1 h at 25°C and a 400-fold excess of unlabeled TerB was added. At the appropriate time intervals, 300-μl aliquots were removed and applied to filters, washed with KG200 filter buffer, dried, and counted.The data from the Kobs and kd experiments were analyzed and plotted as described in Gottlieb et al.(1992).Helicase AssayDnaB catalyzed strand displacement was assayed as described in Skokotas et al.(1994) with the following variations. Tus protein, either wild-type or mutant, was incubated with the reaction mixture for 5 min at 30°C prior to the addition of DnaB, to allow the Tus-TerB complex to form. Also, the single-stranded circular recombinant phage containing the TerB site in active orientation (M13YTB53) was hybridized to a complementary 62-nucleotide oligomer TB53N (5′-TGATAAGCTGTCAAACATGAACTTTAGTTACAACATACTTATTTGAATTCGTAATCATGGTC-3') and the single-stranded circular recombinant phage containing the TerB site in an inactive orientation (M13YTB35) was hybridized to a complementary 61-nucleotide oligomer TB35N (5′-TGATAAGCTGTCAAACATGAAATAAGTATGTTGTAACTAAAGTGAATTCGTAATCATGGTC-3').oriC AssayThe ability of mutant Tus proteins to inhibit a replication fork assembled in vitro was performed as described previously by Hiasa and Marians(1994); but with the addition of 200 mM potassium glutamate to the reaction mixture. The substrate used for these studies was I-535, which contains two TerB sites arranged to block both replication forks arising from oriC. Reaction mixtures were incubated for 2 min at 30°C with Tus before the addition of DnaA. The reaction mixtures were then incubated at 30°C for 15 min before 25 mM EDTA was added to halt the reaction. Reaction products were analyzed by gel electrophoresis to determine the extent of replication inhibition by the mutant Tus proteins.RESULTSMutagenesis and Identification of Mutations in tusE. coli cells containing knockouts of the tus gene do not have an observable phenotype when grown in normal laboratory conditions (Hill et al., 1987; Roecklein et al., 1991). Consequently, in order to identify cells carrying mutant tus alleles, a new genetic screen was developed in which tus mutants were identified by the size of their colonies when grown on selective media. The new genetic screen not only confers a phenotype on tus mutants, it also utilizes a tus gene that is present on a plasmid, making the mutagenesis and manipulation of the tus mutants less cumbersome than in our previous mutant screen (Skokotas et al., 1994).The starting point for the screen is plasmid pACMtus, which contains the araC gene and the tus gene under control of a pBAD promoter. In this plasmid, expression of tus can be induced by the addition of 0.4% arabinose to the growth medium. Prior to selection, pACMtus was mutagenized by passing the plasmid through the DNA repair-deficient strain XL-1 Red for several days. The mutagenized plasmid, called pAXtus, was then extracted and used to transform the selection strain, TH460.TH460 has a tus gene knockout, carries a recA56 allele, and also contains an InvTer::spcr cassette (Sharma and Hill, 1995). The InvTer::spcr cassette is inserted into the terminus region of the E. coli chromosome and contains two Ter sites oriented in a “blocking” configuration, such that both clockwise and counterclockwise moving replication forks are arrested before the chromosome is completed. The blocked replication forks leave a 1.6-kb region between the Ter sites unreplicated. Normally, the incomplete chromosome would trigger the SOS response, but the recA56 allele prevents this. The absence of the SOS response allows cell division to proceed even though the chromosome is partially replicated. It is speculated that loss of the SOS response causes the chromosome to be severed and leads to cell death (Sharma and Hill, 1995). Consequently, in the presence of wild-type Tus, these cells grow very slowly and form small colonies on plates. However, if no Tus is present or a mutant Tus is produced, the chromosome is replicated normally, allowing rapid cell growth and the production of normal sized colonies.When TH460 was transformed with pACMtus and tus gene expression was induced on LB-arabinose plates, the colonies formed after 18 h of incubation were extremely small, while colonies on plates without arabinose were normal in size (Fig. 1).We determined that the frequency of a normal sized colony appearing on an LB-arabinose plate was approximately 1 in 2500 when wild-type Tus was expressed. In comparison, when the pAXtus plasmid was transformed into TH460, many normal sized colonies appeared on the plates containing arabinose, indicating that these colonies carried potential tus mutants. The frequency of normal sized colonies on LB-arabinose plates was 1 in 22 after tus mutagenesis.Candidates producing normal sized colonies are expected to result from mutations in the tus gene that either affect the binding of Tus to Ter or influence the interaction of Tus with DnaB. However, normal sized colonies on arabinose plates could also result from a mutation in the promoter region of the tus gene, which would prevent tus gene expression. Likewise, a mutation in the araC gene of pAXtus would yield a similar phenotype, preventing induction of the tus gene. To compensate for the araC mutations, strain TH460 also carried the plasmid pBAD18, which contains the araC gene. This ensured that a wild-type copy of araC was always present in the cell.Identification of tus MutantsFirst, to determine if candidate tus mutants retained Ter binding activity, crude cell extracts were prepared, incubated with 32P-labeled TerB oligomer, and passed through nitrocellulose filters. The relative Ter binding activity of each mutant tus extract was then compared to the activity of extracts prepared from cells carrying pACMtus that had been grown: 1) in the presence arabinose, which provided the basis for full Ter binding activity; or 2) in the absence of arabinose, which should be devoid of Tus. A total of 77 potential tus mutants were examined for their DNA binding activity. Of these, 62 displayed no DNA binding activity (<10% of wild type activity), five displayed intermediate levels of DNA binding activity (10-60%), and 10 displayed high levels (>60%).Eleven of the candidates with no Ter binding activity have been sequenced in their entirety. Two, tusP95S and tusP238L, had mutations which probably affected the secondary structure of the protein. Similarly, the tusL159P mutation also probably perturbs the structure of the protein. One mutant, tusR9opal, produced a truncated protein and six tus mutants had frameshift mutations, due to the insertion of an additional adenine residue at different positions within the coding sequence. Last, one mutant without significant Ter binding activity had a wild-type tus sequence; we speculate that a mutation is present within the promoter region of this gene. Because all of the mutants without DNA binding activity were not completely sequenced, it should be noted that some of the 62 mutants may be siblings, even though steps were taken to reduce this possibility. Furthermore, some of these mutants may be expression mutants or stability mutants. Therefore, we cannot be certain of the actual number of independent mutations that produce Tus proteins with undetectable DNA binding activity.Of the five independent tus mutant candidates with intermediate counts, only one mutant was sequenced in its entirety and it had a wild-type sequence.Of the 10 independent mutant candidates that displayed high DNA binding activity, four had the tusP42S mutation; four had the tusE49K mutation; and one had the tusH50Y mutation. The last candidate had a wild-type sequence, indicating that it had bypassed our selection screen. Since all three mutant proteins TusP42S, TusE49K, and TusH50Y had high binding activity and the amino acid substitutions were proximal (see Fig. 6), these mutants were examined further for their ability to arrest DNA replication.Figure 6:Position of mutations in Tus that affect DNA-binding and replication arrest efficiency.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Plasmids expressing these three mutant Tus proteins were transformed into strain TH325, a Δtus strain that also contains plasmid pHV750T2+, the test plasmid for replication arrest activity. pHV750T2+ has a TerB site located 900 bases away from the unidirectional origin of replication. DNA replication is halted at the Ter site when it is bound by an active Tus protein. Furthermore, the ColE1 origin of pHV750T2+ is compatible with the p15a origin of the pAXtus plasmid, allowing both plasmids to coexist in the same cell. After growth in the presence of 0.4% arabinose to induce expression of the mutant tus gene, whole cell DNA was isolated under conditions that leave replication intermediates intact. The DNA was then digested with NdeI, which cuts pHV750T2+ between the replication origin and TerB. If DNA replication is not arrested at the TerB site, only a linear pHV750T2+ DNA fragment will be produced. However, if DNA replication is arrested at TerB, the NdeI digest produces a double-Y structure which migrates slower on a gel than the linear fragment (Skokotas et al., 1994).As can be seen in Fig. 2, TusP42S, TusE49K, and TusH50Y all show replication arrest activity in vivo, as judged by the appearance of a slower-migrating plasmid band when the mutant proteins are expressed. However, two distinct differences in the pattern of linear and Y-fork plasmid bands is also apparent: the ratio of linear plasmid DNA to plasmid containing a replication intermediate differs from one mutant to the other, as does the total amount of plasmid DNA (i.e. plasmid copy number). These observations corroborate the conclusions of Bierne et al.(1994) who have shown that the placement of a Ter site in a plasmid affects the copy number of the plasmid and also affects the accumulation of replication intermediates relative to the amount of linear plasmid. Consequently, in assessing the efficiency of replication arrest in vivo, both of these effects had to be factored in when making quantitative comparisons between mutants and wild-type protein. To this end, bands corresponding to the linear and Y-fork forms of pHV750T2+ were excised and counted to determine the relative amounts of the two forms. Also, bands corresponding to the pAXtus plasmid, which cross-hybridized to the probe, were also excised and counted to normalize for the amount of DNA loaded in each lane. We then used the following equation to derive a relative measure of Tus activity in vivo: Activity=(Fraction of pHV750T2+ in Y-fork from/fraction of pHV750T2+ in linear form)(Total pHV750T2+ in mutant Tus lane/total pHV750T2+ in wild-type Tus lane)(Eq. 1) Figure 2:Replication arrest activities of mutant Tus proteins in vivo. Whole cell DNA was isolated under nondenaturing conditions and digested with NdeI and SstII prior to electrophoresis on a 0.8% agarose gel. The Southern blot of the gel was then hybridized to a pBR322 probe to visualize the pHV750T2+ plasmid. The linear pHV750T2+ band is 5.2 kb in length; arrest of DNA replication produces two slower-migrating bands (∼6.6 kb) containing a single or double Y-fork. The two, faint lower bands (2.4 and 3.0 kb) are due cross-hybridization between the probe and the pACMtus plasmid. These bands are used as an internal control for plasmid copy number.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)When this equation was applied to the in vivo data, we obtained the results shown in Table 1. In the strain expressing wild-type Tus, the linear and Y-fork bands were present in roughly equal proportions and the total amount of pHV750T2+ was reduced significantly compared to the amount produced in the absence of Tus. However, strains expressing TusP42S and TusE49K showed higher relative amounts of linear plasmid DNA and also increased total plasmid DNA, suggesting that they arrest DNA replication at only 36% of the efficiency of wild-type Tus. In the strain expressing TusH50Y, the amount of plasmid present in the Y-fork band was almost identical to wild-type Tus, but the total amount of pHV750T2+ plasmid was greater, indicating that TusH50Y arrests DNA replication at 78% efficiency compared to wild-type Tus.Tabled 1 Open table in a new tab It should also be noted that we observed two distinct replication intermediate bands in each lane. This is the result of dimerization of the pHV750T2+ plasmid. ( 2A. Skokotas and T. M. Hill, unpublished results.) The dimerized plasmid will give rise to either single Y replication intermediates or double Y replication intermediates following NdeI digestion, depending upon whether initiation has occurred at one or both of the replication origins in the dimeric plasmid.Dissociation Constant for the Equilibrium and Dissociation Rate Constants for the Tus-TerB ComplexesTo compare directly the binding affinities of wild-type and mutant Tus proteins for TerB, the observed dissociation constants for the equilibrium, Kobs, and the dissociation rate constant, kd, were measured in KG200 buffer. The use of this buffer accelerates the dissociation rate and makes the collection of data easier than the original KG buffer described in a previous paper (Gottlieb et al., 1992).The data revealed that wild-type Tus, TusE49K, and TusH50Y had similar equilibrium binding constants (Table 2). The differences in Kobs values obtained for the mutant proteins and wild-type Tus could be attributed to the rates of dissociation of the Tus-TerB complexes (Fig. 3). The dissociation rates of TusP42S and TusH50Y protein-DNA complexes were 16.5-fold and 5.7-fold faster, respectively, than the wild-type Tus-TerB complex, indicating that these mutant Tus-TerB complexes are inherently less stable. On the contrary, TusE49K, which arrests DNA replication in vivo less well than wild-type Tus, formed a tighter complex with TerB, with a measured half-life of 178 min compared to 149 min for wild type Tus-TerB complexes.Tabled 1 Open table in a new tab Figure 3:Dissociation rates of Tus-TerB complexes formed by mutant and wild-type proteins. Tus proteins (2.0 × 10-10M) were incubated with TerB (1 × 10-10M) for 30 min and a 400-fold excess of unlabeled TerB was then added to the mixture. Aliquots were removed at the indicated times and filtered to determine the number of counts remaining as protein-DNA complex. A representative experiment for each protein type is shown.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Inhibition of DnaB-catalyzed Strand Displacement by Tus Mutant Proteins TusP42S, TusE49K, and TusH50YIn the past, it was shown by several laboratories that Tus blocks the progression of DnaB helicase in an orientation-specific manner (Lee et al., 1989; Khatri et al., 1989; Hiasa and Marians, 1992). This was demonstrated using a helicase assay where a short oligomer (30-62 bases) was hybridized to a single-stranded circular substrate. We were interested in determining if TusP42S, TusE49K, and TusH50Y were able to inhibit DnaB-catalyzed strand displacement using a similar substrate. For these studies, two substrates were used, one containing Ter in an active orientation, M13YTB53, and the other containing Ter in an inactive orientation, M13YTB35. The single-strand circles were hybridized to a complementary 62- and 61-mer oligomer, respectively, containing a TerB site.Our assay conditions allowed the mutant proteins to bind to the substrate for 5 min at 30°C prior to the addition of D"

The fluorescent and nonfluorescent probes N-iodoacetyl-N′-(5-sulfo-1-naphthyl)ethylenediamine and N-(4-dimethylamino-3,5-dinitrophenyl)maleimide were used as the donor and the acceptor, respectively. The distance between Cys2 and Cys155 was measured to be 35 and 30 Å in the absence and presence of myosin heavy chain, respectively, suggesting a slightly more compact structure for the light chain in the bound state. The distance between Cys73 and Cys155 measured in a similar manner was 31 and 30 Å in the free and bound states, respectively; this latter value is in good agreement with that derived from crystallographic structures. For heavy chain-bound light chains, no measurable distance changes were detected with the binding of ATP or actin. These results show that no gross structural changes occur within the regulatory light chain during the contraction cycle, but that resonance energy transfer between other sites could be used to monitor potential changes in the myosin head upon the binding of nucleotides and actin.

It is currently believed that S1 may change its orientation relative to the actin filament during this process and thereby produce a displacement of 450-100 Å, the so-called “working stroke” (Huxley, 1969; Huxley and Simmons, 1971). A persistent problem with the “rotating cross-bridge model” has been the failure to detect any large conformational change in the head by most biophysical methods. It has been suggested that the reactive Cys707 on the heavy chain, the site of labeling for most spectroscopic probes, may not be particularly sensitive to angular changes, and the portion of S1 adjacent to the rod might undergo more pronounced structural changes during hydrolysis (Huxley and Kress, 1985). We have therefore focused our efforts over the last few years on preparing Cys mutants of the regulatory light chain (RLC), a subunit which is readily exchanged into myosin, and can therefore provide a means to introduce probes into the COOH-terminal region of the myosin head (Saraswat and Lowey, 1991; Saraswat et al., 1992). Moreover, this approach avoids modification of the reactive heavy chain Cys residues, SH1 and SH2, which can have adverse effects on the enzymatic activity and motor properties of myosin (Root and Reisler, 1992). myosin subfragment-1 chicken skeletal myosin regulatory light chain or light chain 2 chicken skeletal myosin heavy chain N-iodoacetyl-N′-(5-sulfo-1-napthyl)ethylenediamine N-(4-dimethylamino-3,5-dinitrophenyl)maleimide dithiothreitol the dansyl moiety of 1,5-IAEDANS the dimethylamino-dinitrophenyl moiety of DDPM polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis resonance energy transfer 1,4-piperazinediethanesulfonic acid fast protein liquid chromatography.

Several earlier studies have used labeled light chains to detect structural changes in the myosin head. By incorporating a 1,5-IAEDANS-labeled RLC into smooth muscle myosin, Morita et al.(1991) were able to show by fluorescence anisotropy that a change in conformation at the head/rod junction can be correlated with the transition from a folded to an extended myosin molecule. Hambly et al.(1991) exchanged a spin-labeled light chain into skinned skeletal muscle fibers and showed, using electron paramagnetic resonance, that the region of the head/rod junction in thick filaments is ordered in rigor and disordered in relaxation. In a related study, chicken gizzard light chains were labeled with acetamido-tetramethyl-rhodamine and exchanged into skeletal muscle fibers for the determination of fluorescence polarization ratios, an approach that may reveal the orientation of the myosin head in contracting fibers (Allen et al., 1994). Fluorescence resonance energy transfer (RET) has been used to determine distances between sites that can readily be labeled, sites such as single Cys residues on the light chains, the active site in the myosin head, and the fast-reacting thiols on the heavy chain and actin (reviewed in dos Remedios et al.(1987)). The advent of genetic engineering has made it possible to introduce reactive residues at any position in the sequence, and one need only know the three-dimensional structure to determine which sites will be most informative for spectroscopic studies. The work described here was begun before the crystal structure of S1 was reported (Rayment et al., 1993) and, therefore, the selection of sites for labeling was influenced by the homology between RLC and calmodulin (reviewed in Katoh and Lowey(1989)). It was reasoned that probes widely spaced in the structure would offer the best opportunity for observing putative conformational changes in the neck region of S1 upon the binding of ligands (Saraswat and Lowey, 1991). Although such structural changes have yet to be found, we have shown the feasibility of this approach: the distance between Cys73 and Cys155 measured by RET in this study agrees remarkably well with the distance obtained from the crystal structure. Unexpectedly, Cys2 cannot be seen in the S1 crystal structure, since the first 18 amino acids of RLC are missing in the electron density map. The RET-determined distance between Cys2 and Cys155, therefore, offers the only means at present to predict the approximate location of the NH2 terminus of the RLC. Since the atomic coordinates of S1 are now available, it will be possible in future studies to select the most favorable sites for probing the orientation and conformation of the light chain region of the myosin molecule. Wild type chicken skeletal RLC contains two endogenous Cys residues at positions 126 and 155. By the selective removal of endogenous Cys residues and introduction of exogenous Cys residues we have prepared the following mutant RLCs: C2, C73, C155, C2/C155, and C73/C155, where the first three contain a single Cys at positions 2, 73 and 155, respectively, and the last two contain a pair of Cys residues at positions 2 and 155 and 73 and 155, respectively (Wolff-Long et al., 1993). Lyophilized purified RLCs were routinely dissolved in PBS (20 mM sodium phosphate, pH 7.2, 150 mM NaCl, 3 mM sodium azide), 6 M guanidine hydrochloride, 20 mM DTT, and incubated at room temperature for 1 h before dialysis into the desired buffer. RLCs were clarified at 100,000 × g for 30 min before use. Myosin was prepared from adult chicken muscle as described in Margossian and Lowey(1982). The protein concentrations were determined using a specific absorbance at 280 nm of 0.55 and 0.50 (mg/ml)-1 cm-1 for RLC and myosin, respectively. RLC and myosin were analyzed by SDS-PAGE (12.5%) following the protocol of Laemmli(1970). Urea-PAGE (8%) was performed according to Perrie and Perry(1970). Gels containing fluorescent samples were photographed as described in Saraswat and Lowey(1991). The single Cys mutants C2, C73 and C155 (2 mg/ml) were reacted overnight in PBS, 50 μM DTT, 0°C, with a 5-fold molar excess of 1,5-IAEDANS (Molecular Probes) over total thiols. The double Cys mutant C2/C155 (2 mg/ml) was reacted in the same buffer with a 2-4-fold molar excess of 1,5-IAEDANS for up to 30 min on ice. The optimal conditions were established by a trial reaction in which the concentration of labeling reagents and time were varied. After dialysis into 25 mM Tris, pH 7.5, 50 mM NaCl, 3 mM sodium azide, 0.5 mM DTT, the labeled C2/C155 was fractionated on a Mono Q ion-exchange column (0.6 mg RLC applied for a 1-ml bed volume) equilibrated in the same buffer. DAN-labeled C2/C155 (C2DAN/C155) was isolated using a gradient of 0.2-0.5 M NaCl. Alternatively, singly labeled RLC was isolated by the method described in Katoh and Lowey(1989). C2DAN/C155 was then reacted (0.5 mg/ml, in PBS, 50 μM DTT) with a 3-fold molar excess of DDPM (Aldrich) at room temperature for 3 h with constant agitation to produce C2DAN/C155β. To reverse the labeling, C2/C155 (4 mg/ml in PBS, 50 μM DTT) was first reacted with a 44-fold molar excess of DDPM for 30 min on ice. After removal of excess DDPM by dialysis, the labeled RLC was reacted with a 3-fold molar excess of 1,5-IAEDANS overnight on ice, yielding a mixture of fluorescent C2β/C155DAN and nonfluorescent C2β/C155β. C73/C155 (2 mg/ml) in DTT-PBS was reacted with a 2-3-fold molar excess of 1,5-IAEDANS for 420 min at room temperature and fractionated by Mono Q ion-exchange chromatography following the same protocol as described for C2/C155. The singly labeled species, [C73/C155]DAN, was then reacted with DDPM to produce [C73/C155]DAN/DDP. All reactions were performed in the dark and terminated by the addition of DTT to a final concentration of 50 mM. All of the DDPM-labeled proteins were clarified for 15 min in a microcentrifuge before dialysis. 1,5-IAEDANS (40 mM stock in 50 mM sodium phosphate, pH 7.8) and DDPM (40 mM stock in N,N-dimethylformamide) were freshly prepared and filtered before each reaction. The single Cys mutant, C155, was labeled to completion with either 1,5-IAEDANS or DDPM. Excess label was removed by exhaustive dialysis followed by passage through a 5-ml Sephadex G-25 column. The protein concentration was determined using the Bradford Assay (Bradford, 1976). Since the light chain was totally labeled, as shown by urea-PAGE, the concentration of label equaled that of the protein. The absorbance of 1,5-IAEDANS or DDPM bound to RLC was determined spectrophotometrically at 337 and 442 nm. The extinction coefficient determined for DAN at 337 nm was 6310 M-1 cm-1, similar to the value reported in Hudson and Weber(1973). 1,5-IAEDANS does not absorb at 442 nm and therefore does not interfere with optical density measurements at that wavelength. The extinction coefficient determined for DDP was 2930 M-1 cm-1 at 442 nm, in good agreement with the value reported by Gold and Segal(1964), and 3100 M-1 cm-1 at 337 nm. Using these extinction coefficients and the Bradford protein determination assay, the stoichiometry of labeling was determined for each of the singly and doubly labeled RLC mutants. Myosin (0.5 mg/ml) and labeled RLC (0.2 mg/ml), in 0.6 M NaCl, 20 mM sodium phosphate, pH 7.5, 3 mM sodium azide, 5 mM EDTA, 1 mM EGTA, 5 mM ATP, and 5 mM DTT were incubated at 40°C for 30 min. MgCl2 was added to 20 mM and incubation was continued for 90 min on ice. Myosin samples were precipitated by dialysis against 40 mM NaCl, 5 mM Pipes, pH 6.5, 5 mM MgCl2, 3 mM sodium azide, 1 mM DTT and pelleted in a Beckman TLA-100 centrifuge. Pellets were washed, respun, dissolved in 0.7 M NaCl, 20 mM sodium phosphate, pH 7.5, 3 mM sodium azide, 5 mM DTT and incubated on ice for 1 h. The reconstituted myosin was dialyzed into an appropriate buffer, and any aggregates were removed by centrifugation at 45,000 × g for 20 min at 4°C prior to fluorescence measurements. Fluorescence decay measurements were carried out on a modified ORTEC 920O nanosecond fluorimeter following the procedure described in Tao and Cho(1979). Briefly, the time profiles of the excitation source and of the fluorescence decay were collected from a Ludox colloidal silica suspension and from the labeled RLC samples, respectively. The curves were analyzed by the method-of-moments (Isenberg and Dyson, 1969) utilizing 1, 2, or 3 exponentials, from which the fluorescence lifetimes were obtained. Polarization anisotropy decay measurements were carried out as described in Tao(1978). Steady-state polarization ratios (Rp = I−/Imax) were obtained on a Perkin Elmer MPF-4 spectrofluorimeter. Endoproteinase Arg-C (Boehringer Mannheim, 10 units/mg RLC) or α-chymotrypsin (Boehringer Mannheim, 1 μg/mg RLC) was added to labeled and unlabeled RLC (0.5 mg/ml) in PBS containing 1 mM DTT on ice. Proteolytic degradation was followed by removing aliquots of the reaction mixture at various time intervals. TLCK (L-1-chloro-3-(4-tosylamido)-7-amino-2-heptanone, Boehringer Mannheim) or PMSF (phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride, Boehringer Mannheim) were then added to terminate enzymatic activity. This was performed essentially as described in Warshaw et al.(1990). Myosin free of all light chains was prepared as in Lowey et al.(1993). The heavy chain was reconstituted with purified alkali light chains and labeled or unlabeled recombinant RLCs. Unlike conventional RLC exchange at elevated temperatures, the procedure described above ensures that all myosin molecules contained a full complement of recombinant RLCs. From the time course of the reaction between the single Cys mutants C2, C73, and C155 and 1,5-IAEDANS, it is evident that Cys2 is more reactive than either Cys73 or Cys155 (Fig. 1). A fluorescent band was not observed until 5 min of incubation for C73 and C155, whereas C2 and C2/C155 showed fluorescence as early as 1 min. We took advantage of this preferential reactivity in the preparation of C2/C155 by selecting reaction conditions which favored complete labeling of Cys2 and minimal labeling of Cys155. The resultant mixture of singly and doubly labeled C2/C155 could be fractionated into two peaks by FPLC ion-exchange chromatography (Fig. 2A). Analysis of the labeled fractions by urea-PAGE showed that the first peak migrates at a lower mobility than the second peak (Fig. 2B).Figure 2:FPLC fractionation of 1,5-IAEDANS-labeled C2/C155. A, 1,5-IAEDANS-labeled C2/C155 was fractionated by ion-exchange FPLC into two peaks; the elution was monitored at a wavelength of 280 nm, at which 1,5-IAEDANS contributes significantly to the optical density. B, fractions in peak 1 (34 and 35) and in peak 2 (40 and 41) were analyzed by urea-PAGE (upper, Coomassie; lower, fluorescence), showing that the former contained singly and the latter doubly labeled C2/C155.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) A sample from each peak was cleaved with endoproteinase Arg-C, which cleaves in the highly basic region adjacent to Cys2, thereby producing a small amino-terminal peptide, and the larger carboxyl-terminal fragment containing Cys155. Comparison of the fluorescent cleavage pattern derived from labeled C2/C155 with that of Arg-C cleaved C2DAN and C155DAN indicates that peak 1 contained exclusively C2DAN/155 and peak 2 contained C2DAN/C155DAN (Fig. 3A). Partial chymotryptic digestions yielded the same conclusions (Fig. 3B). The DAN:RLC ratio was determined as 1.0 and 2.0 for the isolated C2DAN/C155 and C2DAN/C155DAN, respectively. C2DAN/C155 was subsequently reacted with an excess of DDPM, yielding C2DAN/C155β with a DDP:RLC ratio of 0.87. To reverse the donor/acceptor attachment sites in C2/C155, the protein was first reacted with an excess of DDPM, producing a species with a DDP:RLC ratio of 1.4. Since Cys2 is considerably more reactive than Cys155, we can reasonably conclude that all of Cys2, and 440% of Cys155 were modified in this species. The DDP-labeled C2/C155 was further reacted with an excess of 1,5-IAEDANS, yielding a species with a DAN:RLC ratio of 0.6. Although this species is designated as C2β/C155DAN, it is clear that it contains a mixture of C2β/C155DAN and C2β/C155β. This will not interfere with the energy transfer measurements, because the latter species is nonfluorescent and will not be detected in the fluorescence lifetime measurements. Reaction of the double Cys mutant, C73/C155, with an excess of 1,5-IAEDANS produced a mixture of species, which were fractionated into two peaks by FPLC, similar to the DAN-labeled C2/C155 mixture described above (data not shown). A sample of each peak was completely digested with chymotrypsin, as were C73DAN and C155DAN. Inspection of the fluorescent peptide patterns generated by urea-PAGE revealed that peak 1 contained a mixture of C73DAN/C155 and C73/C155DAN (Fig. 3C). A mixture of singly labeled species would be expected, based on the similarity in reactivities of Cys73 and Cys155 (see Fig. 1). Although peak 2, containing C73DAN/C155DAN, gave a similar chymotryptic digestion pattern compared with peak 1, the stoichiometry of labeling, DAN:RLC, was 2.0, compared with the value of 0.95 obtained for peak 1. The mixture of singly labeled species, designated as [C73/C155]DAN was subsequently reacted with the acceptor DDPM, yielding [C73/C155]DAN/DDP. The DDP:RLC ratio of this species was 41.2. Myosin reconstituted with labeled mutant RLCs (C2DAN, C73DAN, C155DAN and C2DAN/C155β) translocated actin filaments at approximately the same velocity as myosin reconstituted with wild type RLC (43 μm/s). Therefore, probes introduced into myosin by means of the mutant light chain do not affect the functional properties of this mechano-enzyme. It should be noted that for the motility assays, light chains were added to myosin heavy chains devoid of any endogenous light chains. This is in contrast to the fluorescence measurements, for which the labeled light chains were exchanged into native myosin at elevated temperatures (see “Materials and Methods”). Since the actin filaments are translocated by a large number of myosin molecules in the motility assay, it is important to have a homogeneous myosin population with regard to the light chain content. The fluorescence decay of free C2DAN/C155 was measured and found to be essentially mono-exponential; bi-exponential method-of-moments analysis yielded a major decay component with a fractional amplitude of 0.92 and a lifetime of 13.7 ns (Fig. 4A, Table 1). Similarly the fluorescence decay of free C2DAN/C155β has a major decay component of fractional amplitude 0.95 with a quenched lifetime of 11.3 ns owing to RET from the DAN donor to the DDP acceptor. Taking the major decay component lifetimes of C2DAN/C155 and C2DAN/C155β as τd and τda, the fluorescence lifetimes of the donor in the absence and presence of acceptor, respectively, a transfer efficiency of 17% was obtained (Table 2). Application of the Förster equation yielded an apparent separation distance of 35 Å (Table 2). It should be noted that this distance was obtained with the assumption that the orientation factor κ2 takes on the isotropically averaged value of 2/3.Tabled 1 Open table in a new tab Tabled 1 Open table in a new tab When bound to MHC the fluorescence lifetime of C2DAN/C155 increased from 13.7 to 15.5 ns, indicating that the environment surrounding Cys2 becomes more hydrophobic in the presence of heavy chain (Fig. 4B, Table 1). In spite of this increase in τd, the lifetime of MHC-bound C2DAN/C155β was quenched to 9.4 ns, 42 ns shorter than the lifetime of free C2DAN/C155β, indicating a small increase in interprobe energy transfer upon binding to MHC. Correspondingly, the calculated transfer efficiency increased from 17 to 39%, and the separation distance decreased from 35 to 30 Å for free versus MHC-bound C2DAN/C155β (Table 2). A repetition of these measurements using a different preparation of light chains yielded distances of 34 and 30 Å for free and MHC-bound light chains, respectively (Table 2). Experiments performed to measure this distance for MHC-bound C2DAN/C155β in the presence of 5 or 10 mM ATP yielded distances of 431 Å for the two preparations of light chains. Measurements of this distance in the presence of equimolar actin (absence of ATP) likewise yielded values (30-31 Å), that are indistinguishable from those for unbound myosin (Table 2). Owing to the low reactivity of Cys155 relative to Cys2, it was not possible to prepare and isolate C2/C155DAN. Instead, the fluorescence characteristics of the DAN moiety attached at Cys155 were determined using the labeled single Cys mutant C155DAN. The fluorescence decay characteristics of free and MHC-bound C155DAN and C2β/C155DAN are qualitatively very similar to those of free and bound C2DAN/C155 and C2DAN/C155β. Quantitatively, the major component lifetimes of free C155DAN and C155DAN/C2β are, respectively, 16.2 and 10.1 ns (Table 1), yielding a transfer efficiency of 38% and a separation distance of 30 Å (Table 2). The major component lifetime of C155DAN increased from 16.2 to 18.8 ns while that of C2β/C155DAN decreased from 10.1 to 8.4 ns upon binding to MHC. The transfer efficiency and interprobe distance for MHC-bound C2β/C155DAN were calculated from these lifetimes to be 55% and 27 Å, respectively. These results show that the RET-measured distance between residues 2 and 155 does not vary significantly when the donor-acceptor locations are switched. In both cases, a small decrease in this distance was observed upon binding of the RLC to MHC. An experiment performed to measure the distance between Cys155 and Cys2 in MHC-bound C2β/C155DAN in the presence of actin yielded a value of 28 Å (data not shown), a value that is virtually identical to that obtained in the absence of actin. In spite of the fact that the location of the DAN-donor is randomly distributed between residues 73 and 155 in [C73/155]DAN, its fluorescence decay is mono-exponential with a lifetime of 16.9 ns (Table 1), indicating that the environments around each of the residues, 73 and 155, in free RLC is similar. The distance between the two residues can be estimated by assuming that the interprobe distance and the energy transfer efficiency is invariant with donor-acceptor location. The fluorescence decay of free [C73/C155]DAN/DDP is nearly mono-exponential, with a major component fractional amplitude of 0.91 and a lifetime of 11.2 ns. There is no indication of the presence of additional quenched components that might correspond to heterogeneous transfer rates arising from the two donor-acceptor locations. Taking 16.9 and 11.2 ns as τd and τda, respectively, a transfer efficiency of 34% and a separation distance of 31 Å were obtained from these lifetimes (Table 2). The fluorescence lifetime of [C73/C155]DAN increased from 16.9 to 18.7 ns upon binding to MHC, indicating a decrease in polarity around these sites (Table 1). The fluorescence decay of MHC-bound [C73/C155]DAN/DDP is also nearly mono-exponential with a major component lifetime of 10.6 ns (Table 1). Taking 18.7 and 10.6 ns as τd and τda, respectively, a transfer efficiency of 43% and a separation distance of 30 Å were obtained (Table 2), representing a neglible difference in the distance for free versus MHC-bound light chain. Measurements were again made in the presence of 5 and 10 mM ATP, and in the presence of actin, yielding values (29-30 Å) that are undistinguishable within experimental error to those for ligand-free myosin (Table 2). The fluorescence polarization anisotropy of free C2DAN/C155 decays rapidly (Fig. 5) with a rotational correlation time of 45 ns, consistent with the relatively small molecular volume of RLC. In the presence of MHC the anisotropy decay of C2DAN/C155 contains primarily a nondecaying component, consistent with the fact that the majority of the RLCs are bound to MHC with a rotational relaxation time that is too long to be measured. Similar anisotropy decay behavior was observed for all the DAN-labeled RLCs used in this work, including those that are also labeled with the DDP acceptor. The zero time anisotropy, Ao, of free and MHC-bound C2DAN/C155 are similar, with a value of 40.22 (Table 3). The steady-state polarization ratio of C2DAN/C155 increased from a relatively low value of 1.13 to 1.44 upon binding to MHC (Table 3), again consistent with the majority of the labeled RLC being bound to MHC. The polarization ratio and zero time anisotropy values for free and MHC-bound C155DAN and [C73/C155]DAN were also measured and shown in Table 3. As for C2DAN/C155, the polarization ratio increased but Ao was invariant with binding to MHC.Tabled 1 Open table in a new tab The aim of this study was to determine if a structural change can occur in the vicinity of the head/rod junction of myosin. The relative ease with which the RLC is exchanged into myosin provides a simple means to introduce spectroscopic probes into the neck region of S1, irrespective of whether the exchange is into isolated molecules, or single fibers. We reasoned that any underlying structural change in the neck region might be reflected by a change in the distance between the probes of the bound light chain. Until recently, the only pair of Cys residues available for spectroscopic labeling in vertebrate myosin light chains was Cys126 and Cys155, both in the COOH-terminal domain of RLC. Cross-linking studies have shown that these residues are in sufficiently close proximity to form a disulfide bond in the free light chain (Huber et al., 1989; Katoh and Lowey, 1989). The Cys at position 126 can be selectively labeled due to its greater reactivity relative to Cys155 (Katoh and Lowey, 1989; Saraswat et al., 1992). Taking advantage of this differential reactivity, Boey et al.(1994) were able to incorporate spectroscopic probes into the RLC and confirm the proximity of the Cys residues by RET. When this study was begun, the crystal structure of S1 was not available, and our choice of sites for labeling was guided by the known crystal structure of calmodulin (Babu et al., 1985; Kretsinger et al., 1986). In the crystal structure, the distance between residue 3 near the NH2 terminus and residue 146 near the COOH terminus is 37 Å (Persechini and Kretsinger, 1988), a spacing that is more favorable for detection of distance changes by RET than the smaller spacing between the endogenous RLC Cys residues. For this reason we engineered Cys residues at positions 2 or 73 in the NH2-terminal domain, while the endogenous Cys at position 155 near the COOH-terminus was retained as the second member of each pair. In the case of C2/C155, the higher reactivity of Cys2 relative to Cys155 allowed us to selectively label Cys2 with either the donor or the acceptor. That selective labeling was achieved was clearly demonstrated by the labeling stoichiometries and by the proteolytic digestion patterns of the labeled RLC. Owing to the similarity in their reactivities, selective labeling of Cys73 or Cys155 in C73/C155 was not achievable, and the digestion patterns show that the probes were randomly distributed between the two Cys residues. This did not hamper the distance determination for the following reasons. 1) The fluorescence decay of [C73/C155]DAN is mono-exponential, evidently owing to the similarity in environment between the Cys residues. This allowed us to take the lifetime of [C73/C155]DAN as τd, the unquenched lifetime. 2) We had reasonably assumed that the transfer efficiency is invariant with locations of the the donor-acceptor pair, so that the major component lifetime of [C73/C155]DAN/DDP can be taken as τda, from which the transfer efficiency and separation distance can readily be obtained. Calculation of distances from RET measurements usually assumes that the orientation factor, κ2, takes on the isotropically averaged value of 2/3. The validity of this assumption has been discussed in detail by various authors (Stryer, 1978; dos Remedios et al., 1987; Chantler and Tao, 1986). Here we used several approaches to address this issue. First, measurements of the limiting anisotropy, Ao of DAN-labeled free and bound light chains gives rise to values (0.14-0.22, Table 3) that are considerably smaller than the maximum value of 0.4, indicating considerable randomization of the probe's transition moment orientation. From the Ao values in Table 3, the axial depolarization factors and the limits for R could be calculated. Using Stryer's formalism (Stryer, 1978), which does not take into account the rotation of the acceptor, the uncertainty limits for R are 23-31%. Using Dale and Eisinger's formalism as described in Torgerson and Morales(1984), and using the DAN depolarization factors as an approximation of the acceptor depolarization factors, the uncertainty limits are 15-26%. Second, similar distances were obtained when the locations of the donor and acceptor probes were switched on C2/C155. It is highly unlikely that the distance would remain unchanged if the transition moments of the probes were fixed. Finally, the same conclusion could be reached for C73/C155; here energy transfer is measured in both directions in a single experiment owing to the random distribution of the donor/acceptor sites. There was no indication of additional decay components which would arise if heterogeneity existed in transfer efficiency. All of these observations validate the use of an isotropic model for κ2. If these mutant light chains are to be useful for the incorporation of probes into myosin molecules in solution and in fibers, it is important to establish whether the mutations and the probes affect the functional properties of myosin. Chemical modification of the reactive SH1 thiol of the heavy chain has been shown to inhibit the actin-activated ATPase activity of myosin and impair the sliding velocity of actin in the in vitro motility assay (Root and Reisler, 1992). It was shown previously that RLC reacted with fluorescein on its endogenous Cys residues did not inhibit the Ca2+- or K+/EDTA-activated ATPase of myosin (Katoh and Lowey, 1989). However, the ATPase activity of skeletal muscle myosin is not particularly sensitive to the presence or absence of RLC, and a more stringent test is to determine the effect of light chain modification on actin sliding velocity in the motility assay (Lowey et al., 1993). As our results show, neither mutagenesis nor labeling of the Cys residues affected the motility compared with wild type RLC. By these criteria, light chains are well suited for the purpose of introducing reporter groups into myosin. For free RLC our results indicate that the distance measured by RET between residues 2 in the NH2-terminal segment and residue 155 in the H-helix is about 35 Å. For comparison the α-carbon-to-α-carbon distance between residues 3 in the NH2-terminal segment and residue 146 in the H-helix of free calmodulin is 37 Å (Persechini and Kretsinger, 1988). Although these residues are not at equivalent locations, and one must consider the substantial (420%) amount of error in RET-determined distances, the similarity in these two distances suggests that the disposition of the the NH2- and COOH-terminal residues in these two proteins are similar and that like free calmodulin, free RLC is likely to adopt a relatively extended conformation. This is also consistent with conclusions drawn from earlier physical studies (Stafford and Szent-Györgyi, 1978; Alexis and Gratzer, 1978). It has been found that when calmodulin binds a peptide analog derived from one of its substrates, myosin light chain kinase, its two domains are brought into close proximity to each other (Ikura et al., 1992; Meador et al. 1992). The distance between residues 3 and 146, e.g. decreases from 37 to 25 Å for the free versus bound states. We found, however, that the RET-measured distance between residues 2 and 155 decreases by only 45 Å from 35 Å for free versus 30 Å for MHC-bound RLC (Table 2), indicating that unlike calmodulin, RLC remains relatively extended (although not necessary with the same conformation) when it binds to MHC. The recently determined crystal structures directly verified that the conformation of MHC-bound RLC is extended (Rayment et al., 1993; Xie et al., 1994). It is noteworthy that when these distances were remeasured using a different preparation of labeled recombinant light chain, we obtained values of 34 and 30 Å for free versus MHC-bound RLC. This indicates that owing to such favorable conditions as the ability of specific labeling and mono-exponential donor decay in the absence of acceptor, the reproducibility of our measurements is within 41 Å. The distance between residues 73 and 155 decreased negligibly from 31 to 30 Å for free versus MHC-bound RLC. The latter value can be compared with the distances between the corresponding residues in the crystal structures of myosin fragments. They are 33.6 Å in chicken skeletal S1 (Rayment et al., 1993) and 33.4 Å in the regulatory domain of scallop myosin (Xie et al., 1994), taking Pro64 and Thr145 as equivalent residues in scallop myosin RLC. The good agreement between the value from the solution measurements and the crystal structures enhances our confidence in the reliability of RET for distance determinations, as was indicated by a comparison of RET distances in actin with the crystal structure (Miki et al., 1992). The distance between Cys2 and Cys155 cannot be compared with the crystal structure, because the first 19 residues of RLC are not visible in the electron density map for chicken S1 (Rayment et al., 1993), and there is no comparable sequence in scallop RLC. The distance of 30 Å determined by the RET measurements is therefore of particular interest insofar as it permits one to speculate about the approximate location of the amino terminus of RLC. From the crystal structures it could be deduced that the distance between Phe20 at the beginning of the A-helix and Cys155 near the center of the H-helix is only 20 Å. That the RET-determined distance between Cys2 and Cys155 is 10 Å longer indicates that the NH2-terminal segment of RLC extends away from the COOH-terminal domain back toward some region of the NH2-terminal domain, possibly in the vicinity of the linker region that connects the NH2- and COOH-terminal lobes of RLC. We found no detectable change in the distance between Cys2 and Cys155 for MHC-bound C2/C155 when saturating nucleotides were present. This was qualitatively obvious from the decay curves, which were identical before and after the addition of ATP. Quantitatively, duplicated measurements on two separate preparations yielded values that differed from each other and from that in the absence of ATP by no more than 1 Å, the estimated precision of these measurements. Likewise, we found no change in the distance between Cys2 and Cys155 of RLC when the myosin was bound to actin. Entirely similar results were obtained for the distance between Cys73 and Cys155 in C73/C155: no change was detected within an estimated uncertainty of 41 Å. These results indicate that if there are significant conformational changes in this region of myosin during the contraction cycle, these changes are not reflected in the gross conformation of RLC. The absence of structural changes in RLC with ATP and actin validates the use of RLC to introduce probes into muscle fibers for monitoring the orientation of the head during contraction. The results presented here show that it is possible to incorporate spectroscopic probes into myosin by introducing Cys residues into the RLC by site-directed mutagenesis. These modifications do not appear to affect the functional properties of myosin, an essential prerequisite for structural studies involving spectroscopic probes. Now that the crystal structures of S1 and the regulatory domain are available (Rayment et al., 1993; Xie et al., 1994), it will be possible to ask more directed questions by constructing specific sites within the RLC, as well as between the ELC and the RLC. For example, we now know that Cys126 is located at the interface of the RLC and the ELC; by engineering a Cys into an appropriate position on the ELC, it may be possible to detect a relative movement between the light chains upon ATP hydrolysis. It was previously shown that a probe bound to the endogenous COOH-terminal Cys of the ELC changed its fluorescence signal in parallel to the rate of myosin ATP hydrolysis (Marsh and Lowey, 1980; Marsh et al., 1982). This result is highly suggestive of a relative movement of the light chains within the neck region of myosin. Although the RET technique can only give low resolution structural information, it may be able to detect small changes in intra and interlight chain distances occurring during the contractile cycle and thereby yield valuable biological insights into the mechanism of regulation."

https://openalex.org/W2024751417,"Recently, a cyclic peptide ligand, cyclo-Ac-[CHPQGPPC]-NH2, that binds to streptavidin with high affinity was discovered by screening phage libraries. From the streptavidin-bound crystal structures of cyclo-Ac-[CHPQGPPC]-NH2 and of a related but more weakly binding linear ligand, FSHPQNT, we designed linear thiol-containing streptavidin binding ligands, FCHPQNT-NH2 and Ac-CHPQNT-NH2, which are dimerized catalytically by the streptavidin crystal lattice of space group I222, as demonstrated by high performance liquid chromatography and mass spectrometry. The catalytic dimerization relies on presentation of the ligand thiols toward one another in the lattice. The streptavidin crystal lattice-mediated catalysis achieved by structure-based design is the first example of catalysis of a chemical reaction by a protein crystal lattice. The spontaneous and crystal catalyzed rates of disulfide formation were determined by high performance liquid chromatography at pH 3.1, 4.0, 5.0, and 6.0. The ratio of the catalyzed to uncatalyzed rate was maximal at pH 3.1 (kcat/kuncat = 3.8), diminishing to 1.2 at pH 6.0. The crystal structures of the streptavidin-bound dimerized peptide ligands, FCHPQNT-NH2 dimer at 1.95 Å and Ac-CHPQNT-NH2 dimer at 1.80 Å, are described and compared with the structures of streptavidin-bound FSHPQNT monomer and cyclo-Ac-[CHPQGPPC]-NH2 dimer.

Dimerization is a trigger for many important biological processes(1.Heldin C.-H. Cell. 1995; 80: 213-223Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1428) Google Scholar, 2.Austin D.J Crabtree G.R.

Recently we described a structure-based design strategy for the preparation of ligands that dimerize receptors by topochemistry(5.Katz B.A. Stroud R.M. Liu B. Arze R. Collins N. Chemistry & Biology. 1995; 2: 591-600Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar), which involves a chemical reaction mediated by holding reactants in close proximity and in productive orientations on a protein or crystal scaffold. The strategy for preparation by topochemistry of receptor dimerizing molecules is as follows. First, a protein ligand for a receptor monomer is developed by structure-based design or discovered by screening. The three-dimensional structure of the protein-ligand complex is then determined by crystallography. Ligating groups of the appropriate length and orientation are then introduced at sites in the ligand in a region distinct from the binding motif. Dimerization of two such ligands, each bound on a receptor monomer of a native receptor dimer complex, is directed by the receptor monomers, which present the reactive ligating groups of the ligands next to one another. A ligand dimer capable of dimerizing the receptor to produce a native or native-like receptor dimer is thus prepared by topochemistry. This strategy for preparing a receptor-dimerizing ligand was demonstrated (5.Katz B.A. Stroud R.M. Liu B. Arze R. Collins N. Chemistry & Biology. 1995; 2: 591-600Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar) with streptavidin using a high affinity cyclic peptide ligand, cyclo-Ac-[CHPQGPPC]-NH2, with a Kd of 670 nM at pH 7.3, discovered by screening phage libraries against the streptavidin target (36.Giebel, L. B., Cass, R. T., Milligan, D., Young, D., Arze, R., Johnson, C. (1995) Biochemistry, in pressGoogle Scholar). Streptavidin, a tetrameric protein with a molecular mass of 13,200 Da/subunit produced by Streptomyces avidinii, functions as an antibiotic by binding the vitamin biotin with the highest affinity known for a noncovalent protein-ligand interaction, Kd∼10-15M(6.Green N.M.

In streptavidin, there are four binding sites, one per subunit. In I222 crystals of streptavidin, one crystallographically equivalent pair, site 1 and site 1′, is near a crystallographic 2-fold axis; the other pair, site 2 and site 2′, is not. When bound to I222 crystals of streptavidin, the intramolecular disulfide bonds of neighboring cyclo-Ac-[CHPQGPPC]-NH2 monomers bound at site 1, presented next to one another, undergo disulfide interchange. Thus a C2-symmetric peptide dimer adopting the symmetry of the crystal is produced with two intermolecular disulfide bonds passing through the 2-fold axis. A double-headed streptavidin dimerizing agent is thereby prepared by topochemistry. Concomitant with peptide dimerization is the dimerization of the associated bound streptavidin tetramers. We determined the crystal structure of the protein-peptide dimer complex and demonstrated by HPLC ( (1)The abbreviations used are: HPLChigh performance liquid chromatographyFo and Fcobserved and calculated structure factors, respectively.) and mass spectrometry that streptavidin crystals of space group I222 mediate the dimerization(5.Katz B.A. Stroud R.M. Liu B. Arze R. Collins N. Chemistry & Biology. 1995; 2: 591-600Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). high performance liquid chromatography observed and calculated structure factors, respectively. Although I222 streptavidin crystals mediate the disulfide interchange reaction between neighboring bound cyclo-Ac-[CHPQGPPC]-NH2 ligands, they do not catalyze it. The Kd of the product dimer for the two adjacent 2-fold related sites in the I222 streptavidin crystals is ∼5 × 10-9M, on the order of the square of the dimer for a single site, 7.0 × 10-5M. This high affinity may impede product release and associated catalytic turnover(5.Katz B.A. Stroud R.M. Liu B. Arze R. Collins N. Chemistry & Biology. 1995; 2: 591-600Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). Catalysis of a chemical reaction by a protein crystal lattice has never before been demonstrated. We reasoned, however, that catalysis could occur for a similar reaction involving a lower affinity, linear peptide whose dimerized product binds weakly enough at the two 2-fold related binding sites in the crystal to allow dissociation and catalytic turnover. Because the measured affinity of the linear peptide FSHPQNT, whose Kd is 64 μM, is several hundred-fold lower than that of the cyclo-Ac-[CHPQGPPC]-NH2 monomer(36.Giebel, L. B., Cass, R. T., Milligan, D., Young, D., Arze, R., Johnson, C. (1995) Biochemistry, in pressGoogle Scholar), we wondered whether linear cysteine-containing peptide analogs of FSHPQNT or of cyclo-Ac-[CHPQGPPC]-NH2 bound to I222 streptavidin crystals with thiols presented toward one another might be catalytically dimerized. Demonstrated catalysis of a reaction mediated by a protein crystal lattice is a step toward the eventual engineering of such lattices to catalyze diverse chemical reactions. The potential advantages of protein crystals in preparative synthesis, high specific activity, and resistance to inactivation by elevated temperatures and proteolysis have been recognized and demonstrated in the synthesis of peptides with glutaraldehyde cross-linked thermolysin crystals(16.Persichetti R.A. St. Clair N.L. Griffith J.P. Navia M.A. Margolin A.L. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1995; 117: 2732-2737Crossref Scopus (123) Google Scholar). The design of the thiol-containing ligands, FCHPQNT-NH2 and Ac-CHPQNT-NH2, for catalytic dimerization was based on the following observations. In the crystal structure of streptavidin-FSHPQNT, the serines of 2-fold related bound peptides are in close proximity; the hydroxyls can be rotated such that the Oγ-Oγ distance is 5 Å. Thus we expected that in streptavidin-FCHPQNT-NH2, close proximity of 2-fold related cysteines would mediate disulfide formation. Also, because the N-terminal portion of the Ac-CHPQNT-NH2 sequence is identical to that in cyclo-Ac-[CHPQGPPC]-NH2, which dimerizes in the crystal by disulfide interchange, we predicted that streptavidin-bound Ac-CHPQNT-NH2 would also dimerize in the crystal. The structure of the streptavidin-Ac-CHPQNT-NH2 dimer complex in the vicinity of the N-terminal peptide sequence was expected to be similar to that in the streptavidin-cyclo-Ac-[CHPQGPPC]-NH2 dimer complex. The crystal lattice catalyzed dimerization of FCHPQNT-NH2 and of Ac-CHPQNT-NH2, described herein, is depicted schematically in Fig. 1. The peptide ligands, FCHPQNT-NH2, Ac-CHPQNT-NH2, and FSHPQNT, were synthesized with Nα-Fmoc (9-fluorenylmethoxycarbonyl)-protected1 amino acids with acid-labile side chain protecting groups and with acetamidomethyl protected cysteines as described(5.Katz B.A. Stroud R.M.

Between injections of reagents, the sensor chip was continuously washed with running buffer composed of 10 mM HEPES, pH 7.3, 150 mM NaCl, 3.4 mM EDTA, and 0.005% surfactant P20. The surface was activated by a 2-min pulse of a mixture containing 0.050 MN-hydroxysuccinimide and 0.20 MN-ethyl-N′-(−3-diethylaminopropyl)-carbodiimide. The cyclo-Ac-AE[CHPQGPPC]IEGRK-NH2 peptide solution at a concentration of 0.1 mM in 0.1 M sodium borate, pH 8.5, was then injected for 2 min followed by a 7.0-min injection of 1.0 M ethanolamine HCl to inactivate any remaining N-hydroxysuccinimide ester groups. In order to wash out any noncovalently bound peptide, the immobilization concluded with a 2-min pulse of 6.0 M guanidine HCl, pH 2.1. The competition assay involved preincubation of streptavidin at a concentration of 167 nM with increasing concentrations (from 0 to 7.5 mM) of each of the different peptide ligands. Each streptavidin-peptide ligand solution was injected over the immobilized peptide surface, as well as over a blank surface identical except lacking the immobilized peptide, in the running buffer, at a flow rate of 10.0 μl/min for 4.0 min. After subtracting the nonspecific response for the blank surface from the specific signal of the immobilized peptide surface, the resulting streptavidin binding response was plotted as a function of the competing peptide concentration to produce the inhibition curves shown in Fig. 2. In order to regenerate the peptide surface before assay of each peptide concentration, 6.0 M guanidine HCl, pH 2.1, was injected to dissociate remaining bound streptavidin. Because the concentration of the cyclo-Ac-AE[CHPQGPPC]IEGRK-NH2 peptide immobilized on the sensor chip is high (∼30 μM), the IC50 value for each peptide does not reflect the true equilibrium dissociation constant (Kd). Calculation of the true Kd values of the peptide ligands relied on determining the relationship between the apparent Kd or IC50 in this study and the true Kd, determined previously(36.Giebel, L. B., Cass, R. T., Milligan, D., Young, D., Arze, R., Johnson, C. (1995) Biochemistry, in pressGoogle Scholar), for cyclo-Ac-AE[CHPQGPPC]IEGRK-NH2 and applying the appropriate correction factor to the IC50 values for all the peptide ligands in this study. Thus, for this purpose, the IC50 for competition of the unbound cyclo-Ac-AE[CHPQGPPC]IEGRK-NH2 peptide ligand in solution with sensor-bound cyclo-Ac-AE[CHPQGPPC]IEGRK-NH2 was determined in this study. Similar protocols for determining true Kd values from the results of competition assays involving high concentrations of ligands immobilized on the sensor chip have been described(22.Felder S.

Pawson T. Walsh C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 4902-4906Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). The crystal-catalyzed dimerization of FCHPQNT-NH2 and of Ac-CHPQNT-NH2 was investigated by HPLC or by HPLC coupled to mass spectrometry by procedures previously described for the crystal-induced dimerization of cyclo-Ac-[CHPQGPPC]-NH2(5.Katz B.A. Stroud R.M. Liu B. Arze R. Collins N. Chemistry & Biology. 1995; 2: 591-600Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). A Hewlett-Packard 1090 analytical HPLC instrument containing a C18 reverse phase column was used with a linear gradient from 0.05% trifluoroacetic acid in water to 0.05% trifluoroacetic acid in 50% water/50% acetonitrile over a 15-min time period. The fraction dimerized was calculated by dividing the integrated area of the dimer peak by the sum of the integrated areas of the monomer and dimer peaks. HPLC with a Michrom BioResources Ultrafast Microprotein Analyzer coupled to electrospray ionization mass spectrometry with a Finnigan MAT SSQ710 instrument was also performed on selected samples. Rates of disulfide formation were determined at pH 3.1, 4.0, 5.0, and 6.0 in the presence and the absence of finely crushed I222 diamond plate streptavidin crystals. Initial rates were based on initial slopes of the amount of dimeric peptide versus time, calculated with all initial time points where the formation of peptide dimer could be approximated as a linear function of time. We also investigated the effect of noncrystalline streptavidin or of crushed streptavidin crystals of a tetragonal crystal form. The tetragonal form, with square plate morphology and space group I4122 (37.Katz, B. A. 1995 Biochemistry, in pressGoogle Scholar) can be crystallized under similar conditions as the orthorhombic I222 form; under some conditions both forms grow in the same set-up. After completion of a study at one pH, the same batches of crystals were used for a study at a different pH. Such crystals were harvested and reused by washing and soaking out any bound peptide in 1 ml of 50% saturated ammonium sulfate/50% 100 mM potassium acetate, pH 3.1, where the affinity is low, for several hours in a 1.5-ml microcentrifuge tube. After centrifugation of the washed crystals, the supernatant was removed, and fresh washing solution was added. After vortexing, the crystals were left soaking for several more hours. The washing procedure was done a total of three times before reusing the crystals. Because the same batch of crystals of a particular form was used for each pH study, the amount and surface area of the crystals should be the same, and differences in rates should reflect differences in pH only. At pH 5.0, two determinations of the crystal catalyzed rate of disulfide formation were performed, one with recycled crystals and one with fresh crystals. No large differences were observed between these two determinations. Crystals of the streptavidin peptide dimer complexes were prepared by soaking large diamond plate apostreptavidin crystals grown from ammonium sulfate solution at pH 4.0 (24.Pähler A. Hendrickson W.A. Kolks M.A.G. Argaraña C.E. Cantor C.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 13933-13937Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) for several days in synthetic mother liquor composed of 50% saturated ammonium sulfate, 50% 1.0 M Tris, pH 7.0 at a peptide monomer concentration of 10.0 mM in the presence of 20.0 mM K3Fe(CN)6 to promote disulfide formation. X-ray diffraction from single crystals of streptavidin peptide dimer complexes were collected on a Siemens IPC area detector coupled to a Siemens three-circle goniometer mounted on a Rigaku rotating copper anode target tube operating at 50 kV, 60 mA. Data were indexed and reduced to produce integrated intensities and structure factors with the programs Sadie and Saint supplied by Siemens. The following settings were used: crystal to detector distance, 9.0 cm; 2θ, −25.0°; oscillation widths in ω, 0.090°; exposure time per frame, 250 s. Three sweeps of 90-110° in ω at ψ values of 0.0, 90.0, and 45.0° were collected. Models of streptavidin with bound ligands were manually built and visualized by computer graphics using Quanta (licensed from Molecular Simulations, Burlington, MA) from the structure of streptavidin-FSHPQNT (37.Katz, B. A. 1995 Biochemistry, in pressGoogle Scholar) or of streptavidin-cyclo-Ac-[CHPQGPPC]-NH2 dimer(5.Katz B.A. Stroud R.M. Liu B. Arze R. Collins N. Chemistry & Biology. 1995; 2: 591-600Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). Models were based on initial electron density maps calculated with coefficients (σFoσ-σFcσ) or (2σFoσ-σFcσ) and phases (αc) after refinement to convergence of structures where the ligand Cys or Phe-Cys residues were omitted from the refinement and map calculations. The structures of streptavidin-Ac-CHPQNT-NH2 dimer and of streptavidin-FCHPQNT-NH2 dimer were refined to 1.80 and 1.95 Å, respectively, with X-PLOR (25.Brünger A.T. X-PLOR version 3.1: A system for x-ray crystallography and NMR. Yale University Press, New Haven, CT1992: 187-206Google Scholar) ( (2)Because the program X-PLOR does not allow a bond between symmetry-related atoms, the van der Waals radii of the 2-fold related sulfurs in the disulfides were decreased to zero. In such refinements there is no constraint on the S-S bond length or any other disulfide parameters involving atoms from both monomers (such as χ3, the dihedral about the S-S bond).) and with difference Fourier methods(26.Chambers J.L. Stroud R.M. Acta Crystallogr. Sec. B. 1979; 33: 1861-1874Crossref Google Scholar). In (σFoσ - σFcσ), αc maps, positive and negative peaks whose magnitudes were greater than 2.8 σwere systematically identified and analyzed using a peak picking program written in house. Water structure was determined and refined. New waters were identified based on density peaks greater than 2.8 σin (σFoσ - σFcσ), αc maps that coincided with density in (2σFoσ - σFcσ), αc maps at stereochemically reasonable locations(27.Finer-Moore J.S. Kossiakoff A.A. Hurley J.H. Earnest T. Stroud R.M. Proteins. 1992; 12: 203-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Waters were generally rejected if their temperature factors exceeded 60 Å2 after refinement. Data collection and refinement statistics are given in Table 1. The structures have been deposited into the Brookhaven Data Bank.Tabled 1 Open table in a new tab For structural comparisons involving global changes, due in part to changes in packing, the coordinates of nonhydrogen atoms of 46 well determined residues, 29-31, 38-39, 54-57, 73-79, 86-97, 104-114, and 124-130, whose temperature factors are in general less than 20 Å2, were used. For comparisons involving more local changes at the ligand binding sites, the coordinates of nonhydrogen atoms of residues showing the largest structural plasticity in a previous study, ( (3)B. A. Katz, unpublished observations.) 22-25, 43, 118-121, and 128, were used. Fig. 2 shows the inhibition curves for the competition of streptavidin between a high affinity cyclic peptide, cyclo-Ac-AE[CHPQGPPC]IEGRK-NH2(36.Giebel, L. B., Cass, R. T., Milligan, D., Young, D., Arze, R., Johnson, C. (1995) Biochemistry, in pressGoogle Scholar), immobilized on the sensor chip and peptide ligands incubated at concentrations from 0 to 5 mM with streptavidin at a concentration of 167 nM in 100 mM HEPES, pH 7.3, in the solution flowing over the chip. The Kd for the FCHPQNT-NH2 monomer is 10 μM; for the Ac-CHPQNT-NH2 monomer and dimer produced by incubation in K3Fe(CN)6, the Kd values are 17 and 71 μM, respectively. For FSHPQNT the Kd, 46 μM, is comparable to that determined by microcalorimetry, 125 μM(28.Weber P.C. Pantoliano M.W. Thompson L.D. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 9350-9354Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). The affinity for streptavidin of HPQ-containing peptides decrease as the pH decreases from neutral to acidic pH (28.Weber P.C. Pantoliano M.W. Thompson L.D. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 9350-9354Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). ( (4)B. A. Katz and R. T. Cass, unpublished observations.) Thus an expected decrease in affinity at low pH for the thiol-containing peptide ligands is expected to facilitate dissociation and permit catalytic turnover at low pH. Freshly dissolved FCHPQNT-NH2 is predominantly monomeric (Fig. 3A), and treatment of the peptide with K3FeCN6 to promote disulfide formation results in complete dimerization, yielding a peak of greater retention time (Fig. 3B). Incubation at pH 4.0 of the FCHPQNT-NH2 monomer for 3 days in the presence of crushed I222 streptavidin crystals induces an increase in the dimer peak along with a concomitant decrease in the monomer peak (Fig. 3C). Incubation of the peptide monomer alone (Fig. 3D) or in the presence of noncrystalline streptavidin (Fig. 3E) under the same conditions yields significantly less dimer. Thus the I222 streptavidin crystals accelerate disulfide formation. In Fig. 3F peptide monomer at a molar ratio of at least 21-fold with respect to crystalline streptavidin subunits was 87% dimerized after 6 days, showing that catalytic turnover occurs in I222 crystals, which act as a heterogeneous catalyst for the disulfide formation reaction. A similar catalytic effect was observed for Ac-CHPQNT-NH2 (data not shown). Often we observed a significant enhancement in the rate of disulfide formation in the presence of streptavidin that was initially noncrystalline. Examination of these samples under the microscope revealed microcrystals. The enhancement was found to be concomitant with microcrystal formation. A similar phenomenon has been observed in the crystal lattice mediation of disulfide interchange in streptavidin-bound cyclo-Ac-[CHPQGPPC]-NH2(5.Katz B.A. Stroud R.M. Liu B. Arze R. Collins N. Chemistry & Biology. 1995; 2: 591-600Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). The microcrystals enhancing the rate of disulfide formation in this study were shown to be I222 diamond plates. ( (5)To establish the crystal form of these microcrystals in the incubation samples, they were used to seed eight streptavidin crystallization drops, all set-up under the condition to produce I222 diamond plates. Six of the eight drops seeded with these microcrystals yielded showers of small diamond plates before ten unseeded set-ups had crystallized (all 10 unseeded drops eventually yielded large diamond plates). Two drops seeded with diamond plates that were used in the incubations behaved similarly to the other seeded drops.) No rate enhancement by the I4122 tetragonal crystals was observed. In Fig. 4 the fraction of dimer is plotted as a function of time for the incubation of 4.05 × 10-7 mol of FCHPQNT-NH2 in the presence of buffer alone or in the presence of 0.19 × 10-7 mol I222 crystalline streptavidin subunits at pH 3.1, 4.0, 5.0, and 6.0. The uncatalyzed and catalyzed initial rates, as well as the ratio of the rates for these pH values are given in the inset of Fig. 5. In Fig. 5 is plotted the log of the catalyzed and uncatalyzed rates versus pH, as well as the ratio of kcat/kuncatversus pH. The decrease in rates at lower pH values reflects a decrease in the fraction of unprotonated thiol required for disulfide formation. The catalysis (kcat/kuncat = 3.84), however, is the greatest at pH 3.1. One factor contributing to the greater catalysis at pH 3.1 is probably the weaker binding of the dimer product, which allows greater turnover. From Fig. 5 it can be seen that no catalysis will occur above pH ∼6.25.Figure 5:log(kcat), log(kuncat), and kcat/kuncatversus pH for FCHPQNT-NH2 dimerization.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Fig. 6 shows the (2σFoσ - σFcσ), αc map for the refined crystal structure of streptavidin-Ac-CHPQNT-NH2 dimer, pH 7.0. The numerous, intricate hydrogen bonding and van der Waals interactions that mediate the binding of HPQ-containing peptide ligands to streptavidin have been described (37.Katz, B. A. 1995 Biochemistry, in pressGoogle Scholar) and are shown in Fig. 6 and briefly summarized in the legend. The intermolecular disulfide, defined by weak density, is in a position similar to that for the N-terminal disulfide in streptavidin-cyclo-Ac-[CHPQGPPC]-NH2 dimer. The Sγ-Sγ distance2 is 2.06 Å, and the χ3 dihedral2 is 71°, which are close to the optimal values for a right-handed disulfide(29.Katz B.A. Kossiakoff A. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 15480-15485Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Fig. 7 shows the (2σFoσ - σFcσ), αc map superimposed on the refined structure of streptavidin-FCHPQNT-NH2 dimer, pH 7.0. The stacking of the N-terminal peptide Phe residues against one another may help stabilize the protein-ligand dimer complex. There are potential NH → aromatic π interactions(30.Burley S.K. Petsko G.A. FEBS Lett. 1986; 203: 139-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (694) Google Scholar), shown in cyan, between the C-terminal amide NHs and the Phe aromatic rings. Overlaid in Fig. 8 are the refined structures of the complexes of streptavidin with FSHPQNT (37.Katz, B. A. 1995 Biochemistry, in pressGoogle Scholar) and with the disulfide-bonded dimers of FCHPQNT-NH2, Ac-CHPQNT-NH2, and cyclo-Ac-[CHPQGPPC]-NH2(5.Katz B.A. Stroud R.M. Liu B. Arze R. Collins N. Chemistry & Biology. 1995; 2: 591-600Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). Global shifts in protein and peptide ligand coordinates occur due to changes in crystal packing that often involve significant contraction or expansion in the crystal lattice(5.Katz B.A. Stroud R.M. Liu B. Arze R. Collins N. Chemistry & Biology. 1995; 2: 591-600Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). For each pair of structures compared the root mean square deviations between corresponding atoms of core residues range from 0.25 to 0.63 Å (Table 2). The root mean square deviations for residues at the binding site exhibiting the most structural plasticity3 range from 0.21 to 0.87 Å (Table 2). Disulfide formation and dimerization causes large differences in the positions of the stacking peptide Phe residues, shown in green balls and sticks, in the streptavidin-bound FCHPQNT-NH2 dimer structure compared with their more separated positions, shown with pink balls and sticks, in the streptavidin-bound FSHPQNT monomer structure.Tabled 1 Open table in a new tab In I222 streptavidin crystals, the thiols of bound neighboring 2-fold related FCHPQNT ligands are estimated to be separated by ∼5.0 Å, based on the structure of streptavidin-FSHPQNT (37.Katz, B. A. 1995 Biochemistry, in pressGoogle Scholar), and the thiols of neighboring Ac-CHPQNT-NH2 ligands are estimated to be separated by ∼3.6 Å, based on the structure of streptavidin-cyclo-Ac-[CHPQGPPC]-NH2 monomer (37.Katz, B. A. 1995 Biochemistry, in pressGoogle Scholar). Thus in I222 streptavidin crystals, disulfide formation can be catalyzed when the ligand thiols are positioned 3.6-5.0 Å from one another in appropriate orientations. In I4122 streptavidin crystals(37.Katz, B. A. 1995 Biochemistry, in pressGoogle Scholar), bound ligands are also presented next to one another (Fig. 9). In the I4122 crystal structure of streptavidin-cyclo-Ac-[CHPQFC]-NH2, the 2-fold related N-terminal sulfurs are separated by 10.8 Å (Fig. 9) and can be brought to a separation of 6.4 Å by breaking the disulfide bond and rotating about the Cβ-Sγ bond. No enhancement of disulfide formation was observed upon incubation of FCHPQNT-NH2 or Ac-CHPQNT-NH2 in apostreptavidin crystals of space group I4122. Thus, a separation of ∼6.4 Å between neighboring bound thiols may be too large to allow catalysis of disulfide formation. The lack of catalysis by the tetragonal crystals could also reflect nonoptimal orientations of the bound ligand thiols. The streptavidin I222 crystal lattice mediates formation by disulfide interchange of a “head to head” disulfide bonded cyclo-Ac-[CHPQGPPC]-NH2 peptide dimer from the corresponding bound monomers(5.Katz B.A. Stroud R.M. Liu B. Arze R. Collins N. Chemistry & Biology. 1995; 2: 591-600Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). Fig. 8 shows the relationship of the neighboring streptavidin-bound cyclo-Ac-[CHPQGPPC]-NH2 monomer units (in white) of the peptide dimer in the I222 lattice. The relationship of the neighboring streptavidin-bound cyclo-Ac-[CHPQFC]-NH2 monomers in the I4122 lattice is different; the Sγ atom of the N-terminal Cys is closer to the Sγ atom of the C-terminal Cys of the neighboring ligand than to the N-terminal Sγ of the neighboring ligand (Fig. 9). The N- and C-terminal Sγ atoms can be brought to a separation of 4.8 Å by breaking the disulfide bond and rotating about the Cβ-Sγ bonds (Fig. 9). This relationship suggested that for some ligands that contain a disulfide or 2 thiols, “head to tail” dimerization could be promoted or catalyzed by the I4122 lattice. Whereas in both space groups neighboring bound ligands are related by 2-fold symmetry axes, the 2-fold axis relating the neighboring streptavidin-bound cyclo-Ac-[CHPQGPPC]-NH2 ligands in I222 crystals is along the x-direction of Fig. 8, appropriate for head to head dimerization, whereas in I4122 crystals it is along the z-direction of Fig. 9, appropriate for “head-to-tail” dimerization. Recently we showed that streptavidin crystals of space group I4122 promote head to tail dimerization of cyclo-Ac-[CHPQGPPC]-NH2.3 An industrially and technologically significant field of chemistry involves heterogeneous catalysis by small molecule crystals or crystal surfaces(31.Somorjai, G. A. 1994 Surfactant Sci. Ser. 299–300, 849–866Google Scholar, 32.Imbihl R. Davison S.G. Davison P.G. Progress in Surface Science. 44. Pergamon Press, New York1993: 185-343Google Scholar). The catalysis of disulfide formation between thiols of neighboring ligands in streptavidin is the first example of catalysis mediated by a protein crystal lattice. Key features of the design of the ligands that are catalytically dimerized are weaker binding of linear peptide ligands compared with their cyclic counterparts and weaker binding at low pH, which allows product dissociation and catalytic turnover. The I222 streptavidin lattice at the ligand binding sites resembles an enzyme in several features: binding of the adjacent reactive ligands is in productive orientations for the ensuing reaction; binding involves H-bonds, ordered water molecules, and hydrophobic interactions at several subsites away from the “active site”; the effective concentrations of the reactants are greatly raised; and the crystal packing interactions must marginally stabilize the transition state to yield the modest rate enhancements observed. Also, just as participation of more than one subunit in enzyme catalysis is a common theme of biochemistry, topochemical catalysis within a protein crystal lattice also relies on adjacent protein molecules acting in concert. Structure-based enzyme engineering (33.Breaker R.R. Joyce G.F. Trends Biotechnol. 1994; 12: 268-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar, 34.Dhanaraj V. Nugent P. Pitts J.E. Cooper J.B. Blundell T.L. Prog. Biotechnol. 1994; 9: 3-15Google Scholar) bridges the disciplines of chemistry, structural biology, and biotechnology. The design of protein crystal lattices capable of catalyzing targeted reactions is a challenge with the potential to enlarge the scope of engineering artificial enzyme systems. Such catalyzed reactions may include ligation reactions like asymmetric synthesis of peptides, peptidomimetics, or organic molecules. There are some features of protein crystal lattices that could be exploited in the design of biocatalysts. The solvent channels contain space for insertion by mutagenesis of engineered loops or segments bearing catalytic residues onto the surface of the protein comprising the crystal. The size and site of insertion must preserve the ability of the protein to crystallize in the intended lattice. A catalytic active site engineered at a crystal packing interface could allow access of relatively large substrates to and from the active site for catalytic turnover. For example, the cavity or channel between the 2-fold related neighboring ligand sites in I222 streptavidin crystals is about 18.9 × 12.6 Å (Fig. 10). Finally, the ability of some protein crystal lattices, like the I222 streptavidin lattice, to expand and contract in response to the binding of different ligands allows some tolerance to accommodate substrates that may not fit precisely in the existing lattice. This variability in crystal packing within a crystal lattice resembles structural plasticity within the protein itself, which also increases the repertoire of potential ligands. An advantage of protein crystal catalysts is stability toward autolysis and exogenous proteolysis(16.Persichetti R.A. St. Clair N.L. Griffith J.P. Navia M.A. Margolin A.L. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1995; 117: 2732-2737Crossref Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the intermolecular protein-protein interactions within the crystal lattice may significantly enhance stability against heat and other denaturants by preventing unfolding, aggregation, or dissociation of the proteins (35.Klibanov A.M. Anal. Biochem. 1979; 93: 1-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (386) Google Scholar). In addition, stability toward organic solvents to increase the scope of possible catalyzed reactions can be attained by covalent cross-linking of neighboring proteins in the lattice(16.Persichetti R.A. St. Clair N.L. Griffith J.P. Navia M.A. Margolin A.L. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1995; 117: 2732-2737Crossref Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Cross-linking in the presence of tightly bound ligands at or near the engineered active site following removal of such ligands would leave the active site intact (cross-link-free) in an engineered crystal cross-linked elsewhere. Such stable protein crystal lattices engineered to catalyze targeted reactions may well have industrial and biomedical applications in the future."
