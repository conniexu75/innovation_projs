https://openalex.org/W1573534810,"By studying the dissociation of 125I-instulin from its receptors in the absence and phe negatively cooperative type for the insulin receptors. In the present study we extend oy purified mouse and rat liver membranes as well as in human circulating monocytes and human cultured lymphocytes demonstrated negative cooperativity that was extraordinarily simn membranes more slowly than it does from its receptors on whole cells. The dissociaty a small percentage of the receptor sites (1 to 5%), are sufficient to accelerate dissociation of hormone from receptor. At these insulin concentrations insulin is entirely monomeric, and in fact at higher concentrations of insulin (greater than 10(-7) M) where insulin dimers predominate, the cooperativity effect is progressively lost. The dissociation rate of 125I-insulin alone (that is at very low fractional saturation of receptors) was markedly accelerated by dripping the pH from 8.0 to 5.0, whereas the dissociation of 125I-insulin at high receptor occupancy was only slightly accelerated by the fall in pH. The dissociation rate was directly related to temperature, but the dissociation rate of 125I-insulin at low receptor occupancy was much more affected by reduction in temperature and showed a sharp transition at 21 degrees. Urea at concentrations as low as 1 M produced a marked acceleration of 125I-insulin dissociation. Divalent cations (calcium and magnesium) appear to stabilize the insulin-receptor interaction, since higher degrees of receptor occupancy were required to achieve a given rate of dissociation of 125I-insulin. These data make it likely that the insulin receptors exist as oligomeric structures or clusters in the plasma membrane. Insulin receptor sites appear to switch from a slow dissociating state to a fast dissociating state when their occupancy increases; the proportion of sites in each state is a function of occupancy of the receptor sites by the insulin monomer as well as of the physiochemical environment. Other models which could explain apparent negative cooperativity besides site-site interactions, i.e. polymerization of the hormone, steric or electrostatic hindrance due to ligand-ligand interactions, or unstirred (Noyes-Whitney) layers are considered unlikely in the case of insulin receptors on both experimental and theoretical grounds."
https://openalex.org/W1480914201,"Superoxide dismutase was assayed by a method which takes advantage of the inhibitory action of superoxide dismutase (or tissues which contain superoxide dismutase) on the rate of autooxidation of 6-hydroxydopamine. Incubation of pure superoxide dismutase of homogenates of brain or liver with 10(-3) M diethyldithiocarbamate for 1.5 hours resulted in total loss of superoxide dismutase activity. Inhibition of superoxide dismutase was not reversed by dialysis, but after dialysis, enzymatic activity was restored with CuSO4. When 1.5 g of diethyldithiocarbamate/kg were injected into mice, the superoxide dismutase activity at 3 hours was decreased by 86%, 71%, and 48%, respectively, in whole blood, liver, and brain. A dose of 0.5 g of diethyldithiocarbamate/kg lowered the superoxide dismutase activity by 42% in liver at 3 hours. A study of the time course for inhibiton of superoxide dismutase in liver after 1.5 g of diethyldithiocarbamate/kg, showed a maximum decrease (81%) within 1 hour, with a slow return to 64% of normal by 24 hours. Inhibition of superoxide dismutase in vivo and in vitro was confirmed with other assay systems based on the autooxidation of pyrogallol or epinephrine or on reduction of cytochrome c or intro blue tetrazolium. Treatment of animals with diethyldithiocarbamate may provide a useful experimental model to study the role of superoxide dismutase in various tissues."

https://openalex.org/W1506664754,"The passive permeability of isolated chromaffin vesicles to H+ and the internal pH of the vesicles under various conditions were measured. Potentiometric measurements of K+ and H+ fluxes in the presence of selected ionophores and uncouplers indicated that the membrane is highly impermeable to both protons and potassium. deltapH across the chromaffin granule membrane was measured by [14C]methylamine distribution. At pH 6.85, The deltapH WAS 1.16 WITH THE INTRAVESICULAR SPACE BEING FOUND ACIDIC. Varying the external pH produced an equivalent change in the deltapH, WITH EXTRAPOLATION TO ZERO DEltapH yielding a value of pH 5.5, WHICH IS TAKEN AS AN INDICATION OF THE PH of the intravesicular space. The pH gradient could be enhanced or collapsed by the addition of ionophores and uncouplers under varying ionic conditions. deltapH was constant for granules suspended in various ionic media, suggesting that the deltapH did not arise secondarily due to the establishment of a Donnan equilibrium. The significance of the proton impermeability and deltapH is discussed in terms of regulation of the uptake and storage of catecholamines in bovine chromaffin granules."
https://openalex.org/W1565430310,"Hormone-sensitive lipase and cholesterol ester hydrolase of chicken adipose tissue were markedly activated by adenosine 3':5'-monophosphate (cAMP)-dependent protein kinase (on the average, 235 to 275%; occasionally as much as 1000%). Diglyceride and monoglyceride hydrolases were also activated, but to a lesser extent (60 to 87%). The activation of all four hydrolases was inhibited by protein kinase inhibitor and reversed by the addition of exogenous protein kinase. Following activation by cAMP-dependent protein kinase, all four hydrolases were deactivated in a Mg2+-dependent reaction and then reactivated to or near initial levels on incubation with cAMP and Mg2+-ATP. The reversible deactivation is assumed to reflect activity of one or more protein phosphatases. The maximum activation obtainable for the four hydrolases decreased when the tissue had been previously exposed to glucagon, indicating that the glucagon-induced activation was probably similar to or identical with the activation demonstrated in cell-free preparations. The pH optima for the four hydrolase activities were similar (7.13 to 7.38). Although the absolute activities and relative degrees of kinase activation differed according to the particular emulsified substrates used, the results do not rule out the possibility that all four hydrolase activities are referable to a single hormone-sensitive hydrolase. Hormone-sensitive acyl hydrolases were separated from lipoprotein lipase by heparin-Sepharose affinity chromatography. Lipoprotein lipase was active against triolein, diolein, and monoolein, but not cholesterol oleate. Incubation of lipoprotein lipase with exogenous protein kinase, cAMP, and Mg2+ATP had no effect on any of the three hydrolase activities. Lipoprotein lipase was further purified to homogeneity and used to prepare antiserum in rabbits. The immunoglobin G fraction from these antisera completely inhibited lipoprotein lipase eluted from heparin-Sepharose columns. However, the hormone-sensitive hydrolase activities (not retained on heparin-Sepharose affinity chromatography) were not inhibited by anti-lipoprotein lipase immunoglobin G, and anti-lopoprotein lipase immunoglobin G did not affect the activation process in crude fractions. Thus, hormone-sensitive lipase and lipoprotein lipase, functionally distinct enzymes, have been physically resolved and immunochemically distinguished. Apparently lipoprotein lipase activity is not regulated, at least directly, by cAMP-dependent protein kinase."
https://openalex.org/W2069459787,"A radioactively labeled alpha-adrenergic antagonist, [3H]dihydroergocryptine, binds specifically to a site on rabbit uterine membranes. Binding is rapid, reaching equilibrium in less than 17 minutes at 25 degrees C. Adrenergic agonists compete for this binding site with an order of affinities identical to the pharmacological potency order of these agents as alpha-adrenergic agonists (epinephrine greater than norepinephrine greater than isoprotereonl). The (-) stereoisomers of epinephrine and norepinephrine are 30 times more potent in competing for the site than the corresponding (+) stereoisomers. alpha-Adrenergic antagonists, such as phentolamine and phenoxybenzamine, potently compete for the binding sites while the beta-adrenergic antagonist propranolol does not. Structural analogs of catecholamines that are devoid of alpha-adrenergic physiological activity do not compete for [3H]dihydroergocryptine binding sites. These data suggest that alpha-adrenergic receptors can be directly identified and studied by [3H]dihydroergocryptine binding."
https://openalex.org/W1558437811,"A method for assessing the binding of 3H-labeled prostaglandin E1 ([3H]PGE1) to cell membranes has been developed and used to study the interaction of [3H]PGE1 with membranes from cultured mammalian cells. Receptor sites were identified by correlation of the potency of a series of compounds to compete for [3H]PGE1 binding sites and to stimulate adenylate cyclase activity, by correlation of rates of binding and change in enzyme activity, and by the correspondence of [3H]PGE1-binding activity with the presence or absence of PGE1-sensitive adenylate cyclase in several clones. In clone B82, a murine L-cell, [3H]PGE1 binds with an activation energy of 14 kcal/mol to a class of sites with an affinity of 0.5 X 10(8) M-1 and a capacity of 150 fmol/mg of protein. Concentration dependence of adenylate cyclase activation by PGE1 (KD =30 nM) and kinetic analysis of [3H]PGE1 binding (k1 = 4 X 10(6) liters/mol/min, k-1 0.15/min) verify this affinity. Concentration dependence and specificity of binding and activation of adenylate cyclases in neuroblastoma clone N4TG1 and N18TG2 substantiate the method. In several clones that lack PGE1-responsive adenylate cyclase, no specific [3H]PGE1 binding is detectable."
https://openalex.org/W1595626863,"Sarcoplasmic reticulum fragments isolated from dog cardiac muscle possess a calcium-accumulating system associated with a series of enzymes linked to glycogenolysis. These enzymes include: adenylate cyclase, cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase, phosphorylase b kinase, phosphorylase (b/a, 30/1),debrancher enzyme, and glycogen (0.3 to 0.7 mg/mg of protein). The sarcoplasmic reticulum preparation produced glucose 1-phosphate and glucose from either endogenous or exogenous glycogen. Both the calcium-accumulating and glycogenolytic enzymes sediment in a single peak at 33% sucrose on a linear continous sucrose density gradient, and the complex remains intact throughout repeated washing. Glycogen particles appear to be associated with the sarcoplasmic reticulum in situ as well as in the isolated microsomal fraction. The sarcoplasmic reticulum-glycogenolytic complex, monitored by a linked enzyme spectrophotometric assay, shows several features: (a) activation of phosphorylase activity to peak rate occurs over a very rapid time course which cannot be duplicated using combinations of purified enzymes; (b) activation is inhibited by protein kinase inhibitor; (c) phosphorylase b functions as in the purified form with respect to AMP (Km, 0.3 mM); (d) in the presence of limiting amounts of glycogen, optimal phosphorylase b activity in the sarcoplasmic reticulum requires the presence of debrancher, and the activity is sensitive to inhibitors of that enzyme such as Tris, which suggests the possiblity that the enzymes bear a specific structual relationship to the glycogen present. Phosphorylase b leads to a activation in the sarcoplasmic reticulum was completely resistant to ethylene glycol bis(beta-aminoethyl either)-N,N'-tetraacetic acid (EGTA). Inhibition of calcium accumulation by or release of bound calcium from sarcoplasmic reticulum by X537A (RO 2-2985) did not alter the EGTA resistance. These results suggest that cardiac sarcoplasmic reticulum is a complex organelle containing functions that may be related to excitation-contraction coupling and intermediary metabolism."
https://openalex.org/W1500528414,"The mechanism by which superoxide anion is generated by the interaction of phenylhydrazine with either oxy- or methemoglobin was investigated. Rather than superoxide anion generation resulting from an accelerated autooxidation of oxyhemoglobin, it was found that both oxy- and methemoglobin function as peroxidases toward phenylhydrazine with the resultant oxidation of this compound to phenyldiazine. Generation of phenyldiazine from the oxidation of phenylhydrazine by hemoglobin or by the hydrolysis and subsequent decarboxylation of methyl phenylazoformate (C6H5N=NCOOCH3) resulted in the production of superoxide anion. It is suggested that under certain conditions hemoglobin may function as a drug-metabolizing peroxidase."
https://openalex.org/W1484198152,"Changes in the ultraviolet/visible spectrum of human oxyferrohemoglobin upon addition of aniline were indicative of a concentration-dependent interaction of aniline with hemoglobin, resulting in accelerated autooxidation of the hemoprotein. Oxygen was found to markedly inhibit this interaction of aniline with oxyhemoglobin. The dependence of the rate of autooxidation on aniline concentration followed saturation kinetics and showed a half-maximal response at 8 mM aniline. This value is equal to the value of Km for aniline as substrate for the O2-dependent, hemoglobin-catalyzed hydroxylation reaction which yields p-aminophenol (Mieyal, J. J., Ackerman, R.S., Blumer, J.L., and Freeman, L.S. (1976) J. Biol. Chem. 241, 3436-3441). Thus, an aniline-oxyhemoglobin complex is implicated in the overall catalytic reaction. No detectable p-aminophenol was formed when aniline was combined with oxyhemoglobin in the absence of an electron donor, but hydroxylation of aniline does occur when NADPH, NADPH plus P-450 reductase, or Na2S2O4 are also added."
https://openalex.org/W1558089358,"The effects of several inhibitors (ATP, ADP, AMP, UDP, and P1) and activators (Mg2+, glucose-6-P) of rabbit muscle glycogen synthase (UDP-glucose:glycogen 4-alpha-glucosyltransferase, EC 2.4.1.11) were studied in relation to the phosphorylation state of the purified enzyme. All the modifiers had increasing effects with enzyme of increasing alkali-labile phosphate content. In experiments where combinations of effectors were present, it was apparent that (a) concentrations of modifiers in the physiological range could be significant in determining enzymic activity and (b) the sensitivity of the reaction rate to changes in phosphorylation state was critically dependent on the concentration of the small molecules. Changes in the phosphorylation of the enzyme corresponding to changes in the %I activity reported in the literature for studies in vivo were capable of producing large alterations in glycogen synthase activity. Because the magnitudes of such changes were dependent on the effector concentrations, there may be an integration of local cellular control, through small molecule effects, with hormonal control, through the phosphorylation state of glycogen synthase."
https://openalex.org/W1563120401,"The vitamin K-dependent carboxylating system has been solubilized by Lubrol PX or Triton X-100 treatment of vitamin K-deficient rat liver microsomes. As obtained from vitamin K-deficient rat liver, this soluble preparation is dependent upon the in vitro addition of vitamin K1 for carboxylating activity. The enzyme system is complex and is dependent upon NADH and dithiothreitol for maximum activity. While detergents used to solubilize the enzyme complex do markedly inhibit the activity of the system, the solubilized system is still highly responsive to vitamin K addition and can be used for further study of the carboxylating enzyme system. The requirement for dithiothreitol and the inhibition by p-hydroxymercuribenzoate indicate the involvement of an --SH enzyme in the carboxylating system."
https://openalex.org/W173434071,"The yeast proteinase that causes activation of the chitin synthetase zymogen has been purified by a procedure that includes affinity chromatography on an agarose column to which the proteinaceous inhibitor of the enzyme had been covalently attached. The purified enzyme yielded a single band upon disc gel electrophoresis at pH 4.5 in the presence of urea. At the same pH, but without urea, a faint band was detected in coincidence with enzymatic activity, whereas at pH 9.5, either in the absence or in the presence of sodium dodecyl sulfate, no protein zone could be seen. From sedimentation and gel filtration data, a molecular weight of 44,000 was estimated. The proteinase was active within a wide range of pH values, with an optimum between pH 6.5 AND 7. Titraton of the activity with the protein inhibitor from yeast required 1 mol of inhibitor/mol of enzyme. A similar result was obtained with phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, an indication that 1 serine residue is required for enzymatic activity. The enzyme exhibited hydrolytic activity with several proteins and esterolytic activity with many synthetic substrates, including benzoylarginine ethyl ester and acetyltyrosine ethyl ester.A comparison of the properties of the enzyme with those of known yeast proteinases led to the conclusion that the chitin synthestase activating factor is identical with the enzyme previously designated as proteinase B (EC 3.4.22.9). This is the first time that a homogeneous preparation of proteinase B has been obtained and characterized."
https://openalex.org/W1580570166,"The role of the Ca2+ concentration gradient in ATP synthesis and membrane phosphorylation by Pi was investigated in sarcoplasmic reticulum vesicles isolated from rabbit skeletal muscle. The Pi concentration required to attain 50% of the maximal membrane phosphorylation varies significantly in the pH range of 5.5 to 4.5, the optimal being at pH 6.0. In the pH range of 6.0 to 7.0, this concentration of Pi was 4- to 10-fold higher in empty vesicles than in vesicles loaded with calcium phosphate, i.e. having transmembrane Ca2+ concentration gradient. ATP, ADP, and Ca2+ inhibit the membrane phosphorylation by Pi, the inhibition being greater at pH 7.0 than at pH 6.0. The pH profile for ATP synthesis shows a higher optimum than for membrane phosphorylation. The optimum pH for synthesis, but not for phosphorylation depends on whether the vesicles were previously loaded with calcium phosphate or with calcium oxalate. Addition of Ca2+ to the assay medium inhibits the extent of membrane phosphorylation and the rate of ATP synthesis to different extents. Evidence is presented that the rate of membrane phosphorylation by Pi is higher than the rate by which the phosphoprotein transfers its pohsphate to ADP for the ATP synthesis."
https://openalex.org/W182134839,"The properties of two purified peptidases derived from the intestinal brush border membrane of the rat have been investigated. The pH optima, heat stabilities, substrate specificities, and metal ion requirements of the two enzymes and the effects of inhibitors on their activities were nearly identical. The isoenzymes catalyzed the hydrolysis of a wide range of peptides containing from 2 to 8 amino acid residues. The enzymes are aminopeptidases; no evidence for carboxypeptidase or endopeptidase activity was found. For hydrolysis, there appears to be an absolute requirement for an L-amino acid at the NH2-terminus of the peptide substrate. There was a similar but less absolute requirement for the penultimate NH2-terminal amino acid. Thus, although peptides of the type L-aminoacyl-L-proline, L-aminoacyl-L-prolyl-(L-amino acid)n, or L-aminoacyl-D-amino acid were not hydrolyzed, L-leucyl-beta-naphthylamide could be utilized as a substrate. The enzymes appeared to be metalloenzymes in that metal ion-chelating agents could inhibit their activities. Co2+ partially restored the activities lost by chelation. Immunodiffusion studies showed that the two enzymes were immunologically identical. The antipeptidase antisera were specific for the enzymes and did not react with other constituents of the intestinal cell. Both enzymes have binding sites for the lectin phytohemagglutinin which recognizes N-acetylgalactosamine residues located at or near the terminal positions of glycoprotein carbohydrate chains. Both the lectin and the antibodies inhibited enzyme activities, but the mechanisms of inhibition appeared to be different."
https://openalex.org/W1544402682,"Aldose reductase from calf lens was purified 15,000-fold. The homogeneity of the final preparation was demonstrated by molecular sieve chromatography, analytical ultracentrifugation, sodium dodecyl sulfate gel electrophoresis, Ouchterlony immunodiffusion, and polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis at three pH values. The monomeric nature of the enzyme is suggested by the molecular weight of 37,000 from both molecular sieve chromatography and sodium dodecyl sulfate-gel electrophoresis with beta-mercaptoethanol. This closely corresponds with a molecular weight of 40,400 estimated by using calculate physical constants in the Svedberg equation. The S20,w was 3.6 to 3.7 as determined from ultracentrifuge and sucrose density gradient data. The Stokes radius was found to be 2.5 +/- 0.2 nm and 2.75 +/- 0.15 nm by two different methods. The diffusion constant D20,w is (7.8 +/- 10(-7) +/- 0.45 X 10(-7) cm2/s). The molecule is nearly spherical as indicated by a frictional ratio f/fo = 1.14. The alpha-helical content was estimated from circular dichroism data to be 5% and did not change in the presence of added substrates, products, and some enzyme inhibitors. Homotropic cooperative effects were observed as shown by the concave downward curvature of the reciprocal plots."
https://openalex.org/W1598958769,"Properties of glutamine-dependent glutamate synthase have been investigated using homogeneous enzyme from Escherichia coli K-12. In contrast to results with enzyme from E. coli strain B (Miller, R. E., and Stadtman, E. R. (1972) J. Biol. Chem. 247, 7407-7419), this enzyme catalyzes NH3-dependent glutamate synthase activity. Selective inactivation of glutamine-dependent activity was obtained by treatment with the glutamine analog. L-2-amino-4-oxo-5-chloropentanoic acid (chloroketone). Inactivation by chloroketone exhibited saturation kinetics; glutamine reduced the rate of inactivation and exhibited competitive kinetics. Iodoacetamide, other alpha-halocarbonyl compounds, and sulfhydryl reagents gave similar selective inactivation of glutamine-dependent activity. Saturation kinetics were not obtained for inactivation by iodoacetamide but protection by glutamine exhibited competitive kinetics. The stoichiometry for alkylation by chloroketone and iodoacetamide was approximately 1 residue per protomer of molecular weight approximately 188,000. The single residue alkylated with iodo [1-14C]acetamide was identified as cysteine by isolation of S-carboxymethylcysteine. This active site cysteine is in the large subunit of molecular weight approximately 153,000. The active site cysteine was sensitive to oxidation by H2O2 generated by autooxidation of reduced flavin and resulted in selective inactivation of glutamine-dependent enzyme activity. Similar to other glutamine amidotransferases, glutamate synthase exhibits glutaminase activity. Glutaminase activity is dependent upon the functional integrity of the active site cysteine but is not wholly dependent upon the flavin and non-heme iron. Collectively, these results demonstrate that glutamate synthase is similar to other glutamine amidotransferases with respect to distinct sites for glutamine and NH3 utilization and in the obligatory function of an active site cysteine residue for glutamine utilization."
https://openalex.org/W1570436042,"Reaction of phenylglyoxal with aspartate transcarbamylase and its isolated catalytic subunit results in complete loss of enzymatic activity. This modification reaction is markedly influenced by pH and is partially reversible upon dialysis. Carbamyl phosphate or carbamyl phosphate with succinate partially protect the catalytic subunit and the native enzyme from inactivation by phenylglyoxal. In the native enzyme complete protection from inactivation is afforded by N-(phosphonacetyl)-L-aspartate. The decrease in enzymatic activity correlates with the modification of 6 arginine residues on each aspartate transcarbamylase molecule, i.e. 1 arginine per catalytic site. The data suggest that the essential arginine is involved in the binding of carbamyl phosphate to the enzyme. Reaction of the single thiol on the catalytic chain with 2-chloromercuri-4-nitrophenol does not prevent subsequent reaction with phenylglyoxal. If N-(phosphonacetyl)-L-aspartate is used to protect the active site we find that phenylglyoxal also causes the loss of activation of ATP and inhibition by CTP. The rate of loss of heterotropic effects is exactly the same for both nucleotides indicating that the two opposite regulatory effects originate at the same location on the enzyme, or are transmitted by the same mechanism between the subunits, or both."
https://openalex.org/W1535343987,"The affinity label N-bromoacetylethanolamine phosphate (BrAcNHEtOP) has been used previously at pH 6.5 to identify His-359 of rabbit muscle aldolase as an active site residue. We now find that the specificity of the reagent is pH-dependent. At pH 8.5, alkylation with 14C-labeled BrAcNHEtOP abolishes both fructose-1,6-P2 cleavage activity and transaldolase activity. The stoichiometry of incorporation, the kinetics of inactivation, and the protection against inactivation afforded by a competitive inhibitor or dihydroxyacetone phosphate are consistent with the involvement of an active site residue. A comparison of 14C profiles obtained from chromatography on the amino acid analyzer of acid hydrolysates of inactivated and protected samples reveals that inactivation results from the alkylation of lysyl residues. The major peptide in tryptic digests of the inactivated enzyme has been isolated. Based on its amino acid composition and the known sequence of aldolase, Lys-146 is the residue preferentially alkylated by the reagent. Aldolase modified at His-359 is still subject to alkylation of lysine; thus Lys-146 and His-359 are not mutually exclusive sites. However, aldolase modified at Lys-146 is not subject to alkylation of histidine. One explanation of these observations is that modification of Lys-146 abolishes the binding capacity of aldolase for substrates and substrate analogs (BrAcNHEtOP), whereas modification of his-359 does not. Consistent with this explanation is the ability of aldolase modified at His-359 to form a Schiff base with substrate and the inability of aldolase modified at Lys-146 to do so. Therefore, Lys-146 could be one of the cationic groups that functions in electrostatic binding of the substrate's phosphate groups."

The inhibitor is a substrate for the enzyme, and as such is converted into a highly reactive intermediate which chemically reacts with an active site residue, thus irreversibly inactivating the enzyme. Enzymological and model studies on AMB are presented which enable one to determine the precise mechanism of action of this toxin. The mechanism involves Schiff base formation between the enzyme and toxin followed by alpha-C--H bond cleavage and aldimine isomerization to generate a bifunctional Michael acceptor. This molecule alkylates an active site residue by an addition and elimination route."
https://openalex.org/W1650619188,"Crystalline glutaminase-asparaginase which is effective against solid as well as ascites tumors was prepared from soil isolate organism Pseudomonas 7A. This enzyme has a ration of Vmax for L-glutamine and L-asparagine of 2.0. The presence of glutamic acid in the growth medium is essential for optimal enzyme production and glucose inhibits the production of glutaminase-asparaginase. The purification procedure provides an overall yield of 40 to 45% from crude cell extract to homogeneous glutaminase-asparaginase and is adaptable to large scale production of the enzyme. The specific activity of homogeneous enzyme is 160 +/- 15 i.u./mg of protein and the E1% 280 is 9.8. No disulfide or sulfhydryl groups appear to be present on the enzyme. The isoelectric point of glutaminase-asparaginase by isoelectric focusing on ampholine polyacrylamide gel plates is 5.8. The Km values for L-glutamine and L-asparagine are 4.6 and 4.4 X 10(-6) M, respectively.

https://openalex.org/W1521554976,"The hydrolysis of the phospholipids of intact human serum high density lipoprotein 3 (HDL3) by pure alpha-phospholipase A2 from Crotalus adamanteus was studied by pH-stat titration. The enzyme quantitatively hydrolyzed phosphatidylcholine and phosphatidylethanolamine and left sphinogomyelin intact, yielding a stable and water-soluble modified HDL. Lysophospholipids and free fatty acids, the products of hydrolysis, remained in the lipoprotein. When 1 mol of defatted bovine serum albumin/mol of substrate phospholipids was added to the reaction mixture, up to 60% of the fatty acids and 85% of the lysophospholipids were removed from the modified lipoprotein. The immunological reactivity of the hydrolyzed HDL remained unaltered in both the presence and absence of albumin. The changes in the physical properties of the lipoprotein during hydrolysis were rather small, the most notable being an increase in the hydrated density and in the electrophoretic mobility in alkaline buffers. The hydrolysis followed an apparent first order time course with product inhibition (KI) and yielded values of kcat/Km = 7 X 10(5 M(-1)s(-1) and KI congruent to 1 X 10(-4) M. Addition of albumin to the reaction mixture relieved the product inhibition without any alteration of the kinetic parameters. High concentrations of albumin protected some of the substrate phospholipids from hydrolysis, presumably through complexation to the lipoprotein. The Arrhenius plot for the experimental first order rate constant in the absence of albumin (kexp = kcat (KI/Km)) was linear between 15 degrees and 47 degrees, indicating the absence of any phospholipid phase transitions and yielding an activation energy of 15.2 kcal/mol. From the accessibility of the HDL phospholipids to phospholipase A2 one concludes that the phosphatidylcholine and phosphatidylethanolamine are located at, or are in rapid equilibrium with, the surface of this lipoprotein. It also appears that these phospholipids are not essential for maintaining the supramolecular properties of the lipoprotein in vitro. Thsu the study of the modified Hdl should provide valuable information concenring the structure and function of this lipoprotein particularly with regard to the role played by shiingomyelin."
https://openalex.org/W1532883710,"The interaction of insulin with human circulating granulocytes was studied with the use of 125I-insulin. Human granulocytes, isolated from blood by the Boyum technique, showed high insulin-degrading activity in vitro which almost obscured the presence of specific, high affinity binding sites. Degradation, measured by trichloroacetic acid precipitation and by binding to well characterized insulin receptors on cultured human lymphocytes (IM-9 line), was due to extracellular as well as cell-bound enzymes. Degradation was enhanced by Ca2+ and thiols and inhibited by various protease inhibitors and sulfhydryl-blocking reagents. Phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (5 X 10(-4) M), a serine protease inhibitor, was the most potent and inhibited 125I-insulin degradation by 80 to 90%. Tert-butyl hydroperoxide (2 X 10(-3) M), a glutathione-oxidizing reagent, inhibited degradation by 35 to 50%, possibly due to an effect on a glutathione-insulin transhydrogenase. Neither of the inhibitors affected cell viability. In the presence of inhibitors of degradation, binding sites for insulin with high affinity were detected, which by multiple criteria were true insulin receptors. Binding to these sites was rapid, saturable, and reversible with about 1000 sites/cell. The Hill coefficient for binding was 0.7, and the Scatchard plot of B/F versus B was curvilinear, due to site-site interactions of the negative cooperative type; the latter were demonstrated directly by kinetic studies. As shown previously for all other insulin receptors, binding was highly pH-dependent, and insulin analogues had affinities for these sites that closely correlated with their biological potencies."
https://openalex.org/W1510924080,"The Spot, Leiostomus xanthrus, has a single tetrameric hemoglobin. Structural studies indicate the presence of alpha- and beta-like chains with COOH-terminal sequences of --Arg and --TYR-His, respectively, the same as is found in human hemoglobin. Spot hemoglobin possesses a Root effect: a heterotropic control mechanism like the Bohr effect but with more extreme pH dependence in the equilibria and kinetics of O2 and CO binding. The Root effect seems to be a molecular adaptation, in that pH- and anion-sensitive hemoglobins may help fish achieve neutral buoyancy by facilitating O2 delivery to the swim bladder. Changes in the kinetics of both and off processes contribute to the greatly decreased ligand affinity of Spot hemoglobin at low pH. The time course ofligand combination at low pH is biphasic and wavelength dependent, suggesting a differential effect of pH on the alpha- and beta-like chains. The change in the shape of the ligand-binding curve with pH may be interpreted in terms of a proton-dependent transition between low (T) and high (R) affinity conformations. However, this may not be the only mechanism, since differential pH effects on the two types of chains may also contribute to the observed pH dependence."

This interference with the normal pattern of immunological reactions may be a reason for the survival of tumors in an immunologically alien environment.
https://openalex.org/W1482843700,"Purified bovine hepatic fructose-1,6-diphosphatase, which exhibits maximal activity at neutral pH, is competitively inhibited by several analogs of its substrate, fructose 1,6-diphosphate. These include glucose 1,6-diphosphate (Ki = 9.4 X 10(-5) M), hexitol 1,6-diphosphate (Ki = 2.3 X 10(-4) M), and 2,5-anhydro-D-mannitol 1,6-diphosphate (Ki = 3.3 X 10(-8) M), and 2,5-anhydro-D-glucitol 1,6-diphosphate (Ki = 5.5 X 10(-7) M). The Ki values for both 2,5-anhydro-D-mannitol 1,6-diphosphate and 2,5-anhydro-D-glucitol 1,6-diphosphate are lower than the Km of 1.4 X 10(-6) M for fructose 1,6-diphosphate. Since 2,5-anhydro-D-mannitol 1,6-diphosphate is an analog of the beta anomer of fructose 1,6-diphosphate and 2,5-anhydro-D-glucitol 1,6-diphosphate is an analog of the alpha anomer, the lower Ki for the mannitol analog may indicate that the beta anomer of fructose 1,6-diphosphate, which predominates in solution, is the true substrate. The substrate analog 1,5-pentanediol diphosphate inhibits slightly (K0.5 = 5 X 10(-3) M), but 1,4-cyclohexyldiol diphosphate does not. The Ki for product inhibition by sodium phosphate is 9.4 X 10(-3) M. 2,5-Anhydro-D-mannitol 1,6-diphosphate and alpha-D-glucose 1,6-diphosphate are substrates at pH 9.0, but not at pH 6.5."

In some cells, asparate selectively increases the membrane permeability to chloride, giving rise to a hyperpolarization, while on other cells it increases the permeability to sodium, causing a depolarization. There are also specific receptors for L-glutamate which mediate sodium, chloride, or potassium conductance increases, and another class of receptors activated by both glutamate and aspartate."
https://openalex.org/W1486403614,"A repressible alkaline phosphatase has been isolated from the extreme bacterial thermophile, Thermus aquaticus. The enzyme can be derepressed more than 1,000-fold by starving the cells for phosphate. In derepressed cells, nearly 6% of the total protein in a cell-free enzyme preparation is alkaline phosphatase. The enzyme was purified to homogeneity as judged by disc acrylamide electrophoresis and sodium dodecyl sulfate electrophoresis. By sucrose gradient centrifugation it was established that the enzyme has an approximate molecular weight of 143,000 and consists of three subunits, each with a molecular weight of 51,000. Tris buffer stimulates the activity of the enzyme, which has a pH optimum of 9.2. The enzyme has a broad temperature range with an optimum of 75-80 degrees. The enzyme catalyzes the hydrolysis of a wide variety of phosphorylated compounds as do many of the mesophilic alkaline phosphatases. The Michaelis constant(Km) for the enzyme is 8.0 X 10(-4) M. Amino acid analysis of the protein revealed little in the amino acid composition to separate it from other mesophilic enzymes which have been previously studied."
https://openalex.org/W1564249635,"The values of Vmax and Km for the three genetic variants A, B, and A- of erythrocyte glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase have been determined at 10 different pH values in the range from 5.5 to 9.5, and at four different temperatures in the range from 18.5-40.0 degrees. The log Vmax versus pH curve for each of the enzymes shows a monotonic increase between pH 5.5 and 7, and a plateau from pH 7.5 upwards. These curves, and their temperature dependence, are compatible with the presence of a single ionizable group which, in its conjugate acid form, renders the enzyme-substrate complex inactive. The pK of this group is 6.94 at 18.5 degrees, and its enthalpy of ionization is 7.0 kcal mol-1. The log Km versus pH curves show a broad plateau between pH 6.2 and 8.2, interrupted by a sharp minimum at pH 7.2 for variant B, while variants A and A- show sharp maxima at pH 7.2 and 7.45, respectively. It is proposed that this unusual behavior depends on the dissociation of the tetrameric enzyme to dimers in this pH region. Specifically, it is shown that a sharp maximum or minimum of Km can arise if cooperative uptake or release of protons is linked to dimer formation, and if the degree of cooperativity is different for the free enzyme compared to the enzyme-substrate complex. The pH dependence of the equilibrium between the tetrameric and the dimeric form of the enzyme has been determined by gel filtration for the same three genetic variants B, A, and A-. In agreement with previous ultracentrifugal data, the enzyme is a tetramer in acid solution and a dimer in alkaline solution. The pH at which half of the enzyme is in dimeric form, under our experimental conditions, is 7.15 +/- 0.05 for variants A and B, and 7.35 +/- 0.05 for variant A-. These pH values correspond closely, for all three variants, to the sharp extrema in the pH dependence of their Km values for glucose 6-phosphate. From the measured dissociation equilibria, it can be inferred that the tetramer-dimer transition entails cooperative release of protons. The degree of cooperativity estimated from these data agrees closely with the independent estimate based on the pH dependence of Km."

Dopamine beta-hydroxylase activity was decreased 7.5-fold in sympathetic ganglia, while tyrosine hydroxylase activity was reduced more than 50-fold in the pontine nucleus locus coeruleus. These observations indicate that noradrenergic neurons of both brain and ganglion are affected in idiopathic orthostatic hypotension, but suggest that the central and peripheral biochemical deficits differ."
https://openalex.org/W1507782685,"Escherichia coli contains two glutaminases, A and B, with pH optima below pH 5 and above pH 7, respectively. Neither glutaminase A nor B is released from E. coli by osmotic shock. Glutaminase B has been purified 6,000-fold and the purified preparation is estimated to contain about 40% glutaminase B. The enzyme has a molecular weight of 90,000 and an isoelectric point of 5.4. Glutaminase B exhibits a broad pH optimum between 7.1 and 9.0. Only L-glutamine is deamidated by glutaminase B, L-asparagine and D-glutamine are not deamidated. The substrate saturation curve for glutaminase B shows an intermediary plateau region. Like many regulatory enzymes, glutaminase B is cold-labile. The enzyme is inactivated by cooling and activated by warming; both processes are first order with respect to time. The activation energy for activation by warming was calculated to be 5900 cal/mol. Activation by warming increased the Vmax and decreased the S0.5 for L-glutamine, but did not alter the molecular weight of the catalytically active enzyme. Borate and glutamate protected glutaminase B from inactivation by cold."
https://openalex.org/W1650247880,"One of the four titrating histidine ring C-2 proton resonances of bovine pancreatic ribonuclease has been assigned to histidine residue 12. This was accomplished by a direct comparison of the rate of tritium incorporation into position C-2 of histidine 12 of S-peptide (residues 1 to 20) derived from ribonuclease S, with the rates of deuterium exchange of the four histidine C-2 proton resonances of ribonuclease S under the same experimental conditions. The same assignment was obtained by a comparison of the NMR titration curves of ribonuclease S, the noncovalent complex of S-peptide and S-protein (residues 21 to 124) with the results for the recombined complex in which position C-2 of histidine 12 was fully deuterated. The second active site histidine resonance was assigned to histidine residue 119 by consideration of the NMR titration results fro carboxymethylated histidines and 1-carboxymethylhistidine 119 ribonuclease. This assignment is a reversal of that originally reported, and has important implications for the interpretation of NMR titration data of ribonuclease."
https://openalex.org/W1489761162,"An L-asparaginase has been purified some 250-fold from extracts of Klebsiella aerogenes to near homogeneity. The enzyme has a molecular weight of 141,000 as measured by gel filtration and appears to consist of four subunits of molecular weight 37,000. The enzyme has high affinity for L-asparagine, with a Km below 10(-5) M, and hydrolyzes glutamine at a 20-fold lower rate, with a Km of 10(-3) M. Interestingly, the enzyme exhibits marked gamma-glutamyltransferase activity but comparatively little beta-aspartyl-transferase activity. A mutant strain lacking this asparaginase has been isolated and grows at 1/2 to 1/3 the rate of the parent strain when asparagine is provided in the medium as the sole source of nitrogen. This strain grows as well as the wild type when the medium is supplemented with histidine or ammonia. Glutamine synthetase activates the formation of L-asparaginase. Mutants lacking glutamine synthetase fail to produce the asparaginase, and mutants with a high constitutive level of glutamine synthetase also contain the asparaginase at a high level. Thus, the formation of asparaginase is regulated in parallel with that of other enzymes capable of supplying the cell with ammonia or glutamate, such as histidase and proline oxidase. Formation of the asparaginase does not require induction by asparaginase and is not subject to catabolite repression."
https://openalex.org/W1505651535,"Effects of substitution of vinyl groups of hemin with formyl groups on the optical and ligand binding properties of horse heart ferric myoglobin were investigated. The peak positions as well as the line shapes of the absorption spectra of the ferric derivatives of three kinds of formylmyoglobin, 2-vinyl-4-formyl-, 2-formyl-4-vinyl-, and 2,4-diformylmyoglobins depend on the number and the position of the formyl groups. Absorption maxima in the Soret region of the acid forms of these ferric formylmyoglobins in 0.1 M potassium phosphate buffer, pH 6.0, at 20 degrees were 415.2, 422, and 429 nm, respectively. The acid forms of these formylmyoglobins exhibit absorption spectra of the mixture of high- and low spin states at ambient temperature. Since proto-, deutero- and mesomyoglobins have a high spin state under the same condition, the increase of the low spin iron in these formylmyoglobins may be due to the strong electron withdrawal by the formyl groups toward the periphery of the porphyrin ring. The affinities of these ferric formylmyoglobins and protomyoglobin for N3-, F-, OCN-, and SCN- increased in the order of proto-, monoformyl-monovinyl-, 2,4-diformyl-myoglobin, which corresponds to the increasing order of electron-withdrawing power of the porphyrin side chains. The pKa values of the acid-alkaline transition decreased in the same order. Although the ferric forms of the two isomeric monoformyl-monovinylmyoglobins exhibited different optical spectra, the dissociation constants of the complexes of these isomers for various ligands were similar to each other. The pKa values of the acid-alkaline transition were also similar. These results indicate that affinities of ferric myoglobin for ligands, in contrast to those of the ferrous form for oxygen and carbon monoxide (Sono, M., and Asakura, T. (1975) J. Biol. Chem. 250, 5527-5232 and Sono, M., Smith, P.D., McCray, J.A., and Asakura, T. (1976) J. Biol. Chem 251, 1418-1426), are not affected by the position of modifications at the two vinyl groups, but are determinedby the number of the formyl groups and that two vinyl groups at position 2 and 4 are equivalent in the binding of various ligands by ferric myoglobin. The electron density of the ferric iron appears to be similar for the two isomeric monoformyl-monovinylmyoglobins."
https://openalex.org/W1488750918,"Substrate-induced conformational change of porcine muscle adenylate kinase (EC 2.7.4.3) is evidenced by a change in circular dichroism spectra in the near ultraviolet. In the absence of tryptophan in porcine muscle adenylate kinase, the spectral change may be assigned to a perturbation of tyrosine chromophore(s). The spectral change was specific for adenine nucleotide binding and was greater with ATP than with AMP. In the x-ray model, Tyr153 and Tyr154 are located at a hinge region of two domains which form a deep active site cleft and are therefore susceptible to conformational change on substrate binding. Adenylate kinase was treated with equimolar tetranitromethane. The yellow-colored product, separated from unmodified enzyme by substrate gradient elution on a phosphocellulose column, had about 1 mol of nitrotyrosine per mol of the enzyme by amino acid analysis and showed a slightly higher Km value than native enzyme for ADP (Km = 0.50 mM compared with 0.25 mM for native adenylate kinase). Spectrophotometric titration of nitroadenylate kinase gave pKa 8.4 for the dissociation constant of the nitrotyrosyl hydroxyl group. On binding ATP the pKa value increased to 9.0 while AMP binding caused very little change. By peptide mapping of the carboxypeptidase digestion product, 0.70 mol of nitro group per mol of adenylate kinase was detected on Tyr153 and a small amount of nitro group was also found on Tyr95. From these results it is proposed that Tyr153 is directly or indirectly involved in the binding of ATP."

The enzyme protein appeared as a single polypeptide of molecular weight 50,000 to 55,000 as determined by gel filtration, glycerol gradient sedimentation, and sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and comprised approximately 0.4% of the total virion protein. The activity was classified as a cyclic nucleotide-independent protein kinase as it was not effected by cyclic adenosine 3':5'-monophosphate, cyclic guanosine 3':5'-monophosphate, or inhibited by a cyclic nucleotide-dependent protein kinase inhibitor protein, and utilized GTP as well as ATP as a phosphate donor. The greatest rates of phosphorylation were obtained with acidic phosphoprotein substrates such as casein or phosvitin, although potential physiological substrates for this activity included specific virion polypeptides of frog virus."
https://openalex.org/W1543896691,"Antifreeze glycoprotein, which has previously been shown to be inactive in the presence of borate, migrates electrophoretically as the borate complex, presumably through formation of borate complexes with hydroxyl groups on the sugar side chains. Antifreeze glycoprotein (5 mg/ml) has been found to be completely active in the presence of 0.1 M borate at pH 7, but inactive at pH 9. A titration curve of pH versus the antifreeze activity of glycoprotein (5 mg/ml) in 0.1 M borate showed a progressive decrease in antifreeze activity as the pH was increased. Concomitant with decreases in activity were increases in binding of borate. At pH 9.0, nearly 2 mol of borate were complexed per glycotripeptide. Ultracentrifuge analyses showed similar molecular weights and laser quasi-elastic light scattering showed similar diffusions at pH 7.0 and 9.0 in borate and in the absence of borate. The binding of borate, rather than a change in conformation, is thus directly related to the loss of antifreeze activity. Alkaline borate also decreased hemagglutinating activity of Osage orange lectin and decreased the inhibition of the activity by the antifreeze glycoproteins."
https://openalex.org/W126887463,"Riboflavin-requiring mutants of Saccharomyces cerevisiae are able to transport 14C-labeled riboflavin into the cell, although no significant transport is seen in commercial yeast or in the parent strain from which the mutants were derived. Transport activity is greatest in the early to mid-log phase of anaerobic growth and declines sharply in the late log phase. In aerobically grown cells activity is substantially lower at all stages of growth. In the assay devised for its measurement, transport activity shows a sharp pH optimum at pH 7.5, a strong temperature dependence (EA = 23,100 cal/mol), and saturation kinetics with respect to riboflavin (Km = 15 muM), characteristics consistent with a carrier-mediated mechanism. Monovalent inorganic cations, particularly K+ and Rb+, stimulate riboflavin uptake, while certain organic cations are inhibitory. Besides riboflavin only 7-methylriboflavin, 8-methylriboflavin, and 5-deazaflavin have been found to serve as substrates, while lumiflavin, tetraacetylriboflavin, and N10-[4'-carboxybutyl]-7,8-dimethylisoalloxazine do not, although a number of flavin analogs in which the ribityl side chain is modified are good competitive inhibitors of riboflavin uptake. Compounds resembling the ribityl side chain, such as sugars and sugar alcohols, do not inhibit. An apparent inhibition of uptake by D-glucose, D-mannose, and D-fructose, which develops in the course of assay, proved to result from stimulation of an opposing process, the release of riboflavin from the cells."

They were co-polymerized with a large excess of acrylamide (co-polymers PAm-1, PAm-3, and PAm-5) and with a large excess of acrylic acid (co-polymers PAc=1, PAc-3, and PCc-5). In addition, M-5 was co-polymerized with acrylamide containing 2.8 mol % of the hydrophobic monomer N-acrylyl-1-naphthylamine (co-polymer PAm-5N). The rates of the chymotrypsin-catalyzed hydrolysis of the nitroanilide groups of M-5 and the various co-polymers were determined over a range of pH. For some of the systems data were also obtained over a range of substrate concentrations to derive values for Vmax and Km. Results obtained with PAm-5 were found to be independent of the chain length of the co-polymer. At pH 7, 25 degrees and with 2.7 X 10(-6) M enzyme, Vmax values for M-5, PAm-k, PAm-5N, and PAc-5 were 5.5, 5.5, 10, and 3.6 X 10(-8) M/S, while Km values were 8.5, 16.5, 10, and 2.2 X 10(-5),respectively, With PAc-5, the pH activity profile was shifted to higher acidities as compared to the profiles obtained with M-5 and PAm-5. The susceptibility of the co-polymers to chymotrypsin attack decreases sharply with a decreasing spacing of the L-phenylalanine p-nitroanilide residue from the backbone of the polymer chains."

A brief discussion of the interpretation of binding isotherms is entered into and apparent binding constants are derived. The results indicate that the interpretations presented in the literature up to now are much too simple. There are, in contrast, multiple binding sites of oxytocin and vasopressin to the neurophysins and large temperature dependences of the number of sites and their binding constants. We find, in fact, that at 37 degrees the binding of neurohypophysial hormones to the supposed storage proteins is rather weak even at the pH of maximum binding."

https://openalex.org/W1575513758,"The histidine C-2 proton NMR titration curves of ribonuclease S-peptide (residues 1 to 20) and S-protein (residues 21 to 124) are reported. Although S-protein contains 3 histidine residues, four discrete resonances are observed to titrate. One of these arises from the equivalent histidine residues of unfolded S-protein. The variation in area of the four resonances indicate that there is a reversible pH-dependent equilibrium between the folded and unfolded forms of S-protein, with some unfolded material being present at most pH values. Two of the resonances of the folded S-protein can be assigned to 2 of the histidine residues, 48 and 105, from the close similarity of their titration curves to those in ribonuclease. These similarities indicate a homology of portions of the folded conformation of S-protein to that of ribonuclease in solution. These results indicate that the complete amino acid sequence is not required to produce a folded conformation similar to the native globular protein, and they appear to eliminate the possibility that proteins fold from their NH2 terminus during protein synthesis. The low pH inflection present in the titration curve assigned to histidine residue 48 in ribonuclease is absent from this curve in S-protein. This is consistent with our previous conclusion that this inflection arises from the interaction of histidine 48 with aspartic acid residue 14, which is also absent in S-protein. The third titrating resonance of native S-protein is assigned to the remaining histidine residue at position 119. The properties of this resonance are not identical with either of the titration curves of the active site histidine residues 12 and 119 of ribonuclease. The resonance assigned to histidine 119 is the only one significantly affected on the addition of sodium phosphate to S-protein, indicating that some degree of phosphate binding occurs. In both the absence and presence of phosphate this curve also lacks the low pH inflection observed in the histidine 119 NMR titration curve in ribonuclease. This difference presumably arise from a conformational between ribonuclease and the folded S-protein involving a carboxyl group."

https://openalex.org/W1557530310,"The biotin carboxyl carrier protein (BCCP) component of Escherichia coli acetyl coenzyme A carboxylase and three peptides derived from BCCP by proteolytic digestion have been examined by circular dichroism spectroscopy. BCCP, which has a peptide molecular weight of 22,500, has a spectrum typical of globular proteins with negative extrema at 222 nm and 208 nm. The two smallest peptides, BCCP(SC) and BCCP(9,100), with molecular weights of 8,900 and 9,100, respectively, exhibit unusual positive CD bands centered at 237 nm and 220 nm. BCCP(10,400), with a molecular weight of 10,400, has a CD spectrum intermediate between BCCP and that of the smallest peptides. Since d-biotin exhibits a positive CD band at 233 nm, it was suspected that the biotin prosthetic group might be the chromophore responsible for the 237 nm CD band seen in BCCP(SC) and BCCP(9,100). Enzymatic carboxylation of BCCP(SC) to form CO2-BCCP(SC) caused the CD spectrum to change with a shift of the 237 nm band to 232 nm. The positive CD band at 220 nm was unaffected by carboxylation of the biotin prosthetic group. These date suggest that the 237 nm signal may be due either to the biotin which acts as a chromophore directly or to a chromophore that is perturbed by the carboxylation of biotin. A spectropolarimetric titration was carried out to investigate the possible contribution of the single tyrosine residue of BCCP(SC) to the CD spectrum of this peptide. At pH values over 9 the CD spetrum changed with the disappearance of the 237 nm band, suggesting that tyrosine might contribute to this CD band. Denaturation of BCCP(SC) or BCCP(9,100) with 8 M urea of 6 M guanidine HCl abolished the positive CD bands and resulted in spectra typical of a random coil, whereas treatment of BCCP(SC) with 1% sodium dodecyl sulfate abolished the positive bands and left a spectrum exhibiting a shoulder at 222 nm and a negative band at 205 nm, suggestive of a high degree of ordered structure. It is concluded that the CD band at 237 nm in BCCP(SC) and BCCP(9,100) is prabably due to a noncovalent interaction of biotin with an amino acid residue(s) of the protein. It is suggested that the biotin prosthetic group is partially buried in the surface of the protein, rather than swinging free at the end of the lysine side chain through which it is covalently linked to the protein, to permit this interaction to occur."
https://openalex.org/W1502377111,"Phosphypyridoxyl trifluoroethylamine has been synthesized as an active site-directed 19F NMR probe for aspartate transaminase. This coenzyme derivative adds stoichiometrically to the apotransaminase as observed by both fluorescence and circular dichroism measurements. The fluorinated phosphypyridoxamine derivative, when bound to the apotransaminase, will not dissociate upon extensive dialysis or passage through Sephadex G-25. The compound behaves as a pyridoxamine phosphate derivative and not as a coenzyme-substrate complex, since both competing anions and dicarboxylic acid inhibitors still bind to the phosphopyridoxyl trifluoroethylamine enzyme. The 19F NMR spectra of the enzyme-bound phosphopyridoxyl trifluoroethylamine were measured as a function of pH, ionic strength, and temperature. The 19F MNR of the enzyme-bound coenzyme derivative revealed no predetermined asymmetry in the subunits of aspartate transaminase insolution in terms of differences in chemical shift or resonance line shape between the two environments. A pH-dependent chemical shift change of the single 19F resonance was observed, which is consistent with the influence of a single ionization with an apparent pKa of 8.4 in 0.10 M KCl at 30 degrees. Increasing the ionic strength resulted in increasing values for the observed pKa, the highest recorded value was 9.1 in 3.0 M KCl. The temperature dependence of the pH titration of the chemical shift gives deltaH' of ionization of 10.5 kcal/mol. The evidence suggests a possible epsilon-amino group, electrostatically affected by positive charges, being responsible for the titration effect of the active site-bound fluorine derivative of pyridoxamine phosphate."
