https://openalex.org/W3006010054,"The mechanics of the cellular microenvironment continuously modulates cell functions such as growth, survival, apoptosis, differentiation and morphogenesis via cytoskeletal remodelling and actomyosin contractility1-3. Although all of these processes consume energy4,5, it is unknown whether and how cells adapt their metabolic activity to variable mechanical cues. Here we report that the transfer of human bronchial epithelial cells from stiff to soft substrates causes a downregulation of glycolysis via proteasomal degradation of the rate-limiting metabolic enzyme phosphofructokinase (PFK). PFK degradation is triggered by the disassembly of stress fibres, which releases the PFK-targeting E3 ubiquitin ligase tripartite motif (TRIM)-containing protein 21 (TRIM21). Transformed non-small-cell lung cancer cells, which maintain high glycolytic rates regardless of changing environmental mechanics, retain PFK expression by downregulating TRIM21, and by sequestering residual TRIM21 on a stress-fibre subset that is insensitive to substrate stiffness. Our data reveal a mechanism by which glycolysis responds to architectural features of the actomyosin cytoskeleton, thus coupling cell metabolism to the mechanical properties of the surrounding tissue. These processes enable normal cells to tune energy production in variable microenvironments, whereas the resistance of the cytoskeleton in response to mechanical cues enables the persistence of high glycolytic rates in cancer cells despite constant alterations of the tumour tissue."
https://openalex.org/W3006566345,"Multiple sclerosis is a chronic inflammatory disease of the CNS1. Astrocytes contribute to the pathogenesis of multiple sclerosis2, but little is known about the heterogeneity of astrocytes and its regulation. Here we report the analysis of astrocytes in multiple sclerosis and its preclinical model experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) by single-cell RNA sequencing in combination with cell-specific Ribotag RNA profiling, assay for transposase-accessible chromatin with sequencing (ATAC–seq), chromatin immunoprecipitation with sequencing (ChIP–seq), genome-wide analysis of DNA methylation and in vivo CRISPR–Cas9-based genetic perturbations. We identified astrocytes in EAE and multiple sclerosis that were characterized by decreased expression of NRF2 and increased expression of MAFG, which cooperates with MAT2α to promote DNA methylation and represses antioxidant and anti-inflammatory transcriptional programs. Granulocyte–macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) signalling in astrocytes drives the expression of MAFG and MAT2α and pro-inflammatory transcriptional modules, contributing to CNS pathology in EAE and, potentially, multiple sclerosis. Our results identify candidate therapeutic targets in multiple sclerosis. Single-cell RNA sequencing of cells from humans with multiple sclerosis and mice with a model of the disease identifies a population of disease-promoting astrocytes in which anti-oxidant and anti-inflammatory proteins are suppressed."
https://openalex.org/W3005855303,"The solid tumour microenvironment includes nerve fibres that arise from the peripheral nervous system1,2. Recent work indicates that newly formed adrenergic nerve fibres promote tumour growth, but the origin of these nerves and the mechanism of their inception are unknown1,3. Here, by comparing the transcriptomes of cancer-associated trigeminal sensory neurons with those of endogenous neurons in mouse models of oral cancer, we identified an adrenergic differentiation signature. We show that loss of TP53 leads to adrenergic transdifferentiation of tumour-associated sensory nerves through loss of the microRNA miR-34a. Tumour growth was inhibited by sensory denervation or pharmacological blockade of adrenergic receptors, but not by chemical sympathectomy of pre-existing adrenergic nerves. A retrospective analysis of samples from oral cancer revealed that p53 status was associated with nerve density, which was in turn associated with poor clinical outcomes. This crosstalk between cancer cells and neurons represents mechanism by which tumour-associated neurons are reprogrammed towards an adrenergic phenotype that can stimulate tumour progression, and is a potential target for anticancer therapy."
https://openalex.org/W3006633140,"The intestinal mucosa serves both as a conduit for the uptake of food-derived nutrients and microbiome-derived metabolites, and as a barrier that prevents tissue invasion by microorganisms and tempers inflammatory responses to the myriad contents of the lumen. How the intestine coordinates physiological and immune responses to food consumption to optimize nutrient uptake while maintaining barrier functions remains unclear. Here we show in mice how a gut neuronal signal triggered by food intake is integrated with intestinal antimicrobial and metabolic responses that are controlled by type-3 innate lymphoid cells (ILC3)1-3. Food consumption rapidly activates a population of enteric neurons that express vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP)4. Projections of VIP-producing neurons (VIPergic neurons) in the lamina propria are in close proximity to clusters of ILC3 that selectively express VIP receptor type 2 (VIPR2; also known as VPAC2). Production of interleukin (IL)-22 by ILC3, which is upregulated by the presence of commensal microorganisms such as segmented filamentous bacteria5-7, is inhibited upon engagement of VIPR2. As a consequence, levels of antimicrobial peptide derived from epithelial cells are reduced but the expression of lipid-binding proteins and transporters is increased8. During food consumption, the activation of VIPergic neurons thus enhances the growth of segmented filamentous bacteria associated with the epithelium, and increases lipid absorption. Our results reveal a feeding- and circadian-regulated dynamic neuroimmune circuit in the intestine that promotes a trade-off between innate immune protection mediated by IL-22 and the efficiency of nutrient absorption. Modulation of this pathway may therefore be effective for enhancing resistance to enteropathogens2,3,9 and for the treatment of metabolic diseases."

https://openalex.org/W3006502081,"Eukaryotic cell biology depends on cullin–RING E3 ligase (CRL)-catalysed protein ubiquitylation1, which is tightly controlled by the modification of cullin with the ubiquitin-like protein NEDD82–6. However, how CRLs catalyse ubiquitylation, and the basis of NEDD8 activation, remain unknown. Here we report the cryo-electron microscopy structure of a chemically trapped complex that represents the ubiquitylation intermediate, in which the neddylated CRL1β-TRCP promotes the transfer of ubiquitin from the E2 ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme UBE2D to its recruited substrate, phosphorylated IκBα. NEDD8 acts as a nexus that binds disparate cullin elements and the RING-activated ubiquitin-linked UBE2D. Local structural remodelling of NEDD8 and large-scale movements of CRL domains converge to juxtapose the substrate and the ubiquitylation active site. These findings explain how a distinctive ubiquitin-like protein alters the functions of its targets, and show how numerous NEDD8-dependent interprotein interactions and conformational changes synergistically configure a catalytic CRL architecture that is both robust, to enable rapid ubiquitylation of the substrate, and fragile, to enable the subsequent functions of cullin–RING proteins. A cryo-electron microscopy structure provides insights into the activation of cullin–RING E3 ligases by NEDD8 and the consequent catalysis of ubiquitylation reactions."
https://openalex.org/W3005574648,"Coeliac disease is a complex, polygenic inflammatory enteropathy caused by exposure to dietary gluten that occurs in a subset of genetically susceptible individuals who express either the HLA-DQ8 or HLA-DQ2 haplotypes1,2. The need to develop non-dietary treatments is now widely recognized3, but no pathophysiologically relevant gluten- and HLA-dependent preclinical model exists. Furthermore, although studies in humans have led to major advances in our understanding of the pathogenesis of coeliac disease4, the respective roles of disease-predisposing HLA molecules, and of adaptive and innate immunity in the development of tissue damage, have not been directly demonstrated. Here we describe a mouse model that reproduces the overexpression of interleukin-15 (IL-15) in the gut epithelium and lamina propria that is characteristic of active coeliac disease, expresses the predisposing HLA-DQ8 molecule, and develops villous atrophy after ingestion of gluten. Overexpression of IL-15 in both the epithelium and the lamina propria is required for the development of villous atrophy, which demonstrates the location-dependent central role of IL-15 in the pathogenesis of coeliac disease. In addition, CD4+ T cells and HLA-DQ8 have a crucial role in the licensing of cytotoxic T cells to mediate intestinal epithelial cell lysis. We also demonstrate a role for the cytokine interferon-γ (IFNγ) and the enzyme transglutaminase 2 (TG2) in tissue destruction. By reflecting the complex interaction between gluten, genetics and IL-15-driven tissue inflammation, this mouse model provides the opportunity to both increase our understanding of coeliac disease, and develop new therapeutic strategies. An HLA- and gluten-dependent mouse model of coeliac disease with villous atrophy provides evidence for the cooperative role of IL-15 and gluten-specific CD4+ T cells in licensing the full activation of cytotoxic T cells that are necessary for inducing epithelial damage."
https://openalex.org/W3006676863,"The mammalian claustrum, owing to its widespread connectivity with other forebrain structures, has been hypothesized to mediate functions that range from decision-making to consciousness1. Here we report that a homologue of the claustrum, identified by single-cell transcriptomics and viral tracing of connectivity, also exists in a reptile-the Australian bearded dragon Pogona vitticeps. In Pogona, the claustrum underlies the generation of sharp waves during slow-wave sleep. The sharp waves, together with superimposed high-frequency ripples2, propagate to the entire neighbouring pallial dorsal ventricular ridge (DVR). Unilateral or bilateral lesions of the claustrum suppress the production of sharp-wave ripples during slow-wave sleep in a unilateral or bilateral manner, respectively, but do not affect the regular and rapidly alternating sleep rhythm that is characteristic of sleep in this species3. The claustrum is thus not involved in the generation of the sleep rhythm itself. Tract tracing revealed that the reptilian claustrum projects widely to a variety of forebrain areas, including the cortex, and that it receives converging inputs from, among others, areas of the mid- and hindbrain that are known to be involved in wake-sleep control in mammals4-6. Periodically modulating the concentration of serotonin in the claustrum, for example, caused a matching modulation of sharp-wave production there and in the neighbouring DVR. Using transcriptomic approaches, we also identified a claustrum in the turtle Trachemys scripta, a distant reptilian relative of lizards. The claustrum is therefore an ancient structure that was probably already present in the brain of the common vertebrate ancestor of reptiles and mammals. It may have an important role in the control of brain states owing to the ascending input it receives from the mid- and hindbrain, its widespread projections to the forebrain and its role in sharp-wave generation during slow-wave sleep."

https://openalex.org/W3005707655,"Background Infant cognitive development is influenced by maternal factors that range from obesity to early feeding and breast milk composition. Animal studies suggest a role for human milk oligosaccharide (HMO), 2’-fucosyllactose (2’FL), on learning and memory, yet no human studies have examined its impact on infant cognitive development relative to other HMOs and maternal factors. Objective To determine the impact of 2’FL from breast milk feeding on infant cognitive development at 24 months of age relative to maternal obesity and breast milk feeding frequency. Methods and materials Hispanic mother-infant pairs (N = 50) were recruited across the spectrum of pre-pregnancy BMI. Breast milk was collected at 1 and 6 months, and feedings/day were reported. Nineteen HMOs were analyzed using high-performance liquid chromatography, with initial interest in 2’FL. Infant cognitive development score was assessed with the Bayley-III Scale at 24 months. Linear regressions were used for prediction, and bootstrapping to determine mediation by 2’FL. Results Maternal pre-pregnancy BMI was not related to feedings/day or HMOs, but predicted poorer infant cognitive development (β = -0.31, P = 0.03). Feedings/day (β = 0.34) and 2’FL (β = 0.59) at 1 month predicted better infant cognitive development (both P≤ 0.01). The association of feedings/day with infant cognitive development was no longer significant after further adjustment for 2’FL (estimated mediation effect = 0.13, P = 0.04). There were no associations of feedings/day and 2’FL at 6 months with infant cognitive development. Conclusions Our findings suggest that maternal factors influence infant cognitive development through multiple means. Though maternal obesity may be a separate negative influence, greater frequency of breast milk feeding at 1 month contributed to infant cognitive development through greater exposure to 2’FL relative to other HMOs. The influence of 2’FL was not significant at 6 months, indicating that early exposure to 2’FL may be a critical temporal window for positively influencing infant cognitive development."
https://openalex.org/W3005991537,"Patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) develop resistance to antitumor agents by mechanisms that involve the epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT). This necessitates the development of new complementary drugs, e.g., cannabinoid receptors (CB1 and CB2) agonists including tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) and cannabidiol (CBD). The combined use of THC and CBD confers greater benefits, as CBD enhances the effects of THC and reduces its psychotropic activity. We assessed the relationship between the expression levels of CB1 and CB2 to the clinical features of a cohort of patients with NSCLC, and the effect of THC and CBD (individually and in combination) on proliferation, EMT and migration in vitro in A549, H460 and H1792 lung cancer cell lines.Expression levels of CB1, CB2, EGFR, CDH1, CDH2 and VIM were evaluated by quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction. THC and CBD (10-100 μM), individually or in combination (1:1 ratio), were used for in vitro assays. Cell proliferation was determined by BrdU incorporation assay. Morphological changes in the cells were visualized by phase-contrast and fluorescence microscopy. Migration was studied by scratch recolonization induced by 20 ng/ml epidermal growth factor (EGF).The tumor samples were classified according to the level of expression of CB1, CB2, or both. Patients with high expression levels of CB1, CB2, and CB1/CB2 showed increased survival reaching significance for CB1 and CB1/CB2 (p = 0.035 and 0.025, respectively). Both cannabinoid agonists inhibited the proliferation and expression of EGFR in lung cancer cells, and CBD potentiated the effect of THC. THC and CBD alone or in combination restored the epithelial phenotype, as evidenced by increased expression of CDH1 and reduced expression of CDH2 and VIM, as well as by fluorescence analysis of cellular cytoskeleton. Finally, both cannabinoids reduced the in vitro migration of the three lung cancer cells lines used.The expression levels of CB1 and CB2 have a potential use as markers of survival in patients with NSCLC. THC and CBD inhibited the proliferation and expression of EGFR in the lung cancer cells studied. Finally, the THC/CBD combination restored the epithelial phenotype in vitro."
https://openalex.org/W3006276505,"The activation of adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK) in skeletal muscle coordinates systemic metabolic responses to exercise1. Autophagy—a lysosomal degradation pathway that maintains cellular homeostasis2—is upregulated during exercise, and a core autophagy protein, beclin 1, is required for AMPK activation in skeletal muscle3. Here we describe a role for the innate immune-sensing molecule Toll-like receptor 9 (TLR9)4, and its interaction with beclin 1, in exercise-induced activation of AMPK in skeletal muscle. Mice that lack TLR9 are deficient in both exercise-induced activation of AMPK and plasma membrane localization of the GLUT4 glucose transporter in skeletal muscle, but are not deficient in autophagy. TLR9 binds beclin 1, and this interaction is increased by energy stress (glucose starvation and endurance exercise) and decreased by a BCL2 mutation3,5 that blocks the disruption of BCL2–beclin 1 binding. TLR9 regulates the assembly of the endolysosomal phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase complex (PI3KC3-C2)—which contains beclin 1 and UVRAG—in skeletal muscle during exercise, and knockout of beclin 1 or UVRAG inhibits the cellular AMPK activation induced by glucose starvation. Moreover, TLR9 functions in a muscle-autonomous fashion in ex vivo contraction-induced AMPK activation, glucose uptake and beclin 1–UVRAG complex assembly. These findings reveal a heretofore undescribed role for a Toll-like receptor in skeletal-muscle AMPK activation and glucose metabolism during exercise, as well as unexpected crosstalk between this innate immune sensor and autophagy proteins. In mice, the interaction of the innate immune sensor TLR9 with beclin 1 is shown to have a role in glucose metabolism and AMPK activation in skeletal muscle during exercise."
https://openalex.org/W3005769446,"Patients with severe infections and especially sepsis have a high in-hospital mortality, but even hospital survivors face long-term sequelae, decreased health-related quality of life, and high risk of death, suggesting a great need for specialized aftercare. However, data regarding a potential benefit of post-discharge rehabilitation in these patients are scarce. In this retrospective matched cohort study the claim data of a large German statutory health care insurer was analyzed. 83,974 hospital survivors having suffered from septic shock, sepsis, and severe infections within the years 2009–2016 were identified using an ICD abstraction strategy closely matched to the current Sepsis-3 definition. Cases were analyzed and compared with their matched pairs to determine their 5-year mortality and the impact of post-discharge rehabilitation. Five years after hospital discharge, mortality of initial hospital survivors were still increased after septic shock (HRadj 2.03, 95%-CI 1.87 to 2.19; P<0.001), sepsis (HRadj 1.73, 95%-CI 1.71 to 1.76; P<0.001), and also in survivors of severe infections without organ dysfunction (HRadj 1.70, 95%-CI 1.65 to 1.74; P<0.001) compared to matched controls without infectious diseases. Strikingly, patients treated in rehabilitation facilities showed a significantly improved 5-year survival after suffering from sepsis or septic shock (HRadj 0.81, 95%-CI 0.77 to 0.85; P<0.001) as well as severe infections without organ dysfunction (HRadj 0.81, 95%-CI 0.73 to 0.90; P<0.001) compared to matched patients discharged to home or self-care. Long-term mortality and morbidity of hospital survivors are markedly increased after septic shock, sepsis and severe infections without organ dysfunction, but best 5-year survival was recorded in patients discharged to a rehabilitation facility in all three groups. Thus, our data suggest that specialized aftercare programs may help to improve long-term outcome in these patients and warrants more vigilance in future investigations."
https://openalex.org/W3006409400,"In vivo measurements of muscle architecture (i.e. the spatial arrangement of muscle fascicles) are routinely included in research and clinical settings to monitor muscle structure, function and plasticity. However, in most cases such measurements are performed manually, and more reliable and time-efficient automated methods are either lacking completely, or are inaccessible to those without expertise in image analysis. In this work, we propose an ImageJ script to automate the entire analysis process of muscle architecture in ultrasound images: Simple Muscle Architecture Analysis (SMA). Images are filtered in the spatial and frequency domains with built-in commands and external plugins to highlight aponeuroses and fascicles. Fascicle dominant orientation is then computed in regions of interest using the OrientationJ plugin. Bland-Altman plots of analyses performed manually or with SMA indicate that the automated analysis does not induce any systematic bias and that both methods agree equally through the range of measurements. Our test results illustrate the suitability of SMA to analyse images from superficial muscles acquired with a broad range of ultrasound settings."
https://openalex.org/W3006268959,"Epidemiological studies have suggested a link between vitamin D deficiency and increased risk for nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD); however, the underlying mechanisms have remained unclear. Here, using both clinical samples and experimental rodent models along with several biochemical approaches, we explored the specific effects and mechanisms of vitamin D deficiency in NAFLD pathology. Serum vitamin D levels were significantly lower in individuals with NAFLD and in high-fat diet (HFD)-fed mice than in healthy controls and chow-fed mice, respectively. Vitamin D supplementation ameliorated HFD-induced hepatic steatosis and insulin resistance in mice. Hepatic expression of vitamin D receptor (VDR) was up-regulated in three models of NAFLD, including HFD-fed mice, methionine/choline-deficient diet (MCD)-fed mice, and genetically obese (ob/ob) mice. Liver-specific <i>VDR</i> deletion significantly exacerbated HFD- or MCD-induced hepatic steatosis and insulin resistance and also diminished the protective effect of vitamin D supplementation on NAFLD. Mechanistic experiments revealed that VDR interacted with hepatocyte nuclear factor 4 α (HNF4α) and that overexpression of HNF4α improved HFD-induced NAFLD and metabolic abnormalities in liver-specific VDR-knockout mice. These results suggest that vitamin D ameliorates NAFLD and metabolic abnormalities by activating hepatic VDR, leading to its interaction with HNF4α. Our findings highlight a potential value of using vitamin D for preventing and managing NAFLD by targeting VDR."
https://openalex.org/W3005576604,"Recent literature emphasizes the importance of comfort in the design of exosuits and other assistive devices that physically augment humans; however, there is little quantitative data to aid designers in determining what level of force makes users uncomfortable. To help close this knowledge gap, we characterized human comfort limits when applying forces to the shoulders, thigh and shank. Our objectives were: (i) characterize the comfort limits for multiple healthy participants, (ii) characterize comfort limits across days, and (iii) determine if comfort limits change when forces are applied at higher vs. lower rates. We performed an experiment (N = 10) to quantify maximum tolerable force pulling down on the shoulders, and axially along the thigh and shank; we termed this force the comfort limit. We applied a series of forces of increasing magnitude, using a robotic actuator, to soft sleeves around their thigh and shank, and to a harness on their shoulders. Participants were instructed to press an off-switch, immediately removing the force, when they felt uncomfortable such that they did not want to feel a higher level of force. On average, participants exhibited comfort limits of ~0.9-1.3 times body weight on each segment: 621±245 N (shoulders), 867±296 N (thigh), 702±220 N (shank), which were above force levels applied by exosuits in prior literature. However, individual participant comfort limits varied greatly (~250-1200 N). Average comfort limits increased over multiple days (p<3e-5), as users habituated, from ~550-700 N on the first day to ~650-950 N on the fourth. Specifically, comfort limits increased 20%, 35% and 22% for the shoulders, thigh and shank, respectively. Finally, participants generally tolerated higher force when it was applied more rapidly. These results provide initial benchmarks for exosuit designers and end-users, and pave the way for exploring comfort limits over larger time scales, within larger samples and in different populations."
https://openalex.org/W3006173949,"Introduction Cancer is a major public health concern in terms of morbidity and mortality worldwide. Several types of cancer patients suffer from chronic comorbid conditions that are a major clinical challenge for treatment and cancer management. The main objective of this study was to investigate the distribution of the burden of chronic comorbid conditions and associated predictors among cancer patients in Australia over the period of 2007–2017. Methods The study employed a prospective longitudinal design using data from the Household, Income and Labour Dynamics in Australia survey. The number of chronic comorbid conditions was measured for each respondent. The longitudinal effect was captured using a fixed-effect negative binomial regression model, which predicted the potential factors that played a significant role in the occurrence of chronic comorbid conditions. Results Sixty-one percent of cancer patients experienced at least one chronic disease over the period, and 21% of patients experienced three or more chronic diseases. Age (>65 years old) (incidence rate ratio, IRR = 1.15; 95% confidence interval, CI: 1.05, 1.40), inadequate levels of physical activity (IRR = 1.25; 95% CI: 1.09, 1.59), patients who suffered from extreme health burden (IRR = 2.30; 95% CI: 1.73, 3.05) or moderate health burden (IRR = 1.90; 95% CI: 1.45, 2.48), and patients living in the poorest households (IRR = 1.21; 95% CI: 1.11, 1.29) were significant predictors associated with a higher risk of chronic comorbid conditions. Conclusions A large number of cancer patients experience an extreme burden of chronic comorbid conditions and the different dimensions of these in cancer survivors have the potential to affect the trajectory of their cancer burden. It is also significant for health care providers, including physical therapists and oncologists, who must manage the unique problems that challenge this population and who should advocate for prevention and evidence-based interventions."
https://openalex.org/W3005543312,"Phytophthora blight caused by Phytophthora capsici is a devastating disease for melon plant. However, the underlying resistance mechanisms are still poorly understood. In this study, the transcriptome differences between the resistant ZQK9 and susceptible E31 at 0, 3, and 5 days post-inoculation (dpi) were identified by RNA-seq. A total of 1,195 and 6,595 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified in ZQK9 and E31, respectively. P. capsici infection triggered massive transcript changes in the inoculated tissues. Genes related to plant defense responses were activated, which was reflected by a lot of up-regulated DEGs involved in pathogenesis-related (PR) genes, hormones biosynthesis and signal transduction, secondary metabolites biosynthesis and cell wall modification in resistant ZQK9. The dataset generated in this study may provide a basis for identifying candidate resistant genes in melon against P. capsici and lay a foundation for further research on the molecular mechanisms."
https://openalex.org/W3006269062,"Aspergillus tubingensis is an important pathogen of economically important crops. Different biotic stresses strongly influence the balance of metabolites in plants. The aim of this study was to understand the function and response of resistance associated metabolites which, in turn are involved in many secondary metabolomics pathways to influence defense mechanism of cotton plant. Analysis of non-targeted metabolomics using ultra high performance liquid chromatography–mass spectrometry (UPLC-MS) revealed abundant accumulation of key metabolites including flavonoids, phenylpropanoids, terpenoids, fatty acids and carbohydrates, in response to leaf spot of cotton. The principal component analysis (PCA), orthogonal partial least squares discriminant analysis (OPLS-DA) and partial least squares discriminant analysis (PLS-DA) score plots illustrated the evidences of variation between two varieties of cotton under mock and pathogen inoculated treatments. Primary metabolism was affected by the up regulation of pyruvate and malate and by the accumulation of carbohydrates like cellobiose and inulobiose. Among 241 resistance related (RR) metabolites, 18 were identified as resistance related constitutive (RRC) and 223 as resistance related induced (RRI) metabolites. Several RRI metabolites, identified in the present study were the precursors for many secondary metabolic pathways. These included phenylpropanoids (stilbenes and furanocoumarin), flavonoids (phlorizin and kaempferol), alkaloids (indolizine and acetylcorynoline) and terpenoids (azelaic acid and oleanolic acid). Our results demonstrated that secondary metabolism, primary metabolism and energy metabolism were more active in resistant cultivar, as compared to sensitive cultivar. Differential protein and fatty acid metabolism was also depicted in both cultivars. Accumulation of these defense related metabolites in resistant cotton cultivar and their suppression in susceptible cotton cultivar revealed the reason of their respective tolerance and susceptibility against A. tubingensis."
https://openalex.org/W3006077094,"Background Frequent emergency department users are patients cumulating at least four visits per year. Few studies have focused on persistent frequent users, who maintain their frequent user status for multiple consecutive years. This study targets an adult population with chronic conditions, and its aims are: 1) to estimate the prevalence of persistent frequent ED use; 2) to identify factors associated with persistent frequent ED use (frequent use for three consecutive years) and compare their importance with those associated with occasional frequent ED use (frequent use during the year following the index date); and 3) to compare characteristics of “persistent frequent users” to “occasional frequent users” and to “users other than persistent frequent users”. Methods This is a retrospective cohort study using Quebec administrative databases. All adult patients who visited the emergency department in 2012, diagnosed with chronic conditions, and living in non-remote areas were included. Patients who died in the three years following their index date were excluded. The main outcome was persistent frequent use (≥4 visits per year during three consecutive years). Potential predictors included sociodemographic characteristics, physical and mental comorbidities, and prior healthcare utilization. Odds ratios were computed using multivariable logistic regression. Results Out of 297,182 patients who visited ED at least once in 2012, 3,357 (1.10%) were persistent frequent users. Their main characteristics included poor socioeconomic status, mental and physical comorbidity, and substance abuse. Those characteristics were also present for occasional frequent users, although with higher percentages for the persistent user group. The number of previous visits to the emergency department was the most important factor in the regression model. The occasional frequent users’ attrition rate was higher between the first and second year of follow-up than between the second and third year. Conclusions Persistent frequent users are a subpopulation of frequent users with whom they share characteristics, such as physical and mental comorbidities, though the former are poorer and younger. More research is needed in order to better understand what factors can contribute to persistent frequent use."
https://openalex.org/W3006161850,"Abstract The homeotic protein SIX3 is a transcription factor vital for neurogenesis and has a bivalent promoter. We previously showed that SIX3 can be transcriptionally silenced by DNA hypermethylation, functions as a tumor suppressor gene, and inhibits human glioblastoma transcriptionally. Here, we show that the activation of epidermal growth factor (EGFR) induces DNA methylation of SIX3 promoter through the MAPK pathway. ERK, when activated, binds with ZNF263, consequently abrogating the ubiquitination of ZNF263 and leading to its stabilization. ZNF263 binds to the core promoter region of SIX3 and recruits the KAP1/HATS/DNMT corepressor complex to induce transcriptional silencing of SIX3 through H3K27me3 and methylation of SIX3 promoter. Activation of the EGFR-ZNF263 signaling axis in phenotypically normal astrocytes or glioblastoma cells triggers or enhances tumorigenic activities, while elevated expression of the EGFR-ZNF263 signaling components in glioblastoma tissues is associated with poor prognosis of the patients. Together, our findings demonstrate that epigenetic silencing of SIX3 is controlled by a sophisticated and highly ordered oncogenic signaling pathway and therefore provide new insights into initiation and progression of glioblastoma."
https://openalex.org/W3006180091,"To date, no comprehensive analysis of autoantibodies in sera of patients with ulcerative colitis has been conducted. To analyze the spectrum of autoantibodies and to elucidate their role serum-IgG from UC patients (n = 49) and non-UC donors (n = 23) were screened by using a human protein microarray. Screening yielded a remarkable number of 697 differentially-reactive at the nominal 0·01 significance level (FDR<0·1) of the univariate test between the UC and the non-UC group. CD99 emerged as a biomarker to discriminate between both groups (p = 1e-04, AUC = 0·8). In addition, cytokines, chemokines and growth factors were analyzed by Olink’s Proseek® Multiplex Inflammation-I 96×96 immuno-qPCR assay and 31 genes were significant at the nominal 0.05 level of the univariate test to discriminate between UC and non-UC donors. MCP-3, HGF and CXCL-9 were identified as the most significant markers to discriminate between UC patients with clinically active and inactive disease. Levels of CXCL10 (cor = 0.3; p = 0.02), CCL25 (cor = 0.25; p = 0.04) and CCL28 (cor = 0.3; p = 0.02) correlated positively with levels of anti CD99. To assess whether autoantibodies are detectable prior to diagnosis with UC, sera from nine donors at two different time points (T-early, median 21 months and T-late, median 6 months) were analyzed. 1201 features were identified with higher reactivity in samples at time points closer to clinical UC presentation. In vitro, additional challenge of peripheral mononuclear cells with CD99 did not activate CD4+ T cells but induced the secretion of IL-10 (-CD99: 20.21±20.25; +CD99: 130.20±89.55; mean ±sd; p = 0.015). To examine the effect of CD99 in vivo, inflammation and autoantibody levels were examined in NOD/ScidIL2Rγnull mice reconstituted with PBMC from UC donors (NSG-UC). Additional challenge with CD99 aggravated disease symptoms and pathological phenotype as indicated by the elevated clinical score (-CD99: 1·85 ± 1·94; +CD99: 4·25 ± 1·48) and histological score (-CD99: 2·16 ± 0·83; +CD99: 3·15 ± 1·16, p = 0·01). Furthermore, levels of anti-CD99 antibodies increased (Control: 398 ± 323; mean MFI ± sd; Ethanol + PBS: 358 ±316; Ethanol + CD99: 1363 ± 1336; Control versus Ethanol + CD99: p = 0.03). In a highly inflammatory environment, frequencies of pro-inflammatory M1 monocytes (CD14+ CD64+: unchallenged 8.09±4.72; challenged 14.2±8.62; p = 0.07; CD14+ CD1a+: unchallenged 16.29 ±6.97; challenged 43.81±14.4, p = 0.0003) increased and levels of autoantibodies in serum decreased in the NSG-UC mouse model. These results suggest that autoantibodies are potent biomarkers to discriminate between UC and non-UC and indicate risk to develop UC. In an inflammatory environment, auto-antibodies may promote the pathological phenotype by activating M1 monocytes in the NSG-UC animal model and also in patients with UC."
https://openalex.org/W3006214936,"Mutual help is common in human society, particularly during a disaster. The psychological processes underlying such social support are of interest in social and evolutionary psychology, as well as in the promotion of community resilience. However, research in terms of personality factors or support types is sporadic and has yet to address actual emergency situations. In this study, we analyzed survey data from survivors of the 2011 Tohoku earthquake and tsunami. The data included five types of social support occurring during the evacuation from a potential tsunami area: providing and receiving actual help and oral encouragement, as well as perceived support. The personality factor items included the Big Five dimensions and eight “power to live” factors, which were identified as advantageous for survival during this disaster. While none of the Big Five dimensions were associated with social support, six of the power to live factors were. Altruism, problem solving, etiquette, and self-transcendence contributed to the provision of actual help. Leadership and active well-being contributed to oral encouragement with the latter contributing also to perceived support. The findings were largely consistent with the literature in a non-emergency context. The relevance of the majority of these pro-survival personality factors to social support appeared to support the view that the propensity to cooperate in service of human survival in a disaster situation is primarily a social, rather than an individual, phenomenon, and encourages research on the mechanisms underlying how personality factors provide a benefit to both the individual and their community."

The effects of inorganic fertilizer reduction combined with Pennisetum giganteum z.x.lin mixed nitrogen-fixing biofertilizer on the growth, quality, soil nutrients and diversity of the soil bacterial community in the rhizosphere soil of pakchoi were studied. The experiment composed of 6 treatments, including CK (no fertilization), DL (10% inorganic fertilizer reduction combined with Pennisetum giganteum z.x.lin mixed nitrogen-fixing biofertilizer), ZL (25% inorganic fertilizer reduction combined with Pennisetum giganteum z.x.lin mixed nitrogen-fixing biofertilizer), SL (50% inorganic fertilizer reduction combined with Pennisetum giganteum z.x.lin mixed nitrogen-fixing biofertilizer), FHF (100% inorganic fertilizer) and JZ (100% inorganic fertilizer combined with sterilized Pennisetum giganteum z.x.lin mixed nitrogen-fixing biofertilizer). Compared with conventional fertilization, the 25% reduction in chemical fertilizer applied with the Pennisetum giganteum mixed nitrogen-fixing biofertilizer resulted in higher plant height, plant weight, chlorophyll content, soluble protein content, soluble sugar content, vitamin C content, alkali hydrolyzed nitrogen content, available phosphorus content, available potassium content and organic matter content in pakchoi, and these variables increased by 11.81%, 8.54%, 7.37%, 16.88%, 17.05%, 23.70%, 24.24%, 36.56%, 21.09% and 19.72%, respectively. In addition, the 25% reduction in chemical fertilizer applied with the Pennisetum giganteum mixed nitrogen-fixing biofertilizer also had the lowest nitrate content, which was 53.86% lower than that with conventional fertilization. Different fertilizer treatments had a significant effect on the soil bacterial community structure. Compared with conventional fertilization, the coapplication of Pennisetum giganteum z.x.lin mixed nitrogen-fixing biofertilizer and inorganic fertilizer significantly increased the relative abundance of Proteobacteria and Actinobacteria in the soil. The results of the redundancy analysis (RDA) showed that soil organic matter, alkali-hydrolyzed nitrogen, available phosphorus, available potassium, pH and water content had a specific impact on the soil bacterial community. Among the factors, soil water content was the main factor affecting the soil bacterial community, followed by soil organic matter, soil pH, available potassium, soil available phosphorus and soil alkali-hydrolyzed nitrogen."
https://openalex.org/W3006525479,"Urbanization modifies land surface characteristics with consequent impacts on local energy, water, and carbon dioxide (CO2) fluxes. Despite the disproportionate impact of cities on CO2 emissions, few studies have directly quantified CO2 conditions for different urban land cover patches, in particular for arid and semiarid regions. Here, we present a comparison of eddy covariance measurements of CO2 fluxes (FC) and CO2 concentrations ([CO2]) in four distinct urban patches in Phoenix, Arizona: a xeric landscaping, a parking lot, a mesic landscaping, and a suburban neighborhood. Analyses of diurnal, daily, and seasonal variations of FC and [CO2] were related to vegetation activity, vehicular traffic counts, and precipitation events to quantify differences among sites in relation to their urban land cover characteristics. We found that the mesic landscaping with irrigated turf grass was primarily controlled by plant photosynthetic activity, while the parking lot in close proximity to roads mainly exhibited the signature of vehicular emissions. The other two sites that had mixtures of irrigated vegetation and urban surfaces displayed an intermediate behavior in terms of CO2 fluxes. Precipitation events only impacted FC in urban patches without outdoor water use, indicating that urban irrigation decouples CO2 fluxes from the effects of infrequent storms in an arid climate. These findings suggest that the proportion of irrigated vegetation and urban surfaces fractions within urban patches could be used to scale up CO2 fluxes to a broader city footprint."
https://openalex.org/W3005870379,"To optimize patient education, it is important to understand what healthcare professionals perceive to be ideal oncology medication education for patients to receive, and what they feel is their role and the role of others in its delivery. Education provided to patients is an important component of chemotherapy as it has been shown to benefit and positively impact patients who receive it. Educational interventions are often provided by multidisciplinary teams with the goal of improving patient care. However, few studies have explored the roles of healthcare professionals in delivering oncology medication education.To explore the perspectives of healthcare professionals working in medical, gynaecological or hematological oncology to identify what they perceive to be optimal oncology medication education for patients.Healthcare professionals (physicians, nurses and pharmacists) working in medical, gynaecological or hematological oncology at the Nova Scotia Health Authority, Central Zone were invited to participate in one-on-one, semi-structured interviews which were audio-recorded, transcribed and analyzed using thematic analysis.Fifteen interviews, including five physicians, four nurses and six pharmacists were conducted from February to April 2018. Four major themes were identified: Delivery of oncology medication education, Facilitating the patient learning process, Multidisciplinary Approach and Understanding barriers to the healthcare professional in providing education.The identified themes uncovered novel ideas about how healthcare professionals felt oncology medication education could ideally be delivered to patients, and supported findings in the literature. Although participants discussed barriers to their ability to deliver optimal education, they also identified ways in which they can facilitate patient learning, for example, through the reinforcement of education. Participants recognized the importance of increasing collaboration and communication with the multidisciplinary team. This research will inform the design of any new models for oncology medication education at the Nova Scotia Health Authority, Central Zone and potentially other sites."
https://openalex.org/W3006644353,"Background An estimated 49.5 million children under five years of age are wasted. There is a lack of robust studies on effective interventions to prevent wasting. The aim of this study was to identify and prioritise the main outstanding research questions in relation to wasting prevention to inform future research agendas. Method A research prioritisation exercise was conducted following the Child Health and Nutrition Research Initiative method. Identified research gaps were compiled from multiple sources, categorised into themes and streamlined into forty research questions by an expert group. A survey was then widely circulated to assess research questions according to four criteria. An overall research priority score was calculated to rank questions. Findings The prioritised questions have a strong focus on interventions. The importance of the early stages of life in determining later experiences of wasting was highlighted. Other important themes included the identification of at-risk infants and young children early in the progression of wasting and the roles of existing interventions and the health system in prevention. Discussion These results indicate consensus to support more research on the pathways to wasting encompassing the in-utero environment, on the early period of infancy and on the process of wasting and its early identification. They also reinforce how little is known about impactful interventions for the prevention of wasting. Conclusion This exercise provides a five-year investment case for research that could most effectively improve on-the-ground programmes to prevent child wasting and inform supportive policy change."
https://openalex.org/W3005684952,"Background and aims Curative surgery saves ≈50% of all patients with colorectal cancer (CRC) while remaining patients have synchronous or will develop metachronous metastases. Presently, the single most important prognostic factor is histopathological detection of disseminated tumor cells in regional lymph nodes. However, the routine method has several limitations. The aim was to identify biomarker mRNAs that could be combined in a formula that would allow better prediction of patients' survival after surgery. Methods Screening for biomarker mRNAs overexpressed in CRC was performed by genome-wide hybridization bead array, with verification by qRT-PCR. Specific qRT-PCR assays with copy standards were developed for 5 selected genes and mRNA expression levels determined in lymph nodes from 174 CRC patients (517 nodes) and 24 control patients (118 nodes). Prognostic value of biomarker mRNAs was estimated. A cut-off was set using univariate Cox regression analysis and used for calculation of differences between patient groups in disease-free survival 12 years after surgery (Kaplan-Meier survival model) and risk for recurrent disease (Cox's regression analysis). A formula was constructed for evaluation of the prognostic value of the biomarkers in combination. Results Two new biomarkers, SLC35D3 and POSTN with prognostic value were identified. SLC35D3 was expressed in the epithelium derived tumor cells and POSTN in fibroblasts. Combined with CEACAM5, KLK6 and MUC2 they could be used to identify risk groups. A formula was constructed using CEACAM5 as denominator for KLK6, SLC35D3 and MUC2 and 18S rRNA as denominator for POSTN. The formula yielded 5 categories (-1, 0, 1, 2, 3). Categories (-1 and 0) had good prognosis, categories (1 and 2) relatively poor prognosis and category (3) very poor prognosis. Conclusion Lymph node analysis using 5 selected biomarker mRNAs and 18S rRNA in combination allowed allocation of CRC patients to different risk categories with respect to recurrent disease."
https://openalex.org/W3005852083,"The prevalence of skin lesions at the legs of dairy cows often serves as an indicator for animal welfare and is used as a measurement of adequacy of the present housing conditions. The aim of this study was to assess the prevalence of skin lesions at the carpus, tarsus, and stifle in Swiss dairy cows kept in tie stalls and to describe potential risk factors associated with the different types and severities thereof. Skin lesions and potential risk factors were assessed in 627 cows of 27 tie stall farms in a cross-sectional study. The associations of each outcome and the potential risk factors were assessed by means of logistic regression models using farm as the random factor. One odds ratio was obtained for each biologically relevant risk factor category and the final models were compared between the lesion types and locations. Tarsal lesions were recorded most frequently, with a prevalence of 62.2, 34.4, and 24.0% for moderate to severe hair loss, any severity of ulceration, and moderate to severe swelling, respectively. The prevalence of carpal lesions ranged from 54.4% for hair loss, over 7.7% for ulceration, to 6.1% for swelling, while stifle lesions were recorded less frequently with a prevalence of 18.6, 8.9, 3.4% for hair loss, ulceration, and swelling, respectively. The risk for various skin lesion types and locations significantly increased, when the concrete stall base was covered with a rubber mat and the bedding depth was low. Cows were at the lowest risk to develop skin lesions when they had more than 13 days of outdoor exercise per month. The prevalence of skin lesions in tied Swiss dairy cows is remarkably high and could possibly be reduced by providing the herd more frequent outdoor exercise and a well-cushioned, friction-absorbing and non-abrasive lying surface."
https://openalex.org/W3006230095,"Background Primary cutaneous CD30+ lymphoproliferative disorders (CD30CLPD) are the second most common type of cutaneous T cell lymphoma (CTCL) and include lymphomatoid papulosis (LyP) and primary cutaneous anaplastic large cell lymphoma (pcALCL). Case reports and small patient series suggest an association of CD30CLPD with atopic disorders. However, the prevalence of atopy in patients with CD30CLPD in retrospective studies depends on patients’ recall which is not always reliable. More objective criteria of atopy include evidence of skin reactivity to allergens (positive prick test) and evidence of allergen-specific IgE in serum. This study was undertaken to test the hypothesis that atopy is prevalent in patients with CD30CLPD using serologic criteria of allergen-specific IgE antibodies to aeroallergens and Staphylococcal aureus enterotoxin superantigens (SSAgs). Methods We tested serum samples of CD30CLPD for common IgE-specific airborne allergens with the Phadiatop test, which if positive, is regarded as serologic evidence of atopy in adults. Sera were also tested for IgE antibodies reactive to three Staphylococcal enterotoxins with superantigenic properties (SSAg-IgE). Control sera were obtained from adult subjects evaluated for rhino-sinusitis and a negative Phadiatop test. Patients’ history of an atopic disorder was obtained by retrospective chart review. Findings Nearly 50% of patients with the most common LyP types (A and C) had a positive Phadiatop test for allergic sensitization to common airborne allergens, and total serum IgE (IgE-t) was increased compared to non-atopic controls. At the IgE antibody concentration generally used to define serologic atopy (≥ 0.35 kUA/L), 8/31 (26%) samples of CD30CLPD and 7/28 (25%) samples of LyP were reactive to at least one SSAg-IgE compared to 3/52 (6%) control specimens (P = 0.016 and P = 0.028, respectively). TSST1-IgE was detected in 7 (23%) specimens of CD30CLPD, often together with SEB-IgE; SEA-IgE ≥ 0.35 kUA/L was not detected. For control specimens, TSST1-IgE exceeded the 0.35 kUA/L threshold in 3 (6%) specimens. Conclusions Patients with LyP types A and C have serologic evidence of atopy against common airborne antigens and SSAgs when compared to control adult subjects who had rhino-sinusitis and a negative Phadiatop test for aero-IgEs. Serologic evidence of atopy exceeded that determined by LyP patients’ personal history. The findings support our hypothesis that an atopic diathesis may contribute to the pathogenesis of the most common types of LyP (A and C)."
https://openalex.org/W3006566147,"There is a growing need to understand how species respond to habitat changes and the potential key role played by natal dispersal in population dynamics, structure and gene flow. However, few studies have explored differences in this process between conspecifics living in natural habitats and those inhabiting landscapes highly transformed by humans, such as cities. Here, we investigate how individual traits and social characteristics can influence the natal dispersal decisions of burrowing owls (Athene cunicularia) living in urban and rural areas, as well as the consequences in terms of reproductive success and apparent survival. We found short dispersal movements among individuals, with differences between urban and rural birds (i.e., the former covering shorter distances than the latter), maybe because of the higher conspecific density of urban compared to rural areas. Moreover, we found that urban and rural females as well as bold individuals (i.e., individuals with shorter flight initiation distance) exhibited longer dispersal distances than their counterparts. These dispersal decisions have effects on individual fitness. Individuals traveling longer distances increased their reproductive prospects (productivity during the first breeding attempt, and long term productivity). However, the apparent survival of females decreased when they dispersed farther from their natal territory. Although further research is needed to properly understand the ecological and evolutionary consequences of dispersal patterns in transformed habitats, our results provide information about the drivers and the consequences of the restricted natal movements of this species, which may explain its population structuring through restricted gene flow between and within urban and rural areas."
https://openalex.org/W3006598716,"The sodium-iodide symporter (NIS) mediates transport of iodide across the basolateral membrane of thyroid cells. NIS expression in thyroid cancer (TC) cells allows the use of radioactive iodine (RAI) as a diagnostic and therapeutic tool, being RAI therapy the systemic treatment of choice for metastatic disease. Still, a significant proportion of patients with advanced TC lose the ability to respond to RAI therapy and no effective alternative therapies are available. Defective NIS expression is the main reason for impaired iodide uptake in TC and NIS downregulation has been associated with several pathways linked to malignant transformation. NF-κB signaling is one of the pathways associated with TC. Interestingly, NIS expression can be negatively regulated by TNF-α, a bona fide activator of NF-κB with a central role in thyroid autoimmunity. This prompted us to clarify NF-kB's role in this process. We confirmed that TNF-α leads to downregulation of TSH-induced NIS expression in non-neoplastic thyroid follicular cell-derived models. Notably, a similar effect was observed when NF-κB activation was triggered independently of ligand-receptor specificity, using phorbol-myristate-acetate (PMA). TNF-α and PMA downregulation of NIS expression was reverted when NF-κB-dependent transcription was blocked, demonstrating the requirement for NF-kB activity. Additionally, TNF-α and PMA were shown to have a negative impact on TSH-induced iodide uptake, consistent with the observed transcriptional downregulation of NIS. Our data support the involvement of NF-κB-directed transcription in the modulation of NIS expression, where up- or down-regulation of NIS depends on the combined output to NF-κB of several converging pathways. A better understanding of the mechanisms underlying NIS expression in the context of normal thyroid physiology may guide the development of pharmacological strategies to increase the efficiency of iodide uptake. Such strategies would be extremely useful in improving the response to RAI therapy in refractory-TC."
https://openalex.org/W3006036505,"Jiaji Duck (JJ) is a Muscovy duck species that possesses many superior characteristics, and it has become an important genetic resource in China. However, to date, its genetic characteristics and genetic relationship with other duck breeds have not been explored yet, which greatly limits the utilization of JJ. In the present study, we investigated the genome sequences of 15 individual ducks representing five different duck populations, including JJ, French Muscovy duck (FF), mallard (YD), hong duck (HD) and Beijing duck (BD). Moreover, we investigated the characteristics of JJ-specific single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and compared the genome sequences of JJ vs. YD and JJ vs. BD using integrated strategies, including mutation detection, selective screening, and Gene Ontology (GO) analysis. More than 40 Gb of clean data were obtained for each population (mean coverage of 13.46 Gb per individual). A total number of 22,481,367 SNPs and 4,156,829 small insertion-deletions (Indels) were identified for the five duck populations, which could be used as molecular markers in breeding and utilization of JJ. Moreover, we identified 1,447,932 JJ-specific SNPs, and found that genes covering at least one JJ-specific SNP mainly involved in protein phosphorylation and dephosphorylation, as well as DNA modification. Phylogenetic tree and principal components analysis (PCA) revealed that the genetic relationship of JJ was closest to FF, while it was farthest to BD. A total of 120 and 111 genes were identified as positive selection genes for JJ vs. BD and JJ vs. YD, respectively. GO and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) analyses showed that the positive selection genes for JJ vs. BD ducks mainly involved in pigmentation, muscle contraction and stretch, gland secretion, and immunology, while the positive selection genes obtained from JJ vs. YD ducks mainly involved in embryo development, muscle contraction and stretch, and gland secretion. Taken together, our findings enabled us to better understand the characteristics of JJ and provided a molecular basis for the breeding and hybrid utilization of JJ in the future."

In this study we sought to assess the prevalence and correlates of PA among 1,542 Senior High School (SHS) students.A cross-sectional study was conducted in Ghana among SHS students using the 2012 version of the Ghana Global School-based Student Health Survey (GSHS) data, which utilised two-stage cluster sampling technique. The population for the study comprised SHS students. The outcome variable was physical activity. The data were analysed using STATA version 14.2 for Mac OS. Both bivariate and multivariate analyses were employed. At the bivariate level, Pearson chi-square test between each independent variable and PA was conducted and the level of statistical significance was set at 5%. All the significant variables from the chi-square test were selected for the multivariate analysis. In the multivariate analysis, Poisson regression with robust variance was performed to estimate crude and adjusted prevalence ratios (APR).It was found that 25.0% (29.0% males and 21.9% females) of SHS students were physically active. Female students (APR = 0.78, 95% CI = 0.65, 0.94), students in SHS 2 (APR = 0.76, 95% CI = 0.577, 0.941) and SHS3 (APR = 0.79, 95% CI = 0.63, 0.93), and those who went hungry (APR = 0.77, 95% CI = 0.65, 0.92) were less likely to be physically active compared to males, those in SHS1 and those who did not go hungry respectively. On the other hand, students who actively commuted to school (APR = 2.40, 95% CI = 1.72, 2.42) and got support from their peers were more likely to be physically active (APR = 1.62, 95% CI = 1.09-2.41).Only a quarter of SHS students who participated in the 2012 version of the GSHS met the WHO's recommended level of physical activity. Sex, grade/form and experience of hunger are associated with physical activity. Physical activity is a major component of any health promotion program. Policies and programmes targeting improvement in physical activity among SHS students should take these associated factors into consideration."
https://openalex.org/W3006486903,"When treating children with Cerebral Palsy (CP), computational simulations based on musculoskeletal models have a great potential in assisting the clinical decision-making process towards the most promising treatments. In particular, predictive simulations could be used to predict and compare the functional outcome of a series of candidate interventions. In order to be able to benefit from these predictive simulations however, it is important to know how much information about the post-treatment patient's motor control could be gathered from data available before the intervention. Within this paper, we quantified how much of the muscle activity measured after a treatment could be explained by subject-specific muscle synergies computed from EMG data collected before the intervention. We also investigated whether generic synergies could be used, in case no EMG data is available when running predictive simulations, to reproduce both pre- and post-treatment muscle activity in children with CP. Subject-specific synergies proved to be a good indicator of the patient's post-treatment motor control, explaining on average more than 85% of the post-treatment muscle activity, compared to an average of 94% when applied to the original pre-treatment data. Generic synergies explained 84% of the pre-treatment and 83% of the post-treatment muscle activity on average, but performed relatively well for patients with low selective motor control and poorly in patients with more selectivity. Our results suggest that subject-specific muscle synergies computed from pre-treatment EMG data could be used with confidence to represent the post-treatment motor control of children with CP during walking. In addition, when performing simulations involving patients with a low selective motor control, generic synergies could be a valid alternative."

Fast dispersible Aceclofenac formulations were developed by central composite design (CCD). Among them the best possible formulation was selected on the basis of micromeritic properties, appropriate tablet weight and disintegration time for further study. Tablets were directly compressed using manual hydraulic press with a compressional force ranging from 7.2 to 77.2 MN/m2. Pre and post compression studies were performed and the compressed formulations (FA-FF) were assessed for different quality tests. The Heckel and Kawakita equations were applied for determination of compressional behavior of formulations. The quality attributes suggested that formulation (FB) containing avicel PH 102 (20%), mannitol (25%) and ac-di-sol (3%) as best optimized formulation showing better mechanical strength i.e. hardness 35.40 ± 6.93N, tensile strength 0.963 MN/m2, and friability 0.68%. Furthermore, compressional analysis of FB showed lowest PY value 59.520 MN/m2 and Pk value 1.040 MN/m2 indicating plasticity of the material. Formulation FB disintegrated rapidly within 21 seconds and released 99.92% drug after 45 min in phosphate buffer pH 6.8. Results of drug release kinetics showed that all formulations followed Weibull and First-order models in three different dissolution media. Avicel PH102 based formulation mixture exhibit excellent compactional strength with rapid disintegration and quick drug release."
https://openalex.org/W3005586677,"The efflux pumps from the Resistance-Nodulation-Division family, RND, are main contributors to intrinsic antibiotic resistance in Gram-negative bacteria. Among this family, the MdtABC pump is unusual by having two inner membrane components. The two components, MdtB and MdtC are homologs, therefore it is evident that the two components arose by gene duplication. In this paper, we describe the results obtained from a phylogenetic analysis of the MdtBC pumps in the context of other RNDs. We show that the individual inner membrane components (MdtB and MdtC) are conserved throughout the Proteobacterial species and that their existence is a result of a single gene duplication. We argue that this gene duplication was an ancient event which occurred before the split of Proteobacteria into Alpha-, Beta- and Gamma- classes. Moreover, we find that the MdtABC pumps and the MexMN pump from Pseudomonas aeruginosa share a close common ancestor, suggesting the MexMN pump arose by another gene duplication event of the original Mdt ancestor. Taken together, these results shed light on the evolution of the RND efflux pumps and demonstrate the ancient origin of the Mdt pumps and suggest that the core bacterial efflux pump repertoires have been generally stable throughout the course of evolution."

One society required Board review, but not approval. The approval process was not reported by 2 (6%) of the specialty societies.Most medical specialty societies in the U.S. require approval of guidelines by a board that represents the society as whole.

https://openalex.org/W3006474456,"Studying personal identity, the continuity and sameness of persons across lifetimes, is notoriously difficult and competing conceptualizations exist within philosophy and psychology. Personal reidentification, linking persons between points in time is a fundamental step in allocating merit and blame and assigning rights and privileges. Based on Nozick’s (1981) closest continuer theory we develop a theoretical framework that explicitly invites a meaningful empirical approach and offers a constructive, integrative solution to current disputes about appropriate experiments. Following Nozick, reidentification involves judging continuers on a metric of continuity and choosing the continuer with the highest acceptable value on this metric. We explore both the metric and its implications for personal identity. Since James (1890), academic theories have variously attributed personal identity to the continuity of memories, psychology, bodies, social networks, and possessions. In our experiments, we measure how participants (N = 1, 525) weighted the relative contributions of these five dimensions in hypothetical fission accidents, in which a person was split into two continuers. Participants allocated compensation money (Study 1) or adjudicated inheritance claims (Study 2) and reidentified the original person. Most decided based on the continuity of memory, personality, and psychology, with some consideration given to the body and social relations. Importantly, many participants identified the original with both continuers simultaneously, violating the transitivity of identity relations. We discuss the findings and their relevance for philosophy and psychology and place our approach within the current theoretical and empirical landscape."
https://openalex.org/W3005913265,"We investigated the relation of 99mTc-MIBI uptake to mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) in cancer cell lines and patient-derived tumor cells (PDCs). In T47D and HT29 cells with low MDR1 expression, FCCP dose-dependently reduced MMP and 99mTc-MIBI accumulation in similar patterns with nearly perfect linear relationships. T47D and HT29 cells with high MDR1 expression had low 99mTc-MIBI accumulation that was minimally affected by FCCP dose. In these cells, verapamil markedly increased 99mTc-MIBI accumulation to magnitudes that were excessive compared to MMP increase. Decreased plasma membrane potential by verapamil and its recovery by FCCP suggested that enhanced 99mTc-MIBI transport through modified plasma membranes contributed to the excess accumulation. Evaluation of three different colon cancer PDCs with low to modest MDR1 expression verified that FCCP significantly suppressed MMP and similarly reduced 99mTc-MIBI accumulation. Verapamil partially recovered both MMP and 99mTc-MIBI accumulation that was lowered by FCCP. Importantly, a high linear correlation was found (r = 0.865) between 99mTc-MIBI accumulation and MMP in these cells. These findings indicate that low baseline 99mTc-MIBI uptake that is markedly increased by verapamil represents cancer cells with high levels of MDR1 expression. However, in cancer cells with low or modest levels of MDR1 expression that do not markedly increase 99mTc-MIBI uptake by verapamil, the magnitude of uptake is largely dependent on cellular MMP."
https://openalex.org/W3006096025,"Water-salt stress and nutrient limitation may affect leaf economic spectrum of halophytes and confuse our understanding on plant physiological principles in a changing world. In this study, three halophytic plant communities of Phragmites australis, Suaeda salsa, and Tamarix chinensis, were selected in two sites (sites 1 and 2) on the west coast of Bohai Sea. The net photosynthetic rate (Pn), transpiration rate (Tr), stomatal conductance (Gs), leaf vapor pressure deficit (VPDleaf) and their influencing factors were studied to test the possible carbon assimilation strategies of the halophytes. P. australis had higher Pn, Tr, and Gs than S. salsa and T. chinensis in both sites. Similar trends were found for leaf P and photosynthetic N and P efficiency (PNUE and PPUE, respectively) in one or both sites. By contrast, the leaf dry mass per area (LMA) increased in the order of P. australis < S. salsa < T. chinensis in both sites. For identical species in different sites, Pn, leaf P, and PNUE were lower but Tr, VPDleaf, leaf N, leaf N:P, and PPUE were higher in site 1 than in site 2 for one or more halophytes. Although soil physicochemical properties in different sites explained several variations among the halophytes, two-way ANOVA indicated that the species can explain most of the leaf traits compared with the site. LMA also had significant nonlinear relationships with Pn, Tr, Gs, and VPDleaf. PNUE and PPUE showed positive correlation with Pn in both sites, but they decreased in the power-law function with increasing LMA. Overall, the redundancy analysis showed that the gas exchange capacity of the halophytic plant communities was significantly affected by PPUE (60.0% of explanation), PNUE (57.1%), LMA (35.0%), leaf P (22.0%), and soil N (15.8%)."
https://openalex.org/W3006137548,"Chronic stress and continually high glucocorticoid levels can induce muscle atrophy. Unfortunately, there is a lack of appropriate animal models for stress-induced muscle atrophy research. Corticotropin releasing factor-overexpressing (CRF-OE) mice are a transgenic model of chronic stress that exhibit increased plasma corticosterone levels and Cushing's syndrome; however, the skeletal muscle pathology of the CRF-OE mouse has not been well studied. We observed that male, 19-week-old CRF-OE mice had significantly lower skeletal muscle mass, average cross-sectional myofiber area, and total muscle protein content than their wild type (WT) littermates. Muscle function determined by grip strength, wire-hang, and open field tests showed that 19-week-old male CRF-OE mice had impaired physical ability. Additionally, the skeletal muscles of CRF-mice exhibited decreased expression of factors involved in the IGF-1/AKT/mTOR protein synthesis pathway and increased ubiquitin proteasome pathway activity compared to the WT control mice. In conclusion, 19-week-old CRF-OE mice display numerous features of muscle atrophy and thus serve as a model for investigating stress-induced muscle atrophy and interventions to target the deleterious effects of stress on skeletal muscle."
https://openalex.org/W3006263514,"We propose a new approach to quantifying a minimum threshold value for the size of an animal population, below which that population might be categorised as having unfavourable status. Under European Union law, the concept of Favourable Conservation Status requires assessment of populations as having favourable or unfavourable status, but quantitative methods for such assessments have not yet been developed. One population threshold that is well established in conservation biology is the minimum viable population (MVP) defined as the size of a small but stable population with an acceptably low risk of extinction within a specified period. Our approach combines this small-population paradigm MVP concept with a multiplier, which is a factor by which the MVP is multiplied to allow for the risk of a sustained future decline. We demonstrate this approach using data on UK breeding bird population sizes. We used 43-year time-series data for 189 species and a qualitative assessment of population trends over almost 200 years for 229 species to examine the prevalence, duration and magnitude of sustained population declines. Our study addressed the problem of underestimation of the duration and magnitude of declines caused by short runs of monitoring data by allowing for the truncation of time series. The multiplier was derived from probability distributions of decline magnitudes within a given period, adjusted for truncation. Over a surveillance period of 100 years, we estimated that there was a 10% risk across species that a sustained population decline of at least sixteen-fold would begin. We therefore suggest that, in this case, a factor of 16 could be used as the multiplier of small-population MVPs to obtain minimum threshold population sizes for favourable status. We propose this ‘MVP Multiplier’ method as a new and robust approach to obtaining minimum threshold population sizes which integrates the concepts of small-population and declining-population paradigms. The minimum threshold value we propose is intended for use alongside a range of other measures to enable overall assessments of favourable conservation status."
https://openalex.org/W3006276741,"Introduction The need for specialized care, particularly enteral nutritional therapy in community settings is now increasing with implications for both patients and primary care providers. More research is needed to identify the needs of patients and primary caregivers. The study aimed to explore the perceived support needs regarding the provision of home-based enteral nutritional therapy among critically ill adult patients and family caregivers in the KwaZulu-Natal Province of South Africa. Methods A qualitative study of purposely selected adult patients on homebased enteral nutritional therapy and family caregivers was conducted in a district hospital, a community health centre, two primary health care clinics and selected households in the KwaZulu-Natal Province, South Africa. Semi-structured individual interviews were conducted between June and September 2018 and the content analysis approach was used to analyse data. Results Two major themes and five subthemes emerged from the results of the interviews. The major themes concerned socioeconomic and psychosocial support needs related to the provision of home-based enteral nutritional therapy. Subthemes included the need for financial assistance, need for enteral nutrition products and supplementary supplies, need for infrastructure for continuity of care, and psychological support needs. Conclusion Results of this study confirm the need for developing strategies adapted to a South African context and yonder to meet patients’ and family caregivers’ needs with regard to nutritional services. More research on the identification of needs through monitoring and evaluation of the implementation of nutritional guidelines is needed, particularly in the district hospital and primary health care (PHC) setting."
https://openalex.org/W3006561091,"Neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder (NMOSD) is an inflammatory condition of the central nervous system. The extent of disability depends on the severity of the disease and the number of relapses. Although azathioprine is currently the main treatment for patients with NMOSD in Thailand, patients often relapse during its use. Hence, it is argued that there are other drugs that would be more effective. The purpose of this study is to evaluate, from a societal perspective and from the economic impact on Thailand's healthcare system, the cost utility of treatment with mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) and rituximab in patients resistant to azathioprine. The Markov model with a one-year cycle length was applied to predict the health and cost outcomes in patients with NMOSD over a lifetime. The results showed that rituximab exhibited the highest quality-adjusted life year (QALY) gains among all the options. Among the rituximab-based treatments, the administration of a rituximab biosimilar with CD27+ memory B cell monitoring proved to be the most cost-effective option. At the willingness-to-pay threshold of 160,000 Thai baht (THB), or 5,289 US dollar (USD), per QALY gained, the treatment exhibited the highest probability of being cost effective (48%). A sensitivity analysis based on the adjusted price of a generic MMF determined that the treatment was cost effective, exhibiting an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of -164,653 THB (-5,443 USD) and a 32% probability of being cost effective. The calculated budget impact of treating patients resistant to conventional therapy was 1-6 million THB (33,000-198,000 USD) for the first three years, while after the third year, the budget impact stabilized at 3-4 million THB (99,000-132,000 USD). These data indicate that, in Thailand, treatment of drug resistant NMOSD with a rituximab biosimilar with CD27+ memory B cell monitoring or treatment with a generic MMF would be cost effective and would result in a low budget impact. Therefore, the inclusion of both the rituximab biosimilar and a generic MMF in the National Drug List of Essential Medicine for the treatment of NMOSD may be appropriate."
https://openalex.org/W3006113941,"Capital flows is an important aspect of the international monetary system because they provide great direct and indirect benefits, and at the same time, they carry risks of vulnerability for countries with an open economy. Numerous works have studied the behavior of these flows and have developed models to predict sudden stop events. However, the existing models have limitations and the literature demands more research on the subject given that the accuracy of the models is still poor, and they have only been developed for emerging countries. This paper presents a new prediction model of sudden stop events of capital flows for both emerging countries and developed countries with the ability to estimate accurately future sudden stop scenarios globally. A sample of 103 countries was used, including 73 emerging countries and 30 developed countries, which has allowed the use of sample combinations that consider the regional heterogeneity of the warning indicators. To the sample under study, a method of decision trees has been applied, which has provided excellent prediction results given its ability to learn characteristics and create long-term dependencies from sequential data and time series. Our model has a great potential impact on the adequacy of macroeconomic policy against the risks derived from sudden stops of capital flows, providing tools that help to achieve financial stability at the global level."
https://openalex.org/W3006162945,"Matriptase plays important roles in epithelial integrity and function, which depend on its sorting to the basolateral surface of cells, where matriptase zymogen is converted to an active enzyme in order to act on its substrates. After activation, matriptase undergoes HAI-1-mediated inhibition, internalization, transcytosis, and secretion from the apical surface into the lumen. Matriptase is a mosaic protein with several distinct protein domains and motifs, which are a reflection of matriptase's complex cellular itinerary, life cycle, and the tight control of its enzymatic activity. While the molecular determinants for various matriptase regulatory events have been identified, the motif(s) required for translocation of human matriptase to the basolateral plasma membrane is unknown. The motif previously identified in rat matriptase is not conserved between the rodent and the primate. We, here, revisit the question for human matriptase through the use of a fusion protein containing a green fluorescent protein linked to the matriptase N-terminal fragment ending at Gly-149. A conserved seven amino acid motif EEGEVFL, which is similar to the monoleucine C-terminal to an acidic cluster motif involved in the basolateral targeting for some growth factors, has been shown to be required for matriptase translocation to the basolateral plasma membrane of polarized MDCK cells. Furthermore, time-lapse video microscopy showed that the motif appears to be required for entry into the correct transport vesicles, by which matriptase can undergo rapid trafficking and translocate to the plasma membrane. Our study reveals that the EEGEVFL motif is necessary, but may not be sufficient, for matriptase basolateral membrane targeting and serves as the basis for further research on its pathophysiological roles."
https://openalex.org/W3006498918,"Shelf-life information provides end-users with the assurance that the product is still in compliance with label claims. Behavioral reaction orders of the Arrhenius model had been consistently used under fixed conditions to provide shelf-life in food products. Due to non-conformity of the cucurbitacin-containing phytonematicides to the Arrhenius behavioral reaction orders, an alternative quadratic model consistent with the behavioral reaction orders of cucurbitacins was developed under chilled (5°C at 95-98% RH) and fixed tropical (38°C at 90% RH) conditions, while room temperature constituted unfixed conditions. Sampling for cucurbitacins was done at time-frames compliant with geometric series, with cucurbitacin analysis regularly performed using high-performance liquid chromatography techniques. Under chilled conditions, neither the Arrhenius nor the quadratic model could predict the shelf-life for Nemarioc-AL phytonematicide, whereas Nemafric-BL phytonematicide had shelf-life of 35 weeks. In contrast, under tropical conditions, the positive quadratic models showed that Nemarioc-AL and Nemafric-BL phytonematicides had shelf-life of 35 and 825 weeks, respectively. In conclusion, the two phytonematicides could be stored under fixed tropical conditions to enhance the shelf-life of their active ingredients."
https://openalex.org/W3006616149,"In this paper, the authors study the mathematical properties of a class of alternating links called polyhedral links which have been used to model DNA polyhedra. The motivation of such studies is to provide guidance and aid in the research of the properties of certain DNA molecules. For example, such studies can provide characterizations of the structural complexity of DNA molecules. In an earlier work, Cheng and Jin studied the mathematical properties of such polyhedral links and were able to determine the braid index of a double crossover polyhedral link with 4 turn. However, the braid index of a double crossover polyhedral link with 4.5 turn remained an unsolved problem to this date, even though the graphs that admit the double crossover polyhedral links with 4.5 turn have been synthesized. In this paper, we provide a complete formulation of the braid index of a double crossover polyhedral link with an arbitrary turn number. Our approach is more general and it allows us to completely determine the braid indices for a much larger class of links. In the case of the double crossover polyhedral links, our formulation of the braid index is a simple formula based on a simpler graph used as a template to build the double crossover polyhedral links."
