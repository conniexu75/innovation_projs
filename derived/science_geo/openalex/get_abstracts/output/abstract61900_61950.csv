https://openalex.org/W1990849633,"Nontoxigenic and bacteriophage-sensitive bacterial cultures have been isolated from toxigenic Clostridium botulinum type C, strain 468C, after treatment with either ultraviolet light or acridine orange. Two bacteriophages, designated CEbeta and CE(gamma), were isolated from toxigenic strain 468C. Both of these bacteriophages were capable of infecting the nontoxigenic type C cultures, but only bacteriophage CEbeta was involved in the change from nontoxigenicity to toxigenicity."

https://openalex.org/W2080674964,"The nucleotide sequence of "" denaturable""leucine acceptor transfer RNA (tRNA(Leu)(3)) from baker's yeast was determined on (32)P-labeled material. The molecule is 85 nucleotides long and can be folded into the ""cloverleaf"" model for secondary structure. The basis on which the sequence was deduced from the products of complete enzymatic digestion, prior to its unambiguous determination, is presented."

https://openalex.org/W2078824593,"WE have found an accumulation of cholesterol within the oxygen-filled swimbladders of some deep sea benthic fishes, which suggests that certain steps in cholesterol biosynthesis and/or degradation are affected by hyperbaric oxygen. The lipid content of these swimbladders included as much as 49 % (dry wt basis) of cholesterol. The lipid included major amounts of unsaturated fatty acids which resist auto-oxidative processes within the swimbladder which contains oxygen at pressures up to 380 atmospheres."

It also inhibits the growth of vaccinia and other poxviruses3,4. An interaction between the antibiotic and the viral polymerase has not been demonstrated, however, and the antiviral mode of action of the drug remains unknown."

This can be observed in slide cover glass or capillary tube preparations. At ovulation the cervical mucus is most abundant, possesses the lowest viscosity or spinnbarkeit, is most translucent, contains the highest water concentration and fewest cells, is most alkaline, permits maximum spermatozoan penetration, contains the maximum of glycogen, maltose, mannose, fructose, fucose, hexosamine, glutamic acid, taurine, methionine, lysine, aspartic acid, glycine, alanine, valine, serine, arginine, cholesterol, lipid, phosphorus, and sodium chloride. It possesses thromboplastic activity and is bacteriostatic. Blood group substances corresponding to the blood group of the individual occur in the cervical secretion in high titre if the person is a secretor1."
