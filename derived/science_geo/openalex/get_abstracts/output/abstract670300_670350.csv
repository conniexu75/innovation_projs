https://openalex.org/W3137149656,"SARS-CoV-2 lineage B.1.1.7, a variant that was first detected in the UK in September 20201, has spread to multiple countries worldwide. Several studies have established that B.1.1.7 is more transmissible than pre-existing variants, but have not identified whether it leads to any change in disease severity2. Here we analyse a dataset that links 2,245,263 positive SARS-CoV-2 community tests and 17,452 deaths associated with COVID-19 in England from 1 November 2020 to 14 February 2021. For 1,146,534 (51%) of these tests, the presence or absence of B.1.1.7 can be identified because mutations in this lineage prevent PCR amplification of the spike (S) gene target (known as S gene target failure (SGTF)1). On the basis of 4,945 deaths with known SGTF status, we estimate that the hazard of death associated with SGTF is 55% (95% confidence interval, 39-72%) higher than in cases without SGTF after adjustment for age, sex, ethnicity, deprivation, residence in a care home, the local authority of residence and test date. This corresponds to the absolute risk of death for a 55-69-year-old man increasing from 0.6% to 0.9% (95% confidence interval, 0.8-1.0%) within 28 days of a positive test in the community. Correcting for misclassification of SGTF and missingness in SGTF status, we estimate that the hazard of death associated with B.1.1.7 is 61% (42-82%) higher than with pre-existing variants. Our analysis suggests that B.1.1.7 is not only more transmissible than pre-existing SARS-CoV-2 variants, but may also cause more severe illness."
https://openalex.org/W3137406645,"The human cortex comprises diverse cell types that emerge from an initially uniform neuroepithelium that gives rise to radial glia, the neural stem cells of the cortex. To characterize the earliest stages of human brain development, we performed single-cell RNA-sequencing across regions of the developing human brain, including the telencephalon, diencephalon, midbrain, hindbrain and cerebellum. We identify nine progenitor populations physically proximal to the telencephalon, suggesting more heterogeneity than previously described, including a highly prevalent mesenchymal-like population that disappears once neurogenesis begins. Comparison of human and mouse progenitor populations at corresponding stages identifies two progenitor clusters that are enriched in the early stages of human cortical development. We also find that organoid systems display low fidelity to neuroepithelial and early radial glia cell types, but improve as neurogenesis progresses. Overall, we provide a comprehensive molecular and spatial atlas of early stages of human brain and cortical development."
https://openalex.org/W3138604429,"Introduction Since the start of the pandemic, millions of people have been infected, with thousands of deaths. Many foci worldwide have been identified in retirement nursing homes, with a high number of deaths. Our study aims were to evaluate the spread of SARS-CoV-2 in the retirement nursing homes, the predictors to develop symptoms, and death. Methods and findings We conducted a retrospective study enrolling all people living in retirement nursing homes (PLRNH), where at least one SARS-CoV-2 infected person was present. Medical and clinical data were collected. Variables were compared with Student’s t-test or Pearson chi-square test as appropriate. Uni- and multivariate analyses were conducted to evaluate variables’ influence on infection and symptoms development. Cox proportional-hazards model was used to evaluate 30 days mortality predictors, considering death as the dependent variable. We enrolled 382 subjects. The mean age was 81.15±10.97 years, and males were 140(36.7%). At the multivariate analysis, mental disorders, malignancies, and angiotensin II receptor blockers were predictors of SARS-CoV-2 infection while having a neurological syndrome was associated with a lower risk. Only half of the people with SARS-CoV-2 infection developed symptoms. Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and neurological syndrome were correlated with an increased risk of developing SARS-CoV-2 related symptoms. Fifty-six (21.2%) people with SARS-CoV-2 infection died; of these, 53 died in the first 30 days after the swab’s positivity. Significant factors associated with 30-days mortality were male gender, hypokinetic disease, and the presence of fever and dyspnea. Patients’ autonomy and early heparin treatment were related to lower mortality risk. Conclusions We evidenced factors associated with infection’s risk and death in a setting with high mortality such as retirement nursing homes, that should be carefully considered in the management of PLRNH."
https://openalex.org/W3139250185,"Animals susceptible to chronic social defeat stress (CSDS) exhibit depression-related behaviors, with aberrant transcription across several limbic brain regions, most notably in the nucleus accumbens (NAc). Early life stress (ELS) promotes susceptibility to CSDS in adulthood, but associated enduring changes in transcriptional control mechanisms in the NAc have not yet been investigated. In this study, we examined long-lasting changes to histone modifications in the NAc of male and female mice exposed to ELS. Dimethylation of lysine 79 of histone H3 (H3K79me2) and the enzymes (DOT1L and KDM2B) that control this modification are enriched in D2-type medium spiny neurons and are shown to be crucial for the expression of ELS-induced stress susceptibility. We mapped the site-specific regulation of this histone mark genome wide to reveal the transcriptional networks it modulates. Finally, systemic delivery of a small molecule inhibitor of DOT1L reversed ELS-induced behavioral deficits, indicating the clinical relevance of this epigenetic mechanism."
https://openalex.org/W3136343011,"Despite advances in technologies for cardiac repair after myocardial infarction (MI), new integrated therapeutic approaches still need to be developed. In this study, we designed a perfusable, multifunctional epicardial device (PerMed) consisting of a biodegradable elastic patch (BEP), permeable hierarchical microchannel networks (PHMs) and a system to enable delivery of therapeutic agents from a subcutaneously implanted pump. After its implantation into the epicardium, the BEP is designed to provide mechanical cues for ventricular remodeling, and the PHMs are designed to facilitate angiogenesis and allow for infiltration of reparative cells. In a rat model of MI, implantation of the PerMed improved ventricular function. When connected to a pump, the PerMed enabled targeted, sustained and stable release of platelet-derived growth factor-BB, amplifying the efficacy of cardiac repair as compared to the device without a pump. We also demonstrated the feasibility of minimally invasive surgical PerMed implantation in pigs, demonstrating its promise for clinical translation to treat heart disease."
https://openalex.org/W3138319424,"Background Data on the comorbidities that result in negative outcomes for people with COVID-19 are currently scarce for African populations. This study identifies comorbidities that predict death among a large sample of COVID-19 patients from Nigeria. Methods This was a retrospective analysis of medical records for 2184 laboratory confirmed cases of COVID-19 in Lagos, southwest Nigeria. Extracted data included age, sex, severity of condition at presentation and self-reported comorbidities. The outcomes of interest were death or discharge from facility. Results Most of the cases were male (65.8%) and the median age was 43 years (IQR: 33–55). Four hundred and ninety-two patients (22.5%) had at least one comorbidity and the most common amongst them were hypertension (74.2%) and diabetes (30.3%). The mortality rate was 3.3% and a significantly higher proportion of patients with comorbidities died compared to those with none. The comorbidities that predicted death were hypertension (OR: 2.21, 95%CI: 1.22–4.01), diabetes (OR: 3.69, 95% CI: 1.99–6.85), renal disease (OR: 12.53, 95%CI: 1.97–79.56), cancer (OR: 14.12, 95% CI: 2.03–98.19) and HIV (OR: 1.77–84.15]. Conclusion Comorbidities are prevalent and the associated risk of death is high among COVID-19 patients in Lagos, Nigeria. Public enlightenment, early identification and targeted care for COVID-19 cases with comorbidities are recommended as the pandemic evolves."
https://openalex.org/W3136425725,"Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+ ) homeostasis is constantly compromised due to degradation by NAD+ -dependent enzymes. NAD+ replenishment by supplementation with the NAD+ precursors nicotinamide mononucleotide (NMN) and nicotinamide riboside (NR) can alleviate this imbalance. However, NMN and NR are limited by their mild effect on the cellular NAD+ pool and the need of high doses. Here, we report a synthesis method of a reduced form of NMN (NMNH), and identify this molecule as a new NAD+ precursor for the first time. We show that NMNH increases NAD+ levels to a much higher extent and faster than NMN or NR, and that it is metabolized through a different, NRK and NAMPT-independent, pathway. We also demonstrate that NMNH reduces damage and accelerates repair in renal tubular epithelial cells upon hypoxia/reoxygenation injury. Finally, we find that NMNH administration in mice causes a rapid and sustained NAD+ surge in whole blood, which is accompanied by increased NAD+ levels in liver, kidney, muscle, brain, brown adipose tissue, and heart, but not in white adipose tissue. Together, our data highlight NMNH as a new NAD+ precursor with therapeutic potential for acute kidney injury, confirm the existence of a novel pathway for the recycling of reduced NAD+ precursors and establish NMNH as a member of the new family of reduced NAD+ precursors."
https://openalex.org/W3129822175,"The basal ganglia regulate a wide range of behaviors, including motor control and cognitive functions, and are profoundly affected in Parkinson’s disease (PD). However, the functional organization of different basal ganglia nuclei has not been fully elucidated at the circuit level. In this study, we investigated the functional roles of distinct parvalbumin-expressing neuronal populations in the external globus pallidus (GPe-PV) and their contributions to different PD-related behaviors. We demonstrate that substantia nigra pars reticulata (SNr)-projecting GPe-PV neurons and parafascicular thalamus (PF)-projecting GPe-PV neurons are associated with locomotion and reversal learning, respectively. In a mouse model of PD, we found that selective manipulation of the SNr-projecting GPe-PV neurons alleviated locomotor deficit, whereas manipulation of the PF-projecting GPe-PV neurons rescued the impaired reversal learning. Our findings establish the behavioral importance of two distinct GPe-PV neuronal populations and, thereby, provide a new framework for understanding the circuit basis of different behavioral deficits in the Parkinsonian state. The authors define two functionally distinct external globus pallidus basal ganglia pathways and their differential contributions to motor and cognitive Parkinsonian deficits in mice."
https://openalex.org/W3135928727,"COVID-19 has led to global dramatic shifts in daily life. Following the biopsychosocial model of health, the goal of the current study was to predict people’s psychological well-being (PWB) during the initial lockdown phase of the pandemic and to investigate which coping strategies were most common among people with low and high PWB. Participants were 938 volunteers in the United States who responded to an online survey during the lockdown in April 2020. The main findings were that all three groups of variables, biological, psychological, and socio-economic, significantly contributed to PWB explaining 53% variance. Social loneliness and sense of agency were the strongest predictors. PWB was significantly predicted by physical health (not gender nor age); by spirituality, emotional loneliness, social loneliness, and sense of agency; by job security (not income, nor neighborhood safety, nor hours spent on social media). Comparing the coping strategies of participants, results show more intentional coping in the high-PWB group and more passive coping in the low-PWB group. During this unprecedented pandemic, the findings highlight that ability to sustainably cope with the global shifts in daily life depends on actively and intentionally attending to PWB by being one’s own agent for physical health, spiritual health, and social connection."
https://openalex.org/W3135917156,"The outbreak of the 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19) created an international public health emergency, challenging the psychological resilience of the general population. Regarding this matter, a web-based survey was performed. Data were collected from the following 1,668 self-selected volunteers: 800 athletes (28.30 ± 10.93 years old); 558 coaches (36.91 ± 11.93 years old); and 310 sports managers (42.07 ± 13.38 years old). To assess the level of psychological stress, an Impact of the Event Scale-Revised (IES-R) questionnaire was used. The results indicated that 34.4% of the participants who were interviewed were affected by subjective distress while 26.4% rated their psychological impact from the sports activity interruption as severe. Separated one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) tests showed significant differences in the IES-R total score (TS), indicating that the level of stress in terms of gender revealed that women were more stressed than men (p = 0.000), for ""sports roles"" in which the manager and coaches were more stressed than the athletes (p < 0.05), and ""type of sport"" in which fitness and individual athletes were more stressed than team athletes (p < 0.01). The middle-level athletes showed significantly more hyperarousal levels than high-level athletes (p = 0.012). The results of this survey may raise awareness of this problem and help athletic associations to have appropriate guidelines in order to better sustain their memberships and organize an optimal resumption of their sports activities. Along these lines, social interactions, which are typical of team sports, are crucial to warrant resilience and psychological health. The athletes by managing independently the new rules and measures, thanks to a clear communication, could improve their adaptive stress reaction."
https://openalex.org/W3136056317,"The protein complexes of the mitochondrial electron transport chain exist in isolation and in higher order assemblies termed supercomplexes (SCs) or respirasomes (SC I+III2+IV). The association of complexes I, III and IV into the respirasome is regulated by unknown mechanisms. Here, we designed a nanoluciferase complementation reporter for complex III and IV proximity to determine in vivo respirasome levels. In a chemical screen, we found that inhibitors of the de novo pyrimidine synthesis enzyme dihydroorotate dehydrogenase (DHODH) potently increased respirasome assembly and activity. By-passing DHODH inhibition via uridine supplementation decreases SC assembly by altering mitochondrial phospholipid composition, specifically elevated peroxisomal-derived ether phospholipids. Cell growth rates upon DHODH inhibition depend on ether lipid synthesis and SC assembly. These data reveal that nucleotide pools signal to peroxisomes to modulate synthesis and transport of ether phospholipids to mitochondria for SC assembly, which are necessary for optimal cell growth in conditions of nucleotide limitation. A chemical screen identifies DHODH inhibitors as robust activators of mitochondrial respirasome assembly. Lipidomics reveal that peroxisomal-derived ether phospholipids accumulate in mitochondria during nucleotide deprivation to drive proliferation."

https://openalex.org/W3136809232,"The aim of this study was to determine the factors affecting the exposure of women in the 15–59 age group in Turkey to economic violence by their husbands/partners. The micro data set of the National Research on Domestic Violence against Women in Turkey, which was conducted by the Hacettepe University Institute of Population Studies, was employed in this study. The factors affecting women’s exposure to economic violence were determined using the binary logistic regression analysis. In the study, women in the 15–24, 25–34 and 35–44 age group had a higher ratio of exposure to economic violence compared to the reference group. Women who graduated from elementary school, secondary school, and high school had a higher ratio of exposure to economic violence compared to those who have never gone to school. Women’s exposure to physical, sexual and verbal violence was also important factor affecting women’s exposure to economic violence. The results obtained in this study are important in that they can be a source of information for establishing policies and programs to prevent violence against women. This study can also be a significant guide in determining priority areas for the resolution of economic violence against women."
https://openalex.org/W3138603672,"Background/Objectives Many European countries reported increased numbers of syphilis, gonorrhoea and chlamydia diagnoses among men who have sex with men (MSM) in recent years. Behaviour changes and increased testing are thought to drive these increases. Methods In 2010 and 2017, two large online surveys for MSM in Europe (EMIS-2010, EMIS-2017) collected self-reported data on STI diagnoses in the previous 12 months, diagnostic procedures, STI symptoms when testing, number of sexual partners, and sexual behaviours such as condom use during the last intercourse with a non-steady partner in 46 European countries. Multivariate regression models were used to analyse factors associated with diagnoses of syphilis, gonorrhoea/chlamydia, and respective diagnoses classified as symptomatic and asymptomatic. If applicable, they included country-level screening rates. Results Questions on STI diagnoses and sexual behaviours were answered by 156,018 (2010) and 125,837 (2017) participants. Between 2010 and 2017, overall diagnoses with gonorrhoea/chlamydia and syphilis increased by 76% and 83% across countries. Increases were more pronounced for asymptomatic compared to symptomatic infections. The proportion of respondents screened and the frequency of screening grew considerably. Condomless anal intercourse with the last non-steady partner rose by 62%; self-reported partner numbers grew. Increased syphilis diagnoses were largely explained by behavioural changes (including more frequent screening). Gonorrhoea/chlamydia increases were mainly explained by more screening and a change in testing performance. A country variable representing the proportion of men screened for asymptomatic infection was positively associated with reporting symptomatic gonorrhoea/chlamydia, but not syphilis. Discussion/Conclusion The positive association of country-level screening rates with the proportion of symptomatic infections with gonorrhoea/chlamydia may indicate a paradoxical effect of screening on incidence of symptomatic infections. Treatment of asymptomatic men might render them more susceptible to new infections, while spontaneous clearance may result in reduced susceptibility. Before expanding screening programmes, evidence of the effects of screening and treatment is warranted."
https://openalex.org/W3138777081,"Objective Maternal mental health problems in the perinatal period can cause significant distress and loss of functioning, and can have lasting impact on children. People living in disadvantage are at risk of health inequalities, including for perinatal mental health. A review of current guidance found that overall implementation of the UK detection and management strategy was satisfactory, but equity was not considered in the review. Greater understanding of implementation equity is needed. We aimed to reanalyse an existing systematic review on the implementation of current guidance for the identification and management of perinatal mental health problems for equity. Methods Studies reporting the presence or absence of variation by a social, economic or demographic group were quality appraised and the presence and direction of disparity tabled. We calculated standardised absolute prevalence estimates for overall detection and management, and absolute and relative estimates by determinants grouping. A thematic analysis of the studies that examined potential reasons for disparity was undertaken. Results Six studies, with no major quality concerns, provided consistent evidence of reduced identification and management for ethnic minority women, both those who do, and do not, speak English. There was less consistent evidence of inequality for other axes of social disparity and for characteristics such as age, parity and partnership status. Explanations centred on difficulties that translation and interpretation added to communication, and hesitancy related to uncertainty from healthcare providers over cultural understanding of mental health problems. Conclusion The identification and management of perinatal mental health problems is likely to be inequitable for ethnic minority women. Further systems-based research should focus on clarifying whether other groups of women are at risk for inequalities, understand how mismatches in perception are generated, and design effective strategies for remediation. Inequalities should be considered when reviewing evidence that underpins service planning and policy decision-making."
https://openalex.org/W3136789913,"The protein tyrosine phosphatase SHP2 mediates multiple signal transductions in various cellular pathways, controlled by a variety of upstream inputs. SHP2 dysregulation is causative of different types of cancers and developmental disorders, making it a promising drug target. However, how SHP2 is modulated by its different regulators remains largely unknown. Here, we use single-molecule fluorescence resonance energy transfer and molecular dynamics simulations to investigate this question. We identify a partially open, semiactive conformation of SHP2 that is intermediate between the known open and closed states. We further demonstrate a “multiple gear” regulatory mechanism, in which different activators (e.g., insulin receptor substrate-1 and CagA), oncogenic mutations (e.g., E76A), and allosteric inhibitors (e.g., SHP099) can shift the equilibrium of the three conformational states and regulate SHP2 activity to different levels. Our work reveals the essential role of the intermediate state in fine-tuning the activity of SHP2, which may provide new opportunities for drug development for relevant cancers.

Recently, two studies by using X-ray diffraction and NMR spectroscopy reported that the structure of the C-terminal truncated mutant SHP2 (E76 K, residues 1–525) adopted an open conformation with swiveling of the C-SH2 domain, moving of the N-SH2 domain across the entire body of the PTP domain from one side to the other, and fully exposing of the PTP active site. Allosteric inhibitor SHP099 binding to SHP2 (E76 K) restored the closed conformation near-identical to WT (20LaRochelle J.R. Fodor M. Vemulapalli V. Mohseni M. Wang P. Stams T. LaMarche M.J.

However, it remains unclear how SHP2 utilizes its tandem-SH2 domain to precisely respond to various upstream activators and subsequently control downstream signaling networks. In this study, we utilize the single-molecule fluorescence resonance energy transfer (smFRET) approach (29Lerner E. Cordes T. Ingargiola A. Alhadid Y. Chung S.Y. Michalet X. Weiss S.

Cool and dynamic: Single-molecule fluorescence-based structural biology.Nat. Methods. 2017; 14: 123Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar) to directly monitor the components and dynamics of the structural ensembles of WT and mutant SHP2 under different conditions. We find that SHP2 adopts three distinct conformational states in aqueous solution: an open state, a closed state, and a previously unidentified partially open state. We show that WT SHP2 is dominated in the closed state, while in contrast, the juvenile myelomonocytic leukemias–associated familial mutation E76A31 dramatically reshapes the conformational landscape and dynamics toward the open and partially open states. By using the molecular dynamics (MD) simulation, we characterize the structure of the partially open state. We demonstrate that the activation of SHP2 by different endogenous and exogenous activators largely depends on the conformational preference to either the open or the partially open state. Thus, SHP2 dynamically switches its conformational equilibrium among inactive, semiactive, and active states to fulfill its distinct function in response to various regulators. Because the activation of SHP2 is triggered by the exposure of the catalytic pocket on the PTP domain, which is occupied by N-SH2 in the closed conformation (25Hof P. Pluskey S. Dhe-Paganon S. Eck M.J. Shoelson S.E. Crystal structure of the tyrosine phosphatase SHP-2.Cell. 1998; 92: 441-450Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (742) Google Scholar), we envisioned a labeling pair for FRET with one in the N-SH2 domain and the other in the PTP domain. In this way, the relative movement between the N-SH2 and PTP domains can be directly captured by measuring the time-dependent changes in FRET efficiency (29Lerner E. Cordes T. Ingargiola A. Alhadid Y. Chung S.Y. Michalet X. Weiss S. Toward dynamic structural biology: Two decades of single-molecule Förster resonance energy transfer.Science. 2018; 359: eaan1133Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar, 30Craggs T.D. Cool and dynamic: Single-molecule fluorescence-based structural biology.Nat. Methods. 2017; 14: 123Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). Accordingly, several labeling pairs with different distances were designed (Fig. 1A and Table S1). As for fluorophore attachment, the most commonly used cysteine-based strategy is not applicable (31Roy R. Hohng S. Ha T. A practical guide to single-molecule FRET.Nat. Methods. 2008; 5: 507Crossref PubMed Scopus (1494) Google Scholar) for SHP2, because SHP2 contains 10 cysteine residues globally distributed in the structure with C459 located at the center of the catalytic pocket. Alternatively, we employed a genetic code expansion technique whereby the stop codons (TAG) at labeling sites are used to code for an azido-modified unnatural amino acid azido-p-acetylphenylalanine (Azido-p-Phe), through an engineered tRNA/aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase system (32Chin J.W. Santoro S.W. Martin A.B. King D.S. Wang L. Schultz P.G. Addition of p-Azido-l-phenylalanine to the genetic code of Escherichia coli.J. Am. Chem.

For instance, WT full-length SHP2 (1–593) with two Azido-p-Phe incorporated at Q87/K266 (termed as Azido-WT-87/266) was expressed accompanied with two truncated variants because of the translation termination at the two mutated TAG sites (Fig. S1B). The fluorophores (Cy3 as FRET donor and Cy5 as FRET acceptor) were further conjugated to Azido-WT-87/266 via click reaction (termed as Fluor-WT-87/266), in which a protective regent Tris (3-hydroxypropyltriazolylmethyl) amine was added to avoid oxidative damage of SHP2 and maintain the Cu (I) oxidation state (34Hong V. Presolski S.I. Ma C. Finn M.G. Analysis and Optimization of Copper-Catalyzed Azide–alkyne Cycloaddition for Bioconjugation.Angew. Chem. Int.

Chapter 9 - Genetically encoded click Chemistry for single-molecule FRET of proteins.in: Methods in Cell Biology. 113. Elsevier Academic Press, San Diego, CA2013: 169-187Google Scholar) (Fig. 1A). The labeled SHP2 was immobilized on the standard PEGylated quartz surface via Fab-biotin and biotin-neutravidin interactions for smFRET study (36Chandradoss S.D. Haagsma A.C. Lee Y.K. Hwang J.-H. Nam J.-M. Joo C. Surface passivation for single-molecule protein studies.J. Vis. Exp. 2014; : 50549Google Scholar) (Fig. 1B). Control assays indicated that few molecules were detected by analysis tools (software smCamera, John Hopkins (31Roy R. Hohng S. Ha T. A practical guide to single-molecule FRET.Nat. Methods. 2008; 5: 507Crossref PubMed Scopus (1494) Google Scholar)) without Fab or protein, which confirmed that nonspecific fluorescence signals were prevented through this immobilization process (Fig. S1C). smFRET images of different SHP2 constructs including Fluor-WT-87/266, Fluor-E76A-87/266, Fluor-E76A-87/450, and Fluor-E76A-25/484 were acquired with a prism-based total internal reflection fluorescence (TIRF) microscope during donor excitation with a 532 nm laser (Figs. 1C and S1D). Donor-acceptor labeled molecules were identified with co-localization of the two fluorophores in both channels. Among SHP2 constructs, only the 87/266 pair exhibited relatively high fluorescence labeling efficiency with modest effect on impairment of the PTP activity of SHP2 upon introducing the Azido-p-Phe and dye-labeling (Fig. S1E). Therefore, we focused on the 87/266 labeling pair for the following smFRET studies of both WT and mutated SHP2. We performed smFRET to investigate the conformational ensembles of SHP2 (WT) in aqueous solution. smFRET trajectories and the distribution histogram plotted from 208 individual recordings of molecules revealed that SHP2 (WT) is dominantly populated in a high FRET state (∼0.70), corresponding to the closed state as seen in the crystal structure of SHP2 (WT) (Figs. 2A and S2). Intriguingly, in addition to a high FRET state, low-populated medium FRET and low FRET states were resolved. Because SHP2 (WT) exhibits basal PTP activity (Fig. S1E), the low FRET and medium FRET states with enlarged distances between the labeling pair may represent the active states of SHP2 where the N-SH2 domain is detached from the PTP domain thus to expose the catalytic pocket. To further characterize the active states (low and medium FRET states) observed in the WT SHP2, we sought to examine the disease-related hyperactive mutant SHP2 (E76A) which exhibits much enhanced PTP activity compared with SHP2 (WT) (37Chan G. Kalaitzidis D. Neel B.G. The tyrosine phosphatase Shp2 (PTPN11) in cancer.Cancer Metastasis Rev. 2008; 27: 179-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar) (Fig. S1E). We solved the crystal structure of full-length SHP2 (E76A) to a resolution of 2.5 Å by X-ray diffraction (PDB code: 6IHZ) (Fig. S3 and Table S2). The structure showed that SHP2 (E76A) retains a closed conformation in crystals which is nearly identical to that of SHP2 (WT) with overall root mean square deviation of 0.472 Å. However, small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) showed that SHP2 (E76A) features a more extended ensemble and dynamic conformation than that of SHP2 (WT) in aqueous solution, as evidenced by larger radius of gyration (Rg) and maximal end-to-end distance (Dmax) in the pair distance distribution function and increased value at higher qRg in the dimensionless Kratky plots compared with WT (Fig. S4). Notably, the smFRET trajectories and the distribution histogram of SHP2 (E76A) reveal that it features a distinct conformational landscape with significantly populated medium (0.38) and low FRET (0.28) states compared with that of SHP2 (WT) in aqueous solution (Figs. 2B and S5). These results demonstrate that the E76A mutation unlocks the N-SH2 domain from the PTP domain and shifts the conformational equilibrium of SHP2 toward the more opened active states. We next investigated the dynamic transition of SHP2 (WT) and SHP2 (E76A) between different states by Hidden Markov modeling analysis (31Roy R. Hohng S. Ha T. A practical guide to single-molecule FRET.Nat. Methods. 2008; 5: 507Crossref PubMed Scopus (1494) Google Scholar). As the real-time traces indicated, a large amount of SHP2 (E76A) molecules featured rapid and random conformational transitions between FRET states (Fig. S5). By calculating the fraction of traces with detectable dynamics and forming the transition-density plots (TDPs), we found that SHP2 (E76A) molecules featured a more dynamic conformational ensemble than that of SHP2 (WT) (Fig. 2). Moreover, the TDPs of SHP2 (E76A) show that the conformational transitions between the low and medium FRET states and those between the medium and high FRET states are much more frequent than the direct transition between low and high FRET states (Fig. 2B). These results suggest that the medium FRET states may represent an intermediate partially open state between the open (low FRET) state and the closed (high FRET) state. To further verify the partially open state and its transition observed by smFRET, we modeled the conformational transition pathway from the closed state to open state by an enhanced sampling method of adiabatic biased molecular dynamics (ABMD) (38Marchi M. Ballone P. Adiabatic bias molecular dynamics: A method to navigate the conformational space of complex molecular systems.J. Chem. Phys. 1999; 110: 3697-3702Crossref Scopus (98) Google Scholar, 39Paci E. Karplus M. Forced unfolding of fibronectin type 3 modules: An analysis by biased molecular dynamics simulations.J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 288: 441-459Crossref PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar). Derived free energy landscape in conformational space revealed three relatively stable conformations, supporting the existence of a partially open state in addition to the closed and open states (Fig. S6). The stationary distribution of the three states calculated by Markov state model revealed that SHP2 (WT) dominates in the closed state, whereas SHP2 (E76A) favors the partially open and open states (Fig. S6). Thus, the MD simulation results coincide with our observation in the smFRET studies and confirm the existence of the partially open state as an intermediate state between the close and open state of SHP2. We next analyzed the structure of the partially open state of SHP2. From the structural cluster analysis of the partially open conformations, we found that the majority of the structural ensembles share a similar conformation where the N-SH2 rotates ∼35° around the PTP domain derived from the closed state (Figs. 3A and S7A). Further structural analysis of the top three predominant partially open conformations (71% occupancy) reveals that the rotation of the N-SH2 domain flips up the D’E-loop and the F’A-loop (F71-A76) from deep inside of the catalytic pocket to the edge of the pocket (Figs. 3B and S7A). This conformational translocation may disrupt the self-inhibition and increase the substrate accessibility to the catalytic pocket. However, the D’E-loop, F’A-loop, and the N’F-loop (N37-F41) of the N-SH2 domain located on the edge of the pocket can still form transient interaction with the catalytic loops of the PTP domain, which were observed in the subpopulation of the simulated partially open conformations. Thus, we further assessed the interactions between the N-SH2 and the PTP domain in the simulated partially open conformations. We found that the N-SH2 domain of SHP2 (E76A) mainly interacts with the residues in the WPD-loop (including the residues both in the K-loop and WPD-loop, as the interaction with K-loop also restrict the motion of the WPD-loop (22Pedersen A.K. Peters G.H. Moller K.B. Iversen L.F. Kastrup J.S. Water-molecule network and active-site flexibility of apo protein tyrosine phosphatase 1B.Acta Crystallogr.

Chem. 2010; 285: 15874-15883Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar)), Q-loop, and P-loop (Fig. S8A). The interaction-based classification of SHP2 (E76A) revealed three predominant interaction patterns of the simulated partially open conformations (Fig. S8B). As shown in Figure 3, C–E, the residues T59, G60, D61, and Y63 in the D’E-loop of the N-SH2 domain form diverse interactions with the residues in the WPD-loop, the K-loop, the Q-loop, and the P-loop of the PTP domain. These interaction patterns are also conserved in the simulated partially open conformations of SHP2 (WT) (Fig. S7, B–G). Taken together, these results indicate that the partially open conformations release the D’E-loop of the N-SH2 domain from the self-inhibited conformation and relocate to the edge of the catalytic pocket, which may partially disturb the catalytic pocket and lead to the semiactivity of the PTP domain. We next asked whether and how SHP2 utilizes its partially open state to regulate its PTP activity. Previous studies showed that the PTP activity of SHP2 could be tightly regulated by a variety of upstream activators in diverse signaling transduction pathways (40Imhof D. Wavreille A.-S. May A.

The SHP2 activators contain either a bis-phosphorylated (bis-P) segment binding to both N-SH2 and C-SH2 domains or a single monophosphorylated (mono-P) segment binding to the N-SH2 or C-SH2 domain of SHP2 with a relatively weaker activation effect (15Okazaki T.

Thus, we performed smFRET to study whether SHP2 rearranges its conformational landscape (especially the partially open state) in response to different activators. We firstly examined a mono-P segment, EPIpYA-D, which is derived from an exogenous activator East Asian CagA in gastric carcinogenesis (43Hayashi T. Senda M. Suzuki N. Nishikawa H. Ben C. Tang C. Nagase L. Inoue K. Senda T. Hatakeyama M.

Intriguingly, titration of EPIpYA-D induced the conformational shift of both the closed and open states toward the medium FRET state, resulting in a predominant partially open state. As a control, the mono-P segment EPIpYA-C from Western CagA with much reduced ability for SHP2 (E76A) stimulation showed a minor effect on configuration redistribution of SHP2 (E76A) upon titration (Fig. 4, B and C). We further examined a third mono-P segment pY612 derived from an endogenous upstream activator IL-3 receptor (43Hayashi T. Senda M. Suzuki N. Nishi"

The practice of preventive measures of the disease supports containment processes of the spread of coronavirus. However, the practice of preventive measures is affected by several associated risk factors. Objective This study aimed to investigate the associated factors that limit the youths’ practice of preventive measures against COVID-19 in the study area. Methods A community-based cross-sectional study was conducted. The study used a quantitative approach for collecting data from 384 youths using a survey method. Not practicing preventive measures was measured to determine whether or not youths applied hygiene practices, kept their distance, restricted their movements, and sought self-help or support in the past two months. Descriptive statistics were used to assess the distribution of study participants, and a binary regression model was executed to examine the association factors with inability to practice preventive measures with a p-value &lt; 0.05 statistically significant. Results Male youths (Adjusted Odds Ratio (AOR) = 0.06; 95% CI: 0.02, 0.16) were less likely to practice preventive measures. Older youth (AOR = 1.33; 95% CI: 1.13, 1.56), with higher education level (AOR = 1.03; 95% CI: 1.01, 1.06), and who had higher income (AOR = 1.34; 95% CI: 1.02, 1.78) were more likely to practice preventive measures. Further, the belief in the body’s immunity to resist the disease (AOR = 0.27; 95% CI: 0.11, 0.67), lack of paying attention to the disease (AOR = 0.07; 95% CI: 0.01, 0.73), ignorance of evidence to the disease (AOR = 0.31; 95% CI: 0.13, 0.74), ease of restriction of movements (AOR = 0.29; 95% CI: 0.12, 0.72), lack of sensitization to actions in the community (AOR = 0.39; 95% CI: 0.16, 0.96), and substance use (AOR = 0.11; 95% CI: 0.05, 0.21) were other factors that were inversely related to practicing preventive measures. Conclusions The findings suggested that more intervention efforts, by either communicating to or reaching out all groups, should be employed. All segments of the population should be equipped with the facts that effectively support them practice preventive measures against the disease. Finally, the results suggested that youths should abstain from substance use, keep their distance in their pastime and avoid crowdings."
https://openalex.org/W3137038347,"Leukemias are challenging diseases to treat due, in part, to interactions between leukemia cells and the bone marrow microenvironment (BMME) that contribute significantly to disease progression. Studies have shown that leukemic cells secrete C-chemokine (C-C motif) ligand 3 (CCL3), to disrupt the BMME resulting in loss of hematopoiesis and support of leukemic cell survival and proliferation. In this study, a murine model of blast crisis chronic myelogenous leukemia (bcCML) that expresses the translocation products BCR/ABL and Nup98/HoxA9 was used to determine the role of CCL3 in BMME regulation. Leukemic cells derived from CCL3−/− mice were shown to minimally engraft in a normal BMME, thereby demonstrating that CCL3 signaling was necessary to recapitulate bcCML disease. Further analysis showed disruption in hematopoiesis within the BMME in the bcCML model. To rescue the altered BMME, therapeutic inhibition of CCL3 signaling was investigated using bone-targeted nanoparticles (NP) to deliver Maraviroc, an inhibitor of C-C chemokine receptor type 5 (CCR5), a CCL3 receptor. NP-mediated Maraviroc delivery partially restored the BMME, significantly reduced leukemic burden, and improved survival. Overall, our results demonstrate that inhibiting CCL3 via CCR5 antagonism is a potential therapeutic approach to restore normal hematopoiesis as well as reduce leukemic burden within the BMME."
https://openalex.org/W3137117197,"The novel Coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) is a global pandemic with an increasing public health concern. Due to the non-availability of a vaccine against the disease, non-pharmaceutical interventions constitute major preventive and control measures. However, inadequate knowledge about the disease and poor perception might limit compliance. This study examined COVID-19-related knowledge, practices, perceptions and associated factors amongst undergraduate veterinary medical students in Nigeria. A cross-sectional web survey was employed to collect data from 437 consenting respondents using pre-tested self-administered questionnaire (August 2020). Demographic factors associated with the knowledge and adoption of recommended preventive practices towards COVID-19 were explored using multivariate logistic regression at P ≤ 0.05. The respondents' mean knowledge and practice scores were 22.7 (SD ± 3.0) and 24.1 (SD ± 2.9), respectively with overall 63.4% and 88.8% displaying good knowledge and satisfactory practice levels. However, relatively lower proportions showed adherence to avoid touching face or nose (19.5%), face mask-wearing (58.1%), and social distancing (57.4%). Being in the 6th year of study (OR = 3.18, 95%CI: 1.62-6.26, P = 0.001) and female (OR = 2.22, 95% CI = 1.11-4.41, P = 0.024) were significant positive predictors of good knowledge and satisfactory practices, respectively. While only 30% of the respondents perceived the pandemic as a scam or a disease of the elites (24.0%), the respondents were worried about their academics being affected negatively (55.6%). Veterinary Medical Students in Nigeria had good knowledge and satisfactory preventive practices towards COVID-19; albeit with essential gaps in the key non-pharmaceutical preventive measures recommended by the WHO. Therefore, there is a need to step up enlightenment and targeted campaigns about COVID-19 pandemic."
https://openalex.org/W3136275420,"Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) causes malignant carcinomas including B cell lymphomas accompanied by the systemic inflammation. Previously, we observed that phosphatidylserine (PS)-exposing subset of extracellular vesicles (EVs) secreted from an EBV strain Akata-transformed lymphoma (Akata EVs) convert surrounding phagocytes into tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) via induction of inflammatory response, which is in part mediated by EBV-derived micro RNAs. However, it is still unclear about EV-carried other potential inflammatory factors associated with TAM formation in EBV lymphomas. To this end, we sought to explore proteomic and phospholipidomic profiles of PS-exposing EVs derived from EBV-transformed lymphomas. Mass spectrometric analysis revealed that several immunomodulatory proteins including integrin αLβ2 and fibroblast growth factor 2 (FGF2) were highly expressed in PS-exposing Akata EVs compared with another EBV strain B95-8-transformed lymphoma-derived counterparts which significantly lack TAM-inducing ability. Pharmacological inhibition of either integrin αLβ2 or FGF2 hampered cytokine induction in monocytic cultured cells elicited by PS-exposing Akata EVs, suggesting the involvement of these proteins in EV-mediated TAM induction in EBV lymphomas. In addition, phospholipids containing precursors of immunomodulatory lipid mediators were also enriched in PS-exposing Akata EVs compared with B95-8 counterparts. Phospholipidomic analysis of fractionated Akata EVs by density gradient centrifugation further demonstrated that PS-exposing Akata EVs might be identical to certain Akata EVs in low density fractions containing exosomes. Therefore, we concluded that a variety of immunomodulatory cargo molecules in a certain EV subtype are presumably conducive to the development of EBV lymphomas."
https://openalex.org/W3137265576,"The microplate assay with Chinese Hamster Ovary (CHO) cells is currently used as a safety test to monitor the residual pertussis toxin (PT) amount in acellular pertussis antigens prior to vaccine formulation. The assay is based on the findings that the exposure of CHO cells to PT results in a concentration-dependent clustering response which can be used to estimate the amount of PT in a sample preparation. A major challenge with the current CHO cell assay methodology is that scoring of PT-induced clustering is dependent on subjective operator visual assessment using light microscopy. In this work, we have explored the feasibility of replacing the microscopy readout for the CHO cell assay with the xCELLigence Real-Time Cell Analysis system (ACEA BioSciences, a part of Agilent). The xCELLigence equipment is designed to monitor cell adhesion and growth. The electrical impedance generated from cell attachment and proliferation is quantified via gold electrodes at the bottom of the cell culture plate wells, which is then translated into a unitless readout called cell index. Results showed significant decrease in the cell index readouts of CHO cells exposed to PT compared to the cell index of unexposed CHO cells. Similar endpoint concentrations were obtained when the PT reference standard was titrated with either xCELLigence or microscopy. Testing genetically detoxified pertussis samples unspiked or spiked with PT further supported the sensitivity and reproducibility of the xCELLigence assay in comparison with the conventional microscopy assay. In conclusion, the xCELLigence RTCA system offers an alternative automated and higher throughput method for evaluating PT-induced clustering in CHO cells."

In the Tropics, urban trees’ seed origins have rarely been characterized. Yet, understanding the social dynamics linked to tree planting is critical given their influence on the distribution of associated genetic diversity. This study examines elements of these dynamics (seed exchange networks) in an emblematic indigenous fruit tree species from Central Africa, the African plum tree ( Dacryodes edulis , Burseraceae), within the urban context of Yaoundé. We further evaluate the consequences of these social dynamics on the distribution of the genetic diversity of the species in the city. Urban trees were planted predominantly using seeds sourced from outside the city, resulting in a level of genetic diversity as high in Yaoundé as in a whole region of production of the species. Debating the different drivers that foster the genetic diversity in planted urban trees, the study argues that cities and urban dwellers can unconsciously act as effective guardians of indigenous tree genetic diversity."
https://openalex.org/W3139186379,"Biological invasions have created detrimental impacts in freshwater ecosystems. As non-native freshwater species include economically beneficial, but also harmful, species, trait-based risk assessments can be used to identify and prevent the import of potentially invasive species. Freshwater fishes are one of the most evaluated freshwater taxa to date. However, such assessments have mostly been done in sub-temperate to temperate regions, with a general lack of such research in the tropics. In view of this knowledge gap, this study aims to determine if a different set of traits are associated with successful establishment of non-native fishes within the tropics. In tropical Southeast Asia, Singapore represents a suitable model site to perform an invasive species trait-based risk assessment for the tropical region given its susceptibility to the introduction and establishment of non-native freshwater fishes and lack of stringent fish import regulation. A quantitative trait-based risk assessment was performed using random forest to determine the relative importance of species attributes associated with the successful establishment of introduced freshwater fishes in Singapore. Species having a match in climate, prior invasion success, lower absolute fecundity, higher trophic level, and involvement in the aquarium trade were found to have higher establishment likelihood (as opposed to native distributional range and maximum size being among the commonly identified predictors in subtropical/temperate trait-based risk assessments). To minimize invasive risk, incoming freshwater fishes could be screened in future for such traits, allowing lists of prohibited or regulated species to be updated. The findings could also potentially benefit the development of invasive species action plans and inform management decisions in the Southeast Asian region. Considering a geographical bias in terms of having relatively less documentation of biological invasions in the tropics, particularly Asia, this study highlights the need to perform more of such risk assessments in other parts of the tropics."
https://openalex.org/W3136974141,"Suppressors of cytokine signaling (SOCS) provide negative regulation of inflammatory reaction. The role and precise cellular mechanisms of SOCS1 in control of endothelial dysfunction and barrier compromise associated with acute lung injury remain unexplored. Our results show that siRNA-mediated SOCS1 knockdown augmented lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced pulmonary endothelial cell (EC) permeability and enhanced inflammatory response. Consistent with in vitro data, EC-specific SOCS1 knockout mice developed more severe lung vascular leak and accumulation of inflammatory cells in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid. SOCS1 overexpression exhibited protective effects against LPS-induced endothelial permeability and inflammation, which were dependent on microtubule (MT) integrity. Biochemical and image analysis of unstimulated EC showed SOCS1 association with the MT, while challenge with LPS or MT depolymerizing agent colchicine impaired this association. SOCS1 directly interacted with N2 domains of MT-associated proteins CLIP-170 and CLASP2. Furthermore, N-terminal region of SOCS1 was indispensable for these interactions and SOCS1-ΔN mutant lacking N-terminal 59 amino acids failed to rescue LPS-induced endothelial dysfunction. Depletion of endogenous CLIP-170 or CLASP2 abolished SOCS1 interaction with Toll-like receptor-4 and Janus kinase-2 leading to impairment of SOCS1 inhibitory effects on LPS-induced inflammation. Altogether, these findings suggest that endothelial barrier protective and anti-inflammatory effects of SOCS1 are critically dependent on its targeting to the MT."
https://openalex.org/W3137501888,"Dirigent-jacalin (D-J) genes belong to the plant chimeric lectin family, and play vital roles in plant growth and resistance to abiotic and biotic stresses. To explore the functions of the D-J family in the growth and development of Moso bamboo (Phyllostachys edulis), their physicochemical properties, phylogenetic relationships, gene and protein structures, and expression patterns were analyzed in detail. Four putative PeD-J genes were identified in the Moso bamboo genome, and microsynteny and phylogenetic analyses indicated that they represent a new branch in the evolution of plant lectins. PeD-J proteins were found to be composed of a dirigent domain and a jacalin-related lectin domain, each of which contained two different motifs. Multiple sequence alignment and homologous modeling analysis indicated that the three-dimensional structure of the PeD-J proteins was significantly different compared to other plant lectins, primarily due to the tandem dirigent and jacalin domains. We surveyed the upstream putative promoter regions of the PeD-Js and found that they mainly contained cis-acting elements related to hormone and abiotic stress response. An analysis of the expression patterns of root, leaf, rhizome and panicle revealed that four PeD-J genes were highly expressed in the panicle, indicating that they may be required during the formation and development of several different tissue types in Moso bamboo. Moreover, PeD-J genes were shown to be involved in the rapid growth and development of bamboo shoots. Quantitative Real-time PCR (qRT PCR) assays further verified that D-J family genes were responsive to hormones and stresses. The results of this study will help to elucidate the biological functions of PeD-Js during bamboo growth, development and stress response."
https://openalex.org/W3137517714,"Chemical castration in prostate cancer can be achieved with gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) agonists or antagonists. Their effects differ by the initial flare of gonadotropin and testosterone secretion with agonists and the immediate pituitary-testicular suppression by antagonists. While both suppress luteinizing hormone (LH) and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) initially, a rebound in FSH levels occurs during agonist treatment. This rebound is potentially harmful, taken the expression of FSH receptors (R) in prostate cancer tissue. We herein assessed the role of FSH in promoting the growth of androgen-independent (PC-3, DU145) and androgen-dependent (VCaP) human prostate cancer cell line xenografts in nude mice. Gonadotropins were suppressed with the GnRH antagonist degarelix, and effects of add-back human recombinant FSH were assessed on tumor growth. All tumors expressed GnRHR and FSHR, and degarelix treatment suppressed their growth. FSH supplementation reversed the degarelix-evoked suppression of PC-3 tumors, both in preventive (degarelix and FSH treatment started upon cell inoculation) and therapeutic (treatments initiated 3 weeks after cell inoculation) setting. A less marked, though significant FSH effect occurred in DU145, but not in VCaP xenografts. FSHR expression in the xenografts supports direct FSH stimulation of tumor growth. Testosterone supplementation, to maintain the VCaP xenografts, apparently masked the FSH effect on their growth. Treatment with the LH analogue hCG did not affect PC-3 tumor growth despite their expression of luteinizing hormone/choriongonadotropin receptor. In conclusion, FSH, but not LH, may directly stimulate the growth of androgen-independent prostate cancer, suggesting that persistent FSH suppression upon GnRH antagonist treatment offers a therapeutic advantage over agonist."
https://openalex.org/W3138784179,"Globally, tuberculosis takes the first rank for the ill-health of people living with HIV/AIDS. Despite the favorable outcome of antiretroviral therapy, the risk of tuberculosis remains higher among HIV patients. This obliges to identify factors for its occurrence and further prevention of drug-resistant tuberculosis. There is a contradiction between different studies and studies conducted in Ethiopia studied poorly the association between adherence to antiretroviral therapy and viral load with tuberculosis. Studies conducted in the study area were limited to cross-sectional study design. Therefore, this study claimed to identify factors determining the occurrence of tuberculosis after initiation of antiretroviral therapy.This study was conducted at Dessie Referral Hospital by using a case-control study design on a sample of 565 with a control: case ratio of 3:1. Participants from controls were selected by systematic random sampling and from cases by consecutive random sampling. The data were collected by interviewing through structured questionnaires and from the medical record. The data were entered into Epi data version 3.1. In the multivariable analysis, variables with a P-value of ≤0.05 were anticipated as independent determinant factors.Patients without separate kitchen (AOR: 3.547, 95% CI: 2.137, 5.888), having opportunistic infection (AOR: 3.728, 95% CI: 2.058, 6.753), CD4 count of <350 cells/mm3 (AOR: 3.383, 95% CI: 1.520, 7.528), baseline WHO stage III (AOR: 3.321, 95% CI: 1.688, 6.534) or IV (AOR: 2.900, 95% CI: 1.251, 6.722), don't taking IPT (AOR: 3.701, 95% CI: 2.228, 6.147) and those who were poorly adherent (AOR: 2.626, 95% CI: 1.272, 5.423) or moderately adherent (AOR: 3.455, 95% CI: 1.885, 6.335) to anti-retroviral therapy were more likely to develop tuberculosis after anti-retroviral therapy initiation.Poor housing conditions, having an opportunistic infection, low CD4 count, starting ART at the advanced HIV stage, don't take IPT, and being poorly adherent to antiretroviral therapy were associated with the occurrence of TB after initiation of ART. The institution should screen for TB as early as possible and strictly follow their drug adherence."
https://openalex.org/W3139079310,"Brain acid signaling plays important roles in both physiological and disease conditions. One key neuronal metabotropic proton receptor in the brain is GPR68, which contributes to hippocampal long-term potentiation (LTP) and mediates neuroprotection in acidotic and ischemic conditions. Here, to gain greater understanding of GPR68 function in the brain, we performed mRNA-Seq analysis in mice. First, we studied sham-operated animals to determine baseline expression. Compared to wild type (WT), GPR68−/− (KO) brain downregulated genes that are enriched in Gene Ontology (GO) terms of misfolding protein binding, response to organic cyclic compounds, and endoplasmic reticulum chaperone complex. Next, we examined the expression profile following transient middle cerebral artery occlusion (tMCAO). tMCAO-upregulated genes cluster to cytokine/chemokine-related functions and immune responses, while tMCAO-downregulated genes cluster to channel activities and synaptic signaling. For proton-sensitive receptors, tMCAO downregulated ASIC1a and upregulated GPR4 and GPR65, but had no effect on ASIC2, PAC, or GPR68. GPR68 deletion did not alter the expression of these proton receptors, either at baseline or after ischemia. Lastly, we performed GeneVenn analysis of differential genes at baseline and post-tMCAO. Ischemia upregulated the expression of three hemoglobin genes, along with H2-Aa, Ppbp, Siglece, and Tagln, in WT but not in KO. Immunostaining showed that tMCAO-induced hemoglobin localized to neurons. Western blot analysis further showed that hemoglobin induction is GPR68-dependent. Together, these data suggest that GPR68 deletion at baseline disrupts chaperone functions and cellular signaling responses and imply a contribution of hemoglobin-mediated antioxidant mechanism to GPR68-dependent neuroprotection in ischemia."
https://openalex.org/W3133809204,"The present study aimed to explore specific mechanisms involved in mediating the neuroprotective effects of Smad ubiquitination regulatory factor 2 (Smurf2) in cerebral ischemic injury. A middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) mouse model and an oxygen-glucose deprivation (OGD)-treated neuron model were developed. The expression of Smurf2, Yin Yang 1 (YY1), hypoxia-inducible factor-1 alpha (HIF1α), and DNA damage-inducible transcript 4 gene (DDIT4) was analyzed. Thereafter, the expression of Smurf2, YY1, HIF1α, and DDIT4 was altered in the MCAO mice and OGD-treated neurons. Apoptosis in tissues and cerebral infarction were assessed. In neurons, the expression of apoptosis-related proteins, viability, and apoptosis were assessed, followed by evaluation of lactate dehydrogenase leakage rate. The interaction between Smurf2 and YY1 was analyzed by coimmunoprecipitation assay and that between YY1 ubiquitination by in vivo ubiquitination experiment. The results showed downregulation of Smurf2 and upregulation of YY1, HIF1α, and DDIT4 in both MCAO mice and OGD-treated neurons. Smurf2 elevated YY1 ubiquitination and degradation, and YY1 increased HIF1α expression to promote DDIT4 in neurons. Overexpressed Smurf2 or downregulated YY1, HIF1α, or DDIT4 reduced the volume of cerebral infarction and apoptosis in MCAO mice, while enhancing cell viability and reducing apoptosis and lactate dehydrogenase leakage in OGD-treated neurons. In summary, our findings elucidated a neuroprotective role of Smurf2 in cerebral ischemic injury via inactivation of the YY1/HIF1α/DDIT4 axis."
https://openalex.org/W3136507010,"Muscle may contribute to the systemic inflammatory environment during critical illness, but leukocyte interaction and cytokine influence on muscle and its response has not been fully explored in this context. Using an in vivo model of intratracheal lipopolysaccharide (IT LPS)-induced acute lung injury, we show that skeletal muscle rapidly responds with expression of proinflammatory genes, which may be explained by migration of LPS into the circulation. Treatment of mature C2C12 myotubes with LPS at a level achieved in the circulation following IT LPS elicited a proinflammatory cytokine expression profile similar to that of in vivo murine muscle following IT LPS. Stimulation with toll-like receptor (TLR) 2 and 3 agonists provoked comparable responses in C2C12 myotubes. Additionally, co-cultures of C2C12 myotubes and bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDM) identified the capacity of macrophages to increase myotube proinflammatory gene expression, with tumor necrosis factor-α (TNFα) gene and protein expression largely attributable to BMDM. To investigate the contribution of TNFα in the synergy of the co-culture environment, C2C12 myotubes were treated with recombinant TNFα, co-cultures were established using TNF-deficient BMDM, and co-cultures were also depleted of TNFα using antibodies. To determine whether the in vitro observations were relevant in vivo, mice received intramuscular administration of LPS ± TNFα or TNFα-neutralizing antibodies and showed that TNFα is both sufficient and necessary to induce synergistic cytokine release from muscle. Taken together, these data demonstrate how skeletal muscle tissue may contribute proinflammatory cytokines following acute endotoxin injury and the potential of leukocytes to augment this response via TNFα secretion."
https://openalex.org/W3136595967,"Gene silencing in plants using topical dsRNA is a new approach that has the potential to be a sustainable component of the agricultural production systems of the future. However, more research is needed to enable this technology as an economical and efficacious supplement to current crop protection practices. Systemic gene silencing is one key enabling aspect. The objective of this research was to better understand topically-induced, systemic transgene silencing in Nicotiana benthamiana . A previous report details sequencing of the integration site of the Green Fluorescent Protein (GFP) transgene in the well-known N . benthamiana GFP16C event. This investigation revealed an inadvertent co-integration of part of a bacterial transposase in this line. To determine the effect of this transgene configuration on systemic silencing, new GFP transgenic lines with or without the transposase sequences were produced. GFP expression levels in the 19 single-copy events and three hemizygous GFP16C lines produced for this study ranged from 50–72% of the homozygous GFP16C line. GFP expression was equivalent to GFP16C in a two-copy event. Local GFP silencing was observed in all transgenic and GFP16C hemizygous lines after topical application of carbon dot-based formulations containing a GFP targeting dsRNA. The GFP16C-like systemic silencing phenotype was only observed in the two-copy line. The partial transposase had no impact on transgene expression level, local GFP silencing, small RNA abundance and distribution, or systemic GFP silencing in the transgenic lines. We conclude that high transgene expression level is a key enabler of topically-induced, systemic transgene silencing in N . benthamiana ."
https://openalex.org/W3137275148,"Decabromodiphenyl ethane (DBDPE) is a new brominated flame retardant and is widely added to flammable materials to prevent fire. Because it has been continuously detected in a variety of organisms and humans, it is important to reveal the biological toxicity of DBDPE. However, the influence of DBDPE for female reproduction is unclear. In this study, we investigated whether and how DBDPE exposure affects oocyte development. Female mice as a model were orally exposed to DBDPE by 0, 0.05, 0.5, 5, 50 μg/kg bw/day for 30 days (0.05 μg/kg bw/day is close to the environmental exposure concentration). We found that exposure of mice to DBDPE did not affect the first polar body extrusion (PBE) of oocytes. Strikingly, however, asymmetric division of oocytes was markedly impaired in 5 and 50 μg/kg bw/day DBDPE exposed group, which resulted in oocytes with larger polar bodies (PBs). Then, we further explored and found that DBDPE exposure inhibited the spindle migration and membrane protrusion in oocytes during anaphase of meiosis I (anaphase I), thereby impairing asymmetric division. Additionally, we found that DBDPE exposure suppressed the inactivation of cyclin-dependent kinase 1 (Cdk1), resulting in the decrease of cytoplasmic formin2 (FMN2)-mediated F-actin polymerization in oocytes at the onset of anaphase I. Simultaneously, DBDPE exposure damaged the structural integrity of the spindle and the perpendicular relationship between spindle and cortex. These together led to the failure of spindle migration and membrane protrusion required for oocytes asymmetric division. Finally, DBDPE exposure injured the development of blastocysts, leading to blastocyst apoptosis."

Methods In total, 238 patients treated with luseogliflozin (2.5 mg, once daily) were studied as the safety analysis set. Two hundred and two subjects whose medication was continued over 12 months were investigated as the full analysis set. The subjects were divided into 3 groups based on the estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR): high eGFR ( n = 49), normal eGFR ( n = 116) and low eGFR ( n = 37) groups. Results The body weight, systolic blood pressure, HbA1c and urinary protein excretion gradually decreased from baseline in all eGFR groups. While the eGFR was significantly reduced from baseline in the high and normal eGFR groups, the eGFR did not significantly differ over time in the low eGFR group. There was no marked difference in the frequency of adverse events that were specific for SGLT2 inhibitors among the 3 groups in the safety analysis set. Conclusions Luseogliflozin can preserve the renal function in the medium term in patients with type 2 diabetes and renal impairment without an increase in specific adverse events."
https://openalex.org/W3136340042,"Vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) contribute to the deposition of extracellular matrix proteins (ECMs), including Type IV collagen, in the vessel wall. ECMs coordinate communication among different cell types, but mechanisms underlying this communication remain unclear. Our previous studies have demonstrated that X-box binding protein 1 (XBP1) is activated and contributes to VSMC phenotypic transition in response to vascular injury. In this study, we investigated the participation of XBP1 in the communication between VSMCs and vascular progenitor cells (VPCs). Immunofluorescence and immunohistology staining revealed that Xbp1 gene was essential for type IV collagen alpha 1 (COL4A1) expression during mouse embryonic development and vessel wall ECM deposition and stem cell antigen 1-positive (Sca1+)-VPC recruitment in response to vascular injury. The Western blot analysis elucidated an Xbp1 gene dose-dependent effect on COL4A1 expression and that the spliced XBP1 protein (XBP1s) increased protease-mediated COL4A1 degradation as revealed by Zymography. RT-PCR analysis revealed that XBP1s in VSMCs not only upregulated COL4A1/2 transcription but also induced the occurrence of a novel transcript variant, soluble type IV collagen alpha 1 (COL4A1s), in which the front part of exon 4 is joined with the rear part of exon 42. Chromatin-immunoprecipitation, DNA/protein pulldown and in vitro transcription demonstrated that XBP1s binds to exon 4 and exon 42, directing the transcription from exon 4 to exon 42. This leads to transcription complex bypassing the internal sequences, producing a shortened COL4A1s protein that increased Sca1+-VPC migration. Taken together, these results suggest that activated VSMCs may recruit Sca1+-VPCs via XBP1s-mediated COL4A1s secretion, leading to vascular injury repair or neointima formation."

Living in certain family environments could lead to victimization by domestic violence, especially among families with a poor socioeconomic status, such as the Lahu hill tribe people in Thailand. This study aimed to estimate the prevalence of and determine the factors associated with domestic violence among Lahu children, women, and the elderly. Methods A cross-sectional study was conducted of participants who belonged to the Lahu hill tribe and lived in 20 selected villages in Chiang Rai Province, Thailand. A validated questionnaire was used to collect personal information and information regarding experiences related to domestic violence in the past year from children (aged 5–15 years), women (aged 16–59 years), and the elderly (aged 60 years and over). A binary logistic regression was used to detect associations between the variables. Results A total of 646 participants were recruited into the study, specifically, 98 children aged 5–15 years, 430 women aged 16–59 years, and 118 elderly people. Children who smoked (AOR = 8.70; 95%CI = 1.27–59.45) had greater odds of experiencing domestic violence than children who did not smoke. Women who had a role as a family member (AOR = 1.59; 95%CI = 1.02–2.50), used alcohol (AOR = 3.36; 95%CI = 2.27–4.99), lived in a family with financial problems (AOR = 4.01; 95%CI = 2.52–7.66), and lived with a family member who uses alcohol (AOR = 2.87; 95%CI = 2.20–5.63) had greater odds of suffering domestic violence than women who did not share these characteristics. The elderly who used alcohol (AOR = 3.25, 95%CI = 1.08–9.81), lived with a family member who uses alcohol (AOR = 3.31; 95%CI = 1.26–7.34), or lived in a family with financial problems in the past year (AOR = 2.16; 95%CI = 1.16–8.77) had greater odds of facing domestic violence than the elderly who did not have these characteristics. Conclusion Family financial problems and substance use are associated with domestic violence in Lahu families in Thailand. Health interventions to reduce the use of substances, including training programs to respond to domestic violence, should be promoted for Lahu children, women, and the elderly."
https://openalex.org/W3134533027,"Phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) is essential for mitochondrial respiration in yeast, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, whereas the most abundant mitochondrial phospholipid, phosphatidylcholine (PC), is largely dispensable. Surprisingly, choline (Cho), which is a biosynthetic precursor of PC, has been shown to rescue the respiratory growth of mitochondrial PE-deficient yeast; however, the mechanism underlying this rescue has remained unknown. Using a combination of yeast genetics, lipid biochemistry, and cell biological approaches, we uncover the mechanism by showing that Cho rescues mitochondrial respiration by partially replenishing mitochondrial PE levels in yeast cells lacking the mitochondrial PE-biosynthetic enzyme Psd1. This rescue is dependent on the conversion of Cho to PC via the Kennedy pathway as well as on Psd2, an enzyme catalyzing PE biosynthesis in the endosome. Metabolic labeling experiments reveal that in the absence of exogenously supplied Cho, PE biosynthesized via Psd2 is mostly directed to the methylation pathway for PC biosynthesis and is unavailable for replenishing mitochondrial PE in Psd1-deleted cells. In this setting, stimulating the Kennedy pathway for PC biosynthesis by Cho spares Psd2-synthesized PE from the methylation pathway and redirects it to the mitochondria. Cho-mediated elevation in mitochondrial PE is dependent on Vps39, which has been recently implicated in PE trafficking to the mitochondria. Accordingly, epistasis experiments placed Vps39 downstream of Psd2 in Cho-based rescue.

Notably, stimulating the CDP–Etn Kennedy pathway of PE biosynthesis by Etn supplementation can restore respiratory growth and mitochondrial respiration of psd1Δ cells (5Baker C.D. Basu Ball W.

Roles of phosphatidylethanolamine and of its several biosynthetic pathways in Saccharomyces cerevisiae.Mol. Biol. Cell. 2001; 12: 997-1007Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). The Etn-mediated rescue requires transport of PE from the ER to the mitochondria in a Vps39-dependent manner (22Iadarola D.M. Basu Ball W. Trivedi P.P. Fu G. Nan B. Gohil V.M. Vps39 is required for ethanolamine-stimulated elevation in mitochondrial phosphatidylethanolamine.Biochim. Biophys. Acta Mol. Cell Biol. Lipids. 2020; 1865: 158655Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). This rescue of mitochondrial PE deficiency by Etn supplementation is consistent with the critical requirements of nonbilayer phospholipids for mitochondrial functions (23Gohil V.M. Thompson M.N.

Chem. 2012; 287: 17589-17597Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). However, rescue of respiratory growth of psd1Δ cells by Cho (21Birner R. Bürgermeister M. Schneiter R. Daum G. Roles of phosphatidylethanolamine and of its several biosynthetic pathways in Saccharomyces cerevisiae.Mol. Biol. Cell. 2001; 12: 997-1007Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar) is surprising, considering that Cho is a precursor for the bilayer-forming PC (Fig. 1). Here, we uncover the mechanism of Cho-based rescue of mitochondrial respiration in psd1Δ cells. We show that Cho supplementation stimulates PC biosynthesis via the CDP–Cho Kennedy pathway, alleviating the need for PC biosynthesis from PE via the methylation pathway. The PE, biosynthesized via Psd2, is thus spared from entering the methylation pathway and becomes available for mitochondrial function. Apart from CDP–Cho Kennedy pathway enzymes and Psd2, the Cho-based rescue of mitochondrial PE deficiency also requires Vps39, implicating its role in the mitochondrial PE transport. These findings reinforce the idea that the MRC function specifically requires nonbilayer phospholipids. Consistent with the previous study (21Birner R. Bürgermeister M. Schneiter R. Daum G. Roles of phosphatidylethanolamine and of its several biosynthetic pathways in Saccharomyces cerevisiae.Mol. Biol. Cell. 2001; 12: 997-1007Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar), we found that Cho supplementation can rescue growth of psd1Δ cells in the respiratory (synthetic complete [SC] Lac) medium but can only rescue growth of psd1Δpsd2Δ cells in the fermentative (SC Glu) medium (Fig. 2A). These results indicate that PE biosynthesis via Psd2 is essential for Cho-based rescue of psd1Δ cells in respiratory growth conditions. Next, we asked if PC biosynthesis via the CDP–Cho Kennedy pathway is essential for Cho-mediated respiratory growth rescue of psd1Δ cells by deleting Pct1, an essential enzyme of the CDP–Cho pathway (Fig. 1). Pct1-deleted cells displayed normal growth in fermentable or respiratory media (Fig. 2B); however, deletion of Pct1 in a psd1Δ background abrogated Cho-mediated rescue of respiratory growth (Fig. 2B). Taken together, these results show that Psd2 and Pct1 are both essential for Cho-mediated rescue of psd1Δ cells. Because Psd2 provides endosomal PE as a substrate for PC biosynthesis via the methylation pathway (12Bürgermeister M. Birner-Grünberger R. Nebauer R. Daum G. Contribution of different pathways to the supply of phosphatidylethanolamine and phosphatidylcholine to mitochondrial membranes of the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae.Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2004; 1686: 161-168Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1), we wondered whether this PC is essential for psd1Δ rescue. To test this idea, we used the pem1Δpem2Δpsd1Δ strain where Pem1 and Pem2, the PE methylation pathway enzymes, are deleted in a psd1Δ background. Loss of pem1Δpem2Δ did not abrogate Cho-mediated respiratory growth rescue of psd1Δ cells (Fig. 2C). Taken together, these results suggest that Psd2 contributes to Cho-mediated rescue of psd1Δ cells by providing PE to cells but not PE as a substrate for PC biosynthesis via the methylation pathway. To understand how supplementing Cho, which feeds into PC biosynthesis, could rescue the respiratory growth of psd1Δ cells, we measured the steady state levels of mitochondrial phospholipids. Unexpectedly, we found that Cho supplementation significantly increased mitochondrial PE levels in psd1Δ cells (Fig. 3A). Furthermore, Cho supplementation also normalized mitochondrial PC levels, which are elevated in psd1Δ cells (Fig. 3B). The increased levels of mitochondrial PE upon Cho supplementation are similar to those we had previously observed with Etn supplementation (5Baker C.D. Basu Ball W. Pryce E.N. Gohil V.M. Specific requirements of nonbilayer phospholipids in mitochondrial respiratory chain function and formation.Mol. Biol. Cell. 2016; 27: 2161-2171Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar) and can explain the respiratory growth rescue of psd1Δ cells. We considered the possibility that Cho supplementation may increase the overall abundance of mitochondrial phospholipids, which may explain the respiratory growth rescue of psd1Δ cells. Upon measuring the absolute phospholipid levels per mg of mitochondrial protein, we found that the overall abundance of mitochondrial phospholipids is unaffected in WT and psd1Δ cells with or without Cho supplementation (Fig. 3C). From these results, we infer that the absolute phospholipid levels do not contribute to Cho-mediated rescue but rather that elevated PE is the most likely reason for the rescue. The severely compromised respiratory growth of psd1Δ cells is attributed to reduced mitochondrial respiration (5Baker C.D. Basu Ball W. Pryce E.N. Gohil V.M. Specific requirements of nonbilayer phospholipids in mitochondrial respiratory chain function and formation.Mol. Biol. Cell. 2016; 27: 2161-2171Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 25Chan E.Y. McQuibban G.A. Phosphatidylserine decarboxylase 1 (Psd1) promotes mitochondrial fusion by regulating the biophysical properties of the mitochondrial membrane and alternative topogenesis of mitochondrial genome maintenance protein 1 (Mgm1).J. Biol. Chem. 2012; 287: 40131-40139Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Indeed, we have previously shown that partially replenishing mitochondrial PE levels by Etn supplementation can rescue respiratory growth of psd1Δ cells by restoring mitochondrial respiration (5Baker C.D. Basu Ball W. Pryce E.N. Gohil V.M. Specific requirements of nonbilayer phospholipids in mitochondrial respiratory chain function and formation.Mol. Biol. Cell. 2016; 27: 2161-2171Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Therefore, we asked whether elevating mitochondrial PE levels by Cho supplementation can also restore mitochondrial respiration and found that Cho supplementation restored both basal and uncoupler-stimulated maximal respiration in psd1Δ cells (Fig. 4A). To investigate the biochemical basis of this rescue, we measured the steady state levels of Cox2, a mitochondrial DNA–encoded subunit of the MRC complex IV, which is known to be decreased in glucose-grown psd1Δ cells (5Baker C.D. Basu Ball W. Pryce E.N. Gohil V.M. Specific requirements of nonbilayer phospholipids in mitochondrial respiratory chain function and formation.Mol. Biol. Cell. 2016; 27: 2161-2171Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Consistent with the partial restoration of mitochondrial PE levels, Cho supplementation also partially rescued Cox2 levels in psd1Δ cells (Fig. 4B). The decrease in Cox2 levels has been attributed to the frequent loss of mitochondrial DNA in psd1Δ cells, which results in the formation of petite colonies (5Baker C.D. Basu Ball W. Pryce E.N. Gohil V.M. Specific requirements of nonbilayer phospholipids in mitochondrial respiratory chain function and formation.Mol. Biol. Cell. 2016; 27: 2161-2171Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 10Trotter P.J. Pedretti J. Voelker D.R. Phosphatidylserine decarboxylase from Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Isolation of mutants, cloning of the gene, and creation of a null allele.J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 21416-21424Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, we measured the frequency of petite formation in psd1Δ cells and found that Cho supplementation significantly reduced petite formation (Fig. 4C). These data provide the biochemical basis of Cho-mediated rescue of the respiratory growth of psd1Δ cells. Next, we focused on understanding the mechanism underlying the Cho-based increase in mitochondrial PE levels. Upon steady state phospholipid measurement of purified mitochondria, we found that unlike in psd1Δ cells, Cho supplementation did not increase mitochondrial PE levels in psd1Δpsd2Δ cells, implying that Psd2-derived PE is responsible for elevating mitochondrial PE (Fig. 5A). To understand how Cho supplementation impacts Psd2-catalyzed PE biosynthesis, we performed a radiolabeling experiment using [3H] serine, which enters the phospholipid biosynthetic pathway by incorporation into PS, the substrate of Psd2 (Fig. 1). [3H] serine labeling in the presence of Cho supplementation led to an increased accumulation of the radiolabel in PE at the expense of PC (Fig. 5B), which resulted in a ∼10-fold decrease in the radiolabeled PC/PE ratio (Fig. 5C). These results suggest that the contribution of Psd2-synthesized PE to PC is decreased upon Cho supplementation, and this spared PE can be diverted to replenish mitochondrial PE in psd1Δ cells. We have recently shown that Vps39 is required for Etn-mediated elevation in mitochondrial PE levels (22Iadarola D.M. Basu Ball W. Trivedi P.P. Fu G. Nan B. Gohil V.M. Vps39 is required for ethanolamine-stimulated elevation in mitochondrial phosphatidylethanolamine.Biochim. Biophys. Acta Mol. Cell Biol. Lipids. 2020; 1865: 158655Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). Therefore, we wondered whether Cho-mediated elevation of mitochondrial PE in psd1Δ cells also requires Vps39. Consistent with the requirement of Vps39 in Etn-mediated rescue of the respiratory growth of psd1Δ cells, we find that Cho-mediated respiratory growth rescue of psd1Δ cells also required Vps39 (Fig. 6A). To determine if Vps39 acts upstream or downstream of Psd2 in Cho-mediated rescue, we used the [3H] serine–radiolabeling strategy to determine if the loss of Vps39 perturbs PS, PE, and PC biosynthesis in psd1Δ cells. If Vps39 acts upstream of Psd2, then we expect decreased incorporation of radiolabeled serine in PE and PC. If Vps39 acts downstream of Psd2, then there will be no change in Psd2 activity and the incorporation of radiolabel in PS, PE, and PC will be identical to Cho-supplemented psd1Δ cells. Consistent with this later model, we find that the percent of radiolabeled PS, PE, and PC is the same for psd1Δ and vps39Δpsd1Δ cells (Fig. 6B), and the ratio of PC/PE is unchanged between these two strains (Fig. 6C). To directly test the requirement of Vps39 in Cho-mediated PE elevation in psd1Δ mitochondria (Fig. 3A), we measured the steady state levels of mitochondrial PE in vps39Δpsd1Δ cells with and without Cho supplementation and found that PE levels are not elevated upon Cho supplementation (Fig. 6D). Taken together, these results show that loss of Vps39 does not impair PE biosynthesis via Psd2 but specifically abrogates the delivery of Psd2-synthesized PE to psd1Δ mitochondria. In this study, we sought to determine the mechanism of Cho-mediated rescue of mitochondrial PE deficiency and found that Cho supplementation restores mitochondrial bioenergetic functions in PE-deficient psd1Δ cells by elevating mitochondrial PE levels through a “lipid-sparing” mechanism. Our study has uncovered a novel intracellular phospholipid homeostatic mechanism that maintains the mitochondrial requirements of bilayer and nonbilayer phospholipids via cross-pathway regulation of the Kennedy and methylation pathways of PC biosynthesis. Redundant pathways of PE and PC biosynthesis exist in S. cerevisiae; however, how perturbation in one pathway impacts the flux through the other pathway to maintain homeostatic balance is not fully understood (26Carman G.M. Han G.S. Regulation of phospholipid synthesis in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae.Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2011; 80: 859-883Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar, 27Henry S.A. Kohlwein S.D. Carman G.M. Metabolism and regulation of glycerolipids in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae.Genetics. 2012; 190: 317-349Crossref PubMed Scopus (354) Google Scholar). By analyzing the incorporation of radiolabeled serine into aminoglycerophospholipids—PS, PE, and PC—in mitochondrial PE-deficient psd1Δ cells, we found that Cho-mediated stimulation of PC synthesis via the Kennedy pathway obviates the need for PC biosynthesis from the PE methylation pathway. The “spared” endosomal PE can instead be diverted to the mitochondria to compensate for the lack of mitochondrial PE biosynthesis in cells lacking Psd1 (Fig. 7). This observation raises an important question: what is the molecular mechanism that reduces PE to PC conversion via the methylation pathway upon Cho supplementation? The essential requirement of Pct1 for Cho-mediated rescue of psd1Δ cells (Fig. 2B) suggests that PC synthesis from Cho via the Kennedy pathway is necessary for reducing PE to PC conversion by the methylation pathway. Thus, a possible mechanism by which Cho-derived PC could reduce the flux through the methylation pathway is by inhibiting the methylation pathway enzymes, as has been suggested previously (28Janssen M.J. de Jong H.M. de Kruijff B. de Kroon A.I. Cooperative activity of phospholipid-N-methyltransferases localized in different membranes.FEBS Lett. 2002; 513: 197-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). The requirement of Psd2 for Cho-based elevation of mitochondrial PE (Fig. 5A) implies that PE biosynthesized in the endosomal compartment by Psd2 is transported to the mitochondria. Therefore, we wanted to identify the molecular player(s) required for this trafficking of PE. Our recent study has implicated Vps39 in PE trafficking from the ER to the mitochondria (22Iadarola D.M. Basu Ball W. Trivedi P.P. Fu G. Nan B. Gohil V.M. Vps39 is required for ethanolamine-stimulated elevation in mitochondrial phosphatidylethanolamine.Biochim. Biophys. Acta Mol. Cell Biol. Lipids. 2020; 1865: 158655Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). So, we asked whether Vps39 also plays a role in trafficking Psd2-synthesized PE to the mitochondria. We found that Vps39 is indeed essential for the Cho-mediated elevation of mitochondrial PE levels in psd1Δ cells (Fig. 6D). Importantly, radiolabeling experiments place Vps39 downstream of Psd2 (Fig. 6B), thus eliminating its role in PE biosynthesis. Although currently we do not know whether Psd2-synthesized PE is transported directly from the endosomes or through the ER, the results from this study emphasize a broader role of Vps39 in the trafficking of both the Kennedy pathway–synthesized PE and Psd2-synthesized PE to the mitochondria. One of the important implications of our finding is the possibility of using Cho supplementation as a means to ameliorate mitochondrial dysfunction in human patients with mutations in mitochondrial PISD, a human homolog of yeast Psd1 (7Girisha K.M. von Elsner L. Neethukrishna K. Muranjan M. Shukla A. Bhavani G.S. Nishimura G. Kutsche K. Mortier G.

Phospholipid methylation in mammals: From biochemistry to physiological function.Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2014; 1838: 1477-1487Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar), the same Psd2-dependent restoration of mitochondrial PE by Cho supplementation is unlikely. However, in mammals, as in yeast, a significant fraction of PE is used up in the biosynthesis of PC via the methylation pathway in hepatocytes (31Vance D.E. Phospholipid methylation in mammals: From biochemistry to physiological function.Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2014; 1838: 1477-1487Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar), which can exacerbate PE deficiency in the liver of human patients with partial loss-of-function mutations in PISD (29Zhao T. Goedhart C.M. Sam P.N. Sabouny R. Lingrell S. Cornish A.J. Lamont R.E. Bernier F.P. Sinasac D. Parboosingh J.S. Vance J.E. Claypool S.M. Innes A.M. Shutt T.E. Care4Rare Canada ConsortiumPISD is a mitochondrial disease gene causing skeletal dysplasia, cataracts, and white matter changes.Life Sci. Alliance. 2019; 11e201900353Crossref Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Thus, stimulating PC biosynthesis via Cho supplementation in these patients could spare mitochondrial PE for respiratory function and may ameliorate disease symptoms. Thus, the presence of multiple pathways of PE and PC biosynthesis in yeast and humans could allow for a lipid-sparing mechanism necessary for Cho-based rescue. In summary, our study has uncovered a mechanism by which Cho supplementation can restore mitochondrial function in psd1Δ cells by directing endosomal PE to the mitochondria. This finding further emphasizes the critical requirements of nonbilayer phospholipids for mitochondrial functions. All S. cerevisiae strains used in this study are listed in Table 1. Yeast cells were maintained and precultured in YPGE media (1% Yeast extract, 2% Peptone, 3% Glycerol, and 1% Ethanol) or YPD medium (1% Yeast extract, 2% Peptone, and 2% Glucose) for strains that cannot grow in the YPGE medium. For final culture, yeast were grown in the SC medium (0.17% yeast nitrogen base without amino acids, 0.5% ammonium sulfate, 0.2% dropout mix containing amino acids) with either glucose (2%) or lactate (2% and pH 5.5) as a carbon source (32Amberg D.C. Burke D.J. Strathern J.N. Methods in Yeast Genetics. A Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Course Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY2005Google Scholar). Etn, Cho, or serine (Ser) were added at 2-mM concentrations to the SC media, wherever indicated. Cultures were started at an absorbance at 600 nm of 0.1 and were grown to the late logarithmic phase at 30 °C. The solid medium was prepared with the addition of 2% agar. Growth measurements on agar plates were performed by seeding 3 μl of 10-fold serial dilutions of preculture onto the indicated plates. The pictures were taken after 2 days of growth in the SC glucose medium and 5 days of growth in the SC lactate medium. The petite formation assay was performed by spreading ∼200 cells from the SC glucose medium onto YPD and YPGE plates. Percent petite colonies were calculated by counting the number of colonies grown in YPGE and YPD. KO yeast strains were constructed by one-step gene disruption using geneticin, hygromycin, and nourseothricin cassettes (33Janke C. Magiera M.M. Rathfelder N. Taxis C. Reber S. Maekawa H.

The membrane was then probed with the following primary antibodies Cox2, 1:50,000 (110271; Abcam) and Por1, 1:50,000 (110326; Abcam). Membranes were incubated with anti-mouse secondary antibodies (1:5000) for 1 h at room temperature, and the blot was developed using the Clarity Western ECL reagent (Bio-Rad Laboratories). Phospholipids were extracted, separated, and quantified as described previously (5Baker C.D. Basu Ball W. Pryce E.N. Gohil V.M.

Lees M. Sloane Stanley G.H. A simple method for the isolation and purification of total lipides from animal tissues.J. Biol. Chem. 1957; 1: 497-509Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar). The extracted lipids were first washed with water followed by another wash with 1:1 water:methanol and were then dried under nitrogen gas. Dried phospholipids were resuspended in 100% chloroform and were separated using two-dimensional TLC. Phospholipid spots were scraped from TLC plates and phosphorus from each spot was quantified using the Bartlett method (36Bartlett G.R. Phosphorus assay in column chromatography.J. Biol. Chem. 1959; 234: 466-468Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Oxygen consumption of SC lactate-grown cells was measured using the high-resolution O2K FluoRespirometer (Oroboros) at 30 °C. Each measurement was performed on 4 × 106 cells in 2.1 ml of the SC lactate media. After basal respiration was measured, maximal respiration was determined after injecting 5-μM carbonyl cyanide m-chlorophenyl hydrazone to the cells. Non-mitochondrial respiration was measured after addition of 2-μM antimycin A. Radiolabeled serine, 10 μCi of [3-3H] serine (American Radiolabeled Chemicals catalog number 0246), was added to 5-ml SC glucose cultures at a starting absorbance at 600 nm of 0.1. After 14 h of growth, cells were harvested by centrifugation at 3000g for 5 min followed by washing with cold water. The washed cells were resuspended in 1 ml of Zymolyase buffer (50-mM Tris-SO4, pH 7.4, 1.2 M glycerol, 100-mM sodium thioglycolate, and 1.5-mg zymolyase) and incubated at 30 °C for 15 min with shaking. The spheroplasts were pelleted, resuspended in 250 μl of Folch solution (2:1 chloroform:methanol), and placed on a shaker. After 1 h on the shaker, 50 μl of water was added and tubes were vortexed and again placed on the shaker for 5 min. The sample was centrifuged at 1000g for 2 min for phase separation. The lower organic phase was transferred to a new 1.5-ml tube, and the volume was recorded. The phospholipid containing the organic phase was washed with ∼20 μl of the 1:1 methanol:water solution. The tube was vortexed and centrifuged, and the organic layer was transferred to a new tube. The wash step was repeated one more time. One-dimensional TLC was performed as described previously (22Iadarola D.M. Basu Ball W. Trivedi P.P. Fu G. Nan B. Gohil V.M.

The plate was run with a solvent system of 25:25:1.5 chloroform:methanol:ammonium hydroxide. Iodine vapors were used to detect the phospholipids. PS, PE, and PC were scraped and put into individual tubes for each condition. 1 ml of Ultima Gold Liquid Scintillation Cocktail (PerkinElmer catalog number 6013321) was added to each tube for counting using PerkinElmer Liquid Scintillation Analyzer Tri-Carb 4910TR. Each sample was counted two times. The average of the counts was used for analysis. GraphPad prism software was used to determine the mean ± SD values from at least three biological replicates, which are defined as independent experiments performed on three different days each starting from a different clone.

https://openalex.org/W3136615982,"Having an optimal quality of vision as well as adequate cognitive capacities is known to be essential for driving safety. However, the interaction between vision and cognitive mechanisms while driving remains unclear. We hypothesized that, in a context of high cognitive load, reduced visual acuity would have a negative impact on driving behavior, even when the acuity corresponds to the legal threshold for obtaining a driving license in Canada, and that the impact observed on driving performance would be greater with the increase in the threshold of degradation of visual acuity. In order to investigate this relationship, we examined driving behavior in a driving simulator under optimal and reduced vision conditions through two scenarios involving different levels of cognitive demand. These were: 1. a simple rural driving scenario with some pre-programmed events and 2. a highway driving scenario accompanied by a concurrent task involving the use of a navigation device. Two groups of visual quality degradation (lower/ higher) were evaluated according to their driving behavior. The results support the hypothesis: A dual task effect was indeed observed provoking less stable driving behavior, but in addition to this, by statistically controlling the impact of cognitive load, the effect of visual load emerged in this dual task context. These results support the idea that visual quality degradation impacts driving behavior when combined with a high mental workload driving environment while specifying that this impact is not present in the context of low cognitive load driving condition."
https://openalex.org/W3136886168,"Human-induced pluripotent stem cell (hiPSC)-derived retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) is a powerful tool for pathophysiological studies and preclinical therapeutic screening, as well as a source for clinical cell transplantation. Thus, it must be validated for maturity and functionality to ensure correct data readouts and clinical safety. Previous studies have validated hiPSC-derived RPE as morphologically characteristic of the tissue in the human eye. However, information concerning the expression and functionality of ion channels is still limited. We screened hiPSC-derived RPE for the polarized expression of a panel of L-type (CaV 1.1, CaV 1.3) and T-type (CaV 3.1, CaV 3.3) Ca2+ channels, K+ channels (Maxi-K, Kir4.1, Kir7.1), and the Cl- channel ClC-2 known to be expressed in native RPE. We also tested the roles of these channels in key RPE functions using specific inhibitors. In addition to confirming the native expression profiles and function of certain channels, such as L-type Ca2+ channels, we show for the first time that T-type Ca2+ channels play a role in both phagocytosis and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) secretion. Moreover, we demonstrate that Maxi-K and Kir7.1 channels are involved in the polarized secretion of VEGF and pigment epithelium-derived factor (PEDF). Furthermore, we show a novel localization for ClC-2 channel on the apical side of hiPSC-derived RPE, with an overexpression at the level of fluid-filled domes, and demonstrate that it plays an important role in phagocytosis, as well as VEGF and PEDF secretion. Taken together, hiPSC-derived RPE is a powerful model for advancing fundamental knowledge of RPE functions."
https://openalex.org/W3136914492,"We examine the long-term consequences of restricted access to abortion following a change in the Hungarian abortion law in 1974. Due to a change that restricted access to legal abortions, the number of induced abortions decreased from 169,650 to 102,022 between 1973 and 1974, whereas the number of live births increased from 156,224 to 186,288. We analyze the effects on the adult outcomes of the affected cohort of newborns (educational attainment, labor market participation, teen fertility). We use matched large-scale, individual-level administrative datasets of the Hungarian Central Statistical Office (population census 2011; live birth register), and we estimate the effects by comparing children born within a short timespan around the time the law change came into effect. We apply a difference-in-differences approach, building on the special rules of the new law that, despite the severe restriction, still made abortion permissible for selected groups of women. We control for the compositional change in the population of parents, rule out the effect of (unobserved) time trends and other potential behavioral responses to the law change, and draw causal inferences. We find that restricted access to abortion had, on average, a negative impact on the socioeconomic outcomes of the affected cohort of children. Children born after the law change have had worse educational outcomes, a greater likelihood of being unemployed at age 37, and a higher probability of being a teen parent."
https://openalex.org/W3137374648,"Accounts of empathy distinguish between cognitive (attribution of mental states to a social target) and emotional (sharing of emotions with a social target) empathy. To date, however, little is known about whether and how (interactions between) person perceptions, situational characteristics, and the observer-target relationship affect these constructs. The current study hence investigated (a) how the perceived warmth and competence of different social targets relate to both types of empathy, (b) whether there are differences in empathic responding to positive vs. negative scenarios, and (c) the impact of identification with the social targets. Eighty-nine participants rated cognitive and emotional empathy regarding four stereotypical target characters (student, elderly person, businessperson, alcoholic person) facing diverse positive and negative events. They also rated how warm and competent these characters appeared to them and how strongly they identified with the social targets. Results for cognitive and emotional empathy were partly overlapping, but demonstrated several significant differences, thereby demonstrating the need to investigate the two concepts separately. Notably, stereotypes of warmth predicted both cognitive and emotional empathic responses more strongly in desirable than in undesirable scenarios, which may relate to greater freedom of response to positive (rather than negative) social outcomes permitted by society. Our data show that scenario valence mattered even more for cognitive (than for emotional) empathy because it additionally moderated the effects of perceived competence and social identification. Finally, both cognitive and emotional empathy increased as a positive function of social identification, and social identification moderated effects exerted by perceived warmth and competence (yet differently for the two types of empathy investigated). Together, these findings speak to empathic responses arising from a complex interplay between perceptions (i.e., warmth and competence), scenario valence, and social identification."
https://openalex.org/W3138957956,"In this work, a SEIR-type mathematical model of the COVID-19 outbreak was developed that describes individuals in compartments by infection stage and age group. The model assumes a close well-mixed community with no migrations. Infection rates and clinical and epidemiological information govern the transitions between stages of the disease. The impact of specific interventions (including the availability of critical care) on the outbreak time course, the number of cases and the outcome of fatalities were evaluated. Data available from the COVID-19 outbreak from Spain as of mid-May 2020 was used. Key findings in our model simulation results indicate that (i) universal social isolation measures appear effective in reducing total fatalities only if they are strict and the number of daily interpersonal contacts is reduced to very low numbers; (ii) selective isolation of only the elderly (at higher fatality risk) appears almost as effective as universal isolation in reducing total fatalities but at a possible lower economic and social impact; (iii) an increase in the number of critical care capacity directly avoids fatalities; (iv) the use of personal protective equipment (PPE) appears to be effective to dramatically reduce total fatalities when adopted extensively and to a high degree; (v) extensive random testing of the population for more complete infection recognition (accompanied by subsequent self-isolation of infected aware individuals) can dramatically reduce the total fatalities only above a high percentage threshold that may not be practically feasible."
https://openalex.org/W3176101813,"Spermatogenesis is a highly sophisticated process that comprises of mitosis, meiosis, and spermiogenesis. RNF216 (ring finger protein 216), an E3 ubiquitin ligase, has been reported to be essential for spermatogenesis and male fertility in mice. However, the stages affected by Rnf216 deficiency and its underlying molecular pathological mechanisms are still unknown. In this study, we generated Rnf216-deficient mice (Rnf216-/- ) using CRISPR-Cas9 technology. Knockout of Rnf216 led to infertility in male but not female mice. Rnf216 knockout affected the prophase of meiosis I, as no genotypic difference was observed until 12 dpp (days postpartum). Rnf216-/- spermatocytes were incompletely arrested at the zygotene stage and underwent apoptosis at approximately the pachytene stage. The proportion of zygotene spermatocytes was significantly increased, whereas the proportion of pachytene spermatocytes was significantly decreased in Rnf216-/- testes. Nevertheless, there was no significantly genotypic difference in the number of diplotene spermatocytes. We further revealed that the PKA catalytic subunit β (PRKACB) was significantly increased, which subsequently resulted in elevated PKA activity in testes from adult as well as 9 dpp Rnf216-/- mice. RNF216 interacts with PRKACB and promotes its degradation through the ubiquitin-lysosome pathway. Collectively, our results revealed an important role for RNF216 in regulation of meiosis and PKA stability in the testes."
https://openalex.org/W3135474792,"The functions of long noncoding (lnc)RNAs, such as MEG3, are defined by their interactions with other RNAs and proteins. These interactions, in turn, are shaped by their subcellular localization and temporal context. Therefore, it is important to be able to analyze the relationships of lncRNAs while preserving cellular architecture. The ability of MEG3 to suppress cell proliferation led to its recognition as a tumor suppressor. MEG3 has been proposed to activate p53 by disrupting the interaction of p53 with mouse double minute 2 homolog (Mdm2). To test this mechanism in the native cellular context, we employed two-color direct stochastic optical reconstruction microscopy, a single-molecule localization microscopy technique, to detect and quantify the localizations of p53, Mdm2, and MEG3 in U2OS cells. We developed a new cross-nearest neighbor/Monte Carlo algorithm to quantify the association of these molecules. Proof of concept for our method was obtained by examining the association between FKBP1A and mTOR, MEG3 and p53, and Mdm2 and p53. In contrast to previous models, our data support a model in which MEG3 modulates p53 independently of the interaction with Mdm2."
https://openalex.org/W3136253137,"Background Medical chart documentation is an essential skill acquired in a clinical clerkship (CC). However, the utility of medical chart writing simulations as a component of the objective structured clinical examination (OSCE) has not been sufficiently evaluated. In this study, medical chart documentation in several clinical simulation settings was performed as part of the OSCE, and its correlation with CC performance was evaluated. Methods We created a clinical situation video and images involving the acquisition of informed consent, cardiopulmonary resuscitation, and diagnostic imaging in the emergency department, and assessed medical chart documentation performance by medical students as part of the OSCE. Evaluations were conducted utilizing original checklist (0–10 point). We also analyzed the correlation between medical chart documentation OSCE scores and CC performance of 120 medical students who performed their CC in 2019 as 5 th year students and took the Post-CC OSCE in 2020 as 6 th year students. Results Of the OSCE components, scores for the acquisition of informed consent and resuscitation showed significant correlations with CC performance (P&lt;0.001 for each). In contrast, scores for diagnostic imaging showed a slightly positive, but non-significant, correlation with CC performance (P = 0.107). Overall scores for OSCE showed a significant correlation with CC performance (P&lt;0.001). Conclusion We conducted a correlation analysis of CC performance and the quality of medical chart documentation in a simulation setting. Our results suggest that medical chart documentation can be one possible alternative component in the OSCE."
https://openalex.org/W3137709356,"Retinoic acid-related orphan receptor γ (RORγ) maintains the circadian rhythms of its downstream genes. However, the mechanism behind the transcriptional activation of RORγ itself remains unclear. Here, we demonstrate that transcription of RORγ is activated by heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein K (hnRNP K) via the poly(C) motif within its proximal promoter. Interestingly, we confirmed the binding of endogenous hnRNP K within RORγ1 and RORγ2 promoter along with the recruitment of RNA polymerase 2 through chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP). Furthermore, an assay for transposase accessible chromatin (ATAC)-qPCR showed that hnRNP K induced higher chromatin accessibility within the RORγ1 and RORγ2 promoter. Then we found that the knockdown of hnRNP K lowers RORγ mRNA oscillation amplitude in both RORγ and RORγ-dependent metabolic genes. Moreover, we demonstrated that time-dependent extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) activation controls mRNA oscillation of RORγ and RORγ-dependent metabolic genes through hnRNP K. Taken together, our results provide new insight into the regulation of RORγ by hnRNP K as a transcriptional activator, along with its physiological significance in metabolism."
https://openalex.org/W3136279951,"Background Among adolescents with type 1 diabetes, some experience great difficulties with treatment adherence, putting them at high risk of complications. We assessed the effect of text messaging (Short Messaging Service [SMS]) on glycemic control. Methods A two-arm open label randomized controlled trial enrolled adolescents with type 1 diabetes aged 12–21 years with baseline HbA1c ≥ 69 mmol/mol (8.5%). The intervention group received daily SMS reminders at self-selected times about insulin injections while the control group received standard of care. The patients allocated to the control group were not aware of the intervention. Results 92 patients were randomized, 45 in the SMS arm and 47 in the control arm. After 6 months, median HbA1c level was significantly lower in the intervention arm: 73 mmol/mol (8.8%) in the SMS arm and 83 mmol/mol (9.7%) in the control arm in the intent-to-treat analysis ( P = 0.03) but no longer in the per protocol analysis (P = 0.65). When we consider the proportions of patients whose HbA1c level decreased by at least 1% between baseline and 6 months, we find a significant difference among patients whose baseline HbA1c was ≥ 80 mmol/mol (9.5%) (n = 56): 60% in the SMS arm and 30.6% in the control arm had lowered their HbA1c level ( P = 0.03) in the intent-to-treat analysis but not in the per-protocol analysis (P = 0.50). Patients in the SMS arm reported high satisfaction with the intervention. Conclusions While there is a trend to lower HbA1c in the intervention group, no firm conclusions can yet be drawn. Further studies are needed to address methodological issues as we believe these interventions can support behavior change among adolescents with poorly controlled type 1 diabetes.

https://openalex.org/W3136603237,"There is an increasing interest in a systemic approach to food quality. From this perspective, the copper chloride crystallization method is an interesting asset as it enables an estimation of a sample's 'resilience' in response to controlled degradation. In previous studies, we showed that an ISO-standardized visual evaluation panel could correctly rank crystallization images of diverse agricultural products according to their degree of induced degradation. In this paper we examined the role of contextual sensitivity herein, with the aim to further improve the visual evaluation. To this end, we compared subjects' performance in ranking tests, while primed according to two perceptional strategies (levels: analytical vs. kinesthetic engagement), according to a within-subject design. The ranking test consisted out of wheat and rocket lettuce crystallization images, exhibiting four levels of induced degradation. The perceptual strategy imbuing kinesthetic engagement improved the performance of the ranking test in both samples tested. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report on the training and application of such a perceptual strategy in visual evaluation."
https://openalex.org/W3136683674,"Diterpenoids jolkinolide A and B, were first isolated from Euphorbia fischeriana. In our previous research, 19-(Benzyloxy)-19-oxojolkinolide B (19-BJB), a derivative of jolkinolides, was synthesized as a novel ent -abietane diterpene diepoxide. In this study, 19-BJB showed strong in vitro activity against bladder cancer cell lines. DNA damage which was observed through the interaction of 19-BJB with nucleotide chains and affected DNA repair resulted in the activation of checkpoint kinase 1 (Chk1) and checkpoint kinase 2 (Chk2) in bladder cancer cell lines. In vivo testing in nude mice also proved that 19-BJB revealed a potential inhibitory effect on tumor growth. Additionally, the 3D-QSAR models of jolkinolides were established. Briefly, we proved that 19-BJB could potentially be used as a drug to inhibit the growth of bladder tumor."
https://openalex.org/W3137455578,"Background Asthma is one of the most prevalent non-communicable diseases worldwide. The aim of this study was to characterize the distribution of Brazilian hospital admissions due to asthma among children and teenagers between 1998 and 2019, as well as to analyze hospital admission incidence and mortality rate during the period according to the geographic region, age group and gender. Methods This is a descriptive time trend study using secondary data regarding hospital admissions and lethality registered in the Brazilian System of Hospital Information of the Brazilian Public Health System ( SIH / SUS ) due to asthma (ICD-10) in subjects aged from 0 to 19 years old between 1998 and 2019. The following variables were collected: number and place of hospital admissions classified by the ICD-10, absolute values and frequency by age group, gender and lethality. Statistical analysis was performed by GraphPad Prism version 5.0 software. Results The total number of hospital admissions due to asthma was 3,138,064. It was observed that children aged between 1 to 4 years, living in the Northeast region and males showed the highest number of hospitalizations. A 74.37% reduction over a 21-year period was found. The lethality rate found in the study was 0.06, with the highest rates being from the Northeast region, males and &lt; 1-year-old. Conclusion Hospital admissions were more prevalent in young children, male gender and in the Northeast region. A decrease of hospital admissions and lethality rate was observed in all groups over time. This profile is important for implementing government strategies to lower hospital admissions and decrease costs."
https://openalex.org/W3138041699,"Image analysis is a useful technique to evaluate the efficacy of a treatment for weed control. In this study, we address two practical challenges in the image analysis. First, it is challenging to accurately quantify the efficacy of a treatment when an entire experimental unit is not affected by the treatment. Second, RGB codes, which can be used to identify weed growth in the image analysis, may not be stable due to various surrounding factors, human errors, and unknown reasons. To address the former challenge, the technique of image segmentation is considered. To address the latter challenge, the proportion of weed area is adjusted under a beta regression model. The beta regression is a useful statistical method when the outcome variable (proportion) ranges between zero and one. In this study, we attempt to accurately evaluate the efficacy of a 35% hydrogen peroxide (HP). The image segmentation was applied to separate two zones, where the HP was directly applied (gray zone) and its surroundings (nongray zone). The weed growth was monitored for five days after the treatment, and the beta regression was implemented to compare the weed growth between the gray zone and the control group and between the nongray zone and the control group. The estimated treatment effect was substantially different after the implementation of image segmentation and the adjustment of green area."
