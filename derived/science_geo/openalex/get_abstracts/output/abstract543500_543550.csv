https://openalex.org/W2173466127,"Lewis Cantley and colleagues report an integrated metabolic and transcriptomic study of non–small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cell lines. They show that the activity of the serine/glycine biosynthetic pathway in NSCLC is highly heterogeneous and is regulated by NRF2 and that elevated expression of genes in this pathway confers poor prognosis in human NSCLC. Tumors have high energetic and anabolic needs for rapid cell growth and proliferation1, and the serine biosynthetic pathway was recently identified as an important source of metabolic intermediates for these processes2,3. We integrated metabolic tracing and transcriptional profiling of a large panel of non–small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cell lines to characterize the activity and regulation of the serine/glycine biosynthetic pathway in NSCLC. Here we show that the activity of this pathway is highly heterogeneous and is regulated by NRF2, a transcription factor frequently deregulated in NSCLC. We found that NRF2 controls the expression of the key serine/glycine biosynthesis enzyme genes PHGDH, PSAT1 and SHMT2 via ATF4 to support glutathione and nucleotide production. Moreover, we show that expression of these genes confers poor prognosis in human NSCLC. Thus, a substantial fraction of human NSCLCs activates an NRF2-dependent transcriptional program that regulates serine and glycine metabolism and is linked to clinical aggressiveness."

To identify further susceptibility loci for this common, complex skin disease, we performed a meta-analysis of >15 million genetic variants in 21,399 cases and 95,464 controls from populations of European, African, Japanese and Latino ancestry, followed by replication in 32,059 cases and 228,628 controls from 18 studies. We identified ten new risk loci, bringing the total number of known atopic dermatitis risk loci to 31 (with new secondary signals at four of these loci). Notably, the new loci include candidate genes with roles in the regulation of innate host defenses and T cell function, underscoring the important contribution of (auto)immune mechanisms to atopic dermatitis pathogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W2152963050,"Toll-like receptor 5 (TLR5) expression is found to be enriched in mouse dorsal root ganglion (DRG) A-fiber neurons known to mediate mechanical allodynia, a form of chronic neuropathic pain. Selective silencing of both mouse and human DRG A-fiber neurons is achieved by co-application of the TLR5 ligand flagellin and the lidocaine derivative QX-314, which is also sufficient to reverse mechanical allodynia in three different mouse models of chronic neuropathic pain. Mechanical allodynia, induced by normally innocuous low-threshold mechanical stimulation, represents a cardinal feature of neuropathic pain. Blockade or ablation of high-threshold, small-diameter unmyelinated group C nerve fibers (C-fibers) has limited effects on mechanical allodynia1,2,3,4. Although large, myelinated group A fibers, in particular Aβ-fibers, have previously been implicated in mechanical allodynia5,6,7, an A-fiber–selective pharmacological blocker is still lacking. Here we report a new method for targeted silencing of A-fibers in neuropathic pain. We found that Toll-like receptor 5 (TLR5) is co-expressed with neurofilament-200 in large-diameter A-fiber neurons in the dorsal root ganglion (DRG). Activation of TLR5 with its ligand flagellin results in neuronal entry of the membrane-impermeable lidocaine derivative QX-314, leading to TLR5-dependent blockade of sodium currents, predominantly in A-fiber neurons of mouse DRGs. Intraplantar co-application of flagellin and QX-314 (flagellin/QX-314) dose-dependently suppresses mechanical allodynia after chemotherapy, nerve injury, and diabetic neuropathy, but this blockade is abrogated in Tlr5-deficient mice. In vivo electrophysiology demonstrated that co-application of flagellin/QX-314 selectively suppressed Aβ-fiber conduction in naive and chemotherapy-treated mice. TLR5-mediated Aβ-fiber blockade, but not capsaicin-mediated C-fiber blockade, also reduced chemotherapy-induced ongoing pain without impairing motor function. Finally, flagellin/QX-314 co-application suppressed sodium currents in large-diameter human DRG neurons. Thus, our findings provide a new tool for targeted silencing of Aβ-fibers and neuropathic pain treatment."
https://openalex.org/W2158258345,"We have recently demonstrated that reactive glial cells can be directly reprogrammed into functional neurons by a single neural transcription factor, NeuroD1. Here we report that a combination of small molecules can also reprogram human astrocytes in culture into fully functional neurons. We demonstrate that sequential exposure of human astrocytes to a cocktail of nine small molecules that inhibit glial but activate neuronal signaling pathways can successfully reprogram astrocytes into neurons in 8-10 days. This chemical reprogramming is mediated through epigenetic regulation and involves transcriptional activation of NEUROD1 and NEUROGENIN2. The human astrocyte-converted neurons can survive for >5 months in culture and form functional synaptic networks with synchronous burst activities. The chemically reprogrammed human neurons can also survive for >1 month in the mouse brain in vivo and integrate into local circuits. Our study opens a new avenue using chemical compounds to reprogram reactive glial cells into functional neurons."
https://openalex.org/W2132921024,"The skin harbors a variety of resident leukocyte subsets that must be tightly regulated to maintain immune homeostasis. Hair follicles are unique structures in the skin that contribute to skin dendritic cell homeostasis through chemokine production. We demonstrate that CD4(+) and CD8(+) skin-resident memory T cells (TRM cells), which are responsible for long-term skin immunity, reside predominantly within the hair follicle epithelium of the unperturbed epidermis. TRM cell tropism for the epidermis and follicles is herein termed epidermotropism. Hair follicle expression of IL-15 was required for CD8(+) TRM cells, and IL-7 for CD8(+) and CD4(+) TRM cells, to exert epidermotropism. A lack of either cytokine in the skin led to impaired hapten-induced contact hypersensitivity responses. In a model of cutaneous T cell lymphoma, epidermotropic CD4(+) TRM lymphoma cell localization depended on the presence of hair follicle-derived IL-7. These findings implicate hair follicle-derived cytokines as regulators of malignant and non-malignant TRM cell tissue residence, and they suggest that the cytokines may be targeted therapeutically in inflammatory skin diseases and lymphoma."
https://openalex.org/W2147351968,"Memories, similar to the internal representation of space, can be recalled at different resolutions ranging from detailed events to more comprehensive, multi-event narratives. Single-cell recordings in rodents have suggested that different spatial scales are represented as a gradient along the hippocampal axis. We found that a similar organization holds for human episodic memory: memory representations systematically vary in scale along the hippocampal long axis, which may enable the formation of mnemonic hierarchies."
https://openalex.org/W2179796260,"Mutations in the PARN gene (encoding poly(A)-specific ribonuclease) cause telomere diseases including familial idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) and dyskeratosis congenita, but how PARN deficiency impairs telomere maintenance is unclear. Here, using somatic cells and induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) from patients with dyskeratosis congenita with PARN mutations, we show that PARN is required for the 3'-end maturation of the telomerase RNA component (TERC). Patient-derived cells as well as immortalized cells in which PARN is disrupted show decreased levels of TERC. Deep sequencing of TERC RNA 3' termini shows that PARN is required for removal of post-transcriptionally acquired oligo(A) tails that target nuclear RNAs for degradation. Diminished TERC levels and the increased proportion of oligo(A) forms of TERC are normalized by restoring PARN, which is limiting for TERC maturation in cells. Our results demonstrate a new role for PARN in the biogenesis of TERC and provide a mechanism linking PARN mutations to telomere diseases."
https://openalex.org/W2179898181,"Animals monitor the outcome of their choice and adjust subsequent choice behavior using the outcome information. Together with the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), the lateral habenula (LHb) has recently attracted attention for its crucial role in monitoring negative outcome. To investigate their contributions to subsequent behavioral adjustment, we recorded single-unit activity from the LHb and ACC in monkeys performing a reversal learning task. The monkey was required to shift a previous choice to the alternative if the choice had been repeatedly unrewarded in past trials. We found that ACC neurons stored outcome information from several past trials, whereas LHb neurons detected the ongoing negative outcome with shorter latencies. ACC neurons, but not LHb neurons, signaled a behavioral shift in the next trial. Our findings suggest that, although both the LHb and the ACC represent signals associated with negative outcome, these structures contribute to subsequent behavioral adjustment in different ways."
https://openalex.org/W2162150779,"The BDNF receptor tyrosine kinase, TrkB, underlies nervous system function in both health and disease. Excessive activation of TrkB caused by status epilepticus promotes development of temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE), revealing TrkB as a therapeutic target for prevention of TLE. To circumvent undesirable consequences of global inhibition of TrkB signaling, we implemented a novel strategy aimed at selective inhibition of the TrkB-activated signaling pathway responsible for TLE. Our studies of a mouse model reveal that phospholipase Cγ1 (PLCγ1) is the dominant signaling effector by which excessive activation of TrkB promotes epilepsy. We designed a novel peptide (pY816) that uncouples TrkB from PLCγ1. Treatment with pY816 following status epilepticus inhibited TLE and prevented anxiety-like disorder yet preserved neuroprotective effects of endogenous TrkB signaling. We provide proof-of-concept evidence for a novel strategy targeting receptor tyrosine signaling and identify a therapeutic with promise for prevention of TLE caused by status epilepticus in humans."
https://openalex.org/W2124895075,"Neural activity in visual area V4 is enhanced when attention is directed into neuronal receptive fields. However, the source of this enhancement is unclear, as most physiological studies have manipulated attention by changing the absolute reward associated with a particular location as well as its value relative to other locations. We trained monkeys to discriminate the orientation of two stimuli presented simultaneously in different hemifields while we independently varied the reward magnitude associated with correct discrimination at each location. Behavioral measures of attention were controlled by the relative value of each location. By contrast, neurons in V4 were consistently modulated by absolute reward value, exhibiting increased activity, increased gamma-band power and decreased trial-to-trial variability whenever receptive field locations were associated with large rewards. These data challenge the notion that the perceptual benefits of spatial attention rely on increased signal-to-noise in V4. Instead, these benefits likely derive from downstream selection mechanisms."
https://openalex.org/W1780009378,"Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is one of the deadliest cancers with an overall survival rate of less than 5%. The poor patient outcome in PDAC is largely due to the high prevalence of systemic metastasis at the time of diagnosis and lack of effective therapeutics that target disseminated cells. The fact that the underlying mechanisms driving PDAC cell migration and dissemination are poorly understood have hindered drug development and compounded the lack of clinical success in this disease. Recent evidence indicates that mutational activation of K-Ras up-regulates eIF5A, a component of the cellular translational machinery that is critical for PDAC progression. However, the role of eIF5A in PDAC cell migration and metastasis has not been investigated. We report here that pharmacological inhibition or genetic knockdown of eIF5A reduces PDAC cell migration, invasion, and metastasis in vitro and in vivo. Proteomic profiling and bioinformatic analyses revealed that eIF5A controls an integrated network of cytoskeleton-regulatory proteins involved in cell migration. Functional interrogation of this network uncovered a critical RhoA/ROCK signaling node that operates downstream of eIF5A in invasive PDAC cells. Importantly, eIF5A mediates PDAC cell migration and invasion by modulating RhoA/ROCK protein expression levels. Together our findings implicate eIF5A as a cytoskeletal rheostat controlling RhoA/ROCK protein expression during PDAC cell migration and metastasis. Our findings also implicate the eIF5A/RhoA/ROCK module as a potential new therapeutic target to treat metastatic PDAC cells.

Despite recent advances in cancer research, pancreatic cancer remains one of the deadliest diseases to date, representing the fourth leading cause of cancer death in the United States.

This is largely due to the rapid dissemination of tumors, which is commonly observed at the time of diagnosis. Indeed, a major cause of the poor prognosis of PDAC is its frequent metastasis to the liver, lungs, and other organs, through extensive local invasion as well as lymphatic and hematogenous metastases (2Bruns C.J.

In mouse models, hematogenous dissemination of PDAC was shown to even precede primary PDAC tumor formation (4Rhim A.D. Mirek E.T. Aiello N.M. Maitra A. Bailey J.M. McAllister F. Reichert M.

Oncogenic K-Ras is believed to be the major driver in this process as its withdrawal resulted in regression of metastasized PDAC cells in mouse models (5Hingorani S.R. Petricoin E.F. Maitra A.

These findings indicate that even advanced stage metastatic tumors remain largely dependent on oncogenic K-Ras expression (7Collins M.A. Brisset J.C. Zhang Y. Bednar F. Pierre J. Heist K.A.

Glutamine supports pancreatic cancer growth through a KRAS-regulated metabolic pathway.Nature. 2013; 496: 101-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (1276) Google Scholar). In fact, mutationally activated K-Ras has been shown to reprogram mRNA translation to enable efficient production of pro-oncogenic proteins and enhance tumor growth in glioblastoma (10Rajasekhar V.K.

On the other hand, mTOR (mammalian target of rapamycin), a regulator of translation commonly implicated in a broad spectrum of human malignancies, may not be critical for oncogenic translation in PDAC, as mTOR inhibition failed to show efficacy in clinical trials (11Wolpin B.M.

These findings suggest that alternative mechanisms operate to modulate oncogenic protein synthesis in PDAC. We recently identified the eukaryotic translation initiation factor 5A (eIF5A) as a critical translational regulator and a novel druggable target involved in K-Ras-mediated human PDAC pathogenesis (13Fujimura K. Wright T. Strnadel J. Kaushal S. Metildi C. Lowy A.M. Bouvet M. Kelber J.A. Klemke R.L. A hypusine-eIF5A-PEAK1 switch regulates the pathogenesis of pancreatic cancer.Cancer Res. 2014; 74: 6671-6681Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). eIF5A is highly conserved across a broad spectrum of species, and is indispensable for normal mammalian development (14Park M.H. The post-translational synthesis of a polyamine-derived amino acid, hypusine, in the eukaryotic translation initiation factor 5A (eIF5A).J.

Essential role of eIF5A-1 and deoxyhypusine synthase in mouse embryonic development.Amino Acids. 2012; 42: 703-710Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Notably, eIF5A is the only protein post-translationally activated by the synthesis of a unique amino acid, hypusine (N-(4-amino-2-hydroxybutyl)lysine) (14Park M.H. The post-translational synthesis of a polyamine-derived amino acid, hypusine, in the eukaryotic translation initiation factor 5A (eIF5A).J. Biochem. 2006; 139: 161-169Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar, 15Maier B. Tersey S.A. Mirmira R.G. Hypusine: a new target for therapeutic intervention in diabetic inflammation.Discov. Med. 2010; 10: 18-23PubMed Google Scholar). Hypusine formation is catalyzed by two enzymes, deoxyhypusine synthase (DHPS) and deoxyhypusine hydroxylase (DOHH). To achieve this unique posttranslational modification, the butylamine portion of the polyamine spermidine is transferred to a specific lysine residue of eIF5A by DHPS. Subsequently, carbon 2 of the transferred 4-aminobutyl moiety is hydroxylated by DOHH. Importantly, each step in the enzymatic reaction is amenable to specific pharmacological inhibition. N(1)-guanyl-1,7,-diamineoheptane (GC7) is an inhibitor of DHPS, and ciclopirox olamine (CPX) is a bidentate iron chelator that inhibits DOHH (14Park M.H. The post-translational synthesis of a polyamine-derived amino acid, hypusine, in the eukaryotic translation initiation factor 5A (eIF5A).J.

Med. 2010; 10: 18-23PubMed Google Scholar). Important recent work has shown that eIF5A and its bacterial homolog, EF-P (translation elongation factor P), both enhance the synthesis of polyproline stretch-containing proteins (17Ude S. Lassak J. Starosta A.L. Kraxenberger T. Wilson D.N. Jung K.

Cell. 2013; 51: 35-45Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar). As polyproline stretches facilitate protein-protein interactions relevant to a range of biological events including signal transduction and cytoskeletal remodeling (20Mandal A. Mandal S. Park M.H. Genome-wide analyses and functional classification of proline repeat-rich proteins: potential role of eIF5A in eukaryotic evolution.PLoS ONE. 2014; 9: e111800Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 21Morgan A.A. Rubenstein E. Proline: the distribution, frequency, positioning, and common functional roles of proline and polyproline sequences in the human proteome.PLoS ONE. 2013; 8: e53785Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar), this raises the possibility that eIF5A has the capability to control cellular processes by modulating the expression of subsets of proteins with polyproline motifs. Emerging work supports this idea as eIF5A does not regulate general protein synthesis, but appears to have evolved to fine-tune the production of subsets of proteins in a contextual manner (22Li C.H.

Anderson P. eIF5A promotes translation elongation, polysome disassembly and stress granule assembly.PLoS ONE. 2010; 5: e9942Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar, 23Mathews M.B. Hershey J.W. The translation factor eIF5A and human cancer.Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2015; 1849: 836-844Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). The above findings have important implications for the role of eIF5A in PDAC, as eIF5A protein amplification may be responsible for fine-tuning the expression of a set of proteins to drive PDAC cell migration and metastasis (13Fujimura K. Wright T. Strnadel J. Kaushal S. Metildi C. Lowy A.M. Bouvet M. Kelber J.A. Klemke R.L. A hypusine-eIF5A-PEAK1 switch regulates the pathogenesis of pancreatic cancer.Cancer Res. 2014; 74: 6671-6681Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). In fact, increased demands for migration-associated proteins may explain why eIF5A expression is increased in several cancers with a high propensity to metastasize including PDAC, liver, and colorectal cancer (13Fujimura K.

The fact that eIF5A is selectively up-regulated in tumors, modulates translation of mRNAs encoding polyproline-containing proteins, and is the only protein known to be hypusine-modified, makes it an attractive therapeutic target to treat metastatic cancer. Such new therapeutic targets and strategies are sorely needed to target the highly metastatic nature of human PDAC. Therefore, we undertook studies to determine the role of eIF5A in mediating PDAC cell migration and metastasis. We show here that pharmacological inhibition of eIF5A hypusination or genetic knockdown of eIF5A inhibits PDAC cell migration, invasion, and metastasis in vitro and in vivo. Proteomic profiling and informatics analyses of eIF5A-depleted human PDAC cell lines revealed networks of cytoskeleton regulatory proteins involved in cell migration and uncovered a functional RhoA/ROCK signaling node that operates downstream of eIF5A in invasive cancer cells. These results indicate that eIF5A activation serves as a rheostat that controls the protein expression of RhoA and ROCK in PDAC cells. Our findings also implicate the hypusine/eIF5A/RhoA/ROCK module as a possible new therapeutic target in metastatic PDAC cells. Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) was from Gibco (Invitrogen).

Human PDAC cells (PANC1, 779E) and mouse PDAC cells (PDA4964 cells: derived from Pdx1-Cre;LSL-KRasG12D/+;p53R172H/+ pancreas (26Reichert M. Takano S. von Burstin J. Kim S.B. Lee J.S.

Wright T. Strnadel J. Kaushal S. Metildi C. Lowy A.M. Bouvet M. Kelber J.A. Klemke R.L. A hypusine-eIF5A-PEAK1 switch regulates the pathogenesis of pancreatic cancer.Cancer Res. 2014; 74: 6671-6681Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). The cells were maintained in DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS (fetal bovine serum), penicillin/streptomycin, gentamycin/glutamine, and sodium pyruvate, and cultured in a humidified incubator at 37 °C with 5% CO2. Cells stably expressing shRNAs or overexpressing eIF5A were generated and maintained as described previously (13Fujimura K. Wright T. Strnadel J. Kaushal S. Metildi C. Lowy A.M. Bouvet M. Kelber J.A. Klemke R.L. A hypusine-eIF5A-PEAK1 switch regulates the pathogenesis of pancreatic cancer.Cancer Res. 2014; 74: 6671-6681Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). For knockdown of 779E with an independent eIF5A shRNA construct, lentiviral particles from Sigma were used (TRCN0000062548; 106 transducing units/ml). For knockdown of mouse eIF5A in murine PDA4964 cells, lentiviral particles containing shRNA against mouse eIF5A were used (Sigma; TRCN0000308824; 106 transducing units/ml). For pharmacological inhibition of eIF5A hypusination, PANC1 cells were grown to 50% confluence in 6-well plates and treated with 25 μm GC7 for 24 h before being processed for Western blotting or transwell assays. 779E cells stably expressing control or eIF5A shRNA were cultured in 10-cm diameter dishes until they reached 70 to 80% confluence and were washed with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). The cells were lysed in a RIPA buffer followed by sonication and soluble fractions were isolated by centrifugation at 14,000 rpm for 15 min. Each of the 80 μg of cell lysates in SDS-PAGE loading buffer were boiled for 5 min, and loaded on a NuPAGE 4–12% BisTris gel (Invitrogen). After separation, the gel was stained with Coomassie Blue G-250 (Sigma) for 3 h. Each gel lane was divided into 16 fractions and each gel fraction was destained by 40% methanol. To remove the cysteine disulfide bond, the samples were treated with 10 mm dithiothreitol (DTT) for 60 min at 56 °C, then 100 mm iodoacetamide was added and further incubated for 60 min in the dark. Each of the reduced and alkylated fractions was digested with 500 ng of trypsin (Promega) at 37 °C overnight. After digestion, the peptide samples were dried and stored at −20 °C. All MS/MS experiments for peptide identification were performed by Agilent 1200 series nano-flow liquid chromatography system and a LTQ linear ion-trap mass spectrometry system (Thermo Scientific) equipped with a nano-electrospray ionization source. The peptides were trapped by the pre-column (inner diameter, 300 μm; length, 1 mm; particle size; 5 μm) for pre-concentration and desalting by solvent A (100% distilled water, 0.1% formic acid, 0.05% acetic acid). The trapped peptides were then eluted from pre-column using a mobile phase gradient (solvent B, 100% acetonitrile, 0.1% formic acid, 0.05% acetic acid) directly onto a reversed phase (RP) analytical column (15 cm × 75 μm inner diameter) packed with C18 (particle size 3 μm). The gradient began at 5% solvent B then ramped to 60% solvent B for 80 min, and finally, ramped 80% solvent B for 20 min at a flow rate of 250 nl/min. The eluent was then introduced into the LTQ mass spectrometer. The LTQ was operated by 2.25 kV spray voltage, 200 °C ion transfer capillary, and 35% collision energy. The analysis method consisted of a full MS scan with a range of 400–1600 m/z and data-dependent MS/MS (MS2) on the nine most intense ions from the full MS scan. The previous fragmented ions were excluded for 60 s. The LC-MS/MS analysis was performed in triplicate for each biological sample. The RAW files were converted to mzXML files by BioWorks 3.3.1 and searched using Swiss-Prot HUMAN database (release 2013) with the MASCOT search engine (version 2.2.04, Matrix Science). The parameters for identification of MS/MS data were 2.0 Da for MS and 0.8 Da for MS/MS, allowing up to one missed cleavage. Carbamidomethylation of cysteine was considered as a fixed modification and oxidation of methionine as a variable modification. The MASCOT scores of individual ions were in the confidence range of 95% probability (significance threshold p < 0.05). Initial peptide filtering was performed using a 1% false discovery rate, which was calculated by a decoy method (27Elias J.E. Haas W. Faherty B.K. Gygi S.P. Comparative evaluation of mass spectrometry platforms used in large-scale proteomics investigations.Nature Methods. 2005; 2: 667-675Crossref PubMed Scopus (606) Google Scholar). Proteins with more than 2-fold differences in abundance in both biological replicates, as determined by spectral counts, were considered significantly affected by eIF5A knockdown and used for subsequent bioinformatic analyses as described below. To enhance the reliability of our profiling, we set the minimum average spectral count cutoff to two per MS analysis. A complete list of proteins significantly affected by eIF5A knockdown by MS analysis is provided in supplemental Table S1. Proteins whose expression levels were significantly altered were subjected to bioinformatics gene ontology (GO) and network analysis. Selected proteins were classified based on protein interaction and biological function using DAVID (Database for Annotation, Visualization and Integrated Discovery: david.abcc.ncifcrf.gov). DAVID calculates a modified Fisher Exact test score using the Expression Analysis Systematic Explorer (EASE) program (EASE score) to measure gene enrichment indicating over-representation within GO terms or pathways defined by PANTHER (28Mi H. Lazareva-Ulitsky B. Loo R. Kejariwal A. Vandergriff J. Rabkin S. Guo N. Muruganujan A. Doremieux O. Campbell M.J. Kitano H. Thomas P.D. The PANTHER database of protein families, subfamilies, functions and pathways.Nucleic Acids Res. 2005; 33: D284-D288Crossref PubMed Scopus (626) Google Scholar). Parameters used for significance for DAVID annotations on pathways were counted threshold = 2 (minimum number of genes for the corresponding GO term) and EASE threshold = 0.1 (maximum EASE score/p value). Network analyses of eIF5A-regulated proteins were performed by STRING program (Search Tool for the Retrieval of Interacting Genes/Proteins), which performs network analysis based on protein-protein interactions. Equal amounts of lysates from control and eIF5A knockdown cells dissolved in LDS sample buffer were separated and transferred onto a nitrocellulose membrane (Whatman). After blocking with 5% bovine serum albumin (BSA) in PBS for 1 h, the membranes were probed with appropriate antibodies and visualized using the enhanced chemiluminescence (Thermo Scientific). qPCR was performed as described previously (13Fujimura K. Wright T. Strnadel J. Kaushal S. Metildi C. Lowy A.M. Bouvet M. Kelber J.A. Klemke R.L. A hypusine-eIF5A-PEAK1 switch regulates the pathogenesis of pancreatic cancer.Cancer Res. 2014; 74: 6671-6681Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Cell migration assay was performed using Corning transwell inserts (Sigma) with a 8.0-μm pore-sized membrane as described previously (29Wang Y. Kelber J.A. Tran Cao H.S. Cantin G.T. Lin R. Wang W. Kaushal S. Bristow J.M. Edgington T.S. Hoffman R.M. Bouvet M. Yates 3rd, J.R. Klemke R.L. Pseudopodium-enriched atypical kinase 1 regulates the cytoskeleton and cancer progression.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2010; 107: 10920-10925Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Cell invasion assay was performed using transwell inserts with 8.0-μm pore size, precoated with basal membrane extract (Trevigen). 1 × 105 cells in 200 μl of serum-free medium were added to the upper chamber and the lower chamber was filled with 400 μl of DMEM containing 10% FBS as a chemoattractant. Cells were allowed to migrate for 16 h and subsequently, fixed by 100% methanol and stained by 0.1% crystal violet (Sigma). After staining, a cotton swab was used to remove non-migrated cells in the upper chamber. The number of migrated cells was counted manually in 5 high power fields (×40). To rule out the possibility that the recorded change in cell numbers on the lower surface of the membrane is not simply due to overall changes in cell numbers, we quantified the total number of cells that attached to and survived on the transwell membranes at the end of the migration period. Cell spreading assays were performed by monitoring cell attachment to type I collagen in real time using xCELLigence system (Acea Bioscience). Briefly, a gold-plated 16-well microtiter plate (Acea Bioscience) was coated with 10 μg/ml of type I collagen (Gibco) for 1 h at room temperature. Subsequently, cells suspended in cell adhesion/spreading assay medium (DMEM + 0.5% BSA) were plated at 1 × 105 cells/well, and their attachment to type I collagen was monitored using xCELLigence system, a real-time, automated electro-sensing platform (30Irelan J.T. Wu M.J. Morgan J. Ke N. Xi B. Wang X. Xu X. Abassi Y.A. Rapid and quantitative assessment of cell quality, identity, and functionality for cell-based assays using real-time cellular analysis.J. Biomol. Screen. 2011; 16: 313-322Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). The impedance of each well surface, which is proportional to the cell spreading area and is displayed as arbitrary units (Cell Index), was recorded at 3-min intervals and plotted against time to generate cell adhesion/spreading curves. Chick CAM (chorioallantoic membrane) metastasis assay was performed as described previously (31Stoletov K. Strnadel J. Zardouzian E. Momiyama M. Park F.D. Kelber J.A. Pizzo D.P. Hoffman R. VandenBerg S.R. Klemke R.L. Role of connexins in metastatic breast cancer and melanoma brain colonization.J. Cell Sci. 2013; 126: 904-913Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Briefly, a 1-cm2 square window was created in the shell of fertilized chicken eggs to expose the underlying vasculature. PANC1 cells labeled with CellTracer CFSE kit (Invitrogen) were suspended in sterile PBS and 3 × 105 tumor cells (100 μl/embryo) were injected into the main CAM vein. After incubating the embryos for 48 h, the chicken livers were removed and imaged using Nikon"
https://openalex.org/W2289881239,"Resistance to the proteasome inhibitor bortezomib is an emerging clinical problem whose mechanisms have not been fully elucidated. We considered the possibility that this could be associated with enhanced proteasome activity in part through the action of the proteasome maturation protein (POMP). Bortezomib-resistant myeloma models were used to examine the correlation between POMP expression and bortezomib sensitivity. POMP expression was then modulated using genetic and pharmacologic approaches to determine the effects on proteasome inhibitor sensitivity in cell lines and in vivo models. Resistant cell lines were found to overexpress POMP, and while its suppression in cell lines enhanced bortezomib sensitivity, POMP overexpression in drug-naive cells conferred resistance. Overexpression of POMP was associated with increased levels of nuclear factor (erythroid-derived 2)-like (NRF2), and NRF2 was found to bind to and activate the POMP promoter. Knockdown of NRF2 in bortezomib-resistant cells reduced POMP levels and proteasome activity, whereas its overexpression in drug-naive cells increased POMP and proteasome activity. The NRF2 inhibitor all-trans-retinoic acid reduced cellular NRF2 levels and increased the anti-proliferative and pro-apoptotic activities of bortezomib in resistant cells, while decreasing proteasome capacity. Finally, the combination of all-trans-retinoic acid with bortezomib showed enhanced activity against primary patient samples and in a murine model of bortezomib-resistant myeloma. Taken together, these studies validate a role for the NRF2/POMP axis in bortezomib resistance and identify NRF2 and POMP as potentially attractive targets for chemosensitization to this proteasome inhibitor.

Indeed, together with other advances, such as the development of immunomodulatory agents, bortezomib has contributed to a doubling in the overall survival of myeloma patients over the last decade (9Mahindra A.

Myeloma cells may be especially sensitive to proteasome inhibitors because protein turnover capacity is reduced during plasma cell differentiation (13Cenci S. Mezghrani A. Cascio P. Bianchi G. Cerruti F. Fra A. Lelouard H. Masciarelli S. Mattioli L. Oliva L. Orsi A. Pasqualetto E. Pierre P. Ruffato E. Tagliavacca L. Sitia R. Progressively impaired proteasomal capacity during terminal plasma cell differentiation.EMBO J. 2006; 25: 1104-1113Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). This increases proteasome load relative to capacity, thereby triggering cellular stress and enhancing reliance on the unfolded protein response for survival, which is easily overwhelmed by proteasome inhibitors through their rapid induction of ubiquitin-protein conjugates. Indeed, the ratio of proteasome load to capacity may determine apoptotic sensitivity to bortezomib, with plasma cells having a high load and/or low capacity showing sensitivity (14Bianchi G. Oliva L.

However, even in patients whose disease initially responds very well to bortezomib, resistance eventually develops in the majority, thereby limiting the reuse of regimens that were previously successful (15Chen D.

We therefore approached this area with the hypothesis that increased proteasome capacity could cause resistance by also modulating the load/capacity ratio in a manner that would reduce cell stress (26Orlowski R.Z. Why proteasome inhibitors cannot ERADicate multiple myeloma.Cancer Cell. 2013; 24: 275-277Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Moreover, we considered the possibility that this could occur by enhancing the efficiency of assembly of the 20S proteasome core particle. This occurs through the coordinated action of proteasome assembly chaperones 1–4 and of proteasome maturation protein (POMP, 3The abbreviations used are:POMPproteasome maturation proteinATRAall-trans-retinoic acidOEoverexpressionqPCRquantitative PCRNTnon-targeting. proteassemblin) (21Marques A.J.

Its expression was sufficient by itself to confer resistance, and POMP activation was associated with induction of an upstream transcription factor, nuclear factor, erythroid 2-like 2 (NRF2), and with enhanced proteasome activity. Finally, suppression of either NRF2 or POMP using either short hairpin (sh) RNAs or a pharmacologic agent restored sensitivity in cell lines, primary plasma cells, and an in vivo myeloma model. Drug-naive and bortezomib-resistant myeloma cell lines were developed and maintained as described previously (27Kuhn D.J. Berkova Z. Jones R.J. Woessner R. Bjorklund C.C. Ma W. Davis R.E. Lin P.

Cell line authentication was performed by our cell line characterization core using short tandem repeat profiling. Bortezomib was removed from the culture for at least 7 days prior to all experiments, unless indicated otherwise, to negate the possibility that proteasome inhibitor-induced oxidative stress was impacting NRF2 and POMP expression. Primary plasma cells were purified from bone marrow aspirates collected from patients under an approved protocol from the Institutional Review Board at the Second Affiliated Hospital of Soochow University after informed consent was obtained in compliance with the Declaration of Helsinki.

Briefly, cell lines or primary samples were treated with the indicated compound for a minimum of 24 h, unless otherwise indicated, followed by the addition of the tetrazolium reagent WST-1. Colorimetric detection of metabolic activity was then obtained on a Victor3V plate reader (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Data were normalized to vehicle controls, which were arbitrarily set at 100% viability, and all data points are represented as the mean with the standard deviation (S.D.). Cells were harvested and lysed in 1× Lysis Buffer (Cell Signaling Technology, Danvers, MA), followed by resolution on gradient gels (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Carlsbad, CA), transferred to nitrocellulose (Bio-Rad), and probed with the indicated antibodies. Primary anti-POMP, anti-NRF2, anti-Kelch-like ECH-associated protein 1 (KEAP1) and anti-cleaved caspase 3 antibodies were from Cell Signaling Technology (Beverly, MA); the 20S proteasome β5 subunit (PSMB5) antibody was from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, and anti-β-actin was from Sigma. Densitometric quantitation was obtained using ImageJ software (National Institutes of Health, rsbweb.nih.gov) and normalized to β-actin and either vehicle-treated or wild-type controls, which were arbitrarily set to 1. Real time PCR was carried out as described previously, with some modifications (28Bjorklund C.C. Baladandayuthapani V. Lin H.Y. Jones R.J. Kuiatse I. Wang H. Yang J. Shah J.J. Thomas S.K. Wang M.

Evidence of a role for CD44 and cell adhesion in mediating resistance to lenalidomide in multiple myeloma: therapeutic implications.Leukemia. 2014; 28: 373-383Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Briefly, total RNA was isolated from cultured cells or tumor tissues using TRIzol (Thermo Fisher Scientific), and cDNA was synthesized using a High Capacity cDNA reverse transcription kit (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). Quantitative (q) real time PCR was performed using the TaqMan Gene Expression Master Mix and the POMP (FAMTM), NRF2 (FAMTM), proteasome β5 subunit, and glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH, VIC®) TaqMan gene expression assays as multiplexed, triplicate samples on a StepOnePlus PCR system (Applied Biosystems). Relative quantification was done using the comparative CT method after normalization to the internal GAPDH control, where all samples were then normalized to wild-type or vehicle controls. Six lentivirus-based shRNAs targeted to POMP, eight lentivirus-based shRNAs targeted to NRF2, or a nonspecific scrambled control (Sigma) were transfected with the packaging vectors psPAX2 and pMD2.G into 293T cells by calcium chloride to produce the lentiviruses. Two days later, the supernatants were collected, filtered, concentrated, and used for experiments or frozen at −80 °C. KAS-6/1 bortezomib-resistant (V10R) and OPM-2 V10R cells were transduced by using lentiviruses with Polybrene (8 μg/ml, Sigma) and infected cells were selected with 2 μg/ml puromycin. The expression of POMP or NRF2 was determined by Western blot analysis and real time PCR. Two of the lentivirus-based shRNAs targeted to POMP, constructs 3 and 5, and two for NRF2, constructs 6 and 8, were validated for further studies. POMP shRNA lentiviral vectors contained two target-specific constructs, CCGGGGGTCTATTTGCTCCGCTAAACTCGAGTTTAGCGGAGCAAATAGACCCTTTTTG and CCGGCTATTGGATTTGAGGATATTCCTCGAGGAATATCCTCAAATCCAATAGTTTTTG. NRF2 shRNA lentiviral vectors also contained two target-specific constructs, CCGGGCACCTTATATCTCGAAGTTTCTCGAGAAACTTCGAGATATAAGGTGCTTTTT and CCGGCCGGCATTTCACTAAACACAACTCGAGTTGTGTTTAGTGAAATGCCGGTTTTT. Sequences from POMP construct 3 were then also used in some transient transfection assays to knock down POMP without subsequent antibiotic selection. Non-targeting shRNAs (KO-NT) or shRNAs targeting POMP (KO-3) were introduced by electroporation using the Neon® transfection system (Thermo Fisher Scientific). pCMV6-XL5 vectors containing POMP or NRF2 cDNAs were purchased from OriGene (Rockville, MD). POMP or NRF2 was subcloned into the lentiviral vector transfer plasmid pCDH-CMV-MCS-EF1-coGFP to generate pCDH-CMV-POMP-EF1-coGFP or pCDH-CMV-NRF2-EF1-coGFP. The recombinant pCDH-CMV-POMP-EF1-coGFP vector, pCDH-CMV-NRF2-EF1-coGFP vector, or the control vector pCDH-CMV-MCS-EF1-coGFP was transfected with the packaging vectors psPAX2 and pMD2.G into 293T cells by calcium chloride to produce lentiviruses. KAS-6/1 and OPM-2 cells were infected with control or either POMP- or NRF2-expressing lentiviruses, and expression was verified by qPCR and Western blotting. Chymotrypsin-like proteasome activity was assayed in a total volume of 200 μl using 96-well plates performed according to the manufacturer's instructions (Promega, Madison, WI). Briefly, Proteasome-GloTM cell-based reagent was prepared by reconstituting the luciferin detection reagent, Proteasome-GloTM cell-based buffer, and the Suc-LLVY-GloTM substrate was then added to an equal volume of samples containing 15,000 cells and incubated for a minimum of 5–10 min before luminescence measurements. Cells were first cross-linked with 2% paraformaldehyde for 10 min at 37 °C and sonicated. DNA-protein complexes were isolated with a ChIP assay kit (EMD Millipore, Billerica, MA) according to the manufacturer's instructions with antibodies against NRF2 (Abcam, Cambridge, MA). The precipitated DNA was purified and quantified by real time PCR. Primers used were as follows: 5′-CCTCCAACCTCATCTCAT-3′ (forward) and 5′-CTGAATAGCTGGGACTACA-3′ (reverse). The results were normalized relative to the input control. Luciferase reporter assays were performed using the LightSwitch Dual Assay System (SwitchGear Genomics, Carlsbad, CA) according to the manufacturer's instructions. KAS-6/1 and KAS-6/1 V10R cells were transiently transfected in triplicate with either empty-luciferase or POMP-luciferase, along with a Cypridina TK control construct and empty pCMV6-XL5 vector or pCMV6-XL5-NRF2 by electroporation using the Neon® transfection system (Thermo Fisher Scientific). The Renilla luciferase/Cypridina luciferase ratio was calculated to normalize for transfection efficiency. DNA-protein binding assays were carried out with nuclear extract from KAS-6/1 V10R cells with 3′-biotinylated synthetic complementary oligonucleotides (Sigma). The sequence of the oligonucleotide used was 5′-CTCCAGCCTAGGTGACACAGCAAGA-3′, and the labeled oligonucleotides were annealed by mixing equal molar amounts of the two single-stranded oligonucleotides, heating to 95 °C for 5 min, followed by ramp cooling to 25 °C over a period of 45 min. Nuclear extracts were prepared using the nuclear/cytosol fractionation kit (BioVision, Carlsbad, CA) following the manufacturer's instructions. Binding reactions were carried out for 20 min at room temperature in the presence of 50 ng/μl poly(dI-dC), 0.05% Nonidet P-40, 5 mm MgCl2, 10 mm EDTA, and 2.5% glycerol in 1× binding buffer using 20 fmol of biotin end-labeled target DNA and 4 μg of nuclear extract. Additionally, 4 pmol of unlabeled probe was added to some binding reactions as a specific competitor DNA. Assays were loaded onto native 4% polyacrylamide gels pre-electrophoresed for 60 min in 0.5× Tris borate/EDTA and electrophoresed at 100 V before being transferred onto a positively charged nylon membrane in 0.5× Tris borate/EDTA at 100 V for 30 min. Transferred DNAs were cross-linked to the membrane at 120 mJ/cm2 and detected using horseradish peroxidase-conjugated streptavidin according to the manufacturer's instructions using the LightShift chemiluminescent EMSA kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Bortezomib-resistant KAS-6/1 cells (7 × 106 cells/mouse) were subcutaneously xenografted into 6-week-old non-obese diabetic/severe combined immunodeficiency (NOD/SCID) mice (NOD.Cg-Prkdc(scid) Il2rg(tm1Wjl)/SzJ; The Jackson Laboratory, Bar Harbor, ME) with Matrigel (BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA) under a protocol approved by the institutional Animal Care and Use Facility. The mice were randomized into four groups with five subjects in each cohort, and treatments were administered by intraperitoneal injection using peanut oil as a carrier three times weekly, starting on day 7 post-implantation. Tumors were monitored by caliper measurement, and tumor volume was determined using the equation volume = 0.4l × w2. The CONTRAST statement in PROC MIXED procedure in SAS (SAS Institute, Inc., Cary, NC) was used to compare the tumor growth rates between each pair of groups. The tumor volume was log-transformed to satisfy the normality assumption of the models. Tumors were removed for qPCR or Western blot assays at the indicated time point. Pairwise differences between the combination group (bortezomib +ATRA) versus ATRA alone, combination versus bortezomib, combination versus control, bortezomib versus control, and ATRA versus control were examined using the ESTIMATE statement in PROC MIXED for each time point.

Our findings demonstrate that plasticity mechanisms are not uniform within the neocortex, even within a cortical layer, but are specialized within subcircuits. The cerebral cortex shows a remarkable capacity for functional plasticity (Feldman, 2009Feldman D.E. Synaptic mechanisms for plasticity in neocortex.Annu. Rev.

A comparison of experience-dependent plasticity in the visual and somatosensory systems.Neuron. 2005; 48: 465-477Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). Broadly, plasticity can take one of two forms: input-specific plasticity, which involves weakening of inactive inputs and strengthening (or weakening) of active inputs, and an input-agnostic form of plasticity, which involves both deprived and spared inputs and acts to maintain neuronal activity at some set point in a homeostatic fashion. Sensory cortex, where input to neurons can be conveniently manipulated by altering sensory experience, exhibits both forms of plasticity. In the barrel cortex, trimming the whiskers leads to rapid depression of the responsiveness of cortical neurons to deprived whiskers and a slower potentiation of responses to spared whiskers (Glazewski and Fox, 1996Glazewski S. Fox K. Time course of experience-dependent synaptic potentiation and depression in barrel cortex of adolescent rats.J. Neurophysiol. 1996; 75: 1714-1729PubMed Google Scholar). Similarly in the visual cortex, monocular deprivation leads to rapid depression of cortical responses to closed eye input followed by slower potentiation of responses to both open and closed eye input (Kaneko et al., 2008Kaneko M. Stellwagen D. Malenka R.C. Stryker M.P. Tumor necrosis factor-alpha mediates one component of competitive, experience-dependent plasticity in developing visual cortex.Neuron. 2008; 58: 673-680Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar). Input-specific and input-agnostic forms of functional plasticity map onto known synaptic plasticity mechanisms. Input-specific plasticity can be explained by Hebbian LTP and LTD and their spike timing-dependent forms (STDP), while input-agnostic plasticity can be explained by homeostatic synaptic scaling. Evidence for this view derives from studies where factors that are required for a particular form of plasticity are blocked or knocked out. For example, cortical LTP depends on auto-phosphorylation of CaMKII, and loss of this process in the CaMKII-t286a point mutant (Giese et al., 1998Giese K.P. Fedorov N.B. Filipkowski R.K. Silva A.J. Autophosphorylation at Thr286 of the alpha calcium-calmodulin kinase II in LTP and learning.Science. 1998; 279: 870-873Crossref PubMed Scopus (877) Google Scholar) blocks potentiation of spared whisker responses in layer 2/3 neurons as well as LTP (Hardingham et al., 2003Hardingham N. Glazewski S. Pakhotin P. Mizuno K. Chapman P.F. Giese K.P. Fox K. Neocortical long-term potentiation and experience-dependent synaptic plasticity require alpha-calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II autophosphorylation.J. Neurosci. 2003; 23: 4428-4436PubMed Google Scholar) and disrupts ocular dominance plasticity in the visual cortex (Taha et al., 2002Taha S. Hanover J.L. Silva A.J. Stryker M.P. Autophosphorylation of alphaCaMKII is required for ocular dominance plasticity.Neuron. 2002; 36: 483-491Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Similarly, synaptic upscaling depends on TNFα, and knockout of tnf, or scavenging soluble TNFα, prevents homeostatic potentiation in visual cortex (Kaneko et al., 2008Kaneko M. Stellwagen D. Malenka R.C. Stryker M.P. Tumor necrosis factor-alpha mediates one component of competitive, experience-dependent plasticity in developing visual cortex.Neuron. 2008; 58: 673-680Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar). While other forms of plasticity exist, such as changes in inhibition and changes in intrinsic membrane properties, LTP, LTD, and homeostatic mechanisms are demonstrably present in cortex and affect excitatory transmission within the cortex. Theoretical considerations suggest that Hebbian plasticity requires homeostatic plasticity to maintain neuronal responses within a normal operating range (Turrigiano, 2008Turrigiano G.G. The self-tuning neuron: synaptic scaling of excitatory synapses.Cell. 2008; 135: 422-435Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1020) Google Scholar, Turrigiano et al., 1998Turrigiano G.G.

Hebbian plasticity, if left unchecked, would tend to drive synaptic weights to saturating maximum or minimum values, whereas homeostatic scaling would tend to normalize a cell’s average response back toward a set point. Recent studies have questioned whether synaptic scaling can be involved in balancing Hebbian plasticity, however, because (a) synaptic scaling acts too slowly to stabilize the neuron following Hebbian plasticity and (b) blocking Hebbian plasticity does not lead to changes in synaptic weights (Chistiakova et al., 2015Chistiakova M.

Agnes E.J. Gerstner W. Diverse synaptic plasticity mechanisms orchestrated to form and retrieve memories in spiking neural networks.Nat. Commun. 2015; 6: 6922Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). These considerations suggest a model in which Hebbian plasticity maintains neural activity levels at a cell specific set point over short timescales, while homeostatic synaptic scaling modulates the strength of neuronal inputs over a longer time envelope. While these theoretical schemes are attractive, recent experimental evidence of cell type to cell type differences in plasticity profile, even within a cortical layer, suggest that a more nuanced description may be required. Specifically, Hebbian plasticity forms appear to be segregated between the two major excitatory cortical cell types of layer 5, the regular spiking (RS) and the intrinsic bursting (IB) pyramidal cells of the cerebral cortex (Jacob et al., 2012Jacob V. Petreanu L. Wright N. Svoboda K. Fox K. Regular spiking and intrinsic bursting pyramidal cells show orthogonal forms of experience-dependent plasticity in layer V of barrel cortex.Neuron. 2012; 73: 391-404Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). RS cells are distinguished by producing regularly timed trains of action potentials in response to somatic current injection; they tend to project cortically and have a distinct morphology comprising a slender apical dendrite with limited branches only near the cortical surface (Agmon and Connors, 1989Agmon A.

In contrast, IB cells produce bursts of spikes to somatic current injection, project sub-cortically, and have complex apical dendrites that branch deeper in cortex, not just at the pial surface (Agmon and Connors, 1989Agmon A.

Neurophysiol. 1985; 54: 782-806Crossref PubMed Scopus (1462) Google Scholar). RS cells tend to show strong synaptic depression in response to whisker deprivation, with little potentiation of spared whisker responses that affects only the short latency component. Conversely, IB cells show potentiation of responses to spared whiskers surrounding those that were trimmed and only limited depression to deprived inputs (Jacob et al., 2012Jacob V. Petreanu L. Wright N. Svoboda K. Fox K. Regular spiking and intrinsic bursting pyramidal cells show orthogonal forms of experience-dependent plasticity in layer V of barrel cortex.Neuron. 2012; 73: 391-404Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). It is not at all clear how Hebbian plasticity alone could maintain these cells at a set activity level under these conditions without the existence of an opposite compensating plasticity mechanism. We therefore sought to understand whether a homeostatic plasticity mechanism was present in RS and IB cells and whether it was possible to separate homeostatic from Hebbian components of plasticity. While RS and IB subtypes can be found in all cortical layers, we concentrated on layer 5 pyramidal cells. We used several methods to distinguish between homeostatic and Hebbian plasticity mechanisms. First, we studied the time course of whisker responses following whisker deprivation, reasoning that homeostatic plasticity should act to move the sensory response back toward the original levels, while Hebbian mechanisms should move spared and deprived whisker responses away from the original levels. Second, we measured whether changes were input specific and therefore Hebbian or were common to all inputs and therefore homeostatic. Third, we looked at the effect of deprivation on synaptic scaling to see whether changes were accounted for by alteration in excitatory synaptic weights and further, whether they scaled multiplicatively. Finally we sought to dissect the molecular basis of plasticity in both cell types by examining plasticity in CaMKII-t286a mutants that lack Hebbian potentiation and TNFα mutants that lack homeostatic upscaling. Our findings revealed that both RS and IB cells exhibit homeostatic plasticity but that it operates at very different rates in the two cell types and that the propensity for Hebbian depression in RS cells is compensated for by homeostatic potentiation rather than Hebbian potentiation mechanisms. IB cells on the other hand showed Hebbian potentiation of spared whisker inputs in combination with homeostatic rebound of depressed inputs, which overall increased their synaptic drive in an uncompensated way, over the 10-day period we studied the process. Experience-dependent plasticity in the barrel cortex is manifested as a change in the responses of neurons to stimulation of the whiskers within the receptive fields. We induced plasticity in barrel cortex by trimming the D-row whiskers (Figure 1A) for a period of 12 hr, 3 hr, or 10 days in C57/BL/6J mice. Recordings were made from the deprived columns, preferentially from D2, identified relative to the blood vessel pattern using intrinsic signal imaging (ISI) in order to target electrode penetrations (Figure 1A). We adopted the convention used by (Jacob et al., 2012Jacob V. Petreanu L. Wright N. Svoboda K. Fox K. Regular spiking and intrinsic bursting pyramidal cells show orthogonal forms of experience-dependent plasticity in layer V of barrel cortex.Neuron. 2012; 73: 391-404Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar) that the somatotopically related whisker for the recorded barrel is referred to as the principal whisker (PW) and its immediate in-row neighbors as T1 and T2, ranked according to strength of their spiking response. The whiskers in the flanking rows are designated as S1–S6. The trimmed whiskers in deprivation experiments are therefore PW, T1, and T2, and the undeprived whiskers are S1 to S6. The PW and the eight immediately surrounding whiskers were stimulated automatically with a pseudo-random sparse noise sequence (Figures 1C and 1D) to record a complete set of PSTHs and whisker evoked PSPs within 2 min (Figure 1E; see Experimental Procedures). RS and IB subtypes of layer 5 cell were identified by their threshold response to somatic current injection (Figure 1B). While RS and IB cells were found throughout sublaminae 5A and 5B, there was a tendency for more IB cells to be recorded in 5B (Figure S1). However, in slice recordings from barrel cortex, it was clear that both subtypes were present in both sublaminae (Figure S1), and there were no differences in depth distribution for the RS and IB cells across the in vivo conditions described below (Figure S1). To determine whether RS and IB cells showed Hebbian and homeostatic aspects of plasticity, we trimmed a single row of whiskers repeatedly over a 10-day period. This method creates an imbalance in the level of activity within the receptive field and in particular removes the strongest input (the PW) from the receptive field. After 3 days of row-deprivation, RS neurons showed maximum depression of both deprived and spared whisker responses (Figures 2A, 2B, S2A, and S2B; F(3) = 3.741, p = 0.0114, average deprived and spared whisker responses, control versus 3 days: q = 4.556, ANOVA with Tukey’s post hoc). After 10 days of deprivation, RS neurons showed a remarkable rebound potentiation back to control values despite the continued deprivation (Figure 2B, q = 1.527, p > 0.05 neither spared nor deprived significantly different from control, ANOVA with Tukey’s post hoc). The rebound potentiation in RS cells and its time course are reminiscent of the homeostatic rebound potentiation reported previously for deprived eye responses in visual cortex (Kaneko et al., 2008Kaneko M. Stellwagen D. Malenka R.C. Stryker M.P. Tumor necrosis factor-alpha mediates one component of competitive, experience-dependent plasticity in developing visual cortex.Neuron. 2008; 58: 673-680Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar, Ranson et al., 2012Ranson A. Cheetham C.E. Fox K. Sengpiel F. Homeostatic plasticity mechanisms are required for juvenile, but not adult, ocular dominance plasticity.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2012; 109: 1311-1316Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Neither the original depression nor the rebound potentiation were input specific, affecting spared and deprived inputs alike (Figure 2A). RS cells therefore show two of the key characteristics of homeostatic plasticity. Deprived inputs to IB neurons showed a similar behavior to that seen in RS neurons but with much faster kinetics (Figures 2C, 2D, S2D, and S2E). In IB neurons, deprived whisker responses were depressed after just 12 hr (Figures 2C and 2D; F(3) = 6.675, p < 0.0001, q = 3.935) and recovered to control values by 3 days (p > 0.05, q = 0.690). Spared whisker responses followed approximately the same time course as deprived whiskers for RS cells, suggesting that a component of the surround whisker plasticity is not input specific and might instead be manifested as global modifications to the synaptic weightings of a cell (Figure 2). These findings suggest that IB cells also show homeostatic plasticity, but with a much faster time course than shown by the RS cells. One aspect of the plasticity exhibited over this period was input specific. The spared whisker responses of the IB cells potentiated above baseline between 3 and 10 days. The spared whisker potentiation was significant (Figures 2C and 2D; Control versus 10 day, p < 0.001, q = 6.773, ANOVA with Tukey’s post hoc) while the deprived whisker responses were not different from their control values (Control versus 10 day, p > 0.05, q = 2.705, ANOVA with Tukey’s post hoc). Note that even though some of the deprived whisker responses look elevated (particularly T2), they are not significantly different from control due to the relatively high variance in the distribution. Rather than a restorative form of potentiation, the potentiation between 3 and 10 days moved the responses away from their original values. These features suggest that IB cells show an additional Hebbian potentiation component to their plasticity. To investigate further the nature of the plasticity, we analyzed the surround receptive field responses by response magnitude. Different whiskers in the receptive field naturally drive the neuron with different intensity, generating a range of response amplitudes. If plasticity scales the responses by a common factor, as with homeostatic scaling, then small responses should be scaled by the same factor as large responses. If the transform is other than proportional it could be indicative of another type of plasticity mechanism such as LTP or LTD. We therefore asked if the plasticity between the deprivation time points could be described by a multiplicative transform. For the RS cells, we plotted the average spared receptive field (surround whiskers one to six, S1–6) recorded after 12 hr of deprivation against their respective average control responses, and obtained a linear relationship between the two with an almost identical slope (Figure 3A, 12 hr deprivation: slope = 0.929 ± 0.118, R2 = 0.94, F(1) = 0.35, p = 0.57, ANOVA), suggesting that a multiplicative process could not describe the initial change at 12 hr. Each whisker response had shifted to a lower value by a similar quantity and therefore the y intercept for the lines were significantly different (F(1) = 80.74, p < 0.0001), indicating a subtractive transformation (possibly indicative of LTD). At 3 days deprivation, the S1–6 responses decreased further and this time did show a decrease in slope (3 days deprivation: for linear fit R2 = 0.94, F(1) = 28.01, p = 0.0007), indicative of a multiplicative transformation. This was then reversed between 3 and 10 days without restoring the subtractive initial depression (10 day deprivation: for linear fit, R2 = 0.90, slope comparison F(1) = 0.249, p = 0.63, 10 day slope not significant versus 12 hr. Intercept F(1) = 0.626, p = 0.45 versus 12 hr), which implied that the rebound potentiation was proportional to the depressed values and that a multiplicative transformation had once again occurred (Figure 3A). Such proportional changes might be observed if global multiplicative scaling were to underlie the homeostatic rebound (Ranson et al., 2012Ranson A. Cheetham C.E. Fox K. Sengpiel F. Homeostatic plasticity mechanisms are required for juvenile, but not adult, ocular dominance plasticity.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

The IB cells displayed both a biphasic and an input-specific series of changes. The S1–6 responses were significantly depressed after 12 hr in a manner that could be described by a reducing multiplicative transform (Figure 3B, linear fit, R2 = 0.9563, slope comparison F(1) = 687.3, p < 0.0001) and recovered toward control levels after 3 days (Figure 3B, linear fit, R2 = 0.9383, F(2) = 0.7391, p = 0.498). The S1–6 responses then potentiated above baseline after 10 days (Figures 2C, 2D, and 3B) without a further change in slope (Figure 3B, 10 days deprivation: linear fit, R2 = 0.7812, slope comparison F(2) = 0.7391, p = 0.4981). The IB cell potentiation between 3 and 10 days was more closely fit by a vertical shift as reflected in the significant change from the undeprived case in the y intercept but not the slope (Figures 3B and S3 10 days deprivation: intercept = 0.2130 ± 0.05, F(2) = 33.8214, p < 0.0001). These observations further emphasize that two different modes of plasticity are present in the RS and IB cells that operate at different time points in the sequence of depression and homeostatic rebound for the RS cells and depression and potentiation for the IB cells. The S1–6 vector for the RS cells shows a downshift followed by multiplicative decrease and multiplicative recovery, while the IB cells show a multiplicative decrease, followed by a multiplicative recovery and non-multiplicative potentiation. These data suggest that we should expect to find two different types of plasticity mechanism operating during sensory deprivation in layer 5 cells. One component of the changes in sensory responses in vivo is characteristic of homeostatic plasticity. Theoretically, several different mechanisms could underlie such homeostatic changes including changes in inhibition, changes in intrinsic membrane properties, or synaptic scaling of excitatory responses. We tested the last possibility, and as an initial test for the existence of synaptic scaling in RS and IB cells, we performed complete unilateral whisker trimming for 3 or 10 days duration and then prepared slices of contralateral barrel cortex in order to record mEPSCs. The complete deprivation leaves no input-driven changes, and instead highlights the intrinsic, input-independent global response of the recorded cells. In RS and IB cells, we found that mEPSC amplitudes were significantly depressed after 3 days of complete whisker trimming (Figure 4, comparing mEPSC amplitude day 3 and control, RS: p < 0.001, D = 0.556, IB: p < 0.01, D = 0.625, KS test). In common with the recovery of responses in vivo, mEPSC amplitudes recovered toward control values after day 10 complete whisker trimming, indicative of both cell types exhibiting homeostatic synaptic scaling (Figures 4A–4D). RS cells did not show multiplicative downscaling as the control, and 3-day distributions could not be scaled to each other, (Figure 4E; 3 day scaled is different from control, Scale factor = 0.668, D = 0.3889, p < 0.01, KS test), but they did show multiplicative upscaling from the depressed state between 3 and 10 days (10 day is not different from 3 day scaled, Scale factor = 1.145, D = 0.083, p = 0.98, KS test). IB cells showed both multiplicative downscaling between 0 and 3 days complete whisker trimming and rebound upscaling between 3 and 10 days (Figures 4F and 4H; 3 day scaled is not different from control, scale factor = 0.540, D = 0.2581, p = 0.253; 10 day is not different from 3 day scaled, scale factor = 1.206, D = 0.095, p = 0.98, KS test). Complete whisker trimming did not cause a change in inter-event interval in either cell type at any time point (Figures 4C and 4D, RS cells KW = 3.254, p = 0.1965, IB cells KW = 1.683, p = 0.4312, Kruskal-Wallis test). This experiment shows that multiplicative homeostatic scaling occurs in layer 5 of the barrel cortex. Upscaling from the depressed state can be described by a simple multiplicative gain change in synaptic weights for RS and IB cells, which is consistent with the homeostatic process we observe in vivo. However, the non-multiplicative downscaling only seen in the RS cells is consistent with the non-multiplicative downward shift seen between 0 and 12 hr in the RS cell spike responses (Figure 3A). To study the changes in mEPSCs under similar conditions to those used to induce plasticity in the in vivo experiments, we repeated the study but this time in mice deprived of a single row of whiskers. After 3 or 10 days deprivation, cortical slices were prepared and recordings made specifically from layer 5 cells in deprived (D-row) columns. RS cells showed depression of mEPSC amplitudes after 3 days (Figure 5A, RS = 5.10 ± 0.11 pA control versus 3.15 ± 0.04 pA 3 day, D = 0.694, p < 0.001, KS test) and significant recovery to a level near control after 10 days deprivation (4.56 ± 0.10 pA, D = 0.361, p = 0.018 versus 3 day, KS test). The mEPSC amplitude behavior therefore completely recapitulated the changes in spike firing seen in the studies in vivo (Figure S4). For IB cells, the mEPSC amplitude distribution did not show depression after 3 days of row deprivation (Figure 5B, IB = 5.17 ± 0.10 pA control versus 3 day 5.87 ± 0.08 pA, D = 0.35, p = 0.17, KS) but did show a strong increase in mEPSC amplitudes after 10 days (7.48 ± 0.16 pA, D = 0.500, p = 0.013, KS), again mimicking the spike firing changes in vivo. Deprivation did not cause a change in inter-event interval in either cell type at any time point (Figures 5C and 5D; RS cells KW = 5.086, p = 0.08, IB cells KW = 5.24, p = 0.07). We looked at whether the mEPSC amplitudes scaled in a multiplicative manner between any of the time points (Figures 5E–5H). We found that row deprivation resulted in changes in amplitude distribution that did not scale multiplicatively, neither the depression between control and 3 days of row deprivation (RS, D = 0.389, p = 0.008, KS) nor the potentiation between 3 and 10 days (RS, D = 0.15, p < 0.01, IB D = 0.16, p < 0.01, KS). These results show that row deprivation leads to more complex changes than removing all the whiskers evenly. This is perhaps inevitable, as all inputs are sampled in a mEPSP recording including inputs driven by spared and deprived whiskers, and we know from the recordings in vivo that only some of the plasticity transforms are common across inputs. Nevertheless, the time course of plasticity in the average mEPSC amplitudes and their direction of change at each time point mimicked the changes in sensory-evoked spike firing seen in vivo in an IB- and RS-cell-specific manner (Figure S4), implying that changes in excitatory responses were sufficient to explain the changes in receptive fields seen in vivo. Homeostatic plasticity occurs in visual cortex during the critical period (Kaneko et al., 2008Kaneko M. Stellwagen D. Malenka R.C. Stryker M.P. Tumor necrosis factor-alpha mediates one component of competitive, experience-dependent plasticity in developing visual cortex.Neuron. 2008; 58: 673-680Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar) and is characterized by a rebound of the response to a deprived input (closed eye) despite continued deprivation, analogous to the rebound of the response to the trimmed whisker input seen here. In the visual cortex, this form of homeostatic plasticity is due to synaptic scaling and depends on TNFα both in vitro (Stellwagen and Malenka, 2006Stellwagen D. Malenka R.C. Syna"

Amino acids are the basic supplements of mammalian cell culture feeds with known effect on their growth promotion and productivity. In this study, we reported the implementation of the Plackett-Burman (PB) multifactorial design to screen the effects of amino acids on the growth promotion and productivity of a Chinese hamster ovary DG-44 (CHO-DG44) cell line producing bevacizumab. After this screening, the amino acid combinations were optimized by the response surface methodology (RSM) to determine the most effective concentration in feeds. Through this strategy, the final monoclonal antibody (mAb) titre was enhanced by 70%, compared to the control group. For this particular cell line, aspartic acid, glutamic acid, arginine and glycine had the highest positive effects on the final mAb titre. Simultaneously, the impact of the designed amino acid feed on some critical quality attributes of bevacizumab was examined in the group with highest productivity. The product was analysed for N-glycan profiles, charge variant distribution, and low molecular weight forms. The results showed that the target product quality has been improved using this feeding strategy. It was shown how this strategy could significantly diminish the time and number of experiments in identifying the most effective amino acids and related concentrations in target product enhancement. This model could be successfully applied to other components of culture media and feeds."
https://openalex.org/W2130531619,"Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is a highly aggressive neoplasm characterized by a marked fibro-inflammatory microenvironment, the presence of which can promote both cancer induction and growth. Therefore, selective manipulation of local cytokines is an attractive, although unrealized, therapeutic approach. T cells possess a unique mechanism of p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) activation downstream of T cell receptor (TCR) engagement through the phosphorylation of Tyr323 (pY323). This alternative p38 activation pathway is required for pro-inflammatory cytokine production. Here we show in human PDAC that a high percentage of infiltrating pY323(+) T cells was associated with large numbers of tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α- and interleukin (IL)-17-producing CD4(+) tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) and aggressive disease. The growth of mouse pancreatic tumors was inhibited by genetic ablation of the alternative p38 pathway, and transfer of wild-type CD4(+) T cells, but not those lacking the alternative pathway, enhanced tumor growth in T cell-deficient mice. Notably, a plasma membrane-permeable peptide derived from GADD45-α, the naturally occurring inhibitor of p38 pY323(+) (ref. 7), reduced CD4(+) TIL production of TNF-α, IL-17A, IL-10 and secondary cytokines, halted growth of implanted tumors and inhibited progression of spontaneous KRAS-driven adenocarcinoma in mice. Thus, TCR-mediated activation of CD4(+) TILs results in alternative p38 activation and production of protumorigenic factors and can be targeted for therapeutic benefit."
https://openalex.org/W2260737152,"Scott syndrome is a rare bleeding disorder, characterized by altered Ca(2+)-dependent platelet signaling with defective phosphatidylserine (PS) exposure and microparticle formation, and is linked to mutations in the ANO6 gene, encoding anoctamin (Ano)6. We investigated how the complex platelet phenotype of this syndrome is linked to defective expression of Anos or other ion channels. Mice were generated with heterozygous of homozygous deficiency in Ano6, Ano1, or Ca(2+)-dependent KCa3.1 Gardos channel. Platelets from these mice were extensively analyzed on molecular functions and compared with platelets from a patient with Scott syndrome. Deficiency in Ano1 or Gardos channel did not reduce platelet responses compared with control mice (P > 0.1). In 2 mouse strains, deficiency in Ano6 resulted in reduced viability with increased bleeding time to 28.6 min (control 6.4 min, P < 0.05). Platelets from the surviving Ano6-deficient mice resembled platelets from patients with Scott syndrome in: 1) normal collagen-induced aggregate formation (P > 0.05) with reduced PS exposure (-65 to 90%); 2) lowered Ca(2+)-dependent swelling (-80%) and membrane blebbing (-90%); 3) reduced calpain-dependent protein cleavage (-60%); and 4) moderately affected apoptosis-dependent PS exposure. In conclusion, mouse deficiency of Ano6 but not of other channels affects viability and phenocopies the complex changes in platelets from hemostatically impaired patients with Scott syndrome."
https://openalex.org/W1860409309,"Organization of signaling complexes at excitatory synapses by membrane-associated guanylate kinase (MAGUK) proteins regulates synapse development, plasticity, senescence and disease. Post-translational modification of MAGUK family proteins can drive their membrane localization, yet it is unclear how these intracellular proteins are targeted to sites of synaptic contact. Here we show using super-resolution imaging, biochemical approaches and in vivo models that the trans-synaptic organizing protein ephrin-B3 controls the synaptic localization and stability of PSD-95 and links these events to changes in neuronal activity via negative regulation of a newly identified mitogen-associated protein kinase (MAPK)-dependent phosphorylation site on ephrin-B3, Ser332. Unphosphorylated ephrin-B3 was enriched at synapses, and interacted directly with and stabilized PSD-95 at synapses. Activity-induced phosphorylation of Ser332 dispersed ephrin-B3 from synapses, prevented the interaction with PSD-95 and enhanced the turnover of PSD-95. Thus, ephrin-B3 specifies the synaptic localization of PSD-95 and likely links the synaptic stability of PSD-95 to changes in neuronal activity."

An in vitro dual-chamber model to mimic the periodontal structure was developed using a monolayer of epithelial keratinocytes (OBA-9) and a subepithelial layer of fibroblasts (HGF-1). The invasive periodontopathogen A. actinomycetemcomitans (D7S-1) was applied to migrate through the cell layers and induce the synthesis of immune factors and cytokines in the host cells. In an attempt to analyze the antimicrobial properties of MSE and fractions, a susceptibility test was carried out. The extract (MIC 175 μg/mL, MBC 500μg/mL) and chloroform fraction (MIC 150 μg/mL, MBC 250 μg/mL) were found to have inhibitory activity. The extract and all fractions were assessed using a cytotoxicity test and results showed that concentrations under 100 μg/mL did not significantly reduce cell viability compared to the control group (p > 0.05, viability > 90%). In order to analyze the inflammatory response, transcriptional factors and cytokines were quantified in the supernatant released from the cells. The chloroform fraction was the most effective in reducing the bacterial colonization (p< 0.05) and controlling inflammatory mediators, and promoted the down-regulation of genes including IL-1beta, IL-6, IL-10, CD14, PTGS, MMP-1 and FOS as well as the reduction of the IL-1beta, IL-6, IL-8 and GM-CSF protein levels (p< 0.05). Malva sylvestris and its chloroform fraction minimized the A. actinomycetemcomitans infection and inflammation processes in oral human cells by a putative pathway that involves important cytokines and receptors. Therefore, this natural product may be considered as a successful dual anti-inflammatory–antimicrobial candidate."

Mitochondrial content and function are enhanced by endurance exercise and impaired in states or diseases where muscle function is compromised, such as myopathies, muscular dystrophies, neuromuscular diseases, and age-related muscle atrophy. Hence, elucidating the mechanisms that control muscle mitochondrial content and oxidative function can provide new insights into states and diseases that affect muscle health. In past studies, we identified Perm1 (PPARGC1- and ESRR-induced regulator, muscle 1) as a gene induced by endurance exercise in skeletal muscle, and regulating mitochondrial oxidative function in cultured myotubes. The capacity of Perm1 to regulate muscle mitochondrial content and function in vivo is not yet known. In this study, we use adeno-associated viral (AAV) vectors to increase Perm1 expression in skeletal muscles of 4-wk-old mice. Compared to control vector, AAV1-Perm1 leads to significant increases in mitochondrial content and oxidative capacity (by 40-80%). Moreover, AAV1-Perm1-transduced muscles show increased capillary density and resistance to fatigue (by 33 and 31%, respectively), without prominent changes in fiber-type composition. These findings suggest that Perm1 selectively regulates mitochondrial biogenesis and oxidative function, and implicate Perm1 in muscle adaptations that also occur in response to endurance exercise."

Integrin α5β1 is known to convey permissive signals enabling anchorage-dependent receptor tyrosine kinase signaling. However, the effects of integrin α5β1 on cell proliferation are controversial, and the molecular mechanisms involved in the regulation between integrin α5β1 and receptor tyrosine kinase remain largely unclear. Here we show that integrin α5 functions as a negative regulator of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) signaling through its N-glycosylation. Expression of WT integrin α5 suppresses the EGFR phosphorylation and internalization upon EGF stimulation. However, expression of the N-glycosylation mutant integrin α5, S3–5, which contains fewer N-glycans, reversed the suppression of the EGFR-mediated signaling and cell proliferation. In a mechanistic manner, WT but not S3–5 integrin α5 forms a complex with EGFR and glycolipids in the low density lipid rafts, and the complex formation is disrupted upon EGF stimulation, suggesting that the N-glycosylation of integrin α5 suppresses the EGFR activation through promotion of the integrin α5-glycolipids-EGFR complex formation. Furthermore, consistent restoration of those N-glycans on the Calf-1,2 domain of integrin α5 reinstated the inhibitory effects as well as the complex formation with EGFR.

In addition to glycosphingolipids, some glycoproteins that are located in the EGFR-related lipid rafts play important roles in the regulation of EGFR signaling (12Kariya Y. Gu J.

These limited results highlight the possibility that glycosylation might act as a “linker” in lipid rafts for the regulation of EGFR. However, little is known about how glycosylation controls regulation. Therefore, elucidation of the underlying mechanisms involved in the glycosylation-mediated regulation of EGFR is very important for a complete view of the biological functions of EGFR. Integrins are important members of the EGFR lipid raft-related glycoproteins, as mentioned above, and are major carriers of N-glycans, which are thought to play crucial roles in many biological functions. In response to cell adhesion, integrins not only directly initiate certain cytoplasmic signals for cell spreading but also indirectly modulate the transmission of EGFR signaling, which is referred to as cross-talk (24Yamada K.M.

Signal co-operation between integrins and other receptor systems.Biochem. J. 2009; 418: 491-506Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar). The integrins mediate cooperation with EGFR mainly through α-cytoplasmic domains (31Liu S. Calderwood D.A. Ginsberg M.H. Integrin cytoplasmic domain-binding proteins.J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 3563-3571Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), which are also restricted to the inner membrane. Until recently, integrin α5β1, a major fibronectin receptor, was believed to be a well characterized integrin, with N-glycosylation functions in cell adhesion (32Isaji T. Sato Y. Fukuda T. Gu J. N-Glycosylation of the I-like domain of β1 integrin is essential for beta1 integrin expression and biological function: identification of the minimalN-glycosylation requirement for α5β1.J. Biol.

Chem. 2006; 281: 33258-33267Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). However, the function of N-glycosylation on cell proliferation and cellular signaling remains unclear. In fact, there have been several controversial reports about the regulation of EGFR-mediated signaling by integrin α5 (34Kuwada S.K. Kuang J. Li X. Integrin α5/β1 expression mediates HER-2 down-regulation in colon cancer cells.J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 19027-19035Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 35Kuwada S.K.

Cell. 2000; 11: 2485-2496Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). To resolve these issues, we have examined the relationship between integrin α5 and EGFR and found that the expression of integrin α5 negatively regulates EGFR-mediated cellular signaling and cell proliferation. We used N-glycosylation mutants of integrin α5 to clarify the roles of the N-glycosylation of α5 in EGFR-mediated signaling and cross-talk with EGFR and found that the regulation was strictly controlled via the N-glycans of integrin α5, particularly the N-glycans on the Calf-1,2 domain. Our results clearly demonstrate the importance of the N-glycans of integrin in the regulation of EGFR-mediated cellular signaling and provide new insights into the cross-talk between growth factor receptors and integrins. The experiments were performed using the following antibodies: mAbs against integrin α5 (catalog no. 610634), ERK1 (catalog no. 610031), and caveolin-1 (catalog no. 610407) obtained from BD Biosciences; mAb against human α5β1 (MAB1999) from Millipore; the supernatant of the hybridoma of hamster integrin β1 subunit (7E2) from the Developmental Studies Hybridoma Bank, University of Iowa; mouse polyclonal antibody to EGFR (sc-120) from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.; rabbit mAbs to EGFR (catalog no. 4267), phospho-EGFR (catalog no. 3777), phospho-ERK1/2 (catalog no. 4370), AKT (catalog no. 9272), and phospho-AKT (catalog no. 4060) from Cell Signaling Technology; and mAb against α-tubulin from Sigma. Alexa Fluor® 647 goat anti-mouse IgG was obtained from Invitrogen. The peroxidase-conjugated goat against mouse and rabbit IgG antibodies were obtained from Promega and Cell Signaling Technology, respectively. The methyl-β-cyclodextrin, biotin-conjugated cholera toxin B subunit, primaquine, MesNa, iodoacetamide, and fibronectin (FN) were from Sigma; EGF (AF-100) was from PeproTech; EGF-Alexa Fluor® 555 was from Invitrogen; the control mouse IgG1 was from TONBO biosciences; sulfo-NHS-SS-biotin was from Thermo Scientific; and TO-PRO-3 was from Molecular Probes. The agarose-conjugated anti-GFP antibody (RQ2) and the Streptavidin-conjugated agarose were obtained from Medical & Biological Laboratories Co. Ltd. (Nagoya, Japan) and Millipore, respectively. The 293T and HeLa cell lines were provided by the RIKEN cell bank (Japan). The phoenix and MDA-MB-231 cell lines were purchased from ATCC. The integrin α5 subunit-deficient CHO-K1 cell line (CHO-B2) and the U-251MG cell line were gifts from Dr. Rudolf Juliano (School of Medicine, University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, NC) (36Schreiner C.L. Bauer J.S. Danilov Y.N. Hussein S. Sczekan M.M. Juliano R.L. Isolation and characterization of Chinese hamster ovary cell variants deficient in the expression of fibronectin receptor.J.

The stable cell lines used in this study were established as mentioned below. All cell lines were maintained at 37 °C in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM), supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), under a humidified atmosphere containing 5% CO2, except for the virus production. The CRISPR/Cas9-based integrin α5-KO cells were established as described previously (37Ran F.A. Hsu P.D. Wright J. Agarwala V. Scott D.A. Zhang F. Genome engineering using the CRISPR-Cas9 system.Nat. Protoc. 2013; 8: 2281-2308Crossref PubMed Scopus (6409) Google Scholar). Briefly, the sgRNA-specifying oligonucleotide sequences spanning human integrin α5 exon 3 (5′-CACCGGGGCAACAGTTCGAGCCCA-3′ and 5′-AAACTGGGCTCGAACTGTTGCCCC-3′) were chosen from the human KO library sgRNAs (38Shalem O.

Genome-scale CRISPR-Cas9 knockout screening in human cells.Science. 2014; 343: 84-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (3101) Google Scholar). After annealing, the double-stranded guide oligonucleotides were cloned into the pSpCas9(BB)-2A-GFP (Addgene plasmid ID: 48138) vector. The expression vector was transfected into the indicated cell lines by electroporation according to the manufacturer's instructions. The GFP-positive cells were sorted by FACSAria II (BD Bioscience) after culture for 3 days. The integrin α5-positive but GFP-negative cells were then sorted three times during the following 2-week culture. The α5-KO cells were confirmed by flow cytometry and Western blot analyses as described below. The cDNA of human EGFR (a generous gift from Dr. Motoko Takahashi, Sapporo Medical University, Japan) was inserted into a cloning entry vector (pENTR1A, Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's protocol for the In-Fusion kit (Takara Bio) using the following primers: 5′-ATCCGGTACCGAATTCACCATGCGACCCTCCGG-3′ and 5′-TCTAGATATCTCGAGTGCTCCAATAAATTC-3′. The vectors of GFP and GFP-tagged integrin α5 with altered N-glycosylation sites (WT, S3–5, and Δ10–14) were previously established in our laboratory (33Isaji T. Sato Y. Zhao Y. Miyoshi E. Wada Y. Taniguchi N. Gu J. N-Glycosylation of the β-propeller domain of the integrin α5 subunit is essential for α5β1 heterodimerization, expression on the cell surface, and its biological function.J. Biol.

The S3–5,10–14 mutation vector was also constructed according to the in-fusion kit using the following primers: 5′-TACATTATCAGAGCAAGAGCCG-3′, 5′-ATCCAACTCCAGGCCCTTTGGG-3′, 5′-CAAAGGGCCTGGAGTTGGAT-3′, and 5′-GCTCTTGCTCTGATAATGTAGG-3′. The resultant cDNAs were sequenced to confirm the presence of the desired mutations. We used the GatewayTM cloning system kit (Invitrogen) to acquire all of the expression vectors. Briefly, the LR clonase enzyme (Invitrogen) was used to transfer the cDNAs of EGFR and integrin α5 from the entry vectors into pBABE-puro-Rfa (32Isaji T. Sato Y. Fukuda T. Gu J.

In brief, the pBABE-puro-Rfa-based retrovirus vectors and pLP/VSVG (Invitrogen) were transfected into Phoenix cells with Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen). The CSII-CMV-Rfa-based lentivirus vectors were cotransfected with pCAG-HIVgp and pCMV-VSV-G-RSV-Rev into 293T cells. After transfection for 48 h, the retrovirus and lentivirus supernatants were collected. The CHO-B2 cells were infected with the resultant viral supernatant containing 10 μg/ml Polybrene (Sigma) at 32 °C overnight and then selected in the presence of 2.0 mg/ml puromycin (Nacalai Tesque, Kyoto, Japan) for 7 days. The antibiotic-resistant positive colonies (CHO-B2/EGFR) were picked up as a control. In the case of integrin α5-KO cells expressing GFP, WT, or mutant integrin α5, the GFP-positive cells were sorted three times using FACSAria II after lentivirus infection for 72 h. The stable cell lines were used in subsequent studies. For WB, the indicated cells were washed with ice-cold PBS and then lysed in the cell lysate (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100) with protease and phosphatase inhibitors (Nacalai Tesque, Kyoto, Japan) for 30 min. After centrifugation at 1,000 × g for 10 min, the supernatant was collected, and protein concentrations were determined using a BCA protein assay kit (Pierce). The protein lysates were resolved by non-reducing SDS-PAGE for integrin α5 and β1 or reducing SDS-PAGE for other proteins. After electrophoresis, the proteins were transferred to a PVDF membrane (Millipore) and detected with the indicated primary and secondary antibodies using an Immobilon Western Chemiluminescent HRP Substrate (Millipore), according to the manufacturer's instructions. For immunoprecipitates, cells were lysed with detergent-free TBS buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl) by being passed through a 21-gauge needle as described previously (18Wang J. Yu R.K. Interaction of ganglioside GD3 with an EGF receptor sustains the self-renewal ability of mouse neural stem cellsin vitro.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2013; 110: 19137-19142Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were resuspended in the TBS with protease and phosphatase inhibitors and lysed by being passed through a 21-gauge needle 30 times. After centrifugation at 1,000 × g for 10 min, the supernatant was collected. The remaining pellet was again syringed 30 times. After centrifugation at 1,000 × g for 10 min, the second postnuclear supernatant was combined with the first, and protein concentrations were determined using a BCA protein assay kit. Equivalent amounts (600 μg) of the supernatants were immunoprecipitated with anti-GFP-agarose, anti-EGFR antibody, or cholera toxin B subunit-biotin and Streptavidin-conjugated agarose for 1 h at 4 °C with rotation, and then the immunoprecipitates were washed twice with lysis buffer and subjected to 6% SDS-PAGE. The growth of the indicated cells was estimated by determination of cell growth curves or colony formation assays. To assay the cell growth curves, the cells (3 × 104) were seeded in 6-cm dishes overnight and then serum-starved for either 24 or 48 h (for MDA-MB-231 cells). After starvation, the cells were supplied with DMEM containing 10% FBS with or without EGF (0.1 ng/ml), control IgG (10 μg/ml), or anti-EGFR-blocking Ab (10 μg/ml). The photographs of the same areas on the cultured dishes were taken at the indicated times (0, 24, 48, and 72 h), and the cell numbers were counted. Cell numbers were normalized to those at 0 h and statistically analyzed. To assay the colony formation, the control, GFP, WT, and S3–5 group cells (0.6 × 103) were seeded in the 6-cm dishes. Cells were incubated for 14 days to allow colony formation, cells were stained with 0.25% crystal violet for 15 min, and images were taken. Quantification of the colonies was obtained by measuring the OD595 after digesting the colonies in each dish with 1 ml of 10% acetic acid. The OD595 values from GFP, WT, and S3–5 were normalized to that of the control cells. Cell surface biotinylation was performed as described previously with minor modifications (33Isaji T. Sato Y. Zhao Y. Miyoshi E. Wada Y. Taniguchi N. Gu J. N-Glycosylation of the β-propeller domain of the integrin α5 subunit is essential for α5β1 heterodimerization, expression on the cell surface, and its biological function.J. Biol.

Briefly, cells were gently washed twice with PBS and then incubated with ice-cold PBS containing 0.2 mg/ml sulfo-NHS-SS-biotin for 1 h at 4 °C. After incubation, cells were washed three times with ice-cold PBS, and the cells were harvested and lysed in the lysis buffer. The biotinylated proteins were precipitated with Streptavidin-conjugated agarose and then detected by WB, as described above. Flow cytometric analysis was performed as described previously (32Isaji T. Sato Y. Fukuda T. Gu J.

Briefly, the indicated semiconfluent cells were detached from the 10-cm culture dishes using trypsin containing 1 mm EDTA and were subsequently stained with either the mouse IgG or primary mouse anti-α5β1 or anti-EGFR antibody for 1 h on ice, followed by incubation with Alexa Fluor® 647 goat anti-mouse IgG for 1 h. During the incubation, the cells were mixed gently every 10 min by flicking. After incubation, cells were washed three times with PBS and then analyzed using a FACSCalibur flow cytometer and Cell Quest Pro software (BD Biosciences). Preparation of detergent-free lipid raft fractions was preformed as described previously, with minor modifications (18Wang J. Yu R.K. Interaction of ganglioside GD3 with an EGF receptor sustains the self-renewal ability of mouse neural stem cellsin vitro.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2013; 110: 19137-19142Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Briefly, 150-mm dishes of the indicated CHO-B2 cells were washed twice with PBS and then lysed twice with a total of 1 ml (each time 0.5 ml) of detergent-free base buffer (20 mm Tris·HCl, 250 mm sucrose, pH 7.8, containing 1 mm CaCl2 and 1 mm MgCl2) with protease and phosphatase inhibitors by being passed through a 21-gauge needle as described above. After centrifugation at 1,000 × g for 10 min, the postnuclear supernatant (∼1 ml) was mixed with the same volume of the base buffer containing 50% (v/v) OptiPrep and then added to the bottom of a 5-ml ultracentrifuge tube. Subsequently, each 0.6 ml of 20, 15, 10, 5, and 0% of OptiPrep in the base buffer was sequentially overlaid to the ultracentrifuge tube. The gradient was centrifuged at 5.2 × 104 rpm for 18 h at 4 °C, using an ultracentrifuge (Hitachi himac CS100GX). A total of 12 fractions (0.4 ml for each) were carefully collected from top to bottom of the gradient and analyzed by WB, as described above. The cell-spreading assay was performed as described previously with minor modifications (33Isaji T. Sato Y. Zhao Y. Miyoshi E. Wada Y. Taniguchi N. Gu J.

The intracellular proteins MMACHC and MMADHC play important roles in processing and targeting the Cbl cofactor to its destination enzymes, and recent evidence suggests that they may interact while performing these essential trafficking functions. To better understand the molecular basis of this interaction, we have mapped the crucial protein regions required, indicate that Cbl is likely processed by MMACHC prior to interaction with MMADHC, and identify patient mutations on both proteins that interfere with complex formation, via different mechanisms. We further report the crystal structure of the MMADHC C-terminal region at 2.2 Å resolution, revealing a modified nitroreductase fold with surprising homology to MMACHC despite their poor sequence conservation. Because MMADHC demonstrates no known enzymatic activity, we propose it as the first protein known to repurpose the nitroreductase fold solely for protein-protein interaction. Using small angle x-ray scattering, we reveal the MMACHC-MMADHC complex as a 1:1 heterodimer and provide a structural model of this interaction, where the interaction region overlaps with the MMACHC-Cbl binding site. Together, our findings provide novel structural evidence and mechanistic insight into an essential biological process, whereby an intracellular “trafficking chaperone” highly specific for a trace element cofactor functions via protein-protein interaction, which is disrupted by inherited disease mutations.

Rosenblatt D.S. Inherited disorders of folate and cobalamin transport and metabolism.in: Valle D. Beaudet A.L. Vogelstein B. Kinzler K.W. Antonarakis S.E. Ballabio A. Gibson M. Mitchell G. The Online Metabolic and Molecular Bases of Inherited Disease. McGraw-Hill, New York2014Google Scholar). An intracellular pathway of at least seven human gene loci has evolved, encoding proteins responsible for the transport, processing and delivery of the appropriate Cbl form via a cytosol-targeted route to MS, and a mitochondrion-targeted route to MUT (2Froese D.S.

Mutations in any of the seven genes, depending on its relative position within the pathway, can result in three broad disease phenotypes collectively referred to as “intracellular Cbl disorders” (2Froese D.S.

They include (i) homocystinuria (HC) associated with reduced MeCbl production and MS deficiency (1Watkins D. Rosenblatt D.S.

Vitamin-responsive disorders: cobalamin, folate, biotin, vitamins B1 and E.Handb. Clin. Neurol. 2013; 113: 1799-1810Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). MMACHC and MMADHC are two proteins involved in the early Cbl processing steps that are shared by both mitochondrial and cytosolic targeting routes. MMACHC gene mutations are the most common cause of Cbl metabolic disorders, resulting in HC+MMA (8Lerner-Ellis J.P. Anastasio N. Liu J. Coelho D. Suormala T. Stucki M. Loewy A.D. Gurd S. Grundberg E.

A possible explanation for the heterogeneous MMADHC phenotypes is the presence of distinct functional domains at the MMADHC protein level, responsible for trafficking to either mitochondrial MUT (of AdoCbl) or cytosolic MS (of MeCbl), or both. This hypothesis is supported by analysis of metabolic phenotypes from known disease mutations (11Stucki M. Coelho D. Suormala T. Burda P. Fowler B. Baumgartner M.R. Molecular mechanisms leading to three different phenotypes in the cblD defect of intracellular cobalamin metabolism.Hum. Mol. Genet. 2012; 21: 1410-1418Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar) and alanine-scanning mutagenesis (12Jusufi J. Suormala T. Burda P. Fowler B. Froese D.S. Baumgartner M.R. Characterization of functional domains of thecblD (MMADHC) gene product.J. Inherit. Metab. Dis. 2014; 37: 841-849Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). These studies dissect the 296-amino acid (aa) human MMADHC polypeptide functionally into the N-terminal 115 aa that is required for the mitochondrial route but dispensable for cytosolic trafficking, the C-terminal 180 aa that contribute to both routes, and two regions therein (aa 197–226 and 246–259) that have greater influence on the cytosolic than the mitochondrial route. Current knowledge points to a role of MMADHC in regulating Cbl delivery at the branch point between the mitochondrial and cytoplasmic target enzymes, albeit via an incompletely understood mechanism. Furthermore, despite the MMADHC gene discovery seven years ago (10Coelho D. Suormala T. Stucki M. Lerner-Ellis J.P. Rosenblatt D.S. Newbold R.F. Baumgartner M.R. Fowler B. Gene identification for the cblD defect of vitamin B12 metabolism.N. Engl. J. Med. 2008; 358: 1454-1464Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar), few of the biochemical properties and functions of the MMADHC protein are known. Although previously postulated to contain Cbl and ATP binding motifs (10Coelho D. Suormala T. Stucki M. Lerner-Ellis J.P. Rosenblatt D.S. Newbold R.F. Baumgartner M.R. Fowler B. Gene identification for the cblD defect of vitamin B12 metabolism.N. Engl. J. Med. 2008; 358: 1454-1464Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar), MMADHC has been shown not to bind Cbl (13Deme J.C.

Further biochemical exploration has been hampered in part by a lack of structural knowledge or sequence homologues. The inability of MMADHC to bind Cbl has implicated protein-protein interaction as the means of its Cbl-targeting role. This is supported by recent evidence from phage display (13Deme J.C.

To evaluate the importance and molecular basis of the MMACHC-MMADHC interaction, we have defined a minimal MMACHC interaction module of MMADHC, and demonstrated that experimental and patient missense mutations disrupt this interaction. We have further determined the structure of this interaction module from mouse MMADHC to 2.2 Å resolution, and established the 1:1 stoichiometry of the MMACHC-MMADHC heterodimer using small angle x-ray scattering (SAXS). Finally, based on the combined findings, we propose the first structural model of the MMACHC-MMADHC interaction. DNA fragments encoding human (Homo sapiens, IMAGE clone: 3826071) and mouse (Mus musculus, IMAGE clone: 3493526) MMADHC, harboring different N- and C-terminal boundaries, were amplified and subcloned into pNIC28-Bsa4 vector (GenBankTM accession number EF198106) in-frame with a tobacco etch virus protease cleavable N-terminal His6 tag. Constructs of human HsMMACHC in pNIC28-Bsa4 vector were prepared previously (16Froese D.S. Krojer T. Wu X. Shrestha R. Kiyani W. von Delft F. Gravel R.A. Oppermann U. Yue W.W.

Cloning and site-directed mutagenesis primers are available upon request. Proteins were expressed in Escherichia coli BL21(DE3)R3 and purified by affinity (Ni-Sepharose; GE Healthcare) and size-exclusion (Superdex 200; GE Healthcare) chromatography. For crystallization, MMADHC proteins were further purified by ion exchange chromatography (Resource Q; GE Healthcare). Selenomethionine (SeMet)-derivatized proteins were expressed using SelenoMethionine Medium Complete (Molecular Dimensions) and purified as above. Purified SeMet-derivatized and native MmMMADHCΔ128 were concentrated to 15–20 mg/ml, and crystals were grown by sitting drop vapor diffusion at 4 °C. The mother liquor conditions are summarized in Table 1. Crystals were cryo-protected in mother liquor containing ethylene glycol (25% v/v) and flash-cooled in liquid nitrogen. X-ray diffraction data were collected at the Diamond Light Source beamline I04 and processed using XIA2. Selenium atoms were located using SHELXC/D (22Sheldrick G.M.

The final refined model consists of aa 132–157, 169–236, and 246–296 of MmMMADHC.

Open table in a new tab For SAXS, MMACHC and MMADHC were cleaved by tobacco etch virus protease to remove the N-terminal His6 tag, followed by reverse affinity purification. Purified proteins were then incubated separately or together with the appropriate ligands and further purified by size-exclusion chromatography. Concentrations of proteins used were 24 mg/ml (MMADHC), 18 mg/ml (MMACHC), and 17 mg/ml (complex). Scattering data were collected at the Diamond Light Source B21 beamline. Data collection was performed either in-line with size-exclusion chromatography (KW404 column, Shodex) or in batch mode where the peak fractions were collected and immediately subjected to SAXS by flowing sample through an in-vacuum quartz capillary of 1.6-mm diameter. Data were collected using a Pilatus 2M detector (DECTRIS, Baden, Switzerland) at a sample-detector distance of 3914 mm and a wavelength of λ = 1 Å. The range of momentum transfer of 0.1 < s < 5 nm−1 was covered (s = 4πsinθ/λ, where θ is the scattering angle). For the in-line mode, 1-s exposures were collected, whereas for batch samples, a comparison of eighteen 10-s exposures was performed. Radiation damage was checked for the batch mode by monitoring changes in radius of gyration in each frame, where no significant changes were observed. The data were radially averaged, and the scattering of the buffer was subtracted. The forward scattering I(0), radius of gyration Rg, pair distribution of the particle P(r), and maximum dimension Dmax were analyzed using Scatter (27Foerster S. Apostol L. Bras W.

Blue native-PAGE was performed with 25 μm protein (MMACHC and/or MMADHC) alone or in the presence of 50 μm cobalamin (MeCbl, AdoCbl, CNCbl) and/or 8 mm ligand (GSH, FMN, FAD), which was loaded onto the native-PAGE gel system, after preincubation in the dark at room temperature for 1 h, and then run following the manufacturer's instructions (Life Technologies). All blue native-PAGE experiments were performed at least twice independently. Analytical gel filtration (16Froese D.S. Krojer T. Wu X. Shrestha R. Kiyani W. von Delft F. Gravel R.A. Oppermann U.

For native mass spectrometry, 75 μl of sample containing ∼4 mg/ml MMADHC and MMACHC incubated in the presence of 0.5 mm MeCbl and 2 mm reduced GSH underwent four desalting steps using Micro Bio-Spin columns (Bio-Rad) that were pre-equilibrated with 50 mm ammonium acetate buffer (pH 6.5). Following desalting, samples were loaded into a 1.0-ml gas-tight positive displacement syringe (Hamilton) that was inserted into the syringe pump. Samples were then directly infused with a constant flow rate of 6 μl/min through a PEEK capillary tubing (inner diameter, 0.005 inches) into a Q-TOF 6530 mass spectrometer attached to a standard electrospray ionization source (Agilent Technologies). The mass spectrometer was operated in positive ion mode, using the 1-GHz detector mode with a scan range of 100–20,000 m/z and a fragmentor voltage of 430 V. Following data acquisition, results were evaluated by using the MassHunter Qualitative Analysis software (Agilent Technologies). To better understand the required regions, ligand dependence, and stoichiometry of their in vitro interactions, we generated a series of human (Hs) MMADHC and MMACHC truncation proteins by recombinant expression (Fig. 1A). Using blue native-PAGE (BN-PAGE) (Fig. 1B), full-length MMACHC (HsMMACHCFL) alone migrated as two bands (lane 1), consistent with its known monomeric and dimeric forms, whereas the dimeric band became more prominent in the presence of MeCbl and GSH (lane 2, white dot). The HsMMADHC proteins with various N-terminal truncations migrated as single bands (lanes 3–8) corresponding to their respective monomers, corroborating previous investigations (13Deme J.C. Miousse I.R. Plesa M. Kim J.C. Hancock M.A. Mah W. Rosenblatt D.S. Coulton J.W. Structural features of recombinant MMADHC isoforms and their interactions with MMACHC, proteins of mammalian vitamin B12 metabolism.Mol. Genet. Metab. 2012; 107: 352-362Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Complex formation, as judged by the appearance of an additional band in BN-PAGE as compared with single-protein controls, was observed when HsMMACHCFL preincubated with MeCbl and GSH was added to HsMMADHCΔ61 or HsMMADHCΔ123, or to a lesser extent, HsMMADHCΔ153 (lanes 9–11, white asterisk). However, no complex band was observed with N-terminal truncation of HsMMADHC beyond aa 154 (HsMMADHCΔ157, HsMMADHCΔ167, or HsMMADHCΔ172; lanes 12–14) under the same conditions. The HsMMADHC-HsMMACHC complex bands migrated at a position intermediate of the estimated monomeric and dimeric HsMMACHC bands, suggesting a possible 1:1 heterodimeric complex. HsMMACHCΔC, which lacks the C-terminal Pro-rich region (aa 236–282; Fig. 1A), was sufficient for complex formation with HsMMADHCΔ123 (Fig. 1C, lane 2). Size-exclusion chromatography using MmMMADHCΔ128 and HsMMACHCΔC proteins further confirmed the regions required for interaction and the 1:1 stoichiometry of the complex (Fig. 1D). Therefore, the MMADHC region C-terminal to aa 154 and the MMACHC region without the Pro-rich C terminus is sufficient for direct protein-protein interaction. Notably, the MMADHC C-terminal region is the most evolutionarily conserved section of the polypeptide from human to Caenorhabditis elegans (Fig. 1E), suggesting selected retention of this interaction module in evolution. In agreement with previous work (14Gherasim C. Hannibal L. Rajagopalan D. Jacobsen D.W. Banerjee R.

We observed either significantly weaker or no interaction between HsMMACHCFL and HsMMADHCΔ123 when GSH was replaced by other reducing factors (FMN, FAD, DTT) or when MeCbl was replaced by other Cbl forms (AdoCbl, CNCbl) (Fig. 1F), conditions known to result in much slower (>10-fold) or no R-group removal (30Kim J.

Rodent cardiomyocytes produce de novo ACh, which is critical in maintaining cardiac homeostasis. We report that this nonneuronal cholinergic system is also found in human cardiomyocytes, which expressed choline acetyltransferase (ChAT) and the vesicular acetylcholine transporter (VAChT). Furthermore, VAChT expression was increased 3- and 1.5-fold at the mRNA and protein level, respectively, in ventricular tissue from patients with heart failure, suggesting increased ACh secretion in disease. We used mice with genetic deletion of cardiomyocyte-specific VAChT or ChAT and mice overexpressing VAChT to test the functional significance of cholinergic signaling. Mice deficient for VAChT displayed an 8% decrease in fractional shortening and 13% decrease in ejection fraction compared with angiotensin II (Ang II)-treated control animals, suggesting enhanced ventricular dysfunction and pathologic remodeling in response to Ang II. Similar results were observed in ChAT-deficient mice. Conversely, no decline in ventricular function was observed in Ang II-treated VAChT overexpressors. Furthermore, the fibrotic area was significantly greater (P < 0.05) in Ang II-treated VAChT-deficient mice (3.61 ± 0.64%) compared with wild-type animals (2.24 ± 0.11 %). In contrast, VAChT overexpressing mice did not display an increase in collagen deposition. Our results provide new insight into cholinergic regulation of cardiac function, suggesting that a compensatory increase in cardiomyocyte VAChT levels may help offset cardiac remodeling in heart failure.—Roy, A., Dakroub, M., Tezini, G.

https://openalex.org/W2296384316,"Toll-like receptors (TLR) and the receptor for interleukin-1 (IL-1R) signaling play an important role in bacteria-mediated bone loss diseases including periodontitis, rheumatoid arthritis, and osteomyelitis. Recent studies have shown that TLR ligands inhibit the receptor activator of NF-κB ligand (RANKL)-induced osteoclast differentiation from un-committed osteoclast precursors, whereas IL-1 potentiates RANKL-induced osteoclast formation. However, IL-1R and TLR belong to the same IL-1R/TLR superfamily, and activate similar intracellular signaling pathways. Here, we investigate the molecular mechanisms underlying the distinct effects of IL-1 and Porphyromonas gingivalis lipopolysaccharide (LPS-PG) on RANKL-induced osteoclast formation. Our results show that LPS-PG and IL-1 differentially regulate RANKL-induced activation of osteoclast genes encoding Car2, Ctsk, MMP9, and TRAP, as well as expression of NFATc1, a master transcription factor of osteoclastogenesis. Regulation of osteoclast genes and NFATc1 by LPS-PG and IL-1 is dependent on MyD88, an important signaling adaptor for both TLR and IL-1R family members. Furthermore, LPS-PG and IL-1 differentially regulate RANKL-costimulatory receptor OSCAR (osteoclast-associated receptor) expression and Ca(2+) oscillations induced by RANKL. Moreover, LPS-PG completely abrogates RANKL-induced gene expression of B lymphocyte-induced maturation protein-1 (Blimp1), a global transcriptional repressor of anti-osteoclastogenic genes encoding Bcl6, IRF8, and MafB. However, IL-1 enhances RANKL-induced blimp1 gene expression but suppresses the gene expression of bcl6, irf8, and mafb. Our study reveals the involvement of multiple signaling molecules in the differential regulation of RANKL-induced osteoclastogenesis by TLR2 and IL-1 signaling. Understanding the signaling cross-talk among TLR, IL-1R, and RANK is critical for identifying therapeutic strategies to control bacteria-mediated bone loss."

The efficient replication capability of HIV-2/SIV in non-dividing cells is induced by a unique, virally encoded accessory protein, Vpx, which proteasomally degrades the host antiviral restriction factor, SAM domain- and HD domain-containing protein 1 (SAMHD1). SAMHD1 is a dNTPase and kinetically suppresses the reverse transcription step of HIV-1 in macrophages by hydrolyzing and depleting cellular dNTPs. In contrast, Vpx, which is encoded by HIV-2/SIV, kinetically accelerates reverse transcription by counteracting SAMHD1 and then elevating cellular dNTP concentration in non-dividing cells. Here, we conducted the pre-steady-state kinetic analysis of reverse transcriptases (RTs) from two Vpx non-coding and two Vpx coding lentiviruses. At all three sites of the template tested, the two RTs of the Vpx non-coding viruses (HIV-1) displayed higher kpol values than the RTs of the Vpx coding HIV-2/SIV, whereas there was no significant difference in the Kd values of these two groups of RTs. When we employed viral RNA templates that induce RT pausing by their secondary structures, the HIV-1 RTs showed more efficient DNA synthesis through pause sites than the HIV-2/SIV RTs, particularly at low dNTP concentrations found in macrophages. This kinetic study suggests that RTs of the Vpx non-coding HIV-1 may have evolved to execute a faster kpol step, which includes the conformational changes and incorporation chemistry, to counteract the limited dNTP concentration found in non-dividing cells and still promote efficient viral reverse transcription.

HIV Type 2 (HIV-2), and simian immunodeficiency viruses (SIV) replicate in both activated and dividing CD4+ T cells and terminally differentiated/non-dividing myeloid cells such as macrophages and microglia, whereas other retroviruses such as gammaretroviruses (i.e. murine leukemia virus (MuLV) and feline leukemia virus), alpharetroviruses (i.e. avian myeloblastosis virus), and spumavirus (i.e. foamy virus) replicate only in dividing cells (1Skasko M.

A key metabolic difference between dividing and non-dividing cells is the cellular deoxynucleotide triphosphate (dNTP) pool. Cellular dNTP biosynthesis is closely tied with the cell cycle; the expression of various enzymes involved in dNTP biosynthesis is specifically activated at G1/S and S phases to support chromosomal DNA replication, which consumes cellular dNTPs (3Bjursell G. Skoog L. Control of nucleotide pools in mammalian cells.Antibiot. Chemother. 1980; 28: 78-85Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 4Cohen A. Barankiewicz J. Lederman H.M. Gelfand E.W.

It is well established that cancer cells have higher dNTP concentrations than normal dividing cells due to cell cycle dysregulation (5Traut T.W. Physiological concentrations of purines and pyrimidines.Mol. Cell. Biochem. 1994; 140: 1-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (1295) Google Scholar, 6Jackson R.C. Lui M.S. Boritzki T.J. Morris H.P. Weber G. Purine and pyrimidine nucleotide patterns of normal, differentiating, and regenerating liver and of hepatomas in rats.Cancer Res. 1980; 40: 1286-1291PubMed Google Scholar). Also, it was postulated that non-dividing cells including macrophages have lower dNTP concentrations than dividing cells due to lack of cell cycling and chromosomal DNA replication. However, the actual dNTP concentration of human primary macrophages was not available due to sensitivity limitations of available dNTP assays until we developed a highly sensitive method to determine the dNTP concentration in human primary macrophages (7Diamond T.L.

Indeed, we reported that human primary monocyte-derived macrophages have 50–200 times lower dNTP concentrations (20–40 nm) than activated CD4+ T cells (2–4 μm) (7Diamond T.L. Roshal M.

Importantly, although HIV-1 replication and viral production are robust in activated CD4+ T cells, its replication in non-dividing macrophages is kinetically delayed (9Collin M. Gordon S.

HIV-1 entry and reverse transcription in macrophages.J. Leukoc. Biol. 1994; 56: 273-277Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Our studies demonstrate that the extremely low dNTP level found in macrophages mechanistically contributes to the delayed replication kinetics of HIV-1 in macrophages and non-dividing cells.

Unlike HIV-1, HIV-2 and many SIV strains replicate rapidly even in macrophages, and this efficient replication capability of HIV-2/SIV in macrophages is engineered by a virally encoded accessory protein, called viral protein X (Vpx) (11Yu X.F.

Two groups independently reported that Vpx induces the fast replication kinetics in non-dividing macrophages by proteasomally degrading a host myeloid specific anti-viral factor, SAM domain- and HD domain-containing protein 1 (SAMHD1) (13Hrecka K.

SAMHD1 is the dendritic- and myeloid-cell-specific HIV-1 restriction factor counteracted by Vpx.Nature. 2011; 474: 654-657Crossref PubMed Scopus (1125) Google Scholar). Later, SAMHD1 was reported to be a dNTPase that hydrolyzes dNTPs to deoxynucleosides and triphosphates (15Goldstone D.C. Ennis-Adeniran V. Hedden J.J. Groom H.C. Rice G.I. Christodoulou E.

HIV-1 restriction factor SAMHD1 is a deoxynucleoside triphosphate triphosphohydrolase.Nature. 2011; 480: 379-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (610) Google Scholar), and indeed, our study revealed that SAMHD1 restricts reverse transcription during HIV-1 replication in macrophages by depleting cellular dNTPs and that the Vpx-mediated SAMHD1 degradation enhances reverse transcription by elevating cellular dNTPs in non-dividing macrophages (16Lahouassa H. Daddacha W. Hofmann H. Ayinde D. Logue E.C. Dragin L. Bloch N. Maudet C. Bertrand M. Gramberg T. Pancino G. Priet S. Canard B. Laguette N. Benkirane M. Transy C. Landau N.R. Kim B.

Immunol. 2012; 13: 223-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (620) Google Scholar). This Vpx-mediated dNTP elevation also facilitates viral replication in other non-dividing cell types including dendritic cells (17St Gelais C. de Silva S. Amie S.M. Coleman C.M. Hoy H. Hollenbaugh J.A. Kim B. Wu L. SAMHD1 restricts HIV-1 infection in dendritic cells (DCs) by dNTP depletion, but its expression in DCs and primary CD4+ T-lymphocytes cannot be upregulated by interferons.Retrovirology. 2012; 9: 105Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar) and resting CD4+ T cells (18Baldauf H.M. Pan X. Erikson E. Schmidt S. Daddacha W. Burggraf M. Schenkova K. Ambiel I. Wabnitz G. Gramberg T. Panitz S. Flory E. Landau N.R. Sertel S. Rutsch F. Lasitschka F. Kim B. König R. Fackler O.T. Keppler O.T. SAMHD1 restricts HIV-1 infection in resting CD4+ T cells.Nat. Med. 2012; 18: 1682-1687Crossref PubMed Scopus (452) Google Scholar). Basically, Vpx coding HIV-2/SIV replicate in an abundant dNTP condition even in non-dividing cells by counteracting SAMHD1, whereas Vpx non-coding lentiviruses (HIV-1) always replicate under limited dNTP availability in non-dividing cells. This difference contributes to the delayed replication kinetics exhibited by HIV-1 in macrophages and other non-dividing target cells. We previously reported that HIV-1 RT very efficiently synthesizes DNA especially at low dNTP concentrations, as compared with MuLV RT. Furthermore, the pre-steady-state kinetic data demonstrated that HIV-1 RT has a tighter dNTP binding affinity (Kd) than MuLV RT (1Skasko M. Weiss K.K. Reynolds H.M. Jamburuthugoda V. Lee K. Kim B. Mechanistic differences in RNA-dependent DNA polymerization and fidelity between murine leukemia virus and HIV-1 reverse transcriptases.J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 12190-12200Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). We suggested that the tight dNTP binding affinity of HIV-1 RT promotes synthesis of its proviral DNA in macrophages, which have a low dNTP concentration. Conversely, MuLV RT may not require tight dNTP binding nor DNA synthesis at low dNTP concentrations because MuLV does not infect non-dividing cells such as macrophages. This study suggests that the enzyme kinetics of the RT contribute to the cell tropism (dividing versus non-dividing cells) of retroviruses. This idea was further supported by our finding that RT of a SIV clone that preferentially replicates in activated CD4+ T cells where dNTP concentrations are high showed a reduced dNTP binding affinity, which results from a mutation (V148I), as compared with a parental virus that preferentially infects macrophages (19Diamond T.L. Souroullas G. Weiss K.K. Lee K.Y. Bambara R.A. Dewhurst S. Kim B. Mechanistic understanding of an altered fidelity simian immunodeficiency virus reverse transcriptase mutation, V148I, identified in a pig-tailed macaque.J. Biol.

Chem. 2001; 276: 23624-23631Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Based on the findings that SAMHD1 mediates the dNTP depletion of macrophages, we reasoned that Vpx coding HIV-2/SIV replicate under increased dNTP conditions even in non-dividing cells by counteracting SAMHD1. In contrast, Vpx non-coding lentiviruses (HIV-1) must replicate under limited dNTP availability in non-dividing cells, which contributes to the delayed HIV-1 replication kinetics in the non-dividing viral target cell types. Indeed, our study on the dNTP utilization efficiency of 7 different HIV-1 RTs (Vpx non-coding) and 11 different HIV-2/SIV (Vpx coding) RTs revealed that the Vpx non-coding viral RTs tested showed more efficient DNA synthesis at low dNTP concentrations, as compared with the Vpx coding HIV-2/SIV RTs (21Lenzi G.M.

Kinetic variations between reverse transcriptases of viral protein X coding and noncoding lentiviruses.Retrovirology. 2014; 11: 111Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar), which supports the idea that Vpx and SAMHD1 can influence RT enzyme kinetics. Here we investigated the mechanistic differences between these two groups of RT enzymes using pre-steady-state kinetic analysis, which can separately determine the dNTP binding affinity (Kd) and the following conformational change/incorporation chemistry step (kpol step). We observed that HIV-1 RT enzymes have a faster kpol step, but similar dNTP binding affinity, as compared with the RTs tested from Vpx coding HIV-2/SIV.

The purity of the RT enzymes was typically greater than 95% as determined from SDS-PAGE. RT enzymes were flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at −80 °C until use.

Briefly, a template/primer (T/P) was prepared by annealing a 5′ 32P-labeled 17-mer DNA primer (5′-CGCGCCGAATTCCCGCT-3′, Integrated DNA Technologies) to a 2.5-fold excess of 40-mer template RNA (5′-AAGCUUGGCUGCAGAAUAUUGCUAGCGGGAAUUCGGCGCG-3′, Integrated DNA Technologies). Assay mixtures (20 μl) contained 10 nm T/P, RT, and dNTP at the concentrations specified in each figure legend. Reaction mixtures were incubated at 37 °C for 5 min and then terminated for analysis. This reaction condition allows multiple rounds of primer extension, and all measured enzyme activity was normalized for 50% extension at the highest dNTP concentration. Products were resolved using 14% polyacrylamide/8 m urea gels and visualized using a PharosFX (Bio-Rad). Pre-steady-state burst experiments were performed using an RQF-3 rapid quench-flow apparatus (KinTek Corp.) to determine the active concentration of the purified RT enzymes. The T/P was prepared as above and consisted of a 48-mer DNA template (5′-CGAGCTAAGCGCTTGACCGCAGAACATTGCTAGCGGGAATTCGGCGCG-3′) and a 21-mer primer (5′-CGCGCCGAATTCCCGCTAGCA-3′, template:primer ratio of 2.5:1). In this experiment, 300 μm dATP and 10 mm MgCl2 were rapidly mixed with RT (100 nm total protein) prebound to T/P (300 nm). All concentrations represent the final concentrations after mixing. The reactions were quenched at various time points with 0.3 m (final) EDTA. Products were then separated on a 20% polyacrylamide/8 m urea gel, visualized using a PharosFX (Bio-Rad), and quantified with Molecular Imager FX software (Bio-Rad).

The primer extension assays were performed similarly as described above, but using in vitro transcribed viral RNA (TAR and shortened pol gene) as RNA templates. 32P-labeled 20-mer DNA primers (5′-ACAGACGGGCACACACTACT-3′ and 5′-GACGCATGTGACTGATATCC-3′ for TAR and Pol RNA templates, respectively) were annealed onto these RNA templates to form each T/P pair. Assays were carried out as described above except enzyme activity was normalized by using the same active concentration (200 nm). Because Vpx non-coding and coding lentiviruses are both able to replicate in macrophages with significant dNTP availability differences, we tested whether RTs from Vpx coding and non-coding lentiviruses display different concentration-dependent activity profiles. To test this, we cloned, overexpressed, and purified homodimeric p66 RTs from two HIV-1 strains of different subtypes (A and D: Vpx non-coding), HIV-2 Rod, and SIVagm 9063-2 (Vpx coding). First we examined the effect of dNTP concentration on the RNA-dependent DNA polymerization activity of these purified RT proteins using a 40-mer RNA template (T) annealed to a 5′ 32P-labeled 17-mer DNA primer (P, Fig. 1A) and varying dNTP concentrations observed in activated/dividing CD4+ T cells (1 μm, T in Fig. 1B), non-dividing macrophages (50 nm, M), and non-dividing macrophages with Vpx (500 nm, X). We initially determined the amount of the RT enzymes showing ∼50% primer extension at 1 μm dNTPs (T: T cell concentration) as calculated by the ratio of unextended primer (P) to fully extended primer (F) in a 5-min incubation at 37 °C. Then, the same reactions were repeated with decreasing concentrations of dNTPs down to 50 nm (M). As shown (Fig. 1B), the two HIV-1 RTs were able to generate the full-length product (see arrow), even at low dNTP concentrations found in macrophages, and this is consistent with our previous observations for other HIV-1 RT variants (21Lenzi G.M.

Kinetic variations between reverse transcriptases of viral protein X coding and noncoding lentiviruses.Retrovirology. 2014; 11: 111Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). The HIV-2 and SIV RTs also efficiently fully extended the primer in both T cell dNTP concentration and the dNTP concentration found in macrophages treated with Vpx (X, 500 nm (16Lahouassa H. Daddacha W. Hofmann H. Ayinde D. Logue E.C. Dragin L. Bloch N. Maudet C. Bertrand M. Gramberg T. Pancino G. Priet S. Canard B. Laguette N. Benkirane M. Transy C. Landau N.R. Kim B.

However, the HIV-2 and SIV RTs tested generated 5–10 times less fully extended product at low dNTP concentrations found in macrophages (M) as compared with HIV-1 RTs. Pausing (see Sites 2 and 3, * in Fig. 1, A and B) is generated by the kinetic delay of dNTP incorporation and is more significant in the HIV-2 and SIV RT proteins as compared with the HIV-1 RT enzymes (unpaired Student's t test between RTs from Vpx non-coding and coding viruses, p < 0.05). This initial analysis shown in Fig. 1 suggests that RTs from these two groups of lentiviruses (Vpx non-coding and coding) have different DNA polymerase activity profiles, especially at low dNTP concentrations found in non-dividing macrophages. To understand the mechanistic discrepancy in the DNA synthesis kinetics between the RTs from Vpx non-coding and coding lentiviruses, we sought to determine the dNTP binding affinity (Kd) and incorporation rate (kpol) for each RT enzyme. To determine the active enzyme concentration of the four RT proteins, we first used pre-steady-state burst experiments (molar excess of T/P) with the T/P that does not induce RT pausing (see “Experimental Procedures”). We observed typical burst kinetics for all four RTs (Fig. 2A) followed by the slow steady-state rate, giving a ratio of active protein ranging from 50 to 75%. This indicates that the mechanistic pathway was not changed for the enzymes tested and that a slow step following the chemistry is limiting the overall reaction pathway. Using all four enzymes normalized for active concentration, we employed single turnover experiments to determine each enzyme's binding affinity (Kd) and incorporation rate (kpol) at Site 1 of the T/P used in Fig. 1. We used concentrations of dNTPs ranging from 1 to 100 μm and determined the rate of single nucleotide incorporation at each concentration. Those rates were plotted against the dNTP concentration to determine both the maximum rate of incorporation and dNTP binding affinity. Fig. 2B displays the binding curves for Site 1 for the four enzymes. As evident from the graph, the Vpx non-coding HIV-1 RTs plateau at a higher rate of incorporation as compared with the Vpx coding HIV-2 Rod and SIV 9063-2. However the dNTP binding affinities for all four enzymes at Site 1 are not statistically different (Table 1). These data from Site 1 suggest that the RTs from HIV-1 may have higher rates of dNTP incorporation but similar dNTP binding affinities to RTs from Vpx coding SIV and HIV-2 lentiviruses.TABLE 1kpol, Kd, kpol/Kd values of Vpx non-coding and Vpx coding RTs at three different sites on the 40-mer RNA templateSiteRTskpolKdkpol/Kds−1μms−1 μm−1*1 (No pause)Vpx non-coding (HIV-1 Cy, HIV-1 Ug)79 ± 15 (3.0×)*29 ± 5.4 (0.7×) NS2.7 ± 0.34 (3.6×)**Vpx coding (HIV-2 Rod, SIV 9063–2)27 ± 3.239 ± 8.40.76 ± 0.15*2 (Unique pause)Vpx non-coding (HIV-1 Cy, HIV-1 Ug)290 ± 31 (4.1×)***71 ± 11 (1.4×) NS4.1 ± 0.26 (3.2×)***Vpx coding (HIV-2 Rod, SIV 9063–2)69 ± 1751 ± 7.81.3 ± 0.19*3 (Conserved pause)Vpx non-codi"

In this study, we investigated the intracellular substrate accumulation by motif variants with all possible combinations of glutamate residues changed to glutamine and arginine changed to a tyrosine, the latter being a natural variant found in the Escherichia coli POT YjdL. We found that YjdL motif variants with E1XXE2R, E1XXE2Y, E1XXQ2Y, or Q1XXE2Y were able to accumulate peptide, whereas those with E1XXQ2R, Q1XXE2R, or Q1XXQ2Y were unable to accumulate peptide, and Q1XXQ2R abolished uptake. These results suggest a mechanism that involves swapping of an intramotif salt bridge, i.e. R-E2 to R-E1, which is consistent with previous structural studies. Molecular dynamics simulations of the motif variants E1XXE2R and E1XXQ2R support this mechanism. The simulations showed that upon changing conformation arginine pushes Helix V, through interactions with the highly conserved FYING motif, further away from the central cavity in what could be a stabilization of an inward facing conformation.

https://openalex.org/W2180157285,"Twin-arginine translocation (Tat) systems mediate the transmembrane translocation of completely folded proteins that possess a conserved twin-arginine (RR) motif in their signal sequences. Many Tat systems consist of three essential membrane components named TatA, TatB, and TatC. It is not understood why some bacteria, in addition, constitutively express a functional paralog of TatA called TatE. Here we show, in live Escherichia coli cells, that, upon expression of a Tat substrate protein, fluorescently labeled TatE-GFP relocates from a rather uniform distribution in the plasma membrane into a number of discrete clusters. Clustering strictly required an intact RR signal peptide and the presence of the TatABC subunits, suggesting that TatE-GFP associates with functional Tat translocases. In support of this notion, site-specific photo cross-linking revealed interactions of TatE with TatA, TatB, and TatC. The same approach also disclosed a pronounced tendency of TatE and TatA to hetero-oligomerize. Under in vitro conditions, we found that TatE replaces TatA inefficiently. Our collective results are consistent with TatE being a regular constituent of the Tat translocase in E. coli."
https://openalex.org/W1816275380,"Bone minerals are acquired during growth and are key determinants of adult skeletal health. During puberty, the serum levels of growth hormone (GH) and its downstream effector IGF-1 increase and play critical roles in bone acquisition. The goal of the current study was to determine how bone cells integrate signals from the GH/IGF-1 to enhance skeletal mineralization and strength during pubertal growth. Osteocytes, the most abundant bone cells, were shown to orchestrate bone modeling during growth. We used dentin matrix protein (Dmp)-1-mediated Ghr knockout (DMP-GHRKO) mice to address the role of the GH/IGF axis in osteocytes. We found that DMP-GHRKO did not affect linear growth but compromised overall bone accrual. DMP-GHRKO mice exhibited reduced serum inorganic phosphate and parathyroid hormone (PTH) levels and decreased bone formation indices and were associated with an impaired response to intermittent PTH treatment. Using an osteocyte-like cell line along with in vivo studies, we found that PTH sensitized the response of bone to GH by increasing Janus kinase-2 and IGF-1R protein levels. We concluded that endogenously secreted PTH and GHR signaling in bone are necessary to establish radial bone growth and optimize mineral acquisition during growth."
https://openalex.org/W1818062558,"Genome-wide association studies aim to correlate genotype with phenotype. Many common diseases including Type II diabetes, Alzheimer’s, Parkinson’s and Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) are complex genetic traits with hundreds of different loci that are associated with varied disease risk. Identifying common features in the genes associated with each disease remains a challenge. Furthermore, the role of post-transcriptional regulation, and in particular alternative splicing, is still poorly understood in most multigenic diseases. We therefore compiled comprehensive lists of genes associated with Type II diabetes, Alzheimer’s, Parkinson’s and COPD in an attempt to identify common features of their corresponding mRNA transcripts within each gene set. The SERPINA1 gene is a well-recognized genetic risk factor of COPD and it produces 11 transcript variants, which is exceptional for a human gene. This led us to hypothesize that other genes associated with COPD, and complex disorders in general, are highly transcriptionally diverse. We found that COPD-associated genes have a statistically significant enrichment in transcript complexity stemming from a disproportionately high level of alternative splicing, however, Type II Diabetes, Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s disease genes were not significantly enriched. We also identified a subset of transcriptionally complex COPD-associated genes (~40%) that are differentially expressed between mild, moderate and severe COPD. Although the genes associated with other lung diseases are not extensively documented, we found preliminary data that idiopathic pulmonary disease genes, but not cystic fibrosis modulators, are also more transcriptionally complex. Interestingly, complex COPD transcripts are more often the product of alternative acceptor site usage. To verify the biological importance of these alternative transcripts, we used RNA-sequencing analyses to determine that COPD-associated genes are frequently expressed in lung and liver tissues and are regulated in a tissue-specific manner. Additionally, many complex COPD-associated genes are spliced differently between COPD and non-COPD patients. Our analysis therefore suggests that post-transcriptional regulation, particularly alternative splicing, is an important feature specific to COPD disease etiology that warrants further investigation."
https://openalex.org/W1792497498,"Background Mesenchymal stem/stromal cells have unique properties favorable to their use in clinical practice and have been studied for cardiac repair. However, these cells are larger than coronary microvessels and there is controversy about the risk of embolization and microinfarctions, which could jeopardize the safety and efficacy of intracoronary route for their delivery. The index of microcirculatory resistance (IMR) is an invasive method for quantitatively assessing the coronary microcirculation status. Objectives To examine heart microcirculation after intracoronary injection of mesenchymal stem/stromal cells with the index of microcirculatory resistance. Methods Healthy swine were randomized to receive by intracoronary route either 30x106 MSC or the same solution with no cells (1% human albumin/PBS) (placebo). Blinded operators took coronary pressure and flow measurements, prior to intracoronary infusion and at 5 and 30 minutes post-delivery. Coronary flow reserve (CFR) and the IMR were compared between groups. Results CFR and IMR were done with a variance within the 3 transit time measurements of 6% at rest and 11% at maximal hyperemia. After intracoronary infusion there were no significant differences in CFR. The IMR was significantly higher in MSC-injected animals (at 30 minutes, 14.2U vs. 8.8U, p = 0.02) and intragroup analysis showed a significant increase of 112% from baseline to 30 minutes after cell infusion, although no electrocardiographic changes or clinical deterioration were noted. Conclusion Overall, this study provides definitive evidence of microcirculatory disruption upon intracoronary administration of mesenchymal stem/stromal cells, in a large animal model closely resembling human cardiac physiology, function and anatomy."
https://openalex.org/W1783946558,"Methamphetamine is a widely abused, highly addictive drug. Regulation of synaptic proteins within the brain’s reward pathway modulates addiction behaviours, the progression of drug addiction and long-term changes in brain structure and function that result from drug use. Therefore, using large scale proteomics studies we aim to identify global protein expression changes within the dorsal striatum, a key brain region involved in the modulation of addiction. We performed LC-MS/MS analyses on rat striatal synaptosomes following 30 days of methamphetamine self-administration (2 hours/day) and 14 days abstinence. We identified a total of 84 differentially-expressed proteins with known roles in neuroprotection, neuroplasticity, cell cytoskeleton, energy regulation and synaptic vesicles. We identify significant expression changes in stress-induced phosphoprotein and tubulin polymerisation-promoting protein, which have not previously been associated with addiction. In addition, we confirm the role of amphiphysin and phosphatidylethanolamine binding protein in addiction. This approach has provided new insight into the effects of methamphetamine self-administration on synaptic protein expression in a key brain region associated with addiction, showing a large set of differentially-expressed proteins that persist into abstinence.

A non-invasive clinical examination was used to estimate the prevalence of TDIs, and an interviewer-administered questionnaire was used to gather relevant behavioural and socio-demographic data. Multiple logistic regression models were used to assess the association between area based socioeconomic position and TDIs.The overall prevalence of TDIs was 10.9%. Social inequalities in the prevalence of TDIs were observed across the adolescent population according to their area of residence. Socio-economic group differences in the prevalence of TDIs remained statistically significant after adjusting for demographic factors, material resources, social capital, social support and health affecting behaviours (OR 3.36, 95% CI 1.75-6.46 and OR 3.99, 95% CI 1.86-8.56 for adolescents from resettlement areas and urban slums respectively in comparison to middle class adolescents). Different psychosocial, material and socio-demographic variables did not attenuate the estimates for the relationship between area socioeconomic position and TDIs.Area of residence was a strong predictor of TDIs in adolescents with a higher prevalence in more deprived areas. Social inequalities in TDIs were not explained by psychosocial and behavioural variables. Health promoting policies aimed at improving the physical environment in which adolescents reside might be instrumental in reducing the prevalence of TDIs and associated inequalities."
https://openalex.org/W1803773623,"Glutamatergic synapses are the most prevalent functional elements of information processing in the brain. Changes in pre-synaptic activity and in the function of various post-synaptic elements contribute to generate a large variety of synaptic responses. Previous studies have explored postsynaptic factors responsible for regulating synaptic strength variations, but have given far less importance to synaptic geometry, and more specifically to the subcellular distribution of ionotropic receptors. We analyzed the functional effects resulting from changing the subsynaptic localization of ionotropic receptors by using a hippocampal synaptic computational framework. The present study was performed using the EONS (Elementary Objects of the Nervous System) synaptic modeling platform, which was specifically developed to explore the roles of subsynaptic elements as well as their interactions, and that of synaptic geometry. More specifically, we determined the effects of changing the localization of ionotropic receptors relative to the presynaptic glutamate release site, on synaptic efficacy and its variations following single pulse and paired-pulse stimulation protocols. The results indicate that changes in synaptic geometry do have consequences on synaptic efficacy and its dynamics."
https://openalex.org/W1812628688,"Network graphs have become a popular tool to represent complex systems composed of many interacting subunits; especially in neuroscience, network graphs are increasingly used to represent and analyze functional interactions between multiple neural sources. Interactions are often reconstructed using pairwise bivariate analyses, overlooking the multivariate nature of interactions: it is neglected that investigating the effect of one source on a target necessitates to take all other sources as potential nuisance variables into account; also combinations of sources may act jointly on a given target. Bivariate analyses produce networks that may contain spurious interactions, which reduce the interpretability of the network and its graph metrics. A truly multivariate reconstruction, however, is computationally intractable because of the combinatorial explosion in the number of potential interactions. Thus, we have to resort to approximative methods to handle the intractability of multivariate interaction reconstruction, and thereby enable the use of networks in neuroscience. Here, we suggest such an approximative approach in the form of an algorithm that extends fast bivariate interaction reconstruction by identifying potentially spurious interactions post-hoc: the algorithm uses interaction delays reconstructed for directed bivariate interactions to tag potentially spurious edges on the basis of their timing signatures in the context of the surrounding network. Such tagged interactions may then be pruned, which produces a statistically conservative network approximation that is guaranteed to contain non-spurious interactions only. We describe the algorithm and present a reference implementation in MATLAB to test the algorithm’s performance on simulated networks as well as networks derived from magnetoencephalographic data. We discuss the algorithm in relation to other approximative multivariate methods and highlight suitable application scenarios. Our approach is a tractable and data-efficient way of reconstructing approximative networks of multivariate interactions. It is preferable if available data are limited or if fully multivariate approaches are computationally infeasible."

The light-driven proton pumps feature a seven-transmembrane α-helical region with a lysine-bound retinal that serves as a chromophore responsive to light.

However, BR proteins have a well established and significant property, a red-shifted activity spectrum at acidic pH, wherein a maximum red-shift of ∼55 nm in λmax for HsBR is from protonation of an aspartate residue at the retinal Schiff base (Asp85 in HsBR) (16Váró G.

Proton transfers in the bacteriorhodopsin photocycle.Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2006; 1757: 1012-1018Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). At acidic pH, the lack of proton transport is due to the protonated aspartate, which should be the proton acceptor for the Schiff base during the photocycle; in the absence of an acceptor, the proton transfer cannot take place, and a critical step in the transport does not occur. Those results are expected because releasing a proton from a protein into an environment of low pH is not chemically favored, and a red-shifted action spectrum is a conventional indicator for the protonated aspartate in the Schiff base binding pocket. Most BR proteins are not functional under acidic conditions. After we reported a BR from Haloarcula marismortui, HmBRII, BR proteins started to surface in the past few years.

However, none of them has a relatively consistent activity spectrum in broad pH conditions. Here, we report the atomic structure, sequence analysis, and photochemical properties of a BR protein, HwBR, and we propose that HwBR belongs to a new subfamily of BRs that we have named qR. The crystal structures of HwBR revealed that a unique arginine residue stabilizes the extracellular loop region by forming hydrogen bonds with a threonine residue located in the membrane edge of extracellular region. The importance of this local structure, which shields the interior environment of HwBR from the low pH extracellular area, was further validated by the mutagenesis approach. Thirteen BR-like amino acid sequences were used for phylogenomic analysis 7Throughout this manuscript, the nomenclatures of aR, bR, cR, dR, and qR are used different bacteriorhodopsin subfamilies, and BR is used for the abbreviation of bacteriorhodopsin protein itself. . The unweighted pair group method with arithmetic mean (UPGMA) algorithm was employed in this work, with the Kimura protein distance measure from CLC sequence Viewer 6.9. The bootstrap is based on 100 replicates.

Sequence information for the other rhodopsins was obtained from GenBank and the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) database. Routine DNA manipulations were carried out according to standard molecular cloning procedures. The HwBR gene was cloned into a pUC57 vector using directed synthesis. The final sequence was CC1ATGgCTXXXX753GACCTCGAG (underlining indicates the restriction sites for NcoI and XhoI, respectively, and g indicates a modified base.) The DNA fragments were obtained by NcoI and XhoI and were then inserted into the NcoI and XhoI sites of the pET-21d vector (Novagen). Consequently, a plasmid encoding hexahistidines at the C terminus was constructed. HwBR gene mutants were generated using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis method (Stratagene). The constructed plasmids were confirmed to have the expected nucleotide sequence using an automated sequencer. HwBR protein with hexahistidines at the C terminus was expressed in E. coli C43(DE3). The protein was purified using nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid resin chromatography (GE Healthcare) as described previously (35Fu H.Y. Lin Y.C. Chang Y.N. Tseng H. Huang C.C. Liu K.C. Huang C.S. Su C.W.

The purified sample was concentrated and exchanged to a buffer containing 4 m NaCl, 50 mm Tris-HCl, and 0.05% DDM using an Amicon apparatus (Millipore). UV-visible spectra were recorded using a U-1900 spectrophotometer (Hitachi). pH-dependent spectra and a titration curve were conducted as described in previous research (36Balashov S.P.

The temperature was maintained at 298 K. The electrochemical cell was designed by Chu et al. (37Chu L.K. Yen C.W. El-Sayed M.A. Bacteriorhodopsin-based photo-electrochemical cell.Biosens. Bioelectron. 2010; 26: 620-626Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar) and modified in our previous work (19Fu H.Y. Yi H.P. Lu Y.H. Yang C.S.

Microbiol. 2013; 88: 551-561Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). Photocurrent measurements of purified proteins were carried out by using a modulated continuous wave (CW) 532-nm green laser as the excitation light source and controlled by a data acquisition card. Light-driven proton transport activity was measured by monitoring light-induced pH changes using a glass electrode in real time. E. coli cells expressing the target rhodopsin were harvested by centrifugation (4,800 × g for 10 min). They were then washed three times and resuspended in measurement buffer (10 mm NaCl, 10 mm MgSO4, and 100 μm CaCl2). The concentration of the cell suspension was adjusted to obtain an A600 ∼2.0; the suspension was maintained in the dark and then illuminated with a green CW laser at 1 watt (532 nm). A parallel experiment with 10 μm carbonyl cyanide m-chlorophenyl hydrazone (CCCP) was conducted to confirm the proton-specificity of the assay. To screen for the optimal HwBR crystallization conditions, purified HwBR was analyzed for monodispersity using a size exclusion column, and its absorption was monitored at 280 and 552 nm. The protein was loaded onto a size exclusion column (Superdex 200 10/30 GL; GE Health Sciences) using Buffer A (50 mm CH3COONa, pH 4.5, 200 mm NaCl) and Buffer B (20 mm Tris, pH 7.0, 150 mm NaCl) as the elution buffer in the presence of 0.05–0.15% DDM, n-octyl-β-d-glucopyranoside (OG), or n-decyl-β-maltoside (DM). After dialysis in buffer with 0.15% DM, the elution pattern showed a monodispersed peak as well. In our detergent screening experiment, the HwBR protein showed monodisperse peaks in both buffers in 0.15% DM. Therefore, we used HwBR protein in Buffer A with 0.15% DM as the sample for crystallization. The purified HwBR protein was concentrated to ∼17 mg/ml, as estimated by ultraviolet absorbance, and it was mixed with 1-oleoyl-rac-glycerol (monoolein; Sigma-Aldrich) at a 2:3 (w/w) protein-to-lipid ratio using the twin-syringe mixing method. The volume of each drop was 0.2 μl of protein-lipid mixture plus 1 μl. HwBR crystals of the trimeric form were grown in 0.05 m sodium citrate, pH 5.5, 0.05 m NaCl, and 15% (v/v) PEG 400, and antiparallel dimeric crystals were grown in 0.1 m ammonium sulfate, 0.1 m sodium chloride, 0.01 m sodium acetate, pH 4.0, and 16.5% (v/v) PEG 200. The size of the crystals reached about 50 × 50 × 5 μm within 2–30 days at 20 °C. The HwBR trimeric form crystals were soaked in 30% (v/v) glycerol as a cryoprotectant before harvest. X-ray diffraction data were collected at BL15A1 of the National Synchrotron Radiation Research Center (NSRRC), Hsinchu, Taiwan and at 44XU of SPring-8, Sayo, Japan. The data were processed using HKL2000 (53Otwinowski Z. Minor W.

Multiple alignment of BR amino acid sequences (Fig. 1A) shows that the BRs share 50–80% identity. However, the amino acid sequence of HwBR from a quadrate-shaped bacterium, H. walsbyi, constitutes a novel group with HmBRII according to the phylogenetic tree analysis (Fig. 1B). We named this unidentified and distinct superfamily qR. The HwBR gene was constructed with a C-terminal hexahistidine tag and expressed in E. coli C43 (DE3) as described previously (35Fu H.Y.

The purified HwBR protein in buffer with detergent had a λmax at 552 nm, which is almost consistent with the absorbance value of HsBR monomer, and as a reference, the absorption peak of HsBR trimer, known as purple membrane, showed a peak value at 568 nm, which was red-shifted 13 nm when compared with monomer BR (Fig. 2A) (49Wang J.

Three commonly used detergents, DDM, DM, and OG, in different buffer conditions under pH 4.5 and 7.0, were tested for monodispersity properties of HwBR. The HwBR protein showed two very close peaks in both buffers with 0.02% DDM. In buffers with 0.2% OG, the HwBR protein formed broad peaks. In our detergent screening experiment, HwBR protein showed monodispersed peaks in both buffers with 0.15% DM. After the protein in OG was dialyzed against buffer A with 0.15% DM and loaded onto the column, the elution pattern was restored from the broad peaks to a monodispersed peak in DM (Fig. 3). Therefore, we selected HwBR protein in Buffer A containing 0.15% DM as the sample for crystallization, which yielded purple crystals.FIGURE 3Buffer and detergent selection of HwBR using size exclusion column.

Matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9) is active in islets and cleaves hIAPP. We investigated whether hIAPP fragments arising from MMP-9 cleavage retain the potential to aggregate and cause toxicity, and whether overexpressing MMP-9 in amyloid-prone islets reduces amyloid burden and the resulting β-cell toxicity. Synthetic hIAPP was incubated with MMP-9 and the major hIAPP fragments observed by MS comprised residues 1–15, 1–25, 16–37, 16–25, and 26–37. The fragments 1–15, 1–25, and 26–37 did not form amyloid fibrils in vitro and they were not cytotoxic when incubated with β cells. Mixtures of these fragments with full-length hIAPP did not modulate the kinetics of fibril formation by full-length hIAPP. In contrast, the 16–37 fragment formed fibrils more rapidly than full-length hIAPP but was less cytotoxic. Co-incubation of MMP-9 and fragment 16–37 ablated amyloidogenicity, suggesting that MMP-9 cleaves hIAPP 16–37 into non-amyloidogenic fragments. Consistent with MMP-9 cleavage resulting in largely non-amyloidogenic degradation products, adenoviral overexpression of MMP-9 in amyloid-prone islets reduced amyloid deposition and β-cell apoptosis.

https://openalex.org/W2172365047,"Purpose The hyperdense basilar artery sign (HBAS) is an indicator of vessel occlusion on non contrast-enhanced computer tomography (NECT) in acute stroke patients. Since basilar artery occlusion (BAO) is associated with a high mortality and morbidity, its early detection is of great clinical value. We sought to analyze the influence of density measurement as well as a normalized ratio of Hounsfield unit/hematocrit (HU/Hct) ratio on the detection of BAO on NECT in patients with suspected BAO. Materials and Methods 102 patients with clinically suspected BAO were examined with NECT followed immediately by Multidetector computed tomography Angiography. Two observers independently analyzed the images regarding the presence or absence of HBAS on NECT and performed HU measurements in the basilar artery. Receiver operating characteristic curve analysis was performed to determine the optimal density threshold for BAO using attenuation measurements or HU/Hct ratio. Results Sensitivity of visual detection of the HBAS on NECT was relatively low 81% (95%-CI, 54–95%) while specificity was high 91% (95%-CI, 82–96%). The highest sensitivity was achieved by the combination of visual assessment and additional quantitative attenuation measurements applying a cut-off value of 46.5 HU with 94% sensitivity and 81% specificity for BAO. A HU/Hct ratio >1.32 revealed sensitivity of 88% (95%-CI, 60–98%) and specificity of 84% (95%-CI, 74–90%). Conclusion In patients with clinically suspected acute BAO the combination of visual assessment and additional attenuation measurement with a cut-off value of 46.5 HU is a reliable approach with high sensitivity in the detection of BAO on NECT."
https://openalex.org/W2194342134,"The intracellular N-terminal domain of the nucleoside and drug transporter human concentrative nucleoside transporter (hCNT)3 was used as bait in a glutathione S-transferase pull-down approach, to identify hCNT3 protein partners, using human colon homogenates as a prey source. Galectin (Gal)-4 was identified as a potential hCNT3 partner in the colon. The biochemical validation of the Gal-4-hCNT3 interaction was verified by targeted pull-down assays and coimmunoprecipitation experiments in HT-29 cells, which endogenously express hCNT3 and Gal-4. Furthermore, Gal-4 was shown to colocalize with hCNT3 in HT-29 cells. The biologic significance of this interaction was obtained from experiments in which Gal-4 was knocked down, showing that this protein is a regulator of hCNT3 trafficking and retention at the cell membrane, reducing its plasma membrane location by 70%. Conversely, the addition of Gal-4 increased hCNT3 location at the plasma membrane by 77%, thereby demonstrating that this lectin modulates hCNT3 function in colonic cells. The integrity of this partnership may be clinically relevant, because hCNT3 may be responsible for the translocation of thiopurines, such as 6-mercaptopurine, a front-line treatment in inflammatory bowel disease. The expression of Gal-4 and hCNT3 proteins is not impaired in inflamed colon from patients with Crohn's disease, thereby anticipating the integrity of this system for drug targeting."
https://openalex.org/W1748331196,"Glutamate transporters maintain synaptic concentration of the excitatory neurotransmitter below neurotoxic levels. Their transport cycle consists of cotransport of glutamate with three sodium ions and one proton, followed by countertransport of potassium. Structural studies proposed that a highly conserved serine located in the binding pocket of the homologous GltPh coordinates l-aspartate as well as the sodium ion Na1. To experimentally validate these findings, we generated and characterized several mutants of the corresponding serine residue, Ser-364, of human glutamate transporter SLC1A2 (solute carrier family 1 member 2), also known as glutamate transporter GLT-1 and excitatory amino acid transporter EAAT2. S364T, S364A, S364C, S364N, and S364D were expressed in HEK cells and Xenopus laevis oocytes to measure radioactive substrate transport and transport currents, respectively. All mutants exhibited similar plasma membrane expression when compared with WT SLC1A2, but substitutions of serine by aspartate or asparagine completely abolished substrate transport. On the other hand, the threonine mutant, which is a more conservative mutation, exhibited similar substrate selectivity, substrate and sodium affinities as WT but a lower selectivity for Na+ over Li+. S364A and S364C exhibited drastically reduced affinities for each substrate and enhanced selectivity for l-aspartate over d-aspartate and l-glutamate, and lost their selectivity for Na+ over Li+. Furthermore, we extended the analysis of our experimental observations using molecular dynamics simulations. Altogether, our findings confirm a pivotal role of the serine 364, and more precisely its hydroxyl group, in coupling sodium and substrate fluxes.

https://openalex.org/W1796223727,"Posterior Cortical Atrophy (PCA) is a neurodegenerative disease characterized by a progressive decline in selective cognitive functions anatomically referred to occipital, parietal and temporal brain regions, whose diagnosis is rather challenging for clinicians. The aim of this study was to assess, using quantitative Magnetic Resonance Imaging techniques, the pattern of regional grey matter loss and metabolism in individuals with PCA to improve pathophysiological comprehension and diagnostic confidence.We enrolled 5 patients with PCA and 5 matched controls who all underwent magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and spectroscopy (MRS). Patients also underwent neuropsychological and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) assessments. MRI data were used for unbiased assessment of regional grey matter loss in PCA patients compared to controls. MRS data were obtained from a set of brain regions, including the occipital lobe and the centrum semiovale bilaterally, and the posterior and anterior cingulate.VBM analysis documented the presence of focal brain atrophy in the occipital lobes and in the posterior parietal and temporal lobes bilaterally but more pronounced on the right hemisphere. MRS revealed, in the occipital lobes and in the posterior cingulate cortex of PCA patients, reduced levels of N-Acetyl Aspartate (NAA, a marker of neurodegeneration) and increased levels of Myo-Inositol (Ins, a glial marker), with no hemispheric lateralization.The bilateral but asymmetric pattern of regional grey matter loss is consistent with patients' clinical and neuropsychological features and with previous literature. The MRS findings reveal different stages of neurodegeneration (neuronal loss; gliosis), which coexist and likely precede the occurrence of brain tissue loss, and might represent early biomarkers. In conclusion, this study indicates the potential usefulness of a multi-parametric MRI approach for an early diagnosis and staging of patients with PCA."
https://openalex.org/W2212591606,"The broad variety of substances that inhibit the action of the ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS)—known as proteasome inhibitors—have been used extensively in previous studies, and they are currently frequently proposed as a novel form of cancer treatment and as a protective factor in intracerebral hemorrhage treatment. The experimental data on the safest route of proteasome inhibitor administration, their associated side effects, and the possible ways of minimizing these effects have recently become a very important topic. The aim of our present study was to determine the effects of administering of MG-132, lactacystin and epoxomicin, compounds belonging to three different classes of proteasome inhibitors, on the ependymal walls of the lateral ventricle. Observations were made 2 and 8 weeks after the intraventricular administration of the studied substances dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) into the lateral ventricle of adult Wistar rats. Qualitative and quantitative analysis of brain sections stained with histochemical and inmmunofluorescence techniques showed that the administration of proteasome inhibitors caused a partial occlusion of the injected ventricle in all of the studied animals. The occlusion was due to ependymal cells damage and subsequent ependymal discontinuity, which caused direct contact between the striatum and the lateral nuclei of the septum, mononuclear cell infiltration and the formation of a glial scar between these structures (with the activation of astroglia, microglia and oligodendroglia). Morphologically, the ubiquitin-positive aggregates corresponded to aggresomes, indicating impaired activity of the UPS and the accumulation and aggregation of ubiquitinated proteins that coincided with the occurrence of glial scars. The most significant changes were observed in the wall covering the striatum in animals that were administered epoxomicin, and milder changes were observed in animals administered lactacystin and MG-132. Interestingly, DMSO administration also caused damage to some of the ependymal cells, but the aggresome-like structures were not formed. Our results indicate that all of the studied classes of proteasome inhibitors are detrimental to ependymal cells to some extent, and may cause severe changes in the ventricular system. The safety implications of their usage in therapeutic strategies to attenuate intracerebral hemorrhagic injury and in brain cancer treatment will require further studies."
https://openalex.org/W1767703450,"We propose a metric which can be used to compute the amount of heritable variation enabled by a given dynamical system. A distribution of selection pressures is used such that each pressure selects a particular fixed point via competitive exclusion in order to determine the corresponding distribution of potential fixed points in the population dynamics. This metric accurately detects the number of species present in artificially prepared test systems, and furthermore can correctly determine the number of heritable sets in clustered transition matrix models in which there are no clearly defined genomes. Finally, we apply our metric to the GARD model and show that it accurately reproduces prior measurements of the model’s heritability."
https://openalex.org/W1795568480,"High hydrostatic pressure (HHP) affects the structure, metabolism and survival of micro-organisms including bacteria. For this reason HHP is a promising treatment in the food industry. The aim of this work is to evaluate the effect of high pressure, under isochoric cooling conditions, on Escherichia coli, where such high pressure develops due to the fact water cannot expand. We combine survival curves obtained by spectrophotometry and images of atomic force microscopy in this study. Our results show that cooling at -20 and -30°C leads to a partial destruction of a Escherichia coli population. However, cooling at -15°C causes a total extermination of bacteria. This intriguing result is explained by the phase diagram of water. In the first case, the simultaneous formation of ice III and ice Ih crystals provides a safe environment for bacteria. In the second case (-15°C) Escherichia coli remains in a metastable and amorphous free-of-crystals liquid subjected to high pressure. Our work is the first experimental study carried out to inactivate Escherichia coli under isochoric cooling conditions. Unlike HHP, which is based on the application of an external load to augment the pressure, this technique only requires cooling. The method could be used for annihilation of other Escherichia coli strains and perhaps other micro-organisms."
https://openalex.org/W2336814610,"Background Suppressed mitochondrial biogenesis (MB) contributes to acute kidney injury (AKI) after many insults. AKI occurs frequently after liver transplantation (LT) and increases mortality. This study investigated whether disrupted mitochondrial homeostasis plays a role in AKI after LT. Methods Livers were explanted from Lewis rats and implanted after 18 h cold storage. Kidney and blood were collected 18 h after LT. Results In the kidney, oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) proteins ATP synthase-β and NADH dehydrogenase-3 decreased 44% and 81%, respectively, with marked reduction in associated mRNAs. Renal PGC-1α, the major regulator of MB, decreased 57% with lower mRNA and increased acetylation, indicating inhibited synthesis and suppressed activation. Mitochondrial transcription factor-A, which controls mtDNA replication and transcription, protein and mRNA decreased 66% and 68%, respectively, which was associated with 64% decreases in mtDNA. Mitochondrial fission proteins Drp-1 and Fis-1 and mitochondrial fusion protein mitofusin-1 all decreased markedly. In contrast, PTEN-induced putative kinase 1 and microtubule-associated protein 1A/1B-light chain 3 increased markedly after LT, indicating enhanced mitophagy. Concurrently, 18- and 13-fold increases in neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin and cleaved caspase-3 occurred in renal tissue. Both serum creatinine and blood urea nitrogen increased >2 fold. Mild to moderate histological changes were observed in the kidney, including loss of brush border, vacuolization of tubular cells in the cortex, cast formation and necrosis in some proximal tubular cells. Finally, myeloperoxidase and ED-1 also increased, indicating inflammation. Conclusion Suppression of MB, inhibition of mitochondrial fission/fusion and enhancement of mitophagy occur in the kidneys of recipients of liver grafts after long cold storage, which may contribute to the occurrence of AKI and increased mortality after LT."
https://openalex.org/W1948895110,"We analyzed whether further education in young adult and mid-life [adult educational mobility] influences physical functioning and depressive symptoms in women.14247 women born 1973-78 (younger cohort) and 13715 women born 1946-51 (mid-aged cohort) from the Australian Longitudinal Study on Women's Health were followed for 14-16 years. Measures were the Short-Form 36 Health Survey physical functioning subscale (SF-36 PF) and Centre for Epidemiologic Studies 10-item Depression Scale (CESD-10). Linear mixed modelling, accounting for time varying covariates, assessed the influence of further education on physical functioning and depressive symptoms over time. Sensitivity analysis to assess the impact of missing data was conducted using multiple imputation.Compared to younger women with a pre-existing high level of education, women gaining further education (up to age 39 years) from low levels had lower SF-36 PF scores (poorer physical functioning) (fully adjusted beta estimates (95%CIs) -1.52 (-2.59, -0.44)) while those gaining further education from middle to high levels showed equivalent SF-36 PF scores (-0.08 (-0.61, 0.44)). A similar pattern was shown for CESD-10 scores (0.78 (0.29, 1.25); -0.02 (-0.26, 0.21), respectively) where higher scores represented more depressive symptoms. For mid-age women, further education from a middle to high level resulted in equivalent SF-36 PF scores (-0.61 (-1.93,0.71)) but higher CESD-10 scores (0.49 (0.11, 0.86)), compared to highly educated women.Women who delay further education until they are aged between their 40s and 60s can improve or maintain their physical functioning but may have missed the critical time to minimise depressive symptomatology. Public health policy should focus on encouraging women to upgrade their educational qualifications earlier in life in order to potentially offset the negative associations between their initial lower socio-economic position class of origin and their mental health."
