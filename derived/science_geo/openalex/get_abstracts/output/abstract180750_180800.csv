https://openalex.org/W2069586118,"The origin and mechanisms of human interictal epileptic discharges remain unclear. Here, we describe a spontaneous, rhythmic activity initiated in the subiculum of slices from patients with temporal lobe epilepsy. Synchronous events were similar to interictal discharges of patient electroencephalograms. They were suppressed by antagonists of either glutamatergic or gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA)-ergic signaling. The network of neurons discharging during population events comprises both subicular interneurons and a subgroup of pyramidal cells. In these pyramidal cells, GABAergic synaptic events reversed at depolarized potentials. Depolarizing GABAergic responses in neurons downstream to the sclerotic CA1 region contribute to human interictal activity."

Experiments on atoms in cavities can be described by elementary models but reveal intriguing subtleties of the interplay of coherent dynamics with external couplings. Recent activity in this area has pioneered powerful new approaches to the study of quantum coherence and has fueled the growth of quantum information science. In years to come, the purview of cavity QED will continue to grow as researchers build on a rich infrastructure to attack some of the most pressing open questions in micro- and mesoscopic physics."

As the average global temperature increases, it is generally expected that the air will become drier and that evaporation from terrestrial water bodies will increase. Paradoxically, terrestrial observations over the past 50 years show the reverse. Here, we show that the decrease in evaporation is consistent with what one would expect from the observed large and widespread decreases in sunlight resulting from increasing cloud coverage and aerosol concentration."

We report here that deficiency in AID results in the development of hyperplasia of isolated lymphoid follicles (ILFs) associated with a 100-fold expansion of anaerobic flora in the small intestine. Reduction of bacterial flora by antibiotic treatment of AID-/- mice abolished ILF hyperplasia as well as the germinal center enlargement seen in secondary lymphoid tissues. Because an inability to switch to immunoglobulin A on its own does not lead to a similar phenotype, these results suggest that SHM of ILF B cells plays a critical role in regulating intestinal microflora."
https://openalex.org/W2017806523,A major challenge to increasing bandwidth in optical telecommunications is to encode electronic signals onto a lightwave carrier by modulating the light up to very fast rates. Polymer electro-optic materials have the necessary properties to function in photonic devices beyond the 40-GHz bandwidth currently available. An appropriate choice of polymers is shown to effectively eliminate the factors contributing to an optical modulator's decay in the high-frequency response. The resulting device modulates light with a bandwidth of 150 to 200 GHz and produces detectable modulation signal at 1.6 THz. These rates are faster than anticipated bandwidth requirements for the foreseeable future.

https://openalex.org/W2099810380,"The need for a planned response to a deliberate introduction of smallpox has recently become urgent. We constructed a stochastic simulator of the spread of smallpox in structured communities to compare the effectiveness of mass vaccination versus targeted vaccination of close contacts of cases. Mass vaccination before smallpox introduction or immediately after the first cases was more effective than targeted vaccination in preventing and containing epidemics if there was no prior herd immunity (that is, no prior immunologic protection within the population). The effectiveness of postrelease targeted and mass vaccinations increased if we assumed that there was residual immunity in adults vaccinated before 1972, but the effectiveness of targeted vaccination increased more than that of mass vaccination. Under all scenarios, targeted vaccination prevented more cases per dose of vaccine than did mass vaccination. Although further research with larger-scale structured models is needed, our results suggest that increasing herd immunity, perhaps with a combination of preemptive voluntary vaccination and vaccination of first responders, could enhance the effectiveness of postattack intervention. It could also help targeted vaccination be more competitive with mass vaccination at both preventing and containing a deliberate introduction of smallpox."
https://openalex.org/W2004414463,"In the past decade, there has been an increasing number of experiments on spontaneous Bose coherence of excitons and polaritons. Four major areas of research are reviewed here: three-dimensional excitons in the bulk semiconductor Cu2O, two-dimensional excitons in coupled quantum wells, Coulomb drag experiments in coupled two-dimensional electron gases, and polaritons in semiconductor microcavities. The unifying theory of all these experiments is the effect of spontaneous symmetry breaking in the Bose-Einstein condensation phase transition."
https://openalex.org/W2159070856,"Chromatin remodeling is required for efficient transcription of eukaryotic genes. In a genetic selection for budding yeast mutants that were defective in induction of the phosphate-responsive PHO5 gene, we identified mutations in ARG82/IPK2, which encodes a nuclear inositol polyphosphate kinase. In arg82 mutant strains, remodeling of PHO5 promoter chromatin is impaired, and the adenosine triphosphate-dependent chromatin-remodeling complexes SWI/SNF and INO80 are not efficiently recruited to phosphate-responsive promoters. These results suggest a role for the small molecule inositol polyphosphate in the regulation of chromatin remodeling and transcription."
https://openalex.org/W2102540369,"Recently, we showed that antibodies catalyze the generation of hydrogen peroxide (H 2 O 2 ) from singlet molecular oxygen ( 1 O 2 *) and water. Here, we show that this process can lead to efficient killing of bacteria, regardless of the antigen specificity of the antibody. H 2 O 2 production by antibodies alone was found to be not sufficient for bacterial killing. Our studies suggested that the antibody-catalyzed water-oxidation pathway produced an additional molecular species with a chemical signature similar to that of ozone. This species is also generated during the oxidative burst of activated human neutrophils and during inflammation. These observations suggest that alternative pathways may exist for biological killing of bacteria that are mediated by potent oxidants previously unknown to biology."
https://openalex.org/W1994473838,"Eukaryotes use adenosine triphosphate (ATP)-dependent chromatin-remodeling complexes to regulate gene expression. Here, we show that inositol polyphosphates can modulate the activities of several chromatin-remodeling complexes in vitro. Inositol hexakisphosphate (IP6) inhibits nucleosome mobilization by NURF, ISW2, and INO80 complexes. In contrast, nucleosome mobilization by the yeast SWI/SNF complex is stimulated by inositol tetrakisphosphate (IP4) and inositol pentakisphosphate (IP5). We demonstrate that mutations in genes encoding inositol polyphosphate kinases that produce IP4, IP5, and IP6 impair transcription in vivo. These results provide a link between inositol polyphosphates, chromatin remodeling, and gene expression."

https://openalex.org/W2047219257,"Histone deacetylases, typified by class I Rpd3 in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, have historically been associated with gene repression. We now demonstrate that Hos2, another member of the class I family, binds to the coding regions of genes primarily during gene activation, when it specifically deacetylates the lysines in H3 and H4 histone tails. Moreover, Hos2 is preferentially associated with genes of high activity genome-wide. We also show that Hos2 and an associated factor, Set3, are necessary for efficient transcription. Therefore, our data indicate that, in contrast to other class I histone deacetylases, Hos2 is directly required for gene activation."

However, little is known about the biological functions of EGFR in primary esophageal squamous epithelial cells. Using newly established primary human esophageal squamous epithelial cells as a platform, we overexpressed EGFR through retroviral transduction and established novel three-dimensional organotypic cultures. Additionally, EGFR was targeted in a cell type- and tissue-specific fashion to the esophageal epithelium in transgenic mice. EGFR overexpression in primary esophageal keratinocytes resulted in the biochemical activation of Akt and STAT pathways and induced enhanced cell migration and cell aggregation. When established in organotypic culture, EGFR-overexpressing cells had evidence of epithelial cell hyperproliferation and hyperplasia. These effects were also observed in EGFR-overexpressing transgenic mice and the esophageal cell lines established thereof. In particular, EGFR-induced effects upon aggregation appear to be mediated through the relocalization of p120 from the cytoplasm to the membrane and increased interaction with E-cadherin.

These events are mediated through various downstream targets of EGFR (e.g. the serine/threonine kinase Raf and mitogen-activated protein/extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2). In addition, Ras activation by EGFR is required for a vast array of cellular functions, foremost of which is the regulation of cellular proliferation. Activation of EGFR also results in the activation of the lipid kinase phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, generating the second messenger phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate, which in turn activates Akt. We have previously demonstrated that there is differential activation of the Akt isoforms by EGFR in esophageal cancer cells (4Okano J. Gaslightwala I. Birnbaum M.J. Rustgi A.K. Nakagawa H. J. Biol.

Apart from the mitogen-activated protein kinase and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase pathways, EGFR also activates other pathways such as phospholipase-C and its downstream protein kinase cascades, small GTPases such as Rho, and multiple signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) isoforms.EGFR activation is not only important in normal cellular processes, but it is frequently altered or overexpressed in many malignancies, especially those of squamous cell origin. Mechanisms that mediate EGFR overexpression include gene amplification, truncation of the carboxyl terminus, transcriptional activation, and posttranslational modifications. EGFR overexpression is a frequent genetic alteration in premalignant esophageal squamous dysplastic lesions and the early stages of esophageal squamous cell cancer (5Itakura Y. Sasano H. Shiga C.

This has led us to focus upon the role of EGFR-mediated signaling in esophageal epithelial cell biology and examine its role in models of esophageal squamous cell carcinogenesis.We describe herein novel organotypic esophageal cell culture and esophageal specific transgenic mouse models as the basis for examination of EGFR-mediated biological effects in physiologic environments that are often not possible in cancer-derived cell lines. We observe that EGFR overexpression results in hyperproliferation bothin vitro and in vivo but is not sufficient to induce cancer, explaining its frequent association with premalignant stages. Furthermore, EGFR activation results in increased cell migration. Mechanistically, the increase in cell migration induced by EGFR is mediated through up-regulation of matrix metalloproteinase-1 (MMP-1). Whereas EGFR overexpression did not influence the assembly of adherens junctions and desmosomes, it did induce a translocation of p120 catenin from the cytosol to the cell membrane that mediates the increased cell aggregation. We believe that these effects help to explain how EGFR modulates the persistence of proliferative basal cells into the suprabasal compartment of the squamous epithelium and that EGFR is critical for the initiating events in squamous carcinogenesis.DISCUSSIONEGFR-mediated activation of diverse signal transduction pathways results in protean cellular manifestations (1Blume-Jensen P. Hunter T. Nature. 2001; 411: 355-365Crossref PubMed Scopus (3099) Google Scholar, 2Wells A. Int. J. Biol. Cell Biol. 1999; 31: 637-643Crossref PubMed Scopus (885) Google Scholar, 3Schlessinger J. Cell. 2000; 103: 193-200Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3487) Google Scholar). Furthermore, EGFR overexpression is important in the premalignant stages of carcinogenesis. In order to address the biological roles of EGFR-mediated effects in physiological settings, we have developed and characterized primary human esophageal squamous epithelial cells that can recapitulate the stratified squamous epithelium in organotypic cell culture. In addition, we generated and characterized transgenic mice where EGFR is specifically targeted to the esophageal squamous epithelium. Notably, EGFR overexpression induces a hyperproliferative state, whereby proliferating basal cells persist into the normally differentiated suprabasal compartment, perhaps reflecting a combination of enhanced cell migration and cell aggregation. Furthermore, EGFR transgenic mouse-derived esophageal epithelial cells also reveal evidence of increased cell proliferation in the basal and suprabasal compartments.Cell migration is a highly coordinated process involving the precise regulation of cell adhesion to and dissociation from extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins (12Lauffenburger D.A. Horwitz A.F. Cell. 1996; 84: 359-369Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3254) Google Scholar). In our experimental systems, EGFR overexpression and activation result in increased migration of human and mouse esophageal epithelial cells. This is reversed by use of an inhibitor of EGFR tyrosine kinase, indicating a direct effect of EGFR upon cell migration. Our results are consistent with the importance of EGFR-mediated cell migration in developmental and spatial paradigms. EGFR can substitute for fibroblast growth factor in modulating cell migration in Drosophila (13Dossenbach C. Rock S. Affolter M. Development. 2001; 128: 4563-4572PubMed Google Scholar). It has also been observed that autocrine EGF signaling stimulates directionally persistent mammary epithelial cell migration (14Maheshwari G. Wiley H.S. Lauffenburger D.A. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 155: 1123-1128Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar).EGFR-mediated Cell Migration and MMP-1Many proteinases are capable of degrading ECM components, but one family of enzymes that appears to be particularly important for matrix degradation is the MMPs. Currently, the MMPs comprise a large family of over 20 secreted or transmembrane proteins that together can degrade all known components of the ECM and basement membrane (15Massova I. Kotra L.P. Fridman R. Mobashery S. FASEB J. 1998; 12: 1075-1095Crossref PubMed Scopus (698) Google Scholar, 16Stetler-Stevenson W.G. Hewitt R. Corcoran M. Semin. Cancer Biol. 1996; 7: 147-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (342) Google Scholar). MMP family members share functional and structural characteristics and can be categorized into the collagenase, gelatinase, stromelysin, and membrane-type MMP subfamilies. We find that EGFR-mediated cell migration appears to be coordinated specifically with increased secretion of MMP-1. Egfr−/− mice show low MMP expression in early lung development (17Kheradmand F. Rishi K. Werb Z. J. Cell Sci. 2002; 115: 839-848PubMed Google Scholar). Stimulation with EGF could up-regulate MMP in wild-type mice but not so in Egfr−/− mice, which suggests a direct link between EGFR and MMPs. MMP-9 has been shown to be up-regulated in ovarian cancer cell lines that harbor EGFR overexpression (18Alper O., De Santis M.L. Stromberg K. Hacker N.F. Cho-Chung Y.S. Salomon D.S. Int. J. Cancer. 2000; 88: 566-574Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar), and this may be mediated through phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase activity (19Ellerbroek S.M. Halbleib J.M. Benavidez M. Warmka K. Wattenberg E.V. Stack M.S. Hudson L.G. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 1855-1861PubMed Google Scholar). Additionally, MMP-9 is up-regulated in head and neck squamous carcinoma cell lines with EGFR amplification (20O-charoenrat P. Modjtahedi H. Rhys-Evans P. Court W.J. Box G.M. Eccles S.A. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 1121-1128PubMed Google Scholar).Originally, MMPs were considered to be most important almost exclusively in invasion and metastasis. However, recent studies document that MMPs are involved in several steps of cancer development. MMPs can regulate cell growth in different ways (e.g. the release of membrane-bound growth factors like tumor growth factor-α) (21Peschon J.J. Slack J.L. Reddy P. Stocking K.L. Sunnarborg S.W. Lee D.C. Russell W.E. Castner B.J. Johnson R.S. Fitzner J.N. Boyce R.W. Nelson N. Kozlosky C.J. Wolfson M.F. Rauch C.T. Cerretti D.P. Paxton R.J. March C.J. Black R.A. Science. 1998; 282: 1281-1284Crossref PubMed Scopus (1356) Google Scholar). ECM-bound growth factors also become more easily available after ECM degradation (22Manes S. Mira E. Barbacid M.M. Cipres A. Fernandez-Resa P. Buesa J.M. Merida I. Aracil M. Marquez G. Martinez-A C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 25706-25712Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar, 23Manes S. Llorente M. Lacalle R.A. Gomez-Mouton C. Kremer L. Mira E. Martinez-A C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 6935-6945Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). During metastasis, cancer cells must cross several ECM barriers. They cross the epithelial basement membrane, invade the surrounding stroma, and enter blood vessels or lymphatics. One of the first steps in invasion is migration.Up-regulation of MMP-1 in malignant tumors compared with normal tissue has been described for cancer cells, stromal cells, and fibroblast in squamous carcinogenesis, but these observations have been only correlative in nature (24Charous S.J.

Our findings support a direct and novel role of EGFR signaling and MMP-1 transcriptional regulation.E-cadherin and p120 Modulate EGFR Effects upon Cell AdhesionThrough the promotion of increased migration, EGFR is thought to decrease cell adhesion by way of its interaction with β-catenin, which after tyrosine phosphorylation can no longer mediate the connection of the cadherin-catenin complex with the actin-cytoskeleton (29Hoschuetzky H. Aberle H. Kemler R. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 127: 1375-1380Crossref PubMed Scopus (670) Google Scholar). Whereas we confirmed binding of EGFR to β-catenin, it did not result in changes of the phosphorylation status of β-catenin, since β-catenin is phosphorylated even in EPC2-GFP cells. It also has been reported that EGFR-mediated phosphorylation of plakoglobin after EGF stimulation leads to a loss of adhesion (30Gaudry C.A. Palka H.L. Dusek R.L. Huen A.C Khandekar M.J. Hudson L.G. Green K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 24871-24880Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). We could not confirm this in our experimental conditions. By contrast, our results show that EGFR overexpression and activation do not induce changes in the assembly of adherens junctions and desmosomes but that EGFR mediates increased cell aggregation through relocalization of p120, a component of adherens junctions.E-cadherin associates with p120, but this is not necessary for its link to the cytoskeleton (31Daniel J.M. Reynolds A.B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 4819-4824Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), although it is important for cell adhesion and may serve as a scaffold for recruitment of other small RhoGTPases (32Fukata M. Kaibuchi K. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 2: 887-897Crossref PubMed Scopus (352) Google Scholar, 33Nakagawa M. Fukata M. Yamaga M. Itoh N. Kaibuchi K. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 1829-1838Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, p120 appears to be an important regulator of adhesion through its interactions with RhoGTPase family members that modulate transitions between migration and adhesion (34Anastasiadis P.Z. Reynolds A.B. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2001; 13: 604-610Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar, 35Braga V.M. Machesky L.M. Hall A. Hotchin N.A. J.

Cancer. 2000; 36: 1269-1274Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). We find that the p120 cytosolic pool is decreased in EGFR-overexpressing esophageal epithelial cells, which may contribute to the increased cell aggregation by virtue of the fact that more p120 binds E-cadherin. Functionally, the cell aggregation assay is supportive of this notion. Furthermore, our confocal microscopy data show that p120 has predominantly a cytoplasmic distribution in EPC2-GFP cells, which shifts to a membranous localization in EPC2-EGFR cells. Furthermore, the localization of p120 in organotypic culture correlates with EGFR overexpression.The clustering potential of E-cadherin is attributable to the juxtamembrane domain, which seems to be activated by the homophilic interaction between cadherin extracellular domains (37Yap A.S. Niessen C.M. Gumbiner B.M. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 779-789Crossref PubMed Scopus (463) Google Scholar). Mutational analysis of the juxtamembrane domain has demonstrated the importance of this region for the regulation of adhesion mediated by p120 (38Thoreson M.A. Anastasiadis P.Z. Daniel J.M. Ireton R.C. Wheelock M.J. Johnson K.R. Hummingbird D.K. Reynolds A.B. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 148: 189-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar) as uncoupling of E-cadherin from p120 results in weaker adhesion.In summary, EGFR overexpression leads to a hyperproliferative state with induction of enhanced cell migration. This permits cells in the basal compartment to migrate to the suprabasal compartment. The migration may be related to an increased secretion of MMP-1. We believe that there is activation of cell-cell aggregation once cells migrate to the suprabasal compartment. This appears to be modulated by the availability of p120 to bind E-cadherin, thus permitting a homeostatic balance between proliferation in the basal compartment and differentiation in the suprabasal compartment. Our studies allow for novel insights into EGFR-mediated effects on cellular processes in the normal esophageal epithelium and may help to explain the initiating events in squamous carcinogenesis. Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)1 is a transmembrane protein receptor with tyrosine kinase activity that triggers numerous signaling pathways (1Blume-Jensen P. Hunter T.

Nature. 2001; 411: 355-365Crossref PubMed Scopus (3099) Google Scholar, 2Wells A. Int. J. Biol. Cell Biol. 1999; 31: 637-643Crossref PubMed Scopus (885) Google Scholar, 3Schlessinger J. Cell. 2000; 103: 193-200Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3487) Google Scholar). Furthermore, EGFR overexpression is important in the premalignant stages of carcinogenesis. In order to address the biological roles of EGFR-mediated effects in physiological settings, we have developed and characterized primary human esophageal squamous epithelial cells that can recapitulate the stratified squamous epithelium in organotypic cell culture. In addition, we generated and characterized transgenic mice where EGFR is specifically targeted to the esophageal squamous epithelium. Notably, EGFR overexpression induces a hyperproliferative state, whereby proliferating basal cells persist into the normally differentiated suprabasal compartment, perhaps reflecting a combination of enhanced cell migration and cell aggregation. Furthermore, EGFR transgenic mouse-derived esophageal epithelial cells also reveal evidence of increased cell proliferation in the basal and suprabasal compartments.Cell migration is a highly coordinated process involving the precise regulation of cell adhesion to and dissociation from extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins (12Lauffenburger D.A. Horwitz A.F. Cell. 1996; 84: 359-369Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3254) Google Scholar). In our experimental systems, EGFR overexpression and activation result in increased migration of human and mouse esophageal epithelial cells. This is reversed by use of an inhibitor of EGFR tyrosine kinase, indicating a direct effect of EGFR upon cell migration. Our results are consistent with the importance of EGFR-mediated cell migration in developmental and spatial paradigms. EGFR can substitute for fibroblast growth factor in modulating cell migration in Drosophila (13Dossenbach C. Rock S. Affolter M. Development. 2001; 128: 4563-4572PubMed Google Scholar). It has also been observed that autocrine EGF signaling stimulates directionally persistent mammary epithelial cell migration (14Maheshwari G. Wiley H.S. Lauffenburger D.A. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 155: 1123-1128Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar).EGFR-mediated Cell Migration and MMP-1Many proteinases are capable of degrading ECM components, but one family of enzymes that appears to be particularly important for matrix degradation is the MMPs. Currently, the MMPs comprise a large family of over 20 secreted or transmembrane proteins that together can degrade all known components of the ECM and basement membrane (15Massova I. Kotra L.P. Fridman R. Mobashery S. FASEB J. 1998; 12: 1075-1095Crossref PubMed Scopus (698) Google Scholar, 16Stetler-Stevenson W.G. Hewitt R. Corcoran M. Semin. Cancer Biol. 1996; 7: 147-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (342) Google Scholar). MMP family members share functional and structural characteristics and can be categorized into the collagenase, gelatinase, stromelysin, and membrane-type MMP subfamilies. We find that EGFR-mediated cell migration appears to be coordinated specifically with increased secretion of MMP-1. Egfr−/− mice show low MMP expression in early lung development (17Kheradmand F. Rishi K. Werb Z. J. Cell Sci. 2002; 115: 839-848PubMed Google Scholar). Stimulation with EGF could up-regulate MMP in wild-type mice but not so in Egfr−/− mice, which suggests a direct link between EGFR and MMPs. MMP-9 has been shown to be up-regulated in ovarian cancer cell lines that harbor EGFR overexpression (18Alper O., De Santis M.L. Stromberg K. Hacker N.F. Cho-Chung Y.S. Salomon D.S. Int. J. Cancer. 2000; 88: 566-574Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar), and this may be mediated through phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase activity (19Ellerbroek S.M. Halbleib J.M. Benavidez M. Warmka K. Wattenberg E.V. Stack M.S. Hudson L.G. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 1855-1861PubMed Google Scholar). Additionally, MMP-9 is up-regulated in head and neck squamous carcinoma cell lines with EGFR amplification (20O-charoenrat P. Modjtahedi H. Rhys-Evans P. Court W.J. Box G.M. Eccles S.A. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 1121-1128PubMed Google Scholar).Originally, MMPs were considered to be most important almost exclusively in invasion and metastasis. However, recent studies document that MMPs are involved in several steps of cancer development. MMPs can regulate cell growth in different ways (e.g. the release of membrane-bound growth factors like tumor growth factor-α) (21Peschon J.J. Slack J.L. Reddy P. Stocking K.L. Sunnarborg S.W. Lee D.C. Russell W.E. Castner B.J. Johnson R.S. Fitzner J.N. Boyce R.W. Nelson N. Kozlosky C.J. Wolfson M.F. Rauch C.T. Cerretti D.P. Paxton R.J. March C.J. Black R.A. Science. 1998; 282: 1281-1284Crossref PubMed Scopus (1356) Google Scholar). ECM-bound growth factors also become more easily available after ECM degradation (22Manes S. Mira E. Barbacid M.M. Cipres A. Fernandez-Resa P. Buesa J.M. Merida I. Aracil M. Marquez G. Martinez-A C. J. Biol.

They cross the epithelial basement membrane, invade the surrounding stroma, and enter blood vessels or lymphatics. One of the first steps in invasion is migration.Up-regulation of MMP-1 in malignant tumors compared with normal tissue has been described for cancer cells, stromal cells, and fibroblast in squamous carcinogenesis, but these observations have been only correlative in nature (24Charous S.J.

Our findings support a direct and novel role of EGFR signaling and MMP-1 transcriptional regulation.E-cadherin and p120 Modulate EGFR Effects upon Cell AdhesionThrough the promotion of increased migration, EGFR is thought to decrease cell adhesion by way of its interaction with β-catenin, which after tyrosine phosphorylation can no longer mediate the connection of the cadherin-catenin complex with the actin-cytoskeleton (29Hoschuetzky H.

https://openalex.org/W2037290021,"Lymphoma cells infected with Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus are autocrine dependent on virus-derived interleukin-6 (IL-6), but not on cellular IL-6. During viral infection, host cells induce the antiviral factor interferon (IFN) to up-regulate p21, initiate cell cycle arrest, and inhibit virus replication. Viral IL-6, however, blocks IFN signaling. A viral transcriptional program exists in which only the viral IL-6 gene is directly activated by IFN-alpha, allowing the virus to modify its cellular environment by sensing and responding to levels of intracellular IFN signaling. The human cytokine cannot mimic this effect because IFN-alpha down-regulates the IL-6 receptor, gp80. Viral IL-6 bypasses the gp80 regulatory checkpoint by binding directly to the gp130 transducer molecule, resulting in tumor cell autocrine dependence on the viral cytokine for proliferation and survival."

CXCR4 has also been implicated in breast cancer metastasis. We examined the ability of CXCR4 to homomultimerize in detergent-solubilized cell lysates and in the membranes of intact cells. CXCR4 was found to multimerize in cell lysates containing the detergents CHAPSO or Cymal-7 but not other detergents that have been shown to disrupt the native conformation of CXCR4. CXCR4 expression levels did not affect the observed multimerization and differentially tagged CXCR4 molecules associated only when coexpressed in the same cell. CXCR4 did not interact with CCR5, the other principal HIV-1 coreceptor, when the two proteins were coexpressed. Using bioluminescence resonance energy transfer (BRET2), we demonstrated that CXCR4 multimers are found naturally in the intact cell membrane, in both the presence and absence of multiple CXCR4 ligands. Ligand binding did not significantly alter the observed BRET2 signal, suggesting that CXCR4 exists as a constitutive oligomer. In cell lysates prepared with non-denaturing detergents, CXCR4 sedimented in a manner consistent with a dimer, whereas CCR5 sedimented as a monomer under these conditions.

Purification and study of GPCRs are complicated by both low expression levels (4Tate C.G. Grisshammer R. Trends Biotechnol. 1996; 14: 426-430Google Scholar) and hydrophobicity.CXCR4 is a member of the GPCR family of proteins and is the natural receptor for stromal cell-derived growth factor 1α (SDF-1α) (5Bleul C.C.

CXCR4 is essential in mouse development, as demonstrated by the observation that disruption of the cxcr4 gene leads to hematopoietic, cardiovascular, and cerebellar defects and embryonic lethality (7Zou Y.R.

Tachibana K. Takakura N. Nishikawa S. Kitamura Y. Yoshida N. Kikutani H. Kishimoto T. Nature. 1996; 382: 635-638Google Scholar), suggesting that CXCR4 may be the sole receptor for SDF-1α. CXCR4 has also been implicated in breast cancer metastasis (10Muller A. Homey B. Soto H., Ge, N. Catron D. Buchanan M.E. McClanahan T. Murphy E. Yuan W. Wagner S.N. Barrera J.L. Mohar A.

These studies demonstrate the biological importance of CXCR4.CXCR4 has also been shown to be a principal coreceptor for human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) infection (11Feng Y. Broder C.C.

Interaction with these coreceptors is believed to induce further conformational changes in the envelope glycoprotein, gp41 (18Jones P.L. Korte T. Blumenthal R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 404-409Google Scholar), culminating in viral fusion with the host cell membrane. The diverse roles of CXCR4 in physiology and disease underscore the importance of furthering our understanding of the biochemistry of this chemokine receptor.In recent years, it has been speculated that GPCRs may form both homomultimers and heteromultimers in the cell membrane. Coexpression studies with the GABAb-R2 receptor demonstrated that efficient surface expression and function was dependent upon association of this protein with the GABAb-R1 protein (19Jones K.A.

The interpretation of these data was that hetero-oligomerization was necessary for the functionality of this receptor. Most studies of GPCR oligomerization have involved co-immunoprecipitation and cross-linking (22Vila-Coro A.J. Mellado M. Martin de Ana A. Lucas P. del Real G. Martinez A.C. Rodriguez-Frade J.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 3388-3393Google Scholar). Specifically, multiple groups have demonstrated either constitutive (23Benkirane M. Jin D.Y. Chun R.F. Koup R.A. Jeang K.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 30603-30606Google Scholar) or ligand-induced multimerization of CCR5 in cell lysates (22Vila-Coro A.J. Mellado M. Martin de Ana A. Lucas P. del Real G. Martinez A.C. Rodriguez-Frade J.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 3388-3393Google Scholar). Using these techniques, it was also shown that the β2-adrenergic receptor can form multimers in detergent-containing cell lysates (24Hebert T.E. Loisel T.P. Adam L. Ethier N. Onge S.S. Bouvier M. Biochem. J. 1998; 330: 287-293Google Scholar, 25Hebert T.E. Moffett S. Morello J.P. Loisel T.P. Bichet D.G. Barret C. Bouvier M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 16384-16392Google Scholar, 26Angers S.

A. 2000; 97: 3684-3689Google Scholar).The above studies used detergent-solubilized cell lysates to investigate GPCR multimerization. Multimerization can also be approached using intact cells with proximity-based assays such as fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) or bioluminescence resonance energy transfer (BRET). BRET, which utilizes the transfer of energy from Renilla luciferase to a yellow fluorescent protein (YFP) in close proximity (<50 Å), has been employed to demonstrate multimerization of both β2-adrenergic receptor (26Angers S. Salahpour A. Joly E. Hilairet S. Chelsky D. Dennis M. Bouvier M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 3684-3689Google Scholar) and CCR5 (27Issafras H. Angers S. Bulenger S. Blanpain C. Parmentier M. Labbe-Jullie C. Bouvier M. Marullo S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 34666-34673Google Scholar). Recently the BRET technology has been improved and is now called BRET2. This assay uses a newly formulated Renilla luciferase substrate (Deep Blue C™) that results in emission at a shorter wavelength (395 nm) as compared with that of conventional coelenterazine (480 nm). In addition, a modified GFP protein, GFP2, was synthesized that absorbs at 395 nm and emits at 510 nm. The original BRET assay used yellow fluorescent protein (YFP: emission of 525 nm), which could not efficiently absorb at 395 nm. These two modifications allow for greater spectral resolution (115 nm) than the traditional BRET assay (45 nm). The greater resolution results in less contamination of the GFP2 signal with background emission from the luciferase and thus more interpretable results.Our laboratory has recently developed a method to solubilize CXCR4 in a native conformation using the detergent CHAPSO (28Babcock G.J. Mirzabekov T. Wojtowicz W. Sodroski J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 38433-38440Google Scholar). CXCR4 contained within CHAPSO-solubilized cell lysates could bind conformation-dependent antibodies, the chemokine SDF-1α and CXCR4-using HIV-1 gp120 envelope glycoproteins (28Babcock G.J. Mirzabekov T. Wojtowicz W. Sodroski J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 38433-38440Google Scholar). This method is also effective at solubilizing conformationally intact CCR5. 2G. J. Babcock and J. Sodroski, unpublished results. 2G. J. Babcock and J. Sodroski, unpublished results. CCR5 contained in CHAPSO-solubilized cell lysates can bind both conformation-dependent antibodies and CCR5-using gp120; however, for as yet undetermined reasons, solubilized CCR5 cannot bind its natural ligands, MIP-1α, MIP-1β, or RANTES (29Mirzabekov T. Kontos H. Farzan M. Marasco W. Sodroski J. Nat. Biotechnol. 2000; 18: 649-654Google Scholar).Here we investigate the oligomerization state of CXCR4 in CHAPSO-solubilized cell lysates and intact cells. Coimmunoprecipitation studies using cell lysates determined that CXCR4 exists as a multimer under these conditions. This multimerization does not appear to be dependent upon overexpression or artifacts inherent in membrane protein solubilization. BRET2 analysis of intact cells demonstrated that CXCR4 is expressed as a constitutive multimer in the cell. Incubation with SDF-1α and HIV-1 gp120 (ligands for CXCR4) did not appreciably increase the observed energy transfer. Finally, sucrose density gradient centrifugation suggested that CXCR4 is dimeric.DISCUSSIONHerein we provide several pieces of evidence that suggest that human CXCR4 forms stable dimers in cells. Coimmunoprecipitation studies indicated that CXCR4 associated with itself in detergent lysates, but not with a related GPCR, CCR5. BRET2 analysis confirmed that, in intact cells, the self-association of CXCR4 is significantly more efficient than the homomultimerization of CCR5 or C5a receptor, a GPCR unrelated to the CXCR4 or CCR5 chemokine receptors. The BRET2 studies also confirmed that CXCR4 associates with itself far more efficiently than it associates with either CCR5 or C5a receptor. The binding of ligands to CXCR4 did not appear to substantially alter the degree of multimerization. The multimerization of CXCR4 occurs over a wide range of expression levels and depends upon preservation of the native conformation of CXCR4. The sedimentation of CXCR4-detergent complexes from cell lysates suggests that the majority of CXCR4 is a dimer under these conditions. These results indicate that CXCR4 forms specific, constitutive dimers in expressing cells.Dimerization between homologous and heterologous GPCRs has been described (19Jones K.A. Borowsky B. Tamm J.A.

In most cases, dimerization of GPCRs occurs independently of bound ligands, although stabilization of GPCR oligomers by agonist treatment has been reported (26Angers S. Salahpour A. Joly E. Hilairet S. Chelsky D. Dennis M. Bouvier M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 3684-3689Google Scholar, 34Lee S.P. Xie Z. Varghese G. Nguyen T. O'Dowd B.F. George S.R. Neuropsychopharmacology. 2000; 23: S32-S40Google Scholar). Our observation that precursor forms of CXCR4 were apparently self-associated in the coprecipitation studies suggests that dimerization occurs soon after CXCR4 synthesis and folding. The results of the sucrose density gradient analysis indicate that most or all of the CXCR4 in the cell lysate is dimeric. Ligand binding exerted little effect on multimerization. Together, these observations indicate that the native state of human CXCR4 may be a dimer.We observed little or no evidence of CXCR4 association with CCR5, the other major HIV-1 coreceptor (13Alkhatib G.

Nature. 1996; 381: 667-673Google Scholar),. The BRET2 signal associated with coexpression of CXCR4 and CCR5 did not exceed that associated with coexpression of CXCR4 or CCR5 with an unrelated GPCR, C5a receptor. We suspect that these BRET2 signals, which are consistently lower than that seen in the case of CXCR4 self-association, may result from the membrane expression of any tagged GPCRs. Thus, such BRET2 signals may not reflect specific associations between these proteins, but rather random associations promoted by the limited degrees of freedom available to the fusion proteins in the cell membrane.The specificity of CXCR4 association with itself suggests that regions of the protein that are unique among GPCRs mediate the dimerization. Based on the strong propensity of CXCR4 to form dimers and not higher order oligomers, it is likely that these represent head-to-head dimers. For some dimeric GPCRs, transmembrane helices 5 and 6 have been suggested to play an important role in protein-protein contacts (35Dean M.K. Higgs C. Smith R.E. Bywater R.P. Snell C.R. Scott P.D. Upton G.J. Howe T.J. Reynolds C.A. J. Med. Chem. 2001; 44: 4595-4614Google Scholar,36Gouldson P.R. Higgs C. Smith R.E. Dean M.K. Gkoutos G.V. Reynolds C.A. Neuropsychopharmacology. 2000; 23: S60-S77Google Scholar). The fifth transmembrane helix of CXCR4 contains an additional cysteine not found in the other chemokine receptors. Although there are no disulfide bonds linking CXCR4 dimers,2 it is possible that this residue contributes in other ways to CXCR4 dimerization. The robust nature of CXCR4 self-association should facilitate attempts to understand the molecular contacts responsible.It will be of interest to define the role of CXCR4 dimerization in the diverse roles of this GPCR in physiology and pathology. Some chemokines have been shown to form dimers, and significant avidity effects would accompany the interaction of dimeric ligands and receptors. There are conflicting data regarding the propensity of SDF-1α to dimerize. Sedimentation equilibrium and NMR studies of SDF-1α suggested that this chemokine is a monomer (37Crump M.P. Gong J.H. Loetscher P. Rajarathnam K. Amara A. Arenzana-Seisdedos F. Virelizier J.L. Baggiolini M. Sykes B.D. Clark-Lewis I. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 6996-7007Google Scholar), even at high concentrations. On the other hand, the N33A variant of SDF-1α crystallized as a dimer (38Dealwis C. Fernandez E.J. Thompson D.A. Simon R.J. Siani M.A. Lolis E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 6941-6946Google Scholar), the structure of which resembled the dimer of another chemokine, IL-8. Using analytical ultracentrifugation and dynamic light scattering, Holmes et al. (39Holmes W.D. Consler T.G. Dallas W.S. Rocque W.J. Willard D.H. Protein Expr. Purif. 2001; 21: 367-377Google Scholar) obtained evidence that SDF-1α exists in a monomer-dimer equilibrium. The dimerization constant was only 150 μm, suggesting that the weak self-association of SDF-1α could be significantly influenced by context-dependent variables. It is possible that receptor binding promotes SDF-1α dimerization through these otherwise weak bonds.CXCR4 dimerization could also influence its activity as an HIV-1 receptor. Most HIV-1 that are transmitted and predominate early in the course of infection utilize CCR5 as a coreceptor (40Valentin A. Albert J. Fenyo E.M. Asjo B. J. Virol. 1994; 68: 6684-6689Google Scholar, 41Wolinsky S.M. Wike C.M. Korber B.T. Hutto C. Parks W.P. Rosenblum L.L. Kunstman K.J. Furtado M.R. Munoz J.L.

Cao Y. Koup R.A. Ho D.D. Science. 1993; 261: 1179-1181Google Scholar). Later in infection, a high percentage of infected individuals harbor HIV-1 isolates that utilize, in addition, the CXCR4 receptor (40Valentin A. Albert J. Fenyo E.M. Asjo B. J. Virol. 1994; 68: 6684-6689Google Scholar, 44Asjo B. Morfeldt-Manson L. Albert J. Biberfeld G. Karlsson A. Lidman K. Fenyo E.M. Lancet. 1986; 2: 660-662Google Scholar, 45Schuitemaker H. Koot M.

Huisman H.G. Miedema F. J. Virol. 1989; 63: 2118-2125Google Scholar). The efficiency with which these late isolates replicate in cells expressing CD4 and CXCR4 equals or exceeds that of early isolates in cells expressing CD4 and CCR5 (48Peden K. Emerman M. Montagnier L. Virology. 1991; 185: 661-672Google Scholar, 49Turner S. Tizard R. DeMarinis J. Pepinsky R.B. Zullo J. Schooley R. Fisher R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

This high replication efficiency is achieved despite a significantly lower affinity of the gp120 glycoprotein of late isolates for CXCR4 compared with that of early isolates for CCR5 (28Babcock G.J. Mirzabekov T. Wojtowicz W. Sodroski J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 38433-38440Google Scholar, 51Wu L. Gerard N.P. Wyatt R. Choe H. Parolin C. Ruffing N. Borsetti A. Cardoso A.A. Desjardin E. Newman W.

The HIV-1 envelope glycoproteins are trimers and thus contain three receptor-binding sites. The interactions of envelope glycoprotein trimers with head-to-head dimers of CXCR4 could form hexameric arrays at the virus-cell interface. The avidity gained by the formation of such arrays could compensate for low gp120-CXCR4 affinity. Moreover, the assembly of such hexameric structures might also facilitate the membrane fusion process, which has been proposed to require the cooperation of several envelope glycoprotein trimers and 4–6 chemokine receptors (50Wrin T. Loh T.P. Vennari J.C. Schuitemaker H. Nunberg J.H. J. Virol. 1995; 69: 39-48Google Scholar).Other laboratories have recently reported that CCR5 exists as a multimer in cell lysates (22Vila-Coro A.J. Mellado M. Martin de Ana A. Lucas P. del Real G. Martinez A.C. Rodriguez-Frade J.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 3388-3393Google Scholar, 23Benkirane M. Jin D.Y. Chun R.F. Koup R.A. Jeang K.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 30603-30606Google Scholar) and intact cells (27Issafras H. Angers S. Bulenger S. Blanpain C. Parmentier M. Labbe-Jullie C. Bouvier M. Marullo S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 34666-34673Google Scholar). Our data suggest that, if CCR5 dimerizes, such dimers are much more weakly associated than CXCR4 dimers. The asymmetric peak of CCR5 in the sucrose density gradients raises the possibility that a minor fraction of CCR5 exists as a dimer under these conditions. CD4 also exhibited an asymmetric peak in the gradients, and weakly associated dimers of soluble CD4 have been observed at high protein concentrations (53Wu H. Kwong P.D. Hendrickson W.A. Nature. 1997; 387: 527-530Google Scholar). We did not detect evidence of CCR5 self-association in the coprecipitation experiments. Moreover, the BRET2 ratio observed for coexpression of CCR5-GFP2 and CCR5-Rluc was no greater than that observed for all of the mixed GPCR pairs tested. As discussed above, this BRET2 ratio may simply represent the background fluorescence due to the coexpression of two membrane-associated receptors with GFP2 and Rluc domains fused to their cytoplasmic tails. Future work will be required to determine whether CCR5 forms dimers and if such dimerization is relevant to its natural state and function. Recognition of the strong propensity of CXCR4 to dimerize should lead to an understanding of the importance of dimerization to CXCR4 signaling and utilization as an HIV-1 receptor. Seven transmembrane domain, G protein-coupled receptors (GPCR)1 are expressed in many different cell types and have various functions ranging from chemotaxis to light detection. Approximately 1–2% of the human genome encodes for GPCRs (1Drews J. Nat. Biotechnol. 1996; 14: 1516-1518Google Scholar, 2Horn F. Weare J. Beukers M.W. Horsch S. Bairoch A. Chen W. Edvardsen O.

Sci. 1997; 18: 430-437Google Scholar) and as such, these proteins are commonly targeted for pharmaceutical intervention. Purification and study of GPCRs are complicated by both low expression levels (4Tate C.G. Grisshammer R. Trends Biotechnol. 1996; 14: 426-430Google Scholar) and hydrophobicity. CXCR4 is a member of the GPCR family of proteins and is the natural receptor for stromal cell-derived growth factor 1α (SDF-1α) (5Bleul C.C. Farzan M. Choe H. Parolin C. Clark-Lewis I. Sodroski J. Springer T.A. Nature. 1996; 382: 829-833Google Scholar, 6Oberlin E. Amara A. Bachelerie F. Bessia C. Virelizier J.L. Arenzana-Seisdedos F. Schwartz O. Heard J.M. Clark-Lewis I. Legler D.F. Loetscher M. Baggiolini M. Moser B. Nature. 1996; 382: 833-835Google Scholar). CXCR4 is essential in mouse development, as demonstrated by the observation that disruption of the cxcr4 gene leads to hematopoietic, cardiovascular, and cerebellar defects and embryonic lethality (7Zou Y.R. Kottmann A.H. Kuroda M. Taniuchi I. Littman D.R. Nature. 1998; 393: 595-599Google Scholar, 8Tachibana K. Hirota S. Iizasa H. Yoshida H. Kawabata K. Kataoka Y. Kitamura Y. Matsushima K. Yoshida N. Nishikawa S. Kishimoto T. Nagasawa T. Nature. 1998; 393: 591-594Google Scholar). Almost identical phenotypes were associated with deletion of the sdf1α gene in mice (9Nagasawa T. Hirota S. Tachibana K. Takakura N. Nishikawa S. Kitamura Y. Yoshida N. Kikutani H. Kishimoto T. Nature. 1996; 382: 635-638Google Scholar), suggesting that CXCR4 may be the sole receptor for SDF-1α. CXCR4 has also been implicated in breast cancer metastasis (10Muller A. Homey B. Soto H., Ge, N. Catron D. Buchanan M.E. McClanahan T. Murphy E. Yuan W. Wagner S.N. Barrera J.L. Mohar A. Verastegui E. Zlotnik A. Nature. 2001; 410: 50-56Google Scholar). These studies demonstrate the biological importance of CXCR4. CXCR4 has also been shown to be a principal coreceptor for human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) infection (11Feng Y. Broder C.C. Kennedy P.E. Berger E.A. Science. 1996; 272: 872-877Google Scholar). The HIV-1 envelope glycoprotein, gp120, binds to the primary receptor, CD4 (12Dalgleish A.G. Beverley P.C. Clapham P.R. Crawford D.H. Greaves M.F. Weiss R.A. Nature. 1984; 312: 763-767Google Scholar), expressed on the cell surface. This interaction results in conformational changes in gp120 that allow binding to either CXCR4 (11Feng Y. Broder C.C. Kennedy P.E. Berger E.A. Science. 1996; 272: 872-877Google Scholar) or CCR5 (13Alkhatib G. Combadiere C. Broder C.C. Feng Y. Kennedy P.E. Murphy P.M. Berger E.A.

Interaction with these coreceptors is believed to induce further conformational changes in the envelope glycoprotein, gp41 (18Jones P.L. Korte T. Blumenthal R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 404-409Google Scholar), culminating in viral fusion with the host cell membrane. The diverse roles of CXCR4 in physiology and disease underscore the importance of furthering our understanding of the biochemistry of this chemokine receptor. In recent years, it has been speculated that GPCRs may form both homomultimers and heteromultimers in the cell membrane. Coexpression studies with the GABAb-R2 receptor demonstrated that efficient surface expression and function was dependent upon association of this protein with the GABAb-R1 protein (19Jones K.A.

https://openalex.org/W1989644817,"The transcription factor NF-κB has been shown to be predominantly cytoplasmically localized in the absence of an inductive signal. Stimulation of cells with inflammatory cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor α or interleukin-1 induces the degradation of IκB, the inhibitor of NF-κB, allowing nuclear accumulation of NF-κB and regulation of specific gene expression. The degradation of IκB is controlled initially by phosphorylation induced by the IκB kinase, which leads to ubiquitination and subsequent proteolysis of the inhibitor by the proteasome. We report here that NF-κB and IκBα (but not IκBβ) are also localized in the mitochondria. Stimulation of cells with tumor necrosis factor α leads to the phosphorylation of mitochondrial IκBα and its subsequent degradation by a nonproteasome-dependent pathway. Interestingly, expression of the mitochondrially encoded cytochromec oxidase III and cytochrome bmRNAs were reduced by cytokine treatment of cells. Inhibition of activation of mitochondrial NF-κB by expression of the superrepressor form of IκBα inhibited the loss of expression of both cytochromec oxidase III and cytochrome b mRNA. These data indicate that the NF-κB regulatory pathway exists in mitochondria and that NF-κB can negatively regulate mitochondrial mRNA expression.

Five members of the immediate NF-κB/Rel family have been identified: p50/NF-κB1, p65/RelA, p52/NF-κB2, RelB, and c-Rel. The classic form of NF-κB is the heterodimer of the p50 and p65 subunits (reviewed in Ref. 1Ghosh S. May M. Kopp E. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1998; 16: 225-260Google Scholar). In most cells, NF-κB is complexed with members of the IκB family, IκBα, IκBβ, and IκBε, which typically function to inhibit the action of this group of transcription factors. Stimulation of cells with stimuli such as TNFα1 leads to activation of the IκB kinase (IKK), which phosphorylates IκBα or IκBβ on N-terminal serines (1Ghosh S. May M. Kopp E. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1998; 16: 225-260Google Scholar, 2Zandi E. Karin M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 4547-4551Google Scholar). Phosphorylated IκB then is targeted for ubiquitination and subsequent degradation by the proteasome, allowing NF-κB to accumulate in the nucleus (3Maniatis T. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 505-510Google Scholar). In the nucleus, NF-κB is a positive regulator of gene expression through its ability to bind to target sequences in the regulatory regions of genes encoding cytokines, cytokine receptors, antiapoptotic proteins, and cell cycle regulators (1Ghosh S. May M. Kopp E. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1998; 16: 225-260Google Scholar, 4Baldwin A. J. Clin. Inv. 2001; 107: 3-6Google Scholar). Additionally, NF-κB has been shown to negatively regulate MyoD mRNA through a post-transcriptional mechanism that appears to require the transcriptional activity of NF-κB (5Guttridge D. Mayo M. Madrid L. Wang C.-Y. Baldwin A. Science. 2000; 289: 2363-2366Google Scholar). Presumably through its ability to regulate gene expression, NF-κB dysregulation contributes to a variety of diseases, including oncogenesis, arthritis, and cancer cachexia (4Baldwin A. J. Clin. Inv. 2001; 107: 3-6Google Scholar, 6Baldwin A. J. Clin. Inv. 2001; 107: 241-246Google Scholar). Recently, more complex aspects of NF-κB regulation have been proposed. For example, studies indicate that NF-κB shuttles into and out of the nucleus in unstimulated cells (7Carlotti F. Dower S. Qwarnstrom E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 41028-41034Google Scholar, 8Huang T. Kudo N. Yoshida M. Miyamoto S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 1014-1019Google Scholar, 9Tam W. Lee L. Davis L. Sen R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 2269-2284Google Scholar). Thus, it was found that leptomycin B, an inhibitor of nuclear export, leads to the accumulation of NF-κB and IκB in the nucleus without an external stimulus. Whether NF-κB and IκB shuttle in a complex has been questioned (7Carlotti F. Dower S. Qwarnstrom E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 41028-41034Google Scholar). Additionally, it has been proposed that IκB can be degraded by a nonproteasomal mechanism following stimulation of cells with cytokines (10Yan Y. Weinman S. Boldogh I. Walker R. Brasier A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 787-794Google Scholar). In that study, the use of inhibitors with distinct specificities indicated that phosphorylated IκBα can be degraded by calpain in addition to the more characterized proteasome pathway. The vertebrate mitochondrial genome is circular with ∼17 kb of DNA (11Anderson S. Bankier A. Barrell B. de Bruijn M. Coulson A. Drouin J. Eperon I. Nierlich D. Roe B. Sanger F. Schreier P. Smith A. Staden R. Young I. Nature. 1981; 290: 457-465Google Scholar) (for a review, see Ref. 12Scheffler I. Mitochondria. Wiley-Liss, Inc., New York1999: 367-384Google Scholar). The mitochondrial genome encodes two ribosomal RNAs, 22 tRNAs, and at least 13 peptides, which contribute to complex I, complex III, complex IV, and complex V of the electron transport system (11Anderson S. Bankier A. Barrell B. de Bruijn M. Coulson A. Drouin J. Eperon I. Nierlich D. Roe B. Sanger F. Schreier P. Smith A. Staden R. Young I. Nature. 1981; 290: 457-465Google Scholar, 12Scheffler I. Mitochondria. Wiley-Liss, Inc., New York1999: 367-384Google Scholar). A regulatory region associated with the origin of replication also serves as a promoter region for two large mitochondrial RNA transcripts that are processed into individual RNAs for the structural RNAs and mRNAs (see Ref. 13Puranami R. Attardi G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 548-561Google Scholar). For example, the mRNAs encoding cytochrome c oxidase I, II, and III (CoxI, -II, and -III, respectively) are derived from a common precursor RNA (12Scheffler I. Mitochondria. Wiley-Liss, Inc., New York1999: 367-384Google Scholar). We report here that the NF-κB subunits p50 and p65 along with IκBα, but not IκBβ, are found in the mitochondria as well as in the cytoplasm of proliferating cells. Quiescent liver cells exhibit largely p50 and IκBα in the mitochondria with little detectable p65. Electron microscopy and biochemical approaches confirm the localization of these proteins to mitochondria. Recently, others have found IκBα and p65 in the mitochondria of Jurkat T cells (14Bottero V. Rossi F. Samson M. Mari M. Hofman P. Peyron J.-F. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 21317-21324Google Scholar). Interestingly, our data indicate that mitochondrial IκBα is phosphorylated on N-terminal serines in response to cellular TNFα stimulation, followed by nonproteasomal degradation. TNFα treatment leads to a significant reduction in CoxIII and cytochrome bmRNA. Inhibition of NF-κB by mitochondrially localized superrepressor IκBα blocked the loss of both CoxIII and Cyt B mRNA. These data show that NF-κB is found in mitochondria, where it regulates mitochondrial specific gene expression. Cell lines were obtained from the Lineberger Comprehensive Cancer Center Tissue Culture Core Facility at the University of North Carolina (Chapel Hill, NC). U937 cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium H supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and antibiotics. HT1080 V and HT1080 I lines were previously described (15Wang C.-Y. Mayo M. Baldwin A. Science. 1996; 274: 784-787Google Scholar). Cells were treated with 10 ng/ml human recombinant TNFα diluted in phosphate-buffered saline. Calpeptin, lactacystin, and MG132 (Calbiochem) were all resuspended in Me2SO and used at a final concentration of 40 ng/ml. U937 cells were suspended in serum-free medium and were mixed with a fixative containing 0.5% glutaraldehyde in 0.1 m sodium cacodylate buffer, pH 7.4. The cells were cooled to 10 °C on ice, followed by microwave irradiation using a 750-watt microwave oven until of a final temperature of 40 °C was obtained (16Madden V.J. Microsc. Microanal. 1998; 4 Suppl. 2: 854-855Google Scholar). The fixed cells were pelleted, rinsed in 0.1 m sodium cacodylate buffer, and postfixed with 1% osmium tetroxide in 0.1 m sodium cacodylate buffer for 30 min. Following postfixation, the cell pellet was dehydrated through a graded series of ethanol washes and embedded in L. R. White resin (available from Ted Pella, Inc., Redding, CA). 70-nm ultrathin sections were taken of the embedded pellet, mounted on nickel grids, and stained using indirect immunocytochemical methods. Immunocytochemical labeling, incubations, and washing steps were carried out at ambient temperature. The incubation and wash buffer for the primary antibody consisted of 0.05 m Tris-buffered saline with 0.1% fish skin gelatin and 0.01% Tween 20 (TBS/FGT) at pH 7.6. Grid-mounted sections were blocked with 0.2 m glycine in Hanks' balanced salts for 10 min, followed by a secondary blocking step with 5% goat serum in TBS/FGT for 10 min. The grids were incubated for 1 h with primary antibody (p50/NF-κB1; Upstate Biotechnology, Inc., Lake Placid, NY). After rinsing with TBS/FGT, the grids were incubated for 1 h in secondary antibody (goat anti-rabbit IgG 10 nm colloidal gold (BBI International, Ted Pella, Redding, CA), diluted 1:50 in 0.1 m TBS/FGT, pH 8.2. Negative controls were performed concurrently, consisting of incubation in normal rabbit IgG at the same repetitive dilutions and conditions. The immunogold-stained sections were poststained with uranyl acetate followed by lead citrate, and the grids were observed and photographed using a LEO EM-910 transmission electron microscope (LEO Electron Microscopy, Inc., Thornwood, NY) at 80 kV. Mitochondria were isolated from cell lines as described previously (17Yang J. Liu X. Bhalla K. Kim C. Ibrado A. Cai J. Peng T.-I. Jones D. Wang X. Science. 1997; 275: 1129-1132Google Scholar). Digitonin was added to the mitochondrial buffer A at 0.05% to aid in the disruption of the cells. Further purification was performed by ultracentrifugation at 30,000 rpm in gradient buffer (250 mm mannitol, 1 mm EGTA, 25 mm Hepes, 0.1% bovine serum albumin), pH 7.4, supplemented with 30% Percol (Sigma). The uppermost band was removed and washed two or three times with mitochondrial buffer A. Mitochondria that were analyzed by Western blot analysis were boiled in SDS sample buffer and loaded directly onto SDS-polyacrylamide gels. When electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSAs) were performed, purified mitochondria were incubated in nuclear extract buffer for 10 min in ice. The sample was then centrifuged for 10 min at 12,000 rpm at 4 °C. The supernatants were used directly in the EMSA reaction (see below). Isolation of mitochondria from rat liver was as previously described (18Mancini M. Nicholson D. Roy S. Thornberry N. Peterson E. Casciola-Rosen L. Rosen A. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 140: 1485-1495Google Scholar). For Western blotting analysis of cultured cells, equal amounts of protein were separated on a 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gel and transferred to nitrocellulose. Blots were blocked in 5% milk in 1× TBST (Tris-buffered saline, 0.5% Tween 20) and probed with either p65 (Rockland, Gilbertsville, PA), p50, IKKα, IKKβ, IKKγ (Upstate Biotechnology), IκBα (c-21), IκBβ, Skp-1 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA), Lmp-2, (Affiniti Research Products, Exeter, UK), cytochrome c (PharMingen, San Jose, CA), or anti-phosphoserine-32 IκBα (New England Biolabs, Beverly, MA). Blots were probed with a secondary antibody conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (Promega Corp.) at a 1:15,000 dilution in 1× TBST. Protein bands were visualized with an enhanced chemiluminescence detection system (Amersham Life Sciences). Western blotting of rat liver mitochondria was performed as described (19Gervais F. Thornberry N. Ruffolo S. Nicholson D. Roy S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 17102-17108Google Scholar). EMSAs were performed as described previously (20Mayo M. Wang C.-Y. Cogswell P. Rogers-Graham K. Lowe S. Der C. Baldwin A. Science. 1997; 278: 1812-1815Google Scholar). An oligonucleotide corresponding to an NF-κB site in theH-2K b gene was radiolabeled using [α-32P]dCTP and the Klenow fragment of DNA polymerase I (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). For antibody supershift analysis, extracts were preincubated 15 min at room temperature with 1 μg of antiserum before the addition of the radiolabeled gel shift probe. Antibodies used in supershift analysis were identical to those utilized for Western blotting analysis. Cells were either treated or not treated with TNFα for specified times and harvested, and mitochondrial and cytoplasmic extracts were isolated in phosphate-buffered saline containing phosphatase inhibitors. Equal amounts of protein (500 μg) were immunoprecipitated using antibodies against the β subunit of IKK (a gift of Dr. F. Mercurio, Signal Pharmaceuticals, San Diego, CA). Kinase activity was determined by incubating the immunoprecipitates with 4 μg of glutathione S-transferase-IκBα (amino acids 1–54) wild type substrate or a mutated form of IκBα (S32T,S36T) in the presence of [γ-32P]ATP, as described (21Keifer J.A. Guttridge D. Ashburner B. Baldwin A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 22382-22387Google Scholar). The immunoprecipitates were subjected to SDS-PAGE, dried, and visualized by autoradiography. RNAs were isolated using Trizol as recommended by the manufacturer (Invitrogen). Northern blot analysis utilized 10–20 μg of total cellular RNA separated on 1.5% formaldehyde-agarose gels according to standard procedures. RNA samples were transferred overnight to nylon filter, UV cross-linked (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA), and probed with randomly labeled probe (Amersham Biosciences) corresponding to cytochrome c oxidase II or III or cytochrome B. Hybridization and wash conditions were obtained using Expresshyb (Stratagene) solution as described by the manufacturer. Blots were normalized for equal loading using a cDNA probe for glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase. Studies were initiated in order to analyze the subcellular localization of NF-κB and IκB subunits. Electron microscopy of sections of U937 cells in association with immunocytochemistry indicated the presence of both the p50/NF-κB1 and p65 subunits localized in the inner matrix of the mitochondria as well as in the cytoplasm (see Fig. 1). The control (see “Materials and Methods”) showed no detectable labeling. Additionally, IκBα was detectable in the inner matrix of mitochondria. 2P. Cogswell and A. Baldwin, unpublished results. After observing the presence of the NF-κB p50 and p65 subunits in the mitochondria using electron microscopy, we were interested in confirming the results biochemically. Mitochondria were first isolated from rat liver and subjected to increasing concentrations of digitonin, which functions to elute proteins in a manner dependent on the localization within the mitochondria. Supernatants and mitochondrial pellets at each concentration were analyzed by Western blotting using antibodies to IκBα, p50, or p65. The results show that both IκBα and p50 are present in the rat mitochondria (Fig. 2). With the addition of low concentrations of digitonin, IκBα protein was not detected in the supernatant. The addition of 0.4% digitonin (lane 5) leads to release of IκBα from mitochondria so that it is detected in the supernatant. However, the p50 protein was not visible in the supernatant until 0.5–0.6% digitonin was added (lanes 6 and 7). When these results are plotted against known mitochondrial components, release of p50 from the mitochondria following digitonin treatment corresponds to the release of fumarase,2 a marker for the inner matrix of the mitochondria, whereas IκBα release from the mitochondria occurs earlier, indicating that IκBα localization is closer to the mitochondrial surface and presumably also in the inner matrix. p65 was not detected in the mitochondria of quiescent rat liver (data not shown, but see below regarding cells in culture).Figure 2Localization of p50 and IκBα in the mitochondria of rat liver cells. Mitochondria were isolated from rat liver and incubated with increasing amounts of digitonin. Pellet (P) and supernatant (S) from either untreated sample (lane 1) or samples treated with 0.1–0.8% digitonin (lanes 2–9) were separated on 10% SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose. The membrane was probed with either an anti-p50 or anti-IκBα antibody.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) To further analyze the localization of IκBα and NF-κB in the mitochondria and to determine potential responses to cytokine treatment, U937 cells were studied by Western blotting of mitochondrial and cytoplasmic extracts (Fig. 3). Cells were stimulated with TNFα over a 1-h time course. After separation of cytoplasmic and mitochondrial components, the mitochondrial pellet was resuspended in a volume of buffer equal to one-tenth volume of the cytosolic fraction, consistent with published estimates that mitochondria represent one-tenth the total volume of a human cultured cell (22Posakony J.W. England J.M. Attardi G. J. Cell Biol. 1977; 74: 468-491Google Scholar). Protein assays confirmed that concentrations of the two fractions were approximately equivalent. Assuming that overall protein concentrations are similar in the mitochondria and cytoplasm of living cells, we loaded equal amounts of protein from each fraction in order to observe physiologically comparable levels of each subunit. First, the data support the EM data indicating that p50 and IκBα were localized in the mitochondria. Second, the data indicate that the p65 subunit of NF-κB is located in the mitochondria of U937 cells. Additionally, the data indicate that the mitochondrial p65 exhibits slightly faster migration in SDS gels (e.g. compare the mobility of the mitochondrial p65 with cytoplasmic p65) (Fig. 3), possibly due to a protein processing event associated with mitochondrial import (see Ref.12Scheffler I. Mitochondria. Wiley-Liss, Inc., New York1999: 367-384Google Scholar). The results also show that following TNFα treatment, there is degradation of IκBα by 30 min and resynthesis at 60 min in both the cytoplasm and mitochondria of U937 cells (Fig. 3). The overall kinetics of loss of mitochondrial IκBα is slightly different from what we observe in the cytoplasm. It is noted that a slower migrating form of mitochondrial IκBα is detected following TNFα treatment, suggestive of induced phosphorylation (see below). There appears to be very little change in p65 in either the mitochondria or cytoplasm of these cells following TNFα treatment; however, p50 shows a reduction in the mitochondria following TNFα treatment of cells. To confirm the absence of mitochondrial contamination of the cytoplasmic fractions, the Western blot was probed with a cytochrome c antibody. Other experiments show that there is little or no cytoplasmic contamination of mitochondria and that IκBβ is not found in the mitochondria (see Fig. 5, B and C). Additionally, c-Rel was not detected at appreciable levels in the mitochondria of U937 cells. Identical results were found when using the HT1080 cell line, showing that the localization is not cell type-specific.Figure 5IκBα degradation upon TNF α stimulation is blocked by proteasome-specific inhibitors in the cytoplasm but not in the mitochondria. A, U937 cells were pretreated with either Me2SO (DMSO; lanes 1 and2), lactacystin (lanes 3 and4), calpeptin (lanes 5 and6), or MG132 (lanes 7 and8) for 15 min followed by stimulation with 10 ng/ml of TNFα for 15 min (lanes 2, 4,6, and 8). Mitochondrial (M) and cytoplasmic (C) proteins were isolated and analyzed on 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gels. Blots were first probed with a phospho-IκBα (pIκBα). Blots were stripped and reprobed with an IκBα antibody. B, proteins isolated from untreated U937 cells were analyzed on 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gels. Blots were probed with Lmp-1, Skp-1, and cytochrome cantibodies. C, mitochondrial (M) and cytoplasmic (C) extracts isolated from U937 cells were analyzed on 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gels. Blots were probed with either IκBα, IκBβ, or cytochrome c antibodies.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) To determine whether the NF-κB components in the mitochondria were able to bind DNA, mitochondrial extracts were prepared, and mitochondrial proteins were eluted in nuclear extract buffer. The results from an EMSA show two binding complexes (complexes I and II). The NF-κB DNA binding activity is low in the mitochondria in untreated cells and increases with TNFα treatment, with the strongest binding occurring at the 1-h time point (Fig. 4). To identify which components of NF-κB contribute to this binding activity, supershift analysis was performed on the mitochondrial extract that was treated with TNFα for 1 h. The use of a p50-specific antibody led to a supershifted band from complex II (Fig. 4). However, when a p65-specific antibody was added to the binding reaction, there was a reduction in the DNA binding in complex II without the appearance of a supershifted band. Complex I could not be supershifted with either antibody. These results indicate that p50 is the major NF-κB subunit found in binding complex II, possibly existing as a homodimer. It remains possible that additional NF-κB components may be part of the DNA binding activity. The data also suggest that the presence of p50 and p65 in the mitochondria is presumably not as a heterodimer, possibly suggesting distinct mitochondrial sublocalization for these two NF-κB subunits. The fact that TNFα induced the degradation of IκBα in the mitochondria led us to explore whether IκBα is phosphorylated and degraded in a manner similar to that of cytoplasmic IκBα. First, we asked whether IκBα loss was dependent on a proteasome-mediated mechanism. Cells were pretreated with proteasome and calpain inhibitors and either left untreated or stimulated with TNFα. Mitochondria were purified, and proteins were eluted and analyzed by Western blotting. The results (Fig. 5 A) show that upon treatment of cells with TNFα for 15 min, there is a significant loss of IκBα in both the mitochondrial and the cytoplasmic compartments. This loss in the cytoplasm can be blocked following pretreatment with either lactacystin, a proteasome-specific inhibitor, or with MG132, an inhibitor of both calpain and the proteasome (10Yan Y. Weinman S. Boldogh I. Walker R. Brasier A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 787-794Google Scholar) (Fig. 5 A). When cells were pretreated with calpeptin, an inhibitor specific for calpain (10Yan Y. Weinman S. Boldogh I. Walker R. Brasier A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 787-794Google Scholar), there was a modest inhibition of the degradation of cytoplasmic IκBα but considerably less inhibition than with the other inhibitors. However, in the mitochondrial fraction, lactacystin had very little effect in blocking the degradation of IκBα. Additionally, cells pretreated with calpeptin showed more inhibition of mitochondrial IκBα degradation than lactacystin, unlike the cytoplasm, which showed the opposite effect. However, it is noted that calpeptin was able to inhibit the degradation of IκBα in the mitochondria only partially. When an antibody specific for the phosphorylated form of IκBα (anti-phosphoserine 32) was used to probe the same blot, phosphorylated IκBα was visualized when cells were pretreated with all of the inhibitors in the cytoplasm but only in cells pretreated with calpeptin or MG132 in the mitochondria (Fig. 5 A). Again, these results point to a lack of proteasome effect in the mitochondria. It is not clear whether the degradation of IκBα in the mitochondria is a calpain-specific pathway, since calpeptin does not completely block the degradation. This may be a function of the inhibitor, or there may be other factors involved in this process. Additionally, we cannot rule out that the lack of effect seen in the mitochondria when the cells are pretreated with lactacystin was due to the lack of permeability of the mitochondria to lactacystin. To address whether the proteasome may not be relevant in mitochondrial IκBα degradation, cytoplasmic and mitochondrial extracts were prepared from U937 cells, and Western blotting was performed using antibodies specific for Lmp-2, a functional subunit of the proteasome (23Kingsbury D.J. Griffin T. Colbert R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 24156-24162Google Scholar) and Skp-1, a component of the ubiquitin ligase associated with IκBα ubiquitination (3Maniatis T. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 505-510Google Scholar). The results show that both proteins can only be found in the cytoplasm of U937 cells (Fig. 5 B). Blots were also probed for cytochrome c as a mitochondrial marker. These results further support the possibility that the mitochondria lacks proteasome function. They also confirm that there is no cytoplasmic contamination of the mitochondria preparations. NF-κB is regulated by multiple forms of IκB, including IκBα and IκBβ (1Ghosh S. May M. Kopp E. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1998; 16: 225-260Google Scholar). Mitochondria blots from U937 cells were probed with IκBα and IκBβ antibodies (Fig. 5 C). The results indicate that whereas IκBα is found in both the mitochondria and the cytoplasm, IκBβ is only found in the cytoplasm. Again, cytochrome c was used as a mitochondrial marker. In order to understand the mechanism of the induced phosphorylation of IκBα in the mitochondria in response to TNFα treatment, we explored whether IKK family members were present in or potentially associated with the mitochondria. Western blots of fractions from U937 cells enriched for mitochondria were probed with IKKα-, IKKβ-, and IKKγ-specific antibodies. The results show that all three IKK family members are present in the mitochondrial fraction (Fig. 6 A). Blots were also probed with a cytochrome c antibody as a marker for mitochondria. Based on the phosphorylation on IκBα in the mitochondria and the presence of the IKK family members, we wanted to determine whether functional kinase activity could be detected in the mitochondria fraction. Large scale mitochondria and cytoplasmic extracts were prepared from U937 cells either left untreated or treated with TNFα. The results show that both in the cytoplasm and mitochondrial extracts, low levels of IKK kinase activity were seen in untreated cells (Fig. 6 B). Following stimulation with TNFα, the IκB kinase activity in both the cytoplasm and mitochondria was greatly increased. These results indicate that the IKK family members are associated with the mitochondrial fraction and are potentially responsible for the phosphorylation of IκBα seen there. In order to address a possible function of NF-κB components in the regulation of mitochondrial gene expression, we utilized HT1080 cells either containing an empty vector or expressing the modified form of IκBα known as IκBαSR (15Wang C.-Y. Mayo M. Baldwin A. Science. 1996; 274: 784-787Google Scholar). Interestingly, IκBαSR was shown to be in the mitochondria as well as the cytoplasm through its ability to be recognized by a FLAG tag antibody.2 Importantly, the superrepressor form of IκBα was shown to be resistant to degradation in mitochondria of HT1080 cells in response to TNFα stimulation. HT1080 cells stably transfected with either a vector control or the IκBαSR were treated with TNFα, and RNA was isolated at several time points. The results show that HT1080 vector control cells exhibit a loss of CoxIII mRNA beginning at 1 h following TNFα treatment and continuing through 2 h (Fig. 7). The mRNA returns to near normal level following 4 h of TNFα stimulation. However, when HT1080 cells containing the IκBαSR were treated with TNFα, only a modest change in the CoxIII mRNA was observed. Since cytochrome c oxidase III plays an integral role in complex IV of the electron transport machinery (12Scheffler I. Mitochondria. Wiley-Liss, Inc., New York1999: 367-384Google Scholar), it is expected that the loss of CoxIII would impact changes in ATP and reactive oxygen species. Efforts to address such changes in response to TNF signaling have been hampered by significant differences in ATP and ROI levels between IκBα-expressing cells and vector control cells in the absence of TNF treatment (see “Discussion”). We have explored whether another mRNA, encoded in a region downstream of CoxIII, is also regulated differentially in the HT1080 V and HT1080 I cells. As with CoxIII, we find that CytB mRNA is down-regulated by TNFα in the HT1080 vector cells but not affected in the IκBα-expressing cells. Overall, these results indicate a role for NF-κB in the regulation of specific mitochondrial gene expression. The results presented here demonstrate the localization of certain NF-κB subunits and IκBα to the mitochondria and are consistent with a recent publication showing that IκBα and p65 are found in the mitochondria (14Bottero V. Rossi F. Samson M. Mari M. Hofman P. Peyron J.-F. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 21317-21324Google Scholar). Interestingly, the major components of the NF-κB regulatory pathway are also apparently localized with the mitochondrial fraction, including the IκB kinase subunits IKKα and IKKβ as well as IKKγ. Consistent with this, TNFα treatment of U937 cells leads to the phosphorylation of degradation of the mitochondrially associated IκBα. In contrast with the degradation that occurs in the cytoplasm, the mitochondrial degradation of IκBα appears to be proteasome-independent, since a specific inhibitor of the proteasome (lactacystin) does not block degradation and because key components of the proteasome and ubiquitin ligase associated with IκBα ubiquitination are not found in the mitochondria. The use of inhibitors suggests that calpain may be partly involved with IκBα degradation in the mitochondria. The DNA binding assay indicates that an NF-κB complex containing p50, possibly as a homodimer, is released from IκBα and is capable of binding to DNA following TNFα stimulation. This response is correlated with the loss of CoxIII and CytB mRNAs following TNFα treatment. The involvement of NF-κB in this process is suggested by the use of the superrepressor form of IκBα, which inhibits the loss of CoxIII mRNA. The data raise many questions about the functions of NF-κB in the mitochondria. Although great efforts were made to ensure the purity of the mitochondrial preparations, we cannot rule out the possibility of small amounts of contamination from other cellular organelles. We performed electron microscopy on our mitochondrial preparations and found that they were ∼95% pure mitochondria. The other 5% of the preparation consisted of membranous debris, which may include Golgi, plasma membrane, and endoplasmic reticulum. Western blots were also performed on these preparations using various organelle markers, confirming that the mitochondrial preparations were highly purified. We did see some staining for endoplasmic reticulum in our mitochondrial fractions; however, the percentage of nonmitochondrial membrane in our preparations was low enough that we feel it did not contribute significantly to the protein content of the preparations. In addition, lack of endoplasmic reticulum staining of p65 or IκBα in the electron micrographs further supports the conclusion that NF-κB staining in our fractions is mitochondrial. One obvious question is the potential mechanism whereby NF-κB regulates CoxIII and CytB mRNA levels. One can envision at least four mechanisms. One mechanism may be that NF-κB, possibly as a p50 homodimer, inhibits the processing of the RNA precursor at a level inhibiting CoxIII and CytB mRNA release. In this model, the release of mitochondrial p50 from IκBα may lead to an interaction with the precursor RNA and an inhibition of processing. Another mechanism could be that binding of NF-κB to mitochondrial DNA inhibits a transcriptional mechanism, possibly elongation, again somehow affecting CoxIII and CytB mRNA production. Another possibility is that p50 in association with IκBα serves as a positive mechanism in regulating CoxIII and CytB mRNA but that dissociation of the p50 and IκBα complex following TNF treatment leads to a loss of this control. Finally, we cannot rule out that a nuclear gene or genes regulated by NF-κB encode proteins that regulate specific mitochondrial mRNA accumulation. Obviously, more complex experimentation will be required to determine how NF-κB may regulate mitochondrial gene expression and whether other transcripts may be positively or negatively controlled by NF-κB. Along these lines, it is presently unclear whether p50 and IκBα are complexed in the mitochondria and whether the detection of p65 in the mitochondria is due to an interaction with p50 or IκBα. The recent paper from Bottero et al. (14Bottero V. Rossi F. Samson M. Mari M. Hofman P. Peyron J.-F. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 21317-21324Google Scholar) indicates that p65 and IκBα are associated in mitochondrial extracts. Western blotting did not reveal significant levels of other NF-κB subunits in the mitochondria of U937 cells (data not shown). Another interesting question is how mitochondrial IκBα becomes phosphorylated and how mitochondrial or mitochondria-associated IKK becomes activated in response to TNF signaling (Fig. 6 B). For cytoplasmic IKK, one current model is that IKK is recruited to factors associated with cytokine receptors, such as the TNF receptor (24Devin A. Lin Y. Yamaoka S., Li, Z. Karin M. Liu Z. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 21: 3986-3994Google Scholar), and becomes activated to phosphorylate IκBα or IκBβ. Presumably, rapid activation of mitochondrially associated IKK must occur by a distinct mechanism that is somehow dependent on TNF binding to its receptor on the membrane. The nature of the signal linking cell surface TNF binding to its receptor and the activation of the mitochondrial or mitochondria-associated IKK is unclear. We cannot rule out the possibility that the mitochondrial IκBα becomes phosphorylated by a kinase distinct from IKK or becomes phosphorylated in the cytoplasm and is transported into the mitochondria. The localization of NF-κB to the mitochondria raises interesting questions concerning a potential role in regulating apoptosis. NF-κB activation in response to TNF signaling has been shown to inhibit apoptosis. Thus, it has been shown that NF-κB activates several gene products (namely Bcl-xL, A1/Bfl-2, IAP proteins, TRAF proteins, etc.) to inhibit the caspase cascade and to block cytochromec release from mitochondria (4Baldwin A. J. Clin. Inv. 2001; 107: 3-6Google Scholar, 6Baldwin A. J. Clin. Inv. 2001; 107: 241-246Google Scholar). It is interesting to speculate that mitochondrial NF-κB may play a role in the suppression of apoptosis. As described above, it is predicted that modulation of CoxIII mRNA may ultimately impact ATP production, which is required for apoptosis induced by TNF. Along these lines, Bottero et al. (14Bottero V. Rossi F. Samson M. Mari M. Hofman P. Peyron J.-F. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 21317-21324Google Scholar) provide evidence that mitochondrial IκBα interacts with ANT, the adenine nucleotide transporter, which has been speculated to be involved with apoptosis through its ability to regulate the mitochondrial permeability transition (see Ref. 14Bottero V. Rossi F. Samson M. Mari M. Hofman P. Peyron J.-F. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 21317-21324Google Scholar). Additionally, we have observed that expression of superrepressor IκBα in cells alters basal levels of ATP (data not shown). Future studies will address mechanisms whereby mitochondrial NF-κB may control cell death mechanisms. NF-κB is not the first nuclear encoded transcription factor to be localized to the mitochondria. Interestingly, the glucocorticoid receptor has been found in the mitochondria (25Scheller K. Sekeris C. Krohne G. Hock R. Hansen I. Scherer U. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 79: 299-307Google Scholar). Potentially important are observations that glucocorticoid receptor can physically interact with NF-κB subunits (26Tao Y. Williams-Skipp C. Scheinman R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 2329-2332Google Scholar); thus, NF-κB/glucocorticoid receptor interactions in the mitochondria may function to regulate key processes involved in cell growth and apoptsosis. Experiments addressing these issues may reveal novel regulatory mechanisms associated with mitochondrial function.

Cell Sci. 1991; 98: 303-307PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, O-GlcNAc-modified proteins are phosphoproteins as well, often belonging to large multimeric and reversible protein complexes. Indeed, in many cases, the sites ofO-GlcNAc modification are either the same or adjacent to those modified by O-phosphate (15Hart G.W. Greis K.D. Dong L.Y. Blomberg M.A. Chou T.Y. Jiang M.S. Roquemore E.P. Snow D.M. Kreppel L.K. Cole R.N. et al.Adv. Exp. Med. Biol. 1995; 376: 115-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). Thus, there is mounting evidence supporting the hypothesis that O-GlcNAc is a regulatory modification analogous to phosphorylation. For example, the transcription factor Sp1 is extensively modified byO-GlcNAc, and it has been shown that the presence of the sugar in the transactivation domain inhibits its homomultimerization and transcriptional capability (4Jackson S.P. Tjian R. Cell. 1988; 55: 125-133Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (649) Google Scholar, 5Jackson S.P. Tjian R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

O-GlcNAc modification of p67 regulates protein synthesis by controlling the phosphorylation status of eukaryotic initiation factor-2α (17Chakraborty A. Saha D. Bose A. Chatterjee M. Gupta N.K.

Chem. 1989; 264: 20620-20624Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In cases where the sites of modification of O-GlcNAc andO-phosphate are the same, a reciprocal relationship between the two modifications has been suggested (19Cheng X. Hart G.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 10570-10575Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar, 20Chou T.-Y. Hart G.W. Dang C.V. J. Biol.

Enzymes that cycle the O-GlcNAc modification are analogous to those that catalyze phosphorylation (i.e. kinases and phosphatases). The enzyme that attaches the saccharide to proteins is uridine diphospho-N-acetylglucosamine:polypeptide β-N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase, or O-GlcNAc transferase (OGT), and its counterpart is aO-GlcNAc-specific β-N-acetylglucosaminidase known as the O-GlcNAcase. Both of these enzymes have been purified and characterized (21Haltiwanger R.S. Blomberg M.A. Hart G.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 9005-9013Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 22Dong L.-Y.

The OGT is a highly unique and ubiquitous glycosyltransferase, encoded by a single gene. OGT is highly conserved throughout evolution from C. elegans to humans. The gene for OGT has been mapped to the X chromosome (Xq13 in humans) (27Shafi R. Iyer S.P. Ellies L.G. O'Donnell N. Marek K.W. Chui D. Hart G.W. Marth J.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Targeted deletion of the OGT gene results in ES cell lethality in mice (27Shafi R. Iyer S.P. Ellies L.G. O'Donnell N. Marek K.W. Chui D. Hart G.W. Marth J.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 5735-5739Crossref PubMed Scopus (589) Google Scholar). Thus, OGT is essential for life at the single cell level. OGT localizes to both the nucleus and cytoplasm of cells, but it is present at higher levels in the nucleus (25Kreppel L.K. Blomberg M.A. Hart G.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 9308-9315Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (601) Google Scholar). Aside from being tyrosine-phosphorylated and O-GlcNAc-modified, the rat 110-kDa OGT enzyme contains 11½ tetratricopeptide repeats (TPRs), a protein-protein interaction domain found in many proteins (25Kreppel L.K. Blomberg M.A. Hart G.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 9308-9315Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (601) Google Scholar, 29Goebl M. Yanagida M. Trends Biochem.

Sci. 1995; 20: 257-259Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (548) Google Scholar). TPRs have been shown to mediate protein-protein interactions in a variety of proteins (37Tzamarias D. Struhl K. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 821-831Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar). Recently, the crystal structure of the TPR domain of two of these proteins, protein phosphatase 5 (31Das A.K. Cohen P.W. Barford D. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 1192-1199Crossref PubMed Scopus (708) Google Scholar) and Pex5p (32Gatto Jr., G.J. Geisbrecht B.V. Gould S.J. Berg J.M. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 7: 1091-1095Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar), were solved. OGT exists as a homotrimer, and the TPR domain was shown to mediate the trimerization (33Kreppel L.K. Hart G.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 32015-32023Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (334) Google Scholar). Studies performed on recombinant OGT overexpressed and purified in baculovirus (33Kreppel L.K. Hart G.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 32015-32023Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (334) Google Scholar) and Escherichia coli (13Lubas W.A. Hanover J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 10983-10988Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar) have shown that the TPR domain plays a key role in intrasubunit interaction and in substrate recognition. Unlike the large numbers of genes encoding kinases, thus far, there is evidence for only a single OGT catalytic subunit despite the myriad of different O-GlcNAc-modified proteins (1Hart G.W. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1997; 66: 315-335Crossref PubMed Scopus (449) Google Scholar). Virtually nothing is known about the regulation of OGT's subcellular localization or substrate specificity. The presence of multiple TPR repeats implies that proteins might specifically interact with the enzyme, targeting the catalytic domain to specific protein substrates within the nucleus and cytoplasm. To examine this hypothesis, we screened a rat brain library with OGT using the yeast two-hybrid approach, in order to begin to identify potential OGT-interacting proteins (OIPs). Initially, 250 positively interacting clones were identified. Here, we report the cloning and characterization of GRIF-1, a recently cloned GABAA receptor-associated protein, and its novel homolog KIAA1042/OIP106 as novel coiled-coil domain proteins that interact strongly with the TPR domain of OGT. Our findings suggest that these proteins possibly function to target OGT to RNA polymerase II and GABAA receptor complexes to mediate transcriptional and signaling events. The OGT-Gal4 BD fusion bait plasmid pJL59-OGT was generated by inserting the rat OGT cDNA into pJL59. The negative control pJL59-C-termOGT plasmid was generated by inserting the C terminus (residues 476–1037) of OGT. The plasmids encoding the full-length OGT, C-termOGT, and TPR domain forE. coli expression were generated by subcloning the respective cDNAs into pET32 (Novagen) as thioredoxin fusion proteins. Constructs encoding for an N-terminal hexa-His-tagged TPR and C-termOGT fusion proteins (pRSET-TPR and pRSET-C, respectively) were generated by subcloning the TPR and C-termOGT fragments into the pRSET vector (Invitrogen). The pACT2 plasmid encoding the partial rat OIP98 (AD-OIP98) clone (residues 105–878) fused to the activation domain of Gal4 was obtained from the initial yeast two-hybrid screen as a result of plasmid rescue. Full-length rat OIP98 was generated by performing 5′-rapid amplification of cDNA ends using the rat brain Marathon-Ready cDNA library (Clontech) and by assembling the 5′-rapid amplification of cDNA ends product with the preexisting insert derived from the yeast two-hybrid screen using overlapping restriction sites. OIP98 is a partial clone of GRIF-1, lacking exon 15. The missing exon was obtained by using a QuickClone rat brain cDNA library (Clontech) as template and GRIF-1 gene-specific primers flanking exon 15 in a PCR and inserted into the OIP98 cDNA using overlapping restriction sites. An E. coli expression plasmid of rat GRIF-1 (OIP98) was generated by subcloning the cDNA insert into pET32. Plasmids for in vitro transcription/translation reactions and mammalian overexpression were generated by subcloning the GRIF-1 cDNA into pCITE4c (Novagen) and pcDNA3.1 His A (Invitrogen), respectively. The insert encoding KIAA1042/OIP106 cDNA was obtained from Dr. Takahiro Nagase from the Kazusa DNA Research Institute (Chiba, Japan) in pBluescript II SK+. The insert was then used as template to generate a cassette via PCR. This cassette was then subcloned into pCITE5b and pcDNA3.1 His B (Invitrogen) for use in in vitro transcription/translation reactions and mammalian expression. Finally, pCITE-p62 was constructed by subcloning the cDNA encoding rat nucleoporin p62 (48Starr C.M. Hanover J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 6868-6873Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) into pCITE4c. The fidelity of all DNA constructs was verified by nucleotide sequencing. The Matchmaker rat brain library in pACT2 (prey vector with Gal4 activation domain) (Clontech) was used to isolate interacting clones, according to the manufacturer's instructions. Screening was performed on SD/−Leu/−Trp/−His/−Ade plates in the presence of 10 mm 3-aminotriazole, in yeast strain PJ69-4A. Three rounds of screening were performed, resulting in about 250 final positive clones. 80 of the resulting positives were screened for the presence of the AD fusion inserts using pACT2-specific primers via a yeast colony PCR approach as described (34Clontech Laboratories, Inc. Clontech: Yeast Protocols Handbook. Clontech Laboratories, Inc., Palo Alto, CA1999Google Scholar). Nine inserts greater than 2 kb were selected for DNA sequencing, and selected plasmid DNAs were recovered by performing yeast plasmid preparations as described previously (34Clontech Laboratories, Inc. Clontech: Yeast Protocols Handbook. Clontech Laboratories, Inc., Palo Alto, CA1999Google Scholar). Finally, confirmation of the originally observed interactions was performed by retransforming yeast with pJL59-OGT bait or empty pJL59 and pACT2-prey or empty pACT2 vectors and plated on SD/−Leu/−Trp/−His/−Ade plates containing 30 mm3-aminotriazole. The carboxyl terminus of OGT fused to the BD of Gal4 was used as the negative control bait vector. Liquid β-galactosidase assays were performed as described (34Clontech Laboratories, Inc. Clontech: Yeast Protocols Handbook. Clontech Laboratories, Inc., Palo Alto, CA1999Google Scholar). The E. colistrain BL21 (DE3) codon plus RIL strain (Stratagene) was used for the overexpression of OGT and GRIF-1 (OIP98) protein constructs in either LB or double yeast tryptone-ampicillin. Unless indicated otherwise, all purified proteins were desalted in 20 mm Tris, pH 7.8, 20–40% (v/v) glycerol (v/v), 0.02% (w/v) sodium azide and stored at −20 °C. Recombinant hexa-His-tagged thioredoxin-OGT, C-termOGT, and GRIF-1 (OIP98) fusion protein expression was induced by the addition of isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside for 4 h at 37 °C. Cells were harvested, and His-tagged proteins were purified under denaturing conditions via nickel affinity chromatography using HiTrap chelating columns (Amersham Biosciences) according to the manufacturer's instructions. His-tagged C-termOGT(pRSET-C) was expressed and purified in a similar manner for use as an antigen to raise anti-OGT polyclonal antibodies generated in rabbits. Soluble thioredoxin-tagged TPR (pET32-TPR) was overexpressed and purified under native, nondenaturing conditions via nickel affinity chromatography. Equal amounts of E. coliexpressed recombinant OGT, TPR, and C-termOGT and BSA proteins were separated on SDS-PAGE and blotted on polyvinylidene difluoride membranes. Proteins were renatured en blot in renaturation buffer (50 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 100 mm potassium acetate, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EDTA, 0.1% (v/v) Tween 20, 0.1 mmZnCl2, 5% milk (w/v), and 0.1 m Met) at 4 °C. [35S]Met-labeled GRIF-1 and OIP106 probes were synthesized in vitro using the TnT coupled reticulocyte lysate system (Promega) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Reactions were desalted and added to 15 ml of cold renaturation buffer and used to probe the blots containing the immobilized proteins at 4 °C. Following probing, the blots were washed extensively with renaturation buffer, dried, and subjected to autoradiography by exposure to Biomax MR film (Eastman Kodak Co.) at −80 °C. Typical exposure times were 8–24 h. Rabbit and chicken antiserum to GRIF-1 and OIP106 were generated by immunizing rabbits and chickens with recombinant His-tagged GRIF-1 (OIP98) purified as described above. Gel-purified protein was used as an immunogen by Covance Research Products (Denver, PA) to produce polyclonal antisera in one rabbit designated as JH 3286. In a similar manner, chickens were immunized by Aves Laboratories (Tigard, OR) to produce chicken IgY antibodies. Affinity-purified antibodies were generated by purifying JH 3286 antiserum or chicken IgY over a GRIF-1 (OIP98) affinity column as previously described (36Harlow E. Lane D. Antibodies: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1988Google Scholar). KIAA1042/OIP106-specific polyclonal antibodies were generated by immunizing one rabbit designated as SAI1 with a peptide containing the first 20 amino acids of the N terminus (N20) of KIAA1042. This region is specific and unique to KIAA1042. Affinity-purified antibodies were generated by purifying SAI1 antiserum over an N20 peptide affinity column as previously described (36Harlow E. Lane D. Antibodies: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1988Google Scholar). The anti-OGT antibody AL28 was generated in a similar manner by using His-tagged C-termOGT protein to immunize two rabbits designated AL28 and AL29. AL28 antiserum was affinity-purified over a thioredoxin-C-termOGT (pET32-C) column as previously described (36Harlow E. Lane D. Antibodies: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1988Google Scholar). AL28 was used at a final concentration of 25–50 ng/ml in 5% (w/v) milk in Tris-buffered saline containing 0.05% (v/v) Tween 20 for 16 h at 4 °C. Similarly, JH 3286 was used at a final concentration of 100 ng/ml. Chicken anti-OIP106/GRIF-1 was used at a final concentration of 0.5–1 μg/ml. S-protein HRP conjugate (Novagen) was used at 1:5000 according to the manufacturer's instructions. Anti-actin (Sigma) and anti-Rb p107 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.) antibodies were used at 1:5000. 8WG16 mouse monoclonal antibodies to hypophosphorylated RNA polymerase II (Neoclone) and anti-tubulin (Sigma) were used at 1:10,000. Mouse Omniprobe anti-Xpress antibody (d-8; Santa Cruz Biotechnology) was used at 1:2000, and anti-O-GlcNAc CTD 110.6 mouse monoclonal antibody was used at 1:2500 as described before, either in the absence or presence of 50 mm GlcNAc (51Comer F.I. Vosseller K. Wells L. Accavitti M.A. Hart G.W. Anal. Biochem. 2001; 293: 169-177Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). All blots were developed with the enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) reagent (Amersham Biosciences). HeLa and HEK 293 cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum containing 0.1 mm nonessential amino acids, penicillin, and streptomycin. For preparation of whole tissue extracts, frozen tissue from male Sprague-Dawley rats were homogenized in ice-cold radioimmune precipitation assay lysis buffer (PBS, 0.1% SDS, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate) containing protease inhibitors, and soluble crude extracts were generated by spinning the homogenate at 100,000 × gfor 90 min at 4 °C. Extracts were assayed for protein concentration via the Bio-Rad protein assay reagent, and equal amounts of each tissue extract were separated on SDS-PAGE for JH 3286 Western blot analysis. HeLa whole cell lysate was prepared in a similar manner. For analysis of human cell line extracts, Cruz-Blot B was purchased (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and analyzed with SAI1 and α-tubulin antibodies. For immunoprecipitation experiments, frozen rat brains were homogenized in Hepes-buffered saline (HBS) containing 20 mm Hepes pH 7.4, 0.3 m NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm NaF, 100 mm GlcNAc, and protease inhibitors using a Polytron homogenizer. The homogenate was then centrifuged at 100 000 × g for 90 min at 4 °C to generate soluble crude brain extract and stored at −80 °C. Fractionation of nuclear and cytoplasmic extracts from HeLa cells was performed as described (38Schreiber E. Matthias P. Muller M.M. Schaffner W. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 6419Crossref PubMed Scopus (3912) Google Scholar). HeLa cells were fixed in 4% (v/v) formaldehyde in PBS (pH 7.3) for 1 h at 4 °C, permeabilized with 0.5%(v/v) Triton X-100 in PBS for 5 min and treated with 5% (w/v) BSA in PBS for 10 min. The specimens were then incubated with the anti-OIP106 antibody (JH 3286) (dilution, 1:200) or with pre-immune rabbit IgG for 1 h at room temperature, washed with PBS, and subsequently incubated for 1 h with Cy3-conjugated donkey anti-rabbit IgG antibody (dilution, 1:500) (Jackson Immunoresearch). Specimens were then incubated with the mouse monoclonal anti-hypophosphorylated RNA polymerase II (dilution, 1:1000) antibody 8WG16 (Neoclone) for 1 h at room temperature, washed with PBS, and incubated for 1 h with fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated donkey anti mouse IgG (Jackson Immunoresearch). After a wash with PBS, the specimens were mounted in 90% (v/v) glycerol, 0.1 m Tris buffer (pH 8.5) containing 0.5 mm p-phenylene diamine and observed under laser-scanning confocal microscope (MRC-1024; Bio-Rad). Electron microscopy was performed as previously described (47Akimoto Y. Kreppel L.K. Hirano H. Hart G.W. Diabetes. 1999; 48: 2407-2413Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar), using a JEM-1010 electron microscope (JEOL, Tokyo, Japan), using the above dilutions for JH 3286 and 8WG16. Crude rat brain extract was filtered through a 0.22-μm syringe filter and was precleared by anti-IgY-agarose (Promega). Precleared extract was incubated with either 2 μg of preimmune chicken IgY or anti-OIP106/GRIF-1 IgY to immunoprecipitate native OIP106 and GRIF-1 16 h at 4 °C. OIP106/GRIF-1 immune complexes were collected by incubation with anti-IgY-agarose for 1 h at 4 °C. The beads were extensively washed in cold HBS extract buffer, and bound proteins were eluted with SDS-PAGE sample buffer. Samples were boiled, separated by SDS-PAGE, and analyzed by Western blotting with either rabbit anti-OIP106/GRIF-1 antibody JH 3286 or rabbit anti-OGT antibody AL28. Similarly, for OGT immunoprecipitations, crude rat brain extract was incubated with AL28 in HBS (0.3 m NaCl) or radioimmune precipitation assay lysis buffer for 16 h at 4 °C. Immune complexes were collected by incubation with protein A-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences), and bound proteins were eluted with SDS-PAGE sample buffer, followed by analysis by Western blotting. HEK 293 cell immunoprecipitations were performed by lysing transfected cells in HBS (0.3 m NaCl) buffer containing 0.5% (v/v) Triton X-100 and 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride for 30 min at 4 °C. Whole cell extracts were generated by centrifuging the lysates at 16,000 × g at 4 °C for 10 min. Precleared extracts were incubated with anti-Xpress Omniprobed-8 antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and protein A/G plus agarose (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) to immunoprecipitate recombinant Xpress-tagged OIP106 and GRIF-1 for 3 h at 4 °C. Immunoprecipitates were washed extensively in lysis buffer and eluted with SDS-PAGE sample buffer, followed by Western blotting with Omniprobe d-8, anti-OGT AL28, and CTD 110.6 antibodies. Immunoprecipitations from TnT rabbit reticulocyte lysates expressing Xpress-tagged OIP106 and GRIF-1 were performed with Omniprobed-8 antibody in a similar manner as described above. For HeLa nuclear extract immunoprecipitations, 5 μg of either preimmune chicken IgY or anti-OIP106/GRIF-1 IgY bound to anti-IgY-agarose were incubated with 330 μg of precleared HeLa nuclear extract in 20 mm Hepes, pH 7.9, 300 mmNaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 10 mm MgCl2, 20 μm O-(2-acetamido-2-deoxy-d-glucopyranosylidene)amino-N-phenylcarbamate, 0.1% (v/v) Triton X-100 overnight at 4 °C to immunoprecipitate native OIP106. OIP106 immune complexes were washed extensively with binding buffer containing 0.2% (v/v) Triton X-100, and bound proteins were eluted by boiling in SDS-PAGE sample buffer, followed by Western blot analysis with JH 3286, 8WG16, AL28, and anti-Rb p107 antibodies. For OIP106/GRIF-1 pull-down experiments, S-tagged OIP106 and GRIF-1 were synthesized in TnT rabbit reticulocyte lysates (Promega). Following synthesis, lysates were incubated with S-protein-agarose to purify S-tagged OIP106 and GRIF-1 for 3 h at room temperature in HBS (0.3 m NaCl) lysis buffer containing 0.5% (v/v) Triton X-100. Pull-downs were washed extensively in lysis buffer, and bound proteins were eluted with SDS-PAGE sample buffer and analyzed by silver staining. For the p62 and OIP106-AL28 pull-down assays, S-tagged p62 and OIP106 were synthesized in TnT rabbit reticulocyte lysates. Following synthesis, proteins were incubated with preimmune or AL28 in Tris-buffered saline containing 0.5 m NaCl and 0.1% (v/v) Triton X-100 at 4 °C. Immune complexes were collected by incubating the reactions with protein A-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences). Beads containing the immune complexes were washed extensively with binding buffer, and bound proteins were eluted by boiling in SDS-PAGE sample buffer. Samples were then analyzed with S-protein HRP and AL28 Western blots. OIP106 and GRIF-1 were expressed in vitro in rabbit reticulocyte lysates using the TnT in vitro transcription/translation system (Promega) from either pcDNA 3.1 His or pCITE vectors. For HEK 293 cell transfections, 4 μg each of OIP106 and GRIF-1 in their respective pcDNA 3.1 His vectors were transfected using LipofectAMINE 2000 and expressed as"
https://openalex.org/W2081598019,"Presenilins (PS1/PS2) play a critical role in proteolysis of beta-amyloid precursor protein (beta APP) to generate beta-amyloid, a peptide important in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease. Nevertheless, several regulatory functions of PS1 have also been reported. Here we demonstrate, in neuroblastoma cells, that PS1 regulates the biogenesis of beta APP-containing vesicles from the trans-Golgi network and the endoplasmic reticulum. PS1 deficiency or the expression of loss-of-function variants leads to robust vesicle formation, concomitant with increased maturation and/or cell surface accumulation of beta APP. In contrast, release of vesicles containing beta APP is impaired in familial Alzheimer's disease (FAD)-linked PS1 mutant cells, resulting in reduced beta APP delivery to the cell surface. Moreover, diminution of surface beta APP is profound at axonal terminals in neurons expressing a PS1 FAD variant. These results suggest that PS1 regulation of beta APP trafficking may represent an alternative mechanism by which FAD-linked PS1 variants modulate beta APP processing."

Rather than arguing for or against race, or proposing a substitute such as genetic markers or ethnicity, the paper asks researchers to carefully consider for what purpose they are using race, to define and use the term consistently, and to be aware that race is not a fixed biological entity, but only one way among many to describe human variation."
https://openalex.org/W2030177943,"We identified a novel human chondroitinN-acetylgalactosaminyltransferase, designated chondroitin GalNAcT-2 after a BLAST analysis of the GenBankTM data base using the sequence of a previously described human chondroitinN-acetylgalactosaminyltransferase (chondroitin GalNAcT-1) as a probe. The new cDNA sequence contained an open reading frame encoding a protein of 542 amino acids with a type II transmembrane protein topology. The amino acid sequence displayed 60% identity to that of human chondroitin GalNAcT-1. Like chondroitin GalNAcT-1, the expression of a soluble form of the protein in COS-1 cells produced an active enzyme, which not only transferred β1,4-N-acetylgalactosamine (GalNAc) from UDP-[3H]GalNAc to a polymer chondroitin representing growing chondroitin chains (β-GalNAc transferase II activity) but also to GlcUAβ1–3Galβ1-O-C2H4NHCbz, a synthetic substrate for β-GalNAc transferase I that transfers the first GalNAc to the core tetrasaccharide in the protein-linkage region of chondroitin sulfate. In contrast, the tetrasaccharide serine (GlcUAβ1–3Galβ1–3Galβ1–4Xylβ1-O-Ser) derived from the linkage region, which is an inert acceptor substrate for chondroitin GalNAcT-1, served as an acceptor substrate. The coding region of this enzyme was divided into seven discrete exons, which is similar to the genomic organization of the chondroitin GalNAcT-1 gene, and was localized to chromosome 10q11.22. Northern blot analysis revealed that the chondroitin GalNAcT-2 gene exhibited a ubiquitous but differing expression in human tissues, and the expression pattern differed from that of chondroitin GalNAcT-1. Thus, we demonstrated redundancy in the chondroitin GalNAc transferases involved in the biosynthetic initiation and elongation of chondroitin sulfate, which is important for understanding the biosynthetic mechanisms leading to the selective chain assembly of chondroitin/dermatan sulfate on the linkage region tetrasaccharide common to various proteoglycans containing chondroitin/dermatan sulfate and heparin/heparan sulfate chains.

Most if not all vertebrate cells produce chondroitin sulfate proteoglycans to a variable extent as major components of the connective tissue matrix, and they are also found at the surface of many cell types. GAGs play fundamental roles in growth factor signaling, cellular differentiation, morphogenesis, and pathophysiology (for reviews see Refs. 1Kjellén L. Lindahl U. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1991; 60: 443-475Google Scholar, 2Salmivirta M. Lidholt K. Lindahl U. FASEB J. 1996; 10: 1270-1279Google Scholar, 3Perrimon N. Bernfield M. Nature. 2000; 404: 725-728Google Scholar). Recent studies of chondroitin/dermatan sulfate chains have shown that they play important roles in neural network formation in the developing mammalian brain (for reviews see Refs. 4Ohhira A. Matsui F. Tokita Y. Yamauchi S. Aono S. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2000; 374: 24-34Google Scholar and 5Sugahara K. Yamada S. Trends Glycosci. Glycotechnol. 2000; 12: 321-349Google Scholar) and are major inhibitory molecules affecting axon growth after spinal cord injury in the central nervous system of adult mammals (6Bradbury E.J. Moon L.D.F. Popat R.J. King V.R. Bennett G.S. Patel P.N. Fawcett J.W. McMahon S.B. Nature. 2002; 416: 636-640Google Scholar). Although GAGs are ubiquitously expressed, they exist in discrete structural forms generated by varying patterns of sulfation and epimerization, which may account for the functional specificity of tissue-derived proteoglycans. Both chondroitin/dermatan sulfate and heparin/heparan sulfate are produced on the so-called GAG protein linkage region (GlcUAβ1–3Galβ1–3Galβ1–4Xylβ1-O attached to specific Ser residues of core proteins) common to GAGs (for reviews, see Refs. 7Lindahl U. Rodén L. Gottschalk A. Glycoproteins. Elsevier, New York1972: 491-517Google Scholar and 8Rodén L. Lennarz W.J. The Biochemistry of Glycoproteins and Proteoglycans. Plenum Publishing, New York1980: 267-371Google Scholar). Synthesis of this region is initiated by the addition of Xyl to Ser, followed by the addition of two Gal residues, and completed by the addition of GlcUA; each reaction is catalyzed by a specific glycosyltransferase (7Lindahl U. Rodén L. Gottschalk A. Glycoproteins. Elsevier, New York1972: 491-517Google Scholar, 8Rodén L. Lennarz W.J. The Biochemistry of Glycoproteins and Proteoglycans. Plenum Publishing, New York1980: 267-371Google Scholar). The GAGs are built up on this linkage region tetrasaccharide by the alternate addition ofN-acetylhexosamine and GlcUA residues. Chondroitin/dermatan sulfate is synthesized once GalNAc is transferred to the common linkage region, whereas heparin/heparan sulfate is formed if GlcNAc is added first. Therefore, the first hexosamine transfer is critical in determining whether chondroitin/dermatan sulfate or heparin/heparan sulfate chains are selectively assembled on the common linkage region. Although such mechanisms have long been proposed based on data from conventional structural and enzymological studies (8Rodén L. Lennarz W.J. The Biochemistry of Glycoproteins and Proteoglycans. Plenum Publishing, New York1980: 267-371Google Scholar), the molecular mechanisms underlying the selective chain assembly of different GAG chains have not been clarified. Recent cDNA cloning of GAG glycosyltransferases has led to unexpected developments (for reviews see Refs. 9Sugahara K. Kitagawa H. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2000; 10: 518-527Google Scholar, 10Sugahara K. Kitagawa H. IUBMB Life. 2002; 54: 163-175Google Scholar, 11Silbert J.E. Sugumaran G. IUBMB Life. 2002; 54: 177-186Google Scholar), providing several important clues to help determine the molecular mechanisms of the biosynthetic sorting of chondroitin/dermatan sulfate and heparin/heparan sulfate chains, as well as the mechanisms of chain elongation and polymerization of these GAGs. The glycosyltransferases responsible for heparin/heparan sulfate biosynthesis are encoded by theEXT gene family, the hereditary multiple exostoses gene family of tumor suppressors (9Sugahara K. Kitagawa H. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2000; 10: 518-527Google Scholar, 10Sugahara K. Kitagawa H. IUBMB Life. 2002; 54: 163-175Google Scholar). The EXT gene family has five members. EXT1 and EXT2 encode heparan sulfate copolymerases, which catalyze the alternate addition of GlcNAc and GlcUA residues (12Lind T. Tufaro F. McCormick C. Lindahl U. Lidholt K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 26265-26268Google Scholar, 13McCormick C. Duncan G. Goutsos K.T. Tufaro F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 668-673Google Scholar, 14Senay C. Lind T. Muguruma K. Tone Y. Kitagawa H. Sugahara K. Lidholt K. Lindahl U. Kusche-Gullberg M. EMBO Rep. 2000; 1: 282-286Google Scholar), whereas EXTL1, EXTL2, andEXTL3, called EXT-like genes, are highly homologous to EXT1 and EXT2 (9Sugahara K. Kitagawa H. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2000; 10: 518-527Google Scholar, 10Sugahara K. Kitagawa H. IUBMB Life. 2002; 54: 163-175Google Scholar). The human EXTL1 protein is a GlcNAc transferase II involved in elongation of the heparan sulfate chain (15Kim B.-T. Kitagawa H. Tamura J. Saito T. Kusche-Gullberg M. Lindahl U. Sugahara K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 7176-7181Google Scholar); the human EXTL2 protein is a GlcNAc transferase I (16Kitagawa H. Shimakawa H. Sugahara K. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 13933-13937Google Scholar) that determines and initiates the synthesis of heparan sulfate on the common GAG-protein linkage region (17Fritz T.A. Gabb M.M. Wei G. Esko J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 28809-28814Google Scholar); and the human EXTL3 protein exhibits both GlcNAc transferase I and II activities (15Kim B.-T. Kitagawa H. Tamura J. Saito T. Kusche-Gullberg M. Lindahl U. Sugahara K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 7176-7181Google Scholar). Three homologous glycosyltransferases responsible for chondroitin/dermatan sulfate biosynthesis have been cloned (18Kitagawa H. Uyama T. Sugahara K. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 38721-38726Google Scholar, 19Uyama T. Kitagawa H. Tamura J. Sugahara K. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 8841-8846Google Scholar, 20Gotoh M. Sato T. Akashima T. Iwasaki H. Kameyama A.

Sato T. Akashima T. Iwasaki H. Mochizuki H. Inaba N. Togayachi A. Kudo T. Watanabe H. Kimata K. Narimatsu H. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 38179-38188Google Scholar). The first chondroitin glycosyltransferase cloned was chondroitin synthase consisting of a single large polypeptide with dual glycosyltransferase activities of GlcUA transferase II (GlcAT-II) and GalNAc transferase II (GalNAcT-II) that is responsible for synthesizing the repeating disaccharide units of chondroitin sulfate (18Kitagawa H. Uyama T. Sugahara K. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 38721-38726Google Scholar). Chondroitin GalNAcT-1, the second chondroitin glycosyltransferase cloned, exhibits GalNAcT-II activity for chain elongation and GalNAc transferase I (GalNAcT-I) activity that determines and initiates the synthesis of chondroitin sulfate on the common GAG-protein linkage region (19Uyama T. Kitagawa H. Tamura J. Sugahara K. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 8841-8846Google Scholar, 20Gotoh M. Sato T. Akashima T. Iwasaki H. Kameyama A. Mochizuki H. Yada T. Inaba N. Zhang Y. Kikuchi N. Kwon Y.

Biochem. 1985; 148: 463-469Google Scholar). Chondroitin GlcUA transferase, the third chondroitin glycosyltransferase cloned, has only GlcAT-II activity, which has been proposed to be involved in chain elongation (21Gotoh M. Yada T. Sato T. Akashima T. Iwasaki H. Mochizuki H. Inaba N. Togayachi A. Kudo T. Watanabe H. Kimata K. Narimatsu H. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 38179-38188Google Scholar). Therefore, more than three enzymes are likely responsible for chondroitin/dermatan sulfate biosynthesis, and these likely form a gene family as in the case of heparin/heparan sulfate biosynthesis. To search for additional members of the glycosyltransferase gene family involved in chondroitin/dermatan sulfate biosynthesis, the chondroitin GalNAcT-1 protein sequence was used to screen a data base. Here, we describe the cloning of a human cDNA encoding a novel chondroitin GalNAc transferase, designated chondroitin GalNAcT-2, that is similar to but distinct from chondroitin GalNAcT-1. UDP-[U-14C]GlcUA (285.2 mCi/mmol) and UDP-[3H]GalNAc (10 Ci/mmol) were purchased from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. Unlabeled UDP-GlcUA and UDP-GalNAc were obtained from Sigma. Chondroitin (a chemically desulfated derivative of whale cartilage chondroitin sulfate A),Acremonium sp. α-N-acetylgalactosaminidase (EC3.2.1.49), and Arthrobacter aurescens chondroitinase AC-II (EC 4.2.2.5) were purchased from Seikagaku Kogyo (Tokyo, Japan). Purified α-thrombomodulin (23Nawa K. Sakano K. Fujiwara H. Sato Y. Sugiyama N. Teruuchi T. Iwamoto M. Marumoto Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1990; 171: 729-737Google Scholar) was provided by the research institute of Dai-ichi Pure Chemicals (Tokyo, Japan) and contained the linkage tetrasaccharide GlcUAβ1–3Galβ1–3Galβ1–4Xyl (24Nadanaka S. Kitagawa H. Sugahara K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 33728-33734Google Scholar). The chemically synthesized linkage tetrasaccharide serines GlcUAβ1–3Galβ1–3Galβ1–4Xylβ1-O-Ser, GlcUAβ1–3Gal(4-O-sulfate)β1–3Galβ1–4Xylβ1-O-Ser, GlcUAβ1–3Galβ1–3Galβ1–4Xylβ1-O-(Gly)Ser-(Gly-Glu), and GlcUAβ1–3Galβ1–3Galβ1–4Xylβ1-O-Ser-(Gly-Trp-Pro-Asp-Gly) were chemically synthesized (25Tamura, J., Neumann, K. W., and Ogawa, T. (1996) Liebigs Ann. 1239–1257Google Scholar, 26Tamura J. Yamaguchi A. Tanaka J. Bioorg. Med. Chem. Lett. 2002; 12: 1901-1903Google Scholar). GlcUAβ1–3Galβ1-O-C2H4NHCbz was also synthesized. 2J. Tamura, unpublished results. Chondro-hexasaccharide (GlcUAβ1–3GalNAc)3 was prepared from chondroitin as previously described (27Kitagawa H. Tanaka Y. Tsuchida K. Goto F. Ogawa T. Lidholt K. Lindahl U. Sugahara K. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 22190-22195Google Scholar). The SuperdexTM peptide HR10/30 column was obtained fromAmersham Biosciences. A tBLASTn analysis of the GenBankTM data base using the sequence of human chondroitin GalNAcT-1 (19Uyama T. Kitagawa H. Tamura J. Sugahara K. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 8841-8846Google Scholar), revealed highly homologous clones. Analysis of one clone (GenBankTMaccession number BC030268) revealed a single open reading frame with significant sequence similarity to human chondroitin GalNAcT-1. In addition, a data base search of the Human Genome Project, which recently became available, identified a genome sequence (GenBankTM accession number NT033985.2) identical to the cDNA sequence. Comparison of the cDNA and genome sequences revealed the genomic organization of the novel chondroitin GalNAcT gene. A cDNA fragment of a truncated form of the novel chondroitin GalNAcT lacking the first 36 N-terminal amino acids was amplified by reverse transcription PCR with total RNA derived from G361 human melanoma cells (ATCC CRL-1424) as a template using a 5′-primer (5′-CGCGGATCCTTGTTAGGCAAATACACATTAATAAG-3′) containing an in-frameBamHI site and a 3′-primer (5′-CGCGGATCCGTTTTGTGGTTCATACAGTAACGC-3′) containing a BamHI site located 37 bp downstream from the stop codon. PCR was carried out with Pfu polymerase (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) for 30 cycles of 94 °C for 30 s, 55 °C for 30 s, and 72 °C for 120 s in 5% (v/v) dimethyl sulfoxide. The PCR fragments were subcloned into the BamHI site of pGIR201protA (28Kitagawa H. Paulson J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 1394-1401Google Scholar), resulting in the fusion of the putative GalNAcT with the insulin signal sequence and the protein A sequence present in the vector. AnNheI fragment containing this fusion protein sequence was inserted into the XbaI site of the expression vector pEF-BOS (29Mizushima S. Nagata S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 5322Google Scholar). The nucleotide sequence of the amplified cDNA was determined in a 377 DNA sequencer (PE Applied Biosystems). The expression plasmid (6.7 μg) was transfected into COS-1 cells on 100-mm plates using FuGENETM 6 (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Two days after transfection, 1 ml of the culture medium was collected and incubated with 10 μl of IgG-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences) for 1 h at 4 °C. The beads recovered by centrifugation were washed with, and then resuspended in, the assay buffer and tested for GalNAcT and GlcUA transferase activities as described below. The acceptors used for GalNAcT included polymer chondroitin (167 μg), chondro-hexasaccharide (GlcUAβ1–3GalNAc)3 (10 nmol), α-thrombomodulin (1 nmol), GlcUAβ1–3Galβ1-O-C2H4NHCbz (1 or 100 nmol), GlcUAβ1–3Galβ1–3Galβ1–4Xylβ1-O-Ser (1 nmol), GlcUAβ1–3Gal(4-O-sulfate)β1–3Galβ1– 4Xylβ1-O-Ser (1 nmol), GlcUAβ1–3Galβ1–3Galβ1–4Xylβ1-O-(Gly)Ser-(Gly-Glu) (1 nmol), and GlcUAβ1–3Galβ1–3Galβ1–4Xylβ1-O-Ser-(Gly-Trp-Pro-Asp-Gly) (1 nmol), whereas that for GlcUA transferase was polymer chondroitin (167 μg). The assay mixture for GalNAcT contained 10 μl of the resuspended beads, an acceptor substrate, 8.57 μmUDP-[3H]GalNAc (3.60 × 105 dpm), 50 mm MES buffer, pH 6.5, 10 mm MnCl2, and 171 μm sodium salt of ATP in a total volume of 30 μl (30Kitagawa H. Tsuchida K. Ujikawa M. Sugahara K. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1995; 117: 1083-1087Google Scholar, 31Nadanaka S. Kitagawa H. Goto F. Tamura J. Newmann K.W. Ogawa T. Sugahara K. Biochem. J. 1999; 340: 353-357Google Scholar). The assay mixture for GlcAT-II contained 10 μl of the resuspended beads, 167 μg of polymer chondroitin, 14.3 μm UDP-[14C]GlcUA (1.46 × 105 dpm), 50 mm sodium acetate buffer, pH 5.6, and 10 mm MnCl2 in a total volume of 30 μl (32Kitagawa H. Ujikawa M. Tsutsumi K. Tamura J. Neumann K.W. Ogawa T. Sugahara K. Glycobiology. 1997; 7: 905-911Google Scholar). The reaction mixtures were incubated at 37 °C for 4 h, and then the radiolabeled products were separated from UDP-[3H]GalNAc or UDP-[14C]GlcUA by gel filtration using a syringe column packed with Sephadex G-25 (superfine), or a Superdex peptide column, or by HPLC on a Nova-Pak® C18 column (3.9 × 150 mm, Waters, Tokyo, Japan) as described previously (16Kitagawa H. Shimakawa H. Sugahara K. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 13933-13937Google Scholar, 30Kitagawa H. Tsuchida K. Ujikawa M. Sugahara K. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1995; 117: 1083-1087Google Scholar, 31Nadanaka S.

The recovered labeled products were quantified by liquid scintillation spectrophotometry. The products of the GalNAcT reaction using polymer chondroitin as the acceptor were isolated by gel filtration on a Superdex peptide column equilibrated with 0.25 m NH4HCO3, 7% 1-propanol. The radioactive fractions containing the enzyme reaction product were pooled and evaporated to dryness. The isolated GalNAcT reaction product (about 150 μg) was digested with 100 mIU of chondroitinase AC-II to assess digestibility in a total volume of 30 μl of 50 mm sodium acetate buffer, pH 6.0, at 37 °C overnight. The enzyme digest was analyzed using the Superdex peptide column described above. The products from the GalNAcT reaction using GlcUAβ1–3Galβ1-O-C2H4NHCbz were isolated by HPLC on a Nova-Pak® C18 column (described above) in an LC-10A system (Shimadzu, Kyoto, Japan). The column was developed isocratically for 15 min with H2O at a flow rate of 1.0 ml/min at room temperature; then, a linear gradient was applied to increase the methanol concentration from 0 to 100% over a 5-min period; the column was then developed isocratically for 40 min with 100% methanol. The radioactive fractions containing the product were pooled and evaporated to dryness. The isolated product (about 80 pmol) was incubated with 100 mIU of chondroitinase AC-II to assess the digestibility in a total volume of 30 μl of 50 mm sodium acetate buffer, pH 6.0, at 37 °C overnight or 40 mIU of α-N-acetylgalactosaminidase in a total volume of 20 μl of 50 mm sodium citrate buffer, pH 4.5, at 37 °C overnight (16Kitagawa H. Shimakawa H. Sugahara K. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 13933-13937Google Scholar). The enzyme digest was analyzed using the Nova-Pak® C18 column described above. A commercial human 12-lane multiple tissue Northern blot (Clontech) membrane was used for the analysis. The membrane was probed with a gel-purified, radiolabeled (>1 × 109 cpm/μg), 1.0-kb chondroitin GalNAcT-2-specific fragment corresponding to nucleotides 109–1123 of the chondroitin GalNAcT-2 cDNA (GenBankTM accession number AB090811). We recently identified and characterized human chondroitin GalNAcT-1 (19Uyama T. Kitagawa H. Tamura J. Sugahara K. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 8841-8846Google Scholar). Screening of the nonredundant data base at the National Center for Biotechnology Information (National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD) using the deduced amino acid sequence of human chondroitin GalNAcT-1 identified a clone (GenBankTMaccession number BC030268) containing a 335-bp 5′-untranslated region, a single open reading frame of 1626 bp encoding a protein of 542 amino acids with two potential N-glycosylation sites (Fig. 1), and a 3′-untranslated region of approximately 1.8 kb with one presumptive polyadenylation signal. Northern blot analysis indicated that the mRNA was about 3.9 kb long in various human tissues (see below), suggesting that the cDNA was approximately full-length. The deduced amino acid sequence corresponded to a 62,571-Da polypeptide. The predicted translation initiation site conformed to the Kozak consensus sequence for initiation (34Kozak M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1984; 12: 857-872Google Scholar), and an in-frame stop codon was present upstream from the assigned ATG initiating codon. A Kyte-Doolittle hydropathy analysis (35Kyte J. Doolittle R.F. J. Mol. Biol. 1982; 157: 105-132Google Scholar) revealed one prominent hydrophobic segment of 19 amino acid residues in the N-terminal region, predicting that the protein has the type II transmembrane topology characteristic of many of the Golgi-localized glycosyltransferases cloned to date (Fig. 1). Data base searches indicated that the amino acid sequence displayed 60% identity to human chondroitin GalNAcT-1 (GenBankTMaccession number AB071403) (Fig. 1); the highest sequence identity was found in the C-terminal domain, which has catalytic activity. Notably, each protein shared a conserved DVD motif (Fig. 1), which appears to correspond to the conserved DXD motif found in most glycosyltransferases (36Wiggins S. Munro S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 7945-7950Google Scholar). Therefore, the features of the identified protein sequence suggest that the identified gene product possesses β1,4-GalNAc transferase (GalNAcT-I and/or -II) activities like chondroitin GalNAcT-1. Intriguingly, a homologue of the identified human gene was found in the Drosophila genome but not in theCaenorhabditis elegans genome. The human sequence shared 38% identity with that of Drosophila (Fig. 1). Comparison of the identified cDNA sequence with the genome sequence deposited in the Human Genome Project data base revealed the genomic structure and chromosome localization of the gene. The gene spans more than 47 kb, and the coding region of the gene is divided into seven discrete exons as shown in Fig. 2. Its genomic organization is very similar to that of the chondroitin GalNAcT-1 gene, which consists of seven discrete exons in the coding region. The intron/exon junctions follow the G(T/A)G rule (37Breathnach R. Chambon P. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1981; 50: 349-383Google Scholar) and are flanked by conserved sequences (data not shown). This gene is located on human chromosome 10q11.22. To facilitate the functional analysis of the putative GalNAcT, a soluble form of the protein was generated by replacing the first 36 amino acids of the putative glycosyltransferase with a cleavable insulin signal sequence and the protein A IgG-binding domain, as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Then, the soluble putative glycosyltransferase was expressed in COS-1 cells as a recombinant enzyme fused with the protein A IgG-binding domain. When the expression plasmid containing the putative glycosyltransferase/protein A fusion construct was expressed in COS-1 cells, an ∼95-kDa protein was secreted as shown by Western blotting using IgG (data not shown). The apparent M r of the fused protein was reduced to about 87 kDa after N-glycosidase treatment (data not shown), suggesting that either one or both of the two potentialN-linked glycosylation sites of the putative glycosyltransferase was utilized. The fused enzyme expressed in the medium was adsorbed onto IgG-Sepharose beads to eliminate endogenous glycosyltransferases, and then the enzyme-bound beads were used as an enzyme source. The bound fusion protein was assayed for glycosyltransferase activity using a variety of acceptors and either UDP-GalNAc or UDP-GlcUA as a donor substrate. GlcUAβ1–3Galβ1-O-C2H4NHCbz, which was used as an acceptor substrate for the GalNAcT-I reaction, shares the disaccharide sequence with the GAG protein linkage region tetrasaccharide. As shown in Table I, marked GalNAc transferase activity was detected with polymer chondroitin, chondro-hexasaccharide (GlcUAβ1–3GalNAc)3, α-thrombomodulin containing a linkage region tetrasaccharide, GlcUAβ1–3Galβ1–3Galβ1–4Xylβ1 on the native core protein (24Nadanaka S.

In contrast, no GlcUA transferase activity was observed using polymer chondroitin. No detectable glycosyltransferase activity was recovered by affinity purification from a control pEF-BOS transfection sample. These findings clearly indicate that the expressed protein is a GalNAcT responsible for chondroitin biosynthesis.Table IComparison of the acceptor specificity of chondroitin GalNAcT-1 and -2 secreted into culture medium by transfected COS-1 cellsAcceptorDonorActivity1-aThe values are the averages of two independent experiments.

https://openalex.org/W2024956005,"Direct reaction of NAD(P)H with oxidants like singlet oxygen (1O2) has not yet been demonstrated in biological systems. We therefore chose different rhodamine derivatives (tetramethylrhodamine methyl ester, TMRM; 2′,4′,5′,7′-tetrabromorhodamine 123 bromide; and rhodamine 123; Rho 123) to selectively generate singlet oxygen within the NAD(P)H-rich mitochondrial matrix of cultured hepatocytes. In a cell-free system, photoactivation of all of these dyes led to the formation of 1O2, which readily oxidized NAD(P)H to NAD(P)+. In hepatocytes loaded with the various dyes only TMRM and Rho 123 proved suited to generating1O2 within the mitochondrial matrix space. Photoactivation of the intracellular dyes (TMRM for 5–10 s, Rho 123 for 60 s) led to a significant (29.6 ± 8.2 and 30.2 ± 5.2%) and rapid decrease in mitochondrial NAD(P)H fluorescence followed by a slow reincrease. Prolonged photoactivation (≥15 s) of TMRM-loaded cells resulted in even stronger NAD(P)H oxidation, the rapid onset of mitochondrial permeability transition, and apoptotic cell death. These results demonstrate that NAD(P)H is the primary target for 1O2 in hepatocyte mitochondria. Thus NAD(P)H may operate directly as an intracellular antioxidant, as long as it is regenerated.

The ability of an organism to counteract reactive oxygen species (ROS)1 or reactive nitrogen species depends on its antioxidative capabilities, which involves destroying of both pro-oxidants (e.g. ROOH, H2O2, ONOOH) and oxidants (e.g.radicals and reactive intermediates like singlet oxygen,1O2). Whereas pro-oxidants are typically degraded by enzymes (e.g. catalase, glutathione peroxidase, and superoxide dismutase), oxidants are scavenged by relatively small biomolecules (e.g. ascorbic acid, glutathione, and α-tocopherol); these are termed directly operating antioxidants. In this context, NAD(P)H is crucial to maintaining the cellular redox state and/or antioxidative capacity, because of its essential role as a coenzyme in the enzymatic re-reduction of directly operating antioxidants (1Kirsch M. de Groot H. FASEB J. 2001; 15: 1569-1574Google Scholar, 2Leopold J.A. Cap A. Scribner A.W. Stanton R. Loscalzo J. FASEB J. 2001; 15: 1771-1773Google Scholar). Consequently, NAD(P)H deficiencies are linked with an increased sensitivity to oxidative stress (2Leopold J.A. Cap A. Scribner A.W. Stanton R. Loscalzo J. FASEB J. 2001; 15: 1771-1773Google Scholar, 3Minard K.I. McAlister-Henn L. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2001; 31: 832-843Google Scholar). The capability of NAD(P)H to additionally act as a directly operating antioxidant, i.e. to donate only one electron, was sharply underestimated by various biochemical researchers, a fact that is probably because of the observation that a biochemical standard one-electron oxidant, [Fe(CN)6]3−, oxidizes NADH only very slowly (4Schellenberg K.A. Hellerman L. J. Biol. Chem. 1958; 231: 547-556Google Scholar). However, we recently demonstrated that, in line with the Marcus theory of electron transfer (1Kirsch M. de Groot H. FASEB J. 2001; 15: 1569-1574Google Scholar, 5Kirsch M. de Groot H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 24664-24670Google Scholar), the reaction constant of Reaction 1NADH+Rad⋅→NAD⋅+RHREACTION1correlated well with the reduction potential of the oxidizing radical (1Kirsch M. de Groot H. FASEB J. 2001; 15: 1569-1574Google Scholar). Consequently, putative harmful radicals (ROO⋅, RO⋅, CO3⋅−) react very fast with NADH (k r = 108-109m−1s−1). The NAD⋅ radical thus formed reacts with molecular oxygen near to the diffusion-controlled limit, thereby yielding NAD+ and superoxide, shown in Reaction 2.NAD⋅+O2→NAD++O2⨪REACTION2In chemical systems, O2⨪ spontaneously dismutates to H2O2 and 1O2 (6Corey E.J. Mehrotra M.M. Khan A.U. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

FASEB J. 2001; 15: 1569-1574Google Scholar). Besides oxidizing radicals, the reactive intermediate1O2 also rapidly reacts with both NADH and NADPH (k r = 4.3 × 107m−1 s−1 and 8.4 × 107m−1 s−1) via single electron transfer (7Peters G. Rodgers M.A.J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1980; 96: 770-776Google Scholar, 8Peters G. Rodgers M.A.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1981; 637: 43-52Google Scholar), shown in Reactions 7 and 8.NAD(P)H+1O2→NAD(P)⋅+O2⨪+H+REACTION7NAD(P)⋅+O2→NAD(P)++O2⨪REACTION8In 1976 the thermodynamic capability of NAD(P)H to transfer only one electron to 1O2 was estimated by Koppenol (9Koppenol W.H. Nature. 1976; 262: 420-421Google Scholar). Experimental evidence of this reaction in cell-free systems was provided, and consequences of 1O2 generation in mitochondria were hypothesized (7Peters G. Rodgers M.A.J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1980; 96: 770-776Google Scholar, 8Peters G. Rodgers M.A.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1981; 637: 43-52Google Scholar, 10Bodaness R.S. Chan P.C. J. Biol.

In biological systems, however, direct, i.e. non-enzymatic, oxidation of NAD(P)H by 1O2 or by any other oxidant has not yet been demonstrated. In most cell types, the highest concentrations of reduced nicotinamides are located within the matrix space of mitochondria (12Tyler D.D. The Mitochondrion in Health and Disease. VCH Publishers, Inc., New York1992Google Scholar). Taking this into consideration, along with the kinetic data on reactions of different ROS with NAD(P)H in comparison with other biomolecules,1O2 can be expected to be most effective, and most selective, in oxidizing mitochondrial NAD(P)H. We therefore studied the effect of 1O2 on the NAD(P)H redox state within the exceptional NAD(P)H-rich mitochondrial matrix space of cultured hepatocytes (12Tyler D.D. The Mitochondrion in Health and Disease. VCH Publishers, Inc., New York1992Google Scholar, 13Hoek J.B. Rydström J. Biochem. J. 1988; 254: 1-10Google Scholar). To perform these studies, we established a system based on different rhodamine derivatives and on digital fluorescence microscopy to selectively generate1O2 in close proximity to this NAD(P)H pool and to record the effect on mitochondrial NAD(P)H fluorescence with high temporal resolution. Leibovitz L-15 medium was obtained from Invitrogen; collagenase, collagen (Type R), dexamethasone, and gentamicin were from Serva (Heidelberg, Germany); and KCN and Me2SO were from Merck (Darmstadt, Germany). Bovine serum albumin came from Behring Institute (Mannheim, Germany), and the following chemicals were from Sigma: fetal calf serum, superoxide dismutase, NADP-linked isocitric dehydrogenase, 1,3-bis(chloroethyl)-1-nitrosourea (BCNU), β-hydroxybutyric acid, acetoacetic acid, carbonyl cyanidem-chlorophenylhydrazone, β-d-fructose, glutathione (reduced) ethyl ester, dl-isocitric acid, NADH, NADPH, tert-butyl hydroperoxide (t-BuOOH), trifluoperazine, and propidium iodide. Chelex (chelating resin; iminodiacetic acid), 1,3-diphenylisobenzofuran, and 9,10-diphenylanthracene were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich, and digitonin was from Fluka. The fluorescent dyes tetramethylrhodamine methyl ester (TMRM), 2′,4′,5′,7′-tetrabromorhodamine 123 bromide (TBRB), rhodamine (Rho) 123, and calcein-acetoxymethylester were purchased from Molecular Probes Europe B.V. (Leiden, The Netherlands). Falcon 6-well cell culture plates were obtained from BD Biosciences, and glass coverslips were from Assistent (Sondheim/Röhn, Germany). Male Wistar rats (200–350 g) were obtained from the Zentrales Tierlaboratorium (Universitätsklinikum Essen). Animals were kept under standard conditions with free access to food and water. All animals received humane care in compliance with the institutional guidelines. Hepatocytes were isolated from male Wistar rats as described previously (14de Groot H. Brecht M. Biol. Chem. Hoppe-Seyler. 1991; 372: 35-41Google Scholar). For the fluorescence measurements 1.7 × 105 cells/cm2 were seeded onto collagen-coated 6.2-cm2 glass coverslips in 6-well cell culture plates. Cells were cultured in L-15 medium supplemented with 5% fetal calf serum, l-glutamine (2.0 mm), glucose (8.3 mm), bovine serum albumin (0.1%), NaHCO3 (14.3 mm), gentamicin (50 mg/liter), and dexamethasone (1.0 μm) at 37 °C in a 100% humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2/21% O2/74% N2. Two h after seeding, adherent cells were washed three times with Hanks' balanced salt solution (HBSS; 137.0 mm NaCl/5.4 mmKCl/1.0 mm CaCl2/0.5 mmMgCl2/0.4 mm KH2PO4/0.4 mm MgSO4/0.3 mmNa2HPO4/25.0 mm Hepes, pH 7.4) and supplied with fresh medium as reported previously (15Petrat F. Rauen U. de Groot H. Hepatology. 1999; 29: 1171-1179Google Scholar). The1O2 detector molecules 1,3-diphenylisobenzofuran and 9,10-diphenylanthracene (each 5 μm; stock solutions 10 mm in Me2SO) were added to HBSS (3.0 ml, 25 °C) and transferred into the quartz cuvette of a spectrofluorometer (RF-1501; Shimadzu, Kyoto, Japan). After recording the baseline fluorescence of the detector molecules (1,3-diphenylisobenzofuran λexc. = 409 nm, λem. = 476 nm; 9,10-diphenylanthracene λexc. = 391 nm, λem. = 405 nm) for 5 min at 60-s intervals, TMRM (10 μm), Rho 123, (10 μm) or TBRB (10 μm) were added from concentrated stock solutions (10 mm in Me2SO), and the fluorescence of the1O2 detector molecules was recorded for a further 5 min. Afterward, the samples were transferred into a modified Pentz chamber (diameter, 24 mm) placed on the microscope stage (37 °C) of an inverted microscope; a second sample treated the same way up to that point was kept in the dark and served as a control. To photoactivate the different rhodamine derivatives (TMRM λexc. = 535 ± 17.5 nm; Rho 123 λexc.= 488 ± 10 nm; TBRB λexc. = 535 ± 17.5 nm), the 100-watt mercury short arc photo optic lamp (HBO 100; Osram, Göttingen, Germany) of a digital fluorescence microscope (Axiovert 135 TV; Zeiss, Oberkochen, Germany) equipped with the Attofluor imaging system (Atto Instruments, Rockville, MD) was used. To allow effective irradiation of the whole sample volume, the objective (×63 numerical aperture 1.25 Plan-Neofluar; Zeiss, Göttingen) of the microscope was removed, and the irradiation period was set at 10 min; except for this modification, the same conditions were used to photoactivate the dyes in the cell-free system as those used in experiments with cells (see below). After this treatment, the samples were again transferred to the cuvette of the spectrofluorometer, and the fluorescence intensity of the1O2 detector molecules was compared with that of the untreated controls. In other experiments the rhodamine derivatives were photoactivated in the presence of NADPH (20 μm; stock solution 2.0 mm in HBSS), or the 1O2 detector molecules were replaced by NADH or NADPH (20 μm), and MgCl2 (5.0 mm) was added to the reaction buffer (HBSS, 25 °C). NADPH fluorescence intensity was detected spectrofluorometrically (λexc. = 340 nm; λem. = 460 nm) before and after photoactivation of the rhodamine derivatives (see above). To determine the amount of NADP+ formed, dl-isocitric acid (4.0 mm) and NADP-linked isocitric dehydrogenase (0.21 units/ml) were added to the reaction buffer (HBSS, 37 °C) subsequent to the irradiation procedures. The increase in fluorescence (λexc. = 340 nm; λem. = 460 nm) of the irradiated mixture indicating enzymatic re-reduction of NADP+ to NADPH was recorded spectrofluorometrically (11Bodaness R.S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1982; 108: 1709-1715Google Scholar). Further experiments were performed in the presence of either superoxide dismutase (100 units/ml) or various HBSS/D2O ratios. Alternatively, experiments were performed with HBSS that had been treated with chelex (15Petrat F. Rauen U. de Groot H. Hepatology. 1999; 29: 1171-1179Google Scholar, 16Evans P.J. Halliwell B. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 233: 82-92Google Scholar) to minimize the transition metal contamination. Experiments with hepatocytes were started 20–24 h after isolation of the cells. The glass coverslips with adherent cells were transferred to a modified Pentz chamber, and cells were washed twice with warm (37 °C) HBSS. Hepatocytes were incubated with TMRM (0.5 μm), Rho 123 (0.5 or 10.0 μm), or TBRB (2.0 μm; stock solutions: 1.0 or 2.0 or 10.0 mm in Me2SO) for 20 min in L-15 cell culture medium (37 °C) and then washed three times with HBSS. Afterward, the hepatocytes thus loaded were incubated for another 15 min in dye-free L-15 medium; this incubation period has been found previously to strongly improve the selectivity of the mitochondrial loading with TMRM and Rho 123 (17Petrat F. de Groot H. Rauen U. Biochem. J. 2001; 356: 61-69Google Scholar, 18Petrat F. Weisheit D. Lensen M. de Groot H. Sustmann R. Rauen U. Biochem. J. 2002; 362: 137-147Google Scholar). The medium was then exchanged, and hepatocytes were covered again with complete L-15 cell culture medium (37 °C) to maintain optimal nutrition of the cells during the experiments. The presence of culture medium did not add significant background to the autofluorescence images at the setting used in this study. A digital fluorescence microscope was used to measure cellular NAD(P)H fluorescence (see above). Measurements were performed at 37 °C using an excitation filter of 365 ± 12.5 nm and monitoring the emission at 450–490 nm using a bandpass filter. During the measurements cells were flushed with either 5% CO2/21% O2/74% N2 or 5% CO2/95% N2 (in air-tight chambers) to induce hypoxia. Cellular NAD(P)H fluorescence was recorded at 120-s intervals with an excitation period of 0.3 s and the intensity of the mercury lamp attenuated 99% using gray filters to minimize photochemical effects. Single cell fluorescence was determined by confining the regions of interest manually to individual cells. After establishing NAD(P)H baseline fluorescence (6–10 min), the intracellular rhodamine derivatives were photoactivated for 1–60 s at the wavelengths cited above, and NAD(P)H fluorescence measurements were continued without delaying the interval for data collection. Rho 123 was excited at either 488 ± 10 nm or 535 ± 17.5 nm as the excitation maximum of this dye has been reported to shift from 507 (19Haugland R.P. Handbook of Fluorescent Probes and Research Products. 9th Ed. Molecular Probes, Inc., Eugene, OR1996: 479-487Google Scholar) to 514.5 nm within cells (20Shea C.R. Chen N. Wimberly J. Hasan T. Cancer Res. 1989; 49: 3961-3965Google Scholar, 21Shea C.R. Sherwood M.E. Flotte T.J. Chen N. Scholz M. Hasan T. Cancer Res. 1990; 50: 4167-4172Google Scholar). In some experiments, cultured hepatocytes (in L-15 medium, 37 °C) were preincubated for 1 h with either 300 μm of the glutathione reductase inhibitor BCNU (22Adamson G.M. Harman A.W. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1993; 45: 2289-2294Google Scholar, 23Harbrecht B.G., Di Silvio M. Chough V. Kim Y.M. Simmons R.L. Billiar T.R. Ann. Surg. 1997; 225: 76-87Google Scholar) or an ethyl ester of reduced glutathione (4.0 mm) before fluorescence measurements were started (in the presence of these chemicals). All of the further chemicals were added from concentrated stock solutions during NAD(P)H fluorescence measurements at the respective concentrations detailed in the results. None of the chemicals/agents added in this study showed any detectable fluorescence under the conditions applied. A laser scanning microscope (LSM 510; Zeiss, Oberkochen, Germany) equipped with both argon and helium/neon lasers was used to study the subcellular distribution of the different rhodamine derivatives and their effect on mitochondrial integrity after photoactivation. Subcellular distribution of TMRM (λexc. = 543 nm; λem. ≥ 560 nm), Rho 123 (λexc. = 488 nm; λem. ≥ 505 nm), and of TBRB (λexc. = 543 nm; λem. ≥ 560 nm) was determined from the subcellular fluorescence of the probes at the respective wavelengths. The objective lens was a ×63 numerical aperture 1.40 Plan-Apochromat. The scanning parameters were as follows. The pinhole was set at 130 μm, producing confocal optical slices of less than 1.0 μm in thickness. Confocal images (scanning time 3.9 s, zoom factor 0.7 to 2.5) were collected at different intervals and with different parameters. The power of the helium/neon laser was set at 1.0%, and that of the argon laser was set at 0.1% to minimize photochemical damage. Similar to the experiments based on digital fluorescence microscopy, after establishing the baseline fluorescence (5–10 min), the rhodamine derivatives were photoactivated for 5–60 s using the 100-watt mercury short arc photo optic lamp of the LSM 510 system. In some experiments, hepatocellular autofluorescence was excited at 488 nm with the power of the argon laser set at 10%, collecting fluorescence emission through a 505-nm long pass filter. Image processing and evaluation were performed using the “physiology evaluation” software of the LSM 510 imaging system. Mitochondria were identified, and their functional integrity was confirmed by membrane potential-dependent staining with TMRM, using either digital fluorescence microscopy or laser scanning microscopy. Hepatocytes were incubated with TMRM (0.5 μm) as described above. When digital fluorescence microscopy was used, intracellular TMRM fluorescence (λexc. = 535 ± 17.5 nm; λem. ≥ 590 nm) was recorded at 120-s intervals with the intensity of the mercury lamp attenuated 40% using gray filters to minimize photochemical effects; using laser scanning microscopy, mitochondrial TMRM fluorescence (λexc. = 543 nm; λem. ≥ 560 nm) was scanned at different intervals as given above. In some experiments hepatocytes were incubated simultaneously with TMRM (0.5 μm) and Rho 123 (0.5 μm). In experiments with double-stained mitochondria, red fluorescence of TMRM (λexc. = 543 nm; λem.≥ 585 nm) and green fluorescence of Rho 123 (λexc. = 488 nm; λem. = 505–530 nm) were optically isolated in successive scans. The onset of mitochondrial permeability transition (MPT) was detected according to the procedure described in Ref 24Zahrebelski G. Nieminen A.-L., Al- Ghoul K. Qian T. Herman B. Lemasters J.J. Hepatology. 1995; 21: 1361-1372Google Scholar, with slight modifications. Briefly, cells were loaded simultaneously with calcein-AM (1.0 μm) and TMRM (0.5 μm) as described above for the loading with TMRM alone and then washed three times with HBSS and covered again with L-15 cell culture medium (for 15 min) that contained propidium iodide (5 μg/ml) but not TMRM (100 nm) as originally reported (24Zahrebelski G. Nieminen A.-L., Al- Ghoul K. Qian T. Herman B. Lemasters J.J. Hepatology. 1995; 21: 1361-1372Google Scholar). This incubation period and the following experiments were performed in the absence of any TMRM within the supernatant to make sure that the probe was located exclusively within the mitochondrial matrix of the cells (see above). Using laser scanning microscopy, red fluorescence of TMRM (λexc. = 543 nm; λem. ≥ 585 nm) and green fluorescence of calcein (λexc. = 488 nm; λem. = 505–530 nm) were recorded in successive scans. Loss in mitochondrial TMRM fluorescence and redistribution of cytosolic calcein fluorescence (into the mitochondrial matrix) were considered as qualitative measures of a decrease in mitochondrial membrane potential and an increased permeability of the inner mitochondrial membrane, respectively, known to indicate the onset of MPT as high conductance permeability transition pores are opened (24Zahrebelski G. Nieminen A.-L., Al- Ghoul K. Qian T. Herman B. Lemasters J.J. Hepatology. 1995; 21: 1361-1372Google Scholar, 25Nieminen A.-L. Saylor A.K. Tesfai S.A. Herman B. Lemasters J.J. Biochem.

The uptake of the vital dye propidium iodide (5 μg/ml) was routinely determined either during or at the end of the experimental procedures to detect loss of cell viability. The red fluorescence of propidium iodide excited at 543 nm was collected through a 560-nm long pass filter when laser scanning microscopy was used; using digital fluorescence microscopy, propidium iodide was detected at λexc. = 535 ± 17.5 nm and λem. ≥ 590 nm. All experiments with hepatocytes were repeated at least three times using cells from different animals, and experiments in a cell-free system were repeated at least twice. Cellular microfluorographs and traces shown in the figures are representative of all the corresponding experiments performed. The results are expressed as means ± S.D. or S.E. Before starting with the cellular measurements, we studied in a cell-free system whether photoactivation of the different rhodamine derivatives (TMRM, Rho 123, and TBRB) intended to be used for intramitochondrial generation of 1O2 did in fact generate sufficient 1O2. Additionally, we tested whether NAD(P)H, when reacting with this ROS, underwent significant oxidation to enzymatically active NAD(P)+ as reported previously (8Peters G. Rodgers M.A.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1981; 637: 43-52Google Scholar, 10Bodaness R.S. Chan P.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1977; 252: 8554-8560Google Scholar, 11Bodaness R.S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1982; 108: 1709-1715Google Scholar). When the known (20Shea C.R. Chen N. Wimberly J. Hasan T. Cancer Res. 1989; 49: 3961-3965Google Scholar, 21Shea C.R. Sherwood M.E. Flotte T.J. Chen N.

Porphyrins Phthalocyanines. 2001; 5: 105-129Google Scholar) 1O2 generators TBRB and Rho 123 (10 μm) were photoactivated, the fluorescence of both 1O2 detector molecules, 1,3-diphenylisobenzofuran (5 μm) and 9,10-diphenylanthracene (5 μm), was markedly quenched (data not shown). Very surprisingly, TMRM, for which1O2 generation has not yet been quantified, was even more effective than Rho 123, presumably because of the small1O2 quantum yield of the latter (20Shea C.R. Chen N. Wimberly J. Hasan T. Cancer Res. 1989; 49: 3961-3965Google Scholar, 28MacDonald I.J. Dougherty T.J. J. Porphyrins Phthalocyanines. 2001; 5: 105-129Google Scholar). Using TMRM, the fluorescence of 1,3-diphenylisobenzofuran was quenched more strongly (54.5 ± 3.0%) than that of 9,10-diphenylanthracene (14.1 ± 1.0%), in line with their rate constants for single electron transfer to 1O2(k r ≈ 1.0 × 109m−1 s−1, andk r ≈ 1.0 × 106m−1 s−1, respectively; (29Ross A.B. Mallard W.G. Helman W.P. Buxton G.V. Huie R.E. Neta P. NDRL/NIST Solution Kinetics Database 3.0. NDRL/NIST, Gaithersburg, MD1998Google Scholar)). In controls, in which the rhodamine derivatives were not photoactivated, or the samples were irradiated in the absence of the1O2 generators, no quenching of the detector molecules became apparent. To confirm the conclusion that TMRM is highly effective in generating 1O2, the fluorescence quenching of 1,3-diphenylisobenzofuran and 9,10-diphenylanthracene was performed in the presence of D2O, which is known to increase the lifetime and thus the steady state level of 1O2 severalfold (30Ogilby P.R. Foote C.S. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1982; 104: 2069-2070Google Scholar, 31Parker J.G. Stanbro W.D. J. Photochem. 1984; 25: 545-547Google Scholar). In line with our view, the fluorescence quenching of the1O2 detector molecules was enhanced 2–3-fold in the presence of D2O (data not shown). In summary, the data presented here clearly demonstrated that photoactivation of all rhodamines resulted in the generation of1O2. When the 1O2 detector molecules were replaced by NADPH (20 μm), its fluorescence significantly decreased after photoactivation of the selected rhodamines (each 10 μm; see Table I). Similar to the experiments performed with 1,3-diphenylisobenzofuran and 9,10-diphenylanthracene, NAD(P)H fluorescence decreased more strongly (50–80%) in the presence of D2O (data not shown). Again, the strongest decrease in fluorescence was observed with TBRB as a1O2 generator. The decrease in NADPH fluorescence was found to be independent of the presence of either superoxide dismutase or contaminant transition metal ions (Table I). The latter possibility was excluded by treating the reaction solution with chelex. Thus, the fluorescence of NADPH was neither affected by O2⨪, which may arise during 1O2generation (see Reactions 7 and 8), nor by ⋅OH, resulting from transition metal-dependent Fenton reactions. In the absence of the 1O2 generators the NAD(P)H fluorescence hardly decreased (2%/h) via autoxidation (data not shown). To verify that NADPH was actually oxidized to its enzymatically active non-fluorescent form (NADP+), we tested whether re-reduction was possible, using the procedure described by Bodaness (11Bodaness R.S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1982; 108: 1709-1715Google Scholar), with slight modifications. When dl-isocitric acid and NADP-linked isocitric dehydrogenase were added to the incubation buffer after photoactivation of the selected rhodamine derivatives, NADPH fluorescence was largely restored within minutes (Table I). These results strongly indicated that NAD(P)H was oxidized by1O2 via Reactions 7 and 8 as suggested by Peters and Rodgers (7Peters G. Rodgers M.A.J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1980; 96: 770-776Google Scholar, 8Peters G. Rodgers M.A.J. Biochim. Biophys.

NADPH fluorescence (λexc. = 340 nm; λem. = 460 nm) was recorded spectrofluorometrically at 120-s intervals before and after photoactivation (for 10 min) of the dyes (TMRM λexc. = 535 ± 17.5 nm; Rho 123 λexc. = 488 ± 10 nm; TBRB λexc. = 535 ± 17.5 nm). Enzymatically active NADP+ was determined from the increase in fluorescence (λexc. = 340 nm; λem. = 460 nm) of the irradiated mixture following the addition ofd-l-isocitric acid (4.0 mm) and NADP-linked isocitric dehydrogenase (0.21 units/ml).

We have shown previously in MCF-10A breast epithelial cells that chronic activation of Ras-p44/42 mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase confers resistance to the growth-inhibitory effects of IGFBP-3 (Martin, J. L., and Baxter, R. C. (1999) J. Biol. Chem. 274, 16407–16411). Here we show that, in the same cell line, IGFBP-3 potentiates DNA synthesis and cell proliferation stimulated by epidermal growth factor (EGF), a potent activator of Ras. A mutant of IGFBP-3, which fails to translocate to the nucleus and has reduced ability to cell-associate, similarly enhanced EGF action in these cells. By contrast, the structurally related IGFBP-5, which shares many functional features with IGFBP-3, was slightly inhibitory to DNA synthesis in the presence of EGF. IGFBP-3 primes MCF-10A cells to respond to EGF because pre-incubation caused a similar degree of EGF potentiation as co-incubation. In IGFBP-3-primed cells, EGF-stimulated EGF receptor phosphorylation at Tyr-1068 was increased relative to unprimed cells, as was phosphorylation and activity of p44/42 and p38 MAP kinases, but not Akt/PKB. Partial blockade of the p44/42 and p38 MAP kinase pathways abolished the potentiation by IGFBP-3 of EGF-stimulated DNA synthesis. Collectively, these findings indicate that IGFBP-3 enhances EGF signaling and proliferative effects in breast epithelial cells via increased EGF receptor phosphorylation and activation of p44/42 and p38 MAP kinase signaling pathways.

Baxter R.C. Rosenfeld R. Roberts C. The IGF System: Molecular Biology, Physiology and Clinical Applications. Humana, Totowa, NJ1999: 227-255Google Scholar). By virtue of its high affinity for these growth factors, IGFBP-3 competes for ligand binding with the receptor primarily responsible for mediating the actions of IGF-I and -II, the type I IGF receptor (IGFR1) (2Jones J.I. Clemmons D.R. Endocr. Rev. 1995; 16: 3-34Google Scholar), and thereby blocks mitogenic and anti-apoptotic signaling initiated by its activation. An important role for IGFBP-3 in modulating the proliferative effects of IGFs in many cell types is well recognized, and both exogenous and endogenous IGFBP-3 have been shown to block IGF action in breast cancer cells in vitro (3Fontana J.A. Burrows M.A. Clemmons D.R. LeRoith D. Endocrinology. 1991; 128: 1115-1122Google Scholar, 4Martin J.L. Coverley J.A. Pattison S.T. Baxter R.C. Endocrinology. 1995; 136: 1219-1226Google Scholar, 5Nickerson T. Huynh H. Pollak M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 237: 690-693Google Scholar, 6Salahifar H. Firth S.M. Baxter R.C. Martin J.L. Growth Hormone IGF Res. 2000; 10: 367-377Google Scholar). An additional role for IGFBP-3 also exists as a growth modulator with intrinsic bioactivity in breast cancer cells and other cells in vitro. The antiproliferative effects of a number of antitumor agents including transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β), vitamin D, and retinoic acid in breast cancer cells appear to be mediated, at least in part, by IGFBP-3 acting independently of IGF sequestration (7Oh Y. Muller H.L., Ng, L. Rosenfeld R.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 13589-13592Google Scholar,8Colston K.W. Perks C.M. Xie S.P. Holly J.M. J. Mol. Endocrinol. 1998; 20: 157-162Google Scholar). The IGF independence of IGFBP-3 actions is inferred from an inability of other IGFBPs to mimic the effect, persistence of the growth-inhibitory effect of IGFBP-3 in the presence of insulin or IGF analogs, which activate the IGFR1 but which do not bind IGFBP-3, and no clear evidence of IGFs being present in the system under investigation (7Oh Y. Muller H.L., Ng, L. Rosenfeld R.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 13589-13592Google Scholar). In addition to its anti-mitogenic effects, IGFBP-3 exhibits pro-apoptotic activity in vitro. IGFBP-3 may sensitize breast cancer cells to apoptotic inducers such as ionizing radiation (9Butt A.J. Firth S.M. King M.A. Baxter R.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 39174-39181Google Scholar) and ceramide (10Perks C.M. Bowen S. Gill Z.P. Newcomb P.V. Holly J.M. J. Cell. Biochem. 1999; 75: 652-664Google Scholar), and directly effect apoptosis via induction of pro-apoptotic proteins such as Bax and Bad (9Butt A.J. Firth S.M. King M.A. Baxter R.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 39174-39181Google Scholar). Collectively, these observations suggest that IGFBP-3 is an important antiproliferative agent in breast cancer cells, acting both through IGF-independent and IGF-modulatory pathways. By contrast with these findings, however, IGFBP-3 may also be growth-stimulatory in vitro. In MCF-7 breast cancer cells, IGFBP-3 enhanced IGF-stimulated DNA synthesis (11Chen J.C. Shao Z.M. Sheikh M.S. Hussain A. LeRoith D. Roberts C.J. Fontana J.A. J. Cell. Physiol. 1994; 158: 69-78Google Scholar) similar to its effects in fibroblasts reported previously (12DeMellow J.S.M. Baxter R.C. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1988; 156: 199-204Google Scholar). More recent studies have shown that proliferation of airway smooth muscle cells is stimulated by IGFBP-3 in the presence of serum (13Cohen P. Rajah R. Rosenbloom J. Herrick D.J. Am. J. Physiol. 2000; 278: L545-L551Google Scholar), and IGFBP-3 increases proliferation of LNCaP prostate cancer cells in the absence of serum or IGFs (14Martin J.L. Pattison S.L. Endocrinology. 2000; 141: 2401-2409Google Scholar). In another cell model, T47D breast cancer cells transfected with IGFBP-3 cDNA were initially growth-inhibited by the expressed protein, but with increasing passage number became resistant to its growth-inhibitory effects, and were instead growth-stimulated by the endogenous IGFBP-3 (15Firth S.M. Fanayan S. Benn D. Baxter R.C. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 246: 325-329Google Scholar). Such observations of growth-stimulation by IGFBP-3 in breast cancer cells, although difficult to reconcile with the many reports of its antiproliferative actions, are consistent with clinical data, which indicate that IGFBP-3 may be associated with indicators of poor outcome. Thus, IGFBP-3 in breast tumors correlates inversely with estrogen receptor expression, and is positively associated with aneuploidy, S-phase fraction, and tumor size (16Rocha R.L. Hilsenbeck S.G. Jackson J.G. Lee A.V. Figueroa J.A. Yee D. J. Natl. Cancer Inst. 1996; 88: 601-606Google Scholar, 17Yu H. Levesque M.A. Khosravi M.J. Papanastasiou-Diamandi A. Clark G.M. Diamandis E.P. Br. J.

Levesque M.A. Khosravi M.J. Papanastasiou-Diamandi A. Clark G.M. Diamandis E.P. Int. J. Cancer. 1998; 79: 624-628Google Scholar). Although the significance of these associations is unclear, they imply that there may be changes in sensitivity to the effects of IGFBP-3 on breast epithelial cells in vivo, losing growth-inhibitory bioactivity and perhaps even accelerating tumor growth. While investigating mechanisms that may underlie IGFBP-3 insensitivity in breast cancer cells, we found that, whereas IGFBP-3 inhibits DNA synthesis in MCF-10A breast epithelial cells, this response is lost when the cells have undergone malignant transformation via expression of oncogenic Ras (20Martin J.L. Baxter R.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 16407-16411Google Scholar). Blockade of p44/42 MAP kinase-activation downstream of Ras restored IGFBP-3 sensitivity, implicating this pathway in the development of resistance to IGFBP-3. The present study was initiated to determine whether activation of Ras and the p44/42 MAP kinase pathway by epidermal growth factor (EGF), a potent mitogen for normal breast epithelial cells and many breast cancer cell lines, could similarly induce resistance to the inhibitory effects of IGFBP-3 in MCF-10A cells. We now report that IGFBP-3 enhanced the growth stimulatory effects of EGF in this cell line, and that the p44/42 and p38 MAP kinase pathways appear to be involved in this potentiation. Tissue culture reagents and plasticware were from Trace Biosciences (North Ryde, New South Wales, Australia) and Nunc (Roskilde, Denmark). Bovine serum albumin (BSA), bovine insulin, hydrocortisone, and EGF were purchased from Sigma, and cholera enterotoxin was from ICN Biomedicals Australasia (Seven Hills, New South Wales, Australia). Transforming growth factor-α (TGF-α) and heregulin (heregulin-β, EGF domain) were from Upstate Biotechnology, Inc. (Lake Placid, NY). Signaling pathway inhibitors were purchased from Calbiochem-Novabiochem (Alexandria, New South Wales, Australia): MEK inhibitor PD98059, PI 3-kinase inhibitor LY294002, and p38 MAP kinase inhibitor SB203580. Inhibitors were made up as 50 mmstock solutions in dimethyl sulfoxide, and stored at −20 °C. The following antibodies for Western blotting were purchased from Cell Signaling (Beverly, MA): phospho-Thr-202/Tyr-204 and total p44/42 MAP kinase; phospho-Ser-473 and total Akt; phospho-Thr-180/Tyr-182 and total p38 MAP kinase; phospho-Tyr-1068 EGFR and total EGFR. Natural human IGFBP-3 was purified from Cohn fraction IV of human plasma, as reported previously (21Martin J.L. Baxter R.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 8754-8760Google Scholar). Recombinant human IGFBP-3 and IGFBP-5 were expressed in human 911 retinoblastoma cells using an adenoviral expression system, and purified by IGF-I affinity chromatography and reverse-phase high performance liquid chromatography (22Firth S.M.

Electrophoresis and ECL reagents were purchased from Bio-Rad, Amrad-Pharmacia (Ryde, New South Wales, Australia), and Pierce. EGF and protein A were radiolabeled with 125I (ICN) using chloramine T. The MCF-10A cell line was a kind gift from Drs. Robert Pauley and Herbert Soule of the Karmanos Cancer Institute (Detroit, MI) (24Soule H.D. Maloney T.M. Wolman S.R. Peterson W.J. Brenz R.

Cells were maintained routinely in a 1:1 mixture of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/Ham's F-12 medium containing 15 mm Hepes, 5% horse serum, 10 μg/ml bovine insulin, 20 ng/ml EGF, 100 ng/ml cholera enterotoxin, and 0.5 μg/ml hydrocortisone (“growth medium”). Cultures were passaged every 5–7 days by trypsin/EDTA detachment and used between passages 158 and 165. DNA synthesis was assessed by incorporation of [methyl-3H]thymidine (Amersham, Bucks, United Kingdom). MCF-10A cells were dispensed into 48-well plates at 1 × 105 cells/well in growth medium, and incubated for 48 h. Cells were changed to serum-free medium (Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/F-12 containing 1 g/liter BSA) and incubated for 48 h prior to treatment. Test reagents (e.g. EGF, IGFBP-3) were added in 0.2 ml/well serum-free medium, and incubation was continued at 37 °C for another 24 h. For the final 4 h of this incubation period, 1 μCi/well [3H]thymidine was added in 25 μl of serum-free medium. Monolayers were rinsed with cold saline (9 g/liter NaCl) and fixed in cold methanol:acetic acid (3:1) for 2 h at 4 °C. Cells were solubilized in 0.4 ml of 1m NaOH, and lysates were mixed with 3 ml of OptimaGold (Packard Instrument Co., Meriden, CT) before counting for 1 min in a Hewlett-Packard β-counter. To measure cell proliferation, cells were dispensed into six-well plates at 5 × 105 cells/well in growth medium, allowed to attach for 24 h, then changed to serum-free medium as above. Reagents were added, and incubation continued for 7 days. Cells were trypsinized and counted using a hemacytometer. Cell-associated IGFBP-3 was determined immunologically, as described previously (25Martin J.L. Ballesteros M. Baxter R.C. Endocrinology. 1992; 131: 1703-1710Google Scholar). Briefly, media were removed from cell monolayers after treatment, and cells were washed twice with serum-free medium. Anti-IGFBP-3 antibody R30 was added to each well (final concentration, 1/5000 in serum-free medium), and incubation was continued overnight at 22 °C. Monolayers were washed as before, and then 125I-protein A was added to each well (20,000 cpm in 200 μl of serum-free medium) for 2 h at room temperature. Cells were washed and solubilized with 5 g/liter SDS before counting in a γ-counter. Binding of 125I-EGF to monolayers was carried out at 4 °C. Monolayers (with and without IGFBP-3 pretreatment) were washed, and 50,000 cpm 125I-EGF was added per well in 200 μl of serum-free medium, in the absence or presence of 100 ng/ml unlabeled EGF (to determine nonspecific binding). Incubation at 4 °C was continued for 2 h, after which cells were washed twice with ice-cold saline, solubilized in 5 g/liter SDS, and counted. Full displacement curves were generated by co-incubation of cells with 125I-EGF in the presence of 0.1–100 ng/ml unlabeled EGF under the same conditions. Cells were plated and grown in six-well plates as described above for cell proliferation assays. Pre-incubation with IGFBP-3 with or without inhibitors was performed when required for the second 24-h period of the 48-h serum-free incubation. Media were then removed and replaced by serum-free medium (1 ml/well) without or with EGF. Incubation was continued at 37 °C for 8 min, after which media were removed, and the monolayers were washed immediately in ice-cold saline, then solubilized in 500 μl of 2× SDS-PAGE sample buffer (62.5 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, containing 20 g/liter SDS, 100 ml/liter glycerol, 1 g/liter bromphenol blue, and 50 mmdithiothreitol) at 4 °C for 10 min. Lysates were scraped into cold Eppendorf tubes and frozen immediately at −80 °C. Prior to SDS-PAGE analysis, thawed lysates were sonicated for 15 s, heated at 90 °C for 10 min, cooled on ice, and then centrifuged at 15,000 rpm for 2 min. Prepared lysates were subjected to SDS-PAGE (7.5% separating gel for EGFR, 12% separating gel for p44/42, p38, and Akt) and electrophoretic transfer, as described previously (20Martin J.L. Baxter R.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 16407-16411Google Scholar). After transfer, filters were blocked in either 50 g/liter skim milk powder (for p44/42 and p38 MAPK) or 50 g/liter BSA (for EGFR and Akt) in Tris-buffered saline with Tween 20 (10 mm Tris, 150 mm NaCl, pH 7.4 containing 1 ml/liter Tween 20). Primary antibody incubation was carried out at 4 °C for 16 h, with antibodies diluted 1:1000 in blocking buffer. Filters were washed three times for 10 min each in cold Tris-buffered saline with Tween 20, and then incubated with the appropriate horseradish peroxidase-linked secondary antibody for 1–2 h at room temperature. Filters were washed as before and developed by enhanced chemiluminescence using Pierce reagents. Activity of p38 MAPK and p44/42 MAPK in lysates from IGFBP-3- and EGF-treated MCF-10A cells was determined by assessing phosphorylation of Elk-1 (for p44/42 MAPK) and Atf-2 (for p38 MAPK) using reagents from Cell Signaling (Beverley, MA). Confluent monolayers in six-well plates were preincubated with or without IGFBP-3 for 16 h and stimulated with EGF for 10 min. Cells were rinsed with ice-cold PBS, and lysed in 200 μl of cell lysis buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mmEDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 10 g/liter Triton X-100, 2.5 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 1 mm β-glycerol phosphate, 1 mm sodium vanadate, 1 μg/ml leupeptin) for 10 min at 4 °C. Lysates were scraped into Eppendorf tubes on ice and sonicated four times for 10 s each, then clarified by centrifugation at 15,000 rpm for 10 min at 4 °C. Supernatants (200 μl containing 200 μg of protein) were transferred to fresh Eppendorf tubes, and phospho-p44/42 MAPK (Thr-202/Tyr-204) and phospho-p38 MAPK (Thr-180/Tyr-182) immunoprecipitated overnight at 4 °C using phosphospecific antibodies immobilized onto agarose hydrazide beads (Cell Signaling). Beads were washed twice with 500 μl of cell lysis buffer, once with kinase buffer (25 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 5 mm β-glycerol phosphate, 2 mmdithiothreitol, 0.1 mm sodium vanadate, 100 mmMgCl2), and resuspended in 50 μl of kinase buffer. Two micrograms of recombinant Elk-1 or Atf-2 was added to tubes containing the relevant kinase, with ATP to a final concentration of 200 μm. Phosphorylation reactions were carried out over 30 min at 30 °C and terminated by addition of 25 μl of 3× Laemmli sample buffer (187.5 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 60 g/liter SDS, 30% glycerol, 150 mm dithiothreitol) and boiling for 5 min. Samples were vortexed, centrifuged for 2 min, and then loaded onto 10% polyacrylamide gels for Western analysis using antibodies against phosphorylated Elk-1 (Ser-383) or phosphorylated Atf-2 (Thr-71). All experiments were performed a minimum of two times and are shown as data pooled from the two experiments, unless indicated otherwise. Significance on pooled data was determined by analysis of variance using the Statview package for Macintosh. We have shown previously that, in the absence of exogenous growth factors, IGFBP-3 is inhibitory to DNA synthesis in MCF-10A breast epithelial cells over 24 h, but that constitutive up-regulation of Ras-MAPK signaling abolishes the growth-inhibitory effect of IGFBP-3 (20Martin J.L. Baxter R.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 16407-16411Google Scholar). Because EGF stimulates activation of the Ras-MAPK pathway in these cells (data not shown), we therefore investigated whether it similarly affected their growth response to IGFBP-3. As shown in Fig. 1 A, EGF is a potent stimulator of DNA synthesis in MCF-10A cells over 24 h, with a significant effect apparent with 0.1 ng/ml EGF. In the absence of EGF, natural human IGFBP-3 inhibited DNA synthesis in MCF-10A cells, as reported previously (20Martin J.L. Baxter R.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 16407-16411Google Scholar) (data not shown). However, IGFBP-3 enhanced the stimulatory effect of low concentrations (0.1 and 1 ng/ml) of EGF (Fig. 1 A), with a significant and maximal effect at 10 ng/ml IGFBP-3. The potentiating effect of IGFBP-3 was lost at high (10 ng/ml) EGF concentrations (Fig. 1 A). The effects of IGFBP-3 and EGF on cell proliferation were determined over 7 days in the absence of serum or other exogenous growth factors. EGF alone (1 ng/ml) increased cell number by ∼30% compared with untreated cultures (p < 0.05, Fig. 1 B), and this was enhanced in a dose-dependent manner by 10 and 100 ng/ml IGFBP-3. Final cell numbers in MCF-10A cultures treated with EGF and 100 ng/ml IGFBP-3 were increased by 40% relative to control (p < 0.001). IGFBP-3 shares many structural and functional features with another IGF-binding protein, IGFBP-5 (26Baxter R.C. Adv. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 1997; 1: 123-159Google Scholar). Therefore, we investigated whether IGFBP-5 was also able to potentiate EGF action in MCF-10A cells, using purified recombinant human IGFBP-5 expressed in an adenoviral expression system. As shown in Fig. 2 A, adenovirus-derived recombinant human IGFBP-3 (adIGFBP-3) enhanced EGF-stimulated DNA synthesis similarly to plasma-derived IGFBP-3, with a significant effect at 1 ng/ml, and maximal enhancement at 10 ng/ml. In the absence of EGF, adIGFBP-5 had no significant effect on DNA synthesis in MCF-10A cells (data not shown). By contrast with adIGFBP-3, adIGFBP-5 did not potentiate EGF-stimulated DNA synthesis, and in fact was slightly inhibitory at low concentrations in the presence of EGF (Fig. 2 B). We then investigated whether a recombinant human IGFBP-3 mutant that exhibits decreased cell binding and nuclear import (27Firth S.M. Ganeshprasad U. Baxter R.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 2631-2638Google Scholar, 28Schedlich L.J. Young T.F. Firth S.M. Baxter R.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 18347-18352Google Scholar) retains EGF potentiating activity. This mutant, IGFBP-3(mut), has 5 residues in the basic domain in the C-terminal region of IGFBP-3 substituted with the analogous sequence of IGFBP-1, i.e. 228KGRKR → MDGEA. Exogenous IGFBP-3(mut) showed significantly decreased cell association compared with wild type IGFBP-3 in MCF-10A cells (Fig. 2 C), similar to that shown previously for endogenous mutant protein in Chinese hamster ovary cells (27Firth S.M. Ganeshprasad U. Baxter R.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 2631-2638Google Scholar). However, in MCF-10A cells some binding was evident at high concentrations of IGFBP-3(mut), with a significant increase in cell-associated IGFBP-3 detected with 1000 ng/ml IGFBP-3(mut), comparable to the binding of 100 ng/ml wild type IGFBP-3 (Fig. 2 C). In the presence of EGF, IGFBP-3(mut) enhanced DNA synthesis to a degree similar to that for adIGFBP-3 (Fig. 2 D), suggesting that the potentiating effect of IGFBP-3 occurs in the absence of its nuclear localization and under conditions where its cell association is markedly reduced. The ability of IGFBP-3 to enhance the effects of other growth factors in MCF-10A cells was then investigated. TGF-α, which binds and activates the EGF receptor (also known as ErbB1), stimulated DNA synthesis in MCF-10A cells (Fig. 3 A). The stimulation caused by 1 ng/ml TGF-α (∼40%) was increased to ∼120% in the presence 100 ng/ml IGFBP-3 (Fig. 3 B). As observed for EGF, the level of potentiation by IGFBP-3 decreased with increasing concentrations of TGF-α, so that with 10 ng/ml TGF-α, DNA synthesis was increased only an additional 20% by IGFBP-3 (Fig. 3 C). To examine whether IGFBP-3 enhanced the effects of hormones that act through other members of the EGF receptor/ErbB family, we tested its effects on DNA synthesis stimulated by heregulin, which binds the EGF receptor family members ErbB3 and ErbB4. In the absence of IGFBP-3, heregulin stimulated DNA synthesis in MCF-10A cells (Fig. 3 D), with the maximum dose tested, 25 ng/ml, inducing a 12-fold increase in DNA synthesis. The stimulatory effects of low (0.3 ng/ml, Fig. 3 E) or high (10 ng/ml, Fig. 3 F) heregulin were not enhanced significantly by IGFBP-3. IGFBP-3 had no effect on DNA synthesis stimulated by platelet-derived growth factor or long-[Arg3]IGF-I, an IGF analog with affinity for IGF receptors but not IGFBPs (data not shown). To determine whether co-incubation of IGFBP-3 and EGF was necessary for potentiation, MCF-10A cells were preincubated with IGFBP-3 for 24 h prior to its removal, then EGF was added for an additional 24 h. As shown in Fig. 4, pre-exposure to IGFBP-3 resulted in a similar degree of enhancement of EGF-stimulated DNA synthesis to that seen when EGF and IGFBP-3 were added together for 24 h, suggesting that preincubation with IGFBP-3 sensitizes MCF-10A cells to EGF. We then investigated the effect of IGFBP-3 preincubation on subsequent binding of EGF to cell monolayers. Cells were preincubated with or without IGFBP-3 for 16 h, and then binding of 125I-EGF to cells over 2 h at 4 °C was determined. As shown in Fig. 5 A, the amount of125I-EGF bound to MCF-10A cells was not changed by pre-exposing the cells to IGFBP-3, and displacement curves generated by incubating cells with tracer in the presence of unlabeled EGF were superimposable in IGFBP-3-pretreated and untreated cells. These data suggest that exposure to IGFBP-3 does not alter EGF receptor affinity or number. The effects of IGFBP-3 on EGFR activation were then examined by assessing Tyr-1068-phosphorylated EGFR in cells pretreated with IGFBP-3 and then exposed to EGF for 5, 15, or 60 min. In the absence of IGFBP-3 pretreatment, EGF-stimulated phosphorylation of EGFR was apparent within 5 min (Fig. 5 B); there was no effect of IGFBP-3 on the degree of receptor phosphorylation at this time point. However in cells pretreated for 24 h with either 10 or 100 ng/ml IGFBP-3, EGFR phosphorylation was increased relative to non-preincubated cells within 15 min of exposure to EGF (Fig. 5 B). The enhancing effect of IGFBP-3 on receptor phosphorylation was transitory, being lost within 60 min after addition of EGF. Analysis of data from two similar experiments confirmed that pre-exposure to IGFBP-3 significantly enhanced EGF-stimulated phosphorylation of the EGFR at Tyr-1068 (Fig. 5 C). IGFBP-3 tested over similar doses, but without subsequent exposure to EGF, did not stimulate phospho-EGFR (data not shown). Next, we examined whether IGFBP-3 modulates EGF activation of intracellular signaling, targeting particularly some pathways downstream of the EGFR. MCF-10A cells were preincubated with IGFBP-3 for 24 h and then exposed to EGF for 8 min. Cell lysates were analyzed by Western blot using phosphospecific antibodies directed against p44/42 MAPK, Akt, and p38 MAPK. In the absence of EGF, there was no detectable phosphorylation of p44/42 or Akt, whereas a low level of phosphorylation of p38 MAPK was apparent (Fig. 6 A). Phosphorylation of each of these signaling intermediates was stimulated within 8 min of treatment with 1 ng/ml EGF. Pre-incubation with IGFBP-3 had no affect on phosphorylation of Akt in response to EGF, but EGF-induced phosphorylation of p44/42 MAPK and p38 MAPK was enhanced by pre-incubation with IGFBP-3 with a maximal effect apparent between 8 and 15 min of EGF stimulation. Densitometric analysis of these data (Fig. 6 B) indicated that IGFBP-3 enhanced EGF-stimulated phosphorylation of p44/42 MAPK and p38 MAPK by ∼2-fold and 30%, respectively. Analysis of lysates from cells stimulated for 1, 4, 8, 12, 18, and 24 h with EGF indicated that, although IGFBP-3 preincubation increased the magnitude of p44/42 and p38 MAP kinase phosphorylation stimulated by EGF at early time points, this was not sustained. Within 1 h of EGF treatment, phosphorylation of p44/42 and p38 MAP kinases had returned to basal levels, regardless of whether there had been pre-incubation with IGFBP-3 (data not shown). A second smaller peak of phosphorylation of p38 MAP kinase, but not p44/42 MAP kinase, was apparent 18 h after addition of EGF, but this was not enhanced in IGFBP-3-preincubated cells. The effect of IGFBP-3 preincubation on EGF-stimulated p44/42 and p38 MAP kinase activity was then assessed using in vitrophosphorylation of substrates for these enzymes, Elk-1 and Atf-2, as markers of kinase activity. As shown in Fig. 7, lysates prepared from MCF-10A cells treated for 10 min with EGF showed increased activity of both p44/42 and p38 MAP kinases. The activity of both kinases was enhanced further in lysates from cells incubated with 10 or 100 ng/ml IGFBP-3 prior to exposure to EGF, indicating that IGFBP-3 potentiates EGF-stimulated p44/42 and p38 MAP kinase activity. To determine the involvement of these pathways in the growth potentiating effects of IGFBP-3 on EGF action, we examined whether attenuation of the p44/42 MAPK or p38 MAPK signaling pathways altered the ability of IGFBP-3 to enhance the effects of EGF. MCF-10A cells were co-incubated for 24 h with IGFBP-3 and EGF in the presence of inhibitors of MEK upstream of p44/42 MAP kinase (PD98059), Akt (LY294002), or p38 MAPK (SB203580). DNA synthesis was determined after 24 h. The dose of inhibitors used in these experiments was intentionally submaximal, because concentrations high enough to block signaling fully through these pathways were cytotoxic over 24 h. As shown in Table I, the doses used were sufficient to abolish the stimulatory effect of EGF on DNA synthesis, and Western blot analysis confirmed that these concentrations were sufficient to reduce the IGFBP-3-induced enhancement of EGF-stimulated ph"

The number and location of the glycosaminoglycan attachment sites in the core protein were determined by eukaryotic expression of full-length chick collagen XVIII and site-directed mutagenesis. Three Ser-Gly consensus sequences carrying glycosaminoglycan side chains were detected in the middle and N-terminal part of the core protein. One of the Ser-Gly consensus sequences carried a heparan sulfate side chain, and the remaining two had mixed chondroitin and heparan sulfate side chains; thus, recombinant collagen XVIII was a hybrid of heparan sulfate and chondroitin proteoglycan. In contrast, collagen XVIII from all chick tissues so far assayed have exclusively heparan sulfate side chains, indicating that the posttranslational modification of proteins expressed in vitro is not entirely identical to the processing that occurs in a living embryo.

Collagen XVIII came into the public spotlight by the discovery that the C-terminal peptide of collagen XVIII, named endostatin, has anti-angiogenic and anti-tumor activities (3O'Reilly M.S. Boehm T.

The anti-angiogenic activity of the peptide led to the idea that collagen XVIII might be involved in the development of the vascular system. The targeted deletion of collagen XVIII in mice (5Fukai N.

The polysaccharide chains are connected to the core proteins through serine of the Ser-Gly (SG) consensus sequence whereby the presence of nearby acidic amino acids and the repetition of SGs are factors that promote attachment of glycosaminoglycan (GAG) side chains and favor synthesis of heparan sulfate (HS) over chondroitin sulfate (CS) side chains (16Zhang L. Esko J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 19295-19299Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar,17Zhang L. David G. Esko J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 22127-22135Google Scholar). Although the locations of HS chains in syndecan and glypican have been determined (16Zhang L. Esko J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 19295-19299Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 17Zhang L. David G. Esko J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 22127-22135Google Scholar), their locations in agrin and collagen XVIII are unknown. In this study, we expressed the full-length chick collagen XVIII and determined the number and locations of the GAG chains. Our results showed that the GAG glycosylation was affected by cell culture conditions such as the presence or absence of fetal calf serum, and the preference for attachment of HS and CS was determined by the consensus sequence. To obtain cDNA sequences covering the entire length of collagen XVIII, a 2.4-kb chick collagen XVIII 3′ cDNA (p10d; Ref.10Halfter W. Dong S. Schurer B. Cole G.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 25404-25412Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar) was extended by nested PCR from a random-primed E6 chick amnion library (λ-ZapII; Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). The nucleotide sequence of the T3 or T7 promoter from the library vector was used as the forward primer, and two nucleotide sequences designed from the internal 5′ cDNA sequences of p10d were used as the reverse and nested reverse primer. The first round of PCR contained 4 μl of supernatant of the boiled and centrifuged library (2 × 1010plaque-forming unit/ml) and elongase mix as the DNA polymerase (Invitrogen) in a total volume of 40 μl. Bands with the expected molecular weights were extracted from a 1% agarose gel and re-amplified in the second round of PCR with the T7 or T3 forward primer and the nested reverse primer. The second round of PCR was carried out using Pfu turbo DNA polymerase (Stratagene) following the recommendations provided by the manufacturer. The re-amplified DNA was extracted from the agarose gel, ligated into pPCR-Script AMP SK(+) vector, and transformed into Epicurian coli (Ep. coli)XL 10-Gold ultracompetent cells using the PCR-Script AMP cloning kit (Stratagene). Plasmids from white colonies were purified and sequenced in the University of Pittsburgh Sequencing Facility. The sequences were analyzed using the Sequencer software (DNA Codes Inc., Ann Arbor, MI) and compared with published databases using the Blast search algorithm (17Zhang L. David G. Esko J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 22127-22135Google Scholar). The amino acid sequence was deduced from the DNA sequence using Sequencher. Three clones were obtained (P53T7P64, P12T7P21, INT2T7ANTI22) that covered the remaining collagen XVIII cDNA. The three PCR clones obtained by nested PCR and the previously obtained p10d were connected by PCR to obtain a cDNA for the full-length coding sequence of chick collagen XVIII. The reaction contained 0.07 pmol each of the DNA segments, a forward primer (5′-TTCGCTAGCTGAGCCCGAGAACCTGAGC-3′) that contains an NheI cutting site in addition to 3 nucleotides to protect the cutting site at 5′ end, and a reverse primer (5′-TCTCGAGCTCATTTTTTGGCGGCAGTCATG-3′) that contains a XhoI cutting site and 4 protection nucleotides at the 5′ end. The PCR was carried out using Pfuturbo DNA polymerase. The cycling condition was 94 °C for 1 min and 72 °C for 7 min for 2 cycles; 94 °C for 1 min, 55 °C for 1 min, and 72 °C for 6 min for 2 cycles; and 94 °C for 1 min and 72 °C for 7 min for 30 cycles, following denaturing at 94 °C for 3 min. A 4-kilobase band extracted from the 1% agarose gels was ligated into pPCR-Script AMP SK(+) vector and transformed intoEp. coli XL 10-Gold ultracompetent cells as described above. One of the clones (Full-12) contained the complete chick collagen XVIII-coding sequence, as confirmed by DNA sequencing. The oligonucleotides used to generate the mutant constructs are shown in TableI. Site-directed mutagenesis was carried out on the Full-12 cDNA clone using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). Briefly, a mutated duplicate of the original plasmid was produced by PCR using Pfu DNA polymerase and primers containing the desired mutation. After digestion of the original plasmid by DpnI, Ep. coli XL 10-Gold ultracompetent cells were transformed with the nicked plasmid, which contains the desired mutation.Table IMutagenic oligonucleotides for site-directed mutagenesis of chick collagen XVIIINames Oligonucleotide sequence (from 5′ to 3′)Forward primer 2GAT GAC GCC GAG GCA GCT GGA GAT TTC GReverse primer 2CGA AAT CTC CAG CTG CCT CGG CGT CAT CForward primer 3CAT CTG GAG ATT TCG GCG CCG GGG CAG AGG ACA GReverse primer 3CTG TCC TCT GCC CCG GCG CCG AAA TCT CCA GAT GForward primer 4GAC AGG CAT CAT CCC GCA GGG AAG GAT AAG GReverse primer 4CCT TAT CCT TCC CTGCGG GAT GAT GCC TGT CForward primer 7CAT TGA CAT GGA GGG CGC TGG GTT CGG TGG TGReverse primer 7CAC CAC CGA ACC CAG CGC CCT CCA TGT CAA TGForward primer 8GGT GAC ATG GAA GGC GCT GGG CTG CCA CTT GCReverse primer 8GCA AGT GGC AGC CCA GCG CCT TCC ATG TCA CCMismatches with the template are indicated by boldface letters.

Plasmid from Full-12 and the mutated Full-12 clones were digested with NheI and XhoI (New England Biolabs, Beverly, MA) and de-phosphorylated with alkaline phosphatase (0.05 units/pmol ends; Roche Molecular Biochemicals). The digested and de-phosphorylated DNA inserts were isolated from 1% agarose gels and ligated into an NheI-andXhoI-digested pCEP-PU expression vector (Ref. 18Kohfeldt E. Maurer P. Vannahme C. Timpl R. FEBS Lett. 1997; 414: 557-561Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar; kindly provided by Dr. Mats Paulsson, University of Cologne, Germany). The plasmid contains a BM40 signal peptide sequence, puromycin-resistant gene, Myc and histidine tags, and a Factor X digestion site at the N terminus. 293-EBNA cells (Invitrogen) and chick meningeal cells were transfected with the constructs using LipofectAMINE (Invitrogen). Stably transfected 293-EBNA cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, 10% fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen), 1 mmascorbic acid, 1% glutamine-penicillin-streptomycin, 350 μg/ml G418, and 1 μg/ml puromycin (Sigma), and transiently transfected chick meningeal cells were cultured for 5 days in the culture medium without G418 and puromycin. Cell culture supernatants (10 ml) were collected after 24 h of incubation and applied to a Q-Sepharose column (2 ml; Amersham Biosciences) equilibrated with 0.05 mphosphate buffer (PB) containing 0.15 m NaCl, pH 7.2, to absorb the collagen XVIII. The columns were washed with PB containing 0.15 m NaCl (10 ml). Non-glycosylated collagen XVIII was eluted with 0.5 m NaCl in PB (10 ml), and the glycosylated version was eluted with 1.5 m NaCl in PB (10 ml). Fractions containing collagen XVIII were combined and concentrated to 0.5 ml using ultrafree-50 centrifugal filter devices (Millipore, Bedford, MA) and dialyzed against Hanks' solution before stored at −80 °C. Vitreous body was collected from E5-E7 chick eyes and centrifuged at 15,000 rpm for 5 min. Recombinant collagen XVIII was purified by Q-Sepharose chromatography as described above and dialyzed against calcium- and magnesium-free Hanks' solution. The samples were subjected to 3.5–15% SDS-PAGE under reducing conditions. Some of the samples were also run under non-reducing conditions and without boiling the sample. The proteins were transferred onto nitrocellulose (Millipore), and the blots were probed with 6C4, a monoclonal antibody to the NC1 domain of chick collagen XVIII (10Halfter W. Dong S. Schurer B. Cole G.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 25404-25412Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar, 19Halfter W. Schurer B. Exp. Cell Res. 1994; 214: 285-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). The proteins were visualized using alkaline phosphatase-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (Jackson ImmunoResearch, West Grove PA) and 4-nitro blue tetrazolium and 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) as coloring reagents. 30 μl of Q-Sepharose-purified recombinant collagen XVIII and 30 μl of vitreous body supernatant were used for the digestion. For collagenase treatment, samples were dialyzed against sodium phosphate buffer (50 mm) containing 0.15 m NaCl (phosphate-buffered saline), pH 7.4, and incubated with 5 milliunits/μl collagenase (Sigma type VII) and 2% bovine serum albumin at 37 °C for 1 h. For heparitinase digestion, the samples were dialyzed against phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.0, containing 3 mm CaCl2 and treated with 0.125 milliunits/μl heparitinase (Seikagaku, Rockville, MA) at 37 °C for 2 h. For chondroitinase treatment, the samples were dialyzed against phosphate-buffered saline, pH 8.0, and treated with 0.131 milliunits/μl chondroitinase ABC (Seikagaku) at 37 °C for 2 h. For mixed digestion, the samples were dialyzed against phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.5, containing 3 mmCaCl2 and treated with a mixture of heparitinase (0.125 milliunits/μl) and chondroitinase ABC (0.131 milliunits/μl). Northern blotting was performed as described previously (10Halfter W. Dong S. Schurer B. Cole G.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 25404-25412Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar). Briefly, total RNA was isolated from E7-E10 chick brain, embryo, liver, and kidney using TRIzol Reagent (Invitrogen). Poly(A)+ RNA was purified using PolyATrac mRNA isolation system IV (Promega, Madison WI), and samples of 2 μg of poly(A)+ RNA were separated in 1% agarose gels containing 2.2m formaldehyde, transferred to positively charged nylon membranes (Immobilon N Millipore), and cross-linked with UV. Digoxigenin-labeled cRNA hybridization probe was synthesized from the linearized P12T7P21 collagen XVIII clone template using the RNA-polymerase labeling kit (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). The digoxigenin-labeled cRNA hybridized blot was visualized using alkaline phosphatase-conjugated anti-digoxigenin Fab fragment with CSPD® ready-to-use chemiluminescent substrates (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). RNA molecular weight marker II (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) was used to determine the size of the collagen XVIII mRNA. A PAP-pen (EMS, Washington, PA) was used to circle an ∼1-cm2 area of a plastic dish coated with nitrocellulose (20Lagenaur C. Lemmon V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 7753-7757Crossref PubMed Scopus (395) Google Scholar). The hydrophobic ring reduces the volume of the incubation solutions to less than 100 μl. Retinal basement membranes were isolated from E6 chick retinae as flat sheets within the encircled areas of the dishes as described (25Halfter W. Reckhaus W. Kroger S. J. Neurosci. 1987; 7: 3712-3722Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The basement membranes were incubated in 2% Triton X-100 for 1 h to remove cellular debris, and the basement membranes with the surrounding plastic were blocked with 1% bovine serum albumin in 0.2% Triton. The samples were incubated with the supernatant from the transfected EBNA cells for 2 h. After washing in calcium- and magnesium-free Hanks' solution, the preparations were incubated with a monoclonal antibody to the Myc epitope (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) for 1 h, washed, and visualized with a Cy-3-labeled goat-anti-mouse secondary antibody. Binding of collagen XVIII to tissues were done by incubating sections of paraformaldehyde-fixed heads of the E6 chick embryo with the cell culture supernatants. A cDNA clone (p10d) for chick collagen XVIII was previously obtained by conventional screening an E5 chick yolk sac library with the 6C4 monoclonal antibody. It covers 2.4 kb of the 3′ end of collagen XVIII with 1.24 kb of the 3′-untranslated region (10Halfter W. Dong S. Schurer B. Cole G.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 25404-25412Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar). To extend the sequence in 5′ direction, we sequentially amplified three collagen XVIII cDNAs from a randomly primed amnion library using a PCR procedure. Taking the T3 or T7 primer of the library vector as a forward primer and a specific reverse primer from the 5′ end of p10d, we amplified two DNA bands in the first round of PCR with the T3 primer and five bands with the T7 primer. In the second round of PCR using the nested reverse primer, only two DNA bands were obtained with the T7 primer. These bands were slightly smaller in size than the DNA bands from the first round of PCR, as expected from the close proximity of the specific reverse primer and the nested reverse primer. One of the DNA sequences, named INT2T7ANTI22, was homologous to human and mouse collagen XVIII cDNA. The INT2T7ANTI22 clone contained a 1270-bp insert and overlapped with p10d by 150 bp. We repeated the procedure using a specific reverse primer and a nested reverse primer designed from INT2T7ANTI22 to obtain P12T7P21 and then from P12T7P21 to obtain P53T7P64. Both P12T7P21 and P53T7P64 overlapped with their respective 3′ predecessors (Fig. 1). The deduced amino acid sequence of P53T7P64 contained the starting Met codon and a 26-residue signal peptide. A continuous chick collagen XVIII cDNA sequence was obtained by the alignment of P53T7P64, P12T7P21, INT2T7ANTI22, and p10d. The sequence contained 5279 bp with an open reading frame of 4032 bp (Fig. 1) that corresponded to the short version of human and mouse collagen XVIII α1. The sequence is deposited in the NCBI gene bank under the access number AF083440. The deduced protein sequence from the cDNA of chick collagen XVIII α1 chain is 1344 amino acids long, with the first 26 amino acid residues comprising the signal peptide. The chick sequence is slightly longer than the human (1336) and mouse (1315) short variants (Ref. 21Saarela J. Ylikarppa R. Rehn M. Purmonen S. Pihlajaniemi T. Matrix Biol. 1998; 16: 319-328Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar; Fig. 1). Between chick and human, the overall identity is 61%, and the homology is 71%, lower than those between human and mouse of 75 and 95%, respectively. Like the human counterpart, chick collagen XVIII consists of 11 non-collagenous (NC) domains, which are separated by 10 collagenous domains (COL). The N-terminal COL-10 is 71 amino acid residues long with 2 imperfections in the GXY repeats, whereas the corresponding COL-10 in human collagen XVIII is 25 residues (21Saarela J. Ylikarppa R. Rehn M. Purmonen S. Pihlajaniemi T. Matrix Biol. 1998; 16: 319-328Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Six cysteine residues are present in chick collagen XVIII, two of which are located in NC11, and four are located in the endostatin domain of NC1. The presence of cysteine residues was conserved between chick and human. A potential N-linked glycosylation site located in COL8 was conserved between chick and human. Another potential N-linked glycosylation site, present at the beginning of the NC11, was not conserved. There are eight potential GAG glycosylation sites in chick collagen XVIII, three of which are in fact GAG attachment sites (see below). In human and mouse tissues, the mRNAs of collagen XVIII α1 exist in a short and a long splice variant, with the long version occurring prominently in liver (1Oh S.P. Kamagata Y. Muragaki Y. Timmons S. Ooshima A. Olsen B.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 4229-4233Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar, 9Saarela J. Rehn M. Oikarinen A. Autio-Harmainen H. Pihlajaniemi T.

Matrix Biol. 1998; 16: 319-328Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Attempts to obtain the long version by rapid amplification of cDNA 5′ ends using poly(A)+ RNAs from chick E6–7 liver and kidney tissues failed (data not shown). The absence of the long collagen XVIII splice variant in chick was confirmed by Northern blot analysis: poly(A)+ RNAs from E6–7 chick liver, kidney, heart, and brain probed with a cRNA probe synthesized from the 5′ clone P12T7P21 (see Fig. 1) showed a single band of 5.5 kb (Fig. 2). The finding was consistent with the previous Northern blots probed with the 3′ p10d cRNA probe (see Fig. 1), that also showed a single band at 5.5 kb (10Halfter W. Dong S. Schurer B. Cole G.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 25404-25412Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar). Using P53T7P64, P12T7P21, INT2T7ANTI22, and p10d as templates and nucleotide sequences from the 5′ and 3′ end of the collagen XVIII-coding sequence as primers, we obtained a continuous cDNA for collagen XVIII by PCR and cloned the cDNA into an expression vector. The expression construct was stably transfected into EBNA T293 cells, and the expressed protein was isolated from the cell culture supernatant using Q-Sepharose. The fraction eluted with 0.5m NaCl contained non-glycosylated collagen XVIII core protein with an apparent molecular mass of 187 kDa. The GAG-free core protein accounted for less than 5% of total expressed collagen XVIII. The high salt fraction eluted from the ion exchanger contained GAG-glycosylated collagen XVIII, which appeared as a smear with an average molecular mass of 350 kDa (Fig. 3, lane 3). In some batches a small portion of non-glycosylated core protein in the high salt fraction was also detectable. When non-reduced, unboiled samples were loaded onto the gels, the recombinant collagen XVIII appeared as a smear with a molecular mass between 187 and 1000 kDa (Fig. 3,lane 4). The main part of the smear showed a molecular mass between 700 and 1000 kDa, identical to the size of non-reduced, unboiled collagen XVIII from vitreous body (Fig. 3, lane 2). It most likely represents the homotrimer of the collagen XVIII α1 chain (10Halfter W. Dong S. Schurer B. Cole G.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 25404-25412Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar). The lower part of the smear migrated at the same position as the boiled and reduced collagen XVIII from vitreous body and most likely represents the collagen XVIII monomer. The presence of monomer in recombinant collagen XVIII indicates that trimerization is incomplete. Collagen XVIII expressed in serum-free medium contained a higher proportion of core protein, and mobility of the GAG-glycosylated product on SDS-PAGE was higher on average (Fig. 3, lane 5) than that expressed in the presence of serum (Fig. 3, lane 3). It indicates that serum in the culture medium not only promoted the degree of glycosylation of collagen XVIII but also affected the length or negative charge of the GAG side chains. To prove the collagenous nature of the expressed collagen XVIII, we digested samples with collagenase and found that the protein was degraded to several fragments. The molecular mass of the main fragment was 35 kDa (Fig. 4, lane 4), identical to the size of the dominant, collagenase-resistant fragment of vitreous body collagen XVIII (Fig. 4, lane 2). The fact that the band was recognized by the NC1-specific 6C4 monoclonal antibody and the size of band was identical to that of collagen XVIII NC1 confirmed that the fragment is the NC1 domain. To test collagenase for potential protease contamination, vitreous body samples were treated with collagenase and probed with an anti-tenascin antibody. Tenascin, a 220-kDa non-collagenous protein, was not degraded by the collagenase (Fig. 4, lanes 5 and 6), showing that the collagenase preparations were free of proteases. Collagen XVIII expressed in EBNA cells was proteolytically very sensitive. The degradation fragments on the blots ranged from 51 to 75 kDa (Fig. 3, lane 3, and Fig. 4, lane 3). Based on their reactivity with the 6C4 monoclonal antibody, they were from the C-terminal part of the molecule. To prevent degradation, we added a mixture of commercially available protease inhibitors including 3 μm aprotinin, 50 μm cathepsin B inhibitor II (Calbiochem), 100 μm E-64, 50 μmleupeptin, and 100 μm pepstatin into cell culture medium and the solutions used for Q-Sepharose chromatography. The presence of inhibitors resulted in slightly different degradation fragments; however, the average intensity and size of the bands were roughly the same as those from collagen XVIII expressed without protease inhibitors present (data not shown). Cathepsin B inhibitor II and E64, which have been reported to inhibit the release of endostatin at the C terminus (27Felbor U. Dreier L. Bryant R.A.L. Ploegh H.L. Olsen B.R. Mothes W. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 1187-1194Crossref PubMed Scopus (405) Google Scholar), was not effective in preventing degradation of the whole molecule. In addition, the results showed that the yield of collagen XVIII increased with longer incubation periods; however, at the same time, the degradation of collagen XVIII increased even more. As a compromise, we collected the culture supernatant for purification in 24-h intervals. Similar to the highly glycosylated collagen XVIII from vitreous, amnion, kidney, and meninges (10Halfter W. Dong S. Schurer B. Cole G.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 25404-25412Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar), recombinant collagen XVIII appeared in Western blots as a smear with an apparent molecular mass of 350 kDa (Fig. 5 A, lane 1). Treatment with heparitinase caused a slight decrease in size to 320 kDa and the appearance of a faint band in the size of the core protein at 187 kDa (Fig. 5 A, lane 2). When treated with chondroitinase ABC, the size of protein shifted to 240 kDa and the core protein band of 187 kDa became more prominent (Fig. 5 A, lane 4). When treated with a mixture of heparitinase and chondroitinase, the recombinant protein appeared as two sharp, overlapping bands with molecular mass round 187 kDa, showing that the recombinant collagen XVIII expressed in 293-"

We report a Triassic deposit in southwestern Britain that contains spherules and shocked quartz, characteristic of an impact ejecta layer. Inter- and intragranular potassium feldspar from the deposit yields an argon-argon age of 214 ± 2.5 million years old. This is within the age range of several known Triassic impact craters, the two closest of which, both in age and location, are Manicouagan in northeastern Canada and Rochechouart in central France. The ejecta deposit provides an important sedimentary record of an extraterrestrial impact in the Mesozoic that will help to decipher the number and effect of impact events, the source and dynamics of the event that left this distinctive sedimentary marker, and the relation of this ejecta layer to the timing of extinctions in the fossil record."
https://openalex.org/W2066291735,"In normal epithelial cells, transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) typically causes growth arrest in the G1 phase of the cell cycle and may eventually lead to apoptosis. However, transformed cells lose these inhibitory responses and often instead show an increase in malignant character following TGF-β treatment. In the canine kidney-derived epithelial cell line, MDCK, synergism between activation of the Raf/MAPK pathway and the resulting autocrine production of TGF-β triggers transition from an epithelial to a mesenchymal phenotype. During this process, these cells become refractive to TGF-β-induced cell cycle arrest and apoptosis. TGF-β signals are primarily transduced to the nucleus through complexes of receptor-regulated Smads, Smad2 and Smad3 with the common mediator Smad, Smad4. Here we show that the transition from an epithelial to mesenchymal phenotype is accompanied by gradual down-regulation of expression of Smad3. Restoration of Smad3 to previous levels of expression restores the cell cycle arrest induced by TGF-β without reverting the cells to an epithelial phenotype or impacting on the MAPK pathway. Regulation of apoptosis is not affected by Smad3 levels. These data attribute to Smad3 a critical role in the control of cell proliferation by TGF-β, which is lost following an epithelial to mesenchymal transition.

At early stages, it acts as a tumor suppressor primarily through its ability to induce growth arrest and apoptosis in epithelial cells from which the majority of human tumors are derived. However, as tumors progress, they frequently become resistant to the growth inhibitory and pro-apoptotic effects of TGF-β, and at late stages, TGF-β acts as a tumor promoter. It acts directly on tumor cells to enhance epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT), increase motility, invasiveness, and metastasis and acts indirectly on the surrounding stroma to enhance angiogenesis and decrease immune surveillance (1Akhurst R.J. Derynck R. Trends Cell Biol. 2001; 11: S44-S51Google Scholar, 2Derynck R. Ackhurst R.J. Balmain A. Nat. Genet. 2001; 29: 117-129Google Scholar, 3Wakefield L.M. Roberts A.B. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 2002; 12: 22-29Google Scholar). We previously described a model tissue culture system that exhibits certain parallels to the process of tumorigenesis with respect to the role of TGF-β signaling (4Lehmann K. Janda E. Pierreux C.E. Rytömaa M. Schulze A. McMahon M. Hill C.S. Beug H. Downward J. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 2610-2622Google Scholar). Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cells are an untransformed immortalized dog kidney epithelial cell line that are characterized by the formation of a simple monolayer of cells with high electrical resistance across it and the expression of epithelial markers such as E-cadherin and ZO-1, which are components of adherens and tight junctions (5Hay E.D. Acta Anat. 1995; 154: 8-20Google Scholar). The activation in these cells of the Raf/ERK MAPK pathway by an inducible Raf construct, ΔRaf-ER, causes autocrine expression of TGF-β (4Lehmann K. Janda E. Pierreux C.E. Rytömaa M. Schulze A. McMahon M. Hill C.S. Beug H. Downward J. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 2610-2622Google Scholar). This synergizes with ERK MAPK to induce a gradual change in phenotype from epithelial to mesenchymal, a process during which epithelial markers are lost, adherens and tight junctions degrade, and the cells express mesenchymal markers such as vimentin and become more motile (4Lehmann K. Janda E. Pierreux C.E. Rytömaa M. Schulze A. McMahon M. Hill C.S. Beug H. Downward J. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 2610-2622Google Scholar). The activation of Raf in MDCK cells leads to rapid induction of protection from apoptosis induced by exogenous TGF-β and other death stimuli (within 1 day) followed by much slower protection from the specific growth inhibitory effects of TGF-β. Cells remain responsive to TGF-β even after prolonged Raf activation, showing increased invasive behavior. The signaling pathways downstream of the TGF-β receptors are now known in some detail. The major signal transducers are the Smads. Receptor activation leads to phosphorylation and activation of the receptor-regulated Smads, Smad2 and Smad3. They form complexes with the common mediator Smad, Smad4, that accumulate in the nucleus and are directly involved in transcriptional activation of target genes, usually in conjunction with other transcription factors (6Massagué J. Wotton D. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 1745-1754Google Scholar). Here we have investigated how the TGF-β signaling pathway is perturbed in these Raf-expressing MDCK cells to allow them to become specifically resistant to the anti-proliferative effects of TGF-β while maintaining other TGF-β responses. We demonstrate that a gradual down-regulation of Smad3 during the process of EMT is sufficient for the cells to lose their ability to undergo growth arrest in response to TGF-β. Responsiveness is restored upon re-expression of Smad3 to previous levels of expression. These data suggest that Smad3 plays a critical role in the control of cell proliferation by TGF-β, which is lost following EMT. pBabe-puro EGFP-tagged ΔRaf-1:hbER DD (referred to as ΔRaf-ER) was kindly provided by M. McMahon (7Woods D. Parry D. Cherwinski H. Bosch E. Lees E. McMahon M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 5598-5611Google Scholar). Human Smad3 cDNA was subcloned into the EcoRI/SalI cloning sites of the pBabe-hygromycin and pBabe-bleomycin vectors (8Morgenstern J.P. Land H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 3587-3596Google Scholar). The CAGA12-luciferase reporter was as described previously (9Dennler S. Itoh S. Vivien D. ten Dijke P. Huet S. Gauthier J.M. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 3091-3100Google Scholar). MDCK cell lines stably expressing ΔRaf-ER and their derivative RafT cells, which had been grown continuously in 100 nm 4-OH tamoxifen (4HT), have been described previously (4Lehmann K. Janda E. Pierreux C.E. Rytömaa M. Schulze A. McMahon M. Hill C.S. Beug H. Downward J. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 2610-2622Google Scholar). They express the ecotropic retrovirus receptor. MDCK RafT cells stably expressing human Smad3 were generated by retroviral infection. GP+E-packaging cells were transfected using LipofectAMINE (Invitrogen) with either Smad3-pBabe-bleomycin, Smad3-pBabe-hygromycin, or empty vector and then selected with the appropriate antibiotic (100 μg/ml hygromycin or 25 μg/ml bleomycin) for 8 days. MDCK RafT cells were then incubated with retrovirus-containing supernatants and then cultured in medium containing the appropriate antibiotic as described above to select for virus-infected cells. TGF-β1 (PeproTech) was used at the concentrations indicated in the figure legends. The TGF-β type I receptor inhibitor SB-431542 was used as described previously (10Inman G.J. Nicolás F.J.

Whole cell extracts were prepared in buffer containing 1% Triton X-100 as described previously (12Khwaja A. Hallberg B. Warne P.H. Downward J. Oncogene. 1996; 12: 2491-2498Google Scholar) with the exception of the experiment shown in Fig. 4 Awhere cells were lysed directly into SDS-PAGE gel sample buffer and the experiment shown in Fig. 4 B where whole cell extracts were prepared in RIPA buffer.

The anti-PCNA antibody (PC10) was obtained from the Imperial Cancer Research Fund hybridoma unit. For Western blotting, proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE and transferred onto polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Millipore), and immunoreactive proteins were visualized by ECL (Amersham Biosciences). EMSAs and indirect immunofluorescence microscopy were performed as described previously (4Lehmann K. Janda E. Pierreux C.E. Rytömaa M. Schulze A. McMahon M. Hill C.S. Beug H. Downward J.

To examine cell cycle distribution, cells were fixed in 70% ethanol, treated with ribonuclease (100 μg/ml) for 5 min at room temperature, stained with 50 μg/ml propidium iodide (BD Biosciences) for 5 min, and analyzed by flow cytometry using excitation at 488 nm. All of the probes with the exception of that for E-cadherin used for RNase protection were designed against the human sequences but cross-reacted with the dog sequences. The Smad2 probe recognized the region encoding amino acids 9–86 of the human sequence; Smad3, the region encoding amino acids 107–208; Smad4, the region encoding amino acids 94–227; and GAPDH, the region encoding amino acids 18–77. The γ-actin probe was as described previously (13Pierreux C.E. Nicolás F.J. Hill C.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 9041-9054Google Scholar). For the E-cadherin probe, an E-cadherin fragment was prepared by RT-PCR from total RNA from MDCK cells using the primers (forward 5′-TGACAGAGCCTCTGGATAGAG-3′ and reverse 5′-CTCGTTCTCAGGCACCTGAC-3′) and subcloned into pGEM-T vector (Promega) for probe preparation. All of the probe preparation and RNase protection assays were as described previously (13Pierreux C.E. Nicolás F.J. Hill C.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 9041-9054Google Scholar, 14Howell M. Hill C.S. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 7411-7421Google Scholar). To understand how MDCK cells alter their response to exogenous TGF-β during the process of Raf-induced EMT, we examined the functions of the Smads in cells expressing ΔRaf-ER but in its inactive form and in the same cells treated with 4HT for different times to activate the ΔRaf-ER. Initially, the translocation of the three TGF-β-regulated Smads (the receptor-regulated Smads, Smad2 and Smad3, and the common mediator Smad, Smad4) to the nucleus upon TGF-β treatment was studied (Fig. 1 A). TGF-β-induced translocation of Smad4 to the nucleus was observed in MDCK cells expressing ΔRaf-ER that were untreated or cells that had been induced with 4HT for a short (24 h) or long (14 days) period. Cells growing continuously in 4HT (RafT) also showed this translocation. Similar results were seen for the translocation of Smad2. However, we noted that in cells in which Raf had been activated for longer periods and in which EMT had occurred (see below), Smad3 failed to translocate to the nucleus in response to TGF-β treatment. As expected, in all cases, 4HT treatment induced the phosphorylation of ERK2 as visualized by a shift in mobility in an ERK2 Western blot. Overall, the expression of Smad proteins in these cells was analyzed in whole cell extracts (Fig. 1 B). Short or long term activation of Raf did not affect expression levels of Smad2 and Smad4. However, the activation of Raf for long periods caused a marked decrease in the level of Smad3. After 14 days of Raf activation, Smad3 expression was markedly reduced, and moreover, in cells grown continuously in 4HT (RafT cells), Smad3 could not be detected. Both of these conditions caused EMT as demonstrated by the loss of the epithelial marker E-cadherin. To determine whether the expression of Smad3 was altered at the transcriptional level, the mRNA levels of Smad2, Smad3, and Smad4 were directly measured by RNase protection assay (Fig. 1 C). As a control for EMT, the levels of E-cadherin mRNA were also monitored. The level of Smad3 mRNA was very strongly reduced in RafT cells and also in MDCK ΔRaf-ER cells treated with 4HT for 14 days. The E-cadherin probe detected no E-cadherin mRNA in RafT cells and minimal amounts in MDCK ΔRaf-ER cells treated with 4HT for 12 or 14 days. Smad2 and Smad4 mRNA levels were not altered during the process of EMT. Taken together, these results demonstrate that Smad3 expression is down-regulated in MDCK cells that have undergone EMT. The time course of loss of Smad3 expression may lag marginally behind that of E-cadherin loss. Because the reduction in expression of E-cadherin during EMT is thought to involve methylation of the regulatory region of its gene (15Yoshiura K. Kanai Y. Ochiai A. Shimoyama Y. Sugimura T. Hirai K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 7416-7419Google Scholar), it is possible that methylation may also be involved in the loss of Smad3 expression. To address the question of whether long term activation of Raf is sufficient to induce loss of Smad3 in the absence of EMT, the function of the type I TGF-β receptor ALK5 was inhibited using the potent and specific drug SB-431542 (10Inman G.J. Nicolás F.J. Callahan J.F. Harling J.D. Gaster L.M. Reith A.D. Laping N.J. Hill C.S. Mol. Pharmacol. 2002; 62: 65-72Google Scholar). This blocks the operation of the Raf-induced TGF-β autocrine loop that is essential for EMT (4Lehmann K. Janda E. Pierreux C.E. Rytömaa M. Schulze A. McMahon M. Hill C.S. Beug H. Downward J. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 2610-2622Google Scholar) and allows us to assay the effects of Raf signaling in the absence of TGF-β signaling. In the presence of SB-431542, prolonged Raf activation failed to induce EMT as assessed by E-cadherin expression levels in immunoblot (Fig. 1 D) and immunofluorescence (data not shown). As well as preventing Raf-induced E-cadherin loss, SB-431542 also blocked down-regulation of Smad3 expression (Fig. 1 D), indicating that prolonged Raf activation is not sufficient to cause loss of Smad3 expression in the absence of EMT. A related issue is whether Smad3 down-regulation could occur in response to prolonged TGF-β signaling in the absence of Raf stimulation. However, in the absence of Raf activation by 4HT treatment, TGF-β induces apoptosis in MDCK ΔRaf-ER cells (data not shown) (4Lehmann K. Janda E. Pierreux C.E. Rytömaa M. Schulze A. McMahon M. Hill C.S. Beug H. Downward J. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 2610-2622Google Scholar), so this cannot be addressed directly. It cannot be ruled out that prolonged TGF-β signaling under conditions where apoptosis or growth arrest are blocked by means other than Raf activation would lead to reduction in Smad3 expression. To determine whether the loss of Smad3 expression seen during EMT was responsible for the altered responsiveness to TGF-β, we restored the levels of Smad3 expression in RafT cells by introducing human Smad3 cDNA in retroviral expression vectors. Two different vectors for Smad3 were used, one being selectable in hygromycin and the other in bleomycin. After drug selection, individual cell clones were grown up from pools of resistant cells. Three clones were chosen for further study, two of which showed fairly similar levels of expression of Smad3 to wild type MDCK and uninduced MDCK ΔRaf-ER cells (H2, H3) while a third clone, B4b, had higher levels (Fig. 2 A). These clones along with parental MDCK RafT cells were maintained in 4HT to maintain the activation of ΔRaf-ER. To test the functionality of Smad3, its translocation to the nucleus in response to TGF-β was assessed (Fig. 2 A). As noted previously, Smad3 translocates to the nucleus in response to TGF-β in MDCK ΔRaf-ER cells not treated with 4HT but is absent from RafT cells. The stimulation of RafT clones H2 and H3, which re-express Smad3, with TGF-β induced its translocation into the nucleus at similar levels as in ΔRaf-ER cells. In the case of clone B4b, high levels of Smad3 protein were found in the nucleus before stimulation with TGF-β, most probably because of the high overexpression of Smad3 in this clone. In all of the cases with the exception of B4b, the amount of nuclear phosphorylated Smad2 upon TGF-β induction was close to normal levels. In the case of B4b, very low levels of phosphorylated Smad2 were detected, suggesting that the high levels of expression of Smad3 may interfere with Smad2 phosphorylation. The ability of exogenous Smad3 to form DNA-binding complexes with Smad4 on the Smad-binding element of c-Jun (11Wong C. Rougier-Chapman E.M. Frederick J.P. Datto M.B. Liberati N.T., Li, J.M. Wang X.F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 1821-1830Google Scholar) was also tested by an EMSA. In MDCK ΔRaf-ER cells untreated or treated with 4HT for only 24 h, TGF-β induced the formation of a nuclear Smad3/Smad4 DNA-binding complex (Fig. 2 B). This complex is greatly decreased in the MDCK RafT cells because of the very low expression of Smad3. In all of the MDCK RafT Smad3 re-expressing clones, a DNA-binding complex was formed exclusively upon induction with TGF-β. Even in the case of B4b cells where the high levels of expression of Smad3 caused its localization to the nucleus without TGF-β treatment, virtually no DNA-binding complex was detected in unstimulated cells. In all of the cases, supershift analysis showed that the TGF-β-induced complex contained Smad3 and Smad4 (data not shown). Note that induction of the PAI-1-derived reporter gene CAGA12-luciferase (9Dennler S. Itoh S. Vivien D. ten Dijke P. Huet S. Gauthier J.M. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 3091-3100Google Scholar) was dependent on TGF-β in all of the Smad3 re-expressing clones, suggesting that high nuclear levels of Smad3 alone were insufficient for the induction of TGF-β-dependent transcriptional responses (data not shown). The EMT process requires continued synergism between Raf and TGF-β (Fig. 1 D) (4Lehmann K. Janda E. Pierreux C.E. Rytömaa M. Schulze A. McMahon M. Hill C.S. Beug H. Downward J. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 2610-2622Google Scholar, 16Oft M. Peli J. Rudaz C. Schwarz H. Beug H. Reichmann E. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 2462-2477Google Scholar). To confirm that the clones used here had not lost Raf expression, the level of phosphorylation of MAPK in cultures containing 4HT was determined. All of the cells treated with 4HT showed high levels of activation of ERK2 (Fig. 2 C). In addition, we checked the clones for expression of the ΔRaf-ER construct, which is fused to EGFP (7Woods D. Parry D. Cherwinski H. Bosch E. Lees E. McMahon M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 5598-5611Google Scholar). The clones all continue to express ΔRaf-ER (Fig. 2 D). Moreover, staining for E-cadherin showed that the re-expression of Smad3 had not lead to a reversal of EMT and that the cells still showed a mesenchymal phenotype. An RNase protection assay on RNA extracted from unstimulated and 4HT-stimulated MDCK ΔRaf-ER cells, RafT, and RafT clone H3 cells also showed that re-expression of Smad3 did not restore E-cadherin expression (Fig. 2 E). The expression of Smad3 mRNA was strongly suppressed in RafT cells but restored to at least wild type levels in H3 cells. RafT cells in which continuous activation of ΔRaf-ER has led to acquisition of a mesenchymal phenotype are resistant to cell cycle inhibition in response to TGF-β (4Lehmann K. Janda E. Pierreux C.E. Rytömaa M. Schulze A. McMahon M. Hill C.S. Beug H. Downward J. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 2610-2622Google Scholar). To analyze whether re-expression of Smad3 in RafT cells restores sensitivity to the growth inhibitory effects of TGF-β, cell cycle distribution was examined in MDCK RafT cells and MDCK RafT cells re-expressing Smad3. Cells were analyzed 24 h after treatment with TGF-β (Fig. 3). In MDCK ΔRaf-ER cells not treated with 4HT, stimulation with TGF-β led to an increased percentage of cells in G1 and a reduced percentage of cells in S phase. This effect was the same whether or not Raf was activated by 4HT treatment over a period of up to 2 days (4Lehmann K. Janda E. Pierreux C.E. Rytömaa M. Schulze A. McMahon M. Hill C.S. Beug H. Downward J. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 2610-2622Google Scholar). In contrast, in RafT cells where Raf has been continuously activated, no significant changes in cell cycle distribution in response to TGF-β were observed. However, the re-expression of Smad3 in RafT cells rendered these cells sensitive to TGF-β-induced cell cycle arrest, even in the continued presence of 4HT. RafT clones and pooled populations expressing Smad3 showed a reduction in the number of cells in S phase and an increase in the number of cells in G1. Thus, there is a positive correlation between Smad3 expression and the TGF-β-induced cell cycle regulation. Re-expression of Smad3 did not resensitize RafT cells to the pro-apoptotic effects of TGF-β (data not shown). When epithelial cells are stimulated with TGF-β, the retinoblastoma susceptibility product (pRb) is dephosphorylated, leading to inhibition of E2F, a crucial event for cell cycle arrest (17Laiho M. DeCaprio J.A. Ludlow J.W. Livingston D.M. Massagué J. Cell. 1990; 62: 175-185Google Scholar). To understand the molecular mechanisms involved in the rescue of TGF-β-induced cell cycle arrest upon Smad3 re-expression in RafT cells, we looked at the levels of phosphorylation of pRb. MDCK ΔRaf-ER, RafT, and RafT-Smad3 cells growing in serum were treated with TGF-β for 8 h. MDCK ΔRaf-ER cells not induced with 4HT or those that had been induced for 24 h with 4HT showed a shift in mobility of pRb protein toward the dephosphorylated state upon TGF-β stimulation independently of the induction of the Ras/MAPK pathway (Fig. 4 A). In contrast, in MDCK RafT cells, very little pRb was dephosphorylated in response to TGF-β. When the MDCK RafT-Smad3 clones were examined, all of them showed clear dephosphorylation of pRb in response to TGF-β. Thus, Smad3 was responsible for mediating TGF-β-induced pRb dephosphorylation. Another event implicated in cell cycle arrest by TGF-β is the induction of expression of p21WAF1/Cip1 (hereafter referred to as p21), an inhibitor of activated cyclin-dependent kinases (18Massagué J. Blain S.W. Lo R.S. Cell. 2000; 103: 295-309Google Scholar, 19Datto M.B., Yu, Y. Wang X.-F. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 28623-28628Google Scholar). Its expression is thought to contribute to the inhibition of CDK4/6-cyclin D and CDK2/cyclin E complexes, leading to hypophosphorylation of pRb and thus preventing the progression of the cell cycle (18Massagué J. Blain S.W. Lo R.S. Cell. 2000; 103: 295-309Google Scholar). MDCK ΔRaf-ER cells responded to TGF-β by increasing the levels of p21 mRNA (data not shown) and protein (Fig. 4 B). However, in MDCK RafT cells, TGF-β did not induce expression of p21 (Fig. 4 B). By contrast, MDCK RafT-Smad3 cells showed low p21 levels, which increased when stimulated with TGF-β (Fig. 4 B). Thus, the re-expression of Smad3 in these cells restores TGF-β-induced expression of p21. Cyclin A expression is essential for the progression of cell cycle (20Geng Y. Weinberg R.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 10315-10319Google Scholar). MDCK ΔRaf-ER cells not induced with 4HT or those that had been induced for 24 h with 4HT down-regulate cyclin A expression in response to TGF-β, whereas MDCK RafT cells are resistant to the TGF-β-induced down-regulation of cyclin A (Fig. 4 C) (4Lehmann K. Janda E. Pierreux C.E. Rytömaa M. Schulze A. McMahon M. Hill C.S. Beug H. Downward J. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 2610-2622Google Scholar). In the MDCK RafT-Smad3 clones, this function was restored, because all of them showed a clear down-regulation of cyclin A in response to TGF-β (Fig. 4 C). The data presented here provide an explanation of how cells can become refractory to the growth inhibitory effects of TGF-β during the process of epithelial to mesenchymal transition driven by constitutive activation of the Raf/MAPK pathway that is accompanied by autocrine TGF-β production. Smad3 expression is lost with a time course similar to the loss of E-cadherin expression, while Smad2 and Smad4 are maintained and appear to function normally. Exogenous re-expression of Smad3 restores TGF-β-induced growth arrest. Previous studies on keratinocytes and mouse embryo fibroblasts in which Smad3 had been deleted have shown that this also leads to a loss of TGF-β-induced growth arrest (21Ashcroft G.S. Yang X. Glick A.B. Weinstein M. Letterio J.L. Mizel D.E. Anzano M. Greenwell-Wild T. Wahl S.M. Deng C. Roberts A.B. Nat. Cell Biol. 1999; 1: 260-266Google Scholar, 22Piek E., Ju, W.J. Heyer J. Escalanate-Alcalde D. Stewart C.L. Weinstein M. Deng C. Kucherlapati R. Böttinger E.P. Roberts A.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 19945-19953Google Scholar, 23Datto M.B. Frederick J.P. Pan L. Borton A.J. Zhuang Y. Wang X.F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 2495-2504Google Scholar). Mouse embryo fibroblasts deleted in Smad2 were likewise resistant to the antiproliferative effects of TGF-β (22Piek E., Ju, W.J. Heyer J. Escalanate-Alcalde D. Stewart C.L. Weinstein M. Deng C. Kucherlapati R. Böttinger E.P. Roberts A.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 19945-19953Google Scholar), suggesting that Smad2 is also required although not sufficient for TGFβ-induced growth arrest. The loss of Smad3 during EMT driven by oncogenic Ras together with TGF-β in cells that normally express a high Smad3 to Smad2 ratio could be critical in releasing them from the growth inhibitory effects of TGF-β. Other TGF-β responses that may provide a competitive advantage for the tumor cells could then be maintained via Smad2 (21Ashcroft G.S. Yang X. Glick A.B. Weinstein M. Letterio J.L. Mizel D.E. Anzano M. Greenwell-Wild T. Wahl S.M. Deng C. Roberts A.B. Nat. Cell Biol. 1999; 1: 260-266Google Scholar), whereas effects on host cells, especially angiogenesis and evasion of immune response, may also make TGF-β production advantageous to the tumor. An analysis of Smad3 expression levels in tumor cell lines shows that its loss is not uncommon. In a panel of five colorectal tumor cell lines (Colo741, Colo205, HCT116, CaCo2, and HT29, 2F. J. Nicolás, P. H. Warne, J. Downward, and C. S. Hill, unpublished observations. only one cell line, HT29, expresses appreciable levels of Smad3. However, this cell line also lacks Smad4, and as a result, both Smad2 and Smad3 function will be compromised. Colo741, Colo205, and HT29 all have activating mutations in B-Raf (24Davies H. Bignell G.R. Cox C. Stephens P. Edkins S. Clegg S. Teague J. Woffendin H. Garnett M.J. Bottomley W. Davis N. Dicks E. Ewing R. Floyd Y. Gray K. Hall S. Hawes R. Hughes J. Kosmidou V. Menzies A.

Nature. 2002; 417: 949-954Google Scholar). HCT116 has an activating mutation in K-Ras and CaCo2 has an inactivating mutation in Smad4 (25Woodford-Richens K.L. Rowan A.J. Gorman P. Halford S. Bicknell D.C. Wasan H.S. Roylance R.R. Bodmer W.F. Tomlinson I.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 9719-9723Google Scholar). Only one of these lines, Colo741, is obviously mesenchymal; therefore, it is certainly not the case that low Smad3 expression is sufficient for EMT. Instead, it is likely that the loss of Smad3 function by decrease in its expression (or that of Smad4) is a requirement for a tumor cell to be able to proliferate and/or survive in the presence of prolonged TGF-β stimulation either resulting from autocrine production or from the stroma. Smad3 down-regulation may be able to occur by a number of mechanisms, one of which is linked to the process of EMT as seen in the MDCK cells.

We have examined the binding of NO to human heme oxygenase-1 (hHO-1), an enzyme that oxidizes heme to biliverdin, CO, and free iron, to determine whether inhibition of hHO-1 by NO can contribute to the signaling interplay of NO and CO. An Fe3+-NO hHO-1-heme complex is formed with NO or the NO donors NOC9 or 2-(N,N-diethylamino)-diazenolate-2-oxide·sodium salt. Resonance Raman spectroscopy shows that ferric hHO-1-heme forms a 6-coordinated, low spin complex with NO. The ν(N-O) vibration of this complex detected by Fourier transform IR is only 4 cm−1 lower than that of the corresponding metmyoglobin (met-Mb) complex but is broader, suggesting a greater degree of ligand conformational freedom. The Fe3+-NO complex of hHO-1 is much more stable than that of met-Mb. Stopped-flow studies indicate that k on for formation of the hHO-1-heme Fe3+-NO complex is ∼50-times faster, andk off 10 times slower, than for met-Mb, resulting in K d = 1.4 μm for NO. NO thus binds 500-fold more tightly to ferric hHO-1-heme than to met-Mb. The hHO-1 mutations E29A, G139A, D140A, S142A, G143A, G143F, and K179A/R183A do not significantly diminish the tight binding of NO, indicating that NO binding is not highly sensitive to mutations of residues that normally stabilize the distal water ligand. As expected from the K d value, the enzyme is reversibly inhibited upon exposure to pathologically, and possibly physiologically, relevant concentrations of NO.

The role of CO as an NO-like signaling molecule has received strong support from studies of heme oxygenase and nitric-oxide synthase knockouts (15Zakhary R. Poss K.D. Jaffrey S.R. Ferris C.D.

Nevertheless, the collective evidence makes a persuasive case for at least a limited role for CO in mammalian signaling systems. Evidence has accumulated that interactions of CO and NO may influence the physiological responses to each of these agents through interactions at the level of the biosynthetic enzymes. Thus, NO has been shown to elevate the levels of heme oxygenase-1 mRNA and protein (17Liang M. Croatt A.J. Nath K.A. Am. J. Physiol. 2000; 279: F728-F735Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 18Alcaraz M.J.

Conversely, CO has been reported to elevate the steady state level of NO (26Thom S.R., Xu, Y.A. Ischiropoulos H. Chem. Res. Toxicol. 1997; 10: 1023-1031Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar), but increased levels of heme oxygenase have been shown to decrease NO concentrations, possibly by consuming the heme required for assembly of the nitric-oxide synthases (27Cavicchi M. Gibbs L. Whittle B.J.R. Gut. 2000; 47: 771-778Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar, 28Datta P.K. Koukouritaki S.B. Hopp K.A. Lianos E.A. J. Am. Soc.

As both NO and CO are small molecules that can coordinate to the iron in heme proteins, it is possible that at physiological concentrations NO may directly inhibit the heme oxygenases, and conversely, CO may inhibit the nitric-oxide synthases. In studies of the identity of the proximal ligand in HO-1, NO has been shown by resonance Raman, and EPR to bind to the ferrous heme iron atom (30Sun J. Wilks A. Ortiz de Montellano P.R. Loehr T.M.

In HO-2, a heme regulatory motif binds a secondary non-catalytic heme that binds NO and, through an undetermined mechanism, inactivates the protein (32Ding Y. McCoubrey W.K. Maines M.D. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 264: 854-861Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Indirect evidence also exists for the inhibition of heme oxygenase in tissue homogenates by endogenously formed NO (33Willis D. Tomlinson A. Frederick R. Paul-Clark M.J. Willoughby D.A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 214: 1152-1156Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar), but no focused study has been carried out of the inhibition of HO-1 by NO. NADPH, ampicillin, heme, bovine serum album, glucose, horse myoglobin, MAHMA NONOate (NOC9), and NO gas (98.5%) were purchased from Sigma. High purity argon (99.98%) was from Matheson (Newark, CA). 2-(N,N-Diethylamino)-diazenolate-2-oxide·sodium salt (Dea/NO) was obtained from Alexis Corp. (San Diego, CA). All chemicals were used without further purification. The NO donors have the following half-lives in 0.1 m potassium phosphate buffer at pH 7.4: NOC9, 3 min at 22 °C and 1–2 min at 37 °C; Dea/NO 16 min at 22 °C and 2–4 min at 37 °C. Catalase and glucose oxidase were from Sigma. Rat biliverdin reductase and rat cytochrome P450 reductase were purified by published procedures (34Shen A.L. Christensen M.J. Kasper C.B. J. Biol.

The hHO-1 construct used encoded human heme oxygenase-1 lacking the 23 C-terminal amino acids (37Wilks A. Black S.M. Miller W.L. Ortiz de Montellano P.R. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 4421-4427Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Oligonucleotide synthesis was carried out by Invitrogen, through the Cell Culture Facility of the University of California, San Francisco. Mutants of hHO-1 were generated with a Quick-change site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). Plasmid purifications and bacterial transformations were performed by standard procedures (38Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Transformants were screened initially by ampicillin resistance and confirmed by sequence analysis. Wild type hHO-1 and its E29A, G139A, S142A, D140A, G143A, G143F, and K179A/R183A mutants were expressed, purified, and reconstituted with heme as reported previously (36Lightning L.K. Huang H.

All experiments using these proteins were carried out in 0.1m potassium phosphate buffer at pH 7.4 (standard buffer), unless otherwise stated. The concentrated NO donor solution stocks were prepared fresh in 0.01 n NaOH. NOC9 and Dea/NO are stable under alkaline conditions, but they decompose spontaneously when small amounts of the stock solutions are added to the standard pH 7.4 buffer. Concentrated stock solutions of the NO donors were used to minimize the changes in pH. NOC9 treatment was carried out at room temperature (∼25 °C) and that with Dea/NO at 37 °C. These temperatures were chosen so that the two NO donors had similar rates of NO release. All treatments with NO donors were performed aerobically. The NO gas solutions used in stopped-flow experiments were made anaerobic by bubbling NO into argon-equilibrated standard buffer. The concentration of the NO donors in the enzyme binding assays was varied at a fixed enzyme concentration of 4 μm. NO binding was monitored at wavelengths between 250 and 700 nm. Formation of the hHO-1-heme Fe3+-NO complex was determined from the ratio of the 416 to 404 nm absorbance. Formation of the corresponding met-Mb Fe3+-NO complex was estimated from the ratio of the absorbance at 417 to 408 nm. The UV-visible spectra of the hHO-1 proteins were recorded in standard buffer on a Cary Varian model 1E spectrophotometer. The enzyme concentration for RR experiments was ∼125 μmin 0.1 m potassium phosphate buffer at pH 7.4.14NO and 15NO gas purchased from Aldrich was bubbled through a 0.1 m KOH solution to remove higher nitrogen oxides. Formation of the NO adduct was achieved by addition of an NO-saturated buffer solution to an argon-purged hHO-1 solution in the Raman capillary cell to reach a final concentration of ∼1 mm NO. Before freezing the samples, the completion of the reaction was confirmed by UV-visible spectroscopy in the same Raman capillary cell using a Cary 50 spectrophotometer. Once the RR experiments were completed, the sample was thawed to obtain its UV-visible spectrum and confirm the stability of the complex during the laser illumination at 90 K. RR spectra were obtained on a custom McPherson 2061/207 spectrograph (set at 0.67 m with variable gratings) equipped with a Princeton Instruments liquid N2-cooled CCD detector (LN-1100PB). Kaiser Optical supernotch filters were used to attenuate Rayleigh scattering. Excitation sources consisted of an Innova 302 krypton laser (413 nm). Spectra were collected on frozen samples kept at ∼90 K with N2 cold finger in a backscattering geometry (41Loehr T.M. Sanders-Loehr J. Methods Enzymol. 1993; 226: 431-470Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Frequencies were calibrated relative to indene and CCl4standards and are accurate to ±1 cm−1. CCl4was also used to check the polarization conditions. In the FTIR experiments, the enzyme concentration was increased to ∼1 mm using a Microcon 10 ultrafiltration device (Amicon). The concentrated hHO-1 solution was made anaerobic in a vial before exchanging the head space with pure NO gas to reach a final concentration of ∼2 mm NO in solution. The protein sample was then injected into an IR cell consisting of CaF2windows separated by a 50-μm Teflon spacer. The formation of the NO adduct was confirmed by UV-visible spectroscopy in the IR cell using a Cary 50 spectrophotometer. FTIR spectra were obtained at room temperature on a PerkinElmer Life Sciences system 2000 equipped with a liquid N2-cooled MCT detector. Sets of 20-min accumulations were acquired at a 2-cm−1 resolution on the samples and the identical cell filled with buffer for background subtraction. Kinetic studies were carried out with an SF-61 DX2 double mixing stopped-flow system (Hi-Tech Scientific). The stopped-flow instrument was made anaerobic by first rinsing with argon equilibrated standard buffer, followed by an overnight incubation with anaerobically prepared catalase/glucose/glucose oxidase solution. Kinetic traces were taken at room temperature at wavelengths between 380 and 700 nm. The data were analyzed with KinetAsyst2 software and were fit to a first-exponential expression. In this experiment, 3 μm ferric hHO-1-heme and 1.5 μm horse met-Mb were used. The solubility of NO gas under 1 atmosphere at 20 °C is ∼2 mm. Dilution of the NO-saturated solution was made with argon-equilibrated standard buffer in gas-tight syringes (Hamilton). The reaction mixture contained ferric hHO-1-heme (1 μm), hemin (30 μm), bilirubin reductase (4 μm), and cytochrome P450 reductase (0.4 μm) in the standard buffer. The reaction was initiated by the addition of NADPH (400 μm). The production of bilirubin at room temperature was monitored at 468 nm for 100 s. The initial rate of the reaction was calculated using the value ε468 = 43.5 mm−1cm−1 for the bilirubin product. To study the effects of NO on hHO-1 activity, two sets of experiments were carried out. In one set, biliverdin reductase, cytochrome P450 reductase, hemin, and hHO-1 were incubated with various concentrations of NOC9 for different times before NADPH was added to measure the bilirubin forming activity. In the other set, hHO-1 was incubated with 1 mm NO donor and then the rest of the assay mixture was added for the activity assay. Separately, hemin (30 μm) and bilirubin reductase (4 μm)-cytochrome P450 reductase (0.4 μm) were separately incubated with the NO donors before the other components of the reaction system were added, and bilirubin formation was quantitated. Ferric hHO-1-heme has a Soret maximum at 405 ± 1 nm in 0.1 m phosphate buffer at pH 7.4. Upon addition of a 1 mm concentration of the NO donor NOC9 or Dea/NO, the ferric hHO-1-heme Soret maximum immediately shifted to 416 nm (Fig. 1). This spectroscopic shift was reversible, suggesting that the NO species generated by the NO donors interacted with the heme in hHO-1. Ferric heme alone has a very broad Soret absorption at about 380 nm, and its incubation with the NO donors caused a sharpening of the Soret band with a decrease in its absorption intensity (not shown). In contrast to the reaction with ferric hHO-1-heme, the spectral change observed with free hemin was not reversible. The ferric hHO-1-heme NO complex prepared by bubbling NO through a solution of the ferric hHO-1-heme complex was observed to be very photolabile in the resonance Raman experiments, but at 90 K the efficiency of this process was sufficiently diminished to allow the experiments to be carried out. As shown previously (31Ishikawa K. Takeuchi N. Takahashi S. Matera K.M. Sato M. Shibahara S. Rousseau D.L. Ikeda-Saito M. Yoshida T. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 6345-6350Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar), the spectrum of ferric hHO-1 reveals a hexacoordinated high spin/hexacoordinated low spin equilibrium with ν3, ν2, and ν10 modes at 1482/1508, 1566/1585, and 1608/1640 cm−1, respectively (Fig. 2 A). After exposure to NO, the porphyrin skeletal modes are observed at higher frequencies with ν4, ν3, ν2, and ν10 at 1378, 1511, 1588, and 1645 cm−1, respectively (Fig. 2 B). These frequencies identify the NO adduct as a hexacoordinated low spin complex, although a minor hexacoordinated high spin population revealed by the weak ν3 at 1483 cm−1 is assigned to some photodissociation. In heme ferric nitrosyl complexes, the ν(N-O) is not resonance-enhanced with Soret excitation, but it is easily observed in the FTIR spectrum. This vibration is detected at 1918 cm−1in ferric hHO-1-heme, only 4 cm−1 lower than that in met-Mb (Fig. 3). Such ν(N-O) frequencies are characteristic of linear six-coordinated {Fe(NO)}6 complexes (42Scheidt W.R. Ellison M.K. Acc. Chem. Res. 1999; 32: 350-359Crossref Scopus (163) Google Scholar). A significant difference between these two signals resides in the ∼20-cm−1half-width of this stretching mode in hHO-1 compared with the 9-cm−1 half-width observed in met-Mb. In met-Mb the configuration of the nitrosyl group is clearly defined by the presence of the imidazole ring from the distal histidine, but the absence of distal polar side chains above the heme iron of hHO-1 and a greater solvent accessibility may permit greater fluctuation of the NO ligand, resulting in substantial inhomogeneous broadening of the ν(N-O). In the low frequency region of the RR spectra (Fig. 4), the identification of the Fe-N-O vibrational modes was facilitated by the use of isotopic labeling and the close similarity of these frequencies with those observed in other hemoproteins (43Benko B. Yu N.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1983; 80: 7042-7046Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). In the met-Mb ferric-nitrosyl complex, the ν(Fe-NO) and δ(Fe-N-O) are observed at 595 (−6) and 573 (−11) cm−1, respectively. In the ferric nitrosyl complex of hHO-1, two bands at 596 and 588 cm−1 that shift to 590 and 573 cm−1 with 15NO are assigned to the ν(Fe-NO) and the δ(Fe-N-O), respectively. To study further the formation of the hHO-1-heme (Fe3+-NO) complex, stopped-flow experiments were employed to determine the k on,k off, and K d values for the binding of NO. The experiments in this instance were performed anaerobically with NO gas instead of NO donors. Our experimental conditions in the case of met-Mb gave k on,k off, and K d values similar to those in the literature (49Laverman L.E. Wanat A. Oszajca J. Stochel G. Ford P.C. van Eldik R. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2001; 123: 285-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar), validating the methodology that was employed (Table I). Thek on for formation of the hHO-1 Fe3+-NO complex was found to be ∼50-fold faster, andk off 10-fold slower, than for horse met-Mb, resulting in an ∼500-fold tighter binding of NO. The resulting calculated K d value for the binding of NO to ferric hHO-1-heme is 1.4 μm.Table IKon, Koff, and Kd for formation of the ferric hHO-1-heme and horse met-Mb Fe 3+ -NO complexesFerric proteink onk offK dm −1 s −1s −1μmmet-Mb (Ref. 49Laverman L.E.

As shown in Fig. 5, the binding of NO to ferric hHO-1-heme can also be seen with the NO donors NOC9 and Dea/NO. The concentrations of NOC9 and Dea/NO that cause half-maximal binding of NO to ferric hHO-1-heme are ∼80 and 100 μm, respectively, although the actual concentration of NO in these experiments is much lower. Under the same conditions the binding of NO to horse met-Mb did not reach a plateau even at much higher concentrations of the NO donors, as expected from the higher K d value for this protein (Table I and Fig. 5). The high affinity of the ferric hHO-1-heme complex for NO is unusual for a ferric hemoprotein, although the binding of NO to ferric catalase reportedly occurs with a comparably low K d of ∼0.5 μm (45Brown G.C. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 232: 188-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar, 46Cooper C.E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1411: 290-309Crossref PubMed Scopus (463) Google Scholar). In our efforts to identify specific residues that contribute to this high binding affinity, we investigated the binding of NO to hHO-1 in which individual active site amino acids had been mutated. hHO-1 residues that could stabilize distal iron ligands by hydrogen bonding or other interactions include Glu-29, Gly-139, Asp-140, Ser-142, Gly-143, Lys-179, and Arg-183. Glu-29 is close enough to form a hydrogen bond with His-25, the proximal iron ligand (47Schuller D.J. Wilks A. Ortiz de Montellano P.R. Poulos T.L. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1999; 6: 860-867Crossref PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar). Gly-139, Asp-140, and Gly-143 are part of a hydrogen bonding network on the distal side that interacts with distal ligands, and mutation of any one of them to an alanine results in dissociation of the distal water ligand (36Lightning L.K. Huang H. Moenne-Loccoz P. Loehr T.M. Schuller D.J. Poulos T.L. Ortiz de Montellano P.R. J. Biol.

Mutation of Ser-142 shift the pK avalue of the distal water ligand toward more basic values. 2Y. Liu and P. R. Ortiz de Montellano, unpublished data. Lys-179 and Arg-183 appear to interact with the propionate carboxyl groups of the heme and may be important for proper orientation of the heme (47Schuller D.J. Wilks A. Ortiz de Montellano P.R. Poulos T.L. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1999; 6: 860-867Crossref PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar, 48Zhou H. Migita C.T. Sato M. Sun D.Y. Zhang X.H. Ikeda-Saito M. Fujii H. Yoshida T. J. Am. Chem.

We have therefore examined the binding of NO to the E29A, G139A, D140A, S142A, G143A, G143F, and K179A/R183A mutants, all of which were heterologously expressed in Escherichia coli, purified, and found to have appropriate Soret maxima (Table II). The values for half-saturation of NO binding using NOC9 as the NO donor show that none of the mutations altered the NO binding affinity by more than a factor of ∼2 (Table II). Thus, the high NO affinity of ferric hHO-1-heme is not very sensitive to the identities of these active site residues despite the fact that some of them interact strongly with the distal water ligand that is replaced by NO. Indeed, the high affinity for NO appears to be insensitive to the presence or absence of the distal water ligand, as the water ligand is absent in at least the G139A, G143A, and D140A mutants (36Lightning L.K.

Little inhibition was observed with a 1 μm concentration of the NO donor at any time point, but inhibition was observed when the donor concentration was raised to 10 μm. With a 50 μmconcentration of NOC9, bilirubin formation was completely suppressed when the assay was carried out without NOC9 preincubation, but activity was recovered when the assay was carried out after 10 min or longer of preincubation. Similar results were obtained with 100–600 μm NOC9, except that inhibition was observed after even longer preincubation periods (Fig. 6). A 100 μmconcentration of NOC9 is required to half-saturate the active site of ferric hHO-1-heme with NO, and this concentration therefore must roughly correspond to the K d of 1.4 μmfor NO itself. The fact that complete inhibition is observed with half of this NOC9 concentration, and some inhibition even at lower concentrations, suggests that inhibition may also reflect some binding of NO to th"

The amino-terminal domain of AtTDX is closely related to the co-chaperone Hsp70-interacting protein HIP, whereas its carboxyl-terminal part contains a thioredoxin domain. Both in vivo and in vitro assays showed that AtTDX is a protein-disulfide reductase. We next found that the HIP domain of AtTDX is capable of interacting with the ATPase domain of Ssb2, a yeast heat-shock protein 70 chaperone. Strikingly, the AtTDX-Ssb2 interaction can be released under oxidative stress, a redox-dependent regulation involving the thioredoxin activity of AtTDX. A mutation inactivating the cysteine 20 of the ATPase domain of Ssb2 was found to stabilize the AtTDX-Ssb2 interaction that becomes redox-insensitive. As cysteine 20 is conserved in virtually all the Hsp70 chaperones, our results suggest that this residue might be more generally the target of redox regulations of chaperone binding activity.

Under this reduced form, thioredoxin becomes a very powerful reductant of disulfide bridges in target proteins.Thioredoxin was initially characterized from Escherichia coli extracts as a hydrogen donor for ribonucleotide reductase (2Holmgren A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1981; 6: 26-29Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Thioredoxins were later shown to act as hydrogen donors to peroxiredoxins that reduce hydrogen peroxide (3Chae H.Z. Chung S.J. Rhee S.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 27670-27678Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and to methionine-sulfoxide reductases that reactivate proteins damaged by stresses that generate reactive oxygen species (ROS) (4Fernando M.R. Nanri H. Yoshitake S. Nagato-Kuno K. Minakami S. Eur. J. Biochem. 1992; 209: 917-922Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). They are necessary for a number of other metabolic enzymes that form a disulfide as part of their catalytic cycle (5Reitsch A. Beckwith J. Annu. Rev. Genet. 1998; 32: 163-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar). In addition, thioredoxins induce conformational changes of the targeted proteins by disulfide bond reduction and assist in the protein folding pathway (6Pigiet V.P. Schuster B.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 7643-7647Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Thioredoxins directly or indirectly interact with several nuclear factors, such as the mammalian transcription factor NFκB and Ref-1 (see Ref. 7Hirota K. Matsui M. Iwata S. Nishiyama A. Mori K. Yodoi J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 3633-3638Crossref PubMed Scopus (719) Google Scholar and references therein). Thioredoxins play important roles in cell cycle and division and embryogenesis (8Salz H.K. Flickinger T.W. Mittendorf E. Pellicena-Palle A. Petschek J.P. Albrecht E.B. Genetics. 1994; 136: 1075-1086Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and inhibit spontaneous apoptosis in tumoral cells (9Saitoh M. Nishitoh H. Fujii M. Takeda K. Tobiume K. Sawada Y. Kawabata M. Miyazono K. Ichijo H. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 2596-2606Crossref PubMed Scopus (2056) Google Scholar). Mammalian thioredoxin has also been shown to associate directly with nuclear receptors such as the glucocorticoid receptor GR (10Makino Y. Yoshikawa N. Okamoto K. Hirota K. Yodoi J. Makino I. Tanaka H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 3182-3188Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar), whose regulation requires cooperation between heat-shock proteins such as Hsp70 and Hsp90 (11Buchner J. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1999; 24: 136-141Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (579) Google Scholar).Hsp70 and Hsp90 are molecular chaperones that are involved in many important biological processes by appropriately folding nascent polypeptides on ribosomes as well as by assembling multisubunit protein complexes (12Hartl F.U. Nature. 1996; 381: 571-580Crossref PubMed Scopus (3090) Google Scholar). Chaperones also play a pivotal role by renaturing proteins after exposure to various stresses, driving protein translocation across membranes, and disassembling protein complexes prior to protein degradation. Molecular chaperones often function together, and in this respect, members of the Hsp70 family are of prime importance. They are highly conserved from bacteria to human and exhibit a well defined structure as follows: the 44-kDa amino-terminal part of the protein binds nucleotides, whereas the 28-kDa carboxyl-terminal domain interacts with misfolded or partially unfolded polypeptides (13Boorstein W.R. Ziegelhoffer T. Craig E.A. J. Mol. Evol. 1994; 38: 1-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (420) Google Scholar).The chaperone activity of Hsp70 is regulated by cofactors that catalyze the interconversion between the ATP and ADP states (14Bukau B. Horwich A.L. Cell. 1998; 92: 351-366Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2404) Google Scholar). In bacteria, cycling of the Hsp70 homologue DnaK between different nucleotide states is regulated by the chaperone cofactors DnaJ and GrpE (15McCarty J.S. Buchberger A. Reinstein J. Bukau B. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 249: 126-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar). DnaJ stimulates the Hsp70 ATPase activity, and the conversion of Hsp70 into the ADP-bound state allows it to interact with polypeptide substrates (16Liberek K. Marszalek J. Ang D. Georgopoulos C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 2874-2878Crossref PubMed Scopus (684) Google Scholar). In contrast, GrpE binds to the ATPase domain of DnaK and triggers the release of ADP, hence accelerating substrate dissociation upon ATP re-binding (17Szabo A. Langer T. Schroder H. Flanagan J. Bukau B. Hartl F.U. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 10345-10349Crossref PubMed Scopus (443) Google Scholar). In eukaryotes, the yeast DnaJ homologue Hsp40/Zuo1 (18Yan W. Schilke B. Pfund C. Walter W. Kim S. Craig E.A. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 4809-4817Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar) and the mammalian Hsp40/Hdj (19Michels A.A. Kanon B. Konings A.W.T. Ohtsuka K. Bensaude O. Kampinga H.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 33283-33289Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar) have also been shown to associate with Hsp70. However, structural homologues of GrpE are limited to compartments of prokaryotic origin, i.e. mitochondria and chloroplasts (20Stuart R.A. Cyr D.M. Craig E.A. Neupert W. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1994; 19: 87-92Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). Mammals contain other classes of Hsp70 co-chaperones, such as the p48/Hip (Hsc70-interacting protein), BAG-1/Hap (Hsp70-activatingprotein), and CHIP (carboxyl terminus ofHsc70-interacting protein) (21Höhfeld J. Minami Y. Hartl F.U. Cell. 1995; 83: 589-598Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (378) Google Scholar, 22Höhfeld J. Jentsch S. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 6209-6216Crossref PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar, 23Ballinger C.A. Connell P. Wu Y. Hu Z. Thompson L.J. Yin L.Y. Patterson C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 4535-4545Crossref PubMed Scopus (741) Google Scholar) cofactors. BAG-1 and Hop accelerate ADP release and stimulate the re-binding of ATP. CHIP decreases net ATPase activity and reduces chaperone efficiency, thus negatively regulating the Hsp-substrate binding cycle. In contrast, Hip stabilizes the ADP-bound form of Hsp70, extending the time window during which Hsc70 interacts stably with a polypeptide substrate. All these co-chaperones have a spatial distribution that is critical to the coordination of Hsp70 functions, because they ensure that substrates are both bound and released at an appropriate place and time by regulating the ATP/ADP cycle (24Pilon M. Schekman R. Cell. 1999; 97: 679-682Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar).In this report, we describe the molecular cloning and characterization of a novel bipartite protein from Arabidopsis thaliana that may be a new component of the Hsp70 chaperone system. This protein exhibits a unique domain structure with a carboxyl-terminal thioredoxin domain, the amino-terminal domain containing three tetratricopeptide repeats similar to that of the rat and human Hip (21Höhfeld J. Minami Y. Hartl F.U. Cell. 1995; 83: 589-598Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (378) Google Scholar). We termed this new protein AtTDX for Tetratricopeptidedomain-containing thioredoxin. We present evidence that AtTDX displays a disulfide reductase activity bothin vitro and in vivo due to its thioredoxin domain, whereas its amino terminus interacts specifically with the yeast Hsp70 Ssb2 protein. We show that the interaction between AtTDX and Ssb2 is sensitive to the redox status, and we demonstrate that the thioredoxin domain of AtTDX acts as a redox switch that turns the complex with Ssb2 on and off. We also show that a conserved cysteine in the ATPase domain of Ssb2 is required for disruption of the complex with AtTDX. The work we present here provides the first example of a redox-dependent interaction of a thioredoxin-like protein with a member of the Hsp70 family.DISCUSSIONDuring the last 10 years, an increasing number of genes encoding members of the thioredoxin family have been reported in all prokaryotic and eukaryotic organisms. In plants, the complexity of the thioredoxin reductase/thioredoxin systems was first shown by the sequencing ofA. thaliana expressed sequence tags that demonstrated the presence of at least five thioredoxin h-encoding genes in this organism (35Rivera-Madrid R. Mestres D. Marinho P. Jacquot J.-P. Decottignies P. Miginiac-Maslow M. Meyer Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 5620-5624Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Today, more than 18 thioredoxin and thioredoxin-like sequences have been found in A. thaliana (43Meyer Y. Vignols F. Reichheld J.-P. Methods Enzymol. 2001; 347: 394-402Crossref Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Here, we report the cloning and the characterization of AtTDX, a novel and striking member of the thioredoxin family from A. thaliana. AtTDX is the first member of the thioredoxin family described to date that possesses an extra domain with tetratricopeptide repeats. This domain interacts strongly with the ATPase domain of Ssb2, a member of the Hsp70 family. Moreover, the thioredoxin active site of AtTDX and a conserved cysteine residue within the ATPase domain of Ssb2 were shown to mediate the release of the AtTDX-Ssb2 interaction under oxidative stress conditions.AtTDX, a New Thioredoxin-like TPR-containing ProteinBy using yeast mutant cells that do not express endogenous thioredoxin, we have isolated by functional complementation AtTDX, a novel thioredoxin containing protein from A. thaliana. The AtTDX protein displays an interesting bipartite structure encompassing both a thioredoxin domain and a TPR repeat containing domain is highly similar to the co-chaperone Hip protein. Both in vitro and in vivo assays demonstrated that AtTDX has disulfide reductase activity and therefore that AtTDX could be assigned to the thioredoxin superfamily. In both prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells, several proteins containing a thioredoxin catalytic domain fused to an unrelated extra domain have been described (43Meyer Y. Vignols F. Reichheld J.-P. Methods Enzymol. 2001; 347: 394-402Crossref Scopus (118) Google Scholar). However, the function of the associated domain has been established in two instances only, the human cytosolic PICOT, a 37-kDa protein kinase C-interacting protein with amino-terminal thioredoxin domain (44Witte S. Villalba M. Bi K. Liu Y. Isakov N. Altman A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 1902-1909Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar), and the plant APS reductases, three 50-kDa exhibiting a carboxyl-terminal thioredoxin domain (45Gutierrez-Marcos J.F. Roberts M.A. Campbell E.I. Wray J.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 13377-13382Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). The functional characterization of such proteins was of particular interest because it demonstrated coordinated functions between each domain.Among the members of the thioredoxin family, AtTDX is the first described as comprising TPR repeats associated to the thioredoxin domain. TPRs are 34-amino acid motifs that were originally identified in yeast (46Hirano T.N. Kinoshita N. Morikawa K. Yanagida M. Cell. 1990; 60: 319-328Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar, 47Sikorski R.S. Boguski M.S. Goebl M. Hieter P. Cell. 1990; 60: 307-317Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (391) Google Scholar) and then found in a large number of both prokaryotic and eukaryotic proteins (36Lamb J.R. Tugendreich S. Heiter P. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1995; 20: 257-259Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (547) Google Scholar). TPR repeats mediate protein-protein interactions. TPR-containing proteins play diverse roles in many cellular processes like cell cycle regulation, transcriptional repression, heat shock response, protein kinase inhibition, and peroxisomal protein transport (36Lamb J.R. Tugendreich S. Heiter P. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1995; 20: 257-259Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (547) Google Scholar). It is noteworthy that the TPR domain of AtTDX is more particularly related to TPR proteins known to interact with members of the heat-shock protein family. In particular, we found that the TPR repeats of AtTDX are highly related to those of Hip and Sti1p (the yeast Hop counterpart), with Hip being a co-chaperone that specifically binds to Hsp70 and Hop providing a physical link between Hsp70 and Hsp90 (48Johnson B.D. Schumacher R.J. Ross E.D. Toft O. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 3679-3686Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar). In addition, AtTDX displays a significant degree of similarity with TPR domains of protein phosphatase 5, cyclophilin CyP40, and FKBP52, all factors known to interact with Hsp90 chaperones (11Buchner J. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1999; 24: 136-141Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (579) Google Scholar).AtTDX Is Capable of Interacting with a Yeast Hsp70 ChaperoneThe homology of AtTDX with HIP suggested that AtTDX could interact with heat-shock proteins through its TPR repeats. By using a heterologous two-hybrid strategy, we indeed isolated one yeast protein capable of interacting with AtTDX, the Ssb2 protein, a member of the yeast Hsp70 family (38Nelson R.J. Ziegelhoffer T. Nicolet C. Werner-Washburne M. Craig E.A. Cell. 1992; 71: 97-105Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (426) Google Scholar).Interaction domain mapping experiments favor the hypothesis that the AtTDX-Ssb2 interaction is specific and does not result from the targeting of AtTDX by Ssb2 in response to overproduction and/or misfolding. Indeed, we show here that the ATPase domain of Ssb2 mediates its interaction with AtTDX, whereas it is well established that misfolded proteins are selectively recognized by the peptide-binding domain of Hsp70 chaperones (13Boorstein W.R. Ziegelhoffer T. Craig E.A. J. Mol. Evol. 1994; 38: 1-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (420) Google Scholar). Furthermore, we show that a single cysteine replacement within the thioredoxin active site of AtTDX strongly enhances the AtTDX-Ssb2 interaction, whereas it was shown that such a mutation has a very limited impact on thioredoxin structure (49Qin J. Clore G.M. Poindexter Kennedy W.M. Huth J.R. Gronenborn A.M. Structure. 1995; 3: 289-297Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar, 50Wynn R. Cocco M.J. Richards F.M. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 11807-11813Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Finally, we searched for Hsp70 genes inA. thaliana data bases and found that theAtHsc70-1 gene (51Wu S.H. Wang C. Chen J. Lin B.L. Plant Mol. Biol. 1994; 25: 577-583Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar) encodes the closest A. thaliana homologue of Ssb2. The two proteins Ssb2 and AtHsc70-1 share 53% identical residues (68% similarity). We cloned theAtHsc70-1 gene into the pADGal4 vector and succeeded in obtaining a two-hybrid interaction with AtTDX, even weaker than that involving Ssb2 (not shown). These results, considered as a whole, are strong evidence that AtTDX is a new Hsp70 interactant.Surprisingly, we did not isolate any clone encoding Hsp70 proteins from the Ssa family in our two-hybrid screens. Ssa and Ssb share 65% identity (more than 72% of similarity) in their ATPase domain, which is precisely the region of Ssb2 that interacts with AtTDX. In our screens, only positive clones strongly interacting with AtTDX were selected, and one can imagine that proteins interacting with AtTDX with a low specificity were not retained. We also did not isolate clones encoding members of the Hsp90 proteins, because of the high degree of similarity between the TPR repeats of AtTDX and the Hop/Sti1 proteins. The absence of such proteins among the positives clones suggests that AtTDX does not act as a physical link between Hsp70 and Hsp90 proteins, as Hop does (48Johnson B.D. Schumacher R.J. Ross E.D. Toft O. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 3679-3686Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar).The fact that AtTDX interacts with Ssb2 and with an A. thaliana Ssb homologue raises the question as to how the AtTDX function correlates with Hsp70 chaperone activity. Ssb proteins are ribosome-associated chaperones that interact with nascent chain and likely play an important role in early protein folding events (38Nelson R.J. Ziegelhoffer T. Nicolet C. Werner-Washburne M. Craig E.A. Cell. 1992; 71: 97-105Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (426) Google Scholar, 52Pfund C. Huang P. Lopez-Hoyo N. Craig E.A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2001; 12: 3773-3782Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Several partner proteins that regulate Hsp70 function as a molecular chaperone have already been identified, including positive (Hsp40 and HIP) and negative (CHIP and Bag-1) regulators (18Yan W. Schilke B. Pfund C. Walter W. Kim S. Craig E.A. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 4809-4817Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar, 21Höhfeld J. Minami Y. Hartl F.U. Cell. 1995; 83: 589-598Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (378) Google Scholar, 22Höhfeld J. Jentsch S. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 6209-6216Crossref PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar, 23Ballinger C.A. Connell P. Wu Y. Hu Z. Thompson L.J. Yin L.Y. Patterson C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 4535-4545Crossref PubMed Scopus (741) Google Scholar). HIP and Bag-1, like AtTDX, interact with the Hsp70 ATPase domain (21Höhfeld J. Minami Y. Hartl F.U. Cell. 1995; 83: 589-598Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (378) Google Scholar, 54Takayama S. Bimston D.N. Matsuzawa S. Freeman B.C. Aime-Sempe C. Xie Z. Morimoto R.I. Reed J.C. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 4887-4896Crossref PubMed Scopus (435) Google Scholar) and functionally compete in regulating the in vivo chaperone activity of Hsp70 (55Nollen E.A. Kabakov A.E. Brunsting J.F. Kanon B. Hohfeld J. Kampinga H.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 4677-4682Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar), within the cycle between the ADP- and ATP-bound states. Interestingly, AtTDX and AtHIP are highly homologous in their amino-terminal interacting TPR region. Because both are expressed inA. thaliana, one could imagine that they sequentially interact with some common Hsp70 at different times and/or in different circumstances during the plant life. The next step in understanding AtTDX function will be to investigate in which of the ATP/ADP states Ssb2 interacts with AtTDX and whether AtTDX binds to Ssb2 by displacing Hsp70 cofactors or by synergy with other co-chaperones. This could bring new elements to determine whether AtTDX as a new Hsp70 co-chaperone.A Redox Switch Dissociates the AtTDX-Hsp70 ComplexOne major result from our two-hybrid experiments indicated that the AtTDX-Ssb2 interaction is specifically released upon oxidative stress. Both the removal of the thioredoxin domain from AtTDX and the replacement of one cysteine from the thioredoxin active site by a serine residue renders the AtTDX-Ssb2 interaction insensitive to oxidative stress. This is the demonstration that the thioredoxin domain of AtTDX is directly involved in the oxidative process that dissociates AtTDX from Ssb2. Furthermore, we showed that Cys-20 located in the ATPase domain of Ssb2 is not necessary for AtTDX-Ssb2 complex formation but is mandatory for its dissociation. Taken altogether, our results demonstrate that a redox switch governs the association/dissociation of AtTDX-Ssb2 complex.Oxidizing conditions like exposure to H2O2 are known to cause disulfide bonds to form and chaperone function to be turned on. Proteins from distinct Hsp families were also shown to be affected in their activity and/or conformation by the redox status. The murine small Hsp25 that carries a single Cys residue equilibrates between reduced protein and protein dimer, depending on the oxidoreduction conditions (56Zavialov A.V. Gaestel M. Korpela T. Zavialov V.P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1388: 123-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). The E. coli Hsp33 has been described recently (57Jakob U. Muse W. Eser M. Bardwell J.C.A. Cell. 1999; 96: 341-352Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (423) Google Scholar) as a chaperone with an on-off mode of activity that uses reactive disulfide bonds as molecular switches. Exposure to hydrogen peroxide causes zinc to be released from Hsp33 conserved cysteines and disulfide bond formation and the chaperone function to be turned on. Another example is given by Tsai et al. (58Tsai B. Rodighiero C. Lencer W.I. Rapoport T.A. Cell. 2001; 104: 937-948Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (409) Google Scholar) that showed that the human protein-disulfide isomerase is capable of redox-driven chaperone activity. All these examples are consistent with our results that show an in vivo redox regulation of a member of the Hsp70 family by a thioredoxin.Recently, Hsp70 chaperoning activity was shown to be increased by environments that mimics oxidative stress (59Callahan M.K. Chaillot D. Jacquin C. Clark P.R. Menoret A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 33604-33609Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Because association with peptides under oxidative conditions is not reversible by reducing agents, it has been proposed that other chaperone-associated factors are required for substrate release. AtTDX may be one of these chaperone-associated factors, acting as an oxidative stress detector through its disulfide reductase activity. In the case of AtTDX/Ssb2 dissociation, involvement of AtTDX disulfide reductase activity and oxidation of Ssb2 cysteine 20 are two mandatory events demonstrated by the present work. At present, the exact function of Ssb2 Cys-20 under normal conditions and oxidative stress remains to be demonstrated. A survey of all Hsp70 of bacteria, fungi, animals, and plants shows the presence of a conserved cysteine in the position homologue to that of Ssb2 Cys-20. This suggests that the mechanism of a redox-dependent release is conserved. Moreover, analysis of the Ssb2 sequence with Swiss-PDB-Viewer and Rasmol programs proposed that Cys-20 is located in a small convex cavity near the protein surface and is thus easily accessible for disulfide bond formation/oxidation. These findings suggest that Ssb2 Cys-20 may be engaged in a disulfide bond with a third partner, which could be another Hsp70 molecule in a self-association (53Benaroudj N. Triniolles F. Ladjimi M.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 18471-18476Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar) or another protein with conserved cysteine. How thioredoxin activity can affect, directly or indirectly, the redox state of Ssb2 Cys-20 under oxidative stress remains unsolved. Several hypotheses exist that require further experiments, including fine analysis of determinants and other partners involved in the interaction. Thioredoxin (TRX) 1The abbreviations used are: TRX, thioredoxin; ROS, reactive oxygen species; GST, glutathioneS-transferase; HA, hemagglutinin; TPR, tetratrico peptide repeat 1The abbreviations used are: TRX, thioredoxin; ROS, reactive oxygen species; GST, glutathioneS-transferase; HA, hemagglutinin; TPR, tetratrico peptide repeat is a small 12-kDa ubiquitous protein containing two redox-active half-cystine residues in an active center with conserved amino acid sequence Cys-X-X-Cys (where Xindicates various amino acids) that functions as a protein-disulfide reductase. The two cysteine residues in the active site provide the sulfhydryl groups involved in the thioredoxin-dependent reducing activity. Under an oxidized form, the TRX-S2protein contains a disulfide bridge within the active site that is reduced to a TRX-(SH2) dithiol by NADPH and the flavoprotein TRX reductase (for review, see Ref. 1Meyer Y. Miginiac-Maslow M. Schürmann P. Jacquot J.-P. McManus M.T. Laing W.A. Allan A.C. The Annual Plant Reviews. Sheffield Academic Press, Sheffield, UK2002: 1-23Google Scholar). Under this reduced form, thioredoxin becomes a very powerful reductant of disulfide bridges in target proteins. Thioredoxin was initially characterized from Escherichia coli extracts as a hydrogen donor for ribonucleotide reductase (2Holmgren A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1981; 6: 26-29Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Thioredoxins were later shown to act as hydrogen donors to peroxiredoxins that reduce hydrogen peroxide (3Chae H.Z. Chung S.J. Rhee S.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 27670-27678Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and to methionine-sulfoxide reductases that reactivate proteins damaged by stresses that generate reactive oxygen species (ROS) (4Fernando M.R. Nanri H. Yoshitake S. Nagato-Kuno K. Minakami S. Eur. J. Biochem. 1992; 209: 917-922Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). They are necessary for a number of other metabolic enzymes that form a disulfide as part of their catalytic cycle (5Reitsch A. Beckwith J. Annu. Rev. Genet. 1998; 32: 163-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar). In addition, thioredoxins induce conformational changes of the targeted proteins by disulfide bond reduction and assist in the protein folding pathway (6Pigiet V.P. Schuster B.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 7643-7647Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Thioredoxins directly or indirectly interact with several nuclear factors, such as the mammalian transcription factor NFκB and Ref-1 (see Ref. 7Hirota K. Matsui M. Iwata S. Nishiyama A. Mori K. Yodoi J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 3633-3638Crossref PubMed Scopus (719) Google Scholar and references therein). Thioredoxins play important roles in cell cycle and division and embryogenesis (8Salz H.K. Flickinger T.W. Mittendorf E. Pellicena-Palle A. Petschek J.P. Albrecht E.B. Genetics. 1994; 136: 1075-1086Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and inhibit spontaneous apoptosis in tumoral cells (9Saitoh M. Nishitoh H. Fujii M. Takeda K. Tobiume K. Sawada Y. Kawabata M. Miyazono K. Ichijo H. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 2596-2606Crossref PubMed Scopus (2056) Google Scholar). Mammalian thioredoxin has also been shown to associate directly with nuclear receptors such as the glucocorticoid receptor GR (10Makino Y. Yoshikawa N. Okamoto K. Hirota K. Yodoi J. Makino I. Tanaka H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 3182-3188Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar), whose regulation requires cooperation between heat-shock proteins such as Hsp70 and Hsp90 (11Buchner J.

Biol. 2000; 301: 1077-1087Crossref PubMed Scopus (377) Google Scholar). Like other Ras-related GTPases (small GTPases), Rab proteins serve as molecular switches by cycling between GTP-bound (on/active) and GDP-bound (off/inactive) conformations. Upon GTP binding, an extensive hydrophobic interface forms between two so-called switch regions (I and II) (9Milburn M.V. Tong L. deVos A.M. Brunger A. Yamaizumi Z. Nishimura S. Kim S.H.

The off-to-on process requires dissociation of GDP, which is an intrinsically slow and reversible process, and association of GTP. This process can be accelerated by guanidine nucleotide exchange factors (GEF) (13Burton J.L. Burns M.E. Gatti E. Augustine G.J. De Camilli P. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 5547-5558Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar, 14Worthylake D.K. Rossman K.L. Sondek J.

The on-to-off process is also an intrinsically slow but irreversible process, which involves hydrolysis of GTP to GDP and is stimulated by GTPase-activating proteins (GAP)1 (16Boguski M.S.

Despite the conserved catalytic machinery, the intrinsic GTP hydrolytic rates in the Rab family vary by more than an order of magnitude. For example, Rab5a exhibits a rate 20-fold higher than that of Rab6 or Rab7 (21Simon I. Zerial M. Goody R.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 20470-20478Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). The intrinsic GTP hydrolytic rate of a GTPase is important for the association duration with its GTP-specific partners, and thus for its functions in vivo. The structural determinants responsible for the large variation in the intrinsic rates of GTP hydrolysis remain elusive. In addition to the common GTPase fold, Rabs usually possess hypervariable N- and C-terminal peptides; the C-terminal peptides are often isoprenylated for targeting to specific membranes (8Pereira-Leal J.B. Seabra M.C. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 301: 1077-1087Crossref PubMed Scopus (377) Google Scholar, 22Somsel Rodman J. Wandinger-Ness A. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 183-192Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These peptides may participate directly in protein-protein contacts with some effectors or regulatory proteins but are not essential for nucleotide binding or intrinsic GTP hydrolysis. Rab5, a member of the Rab family, regulates early endosome fusion in endocytosis (23Bucci C. Parton R.G. Mather I.H. Stunnenberg H. Simons K. Hoflack B. Zerial M.

Biol. 1998; 8: 34-45Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). It is widely distributed in many tissues. Rab5 physically changes locations during its GTP hydrolysis cycle. In its active stage, Rab5 is localized on the cytoplasmic side of early endosomes, while in its inactive stage, Rab5 stays in cytosol presumably associated with GDI. The biological functions of Rab5 are evident from the following observations. Anti-Rab5 antibodies and dominant negative Rab5 mutants are inhibitory in several early endosome fusion assays reconstitutedin vitro (24Gorvel J.P. Chavrier P. Zerial M. Gruenberg J.

EMBO J. 1994; 13: 1287-1296Crossref PubMed Scopus (777) Google Scholar). Expression of dominant negative Rab5 mutants in intact cells causes fragmentation of early endosomes and reduced endocytosis (23Bucci C. Parton R.G. Mather I.H. Stunnenberg H. Simons K. Hoflack B.

Chem. 1994; 269: 14631-14635Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, overexpression of wild-type (WT) Rab5 or a constitutively activated Rab5 mutant results in enlargement of early endosomes and increased endocytosis (23Bucci C. Parton R.G. Mather I.H.

EMBO J. 1994; 13: 1287-1296Crossref PubMed Scopus (777) Google Scholar). The intrinsic GTPase hydrolytic rate human Rab5a (one of three Rab5 isoforms) has been reported to be about 0.1 min−1 (21Simon I. Zerial M. Goody R.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 20470-20478Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar), which is in the high range among Rab family members. Structures of a number of small GTPases and effects of mutations have been investigated over the last two decades (31Shih T.Y. Hattori S. Clanton D.J. Ulsh L.S. Chen Z.Q. Lautenberger J.A. Papas T.S. Gene Ampl. Anal. 1986; 4: 53-72PubMed Google Scholar, 32Vetter I.R. Wittinghofer A. Science. 2001; 294: 1299-1304Crossref PubMed Scopus (1394) Google Scholar). Besides their similar overall folding, these proteins share a number of conserved structural motifs. Among them, the phosphate-binding loop (P-loop),i.e. the GXXXXGK(S/T) motif (where Xstands for any amino acid residue), is found to play crucial roles in GTP hydrolysis. In Rab5a, the P-loop consists of residues27GESAVGKS34, corresponding to residues[10]GAGGVGKS[17] in the prototypic small GTPase Ras (residue numbers in brackets denote positions in Ras). Mutations at Ras Gly[12] often reduce its GTPase activity and increase its biological activity in cellular transformation (33Seeburg P.H. Colby W.W. Capon D.J. Goeddel D.V. Levinson A.D. Nature. 1984; 312: 71-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (422) Google Scholar); however, some of these variations can be found at the equivalent position in other functional WT small GTPases. To investigate structural roles of P-loop in GTP hydrolysis and biological function, Rab5a has been used as a model system to replace both Ser29[12] and Ala30[13] with all the other 19 amino acids (34Li G. Liang Z. Biochem. J. 2001; 355: 681-689Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar, 35Liang Z. Mather T. Li G. Biochem. J. 2000; 346: 501-508Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). The choice of mutation sites was partly made based on their proximity to the γ-phosphate group of the substrate GTP. The resulting variants have been analyzed for GTP hydrolysis, GTP binding, GTP dissociation, and biological activity. At position 30 [13], only the substitution with proline reduces the GTPase activity significantly (at least 12-fold) (35Liang Z. Mather T. Li G. Biochem. J. 2000; 346: 501-508Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Whereas most of the other substitutions at this position show either a small negative effect or no effect on the GTPase activity, the arginine substitution stimulates the intrinsic GTP hydrolysis by 5-fold. It was proposed that this introduced arginine residue may mimic the function of an arginine finger motif (35Liang Z. Mather T. Li G. Biochem. J. 2000; 346: 501-508Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar), which enhances GTPase activity in trimeric GTPases (36Coleman D.E. Berghuis A.M. Lee E. Linder M.E. Gilman A.G. Sprang S.R. Science. 1994; 265: 1405-1412Crossref PubMed Scopus (757) Google Scholar, 37Sondek J. Lambright D.G. Noel J.P. Hamm H.E. Sigler P.B. Nature. 1994; 372: 276-279Crossref PubMed Scopus (538) Google Scholar) and small GTPase-GAP complexes (38Scheffzek K. Lautwein A. Scherer A. Franken S. Wittinghofer A. Proteins. 1997; 27: 315-318Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar) by positioning the positively charged guanidinium group close to the GTP γ-phosphate group. Despite considerable kinetic, structural, and theoretical studies on the reaction mechanism of small GTPases, there still lacks definitive structural evidence to resolve different mechanistic hypotheses. It has been shown that GTP hydrolysis in solution occurs via a dissociative, metaphosphate-like transition state (39Admiraal S.J. Herschlag D. Chem. Biol. 1995; 2: 729-739Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). Such a reaction pathway implies that there is little bond formation between the nucleophilic water and GTP but substantial cleavage of the bond between the γ-phosphoryl moiety and the GDP-leaving group. Recent results from Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy experiments suggest that the transition state seems to have a considerable amount of dissociative character (40Du X. Frei H. Kim S.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 8492-8500Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Binding of GTP to Ras has been shown to shift negative charge from the γ- to β-phosphate (41Allin C. Gerwert K. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 3037-3046Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar), which is a characteristic feature of dissociative-like transition states, and such a shift can be enhanced by GAP binding (42Allin C. Ahmadian M.R. Wittinghofer A. Gerwert K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 7754-7759Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). The charge shift is interpreted as a key factor contributing to catalysis by Ras in addition to correct positioning of the nucleophilic water. These observations seriously challenge the long held dominant mechanistic hypothesis that GTP hydrolysis occurs via an associative-like pathway. A fully associative mechanism involves a trigonal bipyramidal intermediate, followed by the departure of the leaving group. It is characterized by an accumulation of negative charge on the γ-phosphate in the transition state. Structural observations, that catalytically important residues in GTPases interact extensively with the trigonal bipyramidal or hexacoordinating transition site analog GDP+AlFx (where x is 3 or 4), form a cornerstone of associative transition state hypothesis. A compromising view has been put forward to describe the phosphoryl transfer by a structure somewhere between dissociative and associative extremes (40Du X. Frei H. Kim S.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 8492-8500Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). However, there is still a controversial debate as to what extent the reaction proceeds via a dissociative or an associative mechanism. The dissociation transition state hypothesis of GTPase catalysis predicts that the enzyme stabilizes accumulation of negative charge at the β-γ bridge oxygen in the transition intermediate through an important hydrogen bond between this oxygen and the backbone amide group at the residue equivalent to Ras Gly[13] (43Maegley K.A. Admiraal S.J. Herschlag D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 8160-8166Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). In short, the associative transition hypothesis emphasizes the catalytic roles of the nucleophilic water and structural features that stabilize negatively charged GTP γ-phosphate (44Prive G.G. Milburn M.V. Tong L. de Vos A.M. Yamaizumi Z. Nishimura S. Kim S.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 3649-3653Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar, 45Scheffzek K. Ahmadian M.R. Kabsch W. Wiesmuller L. Lautwein A. Schmitz F. Wittinghofer A. Science. 1997; 277: 333-338Crossref PubMed Scopus (1208) Google Scholar), whereas the dissociative transition hypothesis proposes that the P-loop is crucial for the reaction (41Allin C. Gerwert K. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 3037-3046Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar, 43Maegley K.A. Admiraal S.J. Herschlag D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 8160-8166Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). A few crystal structures of Ras variants with mutations at Gly[12]inside the P-loop have been reported (44Prive G.G. Milburn M.V. Tong L. de Vos A.M. Yamaizumi Z. Nishimura S. Kim S.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 3649-3653Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar, 46Krengel U. Schlichting L. Scherer A. Schumann R. Frech M. John J. Kabsch W. Pai E.F. Wittinghofer A. Cell. 1990; 62: 539-548Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar), which in general support the notion that correct alignment of the nucleophilic water is critical for the GTP catalytic hydrolysis. To identify further the structural determinants in the P-loop that may regulate the intrinsic GTPase activity and potentially, the GAP-accelerated GTP hydrolytic rates, we have carried out a comprehensive crystallographic study to analyze a number of crystal structures of human Rab5a and five variants. Particularly, we have determined crystal structures of a variant that contains an Ala30[13] to Pro substitution (A30P) in its GTP-bound, (GDP+AlF3)-bound, and GDP-bound forms, taking advantage of its very low hydrolytic activity. High resolution crystal structures of WT and other P-loop mutants have also been solved in complexes with a non-hydrolyzable GTP analog; they provide a clean background for discussion of the novel structural features observed in A30P complexes. Our results support the dissociation transition state hypothesis (43Maegley K.A. Admiraal S.J. Herschlag D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 8160-8166Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). Human Rab5a WT and P-loop mutants with Arg, Lys, Glu, Leu, and Pro at position 30 were subcloned into the bacterial expression vector pET11 from the corresponding pGEX-3X constructs containing the Rab5a cDNAs described previously (35Liang Z. Mather T. Li G. Biochem. J. 2000; 346: 501-508Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). The native Rab5 protein consists of 215 residues. After comparison with the canonical folding of small GTPases, we deleted the N- and C-terminal hypervariable regions to promote crystallization. As a result, the recombinant proteins contain a starting codon-derived methionine residue, followed by residues 15–184 of Rab5a or its mutants. The recombinant proteins were expressed in the BL21 strain of E. coli. and purified as soluble proteins from the cytoplasm. Briefly, cell cultures were grown at 30 °C to an OD600of 0.6–0.9, and then induced with isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactoside at final concentration of 0.5 mm, with an additional 3 h of growth at 35–37 °C. Cells were harvested by centrifugation and resuspended in 4 °C TN buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 50 mm NaCl) containing EDTA-free protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Molecular Biochemicals, Mannheim, Germany). Cells were then lysed with lysozyme and a freeze-thaw cycle and treated with DNase in the presence of 1 mm MgCl2. The cell lysate was centrifuged, and the supernatant was loaded to a Sephacryl-200-HR sizing column (Amersham Biosciences) equilibrated in TN buffer containing 0.1% (v/v) β-mercaptoethanol and 0.02% (w/v) NaN3. High A 280 fractions were pooled and loaded onto a Resource-Q ion-exchange column (AmershamBiosciences). Rab5a was eluted at ∼100 mm salt concentration with a NaCl gradient. Rab5a recombinant proteins were crystallized using hanging drop vapor diffusion methods under conditions similar to those reported previously (10Merithew E. Hatherly S. Dumas J.J. Lawe D.C. Heller-Harrison R. Lambright D.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 13982-13988Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). The protein sample at ∼15 mg/ml concentration in a buffer containing 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) and 5 mm GppNHp was mixed with an equal volume of the reservoir solution containing 10% (w/v) polyethylene glycol 6000 (PEG 6000), 50–100 mm MES (pH 6.0), 0.2 m NaCl, 1 mm MgCl2, and 0.1% (v/v) β-mercaptoethanol. The A30P mutant crystals were grown with GDP or GTP instead of GppNHp. In order to grow (GDP+AlFx)·Rab5a complex crystals, NaCl in the above reservoir solution was replaced with 2 mm AlCl3and 80 mm NaF. Crystals appeared 1 day after microseeding. Reservoir solution with additional 30% (v/v) glycerol (for WT, A30E, and A30L), 30% PEG 6000 (for A30K), or 20% 2-methyl-2,4-pentanediol (for A30R and A30P) served as the cryoprotection solution to soak the crystal before being cooled in a 100 K nitrogen gas stream for data collection. A complete data set of WT Rab5a complexed with GppNHp was collected at 1.5 Å resolution from our in-house MAR345 image-plate data collection system (Mar Research Inc., Norderstedt, Germany). Data sets of other variants were also collected at comparable resolutions and processed with the program suite HKL (47Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (38594) Google Scholar). The structures were solved by the difference-Fourier method. The previously reported isomorphous crystal structure of rat WT Rab5c at 1.8 Å resolution (PDB file 1huq) (10Merithew E. Hatherly S. Dumas J.J. Lawe D.C. Heller-Harrison R. Lambright D.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 13982-13988Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar) served as the initial model for phasing and refinement. The structures were refined with CNS (48Brunger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. DeLano W.L. Gros P. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Jiang J.S. Kuszewski J. Nilges M. Pannu N.S. Read R.J. Rice L.M. Simonson T. Warren G.L. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1998; 54: 905-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (16978) Google Scholar), and model building was performed with Turbo-Frodo (49Roussel A. Cambillau C. Silicon Graphics Geometry Partners Directory. Silicon Graphics, Mountain View, CA1989: 77-79Google Scholar). Difference-Fourier maps calculated with coefficients of (Fobs(crystal 1) − Fobs(crystal 2)) exp(i ϕ calc) were used in structural comparison to minimize model bias. A previous biochemical study comparing the GTP hydrolytic rates of Rab5a WT and P-loop mutants replacing the Ala30[13] residue with 19 different amino acid residues showed a range of over 50-fold variation in their intrinsic GTPase activities (35Liang Z. Mather T. Li G. Biochem. J. 2000; 346: 501-508Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). We selected five mutants from this group, namely A30P, Lys, Leu, Glu, and Arg, as well as the WT, for further structural studies. To facilitate crystallization, we deleted the hypervariable N- and C-terminal peptides (14 and 31 residues, respectively). The resulting recombinant proteins had comparable GTPase activities as their full-length counterparts (data not shown). Since both termini are located at one end of the β-sheet that is opposite from the nucleotide-binding site, the truncations are unlikely to contribute to the conformational changes we observed in the different mutant crystal structures. In the following, we will refer to these truncation constructs as WT Rab5a and its mutants. All constructs were overexpressed in E. coli. as soluble proteins and purified for structural studies using x-ray crystallography. The intrinsic GTP hydrolytic rates of these mutants ranged from the highest (A30R) to the lowest (A30P) among the original 20 variants. The purification yields of these variants were about the same as the WT (5–10 mg per liter of cell culture). The recombinant proteins of all variants were able to be crystallized under the same or very similar conditions. Of particular interest, three A30P complex crystals were obtained with GDP, (GDP+AlF3), and authentic GTP, respectively. For the other variants, crystals were obtained only in complexes with GppNHp. Like the GppNHp·Rab5a variant crystals, the GTP·A30P complex crystals were stable at 20 °C for at least 50 days; GDP·A30P crystals, however, appeared less stable (i.e. <10 days). All crystals belonged to the P212121 space group with similar unit cell parameters. There was one Rab5a molecule per asymmetric unit, with a low VM of 2.0 Å3/Da (50Matthews B.W. J. Mol. Biol. 1968; 33: 491-497Crossref PubMed Scopus (7925) Google Scholar), reflecting a tight crystal packing. The crystal structures of Rab5a were refined at resolutions ranging from 1.8 to 1.5 Å. Statistics of data collection and structural refinement of the eight crystal structures are summarized in Table I. All coordinates have been deposited to the Protein Data Bank (see Table I for the PDB IDs). The overall structure of Rab5a (Fig. 1) possessed a typical Ras-like small GTPase folding (51de Vos A.M. Tong L. Milburn M.V. Matias P.M. Jancarik J. Noguchi S. Nishimura S. Miura K. Ohtsuka E. Kim S.H.

In all structures, residues 18–181 were visible in the electron density map. The corresponding root mean square deviations (rmsd) for Cα atoms between WT structure and those of non-proline variants range from 0.10 (A30R) to 0.34 Å (A30E). The structures of GTP (or its analog) and Mg2+ ligands were essentially identical in all variant crystals. Even in the GDP- and (GDP+AlF3)-bound complex structures, the GDP, Mg2+ ion, and its ligand atoms were perfectly superimposable with the corresponding parts from other structures.Table ICrystallography data collection and refinement statisticsWT +GppNHpA30P +GDPA30P +GDP+AIF3A30P +GTPA30R +GppNHpA30K +GppNHpA30E +GppNHpA30L +GppNHpData statistics1-aNumbers in parentheses are the corresponding numbers for the highest resolution shells.

The structure of a stearic acid film on a mercury surface was measured as a function of coverage with angstrom resolution. Unlike monolayers on water, the molecules were found here to undergo a transition from surface-parallel to surface-normal orientation with increasing coverage. At high coverage, two condensed hexatic phases of standing-up molecules were found. At low coverage, a two-dimensional (2D) gas phase and condensed single- and double-layered phases of flat-lying molecular dimers were revealed, exhibiting a 1D longitudinal positional order. This system should provide a broader tunability range for nanostructure construction than solid-supported self-assembled monolayers."

Yersinia outer protein mitogen-activated protein MAP kinase high osmolarity growth YopJ YopJ(C/A) sorbitol galactose The extracellular microbial pathogen, Yersinia, disrupts critical signaling pathways in the infected host by injecting, via a type III secretion system, a number of virulence factors, orYersinia outer proteins (Yops)1 into a target host cell (1Cornelis G.R. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 158: 401-408Crossref PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar). Before translocation into the target host, Yops remain in a quiescent state inside the pathogen due to lack of substrate or activator or due to the presence of a chaperone (2Orth K. Curr. Opin. Microbiol. 2002; 5: 38-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). Each effector (Yop) appears to mimic the activity of an eukaryotic protein, which is then used to alter the signaling machinery in the target cell, yielding an advantage for the survival of the pathogen during infection. Identification of the activity of each Yop has uncovered an essential regulatory mechanism utilized by eukaryotic cells. Three of the Yops, YopT (a papain-like protease), YopE (a GTPase-activating protein), and YpkA (a serine kinase), each contribute to the disruption of the actin cytoskeleton, thereby preventing phagocytosis of this extracellular pathogen (3Von Pawel-Rammingen U.

A fourth effector, YopH, is a tyrosine phosphatase that enhances the inhibition of phagocytosis of the pathogen by dephosphorylating proteins in the focal adhesion complex, resulting in the disassembly of this essential complex (6Guan K.L. Dixon J.E. Science. 1990; 249: 553-556Crossref PubMed Scopus (412) Google Scholar, 7Black D.S. Bliska J.B. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 2730-2744Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar, 8Persson C. Carballeira N. Wolf-Watz H. Fallman M. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 2307-2318Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar). Another Yersinia virulence factor, YopJ, blocks the innate immune response by blocking cytokine production and inducing apoptosis in the infected macrophage (2Orth K. Curr. Opin. Microbiol. 2002; 5: 38-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). The infected host cell cannot respond to a Yersinia infection because YopJ inhibits the MAP kinase and NFκB pathways by preventing the activation (via phosphorylation) of the superfamily of mitogen-activated protein kinase kinases (including the MKKs (MAP kinase kinases) and IKKβ (IκB kinase β) (9Orth K. Palmer L.E. Bao Z.Q. Stewart S. Rudolph A.E. Bliska J.B. Dixon J.E. Science. 1999; 285: 1920-1923Crossref PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar). Because the derived secondary structure of YopJ is highly similar to that of the known secondary structure of a cysteine protease from adenovirus and the eukaryotic ubiquitin-like protein protease (Ulp1), YopJ is thought to mimic this type of hydrolase activity. Inactivating mutations in the catalytic triad of YopJ are unable to inhibit the aforementioned signaling pathways, further supporting the proposal that YopJ acts as a protease (10Orth K., Xu, Z. Mudgett M.B. Bao Z.Q. Palmer L.E. Bliska J.B. Mangel W.F. Staskawicz B. Dixon J.E. Science. 2000; 290: 1594-1597Crossref PubMed Scopus (434) Google Scholar). Homologues of YopJ, collectively referred to as YopJ proteases, are found in plant and animal pathogens as well as in a plant symbiont. A homologue expressed by the animal pathogen Salmonella, AvrA, inhibits only the NFκB pathway but not the MAP kinase pathways and requires an intact catalytic triad for this activity (11Collier-Hyams L.S. Zeng H. Sun J. Tomlinson A.D. Bao Z.Q. Chen H. Madara J.L. Orth K. Neish A.S. J. Immunol. 2002; 169: 2846-2850Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Similarly, a homologue from Xanthomonas, AvrBst, requires a functional catalytic site for induction of the host defense response in plant cells (10Orth K., Xu, Z. Mudgett M.B. Bao Z.Q. Palmer L.E. Bliska J.B. Mangel W.F. Staskawicz B. Dixon J.E. Science. 2000; 290: 1594-1597Crossref PubMed Scopus (434) Google Scholar). Members of the YopJ family of proteases from both the plant and animal pathogens disrupt/modulate signaling pathways in the eukaryotic host by a mechanism that involves some type of hydrolase activity, resulting in disruption of homeostasis in the infected cell. To date, all of the effectors expressed by Yersinia disrupt signaling in the target cells by disrupting the homeostasis of posttranslational modifications. For example, the extremely active tyrosine phosphatase YopH dephosphorylates cellular targets so efficiently that the complementary kinases are unable to maintain a regulated state (6Guan K.L. Dixon J.E. Science. 1990; 249: 553-556Crossref PubMed Scopus (412) Google Scholar, 7Black D.S. Bliska J.B. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 2730-2744Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar, 8Persson C. Carballeira N. Wolf-Watz H. Fallman M. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 2307-2318Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar). Similar scenarios are observed with the serine kinase YpkA and with the GTPase-activating protein YopE (3Von Pawel-Rammingen U. Telepnev M.V. Schmidt G. Aktories K. Wolf-Watz H. Rosqvist R. Mol. Microbiol. 2000; 36: 737-748Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar, 5Juris S.J. Rudolph A.E. Huddler D. Orth K. Dixon J.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 9431-9436Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). The effector YopJ is proposed to disrupt a reversible posttranslational modification in the form of an ubiquitin-like protein. The secondary structure of YopJ is similar to that of the proteases AVP and Ulp1, which cleave ubiquitin conjugates and ubiquitin-like protein conjugates, respectively (10Orth K., Xu, Z. Mudgett M.B. Bao Z.Q. Palmer L.E. Bliska J.B. Mangel W.F. Staskawicz B. Dixon J.E. Science. 2000; 290: 1594-1597Crossref PubMed Scopus (434) Google Scholar, 12Mossessova E. Lima C.D. Mol.

Sci. 1997; 22: 393-398Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Therefore, YopJ is thought to disrupt an essential posttranslational modification that is required for activation of mammalian MAP kinase and NFκB pathways. Yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) MAP kinase signaling pathways have an architecture similar to the signaling pathways utilized by higher eukaryotes, which consist of regulated kinase cascades and cell surface receptors that receive and transmit extracellular signals (15Gustin M.C. Albertyn J. Alexander M. Davenport K. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 1998; 62: 1264-1300Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Genetic studies on ubiquitin-like protein conjugation in yeast demonstrate that this system is evolutionarily conserved and essential for survival (13Li S.-J. Hochstrasser M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 2367-2377Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar). Because YopJ is a member of a family of virulence factors that are conserved in both animal and plant pathogens, it is appealing to propose that the targets of YopJ in these signaling pathways are evolutionarily conserved and utilized in a similar manner in yeast (2Orth K. Curr. Opin. Microbiol. 2002; 5: 38-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar, 16Staskawicz B.J. Mudgett M.B. Dangl J.L. Galan J.E. Science. 2001; 292: 2285-2289Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar). Herein, we utilize yeast genetics to demonstrate that the MAP kinase pathways used for pheromone (mating pathway) and high osmolarity growth (HOG pathway) can be inhibited by YopJ but not by the catalytically inactive form of YopJ, demonstrating that the mechanism of regulation disrupted by YopJ is evolutionarily conserved. All yeast strains used were obtained from the BY4741/2/3 series from Research Genetics (Huntsville, AL). All yeast media containing 2% dextrose (Glu) or 2% raffinose, 1% galactose (Gal) were prepared as described (17Rose M.D. Winston F. Hieter P. Methods in Yeast Genetics: A Laboratory Course Manual.

Science. 2000; 290: 1594-1597Crossref PubMed Scopus (434) Google Scholar), using a 5′ oligonucleotide encoding anEcoRI site and a 3′ oligonucleotide encoding a FLAG epitope tag followed by a termination codon and a XhoI site. PCR products were cloned into p413Gal1 (18Mumberg D. Muller R. Funk M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 5767-5768Crossref PubMed Scopus (792) Google Scholar). Yeast transformations were carried out by the lithium acetate procedure (19Schiestl R.H. Gietz R.D. Curr. Genet. 1989; 16: 339-346Crossref PubMed Scopus (1762) Google Scholar). Tetrad analysis was carried out as described (17Rose M.D. Winston F. Hieter P. Methods in Yeast Genetics: A Laboratory Course Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1990Google Scholar). Antibodies used in this study include anti-FLAG M2 (Sigma #A2220), anti-phospho-p44/42 MAP kinase antibody (Cell Signaling #9101), anti-Fus3p (Santa Cruz #sc-6722), anti-phospho-P38 antibody (Cell Signaling #9211), anti-Hog1p (Santa Cruz #sc-6815), and anti-porin (Molecular Probes, #A-6449). Immunoreactive species were detected by immunoblot analysis using horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit (Amersham Biosciences), anti-mouse (Amersham Biosciences), or anti-goat (Amersham Biosciences) followed by visualization with enhanced chemiluminescence detection reagents (Amersham Biosciences, ECL+). Halo assays were performed as described in Hoffman et al. (20Hoffman G.A. Garrison T.R. Dohlman H.G. Methods Enzymol. 2002; 344: 617-631Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Liquid cultures (2% raffinose, 1% galactose) were induced with 50 nm α factor (Sigma A-3917) for 15 min and terminated by snap-freezing in dry ice/isopropanol followed by extraction of total protein as described by Ooi et al. (21Ooi C.E. Rabinovich E. Dancis A. Bonifacino J.S. Klausner R.D. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 3515-3523Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). Yeast cultures were grown on plates containing either 2% dextrose or 2% raffinose, 1% galactose in the presence or absence of 1 m sorbitol. Liquid cultures were stimulated for the indicated periods of time with 0.7 m sorbitol and terminated by snap-freezing in dry ice/isopropanol followed by extraction of total protein as described by Ooi et al. (21Ooi C.E. Rabinovich E. Dancis A. Bonifacino J.S. Klausner R.D. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 3515-3523Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). To determine whether YopJ would affect the yeast MAP kinase pathways, the expression of YopJ is put under the control of a GAL1promoter resulting in the induction of YopJ expression only when induced by growth on galactose. When the parental strain BY4741 (Research Genetic, Inc.) is transformed with either an empty vector (V), wild type YopJ (J), or the catalytically inactive form of YopJ (J(C/A)), immunoblot analysis confirms that wild type YopJ and the mutant YopJ(C172A) are expressed on media containing galactose (Gal) but are not detectable on media containing glucose (Glu) (Fig. 1 A). To analyze whether YopJ has any effect on the ability of yeast cells to respond to the pheromone-regulated MAP kinase pathway, we assayed whether cells could respond to α factor in the presence of wild type YopJ but not in the presence of the catalytically inactive form of YopJ. The growth inhibition by pheromone on the MATa cells is assessed by formation of halos in the presence of α factor (20Hoffman G.A. Garrison T.R. Dohlman H.G. Methods Enzymol. 2002; 344: 617-631Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Yeast cells with either an empty vector or expressing the catalytically inactive form of YopJ (J(C/A)) plasmid are able to produce halos of similar size in response to α factor (Fig. 1 B). However, almost undetectable halos are formed with yeast cells expressing wild type YopJ, indicative of a disruption in the pheromone signaling pathway (Fig. 1 B). To quantitatively analyze how effectively YopJ blocks the pheromone signaling pathway, the efficiency of mating of the various yeast strains was determined. Mating of the BY4741-MATa cells with haploid BY4742-MATα cells results in the predicted number of diploid cells based on the number of BY4741-MATa cells mated to a 10-fold excess of BY4742-MATα cells (Fig. 1 C). Likewise, BY4741-MATa cells expressing the catalytically inactive form of YopJ (J(C/A)) mated with excess BY4742-MATα cells produce diploid cells similar in number to the vector control (Fig. 1 C). In contrast, when BY4741-MATa cells expressing the wild type YopJ are mated with excess BY4742-MATα cells, mating efficiency is only ∼10% that of cells containing empty vector (Fig. 1 C). These results support the proposal that expression of wild type YopJ but not the catalytically inactive mutant YopJ, compromises the ability of yeast cells to respond to pheromone stimulus by disrupting an evolutionarily conserved signaling mechanism in a MAP kinase pathway. Yeast cells treated with pheromone trigger the mating response and also activate an adaptation response by inducing the expression of proteins that allow the yeast to recover from growth inhibition induced by pheromone. One of these proteins is a secreted protease (Sst1p) that degrades α factor, thereby limiting the external zone of stimulus (22Chan R. Otte C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1982; 2: 21-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). Adaptation is also regulated by a GTPase-activating protein (Sst2p) that stimulates the hydrolysis of GTP by the active α G-protein subunit, Gpa1p, thereby accelerating the rate of recovery to basal state in the pheromone-stimulated yeast cells (23Dohlman H.G. Song J., Ma, D. Courchesne W.E. Thorner J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 5194-5209Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Deletion of either SST1or SST2results inMATa yeast strains that are hypersensitive to α factor and, thus, form superhalos in the presence of pheromone. To test whether YopJ blocks the pheromone-sensing MAP kinase pathway upstream or downstream of pheromone-induced transcription, wild type and mutant YopJ were transformed into the sst1Δ andsst2Δ strains and assayed for their ability to form halos in response to α factor. The sst2Δ cells containing either an empty vector or overexpressing the catalytically inactive mutant YopJ (C172A) under the control of the GAL promoter formed superhalos in the presence of α factor (Fig. 2 A). In contrast,sst2Δ cells expressing wild type YopJ failed to form superhalos (Fig. 2 A). Similar results were observed with thesst1Δ strain (data not shown). These results indicate that the block by the Yersinia effector YopJ was upstream of the transcriptionally induced adaptive response. Previous studies demonstrate that YopJ is able to block the activation of the MAP kinase pathway in mammalian cells upstream of the MAP kinase activation (9Orth K. Palmer L.E. Bao Z.Q. Stewart S. Rudolph A.E. Bliska J.B. Dixon J.E. Science. 1999; 285: 1920-1923Crossref PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar). To assess whether YopJ blocks the mating pathway at a similar point, cells containing empty vector, overexpressing wild type YopJ or the catalytically inactive YopJ under the control of theGAL promoter were tested for their ability to affect phosphorylation levels of the pheromone-induced MAPK Fus3p. When the cells containing empty vector or overexpressing the catalytically inactive YopJ (C/A) are treated with pheromone, the MAPK Fus3p is activated by phosphorylation as shown in Fig. 2 B. When cells overexpressing wild type YopJ are treated with α factor, a very low level of Fus3p phosphorylation is detected (Fig. 2 B). The low level of phosphorylated Fus3p observed in YopJ-expressing cells is consistent with inability of YopJ-expressing cells to mate efficiently. Therefore, similar to what is observed with mammalian MAP kinase signaling pathways, YopJ blocks the pheromone MAPK pathway upstream of the activation of the MAP kinase. YopJ blocks mammalian MAP kinase signaling pathways and the yeast pheromone-sensing pathway, suggesting a conserved regulatory mechanism underlying the MAP kinase pathways. To further support this hypothesis we tested whether YopJ had any effect on the HOG MAP kinase pathway by growing the various yeast strains on media containing 1 m sorbitol (Sorb). When these strains are grown on dextrose medium (no induction of the GALpromoter) and transferred to dextrose plates containing 1 msorbitol, all strains adapt to media containing 1 msorbitol by activating the HOG MAP kinase pathway (Fig. 3 A). When these strains are grown on galactose plates (induction of YopJ expression) and transferred to galactose media containing 1 m sorbitol, cells containing empty vector or the catalytically inactive YopJ(C/A), but not cells overexpressing wild type YopJ, are able to adapt and grow on media containing 1 m sorbitol (Fig. 3 B). Therefore, the expression of the active form of YopJ has an adverse effect on the ability of yeast to adapt to hyperosmotic stress as indicated by the lack of growth. To determine whether the YopJ effect was reversible, we tested whether cells overexpressing wild type YopJ from the 1 m Sorb-Gal plate that are growth-inhibited could recover and grow on a 1 m Sorb-Glu plate. As observed in Fig. 3 C, the “growth-inhibited” cells overexpressing wild type YopJ from the 1 m Sorb-Gal plate are able to recover and grow in a manner similar to that of cells grown on glucose and 1 m sorbitol. Turning off YopJ expression allows cells to adapt and grow in media containing 1 m sorbitol, thereby demonstrating that the effect caused by YopJ expression is reversible. These observations are consistent with the hypothesis that YopJ affects the equilibrium of a reversible posttranslational modification. To further explore the possibility that YopJ blocks the HOG MAP kinase pathway, we tested whether YopJ would rescue the lethality of the constitutively induced HOG pathway in a sln1Δ mutant strain. Sln1p is an osmolarity sensor that negatively regulates the HOG pathway by inhibiting the activation of the downstream kinases (24Maeda T. Wurglermurphy S.M. Saito H. Nature. 1994; 369: 242-245Crossref PubMed Scopus (932) Google Scholar,25Maeda T. Takekawa M. Saito H. Science. 1995; 269: 554-558Crossref PubMed Scopus (553) Google Scholar). In the absence of Sln1p, the MAP kinases are constitutively active, which leads to a lethal phenotype, as is demonstrated by tetrad analysis of SLN1/sln1Δ diploids, which produce tetrads with a ratio of 2:2 live:dead segregants (26Ota I.M. Varshavsky A. Science. 1993; 262: 566-569Crossref PubMed Scopus (362) Google Scholar). The lethal phenotype ofsln1Δ can be rescued by mutations in the downstream kinases Ssk2p, Pbs2p, or Hog1p (24Maeda T. Wurglermurphy S.M. Saito H. Nature. 1994; 369: 242-245Crossref PubMed Scopus (932) Google Scholar). SLN1/sln1Δ diploids containing an empty vector (V), wild type YopJ (J), or catalytically inactive YopJ C172A (J(C/A)) under the control of the GALpromoter were induced to sporulate, and tetrads were dissected for spore survival. Dissected tetrads from theSLN1:sln1Δ strain containing empty vector (V) or catalytically inactive YopJ (C/A) plasmid (J(C/A)) results in the expected live:dead segregant ratio of 2:2 (TableI). In contrast, when tetrads fromSLN1/sln1Δ strain containing wild type YopJ plasmid (J) are dissected, 67% of the tetrads produced three or more viable colonies, supporting the hypothesis that YopJ inhibits HOG MAP kinase pathway, resulting in survival of the sln1Δ segregants (Table I). As expected, the four colonies from tetrads of theSLN1:sln1Δ cells containing wild type YopJ plasmid exhibit a live:dead ratio of 2:2 when plated on G418 because the SLN1 was deleted by KanMX4 (SaccharomycesDeletion Project). All spores from tetrads of theSLN1:sln1Δ cells containing wild type YopJ plasmid with a live:dead ratio of 4:0 also exhibited a 2:2 segregation for appropriate auxtrophic markers. Extended growth on rich media resulted in a loss of the YopJ plasmid (HIS3 marker) in strains encoding wild type SLN1 (G418-sensitive). Loss of the YopJ plasmid was not observed in the G418-resistant segregants, indicating that maintenance of this plasmid was required for growth of thesln1Δ cells. The rescued lethality of sln1Δ by YopJ should be due to an extremely low level of expression of YopJ on dextrose (undetectable by Western blot analysis). The results were the same regardless of source of carbon (galactose or dextrose) used in the media for dissections. These genetic observations support the model that YopJ blocks the HOG MAP kinase pathway downstream of the osmolarity sensor Sln1p.Table IYopJ rescues lethality of a sln1Δ mutationLive:Dead segregant ratio4:03:12:21:3V00365J1611130J(C/A)00365SLN1/sln1Δ diploid cells transformed with control vector (V), wild type YopJ (J), or mutant YopJ (J(C/A)) were grown in galactose medium and transferred to sporulation medium.

Ratio of live:dead segregants are indicated. As with all MAP kinase pathways, the distal kinase to be activated in these pathways is the MAP kinase, and in the case of the HOG MAP kinase pathway, this kinase is Hog1p (27Wurglermurphy S.M. Maeda T. Witten E.A. Saito H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 1289-1297Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar, 28O'Rourke S.M. Herskowitz I. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 2874-2886Crossref PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar). In cells containing empty vector or overexpressing the catalytically inactive YopJ grown on galactose media containing 0.7 m sorbitol, the Hog1p is activated, via phosphorylation, as is observed in Fig. 4. In contrast, cells overexpressing the wild type YopJ induced with the same media are unable to activate the Hog1p (Fig. 4). Therefore, the Yersinia effector YopJ appears to block the HOG MAP kinase pathway downstream of Sln1p and upstream of Hog1p. Herein, genetic experiments are described that demonstrate MAP kinase pathways in yeast are susceptible to inhibition by theYersinia effector YopJ. The point of inhibition is upstream of the activation of the MAP kinase and downstream of the receptor-mediated stimulus. The mechanism of inhibition by YopJ is reversible and, as with mammalian cells, not lethal. These results show that the mechanism of inhibition mediated by the Yersiniaeffector YopJ is evolutionarily conserved from yeast to mammals. The molecules used to transmit signals via the MAP kinase pathways are extremely conserved in evolution from yeast to human and even to plants (15Gustin M.C. Albertyn J. Alexander M. Davenport K. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 1998; 62: 1264-1300Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 29Jonak C. Okresz L. Bogre L. Hirt H. Curr. Opin. Plant Biol. 2002; 5: 415-424Crossref PubMed Scopus (512) Google Scholar). The conserved proteins utilized in the pathways include, but are not limited to, G-proteins, kinases, phosphatases, chaperones, and scaffolds. Regulation of these systems appears to be dictated by the activation of a cascade of kinases, which results in the activation of transcription machinery that in turn produces a response. In addition, eukaryotic cells will also induce adaptation responses so that the signaling machinery is reset and able to respond to new stimuli. Many of these regulatory functions are carried out by reversible posttranslational modifications that can be attenuated by additional reversible posttranslational modifications. Previous studies demonstrate that the functions encoded by the effectors from extracellular pathogen Yersinia mimic essential activities used in the regulation of these critical eukaryotic signaling pathways. When injected into the host target cell, the effectors act to tip the delicate balance of a reversible posttranslational modification, thereby overriding the host intracellular signaling machinery in favor of the pathogen during infection. For example, one of these effectors, YopH, is an extremely active tyrosine phosphatase that, once inside an infected macrophage, dephosphorylates focal adhesion signaling machinery at a rate for which no kinase can compensate. All of the effectors to date have captured some type of enzymatic activity that deregulates eukaryotic signaling machinery and whose activity is kept quiescent in the prokaryotic pathogen (2Orth K. Curr. Opin. Microbiol. 2002; 5: 38-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar, 16Staskawicz B.J. Mudgett M.B. Dangl J.L. Galan J.E. Science. 2001; 292: 2285-2289Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar). The Yersinia effector YopJ also has the characteristics of a typical Yersinia effector in that it encodes an enzymatic activity that disrupts eukaryotic signaling machinery and tips the balance of equilibrium to an off state. Previous studies have demonstrated that YopJ but not the catalytically inactive form of YopJ, is able to disrupt eukaryotic signaling pathways by preventing the activation of the MAP kinase kinase (MKK) superfamily. The similarity of YopJ to the family of adenoviral proteases, which can cleave ubiquitin conjugates, and to the family of ubiquitin-like protein proteases, which cleave ubiquitin-like protein conjugates, has led to the hypothesis that YopJ may also target this type of reversible posttranslational modification. The activity of YopJ in mammalian cells, as with yeast, is dependent on the maintenance of a conserved catalytic triad, lending credence to the proposal that YopJ functions as a hydrolase to disrupt the signaling pathways. These studies provide evidence that a conserved mechanism of regulation, which is susceptible to inactivation by wild type YopJ, is utilized in the yeast MAP kinase pathways. Because the yeast MAP kinase pathways and yeast ubiquitin-like systems are highly conserved with mammalian systems, yeast is a model system to set up a genetic analysis of the function of the Yersiniaeffector YopJ. Our studies have shown that the mechanism of YopJ inhibition is conserved in yeast, and we have demonstrated that YopJ can inhibit both the pheromone-induced MAP kinase pathway and the HOG MAP kinase pathway. Based on the homology of YopJ with other proteases that attenuate the stability of ubiquitin conjugates and ubiquitin-like protein conjugates, it is tempting to speculate that YopJ might affect this type of reversible posttranslational modification. Recent studies by Firtel and co-workers (30Sobko A., Ma, H. Firtel R.A. Dev. Cell. 2002; 2: 745-756Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar) show that the DictyosteliumMAP kinase kinase is regulated by an ubiquitin-like protein modification (sumoylation), supporting the hypothesis that these signaling pathways can be regulated by yet another reversible posttranslational modification (30Sobko A., Ma, H. Firtel R.A. Dev. Cell. 2002; 2: 745-756Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Studies by O'Rourke et al. (31O'Rourke S.M. Herskowitz I. O'Shea E.K. Trends Genet. 2002; 18: 405-412Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar) observe cross-talk between the MAP kinase pathways in yeast, because some of the upstream signaling components are shared between the two pathways (Fig. 5) (31O'Rourke S.M. Herskowitz I. O'Shea E.K. Trends Genet. 2002; 18: 405-412Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). In our studies with YopJ, we have utilized a branch of the HOG pathway (Sln1) that shares no common components with the mating MAP kinase pathway, thereby leading to our hypothesis that YopJ functions by inhibiting a mechanism that is conserved in multiple MAP kinase pathways. In mammalian cells, YopJ prevents the activation of the family of MAP kinase kinases (9Orth K. Palmer L.E. Bao Z.Q. Stewart S. Rudolph A.E. Bliska J.B. Dixon J.E. Science. 1999; 285: 1920-1923Crossref PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar), and we propose in yeast, YopJ prevents the activation of the MAP kinase kinase equivalent; that is, Ste7p for the mating pathway and Pbs2p for the HOG pathway. The mechanism of regulation would involve a step that is sensitive to the hydrolase activity of YopJ, which may be mediated by the proposed sumoylation sites on Ste7 (30Sobko A., Ma, H. Firtel R.A. Dev. Cell. 2002; 2: 745-756Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Alternatively, the mechanism may be mediated by a yet-to-be described modification that is susceptible to YopJ activity. Future genetic and biochemical studies in yeast will focus on the identification of the targets of YopJ, which will help to identify an evolutionarily conserved regulatory mechanism of eukaryotic MAP kinase signaling pathways.

It has now been confirmed that rRNA plays the major role in ribosomal structure and function, including the two most important activities of the ribosome: the decoding process and the peptidyltransferase activity. The 16 S rRNA of the small ribosomal subunit is responsible for the decoding process, the selection of the cognate tRNA (6Carter A.P. Clemons W.M., Jr. Brodersen D.E. Morgan-Warren R.J. Wimberly B.T. Ramakrishnan V. Nature. 2000; 407: 340-348Google Scholar).

It is still possible that the rate of peptide bond formation is influenced by structural rearrangements of RNA in the peptidyltransferase center that would affect the positioning of the substrates (14Polacek N.

Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 7236-7244Google Scholar) appear to affect the decoding process. Moreover, some ribosomal proteins appear to influence the peptidyltransferase activity of the ribosome (22Wower I.K. Wower J. Zimmermann R.A. J. Biol.

Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 8101-8108Google Scholar).Yeast ribosomal protein L41 is the smallest and the most basic eukaryotic protein. Its open reading frame is composed of only 25 amino acids, 17 of which are arginines or lysines (25Suzuki K. Hashimoto T. Otaka E. Curr. Genet. 1990; 17: 185-190Google Scholar). L41 is highly conserved in eukaryotes and it is present in certain archaea,e.g. Methanococcus jannaschii, but not in eubacteria. A protein with similar properties is present in certain thermophilic eubacteria, e.g. Thermus thermophilus (26Choli T. Franceschi F. Wittmann-Liebold B. Yonath A. Biol. Chem. Hoppe-Seyler. 1993; 374: 377-383Google Scholar). In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, L41 is encoded by two genes, RPL41A and RPL41B (25Suzuki K. Hashimoto T. Otaka E. Curr. Genet. 1990; 17: 185-190Google Scholar). In a recent study, the properties and the translation of the mRNAs encoding L41 were investigated (27Yu X. Warner J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 33821-33825Google Scholar). It was found that the L41 mRNAs are translated exclusively on monosomes and the entire translation process from initiation through to termination occurs in about 2 s. However, as with most ribosomal proteins, the function of L41 remains unknown (27Yu X. Warner J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 33821-33825Google Scholar).There is evidence that suggests that protein L41 may possess extraribosomal activity; it associates directly in vitrowith subunit b of protein kinase CKII, although it is not a substrate for CKII phosphorylation. However, L41 protein stimulates the phosphorylation of DNA topoisomerase IIa by CKII. Additionally, L41 enhances the autophosphorylation of CKIIa (28Lee J.H. Kim J.M. Lee Y.T. Marshak D.R. Bae Y.S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 238: 462-467Google Scholar). These data indicate that L41 associates with CKII and can modulate its activity toward a specific substrate(s).In the present work we tried to gain insight into the role of protein L41 in protein synthesis. For this purpose we examined two yeast strains. The first lacked the two genes encoding L41. The second strain lacked L41 in addition to the absence of L24 and L39, two eukaryote-specific proteins studied recently (21Dresios J. Derkatch I.L. Liebman S.W. Synetos D. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 7236-7244Google Scholar, 24Dresios J. Panopoulos P. Frantziou C.P. Synetos D. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 8101-8108Google Scholar). The fact that the cells remained viable upon removal of the two genes encoding L41 in addition to the absence of the two genes encoding L24 and the single gene encoding L39, allowed for the first time the study of a quintuple mutant in yeast as well as the study of the role of L41 in combination with the effects of the other two proteins. Our results suggest that a dispensable ribosomal protein such as L41 may affect in varying degrees several important functions of yeast ribosomes confirming the interconnectedness of these ribosomal activities.DISCUSSIONIn an effort to contribute to the understanding of yeast ribosomal structure and function, we examined the role(s) of ribosomal protein L41. For this purpose we used two strains, one in which the two genes for L41 were deleted and a second strain, in which the two genes for L41 were deleted from a background already lacking the genes for L24 and L39. We have found that in the absence of L24 and L39 the cell exhibited reduced protein synthesis activity and decreased translational accuracy, two closely related functions (21Dresios J. Derkatch I.L. Liebman S.W. Synetos D. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 7236-7244Google Scholar). Thus, this was an appropriate background in which to study the effect of the absence of a third protein, L41, on the above functions.We found that protein L41 is dispensable for the yeast S. cerevisiae. This is the third case of a eukaryotic ribosomal protein, not found in eubacteria, which is nonessential for cell viability. The other two nonessential proteins, L24 and L39, were found to have significant effects on certain parameters of protein synthesis (21Dresios J. Derkatch I.L. Liebman S.W. Synetos D. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 7236-7244Google Scholar, 24Dresios J. Panopoulos P. Frantziou C.P. Synetos D. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 8101-8108Google Scholar). Specifically, L24 acted on the assembly of ribosomes and the kinetics of protein synthesis, whereas L39 acted on the accuracy of translation and the assembly of the 60 S subunits. Protein L41 is dispensable but it is not entirely innocuous to the cell: doubling times were somewhat longer in L41 mutants than wild type. Lack of L41 caused slight hyperaccuracy (Table II) accompanied by an increase in the resistance to paromomycin. Also, whereas the ratio 60:40 S remained stable, there was a decrease in the amount of 80 S ribosomes. Because this was not accompanied by a similar decrease in the amount of polysomes, it could imply that L41 is not involved in the initiation phase of protein synthesis, a notion that needs further evaluation.The most pronounced effects of L41 are on the ribosomal peptidyltransferase activity (Table III and Fig. 4) and the translocation process of protein synthesis (Figs. 6 and 7). The peptidyltransferase activity of the ribosome was lowered 3-fold in the absence of L41. Likewise, the catalytic activity of the quintuple mutant was substantially lowered relative to that of the triple mutant. These results indicate a significant role for L41 in peptide bond formation. The presence of this dispensable protein is required so that the ribosome can exhibit its full catalytic activity. Because the ribosome is a ribozyme, it can only be surmised that L41 exerts its effect indirectly, possibly via allosteric interactions.The absence of L41 allowed increased elongation factor-independent (spontaneous) translocation. Also, the absence of L41 apparently increased the efficiency of elongation factor-dependent translocation, as shown by the lower amounts of EF2 needed to achieve 50% translocation. These data indicate that L41 may belong to a class of ribosomal proteins with a distinct role, that of preventing translocation from occurring spontaneously.Consistent with the role of L41 in translocation is the fact that its absence increased resistance to cycloheximide, a translocation inhibitor (Figs. 5 and 7). These results also suggest that yeast L41 participates in the binding site of cycloheximide on the ribosome. Mutations in two other ribosomal proteins, L42 (39Stevens D.R. Atteia A. Franzèn L.-G. Purton S. Mol. Gen. Genet. 2001; 264: 790-795Google Scholar) and L28 (40Kawai S. Mirato S. Mochizuki M. Shibuya I. Yano K. Takagi M. J. Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 254-262Google Scholar), were also shown to affect cycloheximide resistance. Subsequently, it was suggested that these two proteins may also play a central role in forming the cycloheximide binding site on the 60 S subunit (39Stevens D.R. Atteia A. Franzèn L.-G. Purton S. Mol. Gen. Genet. 2001; 264: 790-795Google Scholar).Multiple deletion mutants are useful in the study of ribosomal assembly and function. A quintuple mutant carrying a deletion of the two genes encoding L41, the two genes encoding L24, and the single gene encoding L39 permitted the cells to remain viable and functioning. The fact that each one of the three proteins is not essential does not necessarily mean that the phenotype obtained from the five gene deletions should have been expected; the three deficiencies together might have resulted in a lethal phenotype. This mutant provided also an alternative way to study the functions of protein L41. This was achieved by comparing the changes that ribosomes from these quintuple mutant cells undergo to those from a triple mutant lacking only L24 and L39. The comparative study of these two mutants reaffirmed the earlier findings that L41 has a limited impact on cell growth, association of ribosomal subunits, translational accuracy, and resistance to paromomycin, but does not affect cell viability or polyphenylalanine synthesis.A-site binding was significantly increased in the quintuple mutant compared with wild type (Table III). It has been suggested that an increase of A-site binding may arise from a higher affinity for accepting noncognate tRNAs and leads to a higher level of translational errors (41Karimi R. Ehrenberg M. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 1149-1154Google Scholar, 42Lodmell J.S. Dahlberg A.E. Science. 1997; 277: 1262-1267Google Scholar). Because the quintuple mutant exhibited a high translational error rate (Table II), our results are in agreement with this suggestion. In contrast, lack of L41 affected A-site binding slightly. Thus, the quintuple mutant strain exhibited slightly lower A-site binding over the triple mutant and so did the L41 mutant over the wild type, in agreement with the fact that L41 causes slight hyperaccuracy.It is interesting to note that the absence of L24 and L39 did not render the ribosome more susceptible to the absence of L41. In fact, the differences observed between L41 mutant and wild type were very similar to those between quintuple and triple mutants and fully accounted for by the absence of L41 alone in each of the two cases.The quintuple mutant YKS121 provides not only a useful tool with which to investigate the role of ribosomal protein L41; it also provides a measure of the degree of deterioration of the vital activities a eukaryotic cell can withstand. It is shown that cells tolerate at least a 4-fold decrease in the rate of protein synthesis as measured by the puromycin reaction (Table III) combined with a 3½-fold decrease in the fidelity of translation (Table II).It is worth mentioning that polyphenylalanine synthesis is marginally affected in the L41 mutants over the wild type or in the quintuple over the triple mutants, whereas peptidyltransferase activity is lowered 3- and 2-fold, respectively, although peptide bond formation is a reaction of the elongation cycle of protein synthesis. A similar effect,i.e. a significant reduction of peptide bond formation but much less impairment of polyphenylalanine synthesis has been observed with a series of 23 S rRNA mutations (43Spahn C.M. Schafer M.A. Krayevsky A.A. Nierhaus K.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 32857-32862Google Scholar) or with ribosomal protein L2 (23Diedrich G. Spahn C.M.T. Stelzl U. Schäfer M.A. Wooten T. Bochkariov D.E. Cooperman B.S. Traut R.R. Nierhaus K.H. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 5241-5250Google Scholar). These results may be explained by the hypothesis that the two processes have different rate-limiting steps. In fact the rate-limiting step of the elongation cycle is the occupation of the A-site and this is much slower than peptidyl transfer (44Bilgin N. Ehrenberg M. Kurland C. FEBS Lett. 1988; 233: 95-99Google Scholar, 45Schilling-Bartetzko S. Bartetzko A. Nierhaus K.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 4703-4712Google Scholar). For the puromycin reaction, however, the rate-limiting step is the peptide bond formation and not the binding of puromycin to the A-site (23Diedrich G. Spahn C.M.T. Stelzl U. Schäfer M.A. Wooten T. Bochkariov D.E. Cooperman B.S. Traut R.R. Nierhaus K.H. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 5241-5250Google Scholar). As a result, a significant reduction in the rate of peptidyltransferase activity would more strongly decrease the rate of the puromycin reaction than the rate of polyphenylalanine synthesis.In conclusion, the absence of protein L41 affected in varying degrees three of the main activities of the ribosome, i.e.peptide bond formation, translocation, and decoding, adding to the notion that these activities are interrelated and that some ribosomal proteins may possess more than one ribosomal function. Similar observations have been made recently for other ribosomal proteins, such as L39, the absence of which decreased translational fidelity but increased somewhat the ribosomal peptidyltransferase activity (21Dresios J. Derkatch I.L. Liebman S.W. Synetos D. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 7236-7244Google Scholar, 24Dresios J. Panopoulos P. Frantziou C.P. Synetos D. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 8101-8108Google Scholar). Likewise, several deleterious mutations in domain V of 23 S rRNA (9O'Connor M. Lee W-C.M. Mankad A. Squires C.L. Dahlberg A.E. Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: 710-715Google Scholar) have been linked with peptide bond formation whereas they also affect the fidelity of decoding, an activity of the small ribosomal subunit. Moreover, a model has been proposed in Escherichia coliwhereby elongation factor G promotes translocation by modulating the communication between the peptidyltransferase domain of 23 S rRNA and the decoding region of 16 S rRNA during elongation (46Koosha H. Cameron D. Andrews K. Dalberg A.E. March P.E. RNA (N. Y.). 2000; 6: 1166-1173Google Scholar). This communication may be achieved in various ways; for example, signals from the decoding center on the small subunit to the peptidyltransferase center on the large subunit can be transmitted either by ligands that contact both regions, e.g. bound tRNAs, or by the intersubunit bridges that connect the subunits (47Spahn C.M.T. Beckmann R. Eswar N. Penczek P.A. Sali A. Blobel G. Frank J. Cell. 2001; 107: 373-386Google Scholar). The ribosome is a large macromolecular machine that consists of a large number of proteins and several molecules of ribosomal RNA (rRNA). The ribosome is responsible for the translation of the genetic message, which results in protein synthesis. The crystal structures of the 30 S (1Wimberly B.T. Brodersen D.E. Clemons W.M.

Schluenzen F. Zarivach R. Bashan A. Gat S. Agmon I. Bartels H. Franceschi F. Yonath A. Cell. 2001; 107: 679-688Google Scholar) ribosomal subunits, and the intact 70 S ribosome (5Yusupov M.M. Yusupova G.Z. Baucom A. Lieberman K. Earnest T.N. Cate J.H. Noller H.F. Science. 2001; 292: 883-896Google Scholar) are contributing to a better understanding of ribosomal function. It has now been confirmed that rRNA plays the major role in ribosomal structure and function, including the two most important activities of the ribosome: the decoding process and the peptidyltransferase activity. The 16 S rRNA of the small ribosomal subunit is responsible for the decoding process, the selection of the cognate tRNA (6Carter A.P. Clemons W.M., Jr. Brodersen D.E. Morgan-Warren R.J. Wimberly B.T. Ramakrishnan V. Nature. 2000; 407: 340-348Google Scholar). The central loop of domain V of 23 S rRNA of the large ribosomal subunit is responsible for the catalytic activity of the ribosome (7Nissen P. Hansen J. Ban N. Moore P.B. Steitz T.A. Science. 2000; 289: 920-930Google Scholar, 8Muth G.W. Ortoleva–Donnelly L. Strobel S.A. Science. 2000; 289: 947-950Google Scholar). The search is still underway to identify a critical site or nucleotide(s) of 23 S rRNA involved in the catalysis of peptide bond formation (9O'Connor M. Lee W-C.M. Mankad A. Squires C.L.

Scaringe S.A. Strobel S.A. Moore P.B. Steitz T.A. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2002; 9: 225-230Google Scholar). It is still possible that the rate of peptide bond formation is influenced by structural rearrangements of RNA in the peptidyltransferase center that would affect the positioning of the substrates (14Polacek N. Gaynor M. Yassin A. Mankin A.S. Nature. 2001; 411: 498-501Google Scholar). Ribosomal proteins offer structural support to the ribosome by stabilizing and orienting the ribosomal RNA into a specific, active structure (15Cech T.R. Science. 2000; 289: 878-879Google Scholar). Also, they are crucial for the assembly of functional ribosomes (16Stern S. Powers T. Changchien L.M. Noller H.F. Science. 1989; 244: 783-790Google Scholar). Several ribosomal proteins of the small subunit (17Vincent A. Liebman S.W. Genetics. 1992; 132: 375-386Google Scholar, 18Alksne L.E. Anthony R.A. Liebman S.W. Warner J.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Acta. 1996; 1309: 156-166Google Scholar) and at least one of the large subunit (21Dresios J. Derkatch I.L. Liebman S.W. Synetos D. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 7236-7244Google Scholar) appear to affect the decoding process. Moreover, some ribosomal proteins appear to influence the peptidyltransferase activity of the ribosome (22Wower I.K. Wower J. Zimmermann R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 19847-19852Google Scholar, 23Diedrich G. Spahn C.M.T. Stelzl U. Schäfer M.A. Wooten T. Bochkariov D.E. Cooperman B.S. Traut R.R. Nierhaus K.H. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 5241-5250Google Scholar, 24Dresios J. Panopoulos P. Frantziou C.P. Synetos D. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 8101-8108Google Scholar). Yeast ribosomal protein L41 is the smallest and the most basic eukaryotic protein. Its open reading frame is composed of only 25 amino acids, 17 of which are arginines or lysines (25Suzuki K. Hashimoto T. Otaka E. Curr. Genet. 1990; 17: 185-190Google Scholar). L41 is highly conserved in eukaryotes and it is present in certain archaea,e.g. Methanococcus jannaschii, but not in eubacteria. A protein with similar properties is present in certain thermophilic eubacteria, e.g. Thermus thermophilus (26Choli T. Franceschi F. Wittmann-Liebold B. Yonath A. Biol. Chem. Hoppe-Seyler. 1993; 374: 377-383Google Scholar). In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, L41 is encoded by two genes, RPL41A and RPL41B (25Suzuki K. Hashimoto T. Otaka E. Curr. Genet. 1990; 17: 185-190Google Scholar). In a recent study, the properties and the translation of the mRNAs encoding L41 were investigated (27Yu X. Warner J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 33821-33825Google Scholar). It was found that the L41 mRNAs are translated exclusively on monosomes and the entire translation process from initiation through to termination occurs in about 2 s. However, as with most ribosomal proteins, the function of L41 remains unknown (27Yu X. Warner J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 33821-33825Google Scholar). There is evidence that suggests that protein L41 may possess extraribosomal activity; it associates directly in vitrowith subunit b of protein kinase CKII, although it is not a substrate for CKII phosphorylation. However, L41 protein stimulates the phosphorylation of DNA topoisomerase IIa by CKII. Additionally, L41 enhances the autophosphorylation of CKIIa (28Lee J.H. Kim J.M. Lee Y.T. Marshak D.R. Bae Y.S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 238: 462-467Google Scholar). These data indicate that L41 associates with CKII and can modulate its activity toward a specific substrate(s). In the present work we tried to gain insight into the role of protein L41 in protein synthesis. For this purpose we examined two yeast strains. The first lacked the two genes encoding L41. The second strain lacked L41 in addition to the absence of L24 and L39, two eukaryote-specific proteins studied recently (21Dresios J. Derkatch I.L. Liebman S.W. Synetos D. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 7236-7244Google Scholar, 24Dresios J. Panopoulos P. Frantziou C.P. Synetos D. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 8101-8108Google Scholar). The fact that the cells remained viable upon removal of the two genes encoding L41 in addition to the absence of the two genes encoding L24 and the single gene encoding L39, allowed for the first time the study of a quintuple mutant in yeast as well as the study of the role of L41 in combination with the effects of the other two proteins. Our results suggest that a dispensable ribosomal protein such as L41 may affect in varying degrees several important functions of yeast ribosomes confirming the interconnectedness of these ribosomal activities. DISCUSSIONIn an effort to contribute to the understanding of yeast ribosomal structure and function, we examined the role(s) of ribosomal protein L41. For this purpose we used two strains, one in which the two genes for L41 were deleted and a second strain, in which the two genes for L41 were deleted from a background already lacking the genes for L24 and L39. We have found that in the absence of L24 and L39 the cell exhibited reduced protein synthesis activity and decreased translational accuracy, two closely related functions (21Dresios J. Derkatch I.L. Liebman S.W. Synetos D. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 7236-7244Google Scholar). Thus, this was an appropriate background in which to study the effect of the absence of a third protein, L41, on the above functions.We found that protein L41 is dispensable for the yeast S. cerevisiae. This is the third case of a eukaryotic ribosomal protein, not found in eubacteria, which is nonessential for cell viability. The other two nonessential proteins, L24 and L39, were found to have significant effects on certain parameters of protein synthesis (21Dresios J. Derkatch I.L. Liebman S.W. Synetos D. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 7236-7244Google Scholar, 24Dresios J. Panopoulos P. Frantziou C.P. Synetos D. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 8101-8108Google Scholar). Specifically, L24 acted on the assembly of ribosomes and the kinetics of protein synthesis, whereas L39 acted on the accuracy of translation and the assembly of the 60 S subunits. Protein L41 is dispensable but it is not entirely innocuous to the cell: doubling times were somewhat longer in L41 mutants than wild type. Lack of L41 caused slight hyperaccuracy (Table II) accompanied by an increase in the resistance to paromomycin. Also, whereas the ratio 60:40 S remained stable, there was a decrease in the amount of 80 S ribosomes. Because this was not accompanied by a similar decrease in the amount of polysomes, it could imply that L41 is not involved in the initiation phase of protein synthesis, a notion that needs further evaluation.The most pronounced effects of L41 are on the ribosomal peptidyltransferase activity (Table III and Fig. 4) and the translocation process of protein synthesis (Figs. 6 and 7). The peptidyltransferase activity of the ribosome was lowered 3-fold in the absence of L41. Likewise, the catalytic activity of the quintuple mutant was substantially lowered relative to that of the triple mutant. These results indicate a significant role for L41 in peptide bond formation. The presence of this dispensable protein is required so that the ribosome can exhibit its full catalytic activity. Because the ribosome is a ribozyme, it can only be surmised that L41 exerts its effect indirectly, possibly via allosteric interactions.The absence of L41 allowed increased elongation factor-independent (spontaneous) translocation. Also, the absence of L41 apparently increased the efficiency of elongation factor-dependent translocation, as shown by the lower amounts of EF2 needed to achieve 50% translocation. These data indicate that L41 may belong to a class of ribosomal proteins with a distinct role, that of preventing translocation from occurring spontaneously.Consistent with the role of L41 in translocation is the fact that its absence increased resistance to cycloheximide, a translocation inhibitor (Figs. 5 and 7). These results also suggest that yeast L41 participates in the binding site of cycloheximide on the ribosome. Mutations in two other ribosomal proteins, L42 (39Stevens D.R. Atteia A. Franzèn L.-G. Purton S. Mol. Gen. Genet. 2001; 264: 790-795Google Scholar) and L28 (40Kawai S. Mirato S. Mochizuki M. Shibuya I. Yano K. Takagi M. J. Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 254-262Google Scholar), were also shown to affect cycloheximide resistance. Subsequently, it was suggested that these two proteins may also play a central role in forming the cycloheximide binding site on the 60 S subunit (39Stevens D.R. Atteia A. Franzèn L.-G. Purton S. Mol. Gen. Genet. 2001; 264: 790-795Google Scholar).Multiple deletion mutants are useful in the study of ribosomal assembly and function. A quintuple mutant carrying a deletion of the two genes encoding L41, the two genes encoding L24, and the single gene encoding L39 permitted the cells to remain viable and functioning. The fact that each one of the three proteins is not essential does not necessarily mean that the phenotype obtained from the five gene deletions should have been expected; the three deficiencies together might have resulted in a lethal phenotype. This mutant provided also an alternative way to study the functions of protein L41. This was achieved by comparing the changes that ribosomes from these quintuple mutant cells undergo to those from a triple mutant lacking only L24 and L39. The comparative study of these two mutants reaffirmed the earlier findings that L41 has a limited impact on cell growth, association of ribosomal subunits, translational accuracy, and resistance to paromomycin, but does not affect cell viability or polyphenylalanine synthesis.A-site binding was significantly increased in the quintuple mutant compared with wild type (Table III). It has been suggested that an increase of A-site binding may arise from a higher affinity for accepting noncognate tRNAs and leads to a higher level of translational errors (41Karimi R. Ehrenberg M. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 1149-1154Google Scholar, 42Lodmell J.S. Dahlberg A.E. Science. 1997; 277: 1262-1267Google Scholar). Because the quintuple mutant exhibited a high translational error rate (Table II), our results are in agreement with this suggestion. In contrast, lack of L41 affected A-site binding slightly. Thus, the quintuple mutant strain exhibited slightly lower A-site binding over the triple mutant and so did the L41 mutant over the wild type, in agreement with the fact that L41 causes slight hyperaccuracy.It is interesting to note that the absence of L24 and L39 did not render the ribosome more susceptible to the absence of L41. In fact, the differences observed between L41 mutant and wild type were very similar to those between quintuple and triple mutants and fully accounted for by the absence of L41 alone in each of the two cases.The quintuple mutant YKS121 provides not only a useful tool with which to investigate the role of ribosomal protein L41; it also provides a measure of the degree of deterioration of the vital activities a eukaryotic cell can withstand.

Schafer M.A. Krayevsky A.A. Nierhaus K.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 32857-32862Google Scholar) or with ribosomal protein L2 (23Diedrich G. Spahn C.M.T. Stelzl U. Schäfer M.A. Wooten T. Bochkariov D.E. Cooperman B.S. Traut R.R. Nierhaus K.H. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 5241-5250Google Scholar).

In fact the rate-limiting step of the elongation cycle is the occupation of the A-site and this is much slower than peptidyl transfer (44Bilgin N. Ehrenberg M. Kurland C.

It is interesting to note that the absence of L24 and L39 did not render the ribosome more susceptible to the absence of L41. In fact, the differences observed between L41 mutant and wild type were very similar to those between quintuple and triple mutants and fully accounted for by the absence of L41 alone in each of the two cases. The quintuple mutant YKS121 provides not only a useful tool with which to investigate the role of ribosomal protein L41; it also provides a measure of the degree of deterioration of the vital activities a eukaryotic cell can withstand. It is shown that cells tolerate at least a 4-fold decrease in the rate of protein synthesis as measured by the puromycin reaction (Table III) combined with a 3½-fold decrease in the fidelity of translation (Table II). It is worth mentioning that polyphenylalanine synthesis is marginally affected in the L41 mutants over the wild type or in the quintuple over the triple mutants, whereas peptidyltransferase activity is lowered 3- and 2-fold, respectively, although peptide bond formation is a reaction of the elongation cycle of protein synthesis. A similar effect,i.e. a significant reduction of peptide bond formation but much less impairment of polyphenylalanine synthesis has been observed with a series of 23 S rRNA mutations (43Spahn C.M. Schafer M.A. Krayevsky A.A. Nierhaus K.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 32857-32862Google Scholar) or with ribosomal protein L2 (23Diedrich G. Spahn C.M.T. Stelzl U. Schäfer M.A. Wooten T. Bochkariov D.E. Cooperman B.S. Traut R.R. Nierhaus K.H. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 5241-5250Google Scholar). These results may be explained by the hypothesis that the two processes have different rate-limiting steps. In fact the rate-limiting step of the elongation cycle is the occupation of the A-site and this is much slower than peptidyl transfer (44Bilgin N. Ehrenberg M. Kurland C. FEBS Lett. 1988; 233: 95-99Google Scholar, 45Schilling-Bartetzko S. Bartetzko A. Nierhaus K.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 4703-4712Google Scholar). For the puromycin reaction, however, the rate-limiting step is the peptide bond formation and not the binding of puromycin to the A-site (23Diedrich G. Spahn C.M.T. Stelzl U. Schäfer M.A. Wooten T. Bochkariov D.E. Cooperman B.S. Traut R.R. Nierhaus K.H. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 5241-5250Google Scholar). As a result, a significant reduction in the rate of peptidyltransferase activity would more strongly decrease the rate of the puromycin reaction than the rate of polyphenylalanine synthesis. In conclusion, the absence of protein L41 affected in varying degrees three of the main activities of the ribosome, i.e.peptide bond formation, translocation, and decoding, adding to the notion that these activities are interrelated and that some ribosomal proteins may possess more than one ribosomal function. Similar observations have been made recently for other ribosomal proteins, such as L39, the absence of which decreased translational fidelity but increased somewhat the ribosomal peptidyltransferase activity (21Dresios J. Derkatch I.L. Liebman S.W. Synetos D. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 7236-7244Google Scholar, 24Dresios J. Panopoulos P. Frantziou C.P. Synetos D. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 8101-8108Google Scholar). Likewise, several deleterious mutations in domain V of 23 S rRNA (9O'Connor M. Lee W-C.M. Mankad A. Squires C.L. Dahlberg A.E. Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: 710-715Google Scholar) have been linked with peptide bond formation whereas they also affect the fidelity of decoding, an activity of the small ribosomal subunit. Moreover, a model has been proposed in Escherichia coliwhereby elongation factor G promotes translocation by modulating the communication between the peptidyltransferase domain of 23 S rRNA and the decoding region of 16 S rRNA during elongation (46Koosha H. Cameron D. Andrews K. Dalberg A.E. March P.E. RNA (N. Y.). 2000; 6: 1166-1173Google Scholar). This communication may be achieved in various ways; for example, signals from the decoding center on the small subunit to the peptidyltransferase center on the large subunit can be transmitted either by ligands that contact both regions, e.g. bound tRNAs, or by the intersubunit bridges that connect the subunits (47Spahn C.M.T. Beckmann R. Eswar N. Penczek P.A. Sali A. Blobel G. Frank J. Cell. 2001; 107: 373-386Google Scholar). We thank Professor Jon Warner for making several yeast strains available to us.

The phorbol ester 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA) is often used to induce AP-1 activity. The purpose of this work was to explore the molecular mechanisms involved in the TPA regulation of ubiquitous 5-aminolevulinate synthase (ALAS) gene expression, the first and rate-controlling step of the heme biosynthesis. Previous analysis of the 5′-flanking sequence of ALAS revealed the existence of two cAMP-response elements (CRE) required for basal and cAMP-stimulated expression. The fragment −833 to +42 in the 5′-flanking region of rat ALAS gene was subcloned into a chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) reporter vector. The expression vector pALAS/CAT produced a significant CAT activity in transiently transfected HepG2 human hepatoma cells, which was repressed by TPA. Sequence and deletion analysis detected a TPA response element (TRE), located between −261 and −255 (TRE-ALAS), that was critical for TPA regulation. We demonstrated that c-Fos, c-Jun, and JunD are involved in TPA inhibitory effect due to their ability to bind TRE-ALAS, evidenced by supershift analysis and their capacity to repress promoter activity in transfection assays. Repression of ALAS promoter activity by TPA treatment or Fos/Jun overexpression was largely relieved when CRE protein-binding protein or p300 was ectopically expressed. When the TRE site was placed in a different context with respect to CRE sites, it appeared to act as a transcriptional enhancer. We propose that the decrease in ALAS basal activity observed in the presence of TPA may reflect a lower ability of this promoter to assemble the productive pre-initiation complex due to CRE protein-binding protein sequestration. We also suggest that the transcriptional properties of this AP-1 site would depend on a spatial-disposition-dependent manner with respect to the CRE sites and to the transcription initiation site.

AP-1 is a dimeric complex composed of members of the Fos and Jun family proteins (1Wisdom R. Exp. Cell Res. 1999; 253: 180-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (338) Google Scholar). This complex binds the consensus DNA sequence TGA(G/C)TCA, termed 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA)-response element (TRE) or AP-1, sites found in a variety of promoters of genes, such as growth factors, chemokines, and cytokines (2Angel P. Imagawa M. Chiu R. Stein B. Imbra R.J. Rahmsdorf H.J. Jonat C. Herrlich P. Karin M. Cell. 1987; 49: 729-739Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2155) Google Scholar). The Fos family contains four proteins (c-Fos, Fos-B, Fra-1, and Fra-2), whereas the Jun family is composed of three (c-Jun, JunB, and JunD). Fos and Jun are members of the basic leucine zipper group of proteins, and this basic motif mediates the formation of homo- and heterodimers. c-Jun is the major component of the AP-1 complex, and c-Fos is its best known partner (3Nishina H. Sato H. Suzuki T. Sato M. Iba H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 3619-3623Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar,4Angel P. Karin M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1991; 1072: 129-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (3270) Google Scholar). AP-1 is activated by mitogens, oncoproteins, cytokines, and stress agents such as ultraviolet light. The phorbol ester TPA is often used to induce AP-1 activity. The activation of this protein may be mediated both by transcriptionally independent and dependent mechanisms, which involve post-translational modifications of its components or increases in the expression of their corresponding genes, respectively (5Karin M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 16483-16486Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2256) Google Scholar,6Karin M. Hunter T. Curr. Biol. 1995; 5: 747-757Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (666) Google Scholar). Transcription coactivators bridge transcription factors and the components of the basal transcriptional apparatus (7Horwitz K.B. Jackson T.A. Bain D.L. Richer J.K. Takimoto G.S. Tung I. Mol. Endocrinol. 1996; 10: 1167-1177Crossref PubMed Scopus (837) Google Scholar). One important class of coactivators includes the cAMP-response element protein (CREB)-binding protein (CBP) and the highly related p300 protein, which were originally identified for their ability to interact strongly with CREB (8Arias J. Alberts A.S. Brindle P. Claret F.X. Smeal T. Karin M. Feramisco J. Montminy M. Nature. 1994; 370: 226-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (681) Google Scholar). Subsequently, CBP and p300 were identified as essential cofactors for a number of nuclear transcription factors, including AP-1 complex (9Albanese C. D'Amico M. Reutens A.T., Fu, M. Watanabe G. Lee R.J. Kitsis R.N. Henglein B. Avantaggiati M. Somasundaram K. Thimmapaya B. Pestell R.G. J. Biol.

Avantaggiati M.L. J. Cell. Physiol. 1999; 181: 218-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar), other histone acetyltransferases (SRC-1, ACTR and P/CAF) (11Lee S. Kim H., Na, S. Kim T. Choi H., Im, S. Lee J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 16651-16654Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar), developmental proteins (GATA-1, MEF-2, Pit-1) (12Liu S.L. Rand A. Kelm R.J., Jr. Getz M.J. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 3352-3362Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar), viral oncoproteins (E1A, large T antigen, and Tax) (13Goodman R.H. Smolik S. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 1553-1577PubMed Google Scholar), and nuclear receptors (14Lee S.K. Jung S.Y. Kim Y.S., Na, S.Y. Lee Y.C. Lee J.W. Mol. Endocrinol. 2001; 15: 241-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). These coactivator proteins are important not only due to their role in positive transcriptional regulation from DNA binding sites but also due to their role as mediators of cross-talk between different signal transduction pathways (15Cheng X. Reginato M.J. Andrews N.C. Lazar M.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 1407-1416Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Although negative binding elements have been described, repression is mainly conducted by interference with other transcription factors, of which AP-1 is one of the most representative (16Saatcioglu F. Claret F.X. Karin M. Semin. Cancer Biol. 1994; 5: 347-359PubMed Google Scholar). CBP has been reported to play a significant role in the negative cross-talk between members of the nuclear receptor family, including glucocorticoid receptor, retinoic acid receptor, thyroid hormone receptor, and AP-1 activity, without inhibition of DNA binding (17Kamei Y., Xu, L. Heinzel T. Torchia J. Kurokawa R. Gloss B. Lin S.C. Heyman R.A. Rose D. Glass C.K. Rosenfeld M.G. Cell. 1996; 85: 403-414Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1926) Google Scholar, 18Ko L.

Res. Commun. 1999; 1: 7-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Several independent approaches revealed that CBP is necessary for the activation of both AP-1 and of nuclear hormone receptors (NHR) as well. As has been suggested, competition for limiting amounts of CBP may account for many of the inhibitory effects of NHR on AP-1 activation (17Kamei Y., Xu, L. Heinzel T. Torchia J. Kurokawa R. Gloss B. Lin S.C. Heyman R.A. Rose D. Glass C.K. Rosenfeld M.G. Cell. 1996; 85: 403-414Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1926) Google Scholar, 20Mc Kenna N.J. Lanz R.B. O'Malley B.W. Endocr. Rev. 1999; 20: 321-344PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, on genes containing NHR binding sites but lacking AP-1 binding sites, positive regulation by liganded NHR is inhibited by activation of AP-1. Conversely, liganded NHR can inhibit AP-1-mediated transcription. In this paper, we present a distinct mechanism of negative cross-talk between CREB and AP-1 that involves competition by CBP on the transcriptional activity of 5-aminolevulinate synthase (ALAS) gene promoter. ALAS is a mitochondrial matrix enzyme that catalyzes the first and rate-limiting step of heme biosynthesis (21Kappas A. Sassa S. Galbraith R.A. Nordmann Y. Scriver C.R. Beaudet A.L. Sly W.S. Valle D. The Metabolic and Molecular Basis of Inherited Diseases. 7th Ed. McGraw-Hill Inc., New York1995: 2103-2159Google Scholar). There are two related ALAS isozymes that are encoded by two separate genes located on different chromosomes. The erythroid cell-specific enzyme or ALAS-2 is developmentally regulated, and it markedly increases during erythropoiesis to meet the demand for heme during hemoglobin production. The second enzyme, ubiquitous or liver type ALAS (ALAS-1), is probably expressed in all tissues to provide heme for cytochromes and other hemoproteins (21Kappas A. Sassa S. Galbraith R.A. Nordmann Y. Scriver C.R. Beaudet A.L. Sly W.S. Valle D. The Metabolic and Molecular Basis of Inherited Diseases. 7th Ed. McGraw-Hill Inc., New York1995: 2103-2159Google Scholar, 22May B.K. Dogra S.C. Sadlon T.J. Bhasker C.R. Cox T.C. Bottomley S.S. Prog. Nucleic Acid Res. Mol. Biol. 1995; 51: 1-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Expression of ALAS in the liver was found to be subject to feedback regulation by heme (21Kappas A. Sassa S. Galbraith R.A. Nordmann Y. Scriver C.R. Beaudet A.L. Sly W.S. Valle D. The Metabolic and Molecular Basis of Inherited Diseases. 7th Ed. McGraw-Hill Inc., New York1995: 2103-2159Google Scholar). In addition to this major mechanism of regulation, we have demonstrated that cAMP induces and phorbol esters repress the expression of liver ALAS through protein kinase A (PKA) and protein kinase C (PKC) activation, respectively (23Varone C.L. Cánepa E.T. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1997; 341: 259-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar, 24Varone C.L. Giono L.E. Ochoa A. Zakin M.M. Cánepa E.T. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1999; 372: 261-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Studies carried out on the 5′-regulatory region of ALAS gene showed the presence of two functional CRE-like sites that are necessary not only for the cAMP-mediated induction but also for basal expression. These sites are bounded by CREB and recruit coactivator CBP (25Giono L.E. Varone C.L. Cánepa E.T. Biochem. J. 2001; 353: 307-316Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). The purpose of this study was to examine the molecular mechanism underlying TPA-inhibited expression of ALAS gene. Promoter deletion analysis were performed on the ALAS gene, which, as we have already demonstrated, is repressed by TPA (23Varone C.L. Cánepa E.T. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1997; 341: 259-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). We found that an AP-1 binding site (TRE-ALAS) was crucial for the inhibition of the ALAS promoter despite its widely reported positive responsiveness to TPA in several promoters (26Sakamoto S. Taniguchi T. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 37237-37241Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar, 27Simon C. Simon M. Vucelic G. Hicks M.J. Plinkert P.K. Koitschev A. Zenner H.P. Exp. Cell Res. 2001; 271: 344-355Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). The nuclear heterodimeric complexes that bind to TRE-ALAS would be composed of c-Fos and c-Jun or c-Fos and JunD. In addition, our data indicate that overexpression of CBP relieved TPA repression, suggesting that sequestration of CBP prevents the downstream formation of the CREB·CBP complex necessary for basal transcription of ALAS gene. This competition for limiting the intracellular amount of a common coactivator could explain the bizarre inhibitory effect of TPA on ALAS gene expression. Finally, we observed different responses to TPA depending on the relative position of TRE and CRE sites on the ALAS promoter. Therefore, AP-1 complex on TRE-ALAS would interfere in a disposition-dependent manner with the transcription machinery through CBP sequestration during the inhibition of ALAS gene expression. Eagle's minimum essential medium, guanidine isothiocyanate, TPA, 4α-phorbol-12,13-diacetate (4αPDA), agarose, calphostin C, chloramphenicol, butyryl coenzyme A, 8-CPT-cAMP, ando-nitrophenyl-β-d-galactopyranoside were purchased from Sigma. [ring-3,5-3H]Chloramphenicol (specific activity 1.1–2.2 GBq/mmol), [γ-32P]ATP (specific activity 222 TBq/mmol), and [α-32P]dCTP (specific activity 111 TBq/mmol) were purchased from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. Random primers kit, restriction endonucleases, and DNA modifying enzymes were from New England Biolabs, Inc. All other chemicals were of analytical grade. Oligodeoxynucleotides were chemically synthesized by Bio-Synthesis Inc. (Lewisville, TX). The following expression vectors were used as indicated in each experiment. Plasmid pALAS/CAT contains the 5′-flanking region (−833 to +42 bp) of rat ubiquitous ALAS gene cloned upstream the CAT reporter gene in vector pBLCAT6. Deletion mutant plasmids p-459ALAS/CAT, p-354ALAS/CAT, p-156ALAS/CAT, and p-75ALAS/CAT were described previously (25Giono L.E. Varone C.L. Cánepa E.T. Biochem. J. 2001; 353: 307-316Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Vectors pSG5 encoding wild type forms of c-Fos, c-Jun, JunB or JunD, and a pRc/RSV vector encoding the cDNA for the wild type version of CBP were kindly provided by Dr. P. Sassone-Corsi (Institut de Génétique et de Biologie Moléculaire et Cellulaire, Strasbourg, France). Vector pCEFLp300 encoding cDNA for the wild type version of p300 was a gift from Dr. J. Silvio Gutkind (NIDCR, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD). The pCMV/A-Fos (designated pA-Fos) is a cytomegalovirus-driven expression vector in which the normal basic region critical for DNA binding at the N terminus of the Fos leucine zipper was replaced for an acidic sequence (a generous gift from Dr. Charles Vinson, NCI, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD) (28Olive M.

The plasmid pTRE-tk-CAT contains two TRE consensus sequence upstream of the HSV thymidine kinase promoter (29Icard-Liepkalns C. Biguet N.F. Vyas S. Robert J.J. Sassone-Corsi P. Mallet J. J. Neurosci. Res. 1992; 32: 290-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). The heterologous pASCAT vector, in which a copy of the −354 to −156-bp sequence of ALAS gene was placed upstream of the thymidine kinase promoter, was generated by cloning theAflII/StuI fragment of pACAT into theSalI site of pBLCAT2. Similarly, pAECATd or pAECATi vectors containing a copy of the −354 to −38-bp sequence of ALAS gene in the right or inverted position, respectively, upstream of the thymidine kinase promoter were generated by cloning theAflII/BstEII fragment of pACAT into theSalI site of pBLCAT2. The mutations were generated by polymerase chain reaction-based site-directed mutagenesis (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). In p-354ALAS/CATm, pAECATdm, and pAECATim vectors the TRE-ALAS site was mutated from wild-type TGACGCA (coding strand) to TGACGTG (coding strand). The fidelity of all mutated vectors was checked by DNA sequence. Plasmid pCEFL containing the β-galactosidase gene was also used. To perform transfection assays, plasmids were purified using the WizardPlus Maxipreps (Promega Co). DNA concentration was estimated spectrophotometrically. The human hepatoma cell line HepG2 was grown as monolayer cultures in minimum essential medium supplemented with 10% (v/v) heat-inactivated fetal calf serum and 1% penicillin-streptomycin, 100 μm nonessential amino acids, and 2 mm glutamine. Cells were cultured in a humidified atmosphere with 5% CO2 at 37 °C. For RNA analysis, phenobarbital and TPA were added to HepG2 cells at 75% confluence in 100-mm tissue culture plates for the times and concentrations detailed in the figure legends. Phenobarbital was dissolved in 0.1 ml of the corresponding medium. Phorbol esters and calphostin C were dissolved in a small volume (less than 0.5% of the total volume of culture media) of Me2SO. Total cellular RNA was isolated from cultured HepG2 cells according to Chomczinsky and Sacchi (30Chomczinsky P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 71: 341-350Google Scholar). The yield and purity of RNA samples were assessed by the ratio of absorbance at 260 and 280 nm. For Northern blot analysis, 20 μg of total RNA were denatured, electrophoresed in 1% glyoxal-agarose gels, and transferred to nylon membranes (Hybond N,Amersham Biosciences). The membranes were sequentially hybridized with32P-labeled probes to human liver ALAS and β-tubulin. To detect ALAS mRNA, a 26-mer oligodeoxynucleotide was synthesized complementary to bases +328 to +353 of human ubiquitous ALAS mRNA (31Bishop D.F. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 7187-7188Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). The oligodeoxynucleotide was purified and 5′-end-labeled using [γ-32P]ATP and T4polynucleotide kinase. The resulting probe had a specific activity of about 5–6 × 103 cpm/fmol. Hybridization was carried out overnight at 70 °C in the same prehybridization solution by adding the 32P-labeled oligodeoxynucleotide (3.0 × 105 cpm/cm2) as previously described (24Varone C.L. Giono L.E. Ochoa A. Zakin M.M. Cánepa E.T. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1999; 372: 261-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). To detect β-tubulin mRNA, chicken β-tubulin cDNA (a generous gift of Dr. J. Messina, Florida) was labeled by random priming using [α-32P]dCTP and Klenow to a specific activity of about 6 × 108 cpm/μg. Membranes were stripped, prehybridized, hybridized, and washed in standard conditions described by Sambrook et al. (32Sambrook, J., and Russell, D. W. (2001) Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual, 3rd Ed., pp. 7.42–7.45 and 17.48–17.51, Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press Cold Spring Harbor, NYGoogle Scholar). Autoradiographs were obtained by exposing these blots to Kodak XAR-5 film with an intensifying screen for 3–5 days at −70 °C. HepG2 transient transfections were performed according to the standard calcium phosphate precipitation method as previously described (25Giono L.E. Varone C.L. Cánepa E.T. Biochem. J. 2001; 353: 307-316Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). In brief, 4 μg of pALAS/CAT or its derivatives and 6 μg of pCEFLβgal were cotransfected into 5 × 105 cells plated on 35-mm Petri dishes. The β-galactosidase plasmid was used as the internal standard to normalize transfection efficacy. The use of other cotransfected plasmids is indicated in each experiment. The amount of Fos/Jun, CBP, and p300 expression vectors that have been used in the different experiments was previously determined through dose-response curves. Different quantities of the plasmids mentioned were co-transfected into HepG2 cells together with p-354ALAS/CAT, and CAT expression was measured. The minimum amount of each plasmid that produced the maximum effect was used in later experiments. Final DNA concentration was adjusted to 30 μg/35-mm dish with nonspecific DNA carrier. Control transfections with carrier alone and carrier plus vector pBLCAT6 or pBLCAT2 were done in parallel. Sixteen hours later, the medium was replaced with 3 ml of serum-free medium containing the reagents indicated in each experiment and incubated for 24 h. Then cells were collected, and CAT activity was measured in cell extracts as described previously (25Giono L.E. Varone C.L. Cánepa E.T. Biochem. J. 2001; 353: 307-316Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar) according to the Seed and Sheen phase-extraction method (33Seed B. Sheen J.Y.

The β-galactosidase activity was determined spectrophotometrically in the transfected cell extracts (32Sambrook, J., and Russell, D. W. (2001) Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual, 3rd Ed., pp. 7.42–7.45 and 17.48–17.51, Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press Cold Spring Harbor, NYGoogle Scholar). CAT activity was expressed as the amount of radiolabeled chloramphenicol acetylated by 1 mg of protein in 1 min and normalized with β-galactosidase activity. β-Galactosidase activity was not modified by any of the treatments used. The protein concentration of the cell extracts was determined by the Bradford assay (34Bradford M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (216391) Google Scholar). Nuclear extracts were prepared from TPA-stimulated and unstimulated HepG2 cells as described by Andrews and Faller (35Andrews N.C. Faller D.V. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 2499-2503Crossref PubMed Scopus (2211) Google Scholar). Double-strand DNA probes and cold competitors used were TRE-ALAS (AP-1 site located at −261 bp), 5′-AGGAGTCTGACGCACAGGGCT-3′, and mutant, 5′-AGGAGTCTGACGTGCAGGGCT-3′, called TRE-ALASmut, in which the underlined bases have been mutated to disrupt the specific binding of AP-1-binding proteins. A positive control oligodeoxynucleotide containing a consensus AP-1 binding site, 5′-CGCTTGATGAGTCAGCCGGAA-3′, and an oligodeoxynucleotide containing a consensus CRE site corresponding to the −58 to −31 bp of rat somatostatin gene promoter 5′-AGAGATTGCCTGACGTCAGAGAGCTAG-3′, were also used. Oligodeoxynucleotides were 5′-end-labeled with T4polynucleotide kinase and 222 TBq/mmol [γ-32P]dATP at 37 °C for 60 min. Binding reactions were performed mixing 10 μg of the nuclear extract with 2 μg of poly(dI-dC) and 150,000 dpm of the labeled probe in TM buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.9, 12.5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 20% (v/v) glycerol) to a final volume of 20 μl and incubated at room temperature for 30 min. When noted, the nuclear extract was incubated for 20 min at room temperature in a binding mixture with the indicated molar excess of unlabeled competitor DNA before the addition of labeled probe. After the binding reaction, electrophoresis was carried out through a 5% non-denaturating polyacrylamide gel containing 0.25× TBE (1× TBE: 50 mmTris borate, pH 8.3, 1 mm EDTA). The gel was then dried, and autoradiography was performed. The supershift analysis was performed by incubating the nuclear extract with 3 μl of specific antibody at 4 °C for 4 h before the band shift assays already described. Antibodies against c-Fos, c-Jun, and JunD were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). HepG2 cells were plated on 100-mm dishes (2 × 106) and transfected with 2.5 μg of CBP expression vector, where CBP was tagged with HA, or the backbone vector using Escort transfection reagent according to the recommendations of the manufacturer (Sigma). Two days after transfection, total cell lysates were prepared in radioimmune precipitation assay buffer (1× phosphate-buffered saline, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 10 μg/ml phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 60 μg/ml aprotinin, and 1 mm sodium orthovanadate). The lysates were centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 10 min to remove cell debris. Cleared lysates (100 μg) were immunoprecipitated with monoclonal anti-HA antibody (Santa Cruz). The immune complexes were recovered on protein A/G-agarose beads (Santa Cruz) for 1 h at 4 °C and then washed 4 times with phosphate-buffered saline. The precipitated proteins were resuspended in sample buffer containing 2% SDS and 30 mmβ-mercaptoethanol, boiled for 3 min, fractionated by SDS-PAGE on a 10% gel, and thereafter blotted to a nitrocellulose membrane. The membrane was then immunoblotted with polyclonal anti-rabbit anti-phospho-CREB (Cell Signaling Technology). The antibody was detected using horseradish peroxidase-linked goat anti-rabbit IgG (Sigma) and visualized by the Pierce Super Signal Ultra Chemiluminescence signaling systems and a Bio-Imaging Analyzer Fujifilm LAS-1000. For direct immunoblotting of cell proteins, total cell lysates of parallel samples were fractionated by electrophoresis in SDS-PAGE on a 10% gel, and the proteins were transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane. Protein CREB was detected using the rabbit polyclonal antibody anti-CREB (Cell Signaling). The immune complexes were visualized by chemiluminescence as describe above. We first studied the effect of TPA on the expression of ALAS gene in HepG2 cells either in basal or induced conditions. These cells were incubated with 1 μm TPA for up to 24 h in the presence or the absence of 0.6 mm phenobarbital, a well known inducer of ALAS gene expression (36Schuurmans M.M. Hoffmann F. Lindberg R.L. Meyer U.A. Hepatology. 2001; 33: 1217-1222Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Northern blot analysis showed that in both cases there was a time-dependent decrease in mRNA levels for ALAS, suggesting that TPA inhibited ALAS gene expression in HepG2 cells (Fig. 1 A). The TPA concentration-response relationship for ALAS mRNA inhibition revealed a dose-dependent effect. TPA was effective over a concentration range of 10−8 to 10−5m, and maximum inhibition was reached at 10−6m and over (Fig. 1 B). These results agree with previous observations made in primary cultures of rat hepatocytes (23Varone C.L. Cánepa E.T. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1997; 341: 259-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). To determine whether sequences in the 5′-flanking region of the ALAS gene could confer TPA responsiveness, we fused about 870 bp of this region to the bacterial reporter gene for CAT. HepG2 cells were transiently transfected with this ALAS/CAT vector and then incubated with different amounts of TPA before harvesting and analysis of CAT activity (Fig. 1 C). TPA caused a dose-dependent inhibition in ALAS/CAT expression with a maximum decrease of almost 5-fold in untreated cells and 8-fold in cells exposed to 0.6 mm phenobarbital. The action of 4αPDA, a TPA analog that is ineffective in tumor promotion and PKC activation, was tested to exclude the possibility of a general inhibitory effect due to incubation with phorbol esters. The addition of 1 μm4αPDA failed to reduce ALAS/CAT expression (data not shown). In many cell types, prolonged treatment with phorbol esters resulted in almost complete depletion of cellular PKC. Because PKC activation led to inhibition of ALAS gene expression, HepG2 cells transiently transfected with ALAS/CAT were pretreated with 1 μm TPA for 12 h to determine whether PKC diminution by translocation to the cell membrane prevented this inhibition. We observed that prolonged PKC stimulation resulted in the blockage of ALAS inhibition by TPA both in basal and phenobarbital-stimulated conditions (data not shown). Furthermore, incubation of ALAS/CAT-transfected HepG2 cells with 1 μm calphostin C, a PKC inhibitor, resulted in the blockage of the inhibitory effect of 1 μm TPA on ALAS promoter activity (Fig. 2). These results suggest that PKC is involved in the inhibitory effect of ALAS gene expression. To identifycis-acting response elements in the 5′-flanking region of the rat ALAS gene that are TPA-responsive, a series of progressively longer deletion mutants of ALAS/CAT were constructed. As in the case of ALAS/CAT, these deletion promoter mutants were transiently transfected into HepG2 cells and assayed for CAT activity in the absence and presence of 1 μm TPA. As shown in Fig. 3, progressive deletion of sequences from −833 to −354 bp did not significantly impair TPA-mediated inhibition of promoter acti"
https://openalex.org/W1985902149,"CooA from Rhodospirillum rubrum is a heme-containing transcriptional activator that becomes activated only upon binding CO. The basis for this specificity has been probed in a CooA variant, termed ΔP3R4 CooA, lacking two residues adjacent to the Pro2 heme ligand, which weakens that ligand. ΔP3R4 CooA can bind imidazole and CN−, as well as CO, and form a 6-coordinate low spin adduct with each. However, in contrast to the case with CO, imidazole and CN− do not stimulate the DNA binding activity of ΔP3R4 CooA. This result indicates that the CO-specific activation of CooA is not merely the result of creation of a 6-coordinate CooA adduct but that there must be another element to this response. One feature of CooA activation is modest repositioning of the C-helices upon CO binding, so we altered a portion of the C-helix (residues Ile113 and Leu116) located near the heme-bound CO in wild type CooA, and we investigated the effect on CO-specific activation. Surprisingly, the sizes of Ile113 and/or Leu116 positions are not critical for CooA activation by CO, disproving a precise interaction between these residues and the CO-bound heme as a basis for the CO activation mechanism and CO ligand specificity. In contrast, hydrophobic residues at these positions contribute to the activation. Some CooA variants altered at these positions in the background of ΔP3R4 were also found to show low but reproducible activation in response to imidazole binding to the heme. A model for the role of hydrophobicity in CooA activation and specificity is suggested.

Ludden P.W. Roberts G.P. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 2241-2244Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The response of this organism to CO is regulated by the CooA protein, which binds CO and then activates the transcription of a series of genes encoding the CO oxidation system of R. rubrum (2He Y. Shelver D. Kerby R.L. Roberts G.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 120-123Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). CooA contains ab-type heme prosthetic group as do many other gas-sensing proteins such as soluble guanylyl cyclase, FixL, DOS, and HemAT (3Marletta M.A. Cell. 1994; 78: 927-930Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (817) Google Scholar, 4Gilles-Gonzales M.A. Ditta G.S.

Nature. 2000; 403: 540-544Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). The heme of CooA is 6-coordinate and low spin in all oxidation and ligation states (7Shelver D. Kerby R.L., He, Y. Roberts G.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 11216-11220Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar), indicating that the incoming CO must displace one of the internal protein ligands. The structure of Fe(II) CooA (without CO and therefore unable to bind DNA) revealed an unprecedented ligation arrangement for a heme protein wherein Pro2 (N-terminal proline from the opposite subunit) and His77 serve as the heme axial ligands (8Lanzilotta W.N. Schuller D.J. Thorsteinsson M.V. Kerby R.L. Roberts G.P. Poulos T.J. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 7: 876-880Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). NMR studies (9Yamamoto K. Ishikawa H.

Chem. 2001; 276: 11473-11476Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar) have indicated that Pro2 is the ligand displaced by CO, and analysis of CooA variants has shown that His77, the retained ligand in Fe(II)-CO CooA, is critical for CooA activation by CO. In contrast to the critical role of His77, alteration of Pro2did not dramatically affect CooA activity in response to CO (10Thorsteinsson M.V. Kerby R.L. Conrad M. Youn H. Staples C.R.

Chem. 2000; 275: 39332-39338Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar), disproving any important role of the displaced Pro2 residue in the active form of CooA. CooA belongs to the same family of transcriptional activators as the cAMP-receptor protein (CRP)1(11Shelver D. Kerby R.L., He, Y. Roberts G.P. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 2157-2163Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Each of these proteins exists in equilibrium between an active form that can bind specific DNA target sequences and an inactive form that cannot. In each case, that equilibrium is shifted toward the active form by binding a small molecule effector, CO for CooA and cAMP for CRP. The structure of the effector-bound form of CRP has been known for some time (12Passner J.M. Schultz S.C. Steitz T.A J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 304: 847-859Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar), but the nature of the effector-free form has largely been speculative, so that the exact conformational change caused by effector binding is unknown. Conversely, although the effector-free structure of CooA has been reported, its effector-bound structure remains unsolved. Nevertheless, because CooA binds a DNA sequence reminiscent of that bound by CRP, it is a reasonable hypothesis that the effector-bound forms of the two proteins will be rather similar, so that a comparison of the two known structures is potentially informative. Each protein is a dimer, and each monomer contains two functionally distinct domains (Fig. 1 A). The effector-binding domain of each protein senses its respective small molecule, which in turn leads to the repositioning of the DNA-binding domain. In each protein, the dimer interface is composed of a long α-helix (designated as C-helix) (8Lanzilotta W.N. Schuller D.J. Thorsteinsson M.V. Kerby R.L. Roberts G.P. Poulos T.J. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 7: 876-880Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar), and comparison of effector-free CooA with effector-bound CRP (8Lanzilotta W.N. Schuller D.J. Thorsteinsson M.V. Kerby R.L. Roberts G.P. Poulos T.J. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 7: 876-880Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar) reveals a repositioning of these two C-helices with respect to each other. Alterations of particular amino acids along these C-helices exert a variety of effects on activity in CRP (13Cheng X. Kovac L. Lee J.C. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 10816-10826Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 14Cheng X. Lee J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 705-712Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar) and fumarate and nitrate reductase activator protein (15Kiley P.J. Reznikoff W.S. J. Bacteriol. 1991; 173: 16-22Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), another member of this family of transcriptional activators. We have also mutationally repositioned the C-helices of CooA, mimicking the structure of effector-bound CRP, and this resulted in CooA variants with activity in the absence of effector (27Kerby, R. L., Youn, H., Thorsteinsson, M. V., and Roberts, G. P. (2003) J. Mol. Biol., in pressGoogle Scholar). These facts suggest a role of the repositioning of the C-helices for the activation of these proteins in response to their respective effectors, and Fig. 1 B compares the C-helix position of inactive CooA with that of active CRP. However, it is not clear how CO binding to the heme of CooA results in such C-helix repositioning. One of the particularly interesting features of CooA is its specificity for CO as the only small molecule that can activate the protein. Small molecules that are weaker ligands than CO fail to displace the Pro2 ligand, whereas NO displaces both protein ligands and leads to an inactive protein (16Reynolds M.F. Parks R.B. Burstyn J.N. Shelver D. Thorsteinsson M.V. Kerby R.L. Roberts G.P. Vogel K.M. Spiro T.G. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 388-396Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar), and O2 binding oxidizes CooA. It was therefore a reasonable hypothesis that the specificity for CO simply reflected its liganding strength. If correct, this would predict that any ligand that could displace Pro2 yet allow a 6-coordinate heme would be similarly active. On the other hand, this result would not be seen if CO bound to the heme affected the achievement of the active form in ways other than simply creating a 6-coordinate species with Pro2 displacement. In this report, we have examined the issue of the role of CO in CooA activation and the related issue of CO specificity. We reasoned that any direct role of the heme-bound CO would almost certainly be affected by the protein residues nearest to that CO, and we have examined the importance of these through a combination of mutational, functional, and spectroscopic analyses. The construction of strains overexpressing wild-type (WT) CooA and CooA variants in an Escherichia coli background having a CooA-dependent β-galactosidase reporter system in the chromosome was described previously (17Shelver D. Thorsteinsson M.V. Kerby R.L. Chung S.Y. Roberts G.P. Reynolds M.F. Parks R.B. Burstyn J.N. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 2669-2678Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). In vivo activities of WT CooA and CooA variants were measured using the above system and quantitated using the standard protocol (18Ausubel, F. M., Brent, R., Kingston, R. E., Moore, D. D., Seidman, J. G., Smith,J. A., and Struhl, K. (eds) (1995) Short Protocols in Molecular Biology, 3rd Ed., pp. 13-30, John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New YorkGoogle Scholar). All the CooA variants were constructed in a pEXT20-based expression plasmid that provides tight control of cooA expression (10Thorsteinsson M.V. Kerby R.L. Conrad M. Youn H. Staples C.R.

Site-directed mutagenesis involved PCR amplification of cooA with primers designed to incorporate the desired nucleotide changes, as described elsewhere (19Chiang L.W. Kovari I. Howe M.M. PCR Methods Applications. 1993; 2: 210-217Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). The method used for codon randomization was essentially identical to the method used for site-directed mutagenesis, except that the primers contained randomized codons for the desired positions. Screening of CooA variants involved the analysis of their ability to cause β-galactosidase accumulation in colonies on agar plates incubated under different growth conditions as described previously (10Thorsteinsson M.V. Kerby R.L. Conrad M. Youn H. Staples C.R. Lanzilotta W.N. Poulos T.J. Serate J. Roberts G.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 39332-39338Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Based on colony color, CooA variants were classified as active, weakly active, and inactive. Selected variants were examined quantitatively by the in vivo β-galactosidase assay, after which the cooA genes were sequenced to determine the causative residue changes. Imidazole (25 mm final concentration) was used for the screening of imidazole-activated CooA variants. The purification of WT CooA and the CooA variants (>95% homogeneity) was performed as described previously (17Shelver D. Thorsteinsson M.V. Kerby R.L. Chung S.Y. Roberts G.P. Reynolds M.F. Parks R.B. Burstyn J.N. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 2669-2678Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). The heme content of CooA preparations was estimated using the extinction coefficient of WT CooA (7Shelver D. Kerby R.L., He, Y. Roberts G.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 11216-11220Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar) or by a modified reduced pyridine-hemochromogen method (7Shelver D. Kerby R.L., He, Y. Roberts G.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 11216-11220Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar), and protein concentration was measured using the BCA assay (Pierce). Preparation of hydroxylapatite batch-treated CooA samples was carried out using the procedure described previously (20Youn H. Kerby R.L. Thorsteinsson M.V. Conrad M. Staples C.R. Serate J. Beack J. Roberts G.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 41603-41610Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). By this method, heme-containing CooA was enriched to ∼10% of total protein in case of WT CooA. These preparations were used for the preliminary measurement of UV-visible spectra and in vitro DNA binding activities of some CooA variants. 20 ml of the cells of WT CooA or CooA variants grown in 1× MOPS-buffered media in the presence of CO were harvested by centrifugation. Cell pellets were dissolved in 50 μl of H2O, vortexed, treated with 50 μl of 2 n HCl, vigorously vortexed, and then treated with 1000 μl of a 7:2 acetone/methanol solution. This solution was vigorously vortexed and centrifuged, and the spectra of the supernatant were immediately measured. The peak intensity at 383 nm, normalized for cell mass, was used for determination of the heme-containing CooA accumulation. In vitro DNA binding assays of WT CooA and CooA variants were performed using the fluorescence polarization technique with a Beacon 2000 fluorescence polarization detector (Panvera Corp., Madison, WI) as described previously (10Thorsteinsson M.V. Kerby R.L. Conrad M. Youn H. Staples C.R. Lanzilotta W.N. Poulos T.J. Serate J. Roberts G.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 39332-39338Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). For the measurement of DNA binding of CO-, imidazole- and CN−-bound ΔP3R4 CooA at pH 9.5, the following assay buffer (high pH anisotropy buffer) was used: 40 mmglycine-NaOH, pH 9.5, 6 mm CaCl2, 50 mm KCl, 5% (v/v) glycerol, and 5 mmdithiothreitol. As a fluorescence probe, a 26-bp target DNA containing PcooF was labeled with Texas Red on one end of the duplex and used at the concentration of 6.4 nm. Salmon sperm DNA at 6.4 μm was included in the reaction mixture to eliminate possible nonspecific DNA binding. Dissociation constants (K d) were calculated by fitting of the binding data to an equation that incorporated a fluorescence quenching factor upon DNA-protein interaction as described elsewhere (21Lundblad J.R. Laurance M. Goodman R.H. Mol. Endocrinol. 1996; 10: 607-612Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). UV-visible absorption spectroscopy of CooA samples was performed at room temperature in quartz cuvettes using a Shimadzu UV-2401PC spectrophotometer. UV-visible spectra of CooA samples were routinely obtained using 25 mm MOPS buffer, pH 7.4, with 0.1 m NaCl, unless stated otherwise. The UV-visible spectra of CO-, imidazole-, and CN−-bound ΔP3R4 CooA were obtained with high pH anisotropy buffer for proper comparison with DNA binding activities of these forms. As noted in the Introduction, WT CooA is only activated in response to CO. It has been demonstrated that other potential exogenous ligands cannot create the 6-coordinate CooA adduct; NO is the only small molecule, other than CO, that can form a stable adduct to the heme of CooA (16Reynolds M.F. Parks R.B. Burstyn J.N. Shelver D. Thorsteinsson M.V. Kerby R.L. Roberts G.P. Vogel K.M. Spiro T.G. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 388-396Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar), but NO binding results in a 5-coordinate form that appears to be inactive (16Reynolds M.F. Parks R.B. Burstyn J.N. Shelver D. Thorsteinsson M.V. Kerby R.L. Roberts G.P. Vogel K.M. Spiro T.G. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 388-396Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). This has led to the hypothesis that CO specificity results from its unique ability to create a 6-coordinate heme in CooA. To test if any exogenous ligand resulting in a 6-coordinate CooA adduct leads to CooA activation, we investigated a CooA variant that allows creation of 6-coordinate CooA adducts with exogenous ligands other than CO. The simultaneous deletion of Pro3 and Arg4(termed ΔP3R4 CooA) perturbs the Pro2 ligand in Fe(III) CooA, presumably by limiting the ability of Pro2 to reach the heme (20Youn H. Kerby R.L. Thorsteinsson M.V. Conrad M. Staples C.R. Serate J. Beack J. Roberts G.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 41603-41610Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). The following results show that ΔP3R4 CooA is perturbed in the Fe(II) form as well and that imidazole and CN− can bind to this form. In the 6-coordinate adducts produced, the small molecules have presumably displaced the perturbed Pro2 ligand, although this has not been demonstrated. Fig. 2 A shows the UV-visible spectra of various forms of ΔP3R4 CooA in high pH anisotropy buffer. A comparison of the spectra of Fe(III) and Fe(II) ΔP3R4 CooA (Fig. 2 A) with those of WT CooA (data not shown) measured in the presence of 0.2 m KCl suggested the existence of a population of proteins in both forms of the ΔP3R4 CooA with an open heme coordination site. The addition of imidazole (final 0.2m) to Fe(II) ΔP3R4 CooA resulted in increase of signal intensity with concomitant red shifts of Soret, α, and β bands to 426, 560, and 530 nm (Fig. 2 A), respectively, indicating that imidazole-bound 6-coordinate CooA heme was formed. Similarly, the addition of KCN (final 0.2 m) into Fe(II) ΔP3R4 CooA resulted in shifts of Soret, α, and β bands to 435, 567.5, and 538.5 nm (Fig. 2 A), characteristic of a 6-coordinate low spin CN− adduct of the heme. This imidazole- and CN−-binding property is also observed in other CooA variants with perturbed Pro2 ligation. These include ΔP3-I7 CooA (data not shown), which lacks five residues from Pro3 to Ile7, and G117I CooA, where Ile117 sterically perturbs Pro2 ligation (20Youn H. Kerby R.L. Thorsteinsson M.V. Conrad M. Staples C.R. Serate J. Beack J. Roberts G.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 41603-41610Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). In each case, it appears that the Pro2 perturbation creates a population with an open heme coordination, to which these exogenous ligands bind. We assume that imidazole and CN−first bind on the Pro2 side to the low level of 5-coordinate species in Fe(II) form and shift the equilibrium to the 6-coordinate adduct with the small molecule adduct. This open heme coordination position would almost certainly be the Pro2side, because Pro2 is the endogenous ligand that is perturbed in these CooA variants. This implies that those exogenous ligands are binding to the same side of the heme as does CO to WT CooA. This situation allowed us to test the ability of “properly bound” exogenous ligands other than CO to activate CooA. We then tested whether Fe(II)-imidazole or Fe(II)-CN− ΔP3R4 CooA showed DNA binding activity under the same conditions as were used to measure the spectra. As shown in Fig. 2 B, Fe(II) ΔP3R4 CooA responds to CO with a significant increase in signal by fluorescence anisotropy but shows no response to imidazole or CN−. When CO was then added to head space of Fe(II)-imidazole or Fe(II)-CN− ΔP3R4 CooA, DNA binding activity was restored in each case. The appearance of partial activity in the sample with both CN− and CO (Fig. 2 B) reflects the ability of high levels of CN−to compete for heme binding with the modest levels of CO used, as revealed by UV-visible spectrum (data not shown). Surprisingly, CO addition to Fe(II)-imidazole ΔP3R4 CooA actually resulted in DNA binding activity that is reproducibly higher than that of the Fe(II)-CO form. Under this condition, CO completely displaced imidazole from the heme, as revealed by UV-visible spectrum (data not shown), so that the stimulation by imidazole was not due to its being a ligand. The exact mechanism of this interesting secondary effect of imidazole is under further investigation. In the absence of added effectors, Fe(III) and Fe(II) ΔP3R4 CooA failed to show any DNA binding activity at this CooA concentration (Fig. 2 B). These results indicate that imidazole or CN− binding to Fe(II) ΔP3R4 CooA cannot trigger the conformational change that leads to DNA binding, and therefore that CO provides a level of specificity for the CooA activation process in addition to its ability to form a 6-coordinate CooA adduct. If the nature of the small molecule ligand is sensed, then the surfaces of the C-helices in the vicinity of the heme are the obvious candidates for this sensing function for the following reasons. (i) The C-helices of CooA are the closest residues to the heme iron other than Pro2, at least in the known Fe(II) structure (8Lanzilotta W.N. Schuller D.J. Thorsteinsson M.V. Kerby R.L. Roberts G.P. Poulos T.J. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 7: 876-880Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). (ii) Resonance Raman analysis indicated that Ile113, Leu116, and Gly117 are the residues close to the bound CO. 2C. M. Coyle, unpublished data. (iii) As discussed in the Introduction, there are several lines of evidence that C-helix repositioning occurs upon CO binding and that this is a critical aspect of CooA activation. It was therefore an attractive hypothesis that this repositioning results from a direct interaction with the CO-bound heme, and we examined the residues in this region of the C-helices for their roles in CO-specific activation of CooA. Because all C-helix residues near the distal side of the heme are hydrophobic (Fig. 1 C), it was our working hypothesis that specificity in activation by CO would be the result of steric interaction between the bound CO and these residues (8Lanzilotta W.N. Schuller D.J. Thorsteinsson M.V. Kerby R.L. Roberts G.P. Poulos T.J. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 7: 876-880Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). Based on the known structure of Fe(II) CooA, Ile113and Leu116 are within 8 Å of the heme iron on Pro2 side (8Lanzilotta W.N. Schuller D.J. Thorsteinsson M.V. Kerby R.L. Roberts G.P. Poulos T.J. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 7: 876-880Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar), and we have already shown a functional importance for Gly117, although the basis for this remains unknown (20Youn H. Kerby R.L. Thorsteinsson M.V. Conrad M. Staples C.R. Serate J. Beack J. Roberts G.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 41603-41610Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). We therefore created CooA variants with substitutions of small (Ala) and large (Phe) residues at positions 113 and 116. TableI shows in vivo activities of these CooA variants with a CooA-dependent β-galactosidase reporter system, showing that these variants were somewhat altered in their CO responsiveness of CooA. It should be noted that there is excess amount of CooA in the cells under the conditions of these assays, so that activities below 80% actually represent a meaningful loss of CooA functionality. The basis for the low but significant CO-independent activity of I113F CooA is unknown.Table IProperties of CooA variants altered at positions 113 and/or 116CooA% β-Galactosidase activity1-a% activity indicates the mean value of multiple measurements of activity relative to that of WT CooA in the presence of CO and showed variability <10%.Red1-bCells grown anaerobically were used for the activity.Red + CORatio1-cThe ratio will be informative only when considered with “Red + CO” activity since small changes of “Red” activity (denominator) potentially result in large differences in this ratio.

Open table in a new tab To change more dramatically the distal heme pocket volume, we created two CooA variants with double substitutions, I113A/L116A and I113F/L116F CooA variants. Although I113A/L116A CooA was severely perturbed in its CO-sensing function, I113F/L116F CooA was relatively normal (Table I). The synergistic effect of the combination of the I113A and L116A substitutions led to the hypothesis that these two residues might form a functional pair in some way, such that modification of a single residue might have only a modest effect. In order to understand the functional requirements of that pair, we simultaneously randomized the codons for both residues 113 and 116 and screened for those CooA variants with significant activity in the presence of CO, as well as seeking less functional variants for comparison. Such a randomization and screening procedure allows a clearer understanding of the requirements at both positions for CO responsiveness, because a large number of possibilities are tested. Approximately 6,000 colonies, with cooA randomized at these two codons, were screened in the presence of CO. CooA variants with high activity (blue colonies; ∼10%), intermediate activity (pale blue, ∼30%), and negligible activity (white colonies; ∼60%) colonies were seen. Selected variants were then examined more quantitatively for β-galactosidase activity in the presence and absence of CO and their cooA genes sequenced (TableII). The first conclusion is that, although a variety of residues can support normal CooA function at positions 113 and 116, neither charged nor hydrophilic residues are acceptable for good activity in the presence of CO. Such residues are absent among the normally active variants, yet are common among those variants with little or no activity (Table II). The requirements for a functional CooA appear to be rather more restrictive at position 116 than at position 113, as a narrower range of residues is found at that position among normally active variants. This suggests that residue 116 has a more important role than does residue 113 for the in vivo CO response of CooA.Table IIProperties of CooA variants altered in the vicinity of heme through double-randomized mutagenesis at positions 113 and 116CooASequence% β-galactosidase activity2-a% activity indicates the mean value of double measurements of activity relative to that of WT CooA in the presence of CO and showed variability <10%.113116Red2-bCells grown anaerobically were used for the activity.Red + CORatio2-cThe ratio will be informative only when considered with Red + CO activity since small changes of Red activity (denominator) potentially result in large differences in this ratio.

https://openalex.org/W2075323847,"Glycosylasparaginase (GA) is an amidase and belongs to a novel family of N-terminal nucleophile hydrolases that use a similar autoproteolytic processing mechanism to generate a mature/active enzyme from a single chain protein precursor. From bacteria to eukaryotes, GAs are conserved in primary sequences, tertiary structures, and activation of amidase activity by intramolecular autoproteolysis. An evolutionarily conserved His-Asp-Thr sequence is cleaved to generate a newly exposed N-terminal threonine, which plays a central role in both autoproteolysis and in its amidase activity. We have recently determined the crystal structure of the bacterial GA precursor at 1.9-Å resolution, which reveals a highly distorted and energetically unfavorable conformation at the scissile peptide bond. A mechanism of autoproteolysis via an N-O acyl shift was proposed to relieve these conformational strains. However, it is not understood how the polypeptide chain distortion was generated and preserved during the folding of GA to trigger autoproteolysis. An obstacle to our understanding of GA autoproteolysis is the uncertainty concerning its quaternary structure in solution. Here we have revisited this question and show that GA forms dimers in solution. Mutants with alterations at the dimer interface cannot form dimers and are impaired in the autoproteolytic activation. This suggests that dimerization of GA plays an essential role in autoproteolysis to activate the amidase activity. Comparison of the melting temperatures of GA dimers before and after autoproteolysis suggests two states of dimerization in the process of enzyme maturation. A two-step dimerization mechanism to trigger autoproteolysis is proposed to accommodate the data presented here as well as those in the literature.

FASEB J. 1989; 3: 2615-2622Google Scholar). A deficiency in the human GA leads to severe clinical symptoms, known as aspartylglycosaminuria (2Mononen I. Fisher K.J. Kaartinen V. Aronson N.N., Jr. FASEB J. 1993; 7: 1247-1256Google Scholar). GA is widely distributed in vertebrate tissues (3Tollersrud O.K. Aronson N.N., Jr. Biochem. J. 1992; 282: 891-897Google Scholar), insect cells (4Liu Y. Dunn G.S. Aronson N.N., Jr. Glycobiology. 1996; 6: 527-536Google Scholar), and in bacteria (5Tarentino A.L. Plummer T.H., Jr. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1993; 197: 179-186Google Scholar). GA joins the proteasome and penicillin acylase as a novel class of enzymes, called N-terminal nucleophile (Ntn) hydrolases that catalytically use a processed N-terminal threonine, serine, or cysteine as both a polarizing base and a nucleophile (6Brannigan J.A. Dodson G. Duggleby H.J. Moody P.C.E. Smith J.L. Tomchick D.R. Murzin A.G. Nature. 1995; 378: 416-419Google Scholar). The crystal structures of human and bacterial GA show a similar structural frame of an αββα-sandwich, common to all the Ntn hydrolases (7Oinonen C. Tikkanen R. Rouvinen J. Peltonen L. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1995; 2: 1102-1108Google Scholar, 8Guo H.-C., Xu, Q. Buckley D. Guan C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 20205-20212Google Scholar, 9Xuan J. Tarentino A.L. Grimwood B.G. Plummer T.H., Jr. Cui T. Guan C. Van Roey P. Protein Sci. 1998; 7: 774-781Google Scholar, 10Oinonen C. Rouvinen J. Protein Sci. 2000; 9: 2329-2337Google Scholar). One intriguing aspect of GA is that a single chain precursor is processed by intramolecular autoproteolysis that generates the 17-kDa α- and 15-kDa β-subunits and exposes the active site threonine at the newly generated N-terminal end of the β-subunit (11Guan C. Cui T. Rao V. Liao W. Benner J. Lin C.L. Comb D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 1732-1737Google Scholar, 12Tikkanen R. Riikonen A. Oinonen C. Rouvinen R. Peltonen L. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 2954-2960Google Scholar). A similar mechanism is utilized in protein splicing that involves two concerted autocleavages and one ligation of the polypeptide chain (13Paulus H. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2000; 69: 447-496Google Scholar, 14Perler F.B. Adam E. Curr. Opin. Biotechnol. 2000; 11: 377-383Google Scholar). Crystal structures of GA precursor have provided us a structural basis to propose a detailed mechanism of intramolecular autoproteolysis (15Xu Q. Buckley D. Guan C. Guo H.-C. Cell. 1999; 98: 651-661Google Scholar). The GA precursor undergoes a two-step mechanism to break up the polypeptide chain, through an N-O acyl shift and an ester intermediate. In the first step, the nucleophile Thr-152 is activated by a base Asp-151 that is held in an unusual but precise geometry by Thr-203 to deprotonate the nucleophile Thr-152. After the nucleophilic attack, a transitional tetrahedral anion intermediate is stabilized by a polar group of Thr-170 that could further be polarized to carry positive charge by Arg-180, possibly through a bound solvent molecule. Collapse of the tetrahedral anion intermediate shifts the linkage from an amide bond to an ester bond (N-O acyl shift). Usually the equilibrium of N-O acyl shift favors the amide bond, resulting in a peptide bond that does not break often at threonine, serine, or cysteine. However, the strained, tight turn conformation at the scissile peptide bond observed in the GA precursor structures could drive the equilibrium toward an ester bond formation (15Xu Q. Buckley D. Guan C. Guo H.-C. Cell. 1999; 98: 651-661Google Scholar). The second step of autoproteolysis is a simple hydrolysis of the ester intermediate by a neighboring water molecule, resulting in an active amidase with α- and β-subunits. Recently, both scissile peptide bonds involved in protein splicing of PI-SceI have also been found to be in distortedtrans conformations (16Poland B.W., Xu, M.Q. Quiocho F.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 16408-16413Google Scholar). Similar to GA autoproteolysis, relieving the distorted/strained main chain atoms is also believed to help drive an N-S acyl shift in PI-SceI precursor. It is not understood how the polypeptide chain distortion to trigger autoproteolysis is generated and why these local constraints are not removed during the folding of the GA precursor. It seems plausible that the structural constraints are generated only at a late stage of protein folding, for example, during the formation of the native quaternary structure. Dimerization of GA precursors has been suggested to be a prerequisite to trigger autoproteolysis (8Guo H.-C., Xu, Q. Buckley D. Guan C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 20205-20212Google Scholar, 17Riikonen A. Rouvinen J. Tikkanen R. Julkunen I. Peltonen L. Jalanko A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 21340-21344Google Scholar, 18Saarela J. Laine M. Tikkanen R. Oinonen C. Jalanko A. Rouvinen J. Peltonen L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 25320-25328Google Scholar). However, the native quaternary structure of GA was controversial. Among several crystal forms, the same dimer structure is observed for the human and bacterial GA, either as precursors or autoproteolyzed enzymes (7Oinonen C. Tikkanen R. Rouvinen J. Peltonen L. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1995; 2: 1102-1108Google Scholar, 8Guo H.-C., Xu, Q. Buckley D. Guan C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 20205-20212Google Scholar, 9Xuan J. Tarentino A.L. Grimwood B.G.

However, in solution, GA was reported as monomeric for mammalian and bacterial enzymes (3Tollersrud O.K. Aronson N.N., Jr. Biochem. J. 1992; 282: 891-897Google Scholar, 9Xuan J. Tarentino A.L.

Rouvinen J. Tikkanen R. Julkunen I. Peltonen L. Jalanko A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 21340-21344Google Scholar, 20Kaartinen V. Williams J.C. Tomich J. Yates III, J.R. Hood L.E. Mononen I. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 5860-5869Google Scholar), chicken (3Tollersrud O.K. Aronson N.N., Jr. Biochem. J. 1992; 282: 891-897Google Scholar), and insect enzymes (4Liu Y. Dunn G.S. Aronson N.N., Jr. Glycobiology. 1996; 6: 527-536Google Scholar). This study was designed to re-examine the native quaternary structure of GA in solution and to study the significance of the quaternary structure in the intramolecular autoproteolysis that is essential to activate the amidase activity for glycoprotein degradation. By using biochemical and biophysical methods, we confirm that GA exists as dimers in solution. Structure-based mutants designed to disrupt the dimer interface lose their ability to form dimers and also lose their ability for autoproteolytic activation of amidase activity. Proteins were expressed and purified by existing procedures (21Cui T. Liao P.-H. Guan C. Guo H.-C. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1999; 55: 1961-1964Google Scholar), with some modifications. The expression of maltose-binding protein (MBP)-GA fusion proteins was induced in the TB1 cells by adding 1 mmisopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside overnight at 30 °C. Cells were pelleted by centrifugation, resuspended in 20 mm Tris buffer, pH 7.6, 50 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, and lysed by sonication. Fusion proteins were affinity-purified from the crude extracts over an amylose column according to the protocol of the manufacturer (New England Biolabs). All purification procedures were carried out at 4 °C. To obtain GA proteins, the purified fusion proteins were further digested with factor Xa at room temperature overnight, and GA was then separated from MBP and factor Xa with a HiTrap Q-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences) column. Similar protocols were used to purify autoproteolysis-inactive mutant precursors (T152A). For the precursor proteins of autoproteolysis-active mutant precursors (T152C mutant), 10 mm glycine was included during the entire course of protein expression and purification to inhibit autoproteolysis. Protein concentration was determined by absorbance measurements at 280 nm in 6m guanidine hydrochloride (22Edelhoch H. Biochemistry. 1967; 6: 1948-1954Google Scholar). A 200-μl volume, 20 μm each of the GA or MBP fusion proteins, was applied to an AmershamBiosciences HiPrep 16/60 Sephacryl S-200 HR gel filtration column, equilibrated in a solution containing 10 mmpotassium-phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, and 1 mm EDTA. According to the manufacturer, this column effectively separates globular proteins in the molecular mass range of 5–250 kDa. The gel filtration standards, a mixture of five molecular weight markers, were purchased from Bio-Rad: bovine thyroglobulin (670 kDa), bovine γ-globulin (158 kDa), chicken ovalbumin (44 kDa), equine myoglobin (17 kDa), and vitamin B-12 (1,350 Da). Thus, bovine thyroglobulin was eluted at the point representing the void volume of the column. Cross-linking was performed at 0.1–0.2 mg/ml (1.3–6.2 μm) protein and 0.0005–1% glutaraldehyde in 10 mm potassium-phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, and incubation for 6 h at room temperature. Reactions were quenched with 0.15 volumes of 0.5 m glycine. Cross-linked protein samples were denatured in 1% SDS, 1% β-mercaptoethanol at 90 °C for 10 min, and then analyzed by SDS-PAGE. The gels were stained with Coomassie Blue. Similar experiments were also performed using 1–4 mg/ml dimethyl suberimidate (DMS) as a cross-linking reagent. Sedimentation was performed using a modified version of the method described by Martin and Ames (23Martin R.G. Ames B.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1961; 236: 1372-1379Google Scholar). Linear gradients of 10–30% sucrose in 10 mm potassium-phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, were equilibrated at 4 °C for 2–4 h prior to use. Protein was diluted in the same buffer to 30 μm, preincubated for 30 min at 4 °C, and then layered on the gradients using a 20-gauge needle. Gradients were centrifuged 40,000 rpm for 12 h in a Beckman SW55 Ti rotor. Gradients were withdrawn from the top into a series of 100-μl fractions. Protein peaks in the gradient were determined by Bradford assays of each fraction with reading of absorbance at 595 nm. DNA manipulation and site-directed mutagenesis (Kunkel methods) were carried out as described previously (11Guan C. Cui T. Rao V. Liao W. Benner J. Lin C.L. Comb D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 1732-1737Google Scholar). Wild-type Flavobacteriumglycosylasparaginase coding sequence was cloned into either the pMAL system or the Litmus system for site-directed mutagenesis, following the manufacturer's protocols (New England Biolabs). DNA clones with desired mutations were confirmed by sequence analyses using an ABI automatic DNA sequencer. CD spectra were recorded from 185 to 250 nm using an AVIV 62DS spectrometer equipped with a thermoelectric sample temperature controller, with a 1-mm path length cuvette. Protein concentrations were 2–5 μm in 10 mm potassium-phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, and 1 mmEDTA and were determined by absorbance measurements in 6 mguanidine hydrochloride (22Edelhoch H. Biochemistry. 1967; 6: 1948-1954Google Scholar). The spectra were collected at 25 °C as the average of 10 scans, using a 15-s integration time at 1.0 nm wavelength increments. Following the buffer base-line correction, the spectra were normalized to the protein concentration and are expressed as molar ellipticity. Thermal unfolding curves were recorded at 222 nm upon heating from 5 to 95 °C at a rate of 60 °C/h, with a 1 °C increment, 30-s accumulation time. The melting temperature (T m) was determined from the differential melting curves d[Θ220]/dT (24John D.M. Weeks K.M. Protein Sci. 2000; 9: 1416-1419Google Scholar). ORIGIN software (Microcal, Inc.) was used for the CD analyses and display. Previous reports concerning the native GA quaternary structure drew conclusions mainly based on the apparent molecular masses on sizing chromatography or native gel electrophoresis, often using samples from cell extracts and visualizing a trace amount of GA by Western blot methods. Contradicting observations were reported from different groups; some concluded GA monomers (3Tollersrud O.K. Aronson N.N., Jr. Biochem. J. 1992; 282: 891-897Google Scholar, 9Xuan J. Tarentino A.L.

J. 1994; 300: 541-544Google Scholar), whereas others reported dimers for GA precursor or autoproteolyzed GA (3Tollersrud O.K. Aronson N.N., Jr. Biochem. J. 1992; 282: 891-897Google Scholar, 4Liu Y. Dunn G.S. Aronson N.N., Jr. Glycobiology. 1996; 6: 527-536Google Scholar, 17Riikonen A. Rouvinen J. Tikkanen R. Julkunen I. Peltonen L. Jalanko A. J. Biol.

These contradictory observations have prompted us to re-investigate the quaternary structure of GA more closely using purified precursors and the autoproteolyzed enzyme ofFlavobacterium GA. Wild-type GA spontaneously autoproteolyzes in cells into the mature form amidase with two (α and β) subunits, and thus it is impossible to isolate the precursor of wild-type GA. To study the quaternary structure of purified GA precursor, we thus have to resort to GA mutants. T152A precursor has the same three-dimensional structure as other precursor proteins that are active in autoproteolysis (15Xu Q. Buckley D. Guan C. Guo H.-C. Cell. 1999; 98: 651-661Google Scholar). Due to the loss of its critical nucleophile for autoproteolysis, we are able to purify a large quantity of precursor protein of the T152A mutant. Autoproteolysis of a second mutant, T152C, can be switched on and off by a reversible inhibitor, glycine (15Xu Q. Buckley D. Guan C. Guo H.-C. Cell. 1999; 98: 651-661Google Scholar). With the exception of a slower reaction rate, T152C resembles the wild-type GA in autoproteolysis activity (11Guan C. Cui T. Rao V. Liao W. Benner J. Lin C.L. Comb D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 1732-1737Google Scholar, 25Guan C. Liu Y. Shao Y. Cui T. Liao W. Ewel A. Whitaker R. Paulus H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 9695-9702Google Scholar), and the autoproteolyzed T152C enzyme (T152Cm) has an identical crystal structure to that of the wild-type mature enzyme (8Guo H.-C., Xu, Q. Buckley D. Guan C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 20205-20212Google Scholar). Throughout this study, the T152A precursor was used to represent a native precursor structure, whereas the wild-type and/or mature T152Cm proteins were used to represent a native structure of mature GA amidase after autoproteolysis. The purified GA proteins were first examined by chromatography on a gel filtration column. Because the native autoproteolyzed amidase still has the two newly generated (α and β) subunits in tight association (26Riikonen A. Tikkanen R. Jalanko A. Peltonen L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 4903-4907Google Scholar, 27Tarentino A.L. Quinones G. Hauer C.R. Changchien L.M. Plummer T.H., Jr. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1995; 316: 399-406Google Scholar), a single chain GA precursor and a native autoproteolyzed amidase should have similar calculated molecular masses of 32 kDa. As shown in Fig. 1 A, autoproteolyzed amidase of wild-type GA or T152Cm protein was eluted as a single peak with an apparent molecular mass of 43 kDa, when compared with a mixture of gel filtration size standards (Bio-Rad). Thus, the apparent molecular mass of mature GA was about 40% larger than a GA monomer of 32 kDa. Similarly, purified precursor T152A protein was eluted as a single peak with an apparent molecular mass of about 1.4-fold of a monomer. The precursor was eluted at a slightly larger volume than the mature enzyme. This is consistent with an uncleaved loop in the precursor that becomes cleaved and thus more floppy and bulky in the mature enzyme. Interestingly, a 43-kDa recombinant maltose-binding protein (MBP2 from New England Biolabs) was eluted with a substantially smaller apparent molecular mass (about 25 kDa) when compared with the same size standards (Fig. 1 B). All these observations demonstrated the limitations of using gel filtration chromatography to estimate molecular masses of macromolecules, because the mobility of proteins in gel filtration columns was affected not only by molecular weight and size but also by molecular shape. There are various ways to interpret the single peaks of GA on chromatograms with elution volumes at the middle between those expected for monomers and dimers. These single peaks could represent GA monomers with a smaller retention volume when compared with the size standards, which may be due to an extensive hydrophobic surface observed in the crystal structures. These single peaks could also be interpreted as GA dimers with a larger retention volume than expected, which may be due to the compact shape of the dimer observed in the crystal structures (8Guo H.-C., Xu, Q. Buckley D. Guan C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 20205-20212Google Scholar). A third explanation for the unusual mobility is that GA dimers are in fast equilibrium with monomers during the run through the gel filtration column. This uncertainty appears to be the source of confusion that results in contradictory reports in the literature. In an attempt to demonstrate the sensitivity of gel filtration chromatography to the shape of proteins, we re-examined the behavior of GA fusion proteins on the gel filtration column. We reasoned that attaching an MBP to the N-terminal end of GA protein would change the shape of a monomer from a quite compact GA structure to an irregular shape of a fusion protein. Therefore, if existing as a single species in solution, these fusion proteins might behave differently from GA protein alone and thus provide better resolution to distinguish monomers from dimers. Otherwise, if GA dimers are in equilibrium with monomers, the fusion proteins would still be eluted as single peaks with apparent molecular masses of about 1.4-fold of a monomer. Fig. 1 B shows the gel filtration chromatograms for purified MBP-GA fusion proteins, before and after the GA domain was autoproteolyzed. As a control, MBP protein alone was eluted as a single peak with an apparent molecular mass of 25 kDa, which is smaller than that calculated for a monomer of 43 kDa. Nonetheless, it indicates that MBP does not dimerize in solution. For a monomeric MBP-GA fusion protein, either as a precursor or an autoproteolyzed amidase, the calculated molecular mass is 75 kDa. The MBP-T152A (GA precursor) fusion protein was eluted as a single peak, with an apparent molecular mass of 138 kDa. Likewise, MBP fusion with T152C mature GA (MBP-T152Cm) was eluted with an apparent molecular mass of 138 kDa that is 1.8-fold of the calculated molecular mass for a monomer. This shift of molecular mass from 1.4- to 1.8-fold of a monomer indicates that the unusual mobility of GA is not a result of fast equilibrium. Thus, considering that MBP alone was eluted at 0.6-fold of its calculated molecular weight, the MBP-GA fusion proteins eluted at 1.8-fold of the calculated molecular masses are more likely to be dimers than monomers. These results also suggest that the dimerization of fusion proteins is mediated by the GA domain and not the MBP domain. To confirm GA dimers in solution, we performed cross-linking with glutaraldehyde and DMS. Cross-linking of T152A precursor with 0.001–1% glutaraldehyde (amine-amine cross-linking) at room temperature and 0.1 mg/ml (3.1 μm) protein indicated that the GA precursor was dimeric under these conditions (Fig. 2). Following SDS-PAGE, the T152A precursor yielded a characteristic pattern of two bands corresponding to cross-linked monomer and dimer (Fig. 2 A), whereas an uncross-linked control (i.e. without glutaraldehyde treatment) gave a single band corresponding to a monomer. Similar cross-linking results were obtained with autoproteolyzed enzyme of wild-type GA (Fig. 2 B), although the pattern is more complicated because there are two subunits, α and β, in each native mature/autoproteolyzed enzyme. Without cross-linking treatment, the wild-type mature enzyme gave two bands for the α- and β-subunits. A low dose of cross-linking reagent (0.001–0.01%) gave a new cluster of bands of 30–34 kDa corresponding to two cross-linked subunits either from the same GA molecule (α-β and α′-β′ of 32 kDa) or through the dimer interface (α-α′, α-β′, α′-β, and β-β′ ranging from 30 to 34 kDa). At higher concentrations of cross-linking treatment (0.1–1%), an additional cluster of bands was present corresponding to completely cross-linked dimer of autoproteolyzed enzyme (∼64 kDa of α-β-α′-β′). No band corresponding to three cross-linked subunits (e.g. α-β-α′, etc.) appeared. This might be due to a preferential cross-linking of contacts either through dimer interface or within a monomer. Thus, by the time two subunits were cross-linked through the minor cross-linking surface, they were also cross-linked through the major cross-linking surface, resulting in the 64-kDa species. The cross-linking pattern of mature T152Cm protein (Fig. 2 C) is the same as the wild-type enzyme and confirms a dimeric structure of mature enzyme. Similar results were also obtained using DMS as the cross-linking reagent (data not shown). All together, results here confirm that both GA precursor and mature enzyme form dimers in solution. To examine the significance of dimerization in autoproteolysis, we designed and generated mutants that would disrupt dimer interactions without affecting protein folding. With the aid of the crystal structures of the GA precursor protein (15Xu Q. Buckley D. Guan C. Guo H.-C. Cell. 1999; 98: 651-661Google Scholar) and autoproteolyzed amidase (8Guo H.-C., Xu, Q. Buckley D. Guan C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 20205-20212Google Scholar), we identified several targets at the dimerization interface for mutagenesis, hoping to weaken or disrupt the dimer formation (Fig. 3 A). In the dimers, Val-105 is sequestered out of the solvent to form hydrophobic contacts with its equivalent from the other monomer. Similarly, Ile-186 from each monomer interacts with each other at the dimer interface. In addition, conserved residue Glu-220 forms charge interactions with conserved residue Arg-238 of the adjacent monomer. All of these residues point away from the structural core of the monomer and thus are unlikely to disturb protein packing of each monomer. Furthermore, because these four residues are located on the opposite side of the scissile peptide bond (Fig. 3 A), they are not likely to be involved directly in the autoproteolysis. Therefore, replacement of each of these residues was hypothesized to destabilize dimer formation but not to affect the folding of the monomer or to change active site residues. Four dimer interface mutants were generated to study the effect of mutation at the dimer interface, V105K, I186D, E220K, and R238D. These mutant proteins were also expressed as MBP fusion proteins by similar protocol published previously (11Guan C. Cui T. Rao V. Liao W. Benner J. Lin C.L. Comb D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 1732-1737Google Scholar) for the wild-type and other GA mutants. Purification of GA interface mutants alone proved to be difficult because they were unstable and very sensitive to protease degradation during the process of protein purification, particularly after factor Xa digestion to separate GA mutants from the MBP domain. However, when purified as MBP fusion proteins, these mutants were more stable and thus allowed us to obtain sufficient amounts of proteins for further characterization. Nonetheless, there are still a few minor degradation bands that were eluted together with the MBP-GA full-length protein from a maltose-affinity column (Fig. 3 B, lanes 11–18). This indicates these minor degradation products may still retain an intact MBP domain but with a degraded GA mutant domain. This is in contrast to the wild-type GA or other active site mutants that are very stable by the same expression and purification procedure. As shown in Fig. 3 B, wild-type GA spontaneously autoproteolyzes into α- and β-subunits during protein purification (lane 2). The T152C mutant also partially autoproteolyzes (lane 3) during the protein purification, resulting in the same α- and β-subunits as the wild-type GA. Furthermore, it has been shown that autoproteolysis of T152C mutant can be accelerated by incubation with hydroxylamine (lane 4; see Ref. 11Guan C. Cui T. Rao V. Liao W. Benner J. Lin C.L. Comb D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 1732-1737Google Scholar), indicating a thioester intermediate involved in the autoproteolysis of the T152C mutant. Conversely, T152A mutant loses its critical nucleophile for autoproteolysis (lane 5), and hydroxylamine does not have any effect on autoproteolysis of the T152A mutant (lane 6). GA retains the same autoproteolytic activity when purified as MBP fusion proteins. MBP-T152C fusion protein partially autoproteolyzes into MBP-α and -β subunits (Fig. 3 B, lane 7), and hydroxylamine can also stimulate its autoproteolytic activity (lane 8). MBP-T152A fusion does not autoproteolyze either without or with hydroxylamine (lanes 9 and 10). Thus, expression of GA as MBP fusion proteins does not alter their autoproteolytic activity but can stabilize the dimer interface mutants that are extremely sensitive to protease degradation if isolated as individual GA mutants. We therefore characterized all the dimer interface mutants as MBP fusion proteins and compared them to the controls of MBP-T152A precursor and autoproteolyzed MBP-T152C (MBP-T152Cm) as precursor and mature enzyme, respectively."
https://openalex.org/W2088329401,"Cyclooxygenases (COX) are rate-limiting enzymes that catalyze the conversion of arachidonic acid to prostaglandins, which are involved in many physiological and pathophysiological responses. COX-2, one of two isoforms of COX, was recently found to play an important role in carcinogenesis in many cell and tissue types. COX-2 inhibitors, which belong to the family of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, are believed to be effective in many biological activities such as tumor chemoprevention because of their inhibition of COX-2. However, in the present study we found that both piroxicam, a general COX inhibitor, and NS-398, a COX-2 selective inhibitor, effectively suppressed the activation of transcription factor activator protein 1 (AP-1) induced by ultraviolet B (UVB) or 12-<i>O</i>-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate in mouse epidermal JB6 cells. These COX-2 inhibitors could also inhibit 12-<i>O</i>-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate-induced cell transformation. UVB significantly increased AP-1 activity in<i>Cox</i>-2<sup>−/−</sup> fibroblasts transfected with an AP-1 luciferase reporter gene, and this increase was blocked by NS-389 or piroxicam.

https://openalex.org/W1985839427,"Mitochondrial processing peptidase (MPP) recognizes a large variety of basic presequences of mitochondrial preproteins and cleaves the single site, often including arginine, at the −2 position (P<sub>2</sub>). To elucidate the recognition and specific processing of the preproteins by MPP, we mutated to alanines at acidic residues conserved in a large internal cavity formed by the MPP subunits, α-MPP and β-MPP, and analyzed the processing efficiencies for various preproteins. We report here that alanine mutations at a subsite in rat β-MPP interacting with the P<sub>2</sub> arginine cause a shift in the processing site to the C-terminal side of the preprotein. Because of reduced interactions with the P<sub>2</sub> arginine, the mutated enzymes recognize not only the N-terminal authentic cleavage site with P<sub>2</sub> arginine but also the potential C-terminal cleavage site without a P<sub>2</sub>arginine. In fact, it competitively cleaves the two sites of the preprotein. Moreover, the acidified site of α-MPP, which binds to the distal basic site in the long presequence, recognized the authentic P<sub>2</sub> arginine as the distal site in compensation for ionic interaction at the proximal site in the mutant MPP. Thus, MPP seems to scan the presequence from β- to α-MPP on the substrate binding scaffold inside the MPP cavity and finds the distal and P<sub>2</sub>arginines on the multiple subsites on both MPP subunits. A possible mechanism for substrate recognition and cleavage is discussed here based on the notable character of a subsite-deficient mutant of MPP in which the substrate specificity is altered."

It is a modular protein consisting of discrete functional domains, which can be expressed and studied in isolation. In particular, residues 325–355 of human p53 (p53tet) spontaneously form a tetramer in solution (see Fig. 1 a) (5Chene P.

Each monomer within the context of the p53tet domain adopts an identical structure,viz. a short N-terminal β-strand (residues 326–333) followed by a turn and a C-terminal α-helical domain (residues 335–354). Two monomers associate in an antiparallel fashion through contacts between β-sheet strands as well as hydrophobic interactions involving α-helical residues to form a “primary dimer” (6Jeffrey P.D.

Of these residues, the only pairs of complementary charged side chains proximal enough to form an intermonomer salt bridge involve Lys351 with Glu343 and/or Glu346 (see Fig. 1 b).

Taken together, these findings suggest that the presence of salt bridges involving Lys351 with Glu343 and/or Glu346would contribute four or more ionic interactions within the context of the p53 tetramer interface, favoring the stabilization and self-association of primary dimers. To test this hypothesis, we engineered variants of the p53tet domain harboring charge-reversal mutations at positions 343, 346, and 351 (see Fig. 1 c). Mutants p53tet-E343K, p53tet-E346K, and p53tet-E343K/E346K will result in dimer-dimer interfaces exhibiting a preponderance of positively charged side chains, whereas mutant p53tet-K351E will produce an interface enriched for negatively charged residues, both scenarios leading to electrostatic interactions unfavorable for tetramer formation. Conversely, the negative effects of introducing like charges at the dimer-dimer interface should be nullified in the case of heterotetramers composed of dimers of p53tet-K351E paired with p53tet-E343K, p53tet-E346K, or p53tet-E343K/E346K. The stability and oligomeric state of these p53tet constructs were analyzed in a series of biophysical experiments to resolve the role of such salt bridges at the dimer-dimer interface.DISCUSSIONThe tetramerization domain of human p53 is an important part of this key tumor suppressor protein. Analysis of the dimer-dimer interface of the human p53 tetramerization domain suggests that ion pair interactions between Glu343, Glu346, and Lys351 may contribute significantly to the stability of the tetramer. This hypothesis was further supported by the fact that the tetramerization domain sequences of p53 in other organisms as well as of human p63 and p73 (Fig. 1 c) display the naturally occurring E343K mutation. This mutation is always coupled with a corresponding loss of the positively charged lysine residue at position 351. This hypothesis was tested by designing and analyzing variants of the tetramerization domain of human p53, viz. p53tet-E343K, p53tet-E346K, p53tet-E343K/E346K, and p53tet-K351E, harboring charge-reversal mutations at ionic residues.In the first part of this study, the oligomeric state of these p53tet mutants was evaluated (Fig. 3 and Table I) to determine whether these mutations, as is the case with many mutations of hydrophobic residues in the dimer-dimer interface (10Mateu M.G. Fersht A.R. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 2748-2758Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar, 12McCoy M. Stavridi E.S. Waterman J.L. Wieczorek A.M. Opella S.J. Halazonetis T.D.

Biol. 2001; 307: 605-617Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar), change the oligomerization specificity of p53tet from a tetramer to a dimer. Indeed, it was revealed that p53tet-K351E is a dimer in solution, demonstrating that a single mutation to a charged residue is sufficient to produce dimeric p53. This finding confirms our hypothesis that the introduction of a charge-reversal mutation (Lys to Glu) at position 351 of the p53tet domain introduces non-constructive charge repulsions at the dimer-dimer interface.In the next part of this study, the stability of the resulting p53tet mutants was evaluated. It has been established that the oligomeric state and folding pattern of the p53 tetramerization domain are tightly linked features of this protein scaffold, with the monomeric form being essentially unfolded (10Mateu M.G. Fersht A.R. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 2748-2758Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar, 13Mateu M.G. Sanchez Del Pino M.M. Fersht A.R. Nat. Struct.

Thus, thermal unfolding patterns as measured by CD represent an indicator of the tendency of the p53tet domain to oligomerize. As expected for a tetrameric protein, theT m of p53tet is dependent on protein concentration (10Mateu M.G. Fersht A.R. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 2748-2758Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar, 32Johnson C.R. Morin P.E. Arrowsmith C.H. Freire E. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 5309-5316Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). A p53 monomer concentration of 10 μm was thus selected for p53tet-WT to be fully unfolded at 98 °C, allowing us to compare T m values between p53tet-WT and its variants. The T m of p53tet is also dependent on the length of the protein or peptide used (10Mateu M.G. Fersht A.R. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 2748-2758Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). However, the observedT m of 68 °C for the 72-amino acid-long p53tet-WT construct used in this study is comparable to published values for related p53 constructs analyzed under these conditions (9DiGiammarino E.L. Lee A.S. Cadwell C. Zhang W. Bothner B. Ribeiro R.C. Zambetti G. Kriwacki R.W. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2002; 9: 12-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar, 10Mateu M.G. Fersht A.R.

Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 5309-5316Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). The thermal unfolding results shown in Fig. 4 revealed that p53tet-E346K was less stable than p53tet-E343K, suggesting that Glu346is involved in a more pronounced stabilizing interaction at the dimer-dimer interface. Glu346 (rather than Glu343) may thus more strongly interact with Lys351, in contrast with predictions arising from the crystal structure (6Jeffrey P.D. Gorina S. Pavletich N.P. Science. 1995; 267: 1498-1502Crossref PubMed Scopus (435) Google Scholar). CD thermal unfolding studies showed that p53tet-K351E, in addition to being a dimer, was also very unstable, suggesting that the charge at position 351 is an important determinant of the stability of the p53 tetramer.Subsequent experiments were undertaken to determine the potential of these p53tet mutants to form heterotetramers. SEC (Fig. 3) and analytical ultracentrifugation (Table I) data both indicated that either the E343K or E346K mutation was sufficient to produce a species that specifically formed heterotetramers with p53tet-K351E. However, CD data (Fig. 4 and Table II) suggested that when both E343K and E346K mutations were included, the resulting heterotetramer with p53tet-K351E was much more stable relative to the two individual components. The specificity of the heterotetramer between p53tet-E343K/E346K and p53tet-K351E was also confirmed by metal affinity experiments (Fig. 5), which strikingly depicted the necessity of both Glu-to-Lys mutations in determining the specificity of the heterotetramer. It was also found that these two mutants specifically associated with each other, and not with wild-type human p53tet. This interesting finding suggests that human p53 mutants containing such mutations would indeed not have a ‘dominant-negative’ effect on cellular transformation because their intracellular expression would not directly compete or exchange with existing cellular pools of wild-type human p53 (33Chene P. Bechter E. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 286: 1269-1274Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 34Shaulian E. Zauberman A. Ginsberg D. Oren M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 5581-5592Crossref PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar). This study demonstrates for the first time the important contribution of ionic interactions involving Glu343, Glu346, and Lys351 to the stability of the dimer-dimer interface of the human p53tet domain. Human p53 plays an important role in tumor suppression (1Lane D.P. Nature. 1992; 358: 15-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (4437) Google Scholar, 2Arrowsmith C.H. Morin P.

In particular, residues 325–355 of human p53 (p53tet) spontaneously form a tetramer in solution (see Fig. 1 a) (5Chene P. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 2611-2617Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar, 6Jeffrey P.D. Gorina S. Pavletich N.P. Science. 1995; 267: 1498-1502Crossref PubMed Scopus (435) Google Scholar, 7Lee W. Harvey T.S. Yin Y. Yau P. Litchfield D. Arrowsmith C.H. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1994; 1: 877-890Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). Each monomer within the context of the p53tet domain adopts an identical structure,viz. a short N-terminal β-strand (residues 326–333) followed by a turn and a C-terminal α-helical domain (residues 335–354). Two monomers associate in an antiparallel fashion through contacts between β-sheet strands as well as hydrophobic interactions involving α-helical residues to form a “primary dimer” (6Jeffrey P.D. Gorina S. Pavletich N.P. Science. 1995; 267: 1498-1502Crossref PubMed Scopus (435) Google Scholar, 7Lee W. Harvey T.S. Yin Y. Yau P. Litchfield D. Arrowsmith C.H. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1994; 1: 877-890Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). One significant salt bridge in the p53tet region occurs between Arg337 of one subunit and Asp352 of its adjacent subunit (side chain oxygen–nitrogen distance of 2.72 Å) (6Jeffrey P.D. Gorina S. Pavletich N.P. Science. 1995; 267: 1498-1502Crossref PubMed Scopus (435) Google Scholar), stabilizing the structure of the primary dimer (8Davison T.S. Yin P. Nie E. Kay C. Arrowsmith C.H.

Biol. 2002; 9: 12-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). Two primary dimers then self-associate through an interface derived from residues located in their α-helical domains to form a “dimer of dimers,” referred to as a p53 tetramer. Mutations of amino acids at this interface have highlighted the importance of hydrophobic residues leading to the formation of the tetramer as well as stable p53 dimers (10Mateu M.G. Fersht A.R.

To date, knowledge relating to the contribution of charged residues at this interface to the nature and stability of the tetramer through ion pair formation remains minimal. In comparison, the impact of ion pairs on the oligomeric state and stability of other self-assembling peptide domains such as coiled-coil sequences is well documented. Naturally occurring and engineered coiled-coil domains have been shown to form homodimers as well as heterodimers (16Graddis T.J. Myszka D.G. Chaiken I.M.

Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 2824-2829Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Protein complexes such as the Fos-Jun heterodimer (19O'Shea E.K. Rutkowski R. Kim P.S. Cell. 1992; 68: 699-708Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (370) Google Scholar), for example, occur as a result of charged groups in their coiled-coil regions, which promote hetero-oligomerization through the destabilization of homotypic interactions. An examination of the crystal structure (6Jeffrey P.D. Gorina S. Pavletich N.P. Science. 1995; 267: 1498-1502Crossref PubMed Scopus (435) Google Scholar) of the human p53 tetramerization domain reveals the presence of one arginine (Arg342), one lysine (Lys351), and four glutamates (Glu339, Glu343, Glu346, and Glu349) within the boundaries of the dimer-dimer interface (residues 338–351). Of these residues, the only pairs of complementary charged side chains proximal enough to form an intermonomer salt bridge involve Lys351 with Glu343 and/or Glu346 (see Fig. 1 b). The side chain oxygen of Glu343 on one monomer was found to be located 2.58 Å from the nitrogen side chain of Lys351on another monomer. NMR structures of p53tet (7Lee W. Harvey T.S. Yin Y. Yau P.

Finally, alignment of the tetramerization domain sequences of p53 fromXenopus laevis (22Soussi T. Caron de Fromentel C. Mechali M. May P. Kress M. Oncogene. 1987; 1: 71-78PubMed Google Scholar) and rainbow trout (23Caron de Fromentel C. Pakdel F. Chapus A. Baney C. May P. Soussi T. Gene (Amst.). 1992; 112: 241-245Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar) as well as of human p73 and p63 (24Kaghad M. Bonnet H. Yang A. Creancier L. Biscan J.C. Valent A. Minty A. Chalon P.

Taken together, these findings suggest that the presence of salt bridges involving Lys351 with Glu343 and/or Glu346would contribute four or more ionic interactions within the context of the p53 tetramer interface, favoring the stabilization and self-association of primary dimers. To test this hypothesis, we engineered variants of the p53tet domain harboring charge-reversal mutations at positions 343, 346, and 351 (see Fig. 1 c). Mutants p53tet-E343K, p53tet-E346K, and p53tet-E343K/E346K will result in dimer-dimer interfaces exhibiting a preponderance of positively charged side chains, whereas mutant p53tet-K351E will produce an interface enriched for negatively charged residues, both scenarios leading to electrostatic interactions unfavorable for tetramer formation. Conversely, the negative effects of introducing like charges at the dimer-dimer interface should be nullified in the case of heterotetramers composed of dimers of p53tet-K351E paired with p53tet-E343K, p53tet-E346K, or p53tet-E343K/E346K. The stability and oligomeric state of these p53tet constructs were analyzed in a series of biophysical experiments to resolve the role of such salt bridges at the dimer-dimer interface. DISCUSSIONThe tetramerization domain of human p53 is an important part of this key tumor suppressor protein. Analysis of the dimer-dimer interface of the human p53 tetramerization domain suggests that ion pair interactions between Glu343, Glu346, and Lys351 may contribute significantly to the stability of the tetramer. This hypothesis was further supported by the fact that the tetramerization domain sequences of p53 in other organisms as well as of human p63 and p73 (Fig. 1 c) display the naturally occurring E343K mutation. This mutation is always coupled with a corresponding loss of the positively charged lysine residue at position 351. This hypothesis was tested by designing and analyzing variants of the tetramerization domain of human p53, viz. p53tet-E343K, p53tet-E346K, p53tet-E343K/E346K, and p53tet-K351E, harboring charge-reversal mutations at ionic residues.In the first part of this study, the oligomeric state of these p53tet mutants was evaluated (Fig. 3 and Table I) to determine whether these mutations, as is the case with many mutations of hydrophobic residues in the dimer-dimer interface (10Mateu M.G.

Indeed, it was revealed that p53tet-K351E is a dimer in solution, demonstrating that a single mutation to a charged residue is sufficient to produce dimeric p53. This finding confirms our hypothesis that the introduction of a charge-reversal mutation (Lys to Glu) at position 351 of the p53tet domain introduces non-constructive charge repulsions at the dimer-dimer interface.In the next part of this study, the stability of the resulting p53tet mutants was evaluated. It has been established that the oligomeric state and folding pattern of the p53 tetramerization domain are tightly linked features of this protein scaffold, with the monomeric form being essentially unfolded (10Mateu M.G.

A p53 monomer concentration of 10 μm was thus selected for p53tet-WT to be fully unfolded at 98 °C, allowing us to compare T m values between p53tet-WT and its variants.

The thermal unfolding results shown in Fig. 4 revealed that p53tet-E346K was less stable than p53tet-E343K, suggesting that Glu346is involved in a more pronounced stabilizing interaction at the dimer-dimer interface.

The thermal unfolding results shown in Fig. 4 revealed that p53tet-E346K was less stable than p53tet-E343K, suggesting that Glu346is involved in a more pronounced stabilizing interaction at the dimer-dimer interface. Glu346 (rather than Glu343) may thus more strongly interact with Lys351, in contrast with predictions arising from the crystal structure (6Jeffrey P.D. Gorina S. Pavletich N.P. Science. 1995; 267: 1498-1502Crossref PubMed Scopus (435) Google Scholar). CD thermal unfolding studies showed that p53tet-K351E, in addition to being a dimer, was also very unstable, suggesting that the charge at position 351 is an important determinant of the stability of the p53 tetramer. Subsequent experiments were undertaken to determine the potential of these p53tet mutants to form heterotetramers. SEC (Fig. 3) and analytical ultracentrifugation (Table I) data both indicated that either the E343K or E346K mutation was sufficient to produce a species that specifically formed heterotetramers with p53tet-K351E. However, CD data (Fig. 4 and Table II) suggested that when both E343K and E346K mutations were included, the resulting heterotetramer with p53tet-K351E was much more stable relative to the two individual components. The specificity of the heterotetramer between p53tet-E343K/E346K and p53tet-K351E was also confirmed by metal affinity experiments (Fig. 5), which strikingly depicted the necessity of both Glu-to-Lys mutations in determining the specificity of the heterotetramer. It was also found that these two mutants specifically associated with each other, and not with wild-type human p53tet. This interesting finding suggests that human p53 mutants containing such mutations would indeed not have a ‘dominant-negative’ effect on cellular transformation because their intracellular expression would not directly compete or exchange with existing cellular pools of wild-type human p53 (33Chene P.

In the course of catalysis, the enzyme cycles between a form containing a transferred sulfur held as a persulfide (RSSH) on active site cysteine 247 and a form without the transferred sulfur (1Westley J. Methods Enzymol. 1981; 77: 285-291Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Rhodanese is a monomeric protein, and its crystal structure is known (2Ploegman J.H. Drent G. Kalk K.H. Hol W.G.

The active site is in the C-terminal domain close to the interdomain interface, and domain separation is associated with inactivation. There are four cysteine residues at sequence positions 63, 247, 254, and 263, and all are reduced in the native enzyme. The persulfide-containing form of wild type rhodanese, WT-ES,1 and rhodanese without the transferred sulfur, WT-E, have virtually identical crystal structures (2Ploegman J.H. Drent G. Kalk K.H.

Site-directed mutagenesis shows that Cys-247 is the only cysteine residue essential for rhodanese activity (7Miller-Martini D.M. Hua S. Horowitz P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 12414-12418Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 8Miller-Martini D.M. Chirgwin J.M. Horowitz P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 3423-3428Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Although it is clear from the crystal structure that none of the cysteine residues in native rhodanese is in a favorable position to form disulfide bonds, Cys-247 always forms disulfide bonds with other cysteines in the C-terminal domain during oxidative inactivation, to which rhodanese is particularly sensitive. These disulfides can form from the native state during oxidative inactivation by reagents such as phenylglyoxal in a process that obviously requires a conformational change. In addition, single site oxidation at the active site can form a sulfenic acid or higher oxidation states. These oxidative events are the major reactions that result in incomplete reactivation of the enzyme after denaturation. The mutagenesis of the three nonessential cysteine residues as studied here (C63S, C254S, and C263S) to produce the species C3S removes the possibility of intramolecular disulfide bonds and makes the enzyme an important model for studies of folding.Rhodanese has been one of the most studied substrates for assisted folding by the chaperonin GroEL. Using the wild type enzyme, rhodanese only binds easily to GroEL when it is presented to the chaperonin after it has been extensively unfolded. The native enzyme does not interact with GroEL (9).The results presented here, based on studies using controlled proteolysis and mass spectrometry, suggest that the C-terminal domain of the persulfide-containing C3S (C3S-ES) is considerably less stable than WT-ES although the specific enzyme activities are the same. Although it is known that significant binding to GroEL requires forms of rhodanese that are unfolded further than states with folded domains, no specific information is known about these less folded forms. Because it was found that active C3S-ES is less stable than the wild type enzyme, we compared the properties of the form of C3S lacking transferred sulfur (C3S-E) and rhodanese (WT-E) with respect to GroEL binding. The results suggest that active C3S with an unstable C-terminal domain exists in equilibrium with the conformer(s), accessible from the native state that can interact with GroEL. This contrasts with the lack of binding observed with the wild type enzyme. Thus, we have identified a particular region of C3S that is correlated with its decreased stability and increased binding to GroEL. These results present an opportunity for studying the conformational correlates required for substrate binding to GroEL.DISCUSSIONOne of the major side reactions that limits the folding of denatured rhodanese is the formation of intramolecular disulfide bonds involving the active site cysteine residue and the nonessential sulfhydryl groups (25, 26). According to the x-ray structure, the cysteines are not close enough to form these disulfides. This implies flexibility in solution that would permit the observed disulfide formation. We find in this study that the removal of the three nonessential cysteine residues (cysteines 63, 254, and 263) to form C3S makes rhodanese less stable in its C-terminal domain, although the specific activities at 25 °C and the average secondary structures reported by CD are the same for the mutant and WT. In addition, C3S is protected against proteolysis by the presence of the substrate, thiosulfate.The x-ray structure of WT rhodanese permits us to speculate as to the relation between the mutations prepared here and the consequences that are observed. Rhodanese is folded into two separate globular domains (N-terminal domain consisting of residues 1–142 and C-terminal domain consisting of residues 159–293) that are tightly coupled at an interdomain interface by numerous hydrophobic interactions. The domains are covalently connected by a tether consisting of a long loop of residues 143–158 that interacts with the N-terminal domain. The two domains are of nearly equal size, and they have very similar conformations. Thus, it is reasonable that the N-terminal domain is more stable than the C-terminal domain due to the additional interactions with the tether. The active site Cys-247 that holds the sulfur transferred from thiosulfate is in the interdomain region, and it has been shown that the activity of the enzyme is sensitive to conditions that disrupt the interdomain interactions. Numerous attempts at preparing individual domains have been unsuccessful, presumably due to the extensive hydrophobic surfaces that would be exposed on the individual domains.Of the nonessential sulfhydryl groups, Cys-254 has been shown to be the most influential at affecting the structure and function of rhodanese (3Hol W.G. Lijk L.J. Kalk K.H. Fundam. Appl. Toxicol. 1983; 3: 370-376Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 4Gliubich F. Berni R. Colapietro M. Barba L. Zanotti G. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1998; 54: 481-486Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar, 6Gliubich F. Gazerro M. Zanotti G. Delbono S. Bombieri G. Berni R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 21054-21061Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). This is reasonable since Cys-63 is in the N-terminal domain, and the main effects in C3S are in the C-terminal domain. Cys-263 has been shown to have smaller effects, which is reasonable since it is close to the surface of the protein. Helices from each of the domains (D′ helix in the C-terminal domain, residues 251–264, and the D helix in the N-terminal domain, residues 107–119) cross each other at Cys-254, which appears to interact with Trp-113 and Pro-109 from the N-terminal domain. A number of residues from the D and D′ helices interact hydrophobically to stabilize the interdomain interface. Thus, the mutation at Cys-254 can affect the interdomain surfaces or their interactions. Changes in this contact region can affect the domain structure and permit the proteolytic clip that occurs within the C-terminal domain to leave a stable fragment that ends at Arg-182.The proteolysis is interesting. Arg-182, the final cleavage point, is protected from proteolytic access by a long turn in the structure consisting of residues 189–211 (4Gliubich F. Berni R. Colapietro M. Barba L. Zanotti G. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1998; 54: 481-486Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar). Movement of this turn would permit proteolytic access, and the unstructured nature of the turn would make changes in its orientation very difficult to detect by CD. Interestingly, Arg-186 separates this loop from bond 182–183. Arg-186 is the cationic binding site for the substrate thiosulfate. Thus, thiosulfate binding can easily be envisioned as stabilizing the structure or covering Arg-182, thus preventing proteolytic access.GroEL does not bind native rhodanese in the form containing transferred sulfur, as studied by activity and direct measurement of complex formation (27Bhattacharyya A.M. Horowitz P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 28739-28743Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar, 28Bhattacharyya A.M. Horowitz P.M. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 2421-2428Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). It has been established that for productive binding to GroEL and its reactivation in the presence of GroES/ATP, rhodanese domains must be unfolded (28). The rhodanese form containing transferred sulfur, WT-ES, does not bind to GroEL, as there is no loss in activity in the presence of GroEL. The sulfur-loaded form of mutant rhodanese, C3S-ES, shows the same specific activity as WT-ES and remains fully active in solution. However, it shows slow but significant inactivation in the presence of GroEL. These data are consistent with the view that C3S-ES has a less stable structure than WT-ES and, thus, is able to exist in an equilibrium with an intermediate(s) that can bind to GroEL. Similar observations have been made with dihydrofolate reductase in the absence of substrates (29Viitanen P.V. Donaldson G.K. Lorimer G.H. Lubben T.H. Gatenby A.A. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 9716-9723Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar, 30Clark A.C. Frieden C. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 285: 1777-1788Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar) and pre-β-lactamase (31Laminet A.A. Ziegelhoffer T. Georgopoulos C. Pluckthun A. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 2315-2319Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar), where starting with the native protein, stable complexes can be formed with GroEL. Mitochondrial aspartate aminotransferase forms a modified but catalytically active conformation that can be bound to GroEL (18Lawton J.M. Doonan S. Biochem. J. 1998; 334: 219-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Although the sulfur-loaded forms of both rhodanese and C3S are stable in solution, the forms lacking transferred sulfur inactivate readily. The inactivation may be due to the formation of inter- and intramolecular disulfide-bonded species. The addition of high concentrations of reductant shows insignificant reactivation. Only monomeric species are detected on non-reducing SDS-PAGE and on gel permeation chromatography. All these data rule out the possibility of disulfide-linked species as a cause of inactivation of C3S-E. C3S-E inactivates at a faster rate when co-incubated with GroEL. The faster rate of inactivation may be due to the shift of equilibrium between the native state and the conformer(s) recognizable by GroEL. The addition of GroEL/GroES/ATP to C3S-E after complete inactivation generates 100% active protein. WT-E does not show any additional inactivation in the presence of GroEL, which indicates that GroEL cannot bind the intermediates formed during inactivation. The addition of GroEL/GroES/ATP to inactivated samples leads to a maximum of ∼72% reactivation with WT. The incomplete reactivation may be due to the fact that either GroEL cannot capture all the conformers formed or cannot reactivate all of those to active protein. The greater accessibility of the tryptophan residues in C3S-E suggests that that they are more exposed, and it is consistent with the protein having a more labile structure than WT-E. This loss in compactness in the structure of C3S is reflected in more productive binding to GroEL. All these data suggest that C3S has less compact structure in its C-terminal domain, and it is this domain that preferentially binds to GroEL. Importantly, the differential stability of C3S is induced by the binding of the substrate, thiosulfate. These studies will provide a means to identify and characterize the binding determinants on protein targets for GroEL. The mitochondrial enzyme rhodanese (EC 2.8.1.1) catalyzes the transfer of a sulfur atom from a sulfur donor, e.g.thiosulfate to an acceptor, e.g. cyanide. In the course of catalysis, the enzyme cycles between a form containing a transferred sulfur held as a persulfide (RSSH) on active site cysteine 247 and a form without the transferred sulfur (1Westley J.

Site-directed mutagenesis shows that Cys-247 is the only cysteine residue essential for rhodanese activity (7Miller-Martini D.M. Hua S. Horowitz P.M. J. Biol.

Although it is clear from the crystal structure that none of the cysteine residues in native rhodanese is in a favorable position to form disulfide bonds, Cys-247 always forms disulfide bonds with other cysteines in the C-terminal domain during oxidative inactivation, to which rhodanese is particularly sensitive. These disulfides can form from the native state during oxidative inactivation by reagents such as phenylglyoxal in a process that obviously requires a conformational change. In addition, single site oxidation at the active site can form a sulfenic acid or higher oxidation states. These oxidative events are the major reactions that result in incomplete reactivation of the enzyme after denaturation. The mutagenesis of the three nonessential cysteine residues as studied here (C63S, C254S, and C263S) to produce the species C3S removes the possibility of intramolecular disulfide bonds and makes the enzyme an important model for studies of folding. Rhodanese has been one of the most studied substrates for assisted folding by the chaperonin GroEL. Using the wild type enzyme, rhodanese only binds easily to GroEL when it is presented to the chaperonin after it has been extensively unfolded. The native enzyme does not interact with GroEL (9). The results presented here, based on studies using controlled proteolysis and mass spectrometry, suggest that the C-terminal domain of the persulfide-containing C3S (C3S-ES) is considerably less stable than WT-ES although the specific enzyme activities are the same. Although it is known that significant binding to GroEL requires forms of rhodanese that are unfolded further than states with folded domains, no specific information is known about these less folded forms. Because it was found that active C3S-ES is less stable than the wild type enzyme, we compared the properties of the form of C3S lacking transferred sulfur (C3S-E) and rhodanese (WT-E) with respect to GroEL binding. The results suggest that active C3S with an unstable C-terminal domain exists in equilibrium with the conformer(s), accessible from the native state that can interact with GroEL. This contrasts with the lack of binding observed with the wild type enzyme. Thus, we have identified a particular region of C3S that is correlated with its decreased stability and increased binding to GroEL. These results present an opportunity for studying the conformational correlates required for substrate binding to GroEL. DISCUSSIONOne of the major side reactions that limits the folding of denatured rhodanese is the formation of intramolecular disulfide bonds involving the active site cysteine residue and the nonessential sulfhydryl groups (25, 26). According to the x-ray structure, the cysteines are not close enough to form these disulfides. This implies flexibility in solution that would permit the observed disulfide formation. We find in this study that the removal of the three nonessential cysteine residues (cysteines 63, 254, and 263) to form C3S makes rhodanese less stable in its C-terminal domain, although the specific activities at 25 °C and the average secondary structures reported by CD are the same for the mutant and WT. In addition, C3S is protected against proteolysis by the presence of the substrate, thiosulfate.The x-ray structure of WT rhodanese permits us to speculate as to the relation between the mutations prepared here and the consequences that are observed.

The domains are covalently connected by a tether consisting of a long loop of residues 143–158 that interacts with the N-terminal domain. The two domains are of nearly equal size, and they have very similar conformations. Thus, it is reasonable that the N-terminal domain is more stable than the C-terminal domain due to the additional interactions with the tether. The active site Cys-247 that holds the sulfur transferred from thiosulfate is in the interdomain region, and it has been shown that the activity of the enzyme is sensitive to conditions that disrupt the interdomain interactions. Numerous attempts at preparing individual domains have been unsuccessful, presumably due to the extensive hydrophobic surfaces that would be exposed on the individual domains.Of the nonessential sulfhydryl groups, Cys-254 has been shown to be the most influential at affecting the structure and function of rhodanese (3Hol W.G.

This is reasonable since Cys-63 is in the N-terminal domain, and the main effects in C3S are in the C-terminal domain. Cys-263 has been shown to have smaller effects, which is reasonable since it is close to the surface of the protein. Helices from each of the domains (D′ helix in the C-terminal domain, residues 251–264, and the D helix in the N-terminal domain, residues 107–119) cross each other at Cys-254, which appears to interact with Trp-113 and Pro-109 from the N-terminal domain. A number of residues from the D and D′ helices interact hydrophobically to stabilize the interdomain interface. Thus, the mutation at Cys-254 can affect the interdomain surfaces or their interactions. Changes in this contact region can affect the domain structure and permit the proteolytic clip that occurs within the C-terminal domain to leave a stable fragment that ends at Arg-182.The proteolysis is interesting. Arg-182, the final cleavage point, is protected from proteolytic access by a long turn in the structure consisting of residues 189–211 (4Gliubich F. Berni R. Colapietro M. Barba L. Zanotti G.

It has been established that for productive binding to GroEL and its reactivation in the presence of GroES/ATP, rhodanese domains must be unfolded (28). The rhodanese form containing transferred sulfur, WT-ES, does not bind to GroEL, as there is no loss in activity in the presence of GroEL. The sulfur-loaded form of mutant rhodanese, C3S-ES, shows the same specific activity as WT-ES and remains fully active in solution. However, it shows slow but significant inactivation in the presence of GroEL. These data are consistent with the view that C3S-ES has a less stable structure than WT-ES and, thus, is able to exist in an equilibrium with an intermediate(s) that can bind to GroEL. Similar observations have been made with dihydrofolate reductase in the absence of substrates (29Viitanen P.V. Donaldson G.K. Lorimer G.H. Lubben T.H. Gatenby A.A. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 9716-9723Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar, 30Clark A.C. Frieden C. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 285: 1777-1788Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar) and pre-β-lactamase (31Laminet A.A. Ziegelhoffer T. Georgopoulos C. Pluckthun A. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 2315-2319Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar), where starting with the native protein, stable complexes can be formed with GroEL. Mitochondrial aspartate aminotransferase forms a modified but catalytically active conformation that can be bound to GroEL (18Lawton J.M. Doonan S. Biochem. J. 1998; 334: 219-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Although the sulfur-loaded forms of both rhodanese and C3S are stable in solution, the forms lacking transferred sulfur inactivate readily. The inactivation may be due to the formation of inter- and intramolecular disulfide-bonded species. The addition of high concentrations of reductant shows insignificant reactivation. Only monomeric species are detected on non-reducing SDS-PAGE and on gel permeation chromatography. All these data rule out the possibility of disulfide-linked species as a cause of inactivation of C3S-E. C3S-E inactivates at a faster rate when co-incubated with GroEL. The faster rate of inactivation may be due to the shift of equilibrium between the native state and the conformer(s) recognizable by GroEL. The addition of GroEL/GroES/ATP to C3S-E after complete inactivation generates 100% active protein. WT-E does not show any additional inactivation in the presence of GroEL, which indicates that GroEL cannot bind the intermediates formed during inactivation. The addition of GroEL/GroES/ATP to inactivated samples leads to a maximum of ∼72% reactivation with WT. The incomplete reactivation may be due to the fact that either GroEL cannot capture all the conformers formed or cannot reactivate all of those to active protein. The greater accessibility of the tryptophan residues in C3S-E suggests that that they are more exposed, and it is consistent with the protein having a more labile structure than WT-E. This loss in compactness in the structure of C3S is reflected in more productive binding to GroEL. All these data suggest that C3S has less compact structure in its C-terminal domain, and it is this domain that preferentially binds to GroEL. Importantly, the differential stability of C3S is induced by the binding of the substrate, thiosulfate. These studies will provide a means to identify and characterize the binding determinants on protein targets for GroEL. One of the major side reactions that limits the folding of denatured rhodanese is the formation of intramolecular disulfide bonds involving the active site cysteine residue and the nonessential sulfhydryl groups (25, 26). According to the x-ray structure, the cysteines are not close enough to form these disulfides. This implies flexibility in solution that would permit the observed disulfide formation. We find in this study that the removal of the three nonessential cysteine residues (cysteines 63, 254, and 263) to form C3S makes rhodanese less stable in its C-terminal domain, although the specific activities at 25 °C and the average secondary structures reported by CD are the same for the mutant and WT. In addition, C3S is protected against proteolysis by the presence of the substrate, thiosulfate. The x-ray structure of WT rhodanese permits us to speculate as to the relation between the mutations prepared here and the consequences that are observed. Rhodanese is folded into two separate globular domains (N-terminal domain consisting of residues 1–142 and C-terminal domain consisting of residues 159–293) that are tightly coupled at an interdomain interface by numerous hydrophobic interactions. The domains are covalently connected by a tether consisting of a long loop of residues 143–158 that interacts with the N-terminal domain. The two domains are of nearly equal size, and they have very similar conformations. Thus, it is reasonable that the N-terminal domain is more stable than the C-terminal domain due to the additional interactions with the tether. The active site Cys-247 that holds the sulfur transferred from thiosulfate is in the interdomain region, and it has been shown that the activity of the enzyme is sensitive to conditions that disrupt the interdomain interactions. Numerous attempts at preparing individual domains have been unsuccessful, presumably due to the extensive hydrophobic surfaces that would be exposed on the individual domains. Of the nonessential sulfhydryl groups, Cys-254 has been shown to be the most influential at affecting the structure and function of rhodanese (3Hol W.G. Lijk L.J. Kalk K.H. Fundam. Appl. Toxicol. 1983; 3: 370-376Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 4Gliubich F. Berni R. Colapietro M. Barba L. Zanotti G. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1998; 54: 481-486Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar, 6Gliubich F. Gazerro M. Zanotti G. Delbono S. Bombieri G. Berni R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 21054-21061Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). This is reasonable since Cys-63 is in the N-terminal domain, and the main effects in C3S are in the C-terminal domain. Cys-263 has been shown to have smaller effects, which is reasonable since it is close to the surface of the protein. Helices from each of the domains (D′ helix in the C-terminal domain, residues 251–264, and the D helix in the N-terminal domain, residues 107–119) cross each other at Cys-254, which appears to interact with Trp-113 and Pro-109 from the N-terminal domain. A number of residues from the D and D′ helices interact hydrophobically to stabilize the interdomain interface. Thus, the mutation at Cys-254 can affect the interdomain surfaces or their interactions. Changes in this contact region can affect the domain structure and permit the proteolytic clip that occurs within the C-terminal domain to leave a stable fragment that ends at Arg-182. The proteolysis is interesting. Arg-182, the final cleavage point, is protected from proteolytic access by a long turn in the structure consisting of residues 189–211 (4Gliubich F. Berni R. Colapietro M. Barba L. Zanotti G. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1998; 54: 481-486Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar). Movement of this turn would permit proteolytic access, and the unstructured nature of the turn would make changes in its orientation very difficult to detect by CD. Interestingly, Arg-186 separates this loop from bond 182–183. Arg-186 is the cationic binding site for the substrate thiosulfate. Thus, thiosulfate binding can easily be envisioned as stabilizing the structure or covering Arg-182, thus preventing proteolytic access. GroEL does not bind native rhodanese in the form containing transferred sulfur, as studied by activity and direct measurement of complex formation (27Bhattacharyya A.M. Horowitz P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 28739-28743Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar, 28Bhattacharyya A.M. Horowitz P.M. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 2421-2428Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). It has been established that for productive binding to GroEL and its reactivation in the presence of GroES/ATP, rhodanese domains must be unfolded (28). The rhodanese form containing transferred sulfur, WT-ES, does not bind to GroEL, as there is no loss in activity in the presence of GroEL. The sulfur-loaded form of mutant rhodanese, C3S-ES, shows the same specific activity as WT-ES and remains fully active in solution. However, it shows slow but significant inactivation in the presence of GroEL.
