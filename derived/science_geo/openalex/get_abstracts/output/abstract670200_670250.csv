Finding human host factors that are essential for SARS-CoV-2 infection could facilitate the formulation of treatment strategies. Using a human kidney cell line—HK-2—that is highly susceptible to SARS-CoV-2, we performed a genome-wide RNAi screen and identified virus dependency factors (VDFs), which play regulatory roles in biological pathways linked to clinical manifestations of SARS-CoV-2 infection. We found a role for a secretory form of SARS-CoV-2 receptor, soluble angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (sACE2), in SARS-CoV-2 infection. Further investigation revealed that SARS-CoV-2 exploits receptor-mediated endocytosis through interaction between its spike with sACE2 or sACE2-vasopressin via AT1 or AVPR1B, respectively. Our identification of VDFs and the regulatory effect of sACE2 on SARS-CoV-2 infection shed insight into pathogenesis and cell entry mechanisms of SARS-CoV-2 as well as potential treatment strategies for COVID-19."

To link immune response variation to disease severity and outcome over time, we longitudinally assessed circulating proteins as well as 188 surface protein markers, transcriptome, and T cell receptor sequence simultaneously in single peripheral immune cells from COVID-19 patients. Conditional-independence network analysis revealed primary correlates of disease severity, including gene expression signatures of apoptosis in plasmacytoid dendritic cells and attenuated inflammation but increased fatty acid metabolism in CD56dimCD16hi NK cells linked positively to circulating interleukin (IL)-15. CD8+ T cell activation was apparent without signs of exhaustion. Although cellular inflammation was depressed in severe patients early after hospitalization, it became elevated by days 17-23 post symptom onset, suggestive of a late wave of inflammatory responses. Furthermore, circulating protein trajectories at this time were divergent between and predictive of recovery versus fatal outcomes. Our findings stress the importance of timing in the analysis, clinical monitoring, and therapeutic intervention of COVID-19."

Here, we show that BCL6-expressing Tregs, known as follicular regulatory T (Tfr) cells, produce abundant neuritin protein that targets B cells. Mice lacking Tfr cells or neuritin in Foxp3-expressing cells accumulated early plasma cells in germinal centers (GCs) and developed autoantibodies against histones and tissue-specific self-antigens. Upon immunization, these mice also produced increased plasma IgE and IgG1. We show that neuritin is taken up by B cells, causes phosphorylation of numerous proteins, and dampens IgE class switching. Neuritin reduced differentiation of mouse and human GC B cells into plasma cells, downregulated BLIMP-1, and upregulated BCL6. Administration of neuritin to Tfr-deficient mice prevented the accumulation of early plasma cells in GCs. Production of neuritin by Tfr cells emerges as a central mechanism to suppress B cell-driven autoimmunity and IgE-mediated allergies."

https://openalex.org/W3134662817,"Store-operated calcium entry (SOCE) is activated by depletion of Ca2+ from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and mediated by stromal interaction molecule (STIM) proteins. Here, we show that in rat and mouse hippocampal neurons, acute ER Ca2+ depletion increases presynaptic Ca2+ levels and glutamate release through a pathway dependent on STIM2 and the synaptic Ca2+ sensor synaptotagmin-7 (syt7). In contrast, synaptotagmin-1 (syt1) can suppress SOCE-mediated spontaneous release, and STIM2 is required for the increase in spontaneous release seen during syt1 loss of function. We also demonstrate that chronic ER stress activates the same pathway leading to syt7-dependent potentiation of spontaneous glutamate release. During ER stress, inhibition of SOCE or syt7-driven fusion partially restored basal neurotransmission and decreased expression of pro-apoptotic markers, indicating that these processes participate in the amplification of ER-stress-related damage. Taken together, we propose that presynaptic SOCE links ER stress and augmented spontaneous neurotransmission, which may, in turn, facilitate neurodegeneration."
https://openalex.org/W3134394734,"The Stimulator of Interferon Genes (STING) pathway is implicated in the innate immune response and is important in both oncogenesis and cancer treatment. Specifically, activation of the cytosolic DNA sensor STING in antigen-presenting cells (APCs) induces a type I interferon response and cytokine production that facilitates antitumor immune therapy. However, use of STING agonists (STINGa) as a cancer therapeutic has been limited by unfavorable pharmacological properties and targeting inefficiency due to rapid clearance and limited uptake into the cytosol. Exosomes, a class of extracellular vesicles shed by all cells are under consideration for their use as effective carriers of drugs owing to their innate ability to be taken up by cells and their biocompatibility for optimal drug biodistribution. Therefore, we engineered exosomes to deliver the STING agonist cyclic GMP-AMP (iExoSTINGa), to exploit their favorable pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics. Selective targeting of the STING pathway in APCs with iExoSTINGa was associated with superior potency compared with STINGa alone in suppressing B16F10 tumor growth. Moreover, iExoSTINGa showed superior uptake of STINGa into dendritic cells compared with STINGa alone, which led to increased accumulation of activated CD8+ T-cells and an antitumor immune response. Our study highlights the potential of exosomes in general, and iExoSTINGa specifically, in enhancing cancer therapy outcomes."

https://openalex.org/W3133612898,"Impaired ribosome function is the underlying etiology in a group of bone marrow failure syndromes called ribosomopathies. However, how ribosomes are regulated remains poorly understood, as are approaches to restore hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) function loss because of defective ribosome biogenesis. Here we reveal a role of the E3 ubiquitin ligase HectD1 in regulating HSC function via ribosome assembly and protein translation. Hectd1-deficient HSCs exhibit a striking defect in transplantation ability and ex vivo maintenance concomitant with reduced protein synthesis and growth rate under stress conditions. Mechanistically, HectD1 ubiquitinates and degrades ZNF622, an assembly factor for the ribosomal 60S subunit. Hectd1 loss leads to accumulation of ZNF622 and the anti-association factor eIF6 on 60S, resulting in 60S/40S joining defects. Importantly, Znf622 depletion in Hectd1-deficient HSCs restored ribosomal subunit joining, protein synthesis, and HSC reconstitution capacity. These findings highlight the importance of ubiquitin-coordinated ribosome assembly in HSC regeneration."
https://openalex.org/W3134265951,"We previously showed that the vitamin D receptor (VDR) plays a crucial role in acute inflammatory bowel disease and that intestinal fibrosis is a common complication of Crohn’s disease (CD). Epithelial–mesenchymal transition (EMT) is an important hallmark of fibrogenesis through which epithelial cells lose their epithelial phenotype and transform into mesenchymal cells. It is known that the VDR plays an essential role in epithelial integrity and mitochondrial function, but its role in intestinal fibrosis remains unknown. Here, we investigated whether the VDR is involved in epithelial mitochondrial dysfunction that results in EMT in intestinal fibrosis. Using human CD samples, intestine-specific VDR-KO mice, and fibroblast cellular models, we showed that the expression of the VDR was significantly lower in intestinal stenotic areas than in nonstenotic areas in patients with chronic CD. Genetic deletion of the VDR in the intestinal epithelium exacerbated intestinal fibrosis in mice administered with dextran sulfate sodium or 2,4,6-trinitrobenzene sulfonic acid, two experimental colitis inducers. In addition, we found that vitamin D dietary intervention regulated intestinal fibrosis by modulating the intestinal expression of the VDR. Mechanistically, knocking down the VDR in both CCD-18Co cells and human primary colonic fibroblasts promoted fibroblast activation, whereas VDR overexpression or VDR agonist administration inhibited fibroblast activation. Further analysis illustrated that the VDR inhibited EMT in the HT29 cell model and that mitochondrial dysfunction mediated epithelial integrity and barrier function in VDR-deficient epithelial cells. Together, our data for the first time demonstrate that VDR activation alleviates intestinal fibrosis by inhibiting fibroblast activation and epithelial mitochondria-mediated EMT.

Intestinal fibrosis is a common complication of Crohn’s disease (CD), and the underlying mechanism has not been fully clarified (1Torres J. Mehandru S. Colombel J.F. Peyrin-Biroulet L. Crohn's disease.Lancet. 2017; 389: 1741-1755Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1005) Google Scholar). Repeated episodes of inflammation cause extracellular matrix (ECM) deposition in the mucosa and submucosa, and patients with CD gradually develop intestinal fibrosis (2Thia K.T. Sandborn W.J. Harmsen W.S. Zinsmeister A.R. Loftus Jr., E.V.

As reported, 30% to 50% of patients with CD develop intestinal fibrosis, which is characterized by lumen stenosis and complicated by fistulas and local abscesses, within 10 years (3Wang Z.T. Hu J.J.

In addition, except for surgical resection, there is no effective way to eliminate symptoms, and the recurrence rate after surgery is as high as 55% to 70% within 10 years (5Peyrin-Biroulet L. Loftus Jr., E.V. Colombel J.F. Sandborn W.J. The natural history of adult Crohn's disease in population-based cohorts.Am. J. Gastroenterol. 2010; 105: 289-297Crossref PubMed Scopus (679) Google Scholar). Although fibrosis is caused by repeated episodes of inflammation, controlling CD activity alone cannot prevent or reverse intestinal fibrosis (6Rockey D.C. Bell P.D. Hill J.A. Fibrosis--a common pathway to organ injury and failure.N. Engl. J. Med. 2015; 373: 96Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). Therefore, it is vital to elucidate the pathological mechanism and explore potential targets for the intervention and treatment of intestinal fibrosis. Luminal narrowing and obstruction, which are evident in the intestinal fibrotic process, are characterized by excessive accumulation of ECM components (7Speca S. Rousseaux C. Dubuquoy C. Rieder F. Vetuschi A. Sferra R. Giusti I. Bertin B. Dubuquoy L. Gaudio E. Desreumaux P. Latella G. Novel PPARgamma modulator GED-0507-34 levo ameliorates inflammation-driven intestinal fibrosis.Inflamm. Bowel Dis. 2016; 22: 279-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). ECM deposition mainly results from the activation of myofibroblasts, which originate from resident mesenchymal cells (8Rieder F. Karrasch T. Ben-Horin S. Schirbel A. Ehehalt R. Wehkamp J. de Haar C.

Cellular and molecular mechanisms of intestinal fibrosis.World J. Gastroenterol. 2012; 18: 3635-3661Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). In addition to the ECM, activated myofibroblasts produce type I and III collagens, mucopolysaccharides, remodeling enzymes such as matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), and profibrotic cytokines such as transforming growth factor-β1 (TGF-β1) (10Johnson L.A.

In chronic dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)-induced murine colitis, profibrotic genes such as alpha smooth muscle actin (α-SMA), Collagen I, MMP-9, and connective tissue growth factor (CTGF) (11Holvoet T.

In addition, epithelial–mesenchymal transition (EMT) is an important hallmark of fibrogenesis (14Jiang H. Shen J. Ran Z. Epithelial-mesenchymal transition in Crohn's disease.Mucosal Immunol. 2018; 11: 294-303Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar), through which epithelial cells lose their polarized epithelial phenotype and transform into mesenchymal cells, including myofibroblasts (13Lenti M.V.

Hallmarks of epithelial to mesenchymal transition are detectable in Crohn's disease associated intestinal fibrosis.Clin. Transl. Med. 2015; 4: 1Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). As reported, sustained TGF-β1 upregulation was found in the intestinal fibrotic areas of patients with CD with elevated levels of EMT-related transcription factors (15Scharl M. Huber N. Lang S. Furst A. Jehle E. Rogler G. Hallmarks of epithelial to mesenchymal transition are detectable in Crohn's disease associated intestinal fibrosis.Clin. Transl. Med. 2015; 4: 1Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, the mechanism of EMT in the pathogenesis of intestinal stricture is not fully understood. The vitamin D receptor (VDR) is a member of the steroid receptor family and a vital regulator of skeletal health and calcium and phosphorus homeostasis (16Margolis R.N. Christakos S. The nuclear receptor superfamily of steroid hormones and vitamin D gene regulation. An update.Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 2010; 1192: 208-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). The VDR forms a VDR–retinoid X receptor heterodimeric complex and then binds to specific DNA sequences after being activated by 1,25(OH)2D3 (17Christakos S. Dhawan P. Verstuyf A. Verlinden L. Carmeliet G. Vitamin D: Metabolism, molecular mechanism of action, and pleiotropic effects.Physiol. Rev. 2016; 96: 365-408Crossref PubMed Scopus (959) Google Scholar). The inhibitory effects of vitamin D (VD) and the VDR on acute colitis have been reported previously (18He L. Liu T. Shi Y. Tian F. Hu H. Deb D.K. Chen Y. Bissonnette M. Li Y.C.

Crohns Colitis. 2020; 14: 1103-1118Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar), but the potential effect of the VDR on intestinal fibrosis is currently poorly understood. Previous studies reported diminished VDR protein levels in the intestines of patients with CD compared with control tissues (21Gisbert-Ferrandiz L. Cosin-Roger J. Hernandez C. Macias-Ceja D.C. Ortiz-Masia D. Salvador P. Esplugues J.V. Hinojosa J. Navarro F. Calatayud S. Barrachina M.D. Diminished vitamin D receptor protein levels in Crohn's disease fibroblasts: Effects of vitamin D.Nutrients. 2020; 12: 973Crossref Scopus (5) Google Scholar). In addition, a VD-deficient diet downregulated VDR expression and promoted chronic 2,4,6-trinitrobenzene sulfonic acid (TNBS)-induced intestinal fibrosis (22Tao Q. Wang B. Zheng Y. Jiang X. Pan Z. Ren J. Vitamin D prevents the intestinal fibrosis via induction of vitamin D receptor and inhibition of transforming growth factor-beta1/Smad3 pathway.Dig. Dis. Sci. 2015; 60: 868-875Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Knocking down the VDR facilitated the expression of α-SMA and collagen I in colonic subepithelial myofibroblasts through the TGF-β1/Smad3 pathway (22Tao Q. Wang B. Zheng Y. Jiang X. Pan Z. Ren J. Vitamin D prevents the intestinal fibrosis via induction of vitamin D receptor and inhibition of transforming growth factor-beta1/Smad3 pathway.Dig. Dis. Sci. 2015; 60: 868-875Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Based on this evidence, we hypothesized that the VDR might have an inhibitory effect on intestinal fibrosis. The VDR plays an essential role in the mitochondrial respiratory process (23Consiglio M. Destefanis M. Morena D. Foglizzo V. Forneris M. Pescarmona G. Silvagno F. The vitamin D receptor inhibits the respiratory chain, contributing to the metabolic switch that is essential for cancer cell proliferation.PLoS One. 2014; 9e115816Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). As reported, the VDR has an essential biosynthetic function in the mitochondrial respiratory chain activity and facilitates the energy-producing tricarboxylic acid cycle during cellular proliferation (23Consiglio M. Destefanis M. Morena D. Foglizzo V. Forneris M. Pescarmona G. Silvagno F. The vitamin D receptor inhibits the respiratory chain, contributing to the metabolic switch that is essential for cancer cell proliferation.PLoS One. 2014; 9e115816Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). In a human epidermal keratinocyte cell line, VDR ablation increased the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS), resulting in cellular damage, the loss of mitochondrial integrity, and even apoptotic death in a long-term observation study (24Ricca C. Aillon A. Bergandi L. Alotto D. Castagnoli C. Silvagno F. Vitamin D receptor is necessary for mitochondrial function and cell health.Int. J. Mol. Sci. 2018; 19: 1672Crossref Scopus (77) Google Scholar). In contrast, VD treatment inhibited oxidative stress and mitochondrial dynamics in C2C12 muscle cells (25Chang E. 1,25-Dihydroxyvitamin D decreases tertiary butyl-hydrogen peroxide-induced oxidative stress and increases AMPK/SIRT1 activation in C2C12 muscle cells.Molecules. 2019; 24: 3903Crossref Scopus (23) Google Scholar). However, there are currently no reports about VDR-mediated regulation of mitochondrial function in CD-induced intestinal fibrosis. Given these results, we hypothesized that the VDR was a vital modulator of intestinal fibrosis by regulating mitochondrial functions. The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of the VDR on the pathogenesis of intestinal fibrosis. To this end, we established two classic mouse models of intestinal fibrosis: intestinal epithelium–specific VDR KO and VD dietary intervention. In addition, we used CCD-18Co and human primary colonic fibroblasts to examine the effect of the VDR on fibroblast activation and HT29 cells to explore potential EMT mechanisms. Furthermore, CD intestinal tissues were collected to verify clinical significance. We hypothesized that in the absence of the VDR, fibroblasts could be activated, during which mitochondrial dysfunction would occur in the epithelium, disrupt barrier integrity, and consequently promote EMT and ECM deposition. This mitochondria-dependent VDR/EMT pathway suggests a previously unrecognized mechanism of intestinal fibrogenesis and a novel strategy for antifibrotic therapies. To examine the role of the VDR in intestinal fibrosis, we obtained colonic tissues from both stenotic areas and nonstenotic control areas from the same patients with CD. H&E staining revealed significant broadening of the mucosa, submucosa, and even muscularis in stenotic areas compared with nonstenotic areas (Fig. 1A). Quantification of Masson’s trichrome staining showed massive collagen deposition in the submucosa and mucosa of stenotic areas (Fig. 1, A and B). Strikingly, quantitative PCR analysis of colonic tissues from patients with CD showed increased expression of various fibrosis markers in stenotic areas, including a myofibroblast marker (α-SMA), ECM markers (fibronectin, type I collagen, and CTGF), and MMP-2 and MMP-9 (Fig. 1C). In CD colonic tissues, downregulation of the VDR in stenotic areas was observed, as indicated by immunohistochemistry (IHC) staining, and these results were further confirmed at the mRNA and protein levels (Fig. 1, D–F). In addition, in intestinal fibrosis mouse models, VDR expression was dramatically decreased in the intestines in both chronic DSS–induced mice and chronic TNBS–induced mice (Fig. 1, G and H). Thus, our data indicated enhanced ECM deposition in fibrotic intestinal tissues, accompanied by a significant decrease in VDR expression. To further explore the specific role of the intestinal VDR in the pathogenesis of intestinal fibrosis, we generated intestine-specific VDR-KO (VDRIEC-KO) mice, and their littermate VDRfl/fl mice (flox) were used as controls (Fig. S1A). Repetitive administration of 2% DSS was used to mimic CD-induced intestinal fibrosis. In VDRIEC-KO mice, complete knockdown of VDR expression in colon tissues was confirmed at both the mRNA and protein levels (Fig. 2, D and E). During DSS administration, VDRIEC-KO mice showed a significantly higher body weight loss than VDRfl/fl mice beginning on day 36 (Fig. 2A). In addition, the VDRIEC-KO group was more sensitive to DSS administration, as indicated by a higher death rate and more severe colonic obstruction than those of the VDRfl/fl control group (Fig. S1, B and D), although the colon lengths were similar in the two groups (Fig. S2C). In addition, epithelium-specific knockdown of the VDR increased collagen deposition (Fig. 2B) and resulted in higher fibrosis and inflammation scores (Fig. 2C). Quantitative PCR analysis of the colonic tissues of DSS-induced mice revealed increased expression of fibrosis markers, including fibronectin, MMP-9 and TIMP-1, and inflammation markers, including interleukin-6 and chemokine (C-X-C motif) ligand (Fig. 2F). Although collagen I, TGF-β1, and MMP-2 only showed an increasing trend after chronic DSS administration, these factors were significantly increased in DSS-induced VDRIEC-KO mice compared with mice in the VDRfl/fl DSS group (Fig. 2F, Fig. S1E). In addition, Western blot analysis confirmed the activation of the classic TGF-β1 signaling pathway and ECM deposition, especially in VDRIEC-KO DSS mice (Fig. 2F). These findings suggested that VDR KO in the intestinal epithelium exacerbated chronic DSS-induced intestinal fibrosis and inflammation in mice. As TNBS administration is a well-recognized approach to mimic colitis induced by the immune response, we verified the effect of the VDR on chronic TNBS-induced intestinal fibrosis. Repetitive administration of TNBS caused high death rates. The survival rate of the VDRIEC-KO TNBS group was 57.1%, while that of the VDRfl/fl TNBS group was 66.7% (Fig. 2G). The colon lengths in the two TNBS groups were not different (Fig. S1F). In addition, treatment with TNBS in epithelium-specific VDR-knockdown mice resulted in an histological grade and exacerbated intestinal inflammation and ECM deposition (Fig. 2, H and I). Chronic TNBS administration caused a dramatic decrease in VDR expression (Fig. 2, J and K). Western blot analysis revealed that VDR KO in the epithelium increased the expression of fibronectin, MMP-9, and TGF-β1 after 6 weeks of TNBS administration (Fig. 3J). The increased mRNA levels of these genes also indicated that the VDR KO was an exacerbating factor in TNBS-induced fibrosis (Fig. 2K, Fig. S1G). In addition, we found that vimentin expression was increased, accompanied by decreased expression of zonulin-1 (ZO-1) and E-cadherin, which indicated increased activation of the EMT process in VDRIEC-KO TNBS mice (Fig. 3J). These results showed that the intestinal epithelium–specific VDR KO exacerbated TNBS-induced intestinal fibrosis and EMT. Previous studies reported that repeated TNBS administration increased intestinal inflammation and fibrosis in mice fed a VD-deficient diet, whereas a VD-sufficient diet alleviated fibrosis by inhibiting TGF-β1/Smad3 signal transduction (22Tao Q. Wang B. Zheng Y. Jiang X. Pan Z. Ren J. Vitamin D prevents the intestinal fibrosis via induction of vitamin D receptor and inhibition of transforming growth factor-beta1/Smad3 pathway.Dig. Dis. Sci. 2015; 60: 868-875Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). However, the effect VD dietary intervention on chronic DSS-induced fibrosis mouse models is unknown, considering the different pathogeneses associated with TNBS and DSS administration. Thus, we investigated the effect of VD intervention on intestinal fibrosis. Male C57BL/6 mice were given a VD-deficient diet or VD-supplemented diet before 3 weeks of repeated DSS administration (Fig. 3A). DSS administration induced obvious body weight loss, especially in the VD-deficient group (Fig. S2A). The survival rate of the VD-deficient DSS group was only 33.3%, while that of the VD-supplemented DSS group, especially the VD4000U group, increased to 87.5% (Fig. 3B). In addition, morphologically, the VD-deficient group showed worsened hematochezia, edema, and stiffness, although there was no statistically significant difference in the colon length between the DSS groups (Fig. 3C, Fig. S2B). Feeding DSS-induced mice a VD-deficient diet exacerbated chronic inflammation and fibrosis (Fig. 3, D and E), whereas in the VD-supplemented group, fibrosis and inflammation were highly improved compared with those in the normal-diet group (Fig. 3, D and E). In addition, tissue IHC staining and immunofluorescence staining revealed that the VD-deficient diet increased ECM deposition and fibroblast activation, whereas the VD-supplemented diet showed inhibitory effects (Fig. 3D). Furthermore, VD dietary intervention modulated the serum levels of VD and influenced the expression of the VDR in intestinal tissues (Fig. 3, F and G). The mRNA levels of α-SMA and fibronectin also indicated that the VD-deficient diet exacerbated DSS-induced fibrosis and chronic inflammation, whereas the VD4000U supplementary diet alleviated symptoms (Fig. 3H, Fig. S2C). Therefore, VD dietary intervention regulated the development of intestinal fibrosis by modulating the intestinal expression of the VDR. Intestinal fibrosis is characterized by abnormal tissue repair and the massive deposition of ECM proteins, which are produced by activated myofibroblasts (26Gordon I.O. Agrawal N. Goldblum J.R. Fiocchi C. Rieder F. Fibrosis in ulcerative colitis: Mechanisms, features, and consequences of a neglected problem.Inflamm. Bowel Dis. 2014; 20: 2198-2206Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). To investigate the effect of the VDR on the activation of fibroblasts, we purchased human colon fibroblasts (CCD-18Co cells) from the American Type Culture Collection and purified and cultured primary human intestinal fibroblasts. First, we used VD to activate VDR signaling and mimic the biological functions of VD (Fig. 4C; Fig. S3, A and B). We found an increase in the number of α-SMA–positive CCD-18Co cells after treatment with TGF-β1 for 48 h (Fig. 4A). The number of α-SMA–positive cells was decreased in the VD pretreatment group (Fig. 4A). At the transcriptional level, VD pretreatment significantly decreased α-SMA expression after CCD-18Co cells were activated with TGF-β1 (Fig. 4B). In primary human intestinal fibroblasts, VD dramatically decreased the expression of α-SMA and fibronectin, which were stimulated by TGF-β1 (Fig. 4C). Then, we used calcitriol to pharmacologically activate the VDR. In CCD-18Co cells, although calcitriol could slightly increase the expression of the VDR, fibronectin and CTGF were decreased by calcitriol treatment (Fig. S3C). Flow cytometric analysis showed that the fibroblast activation marker α-SMA was significantly decreased by calcitriol in the presence of TGF-β1 (Fig. 4D). In primary human intestinal fibroblasts, calcitriol significantly increased the expression of the VDR and dramatically decreased α-SMA and fibronectin expression in the presence of TGF-β1 stimulation (Fig. 4, E and F). Furthermore, VDR overexpression by Flag-tagged VDR plasmid transfection significantly increased VDR expression and alleviated α-SMA expression in CCD-18Co cells (Fig. 4G, Fig. S3D). In addition, VDR overexpression inhibited fibrosis markers induced by TGF-β1 stimulation in primary human intestinal fibroblasts, including α-SMA, fibronectin, CTGF, MMP-9, and TGF-β/Smad pathway factors (Fig. 4, H and I). Moreover, we identified the VDR exerted its effects in the presence of the VD ligand (Fig. S3E). Therefore, pharmacological stimulation of the VDR and overexpression of the VDR both inhibited the increase in fibrosis markers and fibroblast activation. These results indicated that the VDR gene had an inhibitory effect on fibroblast activation. A loss-of-function experiment was performed for further investigation. We found that siRNA-mediated knockdown of the VDR significantly exacerbated TGF-β1-induced fibroblast activation and ECM deposition in primary human intestinal fibroblasts (Fig. 4, J and K). Furthermore, TGF-β1 expression was increased in the VDR-knockdown group, combined with the upregulation of p-smad2 and p-smad3, suggesting activated TGF-β1–Smad signaling in VDR-deficient fibroblasts (Fig. 4K). Therefore, activated fibroblasts promoted intestinal fibrosis. Taken together, these findings indicated that knocking down the VDR exacerbated primary human intestinal fibroblast activation. As reported, the gut epithelial VDR inhibited colitis by protecting the mucosal epithelial barrier and maintaining mucosal integrity (19Liu W. Chen Y. Golan M.A. Annunziata M.L. Du J. Dougherty U.

Crohns Colitis. 2020; 14: 1103-1118Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar), although only a few studies illustrated the mechanism of this protective effect against colitis. Here, we found that VDR KO in the intestinal epithelium suppressed mucosal absorptive function in vivo (Fig. 5A). We isolated epithelial layers from both VDR-KO mice and control mice after repeated DSS administration. We found that the expression levels of E-cadherin, ZO-1, and β-catenin, the most representative markers of the epithelial barrier function, were significantly decreased in VDR-KO mice, especially after DSS administration (Fig. 5, B and C). Considering that the downregulation of epithelial markers is related to EMT, which is one of the main sources of mesenchymal fibroblasts, EMT was promoted in VDR-KO mice. In addition, the expression levels of epithelial markers, including E-cadherin, ZO-1, and β-catenin, were significantly decreased in mice with DSS-induced chronic intestinal fibrosis, whereas the expression levels of mesenchymal markers, including vimentin and Slug, were increased, indicating that EMT is a vital process in intestinal fibrosis (Fig. S4, A and B). Therefore, we further explored the relationship between intestinal epithelial VDR expression and EMT in fibrosis. We evaluated the effects of the VDR gene on the human intestinal epithelial tumor cell line HT29 by establishing a well-characterized model of TGF-β1-induced EMT (27Ortiz-Masia D. Salvador P.

Succinate activates EMT in intestinal epithelial cells through SUCNR1: A novel protagonist in fistula development.Cells. 2020; 9: 1104Crossref Scopus (19) Google Scholar). In HT29 cells, knockdown of VDR expression decreased epithelial integrity (Fig. 5D; Fig. S5A). When we activated EMT by administering TGF-β1 to HT29 cells, mesenchymal markers were dramatically elevated in the VDR-deficient group (Fig. 5E). In addition, VDR overexpression significantly alleviated the expression of Vimentin and Zeb1, while elevating the expression of epithelial markers such as E-cadherin, ZO-1, and claudin-1 (Fig. 5F; Fig. S5B). Similar results were observed after the pharmacological stimulation of the VDR (Fig. 5G; Fig. S5C). Taken together, these results indicated that the VDR could mediate epithelial integrity and inhibit intestinal fibrosis through modulating EMT. Mitochondrial morphological changes were analyzed by electron microscopy. We found that the intestinal epithelial cells in VDRIEC-KO mice exhibited mitochondrial swelling, vesicular formation, and villus disruption compared with those of VDRfl/fl mice (Fig. 6A). In addition, in the intestinal mesenchyme of VDRIEC-KO mice, the ECM greatly accumulated in the"

Here, the complete chloroplast (cp) genome of E . sativa was de novo assembled with a combination of long PacBio reads and short Illumina reads. The E . sativa cp genome had a quadripartite structure that was 153,522 bp in size, consisting of one large single-copy region of 83,320 bp and one small single-copy region of 17,786 bp which were separated by two inverted repeat (IRa and IRb) regions of 26,208 bp. This complete cp genome harbored 113 unique genes: 79 protein-coding genes, 30 tRNA genes, and four rRNA genes. Forty-nine long repetitive sequences and 69 simple sequence repeats were identified in the E . sativa cp genome. A codon usage analysis of the E . sativa cp genome showed a bias toward codons ending in A/T. The E . sativa cp genome was similar in size, gene composition, and linearity of the structural region when compared with other Brassicaceae cp genomes. Moreover, the analysis of the synonymous (Ks) and non-synonymous (Ka) substitution rates demonstrated that protein-coding genes generally underwent purifying selection pressure, expect ycf1 , ycf2 , and rps12 . A phylogenetic analysis determined that E . sativa is evolutionarily close to important Brassica species, indicating that it may be possible to transfer favorable E . sativa alleles into other Brassica species. Our results will be helpful to advance genetic improvement and breeding of E . sativa , and will provide valuable information for utilizing E . sativa as an important resource to improve other Brassica species."
https://openalex.org/W3134887023,"Abstract Tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) targeting BCR-ABL1 have revolutionized therapy for chronic myeloid leukemia (CML), paving the way for clinical development in other diseases. Despite success, targeting leukemic stem cells and overcoming drug resistance remain challenges for curative cancer therapy. To identify drivers of kinase-independent TKI resistance in CML, we performed genome-wide expression analyses on TKI-resistant versus sensitive CML cell lines, revealing a nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-κB) expression signature. Nucleocytoplasmic fractionation and luciferase reporter assays confirmed increased NF-κB activity in the nucleus of TKI-resistant versus sensitive CML cell lines and CD34 + patient samples. Two genes that were upregulated in TKI-resistant CML cells were proteasome 26S subunit, non-ATPases 1 ( PSMD1 ) and 3 ( PSMD3 ), both members of the 19S regulatory complex in the 26S proteasome. PSMD1 and PSMD3 were also identified as survival-critical genes in a published small hairpin RNA library screen of TKI resistance. We observed markedly higher levels of PSMD1 and PSMD3 mRNA in CML patients who had progressed to the blast phase compared with the chronic phase of the disease. Knockdown of PSMD1 or PSMD3 protein correlated with reduced survival and increased apoptosis in CML cells, but not in normal cord blood CD34 + progenitors. Luciferase reporter assays and immunoblot analyses demonstrated that PSMD1 and PSMD3 promote NF-κB protein expression in CML, and that signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) further activates NF-κB in scenarios of TKI resistance. Our data identify NF-κB as a transcriptional driver in TKI resistance, and implicate PSMD1 and PSMD3 as plausible therapeutic targets worthy of future investigation in CML and possibly other malignancies."

Multi-locus sequence typing (MLST) analysis identified 16 unique sequence types (STs) which belonged to eight clonal complexes (CCs). Majority of the isolates were variants of CC97 (68.7%) and CC151 (25.1%). CC97 comprised of seven STs, of which two were new STs (ST3273, ST3274), while CC151 comprised of three STs of which ST3272 was identified for the first time. Several farms had more than one ST type that were either members of the same clonal complex or unrelated STs. On one farm, six different STs of both categories were seen over the years within the farm. It was observed that ST352 and ST151 were the two main clonal populations in cattle not only in Pennsylvania but also globally. Most isolates were susceptible to all the antibiotics evaluated. 6.7% of isolates showed resistance to vancomycin and penicillin. Two isolates of ST398 showed multidrug resistance (&gt;3 antibiotics) against clindamycin, erythromycin, tetracycline, and penicillin. It was noted that 59 of 163 (36.2%) isolates encoded for enterotoxigenic genes. Enterotoxin genes seg/sei accounted for ~85% of enterotoxin positive isolates. Toxic shock syndrome gene tsst-1 alone was positive in two isolates (ST352, ST 2187). 97.5% of CC151 isolates were enterotoxin seg / sei positive. Most isolates were positive for lukED (95%) and lukAB (96.3%) leukotoxin genes. Bovine specific bi-component leucocidin lukMF’ was present in 54% of isolates. A prominent observation of this study was the explicit association of lukMF’ with lineages ST151 and ST352. In conclusion, the findings of the study, suggest that small number of S . aureus STs types (ST352, ST2187, ST3028, and ST151) are associated with majority of cases of bovine mastitis in Pennsylvania dairy farms. It was observed that one ST of S . aureus predominated in the herd and this ST can coexist with several other ST types of S . aureus strains. When STs were interpreted along with virulence, leucocidin genes and antimicrobial resistance, ST-variants allowed better interpretation of the S . aureus molecular epidemiologic findings specifically for tracing recurrence or persistence of infections in cow over time, among cows in the herd, and between herds in Pennsylvania."

Wu Z. Gerstner C.D. Frederick J.M. Zhang H. Baehr W. Arf-like protein 3 (ARL3) regulates protein trafficking and ciliogenesis in mouse photoreceptors.J. Biol. Chem. 2016; 291: 7142-7155Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Immunolabeling of dissociated rods similarly showed prominent IS signal for INPP5E and an additional nonuniform signal of the outer segment (OS) (23Rao K.N. Zhang W. Li L. Anand M. Khanna H.

Genet. 2016; 25: 4533-4545PubMed Google Scholar). In this study, we confirm that INPP5E localizes to the WT photoreceptor IS by multiple means. We also deleted INPP5E from the retina by mating Inpp5eF/F mice (12Dyson J.M. Conduit S.E. Feeney S.J. Hakim S. DiTommaso T. Fulcher A.J. Sriratana A. Ramm G. Horan K.A. Gurung R. Wicking C. Smyth I.

While P10 connecting cilia (CC) of P10 mutant rods are nearly normal in length, shortened ROS are devoid of recognizable discs. Intraflagellar transport (IFT)-A and IFT-B particles accumulate in the proximal retInpp5e−/− OS, suggesting defective IFT, a bidirectional transport system powered by molecular motors (24Scholey J.M. Kinesin-2 motors transport IFT-particles, dyneins and tubulin subunits to the tips of Caenorhabditis elegans sensory cilia: Relevance to vision research?.Vis. Res. 2012; 75: 44-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). Thus, deletion of INPP5E primarily impairs axoneme extension and disc morphogenesis of both rods and cones. INPP5E is a 72-kDa protein carrying a proline-rich domain in the N-terminal region, a large phosphatase active site encoded by exons 3 to 9, a coiled-coil domain, and a CAAX motif for C-terminal farnesylation (Fig. 1A). Mutations in human INPP5E associated with JBTS are located predominantly in the phosphatase domain. The mouse Inpp5e gene consists of 10 exons, producing two splice variants (Fig. 1B). The full-length variant is predicted to be farnesylated and membrane-anchored; the shorter variant lacking exon 10 and the CAAX box is predicted to be soluble. To generate retina-specific KO (retInpp5e−/−) mice, Inpp5eF/F mice were bred with Six3Cre mice (25Furuta Y. Lagutin O. Hogan B.L. Oliver G.C. Retina- and ventral forebrain-specific Cre recombinase activity in transgenic mice.Genesis. 2000; 26: 130-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). LoxP sites placed in introns 1 and 6 specify deletion of most of the phosphatase domain (Fig. 1C). LoxP, Six3Cre, and KO genotyping is shown (Fig. 1D). Immunoblotting with two independent antibodies against human INPP5E (Proteintech [PT]) and a mouse N-terminal fragment of INPP5E (custom-made at Covance, Inc. [CO]) confirmed the presence of two splice variants in WT retinal lysates and deletion of both isoforms in the conditional KO line (Fig. 1E). We recorded whole-field scotopic (dark-adapted) and photopic (light-adapted) electroretinography (ERGs) at P15 and P21 at light intensities ranging from −1.63 to 2.38 log cd s/m2 (Fig. 2, A and B). Scotopic a-waves (Fig. 2, C and F) and scotopic b-waves (Fig. 2, D and G) of KO mice were barely recordable at P15 and P21. Scotopic a-waves of heterozygous littermates displayed normal a-wave amplitudes at P21 (Fig. 2F), indistinguishable from the WT, suggesting haplosufficiency. Surprisingly, the P15 retInpp5e−/− photopic ERG b-wave amplitudes were still recordable (Fig. 2E), presumably due in part to a slower degeneration of cones in the peripheral retina. At P21, retInpp5e−/− photopic ERG b-wave amplitudes were much reduced (Fig. 2H). The b-wave amplitudes of heterozygous littermates were somewhat reduced relative to the WT, but the reduction was statistically insignificant. Plastic sections of retInpp5e−/− and littermate WT control retinas collected at P10, P15, and P21 (Fig. 3, A–F) confirmed rapid photoreceptor degeneration, revealed by a progressively shrinking outer nuclear layer (ONL). At P10, retInpp5e−/− retinas (Fig. 3D) showed only a slightly reduced ONL thickness compared with the WT (Fig. 3A), but the distance between the retinal pigmented epithelium and ONL was substantially reduced, suggesting attenuation of the IS and/or OS volume. At P15, nuclear tiers were reduced by ∼30% (Fig. 3E), and at P21, only one row of nuclei, presumably cones, was present (Fig. 3F), consistent with rapid rd1-like degeneration. Evaluation of the ONL thickness across the entire retina (Fig. 3, G–I) showed 40% reduction in the central retina at P15 and nearly complete obliteration of the central ONL at P21. Persisting ONL thickness of the retinal periphery (Fig. 3I) is consistent with lower Cre expression in the peripheral retina under the Six3 promoter (25Furuta Y. Lagutin O. Hogan B.L. Oliver G.C.

Frederick J.M. Baehr W. The guanine nucleotide exchange factor Arf-like protein 13b is essential for assembly of the mouse photoreceptor transition zone and outer segment.J. Biol. Chem. 2017; 292: 21442-21456Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). The retInpp5e−/− inner retina, including the inner nuclear and ganglion cell layers, was practically unaffected as judged by near-normal morphology of P10, P15, and P21 cryosections (Fig. 3, D and E). INPP5E immunolocalization was performed using the well-characterized (PT) antibody raised against a His-tagged fusion protein corresponding to the N-terminal half of human INPP5E. WT cryosections analyzed at P15 (Fig. 4A) and P21 (Fig. 4C) revealed the presence of INPP5E in the IS with traces in the ONL, and absence in the OS. The INPP5E signal of the contemporaneously labeled KO IS was significantly reduced at P15 (Fig. 4B) and undetectable at P21 (Fig. 4D). To verify specificity of the human antibody in mouse, we generated an independent antibody (CO) against the N-terminal peptide (MPSKSASLRHTEAC) of mouse INPP5E. As its sequence is distinct from the human homolog, the antibody is predicted to be mouse-specific. This antibody showed strong immunoreactivity in the entire IS, along the outer limiting membrane, with traces in the ONL (Fig. 4E); immunoreactivity was erased when the antibody was saturated with the antigenic peptide (Fig. 4F). Anti-INPP5E immunoreactivity was still detectable in KO sections at P15 with the PT antibody (Fig. 4B) and at P13 with the CO antibody (Fig. 4H), suggesting ineffective clearing of INPP5E or nonspecific binding. Differences in IS antigen localization using the PT antibody (fixed sections, Fig. 4A) and CO antibody (slightly fixed sections, Fig. 4E) are likely attributable to different fixation protocols (see Experimental procedures). To further verify the IS localization of INPP5E, we performed the technique of combined serial tangential retina sectioning and immunoblotting (27Sokolov M. Strissel K.J. Leskov I.B. Michaud N.A. Govardovskii V.I. Arshavsky V.Y. Phosducin facilitates light-driven transducin translocation in rod photoreceptors. Evidence from the phosducin knockout mouse.J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 19149-19156Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). A Western blot of proteins from serial sections cut through a WT rat retina starting from the photoreceptor tips was probed with antibodies against rhodopsin (OS marker) and INPP5E (Fig. 4, I and J). This analysis revealed the presence of a single INPP5E species in sections corresponding to the IS (the rat Inpp5e gene expresses no splice variants) and only trace protein amounts in the sections representing the OS. A rod photoreceptor cartoon (Fig. 4K) indicates the approximate positions of the ROS, CC, rod inner segment (RIS), nucleus, and synapse. The INPP5E localization was further confirmed in the retina of a macaque and macula of a 71-year-old human postmortem donor where INPP5E was detected in the IS of rods and cones (Fig. 4, L and M). In the perfusion-fixed macaque retina, INPP5E is prominent in the ellipsoid regions of the cone IS and RIS, respectively, with lesser amounts in perinuclear locales. Cone outer segment (COS) and ROS were mostly devoid of INPP5E. This pattern differs from INPP5E localization within the primary cilia where INPP5E is delivered with the aid of factors to achieve solubilization, PDEδ (PDE6D), and cargo displacement, ARL3–GTP (16Kosling S.K. Fansa E.K. Maffini S. Wittinghofer A. Mechanism and dynamics of INPP5E transport into and inside the ciliary compartment.Biol. Chem. 2018; 399: 277-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Dissociated mouse rods (23Rao K.N. Zhang W. Li L. Anand M. Khanna H. Prenylated retinal ciliopathy protein RPGR interacts with PDE6delta and regulates ciliary localization of Joubert syndrome-associated protein INPP5E.Hum. Mol. Genet. 2016; 25: 4533-4545PubMed Google Scholar) were probed with both PT and CO antibodies (Fig. 5, A–D). The OSs were identified by anti-CNGA1/3 (cyclic nucleotide-gated channel subunits) located in the OS cell membrane and the CC by anti-MAK (male germ cell–associated kinase) antibodies localizing to the CC (28Omori Y. Chaya T. Katoh K. Kajimura N. Sato S. Muraoka K. Ueno S. Koyasu T. Kondo M. Furukawa T. Negative regulation of ciliary length by ciliary male germ cell-associated kinase (Mak) is required for retinal photoreceptor survival.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2010; 107: 22671-22676Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). These results clearly showed the absence of INPP5E in the OS and its prominent presence in both the IS and CC. Another CC marker is centrin-2 (CETN2), a Ca2+-binding protein associated with the CC and basal body. To demonstrate localization of INPP5E at the CC in vivo, we perfused P10 Egfp-Cetn2+ retInpp5e+/− and retInpp5e−/− mice with 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA), postfixed overnight, generated 100-μm retina sections, performed antigen retrieval with 1% SDS, and analyzed the sections treated with anti-INPP5E antibody by confocal microscopy. The results show the presence of INPP5E specifically at the retInpp5e+/−CC (Fig. 5E) and the absence of INPP5E in retInpp5e−/− sections (Fig. 5F). The IS location of INPP5E was unchanged in cryosections obtained from Arl3−/− mice (22Hanke-Gogokhia C. Wu Z. Gerstner C.D. Frederick J.M. Zhang H. Baehr W. Arf-like protein 3 (ARL3) regulates protein trafficking and ciliogenesis in mouse photoreceptors.J. Biol. Chem. 2016; 291: 7142-7155Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar), suggesting that it is not delivered in a complex with the prenyl-binding protein PDEδ. We verified that cellular distribution of farnesylated INPP5E is not dependent on PDEδ by analyzing its localization patterns in Pde6d−/− photoreceptors (Fig. 6). The OS of the PDE6D+/- cones contain geranylgeranylated PDE6α’ (cone PDE6 α-subunit) (Fig. 6A) and farnesylated GRK1 (G-protein receptor kinase) (Fig. 6B) whose transport to COS is completely impaired in the absence of PDEδ. (Fig. 6, D and E). In contrast, the localization of farnesylated INPP5E was insensitive to the absence of PDEδ (Fig. 6, C and F). In the WT and mutant retina at P6, the OS begin to expand and rhodopsin is present in nascent WT OS and smaller mutant OS (Fig. 7, A and B; P8 panels). At P10, mutant OSs are shorter than the corresponding WT OSs (Fig. 7, A and B; P10 panel) and rhodopsin begins to mislocalize and its CC (labeled with EGFP–CETN2) are located closer to the ONL, suggesting a shrinking, degenerating IS. At P12, the WT OSs are maturing, but the mutant OSs are stunted and rhodopsin accumulates throughout the ONL (Fig. 7, A and B, P12 panels). As judged by Western blotting (Fig. 7C, left panel), the level of rhodopsin in mutant rods is slightly reduced at P6 and about half at P10 and P12 (Fig. 7C, right panel). Prenylated peripheral OS proteins (PDE6, GRK1) are thought to traffic the OS by diffusion, using PDEδ as a solubilization factor (29Baehr W.

At P8 (just after onset of degeneration), the level of OS PDE6 in retInpp5e−/− rods is comparable with the WT rods, but it is significantly reduced at P10 (Fig. 7E), consistent with the reduction of their OS size. These results suggest that endoplasmic reticulum docking, for post-translational modifications of PDE6, is not affected by INPP5E ablation. The COSs begin to form at P4 (33Fei Y.

https://openalex.org/W3133659861,"Despite many attempts to introduce evolutionary models that permit substitutions to instantly alter more than one nucleotide in a codon, the prevailing wisdom remains that such changes are rare and generally negligible or are reflective of non-biological artifacts, such as alignment errors. Codon models continue to posit that only single nucleotide change have non-zero rates. Here, we develop and test a simple hierarchy of codon-substitution models with non-zero evolutionary rates for only one-nucleotide (1H), one- and two-nucleotide (2H), or any (3H) codon substitutions. Using over 42, 000 empirical alignments, we find widespread statistical support for multiple hits: 61% of alignments prefer models with 2H allowed, and 23%—with 3H allowed. Analyses of simulated data suggest that these results are not likely to be due to simple artifacts such as model misspecification or alignment errors. Further modeling reveals that synonymous codon island jumping among codons encoding serine, especially along short branches, contributes significantly to this 3H signal. While serine codons were prominently involved in multiple-hit substitutions, there were other common exchanges contributing to better model fit. It appears that a small subset of sites in most alignments have unusual evolutionary dynamics not well explained by existing model formalisms, and that commonly estimated quantities, such as dN/dS ratios may be biased by model misspecification. Our findings highlight the need for continued evaluation of assumptions underlying workhorse evolutionary models and subsequent evolutionary inference techniques. We provide a software implementation for evolutionary biologists to assess the potential impact of extra base hits in their data in the HyPhy package and in the Datamonkey.org server."
https://openalex.org/W3135493314,"In biofilms, bacteria that possess a negatively charged surface are embedded within a matrix of polymers consisting mainly of negatively charged extracellular DNA (e-DNA). In all likelihood, a multivalent positively charged substance, for example, a basic protein, exists within biofilms to neutralize charge–charge repulsions and act as a ‘glue’ attaching negatively charged bacteria to negatively charged e-DNA; however, no protein capable of doing so has yet been identified. We decided to investigate whether a highly abundant nucleoid-associated histone-like protein (HU) happens to be the glue in question. In recent years, HU has been shown to possess qualities that could be considered desirable in the proposed glue, for example, (a) availability in association with e-DNA; (b) multivalent DNA binding; (c) non–sequence-specific DNA-binding; (d) enhancement of biofilm formation upon exogenous addition, and (e) disruption of biofilms, upon removal by HU–cognate antibodies. Geometric considerations suggest that basic residues in HU's canonical and noncanonical DNA-binding sites can interact with sugar-linked terminal phosphates in lipopolysaccharide (LPS) molecules in bacterial outer membranes. Here, using genetic, spectroscopic, biophysical–chemical, microscopy-based, and cytometry-based experiments, we demonstrate that HU's DNA-binding sites also bind to LPS, that this facilitates DNA–DNA, DNA–LPS, and LPS–LPS interactions, and that this facilitates bacterial clumping and attachment of bacteria to DNA. Exogenous addition of HU to bacteria in (nonshaken) cultures is shown to cause cells to become engulfed in a matrix of DNA, potentially arising from the lysis of bacteria with vulnerable cell walls (as they strain to grow, divide, and move away from each other, in opposition to the accreting influence of HUs).

Bacteria in biofilms are embedded within a matrix of extracellular polymeric substances, consisting mainly of extracellular DNA (e-DNA) released through cell lysis (1Thomas V.C. Thurlow L.R. Boyle D. Hancock L.E. Regulation of autolysis-dependent extracellular DNA release by Enterococcus faecalis extracellular proteases influences biofilm development.J. Bacteriol. 2008; 190: 5690-5698Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar), or cellular secretions (2Whitchurch C.B. Tolker-Nielsen T. Ragas P.C. Mattick J.S. Extracellular DNA required for bacterial biofilm formation.Science. 2002; 295: 1487Crossref PubMed Scopus (1532) Google Scholar). A conceptual problem with the embedment of bacteria in a matrix of DNA is that the surfaces of both bacteria and DNA naturally tend to be highly negatively charged because of the presence of phosphate groups in both DNA's phosphodiester backbone and the lipid A head groups of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) molecules on the outer membranes of gram-negative bacteria. In gram-positive bacteria, in place of LPSs, negatively charged lipoteichoic acid molecules are present upon bacterial surfaces. Therefore, regardless of the type of bacterium involved, DNA and bacteria are expected to repel one another, within biofilms (3Dengler V. Foulston L. DeFrancesco A.S. Losick R. An electrostatic net model for the role of extracellular DNA in biofilm formation by Staphylococcus aureus.J. Bacteriol. 2015; 197: 3779-3787Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). The fact that they coexist thus indicates the presence of some sort of a charge-neutralizing molecular glue that binds to both bacteria and DNA. In theory, any molecular glue capable of binding to both DNA and cells could be a protein that is decorated with positive charges on its surface (4Foulston L. Elsholz A.K. DeFrancesco A.S. Losick R. The extracellular matrix of Staphylococcus aureus biofilms comprises cytoplasmic proteins that associate with the cell surface in response to decreasing pH.mBio. 2014; 5 (e01667-01614)Crossref Scopus (125) Google Scholar). Also, in theory, such a protein could be any protein displaying some level of nonspecific binding to DNA and cells. However, an ideal molecular glue would be one that is capable of binding to both cells and DNA with reasonable specificity and comparable affinity. We begin this article by arguing that the ideal molecular glue in a biofilm would need to have the following sets of characteristics: (i) it would need to be a protein capable of binding to DNA both abundantly and ubiquitously, to ensure that e-DNA displays a uniformly charged, positively charged surface. Furthermore, (ii) the protein would need to be multivalent, multimeric, and present in the extracellular medium (either by itself or in association with e-DNA), to ensure its binding to both cells and e-DNA through multiple sites on its surface. Satisfaction of these two sets of criteria could allow a protein to bind to both cells and e-DNA in various modes, allowing the protein to act as a noncovalent cross-linker of cells and e-DNA. To the best of our understanding, from among all the DNA-binding proteins present in bacteria, the ideal candidate satisfying every one of the above requirements is the highly abundant nucleoid-associated histone-like protein (HU), for the following reasons: HU is a highly abundant, DNA-binding, histone-like, nucleoid-associated protein (NAP) of the DNABII class. HU has already been reported to be present in bacterial biofilms (5Devaraj A. Justice S.S. Bakaletz L.O. Goodman S.D. DNABII proteins play a central role in UPEC biofilm structure.Mol. Microbiol. 2015; 96: 1119-1135Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). HU has also been discovered to be limiting for biofilm formation, that is, anti-HU antibodies have been demonstrated to disrupt biofilms (6Novotny L.A. Jurcisek J.A. Goodman S.D. Bakaletz L.O.

HU is known to be ubiquitously present upon DNA, on account of its binding to DNA in a non–sequence-specific manner (7Kamashev D. Balandina A. Rouviere-Yaniv J. The binding motif recognized by HU on both nicked and cruciform DNA.EMBO J. 1999; 18: 5434-5444Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). HU is known to be one of the most abundant proteins present in bacteria, reaching levels of up to 50,000 dimers per cell during exponential growth (8Azam T.A. Ishihama A.

Chem. 1999; 274: 33105-33113Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (376) Google Scholar). HU is known to be released into the extracellular medium through multiple mechanisms, including lysis of dead cells (1Thomas V.C. Thurlow L.R. Boyle D. Hancock L.E.

Adv. 2016; 2e1600650Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar), both because HU dimers associate into higher oligomers and because each HU dimer within any HU oligomer itself hosts four motifs for DNA binding [including two (canonical) lysine/arginine-rich beta hairpins, and two (noncanonical) double-lysine clusters]. Thus, the protein, HU, fulfills every conceivable criterion for being the molecular glue that attaches cells to DNA and to other cells. Because HU is a known DNA-binding protein, it remains to be established (a) whether HU is capable of binding to LPS molecules, and to cells, and (b) whether HU is capable of causing agglomeration of LPS molecules, and of cells. In Escherichia coli, HU exists as two isoforms, HU-A and HU-B, which are both ∼90 amino acids long (16Tanaka H. Goshima N. Kohno K. Kano Y. Imamoto F.

In the late-log phase and stationary phase, it is believed that heterodimers of HU-A and HU-B exist in combination with DNA (18Claret L. Rouviere-Yaniv J. Variation in HU composition during growth of Escherichia coli: The heterodimer is required for long term survival.J. Mol. 1997; Biol273: 93-104Crossref Scopus (146) Google Scholar). In a previous article, we have described engineered forms of HU-A and HU-B, in which each protein has been genetically fused with a fluorescent protein at its N-terminus (19Arora K. Mangale S.S. Guptasarma P. Single cell-level detection and quantitation of leaky protein expression from any strongly regulated bacterial system.Anal. Biochem. 2015; 484: 180-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar). In that article, we had created chimeric forms of HU in which a monomeric red fluorescent protein (tag-RFP) was fused with HU-A (to make RFP–HU-A). Similarly, a monomeric yellow fluorescent protein (Venus) was fused with HU-B (to make Venus–HU-B). In the work described here, which explores the binding of HU to LPS and DNA, we have used both 6xHis-tagged and affinity-purified WT forms of HU-A and HU-B, without any fluorescent protein in fusion, and also with a fluorescence protein in fusion (i.e., RFP–HU-A and Venus–HU-B), as well as certain truncated, protein-engineered forms of HU, in addition to HU in which specific phenylalanine residues have been replaced by the fluorescent residue, tryptophan (Trp). In this article, using a combination of spectroscopic, microscopic, cytometric, and other investigations, we show that HU-A and HU-B, as well as variants of these isoforms of HU, bind to free LPS (f-LPS) and LPS on the outer membranes of bacterial cells (cell-displayed LPS [c-LPS]). We show that the binding of HU to f-LPS or c-LPS involves either, or both, of HU's canonical, or noncanonical, DNA-binding sites. We show that addition of micellar f-LPS to free HU (f-HU) generates large molecular assemblies of LPS. We also show that addition of f-HU to cells generates large cellular assemblies (or bacterial clumps). The charged head group present in the lipid A component of LPS contains two hexose-linked terminal phosphate moieties. Each of these bears at least one, and potentially two, positive charges (based on the pH of the environment and the degree of ionization). We propose that these phosphate moieties bind to the lysine/arginine residues positioned on (each of) f-HU's two types of DNA-binding sites, through charge–charge interactions and molecular recognition involving specific distance and geometry restraints. We demonstrate that LPS and DNA are able to compete with each other for binding to the HU. Thus, we propose that HU may have evolved to bind to both DNA and LPS. Our findings do not discount the possibility that other DNA-binding proteins might also prove to act as molecular glues in biofilms, in future studies. Figure 1A shows, in green color, the polypeptide backbone locations of the canonical DNA binding site(s) in HU that are present on each of the two chains of an HU dimer. The two sites, determined through X-ray crystallography (14Swinger K.K. Lemberg K.M. Zhang Y. Rice P.A. Flexible DNA bending in HU-DNA cocrystal structures.EMBO J. 2003; 22: 3749-3760Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar), are shown upon the structure of the Anabaena HU dimer. Figure 1A also shows the noncanonical DNA-binding site(s) that were identified later, using small-angle X-ray scattering studies of the structurally analogous E. coli HU (15Hammel M. Amlanjyoti D. Reyes F.E. Chen J.H. Parpana R. Tang H.Y. Larabell C.A. Tainer J.A. Adhya S. HU multimerization shift controls nucleoid compaction.Sci. Adv. 2016; 2e1600650Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). The reason that Figure 1A shows Anabaena HU instead of E. coli HU, for which the X-ray crystallographic structure is also known (20Guo F. Adhya S. Spiral structure of Escherichia coli HUalphabeta provides foundation for DNA supercoiling.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2007; 104: 4309-4314Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar), is that electron density data are currently only available for the canonical DNA-binding loops of Anabaena HU in the presence of DNA, and not for E. coli HU (presumably owing to mobility of these loops in the absence of DNA). Figure 1B shows the Anabaena HU structure in complex with a double-stranded 20-mer fragment of DNA (in blue) bound at the canonical DNA-binding site. Figure 1, A and B represent HU from the same viewing angle (view 1) and are derived from a crystal in which two dimers of Anabaena HU display crystallographic association; basically, each 20-mer (HU-bound) DNA fragment is also bound to a different HU dimer within the asymmetric unit, through the terminal regions of the DNA fragment. In the next few panels of Figure 1, we use these additional noncovalent interactions to schematically illustrate how HU can simultaneously also bind to DNA through HU's noncanonical DNA-binding sites. First, in Figure 1C, we show the HU dimer of Figure 1A from a different angle (view 2) rotated by 45 degrees in respect of view 1, along a vertical axis. Correspondingly, Figure 1D shows the DNA-bound view of the rotated HU dimer of Figure 1C. Figure 1, E and F display interactions of HU with DNA at the noncanonical site. Using view 2, in Figure 1E, a different (second) copy of the double-stranded 20-mer DNA present in the same asymmetric unit (bound to the canonical site of a different dimer) can be seen to be interacting with the noncanonical site of the dimer shown in Figure 1, A–D (in yellow). Finally, in Figure 1F, a complete view of both dimers in the asymmetric unit is shown, with each dimer associating with one copy of the 20-mer double-stranded DNA at its canonical site, and with a different copy of the 20-mer double-stranded DNA at its noncanonical site. In this figure, the second HU dimer is shown from a third view (view 3), which is different from view 1 and view 2. Figure 1, A–F could therefore be taken to be schematic diagrams, that is, diagrams that use real crystal structures, and known and determined interactions of Anabaena HU with DNA to illustrate how the analogous E. coli HU could also potentially simultaneously interact with DNA at both its canonical and noncanonical sites. Based on the above structural–biochemical perspectives, we decided to theoretically examine whether HU's DNA-binding sites could also potentially bind to negatively charged LPS molecules, either through HU's binding to LPS in the form of f-LPS that has been shed into the extracellular medium or to c-LPS that is still in association with bacterial outer membranes. We examined distances between negatively charged phosphate moieties in LPS and positively charged lysine/arginine residues present at the canonical and noncanonical DNA-binding sites. The head group of the lipid A component of LPS contains two hexose-linked phosphate moieties. There are two important differences between these moieties and the analogous sugar–phosphate moieties in DNA. First, the sugars in DNA/RNA are pentose sugars (deoxyribose or ribose), whereas those in the lipid A head group of LPS are hexose sugars (glucosamine). Second, the phosphate groups in the DNA backbone contain only one negative charge per phosphate because of the participation of the phosphate in the formation of phosphodiester bonds; in contrast, in the head group of lipid A, both phosphates are terminal phosphates and, therefore, could potentially possess two negatively charged oxygen atoms each, based upon the pH of the environment. The anticipated pKa values of the two OH groups in a terminal phosphate moiety are 2.2 and 7.2. At a neutral pH, of course, only one of these (the one with a pKa of 2.2) would be expected to carry a charge. However, at higher values of pH, some molecules could potentially host two negative charges, that is, the lipid A head group could exist as either H2PO4−, with a single negative charge, or as HPO42−, with two negative charges, in environments in which the pH is unregulated and higher than 7.2. For example, it is quite well known that the pH of LB medium is routinely around 9.0, and also that further alkalization may occur in the absence of glucose, because consumption of glucose leads to the acidification of the medium. Therefore, it may thus be conjectured that at a pH of 9.0, phosphates in the lipid A group of LPS would host either two charges or at least a partial additional charge on the OH group with a pKa of 7.2. Even in PBS, with a pH of 7.4, the possibility of the existence of two charges on terminal phosphates remains. Therefore, the distinction between the terminal phosphates of the lipid A group of LPS, and the phosphates of the DNA backbone, could very well be significant. Notably, the phosphates on the lipid A group of LPS are already known to bind to poly-L-lysine through electrostatic interactions (21Hyldgaard M. Mygind T. Vad B.S. Stenvang M. Otzen D.E. Meyer R.L. The antimicrobial mechanism of action of epsilon-poly-l-lysine.Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 2014; 80: 7758-7770Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). Based on similar interactions, Figure 1, G and H schematically show how these phosphates could also potentially bind to lysine/arginine groups present at the DNA-binding sites of HU, using the structures of the polypeptide backbones for segments of the canonical (Fig. 1G) and noncanonical (Fig. 1H) DNA-binding sites of Anabaena HU. In these figures, the side chains of the relevant lysine and arginine residues have been shown in green (stick model). The backbones of the HU segmental structures have been shown juxtaposed against the known crystal structure of the head group of lipid A, sourced from the crystal structure of an antibody bound to the same head group (22Haji-Ghassemi O. Muller-Loennies S. Rodriguez T. Brade L. Grimmecke H.D. Brade H. Evans S.V. The combining sites of anti-lipid A antibodies Reveal a widely Utilized motif specific for negatively charged groups.J. Biol. Chem. 2016; 291: 10104-10118Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). Figure 1G shows how the two phosphate groups in the lipid A component of LPS (one each at the two ends of the head-group) can potentially bind to either one or even two different positively charged, ε-amino groups (separated by 12.7 Å) located on arginine residues, R58 and R61, in HU's canonical DNA-binding site. The two arginine residues, R58 and R61, are conserved between Anabaena and E. coli HU, and also in the HU from most other bacteria (23Grove A. Functional evolution of bacterial histone-like HU proteins.Curr. Issues Mol. Biol. 2011; 13: 1-12PubMed Google Scholar). Figure 1H shows how two negative charges present on the terminal phosphate group present at any end of the head group of lipid A could potentially bind to one or even two ε-amino groups (separated by 3.1 Å) located on two lysine residues, K83 and K86, on the same face of a helix in HU's noncanonical DNA-binding site. Together, Figure 1, G and H, therefore, suggest that a theoretical case exists for LPS to bind to HU, not merely through nonspecific electrostatic interactions but potentially through specific interactions between phosphate groups and lysine/arginine side chains. The distance restraints considered also indicate some degree of molecular recognition between LPS HU. Below, we describe six different kinds of biophysical–chemical experiments, which demonstrate that the purified recombinant HU and/or recombinant RFP–HU-A bind to E. coli–derived f-LPS. Figure 2, A and B show a titration of RFP–HU-A against varying concentrations of micellar and nonmicellar f-LPS, ranging from 2.5 mg/ml to 0.038 μg/ml, spanning the critical micellar concentration (CMC) of LPS which is ∼10 μg/ml. This was performed to examine whether the rate of diffusion of RFP–HU-A is altered because of binding of f-LPS to HU-A and also whether there is any difference in the behavior noticed between pre-CMC and post-CMC concentrations of f-LPS. The diffusion of RFP–HU-A either involves motion of molecules away from or back toward a region of ‘temperature jump–induced’ molecular depletion within a set of capillaries containing identical HU and differing LPS concentrations. The MST experiment monitors the dose dependence of the rate of reduction of fluorescence (through diffusion-aided depletion), as well as the rate of increase of fluorescence (through diffusion-aided replenishment, after restoration of the temperature) of the RFP fluorescence signal. The experiment demonstrates that the diffusion of RFP–HU-A, both away from a region of temperature jump–induced depletion of molecules and back toward the same region, tends to be progressively slower for higher concentrations of f-LPS. This indicates that RFP–HU binds to micellar f-LPS. The data also show no discontinuity at the 10 μg/ml boundary concentration, between pre-CMC and post-CMC concentrations of f-LPS, suggesting that the lipid A moiety in f-LPS remains equally accessible for binding of HU in nonmicellar and micellar forms of f-LPS (where the micellar form is a simulacrum for cell-surface LPS). The estimated binding constant from these studies would appear to be ∼34 μM, if one assumes binding of one LPS ligand molecule per HU chain monomer, with an average molecular weight of 15,000 Da for f-LPS. Of course, both of these assumptions do not hold because (i) all f-LPS molecules do not have the exact same molecular weight, (ii) the LPS concentrations used are in the post-CMC range, and (iii) the HU population consists of multiple quaternary structural forms, and not HU monomers. Therefore, the value of ∼34 μM must only be taken to be indicative of the low-affinity nature of the binding of HU to LPS and not as an accurate measure. Figure 2C shows sensor grams for binding of 6xHis affinity-tagged HU-B onto a Nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid (Ni-NTA) derivatized probe and for binding of f-LPS to this Ni-NTA–bound 6xHis-tagged HU-B [similar to sensor grams obtained in surface plasmon resonance experiments but detected here using a different and analogous technique called biolayer interferometry (BLI)]. An association of the histidine-tagged HU-B with the Ni-NTA–derivatized probe tip is observed and so is a subsequent association of micellar f-LPS with the tip-bound HU-B. The micellar f-LPS is observed to cause the LPS-HU association curve to descend even during the association phase, presumably because of distortions caused by progressively greater binding of micellar f-LPS which could cause the bound molecular masses to shift away from the probe tip's surface, or even cause some leaching. However, this effect seen during association is quite small in comparison with the dissociation response that results from dissociation of f-LPS and HU, following depletion of f-LPS from the solution. This indicates that HU-B binds to f-LPS. Figure 2D shows ‘instrument-zeroed’ absorption profiles of premixing (black) and postmixing (red) states for an experiment in which equal volumes of RFP–HU-A and f-LPS were mixed. In this experiment, RFP–HU-A and micellar f-LPS are initially present in separate compartments of a split-quartz (tandem-compartment) cuvette with a separating wall rising to two-thirds of the cuvette's height, allowing light to pass through both compartments in the control experiment, and also mixing of the contents of the two compartments to be effected through inversion of the cuvette (after closing of the lid), for the subsequent experiment examining interaction between the constituents of the two compartments. Mixing of equal volumes of potentially interacting species, followed by refilling of both compartments through ‘uprighting’ of the cuvette, results in the halving of concentrations of the species in each compartment, and the doubling of the path length of light passing through solutions of RFP–HU-A and f-LPS (because both species fall back into both compartments, after the mixing of the contents of the two compartments through uprighting of the cuvette). A difference in absorbance of light passing through both compartments is anticipated if, and only if, there are interactions between the species originally present in the two compartments, after mixing. This interaction manifests as a deviation(s) from the zero baseline because of alterations of the electronic states of chromophores adjacent to interacting surfaces due to the intermolecular interactions. If there are no interactions, no difference in absorbance is expected on account of the Beer–Lambert law, as it applies to a difference absorption spectroscopy (DAS) experiment because there is a halving of concentrations and a doubling of path lengths (24Kumar S.

https://openalex.org/W3134073755,"Introduction People living in the same area share similar determinants of infant mortality, such as access to healthcare. The community’s prevailing norms and attitudes about health behaviours could also influence the health care decisions made by individuals. In diversified communities like Ethiopia, differences in child health outcomes might not be due to variation in individual and family characteristics alone, but also due to differences in the socioeconomic characteristics of the community where the child lives. While individual level characteristics have been examined to some extent, almost all studies into infant mortality conducted in Ethiopia have failed to consider the impact of community-level characteristics. Therefore, this study aims to identify individual and community level determinants of infant mortality in Ethiopia. Method Data from the Ethiopian Demographic and Health Survey in 2016 were used for this study. A total of 10641 live births were included in this analysis. A multi-level logistic regression analysis was used to examine both individual and community level determinants while accounting for the hierarchal structure of the data. Results Individual-level characteristics such as infant sex have a statistically significant association with infant mortality. The odds of infant death before one year was 50% higher for males than females (AOR = 1.66; 95% CI: 1.25–2.20; p-value &lt;0.001). At the community level, infants from pastoralist areas (Somali and Afar regions) were 1.4 more likely die compared with infants living in the Agrarian area such as Amhara, Tigray, and Oromia regions; AOR = 1.44; 95% CI; 1.02–2.06; p-value = 0.039). Conclusion Individual, household and community level characteristics have a statistically significant association with infant mortality. In addition to the individual based interventions already in place, household and community-based interventions such as focusing on socially and economically disadvantaged regions in Ethiopia could help to reduce infant mortality."
https://openalex.org/W3133667901,"We studied the prevalence of extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL)-producing Enterobacteriaceae in dairy calves as part of a routine health check protocol. In addition, data regarding antimicrobial use (AMU), farm hygiene, and farm management were collected in order to identify possible risks for ESBL occurrence. Ten farms participated in the study with a median of 781 milking cows (319–1701). All calves investigated were younger than two weeks with an average age of 6.8 (±3.9) days. The farms were visited and samples were collected twice at an interval of 7–11 months. Faecal samples diluted 1:10, were plated onto Brilliance TM ESBL agar in duplicates. After 24 hours at 37°C, colonies were counted and total colony forming units (cfu)/ml calculated. Bacteria species were identified biochemically. ESBL-production was phenotypically confirmed using the MICRONAUT-S β-Lactamases system. Additionally, antimicrobial susceptibility was tested using VITEK ® 2 technology. Phylotyping of E . coli isolates and screening for bla genes was performed by PCR. ESBL-producing enterobacteria were detected on all farms and 96.5% of calves investigated shed ESBL-positive bacteria. Of all ESBL-producing isolates, the majority were E . coli (92.9%), followed by Enterobacter cloacae (5.1%) and Klebsiella pneumoniae subsp. pneumoniae (2.0%). The majority of E . coli isolates was clearly assigned to phylogroup C (25.0%), followed by phylogroups A (15.2%) and E (14.1%). CTX-M group 1 was most frequently detected (80.4%). E . cloacae contained bla CTX-M and bla TEM or bla SHV . K . pneumoniae harboured bla SHV only. Besides resistance to penicillins and cephalosporins, the majority of isolates was also resistant to one or more antibiotic classes, with a high proportion being resistant against fluoroqinolones. 52.5% of isolates were further characterised as threefold multidrug resistant gram-negative bacteria (3MDR-GNB) according to the German Commission for Hospital Hygiene and Infection Prevention. None of the isolates were 4MDR-GNB, i.e. none revealed carbapenem-resistance. Penicillins were the most frequently administered antibiotics to calves on most farms and were the predominant substance class at herd level on all farms. Overall, the number of calves treated prior to sampling was rather low (11.7%). Analyses of data regarding the farm management identified weaknesses in biosecurity and cleaning and disinfection. Besides beta-lactam antibiotics being the most commonly used antibiotics no other risk factors could be identified. In summary, the prevalence of ESBL-carriers in dairy calves was exceptionally high and should be motivation to develop strategies for the reduction of multidrug-resistant bacteria in farm animals."

Our aim was to investigate the relationship between the prevalence of H . pylori and inflammatory bowel disease. Methods Hospitalized IBD patients including Crohn’s disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC) who had tested H . pylori antibody were enrolled. Controls were chose from age- and sex- matched healthy physical examination people who had H . pylori antibody test in a 1:2 fashion (IBD patients:controls). IBD medical history was recorded. All patients were typed by the Montreal classification. Mayo Clinic score and the Harvey-Bradshaw Severity Index were used to evaluate their disease activity.

https://openalex.org/W3134151693,"Sexual selection researchers have traditionally focused on adult sex differences; however, the schedule and pattern of sex-specific ontogeny can provide insights unobtainable from an exclusive focus on adults. Recently, it has been debated whether facial width-to-height ratio (fWHR; bi-zygomatic breadth divided by midface height) is a human secondary sexual characteristic (SSC). Here, we review current evidence, then address this debate using ontogenetic evidence, which has been under-explored in fWHR research. Facial measurements were collected from 3D surface images of males and females aged 3 to 40 (Study 1; US European-descent, n = 2449), and from 2D photographs of males and females aged 7 to 21 (Study 2; Bolivian Tsimane, n = 179), which were used to calculate three fWHR variants (which we call fWHRnasion, fWHRstomion, and fWHRbrow) and two other common facial masculinity ratios (facial width-to-lower-face-height ratio, fWHRlower, and cheekbone prominence). We test whether the observed pattern of facial development exhibits patterns indicative of SSCs, i.e., differential adolescent growth in either male or female facial morphology leading to an adult sex difference. Results showed that only fWHRlower exhibited both adult sex differences as well as the classic pattern of ontogeny for SSCs-greater lower-face growth in male adolescents relative to females. fWHRbrow was significantly wider among both pre- and post-pubertal males in the Bolivian Tsimane sample; post-hoc analyses revealed that the effect was driven by large sex differences in brow height, with females having higher placed brows than males across ages. In both samples, all fWHR measures were inversely associated with age; that is, human facial growth is characterized by greater relative elongation in the mid-face and lower face relative to facial width. This trend continues even into middle adulthood. BMI was also a positive predictor of most of the ratios across ages, with greater BMI associated with wider faces. Researchers collecting data on fWHR should target fWHRlower and fWHRbrow and should control for both age and BMI. Researchers should also compare ratio approaches with multivariate techniques, such as geometric morphometrics, to examine whether the latter have greater utility for understanding the evolution of facial sexual dimorphism."
https://openalex.org/W3135244997,"This study examines the sustainable transport policy framework in the case of railway development in Klang Valley, Malaysia. It is guided by the main principle that sustainable transport policy is a result of the integration of broad policy instruments that range from infrastructure provision and management, technological improvements, regulation, information, awareness, education, and pricing and taxation. Although this study is mainly qualitative, performance data available at the ASEAN Statistics Division, World Bank Open Data and Global Competitiveness Reports. This is followed by in-person interviews with experts who have vast knowledge, experience, and direct participation in sustainable railway development in Malaysia, especially those related to the Klang Valley development. The main findings have indicated that the current framework in Malaysia meets the criteria of sustainable development policy framework, which are essentially constituted within environmental protection. It also constitutes the pursuance of long-term growth in terms of economic and societal needs. Nonetheless, the rail-based transit system in Malaysia is highly driven by the Government and there is no clear sign indicating that the public is shifting from the road and private transport to rail-based services."
https://openalex.org/W3135257933,"Introduction Determinants of the magnitude of abortion among women of diverse social and economic status, particularly in Africa poorly understood because of the missing information in most countries. In this study, we addressed abortion and its determinants among youth women of 15–24 ages to provide clear direction for policymaking in Ethiopia. Methods We examined the 2016 Ethiopian demographic health survey data downloaded from the EDHS website after obtaining permission on abortion among 15–24 age women. We applied bivariate and multilevel binary logistic regression. Community and Individual level abortion predictors passed through a three-level binary logistic regression analysis where we used p-value &lt;0.05 and adjusted odds ratios (AOR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI). Result The abortion among the youth population in this study was 2.5%. Factors associated with pregnancy were age group 20–24 2.5(1.6–3.8), youth with one birth 0.65(0.44–0.96), youth with 2–5 births 0.31(0.18–0.55), age ≥18 0.50(0.33–0.76), married 38(17–84), divorced 20(7–55), birth in the last five years 0.65(0.44–0.96), middle wealth youth 1.7(1.0.4–2.8), being in Amhara0.31(0.11–0.85), and 0.30(0.12–0.77). Conclusion Less abortion occurred in economically poor youths. It is a noble finding; however, the access problem might lead to the result. We observed more abortions in age &lt;18years; those have not given birth until the data collection date. It portrays forth clear policy direction for politicians and all other stakeholders to intervene in the problem. The analysis also showed abortion increased with age. It shows that as age increased, youths disclose abortion which is rare at an early age, and again given an essential clue for the next interventions. The fact in this study is both age and marriage affected abortion similarly. It might be because of various culture-related perceptions where it is not appropriate for an unmarried woman to appear with any pregnancy outcome as the reason behind the decreased number of abortions at a younger age. Thus, more attention is required during implementation for unmarried and lower age youth regardless of the magnitude of the abortion."
https://openalex.org/W3134897765,"Objectives Systemic rheumatic disease is characterized by autoimmunity and systemic inflammation and affects multiple organs. Few studies have investigated whether autoimmune diseases increase the risk of dementia. Herein, we evaluate the relationship between systemic rheumatic disease and dementia through a population-based study using the Korean National Health Insurance Service (NHIS) claims database. Methods We conducted a nationwide population-based study using the Korean NHIS database, consisting of individuals who submitted medical claims from 2002–2013. Dementia was defined as having an acetylcholinesterase inhibitors (AChEIs) prescription along with symptoms satisfying the Alzhemier’s disease (AD) International Classification of Diseases (ICD)-10 codes (F00 or G30), or vascular dementia (VaD; ICD-10 or F01) criteria. Control subjects were matched to the dementia patients by age and sex. The study group was limited to those diagnosed with rheumatic disease at least 6 months prior to diagnosis of dementia. Rheumatic disease was defined by the following ICD-10 codes: Rheumatoid arthritis (RA: M05), Sjögren’s syndrome (SS: M35), systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE: M32), and Behcet’s disease (BD: M35.2). Results Of the 6,028 dementia patients, 261 (4.3%) had RA, 108 (1.6%) had SS, 12 (0.2%) had SLE, and 6 (0.1%) had BD. SLE history was significantly higher in dementia patients (0.2%) than in controls (0.1%) and was associated with dementia (odds ratio [OR], 2.48; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.19–5.15). In subgroup analysis, SLE significantly increased dementia risk, regardless of dementia type (AD: OR, 2.29; 95% CI, 1.06–4.91; VaD: OR, 4.54; 95% CI, 1.36–15.14). However, these associations were not sustained in the mild CCI or elderly group. Conclusion SLE was independently associated with a higher risk of dementia, including AD and VaD when compared to the control group, even after adjustment. SLE patients (&lt;65 years old) are a high-risk group for early vascular dementia and require screening for early detection and active prevention."
https://openalex.org/W3135449219,"We study the health trajectories of the population aged over 60, comparing between one European and two Latin American countries (Spain, Chile and Costa Rica) which have similar longevity patterns. Our focus is on functional limitation and mortality risks, considering differences by gender, education and social participation. Data come from national panel surveys (EPS, CRELES, SHARE). Multistate modelling is used to estimate transition probabilities between two health states: healthy to unhealthy, unhealthy to healthy as well as the transition to death from healthy or unhealthy states, to estimate the duration of stay in a specific state (computing healthy and unhealthy life expectancies) and the effect of the selected covariates. Results show that older Costa Ricans have the smallest gender gap in life expectancy but women have a lower healthy life expectancy compared to those in Chile and Spain. Participation in social activities leads to higher healthy life expectancy among the elderly in Costa Rica and Spain, whilst there were no relevant educational differences observed in longevity in the analysed countries. To conclude: despite the different patterns observed in health transitions and survival across the three countries, social participation is associated with greater health and longevity among people of old age, with little effect coming from educational attainment. Public policies should therefore be aimed at reducing unhealthy life years and dependency at advanced ages by promoting more engagement in social activities, especially among vulnerable groups who are more likely to experience impairment from a younger age."
https://openalex.org/W3135227554,"The insulin receptor (IR), insulin-like growth factor 1 receptor (IGF-1R), and insulin receptor-related receptor (IRR) form a mini family of predimerized receptor-like tyrosine kinases. IR and IGF-1R bind to their peptide agonists triggering metabolic and cell growth responses. In contrast, IRR, despite sharing with them a strong sequence homology, has no peptide-like agonist but can be activated by mildly alkaline media. The spatial structure and activation mechanisms of IRR have not been established yet. The present work represents the first account of a structural analysis of a predimerized receptor-like tyrosine kinase by high-resolution atomic force microscopy in their basal and activated forms. Our data suggest that in neutral media, inactive IRR has two conformations, where one is symmetrical and highly similar to the inactive Λ/U-shape of IR and IGF-1R ectodomains, whereas the second is drop-like and asymmetrical resembling the IRR ectodomain in solution. We did not observe complexes of IRR intracellular catalytic domains of the inactive receptor forms. At pH 9.0, we detected two presumably active IRR conformations, Γ-shaped and T-shaped. Both of conformations demonstrated formation of the complex of their intracellular catalytic domains responsible for autophosphorylation. The existence of two active IRR forms correlates well with the previously described positive cooperativity of the IRR activation. In conclusion, our data provide structural insights into the molecular mechanisms of alkali-induced IRR activation under mild native conditions that could be valuable for interpretation of results of IR and IGF-IR structural studies."

The anti-asthmatic effects were analyzed by measuring the mechanical lung and morphometrical parameters in female Swiss mice allocated in the following groups: untreated control (Ctl+Sal) and control treated with FOR811A (Ctl+FOR), along asthmatic groups untreated (Ast+Sal) and treated with FOR811A (Ast+FOR). The drug-protein interaction was evaluated by in-silico assay using molecular docking. The results showed that the use of FOR811A in experimental asthma (Ast+FOR) decreased the pressure-volume curve, hysteresis, tissue elastance, tissue resistance, and airway resistance, similar to the control groups (Ctl+Sal; Ctl+FOR). However, it differed from the untreated asthmatic group (Ast+Sal, p &lt;0.05), indicating that FOR811A corrected the lung parenchyma and relaxed the smooth muscles of the bronchi. Similar to control groups (Ctl+Sal; Ctl+FOR), FOR811A increased the inspiratory capacity and static compliance in asthmatic animals (Ast+Sal, p &lt;0.05), showing that this metallodrug improved the capacity of inspiration during asthma. The morphometric parameters showed that FOR811A decreased the alveolar collapse and kept the bronchoconstriction during asthma. Beyond that, the molecular docking using FOR811A showed a strong interaction in the distal portion of the heme group of the soluble guanylate cyclase, particularly with cysteine residue (Cys141). In summary, FOR811A relaxed bronchial smooth muscles and improved respiratory mechanics during asthma, providing a protective effect and promising use for the development of an anti-asthmatic drug."

During leaf senescence, large amounts of phytol are released by chlorophyll degradation. However, the pathway of phytol catabolism in plants is unknown. We hypothesized that phytol degradation in plants might involve its oxidation into the long-chain aldehyde phytenal. Using GC-MS for aldehyde quantification after derivatization with methylhydroxylamine, phytenal was identified in leaves, whereas other long-chain aldehydes (phytanal and pristanal) were barely detectable.

The tail of chlorophyll: Fates for phytolJournal of Biological ChemistryVol. 296PreviewUnderstanding the pathways involved in chlorophyll breakdown provides a molecular map to the color changes observed in plant life on a global scale each fall. Surprisingly, little is known about the fate of phytol, chlorophyll’s 20-carbon branched-chain tail, during this process. A recent study from Gutbrod et al. provides evidence using physiological, genetic, and exquisitely sensitive analytical approaches that phytenal is an intermediate in plant phytol catabolism. These insights and techniques open the door to further investigation of this complicated metabolic system, with implications for plant health and agriculture. Full-Text PDF Open Access Chlorophyll is the most important photosynthetic pigment in plants, and it is crucial for light harvesting and channeling of photons to the reaction centers of photosystems I and II. Chlorophyll is subject to constant turnover, and chlorophyll degradation is stimulated during stress or senescence (1Hörtensteiner S. Kräutler B. Chlorophyll breakdown in higher plants.Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2011; 1807: 977-988Crossref PubMed Scopus (537) Google Scholar). The degradation of chlorophyll by enzymes of chlorophyll catabolism is important as some chlorophyll catabolites can produce radicals after illumination, which are highly toxic to the cell (1Hörtensteiner S. Kräutler B. Chlorophyll breakdown in higher plants.Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2011; 1807: 977-988Crossref PubMed Scopus (537) Google Scholar). The chlorophyll molecule is composed of the chlorophyllide head group derived from the porphyrin biosynthetic pathway and the phytyl side chain from the isoprenoid pathway. The phytyl chain is linked in an ester bond to the carboxylate group of the chlorophyllide, and it can be hydrolyzed by pheophytin pheophorbide hydrolase or chlorophyll dephytylase 1 during chlorophyll breakdown (2Schelbert S. Aubry S. Burla B. Agne B. Kessler F. Krupinska K. Hörtensteiner S.

Phytol serves as a precursor for the synthesis of different chloroplast lipids. It can be converted into fatty acid phytyl esters (FAPEs), which accumulate in the plastoglobules of chloroplasts during stress (4Ischebeck T. Zbierzak A.M. Kanwischer M. Dörmann P.

Two acyltransferases, PES1 and PES2, are involved in transferring activated fatty acids onto free phytol, thereby producing FAPEs in Arabidopsis (6Lippold F. vom Dorp K. Abraham M. Hölzl G. Wewer V.

Alternatively, free phytol can be phosphorylated by phytol kinase (VTE5) yielding phytyl phosphate, which can be further phosphorylated to phytyl diphosphate (phytyl-PP) by VTE6 (7Valentin H.E.

Phytyl-PP is the substrate for the synthesis of tocopherol (vitamin E) and phylloquinone (vitamin K1) (9Collakova E. DellaPenna D.

Because phytyl-PP derived from phytol phosphorylation is the main source for tocopherol synthesis, the vte5 and vte6 mutants of Arabidopsis are tocopherol deficient. The pathway of phytol degradation in plants is largely unknown. In humans, phytol taken up from the diet is converted into phytenal and phytanoyl-CoA, which is degraded via α- and β-oxidation including the synthesis of the intermediate pristanal, another C19 isoprenoid aldehyde (Fig. 1) (11Wanders R.J.A. Komen J. Ferdinandusse S. Phytanic acid metabolism in health and disease.Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2011; 1811: 498-507Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Phytanoyl-CoA has been detected in Arabidopsis, suggesting that a pathway similar to the human pathway might also exist in plants (12Ishizaki K. Larson T.R. Schauer N. Fernie A.R. Graham I.A.

In addition, phytenal was tentatively identified in senescent oat leaves (14Rontani J.-F. Cuny P. Grossi V. Photodegradation of chlorophyll phytyl chain in senescent leaves of higher plants.Phytochemistry. 1996; 42: 347-351Crossref Scopus (43) Google Scholar). The conversion of phytol into phytenal was suggested to be mediated via photooxidation (14Rontani J.-F. Cuny P. Grossi V. Photodegradation of chlorophyll phytyl chain in senescent leaves of higher plants.Phytochemistry. 1996; 42: 347-351Crossref Scopus (43) Google Scholar). The analysis of the phytol degradation pathway is hampered by the fact that phytol catabolites are extremely low abundant and highly unstable. The analysis of long-chain aldehydes such as phytenal, phytanal, and pristanal is challenging because they are prone to oxidation during extraction (14Rontani J.-F. Cuny P. Grossi V. Photodegradation of chlorophyll phytyl chain in senescent leaves of higher plants.Phytochemistry. 1996; 42: 347-351Crossref Scopus (43) Google Scholar). To study phytol metabolism in plants, highly sensitive methods for quantification of phytenal and other long chain aldehydes based on GC-MS and LC-MS were used. Analysis of leaves form Arabidopsis plants revealed that phytenal can be detected and represents the most abundant long-chain aldehyde. Other long-chain aldehydes, including phytanal and pristanal, are barely detectable in leaves. The measurements of phytenal in WT and mutant plants of Arabidopsis grown under control and abiotic stress conditions indicated that phytenal represents an authentic intermediate of phytol catabolism. Aldehyde measurements in plants are complicated by the fact that they are highly reactive and prone to oxidation. Derivatization can protect the functional group of aldehydes, thereby increasing the recovery from plant tissues. We selected methoxylamine as the derivatization reagent because it efficiently converts aldehydes into methyloximes. Methyloximes of long-chain aldehydes are volatile and can be analyzed by GC-MS (15Verhoeven N.M. Schor D.S. ten Brink H.J. Wanders R.J. Jakobs C. Resolution of the phytanic acid α-oxidation pathway: Identification of pristanal as product of the decarboxylation of 2-hydroxyphytanoyl-CoA.Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 237: 33-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). The analysis of standards of hexadecanal and phytenal revealed two peaks for hexadecanal, and four peaks for phytenal (Fig. 2). The mass spectra of the two hexadecanal peaks were almost identical and showed the molecular ion peak of hexadecanal–methyloxime of 323.3 and an M-31 fragment corresponding to the loss of the methoxy group. It is known that aldehyde–methyloximes form two stereoisomers (E/Z) that differ by the configuration of the methoxy group, which is closer (Z) or further away (E) from the hydrocarbon chain (Fig. 2) (16Sakamoto T. Okamoto K. Kikugawa Y. Determination of configurations of N-methoxyimidoyl halides via catalytic hydrogenation. Synthesis of pure (E)-aldoximes.J. Org. Chem. 1992; 57: 3245-3248Crossref Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Four peaks were identified in the GC-MS chromatogram for phytenal, all showing the same spectrum with the molecular ion peak of 292.3 m/z and an M-31 fragment. The occurrence of four phytenal–methyloxime peaks can be explained by the fact that the phytenal standard represents a mixture of cis-/trans-isomers, derived from the synthetic phytol used for its synthesis, and each of the two isomers gives rise to E/Z methoxy diastereomers after derivatization (Fig. 2). Next, a crude lipid extract from green leaves of Arabidopsis was derivatized with methoxylamine. However, aldehyde–methyloximes could not be detected via GC-MS because of the high background in the chromatograms. We considered the possibility that phytenal, as a possible degradation product of phytol, might accumulate during chlorophyll breakdown and therefore grew plants under nitrogen deprivation to stimulate leaf chlorosis. However, it was still not possible to detect phytenal or other aldehydes after derivatization by GC-MS. In the following, the aldehyde-methyloximes from crude leaf extracts were first purified via solid-phase extraction (SPE) on a silica column. Although we could still not detect any aldehyde–methyloximes from green leaves, it was now possible to find phytenal in nitrogen-deprived plants by GC-MS after derivatization and SPE purification (Fig. 2). Phytenal was the only long-chain aldehyde detected in the GC-MS chromatogram of nitrogen-deprived plants. No other straight or branched-chain aldehydes were found. Quantification of phytenal was achieved using hexadecanal as the internal standard. To determine the recovery of phytenal, a known amount of phytenal was spiked into a green leaf extract and after methoxylamine treatment and SPE purification, quantified by GC-MS. The recovery was defined as the amount of phytenal measured in the spiked leaf extract in relation to the amount measured after derivatization of the same amount of phytenal in the absence of the leaf extract and without SPE purification. The recovery was 84.6% (Fig. 3). The reproducibility was determined by quantification of phytenal in two independent experiments on different days. The amount of phytenal measured in the experiments varied by 11%, and this difference was not significant (Fig. 3). Next, we determined the linearity of the GC-MS method by adding different amounts of phytenal to green leaf lipid extracts followed by derivatization, SPE purification, and quantification by GC-MS. The plot of phytenal measured versus phytenal added was linear in the range from 0.25 to 50 nmol with an r2 of 0.996 (Fig. 3). The detection limit as defined by the signal-to-noise ratio of 3:1 was 0.05 nmol. To determine whether in addition to phytenal other long-chain aldehydes can be detected in whole-leaf extracts, aldehyde–methyloximes were measured by LC-MS/MS instead of GC-MS. First, a quadrupole-TOF (Q-TOF) instrument with high mass accuracy was used. After derivatization and SPE purification, two peaks each corresponding to the E/Z methyloxime isomers were identified in the Q-TOF chromatogram for the standards of hexadecanal (12.5, 13.0 min) and phytenal (15.1, 15.2 min), each with characteristic mass spectrum showing large fragment peaks at m/z of 60.04 (hexadecanal) and 96.08 (phytenal) (Fig. 4, A–C). To increase the sensitivity even further, LC-MS/MS measurements were performed using a highly sensitive triple quadrupole instrument. Multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) transitions for the aldehyde-methyloxime peaks derived from the Q-TOF spectra were 270.28/60.04 for hexadecanal and 324.33/96.08 for phytenal (Fig. 4, D–F). The LC-MS/MS triple quadrupole method was used to search for other long-chain aldehydes in the whole-leaf extract, that is, even- and odd-chain aldehydes with 10 to 20 carbon atoms, including straight-chain and branched-chain aldehydes derived from acyl or isoprenoid metabolism. The MRM transitions were derived from the mass spectrum of hexadecanal (Fig. 4, Table S1). Figure 5 shows LC-MS/MS chromatograms of pristanal and phytanal standards. The straight-chain isomers of pristanal and phytanal, that is, nonadecanal (19:0al) and eicosanal (20:0al), respectively, could in principle interfere with the measurements of the isobaric aldehydes pristanal and phytanal. Therefore, we chemically synthesized nonadecanal and eicosanal standards and determined their chromatographic characteristics. The two straight-chain aldehydes also resulted in two peaks each with the same mass transitions as pristanal and phytanal, but the straight-chain aldehydes eluted ∼1 min later. Next, extracts from Arabidopsis leaves (plants exposed to nitrogen deprivation) were analyzed by LC-MS/MS for the presence of C19:0 aldehyde-methyloximes (MRM 312/60) or C20:0 aldehyde-methyloximes (MRM 326/60). However, in both chromatograms, peaks were observed that eluted ∼0.5 min earlier than the standards, indicating that the long-chain aldehydes nonadecanal, eicosanal, pristanal, and phytanal could not be reliably identified in Arabidopsis leaves. To test whether phytenal accumulates under abiotic stress conditions, Arabidopsis WT plants were grown on soil and then exposed to dark, salt, heat, or cold stress. Chlorophyll was measured photometrically to determine whether the stress was accompanied with chlorophyll breakdown (chlorosis), and phytenal was quantified by GC-MS (Fig. 6). Salt or dark stress caused a decrease in the chlorophyll content, accompanied with an increase in phytenal. In contrast, heat or cold stress did not lead to large changes in chlorophyll contents, and at the same time, the amounts of phytenal remained low. These results indicate that phytenal accumulates only during chlorotic stress, likely by oxidation of phytol which is released by chlorophyll breakdown, but it does not increase under stress conditions that are not accompanied with chlorophyll breakdown. To test the hypothesis whether free phytol can be converted into phytenal, whole Arabidopsis plants were incubated in the buffer (16 h light/8 h dark) in the presence of phytol. It has previously been shown that phytol can be taken up by Arabidopsis plants and that it can be used for the synthesis of FAPEs (6Lippold F. vom Dorp K. Abraham M. Hölzl G. Wewer V. Lindberg Yilmaz J. Lager I. Montandon C. Besagni C. Kessler F. Stymne S. Dörmann P. Fatty acid phytyl ester synthesis in chloroplasts of Arabidopsis.Plant Cell. 2012; 24: 2001-2014Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). During phytol feeding, the amount of phytenal increased to very high amounts without changing the chlorophyll content (Fig. 7). The increase in phytenal during phytol feeding was also observed when plants were incubated in the dark, again without a strong impact on the amount of chlorophyll. This finding indicates that phytol is oxidized to phytenal in the plant in a way independent of light, in contrast to previous findings (14Rontani J.-F. Cuny P. Grossi V. Photodegradation of chlorophyll phytyl chain in senescent leaves of higher plants.Phytochemistry. 1996; 42: 347-351Crossref Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Next, the plants were first killed by heat inactivation for 5 min at 95 °C to destroy all enzymatic activities. Incubation of the boiled plants in the presence of phytol still resulted in an increase in phytenal, albeit to a lesser extent than living, non–heat-inactivated plants. Therefore, the conversion of exogenous phytol to phytenal in the plants is in part mediated by nonenzymatic, chemical oxidation but might also be due in part to enzyme-dependent oxidation. In addition, we studied the further metabolism of phytenal in a recovery experiment. Plants were incubated in the presence of phytol for 24 h. After washing, the plants were further incubated in the absence of phytol, and phytenal measured after 24 h. Figure 7D shows that the amount of phytenal was decreased to less than 50% after 24 h, indicating that it was metabolized, presumably by enzymatic oxidation (e.g., aldehyde dehydrogenases). The pao1 mutant of Arabidopsis is deficient in pheophorbide a oxygenase, which converts pheophorbide a, the Mg-free form of chlorophyllide, into red chlorophyll catabolite (17Pružinská A. Tanner G.

Characterization of chlorophyll catabolites and of chlorophyll catabolic enzymes involved in the degreening reaction.Plant Physiol. 2005; 139: 52-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar). As a consequence, chlorophyll hydrolysis in the pao1 mutant is suppressed, and the plants show a stay-green phenotype (Fig. 8) (8vom Dorp K. Hölzl G. Plohmann C. Eisenhut M. Abraham M. Weber A.P.M.

Detached leaves of WT Col-0 and pao1 were dark-incubated for 1 week to stimulate senescence (Fig. 8). Subsequently, chlorophyll and phytenal were measured. WT leaves turned yellow and showed decreased chlorophyll amounts accompanied with increased phytenal levels. Leaves of the pao1 mutant, however, remained green, and the chlorophyll content was not decreased. Furthermore, phytenal in pao1 mutant leaves incubated in the dark did not increase. These results indicate that phytenal is derived from phytol originating from chlorophyll degradation. To study the role of phytenal during phytol metabolism, Arabidopsis WT Col-0 plants were first grown on Murashige and Skoog (MS) agarose medium and then transferred to a nitrogen-deprived medium. It is known that nitrogen deprivation stimulates chlorophyll breakdown accompanied with the release of phytol and an increase in tocopherol and FAPEs (6Lippold F. vom Dorp K. Abraham M. Hölzl G. Wewer V. Lindberg Yilmaz J. Lager I. Montandon C. Besagni C. Kessler F. Stymne S. Dörmann P.

Remobilization of phytol from chlorophyll degradation is essential for tocopherol synthesis and growth of Arabidopsis.Plant Cell. 2015; 27: 2846-2859PubMed Google Scholar). Lipids were isolated from the leaves for the measurements of chlorophyll, phytol, FAPEs, tocopherol, and phytenal at different time points. The amounts of chlorophyll and phytol decreased over the 20-day period of nitrogen deprivation (Fig. 9). On the other hand, the amounts of FAPEs, tocopherol, and phytenal increased during nitrogen deprivation (Figs. 2 and 4). The increase in phytenal levels was the strongest after 20 days of nitrogen deficiency. However, the levels of phytenal were still very low compared with the amounts of the other metabolites, indicating that phytenal constitutes a minor proportion of the total pool of phytol-derived compounds. Thus, while a substantial amount of phytol derived from chlorophyll degradation is deposited in the form of FAPEs and tocopherol, the steady-state levels of phytenal remain low. The total pool of phytol-derived metabolites remains almost unchanged over the time period of nitrogen deprivation (Fig. 9G). Therefore, most of the phytol which is released from chlorophyll during nitrogen deprivation is stored in the form of FAPE or converted into tocopherol, rather than being oxidized to phytenal. FAPE synthesis is catalyzed by PES1 and PES2. Phytol phosphorylation which is mediated by VTE5 and VTE6, results in the synthesis of phytyl-PP which is the substrate for tocopherol synthesis (6Lippold F. vom Dorp K. Abraham M. Hölzl G. Wewer V.

The two pathways depend on phytol that is released from chlorophyll. To test if phytenal synthesis competes with phytol esterification or phytol phosphorylation, phytol-derived metabolites were measured in the pes1 pes2 and in the vte5 mutant plants after nitrogen deprivation (Fig. 10). The pes1 pes2 double mutant is almost completely devoid of FAPE because of a block in the two FAPE synthases PES1 and PES2 (6Lippold F. vom Dorp K. Abraham M. Hölzl G. Wewer V. Lindberg Yilmaz J.

After 20 days of nitrogen deprivation, the amounts of chlorophyll in vte5 plants were similar to those in the WT, whereas chlorophyll was slightly decreased in pes1 pes2. Phytenal levels were strongly increased in the two mutant lines as compared with the WT, indicating that phytenal synthesis competes with the esterification and phosphorylation pathways for phytol. In the present study, we established highly sensitive methods for the measurement of long-chain aldehydes in Arabidopsis leaves. One major long-chain aldehyde, that is, phytenal, was found, whereas other aldehydes were not reliably detected. Aldehydes are highly reactive because they form Schiff bases with amino group–containing compounds including amino acids and proteins. Therefore, plant cells presumably maintain the content of free aldehydes at a low concentration, possibly by action of aldehyde dehydrogenases, to avoid toxic interactions with other cellular components (18Stiti N.

Plant Sci. 2011; 2: 65Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Phytenal represents the oxidation product of phytol, and it was shown to be part of the phytol degradation pathway in humans (11Wanders R.J.A. Komen J. Ferdinandusse S.

Commun. 1997; 237: 33-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1). We considered the possibility that other long-chain aldehydes such as phytanal or pristanal potentially involved in phytol degradation could also be present in leaf extracts. Therefore, we used LC-MS/MS measurements with a Q-TOF or a triple quadrupole instrument to detect additional long-chain aldehydes in leaf extracts. However, pristanal and phytanal were barely detectable in the leaf. It is likely that phytanal is not an intermediate of phytol degradation, similar to the human pathway. Furthermore, free phytanic acid is not an intermediate of human phytol degradation, and phytanoyl-CoA, but not free phytanic acid, was detected in Arabidopsis plants, suggesting that the hypothetical branch pathway including phytanal and free phytanic acid is not used in plants (Fig. 1) (11Wanders R.J.A.

The microbiome has been shown to modulate host metabolism of endogenous and exogenous substances. However, the combined effects of pregnancy and the microbiome on host metabolism have not been investigated. The objective of this study was to investigate how the microbiome affects overall hepatic metabolic processes during pregnancy. We assessed these changes within 4 groups of C57BL/6 mice: conventional non-pregnant, conventional pregnant, germ-free non-pregnant, and germ-free pregnant mice. We performed RNA-seq analysis on liver tissues and LC-MS/MS analysis of the plasma to assess the effects of pregnancy and the microbiome on hepatic transcriptome and untargeted plasma metabolome to describe metabolic changes as results of both pregnancy and lack of microbiome. By integrating transcriptomics and metabolomics data, we identified eight metabolic pathways that were significantly enriched for differentially expressed genes associated with pregnancy in both conventional and germ-free mice. Notably, of the eight pathways, 4 pathways (retinol metabolism, arachidonic acid metabolism, linoleic acid metabolism, and steroid hormone biosynthesis) which are all critical for normal pregnancy and fetal development were affected by the germ-free status in pregnant mice, but not at all in non-pregnant mice, indicating that the alterations in these four pathways caused by the lack of microbiome are unique for pregnancy. These results provide novel insight into the role of the microbiome in modulating host metabolic processes critical for maternal health and fetal development during pregnancy."

The objective of this study was to describe clinical features and outcomes of cases of S . BJIs. Methods We conducted a retrospective analysis of adult cases of S . agalactiae BJIs that occurred between January 2009 and June 2015 in a French university hospital. The treatment success was assessed until 24 months after the end of antibiotic treatment. Results Among the 26 patients included, 20 (77%) were male, mean age was 62 years ± 13 and mean Charlson comorbidity index score was 4.9 ± 3.2. Diabetes mellitus was the most common comorbidity (n = 14, 54%). Six had PJI (Prosthetic Joint Infections), five osteosynthesis-associated infections, 11 osteomyelitis and four native septic arthritis. Eleven patients had a delayed or late infection: six with a prosthetic joint infection and five with an internal fixation device infection. Sixteen patients (62%) had a polymicrobial BJI, most commonly with Gram-positive cocci (75%) notably Staphylococcus aureus (44%). Polymicrobial infections were more frequently found in foot infections (90% vs 44%, p = 0.0184). During the two-year follow-up, three patients died (3/25, 12%) and seven (7/25, 28%) had treatment failure. Conclusion Diabetes mellitus was the most common comorbidity. We observed an heterogenous management and a high rate of relapse."

Currently approved AF antiarrhythmic drugs have limited efficacy and/or carry the risk of ventricular proarrhythmia. The cardiac acetylcholine activated inwardly rectifying K+ current (IKACh), composed of Kir3.1/Kir3.4 heterotetrameric and Kir3.4 homotetrameric channel subunits, is one of the best validated atrial-specific ion channels. Previous research pointed to a series of benzopyran derivatives with potential for treatment of arrhythmias, but their mechanism of action was not defined. Here, we characterize one of these compounds termed Benzopyran-G1 (BP-G1) and report that it selectively inhibits the Kir3.1 (GIRK1 or G1) subunit of the KACh channel. Homology modeling, molecular docking, and molecular dynamics simulations predicted that BP-G1 inhibits the IKACh channel by blocking the central cavity pore. We identified the unique F137 residue of Kir3.1 as the critical determinant for the IKACh-selective response to BP-G1. The compound interacts with Kir3.1 residues E141 and D173 through hydrogen bonds that proved critical for its inhibitory activity. BP-G1 effectively blocked the IKACh channel response to carbachol in an in vivo rodent model and displayed good selectivity and pharmacokinetic properties. Thus, BP-G1 is a potent and selective small-molecule inhibitor targeting Kir3.1-containing channels and is a useful tool for investigating the role of Kir3.1 heteromeric channels in vivo. The mechanism reported here could provide the molecular basis for future discovery of novel, selective IKACh channel blockers to treat atrial fibrillation with minimal side effects.

The mechanism reported here could provide the molecular basis for future discovery of novel, selective IKACh channel blockers to treat atrial fibrillation with minimal side effects. Atrial fibrillation (AF), a common cardiac arrhythmia, affects over two million Americans and is associated with increased morbidity, mortality, and healthcare costs. Antiarrhythmic drugs (AADs) used to treat AF aim to either maintain the normal sinus rhythm (SR) or control ventricular rate (1El-Haou S. Ford J.W. Milnes J.T. Novel K+ channel targets in atrial fibrillation drug development--where are we?.J. Cardiovasc. Pharmacol. 2015; 66: 412-431Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). However, conventional drugs such as sodium channel blockers (class I antiarrhythmic drugs) and potassium channel blockers (class III antiarrhythmic drugs) have limited efficacy, especially in persistent AF patients. In addition, these conventional AADs carry a risk of ventricular proarrhythmia, such as torsade de pointes (TdP) through excessive delay of ventricular repolarization (2Torp-Pedersen C. Moller M.

Thus, development of new antiarrhythmic agents with a more effective and safer profile is highly desirable (4Hashimoto N. Acetylcholine-activated potassium channel as a novel target for AF treatment.in: Atrial Fibrillation - Basic Research and Clinical Applications. IntechOpen Limited, London, UK2012: 321-338Crossref Google Scholar). The cardiac acetylcholine- (ACh-) activated inwardly rectifying K+ current (IKACh) consists of heterotetrameric ion channel subunits composed of Kir3.1 (GIRK1 or G1) and Kir3.4 (or GIRK4) subunits and is activated via the M2 muscarinic receptor to mediate vagal influences on heart rate and atrial repolarization. The Kir3.1/4 heterotetramers are the main contributors to the cardiac IKACh, while Kir3.4 homotetramers contribute considerably less activity. In contrast, Kir3.1 homotetramers are inactive and mostly trapped in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) (5Ma D. Zerangue N. Raab-Graham K. Fried S.R. Jan Y.N. Jan L.Y. Diverse trafficking patterns due to multiple traffic motifs in G protein-activated inwardly rectifying potassium channels from brain and heart.Neuron. 2002; 33: 715-729Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). Heteromerization with the Kir3.4 traffics the heterotetramer efficiently to the plasma membrane to contribute to IKACh. Mutation of Kir3.1(F137) to the corresponding Ser residue found in Kir3.4 produces functional Kir3.1(F137S) channels although their trapping in the ER continues (6Chan K.W. Sui J.L. Vivaudou M. Logothetis D.E. Control of channel activity through a unique amino acid residue of a G protein-gated inwardly rectifying K+ channel subunit.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

This active Kir3.1 mutant has been an invaluable tool to assessing the role of Kir3.1 subunits in the regulation of heteromeric channel activity, but in addition, it has been found to be a critical determinant of activity in the action of urea-based channel activators (8Wydeven N.

Chem. 2020; 295: 3614-3634Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Kir3 channel activity is strongly inwardly rectifying. Despite the relatively small outward conductance at physiological potentials, IKACh is an important contributor to the late AP repolarization and plays a major role in stabilizing the resting membrane potential (10Ravens U. Cerbai E. Role of potassium currents in cardiac arrhythmias.Europace. 2008; 10: 1133-1137Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar, 11Voigt N. Dobrev D. Atrial-selective potassium channel blockers.Card. Electrophysiol. Clin. 2016; 8: 411-421Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Activation of IKACh has strong atrial AP-shortening and AF-promoting effects (12Nattel S. Carlsson L. Innovative approaches to anti-arrhythmic drug therapy.Nat. Rev. Drug Discov. 2006; 5: 1034-1049Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). Studies have shown that chronic AF alters IKACh properties, by causing the channel to open even in the absence of ACh, resulting in APD shortening that promotes AF (13Cha T.J. Ehrlich J.R.

Physiol. 2004; 557: 583-597Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). In the heart, Kir3 channel subunits comprising IKACh are prominently expressed in the sinus and atrioventricular nodes, as well as in the atrial myocardium but are largely absent in ventricles or contribute minimally to ventricular repolarization (16Dobrzynski H. Marples D.D. Musa H. Yamanushi T.T. Henderson Z. Takagishi Y. Honjo H. Kodama I. Boyett M.R.

Atrial GIRK channels mediate the effects of vagus nerve stimulation on heart rate dynamics and arrhythmogenesis.Front. Physiol. 2018; 9: 943Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Therefore, targeting IKACh channels is expected to selectively prolong the atrial effective refractory period (ERP) and therefore terminate AF without the risk of QT prolongation or TdP (1El-Haou S. Ford J.W. Milnes J.T. Novel K+ channel targets in atrial fibrillation drug development--where are we?.J. Cardiovasc. Pharmacol. 2015; 66: 412-431Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). A number of IKACh channel inhibitors have been developed in recent years. However, no selective IKACh channel inhibitors have been approved for clinical use to date (11Voigt N. Dobrev D.

Tertiapin-Q is a nonoxidizable derivative of the naturally occurring peptide toxin tertiapin from the venom of the European honey bee (Apis melifera) that selectively inhibits Kir (Kir3 and Kir1 or ROMK) channels, as well as calcium-activated large-conductance potassium channels (BK) (19Jin W. Lu Z. A novel high-affinity inhibitor for inward-rectifier K+ channels.Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 13291-13299Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar, 20Kanjhan R. Coulson E.J. Adams D.J.

Tertiapin-Q selectively inhibits IKACh channels in the cardiac tissue with high potency, without effect on Kir2.1 (IRK1) channels (21Jin W. Lu Z. Synthesis of a stable form of tertiapin: A high-affinity inhibitor for inward-rectifier K+ channels.Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 14286-14293Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Potential side effects of Tertiapin-Q could arise from inhibition of BK outward currents in the central nervous system (20Kanjhan R. Coulson E.J. Adams D.J. Bellingham M.C.

Inward rectifier potassium currents as a target for atrial fibrillation therapy.J. Cardiovasc. Pharmacol. 2008; 52: 129-135Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). NIP-142 was the first moderately selective IKACh small-molecule blocker, which inhibited heterologously expressed Kir3.1/Kir3.4 and KV1.5 currents at low micromolar concentrations (23Matsuda T.

It terminates both AF in the canine vagal stimulation-induced AF model and atrial flutter in the canine Y-shaped incision-induced AF model (25Nagasawa H. Fujiki A. Fujikura N. Matsuda T. Yamashita T. Inoue H. Effects of a novel class III antiarrhythmic agent, NIP-142, on canine atrial fibrillation and flutter.Circ. J. 2002; 66: 185-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). The follow-up compound NIP-151 has higher potency for IKACh and selectivity over hERG channels, also effectively terminates AF in both vagal nerve stimulation-induced AF and aconitine-induced AF models. NIP-151 significantly prolonged the canine atrial ERP without significant effects on the ventricular ERP (26Hashimoto N. Yamashita T. Tsuruzoe N.

Pharmacol. 2008; 51: 162-169Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). NTC-801, a substituted benzopyran, was the first “selective” Kir3.1/Kir3.4 inhibitor investigated in clinical studies (27Machida T. Hashimoto N. Kuwahara I. Ogino Y. Matsuura J. Yamamoto W. Itano Y.

Electrophysiol. 2011; 4: 94-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). It significantly prolonged the canine atrial ERP without affecting the ventricular ERP under vagal nerve stimulation. It effectively converted AF to normal sinus rhythm in both vagal nerve simulation-induced and the aconitine-induced AF model in dog and terminated and prevented the induction of AF in an atrial tachycardia-AF dog model of persistent AF (27Machida T. Hashimoto N. Kuwahara I. Ogino Y. Matsuura J. Yamamoto W. Itano Y. Zamma A. Matsumoto R. Kamon J. Kobayashi T. Ishiwata N. Yamashita T. Ogura T. Nakaya H.

Cardiovasc. Pharmacol. 2014; 63: 421-427Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). However, a phase II study failed to meet the primary endpoint to reduce the AF burden in patients with paroxysmal AF. It is speculated that this was due to the relatively low dosing, which was necessary to avoid central nervous system side effects (1El-Haou S. Ford J.W. Milnes J.T. Novel K+ channel targets in atrial fibrillation drug development--where are we?.J. Cardiovasc. Pharmacol. 2015; 66: 412-431Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). In addition, IKACh inhibitors, AZD2927 and A7071, did not affect atrial repolarization in atrial flutter patients (29Walfridsson H. Anfinsen O.G. Berggren A. Frison L. Jensen S. Linhardt G. Nordkam A.C. Sundqvist M. Carlsson L. Is the acetylcholine-regulated inwardly rectifying potassium current a viable antiarrhythmic target? Translational discrepancies of AZD2927 and A7071 in dogs and humans.Europace. 2015; 17: 473-482Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). However, the lack of desirable effects of these compounds does not diminish the value of IKACh channel inhibitors for persistent AF (1El-Haou S. Ford J.W. Milnes J.T. Novel K+ channel targets in atrial fibrillation drug development--where are we?.J. Cardiovasc. Pharmacol. 2015; 66: 412-431Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Therefore, the need remains to develop new drug candidates selectively targeting IKACh channels. A group of benzopyran derivatives with triple rings was discovered having a prolongation effect on the atrial ERP, which can be used for treatment of arrhythmias. Conventional antiarrhythmic agents that use as their main mechanism of action prolongation of the refractory period (presumably due to prolongation of the action potential in ventricular muscle) present therapeutic problems; they induce highly dangerous arrhythmias leading to sudden death, such as torsades de pointes among others. In contrast, tricyclic benzopyran compounds selectively prolong the dog atrial ERP period without any influence on the ventricular ERP (30Ohrai K. Shigeta Y. Uesugi O. Okada T. Matsuda T. Tricyclic Benzopyrane Compound as Anti-arrhythmic Agents. United States. United States Patent Office, Alexandria, VA2008Google Scholar). However, the mechanism of their antiarrhythmic activity has been unclear. From this chemical series a selection patent (31Takada Y. Kamon M. Kawahara S. Umeda Y. Novel Crystal Forms of Tricyclic Benzopyran Compound and Processes for Producing Same. European Patent Office, Munich, Germany2010Google Scholar) exemplifies a crystal form of a single 4-(aralkylamino)-2,2-dimethyl-3,4-dihydro-2H-benzopyran-3-ol compound. An undisclosed substitution of this compound is inferred to be the clinical candidate NTC-801 (27Machida T. Hashimoto N. Kuwahara I. Ogino Y. Matsuura J. Yamamoto W. Itano Y. Zamma A. Matsumoto R. Kamon J. Kobayashi T. Ishiwata N. Yamashita T. Ogura T. Nakaya H. Effects of a highly selective acetylcholine-activated K+ channel blocker on experimental atrial fibrillation.Circ. Arrhythm. Electrophysiol. 2011; 4: 94-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). We synthesized the patented (31Takada Y. Kamon M. Kawahara S. Umeda Y. Novel Crystal Forms of Tricyclic Benzopyran Compound and Processes for Producing Same. European Patent Office, Munich, Germany2010Google Scholar) tricyclic benzopyran compounds (enantiomers), (3R,4S)-7-(hydroxymethyl)-2,2,9-trimethyl-4-(2-phenylethylamino)-3,4-dihydropyrano[2,3-g]quinolin-3-ol and found one, BP-G1 (Fig. 1A) to selectively and potently inhibit heteromeric Kir3.1/4 or Kir3.1/2 channels (IC50s ∼ 10–30 nM) over other cardiac channels, including homomeric Kir3 and Kir2 channels. The compound can be used as a useful pharmaceutical tool to explore the mechanism of action of tricyclic benzopyran compounds through their interactions with the IKACh/Kir3.x channels, as well as their selectivity over other ion channels. In this work, we characterized the molecular mechanism of BP-G1 action and its interaction with the Kir3.1/4 channel, using a combination of computational and experimental approaches. A group of benzopyran derivatives with triple rings was discovered to have a prolongation effect on the refractory period of atrial muscle without any influence on the refractory period and action potential of ventricular muscle (30Ohrai K. Shigeta Y. Uesugi O. Okada T. Matsuda T. Tricyclic Benzopyrane Compound as Anti-arrhythmic Agents. United States. United States Patent Office, Alexandria, VA2008Google Scholar). However, the mechanism of the antiarrhythmic activity of these drugs has been unclear. We tested whether benzopyran derivatives selectively inhibited Kir3.x channels that underlie cardiac IKACh that is specifically found in the atrial myocardium. We tested the inhibitory activity of the benzopyran derivative BP-G1 (Fig. 1A) on several inwardly rectifier K+ channels, including Kir2.1, Kir2.3, Kir3.1∗, Kir3.2∗, Kir3.4∗, Kir3.1/2, and Kir3.1/4 channels by two electrode voltage-clamp (TEVC) (see Experimental procedures) experiments (where Kir3.1∗: Kir3.1(F137S); Kir3.2∗: Kir3.2(E152D); Kir3.4∗: Kir3.4(S143T)). The compound showed strong inhibitory selectivity for heteromeric Kir3 channels containing Kir3.1 (Kir3.1/2 and Kir3.1/4) over other Kir channels, including homomeric Kir3 channels (Kir3.1∗, Kir3.2∗, Kir3.4∗, Kir3.1∗/Kir3.2 and Kir3.1∗/Kir3.4) (Fig. 1B). Figure 1, C and D show representative experiments of responses of Kir3.1/4 and Kir3.1∗ channels to the compound. Upon application of the BP-G1 [1 μM], the Kir3.1/3.4 (or Kir3.1/4) channel current was significantly reduced over 100 s as compared with the Kir3.1∗ channel current. BP-G1 selectively inhibited heteromeric Kir3.1/2 and Kir3.1/4 whole-cell currents in a concentration-dependent manner and with comparable potency, IC50s of 55.9 nM and 55.0 nM in TEVC oocyte experiments (Fig. 1, E and F), and 32.2 nM and 10.5 nM in whole-cell patch-clamp HEK-293 cell experiments, respectively (Fig. 1, G and H). The pore helix (F137) residue has been shown to be a critical Kir3.1 determinant for current potentiation of heteromeric Kir3 currents and also for ML297- and GAT1508-induced current potentiation (6Chan K.W.

In addition, the M2 helix residue D173 was also shown to be critical for ML297- and GAT1508-induced current stimulation (Fig. 2A). Thus, we proceeded to test whether Kir3.1(F137) and Kir3.1(D173) were also important for BP-G1 inhibition in the background of Kir3.4 channels. We chose to mutate the S143 and N179 corresponding residues of the Kir3.4 to the F137 and D173 of the Kir3.1 channel and coexpressed them with Kir3.4 wild-type subunits (6Chan K.W. Sui J.L. Vivaudou M. Logothetis D.E. Control of channel activity through a unique amino acid residue of a G protein-gated inwardly rectifying K+ channel subunit.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 14193-14198Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Interestingly, while BP-G1 did not inhibit the wild-type Kir3.4 channel or the Kir3.4/4(N179D) channel mutant, it did inhibit the Kir3.4/4(S143F) channel mutant in a concentration-dependent manner (IC50 = 62.1 nM) (Fig. 2, B and C). In the background of the BP-G1 sensitive Kir3.4/4(S143F) channel, the double-mutant Kir3.4/4(S143F, N179D) showed a 20% less inhibition by BP-G1 (Fig. 2B). Because an Asp residue in position 179 in the context of the Kir3.4(S143F) did not contribute to the inhibition by BP-G1, the results of Figure 2 suggested that the pore helix Phe residue (S143F in Kir3.4 corresponding to F137 in Kir3.1 subunit) is a critical determinant for selective inhibition by BP-G1. To better understand the molecular mechanism of the BP-G1 inhibition on Kir3 channels, we built homology models for the Kir3.4 and Kir3.1/4 channels based on a crystal structure of the Kir3.2 channel (PDBID: 3SYA). Sequence alignment among Kir3.1, Kir3.4, and Kir3.2 channels was generated by the ClustalW server (http://www.genome.jp/-tools/clustalw/). The sequence identities between Kir3.2 and Kir3.4 or Kir3.2 and Kir3.1 are 72% and 53%, respectively, which makes the Kir3.2 crystal structure an excellent structural template to generate accurate homology models for the Kir3.4, Kir3.1/2, and Kir3.1/4 channels (32Cui M. Cantwell L. Zorn A. Logothetis D.E. Kir channel molecular physiology, pharmacology and therapeutic implications.in: Handbook of Experimental Pharmacology. Springer, Berlin, Germany2021Google Scholar). We used the MODELLER program (33Sali A. Blundell T.L. Comparative protein modelling by satisfaction of spatial restraints.J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 234: 779-815Crossref PubMed Scopus (10512) Google Scholar) to generate ten initial homology models for Kir3.4 and Kir3.1/4, respectively, based on the Kir3.2 structural template and selected the one with the best internal DOPE (Discrete Optimized Protein Energy) score for modeling the compound and channel interactions. Based on the homology model of Kir3.1/4 channel, we performed molecular docking simulations to explore the potential binding site in the channel. Since our experimental results showed that the Kir3.1(F137) residue [corresponding to the Kir3.4(S143)] is critical for the inhibitory activity of BP-G1, we selected these residues together with the HBC residues F181(Kir3.1) and F187(Kir3.4) to define the grid box for docking simulations. The box covered the entire central cavity of the channel. We performed grid-based rigid protein and flexible docking using Glide and followed by Induced Fit Docking (IFD, Schrödinger, Inc), which takes into account the induced fit effects between the protein and ligand interactions. The pose with the lowest XP score from the IFD docking was selected as the predicted binding pose of the ligand (Fig. 3A). The detailed interactions between the BP-G1 and the channel were analyzed using the LIGPLOT program (34Wallace A.C. Laskowski R.A. Thornton J.M. LIGPLOT: A program to generate schematic diagrams of protein-ligand interactions.Protein Eng. 1995; 8: 127-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (4333) Google Scholar). Figure 3, B and C show predicted interactions between the BP-G1 and Kir3.1/4 channel. Three predicted interactions stood out: two between the nitrogen of ring A of the compound and a conserved residue in Kir3 channels (Kir3.1: E141 in the pore helix) and one between the hydroxyl of ring C of the compound and D173 that is unique to Kir3.1 compared with Asn residues found in the other Kir3 channels (32Cui M. Cantwell L. Zorn A. Logothetis D.E. Kir channel molecular physiology, pharmacology and therapeutic implications.in: Handbook of Experimental Pharmacology. Springer, Berlin, Germany2021Google Scholar). Interestingly, the critical Kir3.1(F137) that is required for BP-G1 inhibition (Figs. 1B and 2, B and C) was not predicted by the model to interact directly with the compound. Instead, the model suggested that F137 influenced residue Kir3.1(E141), which directly interacted with the BP-G1 compound. Figure 3D shows the relationship of F137 to E141 relative to the compound. The bulky F137 side chain appears to enable sterically the salt bridge between E141 and the compound. To test the role of the Kir3.1(E141) residue in the BP-G1 inhibition, we mutated it to Ala. The Kir3.1(E141A)/4 showed only a 25% current block compared with the 75 to 80% block seen with the wild-type Kir3.1/4 (Figs. 1B and 4, A and C). In contrast, the neighboring conserved Kir3.1(T143A)/4 showed no significant reduction in BP-G1 block (Fig. 2A). We next probed the role of the Kir3.1 unique residue D173. The Kir3.1(D173A) mutant also showed a ∼25% current block by 1 μM BP-G1 (Fig. 4, A and C). Moreover, the double mutant Kir3.1(E141A/D173A) abolished any current block by BP-G1 (Fig. 4, A and C). As we saw in Figure 2, although BP-G1 showed no blo"

In this article, 23 driving factors influencing super-gentrification are identified by literature research and Delphi method. Then, the 23 driving factors affecting super-gentrification are divided into four dimensions: political, economic, social and spatial dimension. On this basis, hypotheses are proposed and a structural equation model is established. Then, SPSS 25.0 and AMOS 24.0 software are used to test the reliability and validity of the questionnaire data, and the model results are fitted and modified. Finally, the optimization model and path coefficient of super-gentrification driving factors are calculated. The results of the study show that political factors, economic factors, social factors, and spatial factors, all play a positive role in the development of super-gentrification. Social factors are the fundamental factors to promote super-gentrification, political factors, economic factors, and spatial factors also play a key role in the super-gentrification process."
https://openalex.org/W3135408973,"Background A common complication of endovascular treatment for femoropopliteal lesions is bleeding at the vascular access site. Although risk factors of bleeding-associated complications at the approach site have been reported, the results have been inconclusive. Hence, this study aimed to assess the predictors of bleeding-associated complications at the approach site in patients undergoing endovascular treatment for femoropopliteal lesions. Methods This retrospective, single-center, observational study included consecutive patients who underwent endovascular treatment (n = 366, 75% male, 72.4±9.9 year) for peripheral arterial disease with claudication and critical limb ischemia in our hospital from January 2010 to December 2017. We divided the patients into bleeding and non-bleeding groups, depending on whether bleeding-associated complications occurred at the approach site. Bleeding-associated complications were defined according to the Bleeding Academic Research Consortium criteria types 2, 3, and 5. Results Altogether, 366 endovascular treatment procedures and 404 arterial accesses were performed for femoropopliteal lesions in 335 peripheral arterial disease patients with claudication and 69 critical limb ischemia patients. We recorded 35 postprocedural bleeding-associated complications at the approach site (9%), all of which were hematomas. The predictors of increased bleeding-associated complications were age ≥ 80 years (bleeding vs. non-bleeding group, 43% vs. 25%, p&lt;0.05) and antegrade cannulation of the common femoral artery (48% vs. 69%, p&lt;0.05). Ultrasound-guided puncture reduced bleeding-associated complications (odds ratio, 0.28; 95% confidence interval, 0.004–0.21; p&lt;0.05). In contrast, there was no significant difference in puncture site calcification between the groups (bleeding vs. non-bleeding groups, 29% vs. 21%, p = 0.29). Conclusion Ultrasound-guided puncture is associated with a decrease in bleeding-associated complications at the approach site, regardless of the presence of calcified plaque. It is particularly effective and should be more actively used in patients aged ≥80 years and for antegrade cannulation of the common femoral artery."
https://openalex.org/W3135464339,"Aesthetic experiences have been distinguished from other experiences based on an aesthetic mode of processing that often entails concentrating working memory resources on the aesthetic stimulus. Since working memory is a limited-capacity system, there should be a trade-off between available resources and the aesthetic experience. To test whether the intensity of the aesthetic experience is reduced if working memory resources are otherwise occupied, we employed an experience sampling method. One hundred and fifteen undergraduate students (45% female; M age = 23.50 years, SD = 2.72 years) participated in a 2-week experience sampling study and furnished a total of 15,047 reports of their aesthetic experiences. As measures of current working memory resources, participants answered questions regarding their current working memory load and whether they were engaged in a second task. In addition, they reported whether they had had an aesthetic experience and how much they had savored the aesthetic experience. Multilevel modeling was used for data analysis. A higher working memory load was associated with fewer aesthetic experiences and reduced the savoring of aesthetic experiences. Second tasks, however, that were perceived as demanding and requiring a lot of concentration enhanced the savoring of aesthetic experiences. In sum, other goal-oriented behavior that requires working memory resources appears to conflict with aesthetic experiences in everyday life."
https://openalex.org/W3135690345,"In vivo tissue-engineered vascular grafts constructed in the subcutaneous spaces of graft recipients have functioned well clinically. Because the formation of vascular graft tissues depends on several recipient conditions, chemical pretreatments, such as dehydration by ethanol (ET) or crosslinking by glutaraldehyde (GA), have been attempted to improve the initial mechanical durability of the tissues. Here, we compared the effects of short-duration (10 min) chemical treatments on the mechanical properties of tissues. Tubular tissues (internal diameter, 5 mm) constructed in the subcutaneous tissues of beagle dogs (4 weeks, n = 3), were classified into three groups: raw tissue without any treatment (RAW), tissue dehydrated with 70% ET (ET), and tissue crosslinked with 0.6% GA (GA). Five mechanical parameters were measured: burst pressure, suture retention strength, ultimate tensile strength (UTS), ultimate strain (%), and Young’s modulus. The tissues were also autologously re-embedded into the subcutaneous spaces of the same dogs for 4 weeks (n = 2) for the evaluation of histological responses. The burst pressure of the RAW group (1275.9 ± 254.0 mm Hg) was significantly lower than those of ET (2115.1 ± 262.2 mm Hg, p = 0.0298) and GA (2570.5 ± 282.6 mm Hg, p = 0.0017) groups. Suture retention strength, UTS or the ultimate strain did not differ significantly among the groups. Young’s modulus of the ET group was the highest (RAW: 5.41 ± 1.16 MPa, ET: 12.28 ± 2.55 MPa, GA: 7.65 ± 1.18 MPa, p = 0.0185). No significant inflammatory tissue response or evidence of residual chemical toxicity was observed in samples implanted subcutaneously for four weeks. Therefore, short-duration ET and GA treatment might improve surgical handling and the mechanical properties of in vivo tissue-engineered vascular tissues to produce ideal grafts in terms of mechanical properties without interfering with histological responses."
https://openalex.org/W3133494249,"Bacteriophages (phages) exhibit high genetic diversity, and the mosaic nature of the shared genetic pool makes quantifying phage relatedness a shifting target. Early parameters for clustering of related Mycobacteria and Arthrobacter phage genomes relied on nucleotide identity thresholds but, more recently, clustering of Gordonia and Microbacterium phages has been performed according to shared gene content. Singleton phages lack the nucleotide identity and/or shared gene content required for clustering newly sequenced genomes with known phages. Whole genome metrics of novel Arthrobacter phage BlueFeather, originally designated a putative singleton, showed low nucleotide identity but high amino acid and gene content similarity with Arthrobacter phages originally assigned to Clusters FE and FI. Gene content similarity revealed that BlueFeather shared genes with these phages in excess of the parameter for clustering Gordonia and Microbacterium phages. Single gene analyses revealed evidence of horizontal gene transfer between BlueFeather and phages in unique clusters that infect a variety of bacterial hosts. Our findings highlight the advantage of using shared gene content to study seemingly genetically isolated phages and have resulted in the reclustering of BlueFeather, a putative singleton, as well as former Cluster FI phages, into a newly expanded Cluster FE."

The interaction interface between Pgp2 and PG to select sites for peptide trimming is unknown. We determined a 1.6 Å resolution crystal structure of Pgp2, which contains a conserved LD-carboxypeptidase domain and a previously uncharacterized domain with an NTF2-like fold (NTF2). We identified a pocket in the NTF2 domain formed by conserved residues and located ∼40 Å from the LD-carboxypeptidase active site. Expression of pgp2 in trans with substitutions of charged (Lys257, Lys307, Glu324) and hydrophobic residues (Phe242 and Tyr233) within the pocket did not restore helical morphology to a pgp2 deletion strain. Muropeptide analysis indicated a decrease of murotripeptides in the deletion strain expressing these mutants, suggesting reduced Pgp2 catalytic activity. Pgp2 but not the K307A mutant was pulled down by C. jejuni Δpgp2 PG sacculi, supporting a role for the pocket in PG binding.

Consumption of contaminated food, water or contact with domesticated animals can lead to human infection. Disease symptoms vary from self-limiting diarrhea to serious sequelae including inflammatory bowel disease and Guillain–Barré syndrome.

Homologs of Pgp1 and Pgp2 are characterized in Helicobacter pylori, and both are required for maintaining helical cell shape (14Sycuro L.K. Wyckoff T.J. Biboy J. Born P. Pincus Z. Vollmer W.

Sequence analysis of Pgp2 indicates that it contains an LD-carboxypeptidase (LD-CPase) domain and an NTF2-like superfamily (NTF2) domain. NTF2 domains are broadly found in nature and function in both ligand binding and catalysis, including in other PG hydrolases such as PBP2a and NlpC/p60 (16Lim D. Strynadka N.C.

Csd6 is suggested to be required for flagellin biosynthesis in H. pylori (18Asakura H. Churin Y. Bauer B. Boettcher J.P. Bartfeld S. Hashii N. Kawasaki N. Mollenkopf H.J. Jungblut P.R. Brinkmann V. Meyer T.F. Helicobacter pylori HP0518 affects flagellin glycosylation to alter bacterial motility.Mol. Microbiol. 2010; 78: 1130-1144Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar), and its NTF2 domain is proposed to bind a pseudaminic acid (19Kim H.S. Im H.N. An D.R. Yoon J.Y. Jang J.Y. Mobashery S.

We report the crystal structure of Pgp2 and identified a conserved binding pocket in the NTF2 domain. Site-directed mutagenesis combined with interaction studies using PG fragments was used to show that the NTF2 domain binds PG and is required for C. jejuni helical shape. On the basis of these results, we propose a model for Pgp2-PG interaction involving both the LD-CPase and the NTF2 domains to guide catalytic activity. A recombinant Pgp2 construct (Pgp243-325) containing residues 43–325 of the native sequence (cjj81176_0915) is enzymatically active (20Soni A.S. Lin C.S. Murphy M.E.P. Tanner M.E. Peptides containing meso-oxa-diaminopimelic acid as substrates for the cell-shape-determining proteases Csd6 and Pgp2.ChemBioChem. 2019; 20: 1591-1598PubMed Google Scholar) and was suitable for structural characterization. Pgp2 crystallized in space group P212121 and the structure was solved to 1.6 Å resolution by molecular replacement using Csd6 as a search model (PDB ID: 4XZZ). X-ray data collection and refinement statistics are summarized in Table S1. The Pgp2 structure contains one Pgp2 molecule in the asymmetric unit (Fig. 1A). Analysis in solution by dynamic light scattering indicated an average molecular weight of 44 kDa, consistent with the predicted weight of the recombinant Pgp2 monomer (36 kDa; not shown). The structure of Pgp2 contains an N-terminal helix (residues Q43-I51), the catalytic LD-CPase domain (residues V65-K201), and the C-terminal NTF2 domain (residues K208-Q325), each connected to the next domain by a single loop (Fig. 1A). An extensive interface with a buried surface area of 1130 Å2 is found between the LD-CPase and NTF2 domains, as calculated by the PISA server (21Krissinel E. Henrick K. Inference of macromolecular assemblies from crystalline state.J. Mol. Biol. 2007; 372: 774-797Crossref PubMed Scopus (6818) Google Scholar). The LD-CPase domain consists of parallel strands β5–β6 sandwiched by a beta sheet (β1–β4 and β7), four helices (α2–α5), and connecting loops. The likely catalytic triad (C174-H157-G158) is located on the central stands β5–β6 (Fig. 1, A and D). The NTF2 domain contains three helices (α6–α8) wrapped around a curved antiparallel β-sheet (β8–β11), which together forms a cone shape domain with a broad pocket. Using a Dali search (22Holm L. DALI and the persistence of protein shape.Protein Sci. 2020; 29: 128-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar) for similar structures in the PDB, only Csd6 can be superimposed with Pgp2 over both the LD-CPase and NTF2 domains (PDB ID: 4XZZ, RMSD of 1.8 Å for 281 Cα atoms). The structure of Csd6 includes two additional α-helices at the N terminus that forms a homodimerization domain between two Csd6 monomers. The equivalent 27 residues are absent in the truncated Pgp2 construct. The structure of Csd6 deviates from strands β9–β10 of the Pgp2 NTF2 domain (Fig. 1B). The LD-CPase domain of Pgp2 is distantly related to LD-transpeptidases with sequence identity <20%. An example is LdtMt5 from Mycobacterium tuberculosis (PDB ID: 4Z7A, RMSD of 2.4 Å over 106 Cα atoms). The NTF2 domain is structurally similar to proteins with diverse functions, such as calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II from Rattus norvegicus (PDB ID: 5U6Y, RMSD of 2.4 Å over 109 Cα atoms) and penicillin-binding protein 2A, a DD-transpeptidase from methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (PDB ID: 3ZFZ, RMSD of 2.7 Å over 95 Cα atoms). To predict functionally important residues in Pgp2, 150 homologous sequences with 35%–95% sequence identity to Pgp2 were identified and aligned in ConSurf (23Ashkenazy H. Erez E. Martz E. Pupko T. Ben-Tal N. ConSurf 2010: Calculating evolutionary conservation in sequence and structure of proteins and nucleic acids.Nucleic Acids Res. 2010; 38: W529-W533Crossref PubMed Scopus (1343) Google Scholar). The level of sequence conservation was mapped onto the surface of Pgp2 (Fig. 1C). Regions of high sequence conservation are observed on one side of the molecule, focused in two clusters. The first cluster is in proximity to the catalytic triad in the LD-CPase domain (Fig. 1D). The second cluster is formed by 17 primarily aromatic (41%) and charged (30%) residues that are clustered in the pocket of the NTF2 domain (Fig. 1D). Previously, integration of wild-type pgp2 with its native promotor at a remote site of the Δpgp2 chromosome restored helical cell shape in the straight-rod deletion strain (7Frirdich E. Vermeulen J. Biboy J. Soares F. Taveirne M.E. Johnson J.G. DiRita V.J. Girardin S.E. Vollmer W. Gaynor E.C. Peptidoglycan LD-carboxypeptidase Pgp2 influences Campylobacter jejuni helical cell shape and pathogenic properties and provides the substrate for the DL-carboxypeptidase Pgp1.J. Biol. Chem. 2014; 289: 8007-8018Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Using this complementation system, we evaluated the importance of the two conserved clusters by constructing single residue Pgp2 variants. Mutants of pgp2 encoding substitutions of catalytic residues (H157 and C174) or residues in the NTF2 pocket (Y233, F242, K257, K307, and E324) were generated, and the morphologies of these strains were examined by differential interference contrast microscopy. The Δpgp2 strains complemented by mutants of the catalytic triad (H157A, C174S) displayed rod morphologies, confirming that Pgp2 catalytic activity is required for helical shape (Fig. 2A). Point mutations within the NTF2 pocket resulted in bacteria with partially curved to straight morphologies. Quantitative analysis of each strain by Celltool (24Pincus Z. Theriot J.A. Comparison of quantitative methods for cell-shape analysis.J. Microsc. 2007; 227: 140-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar) indicated that strains complementation with native pgp2 displayed a cell curvature distribution similar to wild-type cells, whereas the strains expressing Pgp2 mutants had similar lengths but varied in cell curvature (Fig. 2B). The catalytic triad mutants (C174S, H157A) and three mutants within the NTF2 pocket (Y233A, K257A, and K307A) resulted in bacteria with cell curvature distributions that were similar to the Δpgp2 strain. Two mutants were of an intermediate phenotype (F242A and E324Q). These curvature defects were not due to Pgp2 expression deficiency as confirmed by Western blot using an anti-Pgp2 antibody (Figs. 2C and S1). Together, we concluded that the LD-CPase and NTF2 domains are both required for helical shape in C. jejuni. Pgp2 was reported to be post-translationally modified (25Young N.M. Brisson J.R. Kelly J. Watson D.C. Tessier L. Lanthier P.H. Jarrell H.C. Cadotte N. St Michael F. Aberg E. Szymanski C.M. Structure of the N-linked glycan present on multiple glycoproteins in the Gram-negative bacterium, Campylobacter Jejuni.J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 42530-42539Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (357) Google Scholar). In this earlier study, Pgp2 purified from cell lysate using a carbohydrate-binding column displayed three spots by two-dimensional electrophoresis. Four N-linked glycosylation sequons (Asn-Xaa-Ser/Thr) were found in the sequence of Pgp2 suggesting that post-translational glycosylation likely gave rise to the two bands observed on the Western blot (Fig. 2C). No positive correlation was found from a quantification of the intensities of the two bands and a comparison against cell shape. Pgp2 activity was quantified by assaying for the products (tripeptide or cross-linked tetratripeptides) in the hydrolyzed PG of C. jejuni. Purified PG from C. jejuni strains complemented with pgp2 harboring point mutations was digested by muramidase and analyzed by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). The identities of peaks from the HPLC elution profile were confirmed by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight mass spectrometry. Complementation with a catalytically inactive variant (C174S) produced undetectable levels of monomeric and cross-linked tripeptides (Fig. 3, left panel), and this variant served as a negative control. Lower levels of products were observed in the NTF2 domain mutant strains (K257A, K307A, and E324Q) relative to the strain expressing wild-type Pgp2 (Fig. 3, left panel). The proportion of monomeric tripeptides ranged from 14% to 25%, whereas the proportion of cross-linked tetratripeptides ranged from 41% to 95% (Fig. 3, right panel), demonstrating that the NTF2 domain is required for full Pgp2 activity in C. jejuni. Furthermore, for NTF2 mutants, the activity on monomeric tetrapeptides was diminished more than for cross-linked tetrapeptides. In some multidomain PG hydrolases, the presence of a PG-binding domain enhances the activity of the catalytic domain (26Rocaboy M. Herman R. Sauvage E. Remaut H. Moonens K. Terrak M. Charlier P. Kerff F. The crystal structure of the cell division amidase AmiC reveals the fold of the AMIN domain, a new peptidoglycan binding domain.Mol.

Williamson M.P. Molecular basis for bacterial peptidoglycan recognition by LysM domains.Nat. Commun. 2014; 5: 4269Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). We examined whether the NTF2 domain functions as a PG-binding domain that is synergistic with the LD-CPase domain for Pgp2 catalytic activity. A pull-down experiment was performed with Pgp243-325 and variants using Δpgp2 PG, which is rich in tetrapeptides. Wild-type Pgp2 was pulled down, demonstrating PG binding (Fig. S2A). Two catalytically inactive variants, C174S (Pgp2C174S) and H157A (Pgp2H157A), showed minimal association. The K307A variant (Pgp2K307A), a conserved residue within the pocket of the NTF2 domain, was also weakly associated, supporting a role for this binding pocket for appreciable PG interaction. Mutation of conserved Y233 in the NTF2 domain (Pgp2Y233F) was insufficient to disrupt the pull down of Pgp2 by PG. The removal of one hydroxyl group by replacement of tyrosine by phenylalanine was insufficient to substantively decrease PG binding. To investigate if the loss of PG binding by the Pgp2K307A was due to conformational change, the crystal structure of this variant was solved at 1.85 Å resolution (Table S1). The Pgp2K307A crystal structure contains two Pgp2K307A molecules in one asymmetric unit that superimposed with an RMSD of 0.7 Å over 281 Cα atoms. The fold of the Pgp2K307A is similar to that of wild-type Pgp2 (RMSD of 1.5 Å over 277 aligned Cα atoms). The largest deviation is located at residues 296–306 of strands β9–β10 (Fig. S3, A–C), which form a protruding lower lip of the NTF2 domain binding pocket. An overlay of the structures of Pgp2, Pgp2K307A, and H. pylori Csd6 (PDB ID: 4XZZ) showed that the conformation of lower lip is more similar between the latter two (Fig. S3, A–D). In the wild-type Pgp2 crystal structure, the average B-factor of β9-β10 (residues 292–310) was 53.4 Å2, 1.8-fold higher than the average B-factor over all residues. We conclude that β9–β10 is conformationally flexible and may allow variation in ligand specificity. To identify PG interaction sites by NMR spectroscopy, triple-labeled (2H-13 C-15N) Pgp243-325 was produced and used to obtain the assignments of 236 out of 287 expected main chain amide 1HN-15N signals (Fig. S4A). The unassigned residues include those in two loops (residues 167–173 and 238–253) for which conformational exchange may have led to resonance broadening. Although deuteration was required for resonance assignments of this 36 kDa protein, the 15N-BEST-TROSY-HSQC spectrum of 15N-labeled Pgp243-325 was of high quality (Fig. S4B), enabling titration experiments with panel of PG-derived ligands. Four PG ligand preparations for titration experiments were derived from digesting whole PG: a muramidase digestion of C. jejuni Δpgp2 PG, a DL-endopeptidase (Pseudomonas aeruginosa Tse1) digestion of Escherichia coli PG, HPLC-purified murotetrapeptide, and HPLC-purified cross-linked murotetrapeptides. The latter two ligands were treated with sodium borohydride before purification, which reduced the MurNAc residue. A fifth ligand was a synthesized peptide analogue (D-Glu-m-oxa-Dap-D-Ala) of the Pgp2 substrate (20Soni A.S. Lin C.S. Murphy M.E.P. Tanner M.E. Peptides containing meso-oxa-diaminopimelic acid as substrates for the cell-shape-determining proteases Csd6 and Pgp2.ChemBioChem. 2019; 20: 1591-1598PubMed Google Scholar). In general, the 1HN and 15N chemical shifts of many amides in Pgp2 changed progressively with added ligand (Fig. 4). This corresponds to the fast exchange regime on the chemical shift timescale (kex >> Δω, where kex is the interconversion rate constant and Δω is the chemical shift difference between free and bound states) and is indicative of relatively weak binding (28Kleckner I.R. Foster M.P. An introduction to NMR-based approaches for measuring protein dynamics.Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2011; 1814: 942-968Crossref PubMed Scopus (360) Google Scholar). Such a response enabled their signals to be followed over the course of the titration, and their chemical shift perturbations (CSPs) to be calculated as the square root of the sum of the squared 1HN and 15N chemical shift differences between the apo- versus ligand-bound protein at the titration end point (29Williamson M.P. Using chemical shift perturbation to characterise ligand binding.Prog. Nucl. Magn. Reson. Spectrosc. 2013; 73: 1-16Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (848) Google Scholar). To define residues most perturbed by ligand binding, a CSP cut-off was determined for each given titration based on the average CSP value for all residues, combined with patterns of clustering when mapped to the structure. In some cases, increasing linewidths and decreasing intensities of amide signals also occurre"

One such region is 8q22.2, which is largely unexplored in MIBC and could harbor genes with potential for outcome prediction or targeted therapy. To investigate the prognostic role of 8q22.2 and to compare different amplicon definitions, an in-silico analysis of 357 patients from The Cancer Genome Atlas, who underwent radical cystectomy for MIBC, was performed. Amplicons were generated using the GISTIC2.0 algorithm for copy number alterations (DNA_Amplicon) and z-score normalization for mRNA gene overexpression (RNA_Amplicon). Kaplan-Meier survival analysis, univariable, and multivariable Cox proportional hazard ratios were used to relate amplicons, genes, and clinical parameters to overall (OS) and disease-free survival (DFS). Analyses of the biological functions of 8q22.2 genes and genomic events in MIBC were performed to identify potential targets. Genes with prognostic significance from the in silico analysis were validated using RT-qPCR of MIBC tumor samples (n = 46). High 8q22.2 mRNA expression (RNA-AMP) was associated with lymph node metastases. Furthermore, 8q22.2 DNA and RNA amplified patients were more likely to show a luminal subtype (DNA_Amplicon_core: p = 0.029; RNA_Amplicon_core: p = 0.01). Overexpression of the 8q22.2 gene OSR2 predicted shortened DFS in univariable (HR [CI] 1.97 [1.2; 3.22]; p = 0.01) and multivariable in silico analysis (HR [CI] 1.91 [1.15; 3.16]; p = 0.01) and decreased OS (HR [CI] 6.25 [1.37; 28.38]; p = 0.0177) in RT-qPCR data analysis. Alterations in different levels of the 8q22.2 region are associated with manifestation of different clinical characteristics in MIBC. An in-depth comprehensive molecular characterization of genomic regions involved in cancer should include multiple genetic levels, such as DNA copy number alterations and mRNA gene expression, and could lead to a better molecular understanding. In this study, OSR2 is identified as a potential biomarker for survival prognosis."

Methods This retrospective study included 48 patients with unilateral RRD who underwent vitrectomy and SO tamponade and were stable after SO removal. Control data were obtained from the fellow healthy eye. Ophthalmic examinations, including best corrective visual acuity (BCVA) and OCTA, were conducted. Differences in vascular density (VD) in different sections of the macula and differences in the foveal avascular zone (FAZ) were analyzed between the affected eyes and control eyes. Subgroup analyses according to macular involvement were performed. Results Baseline BCVA and duration of SO tamponade were associated with postoperative BCVA (p&lt;0.001, p = 0.03, respectively). The average VD in the deep capillary plexus (DCP) and the VD of the nasal parafoveal area in both the superficial capillary plexus (SCP) and the DCP decreased relative to those in the control eyes (p = 0.026, p = 0.028, and p = 0.031, respectively). The FAZ area in the DCP and in the SCP also increased when compared with that in the controls (p = 0.043, p = 0.002, respectively). In addition, the macular-off RRD group had lower VD in the nasal parafoveal area of the DCP than the macular-on RRD group. Conclusion SO tamponade could cause microvascular changes, especially in the nasal parafoveal area. The macular-off RRD group were affected more than the macular-on RRD group."

We report trends in post-partum VL in Malawian women on ART and factors associated with detectable VL up to 24 months post-partum. Methods 1–6 months post-partum mothers, screened HIV-positive at outpatient clinics in Malawi, were enrolled (2014–2016) with their infants. At enrollment, 12- and 24-months post-partum socio-demographic and PMTCT indicators were collected. Venous samples were collected for determination of maternal VL (limit of detection 40 copies/ml). Results were returned to clinics for routine management. Results 596/1281 (46.5%) women were retained in the study to 24 months. Those retained were older (p&lt;0.01), had higher parity (p = 0.03) and more likely to have undetectable VL at enrollment than those lost to follow-up (80.0% vs 70.2%, p&lt;0.01). Of 590 women on ART (median 30.1 months; inter-quartile range 26.8–61.3), 442 (74.9%) with complete VL data at 3 visits were included in further analysis. Prevalence of detectable VL at 12 and 24 months was higher among women with detectable VL at enrollment than among those with undetectable VL (74 detectable VL results/66 women vs. 19/359; p&lt;0.001). In multivariable analysis (adjusted for age, parity, education, partner disclosure, timing of ART start and self-reported adherence), detectable VL at 24 months was 9 times more likely among women with 1 prior detectable VL (aOR 9.0; 95%CI 3.5–23.0, p&lt;0.001) and 226 times more likely for women with 2 prior detectable VLs (aOR 226.4; 95%CI 73.0–701.8, p&lt;0.001). Conclusions Detectable virus early post-partum strongly increases risk of ongoing post-partum viremia. Due to high loss to follow-up, the true incidence of detectable VL over time is probably underestimated. These findings have implications for MTCT, as well as for the mothers, and call for intensified VL monitoring and targeted adherence support for women during pregnancy and post-partum."

We characterised the temporal course of cardiac and non-cardiac outcomes associated with MI, acute and chronic myocardial injury. Methods We included all patients presenting to public emergency departments in South Australia between June 2011–Sept 2019. Episodes of care (EOCs) were classified into 5 groups based on high-sensitivity troponin-T (hs-cTnT) and diagnostic codes: 1) Acute MI [rise/fall in hs-cTnT and primary diagnosis of acute coronary syndrome], 2) Acute myocardial injury with coronary artery disease (CAD) [rise/fall in hs-cTnT and diagnosis of CAD], 3) Acute myocardial injury without CAD [rise/fall in hs-cTnT without diagnosis of CAD], 4) Chronic myocardial injury [elevated hs-cTnT without rise/fall], and 5) No myocardial injury. Multivariable flexible parametric models were used to characterize the temporal hazard of death, MI, heart failure (HF), and ventricular arrhythmia. Results 372,310 EOCs (218,878 individuals) were included: acute MI (19,052 [5.12%]), acute myocardial injury with CAD (6,928 [1.86%]), acute myocardial injury without CAD (32,231 [8.66%]), chronic myocardial injury (55,056 [14.79%]), and no myocardial injury (259,043 [69.58%]). We observed an early hazard of MI and HF after acute MI and acute myocardial injury with CAD. In contrast, subsequent MI risk was lower and more constant in patients with acute injury without CAD or chronic injury. All patterns of myocardial injury were associated with significantly higher risk of all-cause mortality and ventricular arrhythmia. Conclusions Different patterns of myocardial injury were associated with divergent profiles of subsequent cardiac and non-cardiac risk. The therapeutic approach and modifiability of such excess risks require further research."
https://openalex.org/W3134592663,"Accurate and robust segmentation of anatomical structures from magnetic resonance images is valuable in many computer-aided clinical tasks. Traditional codec networks are not satisfactory because of their low accuracy of edge segmentation, the low recognition rate of the target, and loss of detailed information. To address these problems, this study proposes a series of improved models for semantic segmentation and progressively optimizes them from the three aspects of convolution module, codec unit, and feature fusion. Instead of the standard convolution structure, we apply a new type of convolution module for the feature extraction. The networks integrate a multi-path method to obtain richer-detail edge information. Finally, a dense network is utilized to strengthen the ability of the feature fusion and integrate more different-level information. The evaluation of the Accuracy, Dice coefficient, and Jaccard index led to values of 0.9855, 0.9185, and 0.8507, respectively. These metrics of the best network increased by 1.0%, 4.0%, and 6.1%, respectively. Boundary F1-Score reached 0.9124 indicating that the proposed networks can segment smaller targets to obtain smoother edges. Our methods obtain more key information than traditional methods and achieve superiority in segmentation performance."

Here, we demonstrate that lymph node (LN) cells from B6-based donor mice carrying IL-6, TLR2, or TLR4 gene deletions were fully functional in inducing severe pancytopenia and bone marrow failure (BMF) when infused into MHC-mismatched CByB6F1 recipients. Conversely, B6-based recipient mice with IL-6, TLR2, and TLR4 deletion backgrounds were all susceptible to immune-mediated BMF relative to wild-type B6 recipients following infusion of MHC-mismatched LN cells from FVB donors, but the disease appeared more severe in IL-6 deficient mice. We conclude that IL-6, TLR2, and TLR4, molecular elements important in maintenance of normal innate immunity, have limited roles in a murine model of immune-mediated BMF. Rather, adaptive immunity appears to be the major contributor to the animal disease."
https://openalex.org/W3133802504,"Motor vehicle operation is a complicated task and substantial cognitive resources are required for safe driving. Experimental paradigms examining cognitive workload using driving simulators often introduce secondary tasks, such as mathematical exercises, or utilise simulated in-vehicle information systems. The effects of manipulating the demands of the primary driving task have not been examined in detail using advanced neuroimaging techniques. This study used a manipulation of the simulated driving environment to test the impact of increased driving complexity on brain activity. Fifteen participants drove in two scenarios reflecting common driving environments differing in the amount of vehicular traffic, frequency of intersections, number of buildings, and speed limit restrictions. Functional near infrared spectroscopy was used to quantify changes in cortical activity; fifty-five optodes were placed over the prefrontal and occipital cortices, commonly assessed areas during driving. Compared to baseline, both scenarios increased oxyhaemoglobin in the bilateral prefrontal cortex and cerebral blood volume in the right prefrontal cortex (all p ≤ 0.05). Deoxyhaemoglobin decreased at the bilateral aspects of the prefrontal cortex but overall tended to increase in the medial aspect during both scenarios (both p ≤ 0.05). Cerebral oxygen exchange significantly declined at the lateral aspects of the prefrontal cortex, with a small but significant increase seen in the medial aspect (both p &lt; 0.05). There were no significant differences for oxyhaemoglobin, deoxyhaemoglobin, or cerebral blood volume (all p &gt; 0.05). This study demonstrates that functional near infrared spectroscopy is capable of detecting changes in cortical activity elicited by simulated driving tasks but may be less sensitive to variations in driving workload aggregated over a longer duration."
https://openalex.org/W3134000191,"Purpose Age-related distance esotropia (ARDE) involves acquired esotropia at distance and phoria at near. However, distance-independent esotropia (DIE) exists esotropia both at distance and near. Thus, we examined the orbital magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) findings for DIE to assess differences in its characteristics. Methods This study was a retrospective case-control study. We evaluated the efficacy of the standard coronal MRI in patients with acquired esotropia and control patients with optic neuritis. Cases with strabismus in the control group were excluded. DIE was defined as having esotropia both at distance and near, and an angle of more than 10 prism diopters at near. The condition of the lateral rectus-superior rectus band, position of rectus muscles, and the volume ratio of the globe to the whole orbit (G/WO) were examined. Results The DIE group consisted of 12 eyes of 6 patients (77.3±7.7 years); ARDE group, 38 eyes of 19 patients (73.1±6.8 years); and control group, 34 eyes of 17 patients (70.9±4.3 years). The ratio of abnormality of the lateral rectus-superior rectus bands was higher in the DIE and ARDE groups than in the control group ( p &lt;0.01). The vertical angle of the lateral rectus deviated downwards in the control (-7.5±5.1°), ARDE (-12.2±9.1°), and DIE groups (-18.8±5.7°) ( p &lt;0.05). The tilting angle of the lateral rectus was tilted temporally in the control (-12.2±9.1°), ARDE (-20.0±8.6°) and DIE groups (-28.6±5.4°) ( p &lt;0.01). G/WO was higher in the DIE (0.28±0.01) and ARDE groups (0.27±0.02) compared to the control (0.25±0.03) group ( p &lt;0.01). Conclusion In comparison with the ARDE and control groups, the DIE group presented with abnormalities of the lateral rectus-superior rectus band, malposition of the lateral rectus, and differences in the G/WO. The DIE group showed a more severe form of ARDE."
https://openalex.org/W3135437845,"In recent years, high utility itemsets (HUIs) mining has been an active research topic in data mining. In this study, we propose two efficient pattern-growth based HUI mining algorithms, called High Utility Itemset based on Length and Tail-Node tree (HUIL-TN) and High Utility Itemset based on Tail-Node tree (HUI-TN). These two algorithms avoid the time-consuming candidate generation stage and the need of scanning the original dataset multiple times for exact utility values. A novel tree structure, named tail-node tree (TN-tree) is proposed as a key element of our algorithms to maintain complete utililty-information of existing itemsets of a dataset. The performance of HUIL-TN and HUI-TN was evaluated against state-of-the-art reference methods on various datasets. Experimental results showed that our algorithms exceed or close to the best performance on all datasets in terms of running time, while other algorithms can only excel in certain types of dataset. Scalability tests were also performed and our algorithms obtained the flattest curves among all competitors."
https://openalex.org/W3135790320,"Saccharomyces cerevisiae exhibits gene expression homeostasis, which is defined as the buffering of transcription levels against changes in DNA copy number during the S phase of the cell cycle. It has been suggested that S. cerevisiae employs an active mechanism to maintain gene expression homeostasis through Rtt109-Asf1-dependent acetylation of histone H3 on lysine 56 (H3K56). Here, we show that gene expression homeostasis can be achieved independently of H3K56 acetylation by Tos4 (Target of Swi6-4). Using Nanostring technology, we establish that Tos4-dependent gene expression homeostasis depends on its forkhead-associated (FHA) domain, which is a phosphopeptide recognition domain required to bind histone deacetylases (HDACs). We demonstrate that the mechanism of Tos4-dependent gene expression homeostasis requires its interaction with the Rpd3L HDAC complex. However, this is independent of Rpd3’s well-established roles in both histone deacetylation and controlling the DNA replication timing program, as established by deep sequencing of Fluorescence-Activated Cell Sorted (FACS) S and G2 phase populations.

Over the course of a cell division cycle, cells must double their cellular content, including their transcriptional output, to maintain cell size homeostasis over generations. It is generally thought that this increase in transcriptional output occurs gradually during the cell cycle, particularly as many cells exhibit a positive correlation between cell size and transcription rate (1Marguerat S. Bahler J. Coordinating genome expression with cell size.Trends Genet. 2012; 28: 560-565Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar, 2Vargas-Garcia C.A. Ghusinga K.R. Singh A. Cell size control and gene expression homeostasis in single-cells.Curr. Opin. Syst. Biol. 2018; 8: 109-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). S phase poses a challenge to cells due to the imbalance in gene copy number as a result of the gradual process of DNA replication (Fig. 1A), which could cause imbalanced transcription between replicated and unreplicated genes. Multiple bacterial species have been shown to exploit the increased copy number of newly replicated DNA by positioning specific genes close to their replication origin, so their transcript levels will increase upon replication (3Slager J. Veening J.W. Hard-wired control of bacterial processes by chromosomal gene location.Trends Microbiol. 2016; 24: 788-800Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Several recent studies have demonstrated that eukaryotic cells are able to buffer transcription of newly replicated genes during S phase, in both mammalian cells (4Chen Y. Li K. Chu X. Carey L.B.

Cell. 2018; 70: 1121-1133.e1129Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1B). This phenomenon is referred to as gene expression homeostasis, which ensures that transcript levels in S phase are not affected by a gene’s replication. In particular, it has been suggested that S. cerevisiae employs an active mechanism to maintain gene expression homeostasis through the histone acetyltransferase (HAT) Rtt109 and its cofactor Asf1 (7Voichek Y. Bar-Ziv R. Barkai N. Expression homeostasis during DNA replication.Science. 2016; 351: 1087-1090Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar), which together acetylate histone H3 on lysine 56 (H3K56) (9Schneider J. Bajwa P. Johnson F.C. Bhaumik S.R. Shilatifard A. Rtt109 is required for proper H3K56 acetylation: A chromatin mark associated with the elongating RNA polymerase II.J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 37270-37274Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). While it is clear that loss of Rtt109, Asf1, or H3K56ac perturbs gene expression homeostasis, these factors are also required for replication-coupled nucleosome assembly, ensuring that histones are appropriately deposited on newly replicated DNA (10Serra-Cardona A. Zhang Z. Replication-coupled nucleosome assembly in the passage of epigenetic information and cell identity.Trends Biochem. Sci. 2018; 43: 136-148Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Cells lacking H3K56ac have been shown to exhibit impaired nucleosome assembly on newly replicated genes, and it has been proposed that this may increase transcription, indirectly perturbing gene expression homeostasis (11Topal S.

Commun. 2019; 10: 4372Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). This suggests that while loss of acetylation of H3K56 results in loss of gene expression homeostasis, it is not necessarily the molecular mechanism by which gene expression is achieved. In addition, cells lacking Rtt109, Asf1, or H3K56ac exhibit sensitivity to DNA-damaging agents, replication stress, and cell cycle delays (12Ramey C.J. Howar S. Adkins M. Linger J. Spicer J.

Yeast Rtt109 promotes genome stability by acetylating histone H3 on lysine 56.Science. 2007; 315: 649-652Crossref PubMed Scopus (342) Google Scholar), but this is more likely a result of impaired replication-coupled nucleosome assembly rather than loss of gene expression homeostasis. Another regulator of gene expression homeostasis in S. cerevisiae, Tos4 (Target of Swi6-4), was recently identified, but its contribution to gene expression homeostasis has thus far not been explored (7Voichek Y. Bar-Ziv R. Barkai N. Expression homeostasis during DNA replication.Science. 2016; 351: 1087-1090Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Tos4 is a nuclear FHA domain-containing protein (16Sundin B.A. Chiu C.H. Riffle M. Davis T.N. Muller E.G. Localization of proteins that are coordinately expressed with Cln2 during the cell cycle.Yeast. 2004; 21: 793-800Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar) that is expressed as part of the G1/S transcriptional wave (17Bastos de Oliveira F.M.

Linking DNA replication checkpoint to MBF cell-cycle transcription reveals a distinct class of G1/S genes.EMBO J. 2012; 31: 1798-1810Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). The cell employs multiple mechanisms to restrict the presence of Tos4 protein to S phase, including G1/S transcriptional regulation by both the SBF and MBF transcription factor complexes, and degradation by the APCCdh1 complex and the SCF complex (16Sundin B.A. Chiu C.H.

Solomon M.J. Identification of anaphase promoting complex substrates in S. cerevisiae.PLoS One. 2012; 7e45895Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1C). The targeted degradation by the SCF complex is mediated by CDK-dependent phosphorylation (18Landry B.D. Mapa C.E. Arsenault H.E. Poti K.E. Benanti J.A. Regulation of a transcription factor network by Cdk1 coordinates late cell cycle gene expression.EMBO J. 2014; 33: 1044-1060Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Interestingly, Tos4 is one of only a limited number of CDK targets that can be phosphorylated by G1 and M phase cyclin-CDK complexes (Cln2, Clb2, and Clb3), but not S phase cyclin (Clb5) CDK complexes (20Koivomagi M. Valk E. Venta R. Iofik A. Lepiku M. Morgan D.O. Loog M. Dynamics of Cdk1 substrate specificity during the cell cycle.Mol. Cell. 2011; 42: 610-623Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar), further ensuring Tos4’s restriction to only S phase. Additionally, it is significantly upregulated at both the protein and mRNA levels in response to replication stress, which prolongs the time spent in S phase (17Bastos de Oliveira F.M. Harris M.R. Brazauskas P. de Bruin R.A. Smolka M.B. Linking DNA replication checkpoint to MBF cell-cycle transcription reveals a distinct class of G1/S genes.EMBO J. 2012; 31: 1798-1810Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). These findings together indicate an important role for Tos4 in S phase. Deleting TOS4 alongside DUN1, which encodes a replication stress checkpoint kinase (21Huang M. Zhou Z. Elledge S.J. The DNA replication and damage checkpoint pathways induce transcription by inhibition of the Crt1 repressor.Cell. 1998; 94: 595-605Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (420) Google Scholar), causes hypersensitivity to hydroxyurea (HU), a replication stress-inducing agent (17Bastos de Oliveira F.M.

Linking DNA replication checkpoint to MBF cell-cycle transcription reveals a distinct class of G1/S genes.EMBO J. 2012; 31: 1798-1810Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). This suggests that Tos4 may have an important role during a prolonged S phase; however, the role of Tos4 has not been established. Interestingly, Tos4 interacts with two histone deacetylase (HDAC) complexes, Rpd3L and Set3c, through its FHA domain (17Bastos de Oliveira F.M. Harris M.R. Brazauskas P. de Bruin R.A. Smolka M.B.

Chromatin central: Towards the comparative proteome by accurate mapping of the yeast proteomic environment.Genome Biol. 2008; 9R167Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). A Tos4 FHA mutant exhibits the same synthetic sickness in HU when combined with a DUN1 deletion (17Bastos de Oliveira F.M. Harris M.R. Brazauskas P. de Bruin R.A. Smolka M.B. Linking DNA replication checkpoint to MBF cell-cycle transcription reveals a distinct class of G1/S genes.EMBO J. 2012; 31: 1798-1810Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar), suggesting that its role during S phase depends on its interaction with these HDAC complexes. While an initial study suggested that Tos4 functions as a transcription factor (23Horak C.E. Luscombe N.M. Qian J. Bertone P. Piccirrillo S. Gerstein M. Snyder M. Complex transcriptional circuitry at the G1/S transition in Saccharomyces cerevisiae.Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 3017-3033Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar), there is no evidence to support this. A recent study showed no substantial changes to transcript levels in cells lacking Tos4 (24Lenstra T.L. Benschop J.J. Kim T. Schulze J.M. Brabers N.A. Margaritis T. van de Pasch L.A. van Heesch S.A. Brok M.O. Groot Koerkamp M.J. Ko C.W. van Leenen D. Sameith K. van Hooff S.R. Lijnzaad P. et al.The specificity and topology of chromatin interaction pathways in yeast.Mol. Cell. 2011; 42: 536-549Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar), and we and others have been unable to isolate chromatin-bound Tos4, either at suggested target sites via quantitative PCR ChIP (chromatin immunoprecipitation) or genome-wide via ChIP-CHIP analysis (unpublished data and personal communication J. Bahler). Here we investigate the function and mechanisms of Tos4 in gene expression homeostasis. We show that Tos4 is not required to maintain H3K56ac or for survival in conditions of genotoxic stress, indicating an independent function to Rtt109 and Asf1. We show that Tos4 mediates gene expression homeostasis through its FHA domain, which is required for Tos4’s interaction with the Rpd3L and Set3c histone deacetylase complexes. In addition, we demonstrate a contribution of Rpd3 to gene expression homeostasis, which is independent of its role in histone deacetylation and regulation of DNA replication timing. Loss of Rtt109, Asf1, or Tos4 results in loss of gene expression homeostasis (7Voichek Y. Bar-Ziv R. Barkai N. Expression homeostasis during DNA replication.Science. 2016; 351: 1087-1090Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). The HAT Rtt109 and its cofactor Asf1 are responsible for acetylation on H3K56 on newly synthesized histones, which has been proposed as a molecular mechanism for gene expression homeostasis. Tos4 interacts with two HDAC complexes so may also regulate H3K56 acetylation status to maintain gene expression homeostasis. We therefore tested if Tos4 is required for normal H3K56ac dynamics. H3K56 is acetylated on newly synthesized histones in S phase and removed upon S phase completion (14Masumoto H. Hawke D. Kobayashi R. Verreault A. A role for cell-cycle-regulated histone H3 lysine 56 acetylation in the DNA damage response.Nature. 2005; 436: 294-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (485) Google Scholar), and deletion of RTT109 or ASF1 results in loss of H3K56ac (9Schneider J. Bajwa P. Johnson F.C. Bhaumik S.R. Shilatifard A. Rtt109 is required for proper H3K56 acetylation: A chromatin mark associated with the elongating RNA polymerase II.J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 37270-37274Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). To test H3K56ac levels at different points in the cell cycle, we collected samples from cells arrested in G1 phase with the mating pheromone α-factor, cells released from α-factor for 45 min (representing S phase), and cells arrested in S phase using the replication stress-inducing agent HU. As previously established (14Masumoto H. Hawke D. Kobayashi R. Verreault A. A role for cell-cycle-regulated histone H3 lysine 56 acetylation in the DNA damage response.Nature. 2005; 436: 294-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (485) Google Scholar), wild-type cells exhibit increased H3K56ac in S phase and during replication stress compared with a G1 arrest (Fig. 1D). No H3K56ac is observed in rtt109Δ cells, as expected. However, the tos4Δ mutant does not affect H3K56ac, showing very similar levels to those observed in wild-type cells. This shows that Tos4 is not required for proper regulation of H3K56ac and therefore controls gene expression homeostasis in a mechanism independent of H3K56 acetylation status. Previous studies have shown that Rtt109, Asf1, and H3K56 acetylation are required to maintain genome integrity. Cells lacking these proteins exhibit hypersensitivity to genotoxic agents, such as Camptothecin (CPT) and methyl methanesulfonate (MMS) (15Driscoll R. Hudson A. Jackson S.P. Yeast Rtt109 promotes genome stability by acetylating histone H3 on lysine 56.Science. 2007; 315: 649-652Crossref PubMed Scopus (342) Google Scholar, 25Li Q. Zhou H. Wurtele H. Davies B.

Acetylation of histone H3 lysine 56 regulates replication-coupled nucleosome assembly.Cell. 2008; 134: 244-255Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar). We therefore tested the sensitivity of the tos4Δ mutant to these genotoxic agents. Unlike the rtt109Δ and asf1Δ mutants, the tos4Δ mutant shows similar growth to wild-type cells (Fig. 1E). This suggests that the increased sensitivity to genotoxic stress observed upon loss of Rtt109 and Asf1 is unlikely a consequence of impaired gene expression homeostasis. This indicates that studying Tos4 is therefore more likely to be specific to establishing the biological relevance of maintaining gene expression homeostasis. Our work shows that Tos4 does not regulate H3K56ac in S. cerevisiae, yet it was previously shown that Tos4 is required for gene expression homeostasis (7Voichek Y. Bar-Ziv R. Barkai N. Expression homeostasis during DNA replication.Science. 2016; 351: 1087-1090Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). It is therefore likely that Tos4-dependent gene expression homeostasis is mediated through a parallel pathway to Rtt109 and Asf1. In order to study Tos4’s mechanism in gene expression homeostasis, we sought to precisely quantify the mRNA levels of representative early- and late-replicating genes in a synchronous sample. In order to obtain a synchronized cell cycle population, cells were arrested in G1 phase using α-factor and released synchronously. Samples were collected every 5 min in S phase and early G2. In order to check synchronous cell cycle progression, the DNA content was analyzed by flow cytometry (Fig. 2A). Additionally, transcript levels of well-characterized periodically transcribed genes (26Spellman P.T. Sherlock G. Zhang M.Q. Iyer V.R. Anders K. Eisen M.B. Brown P.O. Botstein D. Futcher B. Comprehensive identification of cell cycle-regulated genes of the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae by microarray hybridization.Mol. Biol. Cell. 1998; 9: 3273-3297Crossref PubMed Scopus (3896) Google Scholar) were verified by RT-qPCR (Fig. 2B and Fig. S1). We used Nanostring technology to quantify the mRNA levels of early- and late-replicating genes. This technique counts the number of molecules of many specific mRNAs in one sample directly, without relying on reverse transcription or amplification, and is therefore highly quantitative (27Geiss G.K. Bumgarner R.E. Birditt B. Dahl T. Dowidar N. Dunaway D.L. Fell H.P. Ferree S. George R.D. Grogan T. James J.J. Maysuria M. Mitton J.D. Oliveri P.

Very early- or late-replicating genes were selected, which have relatively constant transcript levels across the cell cycle, and relatively short transcript half-lives, based on data from multiple studies (28Feng W.

Kitada K. Mapping of early firing origins on a replication profile of budding yeast.Genes Cell. 2002; 7: 781-789Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar) (Table S2). Firstly, wild-type samples were subject to analysis by Nanostring technology. The mRNA levels of cyclic genes were also established by RT-qPCR to compare with quantification by Nanostring, and highly similar expression dynamics were observed (Fig. 2B). We used Nanostring to quantify the expression levels of 14 early-replicating and 13 late-replicating genes. These values were firstly normalized to 25 min, representing late G1, and subsequently the average of all early- or late-replicating genes was calculated. The average late-replicating gene expression levels were then normalized to the average early-replicating gene levels, to obtain the early:late ratio. As previously reported (7Voichek Y. Bar-Ziv R. Barkai N. Expression homeostasis during DNA replication.Science. 2016; 351: 1087-1090Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar), the early:late ratio remains relatively constant throughout the cell cycle, demonstrating gene expression homeostasis. This ratio does deviate slightly from 1 and actually undergoes a small increase in late S phase, peaking at 1.1 at 55 min. This minor increase is similar to the previously published work (7Voichek Y. Bar-Ziv R. Barkai N. Expression homeostasis during DNA replication.Science. 2016; 351: 1087-1090Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). The same analysis was carried out for the tos4Δ mutant. Unlike wild-type cells, the tos4Δ mutant exhibits a substantial increase in the early:late ratio, which peaks at 1.36 at 50 min, demonstrating a loss of gene expression homeostasis as previously observed (7Voichek Y. Bar-Ziv R. Barkai N. Expression homeostasis during DNA replication.Science. 2016; 351: 1087-1090Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Although the previous study used RNA-seq, the authors also observed a similar peak in early:late ratio of approximately 1.4 in mutants lacking gene expression homeostasis (tos4Δ, rtt109Δ, and asf1Δ), suggesting there is good concordance between the two techniques. Published work from our group showed that Tos4’s role in replication stress tolerance, in the absence of the checkpoint transcriptional regulator Dun1, is dependent on its FHA domain, which mediates its interaction with the HDAC complexes Set3c and Rpd3L (17Bastos de Oliveira F.M. Harris M.R. Brazauskas P. de Bruin R.A. Smolka M.B. Linking DNA replication checkpoint to MBF cell-cycle transcription reveals a distinct class of G1/S genes.EMBO J. 2012; 31: 1798-1810Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). We therefore tested if loss of gene expression homeostasis is also observed in the Tos4-FHAΔ mutant, characterized in our previous study in which just two amino acids (R122 and N161) have been mutated to alanine. The Tos4-FHAΔ mutant exhibits a highly similar loss of gene expression homeostasis to the tos4Δ mutant, indicating that Tos4’s role in gene expression homeostasis depends upon its interaction with the HDACs. Our data indicates that while Tos4 does not regulate H3K56ac, its FHA domain, required for its interaction with HDACs, is essential for its role in gene expression homeostasis. This suggests that Tos4 might mediate gene expression homeostasis through regulating the acetylation status at other histone lysine residues. Its interacting HDAC complexes, Rpd3L and Set3c, have been implicated in deacetylation of other lysine residues on histones H3 and H4 (33Kim T. Xu Z. Clauder-Munster S. Steinmetz L.M. Buratowski S.

H3 lysine 4 is acetylated at active gene promoters and is regulated by H3 lysine 4 methylation.PLoS Genet. 2011; 7e1001354Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). We therefore tested if the acetylation status of other lysine residues on H3 or H4 is affected in a tos4Δ mutant. We carried out a cell cycle time course after release from α-factor, as we would expect a change in the acetylation status specifically during S phase. We do not observe a significant difference in the acetylation of the lysine residues tested (Fig. 3). This suggests that the mechanism of Tos4-dependent gene expression homeostasis is unlikely through modulation of histone acetylation. We have shown that Tos4’s role in gene expression homeostasis depends upon its FHA domain, which is required for interaction with HDACs. The HDAC Rpd3 has been proposed to have a role in the regulation of the DNA replication timing program (37Aparicio J.G. Viggiani C.J. Gibson D.G. Aparicio O.M.

The histone deacetylases sir2 and rpd3 act on ribosomal DNA to control the replication program in budding yeast.Mol. Cell. 2014; 54: 691-697Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Based on this, Tos4, through its regulation of HDAC complexes, could reduce an imbalance in gene expression of early and late-replicating genes by limiting the time window between the firing of early and late origins. If this contributes to the mechanism regulating gene expression homeostasis, then loss of Tos4 would cause early origins to fire earlier and late origins to fire later. To test if Tos4 helps maintain DNA replication timing, we characterized the DNA replication timing program in a tos4Δ mutant strain using sort-seq (40Batrakou D.G. Muller C.A. Wilson R.H.C. Nieduszynski C.A. DNA copy-number measurement of genome replication dynamics by high-throughput sequencing: The sort-seq, sync-seq and MFA-seq family.Nat. Protoc. 2020; 15: 1255-1284Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Exponentially growing asynchronous cells were sorted into S phase or G2 phase by FACS. DNA was then extracted from these cells and subjected to deep sequencing. The S phase DNA copy number was compared with the G2 copy number to infer relative replication timing. The tos4Δ mutant shows no substantial changes in the timing program compared with wild-type (Fig. 4), demonstrating that Tos4’s mechanism in gene expression homeostasis does not involve regulation of DNA replication timing. The data presented here indicates that Tos4 regulates gene expression homeostasis through interaction with HDAC complexes via its FHA domain. Since Tos4 has been shown by our group and others to interact with the HDACs Rpd3 large complex (Rpd3L) and Set3 complex (17Bastos de Oliveira F.M. Harris M.R. Brazauskas P. de Bruin R.A. Smolka M.B.

https://openalex.org/W3133975366,"Background Deep brain stimulation of the subthalamic nucleus (STN-DBS) is a recognized treatment in Parkinson’s disease (PD). Knowledge is still limited regarding the possible impact of STN-DBS on personality traits and the personality characteristics of PD patients who undergo surgery. Methods To assess personality traits in relation to STN-DBS we did an ancillary protocol as part of a prospective randomized study that compared two surgical strategies. Patients were assessed with the Temperament and Character Inventory (TCI), the Urgency, Premeditation, Perseverance and Sensation Seeking impulse behavior scale, the Eysenck Personality Questionnaire (EPQ) and the Toronto Alexithymia Scale preoperatively and after one year of STN-DBS. EPQ and TCI baseline scores were compared with mean scores of healthy reference populations. Results After 12-months of STN-DBS, there was a significant decline in Persistence compared to baseline. Preoperatively, the STN-DBS patients had significantly lower Persistence and Self-Transcendence scores, and significantly higher scores on Novelty-Seeking, Self-Directedness, Cooperativeness and on Social Conformity than referenced populations. No difference was found in Neuroticism or Harm-Avoidance scores. The baseline prevalence of alexithymia was low and at 1-year follow-up there was no significant change in alexithymia scores. Conclusions We found a higher baseline level of impulsivity in PD patients who underwent STN-DBS. After one year of STN-DBS, our results indicated that the treatment may affect the patients’ personality by increasing certain aspects of impulsivity. There was no effect on alexithymia. The preoperative personality profile of PD patients might influence the outcome of STN-DBS."
https://openalex.org/W3133658308,"Introduction To determine the prognostic significance of long-term adjuvant androgen deprivation therapy (A-ADT) over 1 year in achieving undetectable levels of prostate-specific antigen (PSA) less than 0.001 ng/mL in prostate cancer patients with high- or very high-risk prostate cancer who underwent radiotherapy (RT). Materials and methods A total of 197 patients with prostate cancer received RT, with a follow-up of ≥12 months. Biochemical failure was defined as PSA ≥nadir + 2 ng/mL after RT. We analyzed clinical outcomes, including survival, failure patterns, and prognostic factors affecting outcomes. Results Biochemical failure-free survival (BCFFS), clinical failure-free survival, distant metastasis-free survival, cancer-specific survival, and overall survival (OS) rates at 5 years were 91.1%, 95.4%, 96.9%, 99.5%, and 89.1%, respectively. Administration of long-term A-ADT significantly predicted favorable BCFFS ( p = 0.027) and OS ( p &lt; 0.001) in multivariate analysis. Nadir PSA ≤0.001 ng/mL was an independent prognostic factor for BCFFS ( p = 0.006) and OS ( p = 0.021). The use of long-term A-ADT significantly affected nadir PSA ≤0.001 ng/mL ( p &lt; 0.001). The patients with A-ADT for 1 year or longer had better BCFFS or OS than those for less than 1 year or those without A-ADT ( p &lt; 0.001). The best prognosis was demonstrated in patients treated with long-term A-ADT and nadir PSA ≤0.001 ng/mL in BCFFS ( p &lt; 0.001). Conclusion The addition of long-term A-ADT over 1 year to RT demonstrated good treatment outcomes in patients with locally advanced prostate cancer. Achieving a nadir PSA value ≤0.001 ng/mL using combination therapy with RT and A-ADT is a powerful clinical predictor of treatment outcomes."
