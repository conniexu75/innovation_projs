Here we describe a new ligand in this family, designated TWEAK. The mouse and human versions of this protein are unusually conserved with 93% amino acid identity in the receptor binding domain. The protein was efficiently secreted from cells indicating that, like TNF, TWEAK may have the long range effects of a secreted cytokine. TWEAK transcripts were abundant and found in many tissues, suggesting that TWEAK and TRAIL belong to a new group of widely expressed ligands. Like many members of the TNF family, TWEAK was able to induce interleukin-8 synthesis in a number of cell lines. The human adenocarcinoma cell line, HT29, underwent apoptosis in the presence of both TWEAK and interferon-γ. Thus, TWEAK resembles many other TNF ligands in the capacity to induce cell death; however, the fact that TWEAK-sensitive cells are relatively rare suggests that TWEAK along with lymphotoxins α/β and possibly CD30L trigger death via a weaker, nondeath domain-dependent mechanism.

Members of this family act either locally through direct cell-to-cell contact or as secreted proteins capable of diffusing to more distant targets. These proteins are synthesized as type II membrane proteins with the extracellular C-terminal region mediating binding to the receptors of the TNF receptor (TNF-R) family (1Smith C.A. Farrah T.

The TNF family of ligands and receptors comprises at least 14 unique signaling pathways including TNF, lymphotoxins (LT), Fas, CD27, CD30, CD40, 4–1BB, OX-40, TRAMP (also DR3, WSL-1, Apo-3), CAR-1, TRAIL, GITR, HVEM, osteoprotegerin, and NGF (2Chinnaiyan A.M.

Excluding NGF, each of these signaling pathways is likely to be involved in critical functions related to both the function and development of the immune system. For example, TNF acts primarily as an inflammatory cytokine coordinating host defenses in response to aggression by pathogens by activating a wide range of immunological and non-immunological mechanisms (13Vassalli P. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1992; 10: 411-452Crossref PubMed Scopus (1798) Google Scholar). The LT system is involved in the development of the peripheral lymphoid organs and the organization of splenic architecture (14De Togni P. Goellner J. Ruddle N.H. Streeter P.R. Fick A. Mariathasan S.

CD40 is a key element in the regulation of the immunoglobulin response (16Foy T.M. Aruffo A. Bajorath J. Buhlmann J.E. Noelle R.J. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1996; 14: 591-617Crossref PubMed Scopus (571) Google Scholar), and Fas signaling has been implicated in the mechanisms controlling peripheral tolerance and thymic selection (17Nagata S.

Other members such as OX-40, 4–1BB, CD27, and CD30 are also involved in the control of various aspects of the immune system (19Strueber E. Strober W. J. Exp.

Cell. 1997; 88: 355-365Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4536) Google Scholar). Clearly, Fas and possibly TNF-R55 and CD30 activation can induce cell death in nontransformed lymphocytes, which may play an immunoregulatory function (22Amakawa R. Hakem A. Kundig T.M. Matsuyama T.

Immunity. 1996; 5: 17-30Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar). In general, death is triggered following the aggregation of death domains that reside on the cytoplasmic side of the TNF receptors. The death domain orchestrates the assembly of various signal transduction components that result in the activation of the caspase cascade (23Nagata S. Cell. 1997; 88: 355-365Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4536) Google Scholar). Some receptors lack canonical death domains, e.g. LTβ receptor and CD30 (26Browning J.L. Miatkowski K. Sizing I. Griffiths D. Zafari M. Benjamin C.D. Meier W. Mackay F. J. Exp. Med. 1996; 183: 867-878Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar, 27Lee S.Y. Park C.G. Choi Y. J. Exp. Med. 1996; 183: 669-674Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar), yet can induce cell death, albeit more weakly. It is likely that these receptors function primarily to induce cell differentiation in vivo and the death is an aberrant consequence in some transformed cell lines, although this picture is unclear, as studies on the CD30 null mouse suggest a role in death during negative selection in the thymus (22Amakawa R. Hakem A. Kundig T.M. Matsuyama T. Simard J.J.L. Timms E. Wakeham A. Mittruecker H.-W. Griesser H. Takimoto H. Schmits R. Shahinian A. Ohashi P.S. Penninger J.M. Mak T.W.

Conversely, signaling through other pathways such as CD40 is required to maintain cell survival.In this paper, we describe the mouse and human versions of a new member of this family, which we have called TWEAK. Like TNF, TWEAK is readily secreted from cells. Furthermore, we have prepared a recombinant soluble form of the molecule and used it to show that TWEAK signaling can induce cell death in an adenocarcinoma cell line.DISCUSSIONThis paper describes the molecular cloning, expression, and biological activity of a new member of the TNF family. Both the murine and human TWEAK proteins exhibit all the characteristics of this family, i.e. a type II membrane protein organization and conservation of the sequence motifs involved in the folding of the protein into the TNF anti-parallel β-sheet structure. All members of the TNF ligand family are believed to be compact trimers, and our biochemical analysis of TWEAK is consistent with this quaternary structure. A striking feature of TWEAK is the extensive sequence conservation of the receptor binding domain between mouse and man, and only the Fas ligand approaches this level of conservation. It is enticing to speculate that this sequence conservation reflects a critical functional role for TWEAK. Within the genome, both ligands and receptors in this family are often found in clusters of genes; however, the TWEAK gene does not lie within any known cluster, nor is it in a region with known disease linkage.TNF family members can best be described as master switches in the immune system controlling both cell survival and differentiation, although the recent description of bone density regulation by the TNF family member osteoprotegerin certainly suggests broader roles (12Simonet W.S. Lacey D.L. Dunstan C.R. Kelley M. Chang M.-S. Luethy R. Nguyen H.Q. Wooden S. Bennett L. Boone T. Shimamoto G. DeRose M. Elliot R. Colombero A. Tan H.-L. Trail G. Sullivan J. Davy E. Bucay N. Renshaw-Gegg L. Hughes T.M. Hill D. Pattison W. Campbell P. Sander S. Van G. Tarpley J. Derby P. Lee R. Boyle W.J. Cell. 1997; 89: 309-319Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4299) Google Scholar). There may be some clues to TWEAK's functional role from the limited characterization presented here. Only TNF and LTα and possibly Fas ligand are currently recognized as secreted cytokines, contrasting with the other predominantly membrane anchored members. While a membrane form of TNF has been well characterized and is likely to have a unique biological role, secreted TNF functions as a general alarm signaling to cells more distant from the site of the triggering event. Thus, TNF secretion can amplify a primary inflammatory event leading to the well described changes in the vascular lining and and consequent cell trafficking. In contrast, the membrane-bound members of the family send signals through the TNF type receptors only to cells in direct contact. For example T cells probably provide CD40-mediated “help” only to those B cells brought into contact via cognate interactions. The fact that TWEAK appears to be efficiently secreted suggests that its role will resemble that of TNF, i.e. to provide a long range signal. The presence of a possible AU-rich motif may indicate involvement in host defense.TWEAK RNA is abundantly expressed in many organs in a pattern reminiscent of TRAIL (5Wiley S.R. Schooley K. Smolak P.J. Din W.S. Huang C.-P. Nicholl J.K. Sutherland G.R. Smith T.D. Rauch C. Smith C.A. Goodwin R.G. Immunity. 1995; 3: 673-682Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2636) Google Scholar). Other TNF family members are typically more difficult to detect in tissue Northern blots, e.g. CD40 ligand or TNF, where expression is limited to very specific circumstances. While TWEAK RNA is abundant, it remains to be seen if protein expression is equally abundant. TWEAK and TRAIL expression patterns suggest more constitutive functions for these TNF family members, possibly indicating that they form a subclass within the family. The relative lack of TWEAK expression in hematopoietically derived tumor lines also points to a divergence from the standard TNF family ligand, which is typically expressed in lymphoid cells.TWEAK can induce chemokine secretion, which is likely to be a common feature of members of the TNF family. Chemokine regulation by TNF members may underlie several key aspects of their biology as is well described for TNF (38Degli-Esposti M. Davis-Smith T. Din W.S. Smolak P.J. Goodwin R.G. Smith C.A. J. Immunol. 1997; 158: 1756-1762PubMed Google Scholar, 39Abreu-Martin M.T. Vidrich A. Lynch D.H. Targan S.R. J. Immunol. 1995; 155: 4147-4154PubMed Google Scholar), but may also extend to the LT system and BRL-1-interacting chemokines (40Forster R. Mattis A.E. Kremmer E. Wolf E. Brem G. Lipp M. Cell. 1996; 87: 1037-1047Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (951) Google Scholar). The ability to induce programmed cell death is also an important and well studied feature of several members of the TNF family. Fas-mediated apoptosis appears to play a role in the regulation of autoreactive lymphocytes in the periphery and possibly the thymus (18Castro J.E. Listman J.A. Jacobson B.A. Wang Y. Lopez P.A. Ju S. Finn P.W. Perkins D.L. Immunity. 1996; 5: 617-627Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar, 23Nagata S. Cell. 1997; 88: 355-365Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4536) Google Scholar), and recent work has also implicated the TNF and CD30 systems in the survival of T cells and large cell anaplastic lymphoma lines (22Amakawa R. Hakem A. Kundig T.M. Matsuyama T. Simard J.J.L. Timms E. Wakeham A. Mittruecker H.-W. Griesser H. Takimoto H. Schmits R. Shahinian A. Ohashi P.S. Penninger J.M. Mak T.W.

Blood. 1994; 83: 2045-2056Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). TWEAK induced cell death in a human adenocarcinoma cell line, HT29. We and others had previously shown that the death of this line in response to TNF, Fas, or LTβ receptor signaling has the features of apoptosis (26Browning J.L. Miatkowski K. Sizing I. Griffiths D. Zafari M. Benjamin C.D. Meier W. Mackay F. J. Exp. Med. 1996; 183: 867-878Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar, 39Abreu-Martin M.T. Vidrich A. Lynch D.H. Targan S.R. J. Immunol. 1995; 155: 4147-4154PubMed Google Scholar) and the death induced by TWEAK was similar to that triggered by Fas or TNF receptor activation. In contrast to the broad spectrum of Fas ligand- or TRAIL-sensitive cells, other TWEAK-sensitive cells were not readily found, and this pattern is similar to that described for LTβ receptor activation. Whether TWEAK has a function similar to Fas remains to be seen; however, the inability to kill the sensitive Jurkat and SKW 6.4 lines suggests that regulation of lymphocyte death or survival is not its role. LTβ receptor activation can induce growth arrest in some cell lines (38Degli-Esposti M. Davis-Smith T. Din W.S. Smolak P.J. Goodwin R.G. Smith C.A. J. Immunol. 1997; 158: 1756-1762PubMed Google Scholar), and our studies on the effects of LTβ receptor activation on the growth of tumors in vivo are also consistent with growth arrest as opposed to direct cell death. 4F. Mackay and J. Browning, unpublished observations. For these reasons, TWEAK is likely to induce cell differentiation in vivo and probably not cell death.It is possible to segregate the TNF receptor pairs into three groups based on their ability to induce cell death (TableIII). First, TNF-R55, Fas, TRAIL-RI (DR4), TRAIL-RII (DR5), and TRAMP (DR3/WSL-1/Apo-3) receptors can efficiently induce cell death in many lines, and these receptors have canonical death domains (8Pan G.

Cell. 1997; 88: 355-365Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4536) Google Scholar). Next, there are those receptors that trigger a weaker death signal limited to a few cell types; the TWEAK, CD30, LTβ, and possibly the TNF-R75 (42Medvedev A.E. Sundan A. Espevik T. Eur. J. Immunol. 1994; 24: 2842-2849Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 43Grell M. Zimmermann G. Hulser D. Pfizenmaier K. Scheurich P. J. Immunol. 1994; 153: 1963-1972PubMed Google Scholar) and CD27 receptors (44Prasad K.V.S. Ao Z. Yoon Y. Wu M.X. Rizk M. Jacquot S. Schlossman S.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 6346-6351Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar) are examples of this class. Finally, there are those members that cannot efficiently deliver a death signal, and the possibility must be considered that these receptors have simply not been studied as well. Probably all groups can exhibit antiproliferative effects on some cell types consequent to inducing cell differentiation,e.g. CD40 (45Funakoshi S. Longo D.L. Beckwith M. Conley D.K. Tsarfaty G. Tsarfaty I. Armitage R.J. Fanslow W.C. Spriggs M.K. Murphy W.J.

Open table in a new tab How the “weak death” group can trigger cell death in the absence of a canonical death domain is an interesting question and prompts speculation that an alternative entry point into the death-inducing caspase cascade exists. Specifically, in the case of HT29 cells, why does receptor signaling lead to death only in the presence of IFNγ? It is possible that these weak death receptors may activate the conventional death domain-mediated pathways via induction of the expression of Fas and Fas ligand or other receptor/ligands in the strong death group. In support of this concept, Fas expression is known to be up-regulated by IFNγ on HT29 cells, and the expression of Fas ligand by tumor lines as a possible immune surveillance escape mechanism has been described (46Yonehara S. Ishii A. Yonehara M. J. Exp. Med. 1989; 169: 1747-1756Crossref PubMed Scopus (1422) Google Scholar, 47Strand S. Hofmann W.J. Hug H. Mueller M. Otto G. Strand D. Mariani S.M. Stremmel W. Krammer P.H.

Cerottini J.-C. Tschopp J. Science. 1996; 274: 1363-1366Crossref PubMed Scopus (1191) Google Scholar), although the anti-hFas-L blocking antibody, NOK-1, did not affect cell death in this system (data not shown). We have also observed that activation of the LTβ receptor can potentiate TNF signaling possibly reflecting favorable cross-talk between signaling pathways (26Browning J.L. Miatkowski K. Sizing I. Griffiths D. Zafari M. Benjamin C.D. Meier W. Mackay F. J. Exp. Med. 1996; 183: 867-878Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar, 49Mackay F. Bourdon P.R. Griffiths D.A. Lawton P. Zafari M.

Alternatively, weak death receptor signaling may differentiate the line into a state of unfulfilled growth factor dependence or cell cycle confusion with consequent initiation of the death pathway. A fourth possibility lies in the recent observations on the ability of NF-κB activation to inhibit the death signal delivered by death domain bearing receptors and IFNγ treatment may relieve the death repression by NF-κB (23Nagata S. Cell. 1997; 88: 355-365Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4536) Google Scholar). Since anti-Fas-induced HT29 cell death is IFNγ-dependent yet Fas signaling does not lead to NF-κB activation (23Nagata S. Cell. 1997; 88: 355-365Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4536) Google Scholar), regulation of downstream NF-κB-mediated events is less likely. Finally, and most likely, death may be initiated by other “non-FLICE”-initiated signaling pathways such as the ceramide or JNK/stress-activated protein kinase pathways (50Hannun Y.A. Nature. 1996; 274: 1855-1859Google Scholar, 51Yang X. Khosravi-Far R. Chang H.Y. Baltimore D. Cell. 1997; 89: 1067-1076Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (823) Google Scholar). Whatever the mechanism, further exploration of the death trigger initiated by these weak death receptors may provide an additional approach to cancer therapy.The TNF family has grown dramatically in recent years to encompass at least 14 different ligand/receptor signaling pathways that regulate host defense and the immune system. The widespread expression patterns of TWEAK and TRAIL indicate that there may be considerably more functional variety to be uncovered in this family. This aspect was highlighted recently with the discovery of two new TNF receptors that affect the ability of Rous sarcoma and herpes simplex virus to productively infect cells along with the discovery of a bone density regulating receptor. When coupled with the historical observations that TNF itself has anti-viral activity and that pox viruses encode for decoy TNF receptors to avoid host defense, it appears that viral pathology and the functions of the TNF are interwoven (6Montgomery R.I. Warner M.S. Lum B.J. Spear P.G. Cell. 1996; 87: 427-436Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (998) Google Scholar, 7Brojatsch J. Naughton J. Rolls M.M. Zingler K. Young J.A.T.

The primary factor that controls volume regulation in all cells is ions, and thus we have examined the movement of ions at the single cell level in lymphocytes during apoptosis. Activation of the death program with several stimuli that act through independent pathways to stimulate apoptosis results in a synchronous shift of cells from a normal cell size to a shrunken cell size. Only the shrunken cells exhibit DNA fragmentation and an approximate 4-fold elevation of caspase-3-like activity. Analysis of K+ and Na+ ion content of individual cells by flow cytometry revealed that the intracellular ionic strength of apoptotic cells decreased substantially from their non-shrunken counterparts. Additionally, we show apoptosis is enhanced under conditions where the intracellular K+ concentration is diminished and that apoptosis is inhibited when K+ efflux is prevented. These data show that the efflux of ions, primarily potassium, plays a necessary and perhaps a pivotal role in the cell death program.

These data show that the efflux of ions, primarily potassium, plays a necessary and perhaps a pivotal role in the cell death program. Apoptosis is a physiological mode of cell death that removes unwanted cell populations at a specific time or in response to a given signal (1Schwartzman R.A. Cidlowski J.A. Endocr. Rev. 1993; 14: 133-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (898) Google Scholar). A major characteristic of the apoptotic process is the shrinkage of cells (2Kerr J.F.R. Wyllie A.H. Currie A.R. Br. J. Cancer. 1972; 26: 239-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (12926) Google Scholar, 3Wyllie A.H. Nature. 1980; 284: 555-556Crossref PubMed Scopus (4163) Google Scholar). This distinctive feature of volume loss in apoptotic cells is in direct contrast to the cellular swelling that occurs during necrosis. Cell shrinkage has been reported in all well characterized cases of apoptosis, suggesting a fundamental role for cell volume loss during this form of cell death. However, the mechanism of cell volume loss and its precise role in the activation of apoptosis has not been studied. We and others (4Norman M.E. Thompson E.B. Cancer Res. 1977; 37: 3785-3791PubMed Google Scholar, 5Thomas N. Bell P.A. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 1981; 22: 71-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 6Wyllie A.H. Morris R.G. Am. J. Pathol. 1982; 109: 78-87PubMed Google Scholar, 7Bortner C.D. Cidlowski J.A. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 271: C950-C961Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) have previously shown that glucocorticoid treatment of mouse, rat, and human lymphocytes results in the generation of two distinct populations of cells, one of normal cell size and one of a reduced cell size. DNA fragmentation characteristic of apoptosis occurred only in glucocorticoid-treated cells that exhibited a shrunken morphology (7Bortner C.D. Cidlowski J.A. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 271: C950-C961Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Modulation of cell volume has been shown to regulate cellular metabolism and gene expression, and changes in cell volume have been suggested to act as a second or even a third messenger during various cellular processes (8Haussinger D. Lang F. Gerok W. Am. J. Physiol. 1994; 267: E343-E355PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, changes in cell volume and ion content could be critical components of apoptosis. Cell volume is directly related to the movement of ions, with homeostasis being achieved by a balance of osmotic pressure across the plasma membrane. When the concentration of solute particles on each side of the membrane is equal, a net movement of water is inhibited, thus maintaining a constant cell size. Most cells achieve and maintain this osmotic balance through the continuous activity of the Na+/K+ ATPase pump, which creates and maintains an intracellular environment high in potassium and low in sodium (9Hoffmann E.K. Curr. Top. Membr. Transp. 1987; 30: 125-180Crossref Scopus (86) Google Scholar,10Al-Habori M. Int. J. Biochem. 1994; 26: 319-334Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). In contrast, the extracellular environment typically contains low levels of potassium and high levels of sodium. Despite the negative transmembrane potential, a net electrochemical gradient is established that favors the passive movement of potassium out of the cell. Therefore, the movement of ions, specifically potassium, is a likely candidate responsible for the loss of cell volume during apoptosis. Several recent studies have implicated a role for potassium in apoptosis. For example, cytokine withdrawal from cultured human eosinophils resulted in cell shrinkage that could be partially blocked by the potent K+ channel blocker 4-aminopyridine (11Beauvais F. Michel L. Dubertret L. J. Leukocyte Biol. 1995; 57: 851-855Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). A decrease in intracellular potassium concentration was observed during both glucocorticoid treatment of human leukemic cells and etoposide treatment of fibroblasts (12Barbiero G. Duranti F. Bonelli G. Amenta J.S. Baccino F.M. Exp. Cell Res. 1995; 217: 410-418Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar, 13Benson R.S.P. Heer S. Dive C. Watson A.J.M. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 270: C1190-C1203Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, in all these studies, the entire population of cells was analyzed while only a small percentage of cells was undergoing apoptosis, thus resulting in a potential underestimation of ion content changes in the subpopulation of apoptotic cells. We have now used flow cytometry to analyze the relationship between cell shrinkage, DNA fragmentation, and caspase activity when apoptosis is triggered by a variety of stimuli that act via different signal transduction pathways. Additionally, we have examined intracellular K+ and Na+ during apoptosis at the single cell level by combining fluorescent ion indicators with flow cytometry. Our data shows that an efflux of ions, specifically K+, is necessary for the progression of apoptosis. S49 Neo cells (S49.1 mouse lymphoma cells) and Jurkat cells (human lymphoma) were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium containing 10% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum, 4 mmglutamine, 75 units/ml streptomycin, and 100 units/ml penicillin at 37 °C, 7% CO2 atmosphere. S49 Neo cells were treated with 0.25 μm dexamethasone or 0.4 μmanisomycin for 24 h, 2 μm A23187 or 0.5 μm thapsigargin for 8 h, or 0.05 μmstaurosporin for 6 h to induce apoptosis. Jurkat cells were treated with 10 ng/ml anti-human Fas IgM (Kamiya Biomedical) for 5 h. For hypotonic medium, RPMI 1640 media was diluted (1:1) in distilled water and supplemented as described above. For high potassium medium, RPMI 1640 media was initially made minus KCl and NaCl. The KCl concentration was adjusted to 102.7 mm (the normal NaCl concentration of RPMI 1640) and the NaCl concentration was adjusted to 5.4 mm (the normal KCl concentration of RPMI 1640) and supplemented as described above. Flow cytometric analysis to determine DNA content was accomplished as described previously (7Bortner C.D. Cidlowski J.A. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 271: C950-C961Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Seven thousand five hundred cells were examined by flow cytometry for each sample using a Becton Dickinson FACSort, and the cells were excited using a 488-nm argon laser. To examine the K+ and Na+ content of viable apoptotic cells, S49 Neo and Jurkat cells treated in the presence or absence of various apoptotic agents were loaded with either the potassium- or sodium-sensitive fluorescent dyes potassium-binding benzofuran isophthalate (PBFI-AM) 1The abbreviations used are: PBFI-AM, potassium-binding benzofuran isophthalate-acetoxymethyl ester; SBFI-AM, sodium-binding benzofuran isophthalate-acetoxymethyl ester; PI, propidium iodide. and sodium-binding benzofuran isophthalate (SBFI-AM) (Molecular Probes), respectively. One hour prior to the time of harvest, each group of cells was split into 2 equal volumes, and half was loaded with either PBFI-AM or SBFI-AM to a final concentration of 5 μm. Stock solutions of both dyes (2.5 mm) were prepared fresh by combining equal volumes of a 25% (w/v) Pluronic F-127 (Molecular Probes) and Me2SO. After 1 h of loading the fluorescent dyes, the cells were harvested and resuspended in 1 ml of RPMI 1640 and then stored on ice. Flow cytometry was accomplished using a Becton Dickinson FACStar. Ten thousand cells were analyzed by excitation of the dyes at 340–350 nm, and the emission was examined at 425 nm. In studies incorporating propidium iodide (PI), the cells after the final harvest were resuspended in 1 ml of RPMI 1640 containing 10 μg/ml PI prior to putting on ice. Simultaneous sorting of both the high PBFI and low PI fluorescence population (normal) from the low PBFI and low PI fluorescence population (apoptotic) of cells was accomplished using a Becton Dickinson FACStar. Gates were set on either a PBFI (K+) versus PI fluorescence dot plot or a forward scatter versus side scatter dot plot. Cells were sorted into 3 ml of RPMI 1640 medium and placed on ice. The average volume per cell of various cell populations was determined by electronic sizing using a Coulter Multisizer II, Coulter Electronics Ltd. Cells between 5 and 20 μm in size were analyzed. The total cell volume of a population of cells was divided by the total number of cells to determine the average volume per cell. An initial intracellular potassium concentration of 140 mm and an initial cell volume of 100% was used to calculate the intracellular potassium concentration in the shrunken or apoptotic cell. Our study has shown a 90% decrease in the potassium content using PBFI-AM coupled to a 40% loss of cell volume in the shrunken, apoptotic population of cells. To determine the final intracellular potassium concentration in the shrunken population of apoptotic cells, the initial potassium concentration was multiplied by the initial cell volume which was then divided by the final cell volume times the percent of potassium that remained in the cell. Calculations based the cell diameter, the loss of potassium, and the movement of water molecules per potassium ion efflux yielded identical results. Caspase-3-like activity was measured using a fluorometric assay (14Hughes Jr., F.M. Bortner C.D. Purdy G. Cidlowski J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272 (article469881)Google Scholar). Examination of control S49 Neo lymphoma cells by flow cytometry on a forward scatter versus side scatter dot plot revealed essentially a single population of cells that had a normal DNA content as judged by PI staining (Fig. 1). When apoptosis was activated by a variety of agents, a subdiploid peak of DNA characteristic of apoptosis was observed (Fig. 1). Similarly, two distinct populations of cells were observed on dot plots of forward versus side scatter light. Analysis of cells that had a normal DNA content (shown in green) on a plot of forward scatter versus side scatter light revealed a population of cells similar to the untreated controls (Fig. 1). Analysis of cells that had degraded their DNA to apoptotic subdiploid levels (shown in red) revealed a population of cells with a decreased forward scatter and increased side scatter of light, indicative of shrunken cells. Comparison of the data from several apoptotic stimuli known to act via distinct signal transduction pathways showed that only the shrunken population of cells under each apoptotic condition has degraded their DNA. Thus, a positive relationship exists between the loss of cell volume and DNA degradation induced through a variety of apoptotic pathways. We extended this study to include Jurkat cells, widely recognized to undergo apoptosis upon engagement of the Fas receptor (15Itoh N. Yonehara S. Ishii A. Yonehara M. Cell. 1991; 66: 233-243Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2678) Google Scholar, 16Suda T. Takahashi T. Golstein P. Nagata S. Cell. 1993; 75: 1169-1178Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2450) Google Scholar, 17Nagata S. Golstein P. Science. 1995; 267: 1449-1456Crossref PubMed Scopus (3980) Google Scholar), to further examine the relationship between cell size and DNA content by flow cytometry during apoptosis. Treatment of these cells with an antibody against the Fas receptor also resulted in the generation of two distinct populations: one of normal DNA content and cell size (shown in green), and one with degraded DNA and reduced cell size (shown in red; Fig.2 A). Therefore, the relationship between cell size and DNA content also exists for this receptor-activated cell death pathway. We next used the anti-Fas-treated Jurkat cells as a model system to study the movement of ions during apoptosis. Flow cytometric analysis of these cells loaded with the cell-permeant acetoxymethyl ester derivative of the fluorescent potassium-sensitive dye PBFI-AM (18Minta A. Tsien R.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 19449-19457Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) also revealed two distinct populations of cells on a forward scatter (cell size) versus PBFI-AM fluorescence (potassium content) dot plot (Fig. 2 B). The major population contained cells of a larger size with a high degree of PBFI-AM (K+) fluorescence, representing the normal, non-apoptotic cells. A second population of cells was also observed with a shrunken cell size and lower PBFI-AM (K+) fluorescence. The amount of PBFI-AM (K+) fluorescence in the normal cell population was relatively constant over the range of cell sizes observed in the forward scatter versus PBFI-AM (K+) plot, indicating K+ fluorescence was independent of normal size variations. Anti-Fas treatment of Jurkat cells resulted in approximately 30% more cells exhibiting a 10-fold decrease of PBFI-AM (K+) fluorescence (Fig. 2 B). Co-analysis of these two independent parameters showed that the population of cells with decreased PBFI-AM (K+) fluorescence corresponded precisely to the shrunken population of cells which contained degraded DNA, characteristic of apoptosis. In this model system, and other models of apoptosis, cell death is highly asynchronous. A late occurrence during programmed cell death is the loss of membrane integrity (19Vaux D.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 786-789Crossref PubMed Scopus (618) Google Scholar), an event which compromises the ability to accurately measure intracellular ions. To determine whether the loss in PBFI-AM (K+) fluorescence observed in the apoptotic cells had occurred prior to a loss in membrane integrity, cells were treated with PBFI-AM and PI, since PI can only enter dead cells (20Darzynkiewicz Z. Bruno S. Del Bino G. Gorczyca W. Hotz M.A. Lassota P. Traganos F. Cytometry. 1992; 13: 795-808Crossref PubMed Scopus (1913) Google Scholar). Analysis of these cells by two-color flow cytometry revealed three distinct populations of cells (Fig. 2 C). One population (R1) had a high PBFI-AM (K+) and low PI fluorescence corresponding to the normal viable population of cells. A second population (R2) had a decreased PBFI-AM (K+) and low PI fluorescence, corresponding to early apoptotic cells. Finally, a third population (R3) exhibited a decreased PBFI-AM (K+) and elevated PI fluorescence, corresponding to dead cells that were excluded from further ion analysis. Clearly, however, the majority of cells with a reduction in PBFI-AM (K+) fluorescence have an intact cell membrane. Quantitation of PBFI-AM (K+) fluorescence in Jurkat cells undergoing apoptosis is shown in Table I. Anti-Fas treatment of Jurkat cells resulted in a 30% increase in the number of shrunken cells that had an intact cell membrane as judged by PI staining (Fig. 2 C) and trypan blue exclusion (data not shown). Quantitation of data obtained from several experiments showed that these shrunken cells had a 92% reduction in PBFI-AM (K+) fluorescence when compared with the normal or non-shrunken population of cells. Individually sorting and electronically sizing the population of cells with a normal PBFI-AM (K+) and a low PI fluorescence (R1) from cells with a reduced PBFI-AM (K+) and low PI fluorescence (R2) revealed that the shrunken population of cells had a 40% decrease in cell volume. Thus, the 90% decrease in potassium content in cells having a 40% reduction in volume would yield an intracellular potassium concentration of less than 50 mm. This concentration of potassium measured with the fluorescent dye is consistent with values obtained in other systems (12Barbiero G. Duranti F. Bonelli G. Amenta J.S. Baccino F.M. Exp. Cell Res. 1995; 217: 410-418Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar, 13Benson R.S.P. Heer S. Dive C. Watson A.J.M. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 270: C1190-C1203Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and in our own studies using inductively coupled plasma/mass spectrometry (14Hughes Jr., F.M. Bortner C.D. Purdy G. Cidlowski J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272 (article469881)Google Scholar). The data in Table Ialso show that the normal size population of anti-Fas-treated cells exhibited a small decrease in PBFI-AM (K+) fluorescence compared with untreated control cells, indicating that the loss of potassium likely causes the reduction in cell volume during apoptosis. Interestingly, a small population of untreated Jurkat cells also exhibited a marked reduction in potassium concentration comparable to that observed in anti-Fas-treated cells. Microscopic examination of these untreated Jurkat cells revealed that these represent a small population of naturally apoptotic cells. Thus, if uncompensated by other ions, the intracellular ionic strength of Jurkat cells undergoing apoptosis is significantly lower than nondying cells.Table IPBFI-AM (K +, top) and SBFI-AM (Na +, bottom) flow cytometric analysis of Jurkat cells treated with 10 ng/ml anti-Fas antibody for 5 hAgent% CellsPBFI-AM (K+)Normal SizeShrunkenNormal SizeShrunkenControl89.3 ± 0.62.1 ± 0.41504 ± 139124 ± 22Anti-Fas61.1 ± 1.128.8 ± 1.31209 ± 11698 ± 20Agent% CellsSBFI-AM (Na+)Normal SizeShrunkenNormal SizeShrunkenControl91.2 ± 1.62.4 ± 0.643 ± 155 ± 1Anti-Fas64.1 ± 4.130.4 ± 3.962 ± 4.34 ± 0.1 Open table in a new tab Because of the large change in PBFI-AM (K+) fluorescence observed in the shrunken population of anti-Fas-treated Jurkat cells, we wondered if the apoptotic cells compensated with an influx of Na+ which can also regulate cell volume. Individual cell sodium content was measured with the cell-permeant acetoxymethyl ester derivative of the fluorescent sodium-sensitive dye SBFI-AM (18Minta A. Tsien R.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 19449-19457Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and PI. Three populations of cells were also observed in these studies, which were similar to those seen with the potassium indicator. The total fluorescence detected with the sodium indicator was invariably lower than that of the potassium indicator. Cells that had lost their membrane integrity were excluded from analysis. Table I shows that a major 89% loss in the mean SBFI-AM (Na+) fluorescence occurs in the anti-Fas-treated Jurkat cells. Because intracellular sodium exists at approximately 12 mm, or one-twelfth the level of intracellular potassium, the loss of this ion is less likely to contribute toward both the reduction in cell volume and in decreasing the overall intracellular ionic strength of the apoptotic cell. These data reveal a major reduction in both K+ and Na+ concentrations only in the shrunken population of Jurkat cells that have fragmented their DNA, characteristic of apoptosis. To determine if early events in the apoptotic cascade, such as caspase activity (21Kumar S. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1995; 20: 198-202Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (366) Google Scholar, 22Martin S.J. Green D.R. Cell. 1995; 82: 349-352Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1263) Google Scholar), were restricted to the shrunken population of cells, we sorted the shrunken, apoptotic population of anti-Fas-treated Jurkat cells from the normal, non-shrunken population, revealing a nearly 4-fold increase in caspase-3-like activity in the shrunken population (TableII). This relationship between cell shrinkage, ion loss, and caspase activity is also observed when caspase activity is analyzed in live cells. Only cells that shrink exhibit caspase activity in vivo. Preliminary studies with the caspase inhibitor zVAD-fmk revealed that this inhibitor can block anti-Fas-induced shrinkage, although not shrinkage induced by other apoptotic signals. 2C. D. Bortner and J. A. Cidlowski, unpublished results. Thus, several critical components of apoptosis occur only in cells that have shrunken and lost ionic strength.Table IICaspase-3-like activity in individually sorted normal and shrunken populations of Jurkat cells after 5 h of anti-Fas treatmentCaspase-3-like activitypmol AFC/min/mgNormal67.3 ± 6.8Shrunken240.4 ± 22 Open table in a new tab To determine if similar changes in K+ and Na+ occur in other cells induced to undergo apoptosis, we examined the intracellular ions in murine S49 Neo cells which also undergo apoptosis in response to a variety of agents (see Fig. 1). Induction of apoptosis in S49 Neo cells through these diverse apoptotic pathways revealed three populations of cells when examined on a PBFI-AM (K+)versus PI fluorescence dot plot (data not shown). Cells that had lost membrane integrity were again excluded from analysis. The data in Table III, along with Fig. 1, indicate that cells exhibiting shrunken apoptotic morphology and DNA degradation have a major reduction in intracellular K+ and Na+ content. Thus the loss of K+ and Na+ during apoptosis occurs across animal species and is independent of the mode of activation of apoptosis.Table IIIPBFI-AM (K+, top) and SBFI-AM (Na+, bottom) flow cytometric analysis of S49 Neo cells treated with either 0.25 μm dexamethasone or 0.4 μm anisomycin for 24 h; 2 μm A23187 or 0.5 μmthapsigargin for 8 h; or 0.05 μm staurosporin for 6 hAgent% CellsPBFI-AM (K+)Normal SizeShrunkenNormal SizeShrunkenControl92.6 ± 0.63.7 ± 0.91951 ± 18027 ± 2Dex58.8 ± 2.416.6 ± 2.21740 ± 13031 ± 3Aniso17.4 ± 1.539.1 ± 3.91630 ± 11822 ± 1A2318733.0 ± 1023.2 ± 4.41885 ± 23536 ± 7Thaps56.4 ± 2.811.0 ± 2.51731 ± 18240 ± 7Stauro82.2 ± 5.85.0 ± 1.51507 ± 31127 ± 4Agent% CellsSBFI-AM (Na+)Normal SizeShrunkenNormal SizeShrunkenControl91.2 ± 1.33.7 ± 1.0176 ± 2424 ± 1Dex56.0 ± 3.215.8 ± 4.0176 ± 2724 ± 2Aniso17.9 ± 1.734.2 ± 4.0147 ± 1317 ± 1A2318730.9 ± 7.122.0 ± 6.2148 ± 8.928 ± 1Thaps54.3 ± 3.67.8 ± 2.0147 ± 2227 ± 1Stauro80.7 ± 5.95.0 ± 2.3161 ± 1627 ± 2 Open table in a new tab A critical question generated by our observations is whether K+ efflux is necessary for the activation and progression of apoptosis. To address this issue, we exploited the volume regulatory mechanisms in lymphocytes to modulate the intracellular K+ concentration and K+ efflux during apoptosis. When Jurkat cells were exposed to the anti-Fas antibody for 5 h under isotonic conditions, approximately 37% of the cells degraded their DNA and were shrunken (Fig. 3 A). Culture of lymphocytes under hypotonic conditions immediately expands cell size due to an increase in intracellular water. These cells then compensated for this increase in cell volume by the activation of a regulatory volume decrease response and lose potassium and chloride ions, allowing for the movement of water from the cells to subsequently regain a near normal cell size (23Grinstein S. Rothstein B. Sarkadi B. Gelfand E.W. Am. J. Physiol. 1984; 246: C204-C215Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This volume recovery response leads to an approximately 50% reduction in potassium concentration (data not shown) but clearly does not activate apoptosis (Fig. 3 B, left panel). Thus K+ depletion alone, generated by exposure of cells to hypotonic conditions in the absence of an apoptotic stimulus, does not trigger apoptosis nor alter the long term viability of the cells (7Bortner C.D. Cidlowski J.A. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 271: C950-C961Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, treatment of these hypotonically treated Jurkat cells with the anti-Fas antibody for 5 h almost doubled the number of cells undergoing apoptosis (Fig. 3 B, right panel). Similar data were also obtained when hypotonically treated S49 Neo cells were exposed to a variety of apoptotic stimuli (data not shown). Therefore, the induction of apoptosis in cells with a reduced intracellular K+ concentration significantly enhances the activation of the cell death program. If the loss of intracellular potassium is necessary for a cell to undergo apoptosis, then inhibiting K+ efflux should inhibit the programmed cell death process. To test this hypothesis, Jurkat cells treated with the anti-Fas antibody were cultured under conditions where the normal sodium and potassium concentrations in the media were switched, such that extracellular potassium was high and sodium was low. Therefore, the natural potassium electrochemical gradient is reduced, thus impeding the movement of potassium from the dying cells while maintaining extracellular osmolality. Culturing Jurkat cells in high extracellular potassium did not alter the DNA content or cell viability, although the entire population of cells was slightly smaller in size when compared with control cells. However, diminishing the normal potassium electrochemical gradient completely abrogated the ability of the anti-Fas antibody to induce apoptosis in Jurkat cells (Fig. 3 C). Additionally, both caspase activity and the loss of the mitochondrial membrane potential are inhibited under this condition.2 Together these data indicate that controlling the intracellular potassium level in cells can directly regulate the progression of the apoptotic process. An important implication of our observations is the fact that apoptotic cells actually become hypotonic when compared with their non-dying counterparts. Several lines of evidence suggest that this change may be a key step in the decision of cells to live or die. For example, the nucleases that degrade DNA during apoptosis as well as the activity of caspase-1 (ICE) are effectively inhibited at a physiological K+ concentration (14Hughes Jr., F.M. Bortner C.D. Purdy G. Cidlowski J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272 (article469881)Google Scholar, 24Montague J.W. Hughes Jr., F.M. Cidlowski J.A. J. Biol.

EMBO J. 1995; 14: 1607-1614Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar). Similarly, in vitro activation of the procaspase by dATP and cytochrome c is effectively inhibited by physiological K+ concentrations (14Hughes Jr., F.M. Bortner C.D. Purdy G. Cidlowski J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272 (article469881)Google Scholar). Thus the transition of an apoptotic cell from a state of high ionic strength to low ionic strength permits both the loss in cell volume and the activation of enzymes that mediate apoptosis. The potassium electrochemical gradient observed across the plasma membrane indicates that this ion may play a role in controlling intracellular events, similar to how the natural calcium concentration gradient leads to various intracellular signaling pathways (26McConkey D.J. Orrenius S. Trends Cell Biol. 1994; 4: 370-375Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). Although the gradient of potassium is not as great as for calcium, the movement of potassium still may have profound effects during apoptosis and may in turn assist in the orchestration of the programmed cell death process. This orchestration may be accomplished by the concentration of positive apoptotic factors, the physical disruption of the cell structure as the cell shrinks, the activation of enzymes that in turn could degrade inhibitory apoptotic proteins, or perhaps by facilitating protein-protein interactions that would not normally occur at higher ionic strength found in non-dying cells.

VEGF stimulates autophosphorylation of both receptors, but little is known about their signal transduction properties. In this study, we used porcine aortic endothelial (PAE) cells overexpressing KDR (PAE/KDR) to evaluate the interaction of KDR with intracellular proteins and compared them with Flt-1-expressing PAE cells (PAE/Flt-1). VEGF-induced stimulation of KDR results in the association and phosphorylation of the 46-, 52-, and 66-kDa isoforms of Shc and the induction of Shc-Grb2 complex formation. In a similar fashion, KDR associates with Grb2 and Nck in a ligand-dependent fashion, suggesting Shc, Grb2, and Nck as potential candidates involved in the regulation of endothelial function. Another strong candidate is mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase, which is strongly activated in response to VEGF stimulation as demonstrated by phosphorylation of the specific substrate myelin basic protein. Inhibition of MAP kinase activation by PD98059, a specific MAP kinase kinase inhibitor, results in inhibition of VEGF-induced proliferation of PAE/KDR cells. In contrast, VEGF-induced stimulation of Flt-1 does not activate MAP kinase in PAE/Flt-1 cells. In this study we provide the first two examples of molecules potentially capable of functionally counteracting the endothelial response to VEGF, namely SHP-1 and SHP-2.

Recently, two novel and distinct VEGF-A-related genes were identified, namely VEGF-B (11Olofsson B. Pajusola K. Kaipainen A. Voneuler G. Joukov V. Saksela O. Orpana A. Petersson R.F. Alitalo K.

Lemischka I.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 9026-9030Crossref PubMed Scopus (447) Google Scholar). Flt-4 is a structurally related receptor that binds VEGF-C (12Joukov V. Pajusola K.

Each of these receptors consists of an extracellular domain containing seven immunoglobulin-like motifs, a transmembrane domain, a juxtamembrane domain, a carboxyl-terminal tail, and a tyrosine kinase domain, which is interrupted by a long kinase-insert domain consisting of >100 amino acids. Binding of VEGF-A (referred to as VEGF below) induces conformational change in KDR and Flt-1, followed by dimerization and autophosphorylation on tyrosine residues (5Waltenberger J. Claesson-Welsh L.

Cell. 1995; 80: 213-223Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1427) Google Scholar). The phosphorylation on tyrosine residues makes them become targets for SH2, SH3, and phosphotyrosine-binding domain-containing molecules, which frequently become phosphorylated themselves. Thereafter, consecutive intracellular signal transduction events are triggered (20Schlessinger J. Ullrich A. Neuron. 1992; 9: 383-391Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1287) Google Scholar, 21Pawson T. Nature. 1995; 373: 573-580Crossref PubMed Scopus (2217) Google Scholar). Three classes of SH2 domain-containing molecules are currently known: (i) molecules without any catalytic activity named adapter molecules; (ii) SH2 domain-containing enzymes including cytoplasmic tyrosine kinases, phospholipase Cγ, GAP, and protein-tyrosine phosphatases SHP-1 and SHP-2 (22Adachi M.

Trans. 1996; 24: 307-327Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar).So far, only limited information is available concerning function and signal transduction of VEGF receptors. KDR is able to induce striking changes in cell morphology, actin reorganization, membrane ruffling, mitogenicity, and chemotaxis in porcine aortic endothelial (PAE) cells overexpressing KDR (PAE/KDR) in response to VEGF stimulation (5Waltenberger J. Claesson-Welsh L. Siegbahn A. Shibuya M. Heldin C.-H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 26988-26995Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In molecular terms, VEGF stimulation of KDR-expressing cells results in the phosphorylation of GAP, members of the Src family of protein kinases, and phospholipase Cγ as well as of p42 MAP kinase as determined by an in vitro kinase assay and Western blot analysis (5Waltenberger J. Claesson-Welsh L. Siegbahn A. Shibuya M. Heldin C.-H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 26988-26995Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 24Waltenberger J. Mayr U. Pentz S. Hombach V.

In the case of Flt-1, the information about cellular function and mechanism of action is even further limited. Flt-1 mediates chemotactic activity in monocytes and stimulates tissue factor expression in monocytes and endothelial cells (26Clauss M. Weich H. Breier G. Knies U. Rockl W. Waltenberger J. Risau W. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 17629-17634Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (751) Google Scholar). However, VEGF stimulation of Flt-1 does not induce mitogenicity and chemotaxis in Flt-1-expressing PAE cells (PAE/Flt-1) (5Waltenberger J. Claesson-Welsh L. Siegbahn A. Shibuya M. Heldin C.-H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 26988-26995Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). VEGF stimulation of Flt-1-expressing cells, however, results in autophosphorylation of Flt-1 and phosphorylation of members of the Src family of protein kinases, GAP, phospholipase Cγ, and Shc proteins (5Waltenberger J. Claesson-Welsh L. Siegbahn A. Shibuya M. Heldin C.-H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 26988-26995Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 27Seetharam L. Gotoh N. Maru Y. Neufeld G. Yamaguchi S. Shibuya M. Oncogene. 1995; 10: 135-147PubMed Google Scholar). Both VEGF receptors play important roles in developmental angiogenesis. Mouse knockout experiments in KDR/Flk-1 cells and Flt-1 resulted in the generation of distinct developmentally lethal phenotypes. While Flt-1−/− mice showed defects in vessel formation (28Fong G.-H. Rossant J. Gertsenstein M. Breitman M.L. Nature. 1995; 376: 66-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (2202) Google Scholar), the Flk-1−/− knockout did not produce endothelial cells at all (29Shalaby F. Rossant J. Yamaguchi T.P. Gertsenstein M. Wu X.-F. Breitman M.L. Schuh A.C. Nature. 1995; 376: 62-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (3332) Google Scholar).In this study we used PAE/KDR cells in culture for the analysis of KDR signal transduction. Using this approach, we are able to demonstrate that VEGF stimulation of KDR results in the activation of multiple intracellular signal transduction pathways. We have shown the ligand-induced phosphorylation of all three isoforms of Shc proteins and the phosphorylation of GAP as well as the strong activation of MAP kinase. In addition, KDR is shown to associate with Shc, Shc-Grb2, Nck, Grb2, and GAP. Moreover, we demonstrate that KDR associates with at least two distinct protein-tyrosine phosphatases, namely SHP-1 and SHP-2, which are potentially involved in either negative regulation (i.e. dephosphorylation) or positive regulation (i.e. signal enhancement) of VEGF-induced signals.DISCUSSIONIn this study, we were able to significantly extend our knowledge on the signal transduction properties of the VEGF receptor KDR. For our in vitro studies, we used porcine aortic endothelial cells overexpressing KDR. VEGF stimulation results in the autophosphorylation of KDR, the phosphorylation of a number of intracellular proteins, and the association of intracellular proteins with phosphorylated KDR. So far, only little information has been available concerning the identity of signal transduction molecules involved in KDR signaling. In this study, we were able to demonstrate that Shc, Nck, and Grb2 as well as SHP-1 and SHP-2 are involved in these processes.The phosphorylation of Shc proteins is an early event in the signal transduction cascade of many activated receptor tyrosine kinases leading to the MAP kinase pathway. Shc is able to associate with several growth factor receptors through its C-terminal SH2 domains and N-terminal phosphotyrosine-binding domain (35Pelicci G. Lanfrancone L. Grignani F. McGlade J. Cavallo F. Forni G. Nicoletti I. Grignani F. Pawson T. Pelicci P.G. Cell. 1992; 70: 93-104Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1131) Google Scholar, 36van der Geer P. Wiley S. Lai V.K.-M. Oliver J.P. Gish G.D. Stephens R. Kaplan D. Shoelson S. Pawson T. Curr. Biol. 1995; 5: 404-412Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). Shc mediates the coupling of the Grb2-Sos complex to Ras via its major phosphorylation site, Tyr-317 (37Salcini A.E. McGlade J. Pelicci G. Nicoletti I. Pawson T. Pelicci P.G. Oncogene. 1994; 9: 2827-2836PubMed Google Scholar). According to our data, 5 min of VEGF stimulation results in the phosphorylation of all three isoforms of Shc proteins, whereby the 46- and 52-kDa isoforms were more strongly phosphorylated compared with the 66-kDa isoform. Simultaneously, activated KDR triggers the complex formation between Shc molecules and the adapter molecule Grb2. Thus, KDR transmits mitogenic signals via the Shc/Grb2/Sos/Ras cascade, inducing a strong activation of MAP kinase and finally resulting in the proliferation of PAE/KDR cells. These data are strongly supported by the fact that inhibition of MAP kinase using PD98059 leads to inhibition of VEGF-induced proliferation of these cells. The phosphorylation of Shc proteins also plays a role in the signaling of the other VEGF receptor, Flt-1 (27Seetharam L. Gotoh N. Maru Y. Neufeld G. Yamaguchi S. Shibuya M. Oncogene. 1995; 10: 135-147PubMed Google Scholar), and the related receptor, Flt-4 (38Fournier E. Dubreuil P. Birnbaum D. Borg J.-P. Oncogene. 1995; 11: 921-931PubMed Google Scholar, 39Fournier E. Rosnet O. Marchetto S. Turck C.W. Rottapel R. Pelicci P.G. Birnbaum D. Borg J.-P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 12956-12963Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). VEGF stimulation of NIH3T3 cells overexpressing Flt-1 induced a slight increase in tyrosine phosphorylation of the 52- and 66-kDa isoforms of Shc proteins (27Seetharam L. Gotoh N. Maru Y. Neufeld G. Yamaguchi S. Shibuya M. Oncogene. 1995; 10: 135-147PubMed Google Scholar). Despite this weak phosphorylation of Shc proteins by Flt-1, VEGF stimulation of Flt-1 in NIH3T3 fibroblasts does not result in activation of MAP kinase and does not generate any mitotic response. Activation of MAP kinase in sinusoidal endothelial cells by VEGF may be mediated via KDR since these cells express both Flt-1 and KDR (40Yamane A. Seetharam L. Yamaguchi S. Gotoh N. Takahashi T. Neufeld G. Shibuya M. Oncogene. 1994; 9: 2683-2690PubMed Google Scholar). Failure of induction of a mitogenic response in PAE/Flt-1 cells secondary to VEGF stimulation has been described recently (5Waltenberger J. Claesson-Welsh L. Siegbahn A. Shibuya M. Heldin C.-H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 26988-26995Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In accordance with these results, we show that Flt-1 is unable to activate MAP kinase in PAE/Flt-1 cells, which is consistent with our recent observation that Flt-1 is unable to induce DNA synthesis in PAE/Flt-1 cells (5Waltenberger J. Claesson-Welsh L. Siegbahn A. Shibuya M. Heldin C.-H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 26988-26995Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).Besides Shc, KDR was found to associate with Grb2 and Nck in a ligand-dependent fashion. Nck (41Lehmann J.M. Riethmuller G. Johnson J.P. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 1048Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar) and Grb2 (42Clark S.G. Stern M.J. Horvitz H.R. Nature. 1992; 356: 340-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (460) Google Scholar, 43Matuoka K. Shibata M. Yamakawa A. Takenawa T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 9015-9019Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar) are small adapter molecules consisting largely of SH2 and SH3 domains. Grb2 links receptor tyrosine kinase activity to Ras signaling (44Lowenstein E.J. Daly R.J. Batzer A.G. Margolis B. Lammers R. Ullrich A. Skolnik E.Y. Barsagi D. Schlessinger J. Cell. 1992; 70: 431-442Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1331) Google Scholar), whereas the downstream signaling pathway of Nck remains to be elucidated. It is important to note, however, that overexpression of Nck leads to transformation of fibroblasts (45Chou M.M. Fajardo J.E. Hanafusa H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; : 5834-5842Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar), indicating that Nck is a positive mediator of mitogenic signaling. Nck becomes phosphorylated on tyrosine, serine, and threonine in response to epidermal growth factor and PDGF β-receptor activation (46Li W. Hu P. Skolnik E.Y. Ullrich A. Schlessinger J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; : 5824-5833Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). Our data clearly show that both Grb2 and Nck are involved in VEGF-induced signaling of KDR. Further studies will be required to elucidate the detailed function of Grb2 and Nck in endothelial cells.A weak phosphorylation of GAP secondary to VEGF stimulation of KDR has previously been reported (5Waltenberger J. Claesson-Welsh L. Siegbahn A. Shibuya M. Heldin C.-H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 26988-26995Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). With this study, we are able to add more data, as we have demonstrated the VEGF-dependent association of GAP protein with activated KDR. Likewise, GAP is phosphorylated by Flt-1 (5Waltenberger J. Claesson-Welsh L. Siegbahn A. Shibuya M. Heldin C.-H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 26988-26995Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 27Seetharam L. Gotoh N. Maru Y. Neufeld G. Yamaguchi S. Shibuya M. Oncogene. 1995; 10: 135-147PubMed Google Scholar) and by stimulation of bovine aortic endothelial cells with VEGF (47Guo D. Jia Q. Song H.-Y. Warren R.S. Donner D.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 6729-6733Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (413) Google Scholar). VEGF stimulation of PAE/KDR cells followed by immunoprecipitation with a number of different antibodies (such as the ones recognizing Shc, Grb2, Nck, and GAP) prior to SDS-PAGE leads to the detection of a phosphorylated signal migrating at ∼210 kDa. This signal is likely to represent KDR because its appearance depends on VEGF stimulation and it shows the electrophoretic mobility of KDR (210 kDa) and is not detectable after preincubation of PAE/KDR cells with the KDR inhibitor tyrphostin AG1433. Moreover, stimulation of nontransfected PAE cells with VEGF or with 10% fetal calf serum does not result in the generation of such a signal, indicating that this 210-kDa band truly represents KDR. However, the possibility that KDR phosphorylated another protein of similar size cannot be fully excluded.The intracellular signaling cascades represent a complex network, which is influenced by a variety of components and conditions. Following stimulation of kinase-dependent pathways leading to proliferation, differentiation, migration, or other cellular events, it seems to be important for cells to switch off these signals to prevent uncontrolled cellular growth. One such possibility is the activation of phosphatases, which can inactivate phosphoproteins through dephosphorylation. It has been shown that the SH2 domain-containing protein-tyrosine phosphatase SHP-1, predominantly expressed in hematopoietic cells, can associate with activated growth factor receptors such as the stem cell factor receptor/c-Kit (48Yi T. Ihle J.N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 3350-3358Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar) and the CSF-1 receptor (49Chen H.E. Chang S. Trub T. Neel B.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 3685-3697Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). SHP-1 seems to play a role in the negative regulation of receptor signaling. It associates with the activated insulin receptor and is consecutively phosphorylated itself on Tyr-538, resulting in an increase in phosphatase activity (50Uchida T. Matozaki T. Noguchi T. Yamao T.

Transient overexpression of SHP-1, together with overexpression of the PDGF α-receptor, the PDGF β-receptor, or the β-subunit of the insulin receptor, has led to partial or complete dephosphorylation of these receptors or receptor domains (51Vogel W. Lammers R. Huang J. Ullrich A. Science. 1993; 259: 1611-1614Crossref PubMed Scopus (490) Google Scholar). Surprisingly, we have found that SHP-1 phosphatase is expressed in PAE cells, suggesting that SHP-1 is potentially involved in endothelial cell function. Stimulation of PAE/KDR cells with VEGF resulted in a physical association of SHP-1 with KDR. This association might lead to a deactivation of VEGF-induced signals in analogy to the deactivation of PDGF- and insulin-induced signals by functional interference with the PDGF α-receptor, the PDGF β-receptor, or the insulin receptor. In contrast, recent work has demonstrated that SHP-1 can associate with the protein-tyrosine kinase c-Src in human platelets (52Falet H. Ramosmorales F. Bachelot C. Fischer S. Rendu F. FEBS Lett. 1996; 383: 165-169Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar), that SHP-1 has a positive effect on mitogen-activated signaling in 293 cells (53Su L. Zhao Z. Bouchard P. Banville D. Fischer E.H. Krebs E.G. Shen S.-H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 10385-10390Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar), and that SHP-1 is potentially involved in the Ras-mediated activation of the MAP kinase pathway (54Krautwald S. Buscher D. Kummer V. Buder S. Baccarini M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 5955-5963Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Taken together, these results indicate that the action of SHP-1 is dependent on the cellular background, resulting in either a positive or a negative effect on specific signal transduction pathways (53Su L. Zhao Z. Bouchard P. Banville D. Fischer E.H. Krebs E.G. Shen S.-H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 10385-10390Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). However, the functional role of SHP-1 in endothelial cells remains to be elucidated in more detailed work.Finally, we have found that another protein-tyrosine phosphatase, namely SHP-2, physically associates with VEGF-activated KDR. Similar to the findings observed for SHP-1, no tyrosine phosphorylation of SHP-2 was observed after VEGF stimulation of PAE/KDR cells, even though two different methods (in vitro kinase assay and phosphotyrosine blot analysis) and several experimental conditions have been tested. SHP-2 is able to associate with other activated receptors, and it is phosphorylated by these receptors on tyrosine residues (34Feng G.-S. Pawson T. Trends Genet. 1994; 10: 54-58Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). In turn, SHP-2 can dephosphorylate the activated PDGF β-receptor preferentially at phosphotyrosines 751 and 771 in vitro(55Klinghoffer R.A. Kazlauskas A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 22208-22217Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar), whereas it is unable to dephosphorylate several other receptor tyrosine kinases (51Vogel W. Lammers R. Huang J. Ullrich A. Science. 1993; 259: 1611-1614Crossref PubMed Scopus (490) Google Scholar). In PAE/KDR cells, however, we have no data suggesting the deactivation of KDR by SHP-2. An interesting recent observation was the association of SHP-2 with Grb2, leading to the activation of the MAP kinase pathway (56Bennett A.M. Tang T.L. Sugimoto S. Walsh C.T. Neel B.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 7335-7339Crossref PubMed Scopus (344) Google Scholar, 57Li W. Nishimura R. Kashishian A. Batzer A.G. Kim W.J.H. Cooper J.A. Schlessinger J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 509-517Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This positive role of SHP-2 in the signal transduction of receptor tyrosine kinases was rather unexpected, and most recent work indicates the possibility that, depending on the specific signaling pathway, SHP-1 and SHP-2 may have either positive or negative effects (58Tonks N.K. Neel B.G. Cell. 1996; 87: 365-368Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (489) Google Scholar). Future work will reveal the functional role of SHP-1 and SHP-2 in the control of endothelial cell function.In this paper, we have shown that the VEGF receptor KDR is able to induce multiple signal transduction events in porcine aortic endothelial cells. We have shown that KDR activates proteins of the Ras pathway in a similar fashion to other receptor tyrosine kinases and that inhibition of MAP kinase activation results in abrogation of VEGF-induced proliferation of PAE/KDR cells. In addition, the involvement of SH2 protein-tyrosine phosphatases in VEGF signaling was established. Vascular endothelial growth factor A is a dimeric endothelium-specific growth factor (1Leung D.W.

Previous studies have demonstrated that calmodulin (CaM) kinase II can phosphorylate and modulate AMPA receptors. However, the sites of CaM kinase phosphorylation have not been unequivocally identified. In the current study, we have generated two phosphorylation site-specific antibodies to analyze the phosphorylation of the glutamate receptor GluR1 subunit. These antibodies recognize GluR1 only when it is phosphorylated on serine residues 831 or 845. We have used these antibodies to demonstrate that serine 831 is specifically phosphorylated by CaM kinase II in transfected cells expressing GluR1 as well as in hippocampal slice preparations. Two-dimensional phosphopeptide mapping experiments indicate that Ser-831 is the major site of CaM kinase II phosphorylation on GluR1. In addition, treatment of hippocampal slice preparations with phorbol esters and forskolin increase the phosphorylation of serine 831 and 845, respectively, indicating that protein kinase C and protein kinase A phosphorylate these residues in hippocampal slices. These results identify the site of CaM kinase phosphorylation of the GluR1 subunit and demonstrate that GluR1 is multiply phosphorylated by protein kinase A, protein kinase C, and CaM kinase II in situ.

Long lasting changes in the efficiency of synaptic transmission are thought to underlie many forms of learning and memory.

LTP is the long-term increase in excitatory synaptic transmission between neurons after a brief high frequency stimulus. In contrast, LTD is the long-term decrease in excitatory synaptic transmission following long periods of low frequency stimulation. The modulation of excitatory synaptic transmission during LTP and LTD has been reported to be due to changes in the presynaptic release of the neurotransmitter glutamate (4Bekkers J.M. Stevens C.F.

However, the substrates for the various kinases and phosphatases that mediate changes in synaptic transmission have not been identified. Neurotransmitter receptors mediate signal transduction at the postsynaptic membrane of synapses in the central and peripheral nervous system. Protein phosphorylation of neurotransmitter receptors has been shown to be a major mechanism in the regulation of their function (22Swope S.L. Moss S.J. Blackstone C.D. Huganir R.L.

Neurosci. 1994; 4: 383-388Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor, GABAA receptors, and glutamate receptors regulate a diverse set of properties including desensitization, ion channel properties, and subcellular targeting of the receptors (22Swope S.L. Moss S.J. Blackstone C.D. Huganir R.L. FASEB J. 1991; 6: 2514-2523Crossref Scopus (209) Google Scholar, 23Raymond L.A. Blackstone C.D. Huganir R.L.

Thus, regulation of neurotransmitter receptor function by protein phosphorylation may play a critical role in the regulation of synaptic transmission (22Swope S.L. Moss S.J. Blackstone C.D.

PKC and PKA have recently been shown to phosphorylate the AMPA receptor subunit GluR1 on serine residues 831 and 845, respectively, within its intracellular C-terminal domain and phosphorylation of these residues appears to potentiate GluR1 function (29Roche K.W.

However, the site of CaM kinase II phosphorylation has not been unequivocally identified. In the present study we have generated two phosphorylation site-specific antibodies which recognize GluR1 only when Ser-831 (anti-S831-P) or Ser-845 (anti-S845-P) is phosphorylated. We use these antibodies to demonstrate that GluR1 is phosphorylated on Ser-831 by CaM kinase IIin vitro, in transfected cultured cells, as well as in hippocampal slice preparations. GluR1 and actCaMKII cDNAs were generous gifts of Steve Heinemann (Salk Institute) and Howard Schulman (Stanford University), respectively. The generation of the GluR1 S831A and S845A mutants has been previously described (29Roche K.W. O'Brien R.J. Mammen A.L. Bernhardt J. Huganir R.L.

Di-tert-butyl-N,N-diisopropylphosphoramidite and N-(9-fluorenyl)methoxycarbonyl serine (hydroxyl group not protected) were obtained from Novabiochem, La Jolla, CA. TOF MALDI mass spectrometry of the purified peptides was performed using a Kompact MALDI III (Manchester, United Kingdom) in the Middle Atlantic Mass Spectrometry Laboratory, located at the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine. The peptides LIPQQSINEAIK and KTLPRNSGAGAS, corresponding to amino acids 826–836 and 840–850 of GluR1, respectively, were synthesized as described above with phosphoserines included at the Ser-831 and Ser-845 positions. Lysine residues were included to facilitate glutaraldehyde coupling to the carrier protein, thyroglobulin, and the resulting phosphopeptide/thyroglobulin mixtures were used to immunize New Zealand White rabbits. Sera were obtained periodically by Hazleton Research Products. Polyclonal antiphosphopeptide antibodies were purified from sera by sequential chromatography on Affi-Gel 15 (Bio-Rad) columns covalently linked to phosphorylated and unphosphorylated peptides. Antibodies were first eluted from the phosphorylated peptide affinity columns using 100 mm glycine (pH 2.7). The affinity purified antibodies were dialyzed against phosphate-buffered saline and then loaded onto unphosphorylated peptide affinity columns. The flow-through was collected and used for immunoblot analysis. Anti-GluR1 C-terminal antibodies were described previously (34Blackstone C.D. Moss S.J. Martin L.J. Levey A.I. Price D.L. Huganir R.L.

For phosphorylation reactions, 1 μg of purified fusion protein was incubated with 10 ng of CaM kinase II for 30 min at 30 °C in a 100-μl total volume. Phosphorylation reaction buffer contained 10 mm HEPES (pH 7.5), 10 mm MgCl2, 800 μm CaCl2, 50 μm[γ-32P]ATP (2200 cpm/pmol), and 10 μg/ml calmodulin. Reactions were quenched by the addition of 50 μl of 3 × SDS-PAGE sample buffer and the fusion proteins resolved on 14% gels. Fusion proteins were excised from gels for phosphopeptide mapping. QT6 cells were maintained and transfected with a total of 20 μg of cDNA using calcium phosphate coprecipitation as described previously (33Tingley W.G. Ehlers M.D. Kameyama K. Doherty C. Ptak J.B.

Res. 1993; 18: 105-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar), and the immunoprecipitate resolved by SDS-PAGE on 7.5% acrylamide gels. Slices containing 32P-labeled GluR1 were excised from gels for phosphopeptide mapping. For immunoblot analysis, cells were treated with drugs or vehicle solutions as indicated 48 h after transfection, rinsed in phosphate-buffered saline, scraped into 1 ml of resuspension buffer (RB) consisting of 10 mm sodium phosphate (pH 7.0), 100 mm NaCl, 10 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 50 mm sodium fluoride, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 5 mm EDTA, 5 mm EGTA, 1 μmokadaic acid, 1 μm microcystin-LR, and 10 units/ml aprotinin and then sonicated and centrifuged at 100,000 ×g for 1 h. The membrane pellets were resuspended in 200 μl of RB including 1% SDS and then diluted with 800 μl of RB including 1% Triton X-100. The resulting extracts were spun at 14,000 × g for 15 min, the supernatants loaded onto SDS-PAGE gels as membrane preparations, and the resulting gels transferred to PVDF membranes. The hippocampi of 6–8-week-old male Sprague-Dawley rats were prepared as described (33Tingley W.G. Ehlers M.D. Kameyama K. Doherty C. Ptak J.B. Riley C.T. Huganir R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 5157-5166Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (442) Google Scholar). Briefly, the hippocampi were dissected and chilled in ice-cold ACSF solution (126 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 1.25 mm NaH2PO4, 25 mmNaHCO3, 10 mmd-glucose, 2 mm CaCl2, 2 mm MgCl2, saturated with 95%O2, 5% CO2). Slices (400 μm) were prepared and incubated in ACSF solution for 60 min at room temperature before transferring 8–10 slices to a 35-mm diameter dish containing 1 ml of ACSF solution in a humidified chamber. Following a 20-min incubation, slices were treated with 100 nm phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate, 20 μm forskolin, or 10 μm KN-62 for 15 min. The slices were then transferred in 5 ml of ice-cold ACSF solution to wash out the drug. Cell homogenates were prepared by sonication of the slices on ice with 1 ml of RB for 30 s. The homogenates were centrifuged at 12,000 ×g for 5 min, the membrane pellets resuspended in SDS sample buffer, and the samples resolved by SDS-PAGE on 7.5% acrylamide gels. PVDF membranes were incubated 1 h in TBS with 1% bovine serum albumin and 0.1% Triton X-100. The membranes were then incubated overnight in TBS with 1% bovine serum albumin, 0.1% Triton X-100, 2 mm MnCl2, and, where indicated, with 400 units/ml λ-phosphatase (New England Biolabs). The membranes were then blocked with 0.5% nonfat dry milk (Carnation) and 0.1% Tween 20 in TBS for 1 h, incubated 90 min with primary antibodies (150–500 ng/ml in blocking buffer), washed 3 × 5 min with blocking buffer, and incubated 30 min with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit Ig (1:5000 in blocking buffer). After final washes in blocking buffer (3 × 10 min) the membranes were rinsed in TBS and immersed in chemiluminescence detection reagent (NEN Life Science Products) for 15 s and then exposed to X-AR film. Exposure times ranged from 30 s to 5 min. Immunoblots were analyzed on a Molecular Dynamics Personal Densitometer. Gel slices containing fusion proteins or immunoprecipitated GluR1 were digested with trypsin (0.3 mg/ml) and spotted onto a thin layer chromatography (TLC) plate (36Huganir R.L. Miles K. Greengard P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1984; 81: 6968-6972Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). The peptides were then resolved by electrophoresis in the first dimension in pyridine/acetic acid/H2O, 1:19:89 (v/v), and ascending chromatography in the second dimension in pyridine/butanol/acetic acid/H2O, 15:10:3:12 (v/v) (36Huganir R.L. Miles K. Greengard P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1984; 81: 6968-6972Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). The TLC plates were placed in PhosphoImager cassettes and visualized on a Molecular Dynamics PhosphoImager using ImageQuantTM software. To generate phosphorylation site-specific antibodies, we injected rabbits with synthetic peptides which had been chemically modified to include phosphorylated serines at either Ser-831 or Ser-845 (see “Experimental Procedures”). The resulting antibodies, anti-S831-P and anti-S845-P, specifically recognize only the appropriately phosphorylated forms of GluR1 and were used to analyze phosphorylation of GluR1 in QT6 fibroblasts which had been transfected with wild-type GluR1 (Fig. 1). Both of these antibodies detected only low levels of GluR1 in GluR1-transfected QT6 cells, consistent with a low basal level of phosphorylation of GluR1 in these cells. However, when the QT6 cells were treated with phorbol esters or forskolin to activate PKC or PKA, respectively, the anti-S831-P and anti-S845-P antibodies specifically recognized GluR1 (Fig. 1). Mutation of serines 831 or 845 to alanine residues eliminated recognition of GluR1 by the appropriate antibody, demonstrating their specificity. In addition, phosphatase treatment of the PVDF membrane prior to immunoblotting abolished immunorecognition by both antibodies demonstrating the phosphorylation dependence of the anti-S831-P and anti-S845-P antibodies. In addition to the 106-kDa GluR1 receptor, the phosphorylation site-specific antibodies each recognized a low molecular mass protein that was present in non-transfected cells. The GluR1 phosphorylation-site specific antibodies did not detect other AMPA receptor subunits (GluR2–4) expressed under similar conditions, demonstrating the specificity of these antibodies for GluR1 (Fig.2).Figure 2Specificity of phosphorylation site-specific antibodies. HEK293 cells were transfected with various AMPA receptor subunit cDNAs (GluR1-GluR4) and treated with phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (100 nm) and forskolin (10 μm). The transfected cell membranes were then separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred to PVDF membrane. The membranes were immunoblotted by the GluR1 phosphorylation site-specific antibodies or AMPA receptor subunit(s)-specific antibodies as indicated.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Because of the central role of CaM kinase II in the induction and maintenance of LTP, we have used the phosphorylation specific antibodies to examine whether CaM kinase II can phosphorylate Ser-831 and Ser-845. Treatment of the QT6 cells with the calcium ionophore A23187 increased phosphorylation of GluR1 on Ser-831 with little effect on phosphorylation of Ser-845 (see Fig.3). The specific CaM kinase II inhibitor KN-62 (37Tokumitsu H. Chijiwa T. Hagiwara M. Mizutani A. Terasawa M. Hidaka H. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 4315-4320Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) antagonized this ionophore-induced phosphorylation. Furthermore, cotransfection of a constitutively active form of CaM kinase II (actCaMKII) with GluR1 resulted in a dramatic increase in the phosphorylation of Ser-831 without significant phosphorylation of Ser-845. These results suggest that CaM kinase II, in addition to PKC, can specifically phosphorylate Ser-831 in the GluR1 subunit. To confirm that Ser-831 is directly phosphorylated by CaM kinase II, we performed in vitro phosphorylations using purified CaM kinase II with purified fusion proteins corresponding to the C terminus of GluR1. As shown in Fig. 4, the GluR1 C-terminal fusion protein was phosphorylated by CaM kinase II. However, mutation of Ser-831 completely eliminated this phosphorylation. To further analyze this phosphorylation, the CaM kinase II-phosphorylated fusion protein was cut from the gel, digested with trypsin, and subjected to two-dimensional phosphopeptide map analysis (Fig. 4). Three major phosphopeptides were detected which were eliminated by mutation of Ser-831. These three phosphopeptides (phosphopeptides 3, 4, and 6; numbering is based on previous studies (28Blackstone C. Murphy T.H. Moss S.J. Baraban J.M. Huganir R.L. J. Neurosci. 1994; 14: 7585-7593Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 29Roche K.W. O'Brien R.J. Mammen A.L. Bernhardt J. Huganir R.L. Neuron. 1996; 16: 1179-1188Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (652) Google Scholar)) have been previously characterized to be partial tryptic phosphopeptides containing Ser-831 (29Roche K.W. O'Brien R.J. Mammen A.L. Bernhardt J. Huganir R.L. Neuron. 1996; 16: 1179-1188Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (652) Google Scholar). We also performed two-dimensional phosphopeptide map analysis on GluR1 isolated from transfected QT6 cells which had been prelabeled with [32P]orthophosphate. As has been described, control cells contained three major phosphopeptides (numbers 1, 3, and 7). Phosphopeptide number 3, as discussed above, contains Ser-831 while phosphopeptide numbers 1 and 7 are unidentified phosphorylation sites. Stimulation of cells with phorbol esters resulted in increased phosphorylation of phosphopeptide numbers 3 and 6 with a small increase in phosphorylation of phosphopeptide number 1 (Fig. 3). Cotransfection of GluR1 with actCaMKII resulted in a dramatic increase in phosphorylation of phosphopeptide numbers 3 and 6 (which contains Ser-831) and a small but reproducible increase in phosphorylation of phosphopeptide number 1. No additional phosphopeptides were present in phosphopeptide maps of GluR1 from cells cotransfected with actCaMKII. These results suggest that Ser-831 is the major phosphorylation site for CaM kinase II. Taken together with the data presented above, these results strongly suggest that CaM kinase II directly phosphorylates Ser-831 on the GluR1 subunit. Previous studies have suggested that Ser-627 is the major CaMKII phosphorylation site on GluR1 (31Yakel J.L. Vissavajjhala P. Derkach V.A. Brickey D.A. Soderling T.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 1376-1380Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). However, recent studies have suggested that this serine residue is located on the extracellular region of GluR1 and should not be accessible to protein kinases (38Wo Z.G. Oswald R.E. Trends Neurosci. 1995; 18: 161-168Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar). We therefore tested to see if mutation of Ser-627 to an alanine residue effected CaMKII phosphorylation of GluR1. As shown in Fig.5, phosphopeptide maps of the S627A mutant GluR1 subunit were identical to wild-type and phosphorylation of phosphopeptide numbers 3 and 6 by CaMKII was still observed. To analyze phosphorylation of GluR1 in vivo we have used the phosphorylation site-specific antibodies to examine hippocampal slice preparations. Both the anti-S831-P and anti-S845-P antibodies recognize GluR1 on immunoblots of hippocampal slices, suggesting that Ser-831 and Ser-845 are basally phosphorylated. As in the QT6 cell experiments, pretreating the immunoblots with phosphatase abolished staining with the phosphospecific antibodies (data not shown). Similarly, preblocking the phosphospecific antibodies with the appropriate phosphorylated peptide abolished antibody recognition of GluR1. In contrast, incubation of phosphospecific antibodies with the equivalent non-phosphorylated peptides did not block antibody recognition of GluR1 (data not shown). To quantitate the relative degree of GluR1 phosphorylation in control slices and in slices that had been treated with drugs to regulate the various kinases, we calculated the ratio of the intensity of GluR1 labeling with the phosphorylation site-specific antibodies over the intensity of labeling with a C-terminal phosphorylation-independent GluR1 antibody. Treatment of the slices with phorbol esters and forskolin increased the phosphorylation of Ser-831 (intensity ratio = 2.09 ± 0.73 of control; n = 3) and Ser-845 (intensity ratio = 2.72 ± 0.14 of control;n = 3), respectively, confirming that PKC and PKA phosphorylate these sites in vivo (Fig.6). Phorbol ester treatment of the slices also significantly (p < 0.05) and reproducibly increased the phosphorylation of Ser-845. As shown in Fig. 1, this effect was not observed in transfected cells. Treatment of the slices with the calcium ionophore A23187 caused a decrease in the phosphorylation of Ser-831 and Ser-845 (data not shown), presumably due to the activation of calcium-regulated protein phosphatases. However, treatment of the slices with the CaM kinase II inhibitor KN-62 significantly (p < 0.05) inhibited phosphorylation of Ser-831 (intensity ratio = 0.71 ± 0.04 of control;n = 4), with little effect on Ser-845 phosphorylation, strongly suggesting that CaM kinase II phosphorylates Ser-831 in vivo. Protein phosphorylation is an important mechanism for the regulation of AMPA receptor function (22Swope S.L. Moss S.J. Blackstone C.D. Huganir R.L. FASEB J. 1991; 6: 2514-2523Crossref Scopus (209) Google Scholar, 23Raymond L.A. Blackstone C.D. Huganir R.L.

Neurosci. 1994; 4: 383-388Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). For example, we have previously shown that the AMPA receptor GluR1 subunit is phosphorylated by PKC and PKA on Ser-831 and Ser-845, respectively, and that phosphorylation of Ser-845 by PKA potentiates AMPA receptor function (29Roche K.W. O'Brien R.J. Mammen A.L. Bernhardt J. Huganir R.L. Neuron. 1996; 16: 1179-1188Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (652) Google Scholar). Additional studies have demonstrated that AMPA receptors are phosphorylated by CaM kinase II (27Tan S.-E. Wenthold R.J. Soderling T.R. J. Neurosci. 1994; 14: 1123-1129Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 30McGlade-McCulloh E. Yamamoto H. Tan S.-E. Brickey D.A. Soderling T.R. Nature. 1993; 362: 640-642Crossref PubMed Scopus (337) Google Scholar) and have suggested that CaM kinase II phosphorylation potentiates AMPA receptor function (30McGlade-McCulloh E. Yamamoto H. Tan S.-E. Brickey D.A. Soderling T.R. Nature. 1993; 362: 640-642Crossref PubMed Scopus (337) Google Scholar, 31Yakel J.L. Vissavajjhala P. Derkach V.A. Brickey D.A. Soderling T.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 1376-1380Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). However, the site of CaM kinase II phosphorylation has not been unequivocally determined (29Roche K.W. O'Brien R.J. Mammen A.L. Bernhardt J. Huganir R.L. Neuron. 1996; 16: 1179-1188Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (652) Google Scholar, 31Yakel J.L. Vissavajjhala P. Derkach V.A. Brickey D.A. Soderling T.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 1376-1380Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Recent studies using site-specific mutagenesis and electrophysiological techniques have suggested that serine 627 is phosphorylated by CaMKII (31Yakel J.L. Vissavajjhala P. Derkach V.A. Brickey D.A. Soderling T.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 1376-1380Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). However, this region of the GluR1 subunit is now believed to be located in an extracellular region of the GluR1 subunit where it would not be accessible to CaMKII (38Wo Z.G. Oswald R.E. Trends Neurosci. 1995; 18: 161-168Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar). In addition, previous studies in our laboratory have found no evidence that CaMKII phosphorylates serine 627 (29Roche K.W. O'Brien R.J. Mammen A.L. Bernhardt J. Huganir R.L. Neuron. 1996; 16: 1179-1188Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (652) Google Scholar). Interestingly, in our previous study we found that cotransfection of actCaMKII with GluR1 in HEK-293 cells did not increase phosphorylation of GluR1 (29Roche K.W. O'Brien R.J. Mammen A.L. Bernhardt J. Huganir R.L. Neuron. 1996; 16: 1179-1188Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (652) Google Scholar). This was most likely due to the high basal phosphorylation of GluR1 on serine 831 in these cells (29Roche K.W. O'Brien R.J. Mammen A.L. Bernhardt J. Huganir R.L. Neuron. 1996; 16: 1179-1188Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (652) Google Scholar). In the current study we have used QT6 cells which have a relatively low basal phosphorylation of serine 831, which has allowed us to study the phosphorylation of this site by CaMKII. Using phosphorylation site-specific antibodies we have demonstrated that CaM kinase II phosphorylates Ser-831 in vitro and in vivo. Cotransfection of GluR1 and constitutively active CaM kinase II in QT6 cells leads to the specific phosphorylation of Ser-831. In addition, purified CaM kinase II specifically phosphorylates a fusion protein of the C-terminal domain of GluR1 on Ser-831. Furthermore, we have shown that Ser-831 is likely to be phosphorylated by CaM kinase II in vivo, since hippocampal slices incubated with the specific CaM kinase II inhibitor KN-62 have reduced levels of Ser-831 phosphorylation. Anti-S831-P and anti-S845-P were also used to demonstrate that treatment of hippocampal slices with phorbol esters and forskolin leads to increased phosphorylation of Ser-831 and Ser-845, respectively. Interestingly, we also found that Ser-831 and Ser-845 were both basally phosphorylated in hippocampal slices. In contrast, these residues are only phosphorylated following synaptic activity or stimulation with phorbol esters or forskolin in neuronal cortical cultures (28Blackstone C. Murphy T.H. Moss S.J. Baraban J.M. Huganir R.L. J. Neurosci. 1994; 14: 7585-7593Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Although the amino acid sequence surrounding Ser-845 (LPRNSGAGA) is consistent with the known consensus sites for PKA (RXS) (39Pearson R.B. Kemp B.E. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 200A: 61-81Google Scholar), the sequence surrounding Ser-831 (LIPQQSINEA) does not fit the consensus sites for CaMKII and PKC, which usually contain basic residues close to the phosphorylated serine residue (39Pearson R.B. Kemp B.E. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 200A: 61-81Google Scholar). However, Ser-831 contains hydrophobic residues at the −5 (Leu) and +1 (Ile) positions and recent studies have suggested that hydrophobic residues at these positions are very important for substrate recognition by CamKII (40Stokoe D. Caudwell F.B. Cohen P.T.W. Cohen P. Biochem. J. 1993; 296: 843-849Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). These sites are not conserved on the other AMPA receptor subunits (GluR2–4), however, it is possible that GluR2–4 are phosphorylated by PKA, PKC, or CaMKII on other sites. Since CaM kinase II is required for the induction and maintenance of LTP (10Malinow R. Schulman H. Tsien R.W. Science. 1989; 245: 862-866Crossref PubMed Scopus (1033) Google Scholar, 11Malenka R.C.

Science. 1992; 257: 206-209Crossref PubMed Scopus (1068) Google Scholar), it has been proposed that direct phosphorylation of glutamate receptors by CaM kinase II may underlie the postsynaptic component of this potentiation. The phosphospecific antibodies we have characterized here should prove useful in monitoring the phosphorylation state of GluR1 to see if it correlates with synaptic plasticity during models of learning and memory such as LTP and LTD."

Nacre consists of layers of interlocking thin tablets of aragonite (one of the polymorphs of CaCO3) typically 400 nm thick and 5–10 μm wide surrounded on all sides by thin sheets of organic matrix approximately 30 nm thick (7Nakahara H.

The thickness of the mineral tablets apparently is determined by the matrix sheets (22Belcher A.M. Wu X.H. Christensen R.J. Hansma P.K. Stucky G.D. Morse D.E.

Biomineralisation. 1972; 6: 141-159Google Scholar). Electron microscopy, x-ray, and electron diffraction have shown that each sheet consists of a chitin-like core sandwiched between two layers of protein (12Weiner S. Traub W. Philos. Trans. R. Soc. Lond. B Biol. Sci. 1984; 304: 425-434Crossref Google Scholar, 28Weiner S. Traub W. FEBS Lett. 1980; 111: 311-316Crossref Scopus (242) Google Scholar, 29Weiner S. Crit. Rev.

FEBS Lett. 1980; 111: 311-316Crossref Scopus (242) Google Scholar), a finding supported by the fact that glycine and alanine are the most abundant amino acids (8Meenakshi V.R. Hare P.E. Wilbur K.M. Comp. Biochem. Physiol. 1971; 40B: 1037-1043Google Scholar, 9Gregoire C. Florkin M. Scheer B. Chemistry and Zoology. Academic Press, New York1972: 45-102Google Scholar, 29Weiner S. Crit. Rev.

Springer-Verlag, New York1991: 343-350Crossref Google Scholar). A glycine- and alanine-rich matrix protein recently was cloned from the nacre-producing tissue of the bivalve,Pinctada fucata (39Sudo S. Fujikawa T. Nagakura T. Ohkubo T. Sakaguchi K. Tanaka M. Nakashima K. Takahashi T. Nature. 1997; 387: 583-584Crossref Scopus (341) Google Scholar), and a matrix protein rich in glycine, lysine, and valine has been extracted and characterized from the abalone, Haliotis rufescens (40Bowen C.E. Tang H. Comp. Biochem. Physiol. 1996; 115A: 269-275Crossref Scopus (48) Google Scholar). To understand the molecular mechanisms governing self-assembly of the matrix and biomineralization of nacre, one of us (A. M. B) has developed a procedure for extraction of other classes of matrix proteins from the nacre of H. rufescens shell and flat pearl with urea and SDS (31.Belcher, A. M., Spatial and Temporal Resolution of Interfaces, Phase Transitions and Isolation of Three Families of Proteins in Calcium Carbonate-based Biocomposite Materials. Ph.D. thesis, 1996, University of California, Santa Barbara, CA.Google Scholar). Here we report the complete amino acid sequence of one of these proteins which we have named Lustrin A. The results reveal a new class of shell matrix protein, with a repeating modular structure containing sequences similar to those of two extracellular matrix protein superfamilies known from other animal tissues. Rapidly growing specimens (75–100 mm) of red abalone (H. rufescens), a gastropod mollusc, were obtained from The Cultured Abalone Inc. (Goleta, CA). Total RNA was isolated from the mantle, muscle, gill, and stomach tissues using TriZOL reagent (Life Technologies, Inc.) and the modified TRI Reagent procedure for RNA isolation (41Chomzynski P. Mackey K. Biotechniques. 1995; 19: 942-945PubMed Google Scholar). The mantle pallial cell layer (responsible for secretion of the organic and inorganic precursors of the shell) was extracted by vigorous shaking with TriZOL reagent; the underlying muscle was discarded. Other tissues were homogenized in TriZOL reagent (stomach contents were removed before the tissue was homogenized). Poly(A)+ RNA from mantle tissue was isolated using the Poly(A)Tract mRNA isolation system IV (Promega Corp.) with the following modifications: annealed oligo(dT)-mRNA hybrids were washed with 0.2 × SSC (0.03 m sodium chloride, 0.003 m sodium citrate) instead of 0.1 × SSC; the elution of mRNA was performed at 40 °C instead of at room temperature. Degenerate oligonucleotide primers for PCR amplification were synthesized to correspond to portions of the N-terminal sequence and an internal sequence determined for one of the purified matrix proteins (Table I) (31.Belcher, A. M., Spatial and Temporal Resolution of Interfaces, Phase Transitions and Isolation of Three Families of Proteins in Calcium Carbonate-based Biocomposite Materials. Ph.D. thesis, 1996, University of California, Santa Barbara, CA.Google Scholar). Degenerate primer D1 (GARCCNGGNYTRAAYGT) encoding EPGLNV, a part of the N-terminal peptide, and D2 (CARCANACNCCNGGYTT) corresponding to the antisense strand of the sequence encoding KPGVCC, a part of the internal peptide, were obtained from Cruachem Inc. Mantle mRNA (200 ng) was used for RT primed with a poly(dT)12–18 primer; the reaction was catalyzed by Superscript II reverse transcriptase (Life Technologies, Inc.) in a 20-μl reaction. The resulting cDNA then was diluted to 200 μl with H2O, and 2 μl were used in the PCR reaction which also included 2 μm of each primer (D1 and D2), 1 × AmpliTaq DNA polymerase buffer (Perkin Elmer), 2 mmMgCl2, 200 μm dNTP, 5% (v/v) formamide, and 1 unit of AmpliTaq DNA polymerase (Perkin Elmer). PCR amplification (performed in a Cetus DNA Thermal Cycler from Perkin Elmer) conditions included an initial step at 94 °C for 5 min followed by 40 cycles at 94 °C for 1 min, 47 °C for 1.5 min, and 72 °C for 1.5 min. A final extension step of 72 °C for 7 min was performed after the cycles. PCR reactions with only one degenerate primer (D1 or D2) were incubated in parallel as negative controls.Table IAmino acid sequences from polypeptidesPeptideSequencePosition in predicted amino acid sequenceN-terminalLRRAPYPX(EPGLNV)XCTT20–37Internal 1PPA(KPGVCC)FNP100–111Internal 2TGXVVGAQGSA209–219 Open table in a new tab Approximately 5 μg of mantle poly(A)+ RNA, isolated from four animals, was used to construct the cDNA using the Stratagene ZAP Express cDNA synthesis protocol. Small cDNA molecules were removed by gel filtration over Sephacryl S-400. The cDNA then was inserted into the lambda ZAP Express vector and packaged with the Gigapack II Gold extract from Stratagene. The primary library contained 1.2 × 106 plaque-forming units (PFU) and was subsequently amplified once to yield a titer of 2 × 106 PFU/μl with a frequency of nonrecombinant lambda vectors below 0.1%. The library was first screened by PCR amplification. Two gene-specific primers, GTCGTTGTGGAGTGCGT (G1) corresponding to nucleotides (nt) 65–81 of the 242-bp RT-PCR product (Fig. 1), and ACCTCGAACACACCCAG (G2) matching the antisense sequence of nt 200–216 of the same RT-PCR product, were obtained from Cruachem Inc. PCR screening reactions were carried out under the same conditions as described above with the following changes: no formamide was added to the reactions, the denaturation step was shortened to 30 s, annealing was done at 62 °C for 1 min, and extension was performed for 45 s. The appearance of a 142-bp PCR product indicated the existence of a positive clone. Initially, approximately 5 × 105 PFU from the mantle cDNA library were plated onto ten 150-mm NZY plates at a density of 50,000 PFU per plate. Phage particles from each plate were eluted into 8 ml of SM buffer (0.1 m NaCl, 10 mm MgSO4, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, and 0.01% w/v gelatin), and 1 μl of each separate phage suspension was used in the PCR reaction. Ten PCR reactions were performed (one for each of the ten plates); nine generated the 142-bp product. Phage suspension from one of the nine positive plates was chosen randomly and diluted for secondary screening; the phage were plated onto twenty 100-mm NZY plates at a density of 2,500 PFU per plate. PCR reactions were performed for each of the 20 plates; four yielded the 142-bp product. Phage suspension from one of these four positive plates was again chosen randomly; further dilutions were made and PCR screenings were conducted sequentially as above. After four rounds of dilution and PCR screening, a single positive clone (designated clone 1) was isolated (Fig. 1). The 993-bp insert of clone 1 was labeled with digoxigenin-11-dUTP (DIG) using a Genius DNA random labeling kit (Boehringer Mannheim) and used to screen the library again. Hybridization was carried out at 42 °C in 50% formamide, 2% blocking reagent (Boehringer Mannheim), 5 × SSC, 0.1% sarkosyl, and 0.02% SDS. Filters were washed in 0.5 × SSC and 0.1% SDS at 65 °C for 1 h. Probe binding was detected using an anti-DIG Fab conjugated to alkaline phosphatase, and colorimetric detection was done with nitro blue tetrazolium and 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate according to the protocol recommended by Boehringer Mannheim. Reverse transcription was carried out as described above using gene-specific primer G2. The sequence of G2 matches that of the antisense strand of nt 274–290 of the longest clone (clone 5) isolated from the library (Fig. 1). A second gene-specific primer TCGAACACACCCAGTGGTTG (G3), corresponding to the antisense sequence of nt 268–287 of clone 5, was used in the PCR reaction. The conditions for tailing and PCR reaction were as described previously (42Frohman M.A. Innis M.A. Gelfand D.H. Sninsky J.J. White T.J. PCR Protocols: a Guide to Methods and Applications. Academic Press, New York1990: 28-38Google Scholar). Inserts of the λ clones were excised in vivo into the pBK-CMV phagemid vector. PCR products were subcloned into the pBluescript vector. They were sequenced by the dideoxynucleotide chain termination method (43Sanger F. Nicklen S. Coulson A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 5463-5467Crossref PubMed Scopus (52610) Google Scholar) using Sequenase Version 2.0 (U. S. Biochemical Corp.). Oligonucleotide primers were synthesized (Operon Technologies, Inc.) to permit sequencing of both strands of the entire clone. Compressions resulting from secondary structures in the DNA were eliminated by replacing dGTP with dITP. Sequence data were analyzed with the Wisconsin Sequence Analysis Package by Genetics Computer Group, Inc. Samples of 25 μg of total RNA from various tissues were electrophoresed on a 1.4% agarose formaldehyde gel, transferred to a Hybond-N+ nylon membrane (Amersham), and UV-cross-linked to the membrane. The membrane was hybridized with33P-labeled cDNA probe at 42 °C in 50% formamide, 5 × SSPE (0.75 m NaCl, 0.05 mNaH2PO4, 0.005 m EDTA), 5 × Denhardt's solution (0.1% Ficoll, 0.1% polyvinylpyrrolidone, and 0.1% bovine serum albumin), 0.5% SDS, 200 μg/ml salmon sperm DNA for 12 h, and washed in 1 × SSC, 0.5% SDS at 55 °C for 30 min before being exposed to Kodak X-Omat film. The first Lustrin A cDNA clone was isolated using the RT-PCR strategy. Two degenerate primers, D1 and D2, were designed corresponding to the N terminus and an internal peptide sequence of Lustrin A (see “Materials and Methods”). A prominent 242-bp product was generated from mantle mRNA using these primers (Fig. 1). Nucleotide sequences at the two ends of this fragment matched those of D1 and D2. The deduced amino acid sequences at the N and C termini of the amplified fragment were (EPGLNV)NCTT and PPA(KPGVCC), respectively. EPGLNV and KPGVCC were used to design D1 and D2 and therefore were present as expected. NCTT immediately following EPGLNV and PPA immediately preceding KPGVCC were perfect matches to the N-terminal and the internal peptide sequences of Lustrin A (TableI) (31.Belcher, A. M., Spatial and Temporal Resolution of Interfaces, Phase Transitions and Isolation of Three Families of Proteins in Calcium Carbonate-based Biocomposite Materials. Ph.D. thesis, 1996, University of California, Santa Barbara, CA.Google Scholar), thus confirming the correspondence of the amplified 242-bp fragment with part of the sequence encoding Lustrin A. Two gene-specific primers, G1 and G2, were designed based on the sequence obtained from this fragment (see “Materials and Methods”). To obtain a full-length cDNA clone of Lustrin A, a cDNA library was constructed starting from mRNA extracted from the mantle pallial cells that secrete the shell precursors. This library was screened by PCR using the gene-specific primers G1 and G2 as described under “Materials and Methods.” One positive clone (clone 1) was isolated; its insert of 993 bp included the original 242-bp RT-PCR fragment, and the deduced polypeptide sequence contained a perfect match for a second internal peptide sequence of Lustrin A (Fig. 1). Although this result verified that clone 1 encodes Lustrin A, it apparently does not contain the full-length cDNA as it lacks both the start and stop codons. Rescreening the mantle cDNA library with a DIG-labeled insert from clone 1 resulted in the identification of 15 positive clones from approximately one million clones. DNA was extracted from all 15 clones, and restriction mapping analyses were performed. Based on the resulting restriction patterns, the 15 clones can be classified into two groups. One group contained four positive clones for Lustrin A. The longest clone (designated clone 5) had an insert of 4,407 base pairs (Fig. 1). The other group contained 11 clones that exhibit restriction patterns different from that of Lustrin A. The partial nucleotide sequence of clone 7 in the second group was found to encode a polypeptide almost identical to Lustrin A with the exception of a few single amino acid substitutions (Fig. 2) and deletions (data not shown) in the region sequenced. 5′-Rapid amplification of cDNA ends was used to obtain the start codon and its flanking sequence (see “Materials and Methods”). This yielded a 319-bp fragment that provided the first 32 nt of the Lustrin A cDNA (Fig.1). Northern analysis revealed that Lustrin A mRNA is expressed specifically by cells of the mantle epithelium (Fig. 3). Three probes, representing the 5′-, middle, and 3′-regions of the full-length Lustrin A cDNA, were used: nt 33–1699, nt 3333–3824, and nt 3824–4439. The first of these probes hybridized to two RNA species, 4.7 kilobases (kb) and 5.5 kb in size, respectively, in the RNA isolated from the mantle pallial tissue but not in the RNA from muscle, gill, or stomach tissues. Identical results were obtained when the other two probes were used (data not shown). Sequence analysis of the 4,439-bp cDNA of Lustrin A revealed an open reading frame encoding 1,428 amino acids with the translation initiation codon ATG at nucleotide position 26 (Fig. 1 B). At position −3 from this initiation codon there exists an adenine nucleotide, and at position +4 there is a guanine nucleotide, representative of a Kozak initiation sequence (44Kozak M. Cell. 1986; 44: 283-292Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3583) Google Scholar). The first 19 amino acids apparently comprise a signal peptide. It has a hydrophobic core of 11 residues flanked by relatively hydrophilic residues, including a basic arginine residue near the N terminus, similar to known signal peptides found in proteins that are processed in the endoplasmic reticulum and subsequently secreted from the cell. A glycine residue found before the expected cleavage site is consistent with the rule of von Heijne (45von Heijne G. J. Mol. Biol. 1985; 184: 99-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (1532) Google Scholar). An in-frame stop codon is located at nucleotide position 4309, with a putative polyadenylation signal AATAAT located 13 nucleotides downstream from the stop codon and 10 nucleotides upstream from the poly(A) tail. It thus is very likely that this cDNA represents the full-length copy of the Lustrin A mRNA coding region. Based on the predicted amino acid sequence, Lustrin A is rich in Ser (16%), Pro (14%), Gly (13%), and Cys (9%) residues (Table II) and contains 15 potential N-glycosylation sites. The calculated mass for Lustrin A before any post-translational modifications is 116 kDa.Table IIPredicted amino acid composition from the coding region of Lustrin AAmino acidResiduesMol %Ser23416.39Pro19813.87Gly19113.38Cys1319.17Val896.23Ala855.95Thr765.32Arg704.90Leu634.41Gln563.92Asp553.85Lys322.24Glu302.10Ile292.03Tyr281.96Phe241.68Asn181.26Trp120.84His50.35Met20.14Total1428 Open table in a new tab The deduced amino acid sequence of Lustrin A reveals that it has a modular structure (Fig. 4). Ten cysteine-rich repeats (C1–C10) were identified in Lustrin A. Each repeat consists of 75 to 88 amino acid residues, of which 12 are cysteine. The last two cysteine residues in each repeat are arranged as a Cys-Cys segment, while other cysteine residues are spaced by stretches of 4 to 15 residues. The 10 cysteine-rich repeats share a high degree of sequence identity (45–90%) with each other (Fig.5). Cys-X-Cys and Cys-X-X-Cys segments, which are frequently found in heavy metal-binding proteins, are not present in these repeats. These repeats also show no sequence similarity to any of the known calcium-binding motifs in the PROSITE data bank. Near the N terminus of each repeat there is a conserved NCT sequence containing a potential site for N-glycosylation. The regularity and high conservation of its position in each of the cysteine-rich domains suggest a possible functional role. A second potential N-glycosylation site also is present near the center of C1, C2, C4, and C6 (Fig. 5).Figure 5Sequence alignment of the 10 cysteine-rich domains (C1–C10) of Lustrin A.

https://openalex.org/W2054773029,"A role for sphingolipids in the yeast heat stress response has been suggested by the isolation of suppressors of mutants lacking these lipids, which are unable to grow at elevated temperatures. The current study examines the possible role of sphingolipids in the heat adaptation of yeast cells as monitored by growth and viability studies. The suppressor of long chain base auxotrophy (SLC, strain 7R4) showed a heat-sensitive phenotype that was corrected by transformation with serine palmitoyltransferase. Thus, the deficiency in sphingolipids and not the suppressor mutation was the cause of the heat-sensitive phenotype of the SLC strain 7R4. The ability of sphingolipids to rescue the heat-sensitive phenotype was examined, and two endogenous yeast sphingoid backbones, phytosphingosine and dihydrosphingosine, were found to be most potent in this effect. Next, the effect of heat stress on the levels of the three major classes of sphingolipids was determined. The inositol phosphoceramides showed no change over a 1.5-h time course. However, the four detected species of sphingoid bases increased after 15 min of heat stress from 1.4- to 10.8-fold. The largest increases were seen in two sphingoid bases, C20 phytosphingosine and C20 dihydrosphingosine, which increased 6.4- and 10.8-fold over baseline, respectively. At 60 min of heat stress two species of yeast ceramide increased by 9.2- and 10.6-fold over baseline. The increase seen in the ceramides was partially decreased by Fumonisin B1, a ceramide synthase inhibitor. Therefore, heat stress induces accumulation of sphingoid bases and of ceramides, probably through de novo synthesis. Taken together, these results demonstrate that sphingolipids are involved in the yeast heat stress adaptation.

The initial phase of the response is the gaining of thermotolerance, and an increase in trehalose accumulation is proposed as a marker for this event (3Wiemken A. Antonie Leeuwenhoek. 1990; 58: 209-217Crossref PubMed Scopus (452) Google Scholar). This is accompanied by the induction of heat shock proteins (4Lindquist S. Craig E.A. Annu. Rev. Genet. 1988; 22: 631-677Crossref PubMed Scopus (4418) Google Scholar) and a G1 arrest in cell cycle that lasts for a period of approximately 1 h (5Shin D.Y. Matsumoto K. Iida H. Uno I. Ishikawa T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 244-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Once thermotolerance is gained, the second phase of the response occurs when the yeast begin to grow at the increased temperature. At this point, trehalose is degraded in an HSP70-dependent process (6Hottiger T. De Virgilio C. Bell W. Boller T. Wiemken A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1992; 210: 125-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar), and the cells begin to cycle and resume growth. Therefore, the ability of yeast to grow under increased temperature provides for an overall assessment of the heat stress response. However, the mechanisms that mediate adaptation and growth under the heat-stressed state are not fully defined. The isolation of suppressors of mutants lacking sphingolipids in yeast (Table I) has suggested a possible role for sphingolipids in the heat stress response. The initial mutation is a Ura disruption knockout of the serine palmitoyltransferase (SPT) gene (LCB1) (7Wells G.B. Lester R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 10200-10203Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), which catalyzes the first step of sphingolipid biosynthesis (Fig.1). Consequently, the 1Δ4 strain lacks all sphingolipids. This yeast strain (1Δ4) is unable to grow at normal temperatures without sphingoid backbone supplementation to the media (7Wells G.B. Lester R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 10200-10203Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Suppressors (7R4 and 4R3) of the aforementioned mutant have been isolated, and were found to allow growth in the absence of sphingolipid supplementation, possibly as a result of the formation of novel inositol glycerolipids. The novel inositol glycerolipids contain: 1) the 26 carbon fatty acid that is ordinarily exclusively found in the yeast sphingolipids; and 2) the same head groups that are found in the inositol phosphoceramides, now attached to a glycerol backbone (8Dickson R.C. Wells G.B. Schmidt A. Lester R.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 2176-2181Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 9Lester R.L. Wells G.B. Oxford G. Dickson R.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 845-856Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, these sphingolipid compensatory strains are able to grow at normal temperatures but with a slower doubling time than the wild-type strain (SJ21R). However, the SLC 1The abbreviations used are: SLC, sphingolipid compensatory; IPC, inositol phosphoceramide; HPLC, high pressure liquid chromatography; TLC, thin layer chromatography. strains still lack all sphingolipids. The SLC strains were found not to grow under conditions of cellular stress such as high osmolarity and increased ambient temperature. However, the heat-sensitive phenotype could be reversed by the addition of phytosphingosine to the media (10Patton J.L. Srinivasan B. Dickson R.C. Lester R.L. J.

The current study examines the role of sphingolipids in the heat adaptation of yeast cells. First, the SLC strain 7R4 was transformed with the serine palmitoyltransferase gene to ensure that the observed heat-sensitive phenotype was due to the lack of sphingolipids and not to the secondary mutation. Next the specificity of sphingolipids that allowed for growth during heat stress was examined. Furthermore, the levels of sphingoid backbones, ceramides, and the inositol phosphoceramides (IPCs) were measured in response to heat stress. Our results show that endogenous sphingolipid levels change in response to a heat stress challenge and that sphingolipids are necessary for the heat stress response of yeast. Sphingosine, phytosphingosine, dihydrosphingosine, and fumonisin B1 were from Sigma.l-threo-Dihydrosphingosine, C2phytoceramide, C2 and C6 ceramides, and C2 and C6 dihydroceramides were synthesized as described previously (11Bielawska A.

Strain 1Δ4 is the URA disruption of the serine palmitoyltransferase gene (lcb1). Suppressors of the long chain base knockout (SLC's) used in this study were the 4R3 and 7R4 strains, and they were obtained from Dr. Robert Dickson (University of Kentucky) (7Wells G.B. Lester R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 10200-10203Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 8Dickson R.C. Wells G.B. Schmidt A. Lester R.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 2176-2181Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). The strain 7R4-LCB1 was created for this study as described below. The plasmid PLCB1–5 was a gift from Dr. Robert Dickson. The LCB1 gene in the plasmid was cut at its unique SmaI site at base 263 and EcoRI site at base 936 to obtain a 573-base pair fragment with which to transform the yeast strain 7R4. The transformation was done using the lithium acetate protocol (13Gietz R.D. Woods R.A. Molecular Genetics of Yeast: A Practical Approach. Oxford University Press, New York1994: 121-134Google Scholar). To select for the desired recombination event, the transformed yeast were plated on 5-fluoroorotic acid. Controls for transformation efficiency were streaked on leucine-deficient plates. Transformation results were confirmed by polymerase chain reaction. Yeast strains were streaked and then grown for 2 to 4 days at 37 °C. The plated strains were then photographed and manually scored for growth. Plates containing supplementary sphingolipids were made with or without detergent Nonidet P-40 used as a dispersant at a concentration of 0.05%. Yeast strains were seeded at 2 × 105 to 8 × 105 cells/ml and assayed for growth under the given conditions and treatments. At the selected time points, a 1-ml aliquot was taken out, and its optical density was measured at 600 nm. Yeast sphingolipids were extracted from liquid cultures via the method of Bligh and Dyer (14Bligh E.G. Dyer W.J. Can. J. Biochem. Physiol. 1959; 37: 911-917Crossref PubMed Scopus (42875) Google Scholar). The resultant lipids were resuspended and split into three thirds. One-third was for organic phosphates, which were used to normalize samples to each other. The other two-thirds were used for the measurement of sphingoid bases and ceramide measurements. The resultant lipid extract was analyzed after derivatization with ortho-phthaldialdehyde via HPLC with a Shimadzu fluorescent detector (15Merrill Jr., A.H. Wang E. Mullins R.E. Jamison W.C. Nimkar S. Liotta D.C. Anal. Biochem. 1988; 171: 373-381Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar). Samples were compared by use of the unnatural sphingoid basel-threo-dihydrosphingosine as an internal standard added before the Bligh and Dyer extraction. Lipid extracts were phosphorylated by Escherichia coli diacylglycerol kinase (16Preiss J.E. Loomis C.R. Bell R.M. Niedel J.E. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 141: 294-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). The phosphorylated compounds were then separated on a thin layer chromatography (TLC) plate and then exposed to film. For quantification, the plates were subsequently exposed to a phosphoimager screen. The screen was then scanned, and analysis of the resulting image was performed via Image Quant. Cells in liquid culture were labeled with tritiated inositol overnight and then treated as denoted. Yeast lipid extracts were prepared and run on TLC plates as described (17Mandala S.M. Thornton R.A. Frommer B.R. Curotto J.E. Rozdilsky W. Kurtz M.B. Giacobbe R.A. Bills G.F. Cabello M.A. Martin I. Pelaez F. Harris G.H. J. Antibiot. (Tokyo). 1995; 48: 349-356Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). The resultant TLC plates were exposed to film to obtain a permanent image. Quantification was done via Image Quant. An aliquot for the measurement of organic phosphate was taken before the lipids were run on TLC plates. The resultant phosphate value was used to normalize the values obtained via Image Quant. The suppressor of auxotrophy for long chain bases, 7R4, displays a heat-sensitive phenotype (see Fig.2). To ensure that this phenotype is not a result of the compensatory mutation in the strain 7R4, we reinserted the deleted LCB1 gene. A 573-base pair LCB1 gene fragment was generated from the plasmid PLCB1–5 by separate digestion with SmaI and EcoRI, and the fragment was used to transform cells via lithium acetate. Colonies were selected for growth on 5-fluoroorotic acid. This selection requires the yeast to have lost the URA gene disruption of the endogenous LCB1 through homologous recombination to grow. Thus, the selected strain should contain this SPT gene under its normal regulation. Eleven colonies from two transformations were identified. Seven of these were selected for further study. The seven selected transformants did not grow upon Ura− plates (data not shown), providing further evidence that the gene had been properly inserted and had essentially deleted the URA gene via recombination. Finally, polymerase chain reaction was done with two sets of primers, and the selected mutant 7R4 2B (7R4-LCB1) was found to have the expected products (data not shown). Strain 7R4-LCB1 was tested for its ability to grow at both 30 and 39 °C (Fig. 2). The 7R4 strain grew moderately at 30 °C and was not able to grow at all at 39 °C (Fig. 2). On the other hand, the 7R4-LCB1 strain grew as well as the wild-type SJ21R at both temperatures. At 30 °C, acquisition of sphingolipids by the strain via the reinsertion of this SPT gene under its normal control allowed for wild-type growth as compared with the slower growth of the 7R4 strain. These data indicate that indeed the slow growth of the 7R4 strain is due to its lacking of sphingolipids. Furthermore, the ability of 7R4-LCB1 to grow as well as the wild type at 39 °C demonstrates that the secondary mutations did not impart the heat-sensitive phenotype seen in the 7R4 strain. Therefore, these data prove that the lack of sphingolipids causes the heat stress-deficient phenotype seen in the SLC strain, and, thus, the presence of sphingolipids is required for the heat stress response. The necessity of sphingolipids for SLC growth at high temperature led to studies on the ability and specificity of various mammalian and yeast sphingolipids to allow for this growth. These studies were performed in solid and liquid media. The growth of the SLC strains was studied in liquid culture where a quantitative assessment of the ability of sphingolipids to increase growth was obtained. The heat-sensitive phenotype of the SLC strains 7R4 and 4R3 was overcome by both phytosphingosine and dihydrosphingosine (Figs. 3 and 4). The growth of the SLC strain 7R4 was most potently increased by 1 μm dihydrosphingosine. However, 1 and 5 μm phytosphingosine also allowed for heat-stressed growth of the 7R4 strain (Fig.3). In the SLC strain 4R3, 1 and 5 μm phytosphingosine were more effective than 1 μm dihydrosphingosine in allowing for heat-stressed growth of the SLC strain 4R3 (Fig. 4). The heat-sensitive phenotype of the SLC strain 7R4 was not reversed by the addition of 1 or 5 μmd-erythro-sphingosine or C2phytoceramide (data not shown). Furthermore,d-e-sphingosine could not rescue the SLC strain 4R3. Therefore, the rescue of the SLC strains from their heat-sensitive phenotype was accomplished only by the two endogenous yeast sphingoid backbones phytosphingosine and dihydrosphingosine.Figure 4Effects of phytosphingosine and dihydrosphingosine on growth at 39 °C of the SLC strain 4R3.Phytosphingosine (psph) (A) or dihydrosphingosine (dhsph) (B) were added a half hour before the zero time point of heat stress (39 °C) at the given final concentrations. Growth was assayed by absorbance at 600 nm of a 1-ml aliquot for the indicated time points. Each point is the average of two separate measurements shown with their standard deviation.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The growth studies on plates supported the findings of those found in the liquid studies. The plate growth data at 37 °C showed that phytosphingosine was the most potent long chain base in allowing for growth with heat stress (data not shown). However, the other endogenous sphingoid backbone, d-erythro-dihydrosphingosine also allowed for SLC growth at 37 °C. In addition C2phytoceramide, d-e-sphingosine, C2and C6 ceramide along with C2 and C6 dihydroceramide did not show an ability to overcome the heat-sensitive phenotype of the 7R4 and 4R3 SLC strains (data not shown). Overall, the plate and liquid studies showed that only yeast endogenous sphingoid backbones allowed for growth at heat-stressed temperatures. The necessity of sphingolipids in the heat stress response and the ability of the endogenous sphingoid backbones to allow for growth at high temperature prompted us to examine the levels of endogenous sphingolipids in the wild-type cells upon heat stress. Each of the three major classes of sphingolipids was measured over a given time course of heat stress. The first class of sphingolipids measured in S. cerevisiaewere the inositol phosphoceramides. Liquid cultures were labeled overnight with tritiated inositol. Lipids from heat-stressed and nonheat-stressed cells were extracted by a previously described method (17Mandala S.M. Thornton R.A. Frommer B.R. Curotto J.E. Rozdilsky W. Kurtz M.B. Giacobbe R.A. Bills G.F. Cabello M.A. Martin I. Pelaez F. Harris G.H. J. Antibiot. (Tokyo). 1995; 48: 349-356Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar), and the resultant extracts were developed on TLC plates (Fig.5 A). Over a 1.5-h time course of heat stress, these data showed no significant changes in IPC, mannose IPC, and mannose (inositol phosphate)2 ceramide bands (Fig. 5 B). Furthermore, no changes were seen in phosphatidylinositol and lysophosphatidylinositol (data not shown). The second class of sphingolipids measured were the sphingoid backbones (long chain amino bases). The sphingoid backbones from liquid cultures were first extracted under Bligh and Dyer conditions. The organic phase was dried down and resuspended, and an aliquot was taken to measure the organic phosphate level that was used to normalize measurements of sphingolipids. The remaining extract was put through a mild base hydrolysis and reextracted. The resultant lipids were derivatized with ortho-phthaldialdehyde and separated via high performance liquid chromatography using a C18 reverse phase column. The extraction efficiency of each sample was evaluated by the use of a nonendogenous sphingoid backbone, l-threo-dihydrosphingosine, added prior to the initial Bligh and Dyer extraction. Four peaks on the HPLC charts were identified as sphingoid bases. Four criteria were met in order for these peaks to be identified as such. The first was the resistance to mild base hydrolysis. Second, they contained a free amine that was derivatized. The free amine is present in the sphingoid bases and not the other sphingolipids, because this is the attachment site of the fatty acid. Third, these four peaks were not detected in the SLC strain 7R4, which lacks sphingolipids (Fig.6 A). Finally, the two peaks that comigrated with known standards of C18phytosphingosine and C18d-erythro-dihydrosphingosine were identified as such, whereas the remaining two peaks were designated C20phytosphingosine and C20 dihydrosphingosine due to their longer retention times. Each time point measured was compared with a time-matched nonheat-stressed control (Fig. 6 C). Within 15 min of heat stress at 39 °C there was a large induction of the sphingoid backbones (Fig. 6 B). At the 15-min time point, C18 phytosphingosine increased 1.4-fold, whereas C18d-erythro-dihydrosphingosine had increased 2.2-fold over the time matched controls (Fig. 6 D). The largest increases were seen in the C20 phytosphingosine and C20 dihydrosphingosine species. C20phytosphingosine increased 6.4-fold over baseline (Fig. 6, C and D). Also, at 15 min C20 dihydrosphingosine increased 10.8-fold over its time-matched control (Fig. 6 D). These increases were transient in that the levels decreased to near baseline by 1 h (Fig. 6 D). The 7R4-LCB1 line showed this phenomena, as did another wild-type yeast line W303 (data not shown). Overall, the sphingoid backbones showed large and transient increases with heat stress in several yeast lines. The third class of sphingolipids measured were the yeast ceramides. The lipids from liquid cultures were extracted by the method of Bligh and Dyer. After resuspension, an aliquot was taken for organic phosphate measurement. The remaining lipids were phosphorylated by E. coli diacylglycerol kinase and ran out on TLC plates. We found two bands of ceramide phosphates via TLC separation. These two bands were identified as ceramides due to their absence in the SLC lines and resistance to mild alkaline hydrolysis (data not shown). The ceramides increased following 60 min (Fig. 7) of heat stress and continued to be elevated until at least 2 h of heat stress (Fig. 8 A). As shown, ceramide 1 increased by 9.2-fold (Fig. 7 B), and the ceramide 2 increased by 10.6-fold (Fig. 7 C). A smaller increase of 2.7-fold in diacylglycerol was also seen after an hour of heat stress at 39 °C (data not shown). The increase seen in the ceramides was partially inhibited by a 2-h preincubation period with 150 μm fumonisin B1 (Fig. 8, A and B). Fumonisin B1 has been shown to inhibit the ceramide synthase in yeast (see Fig. 1) (18Wu W.I. McDonough V.M. Nickels Jr., J.T. Ko J. Fischl A.S. Vales T.R. Merrill Jr., A.H. Carman G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 13171-13178Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Therefore, these data indicate that the increased ceramide derives at least partially from the conversion of sphingoid backbones to ceramides.Figure 8Effect of fumonisin B1 on heat stress-induced increase of ceramides. Extracted lipids (see Ref. 14Bligh E.G. Dyer W.J. Can. J. Biochem. Physiol. 1959; 37: 911-917Crossref PubMed Scopus (42875) Google Scholar) were phosphorylated by diacylglycerol kinase and run out on thin layer chromatography plates.

Each measurement is the average of duplicates displayed with their standard deviation.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The above data show that the sphingoid backbone species undergo a large and transient increase upon heat stress. Also, ceramides show a large increase with later kinetics and appear sustained for at least 1 h. This increase occurred after the return of the sphingoid backbones to basal levels. Furthermore, the results with fumonisin B1 indicate a conversion of the sphingoid backbones to ceramides in the heat stress response. The question of the need for sphingolipids in the heat stress response has arisen due to the isolation of suppressor mutations of the knockout of serine palmitoyltransferase in yeast (7Wells G.B. Lester R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 10200-10203Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These SLC mutants are unable to grow under many states of cellular stress including increased ambient temperature, unless the media they grow upon is supplemented with phytosphingosine (10Patton J.L. Srinivasan B. Dickson R.C. Lester R.L. J. Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 7180-7184Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Therefore, we set out to determine whether the observed phenotype of heat sensitivity is due to a lack of sphingolipids or due to the secondary suppressor mutations. As shown, the 7R4-LCB1 strain with a reinserted serine palmitoyltransferase gene (LCB1) is not heat sensitive. Thus the heat sensitivity did not arise from the aforementioned suppressor mutations. Therefore, we conclude that sphingolipids are necessary for the yeast heat stress response. The measurement of sphingolipids in heat-stressed wild-type yeast showed dramatic increases in two classes of sphingolipids. Within 15 min of heat stress all four species of sphingoid backbones increased with the C20 phytosphingosine and C20dihydrosphingosine each showing over 6-fold increases. Furthermore, the increases seen were transient, and levels returned to baseline by 1 h. Yeast ceramides also increased but not until 1 h of heat stress and remained elevated for at least an additional hour. The increases seen in the ceramides were partially inhibited by fumonisin B1, indicating that at least part of the increase was from the conversion of yeast sphingoid backbones to ceramide via ceramide synthase. Furthermore, the increase in ceramides could be inhibited nearly completely by Australifungin, a potent and specific inhibitor of ceramide synthase. 2R. Dickson, personal communication. Moreover, for up to 1.5 h of heat stress, the IPCs did not significantly change. Taken together these data suggest enhanced de novosynthesis of these compounds, which could be the source of the increased sphingoid bases and subsequently the increased ceramides. One can speculate on the role of sphingolipids in the heat stress response. There are two prominent possibilities. The first possibility is that the role played by sphingolipids is of a structural nature. This possibility is based upon the observation that membrane IPC's comprise about 30% of the phospholipid content of plasma membrane in yeast (19Patton J.L. Lester R.L. J. Bacteriol. 1991; 173: 3101-3108Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, the reason that SLC strains may acquire sensitivity to heat could be due to the lack of these sphingolipids in the membranes. One piece of evidence that indicates that this might not be the case is provided by the novel inositol glycerolipids. These compounds are very similar to the IPCs in structure and are hypothesized to fulfill their structural functions. This idea is supported by the data that the SLC strains will grow at normal temperatures, whereas the serine palmitoyltransferase knockout will not. However, the novel inositol glycerolipids may not totally mimic the function of wild-type sphingolipids. The second hypothesis suggests that the sphingolipids play a more regulatory role that goes beyond their structural role. This is supported by the observed changes in sphingolipid levels following heat stress. These results raise the possibility that yeast sphingolipids react to heat stress and may participate in the adaptive responses, possibly as second messengers or signal transducers. Such a role has been proposed in mammalian systems where sphingolipids have been found to participate in senescence (20Venable M.E. Lee J.Y. Smyth M.J. Bielawska A. Obeid L.M. J. Biol.

Science. 1993; 259: 1769-1771Crossref PubMed Scopus (1612) Google Scholar), and cellular stress responses (24Hannun Y.A. Science. 1996; 274: 1855-1859Crossref PubMed Scopus (1497) Google Scholar). In addition mammalian cells have been shown to display an increase in ceramide in response to heat stress and that ceramide induces the expression of at least one heat shock protein, α B crystallin (25Chang Y. Abe A. Shayman J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 12275-12279Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). In light of these roles in mammalian systems one can easily theorize that yeast sphingolipids may play a similar role in the yeast heat stress response. The results from the growth studies show that only endogenous yeast sphingoid backbones are able to rescue the SLC cells from their inability to grow in an increased ambient temperature. These data indicate a possible importance for the sphingoid backbones in the yeast heat stress response. In light of this idea one can speculate that the yeast sphingoid backbones, which show major increases upon heat stress, are important in a signaling role of this stress response. Second, the increase in ceramides may also play a role. Indeed, these biphasic changes in yeast sphingolipids may reflect the complex physiology of the yeast heat stress response, which may be considered as a biphasic physiology. First the yeast tries to survive the new temperature. Once this is accomplished the yeast may then regain its ability to grow. Questions such as what are the roles of sphingoid backbones and ceramides in the yeast heat stress response should be addressed. Also, one would like to delineate the necessity of either or both of the above sphingolipids in the gaining of thermotolerance and regrowth phases of heat stress. Finally, if there is indeed a signaling role for sphingolipids in the heat stress response, the study of where and how these molecules affect the heat stress response should be quite interesting."
https://openalex.org/W2054865582,"To characterize at the molecular level the pancreatic emergency program set up by the pancreatic cells in response to pancreatitis, we have developed a strategy in which the phenotype of the pancreatitis affected pancreas is established by characterization of a large number of its transcripts. Herein, we describe the cloning, sequence, and expression of a new gene, named p8, which is strongly activated in pancreatic acinar cells during the acute phase of pancreatitis, in developing pancreas and during pancreatic regeneration. In acinar cells, p8 mRNA is expressed rapidly and specifically in response to cellular pancreatitis-induced injury; its induction occurred almost similarly in edematous and necrohemorrhagic pancreatitis, indicating that p8 mRNA is maximally activated even in response to a mild pancreatic injury. Furthermore, <i>in vitro</i> studies suggest that p8 mRNA is induced in pancreatic and non-pancreatic cells in response to some apoptotic stimuli. p8 acts as a promoter of cellular growth factor when its cDNA is transfected into COS-7 and AR4-2J cells. Although we failed to identify p8-related sequences, analysis of its primary and secondary structure suggests that p8 is a basic helix-turn-helix-containing gene with slight homology to several homeotic genes and sufficient signal to be targeted to the nucleus.

Here, we investigated the potential utility of a mini-gene expressing the clathrin-binding domain of β-arrestin (β-arrestin (319–418)) to function as a dominant-negative with respect to β2AR internalization and compared its properties with those of β-arrestin and β-arrestin-V53D, a previously reported dominant-negative mutant.In vitro studies demonstrated that β-arrestin-V53D bound better to clathrin than β-arrestin but was significantly impaired in its interaction with phosphorylated G protein-coupled receptors. In contrast, whereas β-arrestin (319–418) also bound well to clathrin it completely lacked receptor binding activity. When coexpressed with the β2AR in HEK293 cells, β-arrestin (319–418) effectively inhibited agonist-promoted receptor internalization, whereas β-arrestin-V53D was only modestly effective. However, both constructs significantly inhibited the stimulation of β2AR internalization by β-arrestin in COS-1 cells. Interestingly, immunofluorescence microscopy analysis reveals that both β-arrestin (319–418) and β-arrestin-V53D are constitutively localized in clathrin-coated pits in COS-1 cells. These results indicate the potential usefulness of β-arrestin (319–418) to effectively block arrestin-clathrin interaction in cells and suggest that this construct may prove useful in further defining the mechanisms involved in G protein-coupled receptor trafficking.

This process, which uncouples GPR-G protein interactions, often involves phosphorylation of the GPR by a G protein-coupled receptor kinase (GRK), ultimately leading to high affinity arrestin binding (1Sterne-Marr R. Benovic J.L. Vitam. Horm. 1995; 51: 193-235Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). It is the latter step that sterically inhibits G protein binding to the agonist-activated GPR (2Kuhn H.

There are currently four known mammalian arrestins: two visual arrestins, arrestin and cone arrestin (4Shinohara T. Dietzschold B. Craft C.M. Wistow G. Early J.J. Donoso L.A. Horwitz J. Tao R. Proc.

In contrast, the ubiquitous expression of β-arrestin and arrestin3 (6Lohse M.J. Benovic J.L. Caron M.G. Lefkowitz R.J.

Indeed, intact cell studies have demonstrated a role for the nonvisual arrestins in regulation of the β2-adrenergic (11Pippig S. Andexinger S. Daniel K. Puzicha M. Caron M.G. Lefkowitz R.J.

Another level of regulation of GPRs is their internalization or sequestration following agonist exposure. Agonist-induced internalization of GPRs occurs subsequent to the rapid agonist-induced desensitization mediated by GRKs and arrestins. Recent studies have directly demonstrated a role for GRKs in mediating internalization of GPRs. Coexpression of GRK2 with either the m2 muscarinic acetylcholine receptor (m2AChR) or a sequestration-defective β2AR (β2AR-Y326A) resulted in enhanced internalization of these receptors, whereas coexpression with dominant-negative GRK2 attenuated receptor internalization (15Tsuga H. Kameyama K. Haga T. Kurose H. Nagao T. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 32522-32527Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 16Ferguson S.S.G. Menard L. Barak L.S. Koch W.J. Colapietro A.-M. Caron M.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 24782-24789Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). It is evident that GRKs mediate the enhanced internalization of GPRs through arrestins. Coexpression of β-arrestin or arrestin3 with β2AR-Y326A rescued the sequestration-defective phenotype of this mutant (17Ferguson S.S.G. Downey III, W.E. Colapietro A.-M. Barak L.S. Menard L. Caron M.G. Science. 1996; 271: 363-365Crossref PubMed Scopus (846) Google Scholar). Moreover, coexpression of mutant forms of β-arrestin or arrestin3 (containing a single Val to Asp mutation in the far N terminus) with the β2AR inhibited internalization, whereas coexpression of these mutants with GRK2 and β2AR-Y326A prevented GRK2-promoted receptor sequestration (17Ferguson S.S.G. Downey III, W.E. Colapietro A.-M. Barak L.S. Menard L. Caron M.G. Science. 1996; 271: 363-365Crossref PubMed Scopus (846) Google Scholar). We recently described a potential molecular mechanism of nonvisual arrestin-promoted GPR internalization (18Goodman Jr., O.B. Krupnick J.G. Santini F. Gurevich V.V. Penn R.B. Gagnon A.W. Keen J.H. Benovic J.L. Nature. 1996; 383: 447-450Crossref PubMed Scopus (1170) Google Scholar). We observed that β-arrestin and arrestin3 but not visual arrestin interact specifically, stoichiometrically, and with high affinity with clathrin, the major protein component of coated pits. Importantly, the in vitro interaction between β-arrestin and clathrin was substantiated by the immunofluorescence colocalization of β-arrestin, clathrin, and surface β2AR following agonist activation in intact cells. Thus, by virtue of its ability to bind to both the receptor and clathrin, β-arrestin uncouples the β2AR from G protein and then targets it for internalization through clathrin-coated pits. We further demonstrated that the predominant clathrin-binding domain in nonvisual arrestins is localized to a domain (amino acids 367–385 in arrestin3) that contains several hydrophobic and acidic residues critical for clathrin binding (19Krupnick J.G. Goodman Jr., O.B. Keen J.H. Benovic J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 15011-15016Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar) and that the clathrin terminal domain contains a complementary sequence that is involved in arrestin binding (20Goodman Jr., O.B.

In light of these findings it is interesting that nonvisual arrestins containing a single mutation in their N terminus apparently function as dominant-negative proteins with respect to β2AR sequestration (17Ferguson S.S.G. Downey III, W.E. Colapietro A.-M. Barak L.S. Menard L. Caron M.G. Science. 1996; 271: 363-365Crossref PubMed Scopus (846) Google Scholar). In this report, we biochemically characterize the Val to Asp mutant of β-arrestin (β-arrestin-V53D) as well as a β-arrestin clathrin-binding domain construct (β-arrestin (319–418)) and assess the potential utility of these proteins to disrupt β2AR internalization. [3H]Leucine and [γ-32P]ATP were purchased from NEN Life Science Products. All restriction enzymes were purchased from Boehringer Mannheim. Sepharose 2B and all other chemicals were purchased from Sigma. Rabbit reticulocyte lysate was purchased from Promega. SP6 polymerase was prepared as described previously (21Jackson R.J. Hunt T. Methods Enz. 1983; 96: 50-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (396) Google Scholar). Reagents were generously provided by Drs. S. Schmid and H. Damke (dynamin-K44A), V. Gurevich (purified bovine β-arrestin-V53D), M. Hosey (purified m2AChR), S. Ferguson and M. Caron (rat β-arrestin-V53D), B. Kobilka (Flag-tagged β2AR), P. Goldsmith and A. Spiegel (β-arrestin antibodies), and R. K. Crouch (11-cis-retinal). β-Arrestin-V53D was generated by amplifying a ∼206-base pair fragment of bovine β-arrestin by polymerase chain reaction using a sense primer containing a single mutation (underlined) (5′-cttgtggatccggagtatctcaaggagaggagagactatg-3′) and an antisense primer (5′-ggtaggcatgctcgcccagcttat-3′). The resulting product was digested with BamHI and SphI and then ligated into BamHI/SphI digested SP6-modified pBluescript KS containing β-arrestin. β-Arrestin and β-arrestin-V53D cDNAs were then excised with NotI and HindIII, blunted with Klenow, and ligated into pcDNA3 (Invitrogen) that was digested with EcoRV and treated with phosphatase. Orientation was confirmed by restriction analysis. β-Arrestin (319–418) was generated by polymerase chain reaction amplification of bovine β-arrestin using sense (5′-caataagcttaccatggtttcctacaaagtgaaagtg-3′) and antisense (5′-agatggatccctatctgtcgttgagccg-3′) primers. The sense primer contained a Kozak consensus sequence for initiation (underlined) preceding residue 319 in β-arrestin. The resulting product was digested with HindIII and BamHI, purified, and then ligated into HindIII/BamHI-digested pcDNA3. In all of these studies we used the 418-amino acid-long variant of β-arrestin (10Sterne-Marr R. Gurevich V.V. Goldsmith P. Bodine R.C. Sanders C. Donoso L.A. Benovic J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 15640-15648Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). All sequences were confirmed by DNA sequencing (Sidney Kimmel Nucleic Acid Facility, Thomas Jefferson University). Flag-tagged β2AR in pcDNA3 was generated by digesting pBC-Flagβ2AR with SalI followed by Klenow to blunt the 3′ end. The insert was excised with HindIII and the ∼2-kilobase fragment was ligated into HindIII/EcoRV-digested pcDNA3. Dynamin-K44A (clone pUHD10–3) was excised by BamHI digestion, purified, and then ligated into BamHI-digested and phosphatase-treated pcDNA3. cDNAs were linearized with HindIII or EcoRV (β-arrestin (319–418)) and purified on a 1% agarose gel. In vitro transcription and translation were performed as described previously (22Gurevich V.V. Benovic J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 21919-21923Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The specific activities and concentrations of in vitro translated proteins were calculated to be ∼500–1700 dpm/fmol and ∼10–55 nm, respectively. The preparation of clathrin and clathrin cages (23Keen J.H. Willingham M.C. Pastan I. Cell. 1979; 16: 303-312Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar) and the cage binding assay (18Goodman Jr., O.B. Krupnick J.G. Santini F. Gurevich V.V. Penn R.B. Gagnon A.W. Keen J.H. Benovic J.L. Nature. 1996; 383: 447-450Crossref PubMed Scopus (1170) Google Scholar) have been previously described. Briefly, in vitrotranslated radiolabeled arrestins (0.5 nm) were incubated with or without clathrin cages for 30 min at 22 °C in a total volume of 50 μl in 100 mm Na-MES, pH 6.8, 1 mmdithiothreitol, and 1 μg/ml each of leupeptin, pepstatin, and antipain. Samples were cooled on ice, loaded onto a 75-μl 0.2m sucrose cushion in 100 mm Na-MES, pH 6.8, and centrifuged for 5 min at 100,000 rpm at 4 °C in a TLA100.1 rotor. Pellets were resuspended in 20 μl of SDS sample buffer, heated at 100 °C for 5 min, and electrophoresed on 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gels. Gels were stained with Coomassie Blue, destained, enhanced with 20% 2,5-diphenyloxazole in glacial acetic acid, dried, and autoradiographed. Quantitation was carried out by PhosphorImager analysis (Molecular Dynamics). Specific binding was determined by comparing the intensity of bands in the experimental samples to the intensity of standards loaded on the same gel. Nonspecific sedimentation (∼4, ∼8, and ∼5–10% of total input for β-arrestin, β-arrestin-V53D, and β-arrestin (319–418), respectively) was assessed in the absence of clathrin cages and subtracted from all experimental values. Urea-treated rod outer segment membranes were prepared, phosphorylated with GRK2 to a stoichiometry of ∼2.7 mol/mol, and regenerated with 11-cis-retinal as described (24Gurevich V.V. Benovic J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 11628-11638Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Arrestin binding to phosphorylated agonist-activated receptors was carried out as described (9Gurevich V.V. Dion S.B. Onorato J.J. Ptasienski J. Kim C.M. Sterne-Marr R. Hosey M.M. Benovic J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 720-731Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (339) Google Scholar). Briefly, in vitro translated radiolabeled arrestins (0.5 nm) were incubated for 5 min at 37 °C with phosphorylated rhodopsin or m2AChR in a total volume of 50 μl in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.5 mmMgCl2, 100 mm potassium acetate, 1.5 mm dithiothreitol. Samples were then placed on ice, and receptor-bound arrestins were separated from unbound arrestins by Sepharose 2B column chromatography. Nonspecific binding was assessed in the absence of receptor (∼1.0, ∼0.7, and ∼1.6 fmol for β-arrestin, β-arrestin-V53D, and β-arrestin (319–418), respectively). HEK293 and COS-1 cells were grown in T75 flasks at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere containing 5% CO2 in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin (complete medium). The cells were grown to ∼80–90% confluence and then transfected with the various constructs using LipofectAMINE according to the manufacturer's instructions (Life Technologies, Inc.). Briefly, DNAs were incubated with 95 (HEK293 cells) or 65 (COS-1 cells) μl of LipofectAMINE in 5 ml of DMEM for 30 min at 22 °C. 5 ml of DMEM was then combined with the DNA/LipofectAMINE and added to a T75 flask of DMEM-rinsed cells. After 5 h at 37 °C, the DNA-containing medium was replaced with complete medium. Transfected cells were harvested by trypsinization ∼48 h after transfection, washed twice with cold PBS and resuspended in 1.5 ml of cold PBS containing 0.1 mm ascorbic acid. Cells (0.5 ml) were incubated with or without 10 μm (−)-isoproterenol at 37 °C for various times, washed twice with 50 ml of cold PBS, and resuspended in 1.5 ml of cold PBS. Cell surface receptors were measured directly by incubation with ∼10 nm[3H]CGP-12177 (Amersham) for 3 h at 14 °C with nonspecific binding assessed in the presence of 10 μm(−)-alprenolol. Bound ligands were separated on a Brandel cell harvester. To assess expression of the various β-arrestin constructs, 0.1 ml of the resuspended cells were pelleted by centrifugation, resuspended in 0.2 ml of cold lysis buffer (20 mm Hepes, pH 7.2, 10 mm EDTA, 0.2 m NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 0.1 mg/ml benzamidine, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride), and then lysed by freeze/thaw and vortexing. Following centrifugation, supernatant protein was electrophoresed on a 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel, transferred to nitrocellulose, and then immunoblotted using a 1:2000 dilution of a β-arrestin-specific rabbit polyclonal antibody as described previously (19Krupnick J.G. Goodman Jr., O.B. Keen J.H. Benovic J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 15011-15016Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar). The blots were washed, incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody, and then visualized by chemiluminescence using ECL (Amersham). Protein concentrations were determined by Bio-Rad assay using bovine serum albumin as a standard. Cells were processed for immunofluorescence analysis as described previously (25Santini F. Keen J.H. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 132: 1025-1036Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Cell stimulation was performed by incubating the cells in Hepes-DMEM containing 10 μm (−)-isoproterenol for 10 min at 37 °C. Following fixation and permeabilization, clathrin was detected using either rabbit polyclonal antiserum 27004 (1:100 dilution) (26Keen J.H. Willingham M.C. Pastan I.J. Cell Biol. 1981; 256: 2538-2544Google Scholar) or mouse monoclonal antibody X22 (20 μg/ml), and β-arrestin was detected using a rabbit affinity-purified antibody raised against a C-terminal 16-amino acid peptide (1:250 dilution) (10Sterne-Marr R. Gurevich V.V. Goldsmith P. Bodine R.C. Sanders C. Donoso L.A. Benovic J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 15640-15648Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Primary antisera were detected with either fluorescein-conjugated or rhodamine-lissamine-conjugated donkey anti-rabbit IgG or donkey anti-mouse IgG secondary antibodies (each 1:100 dilutions), preadsorbed to minimize interspecies cross-reactivity (Jackson Immuno Research). Confocal microscopy was performed on a Bio-Rad MRC-600 laser scanning confocal microscope (Hemmelholsteadt) attached to a Zeiss Axiovert 100 microscope using a Zeiss Plan-Apo 63 × 1.40 NA oil immersion lens. Cells expressing the lowest levels of transfected proteins but clearly above those of nonexpressing counterparts in the same specimens were chosen for view. Images of each fluorescent signal were collected sequentially in the photon counting mode using single line excitation. Recent evidence has indicated that nonvisual arrestins function as clathrin adaptor proteins (18Goodman Jr., O.B. Krupnick J.G. Santini F. Gurevich V.V. Penn R.B. Gagnon A.W. Keen J.H. Benovic J.L. Nature. 1996; 383: 447-450Crossref PubMed Scopus (1170) Google Scholar), a function that explains their ability to promote GPR internalization (17Ferguson S.S.G. Downey III, W.E. Colapietro A.-M. Barak L.S. Menard L. Caron M.G. Science. 1996; 271: 363-365Crossref PubMed Scopus (846) Google Scholar, 18Goodman Jr., O.B. Krupnick J.G. Santini F. Gurevich V.V. Penn R.B. Gagnon A.W. Keen J.H. Benovic J.L. Nature. 1996; 383: 447-450Crossref PubMed Scopus (1170) Google Scholar). Further evidence that nonvisual arrestins are directly involved in GPR internalization comes from the functional characterization of mutant forms of these proteins (β-arrestin-V53D and arrestin3-V54D). These mutants were reported to significantly inhibit the sequestration of coexpressed wild-type β2AR and to block the ability of GRK2 to rescue the sequestration-defective phenotype of a mutant β2AR containing a Y326A mutation (17Ferguson S.S.G. Downey III, W.E. Colapietro A.-M. Barak L.S. Menard L. Caron M.G. Science. 1996; 271: 363-365Crossref PubMed Scopus (846) Google Scholar). Thus, these mutants were referred to as “dominant-negative” proteins with respect to inhibiting GPR internalization. To shed light on the ability of β-arrestin-V53D to function as a dominant-negative mutant, we measured its binding to both clathrin and GPRs because altered interaction with either component might contribute to its functional phenotype. In vitro translated β-arrestin-V53D and β-arrestin were incubated with increasing concentrations of clathrin cages, and following sedimentation, bound arrestins were determined by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, autoradiography, and densitometry analysis. As demonstrated in Fig.1 A, β-arrestin-V53D is not defective in clathrin binding and, in fact, appears to bind better to clathrin than β-arrestin. Moreover, under conditions in which β-arrestin dissociates significantly (>50%) from clathrin, we observe minimal (<10%) β-arrestin-V53D dissociation from clathrin (data not shown). Furthermore, purified recombinant β-arrestin-V53D expressed in Escherichia coli binds to clathrin cages with high affinity (data not shown). The lack of a detrimental effect on clathrin binding is consistent with the mutation site in β-arrestin-V53D being located in a region not directly involved in clathrin binding (19Krupnick J.G. Goodman Jr., O.B. Keen J.H. Benovic J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 15011-15016Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar). The apparent ability of β-arrestin-V53D to interact better with clathrin than β-arrestin may be explained in light of the proposed role of the far N terminus of arrestins in interacting with the far C terminus to regulate the overall conformation of arrestins (9Gurevich V.V. Dion S.B. Onorato J.J. Ptasienski J. Kim C.M. Sterne-Marr R. Hosey M.M. Benovic J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 720-731Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (339) Google Scholar, 24Gurevich V.V. Benovic J.L. J. Biol.

Chem. 1994; 269: 8721-8727Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It is conceivable that this mutation alters this interaction, thus rendering the far C terminus containing the clathrin-binding domain more accessible. A possible conformational change in β-arrestin-V53D, however, is likely to be modest since trypsin proteolysis patterns of β-arrestin and β-arrestin-V53D were very similar (data not shown). We next assessed the GPR binding properties of β-arrestin-V53D. Incubation of in vitro translated radiolabeled β-arrestin and β-arrestin-V53D with phosphorylated rod outer segment membranes demonstrates that β-arrestin-V53D is impaired in interacting with phosphorylated light-activated rhodopsin (Fig. 1 B). Moreover, β-arrestin-V53D binding to phosphorylated agonist-activated m2AChR was also significantly impaired (data not shown). The defect in GPR binding of β-arrestin-V53D is consistent with the site of the mutation being located close to the primary GPR-binding regions in arrestins (8Gurevich V.V. Richardson R.M. Kim C.M.

Thus, it seems that this mutation either directly or indirectly interferes with the primary GPR-binding domains in β-arrestin. The ability of β-arrestin-V53D to interact well with clathrin together with its decreased ability to interact with phosphorylated agonist-activated GPRs suggest that this mutant would be defective in promoting GPR internalization and may function as a dominant-negative protein as previously reported (17Ferguson S.S.G. Downey III, W.E. Colapietro A.-M. Barak L.S. Menard L. Caron M.G. Science. 1996; 271: 363-365Crossref PubMed Scopus (846) Google Scholar). However, we reasoned that a construct that expresses only the clathrin-binding determinants of β-arrestin (i.e. no receptor-binding determinants) might function as a more effective dominant-negative for inhibiting arrestin-promoted receptor internalization. Given our localization of the clathrin-binding domain in nonvisual arrestins to the far C terminus (18Goodman Jr., O.B. Krupnick J.G. Santini F. Gurevich V.V. Penn R.B. Gagnon A.W. Keen J.H.

Chem. 1993; 268: 11628-11638Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), we devised a construct expressing the C-terminal 100 amino acids of β-arrestin (β-arrestin (319–418)). In vitro translated β-arrestin (319–418) binds specifically to clathrin cages, although its extent of binding appears modestly reduced (Fig.2 A). However, the decreased extent of binding of β-arrestin (319–418) to clathrin compared with β-arrestin is likely due to differences in the relative stability of the in vitro translated proteins because a GST fusion protein containing the C-terminal 100 amino acids of β-arrestin bound to clathrin cages with a comparable affinity and extent as β-arrestin (data not shown). Importantly, β-arrestin (319–418) demonstrates no significant binding to phosphorylated light-activated rhodopsin (Fig.2 B). Moreover, GST-β-arrestin (319–418) and a corresponding construct of arrestin3 (GST-arrestin3 (318–409)), which was shown to interact very well with clathrin (19Krupnick J.G. Goodman Jr., O.B. Keen J.H. Benovic J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 15011-15016Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar), also did not interact with phosphorylated light-activated rhodopsin (data not shown). We next assessed the ability of β-arrestin-V53D and β-arrestin (319–418) to inhibit agonist-induced GPR internalization. HEK293 cells were initially chosen because they demonstrate a high level of agonist-induced β2AR internalization mediated by endogenous arrestins (17Ferguson S.S.G. Downey III, W.E. Colapietro A.-M. Barak L.S. Menard L. Caron M.G. Science. 1996; 271: 363-365Crossref PubMed Scopus (846) Google Scholar). HEK293 cells were transfected with β2AR alone or together with different β-arrestin constructs or with a dynamin dominant-negative mutant (dynamin-K44A) that is an effective inhibitor of clathrin-mediated endocytosis (28van der Bliek A.M. Redelmeier T.E. Damke H. Tisdale E.J. Meyerowitz E.M. Schmid S.L. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 122: 553-563Crossref PubMed Scopus (589) Google Scholar). β-Arrestin, β-arrestin-V53D, and β-arrestin (319–418) were all expressed at ∼20–35-fold above endogenous nonvisual arrestin levels (Fig. 3 A). We next measured the effect of these proteins on cell surface receptor loss induced by 15 min of treatment with isoproterenol. Although β-arrestin-V53D demonstrates a modest effect on β2AR internalization, β-arrestin (319–418) inhibits β2AR internalization almost as well as dynamin-K44A (Fig. 3 B). In addition, rat β-arrestin-V53D and bovine arrestin3-V54D were also ineffective dominant-negative proteins when expressed in HEK293 cells (data not shown). These findings demonstrate that β-arrestin (319–418) is a more effective inhibitor of β2AR internalization than β-arrestin-V53D. Interestingly, immunofluorescence analyses of transfected HEK293 cells demonstrated that β-arrestin (319–418) is localized in clathrin-coated pits in the absence of agonist, whereas β-arrestin-V53D is diffusely distributed (data not shown), indicating that the ability of β-arrestin (319–418) to inhibit β2AR internalization may lie in its apparent effectiveness in blocking endogenous clathrin-binding sites. Moreover, the inability of β-arrestin to stimulate β2AR internalization in HEK293 cells (Fig. 3 B and Ref. 17Ferguson S.S.G. Downey III, W.E. Colapietro A.-M. Barak L.S. Menard L. Caron M.G. Science. 1996; 271: 363-365Crossref PubMed Scopus (846) Google Scholar), despite significant overexpression (Fig. 3 A), is consistent with the apparent inability of β-arrestin to colocalize with clathrin-coated pits in an agonist-dependent fashion in HEK293 cells (data not shown), in contrast to the dramatic agonist-dependent colocalization of β-arrestin with clathrin-coated pits observed in COS-1 cells (18Goodman Jr., O.B. Krupnick J.G. Santini F. Gurevich V.V. Penn R.B. Gagnon A.W. Keen J.H. Benovic J.L. Nature. 1996; 383: 447-450Crossref PubMed Scopus (1170) Google Scholar). We next investigated the ability of β-arrestin-V53D and β-arrestin (319–418) to modulate receptor internalization in COS-1 cells. COS-1 cells demonstrate a lower level of agonist-induced GPR internalization in the absence of arrestin or GRK coexpression than HEK293 (29Menard L. Ferguson S.S.G. Barak L.S. Bertrand L. Premont R.T. Colapietro A.-M. Lefkowitz R.J. Caron M.G. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 4155-4160Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Thus, we assessed the effect of β-arrestin-V53D and β-arrestin (319–418) expression on β-arrestin-promoted β2AR internalization in these cells. Coexpression of the β2AR with β-arrestin results in a significant enhancement of β2AR internalization, whereas coexpression with β-arrestin (319–418) has no effect on the basal agonist-induced internalization (Fig.4). Interestingly, coexpression of either β-arrestin-V53D or β-arrestin (319–418) significantly inhibited the effect of β-arrestin. Importantly, β-arrestin (319–418) and β-arrestin-V53D did not have any apparent effect on internalization of the transferrin receptor (data not shown), indicating that expression of either of these constructs does not inhibit all clathrin-mediated endocytotic processes. Because both β-arrestin-V53D and β-arrestin (319–418) inhibit the ability of β-arrestin to promote β2AR internalization in COS-1 cells, we next performed immunofluorescence analyses in these cells. As demonstrated in Fig. 5, we observe localization of both β-arrestin-V53D and β-arrestin (319–418) in clathrin-coated pits in the absence of receptor activation. This is in contrast to the localization of β-arrestin in clathrin-coated pits only in the presence of the agonist-activated receptor (Fig. 5 and Ref. 18Goodman Jr., O.B. Krupnick J.G. Santini F. Gurevich V.V. Penn R.B. Gagnon A.W. Keen J.H. Benovic J.L. Nature. 1996; 383: 447-450Crossref PubMed Scopus (1170) Google Scholar). Thus, the ability of β-arrestin-V53D and β-arrestin (319–418) to modulate arrestin-promoted β2AR internalization in COS-1 cells may lie in their ability to block endogenous clathrin-binding sites. The constitutive localization of β-arrestin-V53D in coated pits is consistent with the good clathrin binding exhibited by this mutant (Fig. 1 A) and again suggests that the clathrin-binding domain is more accessible in β-arrestin-V53D than in β-arrestin. Moreover, because β-arrestin is only colocalized with coated pits in the presence of the agonist-activated β2AR, it is tempting to speculate that upon binding to the phosphorylated agonist-activated GPR, β-arrestin undergoes a conformational change that renders the clathrin-binding site more accessible and that this change is partially mimicked by the β-arrestin-V53D mutant. The constitutive localization of β-arrestin (319–418) in coated pits in both COS-1 and HEK293 cells (Fig. 5 and data not shown) is consistent with the strong clathrin binding properties of β-arrestin (319–418) (Fig. 2 A), GST-β-arrestin (319–418) (data not shown), and GST-arrestin3 (318–409) (19Krupnick J.G. Goodman Jr., O.B. Keen J.H. Benovic J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 15011-15016Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar). Moreover, the localization of β-arrestin (319–418) in coated pits also suggests that its clathrin-binding domain is more accessible than in β-arrestin. Finally, the apparent differences in the localization of β-arrestin-V53D in COS-1 versus HEK293 cells (Fig. 5 and data not shown), as well as the differences in trafficking of β-arrestin in COS-1 versus HEK293 cells (Ref. 18Goodman Jr., O.B. Krupnick J.G. Santini F. Gurevich V.V. Penn R.B. Gagnon A.W. Keen J.H. Benovic J.L. Nature. 1996; 383: 447-450Crossref PubMed Scopus (1170) Google Scholar and data not shown), suggest that multiple mechanisms may be involved in agonist-induced trafficking of GPRs and that they may vary in different cells. Investigation into these possible differences are currently underway. In summary, we have biochemically characterized a C-terminal 100-amino acid construct of β-arrestin and an N-terminal Val to Asp mutant of β-arrestin with respect to their ability to interact with both receptors and clathrin and to disrupt agonist-induced GPR internalization in intact cells. We observed that β-arrestin-V53D binds well to clathrin but weakly to phosphorylated agonist-activated GPRs. Moreover, although β-arrestin-V53D inhibited the agonist-induced β2AR internalization promoted by exogenous β-arrestin in COS-1 cells, it was found to be only modestly effective in HEK293 cells. In contrast, β-arrestin (319–418), a construct that binds well to clathrin and completely lacks GPR binding activity, effectively inhibited agonist-induced β2AR internalization in both COS-1 and HEK293 cells. Finally, immunofluorescence analyses demonstrated that although β-arrestin (319–418) is constitutively localized in clathrin-coated pits in both COS-1 and HEK293 cells, β-arrestin-V53D is constitutively localized in coated pits only in COS-1 cells. These results demonstrate that β-arrestin (319–418) effectively blocks the arrestin-clathrin interaction in different cells and indicate the potential usefulness of this construct as a specific tool to investigate the agonist-induced trafficking of other GPRs."

The C2 domain of Nedd4, expressed as a glutathione S-transferase (GST) fusion protein, was sufficient to bind cellular membranes in a Ca2+-dependent manner.

An epitope-tagged Nedd4 lacking its C2 domain and stably expressed in Madin-Darby canine kidney cells failed to mediate the Ca2+-induced plasma membrane localization seen in wild-type (epitope-tagged) Nedd4.

The C2 domains described to date show significant diversity in the molecules they interact with, which include Ca2+, phospholipids, intracellular proteins, and inositol polyphosphates. The C2 domain spans approximately 120 amino acids and includes a region of conserved amino acids, the CaLB (Ca2+ lipid-binding) domain (18Clark J.D. Lin L.-L. Kriz R.W. Ramesha C.S. Sultzman L.A.

Based on the three-dimensional structure of the synaptotagmin first C2 domain (25Sutton R.B. Davletov B.A. Berghuis A.M. Sudhof T.C. Sprang S.R.

Nature. 1996; 380: 595-602Crossref PubMed Scopus (516) Google Scholar), it has been proposed that the interaction between the domain and its Ca2+ ligand occurs via a “C2 key.” This key consists of a ∼70-residue core (including the CaLB region) that folds into a four-stranded β sheet, forming a cavity lined with five aspartate (or in some cases asparagine or glutamate) residues, the Ca2+-binding sites (Fig. 1 B) (25Sutton R.B.

Nature. 1996; 380: 595-602Crossref PubMed Scopus (516) Google Scholar). Accordingly, two models of the Ca2+-stimulated phospholipid binding by the C2 domain have been proposed. The first model suggests conformational changes upon Ca2+ binding which expose either hydrophobic residues to insert into the lipid bilayer or charged residues to associate with specific phospholipid headgroups (28Newton A.C. Curr. Biol. 1995; 5: 973-976Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). The other model proposes displacement of a Ca2+ coordinating water molecule with the headgroup or phosphate oxygens of phospholipid, providing direct Ca2+ coordination (for review, see Ref.12Nalefski E.A. Falke J.J. Protein Sci. 1996; 5: 2375-2390Crossref PubMed Scopus (691) Google Scholar). Although the majority of C2 domains characterized thus far have been shown to bind Ca2+ directly, several C2 domains are believed to act independent of a direct Ca2+ interaction. Synaptotagmin, the membrane-spanning Ca2+ sensor in synaptic vesicles, contains two tandem C2 domains (29Perin M.S. Fried V.A. Mignery G.A. Jahn R. Sudhof T.C. Nature. 1990; 345: 260-263Crossref PubMed Scopus (650) Google Scholar). In several synaptotagmin isoforms (tagmin I, II, III, V, and VII) the first C2 domain (C2A) binds phospholipids in a Ca2+-dependent manner (30Davletov B.A. Sudhof T.C. J. Biol.

As such, in addition to the Ca2+-dependent regulatory role of the C2A domain, the C2B domain of synaptotagmin could act as a Ca2+ sensor in nerve terminals for regulated neurotransmitter release. In addition to the C2-lipid interactions, accumulating evidence suggests that at least some C2 domains bind proteins as well. The synaptotagmin C2A and C2B domains bind several proteins (for review, see Ref. 37Sudhof T.C. Rizo J. Neuron. 1996; 17: 379-388Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (396) Google Scholar) including Ca2+-dependent binding to syntaxin, a membrane protein in the presynaptic terminal, and AP-2, a hetero-oligomeric adapter complex in clathrin-coated pits (32Li C.

In addition, Ca2+-induced translocated PKC interacts with several proteins from the particulate fraction that only bind in the presence of PKC activators (40Ron D. Luo J. Mochly-Rosen D. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 24180-24187Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar). These proteins, receptors for activated protein kinase C (RACKs), are substrates of activated PKC (41Uberall F. Giselbrecht S. Hellbert K. Fresser F. Bauer B. Gschwendt M. Grunicke H.H. Baier G. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 4072-4078Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar) and peptides that mimic the binding site of PKC to RACKs (which contain the PKC-C2 domain) inhibit PKC translocation. Recombinant fragments of synaptotagmin containing the C2 region bind to RACKs and inhibit PKC translocation and association with these proteins (42Mochly-Rosen D. Miller K.G. Scheller R.H. Khaner H. Lopez J. Smith B.L. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 8120-8124Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). In addition, recent work (43Davis A.J. Butt J.T. Walker J.H. Moss S.E. Gawler D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 24333-24336Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar) has demonstrated a direct interaction between annexin VII and the CaLB domain of p120GAP, thereby furthering the notion that C2/CaLB domains interact with proteins as well. In the present study we show that Nedd4 expressed endogenously in Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cells associates with membranes and localizes to the plasma membrane in a Ca2+-dependent fashion, with a particular preference for the apical and lateral regions of these polarized epithelial cells. We also demonstrate that the Nedd4-C2 domain by itself is capable of mediating a Ca2+-dependent cellular membrane and phospholipid binding and that Nedd4 lacking its C2 domain (heterologously expressed in MDCK cells) fails to associate with the plasma membrane in response to Ca2+. These data suggest that the C2 domain may serve to localize Nedd4 to the apical and lateral regions of polarized epithelia. The epithelial MDCK cells, expressing endogenous Nedd4, were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum, penicillin (100 units/ml), and streptomycin (100 μg/ml) at 37 °C, 5% CO2 atmosphere. For ionophore treatment, cells were serum-starved for 16 h, trypsinized, resuspended in serum-free medium, and harvested. Cells were then washed twice with Ca2+-free medium (140 mm NaCl, 6 mm KCl, 1 mmMgCl2, 0.1 mm EDTA, 20 mm glucose, and 20 mm HEPES) and then incubated in that medium containing also 1 mm EGTA, pH 7.3, for 5 min at 37 °C in the presence or absence of 1 μm ionomycin and the indicated amount of free Ca2+ (maintained with Ca2+-EGTA buffers). The application of ionomycin in the presence of Ca2+ has been shown to induce increases in cytosolic calcium in MDCK cells (44Lang F. Friedrich F. Paulmichl M. Schobersberger W. Jungwirth A.

Physiol. 1995; 486: 557-569Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). The cells were then collected and washed twice with Ca2+-free medium (for −Ca2+ conditions) or +Ca2+ medium (same as −Ca2+ medium but containing 1.1 mmCaCl2) and resuspended in ±Ca2+ medium with 10 μg/ml of both leupeptin and aprotinin and 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. Cells were then homogenized, and nuclei and mitochondria were pelleted at 1000 × g (5 min, 4 °C). The supernatant was then spun at 100,000 × gfor 30 min (4 °C), and the cytosolic (supernatant, S100) and pellet (particulate, P100) fractions were collected for further analysis. Particulate (P100) fractions were resuspended in lysis buffer (50 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EGTA, 1% Triton X-100, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml of both leupeptin and aprotinin). Nedd4 was immunoprecipitated from the S100 and P100 fractions using an affinity-purified polyclonal antibody raised against glutathione S-transferase (GST)-Nedd4-WWII (2Staub O. Dho S. Henry P.C. Correa J. Ishikawa T. McGlade J. Rotin D. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 2371-2380Crossref PubMed Scopus (740) Google Scholar) by incubating for 4 h at 4 °C. The immunocomplexes were collected with protein A-Sepharose beads, washed five times with 20 mmHEPES, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 0.1% Triton X-100, 10% glycerol. Proteins were separated on 8% SDS-PAGE, transferred to nitrocellulose membrane, and immunoblotted with anti-Nedd4-WWII antibodies followed by horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies and ECL detection (Amersham Corp.). GST fusion proteins were prepared by polymerase chain reaction amplification of the region of rNedd4 cDNA (2Staub O. Dho S. Henry P.C. Correa J. Ishikawa T. McGlade J. Rotin D. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 2371-2380Crossref PubMed Scopus (740) Google Scholar) corresponding to the C2 domain (nucleotides 182–574). Polymerase chain reaction fragments were subcloned with flanking BamHI and EcoRI sites into the corresponding sites in pGEX-2TK (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.). The plasmid containing the C2 insert, verified by sequencing, were used to transform the HB101 strain of Escherichia coli. Fusion protein expression was induced with 0.2 mmisopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside (Pharmacia) for 4–5 h, and bacteria were collected and lysed by sonication in phosphate-buffered saline containing aprotinin, leupeptin, and phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (concentrations as stated above). Fusion proteins were purified from the bacterial lysate with gluthathione-agarose beads and eluted with 30 mm reduced glutathione (pH 8.0). For translocation assays, 200 μg (by protein determination) of crude membranes from MDCK cells, prepared as described above, were diluted into Ca2+-free medium, pH 7.5, containing 1 mm EGTA, 1 mmdithiothreitol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 10 μg/ml of both leupeptin and aprotinin. Membranes were then resuspended by sonication (5 × 1 s) and incubated with purified GST alone or GST-C2 (10 nm) in the presence or absence of Ca2+ for 30 min at 30 °C. Membrane-associated proteins were separated on 10% SDS-PAGE and immunoblotted with anti-GST antibodies as described above. For liposome binding experiments, liposomes of varying composition (either mixtures of or pure phosphatidylserine, phosphatidylinositol, or phosphatidylcholine) were used. Approximately 1 mg of the phospholipid in chloroform was dried under nitrogen, added to 1 ml of sucrose-containing media (25 mm HEPES, 0.1 mNaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 20% sucrose, pH 7.5), and sonicated at 4 °C five times for 1 s to resuspend. One hundred microliters of liposomes were incubated with 10 nm purified GST-C2 or GST alone in the presence of Ca2+ (1 mm) in a final assay volume of 1 ml. Liposomes were collected by centrifugation at 100,000 ×g for 30 min at 4 °C and proteins associated with them separated on 10% SDS-PAGE and immunoblotted with anti-GST antibodies, as described above. A C2-deleted (ΔC2) Nedd4 was created by deleting amino acids 79–191 (nucleotides 179–571) of Nedd4 using polymerase chain reaction. This construct, as well as full-length Nedd4 used as a control, were epitope-tagged with the T7 epitope (MASMTGGQQMG) placed at the N terminus of the molecule. These constructs, called T-Nedd4 or T-ΔC2-Nedd4, were subcloned into the pRC-CMV vector (Invitrogen Corp., San Diego, CA). Stable cell lines were generated by transfecting MDCK cells with the T-Nedd4 or T-ΔC2-Nedd4 constructs using LipofectAMINE (Life Technologies, Inc.) and selection in 1 mg/ml of G418 (Life Technologies, Inc.). Positive clones were tested for protein expression using anti-T7 antibodies (Novagen, Madison, WI). MDCK cells, either wild type or those expressing T-Nedd4 or T-ΔC2-Nedd4, were grown on permeant filters (Falcon 0.4-μm pore size, 6-well format; Becton Dickinson Labware, Lincoln Park, NJ) and then treated (or not) with Ca2+ plus ionomycin as described above. Following treatment, filters were washed and fixed briefly in 10% neutral buffered formalin, washed twice in phosphate-buffered saline, and stored at 4 °C. Cells on membranes were then permeabilized at room temperature in a humidity chamber for 30 min with 1% Triton X-100 in Tris-buffered saline (30 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl). The filters were cut from the inserts and incubated in 5% normal goat serum in antibody diluting buffer (Dimension Laboratories, Mississauga, ON, Canada) for 30 min followed by incubation for 2 h in the primary antibody (either 10 μg/ml of affinity-pure anti-Nedd4-WWII antibodies or 1:1000 dilution of anti-T7 antibodies). Filters were then washed four times with 30 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1% bovine serum albumin, 0.05% Triton X-100 (TBS buffer) followed by incubation with biotinylated goat anti-rabbit or anti-mouse secondary antibody (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) for 45 min (diluted 1:250 and 1:200 for anti-rabbit and anti-mouse secondary antibodies, respectively). This was followed by several washes in TBS buffer and one final wash in bicarbonate saline buffer (16 mm bicarbonate, 150 mm NaCl, supplemented with 2 mm HEPES, pH 8.5). The filters were then incubated for 45 min with avidin-Texas Red (Molecular Probes) (1:100 dilution in bicarbonate saline) followed by several additional bicarbonate saline washes and finally mounted in Vectashield (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA). The fixed and stained cells were viewed using a Zeiss LSM-4A inverted confocal microscope with ×63 oil objective (NA = 1.3). Texas Red (λex = 596, λem = 615) was detected by krypton-argon laser excitation (568 nm) and detection with a photomultiplier after an emission filter (>590 nm). Serial sections were acquired by line averaging the frames (n = 8) at descending z levels. Starting at the apical surface (i.e. the coverslip) a minimum of 20 optical sections (each 0.5 μm thick) were obtained for the monolayer. The photomicrographs represent multiple sections in the monolayer observed on each coverslip repeated for at least three independent preparations. Numerous proteins contain regions homologous to the C2 domain (Fig.1, A and B), most of which are thought to interact with cellular membranes. To assess whether Nedd4 displays a Ca2+-dependent association with membranes in vivo, we examined the changes in the subcellular distribution of endogenously expressed Nedd4 following an increase in intracellular Ca2+ in MDCK cells. MDCK cells were used because they represent a well characterized epithelial cell line, forming monolayers of polarized cells when grown to confluency, and because they express high levels of endogenous Nedd4 (2Staub O. Dho S. Henry P.C. Correa J. Ishikawa T. McGlade J. Rotin D. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 2371-2380Crossref PubMed Scopus (740) Google Scholar). The elevation in intracellular Ca2+ concentrations was achieved by incubating cells with 1 μm ionomycin in the presence of 1 mm Ca2+ for 5 min. Cells were then either fractionated and the soluble (S100) or particulate (P100) fractions analyzed for the presence of associated Nedd4 by immunoblotting or immunostained with anti-Nedd4 antibodies to follow intracellular localization of the protein. Fig.2, left, shows that in response to Ca2+ plus ionomycin treatment, the majority of endogenous Nedd4 was redistributed from the cytosolic to the particulate fraction. This redistribution was not caused by ionomycin itself, because treatment of cells with ionomycin alone (1 μm) did not alter the primarily cytosolic distribution of Nedd4 (Fig. 2, right). To follow directly the Ca2+-dependent subcellular distribution of endogenous Nedd4 in living cells, particularly in cells which are polarized, MDCK cells were grown to confluency on permeant filters to allow them to become polarized. Under these conditions, they form tight junctions and a sheet of high resistance epithelial monolayer. 2S. Dho and D. Rotin, unpublished data. Following treatment of cells without or with Ca2+ plus ionomycin, cells were permeabilized and immunostained with anti-Nedd4 antibodies followed by Texas Red-conjugated secondary antibodies, as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The cells were then viewed by confocal microscopy using a LSM-410 Zeiss laser scanning microscope. Fig. 3, A and B, depicts two series of horizontal (XY) sections of MDCK cells stained with affinity-pure anti-Nedd4 antibodies taken at 0.5-μm intervals starting from the apical (top) surface and representing either untreated control cells (Fig. 3 B) or Ca2+ plus ionomycin-treated cells (Fig. 3 A). As evident from Fig.3 A, after Ca2+ plus ionomycin treatment, the majority of Nedd4 was localized to the plasma membrane, preferentially accumulating at the apical and lateral membranes; only base-line levels (∼5%) of Nedd4 were detected in the membrane fraction of untreated cells (Fig. 3 B). Accordingly, vertical (XZ) reconstructions (summations) of all the images depicted in Fig. 3, A and B, indeed demonstrated strong staining for Nedd4 at the apical (top) region of the treated cells (Fig. 3 C), whereas the distribution of Nedd4 in the untreated cells was relatively even throughout the cell (Fig. 3 D). A time course of Nedd4 association with the apical/subapical membrane revealed the interaction persisted for approximately 30–45 min (data not shown). These results, therefore, support the above observation of Ca2+-induced association of Nedd4 with membranes. Moreover, they demonstrate that in polarized epithelia such as MDCK cells, endogenously expressed Nedd4 is preferentially redistributed to the apical and lateral regions of the cell in response to elevated intracellular levels of Ca2+. To determine whether the Ca2+-dependent membrane association of Nedd4 was due to the action of the C2 domain alone and not to other regions of the protein, a GST fusion protein encompassing the C2 domain was constructed and its association with purified membranes in response to Ca2+ was determined. Thus, 200 μg of MDCK crude membrane fractions (P100) were incubated with soluble GST-Nedd4-C2 or GST alone (10 nm each) in the presence of increasing concentrations of Ca2+ (+1 mm EGTA). Membranes were then collected and proteins separated on SDS-PAGE and immunoblotted with anti-GST antibodies to determine the amount of membrane-associated GST-Nedd4-C2. Our results show (Fig. 4) a basal association between the P100 fraction and the GST-Nedd4-C2 in the range of 0–300 nm Ca2+, consistent with our initial observation of limited membrane association of Nedd4 even in the absence of elevated intracellular Ca2+ levels (Fig.2 A). However, there was a clear and reproducible increase in membrane-associated GST-Nedd4-C2 when Ca2+ concentrations were raised from 300 to 500 nm, with no further increase in binding at concentrations up to 1000 nm (Fig. 4). GST alone did not bind to MDCK membranes. These results therefore demonstrate that the C2 domain of Nedd4 alone was sufficient to bind MDCK membranes in vitro and that this binding was Ca2+-dependent at Ca2+ concentrations >300 nm. In several Ca2+-responsive proteins, the C2 domain displays specificity toward negatively charged phospholipids (22Gawler D. Zhang L.-J. Reedijk M. Tung P.S. Moran M.

https://openalex.org/W2091838563,"Cartilage is unique among tissues of mesenchymal origin in that it is resistant to vascular invasion due to an intrinsic angiogenic inhibitor. During endochondral bone formation, however, calcified cartilage formed in the center of the cartilaginous bone rudiment allows vascular invasion, which initiates the replacement of cartilage by bone. The transition of cartilage from the angioresistant to the angiogenic status thus plays a key role in bone formation. However, the molecular basis of this phenotypic transition of cartilage has been obscure. We report here purification of an endothelial cell growth inhibitor from a guanidine extract of bovine epiphyseal cartilage. The N-terminal amino acid sequence indicated that the inhibitor was identical to chondromodulin I (ChM-I), a cartilage-specific growth-modulating factor. Purified ChM-I inhibited DNA synthesis and proliferation of vascular endothelial cells as well as tube morphogenesis in vitro. Expression of ChM-I cDNA in COS7 cells indicated that mature ChM-I molecules were secreted from the cells after post-translational modifications and cleavage from the transmembrane precursor at the predicted processing signal. Recombinant ChM-I stimulated DNA synthesis and proteoglycan synthesis of cultured growth plate chondrocytes, but inhibited tube morphogenesis of endothelial cells. In situ hybridization and immunohistochemical studies indicated that ChM-I is specifically expressed in the avascular zone of cartilage in developing bone, but not present in calcifying cartilage. These results suggest a regulatory role of ChM-I in vascular invasion during endochondral bone formation.

These results suggest a regulatory role of ChM-I in vascular invasion during endochondral bone formation. Cartilage tissue is avascular except during skeletal development, when endochondral bone formation occurs. This process is initiated by the formation of cartilage tissue from aggregated mesenchymal cells, and the cartilage formed serves as a mold for subsequent bone formation. Soon after the cartilaginous mold is formed, chondrocytes in the central part of the mold become markedly hypertrophic and calcified. Capillaries from the surrounding periosteum then invade the calcified zone at the center of the previously avascular cartilage shaft (1Poole A.R. Hall B. Newman S. Cartilage: Molecular Aspects. CRC Press, Boca Raton, FL1991: 179-211Google Scholar). Concomitantly with this neovascularization, osteoclasts and osteoblasts are recruited to gradually replace the calcified cartilage matrix with bone matrix and to excavate the bone marrow cavity (1Poole A.R. Hall B. Newman S. Cartilage: Molecular Aspects. CRC Press, Boca Raton, FL1991: 179-211Google Scholar, 2Schenk R.K. Wiener J. Spiro D. Acta Anat. Basel. 1968; 69: 1-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). The vascular invasion is thus a pivotal event, which coordinates chondrogenesis and subsequent osteogenesis in endochondral bone formation; angiogenesis is switched on at a precise stage during skeletal development. Despite the fundamental importance of this process in endochondral bone formation, our understanding of angiogenic switching in cartilage is limited.

These molecules could act as potential chemoattractants and mitogens for endothelial cells. These studies suggest that cartilage is potentially “angiogenic,” even though it maintains an “angiostatic” phenotype. However, the regulation of angiogenic switching in cartilage cannot be accounted for only by the expression of these angiogenic molecules, since these are expressed in cartilage and its surrounding tissues even under avascular conditions. There is an equally important component to the angiogenic switch, one governed by angiogenesis inhibitors (6Maione T.E. Gray G.S. Petro J. Hunt A.J. Donner A.L. Bauer S.I. Carson H.F. Sharpe R.J.

Folkman J. Cell. 1996; 86: 353-364Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (5991) Google Scholar) proposed the hypothesis that angiogenesis is regulated by the balance of both inducers and inhibitors of endothelial cell proliferation and migration. The cumulative levels of inducer and inhibitor signals maintain the endothelial cells in alternative states of quiescence and angiogenesis. The angiogenic switch could be activated either by increasing the levels of the inducers of endothelial cells or by reducing the levels of inhibitors (9Hanahan D. Folkman J. Cell. 1996; 86: 353-364Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (5991) Google Scholar). The resistance of cartilage to vascular invasion was first studied with the use of the chick chorioallantoic membrane by Kuettner and co-workers (10Kuettner K.E. Pauli B.U. Hall B.K. Cartilage. 1. Academic Press, New York1983: 281-312Google Scholar). They demonstrated that the resistance of cartilage was due to a low molecular weight anti-invasion factor extractable by guanidine (11Eisenstein R. Sorgente N. Soble L.W. Miller A. Kuettner K.E. Am. J. Pathol. 1973; 73: 765-774PubMed Google Scholar, 12Sorgente N. Kuettner K.E. Soble L.W. Eisenstein R. Lab. Invest. 1975; 32: 217-222PubMed Google Scholar). This anti-invasion factor turned out to be a specific elastase inhibitor of 15 kDa (13DiMuzio M.T. Tripier D. Kuettner K.E. J. Rheumatol. 1987; 14: 45-48PubMed Google Scholar). Vascular invasion can be modulated by the activation or inhibition of proteinases (14Brown R.A. Taylor C. McLaughlin B. McFarland C.D. Weiss J.B. Ali S.Y.

Moses previously identified tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinase-1 (TIMP-1) and its related molecules in cartilage, which were associated with the inhibition of angiogenesis (18Moses M.A. Sudhalter J.

TIMP-2 was also isolated as an angiogenesis inhibitor from the culture medium of chondrosarcoma cells (20Ohba Y. Goto Y. Kimura Y. Suzuki F. Hisa T. Takahashi K. Takigawa M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1245: 1-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). However, no cartilage-specific macromolecule capable of inhibiting angiogenesis has been identified. We previously reported that extracts of cartilage contain an endothelial cell growth inhibitor (21Takigawa M. Shirai E. Enomoto M. Hiraki Y. Fukuya M. Suzuki F. Shiio T. Yugari Y. Cell Biol. Int. Rep. 1985; 9: 619-625Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar, 22Takigawa M. Shirai E. Enomoto M. Hiraki Y. Suzuki F. Shiio T. Yugari Y. J. Bone Miner. Metab. 1988; 6: 83-92Crossref Scopus (6) Google Scholar), while it showed no inhibitory activity for collagenase. Taking advantage of its affinity to heparin, we purified the endothelial cell growth inhibitor to homogeneity from cartilage. Here we report for the first time the amino acid sequence of the inhibitor and establish that the inhibitor is identical to a cartilage-specific growth-modulating component, chondromodulin I (ChM-I) (23Hiraki Y. Tanaka H. Inoue H. Kondo J. Kamizono A. Suzuki F. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1991; 175: 971-977Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). The expression pattern of ChM-I in a developing bone strongly implies its physiological significance as a key component in the phenotypic transition from angiostatic to angiogenic cartilage during endochondral bone development. Bovine carotid artery endothelial (BCAE) cells were isolated from adult bovine carotid arteries and cultured by the reported method (24Gospodarowicz D. Moran J. Braun D. Birdwell C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1976; 73: 4120-4124Crossref PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar, 25Hagiwara H. Shimonaka M. Morisaki M. Ikekawa N. Inada Y. Thromb. Res. 1984; 33: 363-370Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Briefly, fresh bovine carotid arteries were opened lengthwise with a scalpel. The endothelial cell layer was obtained by gently scraping the intimal surface with a scalpel. These BCAE cells were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) at 37 °C under 5% CO2 in air. After the primary culture, the cells were subcultured at a rate of one generation per passage to make a stock of frozen cells. Cells at passages 10–20 were used in the present study. For the determination of the DNA synthesis in the cells, BCAE cells (4 × 103 cells/well) were inoculated onto 96-multiwell plates (Corning Glass Works, Corning, NY) and cultured in 0.1 ml of MEM containing 10% FBS. When the culture became subconfluent 2 days after inoculation, the medium was replaced by MEM containing 10% FBS and a test sample. The cells were incubated for 16 h and labeled with [3H]thymidine (5 μCi/ml; NEN Life Science Products) for the last 4 h. The radioactivity incorporated into DNA was determined with a scintillation spectrometer. Bovine capillary endothelial (BCE) cells were isolated from bovine brain cortex as described previously (26Goetz I.E. Warren J. Estrada C. Roberts E. Krause D.N. In Vitro Cell. Dev. Biol. 1985; 21: 172-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). The cells were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium containing 10% FBS supplemented with 15 mm HEPES (pH 7.3) and 2 ng/ml FGF-2 (R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN) in dishes that had been coated with type IV collagen (Sigma). The cells were used at passages 5–9. The cell proliferation experiments were carried out as described by Matsuzaki et al. (27Matsuzaki K. Yoshitake Y. Matuo Y. Sakaki H. Nishikawa K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 9911-9915Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar) with slight modifications. BCE cells (2 × 104 cells) were plated in type IV collagen-coated 60-mm diameter culture dishes (Falcon, Lincoln Park, NJ) in 6 ml of the same medium as for maintenance, and incubated for 4 h until they became attached to the dish. Then the medium was renewed, and a test sample was added. The cells were further incubated without change of the culture medium, harvested at daily intervals by treatment with trypsin, and assayed in a Coulter counter (Hialeah, FL). Chondrocytes were isolated from the growth plate cartilage of the ribs of young male New Zealand White rabbits as described previously (28Shimomura Y. Yoneda T. Suzuki F. Calcif. Tissue Res. 1975; 19: 179-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). The isolated cells (104 cells/well) were inoculated onto 96-microwell plates, and cultured in 0.1 ml of MEM containing 10% FBS. When the cells became confluent, their proteoglycan and DNA syntheses were determined as described previously (29Hiraki Y. Inoue H. Shigeno C. Sanma Y. Bentz H. Rosen D.M. Asada A. Suzuki F. J. Bone Miner. Res. 1991; 6: 1373-1385Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). Briefly, the chondrocytes were preincubated in DMEM containing 0.3% FBS for 24 h. The medium was then replaced by DMEM (0.1 ml) containing 0.3% FBS and a test sample. After incubation for 3 h, the cultures were labeled with [35S]sulfate (5 μCi/ml) for another 17 h. Proteoglycans in the culture medium were precipitated with 1% cetylpyridinium chloride, and the radioactivity in the precipitates was measured. Other cultures were labeled with [3H]thymidine (13 μCi/ml) for 4 h from 22 h after the addition of test samples. The radioactivity incorporated into DNA was measured with a scintillation spectrometer. The test samples were first dissolved in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) containing 0.1% fatty acid-free bovine serum albumin (BSA; Sigma), and used at 100-fold dilution in the bioassays mentioned above. Fetal bovine epiphyseal cartilage (2 kg of cartilage from 3–6-month-old embryos) was homogenized and extracted with 1 m guanidinium chloride, and then fractionated with 45–60% acetone at 4 °C, as described (30Suzuki F. Hiraki Y. Kato Y. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 146: 313-320Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). The resultant precipitates (12 g) were dissolved in 4 mguanidinium chloride containing 0.1 m6-amino-n-caproic acid, 20 mm Tris-HCl, and 1m NaCl (pH 8.0). Subfractions of the cartilage extracts (CE) were prepared by successive ultrafiltration through Amicon (Beverly, MA) XM300 and Amicon YM100 filters (CE100–300 kDa), and then Amicon XM50 filters (CE50–100 kDa), and finally concentrated on Amicon YM10 filters (CE10–50 kDa). The CE100–300 kDa fraction was applied to a Sephacryl S-200 column (3.0 × 90 cm; Pharmacia, Uppsala, Sweden) equilibrated with 20 mm sodium phosphate (pH 7.4) containing 5 m guanidinium chloride and 0.3 mNaCl, and the eluate was collected in 8-ml fractions. Bioactivity was recovered in fractions 25–31, which were dialyzed against 20 mm sodium phosphate (pH 7.4) containing 0.15 mNaCl. The dialyzed material (110 mg) was applied to a heparin-Toyopearl affinity column (0.7 × 20 cm; Tosoh, Tokyo, Japan) equilibrated with 20 mm sodium phosphate (pH 7.4) containing 0.15m NaCl and 0.03% CHAPS. Bound materials were eluted with a linear gradient of 0.15–1.2 m NaCl. The cartilage-derived endothelial cell growth inhibitor was purified to homogeneity from the fraction eluted with 0.5–1.2 m NaCl (“Hep. 0.5–1.2m fraction”) by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) on a reverse-phase column of YMC C4 (0.46 × 15 cm) that had been equilibrated with 25% acetonitrile/2-propanol (3/7, v/v) in 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid. The column was developed with a linear gradient of 25–70% of the same solvent for 40 min. Each peak was collected and analyzed by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) in 12.5% gel. Finally, about 200 μg of purified inhibitor was isolated. The N-terminal amino acid sequence of the inhibitor was determined with a gas-phase sequencer (model 470A, Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). Formation of tubelike cellular networks of BCAE cells was assayed in duplicate by the method of Kanayasu et al. (31Kanayasu T. Nakao-Hayashi J. Asuwa N. Morita I. Ishii T. Ito H. Murota S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1989; 159: 572-578Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar) with slight modifications. A mixture of 0.3% type I collagen solution (0.6 ml; Koken, Tokyo, Japan), 0.1 m NaOH (75 μl), and 10-fold concentrated MEM (75 μl) was poured into 12-multiwell plates and allowed to form a lower gel at 37 °C. Then, 1 × 105 BCAE cells in 2 ml of MEM containing 10% FBS were inoculated onto the gel and incubated for 24 h. Subsequently, the medium was aspirated and an aqueous solution (40 μl) containing a test sample was added. The mixed collagen solution (0.75 ml) was overlaid on the cells to form an upper gel at 37 °C. Finally, MEM containing 10% FBS was added on the collagen gel. On the third day of culture, phase-contrast microscopic pictures were taken. For semiquantitative analysis of tube morphogenesis (32Abe T. Okamura K. Ono M. Kohno K. Mori T. Hori S. Kuwano M. J. Clin. Invest. 1993; 92: 54-61Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar), cells forming tubelike cellular networks (>100 μm in length) were counted after viable staining of the cells with 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl tetrazolium bromide (33Montesano R. Schaller G. Orci L. Cell. 1991; 66: 697-711Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (430) Google Scholar). By serial dilution of ChM-I, a dose range to cause 50% inhibition of tube formation over the control was determined. The test samples were first dissolved in PBS containing 0.1% fatty acid-free BSA, and used at 100-fold dilution for the bioassay. For the expression studies, the plasmid pUChM261 was constructed by ligation of the EcoRI linker into the ScaI site of a plasmid harboring bovine ChM-I precursor cDNA, pUChM26 (23Hiraki Y. Tanaka H. Inoue H. Kondo J. Kamizono A. Suzuki F. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1991; 175: 971-977Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). The 1.25-kilobase pair EcoRI fragment released by the EcoRI digestion of pUChM261 was then cloned into the EcoRI site of the pcDL-SRα296 vector (34Takebe Y. Seiki M. Fujisawa J. Hoy P. Yokota K. Arai K. Yoshida M. Arai N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 466-472Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The resultant plasmid, containing the bovine ChM-I precursor in the sense direction, was named pcDLChMI-1. A plasmid containing the ChM-I precursor sequence in the opposite direction (pcDLChMI-3) was used as a negative control vector. Monkey COS7 cells were transfected with pcDLChMI-1 or pcDLChMI-3 by the application of calcium phosphate-DNA coprecipitates to cells grown in 10-cm diameter culture dishes. After 4 h of culture in DMEM containing 5% FBS, the culture medium was replaced and the culture was conditioned for another 60 h. The medium (23 ml) was then recovered and applied to a heparin-Toyopearl affinity column. Bound materials were eluted stepwise with buffer containing 0.5 m NaCl and buffer containing 1.2 m NaCl. The fraction eluted with 1.2m NaCl was concentrated 30-fold with a Centricon (Amicon). Recombinant bovine ChM-I was further purified to homogeneity by HPLC on a reverse-phase column, and its N-terminal amino acid sequence was determined. The concentrated heparin-bound fraction of the conditioned medium (0.9 ml) was separated by 12.5% SDS-PAGE and transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane BA-85 (Schleicher & Schuell). The membrane was immersed in TBST buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 0.05% Tween 20) containing 5% skimmed milk for 30 min. Then the membrane was rinsed twice with TNT buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 2 mm ETDA, 0.14 m NaCl, 0.05% Tween 20) and treated with anti-ChM-I antibody at a 1:200 dilution in TBST buffer. The membrane was then washed four times with TNT buffer, and ChM-I was located with an immunoblot assay kit (Bio-Rad) using goat anti-rabbit IgG antibody conjugated to horseradish peroxidase as the second antibody. The Hep.-1.2 m fraction (10 μg) prepared from the cartilage extracts was used as a standard. For raising anti-ChM-I antibody, an oligopeptide corresponding to the mature bovine ChM-I protein sequence at amino acids 49–69 was synthesized. The peptide was coupled to thyroglobulin through the C-terminal Cys residue, and then mixed with Freund's adjuvant and injected into rabbits. The ChM-I antiserum was purified using Staphylococcus protein A (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.) according to standard protocols, and the antibody was stored at approximately 2 mg/ml. Developing bovine tails were collected from 5-month-old fetuses, and fixed overnight at 4 °C in periodate-lysine-paraformaldehyde solution for immunohistochemistry or in 4% paraformaldehyde in 0.01 mPBS (pH 7.4) for in situ hybridization. The caudal vertebrae were dissected out, dehydrated in a graded series of ethanol, and embedded in paraffin. Longitudinal serial sections were cut at 6 μm and processed for histological examinations. Deparaffinized sections were treated with 1% H2O2 in methanol for 30 min to reduce endogenous peroxidase activity, and washed in PBS. Sections were treated with 500 units/ml testicular hyaluronidase (type V, Sigma) in PBS for 20 min at 37 °C and rinsed in PBS. The slides were covered with 5% normal goat serum in PBS for 30 min and then with anti-ChM-I polyclonal antibody, and further incubated overnight at 4 °C. Preimmune rabbit IgG was used as a negative control. Anti-ChM-I antibody was used at the dilution of 1:300. Immunoreactions were performed using a Vectastain peroxidase rabbit ABC kit (Vector Laboratories, Burlingam, CA). Sections were washed with PBS, and the antigenic sites were demonstrated by treating the sections with 0.05% 3,3′-diaminobenzidine tetrahydrochloride (Dojin Chemicals, Tokyo, Japan) in 0.05 m Tris-HCl buffer (pH 7.6), and 0.01% H2O2 for 7 min. Nuclei were stained with methyl green. The sections were then dehydrated in ethanol, cleared in xylene, and mounted in Permount (Fisher Scientific, Pittsburgh, PA). Consecutive sections were stained with hematoxylin-eosin for histological characterization using von Kossa's technique for the identification of calcium phosphate. The in situ hybridization procedures were essentially as described by Hayashi et al. (35Hayashi M. Ninomiya Y. Parsons J. Hayashi K. Olsen B.R. Trelstad R.L. J. Cell Biol. 1986; 102: 2302-2309Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar) and Iyama et al.(36Iyama K. Ninomiya Y. Olsen B.R. Linsenmayer T.F. Trelstad R.L. Hayashi M. Anat. Rec. 1991; 229: 462-472Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). The ChM-I cDNA probe used for in situhybridization was a 900-base pair EcoRI-BamHI fragment. The probe was labeled with [35S]thymidine 5′-(α-thio)triphosphate and [3H]thymidine 5′-triphosphate (DuPont) by nick translation to the specific activities of 3.1 × 108 cpm/μg DNA and 1.1 × 107 cpm/μg DNA, respectively. After hybridization, the slides were washed under high stringency conditions as described previously (35Hayashi M. Ninomiya Y. Parsons J. Hayashi K. Olsen B.R. Trelstad R.L. J. Cell Biol. 1986; 102: 2302-2309Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). The dried tissue sections were dipped into Kodak NTB2 emulsion and exposed for 3–7 days at 4 °C. After autoradiography, the sections were counterstained with hematoxylin. For the semiquantitative analysis of labeling intensity, the number of autoradiographic silver grains per cell was counted in 100 cells in five zones of the epiphyseal cartilage at magnification of ×250 under oil immersion. The specificity of the hybridization signals was confirmed by RNase treatment of the sections (2 mg/ml, 1 h at room temperature) before hybridization with the DNA probe as a negative control. Only a few autoradiographic silver grains were found on the sections digested with RNase, implying the specificity of the hybridization with the ChM-I probe in a manner dependent on the presence of the RNA in the tissue sections. Acetone precipitates of cartilage extracts were subfractionated by ultrafiltration into three portions: the first fraction containing materials with apparent molecular masses of 100–300 kDa (CE100–300 kDa), the second with materials of 50–100 kDa (CE50–100 kDa), and the third containing materials of 10–50 kDa (CE10–50 kDa). The test samples were incubated with confluent monolayers of BCAE cells for 16 h, and their inhibitory activity on DNA synthesis was assayed as described under “Materials and Methods.” In agreement with our previous observations (22Takigawa M. Shirai E. Enomoto M. Hiraki Y. Suzuki F. Shiio T. Yugari Y. J. Bone Miner. Metab. 1988; 6: 83-92Crossref Scopus (6) Google Scholar), CE100–300 kDa inhibited the [3H]thymidine incorporation of the cells in a dose-dependent manner, whereas CE50–100 kDahad only a marginal effect (Fig.1 A). The concentration of CE100–300 kDa required for 50% inhibition (IC50) was approximately 50 μg/ml. It was also noted that the inhibitory effect on DNA synthesis of CE10–50 kDa was as potent as that of CE100–300 kDa (Fig.1 A). The inhibitory activity in CE100–300 kDa was further separated by Sephacryl S-200 chromatography in 5 mguanidinium chloride and 0.3 m NaCl. Bioactivity was coeluted with materials having an apparent molecular mass of 10–30 kDa. There was no inhibitory activity in the materials of a higher molecular mass under this highly dissociative condition, suggesting the possibility that the inhibitor was partitioned in CE100–300 kDa and CE10–50 kDa by forming aggregates or binding to a certain component in cartilage. The active fractions were pooled and dialyzed. The materials were then subjected to heparin-Toyopearl affinity chromatography. The bound materials were eluted with a linear gradient from 0.15 to 1.2m NaCl. Bioactivity was recovered in the fractions eluted with from 0.5 m NaCl. The active fractions were pooled (Hep. 0.5–1.2 m). The IC50 of the Hep. 0.5–1.2 m fraction was approximately 3 μg/ml (Fig.1 A). The materials not bound to the column (Hep.-pass) exhibited no inhibitory activity. The endothelial cell growth inhibitor was finally purified to homogeneity by YMC C4 reverse-phase HPLC. Bioactivity was coeluted with a single protein peak. The SDS-PAGE analysis showed a single diffuse band of 25 kDa (Fig. 1 B). The N-terminal amino acid sequence of the inhibitor was then determined (Fig. 1 C) and found to be identical to that of ChM-I, which was previously found to have a growth-promoting activity on cultured chondrocytes (23Hiraki Y. Tanaka H. Inoue H. Kondo J. Kamizono A. Suzuki F. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1991; 175: 971-977Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). The purified ChM-I from the CE100–300 kDa fraction inhibited the DNA synthesis by BCAE cells in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 1 A), and its IC50 was approximately 200 ng/ml. The protein recovery and relative inhibitory activity at each purification step are summarized in Table I. We recently isolated a novel growth-promoting factor chondromodulin II (ChM-II) from cartilage extracts (37Hiraki Y. Inoue H. Kondo J. Kamizono A. Yoshitake Y. Shukunami C. Suzuki F. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 22657-22662Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). ChM-II is distinct from ChM-I, having no sequence similarity with each other. However, similar to ChM-I, it stimulated DNA synthesis and proteoglycan synthesis in cultured chondrocytes. On the other hand, unlike ChM-I, ChM-II exhibited no inhibitory action on DNA synthesis in BCAE cells (Fig.2 A).Table IPurification of cartilage-derived endothelial cell growth inhibitor from guanidine extracts of bovine epiphyseal cartilagePurification stepTotal proteinYieldIC50%μg/mlFetal epiphyseal cartilage2 kg (wet weight)Acetone fractionation12 g (wet weight)Ultrafiltration (CE100–300 kDa)512 mg10050Sephacryl S-2"

Additionally, in skeletal muscle, the RyR appears to play a signal-transducing role in excitation-contraction coupling by communicating with the voltage-sensing dihydropyridine receptor in the transverse tubule/plasmalemma. RyRs are the largest ion channels known, having net molecular masses of 2.3 MDa. Both the skeletal muscle and heart RyRs comprise four identical large subunits (565 kDa) encoded by genes (designated Ryr1 and Ryr2, respectively). In addition to these very large subunits, a much smaller modulatory protein, identified as an FK506-binding protein (FKBP12 in skeletal and FKBP12.6 in cardiac muscle) copurifies with the receptor, and may also be considered as an integral component of RyRs (7Jayaraman T.

Up to four copies of FKBP12/FKBP12.6 can bind per molecule of RyR. Electron microscopy is the only practical approach for elucidating morphological details of giant membrane-associated complexes such as RyRs (14Saito A. Inui M. Radermacher M. Frank J. Fleischer S.

Biol. 1995; 2: 18-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). Recently, two independent three-dimensional reconstructions of the skeletal muscle RyR determined from electron micrographs of frozen-hydrated, detergent-solubilized receptors have been described (16Radermacher M. Rao V. Grassucci R. Frank J. Timerman A.P. Fleischer S. Wagenknecht T. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 127: 411-423Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar, 17Serysheva I.I. Orlova E.V. Chiu W. Sherman M.B. Hamilton S.L. van Heel M. Struct. Biol. 1995; 2: 18-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). Both reconstructions show the RyR to be a 4-fold symmetric molecule in which 10 or more distinct globular domains are apparent even at the limited resolution attained (≈3 nm). About 80% of the mass of the receptor forms a cytoplasmic assembly (29 × 29 × 12 nm), and the remaining 20% projects as a baseplate from one face of the cytoplasmic assembly, and likely forms the transmembrane portion of the receptor. This interpretation agrees with predictions based upon the sequence of Ryr1 and Ryr2 which implicate the carboxyl-terminal fifth of Ryr1 as comprising the transmembrane segments (18Takeshima H.

In skeletal muscle, RyRs are primarily localized at triad junctions, regions where the terminal cisternae of the SR form junctional contacts with the transverse tubules, invaginations of the plasmalemma (21Franzini-Armstrong C. J. Cell Biol. 1970; 47: 488-499Crossref PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar, 22Franzini-Armstrong C. Jorgensen A.O. Annu. Rev.

Cell Biol. 1988; 107: 2587-2600Crossref PubMed Scopus (589) Google Scholar). The transmembrane assembly of the RyR traverses the SR membrane, and the cytoplasmic assembly occupies the gap between the SR and sarcolemma/transverse tubule membrane systems (24Inui M. Saito A. Fleischer S. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 1740-1747Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 25Lai F.A. Erickson H.P. Rousseau E. Liu Q.Y. Meissner G. Nature. 1988; 331: 315-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Upon depolarization of the myofiber, RyRs become activated when they receive a signal from voltage sensors, now known to be dihydropyridine receptors (DHPRs) (26Rios E. Brum G. Nature. 1987; 325: 717-720Crossref PubMed Scopus (643) Google Scholar, 27Tanabe T. Beam K.G. Powell J.A. Numa S. Nature. 1988; 366: 134-139Crossref Scopus (580) Google Scholar), located in the sarcolemma/transverse tubules, by a process known as excitation-contraction coupling. Besides dihydropyridine receptors, several other proteins are localized to these junctional regions, some of which interact with the RyR to modulate its function. One of these proteins is the FKBP12, mentioned above. Although RyRs still exhibit calcium channel activity in vitro following dissociation of FKBP12, their gating properties are altered (8Timerman A.P. Ogunbumni E. Freund E. Wiederrecht G. Marks A.R.

Specifically, FKBP12 stabilizes the closed state of the receptor and decreases the frequency of subconductance states when the channel is induced to open. FKBP12 has also been found to be associated with an inositol-1,4,5-trisphosphate receptor/calcium release channel (33Cameron A.M. Steiner J.P. Sabatini D.M. Kaplin A.I. Walensky L.D. Snyder S.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 1784Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar), whereas an isoform of FKBP12, FKBP12.6, is associated with the cardiac isoform of the RyR (9Timerman A.P.

Physiol. 1997; 272: 1726-1733Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Further underscoring the potential importance of FKBP12 in skeletal muscle, a recent study has reported that treatment of skinned skeletal muscle fibers with the drug FK506, which causes FKBP12 to dissociate from the RyR, disrupted excitation-contraction coupling (36Lamb G.D. Stephenson D.G. J. Physiol. 1996; 494: 569-576Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Calmodulin (CaM) is another modulatory ligand of the RyR. In vitro studies have shown that CaM binds to the RyR with high (nanomolar) affinity and modulates its calcium channel activity in vitro without involvement of CaM-dependent kinases (37Smith J.S. Rousseau E. Meissner G. Circ. Res. 1989; 64: 352-359Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar, 38Yang H.C. Reedy M.M. Burke C.L. Strasburg G.M.

J. 1995; 69: 106-119Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar). Knowledge of the binding sites of FKBP12 and CaM on the three-dimensional architecture of the RyR, as well as their effects, if any, on the structure of the receptor are expected to aid in understanding the mechanisms of their modulation of RyR function. Previously, we showed by electron microscopy that both CaM and FKBP12 are bound to distinct locations at the peripheral regions of the cytoplasmic assembly of the RyR (40Wagenknecht T. Berkowitz J. Grassucci R. Timerman A.P. Fleischer S. Biophys. J. 1994; 67: 2286-2295Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 41Wagenknecht T. Grassucci R. Berkowitz J. Wiederrecht G.J. Xin H.-B. Fleischer S. Biophys. J. 1996; 70: 1709-1715Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). However, these localizations were deduced from averaged images that showed the RyR in projection from a single orientation (along the 4-fold symmetry axis) and, hence, did not show the three-dimensional locations of the CaM and FKBP12 relative to each other or to the distinctive structural domains comprising the RyR. Furthermore, for the CaM studies a gold cluster probe was covalently attached to the CaM to enhance its detectability in electron micrographs, but at the cost of compromising the accuracy of localization. Here we describe three-dimensional reconstructions of RyR·FKBP12 and RyR·CaM complexes in which FKBP12 and CaM are resolved directly, without attached high-density labels. Recombinant human FKBP12 was prepared as described previously (11Lam E. Martin M.M. Timerman A.P. Sabers C. Fleischer S. Lukas T. Abraham R.T. O'Keefe S.J. O'Neill E.A. Wiederrecht G.J. J. Biol.

CHAPS was from Sigma or Calbiochem (La Jolla, CA). Wheat germ and other biochemicals were from Sigma. RyRs were isolated from terminal cisternae vesicles (42Saito A. Seiler S. Chu A. Fleischer S. J.

Biophys. J. 1994; 67: 2286-2295Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Biotinylated CaM was used to provide an independent means of assaying binding to the RyR in the event that density arising from CaM was not detected in averaged images and three-dimensional reconstructions. The biotin modification did not contribute significantly to the images that were obtained by cryo-EM (described below). RyR·CaM complexes were formed by adding 0.5–1 μl of RyR (≈0.4 μm) in buffer I (20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 1.0 m NaCl, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5% CHAPS, 1 μg/ml leupeptin) to 20 μl of CaM (1 μm) in a buffer consisting of 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 0.15 m KCl, 0.1 mm CaCl2 and incubating at room temperature. At between 10 and 20 min of incubation time, 5-μl aliquots were removed, applied to EM grids, and immediately frozen as described below. Since the final buffer conditions differed from those used in prior studies (16Radermacher M. Rao V. Grassucci R. Frank J. Timerman A.P. Fleischer S. Wagenknecht T. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 127: 411-423Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar), grids were also prepared exactly as described except omitting the CaM for use as a control in the subsequent structural analyses. During isolation or storage of RyRs some of the bound FKBP12 dissociates, and therefore it was necessary to incubate the purified receptor with FKBP12 to assemble RyR·FKBP12 complexes, which was done as described by Wagenknecht et al. (41Wagenknecht T. Grassucci R. Berkowitz J. Wiederrecht G.J. Xin H.-B. Fleischer S. Biophys. J. 1996; 70: 1709-1715Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). The buffer (buffer I) used for this study was similar to that used previously to determine the three-dimensional architecture of the RyR (16Radermacher M. Rao V. Grassucci R. Frank J. Timerman A.P. Fleischer S. Wagenknecht T. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 127: 411-423Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar), and therefore a new “control” reconstruction was not determined. Specimens were applied to 300 mesh molybdenum grids coated with a thin (≈5 nm) carbon film suspended over a thicker (>10 nm) holey carbon film (16Radermacher M. Rao V. Grassucci R. Frank J. Timerman A.P. Fleischer S. Wagenknecht T. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 127: 411-423Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar)). The thin carbon film was applied to the holey grid within a few hours of applying the specimen as follows. First, a thin layer of carbon was evaporated onto a piece of freshly cleaved mica which was then cut into ≈5 × 5-mm squares. The carbon was floated off of the mica pieces onto an air-water interface, a holey grid was placed onto the floating carbon with the holey-carbon side down, and then picked up with a forceps and allowed to dry. By this procedure, the surface of the thin carbon that faces away from the grid (and onto which the specimen is applied) is the same surface that had been in contact with the mica. The grids so prepared were glow-discharged in air using a Model PDC-3XG plasma cleaner/sterilizer (Harrick Scientific Corp., Ossining, NY) less than 1 h prior to sample application. Five-microliter portions of specimen were applied to the grids and blotted using a guillotine device (modification of the design of Cyrklaff et al., (45Cyrklaff M. Adrian M. Dubochet J. J. Electron Microsc. Tech. 1990; 16: 351-355Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar)) that clamps the grid between two pieces of filter paper (Whatman No. 1) until within a few milliseconds of being plunged into the cryogen (liquid ethane that is supercooled by a liquid nitrogen bath). Specimen grids were loaded into a Gatan (Warrendale, PA) model 626 cryoholder and examined in a Philips EM420 transmission electron microscope operated at 100 kV and a nominal magnification of × 38,000. The temperature of the specimen grid was maintained at −176 ± 2 °C. Three exposures were collected for each specimen field: two with the grid tilted to 50° and one untilted. The objective lens was underfocused by 1.5–2.0 μm, and the electron dose for each exposure was estimated at 800–1000 electrons/nm2. Two exposures were made with the specimen tilted to improve the probability that a useable micrograph would be obtained, since most micrographs of tilted specimens suffered from specimen drift or charging; for unknown reasons, often these effects were reduced in the second micrograph. Analysis of the micrographs was done using the SPIDER software package (46Frank J. Radermacher M. Penczek P. Zhu J. Li Y. Ladjadj M. Leith A. J. Struct. Biol. 1996; 116: 190-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (1804) Google Scholar, 47Frank J. Three-Dimensional Electron Microscopy of Macromolecular Assemblies. Academic Press, New York1995Google Scholar). Three-dimensional reconstructions were determined by the random conical tilt method from images of individual RyRs extracted from micrographs recorded with the specimen tilted (16Radermacher M. Rao V. Grassucci R. Frank J. Timerman A.P. Fleischer S. Wagenknecht T. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 127: 411-423Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar, 48Radermacher M. Wagenknecht T. Verschoor A.

The corresponding images obtained for untilted specimen were used to identify RyRs in the 2–4-fold symmetric orientations (i.e. “right-side-up” and “upside down”) by multivariate statistical analysis of RyR images that had been brought into mutual alignment. The relative azimuthal angles of the 4-fold symmetric particles are used by the three-dimensional reconstruction algorithm, but the images themselves are not used to compute the reconstruction. Details of the procedure were essentially the same as were used in our previous study of RyRs without bound CaM or FKBP12 (16Radermacher M. Rao V. Grassucci R. Frank J. Timerman A.P. Fleischer S. Wagenknecht T. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 127: 411-423Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). Before comparing two reconstructions quantitatively they were scaled with respect to density distribution and magnification using the SPIDER operation DRDIFF and the SPIDER procedure, SIZEMINUS, respectively (documentation is available at the World Wide Web sitehttp:////www.wadsworth.org/spider_doc/docs/spider.htm). The resolutions of all of the reconstructions, as assessed by the differential phase residual and Fourier ring correlation (16Radermacher M. Rao V. Grassucci R. Frank J. Timerman A.P. Fleischer S. Wagenknecht T. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 127: 411-423Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar), were 35–40 Å, which is somewhat poorer than was attained (31–33 Å) in our previously described reconstructions of the unliganded RyR (16Radermacher M. Rao V. Grassucci R. Frank J. Timerman A.P. Fleischer S. Wagenknecht T. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 127: 411-423Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar), but is, nevertheless, sufficient to resolve the RyR-bound CaM and FKBP12. Complexes of skeletal muscle RyR and CaM were prepared by incubating purified RyR with a molar excess of wheat germ CaM under conditions that have been shown to result in 4 mol of bound CaM/mol of RyR (see “Experimental Procedures”). Owing to the low signal-to-noise ratio in micrographs of frozen-hydrated macromolecules and the fact that the molecular mass of CaM is only 2.8% of the Ryr1 protein, we did not expect to observe any differences between unprocessed images of RyR·CaM complexes and RyR, and indeed none were observed (data not shown, for examples of electron micrographs of frozen-hydrated RyRs, see Refs. 16Radermacher M. Rao V. Grassucci R. Frank J. Timerman A.P. Fleischer S. Wagenknecht T. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 127: 411-423Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar, 40Wagenknecht T. Berkowitz J. Grassucci R.

J. 1992; 61: 936-940Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). To determine whether bound CaM was present and detectable by cryoelectron microscopy of RyR·CaM complexes, we first analyzed micrographs of receptors from untilted specimens, in which the RyRs were usually found oriented with their 4-fold symmetry axes normal to the grid support surface (“4-fold views”). This two-dimensional analysis can be done much faster than a three-dimensional one, and the statistical significance of structural features is easier to test. Correlation alignment, multivariate statistical analysis, and image averaging were done as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Averaged images of RyRs (which show the receptor's protein density projected along its 4-fold symmetry axis) that had been incubated in the presence and absence of CaM are shown in Fig.1, A and B, respectively. The two averaged images appear nearly indistinguishable, but the image formed by subtracting the two (Fig. 1 C) shows four symmetrically related differences corresponding to additional mass in the CaM-treated RyR (indicated by asterisk). These regions are highly significant statistically (confidence level greater than 99.9% by two-factor t test), and we attribute these density maxima to the four molecules of CaM that are known to bind to the RyR under the experimental conditions used. That these differences indeed correspond to CaMs is confirmed by similar experiments described in our previous study in which the CaMs were labeled with a gold cluster (40Wagenknecht T. Berkowitz J. Grassucci R. Timerman A.P. Fleischer S. Biophys. J. 1994; 67: 2286-2295Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). The locations of the gold clusters in that study correspond precisely (within ≈1 nanometer) to the major differences seen in Fig. 1, which are at the periphery of the cytoplasmic assembly about 10 nm from the center of the RyR (Fig. 1 D). Other density differences are also present in Fig. 1 C, but they are smaller in area and none have densities greater than 50% of that of the main differences. The minor differences might be due to structural rearrangements of the RyR that accompany CaM binding (see “Discussion”). We conclude from this two-dimensional analysis that the RyR-bound CaM can be detected by averaging images of non-stained, frozen-hydrated complexes without the need for labeling the CaM with heavy metal compounds. To more precisely map the locations of the RyR-bound CaMs we determined three-dimensional reconstructions of RyR·CaM and RyR (control) from micrographs that were obtained by tilting the specimen. Selected slices that are normal to the 4-fold symmetry axis are shown for the reconstructions of RyR·CaM and RyR in Fig. 2, A and B, respectively. The slices appear essentially identical for the two reconstructions, but when corresponding slices are subtracted, a prominent difference, repeated four times as required by the symmetry, appears in two successive slices that pass through the cytoplasmic assembly of the receptor (third and fourth panels from the left in Fig. 2 C). The only other differences apparent in Fig. 2 C are smaller, both in size and density. Projecting the three-dimensional reconstructions along the 4-fold axes, followed by subtraction, also shows this same set of symmetrically related differences as the dominant ones (Fig.2 D), and superposition of these regions onto the projected structure shows their locations to be identical to that found in the two-dimensional averaging experiment discussed in the previous section (cf. Figs. 1 and D). Thus the major difference between RyR·CaM and RyR detected by the three-dimensional analysis (which was determined from the images of tilted specimen) agrees with that found from the two-dimensional analysis (determined from images of untilted specimens). In Fig. 3, A and B, the RyR·CaM and RyR reconstructions are displayed as surface representations in several orientations. The two reconstructions appear nearly identical. A single, symmetrically-disposed set of differences is apparent when the structure is viewed from the SR-facing side (leftmost panel in Fig. 3) or from the side (rightmost panel, one of these regions is indicated by a “+”). The locations of these differences correspond to those of the main differences observed in the selected slices in Fig. 2 C. Subtraction of the two reconstructions confirms that these differences are indeed the largest in terms of volume (Fig. 3 C). Other than the main density differences, which we attribute to bound CaM (see below), the reconstructions of RyR·CaM and RyR are remarkably similar, implying that any conformational differences that might accompany binding of CaM are small, and to characterize them will require higher resolution than was achieved in this study (≈3.7 nm). We are confident that the four main differences between the RyR·CaM and RyR reconstructions are directly attributable to the excess mass contributed by the bound CaM, primarily because their locations in the 4-fold symmetric projection (Fig. 2 D) agree with those determined for CaM that was labeled with a gold cluster probe in our earlier study (40Wagenknecht T. Berkowitz J. Grassucci R. Timerman A.P. Fleischer S. Biophys. J. 1994; 67: 2286-2295Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Also, the finding that FKBP12, a protein of comparable mass to CaM, binds to a different location than does CaM (Ref. 41Wagenknecht T. Grassucci R. Berkowitz J. Wiederrecht G.J. Xin H.-B. F"

The best characterized component of the DGC, dystrophin, is a 427-kDa rod-shaped protein that binds cytoskeletal actin and is associated with the cytoplasmic face of the membrane (12Ahn A.H. Kunkel L.M. Nat. Genet. 1993; 3: 283-291Crossref PubMed Scopus (568) Google Scholar, 13Rybakova I.N. Amann K.J. Ervasti J.M. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 661-672Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). Loss of dystrophin leads to Duchenne muscular dystrophy, an inevitably fatal wasting of skeletal and cardiac muscle (14Engel A.G. Yamamoto M. Fischbeck K.H. Engel A.G. Franzini-Armstrong C. Myology. McGraw-Hill, Inc., New York1994: 1133-1187Google Scholar). Dystroglycans bind dystrophin intracellularly and laminin extracellularly, thus forming a critical link between the extracellular matrix and the cytoskeleton (15Henry M.D. Campbell K.P. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1996; 8: 625-631Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar). The sarcoglycans are less well characterized, but three lines of evidence suggest that they may also be involved in membrane-matrix interactions. First, mutations in all four sarcoglycan genes have been found in patients with limb-girdle muscular dystrophy (6Bönnemann C.G. Modi R. Noguchi S. Mizuno Y. Yoshida M. Gussoni E. McNally E.M.

Second, treatment of cultured muscle cells with antisense oligonucleotides to α-sarcoglycan inhibits their adhesion to substrata (22Yoshida T. Hanada H. Iwata Y. Pan Y. Sigekawa M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 225: 11-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Third, the laminin isoform composition of muscle fiber basal lamina is altered in patients lacking α-sarcoglycan (23Yamada H. Tomé F.M.S. Higuchi I. Kawai H. Azibi K. Chaouch M. Roberds S.L. Tanaka T. Fujita S. Mitsui T. Fukunaga H. Miyoshi K. Osame M. Fardeau M. Kaplan J.-C. Shimizu T. Campbell K.P. Matsumura K. Lab.

Thus, an attractive hypothesis is that the sarcoglycans and dystroglycans mediate related interactions of muscle cells with basal lamina, both of which are crucial for membrane integrity. Recently, homologues of dystrophin and components of the DGC have been found in numerous nonmuscle tissues. For example, two homologues of dystrophin, utrophin and dystrophin-related protein 2, are expressed at higher levels in some nonmuscle tissues than in muscle (25Blake D.J. Tinsley J.M. Davies K.E. Brain Pathol. 1996; 6: 37-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar, 26Dixon A.K. Tait T.M. Campbell E.A. Bobrow M. Roberts R.G. Freeman T.C. Mol. Biol. 1997; 270: 551-558Crossref Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Moreover, whereas 427-kDa dystrophin is largely confined to muscle, smaller products of the same gene, generated from alternative promoters and by alternative splicing, are widely distributed (12Ahn A.H. Kunkel L.M. Nat. Genet. 1993; 3: 283-291Crossref PubMed Scopus (568) Google Scholar, 27Durbeej M. Jung D. Hjalt T. Campbell K.P. Ekblom P. Dev. Biol. 1997; 181: 156-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Likewise, cytoplasmic proteins associated with the DGC such as dystrobrevin and the syntrophins and transmembrane components such as dystroglycans are present in muscle and nonmuscle tissues alike (28Kramarcy N.R.

Res. 1995; 42: 528-538Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Roles of the DGC in nonmuscle tissues are still largely unexplored, but dystroglycan has been implicated in early embryonic development (32Williamson R.A. Henry M.D. Daniels K.J. Hrstka R.F. Lee J.C.

Fukutaohi H. Fujita S. Endo T. Kobata A. Anderson L.V.B. Kanazawa I. Campbell K.P. Shimizu T. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 13904-13910Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). In contrast to the broad distribution of dystrophins, syntrophins, dystrobrevin, and dystroglycans, the known sarcoglycan genes are all expressed at higher (β) or far higher (α, γ, and δ) levels in muscle than in nonmuscle tissues (5Roberds S.L.

This distribution suggested that the sarcoglycans mediate muscle-specific functions. However, it also seemed possible that nonmuscle cells expressed homologues of sarcoglycans, as noted above for homologues of dystrophin. Such homologues would be of clinical as well as of cell biological interest; forced up-regulation of utrophin is an attractive approach for ameliorating the symptoms of dystrophin deficiency (35Tinsley J.M.

Accordingly, we decided to search for broadly expressed homologues of sarcoglycans. We report here the molecular cloning and characterization of ε-sarcoglycan, a homologue of α-sarcoglycan (adhalin). The rabbit α-sarcoglycan sequence was used to search the data base of expressed sequence tags (ESTs) using the BLAST program (38Altschul S.F. Gish W. Miller W. Myers E.W. Lipman D.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 215: 403-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (68368) Google Scholar) at the National Center for Biotechnology Information. EST 273055 was obtained from Research Genetics (Huntsville, AL) and used to screen an adult mouse lung cDNA library (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). A clone obtained in this way was used to reprobe the same library. For screening, inserts were labeled with [α-32P]dTTP using a random primed labeling kit (Boehringer Mannheim). All sequences were determined from both strands using the dideoxy terminator method and an automated sequencer. Total RNA was prepared by the acid guanidine-phenol procedure (39Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (62909) Google Scholar). Poly(A)+ RNA was isolated by one passage over an oligo(dT)-cellulose column. 10 μg of poly(A)+ RNA was loaded in each lane of an 0.8% agarose gel containing 6.3% formaldehyde and 1 × MOPS buffer (40Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). The gel was blotted onto a nylon membrane and fixed by UV cross-linking. The membrane was probed overnight with the human EST sequence at 42 °C in 35% formamide buffer. The blot was then washed with 1 × SSC/0.1% SDS at room temperature, 45 °C, and 60 °C. An EcoRI fragment of mouse ε-sarcoglycan extending from nucleotides 437 to 1235 (see Fig.1) was subcloned into pET23a (Novagen) and introduced into DE3 bacteria. Cultures were grown until late log stage and then induced with isopropyl thiogalactopyranoside for 1–2 h. Inclusion bodies were isolated by cell lysis and centrifugation, and fusion protein was purified by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Two rabbits were injected with gel slices containing the fusion protein (Animal Pharm Services, Healdsburg, CA). Antibodies were affinity purified from the resulting antisera by adsorption to and elution from fusion protein immobilized on nitrocellulose (40Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T.

The homogenates were centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 45 min. In some experiments, aliquots of the pellet were subjected to deglycosylation with the enzyme PNGase F (New England Biolabs) or were extracted with 1% Triton X-100 and then centrifuged again at 16,000 × g for 15 min. Subsequently, 20-μg aliquots of protein were boiled in SDS-containing buffer with dithiothreitol, separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and electrophoretically transferred from gels to nitrocellulose filters. The filters were blocked with 5% nonfat dry milk/0.5% Tween 20 in Tris-saline and then incubated overnight with either affinity purified rabbit antibody to ε-sarcoglycan or monoclonal antibody NCL-50DAG to α-sarcoglycan (Novocastra, Newcastle-upon-Tyne, UK). Blots were then incubated for 1 h with appropriate alkaline-phosphatase-conjugated secondary antibodies and stained with 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indoyl phosphate and nitro blue tetrazolium (Sigma-Aldrich). Tissues from adult rats and mice and whole embryonic day (E) 13.5 mice were frozen in liquid nitrogen-cooled isopentane and sectioned at 8–12 μm in a cryostat. Sections were incubated successively with 1% bovine serum albumin in phosphate-buffered saline; a mixture of affinity purified rabbit anti-ε-sarcoglycan and mouse anti-α-sarcoglycan antibodies (see above) in bovine serum albumin/phosphate-buffered saline; and a mixture of fluorescein-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (Boehringer Mannheim) and rhodamine-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (Cappel). Sections were mounted in glycerol with p-phenylenediamine and viewed with fluorescein- and rhodamine-selective filters. Staining by anti-ε-sarcoglycan was abolished by preincubation of antibody with fusion protein. We searched public data bases for sequences related to sarcoglycans and identified one such human EST. This cDNA was obtained and sequenced, revealing an insert of 730 base pairs containing an open reading frame (ORF) of 145 aa, a putative 3′-untranslated region, and a polyadenylyl tail. The ORF was 51% identical to the carboxyl-terminal region of human α-sarcoglycan (Fig. 1 A). We call the predicted novel protein ε-sarcoglycan. Northern analysis provided evidence for the existence of a related mRNA in several adult mouse tissues, including lung (see below). We therefore screened a mouse lung cDNA library with the EST to identify murine orthologues of the human gene. Clones were used to reprobe the same library until overlapping clones extending 1524 nucleotides were obtained (Fig. 1 B). DNA sequencing revealed an ORF of 405 amino acids, extending from a candidate initiator methionine (41Kozak M. Cell. 1986; 44: 283-292Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3556) Google Scholar) that corresponds in position to the translation initiation sites in mouse, rabbit, hamster, and human α-sarcoglycan (Fig. 1 C). Comparison of the mouse ε-sarcoglycan sequence to the partial sequence obtained from the human EST shows that this protein exhibits 95% identity between the species. This homology is similar to that between human and mouse α-sarcoglycan (88% identity over the full length; Ref. 11Liu L. Vachon P.H. Kuang W. Xu H. Wewer U.M. Kylsten P. Engvall E. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 235: 227-235Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). The mouse ε-sarcoglycan protein is predicted to begin with a 22-aa signal sequence (42von Heijne G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1986; 14: 4683-4690Crossref PubMed Scopus (3685) Google Scholar), followed by a 262-aa extracellular domain, a single 23-aa hydrophobic transmembrane domain, and a 98-aa intracellular domain (Fig. 1 A). The predicted molecular mass of the mature protein is 43.5 kDa. The extracellular domain bears a single consensus sequence for N-glycosylation. The intracellular domain contains three consensus sites for phosphorylation, one each for casein kinase II, protein kinase C, and both. Mouse α- and ε-sarcoglycans are 44% identical (62% similar) at the amino acid level. Homology extends over the whole length of the molecules, with particularly conserved regions both extracellularly (21 of 24 consecutive residues at aa 168–191) and extending through the transmembrane domain (31 of 43 consecutive residues at aa 283–325). The potential site for N-glycosylation in ε-sarcoglycan corresponds to one of two such sites in α-sarcoglycan, and the spacing of four extracellular cysteines is perfectly conserved between the homologues (Fig. 1 C). No additional relatives of α- or ε-sarcoglycan were found in public data bases. Although α, β, γ, and δ sarcoglycans are all glycosylated transmembrane proteins with a long extracellular domain, a short intracellular domain, and a single transmembrane domain, α-sarcoglycan shows no significant sequence homology to β, γ, or δ sarcoglycans. It is therefore not unexpected that ε also exhibits no homology to β, γ, or δ sarcoglycans. As a first step in examining the expression of ε-sarcoglycan, we performed Northern analysis. A single mRNA of ∼1.8 kilobases was identified in all tissues examined (Fig. 2 A). Levels were highest in lung, moderate in brain, heart, and skeletal muscle, and low but detectable in kidney and liver. We also detected ε-sarcoglycan mRNA in E14 embryos (Fig. 2 A). The sizes of α- and ε-sarcoglycan mRNAs are similar, but their distributions differ markedly: α is largely restricted to striated (cardiac and skeletal) muscle, with very low levels of expression in lung and none in brain (5Roberds S.L. Anderson R.D. Ibraghimov B.O. Campbell K.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 23739-23742Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 11Liu L. Vachon P.H. Kuang W. Xu H. Wewer U.M. Kylsten P. Engvall E.

To obtain reagents for studying the ε-sarcoglycan protein, a recombinant extracellular fragment was used to generate rabbit antisera, and antibodies were purified using immobilized immunogen. Each of the two independently generated antisera recognized a major band of ∼45 kDa on Western blots (Fig. 2 B and data not shown). A single major immunoreactive species was observed in heart, skeletal muscle, lung, liver, and kidney. In brain, two higher molecular masses bands, of ∼47 and 48 kDa were also visible. The distribution of the protein paralleled that of ε-sarcoglycan mRNA, being highest in lung and lowest in kidney and liver (Fig. 2,A and B). The homology between α- and ε-sarcoglycans raised the possibility that antibodies to either protein might recognize both. To assess this possibility, we probed extracts of heart (which contains both α and ε) and lung (which contains only ε) with our antibodies to ε-sarcoglycan and a commercially available monoclonal antibody to α-sarcoglycan. In heart, anti-α-sarcoglycan stained a band ∼2 kDa larger than that recognized by anti-ε-sarcoglycan (Fig.2 C, four left-hand lanes). In lung, anti-α-sarcoglycan detected no protein (Fig. 2 C, two right-hand lanes). Thus, the antibodies to recombinant ε-sarcoglycan and a widely used monoclonal antibody to α-sarcoglycan are not detectably cross-reactive. α-Sarcoglycan is membrane-associated and glycosylated. We asked whether the same was true for ε-sarcoglycan. ε-Sarcoglycan from heart (Fig.3 A) and skeletal muscle (data not shown) were insoluble in saline but were solubilized by treatment with Triton X-100 detergent. Thus, ε-sarcoglycan is membrane-associated. To assess glycosylation, tissue homogenates from lung, brain, kidney, and heart were treated with endoglycosidase F and then analyzed by electrophoresis and immunoblotting. Enzymatic digestion decreased the apparent molecular mass of ε-sarcoglycan by ∼1–2 kDa (Fig.3 B and data not shown). Similar treatment of α-sarcoglycan has been reported to shift its apparent molecular mass by ∼4 kDa (43Ervasti J.M. Campbell K.P. Cell. 1991; 66: 1121-1131Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1095) Google Scholar). This difference is consistent with the presence of two sites for N-linked glycosylation on α-sarcoglycan but only one on ε-sarcoglycan. Differential glycosylation also provides an explanation for the initially paradoxical observation that the apparent molecular mass of α-sarcoglycan is ∼2 kDa larger than that of ε-sarcoglycan, whereas the predicted molecular mass of ε-sarcoglycan is ∼2 kDa larger than that of α-sarcoglycan. We used a double label immunofluorescence technique to compare the distributions of α- and ε-sarcoglycan in skeletal muscle. As previously reported (44Tome F.M. Matsumura K. Chevallay M. Campbell K.P. Fardeau M. Neuromusc. Disorders. 1994; 4: 343-348Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar,45Mora M. Blasi C.D. Barresi R. Morandi L. Brambati B. Jarre L. Cornelio F. Dev. Brain Res. 1996; 91: 70-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar), α-sarcoglycan was associated with skeletal muscle fibers but was absent from other intramuscular cells (Fig.4 A′). In contrast, ε-sarcoglycan was present at higher levels in blood vessels and nerves than in muscle fibers (Fig. 4 A). In intramuscular nerves, ε-sarcoglycan was present both in the endoneurium (Schwann cells that ensheath axons) and in the perineurium (fibroblast-derived cells that ensheath bundles of axon-Schwann cell units; Fig.4 C). Examination at higher power showed that much of the sarcolemma-associated ε-like immunoreactivity was in fact associated with capillaries, whereas α-like immunoreactivity was confined to the sarcolemma (Fig. 4, B and B′). There was, however, also clear ε immunoreactivity associated with muscle fiber surfaces. Consistent with this result, we have detected ε-sarcoglycan in cultures of a clonal muscle cell line by immunoblotting (data not shown). ε-Sarcoglycan immunoreactivity was also widely distributed in nonmuscle tissues. In lung, the protein was associated with both alveoli and bronchioles (Fig. 4 D). In kidney, immunoreactivity was particularly intense in glomerular mesangium (Fig.4 E). Sections of brain, heart, thymus, and intestine were also examined, and in each case large subsets of membranes were ε-sarcoglycan-positive (data not shown). Of these tissues, α-sarcoglycan was detectable only in heart by the immunofluorescence method we used. Thus, consistent with results from Northern and immunoblotting analyses, ε-sarcoglycan is far more broadly distributed than is α-sarcoglycan. To assess the distribution of ε-sarcoglycan during development, sections of E13.5 embryos were double-labeled with antibodies to α- and ε-sarcoglycan. No α-sarcoglycan was detectable in embryos at this stage (data not shown), consistent with previous reports that this protein appears at a relatively late stage of myogenesis (11Liu L. Vachon P.H.

In contrast, ε-sarcoglycan was present in blood vessels throughout the body and in heart, intestine, meninges of spinal cord and brain (Fig. 4 F), dorsal root ganglia (Fig. 4 F), and developing kidney (Fig. 4 G). Thus, in embryos, ε-sarcoglycan is expressed both earlier and more widely than α-sarcoglycan. Previously described sarcoglycans, which underlie limb-girdle muscular dystrophy types 2C-F, are predominantly or exclusively expressed in striated muscle. In contrast, ε-sarcoglycan is widely expressed in both muscle and nonmuscle cells, and in embryos as well as adults. These results provide the first suggestion that sarcoglycans, like other components of the DGC (15Henry M.D. Campbell K.P. Curr. Opin.

Critical questions, which we are now addressing, are whether ε-sarcoglycan is physically associated with other DGC components; whether homologues of β, γ, or δ sarcoglycan exist; and whether levels of ε-sarcoglycan are altered in any muscular dystrophies. Currently, there is considerable interest in the possibility that up-regulation of utrophin, the broadly distributed homologue of dystrophin, is a better therapeutic approach to Duchenne muscular dystrophy than replacement of the mutant gene (35Tinsley J.M.

The fact that ε-sarcoglycan, like utrophin, is normally expressed at low levels in skeletal muscle favors the possibility that further up-regulation would be feasible. In this context, it is interesting that cardiac involvement is common in dystrophinopathies (Duchenne and Becker dystrophy) but uncommon in the sarcoglycanopathies (limb-girdle muscular dystrophy 2C-2F; Ref. 46Cox G.F. Kunkel L.M. Curr. Opin. Cardiol. 1997; 12: 329-343Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). One intriguing possibility is that the levels of ε-sarcoglycan in cardiac muscle, which are higher than those in skeletal muscle, ameliorate the effects of sarcoglycan mutations on the heart. If so, further up-regulation might confer a similar benefit to skeletal muscle."

Biochem. Soc. Trans. 1996; 24: 234-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Like the yeast proteins, mTOR has a COOH-terminal catalytic domain that is homologous to those found in yeast and mammalian phosphatidylinositol 3-OH kinases, although none of the TOR proteins have been shown to possess intrinsic lipid kinase activity (5Abraham R.T. Wiederrecht G.J. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1996; 14: 483-510Crossref PubMed Scopus (575) Google Scholar). The function of mTOR is inhibited by incubating cells with rapamycin, a potent immunosuppressant and antiproliferative agent (5Abraham R.T. Wiederrecht G.J. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1996; 14: 483-510Crossref PubMed Scopus (575) Google Scholar). FKBP12, an M r = 12,000 member of a family of FK506-binding proteins, is the intracellular receptor for rapamycin and is required for the inhibitory effect of rapamycin on mTOR function. The rapamycin·FKBP12 complex binds with very high affinity to mTOR, a property that has proven useful for purifying the protein. The FK506·FKBP12 complex does not bind mTOR, and FK506 competitively inhibits the effects of rapamycin that are mediated by mTOR. PHAS-I (6Hu C. Pang S. Kong X. Velleca M. Lawrence Jr., J.C. Proc.

Immunoprecipitates containing mTOR from rat brain were recently found to phosphorylate PHAS-I in vitro (9Brunn G.J. Hudson C.C. Sekulic A. Williams J.M. Hosoi H. Houghton P. Lawrence Jr, J.C.

The kinase reaction proceeded much more rapidly with Mn:ATP than with Mg:ATP, occurred on both Ser and Thr residues, and markedly decreased the eIF4E binding activity of PHAS-I. In this report, we describe an antibody that activates mTOR and identify the sites in PHAS-I that are phosphorylated by mTOR. These results provide important insight into both the substrate specificity of mTOR and mechanisms by which the kinase might be regulated.

Antibodies, designated mTAb1 and mTAb2, respectively, were purified by using columns containing affinity resins prepared by coupling peptides to Sulfolink beads (Pierce). Rat brains were rinsed and homogenized (1 g of tissue/ml of buffer) by using a Polytron tissue disrupter (setting of 4 for 10 s, then setting of 8 for 10 s).

To purify mTOR, GST-FKBP12 (100 μg) was incubated with 25 μl glutathione-agarose (Sigma) in Tris-buffered saline (100 mm NaCl and 50 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.4). After 1 h at 21 °C, the resin was washed 3 times (1 ml/wash) with Tris-buffered saline, then suspended in homogenization buffer, and incubated (1 ml final volume) at 4 °C with extract (3 mg of protein), 200 nmmicrocystin-LR, and 10 μm rapamycin (Calbiochem). Control incubations were conducted with FK506 (Fujisawa Pharmaceuticals). After 1 h the beads were washed twice (1 ml/wash) with solution A plus 1 mm dithiothreitol, then washed twice with solution B (50 mm NaCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 10 mm Na-HEPES, pH 7.4). For immunoprecipitations, antibodies (5 μg) were incubated at 21 °C with protein A-agarose (15 μl of beads) in 1 ml Tris-buffered saline plus 0.1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin. After 1 h the beads were washed three times with Tris-buffered saline, then suspended in homogenization buffer and incubated (1 ml final volume) for 1 h at 4 °C with extract (3 mg of protein) and 200 nm microcystin-LR. The beads were washed twice with solution A plus 1 mm dithiothreitol and twice with solution B. Beads with immunoprecipitated or affinity-purified mTOR were suspended in 50 μl of a reaction mixture that contained solution B plus 200 nm microcystin-LR, 10 mm MnCl2, 100 μm[γ-32P]ATP (10 μCi) (NEN Life Science Products), 1 μg [His6]PHAS-I, and 50 mmβ-glycerophosphate, pH 7.4. The reactions were terminated by adding 5 μl of 0.2 m EDTA to each sample. Recombinant MAP kinase (ERK-2 isoform) was activated by incubation with recombinant MAP kinase kinase as described previously (19Fadden P. Haystead T.A.J. Lawrence Jr., J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 10240-10247Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). [His6]PHAS-I (20 μg/ml) was incubated at 30 °C in a solution (50 μl) containing activated MAP kinase (2 μg/ml), 1 mm dithiothreitol, 10 mm MgCl2, 100 μm [γ-32P]ATP, and 10 mmNa-HEPES, pH 7.4. The reaction was terminated by adding 5 μl of 0.2m EDTA to each sample. Samples were subjected to SDS-PAGE by using the method of Laemmli (22Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207538) Google Scholar). 32P-Labeled [His6]PHAS-I was detected by autoradiography after drying the gels, and the amount of 32P was determined by scintillation counting of gel slices containing the protein. mTOR (9Brunn G.J. Hudson C.C. Sekulic A. Williams J.M. Hosoi H. Houghton P. Lawrence Jr, J.C. Abraham R.T. Science. 1997; 277: 99-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (814) Google Scholar) and PHAS-I (12Lin T.-A. Kong X. Haystead T.A.J. Pause A. Belsham G. Sonenberg N. Lawrence Jr., J.C. Science. 1994; 266: 653-656Crossref PubMed Scopus (602) Google Scholar) were detected by immunoblotting as described previously. [His6]PHAS-I was phosphorylated with mTOR that had been immunoprecipitated using mTAb1 as described above. Samples of the phosphorylated protein were digested with lysyl endopeptidase C (WAKO Pure Chemical Industries) and chymotrypsin (Boehringer Mannheim), and phosphopeptides were resolved by reverse phase high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) as described previously (19Fadden P. Haystead T.A.J. Lawrence Jr., J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 10240-10247Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). The positions of the phosphorylated residues in the peptides were determined by the cycles in which 32P was released when the peptides were subjected to sequential Edman degradation (23Russo G.L. Vandenberg M.T. Yu I.J. Bae Y.-S. Franza Jr., B.R. Marshak D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 20317-20325Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). mTOR was readily detected by immunoblotting after subjecting samples of rat brain extracts to SDS-PAGE (Fig. 1). The apparent M r of the mTOR estimated by SDS-PAGE was 240,000, which is similar to the M r of 289,000 predicted from the nucleotide sequence of the mTOR cDNA. The protein was recognized by either of the antibodies, mTAb1 and mTAb2, which were directed against two different regions of the mTOR molecule. As expected, the antibodies recognized mTOR that had been affinity-purified using rapamycin/FKBP12. No mTOR was detected if the affinity-purification procedures were conducted in an identical manner except using FK506·FKBP12, which does not bind mTOR. mTOR could be immunoprecipitated using either mTAb1 or mTAb2. In this case, the recoveries of mTOR were blocked by the respective antigenic peptides supporting the specificity of the antibodies. When incubated in a reaction mixture containing Mn2+ and [γ-32P]ATP, [His6]PHAS-I was phosphorylated by mTOR that had been immunoprecipitated with either mTAb1 or mTAb2. The rate of phosphorylation was much higher with mTAb1 than with mTAb2. mTAb1 was somewhat more efficient in immunoprecipitating mTOR than mTAb2 (Fig. 1); however, the higher rate of kinase activity could not be explained by the larger amount of mTOR present in the mTAb1 immunoprecipitates. To investigate the possible stimulatory effect of mTAb1, mTOR was immunoprecipitated with mTAb2, then incubated with mTAb1 before assessing kinase activity (Fig. 2). Under these conditions, the rate of phosphorylation of PHAS-I was increased approximately 3-fold by mTAb1. In contrast, adding mTAb2 to mTOR that had been immunoprecipitated with mTAb1 decreased the rate of incorporation of 32P into PHAS-I by approximately 50%. Previous studies demonstrated that mTOR autophosphorylation, although markedly diminished, still occurred when the protein was bound to rapamycin/FKBP12, indicating that rapamycin/FKBP12 does not fully inhibit mTOR (24Brunn G.J. Williams J. Sabers C. Wiederrecht G. Lawrence Jr., J.C. Abraham R.T. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 5256-5267Crossref PubMed Scopus (626) Google Scholar). When purified by rapamycin/FKBP12 affinity chromatography, mTOR phosphorylated PHAS-I at a relatively slow rate. Adding mTAb1 increased the PHAS-I kinase of the affinity-purified mTOR by approximately 10-fold (Fig. 2). The effects of mTAb1 on both mTAb2-immunoprecipitated mTOR and the affinity-purified protein supports the conclusion that mTAb1 binding activates the mTOR kinase. A working hypothesis is that the COOH-terminal region of mTOR functions to inhibit the kinase domain. mTAb1 presumably acts by promoting a conformational change that releases the inhibition thereby activating the mTOR protein kinase. It is interesting to speculate that the activity of mTOR might be regulated by hormones and growth factors through modification of the COOH-terminal region. PHAS-I could be stoichiometrically phosphorylated when incubated with mTAb1 activated by mTOR (Fig. 3). Based on the staining intensities of the mTOR band relative to that of a known standard (bovine serum albumin) on silver stained polyacrylamide gels, we estimate that an mTOR immunoprecipitate from 3 mg of brain extract protein contained approximately 0.05 μg of mTOR protein (data not shown). This amount of mTOR phosphorylated PHAS-I at a rate comparable to that of 0.1 μg recombinant MAP kinase, which is by far the best of the kinases that have been reported to phosphorylate PHAS-Iin vitro (21Haystead T.A.J. Haystead C.M.M. Hu C. Lin T.-A. Lawrence Jr., J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 23185-23191Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The sensitivity of mTOR and MAP kinase to wortmannin and rapamycin/FKBP12 were distinctly different (Fig. 3). PHAS-I phosphorylation by mTOR was abolished by 1 μmwortmannin, and the activity was markedly decreased by rapamycin/FKBP12. These agents had little if any effect on PHAS-I phosphorylation by MAP kinase. To investigate the specificity of mTOR, the sites in PHAS-I phosphorylated by mTOR were identified. [His6]PHAS-I was phosphorylated using [γ-32P]ATP and either mTAb1-activated mTOR or recombinant MAP kinase. The 32P-labeled proteins were then digested with lysyl endopeptidase, and phosphopeptides were resolved by reverse phase HPLC (Fig. 4). mTOR phosphorylated sites that were recovered in phosphopeptides that eluted in peaks found in the same positions as LE-P1, LE-P2, LE-P3, and LE-P4, the four peaks previously characterized in analyses of PHAS-I phosphorylation by MAP kinase (19Fadden P. Haystead T.A.J. Lawrence Jr., J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 10240-10247Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). LE-P1, LE-P2, and LE-P3 contain peptides in which Thr69, Ser64, and Ser82, respectively, are phosphorylated (19Fadden P. Haystead T.A.J. Lawrence Jr., J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 10240-10247Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). LE-P4 contains both Thr36 and Thr45. These sites may be resolved by digesting LE-P4 with chymotrypsin, which generates peptides that elute in two peaks, designated CT-P1 and CT-P2 (19Fadden P. Haystead T.A.J. Lawrence Jr., J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 10240-10247Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar), containing Thr45 and Thr36, respectively. Digesting the pooled LE-P4 fractions from mTOR-phosphorylated [His6]PHAS-I with chymotrypsin-generated32P-labeled peptides that eluted from the reverse phase column in precisely the same positions as CT-P1 and CT-P2 (Fig. 4). The finding that phosphopeptides derived from the mTOR-phosphorylated sample eluted identically from the reverse phase column as those from the MAP kinase-phosphorylated protein suggested that mTOR phosphorylated the same sites as MAP kinase. However, because the peptides contain multiple Ser/Thr residues, it was necessary to determine the position of the phosphorylated residue in each peptide to confirm the site assignment. Subjecting LE-P1, LE-P2, LE-P3, CT-P1, and CT-P2 from mTOR-phosphorylated samples to sequential Edman degradation resulted in release of 32P in cycles 1, 8, 10, 3, and 3, indicative of phosphorylation of Thr69, Ser64, Ser82, Thr45, and Thr36, respectively (Fig. 5). Although it facilitated the phosphorylation site analyses, the finding that mTOR phosphorylated the same sites in PHAS-I as MAP kinase was unexpected in view of the dissimilar catalytic domains of the two enzymes (25Zakian V.A.

An initial concern was that the PHAS-I phosphorylation observed with mTOR immunoprecipitates might be due to contamination with MAP kinase. Both biochemical and pharmacological evidence indicate that this was not the case. mTOR phosphorylated Thr69 much more rapidly than this site was phosphorylated by MAP kinase (19Fadden P. Haystead T.A.J. Lawrence Jr., J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 10240-10247Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation by mTOR was markedly inhibited by rapamycin/FKBP12, which was without effect on the phosphorylation of PHAS-I by MAP kinase (Fig. 3); and, wortmannin, which binds and covalently modifies mTOR, abolished phosphorylation by mTOR but not phosphorylation by MAP kinase (Fig. 3). Moreover, the finding that the PHAS-I kinase associated with affinity-purified mTOR was increased by mTAb1 (Fig. 2) provides strong evidence that PHAS-I phosphorylation is mediated by mTOR itself. The similarity of the kinetics and stoichiometry of phosphorylation of PHAS-I by mTOR and MAP kinase was also unexpected, although subtle but potentially important differences in the activities of these enzymes toward PHAS-I are apparent. Comparing the phosphate incorporated into a single phosphorylation site relative to the total phosphate in all of the sites, mTOR reproducibly phosphorylated Thr69 more rapidly than did MAP kinase (Fig. 4 and Ref. 19Fadden P. Haystead T.A.J. Lawrence Jr., J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 10240-10247Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). Additionally, the stoichiometry of phosphorylation of PHAS-I by either enzyme appears to plateau at just over 1 mol of phosphate/mol of PHAS-I (Fig. 3) indicating that mono-phosphorylated PHAS-I may not be a preferred substrate for further phosphorylation. Taken together these findings indicate that relative site preferences of PHAS-I kinase(s) may play a role in regulating PHAS-I function. It will be interesting to determine the relative role each phosphorylation site or combination of sites plays in determining the affinity of PHAS-I for eIF4E. All of the sites phosphorylated by mTOR conform to a (Ser/Thr)-Pro motif. An implication is that Pro on the COOH-terminal side of a Ser/Thr residue might be an important determinant in the specificity of mTOR. The sites phosphorylated by mTOR in vitro are phosphorylated in response to insulin in adipocytes (19Fadden P. Haystead T.A.J. Lawrence Jr., J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 10240-10247Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar), and their phosphorylation markedly decreases the ability of PHAS-I to bind to eIF4E (9Brunn G.J. Hudson C.C. Sekulic A. Williams J.M. Hosoi H. Houghton P. Lawrence Jr, J.C. Abraham R.T. Science. 1997; 277: 99-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (814) Google Scholar). Moreover, treating adipocytes with rapamycin has been shown to decrease phosphorylation of the sites. These findings support the conclusion that the sites in PHAS-I phosphorylated by mTOR are physiologically relevant and that mTOR contributes to the phosphorylation of PHAS-I in cells."

Here we show that serum starvation increases E-cadherin expression and induces E-cadherin-dependent adhesion in the MDA-MB-468 breast cancer cell line. This adhesion occurred despite a lack of α-catenin expression, which was caused by mutations in the α-catenin gene. Coprecipitation analysis suggests that this adhesion may be mediated by cytoplasmic connections from cadherins to the cytoskeleton involving vinculin. A high level of vinculin associated with E-cadherin immunoprecipitates was observed in MDA-MB-468 cells. In contrast, vinculin was not detected in E-cadherin complexes in the A431 and MCF-7 epithelial carcinoma cell lines, which express α-catenin. However, in reciprocal immunoprecipitations using anti-vinculin antibodies, E-cadherin associated strongly with vinculin in MDA-MB-468 cells and, to a lesser extent, in A431 and MCF-7 cells. These results suggest that both α-catenin and vinculin may be present in the adhesion complex. To test the hypothesis that vinculin associates with E-cadherin complexes via β-catenin, excess recombinant β-catenin or α-catenin fusion protein was added to MDA-MB-468 cell lysates. Both specifically inhibited the coprecipitation of E-cadherin with vinculin, suggesting competition for the same binding site. These results suggest that vinculin plays a role in the establishment or regulation of the cadherin-based cell adhesion complex by direct interaction with β-catenin.

These results suggest that vinculin plays a role in the establishment or regulation of the cadherin-based cell adhesion complex by direct interaction with β-catenin. Cadherins are calcium-dependent cell-cell adhesion molecules that mediate homotypic interactions among cells and are essential for tissue morphogenesis (for review, see Refs. 1Takeichi M.

Adhesion via cadherins involves the coordination of extracellular binding and intracellular anchorage to the actin-based cytoskeleton. The cytoplasmic domain of E-cadherin binds to either β-catenin or plakoglobin/γ-catenin (for review, see Refs. 3Gumbiner B.

U. S. A. 1995; 92: 8813-8817Crossref PubMed Scopus (637) Google Scholar). There is evidence that α-catenin also binds to α-actinin (8Knudsen K.A. Soler A.P. Johnson K.R. Wheelock M.J. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 130: 67-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (564) Google Scholar, 9Nieset J.E. Redfield A.R. Jin F. Knudsen K.A. Johnson K.R. Wheelock M.J. J.

Cell. 1996; 7 (abstr.): 285Google Scholar), but the role of these interactions in adhesion is unknown. Disruption of α-catenin function by genetic deletion or mutation was shown to cause a loss of E-cadherin-dependent adhesion. PC-9 lung carcinoma cells, which lack detectable α-catenin expression, were shown to have aberrant cell-cell adhesion (11Shimoyama Y. Nagafuchi A. Fujita S. Gotoh S. Takeichi M. Tsukita S. Hirohashi S. Cancer Res. 1992; 52: 5770-5774PubMed Google Scholar) that was restored by transfection of these cells with α-catenin cDNA (12Hirano S. Kimoto N. Shimoyama Y. Hirohashi S. Takeichi M. Cell. 1992; 70: 293-301Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (479) Google Scholar). This resulted in the establishment of a polarized epithelium and inhibition of cell growth (13Watabe M. Nagafuchi A. Tsukita S. Takeichi M. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 127: 247-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (364) Google Scholar). This and other work suggest that the linkage of cadherin complexes to the cytoskeleton via α-catenin is essential for normal cell adhesion, morphogenesis, and cell growth. α-Catenin shares sequence homology with vinculin (14Nagafuchi A.

Mangeat P. Nature. 1984; 308: 744-746Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar) and to itself (26Bendori R. Salomon D. Geiger B. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 108: 2383-2393Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 27Johnson R.P. Craig S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 12611-12619Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 28Johnson P. Craig S. Nature. 1995; 373: 261-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar). Other than its well defined role in mediating the cytoplasmic anchorage of integrins, the role of vinculin in cell-cell adhesion is not clear. Except for its localization to adherens junctions, no evidence exists for its association with cadherins (17Geiger B. Ginsberg D. Cell Motil. Cytoskeleton. 1991; 20: 1-6Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). In this study, the use of cell lines deficient in α-catenin provided a good experimental system to study the role of vinculin in adherens junctions and to determine whether this protein plays a role in cadherin-based adhesion. We use the breast cancer cell line MDA-MB-468. We define two mutations in the mRNA for α-catenin in these cells that result in a lack of detectable α-catenin protein expression. Similarly to other α-catenin-deficient cell lines, MDA-MB-468 cells display a lack of cadherin-mediated adhesion under normal growth conditions. However, under serum starvation conditions, E-cadherin expression is up-regulated, and E-cadherin-dependent cell aggregation occurs. Examination of the cytoplasmic components of the adhesion complex reveals that both vinculin and α-catenin are associated with E-cadherin complexes in cell lines expressing both proteins. However, the association of vinculin with E-cadherin in MDA-MB-468 cells, lacking α-catenin expression, is dramatically increased. Moreover, we show that this interaction may be mediated by β-catenin and can be dissociated by the addition of α-catenin fusion protein. These results suggest that vinculin may function in place of α-catenin in cell-cell adhesion, therefore enabling the assembly of a functional adhesion complex. The cancer cell lines MDA-MB-468, MCF-7, BT-549, MDA-MB-157, Caco2, PC-9, and A431 were all obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (Rockville, MD). Cells were routinely cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's/F-12 medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Life Technologies, Inc.) at 37 °C in a humidified 5% CO2 atmosphere. Monoclonal anti-human E-cadherin and P-cadherin antibodies were acquired from Zymed Laboratories, Inc. (South San Francisco, CA). Monoclonal anti-α-catenin antibodies (α3H4, α3C1, 5B11, α10E1, and TLα1) were made as described (29Buillons L.C. Notterman D.A. Chung L.S. Levine A.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 4501-4508Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 30Roe S. Koslov E.R. Rimm D.L. Cell Adhesion Commun. 1997; (in press)Google Scholar), except for TLα1, which was purchased from Transduction Laboratories (Lexington, KY). Rabbit polyclonal anti-α-catenin antibodies were raised against a synthetic peptide (residues 890–906) within the carboxyl terminus of mouse α-catenin (31Funayama N. Fagotto F. McCrea P. Gumbiner B.M. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 128: 959-968Crossref PubMed Scopus (500) Google Scholar). Monoclonal antibodies to β-, γ-catenin and p120 were obtained from Transduction Laboratories. Rabbit polyclonal anti-actin antibodies, anti-vinculin mouse ascites used for immunoblotting, anti-α-actinin mouse ascites, and monoclonal antibodies to N-cadherin (A-CAM) were purchased from Sigma. Monoclonal antibodies to vinculin used for immunoprecipitation were purchased from Upstate Biotechnology, Inc. (Lake Placid, NY). Rabbit anti-EGF 1The abbreviations used are: EGF, epidermal growth factor; RT-PCR, reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction; GST, glutathione S-transferase. receptor antiserum was a gift from Dr. Joseph Schlessinger (New York University, New York). Primers used for PCR and sequencing are as described (30Roe S. Koslov E.R. Rimm D.L. Cell Adhesion Commun. 1997; (in press)Google Scholar). Total RNA was isolated from cell lines using the Trizol LS reagent (Life Technologies, Inc.). Subsequently, cDNA was synthesized from 3 μg of RNA using 2 μm oligo(dT) primer oligo(dT)12–18 (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.) and 200 units of Superscript II reverse transcriptase (Life Technologies, Inc.) in reverse transcriptase buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.3, 75 mm KCl, and 3 mm MgCl2) containing 0.01 m dithiothreitol and 10 mm dNTPs. The reverse transcriptase reaction was incubated at 42 °C for 1 h. α-Catenin cDNA was amplified using the designated primers. The PCR products resulting from amplification of the MDA-MB-468 α-catenin cDNA using primer pairs A/D and B/D (see Fig. 2) were ligated into the PCR II vector of the TA cloning kit (Invitrogen, La Jolla, CA). These PCR fragments containing the deleted regions were sequenced using primers A, B, and D (see Fig. 2) with Taq DNA polymerase and fluorescently labeled dideoxynucleotides in a thermal cycling protocol. Total RNA was prepared from cell lines using the Trizol reagent according to the protocol on the package insert (32Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (63232) Google Scholar). 10 μg of total RNA was loaded in each lane as determined by absorbance at 260 nm. Total RNA was resolved on 1% formaldehyde-agarose gel and capillary-blotted to Duralon UV membrane (Stratagene) (33Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). After UV cross-linking, the membranes were hybridized in Rapid-Hyb™ buffer (Amersham Corp.) for 1.5–2.5 h with a fluorescently labeled N-terminal half of the α-catenin cDNA. Washes were done at high stringency (0.1 × SSC at 65 °C) for 20–30 min. The filters were then processed for the Illuminator™ nonradioactive detection system (Stratagene). Cells were extracted in lysis buffer (1% Triton X-100, 10% glycerol, 50 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 2 mm EGTA, 2 mmMgCl2, and 1 mm dithiothreitol) with protease inhibitors (10 μg/ml each aprotinin and leupeptin, 5 μg/ml pepstatin, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). 30 μg of proteins from each indicated extract, as determined by the Bradford method (Bio-Rad), was boiled in SDS sample buffer for 10 min and loaded onto a 7.5% polyacrylamide minigel (Bio-Rad). Proteins were transferred onto Immobilon membranes (Millipore Corp.), which were subsequently blocked in 3% bovine serum albumin/phosphate-buffered saline and incubated for 2 h at 25 °C with 1:1000 dilutions of all mentioned antibodies. After washes, membranes were probed with a 1:5000 dilution of secondary antibodies coupled to horseradish peroxidase for 1 h at 25 °C and developed with enhanced chemiluminescence reagents (ECL, Amersham Corp.). Cell lysates (7 mg) were incubated either with 10 μg of antibodies to E-cadherin or with 30 μg of anti-vinculin antibodies for 2 h at 4 °C and supplemented for an additional hour with 3 mg of protein A-Sepharose. The beads were washed with lysis buffer, and the bound proteins were eluted by boiling the beads in sample buffer for 10 min. Transferred proteins were blotted with the designated antibodies at a 1:1000 dilution and processed as described above. Confluent cell monolayers were incubated for 36 h in fresh medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum (serum-treated) or 0% fetal bovine serum (serum-starved). Cell monolayers were subsequently incubated in 0.02% crystallized trypsin (Worthington) and 10 mm CaCl2 in Hanks' balanced saline solution (Life Technologies, Inc.) for 5 min at 37 °C and made into single cell suspensions by trituration with a Pasteur pipette. Cells were washed twice in Hanks' balanced saline solution and incubated at 3 × 105 cells/well in 500 μl of Hanks' balanced saline solution containing 1% bovine serum albumin and 100 μg/ml DNase (Worthington) with or without 1 mm CaCl2 in the presence or absence of 80 μg/ml antibodies to E-cadherin, P-cadherin, or N-cadherin. Aggregation assays were performed at 37 °C at 100 rpm for 20 min in triplicate wells on in 24-well non-tissue culture-treated plates (No. 1147; Becton Dickinson Labware, Franklin Lakes, NJ). Assays were stopped at 0 and 20 min by fixing the cells in 1% glutaraldehyde. The extent of cell-cell binding was monitored by measuring the disappearance of single cells using a Coulter counter. Glutathione S-transferase (GST)-α-catenin and GST-β-catenin fusion proteins as well as GST alone and GST-spectrin fusion proteins used as controls were prepared as described (53Koslov E.R. Maupin P. Pradhan D. Morrow J.S. Rimm D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 27301-27306Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). The GST fusion proteins were isolated by affinity chromatography on glutathione-agarose (Sigma) and eluted with 5 mm glutathione in 10 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, and 1 mm dithiothreitol, followed by dialysis in glutathione-free buffer. Protein concentration was determined (the Bradford method), and the identity of the eluted proteins was controlled by immunoblotting (data not shown). Increasing concentrations of α-catenin or β-catenin fusion protein (ranging from 10 to 80 μg/ml) were premixed with 2.5 mg of serum-starved MDA-MB-468 cell lysate for 2 h at 4 °C. Control GST and GST-spectrin were added at 80 μg/ml. Lysates were subjected to immunoprecipitation with anti-vinculin antibodies as described above and were further analyzed by immunoblotting using anti-E-cadherin antibodies, followed by ECL detection. MDA-MB-468 cells lack detectable α-catenin protein expression as demonstrated by the absence of reactivity either with a mixture of five monoclonal antibodies that map to different sites within the α-catenin molecule (Fig. 1 A, lane 2) or with a polyclonal antibody to a peptide near the carboxyl terminus of α-catenin (lane 5). The lack of antibody reactivity for α-catenin with MDA-MB-468 cell lysates was compared with the antibody reactivity with lysates of the α-catenin-positive cell line MCF-7 (Fig. 1 A, lanes 1 and 4) and the α-catenin-negative cell line PC-9 (lanes 3 and 6). The PC-9 cell line has been shown to have a homozygous deletion of the α-catenin gene (34Oda T. Kanai Y. Shimoyama Y. Nagafuchi S. Tsukita S. Hirohashi S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1993; 193: 890-897Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar) and is therefore used as a control for nonspecific reactivity of antibodies with cell lysates. These results were in agreement with previous studies that have demonstrated a lack of α-catenin expression in MDA-MB-468 cells using polyclonal antibodies against the carboxyl terminus of the molecule (35Sommers C.L. Gelmann E.P. Cowin P. Byers S.W. Cancer Res. 1994; 54: 3544-3552PubMed Google Scholar, 36Pierceall W.E. Woodard A.S. Morrow J.S. Rimm D.L. Fearon E.R. Oncogene. 1995; 11: 1319-1326PubMed Google Scholar). An α-catenin transcript was present, however, in MDA-MB-468 cells at the appropriate molecular mass and at a level comparable to that found in Caco2 cells, which express normal α-catenin levels (Fig. 1 B and data not shown). Further evaluation of the mRNA for α-catenin in MDA-MB-468 cells by RT-PCR revealed only two mutations. Two prominent bands were observed in the PCR using the primer pair A/D, and one band was observed using the primer pair B/D (Fig.2). The bands labeled 1 and 2 were subcloned and sequenced. The sequences of both of these PCR products showed deletion mutations of either 483 or 287 base pairs; both deletions were observed near the 5′-end of the α-catenin message (Fig. 2, C and D). An in-frame deletion was observed in allele 1, but unlike the truncated protein that has been shown to be expressed in the Clone A cell line as a result of a similar mutation in the 5′-end of the α-catenin message (30Roe S. Koslov E.R. Rimm D.L. Cell Adhesion Commun. 1997; (in press)Google Scholar), no truncated protein was detected in MDA-MB-468 cell lysates by both monoclonal and polyclonal antibodies mapping to various regions of the α-catenin molecule (Fig. 1 A, lanes 2 and 5, respectively). Since monoclonal antibody TLα1, which was present in the antibody mixture used for Western blotting, and the polyclonal antibody, both of which map to the carboxyl terminus of the α-catenin protein (amino acids 729–755 and 809–906, respectively), did not react with MDA-MB-468 cell lysates in both Western blotting (Fig. 1 A) and immunofluorescence (data not shown), we conclude that allele 1 does not code for a viable α-catenin protein product. A frameshift mutation was observed in allele 2, resulting in a premature stop codon after 8 aberrant amino acids (Fig. 2 D). A schematic showing the location of each mutation within the context of the full-length sequence is shown in Fig. 2 E. As has been previously observed in PC-9 cells (34Oda T. Kanai Y. Shimoyama Y. Nagafuchi S. Tsukita S. Hirohashi S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1993; 193: 890-897Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar), the MDA-MB-468 cell line appears to have no wild-type α-catenin. According to the American Type Culture Collection, the MDA-MB-468 cell line is predominantly hypodiploid, with a minor biomodal component having 70 chromosomes. It may be possible that there are additional α-catenin alleles within the population of MDA-MB-468 cells. However, we found only two RT-PCR products related to α-catenin. The PCR gel shown in Fig. 2 B is representative of multiple experiments, and in all cases, only two prominent bands are seen (numbered 1 and 2 on the gel). Subcloning of the PCR mixture did reveal other rare products that were apparently artifacts of the PCR as their sequence showed no resemblance to α-catenin. Comparison of the ability of MDA-MB-468, A431, and MCF-7 cells to aggregate in the presence of calcium revealed that while A431 and MCF-7 cells were highly aggregated under these conditions, MDA-MB-468 cells displayed little or no aggregation (Fig. 3 A). These results were consistent with previous reports on the inability of α-catenin-negative cells to aggregate (11Shimoyama Y. Nagafuchi A. Fujita S. Gotoh S. Takeichi M. Tsukita S. Hirohashi S. Cancer Res. 1992; 52: 5770-5774PubMed Google Scholar, 37Breen E. Clarke A. Steele Jr., G. Mercurio A.M. Cell Adhesion Commun. 1993; 1: 239-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). We found, however, that removal of serum from the growth medium for 36 h caused a dramatic increase in the ability of MDA-MB-468 cells to aggregate, but had no effect on the aggregation of A431 or MCF-7 cells (Fig.3 A). To determine which cadherin mediates this aggregation, function-blocking antibodies to E-cadherin, P-cadherin, or N-cadherin (see “Materials and Methods”) were added to the cells during aggregation, and only the anti-E-cadherin antibodies inhibited the aggregation of serum-starved MDA-MB-468 cells even though these cells also express P-cadherin (38Hazan R.B. Kang L. Whooley B.P. Borgen P.I. Cell Adhesion Commun. 1997; 4: 399-411Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). Serum withdrawal induced a 3-fold increase in E-cadherin expression levels in MDA-MB-468 cells, but had no effect on the expression of E-cadherin in MCF-7 and A431 cells (Fig. 3 B), which was consistent with the effect of serum on the aggregation properties of these cells (Fig. 3 A). Serum starvation affected the expression of only E-cadherin in MDA-MB-468 cells; the expression levels of other adhesion-related proteins such as β-catenin, plakoglobin/γ-catenin, and p120 were unaffected (Fig. 3 C). Similarly, the levels of the EGF receptor and the cytoskeletal proteins vinculin, α-actinin, and actin remained unchanged by serum starvation (Fig. 3 C). These results show a close relationship between serum withdrawal, levels of E-cadherin expression, and activation of E-cadherin-dependent adhesion. The preceding results demonstrate that E-cadherin-mediated cell aggregation can be stimulated in MDA-MB-468 cells, even in the absence of α-catenin expression. The similarities between α-catenin and vinculin in both amino acid sequence and subcellular localization to the adherens junction prompted us to examine whether vinculin is associated with cadherin complexes. In serum-starved MDA-MB-468 cells, a high level of vinculin was found to be associated with immunoprecipitates of E-cadherin (Fig.4 A, lane 2). Vinculin was not initially detected in E-cadherin complexes in serum-treated MDA-MB-468 cells (Fig. 4 A, lane 1), but the same levels of vinculin were found complexed with E-cadherin in serum-treated lysates when three times more lysate was used to compensate for the lower E-cadherin levels (data not shown). This suggested that E-cadherin levels restrict the interaction of vinculin with E-cadherin. By comparison, vinculin was not detected in E-cadherin immunoprecipitates of A431 and MCF-7 cells (Fig. 4 A,lanes 4 and 6), although it was present at similar levels in total cell lysates from all three cell lines (lanes 3, 5, and 7). To verify the mutual coprecipitation of E-cadherin with vinculin, immunoprecipitations with anti-vinculin antibodies were performed. We found the highest levels of E-cadherin complexed with vinculin in serum-starved MDA-MB-468 cells (Fig. 4 B, lane 2), and to a lesser extent, this association was also present in serum-treated cells (lane 1) and in A431 and MCF-7 cells (lanes 3 and 4). The breast cancer cell line BT-549, which does not express E-cadherin (39Sommers C.L. Thompson E.W. Torri J.A. Kemler R. Gelmann E.P. Byers S.W. Cell Growth Differ. 1991; 2: 365-372PubMed Google Scholar), was used as a control to exclude any cross-reactivity of antibodies since vinculin (116 kDa) and E-cadherin (124 kDa) nearly comigrate on SDS-polyacrylamide gels (Fig. 4 B, lane 5). To determine whether vinculin is an integral component of the E-cadherin/β-catenin adhesion complex, immunoprecipitations from serum-starved MDA-MB-468 cell lysates were performed with anti-β-catenin antibodies. Both E-cadherin and vinculin were identified in these complexes (Fig. 4 C, lanes 1 and 2). Reciprocally, immunoprecipitation with anti-vinculin antibodies verified the presence of β-catenin and E-cadherin in this complex (Fig. 4, C (lane 3) and B (lane 2), respectively). These results suggest that both α-catenin and vinculin associate with the E-cadherin/β-catenin complex. The interaction of vinculin with E-cadherin in MDA-MB-468 cells is stimulated by increased E-cadherin expression and is likely to be facilitated by the absence of α-catenin, which may have generated additional binding sites for vinculin in the adhesion complex. To verify that the interaction of vinculin with E-cadherin is mediated by β-catenin in a manner analogous to α-catenin, excess recombinant β-catenin was added to serum-starved MDA-MB-468 cell lysates to competitively inhibit the coprecipitation of E-cadherin with vinculin. Increasing concentrations of recombinant β-catenin (ranging from 10 to 80 μg/ml) resulted in decreasing amounts of E-cadherin that coprecipitated with vinculin (Fig.5 A, lanes 1–5). In contrast, the addition of either GST alone or GST-spectrin fusion protein at 80 μg/ml did not affect the coprecipitation of E-cadherin with vinculin (Fig. 5 B, lanes 6 and 7), indicating that this effect is specific for β-catenin. To address the question of whether vinculin and α-catenin compete for binding to β-catenin, increasing amounts of α-catenin fusion protein were added to MDA-MB-468 cell lysates. α-Catenin inhibited the association of vinculin with E-cadherin in a dose-dependent fashion (Fig. 5 B, lanes 1–5). These results indicate that vinculin may be assembled in the adhesion complex by direct binding to β-catenin and by competing with α-catenin for the same binding site on β-catenin. Vinculin and α-catenin share 25–30% sequence homology (14Nagafuchi A. Takeichi M. Tsukita S. Cell. 1991; 65: 849-857Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (428) Google Scholar,15Herrenknecht K.

Cytoskeleton. 1990; 16: 1-6Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar, 17Geiger B. Ginsberg D. Cell Motil. Cytoskeleton. 1991; 20: 1-6Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar), it is tempting to speculate that it may perform a similar function in both structures. Vinculin has been well characterized as being present at adherens junctions (17Geiger B. Ginsberg D. Cell Motil. Cytoskeleton. 1991; 20: 1-6Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar) and is thought to bind to F-actin at these sites (21Wilkins J.A. Lin S. Cell. 1982; 28: 83-90Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar, 22Wilkins J.A. Lin S. J. Cell Biol. 1986; 102: 1085-1092Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 23Westmeyer A.

Keast J.R. Manley S.W. Cell Motil. Cytoskeleton. 1995; 32: 318-331Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar, 41Haftek M. Hansen H.W. Kaiser H.W. Kreysel H.W. Schmitt D. J. Invest. Dermatol. 1996; 106: 498-504Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar) and resonance energy transfer imaging (42Kam Z. Volberg T. Geiger B. J. Cell Sci. 1995; 108: 1051-1062Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) indicate that vinculin, β-catenin, and E-cadherin are present at the same subcellular location. This study suggests that the localization of vinculin at the adherens junction may be a result of a direct interaction with β-catenin in the adhesion complex and represents the first biochemical evidence in support of a direct involvement of vinculin in cadherin-based cell-cell adhesion. The absence of α-catenin in MDA-MB-468 cells is associated with increased vinculin in the adhesion complex, which suggests that α-catenin and vinculin may compete for the same binding site on β-catenin. In support of this hypothesis, we show that the coprecipitation of E-cadherin with anti-vinculin antibodies is prevented by exogenous recombinant β-catenin or α-catenin. These results are consistent with a model whereby vinculin, in a manner analogous to α-catenin, may also link actin filaments to E-cadherin via β-catenin. The sites within α-catenin and β-catenin (43Aberle H. Butz S. Stappert J. Weissig H. Kemler R. Hoschuetzky H. J. Cell Sci. 1994; 107: 3655-3663Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 44Obama H. Ozawa M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 11017-11020Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar) that mediate their interactions have been mapped to specific peptides, and it will be revealing to determine whether they are identical for vinculin. Vinculin was also found in E-cadherin complexes in epithelial cell lines that express α-catenin, suggesting that a fraction of the total cellular vinculin may be a component of cadherin complexes in cells with normal levels of α-catenin. It has been suggested that vinculin may interact with α-catenin at adhesion sites (14Nagafuchi A. Takeichi M. Tsukita S. Cell. 1991; 65: 849-857Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (428) Google Scholar, 15Herrenknecht K. Ozawa M. Eckerskorn C. Lottspeich F. Lenter M. Kemler R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Trends Genet. 1993; 9: 317-321Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (882) Google Scholar), and although there is no published evidence for this idea, it could account for its localization at adherens junctions. This study demonstrates, however, that vinculin binds to E-cadherin complexes in the absence of α-catenin, which eliminates binding to α-catenin as the sole mechanism for the targeting of vinculin to the adhesion complex. The possibility that vinculin may cross-link adhesion complexes is inferred from electron microscopy studies of rotary-shadowed vinculin that demonstrate the existence in vitro of vinculin complexes containing two to six individual molecules (45Molony L. Burridge K.J. J. Cell. Biochem. 1985; 29: 31-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 46Milam L.M. J Mol. Biol. 1985; 184: 543-554Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). It remains to be determined whether this multimerization takes place in vivo. This work suggests that while vinculin may participate in the anchorage of cadherins to the cytoskeleton, α-catenin is likely to mediate a more stable adhesion than vinculin. In support of this hypothesis, α-catenin induces a tight epithelial structure when reconstituted into deficient cells (12Hirano S. Kimoto N. Shimoyama Y. Hirohashi S. Takeichi M. Cell. 1992; 70: 293-301Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (479) Google Scholar), and cadherin/α-catenin complexes with the actin cytoskeleton are detergent-insoluble (47Shore E.M. Nelson W.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 19672-19680Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast, while the morphologic appearance of adhesion-competent (serum-starved) MDA-MB-468 cells is epithelioid, these cells exhibit characteristic refractile cell-cell junctions (data not shown), which suggests that they may be arrested in a premature state of adhesion as compared with MCF-7 or A431 epithelial cells. A switch from a vinculin- to an α-catenin-based junction may therefore be a mechanism that regulates the transition from an initial to a stable adhesion. These two states of adhesion have been characterized by studies that have traced development of cell-cell contacts by video imaging and quantitative immunocytochemistry (48McNeil H. Ryan T.A. Smith S.J. Nelson J. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 120: 1217-1226Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar, 49Angres B. Barth A. Nelson W.J. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 134: 549-557Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar, 50Adams C.L. Nelson W.J. Smith S.J. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 1899-1911Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar), correlating the maturation of cell-cell contacts with increased association of E-cadherin complexes with the cytoskeleton. We therefore propose that the strength of linkage of cadherin complexes to the actin cytoskeleton may determine the strength of adhesion, and vinculin may play a modulatory role. The mechanism by which serum starvation affects E-cadherin expression is not known, although evidence exists in support of a negative feedback loop exerted by the HER2/neu proto-oncogene, a close relative of the EGF receptor. Overexpression of HER2/neu has been shown to repress the promoter activity of E-cadherin, resulting in reduced E-cadherin expression (51D'Souza B. Taylor-Papadimitriou J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 7202-7206Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). Since the EGF receptor is highly expressed in MDA-MB-468 cells (52Filmus J. Pollack M.N. Cailleau R. Buick R.N. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1985; 128: 898-905Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar), it is conceivable that a similar mechanism may take place in these cells. Inactivation of the EGF receptor by serum withdrawal may cause an increase in E-cadherin expression, which in turn stimulates substantial recruitment of vinculin to the adhesion complex and a surge in cell-cell adhesion. Increases in E-cadherin density may stimulate cooperative interactions that facilitate assembly of cadherin-actin complexes, via vinculin, at zones of cell-cell contacts. In conclusion, this study suggests that vinculin plays a role in the establishment or regulation of cadherin-based cell adhesion and that this protein substitutes for α-catenin in adhesive complexes in the MDA-MB-468 cell line. Finally, these findings shed a new light on a dual role of vinculin in transducing signals from both the extracellular matrix and the adherens junction.

https://openalex.org/W2026960893,"<i>Escherichia coli</i> endonuclease VIII (endo VIII) was identified as an enzyme that, like endonuclease III (endo III), removes radiolysis products of thymine including thymine glycol, dihydrothymine, β-ureidoisobutyric acid, and urea from double-stranded plasmid or phage DNA and cleaves the DNA strand at abasic (AP) sites (Melamede, R. J., Hatahet, Z., Kow, Y. W., Ide., H., and Wallace, S. S. (1994) <i>Biochemistry</i> 33, 1255–1264). Using apparently homogeneous endo VIII protein, we now show that endo VIII removes from double-stranded oligodeoxyribonucleotides the stable oxidative products of cytosine, 5-hydroxycytosine and 5-hydroxyuracil. Endo VIII cleaved the damage-containing DNA strand by β,δ-elimination as does formamidopyrimidine DNA glycosylase (Fpg). Like Fpg, endo VIII also excised the 5′-terminal deoxyribose phosphate from an endonuclease IV (endo IV) pre-incised AP site. Thus, in addition to amino acid sequence homology (Jiang, D., Hatahet, Z., Blaisdell, J., Melamede, R. J., and Wallace, S. S. (1997) <i>J. Bacteriol.</i> 179, 3773–3782), endo VIII shares a number of catalytic properties with Fpg. In addition, endo VIII specifically bound to oligodeoxynucleotides containing a reduced AP site with a stoichiometry of 1:1 for protein to DNA with an apparent equilibrium dissociation constant of 3.9 nm. Like Fpg and endo III, the DNase I footprint was small with contact sites primarily on the damage-containing strand; unlike Fpg and endo III, the DNA binding of endo VIII to DNA was asymmetric, 3′ to the reduced AP site."

C6ST catalyzes sulfation of chondroitin, keratan sulfate, and sialyl N-acetyllactosamine oligosaccharides. In this study, we report the cloning and characterization of a novel sulfotransferase that catalyzes sulfation of keratan sulfate. This new sulfotransferase cDNA clone was obtained from a human fetal brain library by cross-hybridization with chick C6ST cDNA. The cDNA clone obtained contains a single open reading frame that predicts a type II transmembrane protein composed of 411 amino acid residues.

Structural analysis of 35S-labeled glycosaminoglycan, which was formed from keratan sulfate by the reaction with 35S-labeled 3′-phosphoadenosine 5′-phosphosulfate and the recombinant sulfotransferase, showed that keratan sulfate was sulfated at position 6 of Gal residues. On the basis of the acceptor substrate specificity, we propose keratan sulfate Gal-6-sulfotransferase (KSGal6ST) for the name of the newly cloned sulfotransferase. KSGal6ST was assigned to chromosome 11p11.1–11.2 by fluorescence in situ hybridization. Among various human adult tissues, a 2.8-kilobase message of KSGal6ST was expressed mainly in the brain. When poly(A)+ RNAs from the chick embryo cornea and brain were probed with the human KSGal6ST cDNA in Northern hybridization, a clear band with about 2.8 kilobases was detected.

We found that C6ST catalyzes sulfation of chondroitin, keratan sulfate, and sialyl N-acetyllactosamine oligosaccharides (11Habuchi O. Matsui Y. Kotoya Y. Aoyama Y. Yasuda Y. Noda M. J. Biol.

This enzyme may, therefore, participate in the biosynthesis of both chondroitin sulfate and keratan sulfate in tissues such as cartilage, in which both chondroitin 6-sulfate and keratan sulfate are actively synthesized. On the other hand, in the developing cornea, keratan sulfate is actively synthesized, but synthetic activity of chondroitin 6-sulfate seems to be minimal (7Hart G.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1976; 251: 6513-6521Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 8Nakazawa K. Suzuki S. Wada K. Nakazawa K. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1995; 117: 707-718Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). In addition, the expression of C6ST mRNA was found to be much weaker in the chick cornea compared with that in cartilage (13Habuchi O. Hirahara Y. Uchimura K. Fukuta M. Glycobiology. 1996; 6: 51-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). These observations suggest the possible existence of a different sulfotransferase in the cornea, which catalyzes mainly the sulfation of keratan sulfate. In this study we report cloning of a novel sulfotransferase cDNA that encodes a protein with sulfotransferase activity toward keratan sulfate. This sulfotransferase transferred sulfate to position 6 of the Gal residue of keratan sulfate but showed no activity toward chondroitin. The following commercial materials were used: H235SO4 was from DuPont NEN; [3H]NaBH4 (16.3 GBq/mmol) [α-32P]dCTP (110 TBq/mmol) and Hybond N+ were from Amersham Japan, Tokyo; the fetal human brain cDNA library and human multiple tissue Northern blots were fromCLONTECH, Palo Alto, CA; unlabeled PAPS,N-acetylglucosamine 6-sulfate, and galactose 6-sulfate were from Sigma; Hiload Superdex 30 HR 16/60, DEAE-Sephadex, and fast desalting column HR 10/10 were from Pharmacia Biotech, Tokyo; chondroitinase ACII, keratanase II, chondroitin sulfate A (whale cartilage), chondroitin sulfate C (shark cartilage), dermatan sulfate, and completely desulfated N-resulfated heparin (CDSNS-heparin) were from Seikagaku Corporation, Tokyo; Partisil SAX-10 was from Whatman. Keratan sulfate from bovine cornea was a product of Seikagaku Corporation and generously donated by that company. [35S]PAPS was prepared as described previously (15Delfert D.M. Conrad H.E. Anal. Biochem. 1985; 148: 303-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). [3H]GlcNAcR(6S) and [3H]GalR(6S) were prepared from GlcNAc(6S) and Gal(6S), respectively, by the reduction with NaB3H4 (13Habuchi O. Hirahara Y. Uchimura K. Fukuta M. Glycobiology. 1996; 6: 51-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Chondroitin (squid skin) was prepared as previously described (16Habuchi O. Miyata K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1980; 616: 208-217Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Partially desulfated keratan sulfate (sulfate/glucosamine = 0.62) was prepared from corneal keratan sulfate according to Nagasawa et al. (17Nagasawa K. Inoue Y. Tokuyasu Y. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1979; 86: 1323-1329Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Solvolysis with dimethyl sulfoxide was carried out at 80 °C for 45 min. The molar ratios of Galβ1–4GlcNAc to Galβ1–4GlcNAc(6S) of the desulfated keratan sulfate, which was determined by the paper chromatographic separation of [3H]Galβ1–4AManR and [3H]Galβ1–4AManR(6S) formed after the reaction sequence of hydrazinolysis, deaminative cleavage, and reduction with NaB3H4 (27Shaklee P.N. Conrad H.E. Biochem. J. 1986; 235: 225-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar), was 0.73. A mixture of [3H]Gal(6S)β1–4GlcNAcR and [3H]Galβ1–4GlcNAcR(6S) was prepared by partial acid hydrolysis (0.1 m HCl, 100 °C, 40 min) of [3H]Gal(6S)β1–4GlcNAcR(6S) as described previously (14Habuchi O. Suzuki Y. Fukuta M. Glycobiology. 1997; 7: 405-412Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Approximately 2 × 106 plaques were screened. Hybond N+ nylon membrane (Amersham Corp.) replicas of the plaques from the λgt 11 cDNA library were fixed by the alkali fixation method recommended by the manufacturer, prehybridized in a solution containing 50% formamide, 5 × SSPE, 5 × Denhardt's solution, 0.5% SDS, and 0.04 mg/ml denatured salmon sperm DNA for 3.5 h at 42 °C. Hybridization was carried out in the same buffer containing a32P-labeled probe for 16 h at 42 °C. The radioactive probe for screening the cDNA library was prepared from chick C6ST cDNA previously reported (12Fukuta M. Uchimura K. Nakashima K. Kato M. Kimata K. Shinomura T. Habuchi O. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 18575-18580Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar) by the random oligonucleotide-primed labeling method (18Feinberg A.P. Vogelstein B. Anal. Biochem. 1983; 132: 6-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (16562) Google Scholar) using [α-32P]dCTP (Amersham Corp.) and a DNA random labeling kit (Takara Shuzo). The filters were washed at 55 °C in 1 × SSPE, 0.1% SDS, and subsequently in 0.1 × SSPE, 0.1% SDS, and positive clones were detected by autoradiography. DNA from λgt 11 positive clones were isolated and cut with EcoRI, which excised the cDNA insert in a single fragment. The fragments were inserted into Bluescript plasmid, and deletion clones were prepared as described previously (19Henikoff S. Gene (Amst.). 1984; 28: 351-359Crossref PubMed Scopus (2828) Google Scholar, 20Yanisch-Perron C. Viera J. Messing J. Gene (Amst.). 1985; 33: 103-109Crossref PubMed Scopus (11410) Google Scholar) using a DNA deletion kit (Takara Shuzo). The complete nucleotide sequence was determined independently on both strands using the dideoxy chain termination method (21Sanger F. Nicklen S. Coulson A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 5463-5467Crossref PubMed Scopus (52251) Google Scholar) with [α-32P]dCTP and Sequenase (U. S. Biochemical Corp.). The DNA sequence was also determined using synthetic oligonucleotide primers. DNA sequences were compiled and analyzed using the Gene Works computer programs (IntelliGenetics). For the construction of pCXNKSGal6ST, the EcoRI fragment containing the 2415-base pair cDNA indicated in Fig. 1 A was excised from the Bluescript plasmid and ligated into the EcoRI site of pCXN2 expression vector (the pCXN2 vector was constructed by Dr. Jun-ichi Miyazaki, Department of Disease-Related Gene Regulation, Faculty of Medicine, University of Tokyo (22Niwa H. Yamamura K. Miyazaki J. Gene (Amst.). 1991; 108: 193-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (4524) Google Scholar) and provided by Dr. Yasuhiro Hashimoto, Tokyo Metropolitan Institute of Medical Sciences). Recombinant plasmids were analyzed by restriction mapping using BamHI to confirm the correct orientation of pCXNKSGal6ST. The plasmid that contained the cDNA fragment in the reversed orientation was designated as pCXNKSGal6ST2 and used for control experiments. COS-7 cells (obtained from Riken Cell Bank, Tsukuba, Japan) were plated in 100-mm culture dishes at a density of 8 × 105 cells/dish. Volume of the medium was 10 ml. The medium used was DMEM containing penicillin (100 units/ml), streptomycin (50 μg/ml), and 10% fetal bovine serum (Life Technologies, Inc.), and cells were grown at 37 °C in 5% CO2, 95% air. When the cell density reached 3 × 106 cells/dish (48 h after plating), COS-7 cells were transfected with pCXNKSGal6ST or pCXNKSGal6ST2. The transfection was performed using the DEAE-dextran method (23Aruffo A. Current Protocol in Molecular Biology. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1991Google Scholar). 5 ml of the prewarmed DMEM containing 10% Nu serum (Collaborative Biomedical Products) were mixed with 0.2 ml of phosphate-buffered saline containing 10 mg/ml DEAE-dextran plus a 2.5 mm chloroquine solution. 15 μg of the recombinant plasmid were mixed with the solution, and the mixture was added to the cells. The cells were incubated for 4 h in a CO2 incubator. The medium was then replaced with 5 ml of 10% dimethyl sulfoxide in phosphate-buffered saline. After the cells were left at room temperature for 2 min, the dimethyl sulfoxide solution was aspirated, and 25 ml of DMEM containing penicillin (100 units/ml), streptomycin (50 μg/ml), and 10% fetal bovine serum were added. The cells were incubated for 67 h, washed with DMEM alone, scraped, and homogenized with a Dounce homogenizer in 1.5 ml/dish of 0.25 m sucrose, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.2, and 0.5% Triton X-100. The homogenates were centrifuged at 10,000 ×g for 20 min, and the activities of C6ST, C4ST, and KSST in the supernatant fractions were measured as described below. Poly(A)+ RNAs (5 μg) prepared from chick embryo tissues were denatured in 50% formamide (v/v), 5% formaldehyde (v/v), 20 mm MOPS, pH 7.0, at 65 °C for 10 min, electrophoresed in 1.2% agarose gel containing 5% formaldehyde (v/v), and transferred to a Hybond N+ nylon membrane overnight. The RNA was fixed by baking at 80 °C for 2 h and prehybridized in a solution containing 50% formamide, 5 × SSPE, 5 × Denhardt's solution, 0.5% SDS, and 0.1 mg/ml denatured salmon sperm DNA for 3 h at 42 °C. Hybridization was carried out in the same buffer containing a32P-labeled probe for 16 h at 42 °C. The filters were washed at 65 °C in 2 × SSPE, 0.1% SDS, and subsequently in 1 × SSPE, 0.1% SDS. Human multiple tissue Northern blot filters (on which 2 μg of poly(A)+ RNAs from various adult human tissues were blotted) were processed under the same conditions described above. The membranes were exposed to x-ray film for 26 h with an intensifying screen at −80 °C. To determine the chromosomal localization of KSGal6ST, fluorescence in situhybridization was performed. Metaphase chromosomes were prepared from normal male lymphocytes using the thymidine synchronization, a bromodeoxyuridine release technique for the delineation of R- and G-bands (24Inazawa J. Saito H. Ariyama T. Abe T. Nakamura Y. Genomics. 1993; 17: 153-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). Before hybridization, chromosomes were stained in Hoechst 33258 and irradiated with UV. A 2.4-kb cDNA shown in Fig. 1 was labeled with biotin-16-UTP by nick translation and hybridized to the denatured chromosome. The hybridization signals were detected with fluorescein isothiocyanate-avidin (Boehringer Mannheim GmbH, Mannheim, Germany), and chromosomes were counterstained with propidium iodide (1 μg/ml). The fluorescent signals were examined using epifluorescent microscope and precise positions of the signals were determined according to the G-bands delineated by Hoechst 33258 through UV filter. In the early experiments (Fig. 3), C6ST activity and KSST activity were assayed by the method described previously (11Habuchi O. Matsui Y. Kotoya Y. Aoyama Y. Yasuda Y. Noda M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 21968-21974Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The reaction mixture used for the early experiments contained, in a final volume of 50 μl, 2.5 μmol of imidazole-HCl, pH 6.8, 1.25 μg (for chondroitin) or 3.75 μg (for keratan sulfate) of protamine chloride, 0.1 μmol of dithiothreitol, 0.025 μmol of glycosaminoglycans (as glucosamine or galactosamine), 50 pmol of [35S]PAPS (about 5.0 × 105 cpm), and enzyme. The reaction mixtures were incubated at 37 °C for 20 min, and the reaction was stopped by immersing the reaction tubes in a boiling water bath for 1 min. 35S-Labeled glycosaminoglycans were isolated by precipitation with ethanol followed by gel chromatography with a fast desalting column as described previously, and radioactivity was determined. The reaction mixtures described above developed for C6ST were, however, not optimum for KSST, and the activity of KSST was underestimated. After the optimum conditions for KSST were revealed, the following modification of the reaction mixture was adopted unless otherwise stated. 2.5 μmol of imidazole-HCl, pH 6.4, and 0.5 μmol of CaCl2 were added to the reaction mixture in place of 2.5 μmol of imidazole-HCl, pH 6.8, and protamine chloride, respectively. KSST activity and chondroitin sulfotransferase activity were determined using keratan sulfate and chondroitin, respectively, as acceptor. For determining C6ST and C4ST activity, 35S-labeled chondroitin was digested with chondroitinase ACII, and the unsaturated disaccharides formed were separated by paper chromatography. The homogenate of COS-7 cells transfected with pCXNKSGal6ST (224 mg as protein obtained from 80 10-cm dishes) was applied to a DEAE-Sephadex A-50 column (2.2 × 13 cm) equilibrated with buffer A (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.2, containing 20% glycerol, 20 mm MgCl2, 2 mmCaCl2, and 10 mm 2-mercaptoethanol) containing 50 mm NaCl. After the column was washed with 500 ml of the same buffer, the absorbed materials were eluted with 0.5 mNaCl in buffer A. About 20% of KSST activity was recovered in the flow through fractions. The remaining KSST activity and all of chondroitin sulfotransferase activity were eluted in 0.5 m NaCl fractions. The flow-through fractions were pooled, dialyzed against 0.15 m NaCl in buffer A, and applied to a Heparin-Sepharose CL 6B column (1.2 × 8.0 cm) equilibrated with buffer A containing 0.15 m NaCl. The materials absorbed to the Heparin-Sepharose CL 6B column were eluted with 0.5 m NaCl in buffer A, dialyzed against buffer A containing 50 mmNaCl, and used for KSGal6ST preparation devoid of C6ST activity. As a control, the homogenate of COS-7 cells without transfection obtained from 20 10-cm dishes was also separated with DEAE-Sephadex in the same procedures as described above except that the column size, elution volume, and fraction size were reduced to one-fourth. 35S-Labeled glycosaminoglycan was prepared by incubating keratan sulfate or desulfated keratan sulfate with [35S]PAPS and the partially purified KSGal6ST (2 μg as protein) as described above for 18 h. 35S-Labeled glycosaminoglycans were separated from 35SO4and [35S]PAPS with the fast desalting column and desalted by lyophilization. The desalted samples from four reaction tubes were pooled and digested with keratanase II in the reaction mixture containing, in a final volume of 50 μl, 0.005 unit of keratanase II and 2.5 μmol of acetate buffer, pH 6.5 (25Nakazawa K. Ito M. Yamagata T. Suzuki S. Greiling H. Scott J.E. Keratan Sulfate: Chemistry and Chemical Pathology. The Biochemical Society, London1989: 99-110Google Scholar, 26Hashimoto N. Morikawa K. Kikuchi H. Yoshida K. Tokuyasu K. Abstracts of the XVth International Carbohydrate Symposium, Yokohama, Japan. The International Carbohydrate Organization, 1990: 271Google Scholar). The reaction mixtures were incubated at 37 °C for 24 h.35S-Labeled disaccharides formed after the keratanase II digestion were separated with an anion exchange HPLC. The keratanase II digests were applied to a Whatman Partisil 10-SAX column (4.5 × 25 cm) equilibrated with 5 mmKH2PO4. The column was developed with 5 mm KH2PO4 for 5 min followed by a 20-min gradient from 5 mm to 250 mm of KH2PO4. The flow rate was 1 ml/min. Under the chromatographic conditions, elution time of Gal(6S)β1–4GlcNAc(6S) and Galβ1–4GlcNAc(6S) detected by absorption at 210 nm were 14 min and 22 min, respectively. 0.5-ml fractions were collected, and 10-μl aliquots were used for determination of radioactivity. Each radioactive peak was collected, dried with a centrifuging vacuum evaporator, and redissolved in a small volume of water. Potassium phosphate was removed by Superdex 30 column chromatography, and the eluate from the Superdex 30 column was lyophilized. To determine which sulfate of Gal(6S)β1–4GlcNAcR(6S) contained 35S radioactivity, monosulfated disaccharide fraction was prepared from [35S]Gal(6S)β1–4GlcNAc(6S) with partial acid hydrolysis. [35S]Gal(6S)β1–4GlcNAc(6S) obtained by Partisil-10 SAX HPLC and Superdex 30 chromatography was reduced with NaBH4 as described elsewhere (14Habuchi O. Suzuki Y. Fukuta M. Glycobiology. 1997; 7: 405-412Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar), and hydrolyzed with 50 μl of 0.1 m HCl at 100 °C for 40 min. After re-N-acetylation with acetic anhydride, the hydrolysate was spotted on a strip of Whatman No. 3 and developed with a solvent described below for 48 h. The second radioactive peak, which potentially contains Galβ1–4GlcNAcR(6S), Gal(6S)β1–4GlcNAcR, Gal(6S), and SO4, was eluted and subjected to paper electrophoresis. The faster migrating peak in the paper electrophoresis was assigned as35SO4. The slower migrating peak, which potentially contains Galβ1–4GlcNAcR(6S), Gal(6S)β1–4GlcNAcR, and Gal(6S) was reduced with NaBH4 as described previously (14Habuchi O. Suzuki Y. Fukuta M. Glycobiology. 1997; 7: 405-412Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar) and analyzed with Partisil-10 SAX HPLC as described below. Superdex 30 16/60 column was equilibrated with 0.2 m NH4HCO3. The flow rate was 1 ml/min. 1-ml fractions were collected. Paper electrophoresis was carried out on Whatman No. 3 paper (2.5 cm x 57 cm) in pyridine/acetic acid/water (1:10:400, by volume, pH 4) at 30 V/cm for 40 min. Paper chromatography was performed on Whatman No. 3 paper (2.5 cm x 57 cm) using a solvent system, 1-butanol/acetic acid/1m NH3 (3:2:1, by volume). The dried paper strips after paper electrophoresis or paper chromatography were cut into 1.25-cm segments, which were analyzed for radioactivity by liquid scintillation counting. Separation of Gal(6S)β1–4GlcNAcRand Galβ1–4GlcNAcR(6S) was carried out by HPLC using a Whatman Partisil 10-SAX column (4.5 × 25 cm) equilibrated with 5 mm KH2PO4. The column was developed with 5 mm KH2PO4 isocratically (27Shaklee P.N. Conrad H.E. Biochem. J. 1986; 235: 225-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). The flow rate was 1 ml/min, and the column temperature was 40 °C. 0.5-ml fractions were collected. When approximately 2 × 106 plaques of a human fetal brain cDNA library were screened using chick C6ST cDNA as a probe, two cDNA clones (1.2 and 2.4 kb) other than human C6ST cDNA clones were obtained. These clones were clearly distinguished from the C6ST clones on the autoradiogram due to their weaker signals. We will report the human C6ST cDNA elsewhere. From the nucleotide sequence, the longer cDNA clone was found to contain a whole open reading frame. The nucleotide sequence of the KSGal6ST cDNA and the predicted amino acid sequence are shown in Fig.1 A. A single open reading frame predicts a protein of 411 amino acid residues with five potential N-linked glycosylation sites. To determine the location of any transmembrane domain, a hydropathy plot was generated from the translated sequence. Analysis of the plot revealed one prominent hydrophobic segment in the amino-terminal region, 14 residues in length, that extends from amino acid residues 7–20 (Fig.1 B). Comparison of the coding sequence of human KSGal6ST with that of chick C6ST has revealed that there is 37% identity on the amino acid level (Fig. 2). There are 5 regions in which more than 6 consecutive amino acid residues are identical. Homology of N-terminal region was lower than that of the C-terminal region. No significant homology in amino acid sequence was observed between human KSGal6ST and any other sulfotransferases previously reported involving heparan sulfate N-sulfotransferase (29Hashimoto Y. Orellana A. Gil G. Hirschberg C.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 15744-15750Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), heparan sulfate 2-sulfotransferase (30Kobayashi M. Habuchi H. Yoneda M. Habuchi O. Kimata K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 13980-13985Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar), and galactosylceramide 3′-sulfotransferase (31Honke K. Tsuda M. Hirahara Y. Ishii A. Makita A. Wada Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 4864-4868Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). COS-7 cells were transfected with the pCXNKSGal6ST, a recombinant plasmid containing the isolated cDNA in the mammalian expression vector pCXN2. The transfected cells were scraped at 67 h after transfection, homogenized with a buffer containing 0.5% Triton X-100, and centrifuged. Activities of C6ST, C4ST, and KSST contained in the supernatant fractions were determined. Control experiments without vector and with vector containing the cDNA in the reversed orientation (pCXNKSGal6ST2) were also done. As shown in TableI, when the cells were transfected with pCXNKSGal6ST2, KSST activity in the transfected cells was unchanged compared with nontransfected cells, whereas about 10-fold increase in KSST activity was observed in the cells transfected with pCXNKSGal6ST. In contrast, both C6ST and C4ST activities were not increased above the control, indicating that the isolated cDNA encodes a protein with KSST activity alone.Table IOverexpression of keratan sulfate sulfotransferase in COS-7 cellsPlasmidSulfotransferase activityC6STC4STKSSTpmol/min/mg proteinNone1.2 ± 0.20.2 ± 0.11.9 ± 0.1pCXNKSGal6ST1.3 ± 0.20.2 ± 0.119.9 ± 0.3pCXNKSGal6ST21.3 ± 0.30.3 ± 0.12.1 ± 0.2 Open table in a new tab C6ST activity, which was included in the cell extracts from COS-7 cells transfected with the pCXNKSGal6ST, was successfully removed by ion-exchange chromatography. The COS-7 cell extracts were applied to a DEAE-Sephadex column, and the absorbed materials were eluted with 0.5 m NaCl in buffer A. About 20% of KSST activity was recovered in the flow-through fraction, whereas chondroitin sulfotransferase activity was recovered only in 0.5m NaCl fraction (Fig.3 A). When cell extracts prepared from COS-7 cells cultured without the plasmid were applied to the DEAE-Sephadex column, no KSST activity was detected in the flow-through fraction (Fig. 3 B). These observation indicates that the KSST activity recovered in the flow-through fraction is due to the overexpressed enzyme, which is encoded by KSGal6ST cDNA. About 80% of KSST activity from the transfected COS-7 cells was eluted in the 0.5 m NaCl fraction, and this activity was much higher than the activity found in 0.5 m NaCl fraction"

Its cytotoxicity has been attributed to several possible mechanisms including reexpression of growth suppressor genes and formation of covalent adducts between DNA methyltransferase and 5-aza-2′-deoxycytidine-substituted DNA which may lead to steric inhibition of DNA function. In this study, we use a panel of human breast cancer cell lines as a model system to examine the relative contribution of two mechanisms, gene reactivation and adduct formation. Estrogen receptor-negative cells, which have a hypermethylated estrogen receptor gene promoter, are more sensitive than estrogen receptor-positive cells and underwent apoptosis in response to 5-aza-2′-deoxycytidine. For the first time, we show that reactivation of a gene silenced by methylation, estrogen receptor, plays a major role in this toxicity in one estrogen receptor-negative cell line as treatment of the cells with anti-estrogen-blocked cell death. However, drug sensitivity of other tumor cell lines correlated best with increased levels of DNA methyltransferase activity and formation DNA·DNA methyltransferase adducts as analyzed in situ.

Current studies suggest that DNA methyltransferase (DNA MTase), 1The abbreviations used are: DNA MTase, DNA methyltransferase; ER, estrogen receptor; 5-aza-dC, 5-aza-2′-deoxycytidine; araC, cytosine arabinoside. 1The abbreviations used are: DNA MTase, DNA methyltransferase; ER, estrogen receptor; 5-aza-dC, 5-aza-2′-deoxycytidine; araC, cytosine arabinoside. the enzyme that methylates cytosines that are 5′ to guanosines, plays a role in human carcinogenesis. In general, the level of DNA MTase activity is elevated significantly in neoplastic cells compared with normal cells (1El-Deiry W.S. Nelkin B.D. Celano P. Yen R.W.C. Falco J.P. Hamilton S.R. Baylin S.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 3470-3474Crossref PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar). Moreover, increased enzyme activity is characteristic of the progression of both colon and lung cancer (2Issa J.-P.J. Vertino P.M. Wu J. Sazaawal S. Celano P. Nelkin B.D. Hamilton S.R. Baylin S.B. J.

These studies provide substantial evidence for the involvement of DNA MTase in oncogenesis.There are at least two potential mechanisms by which DNA MTase may influence oncogenicity. Elevated levels of DNA methylation may lead to increased frequency of C to T transition mutations derived from deamination of methylcytosine (6Laird P.W. Jaenisch R. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1994; 3: 1487-1495Crossref PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar). Alternatively, increased DNA MTase may play a role in the establishment of altered patterns of methylation at CpG island sequences found in the 5′ region of genes involved in growth control and tumor progression (7Vertino P.M. Yen R.C. Gao J. Baylin S.B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 4555-4565Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar). For example, aberrant hypermethylation of CpG islands in cancer cells has been implicated in the transcriptional inactivation of the Rb, p16, estrogen receptor (ER), E-cadherin, and glutathione S-transferase Pi genes (8Ohtani-Fujita N.

Consequently, 5-aza-dC-treated cells are depleted of active DNA MTase through sequestration of the enzyme to azacytosine residues in DNA, resulting in genome-wide demethylation.5-Azacytidine and 5-aza-dC have shown some clinical utility in the treatment of human hemoglobinopathies and malignancies (15Charache S.

At least part of their success in these settings has been attributed to induction of cellular differentiation resulting from hypomethylation and changes in gene expression (17Pinto A. Zagonel V. Leukemia. 1993; 7: 51-60PubMed Google Scholar). For example, in patients with sickle cell anemia or β-thalassemia, 5-aza-dC treatment leads to reexpression of the developmentally silenced fetal hemoglobin gene (15Charache S. Dover G. Smith K. Talbot C.C. Moyer M. Boyer S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1983; 80: 4842-4846Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). Furthermore, 5-aza-dC can induce the differentiation of immature blasts to more mature cells in patients with myelodysplastic and acute myeloid leukemias (16Pinto A. Attadia V. Fusco A. Ferrara F. Spada O.A. Di Fiore P.P. Blood. 1984; 64: 922-929Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, the extent to which the clinical efficacy of 5-aza-dC is related to alteration of gene expression is still in question.Recently, it has been suggested that the cellular effects of 5-aza-dC are a direct result of the formation of stable adducts between DNA MTase and 5-aza-dC-substituted genomic DNA rather than the ensuing DNA hypomethylation. Such adducts could sterically inhibit DNA replication, transcription, and DNA repair and may play a role in 5-aza-dC-induced mutagenesis (18Alvarez E. Elliott E. Houghton A.N. Kerbel R.S. Cancer Res. 1988; 40: 277-278Google Scholar, 19Huang Y.C. Friedman S. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 17424-17429Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 20Jablonka E. Goitein R. Marcus M. Cedar H.

If DNA MTase·DNA adducts are responsible for 5-aza-dC-mediated cytotoxicity, then cells with lower DNA MTase levels would be expected to produce fewer protein·DNA adducts and be less sensitive to the drug. In support of this hypothesis, embryonic stem cells with reduced levels of DNA MTase caused by a targeted disruption of the DNA MTase gene are less sensitive to 5-aza-dC (22Juttermann R. Li E. Jaenisch R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 11797-11801Crossref PubMed Scopus (577) Google Scholar).The present study was designed to examine the relative roles of hypomethylation-induced changes in gene expression and DNA MTase·DNA adduct formation in 5-aza-dC-mediated cytotoxicity using a panel of human breast cancer cell lines as a model system. Previously we have shown that high levels of DNA MTase activity correlate with the more aggressive ER-negative tumor phenotype in a series of established breast cancer cell lines (23Ottaviano Y.L. Issa J.P. Parl F.F. Smith H.S. Baylin S.B. Davidson N.E. Cancer Res. 1994; 54: 2552-2555PubMed Google Scholar). The absence of ER gene expression in these cells is associated with hypermethylation of CpG island sequences in the promoter and first exon of the ER gene, and treatment of cells with 5-aza-dC leads to hypomethylation and production of a functional ER protein (24Ferguson A.T. Lapidus R.G. Baylin S.B. Davidson N.E. Cancer Res. 1995; 55: 2279-2283PubMed Google Scholar). Because introduction of ER suppresses the growth of ER-negative breast cancer cells in an estrogen-dependent manner, it is possible that 5-aza-dC-induced reactivation of ER may inhibit the growth of ER-negative cells selectively (25Garcia M. Derocq D. Freiss G. Rochefort H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 11538-11542Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar, 26Jiang S.Y. Jordan V.C. J. Natl.

The data reported here indicate that both reexpression of ER and intracellular DNA MTase levels contribute to 5-aza-dC-induced growth inhibition of ER-negative breast cancer cells. In particular, we provide direct evidence that a major mechanism of action of 5-aza-dC involves the formation of stable complexes between cellular DNA and DNA MTase.DISCUSSIONThe cytosine analog 5-aza-dC is a potent inhibitor of DNA MTase, which has been widely used in vitro as a demethylating agent and has undergone clinical trials in the treatment of some leukemias and hemoglobin disorders (15Charache S. Dover G. Smith K. Talbot C.C. Moyer M. Boyer S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1983; 80: 4842-4846Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar, 16Pinto A. Attadia V. Fusco A. Ferrara F. Spada O.A.

The mechanism of DNA MTase inhibition by 5-aza-dC suggests that the cellular response to 5-aza-dC may be caused either by the direct effects of cross-link formation between DNA MTase and 5-azacytosine-substituted cellular DNA or by the indirect effect of DNA MTase inhibition on DNA methylation and altered gene expression/chromatin structure (Fig. 1). Our findings indicate that both of these mechanisms contribute to 5-aza-dC-mediated cytotoxicity in human breast cancer cells.We have shown previously in a series of established breast cancer cell lines that the ER-negative phenotype is associated with increased levels of DNA MTase activity and hypermethylation of the CpG island in the 5′ region of the ER gene (10Lapidus R.G. Ferguson A.T. Ottaviano Y.L. Parl F.F. Smith H.S. Weitzman S.A. Baylin S.B. Issa J.P. Davidson N.E. Clin. Cancer Res. 1996; 2: 805-810PubMed Google Scholar, 23Ottaviano Y.L. Issa J.P. Parl F.F. Smith H.S. Baylin S.B. Davidson N.E. Cancer Res. 1994; 54: 2552-2555PubMed Google Scholar). Likewise, hypermethylation of the ER gene CpG island is associated with loss of ER gene expression in intestinal neoplasias and a majority of human hematopoietic malignancies, indicating that inactivation of ER occurs in the development of a number of human cancers (42Issa J.-P.J. Ottaviano Y.L. Celano P. Hamilton S.R. Davidson N.E. Baylin S.B. Nat. Genet. 1994; 7: 536-540Crossref PubMed Scopus (1064) Google Scholar, 43Issa J.-P.J. Zehnbauer B.A. Civin C.I. Collector M.I. Sharkis S.J. Davidson N.E. Kaufman S.H. Baylin S.B. Cancer Res. 1996; 56: 973-977PubMed Google Scholar). Indeed, ER can act as an estrogen-dependent growth suppressor when expressed in ER-negative tumor cell lines of several origins including breast (25Garcia M. Derocq D. Freiss G. Rochefort H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 11538-11542Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar, 26Jiang S.Y. Jordan V.C. J. Natl. Cancer Inst. 1992; 84: 580-591Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar, 27Zajchowski D.A. Sager R. Webster L. Cancer Res. 1993; 53: 5004-5011PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, demethylation of the ER CpG island that has become aberrantly methylated during carcinogenesis has the potential to limit tumor cell growth by allowing the reexpression of a functional growth suppressor gene. Our finding that the anti-estrogen ICI 182,780 can partially block the growth inhibitory effect of 5-aza-dC in at least one ER-negative cell line, Hs578t, supports this hypothesis.Across both ER-negative and ER-positive cell lines, sensitivity to 5-aza-dC was related directly to endogenous levels of DNA MTase. These results are consistent with previous studies showing that sensitivity to 5-aza-dC correlated with endogenous DNA MTase levels in cells with a targeted disruption of one or both copies of the DNA MTase gene (22Juttermann R. Li E. Jaenisch R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 11797-11801Crossref PubMed Scopus (577) Google Scholar). In that study, the authors hypothesized that cells with higher levels of DNA MTase can form more cross-links between DNA MTase and 5-azacytosine residues in DNA, and this lesion accounted for the cytotoxic effects of 5-aza-dC (22Juttermann R. Li E. Jaenisch R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 11797-11801Crossref PubMed Scopus (577) Google Scholar). Indeed, several in vitrofindings indicated the probable existence of such complexes. For example, studies of bacterial cytosine methyltransferases indicate formation of covalent complexes when 5-azacytosine is substituted for cytosine within the recognition sequence of the enzyme (14Santi D. Norment A. Garrett C.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1984; 81: 6996-6997Crossref Scopus (420) Google Scholar). Data from Christman et al. (40Christman J.K. Schneiderman N. Acs G. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 4059-4068Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and Michalowsky and Jones (29Michalowsky L.A. Jones P.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 3076-3083Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar) demonstrated that nuclear proteins form salt and Sarkosyl-resistant complexes with DNA isolated from 5-aza-dC-treated mammalian cells. These complexes copurified with DNA MTase enzyme activity (40Christman J.K. Schneiderman N. Acs G. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 4059-4068Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Now, we show conclusively that in cells treated with 5-aza-dC, soluble DNA MTase is lost and appears in a complex with intracellular DNA. Furthermore, the amount of complex formed correlates with endogenous DNA MTase activity.As predicted by Gabbara and Bhagwat (13Gabbara S. Bhagwat A.S. Biochem. J. 1995; 307: 87-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar), the DNA MTase·DNA complexes that formed intracellularly in the presence of the cofactor S-adenosylmethionine were essentially irreversible. DNA MTase was not recovered from the insoluble fraction despite extraction with 0.5 m salt, detergent (1% Sarkosyl, 2% SDS), or boiling in the presence of SDS and a reducing agent. Furthermore, it is likely that the DNA-bound DNA MTase remains intact because the antibody used to detect DNA MTase was generated against an amino-terminal domain (amino acids 250–687), whereas binding to 5-azacytosine residues occurs at the active site in the carboxyl-terminal domain (amino acid 1226).Although there is an overall concordance between the levels of DNA MTase and cytotoxicity, there appears to be a fundamental difference between ER-positive and ER-negative cells in their response to 5-aza-dC. The ER-positive cell line MCF-7 and the ER-negative cell lines Hs578t and MDA-MB-435 have similar levels of DNA MTase activity and cross-link formation, yet the MCF-7 cells are 10–25-fold less sensitive and do not undergo apoptosis in response to the drug. Our data show that 5-aza-dC-induced cytotoxicity in the Hs578t cells is in part caused by the reactivation of the growth suppressor gene, ER. However, we found no evidence for a significant effect of ER reactivation on the growth of MDA-MB-435 cells. Therefore, the increased sensitivity of the MDA-MB-435 cells relative to the MCF-7 cells may be the result of differences in downstream signaling events triggered by DNA MTase adduct formation. For example, the response of ER-negative cells to 5-aza-dC involved activation of an apoptotic pathway, whereas we found little evidence of programmed cell death in the ER-positive cells. Another possibility is that the MCF-7 and MDA-MB-435 cells differ in their ability to repair DNA MTase·DNA adducts. The persistence of such complexes in some cell types may play a role in 5-aza-dC-induced mutations (21Jackson-Grusby L. Laird P.W. Magge S.N. Moeller B.J. Jaenisch R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 4681-4685Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). Further study on the time course and reversibility of 5-aza-dC-mediated cross-link formation in the various cell lines may be useful in elucidating any cell type-specific repair deficiencies. A final alternative explanation is that 5-aza-dC has effects on MDA-MB-435 cells which are unrelated to either reactivation of ER or formation of DNA MTase-DNA cross-links, which may include reactivation of other growth suppressor genes.In summary, we have shown that sensitivity to 5-aza-dC is dictated primarily by intracellular DNA MTase levels and the formation of cross-links between DNA MTase and 5-azacytosine-substituted DNA. Therefore, 5-aza-dC, an agent that has undergone testing for the treatment of acute myelogenous leukemias and myelodysplastic syndromes, may also be efficacious in the treatment of ER-negative breast cancers and other tumors with high DNA MTase levels. Moreover, given the recent interest in gene-specific hypermethylation in carcinogenesis, we now provide evidence that demethylation and reexpression of aberrantly methylated growth suppressor genes may be a feasible alternative to cytotoxic agents in cancer therapy. Current studies suggest that DNA methyltransferase (DNA MTase), 1The abbreviations used are: DNA MTase, DNA methyltransferase; ER, estrogen receptor; 5-aza-dC, 5-aza-2′-deoxycytidine; araC, cytosine arabinoside. 1The abbreviations used are: DNA MTase, DNA methyltransferase; ER, estrogen receptor; 5-aza-dC, 5-aza-2′-deoxycytidine; araC, cytosine arabinoside. the enzyme that methylates cytosines that are 5′ to guanosines, plays a role in human carcinogenesis. In general, the level of DNA MTase activity is elevated significantly in neoplastic cells compared with normal cells (1El-Deiry W.S. Nelkin B.D. Celano P. Yen R.W.C. Falco J.P. Hamilton S.R. Baylin S.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 3470-3474Crossref PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar). Moreover, increased enzyme activity is characteristic of the progression of both colon and lung cancer (2Issa J.-P.J. Vertino P.M. Wu J. Sazaawal S. Celano P. Nelkin B.D. Hamilton S.R. Baylin S.B. J.

A. 1996; 93: 4045-4050Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar). Studies demonstrate that overexpression of DNA MTase leads to the tumorigenic conversion of NIH3T3 cells (4Wu J. Issa J.-P.J. Herman J. Bassett Jr., D.E. Nelkin B.D. Baylin S.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 8891-8895Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar), whereas decreasing the levels of DNA MTase through a combination of genetic and pharmacologic means drastically reduces the incidence of colonic adenomas in the Apc min mouse model of colon carcinogenesis (5Laird P.W. Jackson-Grusby L. Fazeli A. Dickinson S.L. Edward Jung W. Li E. Weinberg R.A. Jaenisch R. Cell. 1995; 81: 197-205Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (656) Google Scholar). These studies provide substantial evidence for the involvement of DNA MTase in oncogenesis. There are at least two potential mechanisms by which DNA MTase may influence oncogenicity. Elevated levels of DNA methylation may lead to increased frequency of C to T transition mutations derived from deamination of methylcytosine (6Laird P.W. Jaenisch R. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1994; 3: 1487-1495Crossref PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar). Alternatively, increased DNA MTase may play a role in the establishment of altered patterns of methylation at CpG island sequences found in the 5′ region of genes involved in growth control and tumor progression (7Vertino P.M. Yen R.C. Gao J. Baylin S.B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 4555-4565Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar). For example, aberrant hypermethylation of CpG islands in cancer cells has been implicated in the transcriptional inactivation of the Rb, p16, estrogen receptor (ER), E-cadherin, and glutathione S-transferase Pi genes (8Ohtani-Fujita N.

Smith H.S. Baylin S.B. Davidson N.E. Cancer Res. 1994; 54: 2552-2555PubMed Google Scholar). Likewise, hypermethylation of the ER gene CpG island is associated with loss of ER gene expression in intestinal neoplasias and a majority of human hematopoietic malignancies, indicating that inactivation of ER occurs in the development of a number of human cancers (42Issa J.-P.J. Ottaviano Y.L. Celano P. Hamilton S.R. Davidson N.E. Baylin S.B. Nat. Genet. 1994; 7: 536-540Crossref PubMed Scopus (1064) Google Scholar, 43Issa J.-P.J. Zehnbauer B.A. Civin C.I. Collector M.I. Sharkis S.J. Davidson N.E. Kaufman S.H. Baylin S.B. Cancer Res. 1996; 56: 973-977PubMed Google Scholar). Indeed, ER can act as an estrogen-dependent growth suppressor when expressed in ER-negative tumor cell lines of several origins including breast (25Garcia M. Derocq D. Freiss G. Rochefort H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 11538-11542Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar, 26Jiang S.Y. Jordan V.C. J. Natl.

Therefore, demethylation of the ER CpG island that has become aberrantly methylated during carcinogenesis has the potential to limit tumor cell growth by allowing the reexpression of a functional growth suppressor gene. Our finding that the anti-estrogen ICI 182,780 can partially block the growth inhibitory effect of 5-aza-dC in at least one ER-negative cell line, Hs578t, supports this hypothesis.Across both ER-negative and ER-positive cell lines, sensitivity to 5-aza-dC was related directly to endogenous levels of DNA MTase. These results are consistent with previous studies showing that sensitivity to 5-aza-dC correlated with endogenous DNA MTase levels in cells with a targeted disruption of one or both copies of the DNA MTase gene (22Juttermann R. Li E. Jaenisch R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 11797-11801Crossref PubMed Scopus (577) Google Scholar). In that study, the authors hypothesized that cells with higher levels of DNA MTase can form more cross-links between DNA MTase and 5-azacytosine residues in DNA, and this lesion accounted for the cytotoxic effects of 5-aza-dC (22Juttermann R. Li E. Jaenisch R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 11797-11801Crossref PubMed Scopus (577) Google Scholar). Indeed, several in vitrofindings indicated the probable existence of such complexes. For example, studies of bacterial cytosine methyltransferases indicate formation of covalent complexes when 5-azacytosine is substituted for cytosine within the recognition sequence of the enzyme (14Santi D. Norment A. Garrett C.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1984; 81: 6996-6997Crossref Scopus (420) Google Scholar). Data from Christman et al. (40Christman J.K. Schneiderman N. Acs G. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 4059-4068Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and Michalowsky and Jones (29Michalowsky L.A. Jones P.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 3076-3083Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar) demonstrated that nuclear proteins form salt and Sarkosyl-resistant complexes with DNA isolated from 5-aza-dC-treated mammalian cells. These complexes copurified with DNA MTase enzyme activity (40Christman J.K. Schneiderman N. Acs G. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 4059-4068Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Now, we show conclusively that in cells treated with 5-aza-dC, soluble DNA MTase is lost and appears in a complex with intracellular DNA. Furthermore, the amount of complex formed correlates with endogenous DNA MTase activity.As predicted by Gabbara and Bhagwat (13Gabbara S. Bhagwat A.S. Biochem. J. 1995; 307: 87-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar), the DNA MTase·DNA complexes that formed intracellularly in the presence of the cofactor S-adenosylmethionine were essentially irreversible. DNA MTase was not recovered from the insoluble fraction despite extraction with 0.5 m salt, detergent (1% Sarkosyl, 2% SDS), or boiling in the presence of SDS and a reducing agent. Furthermore, it is likely that the DNA-bound DNA MTase remains intact because the antibody used to detect DNA MTase was generated against an amino-terminal domain (amino acids 250–687), whereas binding to 5-azacytosine residues occurs at the active site in the carboxyl-terminal domain (amino acid 1226).Although there is an overall concordance between the levels of DNA MTase and cytotoxicity, there appears to be a fundamental difference between ER-positive and ER-negative cells in their response to 5-aza-dC. The ER-positive cell line MCF-7 and the ER-negative cell lines Hs578t and MDA-MB-435 have similar levels of DNA MTase activity and cross-link formation, yet the MCF-7 cells are 10–25-fold less sensitive and do not undergo apoptosis in response to the drug. Our data show that 5-aza-dC-induced cytotoxicity in the Hs578t cells is in part caused by the reactivation of the growth suppressor gene, ER. However, we found no evidence for a significant effect of ER reactivation on the growth of MDA-MB-435 cells. Therefore, the increased sensitivity of the MDA-MB-435 cells relative to the MCF-7 cells may be the result of differences in downstream signaling events triggered by DNA MTase adduct formation. For example, the response of ER-negative cells to 5-aza-dC involved activation of an apoptotic pathway, whereas we found little evidence of programmed cell death in the ER-positive cells. Another possibility is that the MCF-7 and MDA-MB-435 cells differ in their ability to repair DNA MTase·DNA adducts. The persistence of such complexes in some cell types may play a role in 5-aza-dC-induced mutations (21Jackson-Grusby L. Laird P.W. Magge S.N. Moeller B.J. Jaenisch R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 4681-4685Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). Further study on the time course and reversibility of 5-aza-dC-mediated cross-link formation in the various cell lines may be useful in elucidating any cell type-specific repair deficiencies. A final alternative explanation is that 5-aza-dC has effects on MDA-MB-435 cells which are unrelated to either reactivation of ER or formation of DNA MTase-DNA cross-links, which may include reactivation of other growth suppressor genes.In summary, we have shown that sensitivity to 5-aza-dC is dictated primarily by intracellular DNA MTase levels and the formation of cross-links between DNA MTase and 5-azacytosine-substituted DNA. Therefore, 5-aza-dC, an agent that has undergone testing for the treatment of acute myelogenous leukemias and myelodysplastic syndromes, may also be efficacious in the treatment of ER-negative breast cancers and other tumors with high DNA MTase levels. Moreover, given the recent interest in gene-specific hypermethylation in carcinogenesis, we now provide evidence that demethylation and reexpression of aberrantly methylated growth suppressor genes may be a feasible alternative to cytotoxic agents in cancer therapy. The cytosine analog 5-aza-dC is a potent inhibitor of DNA MTase, which has been widely used in vitro as a demethylating agent and has undergone clinical trials in the treatment of some leukemias and hemoglobin disorders (15Charache S. Dover G. Smith K. Talbot C.C. Moyer M. Boyer S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1983; 80: 4842-4846Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar, 16Pinto A. Attadia V. Fusco A. Ferrara F. Spada O.A. Di Fiore P.P. Blood. 1984; 64: 922-929Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 17Pinto A. Zagonel V. Leukemia. 1993; 7: 51-60PubMed Google Scholar). The mechanism of DNA MTase inhibition by 5-aza-dC suggests that the cellular response to 5-aza-dC may be caused either by the direct effects of cross-link formation between DNA MTase and 5-azacytosine-substituted cellular DNA or by the indirect effect of DNA MTase inhibition on DNA methylation and altered gene expression/chromatin structure (Fig. 1). Our findings indicate that both of these mechanisms contribute to 5-aza-dC-mediated cytotoxicity in human breast cancer cells.

https://openalex.org/W2016004690,"Erythropoietin (Epo) is known for its role in erythropoiesis and acts by binding to its receptor (EpoR) on the surface of erythroid progenitors. EpoR activity follows the site of hematopoiesis from the embryonic yolk sac to the fetal liver and then the adult spleen and bone marrow. Expression of EpoR has also been observed in selected cells of non-hematopoietic origin, such as the embryonic mouse brain during mid-gestation, at levels comparable to adult bone marrow. EpoR transcripts in brain decrease during development falling by birth to less than 1–3% of the level in hematopoietic tissue. We have now recapitulated this pattern of expression using a human EpoR transgene consisting of an 80-kb human EpoR genomic fragment. The highest level of expression was observed in the embryonic yolk sac and fetal liver, analogous to the endogenous gene, in addition to expression in adult spleen and bone marrow. Although activity of this transgene in brain is initially lower than the endogenous gene, it does exhibit the down-regulation observed for the endogenous gene in adult brain. The expression pattern of hybrid transgenes of an hEpoR promoter fused to β-galactosidase in 9.5-day embryos suggested that the hEpoR promoter region between −1778 and −150 bp 5′ of the transcription start site is necessary to direct EpoR expression in the neural tube. EpoR expression in the neural tube may be the origin of the EpoR transcripts detected in brain during development. These data demonstrate that both the mouse and human EpoR genes contain regulatory elements to direct significant levels of expression in a developmentally controlled manner in brain and suggest that in addition to its function during erythropoiesis, EpoR may play a role in the development of selected non-hematopoietic tissue.

Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 154-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar). In hematopoietic cells, the EpoR gene is active early and EpoR mRNA is expressed at moderate levels in the pluripotent hematopoietic stem cell (3Orlic D. Anderson S. Biesecker L.G. Sorrentino B.P. Bodine D.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 4601-4605Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). Primary erythroblasts contain a low level of surface erythropoietin receptors, and the number of receptor increase to more than 1000/cell as erythropoiesis continues upon Epo stimulation (4Broudy V.C. Lin N. Brice M. Nakamoto B. Papayannopoulou T. Blood. 1991; 77: 2583-2590Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Late in erythropoiesis, there is a rapid reduction in EpoR expression, and dependence upon Epo declines as cells progress toward terminal differentiation (5Wickrema A. Krantz S.B. Winkelmann J.C. Bondurant M.C. Blood. 1992; 80: 1940-1949Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The EpoR gene contains eight exons with a single transmembrane region (6Noguchi C.T. Bae K.S. Chin K. Wada Y. Schechter A.N.

In vitro, cells of other lineages respond to Epo stimulation including hematopoietic cells such as megakaryocytes, which differentiate in the presence of Epo (14Ishibashi T. Koziol J.A. Burstein S.A. J. Clin. Invest. 1987; 79: 286-289Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar), and B lymphocytes, which exhibit a proliferative response (15Kimata H. Yoshida A. Ishioka C. Masuda S. Sasaki R. Mikawa H. Clin. Exp. Immunol. 1991; 85: 151-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). We have reported that in addition to expression in hematopoietic tissues, EpoR expression can be detected in day 10.5 embryonic mouse brain at high levels comparable to that in adult hematopoietic tissue. EpoR expression in brain decreases with development and is not readily detectable at or after birth (16Liu Z.Y. Chin K. Noguchi C.T. Dev. Biol. 1994; 166: 159-169Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Embryonic EpoR expression in the brain may be related to EpoR expression on other non-hematopoietic cells such as those of endothelial or neuronal origin. For example, human umbilical vein endothelial cells express EpoR and are responsive to Epo (17Anagnostou A. Lee E.S. Kessimian N. Levinson R. Steiner M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Miyatake K. Nakano Y. Eur J. Biochem. 1996; 239: 494-500Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar), and functional EpoR has been detected in cultured rodent cells with neuronal characteristics (20Masuda S. Nagao M. Takahata K.

Sasaki R. Blood. 1996; 88: 465-471Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In an attempt to create an hEpoR transgenic mouse exhibiting developmental control in both hematopoietic cells and brain, we isolated a larger (80 kb) human genomic fragment containing the EpoR gene for production of transgenic mice. In a preliminary report, we showed that this transgene was able to direct readily detectable levels of hEpoR transgene expression in fetal liver and adult bone marrow with little or no expression in the adult brain (23Liu C. Yu K. Shen K. Liu Z. Noguchi C.T. Proc. Assoc. Am. Physicians. 1996; 108: 449-454PubMed Google Scholar). We now show that the 80-kb hEpoR transgene is developmentally regulated to mimic both the pattern of the endogenous mEpoR gene expression in hematopoietic tissue and brain. The highest levels of hEpoR transgene and endogenous mEpoR gene expression are observed in hematopoietically active embryonic tissue (yolk sac and fetal liver). In the brain, hEpoR expression in the developing embryo is followed by down-regulation of expression so that the levels of endogenous mEpoR gene and hEpoR transgene expression are reduced about 2 orders of magnitude or more in adult brain. Reporter gene constructs using hEpoR promoter fragments to drive β-galactosidase gene expression in early transgenic mouse embryos suggest that the region flanking the hEpoR proximal promoter is necessary to drive EpoR expression in the early embryonic neural tube. These data demonstrate that both human and mouse EpoR genes are actively transcribed in hematopoietic tissue and the developing embryonic brain and suggest that, in addition to its role in erythropoiesis, EpoR may be functionally important in the development of select non-hematopoietic tissue. An 80-kb EpoR genomic clone was isolated from a human P1 phagemid library (Genome Systems, St. Louis, MO). P1 phagemid DNA was prepared for direct injection as described previously (24Callow M.J. Stoltzfus L.J. Lawn R.M. Rubin E.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 2130-2134Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). DNA was further purified by isopropanol precipitation, ethanol precipitation, and treatment with RNase and phenol/chloroform. Final treatment included Gene-clean (Bio 101, Vista, CA) and filtration through a 0.22-μ sterile filter. The DNA was centrifuged again to remove any remaining glass beads and was dialyzed against injection buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, with 0.1 mmEDTA) (16Liu Z.Y. Chin K. Noguchi C.T. Dev. Biol. 1994; 166: 159-169Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Transgenic mice were generated using B6C3F1 (female) × B6D2F1 (male) as described previously (16Liu Z.Y. Chin K. Noguchi C.T. Dev. Biol. 1994; 166: 159-169Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). The B6C3F1 results from C57BL/6NCr × C3H/HeN and the B6D2F1 results from C57BL/6NCr × DBA/2NCr. DNA was injected into the male pronucleus of embryonic day 2 (E2) fertilized mouse eggs. The injected eggs were reimplanted into surrogate dams. Screening for positive newborns was done by isolation of genomic DNA from a 0.5-cm piece of the tail at 2 weeks of age. The DNA was subjected to polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using a pair of primers selected from the human EpoR gene as described previously. Mice positive for the hEpoR were further analyzed and confirmed by Southern blot analysis. For each mouse, 10 μg of genomic DNA was digested with BamHI, loaded on a 0.7% agarose gel for electrophoresis, and transferred to a nylon membrane using a Turboblotter (Schleicher & Schuell). The membrane was subsequently probed using a nonradioactive labeled probe (Boehringer Mannheim) spanning exons 4 and 5 of the hEpoR cDNA. Positive progeny were then bred for further analysis. Total RNA was prepared from various tissues using STAT-60 (Tel-Test B, Friendswood, TX) and treated with RNase-free DNase (Promega, Madison, WI) at 5 units/100 μg of RNA at 37 °C for 30 min followed by phenol/chloroform extraction and ethanol precipitation. One microgram of isolated total RNA was reverse-transcribed for 15 min in a 20-μl reaction mixture using reverse transcriptase (Perkin-Elmer). One microliter of RT product was then amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using a primer pair designed to detect the human EpoR transcript from exons 1 and 3: 5′-ACCACCTCGGGGCGTCCCTCT-3′ (sense) and 5′-AGCTTCCATGGCTCATCC-3′ (antisense). Primers used to detect the mouse EpoR transcript were (from exons 1 and 3): 5′-AAACTCAGGGTGCCCCTCTGGCCT-3′ (sense) and 5′-GATGCGGTGATAGCGAGGAGAACC-3′ (antisense). Positive control primers for the mouse ribosomal protein S16: (5′-CTGGAGCCTGTTTTGCTTCTG-3′ (sense) and 5′-TGAGATGGACTGTCGGATGG-3′ (antisense)) gave a 110-bp band PCR product for cDNA and a 198-bp band for genomic DNA. Specific DNA standards were produced such that when they were co-amplified using primers for a specific cDNA, the product obtained from the DNA standard would be slightly shorter than the product obtained from the cDNA of interest. Primer pairs of 50 bp long were designed to contain 20 bp at the 5′ end matching the respective sequences of the cDNA specific primers. The remaining 30 bp at the 3′ end were then selected to match a sequence within the amplified cDNA fragment that would produce a PCR product distinguishable in size from the original PCR-amplified cDNA product. Fifty nanograms of specific cDNA was used in a 100-μl PCR reaction mixture. The resulting PCR products were separated on 1% agarose gels and electroeluted (Schleicher & Schuell). Concentration of DNA standard was determined by UV absorbance at 260 nm. mRNA was reverse-transcribed and the product subjected to quantitative PCR involving two sets of co-amplification with standard cDNA. We used a modified quantitative RT-PCR procedure incorporating serial dilutions of sample and specific standard DNA to determine the level of EpoR expression. For the first set, seven reactions were set up with increasing amount of sample and decreasing amount of standard. The dilutions in which intensities of the cDNA PCR product and the PCR product for the DNA standard were similar were used to estimate the initial amount of message present in the RT-PCR reaction (23Liu C. Yu K. Shen K. Liu Z. Noguchi C.T. Proc. Assoc. Am. Physicians. 1996; 108: 449-454PubMed Google Scholar). After this initial estimation of the expression level, a second set of PCR was carried out using a fixed amount of sample and an increasing amount of standard bracketing the estimated crossing point. When the amount of sample was limited, the amount of standard was fixed and that of the sample varied to minimize the total amount of sample required. This method of PCR quantitation was sensitive to differences of 2-fold or more. Normal and transgenic mice were injected with phenylhydrazine at a dose of 0.03 g/g of body weight for two days and at 0.015 g/g of body weight for 3 days. Mice were sacrificed on the 7th day from the initial treatment. The reticulocyte count was determined for each mouse and RNA prepared from different tissues. A reporter gene construct was made containing a hEpoR promoter fragment extending 1778 bp 5′ of the transcription start site and 3′ to include the untranslated transcribed region and linked to a β-galactosidase reporter gene. Transgenic mice were constructed as described above and embryos harvested and stained for β-galactosidase activity (25Whiting J. Marshall H. Cook M. Krumlauf R. Rigby P.W. Stott D. Allemann R.K. Genes Dev. 1991; 5: 2048-2059Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). The number of days after vaginal plug formation was used to identify the age of embryos. Embryos were embedded in paraffin and 10-μm saggital sections were made and counterstained with hematoxylin-eosin. Transgenic mice were generated from an 80-kb human EpoR clone isolated from a genomic P1 phagemid library. This construct contained flanking genomic DNA extending 6 kb 5′ and 60 kb 3′ of the hEpoR coding region (Fig. 1 A). Integration of the transgene was determined by PCR and confirmed by Southern blot analysis as described under “Materials and Methods” (Fig.1 B). Two independent lines of transgenic mice were used for further analysis. At least three mice were analyzed, each independently, from the two lines. Transgene copy number for these lines was low (less than five). To examine transgene activity in the adult mouse, RNA was isolated from various tissues and analyzed for endogenous mEpoR gene and hEpoR transgene expression. In hematopoietic tissues, bone marrow, and spleen, both mEpoR and hEpoR transcripts were readily detected (Fig.2). Expression of the hEpoR transgene in hematopoietic tissue in addition to endogenous mEpoR expression did not result in increased stimulation of erythropoiesis, as no difference was observed in blood hematocrit compared with normal control mice. Mice carrying the 80-kb transgene showed no gross morphological abnormalities. Analysis of expression in non-hematopoietic tissue indicated that no RNA transcripts could be detected in adult liver, heart, leg muscle, or kidney corresponding to either endogenous mEpoR or transgenic hEpoR expression (Fig. 2). We have previously reported that a 15-kb hEpoR transgene provided hematopoietic specific expression in spleen and bone marrow of adult mice but at levels lower than the endogenous gene (16Liu Z.Y. Chin K. Noguchi C.T. Dev. Biol. 1994; 166: 159-169Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). We now examine the expression of the 80-kb hEpoR transgene in developing hematopoietic tissue and find expression levels more comparable to those observed for the endogenous gene. As observed for the mouse EpoR, the hEpoR transgene was expressed in yolk sac, fetal liver, and adult spleen and bone marrow. The level of hEpoR expression was determined using quantitative RT-PCR as described above and compared with the level detected for endogenous mEpoR. The highest level of hEpoR mRNA was observed in embryonic hematopoietic tissues (Fig.3). Human EpoR transgene expression levels in yolk sac (110 fg/μg of RNA) and fetal liver (262 fg/μg of RNA) were similar to mEpoR expression in yolk sac (80 fg/μg of RNA) and in fetal liver (104 fg/μg of RNA). As with endogenous mEpoR expression, hEpoR expression in the fetal liver decreased during development to undetectable levels at birth as the site of hematopoiesis switches to the spleen and bone marrow. In the adult, the level of EpoR expression in the bone marrow was 7.1 fg/μg of RNA for hEpoR and 3.1 fg per μg of RNA for mEpoR. EpoR transcripts in the spleen was determined to be 4.4 fg/μg of RNA for hEpoR and 11.7 fg/μg of RNA for mEpoR. Treatment with phenylhydrazine to induce hemolytic anemia and increase erythropoietic activity resulted in an increase in the percentage of reticulocytes from less than 2% to more than than 20% in both normal and transgenic mice. Accompanying the increase in spleen size by 3–4-fold was an increase in endogenous mEpoR gene and hEpoR transgene expression in response to the induced anemic stress (Fig. 4). In contrast, no EpoR expression was observed before or after phenylhydrazine treatment in thymus, a tissue related to lymphoid activity.Figure 4Induction of erythropoietin receptor expression by anemic stress. EpoR expression was determined using RT-PCR analysis of RNA harvested from spleen and brain tissues of untreated or control (C) and phenylhydrazine treated (Φ) hEpoR transgenic mice. The reaction products (top panel) were analyzed by blot hybridization (center panel) as described in the text to confirm the identities of the mEpoR and hEpoR specific bands. Results for endogenous mEpoR and the hEpoR transgene are shown in lanes 1–8 and lanes 9–20, respectively. Analyses of two untreated mice are included in lanes 1, 5, 9, 13, and 17 and lanes 2, 6, 10, 14, and 18, respectively. Analyses of two treated mice are included in lanes 3, 7, 11, 15, and 19 and lanes 4, 8, 12, 16, and 20,respectively. For hEpoR expression in brain tissue, results obtained by increasing the cycle number from 35 (for lanes 1-16) to 40 (for lanes 17–20) are also shown. Determination of S16 was used as a control (bottom panel). Marker lanes are indicated (M).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) We have previously reported that in spite of regulated hematopoietic tissue expression, a 15-kb hEpoR transgene was not developmentally regulated in the brain (16Liu Z.Y. Chin K. Noguchi C.T. Dev. Biol. 1994; 166: 159-169Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). In contrast, the endogenous mEpoR was expressed in embryonic brain tissues at day 10.5 at a level close to that in adult spleen and bone marrow and then decreased with development, dropping by more than 3 orders of magnitude at birth. These data suggested that the hEpoR transgene did not contain regulatory elements to provide control of brain expression and/or that developmental control of EpoR in brain may be different between human and mouse. In the present study, we found that the more distal flanking regions of the hEpoR gene were able to provide regulation in both hematopoietic tissue and brain. An 80-kb human EpoR gene fragment was used to produce transgenic mice; transgenic mice were mated and embryos harvested at different days of development. RNA isolated from brains of 10.5-day embryos exhibited transgene expression of 1.5 fg/μg of RNA (Fig.5). This level of expression persisted through day 12.5 and then started to decrease with the decrease in endogenous mEpoR expression. Although the 80-kb hEpoR transgene was not able to provide the high level of EpoR expression observed for the endogenous mEpoR gene in the early embryonic (day 10.5) brain, these data suggest that the additional distal flanking genomic sequences provided much of the regulation required for developmental control of brain expression not observed previously. To determine whether the 5′ DNA region flanking the first exon of hEpoR could direct reporter gene activity in non-hematopoietic tissues in vivo and to identify the possible site of hEpoR expression in the early embryonic brain, the hEpoR promoter linked to a β-galactosidase reporter gene was used to generate transgenic mice. The reporter gene construct contained an hEpoR promoter fragment extending 5′ from the ATG start site for transcription to −1778 bp 5′ of the transcription start site. Mice testing positive for the transgene were mated with normal mice. Embryos were harvested at day 9.5 postcoitus, and whole embryos were stained for β-galactosidase activity. Staining was observed in the ventral neural tube in two independently generated transgenic mouse lines in the region extending from the anterior to posterior tegmental neuroepithelium, the ventral isthmal neuroepithelium, and the pontine neuroepithelium (Fig.6). However, not all of the transgenic lines exhibited staining at embryonic day 9.5. No staining of the neural tube was observed in normal mice or in transgenic mice containing a shorter promoter that extend to only 150 bp 5′ from the transcription start site (Fig. 6). These data suggest that the promoter region between −1778 and −150 bp is necessary to drive transgene expression in the neural tube. To confirm that the staining pattern was relevant to EpoR gene expression, tissue corresponding to the β-galactosidase stained region was dissected from normal mice and mice containing the 80-kb hEpoR transgene. Both mEpoR and hEpoR transcripts were detected and quantified by RT-PCR. The levels of hEpoR transgene and mEpoR gene expression in the neural tube were comparable to that in adult hematopoietic tissue and were 5.1 fg/μg of RNA compared with 3.0 fg/μg of RNA for the endogenous mEpoR gene. The expression of EpoR in neural tube at day 9.5 may be the origin of the embryonic brain expression detected later in development. Our initial screening for EpoR expression in the adult brain showed no detectable transcripts, which suggests that if EpoR is expressed, it is at levels less than 0.1 fg/mg of RNA as determined by the quantitative PCR procedure described above. We increased the sensitivity of our analysis and reexamined RNA isolated from normal and transgenic mouse brain tissue. By increasing the PCR cycle number from 30 to 35, we were able to detect mEpoR expression. The PCR product was digested by restriction enzymes XhoI and Xmn1 and hybridized to mEpoR specific probe to confirm its identity (Fig. 7). This level of expression corresponded to more than 2 orders of magnitude lower than that seen in adult spleen. Comparable results were also obtained for expression in adult brain of the 80-kb hEpoR transgene. As a negative control, increasing the PCR cycle number showed no mEpoR or hEpoR expression in adult liver. No PCR products were observed when reverse transcriptase was omitted from the reaction mixture. The murine system has provided unique insights into the regulation of erythropoiesis by EpoR. Null mutations of both Epo and EpoR gene in mice demonstrated that Epo and EpoR were crucial for definitive erythropoiesis and that interrupted erythroid development in fetal liver was lethal around embryonic day 13 (1Wu H. Liu X. Jaenisch R. Lodish H.F. Cell. 1995; 83: 59-67Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (851) Google Scholar, 2Lin C.S. Lim S.K.V.D.A. Costantini F. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 154-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar). We used the transgenic mouse to examine the developmental regulation of the human EpoR gene. We demonstrated that in transgenic mice produced from the 80-kb hEpoR transgene, appropriate expression of hEpoR was recovered in hematopoietic tissues. The highest level of EpoR expression for the endogenous mEpoR gene and the 80-kb hEpoR transgene occurred in hematopoietic embryonic tissue. The levels of mEpoR and hEpoR RNA transcripts in yolk sac and fetal liver were 1.5–2 orders of magnitude higher than the levels observed in adult spleen and bone marrow. We have previously shown that a 15-kb human EpoR gene fragment provided expression but at low levels in adult hematopoietic tissues of transgenic mice (16Liu Z.Y. Chin K. Noguchi C.T. Dev. Biol. 1994; 166: 159-169Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). The similarity between endogenous mEpoR gene and hEpoR transgene expression in these tissues suggests that the 80-kb hEpoR transgenic mouse can be used to examine the developmental expression of hEpoR in hematopoietic tissue. In addition to detection of EpoR in known hematopoietic tissues, we detected endogenous mEpoR expression in the embryonic mouse brain at high levels, which was down-regulated with development (16Liu Z.Y. Chin K. Noguchi C.T. Dev. Biol. 1994; 166: 159-169Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). We have now shown that endogenous mEpoR was expressed in the adult brain, but at a level of about 2 orders of magnitude lower than that observed in the embryonic brain at day 10.5. The mEpoR and hEpoR transgene expression we observed in day 9.5 neural tube may be the origin of the EpoR expression detected in the brain at day 10.5 and later and may be related to detection of EpoR localized to the neural plate earlier in development (26Yasuda Y. Nagao M. Okano M. Masuda S. Sasaki R. Konishi H. Tanimura T. Dev. Growth Differ. 1993; 35: 711-722Crossref Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Specific localized binding of radiolabeled Epo to adult mouse brain sections has also been detected (27Digicaylioglu M. Bichet S. Marti H.H. Wenger R.H. Rivas L.A. Bauer C. Gassmann M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 3717-3720Crossref PubMed Scopus (431) Google Scholar). These observations suggest that the EpoR message detected in the rodent brain is developmentally regulated and processed into Epo binding protein. The 15-kb hEpoR genomic DNA fragment contained much of the homology between the murine and human EpoR genes within the coding region and extending 5′ to the GATA-1 binding site in the EpoR proximal promoter (28Youssoufian H. Zon L.I. Orkin S.H.A.D.D.A. Lodish H.F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 3675-3682Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar, 29Chin K. Oda N. Shen K. Noguchi C.T. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 3041-3049Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Further 5′ are species-specific repetitive elements that have been associated with negative regulation (30Maouche L. Cartron J.P. Chretien S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 338-346Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar, 31Youssoufian H. Lodish H.F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 98-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar, 32Youssoufian H. Blood. 1994; 83: 1428-1435Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, this human EpoR transgene was expressed at a low level in an unregulated manner in embryonic and adult brain. To include additional regulatory elements, an expanded 80-kb hEpoR genomic fragment was isolated and used to produce transgenic mice. Analysis of the 80-kb hEpoR transgene demonstrated that embryonic brain expression for both hEpoR and mEpoR decreased in a parallel fashion with further development dropping by about 2 orders of magnitude or more in the adult. The behavior of the hEpoR promoter/β-galactosidase reporter gene constructs suggested that the region from −1778 to −150 bp of the transcription start site was necessary to provide staining of β-galactosidase in the embryonic day 9.5 neural tube. RNA prepared from neural tube of normal and hEpoR transgenic mice at embryonic day 9.5 also showed high level expression of mEpoR and hEpoR and may be the origin of EpoR brain expression observed during development. EpoR expression has been observed in the central nervous system of mid-trimester human fetuses (33Li Y. Juul S.E. Morris-Wiman J.A. Calhoun D.A. Christensen R.D. Pediatr. Res. 1996; 40: 376-380Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar) and in brain of adult monkeys (34Marti H.H. Wenger R.H. Rivas L.A. Straumann U. Digicaylioglu M. Henn V. Yonekawa Y. Bauer C. Gassmann M. Eur. J. Neurosci. 1996; 8: 666-676Crossref PubMed Scopus (493) Google Scholar). GATA-1 is an important transactivator of EpoR expression in hematopoietic cells (28Youssoufian H. Zon L.I. Orkin S.H.A.D.D.A. Lodish H.F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 3675-3682Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar, 29Chin K. Oda N. Shen K. Noguchi C.T.

Although GATA-1 is not expressed in the brain, the brain expresses significant levels of GATA-3, which is capable of binding similar DNA motifs. Targeted disruption of the GATA-3 gene causes severe abnormalities in the embryonic nervous system and in fetal liver hematopoiesis (36Pandolfi P.P. Roth M.E. Karis A. Leonard M.W. Dzierzak E. Grosveld F.G. Engel J.D. Lindenbaum M.H. Nat. Genet. 1995; 11: 40-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (499) Google Scholar). The developmental expression of EpoR expression observed for the endogenous mEpoR gene and the hEpoR transgenes suggests that EpoR expression in non-hematopoietic cells may share some common regulatory controls with hematopoietic expression, but requires additional cis-acting DNA elements. Although the physiological function in vivo of EpoR expression in non-hematopoietic cells is not yet known, it may be directly related to EpoR activity reported for endothelial cells. Epo stimulation of cultured endothelial cells increases protein phosphorylation and induces nuclear translocation of STAT-5 (37Haller H. Christel C. Dannenberg L. Thiele P. Lindschau C. Luft F.C. Kidney Int. 1996; 50: 481-488Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Epo can also increase intracellular calcium and increase endothelin-1 secretion (38Carlini R.G. Gupta A. Liapis H. Rothstein M. J. Cardiovasc. Pharmacol. 1995; 26: 889-892Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar) in a dose-dependent manner (39Nitta K. Uchida K. Kimata N. Kawashima A. Yumura W. Nihei H. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 1995; 293: 491-494Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). The involvement of EpoR in endothelial cells may originate from the close relationship between hematopoiesis and vasculogenesis (40Flamme I. Risau W. Development. 1992; 116: 435-439Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and between hematopoiesis and angiogenesis later in development (41Asahara T. Murohara T. Sullivan A. Silver M. van der Zee R. Li T. Witzenbichler B. Schatteman G. Isner J.M. Science. 1997; 275: 964-967Crossref PubMed Scopus (7664) Google Scholar). Stimulation of EpoR in the brain may not require Epo to cross the blood-brain barrier, as oxygen-dependent Epo production has been observed in cultured rat astrocytes (42Masuda S. Okano M. Yamagishi K. Nagao M. Ueda M. Sasaki R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 19488-19493Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and that Epo expression in the adult brain can be up-regulated by hypoxia in mice (27Digicaylioglu M. Bichet S. Marti H.H. Wenger R.H. Rivas L.A. Bauer C. Gassmann M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 3717-3720Crossref PubMed Scopus (431) Google Scholar) and monkeys (34Marti H.H. Wenger R.H. Rivas L.A.

Expression of EpoR in non-hematopoietic cells may allow for Epo activation in the early embryo to stimulate proliferation or to control apoptosis as those cells differentiate and mature."

On the other hand, isoform II (PAF-AH(II)) is a 40-kDa monomer and has an amino acid sequence that exhibits a 41% identity with that of plasma PAF-AH (7Tjoelker L.W. Wilder C. Eberhardt C.

Furthermore, PAF-AH(II), as well as plasma PAF-AH, has the ability to hydrolyze short chain phospholipids and oxidized fragments of polyunsaturated fatty acids at the sn-2 position as well as PAF while isoform Ib behaves as a specific acetylhydrolase (11Hattori K.

Although we previously demonstrated that PAF-AH(II) has a property distinct from isoform Ib with respect to its polypeptide composition, tissue distribution, and substrate specificity, the function of PAF-AH(II) has not, as yet, been elucidated. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) are produced in many physiological intracellular reactions, and they can spontaneously oxidize unsaturated fatty acyl chains in membrane phospholipids to produce toxic phospholipid hydroperoxides and a variety of oxidized phospholipids, both of which cause various cell damages (13Itabe H.

Recently, phospholipid hydroperoxide glutathione peroxidase, which has the ability to interact directly with peroxidized phospholipids and reduce their hydroperoxidized moieties, was demonstrated in mammalian tissues and cells (18Ursini F.

However, other forms of oxidized phospholipids and even the reaction products of phospholipid hydroperoxide glutathione peroxidase have to be further catabolized in vivo. It has long been believed that oxidized phospholipids produced in cells are preferentially hydrolyzed by cellular phospholipase A2. The molecular nature of the enzyme responsible for this activity, however, remains to be determined. Plasma PAF-AH, which also has the ability to catabolize oxidized phospholipids (21Stafforini D.M.

In this paper, we would like to propose that intracellular PAF-AH(II) may function as an antioxidant phospholipase in the cell, most probably by hydrolyzing oxidized phospholipids. 1-O-hexadecyl-2-[3H-acetyl]-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine and [3H]myristic acid were purchased from NEN Life Science Products. Unlabeled PAF was from Bachem Feichemikalien AG (Bubendorf, Switzerland). Horseradish peroxidase- and fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated goat anti-mouse Ig polyclonal antibodies were obtained from Amersham Life Science, Inc.. All other materials used were from Wako Pure Chemical (Osaka, Japan). A monoclonal antibody against bovine PAF-AH(II) was raised as follows. Immunization was performed by intrasplenic injection as described previously (27Spits M. Methods Enzymol. 1986; 121: 33-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Briefly, about 40 μg of antigen was resolved by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) using a 12% acrylamide gel and transferred to a 0.45-μm mashed nitrocellulose membrane. The membrane was then stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue, and the band containing the antigen was cut out and homogenized in 800 μl of saline. Then 10 μg of antigen was injected into the spleens of BALB/c mice through a 26 gauge needle. After the intrasplenic injection, three further immunizations were performed by peritoneal injection every two weeks. Three days after the final immunization, 1.6 × 108 spleen cells were fused with 4.0 × 107 PAI mouse myeloma cells by treatment with 0.5 ml of 50% polyethylene glycol 1500 (Boeringer Mannheim) for 1 min at 37 °C. The cells were then washed with 10 ml of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% fetal bovine serum and interleukin-6 as described previously (28Tamatani T. Miyasaka M. Int. Immmunol. 1990; 2: 165-171Crossref PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar). The cells were grown in 96-well culture plates. Ten days after fusion, the supernatants of the hybridomas were tested for production of anti-PAF-AH(II) antibodies using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Positive cells were cloned by limiting dilution. One of the established monoclonal antibodies was named 7F7. The test samples were resolved by SDS-PAGE on a 12% acrylamide gel by the method of Laemmli (29Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207211) Google Scholar) and blotted onto a nitrocellulose membrane. The membrane was blocked with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) containing 5% skim milk for 2 h at room temperature and then incubated in the cultured supernatant of the 7F7 hybridoma diluted 1/1,000 in PBS containing 0.05% skim milk for 12 h at 4 °C. The filter was washed 4 times with PBS containing 0.05% Tween 20 (T-PBS) and incubated for 1 h with a horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse antibody diluted 1/2,000 in PBS containing 5% skim milk. After washing the filter 6 times with T-TBS, the blots were detected by an enhanced chemiluminescence method using an ECLTM Western blotting Detection Set from HyperfilmTM-ECL (Amersham Life Science, Inc.). MDBK cells (108) (30Madin S.H. Darby N.B. Proc. Soc. Exp. Biol. Med. 1958; 98: 574-576Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar) were incubated in Ham's F-12 medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum with 100 μCi/ml [3H]myristic acid at 37 °C for 12 h. Then the cells were washed 3 times with ice-cold PBS and detached with 1 mm EDTA-0.25% trypsin. The cells were washed twice with PBS, suspended in 500 μl of PBS, and disrupted by sonication in a vessel surrounded by ice for three periods of 10 s at 10-s intervals using a Branson sonifier. After the cell lysate was centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 1 h, the resulting supernatant was immunoprecipitated with 200 μl of protein G-Sepharose CL-6B (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.) conjugated with the anti-PAF-AH(II) monoclonal antibody. The immunoprecipitated sample was resolved by SDS-PAGE on a 12.5% acrylamide gel and blotted onto a nitrocellulose membrane. PAF-AH(II) was detected by immunoblotting as described above. Furthermore, PAF-AH(II) was detected also by fluorography. The same nitrocellulose membrane was impregnated with EN3HANCE (NEN Life Science Products) and exposed to Kodak XRP-5 film for 3 days at −80 °C, using an intensifying screen. MDBK cells were treated with or without 100 μm tert-butylhydroperoxide (t-BuOOH) for 3 h. Immunofluorescence staining was carried out as described previously (31Matsuzawa A. Murakami M. Atsmi G. Imai K. Prados P. Inoue K. Kudo I. Biochem. J. 1996; 318: 701-709Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Briefly, these cells were washed once with PBS and fixed with 3.6% paraformaldehyde at 4 °C followed by permiabilization with 0.1% Triton X-100 for 1 min at room temperature. After blocking with PBS containing 3% bovine serum albumin (BSA) for 2 h at room temperature, they were incubated with the anti-PAF-AH(II) monoclonal antibody diluted 1/2,000 in PBS containing 0.1% BSA for 12 h at 4 °C. The cells were washed 4 times with PBS containing 0.1% BSA and then incubated with a fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated goat anti-mouse Ig polyclonal antibody diluted 1/1,000 in PBS containing 0.1% BSA for 2 h at room temperature. After the samples were embedded, immunostaining patterns were visualized using a fluorescent microscope and photographed at × 400 magnification. MDBK cells or CHO-K1 transformants (107 cells) were treated with various oxidants and antioxidants as indicated in the legends to Figs. 3, 4, and 5. Cells washed with PBS were suspended in 200 ml of ice-cold PBS and disrupted by sonication in a vessel surrounded by ice for three periods of 10 s at 10-s intervals using a Branson sonifier. After centrifugation of the cell lysate at 100,000 × g for 1 h at 4 °C to separate the cytosol (supernatant) and membrane (pellet) fractions, the resulting pellet was resuspended in 200 μl of ice-cold PBS using sonication to disrupt it. Both the cytosol and membrane fractions (20 μl) were analyzed by immunoblotting with the anti-PAF-AH(II) monoclonal antibody as described above.Figure 4Translocation of PAF-AH(II) from membranes to cytosol in MDBK cells treated with an antioxidant.

G418-resistant clones were isolated by limiting dilution and screened for expression of PAF-AH(II) using immunofluorescence staining and immunoblot analysis. Cell death analysis was carried out as described previously (16Hockenbery D.M. Oltvai Z.N. Yin X.-M. Milliman C.L. Korsmeyer S.J.

Briefly, transformants were treated with 300 μm t-BuOOH for 3 h and then cultured in normal medium for the times indicated in Fig. 5, b-d. Cell viability was determined using an MTT (3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide) assay system (33Mosmann T. J. Immunol. Methods. 1983; 65: 55-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (46496) Google Scholar). The cells (107 cells) treated with t-BuOOH were lysed, and DNA extraction from the lysate was performed using an IsoQuick kit (MicroProbe). Electrophoresis was carried out on a 2% agarose gel. The DNA was stained with ethidium bromide and visualized with the aid of a UV transilluminator. The N-terminal sequences of both bovine and human PAF-AH(II) matched with the consensus sequences of N-myristoylated proteins (NH2-Met-Gly-X-X-X-Ser-) that contain a penultimate glycine, a potential acceptor for a myristoyl moiety (Fig. 1 A) (12Hattori K.

The possibility that PAF-AH(II) is N-myristoylated was tested by incubating MDBK cells that endogenously express PAF-AH(II) with [3H]myristate. As shown in Fig. 1 B, PAF-AH(II), detected by immunoblotting, is a radioactively labeled protein that was immunoprecipitated with a PAF-AH(II)-specific monoclonal antibody. This result indicates that PAF-AH(II) is an N-myristoylated lipid-modified phospholipase that has never been found among lipases and phospholipases before. Some myristoylated proteins are reversibly attached to the membrane. Therefore, the intracellular location of PAF-AH(II) was examined using immunofluorescence microscopy. Fig.2 A shows the image obtained after treatment of MDBK cells with the anti-PAF-AH(II) antibody. It can be seen that PAF-AH(II) tends to collect on the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) near the nuclear envelope in addition to the cytosol. MDBK cells were homogenized and centrifuged to separate the cytosol and membrane fractions. Immunoblot analysis of PAF-AH(II) revealed that the enzyme was distributed equally between the membrane fraction and cytosol fractions (Fig. 3, A and B, and Fig. 4, A and B, control lane).Figure 2Immunofluorescence staining of MDBK cells with an anti-PAF-AH(II) monoclonal antibody. A, in resting MDBK cells, PAF-AH(II) collects on the ER near the nuclear envelope and in the cytosol. B, in MDBK cells treated with 100 μm t-BuOOH, PAF-AH(II) is observed all over the ER in the cell.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The substrate specificity of PAF-AH(II) resembles that of plasma PAF-AH, which can hydrolyze the oxidatively fragmented fatty acyl chains that are attached to phospholipid molecules as well as PAF (12Hattori K.

Chem. 1987; 262: 4215-4222Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The majority of plasma PAF-AH is associated with plasma lipoproteins such as low and high density lipoproteins (24Stafforini D.M. McIntyre T.M. Carter M.E. Prescott S.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 4215-4222Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 36Stafforini D.M. Prescott S.M. McIntyre T.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 4223-4230Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It has been postulated that one of the physiological functions of plasma PAF-AH is to degrade the oxidized phospholipids produced in circulating lipoproteins (23Stremler K.E. Stafforini D.M. Prescott S.M. Zimmerman G.A. McIntyre T.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 5331-5334Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We investigated the potential function of PAF-AH(II) on oxidative stress. Although in the resting state PAF-AH(II) was found equivalently in both the cytosol and membranes, t-BuOOH caused, dose-dependently, a translocation of PAF-AH(II) from cytosol to membranes, as shown in Fig. 3 A. The translocation was evident at 50 μm t-BuOOH, and most of the enzyme was translocated to membranes at 100 μm t-BuOOH. The translocation occurred rapidly, within 20 min (Fig. 3 B). Similarly, other oxidants, such as H2O2 with a catalase inhibitor (aminotriazole), diamide, or cumene hydroperoxide, caused the translocation of PAF-AH(II) from cytosol to membranes (Fig. 3 C). Fig.2 B shows the image obtained using immunofluorescence microscopy of MDBK cells treated with t-BuOOH. In the resting cell, PAF-AH(II) collected on the ER near the nuclear envelope (Fig. 2 A), but following treatment with t-BuOOH, the enzyme was observed all over the ER within the cell (Fig.2 B). On the other hand, PAF-AH(II) translocated from membranes to cytosol in a dose-dependent manner following incubation of the cells with the antioxidant propyl gallate (Fig.4 A). This translocation took at least 6 h, in contrast to the fast oxidant-induced translocation from cytosol to membranes. To our knowledge, PAF-AH(II) is the first example of an enzyme that changes its subcellular localization in response to antioxidant treatment. These observations demonstrate that PAF-AH(II) translocates between the cytosol and intracellular membranes in response to a redox state of the cell. It is possible that oxidants elicit a sustained translocation of PAF-AH(II) from cytosol to membranes to hydrolyze and eliminate the oxidized phospholipids produced in the cells. If PAF-AH(II) translocates to membranes in response to oxidative stress and functions to degrade oxidized phospholipids, it is expected that PAF-AH(II)-overexpressing cells will become resistant to an oxidative cytotoxicity. To test this hypothesis, expression plasmids, either alone or encoding full-length PAF-AH(II) cDNA, were transfected in CHO-K1 cells. In addition, a mutant protein in which Ser236, which corresponds to the catalytic active serine residue of PAF-AH(II), was replaced with cysteine was expressed into CHO-K1 cells. Expression of PAF-AH(II) was confirmed by immunoblot analysis and measuring PAF-AH activity. In contrast to S236C mutant protein-expressing cells and control cells, wild-type PAF-AH(II)-overexpressing cells exhibited about a 20-fold higher level of PAF-AH activity than that of the controls (Fig.5 A, left panel). Even in the transformants (both wild-type PAF-AH(II) and S236C mutant protein-expressing cells), the recombinant proteins translocated from cytosol to membranes in response to oxidative stress in a similar manner to the endogenous enzyme (Fig. 5 B, right panel). As shown in Fig. 5 B, cell death of both control cells and S236C mutant transformants treated with 300 μm t-BuOOH occurred initially at a slow rate until 6 h, after which the rate accelerated suddenly. Phase-contrast microscopy revealed that control cells peeled off the culture dish substrata after about 4 h, and most of the detached and balloon-degenerated cells died after 8 h following treatment with t-BuOOH (Fig.5 C). Similar morphological changes were observed in S236C mutant transformants (data not shown). In contrast, overexpression of wild-type PAF-AH(II) in CHO-K1 cells treated with t-BuOOH resulted in a significant enhancement of viability compared with control cells even after 8 h (Fig. 5 B). The PAF-AH(II)-overexpressing cells were all alive and underwent no morphological changes (Fig. 5 C). Since this effect was not detected with S236C mutant protein-expressing cells (Fig.5 B), it suggested that catalytic activities were required to protect CHO-K1 cells against oxidative cytotoxicity. When DNA extracted from these cells was loaded into the wells of an agarose gel (Fig.5 D), control cells and S236C mutant transformants treated with t-BuOOH showed the characteristic DNA ladder formation of apoptosis. In contrast, in wild-type PAF-AH(II)-overexpressing cells, no evidence of DNA degradation was revealed. These observations suggest that the t-BuOOH-induced cell death occurs via apoptosis and that PAF-AH(II) can inhibit the apoptosis initiated by oxidative stress, such as that which results from treatment with t-BuOOH. In this paper, we have shown that intracellular PAF-AH(II) is a myristoylated enzyme and is distributed in both the cytosol and membrane fractions. Interestingly, in control MDBK cells, the enzyme is located in the ER membranes near the nuclear envelope. It is noteworthy that some of the enzymes that metabolize arachidonate, such as arachidonate-specific cytosolic phospholipase A2, cyclooxygenase-2 and 5-lipoxygenase, are attached to the ER and nuclear membranes (37Schievella A.R.

This indicates that phospholipids containing an arachidonate chain, which is highly susceptible to oxidation, might been enriched in those regions of the ER membranes. In general, the partitioning of myristoylated proteins between the cytosol and membrane compartments is modulated by a variety of signals that operate through covalent or non-covalent modifications (34McLaughlin S. Aderem A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1995; 20: 272-276Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (617) Google Scholar, 35Borgese N. Aggujaro D. Carrera P. Pietrini G. Bassetti M. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 1501-1513Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). It is well known that intracellular signaling pathways, such as the SAPK/JNK protein kinase cascade, operate during oxidative stress (40De'rijard B. Hibi M. Wu I.-H. Barrett T. Su B. Deng T. Karin M. Davis R.J. Cell. 1994; 76: 1025-1037Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2955) Google Scholar, 41Kyriakis J.M. Banerjee P. Nikolakaki E. Dai T. Rubie E.A. Ahmad M.F. Avruch J. Woodgett J.R.

PAF-AH(II) or the putative protein that modulates its distribution may receive such signaling to change its distribution. PAF-AH(II) may function as an antioxidant phospholipid hydrolase in mammalian cells. Unsaturated fatty acyl chains of phospholipids in membranes are highly susceptible to oxidation, and oxidized phospholipids are thought to be involved in some pathological processes, including disorganization of membrane structure and PAF-like proinflammatory action (13Itabe H. Kushi Y. Handa S. Inoue K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1988; 962: 8-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 14Patel K.D. Zimmerman G.A. Prescott S.M. McIntyre T.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 15168-15175Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It has generally been assumed that oxidized fatty acyl chains in phospholipids may be preferentially hydrolyzed in vivo. However, the biochemical properties of the enzyme responsible for this reaction remains unknown. We propose that intracellular PAF-AH(II) is a strong candidate for a scavenger of oxidized phospholipids, on the basis that the enzyme (i) hydrolyzes oxidized phospholipids effectively but not intact phospholipids in vitro (11Hattori K. Hattori M. Adachi H. Tsujimoto M. Arai H. Inoue K. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 22308-22313Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar), (ii) translocates between the cytosol and membranes in response to a redox state, and (iii) protects against oxidative stress when overexpressed in cells. There is compelling evidence to suggest that ROS such as H2O2 and lipid peroxides can induce apoptosis (15Jacobson M.D. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1996; 21: 83-86Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (731) Google Scholar, 16Hockenbery D.M. Oltvai Z.N. Yin X.-M. Milliman C.L. Korsmeyer S.J.

FEBS Lett. 1995; 365: 66-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Our data demonstrated that cells overexpressing PAF-AH(II) are resistant to ROS-induced apoptosis, suggesting that hydrolysis of oxidized phospholipids also protects against ROS-induced apoptosis. Overexpression of PAF-AH(II) may promote hydrolysis of the oxidized phospholipids produced during oxidative stress. In other words, the production or accumulation of oxidized phospholipids to a certain level in cells may be critical for initiating ROS-induced apoptosis. Recently, it has been suggested that loss of the mitochondrial membrane potential or disintegrity of the ER Ca2+ pool caused by disorganization of those membranes exposed to ROS induces a sequential activation of the apoptotic cascade (43Shimizu S. Eguchi Y. Kamiike W. Waguri S. Uchiyama Y. Matsuda H. Tsujimoto Y. Oncogene. 1996; 13: 21-29PubMed Google Scholar, 44Distelhorst C.W. Lam M. McCormick T.S. Oncogene. 1996; 12: 21-29Google Scholar). PAF-AH(II) may function as an antidote for apoptosis by preventing the accumulation of oxidized phospholipids, which may induce membrane perturbation. Another idea is that certain types of oxidized phospholipids might be involved as second messengers in the signal transduction pathways leading to apoptosis. Further study on this mechanism will increase significantly our understanding of aging and disease associated with ROS-induced apoptosis."

The first order rate constants for inactivation (k 2) of the enzyme varied over a much smaller range, ranging from 0.12 to 0.18 to 0.28 min−1 for the Se-, thio-, and O-lactones, respectively. Mutually exclusive labeling of the enzyme by [1-14C]β-aminopropionitrile, [U-14C]phenylhydrazine, or [35S]homocysteine thiolactone was observed. These labeling results, together with the closely similar perturbations of the near UV-visible spectra of lysyl oxidase and of a model of its lysine tyrosylquinone cofactor by the thiolactone, indicate that the lactones likely derivatize and reduce the active site carbonyl cofactor. Substitution with deuterium at the α-carbon of the thiolactone caused a deuterium kinetic isotope effect on k 2 of 3.2 ± 0.2, consistent with the involvement of rate-limiting α-proton abstraction during lactone-induced inactivation of the enzyme. The activities of plasma amine oxidase and diamine oxidase were only minimally reduced at concentrations of the sulfur or selenium lactones that fully inhibited lysyl oxidase. Thus, these lactones constitute a new category of mechanism-based inactivators selective for lysyl oxidase. Further, these results may relate to the development of connective tissue defects seen in homocystinuria.

Lysyl oxidase (EC 1.4.3.13) is unique among the mammalian copper amine oxidases by catalyzing a critical post-translational modification essential to the biogenesis of connective tissue matrices. This enzyme initiates covalent cross-linking between and within the molecular units of elastin and of collagen by oxidizing peptidyl lysine in these proteins to peptidyl α-aminoadipic-δ-semialdehyde (1Pinnell S.R. Martin G.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1968; 61: 708-716Crossref PubMed Scopus (426) Google Scholar, 2Kagan H.M. Mecham R.P. Biology of Extracellular Matrix. 1. Academic Press, Orlando, FL1986: 321-328Google Scholar). The peptidyl aldehyde can then condense with neighboring ε-amino groups or peptidyl aldehydes to form the covalent cross-linkages found in fibrillar collagen and elastin. Lysyl oxidase contains a tightly bound copper cofactor as well as a covalently bound carbonyl prosthetic group recently identified as lysine tyrosylquinone (3Wang S.X. Mure M. Medzihradszky K.F. Burlingame A.L. Brown D.E. Dooley D.M. Smith A.J. Kagan H.M. Klinman J.P. Science. 1996; 273: 1078-1084Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar). Lysyl oxidase catalyzes primary amine oxidation through a ping pong bi ter kinetic mechanism (4Williamson P.R. Kagan H.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 8196-8201Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 5Williamson P.R. Kagan H.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 9477-9482Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Following initial Schiff base formation with the LTQ 1The abbreviations used are: LTQ, lysine tyrosylquinone; BAPN, β-aminopropionitrile fumarate; HCTL, homocysteine thiolactone; HSL, homoserine lactone; LO, lysyl oxidase; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; SeHCL, selenohomocysteine lactone; HPLC, high performance liquid chromatography. cofactor, the bound substrate undergoes rate-limiting, general base-facilitated α-proton abstraction (6Gacheru S.N. Trackman P.C. Kagan H.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 16704-16708Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Electrons migrating from the resulting carbanion reduce the carbonyl cofactor, followed by hydrolysis of the product imine intermediate to release the aldehyde product. The reduced enzyme, retaining the amino function of the substrate, is reoxidized by molecular oxygen to produce hydrogen peroxide and ammonia, regenerating the oxidized enzyme and completing the catalytic cycle. The role of lysyl oxidase in the growth and repair of connective tissues has been well documented. Markedly increased levels of LO activity are observed in a variety of fibrotic diseases in which excess collagen is deposited in the affected tissues, as in models of atherosclerosis, hypertension, and liver and pulmonary fibrosis (2Kagan H.M. Mecham R.P. Biology of Extracellular Matrix. 1. Academic Press, Orlando, FL1986: 321-328Google Scholar). The possibility that the development of fibrosis may be restricted by the specific suppression of lysyl oxidase activity has stimulated the search for selective and potent inhibitors of this enzyme. These efforts have identified mechanism-based and ground-state inhibitors, including β-substituted haloethylamines (7Tang S. Simpson D.E. Kagan H.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 975-979Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), benzylamines substituted with electronegative para-substituents (8Williamson P.R. Kagan H.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 14520-14524Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and 1,2-diamines (9Gacheru S.N. Trackman P.C. Calaman S.D. Greenaway F.T. Kagan H.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 12963-12969Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), each of which appear to inhibit as adducts of the carbonyl cofactor. In the present report, we describe our observations that homocysteine thiolactone and the oxygen and selenium lactone analogues of this compound are active site-directed, irreversible inhibitors of lysyl oxidase. The selenium and sulfur lactones are the most potent of these and are selective for lysyl oxidase, among mechanistically similar copper-dependent mammalian amine oxidases tested in the present study. Notably, HCTL occurs in mammalian systems as a metabolic by-product of methyl transfer from S-adenosylhomocysteine. Moreover, the accumulation of HCTL has been suggested to be related to mechanisms of carcinogenesis and atherogenesis (10McCully K.S. Ann. Clin. Lab. Sci. 1994; 24: 27-59PubMed Google Scholar, 11Tsai J.-C. Perrela M.A. Yoshizumi M. Hsieh C.-M. Haber E. Schlegel R. Lee M.-E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Biochimie. 1986; 68: 723-730Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar, 14McCully K.S. Cancer Res. 1976; 36: 3198-3202PubMed Google Scholar). Elucidation of interactions of these compounds with lysyl oxidase should increase options for the design of antifibrotic agents and aid in the understanding of the biological effects of HCTL. Homocysteine thiolactone hydrochloride, homocysteine, methionine, seleno-dl-methionine, d-homoserine, homoserine lactone hydrochloride, homovanillic acid, horseradish peroxidase, diaminopentane dihydrochloride, BAPN, pyridoxal hydrochloride, [14C]NaCN, deuterated water, porcine kidney diamine oxidase, and bovine plasma amine oxidase were obtained from Sigma. Phenylhydrazine hydrochloride and Darco G-60 activated carbon were obtained from Fisher. Pyrroloquinoline quinone was a product of Fluka Chemical Corp. Hydrogen iodide, deuterium iodide, and β-bromoethylamine hydrobromide were products of Aldrich. [U-14C]Phenylhydrazine was purchased from ICN Pharmaceuticals, Irvine, CA. [35S]Methionine and [1-14C]iodoacetamide were purchased from Amersham Life Science. 4-Ethyl-5-(butylamino)-1,2-benzoquinone (Fig. 1) served as a model of the LTQ carbonyl cofactor of lysyl oxidase and was generously provided by Dr. Judith P. Klinman of the Departments of Chemistry and Molecular and Cell Biology, University of California, Berkeley. Lysyl oxidase was isolated from calf aorta as a co-purified mixture of four individual variants (15Williams M.A. Kagan H.M. Anal. Biochem. 1985; 149: 430-437Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar) resolving as a single band at 32 kDa by SDS-PAGE (16Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207521) Google Scholar). The individual ionic forms exhibit common structural and apparently identical mechanistic features (17Kagan H.M. Sullivan K.A. Olsson T.A. Cronlund A.L. Biochem. J. 1979; 177: 203-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 18Sullivan K.A. Kagan H.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 13520-13526Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), further noted by the presence of a single dipeptide sequence containing the carbonyl cofactor, which was isolated from a proteolytic digest of the mixture of variants of bovine aorta lysyl oxidase (3Wang S.X. Mure M. Medzihradszky K.F. Burlingame A.L. Brown D.E. Dooley D.M. Smith A.J. Kagan H.M. Klinman J.P. Science. 1996; 273: 1078-1084Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar). Lysyl oxidase activity was assayed either against 125,000 cpm of a recombinant tropoelastin substrate expressed and labeled withl-[4,5-3H]lysine in a bacterial expression system (19Bedell-Hogan D. Trackman P. Abrams W. Rosenbloom J. Kagan H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 10345-10350Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) or against 500,000 cpm ofl-[4,5-3H]lysine-labeled chick calvarial collagen substrate (20Siegel R.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1974; 71: 4826-4830Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). Tritiated water formed by lysyl oxidase action was isolated by vacuum distillation and quantified by liquid scintillation spectrometry. Enzyme activity was also assayed against nonpeptidyl amine substrates by a horseradish peroxidase-coupled fluorescence method (21Trackman P.C. Zoski C.G. Kagan H.M. Anal. Biochem. 1981; 113: 336-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Error ranges for all assay data, including those used to express kinetic isotope effects, were determined as the 90% confidence intervals from unweighted linear regression analyses according to Mendenhall (22Mendenhall W. Introduction to Probability Statistics. Duxbury Press, North Scituate, MA1975: 250-276Google Scholar). Porcine kidney diamine oxidase and bovine plasma amine oxidase activities were determined at 37 °C at pH 7.2 or 7.4, respectively, by a horseradish peroxidase-coupled fluorescence assay modified from that used for lysyl oxidase (21Trackman P.C. Zoski C.G. Kagan H.M. Anal. Biochem. 1981; 113: 336-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Reaction mixtures contained enzyme, 2.5 mm putrescine or benzylamine for assay of diamine oxidase or plasma amine oxidase, respectively, 40 μg of horseradish peroxidase, and 0.7 mm sodium homovanillate, in 16 mm potassium phosphate in a total volume of 2 ml. Background rates for each enzyme were determined in the presence of enzyme-saturating concentrations of inhibitors, i.e. 100 μm aminoguanidine for diamine oxidase (23Tang S.-S. Chichester C.O. Kagan H.M. Connect. Tiss. Res. 1989; 19: 93-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar) or 100 μm β-bromoethylamine for plasma amine oxidase (24Neumann R. Hevey R. Abeles R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1975; 250: 6362-6367Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). [1-14C]BAPN (55 mCi mmol−1) was synthesized from [14C]NaCN (55 mCi mmol−1) and β-bromoethylamine hydrobromide. [14C]Sodium cyanide (1 mCi; 0.02 mmol) was completely dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide, and then 1.3 μl (0.01 mmol) of triethylamine was added, followed by addition of 0.01 mmol of β-bromoethylamine in dimethyl sulfoxide. The reaction mixture was stirred gently at 37 °C for 4 days to assure complete reaction. An identical reaction mixture containing [12C]NaCN was incubated in parallel as a control to monitor the status of the reaction by thin layer chromatography on silica gel plates using 1-butanol:acetic acid:water (4:1:1) as the mobile phase. At the completion of the reaction, concentrated HCl was added to bring the pH to 4–5 to quench traces of [14C]NaCN remaining in the solution. A Dynamax-C8 preparative scale HPLC column (Rainin Instruments, Woburn, MA) was employed for the purification of the synthesized compound. Elution gradients were generated between Buffer A (0.05% trifluoroacetic acid in water) and Buffer B (0.03% trifluoroacetic acid in acetonitrile) at 25 °C at a flow rate of 2 ml/min. Peak elution was monitored at 232 nm. Optimal separation was achieved by the addition of Buffer B to 85% from 0% within 1 min at 25 min after application of the sample to the HPLC column as indicated by TLC and UV absorption. Radioactive BAPN eluted between 45 and 48 min and was detected by monitoring fractions for radioactivity and for the appearance of BAPN by TLC (R F value, 0.36), visualizing by reaction with ninhydrin. The final product was >95% pure, and the overall yield was 36%. [35S]HCTL was prepared from [35S]methionine (82 mCi mmol−1) according to Baernstein (25Baernstein H.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1934; 106: 451-456Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar) with a few modifications. Thus, 0.5 mCi ofl-[35S]methionine was added to 1.2 ml of 57% hydrogen iodide, and the mixture was refluxed at 137 °C for 3.5 h. The resulting solution was extracted several times with ether, the aqueous phase was diluted with water and then dried by lyophilization. The product was dissolved in hot absolute alcohol and then precipitated by addition of three volumes of pure ether. The precipitate was recovered by centrifugation and was further washed with ether. The purity of the product was confirmed by its absorption spectrum, by TLC, and by NMR spectroscopy. The overall yield was >90%. SeHCL was prepared by the same method, substituting selenomethionine for methionine. [α-2H]HCTL was synthesized in two steps designed to minimize the opening of the thiolactone ring. Racemic [α-2H]methionine was prepared froml-[α-1H]methionine according to Fujihara and Schowen (26Fujihara H. Schowen R.L. J. Org. Chem. 1984; 49: 2819-2820Crossref Scopus (23) Google Scholar). l-Methionine (10.7 mmol) was dissolved at room temperature in 10 ml of deuterium oxide containing 20 mmol of sodium hydroxide followed by the addition of 1.0 mmol of pyridoxal hydrochloride. The mixture was then autoclaved at 15 p.s.i. steam pressure for 30 min. The mixture was then cooled on ice and adjusted to pH 4 with HCl. Continued incubation at 0 °C resulted in the precipitation of crystalline material. The crystalline precipitate was washed with cold water and methanol by filtration, the product dissolved in water containing 50 mg of Darco G-60 activated carbon and filtered. Methanol was added, and the product was precipitated by incubation at 4 °C. The crystalline α-deuterated methionine was isolated by filtration and dried under vacuum. Deuterium incorporation was determined by NMR spectroscopy to be >90% of theory. Deuterated HCTL was then synthesized from the deuterated methionine and deuterium iodide (57%) according to the procedure for synthesizing [35S]HCTL (25Baernstein H.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1934; 106: 451-456Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar). Deuterium incorporation into the final product was estimated as >83% by NMR, and overall yield was >80%. When hydrogen iodide was employed in the second step, the deuterium incorporation decreased for unknown reasons. d-HSL was prepared by refluxing 250 mg ofd-homoserine in 2 ml of 2 n HCl for 2.5 h at 120 °C. At the completion of the reaction, the mixture was cooled to room temperature, diluted with water, and freeze-dried. The resulting solid was redissolved in a minimum amount of hot absolute alcohol, reprecipitated, and washed with pure ether. The stereochemical purity of the product was confirmed by circular dichroism, and the overall yield was >90%. SDS-PAGE was carried out in 0.1% SDS on slab gels (14 × 10 × 0.15 cm) of 12.5% acrylamide using the Tris/glycine buffer system of Laemmli (16Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207521) Google Scholar). Gels were stained for 30 min in 0.1% Coomassie Blue (R-250) and then destained with 40% methanol, 10% acetic acid. Gels were also treated with EN3HANCE™ (NEN Life Science Products) according to the protocol of the manufacturer before autoradiography. Lysyl oxidase was reacted with [1-14C]iodoacetamide by a modification of a published procedure (27Kagan H.M. Cai P. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 258: 122-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Purified bovine aorta lysyl oxidase (15 μg) was incubated at 37 °C in the presence or absence (control) of 80 μm HCTL in 16 mm potassium phosphate, 1.2m urea, pH 7.8, in a total volume of 35 μl for 2 h, fully inactivating the enzyme incubated in the presence of the inhibitor. Solid urea as well as 10 μl of 8 m urea, 0.22m NH4HCO3, pH 8.5, was then added, bringing the urea concentration to 8 m. The mixture was further incubated at 50 °C for 0.5 h to denature the protein. The mixture was cooled to room temperature, [1-14C]iodoacetamide was added at a 100-fold molar excess relative to disulfide bond content of the native protein (27Kagan H.M. Cai P. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 258: 122-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar), and the mixture was incubated at room temperature in the dark for 1 h. The samples were initially and intermittently flushed with nitrogen to prevent oxidation of free sulfhydryls that may have formed during the reaction. At the end of the reaction, loading buffer containing SDS in the absence of a disulfide reductant was added and the samples were subjected to SDS-PAGE immediately. LO (15 μg) was preincubated in the presence or absence of 100 μm BAPN, 80 μm phenylhydrazine, or 60 μm HCTL in 16 mm potassium phosphate buffer, 1.2 m urea, pH 7.8, at 37 °C for 1 h and then incubated for an additional 1 h with 60 μm [35S]HCTL (82 mCi mmol−1), 100 μm [1-14C]BAPN (55 mCi mmol−1), or 80 μm[U-14C]phenylhydrazine (7.5 mCi mmol−1), in the presence or absence of nonisotopic inhibitors as specified. Unbound ligands were removed by exhaustive dialysis against 2 murea, 16 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.8, followed by dialysis against distilled water. The dialyzed samples were concentrated in vacuo and resolved by SDS-PAGE and analyzed by autoradiography. UV absorption spectra were recorded at 25 °C in a Hewlett Packard model 8452A diode array spectrophotometer. HCTL (95 μm) was incubated with 44 μm LO in 16 mm potassium phosphate, 6m urea, 30 mm NaCl, pH 7.8, in a 1-cm cuvette. Scanning was initiated within 1 min of mixing of the enzyme and inhibitor and repeated every 90 s for 30 min. Difference spectra were obtained by subtracting the spectrum of the initial scan (equivalent to that of free enzyme) from those of the subsequent scans. The structures of the aminolactones and of other compounds used in these studies are shown in Fig. 1. Each of the aminolactones proved to inhibit the activity of purified lysyl oxidase. As shown (Fig.2), Lineweaver-Burk plots of initial rate assay data obtained in the presence and absence of varied concentrations of HCTL, SeHCL, or HSL yielded plots that intersect at the 1/v axis, indicative of competitive modes of inhibition in each case. The stereospecificity of the inhibition varied. Thus, thed- and l-isomers of HCTL were equally inhibitory, as indexed by the K I values determined from Lineweaver-Burk plots (28Lineweaver H. Burk D. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1934; 56: 658-666Crossref Scopus (8066) Google Scholar), whereas only the l-isomer of HSL inhibited the enzyme. The individual isomers of SeHCL were not available, and all data obtained with this compound were determined with the racemic mixture. The reversible or irreversible nature of the inhibition was determined by preincubating lysyl oxidase at 37 °C with varied concentrations of each lactone followed by assay for residual activity by the peroxidase-coupled assay method. Aliquots of the preincubated enzyme-inhibitor mixtures were sufficiently diluted to reduce lactone levels to noninhibitory concentrations in the assay. Each of the lactones caused the time-dependent loss of lysyl oxidase activity, which was not reversed by dilution. Graphing the data as the logarithm of the percent remaining activity against time of preincubation resulted in a series of linear plots with increasing negative slope at increasing inhibitor concentrations (data not shown), indicating that the development of irreversibility followed first order kinetics. Inhibition was also seen to be fully irreversible by exhaustive dialysis of enzyme preincubated with sufficient concentrations of these inhibitors to fully inhibit activity. Secondary plots of the t½ values derived from the first order plots against 1/[lactone] were also linear (Fig.3), consistent with site-saturation interactions between the inhibitors and the enzyme. This kinetic behavior is consistent with the mechanism summarized in Scheme I (29Walsh C. Enzymatic Reaction Mechanisms. W. H. Freeman and Co., San Francisco1979: 86-89Google Scholar), according to which irreversible inhibition develops by conversion of the lactone, initially bound in a reversible EI complex, to a covalently linked, inactivated enzyme-inhibitor complex ([EI]*, Scheme I). E+I↔k−1k+1[EI]→k+2[EI]*Scheme I The inhibitor dissociation constant, K I, is equal to k −1/k 1, whereas k 2 is the limiting first order rate constant for inactivation (29Walsh C. Enzymatic Reaction Mechanisms. W. H. Freeman and Co., San Francisco1979: 86-89Google Scholar). The first order rate of inactivation caused by 25 μm HCTL decreased 10-fold from 0.1 min−1 to 0.01 min−1 when 5 mm n-hexylamine, a productive substrate for lysyl oxidase, was present in the enzyme-inhibitor preincubation mixture, consistent with the competitive kinetics obtained (see Fig. 2) and with interaction of lactone inhibitors at the active site. Table I summarizes the constants derived from these kinetic studies with the three lactones. As seen, SeHCL has the greatest affinity for the enzyme, with a K I value 2.5- and 50-fold less than those of HCTL and HSL, respectively. In contrast, the k 2 values of the three lactones are similar, although there is a tendency for the value of k 2 to increase in the order SeHCL < HCTL < HSL. The second order rate constants (k 2/K I) are predominantly influenced by the K I values (Table I).Table ILactone constantsConstantHSL (O)HCTL (S)Se-HCL (Se)K I(L) 420 ± 56 μm21 ± 3 μm8.3 ± 2.2 μmk 2(L) 0.28 ± 0.01 min−10.18 ± 0.01 min−10.12 ± 0.03 min−1k 2/K I11 s−1m−1143 s−1m−1241 s−1m−1 Open table in a new tab As shown in the top panelof Fig. 3, substitution of the α-proton of HCTL with a deuteron has a marked effect on the t½ for inactivation, determined at 37 °C, and, thus, on the k 2value for this thiolactone. The k 2 at 37 °C for [α-1H]HCTL is 0.18 min−1, whereas that for [α-2H]HCTL, prepared and tested as the racemate, is 0.055 min−1, giving a kinetic isotope effect of 3.3-fold. The magnitude of this deuterium kinetic isotope effect is similar to the primary kinetic isotope effects found for k cat with productive substrates undergoing enzyme-catalyzed α-proton abstraction, including n-butylamine (D kcat, 4.3 at 37 °C; Ref. 9Gacheru S.N.

Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 44611-46056Google Scholar) D kcat values have been found reflecting α-proton abstraction steps in other copper-dependent amine oxidases, the values for lysyl oxidase suggest that additional rate contributing steps may exist that partially suppress the isotope effect of the isotope-sensitive proton abstraction step. In toto, these results point to the conclusion that the bound lactone undergoes α-proton abstraction as a rate-limiting step in the development of irreversible inhibition. The substitution of the α-proton with a deuteron did not change the apparent K I, as determined from Lineweaver-Burk plots of assays performed at 37 °C, resulting in aD K I of 1 and aD k 2/K I equal to that for D k 2. Thus, the K I for the protonated lactone was 21.6 ± 0.5 μm, whereas that for the deuterated lactone was 22 ± 0.7 μm. These K I values are presumed to reflect the true dissociation constants predominantly while largely neglecting the contribution of k 2. Thus,k 2 for HCTL is relatively slow (0.18 min−1), so that only a minor fraction (≪10%) of the available enzyme became irreversibly inactivated under the initial rate assay conditions employed and in the less than saturating concentration of HCTL used in the determination of K I. There was no apparent enzyme turnover as indexed by the lack of H2O2 production in incubations of lysyl oxidase with HCTL, indicating that HCTL is not a productive substrate for lysyl oxidase. Indeed, simple alkylamines stemming from secondary carbon atoms, as in 1-ethylpropylamine, were also found not to be substrates for lysyl oxidase (data not shown). Moreover, neither N-acetyl-HCTL, α-amino-γ-butyrolactone (structures shown in Fig. 1), nor dl-homocysteine inhibited lysyl oxidase at concentrations ≤1 mm, indicating the essentiality of the α-amino group and the five-membered lactone structure in the inhibition by these compounds. The inhibitory effect of HCTL on LO was also confirmed by assays against protein substrates of lysyl oxidase, yielding IC50values of 30 ± 3 μm and 220 ± 20 μm, using tropoelastin and collagen, respectively, as substrates. In comparison to the value of 23.0 ± 3.6 μm obtained with 1,5-diaminopentane as substrate, spatially extended interactions between the enzyme and its collagen substrate previously described (34Nagan N. Kagan H.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 22366-22371Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) may account for the significantly decreased sensitivity noted with this substrate. The specificity of the inhibition of selected copper-dependent amine oxidases by the selenium and sulfur lactones was investigated in view of the apparent similarity among the mechanisms of action of these enzymes (35Klinman J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 27189-27192Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). As shown (Fig.4), HCTL and SeHCL are each highly selective for lysyl oxidase among these catalysts. Although LO lost all activity at 100 μm HCTL and at 10 μm SeHCL, the activities of plasma amine oxidase and diamine oxidase were only slightly affected at these concentrations of these lactones. HCTL can covalently derivatize proteins via aminolysis of the thiol ester by protein α- and/or ε-amino groups (13Vidal M. Sainte-Marie J. Philippot J. Bienvenue A. Biochimie. 1986; 68: 723-730Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar, 14McCully K.S. Cancer Res. 1976; 36: 3198-3202PubMed Google Scholar, 36Benesch R. Benesch R.E. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1956; 78: 1597-1599Crossref Scopus (59) Google Scholar), resulting in the gain of free sulfhydryl groups due to the opening of the thiolactone ring. To clarify whether this is relevant to the inhibition of LO by HCTL, the native enzyme was modified by HCTL as described and then reacted with [1-14C]iodoacetamide, using the isotopically labeled alkylating reagent to detect sulfhydryl groups newly introduced by reaction of the enzyme with the thiolactone. Autoradiography of SDS-PAGE analyses of the modified enzyme (Fig.5) indicated that the low background level of [1-14C]iodoacetamide associated with the native enzyme was not significantly changed by the modification with HCTL. Prior reduction of the enzyme disulfide bonds by treatment of the native enzyme with 2-mercaptoethanol or dithiothreitol markedly increased incorporation of the isotope, consistent with the alkylation of the newly available cysteine residues. These data indicate that HCTL does not introduce free SH functions and are consistent with previous observations that each of the cysteine residues of native lysyl oxidase exists in disulfide linkage (15Williams M.A. Kagan H.M. Anal. Biochem. 1985; 149: 430-437Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). The preparation of lysyl oxidase used in this experiment included a co-purified band at ∼24"

The interactions of the helicase with the DNA were investigated using a series of forked DNAs. Our results show that the helicase interacts asymmetrically with the two tails of the forked DNA. When the helicase was preassembled on the forked DNA before the start of unwinding, a DNA with 15-nucleotide (nt) 3′-tail and 35-nt 5′-tail was unwound with optimal rates close to 60 base pairs/s at 18 °C.

T7 helicase is a ring-shaped hexameric helicase that forms oligomers in the presence of Mg(II) and dTTP or dTMP-PCP (8Patel S.S. Hingorani M.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 10668-10675Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The helicase binds preferably and tightly to ssDNA and at least one DNA-binding site is within the central hole, which can accommodate a 25–30-nt long ssDNA (9Egelman E.H. Yu X. Wild R.

The hexamer must therefore interact with the ssDNA tails of the forked DNA, but the exact mechanism of interaction of the helicase with the forked DNA substrate is not understood.To date, a large number of DNA helicases have been identified, and most have been shown to require ssDNA regions for initiation of DNA unwinding in vitro (11Wiekowski M.

The requirement for two noncomplementary DNA tails, as for T7 helicase, is observed also in two other helicases, Escherichia coli DnaB helicase (16LeBowitz J.H. McMacken R. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 4738-4748Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and bacteriophage T4 DNA helicase (17Richardson R.W. Nossal N.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 4725-4731Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), both of which are hexameric helicases (18Bujalowski W. Klonowska M.M. Jezewska M.J. J. Biol.

Biol. 1996; 259: 7-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar), and all three helicases are required for DNA replication.In this paper, we have investigated the interactions of T7 helicase with forked DNA substrates that mimic the topology of a replication fork. Our strategy was to investigate the specificity of the helicase for the DNA substrate by synthesizing forked DNAs containing varying lengths of the 5′- and the 3′-tails. We have used DNA unwinding to assay for protein-DNA interactions, since the unwinding activity is very sensitive to the nature of the forked DNA substrate, and the rate constants provide a quantitative measure of active interactions. Such sensitive and quantitative measurements are not possible with methods such as footprinting or DNA protection, since helicases have no sequence specificity for DNA binding (22Hingorani M.M. Patel S.S. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 12478-12487Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). The single turnover DNA unwinding rate constants were measured using two assays, a fluorimetric stopped-flow assay and a radiometric gel assay. The goals of the present studies were to establish optimal reaction conditions for measuring the rate of DNA unwinding, to define the optimum forked DNA substrate for T7 helicase, and through the process understand in more detail the interactions of the helicase with the 5′- and the 3′-tails. This study represents part of our ongoing effort toward understanding the mechanism of DNA unwinding, which is not understood for any helicase.We show that under conditions where T7 helicase was preassembled on the forked DNA, maximum unwinding rates were observed with a forked DNA that contained a 5′-tail of 35 bases. Under conditions where the helicase hexamer was not allowed to bind to the DNA until the start of the reaction, maximum unwinding rates were not achieved even with a 5′-tail >65 nt long. The optimum length of the 3′-tail under both conditions was 15 bases. Both tails were required to be ssDNA, and when each tail was made into a dsDNA by annealing complementary oligodeoxynucleotide the unwinding activity was greatly inhibited. We conclude from these studies that T7 helicase interacts asymmetrically with the ssDNA region of the 5′- and 3′-strands of the duplex DNA during DNA unwinding.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESSubstrates and ReagentsOligodeoxynucleotides modified with fluorescein (Fig. 1) were purchased from Macromolecular Resources at Colorado State University. [γ-32P]ATP was purchased from Amersham Life Science, Inc. DNA kinase from bacteriophage T4 was purchased from Life Technologies, Inc. All other reagents were purchased from Sigma.DNAOligodeoxynucleotides were synthesized on a Millipore ExpediteTM nucleic acid synthesis system according to standard procedures. The deprotected oligodeoxynucleotides were purified using preparative denaturing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The polyacrylamide gels (10–15% acrylamide) contained 5 m urea in TBE (23Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989: 5.70Google Scholar) and were run at 65 °C. The band corresponding to the desired DNA product was visualized by UV shadowing, excised, and electroeluted in an Elutrap apparatus from Schleicher & Schuell. The DNAs were ethanol-precipitated and stored at −20 °C before use.DNA concentrations were determined spectroscopically in TBE buffer (containing 8 m urea) by taking absorbency measurements at λ = 260 nm in a Hewlett-Packard 8452A diode array spectrophotometer. The extinction coefficients for each DNA species were calculated from the DNA sequences using extinction coefficients of bases (liter · mol−1 · cm−1): εA = 15200, εC = 7050, εG = 12010, εT = 8400.Forked DNA SubstratesPartially double-stranded oligodeoxynucleotides, mimicking the topology of a replication fork, including a double-stranded region and two single-stranded tails, were designed as shown (Fig. 1). They were generated by annealing the appropriate ssDNA species. Annealing was carried out by mixing the DNA strands (final concentrations ranged from 300 nm to 1 μm) in TBE buffer containing 50 mm NaCl. The annealing mixture was incubated at 95 °C for 3 min and allowed to slowly cool down to 4 °C. For detection and quantitation, one strand of the forked DNA was either 5′-32P-radiolabeled as described (23Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989: 5.70Google Scholar) or covalently linked to a fluorescein moiety. In all cases, a 2-fold excess of the unlabeled strand was added to ensure full annealing for all labeled strands. Complete annealing was checked by running the samples on native polyacrylamide gels before use.EnzymesBacteriophage T7 gene 4A′ protein was expressed and purified as described previously (24Hingorani M.M. Patel S.S. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 2218-2228Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). 4A′ is a M64L mutant of the 4A protein; the Met-64 is the initiation codon for the 4B protein. By mutating Met-64 to Leu, we were able to express 4A′ alone by preventing synthesis of 4B (25Rosenberg A.H. Patel S.S. Johnson K.A. Studier F.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 15005-15012Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The concentrations of purified proteins were determined both from absorbency measurements (ε280 = 76,100m−1 cm−1) and by the Bradford method (26Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (213347) Google Scholar) with bovine serum albumin as a standard. Both assays provided similar concentrations.Helicase AssaysThe helicase activity of 4A′ was measured under two conditions, A and B, at either 4 or 18 °C. The reaction buffer consisted of 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 50 mm NaCl, and 10% glycerol. All reactions were as described below, except where specified otherwise.Condition A4A′ protein (10 μm) was incubated for 1 min with 2 mm dTTP and 3 mmMgCl2 in reaction buffer. The reactions were started by adding the DNA substrate mix, which consisted of 5 nmforked DNA, 10 mm dTTP, and 17 mmMgCl2 in reaction buffer, to the preincubated protein.Condition B4A′ protein (8 μm) was incubated for 75 min at room temperature with 5 nm DNA substrate, 1.5 mm EDTA, and 4 mm dTTP in reaction buffer. The reactions were started by adding an equal volume of 11 mmMgCl2 in reaction buffer.Radiometric Helicase AssayReactions were carried out under conditions A or B in a 4 °C room and a PTC-100TM Programmable Thermal Controller (MJ Research, Inc.) to control the temperature of the reaction to ± 0.1 °C. At various times after the start of the reaction, 5-μl aliquots were removed and quenched by addition of the quench buffer (100 mm EDTA, 3% SDS, 1% bromphenol blue, and 10% glycerol). The quenched samples (12 μl) were loaded immediately on native 10% polyacrylamide gels containing TBE (acrylamide/bisacrylamide = 19/1), and electrophoresis was started immediately after sample loading to prevent reannealing of DNA substrates. Electrophoresis conditions were 10 V/cm and 12 °C. A gel running temperature of 4 °C was chosen for forked DNA species to which short oligodeoxynucleotides were annealed to prevent DNA melting during electrophoresis. After electrophoresis, the gels were fixed in 10% (v/v) acetic acid, dried on Bio-Rad sequencing cell filter paper (2 h at 80 °C), exposed to phosphor storage screens (48 h), and quantitated using a PhosphorImager 445 SI (Molecular Dynamics, Inc.). Controls were run on each gel. The zero controls consisted of complete reaction mixtures minus dTTP. Controls to measure the extent of maximum unwinding were prepared by heat denaturing the DNA for 5 min at 95 °C and loading on the gel immediately.Data Analysis for the Radiometric AssayThe fraction of DNA unwound was calculated as shown in Equation1, adjusting for ssDNA and dsDNA present before and after the reaction, respectively. fraction ssDNA=SSDNASSDNA+dSDNA−SSnative DNASSnative DNA+dSnative DNASSdenatured DNASSdenatured DNA+dSdenatured DNA−SSnative DNASSnative DNA+dSnative DNAEquation 1 ssDNA, dsDNA, and so on, indicate the amount of radioactivity in the band corresponding to the indicated DNA species. The fraction of ssDNA was plotted versus reaction time, and the data were fit to a 1-exponential equation describing pseudo first-order reactions (see Equation 2). fraction ssDNA=A(1−e−kt)+nEquation 2 A is the amplitude that corresponds to the maximum fraction of ssDNA that can be generated enzymatically from the substrates. k is the pseudo first-order rate constant of DNA unwinding; t is the reaction time, and n is an additive constant representing the amount of ssDNA present before the reaction started.Radiometric Rapid Quenched-flow AssayRadiometric helicase assays at 18 °C were carried out using a quenched flow machine (Kintek Corp.). The temperature in the instrument was kept constant to ±0.5 °C using a circulating water bath. 15-μl solution of substrate from each syringe were rapidly mixed to start the reactions. The reactions were quenched with 180 μl quench buffer (same as for manual radiometric experiments but without bromphenol blue) from the quench syringe. All other procedures are as described for the manual radiometric assays.Fluorimetric Stopped-flow AssayThe fluorimetric helicase assay was carried out in a stopped-flow apparatus (Kintek Corp., State College, PA). The temperature in the apparatus was kept constant to ±0.5 °C using a circulating water bath. The appropriate solutions, according to the reaction conditions, were loaded in the two syringes of the machine, and 40 μl of solution from each syringe were mixed for each reaction. Fluorescein moieties on forked DNA substrates (Fig. 1) were excited at λ = 495 nm, and fluorescence was detected by a photomultiplier tube using a 530-nm cut-on filter from Oriel Corp. The data from 5 to 7 experiments were averaged, and fluorescence was plotted versus reaction time. The one-exponential phase of the curve was fit to a modified version of Equation 2 as shown in Equation 3. F(t)=AF(1−e−kt)+F0Equation 3 A F is the amplitude that corresponds to the maximum fluorescence change; t is the reaction time;F(t) is the observed fluorescence at time t; F0 the fluorescence at t = 0, and k is the pseudo first-order rate constant of DNA unwinding.DISCUSSIONWe have studied here the interactions of T7 DNA helicase with the forked DNA substrate with the goal of understanding the substrate requirement for initiation of DNA unwinding. It was known that T7 helicase required two noncomplementary ssDNA tails to initiate DNA unwinding (10Matson S.W. Tabor S. Richardson C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 14017-14024Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, the nature of the interaction of the helicase with the forked DNA was not understood. The helicase could interact with either one or both ssDNA tails of the forked DNA, with the dsDNA alone, or with both ds- and ssDNA. It is known that T7 helicase binds preferentially to ssDNA, and its interaction with the dsDNA is very weak. In addition, at least one of the DNA-binding sites is within the central hole of the hexameric ring (9Egelman E.H. Yu X. Wild R. Hingorani M.M. Patel S.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 3869-3873Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar, 22Hingorani M.M. Patel S.S. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 12478-12487Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar, 30Yu X. Hingorani M.M. Patel S.S. Egelman E.H. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1996; 3: 740-743Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Since the diameter of the central hole is 20–25 Å, it could accommodate a dsDNA or a ssDNA. However, binding of the dsDNA within the central hole was not observed in the electron microscopy studies (9Egelman E.H. Yu X. Wild R. Hingorani M.M. Patel S.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 3869-3873Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar), suggesting that one of the two noncomplementary ssDNA tails of the forked DNA is bound within the hole. If T7 helicase translocates on ssDNA in the 5′ → 3′ direction as studies in the literature suggest (31Tabor S. Richardson C.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1980; 78: 205-209Crossref Scopus (107) Google Scholar, 32Matson S.W. Richardson C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 14009-14016Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 33Brown W.C. Romano L.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 6748-6754Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and if the helicase maintains the same directionality of translocation during DNA unwinding, then the helicase must bind ssDNA in the 5′-strand through the hole. This idea is consistent with recent studies (34Yong Y. Romano L.J. Chem. Res. Toxicol. 1996; 9: 179-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar), which showed that a covalent benzo[a]pyrene-DNA adduct in the 5′-strand inhibited unwinding by T7 helicase, but benzo[a]pyrene in the 3′-strand had no effect on the unwinding activity.We have shown that T7 DNA helicase requires both the 5′- and the 3′-noncomplementary DNA tails for initiation of DNA unwinding, and unwinding was greatly inhibited when one of the tails was removed. Note that in vivo the ssDNA regions required for initiation of DNA unwinding are likely provided by the priming proteins involved in DNA replication (35Fuller C.W. Richardson C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 3185-3196Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Whereas a number of studies suggest that the helicase may bind and move on the 5′-tail, the role of the 3′-tail or the nature of its interaction with the helicase is not clear. It is possible that a noncomplementary 3′-tail is required simply because the 3′-strand needs to be excluded from the central hole during DNA unwinding, i.e. the helicase is acting as a wedge between the two DNA strands. If a noncomplementary 3′-tail is not present then the dsDNA or the ss/dsDNA junction may bind in a nonproductive manner in the hole and inhibit DNA unwinding. To test this hypothesis, we converted the 3′ ssDNA tail into a dsDNA tail. If the helicase does not interact specifically with the ssDNA region in the 3′-tail, then the forked DNA containing the dsDNA tail should be unwound by the helicase because the dsDNA tail would be excluded from the hole. Our results showed that conversion of the 3′ ssDNA tail into a dsDNA tail greatly inhibited the unwinding activity. The same result was seen when the 5′ ssDNA tail was converted into a dsDNA tail. We conclude that T7 helicase must interact with both the ssDNA tails during initiation of DNA unwinding. Experiments with nicked DNA substrate showed that the helicase maintains this interaction with the two ssDNA strands also during DNA unwinding.Systematic investigation of the unwinding activity as a function of 5′- and 3′-tail lengths showed that T7 helicase requires different lengths of 5′- and 3′-tails for optimal DNA unwinding. The optimum length of the 3′-tail under all conditions was found to be 15 bases, whereas the optimum length of the 5′-tail ranged from 35 bases to >65 bases. These results lead us to believe that the helicase interacts asymmetrically with the two tails of the forked DNA during DNA unwinding. Under condition A, where DNA unwinding was started by mixing the helicase hexamer with the forked DNA, a >65-nt long 5′-tail was required to achieve optimal unwinding rates. This result was puzzling, since previous studies have shown that each helicase hexamer binds and protects 25–30 bases of ssDNA inside the central hole (9Egelman E.H. Yu X. Wild R. Hingorani M.M. Patel S.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 3869-3873Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar, 22Hingorani M.M. Patel S.S. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 12478-12487Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). The requirement for a longer 5′-tail suggests that multiple hexamers might be required for optimal DNA unwinding, since two hexamers bind to a ssDNA 65 bases long (9Egelman E.H. Yu X. Wild R.

Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 12478-12487Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Additional DNA unwinding experiments under condition B, however, proved this not to be true. In fact, under condition B, where the helicase was preassembled on the DNA, unwinding rates decreased beyond 40 bases of 5′-tail, suggesting that multiple hexamers, when bound to the 5′-tail, are inhibitory.Under condition B, optimal unwinding rates were reached with a 5′-tail length of 35 bases, which is consistent with one hexamer DNA-binding site of 25–30 bases. The reason for an apparent requirement of a long 5′-tail under condition A is not entirely clear. The unwinding rates under condition A increased with increasing protein concentration and with increasing 5′-tail length above 35 bases. Thus, it is possible that the rate-limiting association of the helicase hexamer with the DNA is responsible for the apparent requirement of a long 5′-tail. The protein dependence study suggested that 25–30 μm 4A′ protein would be required to achieve the 60 bp/s unwinding rates observed under condition B. Perhaps the optimal 5′-tail length would be closer to 35 bases, if the experiments under condition A were carried out at a saturating 4A′ concentration. However, due to the high protein concentrations required to conduct such an experiment, we have not tested this idea. The present studies have established the optimal forked DNA substrate and the reaction conditions necessary to measure DNA unwinding. The average unwinding rates under optimal conditions were measured to be close to 60 bp/s at 18 °C, which approached 260 bp/s at 30 °C (data not shown). This rate is very close to the measured speed of 300 s−1 for replication fork movement at 30 °C (36Lechner R.L. Richardson C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 11185-11196Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and suggests that the helicase is highly efficient by itself in unwinding duplex DNA.Our model for how T7 DNA helicase interacts with the forked DNA is shown in Fig. 8. The hexamer binds to the 5′-tail through the central hole, whereas the 3′-tail is excluded from the central hole and interacts at a separate site on the helicase, perhaps in the front or on the outside of the hexamer ring as shown in Fig. 8 (arrow). We propose that T7 helicase uses an exclusion mechanism for DNA unwinding, where the NTPase activity fuels the unidirectional movement of the helicase on the 5′-strand, bound in the hole of the hexamer, and the 3′-strand is excluded from the central hole, and interactions with both strands lead to dsDNA separation.Figure 8Model of a T7 DNA helicase hexameric ring bound to replication fork DNA. The forked DNA in the image, consisting of two 30-nt long tails and a 30-bp double-stranded region, was generated using the HyperChem software by Autodesk, Inc. The image of the helicase protein was generated from electron micrographs, and the orientation of the helicase on the DNA is consistent with those studies (9Egelman E.H. Yu X. Wild R. Hingorani M.M. Patel S.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 3869-3873Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). The two images were overlaid in three dimensions to generate a scaled model which shows possible interactions between helicase and forked DNA substrate. The helicase binds the 5′-tail through the central hole and covers about 25 bases, consistent with nuclease protection and electron microscopy studies (8Patel S.S. Hingorani M.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 10668-10675Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 9Egelman E.H. Yu X. Wild R. Hingorani M.M. Patel S.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

The 3′-tail interacts with the helicase on the outer surface of the hexamer, possibly in the region pointed out by the arrow, which is 10–15 nt from the fork junction.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Several models of helicase-catalyzed DNA unwinding have been proposed in the literature (4Lohman T.M. Mol. Microbiol. 1992; 6: 5-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar, 5Lohman T.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 2269-2272Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 37Lohman T.M. Bjornson K.P. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1996; 65: 169-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (669) Google Scholar). In general these models have been divided into passive or active mechanisms. In the passive mechanism, the helicase is thought to unwind DNA by occupying the ssDNA regions generated by thermal melting of duplex DNA. In one model of a passive mechanism, the helicase does not move unidirectionally on the DNA; hence, to melt long stretches of DNA a number of helicase molecules would have to bind to the ssDNA generated by thermal fraying. In another model, the helicase does move unidirectionally, but upon interaction with the dsDNA it waits for thermal fraying for strand separation. Thermal fraying itself appears to be a fast process (38.Zhuang, W., Studies on the Dynamics of DNA Melting, Ph.D. thesis, 1992, Purdue University, Ann Arbor, MI.Google Scholar). But it is not clear if thermal fraying can separate the dsDNA bases far enough for the helicase to bind and unwind DNA at speeds required for DNA replication, repair, and recombination. Several active mechanisms, where the helicase moves unidirectionally on the DNA, have been proposed. Some of these have been classified into inchworm, rolling, or torsional models by Lohman (5Lohman T.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 2269-2272Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In the rolling model of unwinding, proposed for rep helicase, the helicase interacts with both the ss- and dsDNA, and DNA strands are separated upon binding to the dsDNA (39Amaratunga M. Lohman T.M. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 6815-6820Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Since T7 DNA helicase prefers to interact with ssDNA, we believe that it does not use a rolling-type mechanism, but DNA unwinding by the exclusion model proposed above could occur by an inchworm or the torsional mechanism. In the inchworm mechanism, the helicase would translocate unidirectionally on the 5′-tail and cause DNA unwinding by simply excluding the 3′-tail from the central hole. Thus, DNA unwinding can occur without direct interactions of the helicase with the duplex DNA. The exclusion model proposed here is not limited to hexameric helicases. All that is required is that the two ssDNA strands are bound at separate DNA sites on the helicase so that the helicase can act as a wedge. In the torsional mechanism, the helicase interacts with the ssDNA in both strands. The translocation and rotation of the helicase"

Studies using chromatographically fractionated extracts from several different cell lines suggested that multiple SAPK/JNK activators may exist in addition to MKK4/SEK1 (23Moriguchi T. Kawasaki H.

Biochem. 1996; 236: 796-805Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Moreover, recent genetic studies in MKK4/SEK1 gene-deficient murine embryonic stem cells have demonstrated that MKK4/SEK1 is the critical activator of SAPKs/JNKs in response to the protein synthesis inhibitor anisomycin and heat shock, whereas SAPK/JNK activity was still inducible in SEK1-deficient cells after osmolarity changes or UV irradiation (25Nishina H.

The second activator of SAPKs/JNKs operates independently from MKK4/SEK1 and defines a distinct signal transduction pathway, indicating that different stresses utilize distinct signaling pathways for SAPK/JNK activation (25Nishina H.

In addition, phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate/Ca2+ ionophore stimulation induced SAPK/JNK activation in mature T cells but not in immature thymocytes from SEK1−/− mice, implying that signaling pathways for SAPK activation are developmentally regulated during lymphopoiesis (27Nishina N.

We report the isolation of a novel murine protein kinase, MKK7, that specifically activates the SAPK/JNK pathway but not ERKs or p38 kinases.

Gene-specific forward (5′-GACAGGCCACATCATTGCTGTTAAG-3′) and reverse (5′- CGCCACAGTCATCTTGCCCAGGATTC-3′) primers were designed from the EST sequence and used to generate a PCR fragment from the EST clone. The PCR probe was used to screen a mouse spleen cDNA library in λZAPII phage vector (Stratagene). For hybridization, replicate filters were prehybridized for 1 h at 68 °C in Express hybridization buffer (CLONTECH, Palo Alto, CA) and hybridized overnight in the same solution to a 256-base pair probe labeled with [α-32P]dCTP. After hybridization, the filters were washed twice (2 × 30 min) in 0.1 × SSC (0.15m NaCl, 0.015 m sodium acetate, pH 7.0), 0.1% SDS at 55 °C. Positive clones were picked, purified, and sequenced on both strands. Full-length MKK7 cDNA was cloned into the mammalian expression vector PCR3.1 (Invitrogen, San Diego, CA) by polymerase chain reaction using the two following forward and reverse primers: 5′-ACCATGGACTACAAGGACGACGATGACAAGCTGGGGCTCCCATCAACCTTGTTC-3′ and 5′-CCAGCCCAGAGGTTATGATTG-3′).

Lysates containing 100 μg of protein were immunoprecipitated with 5 μg of anti-HA mAb 12CA5 (Berkeley Antibody Co., Berkeley, CA) or the anti-FLAG M2 mAb (Sigma) and protein A-Sepharose CL-4B beads (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.). For Western blot analysis, lysates containing equal amounts of total protein were resolved by 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and electro-blotted onto nitrocellulose membranes. The blots were then probed with mAb M2 or 12CA5 followed by biotinylated rabbit anti-mouse IgG (Amersham Life Science Inc.) and developed using the enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) detection system (Amersham). Lysates from cells co-transfected with MKK7 and HA-tagged p54SAPKβ, ERK2, or p38 kinase cDNA plasmid were prepared, and recombinant protein was immunoprecipitated as described above. Protein A beads were washed 3 times with lysis buffer, once with kinase buffer (25 mmHEPES, pH 7.4, 25 mm β-glycerophosphate, 25 mm MgCl2, 25 mm dithiothreitol, and 0.1 mm Na3VO4), and resuspended in 40 μl of kinase buffer. The beads were then incubated with human GST-c-Jun, PHAS-I peptides, or ATF-2 peptides and 1 μl of [γ-32P]ATP at 30 °C for 30 min. Reactions were terminated, and phosphorylated proteins were resolved by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. To identify novel MKKs, we searched the Amgen EST data base with MKK4 nucleotide sequences as query sequences. One partial mouse cDNA sequence (444 base pairs) with homology to MKK4 was identified. This cDNA fragment was subsequently used to screen a mouse spleen cDNA library, and several cDNA clones were isolated. Sequencing of the longer clone (3.4 kilobases) showed that it contained a single open reading frame of 347 amino acids, with a predicted molecular mass of 39 kDa. The nucleotide and deduced amino acid sequences of MKK7 are shown in Fig.1 A. There are in-frame stop codons at the 5′ end. The deduced amino acid sequence predicts a kinase catalytic domain at the N terminus and contains 11 kinase subdomains.

MKK7 displays 62, 49, 47, 43, 34, 34, and 35% amino acid identity to Hep, SEK1/MKK4, MKK6, MKK3, MEK1, MEK2, and MEK5, respectively. The amino acid sequence alignment of MKK7 with those related molecules is shown in Fig. 1 B. These results show that MKK7 is a novel member of the MAPK kinase family of dual-specificity protein kinases. To determine the expression pattern of MKK7, we performed Northern blotting of multiple adult tissues. MKK7 is expressed at high levels in brain, lung, liver, skeletal muscle, kidney, and testis and at lower levels in the heart and spleen. Moreover, a second mRNA species of MKK7 can be detected in the testis (Fig. 2 A). MKK7 mRNA is also expressed at high levels in wild type and sek1/mkk4 gene-deficient (25Nishina H. Fischer K.D. Radvanyi L. Shahinian A. Hakem R. Rubie E.A. Bernstein A. Mak T.W. Woodgett J.R. Penninger J.M. Nature. 1997; 385: 350-353Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar) embryonic stem cell (data not shown). In situ hybridization of day 10.5, 12.5, 14.5, 16.5, and 18.5 embryos using a MKK7 antisense probe further confirmed that MKK7 is ubiquitously expressed at these stages of fetal development. On E10.5 (not shown) and E12.5 (Fig. 2, B and C), MKK7 was expressed at high levels in the brain, spinal cord, eyes, muscle, lungs, vertebrae, and intestine and at lower levels in the heart and livers. At later stages of embryogenesis (E14.5, E16.5, and E18.5) high levels of MKK7 expression were found in the brain, retina, and bone marrow. Interestingly, on E14.5, E16.5, and E18.5, MKK7 was highly expressed in skin, intestinal, and lung epithelium and the epithelial layers lining the olfactory cavity and developing teeth and whiskers (Fig. 2, D and E, and data not shown). It should be noted that Drosophila hep is required for epithelial cell sheet movement and dorsal closure (29Glise B. Bourbon H. Noselli S. Cell. 1995; 83: 451-461Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar). The sequence homology between MKK7 and Drosophila hep and high expression of MKK7 in epithelial tissues imply that, similarly to Hep, MKK7 might function in the development and/or morphogenesis of epithelial tissues. MKK7 has high homology to Hep and MKK4/SEK1, both of which activate the SAPK/JNK pathway. To examine whether MKK7 can regulate the SAPK/JNK pathway, we co-transfected 293 cells with mammalian expression plasmids encoding MKK7 and HA epitope-tagged SAPKβ. Recombinant SAPKβ was immunoprecipitated from cell lysates and used in protein kinase assays with GST-c-Jun as substrate. Transfection of cells with MKK7 resulted in strong activation of SAPKβ (Fig.3 A, lane 2), whereas transfection with vector alone had no effect on SAPKβ activity (Fig. 3 A, lane 1). The level of activation was comparable to that of cells transfected with MKK4/SEK1 (Fig. 3 A, lane 4). A kinase-inactive form of MKK7 in which lysine 76 in the ATP binding domain was mutated to a glutamic acid (K76E) was unable to activate SAPKβ (Fig. 3 A,lane 3), indicating that the kinase activity of MKK7 is required for the activation of SAPKs/JNKs in vivo. Western blot analysis showed that SAPKβ was expressed at comparable levels (data not shown). Stimulation of 293 cells cotransfected with MKK7 and SAPKβ with IL-1β or LPS further increased SAPKβ activity by 1.5- and 2.2-fold, respectively, as compared with cells cotransfected with MKK7 and SAPKβ (data not shown). To determine whether MKK7 phosphorylated SAPKs/JNKs at the physiological sites Thr-183 and Tyr-185, 293 cells were co-transfected with MKK7 and HA-tagged SAPKβ. Epitope-tagged SAPKβ was immunoprecipitated with an anti-HA mAb and blotted with a phospho-specific SAPK/JNK Ab and an Ab that is reactive against the SAPK/JNK protein. As shown in Fig. 3 B, SAPKβ from cells co-transfected with wide type MKK7 but not from cells co-transfected with the kinase-inactive K76E mutant were specifically recognized by the phospho-specific SAPK/JNK Ab (upper panel, lane 2). Western blot analysis using an anti-HA Ab showed that epitope-tagged SAPKβ was expressed at similar levels in all cells (Fig. 3 B, lower panel). This result indicates that MKK7 activates SAPK/JNK via phosphorylation at the Thr-183/Tyr-185 dual-phosphorylation motif. To determine whether endogenous MKK7 may play a role in SAPK/JNK activation in response to physiological stimuli, we tested whether the kinase-negative mutant of MKK7 (K76E) can block SAPK/JNK activation after IL-1β and LPS activation. 293 cells were co-transfected with the MKK7-K76E mutant and SAPKβ and then stimulated with either IL-1β or LPS. As shown in Fig. 4, the MKK7-K76E mutant and, as a control, the dominant negative MKK4-AL mutant (21Sanchez I. Hughes R.T. Mayer B.J. Yee K. Woodgett J.R. Avruch J. Kyriakis J.M. Zon L.I. Nature. 1994; 372: 794-798Crossref PubMed Scopus (916) Google Scholar) effectively blocked IL-1β-induced SAPK/JNK activation (Fig. 4 A, lane 3). MKK4-AL mutant also blocked LPS-induced SAPKβ activation (data not shown). Western blot analysis using an anti-HA antibody revealed that SAPKβ was expressed at similar levels in all transfections (Fig. 4 A, lower panel, and data not shown). Similarly, the kinase-inactive MKK7-K76E mutant inhibited LPS-stimulated SAPK/JNK activation (Fig. 4 B, lane 3). Since either MKK4 or MKK7 kinase negative mutant completely inhibited IL-1β- or LPS-induced SAPKβ activation, it is possible that these mutants function by sequestering either upstream or downstream components in the SAPK/JNK pathway. The MAPK kinase kinase MEKK1 is a potent activator of MKK4/SEK1, which in turn phosphorylates and activates SAPKs/JNKs (11Yan M. Dai T. Deak J.C. Kyriakis J.M. Zon L.I. Woodgett J.R. Templeton D.J.

Science. 1994; 266: 1719-1723Crossref PubMed Scopus (1011) Google Scholar). To determine whether MEKK1 is an upstream activator of MKK7 in the SAPK/JNK pathway, we analyzed the effect of the kinase-inactive MKK7-K76E mutant on MEKK1-induced SAPK/JNK activation. As shown in Fig. 4 C, the MKK7-K76E mutant blocked MEKK1-induced SAPK/JNK activation, suggesting that MKK7 functions downstream of MEKK1. These results demonstrate that MKK7 can relay signals from the physiological stimuli LPS and IL-1β to SAPK/JNK pathway and that MKK7 is a downstream target for MEKK1 activity in the SAPK/JNK signaling cascade. To examine whether MKK7 can also regulate the ERK and/or p38 kinase pathways, we co-transfected 293 cells with mammalian expression plasmids encoding murine MKK7 and HA epitope-tagged ERK2 or HA-tagged p38 kinase. ERK2 or p38 kinase were immunoprecipitated from cell lysates and used in protein kinase assays with PHAS-I or ATF-2 peptides as substrates. The addition of epidermal growth factor to 293 cells strongly activated ERK2 kinase activity (Fig.5 A, lane 3). However, no increase in ERK2 activity was observed when MKK7 was overexpressed in 293 cells (Fig. 5 A, lanes 1 and 2). In addition, the MKK7-K76E mutant did not inhibit epidermal growth factor-induced ERK2 activation (Fig. 5 A,lane 4). Similarly, whereas treatment of cells with NaCl strongly activated p38 kinase (Fig. 5 B, lane 3), no increase in p38 kinase activity was observed when MKK7 was overexpressed in 293 cells (Fig. 5 B, lanes 1 and 2). These data suggest that MKK7 does not play a role in the MAPK/ERK and p38 kinase pathways and that MKK7 is the second activator that relays stress signaling to the SAPK/JNK pathway. Genetic studies in MKK4/SEK1 gene-deficient murine embryonic stem cells have demonstrated that a second activator of SAPKs/JNKs exists in vivo (25Nishina H. Fischer K.D. Radvanyi L. Shahinian A.

Med. 1997; 186: 941-953Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). We have identified a new mitogen-activated kinase kinase MKK7 that specifically activates SAPKs/JNKs but not ERKs and p38 kinase. MKK7 is ubiquitously expressed in all adult and embryonic organs but displays high expression in epithelial tissues at later stages of fetal development. Moreover, our results show that MKK7 acts downstream of MEKK1 and that a kinase-inactive MKK7 mutant can inhibit SAPK/JNK activation in response to IL-1β and LPS. Further studies are needed to elucidate upstream signaling pathways and other physiological stimuli that activate MKK7."

Five nuclear mutants (ccb strains) that are defective in holocytochrome b 6 formation display a phenotype that is indistinguishable from that of strains carrying site-directed bh ligand mutants.

In c-type cytochromes, the heme is covalently attached to the protein by thioether linkages between the sulfhydryl groups of (usually) two cysteine residues and the vinyl groups of the tetrapyrrole ring. In b-type cytochromes, the heme is believed to be noncovalently bound to the protein through pairs of histidines, which serve as axial ligands for the iron atom. Cytochrome b 6 and subunit IV are homologous, respectively, to the first four α-helices and next three α-helices of cytochrome b of the cytochrome bc 1complex (17Widger W.R. Cramer W.A. Hermann R.G.

These mutations were generated in C. reinhardtii, which is a unique system for mutational studies of the cytochrome b 6 f complex owing to the availability of chloroplast gene replacement methodology coupled with the fact that the cytochrome b 6 f complex is dispensable for growth in C. reinhardtii. In contrast to knowledge accumulated on the biosynthetic pathway of the tetrapyrrole cofactors and on the process of covalent attachment of c hemes to their apoproteins (reviewed in Refs. 27Gonzales D.H.

Advances in Photosynthesis: Anoxygenic Photosynthetic Bacteria. Kluwer Academic Publishers, Dordrecht, The Netherlands1995: 709-723Google Scholar), conversion of b-type apocytochromes to their holo-form has received little attention, possibly due to the difficulty in distinguishing heme association defects from defects in other aspects of cytochrome b assembly. Since hemin can bind, without catalysis, to synthetic peptides that mimic helices B and D of cytochrome b (31Robertson D.E. Farld R.S. Moser C.C. Urbauer J.L. Mulholland S.E. Pidikiti R. Lear J.D. Wand A.J. De Grado W.F. Dutton P.L. Nature. 1994; 368: 425-432Crossref PubMed Scopus (461) Google Scholar), one view is that heme binding to cytochrome b should also be uncatalyzed in vivo. This view is uncontested by virtue of the fact that protein factors involved in the catalysis of heme binding to cytochrome b or b 6 have not been identified. The hemes of mitochondrial and bacterial cytochrome b are not detected after SDS-PAGE 1The abbreviations used are: PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; MM, minimum medium; TAP, Tris acetate phosphate medium; TMBZ, 3,3′,5,5′-tetramethylbenzidine; WT, wild type; E, einstein(s). of membranes or purified complexes (32Ljungdahl P.O.

Chem. 1991; 266: 9064-9077Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and this undoubtedly accounts for the dearth of information on cytochrome b assembly. By contrast, heme(s) of cytochrome b 6 can be visualized after electrophoresis (3Lemaire C. Girard-Bascou J. Wollman F.-A. Bennoun P. Biochim. Biophys.

Here, we demonstrate that tight binding of heme is a unique aspect of the chloroplast cytochrome b 6 (which may reflect a different mode of association, perhaps covalent, of at least one of the two hemes), and we exploit this property to (i) establish a temporal order of heme binding to apocytochrome b 6 in a multistep pathway in vivo and (ii) identify mutants that are blocked specifically at the step of heme insertion into the bhsite. This has been accomplished by monitoring the synthesis of cytochrome b 6 in strains carrying site-directed alterations of bl or bh ligands and in nuclear mutants with similar phenotypes. These nuclear mutants define four loci. Wild type (WT) strain CC125 mt+ was used for UV mutagenesis, and 137c was used for chloroplast transformation and genetic analysis. Strains were grown on Tris acetate phosphate (TAP) medium, pH 7.2, at 25 °C under dim light (5–6 μE). WT cells grown to a density of 3–5 × 106 cells·ml−1 were transferred to Petri dishes exposed to 260-nm UV irradiation for 1–5 min with constant agitation. The cells' viability was approximately 20–30%. Irradiated cells were transferred to the dark for 2 h to minimize photoreversion. The cells were then plated on thin agar slabs (2% TAP agar poured over Miracloth circles) placed over TAP agar plates. Plates were returned to the dark for 24–48 h. Agar slabs were transferred to TAP agar plates containing 20 mm metronidazole and placed in high light (50–60 μE). After 24–48 h, agar slabs were transferred to fresh TAP agar plates and maintained under dim light for 2–3 weeks until colonies were apparent (50–150 colonies/plate). Surviving colonies were tested for fluorescence induction kinetics (3Lemaire C. Girard-Bascou J. Wollman F.-A. Bennoun P. Biochim. Biophys.

EMBO J. 1994; 13: 1019-1027Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). In the resulting pWFA plasmid, the aadA cassette is located 309 base pairs downstream from the end of the petA coding region and is transcribed from the same strand as the petA gene. C. reinhardtii cells were transformed by particle bombardment as by Boynton et al. (41Boynton J.E. Gillham N.W. Harris E.H. Hosler J.P. Johnson A.M. Jones A.R. Randolph-Anderson B.L. Roberson D. Klein T.M. Shark K.B. Sanford J.C. Science. 1988; 240: 1534-1538Crossref PubMed Scopus (721) Google Scholar). We attempted to complement the ΔpetB strain, deleted for the petB gene (24Kuras R. Wollman F.-A. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 1019-1027Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar), with the mutated petB genes (Table I); after bombardment, transformant cells were plated on minimum medium (MM) under high light. Since no phototrophic transformants were recovered by the above procedure, we used the WT strain in co-transformation experiments with plasmid pWFA, which confers resistance to spectinomycin. Cells were grown for approximately six generations in the presence of 0.5 mm 5-fluorodeoxyuridine before transformation (42Kindle K.L. Richards K.L. Stern D.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 1721-1725Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar) and plated after transformation on TAP-spectinomycin (100 μg·ml−1) under dim light to select for spectinomycin-resistant clones. Resistant clones were then screened by fluorescence to choose those that were defective in cytochrome b 6 f activity. The transformants were confirmed to be homoplasmic for the petB mutation by restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis and DNA filter hybridization with specific probes (data not shown). The introduced mutations were further confirmed by direct sequencing of the mutated petB genes in these transformants (data not shown).Table IMutations introduced in the chloroplast petB gene of C. reinhardtiiNucleotide and amino acid sequencesNew restriction sitesPlasmid (Strain)...ATT CAC CGT TGG...WTI85 H86 D87 W88...GCG CGG...BssHIIpB86AAla(TB86A)...TCGCGA...NruIIpB86SSer(TB86S)...GTT TTA CAC GTT TTC...WTV98 L99 H100 V101 F102...TTA GAC GTC...AatIIpB100DAsp(TB100D)...TTA CTAGTT...SpeIpB100LLeu(TB100L)...AGT CAC ACT TTC...WTS186H187 T188 F189...GGTACC...KpnIpB187GGly(TB187G)...AGTACT...ScaIpB187SSer(TB187S)...CAC TTC TTA ATG ATT CGT AAA...WTH202 F203 L204M205 I206 R207 K208...GAC TTC TAA ATG ATC CGGAAA...BspEIpB202DAsp(TB202D)...CAGTTC CTG ATG ATT CGT AAA...AlwNIpB202QGln(TB202Q) Open table in a new tab Crosses were done according to Harris (43Harris E.H.

For reversion tests, mutant strains were grown in TAP to a density of 2 × 106 cells·ml−1; the cells were collected by centrifugation and resuspended in MM to a density of 2 × 108 cells·ml−1. One-half ml was spread onto MM agar plates (10 plates) and maintained under high light for 2–3 weeks, at which time colonies were counted. Recombination tests were performed to detect tight linkage; at the same time, at least 30 zygotes isolated from crosses between different mutant strains were transferred separately to either TAP or MM agar plates. They were kept under dim light on TAP plates during 2 weeks or high light on MM plates for 3–4 weeks; the number of zygotes giving rise to colonies was estimated on each plate; the number of tetratype and nonparental ditype tetrads was estimated as a 1/(b 1 × a 2/b 2), where a 1 is the number of zygotes that give rise to colonies on minimal medium, a 2 is the number of zygotes transferred to minimal medium, b 1 is the number of zygotes that give rise to colonies on TAP, and b 2 is the number of zygotes transferred to TAP. Biochemical analyses were carried out on cells grown to a density of 2 × 106 cells·ml−1. For analysis of polypeptide contents, samples were resuspended in 100 mm DTT, 100 mm Na2CO3 and solubilized in the presence of 2% SDS at 100 °C for 50 s. When indicated, nonheated samples were solubilized in the presence of 2% SDS at room temperature. Polypeptides were separated in the Laemmli system (45Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207537) Google Scholar) using 12–18% acrylamide gels in the presence of 8 m urea or using 15% acrylamide gels containing 0.1% SDS. Heme staining was detected by peroxidase activity of heme binding subunits using 3,3′,5,5′-tetramethylbenzidine (TMBZ) as in (46Thomas P.E. Ryan D. Levine W. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 75: 168-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (897) Google Scholar). Immunodetection was carried out as in Kuras and Wollman (24Kuras R. Wollman F.-A. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 1019-1027Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar) using a cytochrome b 6 antibody against an N terminus peptide alone that strongly labels a contaminant (Figs. 2 A and5 A) or in combination with an antibody against a C terminus peptide that attenuates contamination (Figs. 3 B,6 B, 7, and 8). Thylakoid membrane proteins were purified as in Ref. 47Chua N.-H. Bennoun P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1975; 72: 2175-2179Crossref PubMed Scopus (409) Google Scholar. Cytochrome complexes were extracted by hecameg solubilization of thylakoid membranes (4Pierre Y. Breyton C. Kramer D. Popot J.-L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 29342-29349Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). For simplified membrane preparations, cells were harvested by centrifugation, concentrated to 15 × 106 cells/ml in 5 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.5, 10 mm EDTA, 0.3 m sucrose containing protease inhibitors (200 μm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm benzamidine, 5 mmε-amino-n-caproic acid), broken in a French press at 4000 p.s.i., and collected by centrifugation at 15,000 ×g for 10 min. For phosphate/acetone extraction, the supernatant from hecameg-solubilized thylakoid membranes (4Pierre Y. Breyton C. Kramer D. Popot J.-L. J. Biol.

For acid/acetone extraction, the supernatant from hecameg-solubilized membranes was incubated at 4 °C for 30 min in 20 volumes of chilled acetone containing 0.2% of HCl (12 n). The precipitating proteins after phosphate/acetone or acetone/acid treatments were collected by centrifugation and prepared for electrophoresis as above.Figure 5Accumulation and synthesis of cytochrome (cyt.) b 6 fsubunits in nuclear mutants.

Photobiochem. Photobiophys. 1983; 6: 279-291Google Scholar). 14C-Acetate was used in the presence of 8 μg·ml−1 cycloheximide (an inhibitor of cytosolic protein synthesis) at 10−4m (5 μCi·ml−1). To end the labeling period, the isotope was diluted by the addition of 10 volumes of chilled sodium acetate (50 mm). Cells grown to a density of 1.5 × 106 ml−1 were treated with 2 mm gabaculine for 6 h as by Howe et al. (49Howe G. Mets L. Merchant S. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1995; 246: 156-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Cells were harvested by centrifugation, washed, and concentrated to 1.5 × 107 cells ml−1 in minimum Tris medium with 1–2 mmgabaculine and agitated for 1 h. Cells were then pulse-labeled for 10 min with 14C-acetate at a final concentration of 2 × 10−4m (10 μCi·ml−1) in the presence of cycloheximide (8 μg·ml−1) and 2 mm gabaculine. For immunodetection of cytochrome b 6 after gabaculine treatment, cells were not pulse-labeled, and simplified membrane preparation was used. Since cytochrome b 6can be heme-stained after electrophoresis (3Lemaire C. Girard-Bascou J. Wollman F.-A. Bennoun P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1986; 851: 229-238Crossref Scopus (97) Google Scholar), while the related cytochrome b cannot be, we tested denaturing treatments known to extract noncovalently bound hemes to determine the chemical basis for this unique property of cytochrome b 6. A cytochrome b 6 f-enriched fraction obtained by hecameg solubilization of WT thylakoid membranes was treated with phosphate/acetone, with acid/acetone (50Ascoli F. Rossi Fanelli M.R. Antonini E. Methods Enzymol. 1981; 76: 72-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar), or by boiling for 50 s in the presence of 2% SDS and analyzed for heme content after electrophoresis in urea-containing polyacrylamide gels. Surprisingly, cytochrome b 6 continued to stain for heme by the TMBZ assay even after these treatments (Fig.1 A). To confirm that this property is unique to cytochrome b 6, we used a membrane preparation from bovine heart mitochondria to analyze the heme-cytochrome b interaction after electrophoresis on a 15% acrylamide gel containing 0.1% SDS (Fig. 1 B). This gel system resolves the closely migrating mitochondrial cytochrome b and c 1 (33Berry E.A. Huang L.-S. DeRose V.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 9064-9077Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). As noted in that work, TMBZ staining revealed only one slowly migrating band, attributed to cytochrome c 1, and a high mobility band, typical of cytochrome c, with no evidence for cytochrome b staining. By contrast, cytochrome b 6 was heavily stained with TMBZ under these conditions (Fig. 1 B). These experiments point to unusually tight binding of heme(s) to cytochrome b 6,i.e. resistant to denaturation. Since cytochrome b 6 did not stain with TMBZ more heavily than cytochrome f, which binds only one heme, we suggest that only part of the b heme complement of cytochrome b 6 is tightly associated with the polypeptide. To determine whether we could distinguish which of the two hemes bound tightly to apocytochrome b 6 and whether both heme binding sites were required for cytochrome b 6 assembly, we used site-directed mutagenesis to construct petB genes in which one of the four heme-liganding histidines, either His100 and His202 to bh or His86 and His187 to bl, were substituted individually (Table I). At least three independent transformants for each modification were characterized for their biochemical properties. None of the transformants displayed a heme-stainable cytochrome b 6 after SDS-PAGE of solubilized membranes, and the level of heme-stained cytochrome f was reduced to that observed in a ΔpetBdeletion strain (data not sho"

Here, the in vivosubunit composition and stoichiometry of the oligosaccharyltransferase were investigated by attaching an epitope coding sequence to a previously characterized subunit gene, OST3. Five (Ost1p, Wbp1p, Swp1p, Ost2p, and Ost5p) of the seven polypeptides that were coimmunoprecipitated with the epitope-tagged Ost3p were identical to those obtained by the conventional purification procedure. Two additional coprecipitating polypeptides with apparent molecular masses of 60 and 3.6 kDa were identified as the 78-kDa Stt3 protein and the 36-residue Ost4 protein, respectively. Stt3p and Ost4p were previously identified in screens for gene products involved in N-linked glycosylation. Quantification of the in vivo radiolabeled subunits and the radioiodinated purified enzyme shows that the yeast oligosaccharyltransferase is composed of equimolar amounts of eight subunits. Exposure of the immunoprecipitated oligosaccharyltransferase to mild protein denaturants yielded a subcomplex comprised of Stt3p, Ost3p, and Ost4p. These experiments, taken together with genetic and biochemical evidence for subunit interactions, suggest that the enzyme is composed of the following three subcomplexes: (a) Stt3p-Ost4p-Ost3p, (b) Swp1p-Wbp1p-Ost2p, and (c) Ost1p-Ost5p.

N-Glycosylation of proteins is an essential, highly conserved protein modification reaction that occurs in all eukaryotic organisms. The oligosaccharyltransferase (OST) 1The abbreviations used are: OST, oligosaccharyltransferase; Endo H, endoglycosidase H; HA, influenza virus hemagglutinin; PVDF, polyvinylidene difluoride; bp, base pair(s); Tricine,N-[2-hydroxy-1,1-bis(hydroxymethyl)ethyl]glycine; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; nt, nucleotides. catalyzes the transfer of a preassembled high mannose oligosaccharide (Glc3Man9GlcNAc2) onto Asn-X-Ser/Thr acceptor sites on nascent polypeptides as they are translocated into the lumen of the rough endoplasmic reticulum (for reviews see Refs. 1Herscovics A. Orlean P. FASEB J. 1993; 7: 540-550Crossref PubMed Scopus (441) Google Scholar, and 2Silberstein S. Gilmore R. FASEB J. 1996; 10: 849-858Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). Biochemical, molecular biological, and genetic studies have led to the identification of a surprisingly large number of proteins that are required for the expression of wild-type OST activity. The yeast OST was initially purified as an oligomeric complex composed of six subunits that are designated as Ost1p (62/64 kDa), Wbp1p (45 kDa), Ost3p (34 kDa), Swp1p (30 kDa), Ost2p (16 kDa), and Ost5p (9 kDa) (3Kelleher D.J. Gilmore R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 12908-12917Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, catalytically active tetrameric OST complexes that appear to lack Ost2p and Ost5p have also been described (4Pathak R. Hendrickson T.L. Imperiali B. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 4179-4185Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 5Knauer R. Lehle L. FEBS Lett. 1994; 344: 83-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). In addition, the 34-kDa Ost3 protein appears to be present in reduced amounts relative to the other three subunits in the purified OST tetramer (4Pathak R. Hendrickson T.L. Imperiali B. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 4179-4185Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar), raising the possibility that oligomeric forms of the OST may exist that differ with respect to the presence of regulatory or accessory subunits. Prior to purification of the yeast enzyme, genetic and biochemical studies had established that Wbp1p and Swp1p were essential for in vivo and in vitro expression of OST activity (6te Heesen S. Knauer R. Lehle L. Aebi M. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 279-284Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar, 7te Heesen S. Janetzky B. Lehle L. Aebi M. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 2071-2075Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Mutations in genes encoding Ost1p, Ost2p, Ost3p, and Ost5p also cause substantial reductions in both the N-linked glycosylation of proteins in vivo and the transfer of dolichol-linked oligosaccharides to acceptor peptide substrates in vitro (8Silberstein S. Collins P.G. Kelleher D.J. Rapiejko P.J. Gilmore R. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 128: 525-536Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 9Silberstein S. Collins P.G. Kelleher D.J. Gilmore R. J.

Defects in the transfer and modification of N-linked oligosaccharides cause morphological, biochemical, and structural alterations in the yeast cell wall (12Klis F.M. Yeast. 1994; 10: 851-869Crossref PubMed Scopus (487) Google Scholar). Yeast mutants that are defective in the synthesis of the fully assembled dolichol oligosaccharide donor (alg mutants,i.e. asparagine-linkedglycosylation) or in the elongation of the N-linked oligosaccharide display an enhanced resistance to sodium vanadate (13Ballou L. Hitzeman R.A. Lewis M.S. Ballou C.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 3209-3212Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar) and are hypersensitive to aminoglycoside antibiotics (14Dean N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 1287-1291Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). The ost4 mutants, which were isolated based upon enhanced resistance to sodium vanadate, express greatly diminished OST activity in vivo and in vitro(15Chi J.H. Roos J. Dean N. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 3132-3140Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). The OST4 gene encodes a 36-residue hydrophobic protein that was not detected when the OST was purified. The glycosylation defect caused by the wbp1-2 mutation is exaggerated when assembly of the optimal oligosaccharide donor (Dol-PP-GlcNAc2Man9Glc3) for the OST is prevented by a mutation in the ALG5 gene, resulting in a synthetic lethal phenotype (16Stagljar I. te Heesen S. Aebi M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 5977-5981Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Based upon this observation, two genetic screens were devised, one of which was selective for mutations that affect assembly of the oligosaccharide donor (17Zufferey R. Knauer R. Burda P. Stagljar I. te Heesen S. Lehle L. Aebi M. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 4949-4960Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar), and a second that was selective for genes encoding the OST subunits (11Reiss G. te Heesen S. Gilmore R. Zufferey R. Aebi M. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 1164-1172Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). In addition to mutant alleles of genes that encode six of the known OST subunits (Wbp1p, Swp1p, Ost1p, Ost2p, Ost3p, and Ost5p) the latter screen yielded mutants in the STT3 locus (11Reiss G. te Heesen S. Gilmore R. Zufferey R. Aebi M. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 1164-1172Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Because the 78-kDa Stt3 protein had not been detected as a subunit in the purified OST complex (3Kelleher D.J. Gilmore R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 12908-12917Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 4Pathak R. Hendrickson T.L. Imperiali B.

FEBS Lett. 1994; 344: 83-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar), several alternative roles were proposed for the Stt3p (17Zufferey R. Knauer R. Burda P. Stagljar I. te Heesen S. Lehle L. Aebi M. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 4949-4960Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). To determine the composition and subunit stoichiometry of the native yeast OST, we appended an epitope recognized by an antibody raised against the influenza virus hemagglutinin (HA) to either the C terminus of Ost3p or Stt3p and expressed the epitope-tagged proteins in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Nondenaturing immunoprecipitation of the OST from radiolabeled cultures of a yeast strain expressing the epitope-tagged Ost3 protein showed that the yeast enzyme is composed of eight subunits (Stt3p, Ost1p, Wbp1p, Ost3p, Swp1p, Ost2p, Ost5p, and Ost4p) in approximately equimolar amounts. After exposure to mild denaturants Stt3p, Ost3p, and Ost4p remain bound to the immunoaffinity reagent suggesting that these subunits form a stable subcomplex within the oligosaccharyltransferase. These results are discussed in the context of a model for the structural organization of the OST complex. Standard yeast genetics (18Sherman F. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 194: 1-21PubMed Google Scholar) and molecular biology (19Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar) techniques were used for all strain constructions. The termination codon (nt 1370–1372) of the OST3 gene was replaced with an MscI restriction site (underlined) by PCR-based site-directed mutagenesis (20Chen B. Przybyla A.E. BioTechniques. 1994; 17: 657-659PubMed Google Scholar) to obtain the sequence 5′ AAATTGGCCAG 3′ using the plasmid pOST3-1 (10Karaoglu D. Kelleher D.J. Gilmore R. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 130: 567-577Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar) as the template. The resulting PCR fragment (nt 1098–1545) was subcloned into EcoRI-XbaI-digested pRS306OST3 (nt 1–1654 of the OST3 gene) to obtain pRS306OST3-M. A 90-bp DNA fragment encoding three tandem copies of the influenza virus hemagglutinin epitope (21Wilson I.A. Niman H.L. Houghten R.A. Cherenson A.R. Connolly M.L. Lerner R.A. Cell. 1984; 37: 767-778Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (658) Google Scholar) was obtained by PCR amplification of plasmid pGTEP1 (22Tyers M. Tokiwa G. Nash R. Futcher B. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 1773-1784Crossref PubMed Scopus (339) Google Scholar) using (5′ TACCCATACGATGTTCCTGAC 3′) and (5′ TCAGTGGCCATTAAGCGTAATCTGGAACGTCATA3′) as primers. The PCR product encoding the HA epitope was fused to a 269-bp PCR fragment corresponding to nucleotides 1098–1367 of the OST3 gene and amplified using a PCR ligation-PCR mutagenesis procedure (23Ali S.A. Steinkasserer A. BioTechniques. 1995; 18: 746-750PubMed Google Scholar). The final DNA fragment was digested with EcoRI and MscI and cloned into the EcoRI-MscI-digested pRS306OST3-M to obtain plasmid pRS306OST3-HA3 encoding Ost3p bearing a C-terminal triple HA epitope tag. After digestion with MluI and EcoRI to delete nucleotides 287–1098 in the OST3 gene, pRS306OST3-HA3 was used to transform strain RGY323 (MATα ura3-52 leu2-Δ1 lys2-801 ade2-101 trp1-Δ1 his3-Δ200) (10Karaoglu D.

The resulting strains are designated RGY330, RGY331, and RGY332, respectively. DNA fragments corresponding to the 5′ (−218 to 143) and 3′ (1633 to 2154) regions of the STT3 gene (24Yoshida S. Ohya Y.

The PCR products were ligated and further amplified as described above. The resulting DNA fragment was digested with HindIII and subcloned into HindIII-MscI-digested pRS306OST3-HA3 to obtain pRS306ΔSTT3-HA3. The latter plasmid contains the STT3 gene bearing an internal deletion fused to the triple HA tag followed by 175 bp of the 3′-untranslated sequence from the OST3 gene. After digestion with EcoRI, pRS306ΔSTT3-HA3 was used to transform strains RGY323, RGY322 (MATaΔost3::LEU2 ura3–52 leu2-Δ1 lys2-801 ade2-101 trp1-Δ1 his3-Δ200) (10Karaoglu D. Kelleher D.J. Gilmore R.

A two-step PCR-based gene disruption method (25Wach A. Brachat A. Alberti-Segui C. Rebischung C. Philippsen P. Yeast. 1997; 13: 1065-1075Crossref PubMed Scopus (508) Google Scholar) was used to produce a linear DNA fragment containing a heterologous HIS3 marker flanked by 5′ (−215 to 88) and 3′ (199 to 398) untranslated homology regions from the OST4gene (15Chi J.H. Roos J. Dean N. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 3132-3140Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). The pFA6a-HIS3MX6 plasmid, which was used as a template for the PCR reaction, was provided by Dr. Peter Philippsen (University of Basel, Switzerland). RGY330 and RGY340 were transformed to histidine prototrophy using the PCR product to obtain strains designated as RGY333 and RGY344. Integration of the HIS3 marker into the OST4 gene was confirmed by PCR. A 1655-bp HindIII-StyI fragment derived from pOST3-1 (10Karaoglu D. Kelleher D.J. Gilmore R. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 130: 567-577Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar) was subcloned into the HindIII-SmaI-digested 2-μm plasmid pRS426 (26Christianson T.W. Sikorski R.S. Dante M. Shero J.H. Hieter P. Gene (Amst.). 1992; 110: 119-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (1438) Google Scholar). The resulting plasmid, pRS426OST3, or the vector pRS426 was transformed into the strains MA7-B and MA9-D (7te Heesen S. Janetzky B. Lehle L. Aebi M. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 2071-2075Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Transformants selected at 25 °C on synthetic complete media lacking uracil were tested for growth at 25 and 37 °C. An HindIII-BamHI fragment from pRS426OST3, containing the OST3 gene (nt 1–1655), was subcloned into HindIII-BamHI-digested pGEM-4Z (Promega Biotech, Madison, WI) to obtain pOST3-2. The HpaI-SmaI fragment of the URA3 gene from YEp352 (27Hill J.E. Myers A.M. Koerner T.J. Tzagoloff A. Yeast. 1986; 2: 163-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (1083) Google Scholar) was ligated into MluI-AccI-digested blunt-ended pOST3-2, thereby replacing nucleotides 287–1187 of the OST3 gene with a URA3 marker. The resulting plasmid, pΔOST3URA3, was digested with SspI and EcoRI prior to transformation of RGY323 and MA-9D strains. Transformants selected at 25 °C on synthetic complete media lacking uracil were tested for growth on YPD plates at 25 and 30 °C. Yeast cells were grown for 15–20 h at 25 °C in synthetic minimal media (2% glucose) supplemented with the appropriate amino acids until mid log phase (A 600 of 0.8–1.6). Cells were collected by centrifugation and resuspended at 5A 600/ml in minimal medium. Cells were labeled for 20 min or 1 h, as indicated, with 100 μCi of [35S]methionine (>1000 Ci/mmol, NEN Life Science Products) per A 600 units of cells. Labeling was terminated by the addition of NaN3 to 10 mm. Hereafter, all the procedures were carried out at 4 °C. To prepare lysates for nondenaturing immunoprecipitation, cells were washed once with 20 mm Tris-Cl (pH 7.4), 100 mm NaCl, and resuspended in 5% glycerol, 20 mm Tris-Cl (pH 7.4), 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and a protease inhibitor mixture (3Kelleher D.J. Gilmore R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 12908-12917Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). After rapid lysis of cells with glass beads, the homogenates were adjusted to 1.5% digitonin, 0.5m NaCl, 20 mm Tris-Cl (pH 7.4), 3.5 mm MgCl2, and 1 mmMnCl2. The extracts were centrifuged for 20 min at 135,000 × g in an airfuge (Beckman Instruments, Palo Alto, CA) using a A-100/30 rotor, and the clarified supernatants were used for immunoprecipitations. For immunoprecipitation with the HA.11 antibody (Babco, Richmond, CA), cell lysates from radiolabeled cells were mixed with unlabeled lysates prepared from an equal quantity of cells that do not express the HA-tagged protein. Extracts that were precleared by prior incubation with protein A-Sepharose beads were incubated overnight with the HA.11 antibody. After a 2-h incubation with the protein A-Sepharose beads, the beads were recovered by centrifugation and washed three times with Nikkol buffer (1m NaCl, 50 mm Tris-Cl (pH 7.4), 1 mm MgCl2, 1 mm MnCl2, 1 mm CaCl2, 0.02% Nikkol (Nikko Chemical Co., Ltd., Tokyo, Japan)) and once with 50 mm Tris-Cl (pH 7.4), 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA. Denaturing immunoprecipitations were performed as described previously (28Rothblatt J. Schekman R. Methods Cell Biol. 1989; 32: 3-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Endoglycosidase H (Endo H; New England Biolabs, Beverly, MA) digestions were performed according to the manufacturer's recommendations. Immunoprecipitated proteins were incubated for 30 min at 55 °C in SDS sample buffer and resolved on either Tris glycine-buffered or Tris-Tricine-buffered SDS-polyacrylamide gels (29Schägger H. von Jagow G. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 166: 368-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (10505) Google Scholar). Microsomal membranes were isolated from wild-type or mutant cells as described (10Karaoglu D. Kelleher D.J. Gilmore R. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 130: 567-577Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Microsomes or samples from nondenaturing immunoprecipitations were resolved by SDS-PAGE and transferred to PVDF membranes. The membranes were probed with antibodies to Ost1p, Wbp1p, the HA epitope, Swp1p, Ost2p, and Ost5p as described (10Karaoglu D. Kelleher D.J. Gilmore R. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 130: 567-577Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Antibody to Ost5p was raised against the N-terminal sequence that precedes the first membrane spanning segment and was provided by Dr. Markus Aebi (ETH, Zurich, Switzerland). Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies were visualized using enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL Western blotting detection kit, Amersham Corp.). Radioiodination of the purified yeast OST complex using a chloramine-T oxidation procedure was performed after denaturation in SDS as described previously for the canine OST (30Kelleher D.J. Gilmore R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 4994-4999Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). A 30-amino acid sequence corresponding to three tandem repeats of the HA epitope was appended to the C terminus of Ost3p to serve as an affinity tag for immunopurification of the yeast OST. A one-step allele replacement method was used to substitute the epitope-tagged OST3 allele for the chromosomal copy of OST3 in a haploid yeast strain. Replacement of the wild-type Ost3 protein with the epitope-tagged Ost3 protein had no detectable effect on cell growth or in vivoOST activity indicating that HA-tagged Ost3p is fully functional (not shown). Protein immunoblot and denaturing immunoprecipitation experiments showed that the monoclonal anti-HA antibody recognized a protein of about 36 kDa in total cell extracts prepared from a strain that expresses the HA-tagged Ost3 protein but not from a strain that expresses untagged Ost3p (not shown). To identify proteins that were specifically associated with Ost3p under nondenaturing conditions, total cell homogenates prepared from [35S]methionine-labeled yeast cultures were solubilized with the nonionic detergent digitonin. Six radiolabeled polypeptides ranging in molecular mass from 3.6 to 64 kDa were immunoprecipitated using the monoclonal antibody to the HA epitope from extracts containing the HA-tagged Ost3p (Fig.1 A). Coimmunoprecipitation of the radiolabeled polypeptides with the HA-tagged Ost3 protein was specific, as none of the proteins were recovered in immunoprecipitates from the control strain that expresses untagged Ost3p. To facilitate the assignment of the previously characterized OST subunits, we transferred the immunoprecipitated proteins from a polyacrylamide gel onto a PVDF membrane for protein immunoblot analysis (Fig.1 B). Each of the six polypeptides that had been described as subunits of the OST complex (3Kelleher D.J. Gilmore R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 12908-12917Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) were unambiguously identified. The single N-terminal methionine residue in the Ost5p sequence is removed from the mature protein (11Reiss G. te Heesen S. Gilmore R. Zufferey R. Aebi M. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 1164-1172Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar); therefore, Ost5p was not detected as a radiolabeled product in the immunoprecipitate from [35S]methionine-labeled cells (Fig. 1 A) but was detected when cultures were labeled with a mixture of [35S]cysteine and [35S]methionine (not shown). Protein immunoblots using an antibody raised against the N terminus of Ost5p revealed an immunoreactive 9-kDa protein. We hypothesized that the polypeptide that migrates slightly slower than the 3.4-kDa molecular weight marker is the 36-residue Ost4 protein. Support for this conclusion is presented in Fig. 4.Figure 4Loss of Ost4p destabilizes a Stt3p-Ost4p-Ost3p subcomplex. The OST was immunoprecipitated with the anti-HA antibody under nondenaturing conditions from radiolabeled cultures of the wild-type (WT) and the Δost4mutant strains that express either HA-tagged Ost3p (+) or HA-tagged Stt3p (+). The immunoprecipitates were washed with either Nikkol buffer (lanes a, b, d, and e), or Triton X-100/SDS-mixed micelle buffer (50 mm Tris-Cl (pH 7.4), 150 mmNaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 1% Triton X-100, and 0.2% SDS) supplemented with 2 m urea (lanes c, f, and g). The OST subunits were resolved in SDS-PAGE.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To calculate the relative molar amounts of the OST subunits in the immunoprecipitates, polyacrylamide gels (Fig. 1 A) containing [35S]methionine-labeled samples were quantified. The relative intensity of each radiolabeled polypeptide should be directly proportional to the methionine content of each subunit provided that the subunits are present in equimolar amounts. The calculated amounts of the OST subunits relative to the tagged Ost3p protein were as follows: Ost1p (3.2), Wbp1p (2.4), Ost3p (1.0), Swp1p (0.9), Ost2p (1.5), and Ost4p (0.4). The apparent excess of Ost1p and Wbp1p relative to the other subunits prompted further examination of this region of the autoradiogram. Protein immunoblots of the native immunoprecipitate revealed a glycoform doublet for Ost1p (Fig. 1 B) rather than the broad band that was visible in the native immunoprecipitate (Fig.1 A). A successive immunoprecipitation experiment was performed to determine whether the excess radiolabel in the Ost1p region of the gel could be explained by a fortuitous comigration of Ost1p with another polypeptide. After the OST was immunoprecipitated under nondenaturing conditions from the HA-tagged Ost3p strain (Fig.2 A, lane b), the immune complexes were denatured in SDS and subjected to a second immunoprecipitation using an antibody to Ost1p. The Ost1p glycoform doublet that was recovered after denaturing immunoprecipitation (Fig.2 A, lane c) migrated slightly slower than an intensely labeled diffuse band that was recovered in the unbound fraction with the other OST subunits (Fig. 2 A, lane d). Given the genetic evidence supporting a role for the Stt3 protein in N-linked glycosylation (11Reiss G. te Heesen S. Gilmore R. Zufferey R. Aebi M. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 1164-1172Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar), the 78-kDa Stt3 protein (17Zufferey R. Knauer R. Burda P. Stagljar I. te Heesen S. Lehle L. Aebi M. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 4949-4960Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar) was the most likely candidate for the diffusely migrating polypeptide. To obtain more direct evidence that Stt3p is a subunit of the OST, total cell extracts were prepared from [35S]methionine-labeled cultures of a yeast strain that expresses HA-tagged Stt3p (Fig.2 B). At least four of the polypeptides (Wbp1p, Swp1p, Ost2p, and Ost4p) that copurified with HA-tagged Ost3p (Fig. 2 B, lane b) comigrated precisely with proteins that copurified with HA-tagged Stt3p (Fig. 2 B, lane c). The identity of the HA-tagged Stt3 protein was confirmed by immunoprecipitating the tagged protein from SDS-denatured cell extracts (Fig. 2 B, lane d). The addition of the 3-kDa affinity tag to the C terminus of Stt3p is responsible for the decreased mobility of HA-tagged Stt3p relative to untagged Stt3p (Fig. 2 B, compare lanes b and c). Endoglycosidase H digestion of the HA-tagged Stt3p (Fig.2 B, lane e) increased the mobility of the protein consistent with a previous report that the lumenal domain of Stt3p contains at least one N-linked oligosaccharide (17Zufferey R. Knauer R. Burda P. Stagljar I. te Heesen S. Lehle L. Aebi M. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 4949-4960Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). Deglycosylated Stt3p migrated as a broad band indicating that heterogeneous glycosylation is not responsible for the diffuse electrophoretic migration of the polypeptide. As expected, the untagged Ost3 protein migrated slightly slower than Swp1p (Fig. 2 B, lane c). Although the preceding experiments demonstrated that the immunopurified OST complex contains Stt3p, a protein of this size had not been detected when the hexameric or tetrameric OST complexes were resolved by SDS-PAGE and stained with either Coomassie Blue or with Silver (3Kelleher D.J. Gilmore R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 12908-12917Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 4Pathak R. Hendrickson T.L. Imperiali B.

To resolve this discrepancy, the OST was purified as described previously (3Kelleher D.J. Gilmore R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 12908-12917Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), denatured in SDS, and radiolabeled with125I. Resolution of the radioiodinated OST subunits by PAGE in SDS revealed an intensely labeled polypeptide that migrated in the vicinity of Ost1p (Fig. 2 B) rather than the well resolved Ost1p glycoform doublet that we detect by staining with Coomassie Blue. Radiolabeled bands corresponding to the other OST subunits (Wbp1p, Ost3p, Swp1p, Ost2p, and Ost5p) were also detected. Radiolabeled aprotinin (∼6.5 kDa), a protease inhibitor that is included in the buffer used for the OST purification (Fig. 2 B), was not effectively separated from 9.5-kDa Ost5p on this gel but was resolved on a 7.5–17.5% polyacrylamide gel (see Fig.3). We were not able to unambiguously assign a radiolabeled band to Ost4p due, in part, to the presence of a single tyrosine residue in this protein. The subunit stoichiometry of the yeast OST was recalculated in light of the discovery that Stt3p was not resolved from Ost1p in Fig. 1. The value presented in Table I for the molar ratio of Ost1p and Stt3p relative to Ost3p assumes that equal amounts of Ost1p and Stt3p are present. The results of this analysis suggest that the OST subunits are present in equimolar amounts in the immunopurified complex. Wbp1p and Ost2p each contain a single methionine residue; consequently, the values we obtain for these subunits are subject to the greatest error. The subunit stoichiometry was also calculated after quantification of the radioiodinated OST subunits (Fig. 2 B and Fig. 3). If the OST complex contains equimolar amounts of the subunits, the incorporation of125I should be proportional to the tyrosine content of the subunits provided that the radioiodination efficiency of individual tyrosine residues is comparable after denaturation with SDS. Quantification of the 125I-labeled OST subunits also indicated that the seven larger OST subunits are present in roughly equimolar amounts in the purified yeast OST complex (Table I).Table IYeast OST complex subunit stoichiometrySubunitMolecular massNumber of methioninesMolar ratio1-aThe relative molar amounts of OST subunits, labeled either with [35S]methionine (Fig. 1 A) or with125I (Fig. 2 B and Fig. 3), were estimated by scanning polyacrylamide gels using a PhosphorImager.

L., Papaconstantinou, J., and Weigel, P. H. (1993) J. Biol. Chem. 268, 19181–19184). Group A spHAS was unrelated to a putative Group C HA synthase reported by others (Lansing, M., Lellig, S., Mausolf, A., Martini, I., Crescenzi, F., Oregon, M., and Prehm, P. (1993) Biochem. J. 289, 179–184). Here we report the isolation of a bona fide HA synthase gene from a highly encapsulated strain of Group C Streptococcus equisimilis. The encoded protein, designated seHAS, is 417 amino acids long (calculated molecular weight, 47,778; calculated pI, 9.1) and is the smallest member of the HAS family identified thus far. The enzyme migrates anomalously fast in SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (∼42,000 Da). The seHAS protein shows no similarity (<2% identity) to the previously reported Group C gene, which is not an HA synthase. The seHAS and spHAS protein and coding sequences are 72 and 70% identical, respectively. seHAS is also similar to eukaryotic HAS1 (∼31% identical), HAS2 (∼28% identical), and HAS3 (28% identical). The deduced protein sequence of seHAS was confirmed by reactivity with a synthetic peptide antibody. Recombinant seHAS expressed in Escherichia coli was recovered in membranes as a major protein (∼10% of the total protein) and synthesized very large HA (M r >7 × 106) in the presence of UDP-GlcNAc and UDP-GlcA. The product contained equimolar amounts of both sugars and was degraded by the specific Streptomyces hyaluronidase. Comparison of the two recombinant streptococcal enzymes in isolated membranes showed that seHAS and spHAS are essentially identical in the steady-state size distribution of HA chains they synthesize, but seHAS has an intrinsic 2-fold faster rate of chain elongation (V max) than spHAS. seHAS is the most active HA synthase identified thus far; it polymerizes HA at an average rate of 160 monosaccharides/s.

Although the cloned Group C gene was isolated using an antibody that partially inhibited HA synthesis activity, the encoded protein was not expressed by these investigators, and it was, therefore, never shown to possess the ability to make HA. Because spHAS shows high similarity (∼30% identity) to all of the subsequently identified HAS proteins (4Weigel P.H. Hascall V.C. Tammi M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 13997-14000Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (624) Google Scholar), it seemed unlikely that the reported Group C protein could be a bona fide HA synthase. To clarify this confusion in the literature and to pursue our interest in elucidating details of HA biosynthesis, we undertook an independent effort to clone the Group C HAS. Here we report that the authentic active seHAS is 417 amino acids long (molecular weight 47,778), 72% identical to spHAS, and ∼30% identical to the eukaryotic members of the HAS family. Oligonucleotide primers were synthesized by Genosys Biotechnologies, Inc. (The Woodlands, TX) and the Great American Gene Co. (Ransom Hill Bioscience, Inc., CA). Cy-5 fluorescent sequencing primers were synthesized by the Molecular Biology Resource Facility, Oklahoma University Health Sciences Center. Restriction and DNA modifying enzymes were from Promega unless noted otherwise. UDP-GlcNAc and UDP-GlcA were from Fluka, and all other chemicals were of the highest grade available, from Sigma unless noted otherwise. UDP-[14C]GlcA (318 mCi/mmol) was from ICN Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (Costa Mesa, CA), and UDP-[3H]GlcNAc (29.2 Ci/mmol) was from NEN Life Science Products (Boston, MA). The mucoid Group C strain D181 (Streptococcus equisimilis) was obtained from the Rockfeller University Collection. The E. coli host strains SURE and XL1-Blue MRF′ were from Stratagene, and strain Top10 F′ was from Invitrogen. Unless otherwise noted, streptococci were grown in Todd Hewitt medium supplemented with 1% (w/v) yeast extract (from Difco), and E. coli strains were grown in LB medium. The pKK223 expression vector was from Pharmacia Biotech Inc., PCR2.1 cloning vector (original TA cloning kit) was from Invitrogen, and Predigested Zap ExpressTM BamHI/CIAP Vector cloning kit was from Stratagene. High molecular mass genomic DNA from S. equisimilis, isolated by the method of Caparon and Scott (18Caparon M.G. Scott J.R. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 204: 556-586Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar), was partially digested with Sau3A1 to an average size of 2–12 kb. The digested DNA was precipitated with ethanol, washed, and ligated to the BamHI/CIAP/Zap Express vector. Ligated DNA was packaged into phage with phage extract (from Promega) according to instructions. The titer of the packaged phage library was determined using XL1-Blue MRF′ as a host. Degenerate oligonucleotides were designed based upon conserved sequences among spHAS (Streptococcus pyogenes), DG42 (Xenopus laevisHAS; Ref. 19DeAngelis P.L. Achyuthan A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 23657-23660Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar) and nodC (a Rhizobium meliloti modulation factor; Ref. 20Nagahashi S. Sudoh M. Ono N. Sawada R.

Amplification conditions using Taq polymerase (Promega) were 34 cycles at 94 °C for 1 min, 44 °C for 1 min, and 72 °C for 1.5 min followed by a final extension at 72 °C for 10 min. Oligonucleotide HADRF1, 5′-GAYMGAYRTYTXACXAATTAYGCTATHGAYTTRGG-3′ (sense strand) corresponds to the region 259DRCLTNYAIDL (spHAS). Oligonucleotide HACTR1, 5′-ACGWGTWCCCCANTCXGYATTTTTNADXGTRCA-3′ (antisense strand) corresponds to the region404CTIKNTEWGTR (spHAS). These two oligonucleotides gave a 459-bp PCR product, which was separated on an agarose gel and purified using the Geneclean kit (BIO 101, Inc.). This fragment was then cloned into the PCR2.1 vector using Top10 F′ cells as a host according to the manufacturer's directions. Double-stranded plasmid DNA was purified from E. coli (Top10 F′) using the QIAfilter Plasmid Midi kit (Qiagen). Two other degenerate sense primers were also synthesized: HAVAF1, 5′-GTNGCTGCTGTWRTXCCWWSXTWTAAYGARGA-3′ (corresponding to region66VAAVIPSYNE of spHAS), and HAVDF1, 5′-GTXRWTGAYGGNWSXWSNRAXGATGAXGC-3′ (based on 100VDDGSSNTD of spHAS). Two unique antisense primers were synthesized based on the sequence of the 459-bp PCR product. These were D181.2, 5′-GAAGGACTTGTTCCAGCGGT-3′, and D181.4, 5′-TGAATGTTCCGACACAGGGC-3′. Each of the two degenerate sense primers, when used with either D181.2 or D181.4 to amplify D181 genomic DNA, gave PCR products of the expected size. The four PCR products were cloned and sequenced using the same strategy as above. For each PCR product, sequences obtained from six different clones were compared to derive a consensus sequence. Thus, we obtained a 1042-bp sequence with a continuous ORF with high homology to spHAS. Two molecular probes were used to screen the library, the cloned 459-bp PCR product and the antisense oligonucleotide D181.5 (5′-GCTTGATAGGTCACCAGTGTCACG-3′; derived from the 1042-bp sequence). The 459-bp PCR product was radiolabeled using the Prime-It II random primer labeling kit (Stratagene) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Oligonucleotides were labeled with the Kinace-It kinasing kit (Stratagene) using [γ−32P]ATP. Radiolabeled products were separated from nonlabeled material on NucTrap Push columns (Stratagene). The 459-bp probe gave a high level of nonspecific hybridization with the λ phage vector. The oligoprobe, however, hybridized specifically with a D181 genomic digest on Southern blots. To screen the λ phage library, XL1-Blue MRF′ was used as a host (3000 plaques/plate). Nitrocellulose membranes (0.45 μm; Micron Separations, Inc., Westboro, MA) containing adsorbed phage were prehybridized at 60 °C and hybridized with the 5′-end-labeled oligonucleotide D181.5 in QuikHyb hybridization solution (Stratagene) at 80 °C. The membranes were washed with 2× SSC buffer and 0.1% (w/v) SDS at room temperature for 15 min, washed with 0.1× SSC buffer and 0.1% (w/v) SDS at 60 °C for 30 min, dried, and then exposed to Bio-Max MS film overnight at −70 °C. Positive plaques were replated and rescreened twice. Pure positive phages were saved in 0.1 m NaCl, 14 mmMgSO4, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, and 0.1% (w/v) gelatin with chloroform. PCR on these phages using vector primers revealed three different insert sizes. PCR with a combination of vector primers and primers from different regions of the cloned 1042-bp sequence revealed that only one of the three different phages had the complete HAS gene. The insert size in this phage was 6.5 kb. Attempts to subclone the insert into a plasmid form failed. Therefore, a PCR strategy was applied again on the pure positive phage DNA to obtain the 5′- and 3′-ends of the ORF. Oligonucleotide primers D181.3 (5′-GCCCTGTGTCGGAACATTCA-3′) and T3 (vector primer) amplified a 3-kb product, and oligonucleotides D181.5 and T7 (vector primer) amplified a 2.5 kb product. The 5′- and 3′-end sequences of the ORF were obtained by sequencing these two above products. Analysis of all PCR product sequences allowed reconstruction of the 1254-bp seHAS ORF. PCR primers were designed at the start and stop codon regions of seHAS to contain an EcoRI restriction site in the sense oligonucleotide (5′-AGGATCCGAATTCATGAGAACATTAAAAAACCTC-3′) and a PstI site in the antisense oligonucleotide (5′-AGAATTCTGCAGTTATAATAATTTTTTACGTGT-3′). Using Pfu DNA polymerase (Stratagene), these primers amplified a 1.2-kb PCR product from D181 genomic DNA, as well as from the purified hybridization-positive phage. The 1.2-kb product from genomic DNA was purified by agarose gel electrophoresis, digested with PstI and EcoRI, and cloned directionally into PstI- and EcoRI-digested pKK223 vector. The ligated vector was transformed into E. coli SURE cells that were then grown at 30 °C. Colonies were isolated, and their plasmid DNA was purified. Of six colonies, five had the correct size insert, and one had no insert. All five clones were verified to have HAS activity, and the inserts were sequenced. HA synthase activity was assayed in membranes prepared from fresh log phase cells. Cells were harvested at 3000 × g and washed at 4 °C with phosphate-buffered saline, and membranes were isolated by a modification of the protoplast method of Ito et al. (21Ito K. Sato T. Yura T. Cell. 1977; 11: 551-559Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar) as described earlier (22DeAngelis P.L. Weigel P.H. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 9033-9039Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Membranes from Streptococcus pyogenes and S. equisimilis were obtained by a modification (22DeAngelis P.L. Weigel P.H. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 9033-9039Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar) of the protoplast procedure of Van de Rijn and Drake (23van de Rijn I. Drake R.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 24302-24306Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Membranes were incubated at 37 °C in 50 mm sodium and potassium phosphate, pH 7.0, with 20 mm MgCl2, 1 mmdithioerythritol, 120 μm UDP-GlcA, and 300 μm UDP-GlcNAc. Incorporation of sugar was monitored by using UDP-[14C]GlcA and/or UDP-[3H]GlcNAc. Reactions were terminated by addition of SDS to a final concentration of 2% (w/v) and heating at 90 °C for 1 min. Product HA was separated from precursors by descending paper chromatography and measured by determining incorporated radioactivity remaining at the origin (22DeAngelis P.L. Weigel P.H. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 9033-9039Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar, 24Triscott M.X. van de Rijn I. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 6004-6009Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Radiolabeled HA produced in vitro by membranes containing recombinant seHAS or spHAS was analyzed by gel filtration chromatography on a column (1.0 × 50 cm) of Sephacryl S500HR or S400HR (Pharmacia). Samples (0.2 ml) were eluted with 5 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 0.2 m NaCl, and 1.0 ml fractions were collected and assessed for 14C and/or3H radioactivity. Authenticity of the HA polysaccharide was assessed by treatment of product with the HA-specific hyaluronate lyase of Streptomyces hyalurolyticus (EC 4.2.2.1; Ref. 18Caparon M.G. Scott J.R. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 204: 556-586Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar) at 37 °C for 3 h. The digest was then subjected to gel filtration. SDS-PAGE was performed according to the method of Laemmli (25Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207231) Google Scholar). Electrotransfers to nitrocellulose (0.1 μm; Schleicher & Schuell) were performed in 20% methanol using a Bio-Rad mini Transblot device. The blots were blocked with 2% bovine serum albumin in TBS. Protein A/G alkaline phosphatase conjugate (Pierce) and p-nitroblue tetrazolium/5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate p-toluidine salt (Bio-Rad) were used for detection. Plasmids were sequenced on both strands by the Oklahoma University Health Sciences Center Sequencing Facility using fluorescent vector primers. Sequencing reactions were performed using a Thermosequenase kit (Amersham Corp.) for fluorescent-labeled primers (with 7-deazaG). Samples were electrophoresed on a Pharmacia ALF Express DNA sequencer, and data were analyzed by the ALF Manager program, version 3.02. Internal regions of inserts were sequenced with internal primers using the ABI Prism 377 program, version 2.1.1. Ambiguous regions were sequenced manually using SequenaseTM 7-deaza-DNA polymerase (United States Biochemical) and α-35S-labeled dATP (Amersham Life Sciences). The sequences obtained were compiled and analyzed using DNASIS, version 2.1 (Hitachi Software Engineering Co., Ltd.). The nucleotide and amino acid sequences were compared with other sequences in GenBankTM and other data bases. Radioactivity was determined using Ultima Gold scintillation fluid (Packard) in a Packard Tri-Carb model 2300TR liquid scintillation spectrometer. Protein was quantitated by the method of Bradford (26Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (216440) Google Scholar) using bovine serum albumin as a standard. Initial attempts to clone the seHAS gene by screening Group C genomic DNA or a library for the ability to hybridize with nucleic acid probes based on the complete spHAS coding sequence (8DeAngelis P.L. Papaconstantinou J. Weigel P.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 19181-19184Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) were unsuccessful. In retrospect, this result may be due to the fact that the longest identical region between the two genes is only 20 bp. There are numerous mismatches throughout the two coding regions that might have compromised efficient hybridization with the full-length probe. We then turned to a PCR approach using oligonucleotide primers based on several regions of high identity among spHAS, DG42 (now known to be a developmentally regulated X. laevis HAS and designated xlHAS; Ref. 4Weigel P.H. Hascall V.C. Tammi M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 13997-14000Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (624) Google Scholar), and NodC (a Rhizobium β-GlcNAc transferase; Ref. 20Nagahashi S. Sudoh M. Ono N. Sawada R. Yamaguchi E. Uchida Y. Mio T. Takagi M. Arisawa M. Yamada-Okabe H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 13961-13967Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). The xlHAS and NodC proteins are ∼50 and ∼10% identical to spHAS, respectively. This strategy yielded a 459-bp PCR product, the sequence of which was 66.4% identical to spHAS, indicating that a Group C homologue of the Group A HA synthase gene had been identified. The complete coding region of the gene was then reconstructed using a similar PCR-based strategy as outlined under “Experimental Procedures” (Fig. 1). A final set of PCR primers was then used to amplify the complete ORF from genomic DNA. When this 1.2-kb PCR fragment was incorporated into the expression vector pKK223 and transformed into E. coli SURE cells, HA synthase activity was demonstrated in isolated membranes from 5 of the 5 colonies tested. The ORF of the reconstructed gene encodes a novel predicted protein of 417 amino acids that was not in the data base (Fig. 1); it is 2 amino acids shorter than spHAS (4Weigel P.H. Hascall V.C. Tammi M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 13997-14000Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (624) Google Scholar, 8DeAngelis P.L. Papaconstantinou J. Weigel P.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 19181-19184Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The two bacterial proteins are 72% identical (Fig. 2), and the nucleic acid sequences are 70% identical. The predicted molecular weight of the seHAS protein is 47,778, and the predicted pI is at pH 9.1. The three recently identified mammalian HASs are clearly related to the bacterial proteins (Fig. 3). The overall identity between the two groups is ∼28–31%, and in addition, many amino acids in seHAS are highly conserved with those of the eukaryotic HASs (e.g. Lys/Arg or Asp/Glu substitutions). Within mammalian species, the same family members are almost completely identical (e.g. muHAS1 and huHAS1 are 95% identical; muHAS2 and huHAS2 are 98% identical). However, even within the same species, the different HAS family members are more divergent (e.g. muHAS1 and muHAS2 are 53% identical; muHAS1 and muHAS3 are 57% identical; muHAS2 and muHAS3 are 71% identical).Figure 3Evolutionary relationships among the known hyaluronan synthases. The phylogenetic tree was generated by the Higgins-Sharp (43Higgins D.G. Sharp P.M.

Hascall V.C. Tammi M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 13997-14000Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (624) Google Scholar). The protein has two putative transmembrane domains at the amino terminus and 2–3 membrane-associated or transmembrane domains at the carboxyl end (Fig. 4 B). The hydropathy plots for the two streptococcal enzymes are virtually identical (Fig. 4 A), and they illustrate the difficulty in predicting the topology of the extremely hydrophobic region of ∼90 residues at Lys313–Arg406 in seHAS (Lys313–Lys405 in spHAS). We have proposed (4Weigel P.H. Hascall V.C. Tammi M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 13997-14000Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (624) Google Scholar) that predicted MD5 is not a transmembrane domain but, rather, MD5 is an amphipathic helix or a reentrant loop that remains on the cytoplasmic side of the membrane. seHAS was efficiently expressed in E. coli cells. Approximately 10% of the total membrane protein was seHAS as assessed by densitometric scanning (Fig. 5). The prominent seHAS band at 42 kDa is quantitatively missing in the vector-only control (lane E versus lane V). This unusually high level of expression for a membrane protein was also found for spHAS, using the same vector in E. coli SURE cells (Fig. 5,lane P). About 8% of the membrane protein in this case is spHAS. In contrast, the amount of seHAS in Group C membranes (Fig. 5,lane C) is not more than 1% of the total membrane protein. The spHAS in Group A membranes (Fig. 5, lane A) is barely detectable. The recombinant seHAS expressed in E. coli SURE cells does not synthesize HA in vivo because these cells lack UDP-GlcA, one of the required substrates (not shown). Membranes containing the recombinant seHAS protein, however, synthesize HA when provided with the substrates UDP-GlcNAc and UDP-GlcA (TableI). Using 120 μm UDP-GlcA and 300 μm UDP-GlcNAc, HA synthesis was linear with membrane protein (at ≤0.2 μg) for at least 1 h (not shown). Also, membranes prepared from nontransformed cells or cells transformed with vector alone have no detectable HAS activity. HA synthesis is negligible (Table I) when Mg2+ is chelated with EDTA or when either of the two substrates is omitted (1–3% of control). Recombinant seHAS also showed the expected specificity for sugar nucleotide substrates, being unable to copolymerize either UDP-GalA, UDP-Glc, or UDP-GalNAc with either of the two normal substrates (TableI).Table ISugar nucleotide specificity and magnesium ion requirement of recombinant seHASSecond sugar nucleotide presentHA synthesis1-aMembranes (324 ng of protein) were incubated at 37 °C for 1 h with either 120 μmUDP-[14C]GlcA (2.8 × 104 dpm) or 300 μm UDP-[3H]GlcNAc (2 × 104 dpm).

The radiolabeled sugar nucleotide was used in the presence of the indicated second, nonlabeled sugar nucleotide. HA synthase activity was determined as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Open table in a new tab Based on gel filtration analysis, the average mass of the HA synthesized by seHAS in isolated membranes is 5–10 × 106 Da (Fig. 6). The distribution of HA sizes resolved in this experiment ranged from 2 to 20 × 106. The product of the recombinant seHAS is judged to be authentic HA based on the equimolar incorporation of both sugars (1:1 ratio) and its sensitivity to degradation by the specific Streptomyces hyaluronidase (Fig. 6). Although the conditions for continuous total HA synthesis were not optimal in this case (because ∼90% of one substrate was incorporated into product), the enzyme produced a broad distribution of HA chain lengths. The peak fraction corresponds to an HA mass of 7.5 × 106 Da, which is a polymer containing approximately 36,000 monosaccharides. The deduced protein sequence of seHAS was confirmed by the ability of antibodies to the spHAS protein to cross-react with the Group C protein (Fig. 7). Polyclonal antibodies to the whole spHAS protein or to just the central domain of spHAS also reacted very well with the seHAS protein. (Fig. 7, lanes 7–"
https://openalex.org/W2049252219,"Elongation factor P (EFP) is a protein that stimulates the peptidyltransferase activity of fully assembled 70 S prokaryotic ribosomes and enhances the synthesis of certain dipeptides initiated by N-formylmethionine. This reaction appears conserved throughout species and is promoted in eukaryotic cells by a homologous protein, eIF5A. Here we ask whether the Escherichia coli gene encoding EFP is essential for cell viability. A kanamycin resistance (Kan R) gene was inserted near the N-terminal end of the efp gene and was cloned into a plasmid, pMAK705, that has a temperature-sensitive origin of replication. After transformation into a recA+ E. coli strain, temperature-sensitive mutants were isolated, and their chromosomal DNA was sequenced. Mutants containing the efp-Kan R gene in the chromosome grew at 33 °C only in the presence of the wild-type copy of the efp gene in the pMAK705 plasmid and were unable to grow at 44 °C. Incorporation of various isotopes in vivo suggests that translation is impaired in the efp mutant at 44 °C. At 44 °C, mutant cells are severely defective in peptide-bond formation. We conclude that the efp gene is essential for cell viability and is required for protein synthesis."
https://openalex.org/W2061270011,"The translation elongation factor (EF) Tu has chaperone-like capacity to promote renaturation of denatured rhodanese. This renaturation activity is greatly increased under conditions in which the factor can oscillate between the open and closed conformations that are induced by GDP and GTP, respectively.

Renaturation of rhodanese and GTP hydrolysis by EF-Tu are greatly enhanced by the guanine nucleotide exchange factor EF-Ts. However, renaturation is reduced under conditions that stabilize EF-Tu in either the open or closed conformation. Both GDP and the nonhydrolyzable analog of GTP, GMP-PCP, inhibit renaturation. Kirromycin and pulvomycin, antibiotics that specifically bind to EF-Tu and inhibit its activity in peptide elongation, also strongly inhibit EF-Tu-mediated renaturation of denatured rhodanese to levels near those observed for spontaneous, unassisted refolding. Kirromycin locks EF-Tu in the open conformation in the presence of either GTP or GDP, whereas pulvomycin locks the factor in the closed conformation.

Tu has been intensely studied for many years in relation to its role in the reaction cycle by which peptides are elongated on ribosomes. In this series of reactions, EF-Tu promotes codon-directed binding of aminoacyl-tRNA into the ribosomal A site from an EF-Tu·GTP·aminoacyl-tRNA ternary complex with concomitant hydrolysis of GTP. GDP is subsequently displaced from the resulting EF-Tu·GDP complex by the guanine nucleotide exchange factor EF-Ts. The EF-Tu complex and elongation factor G, EF-G, appear to interact sequentially with a ribosome to induce its oscillation between two conformations as part of the reaction cycle by which mRNA and tRNA are moved through the ribosome during protein synthesis (1Mesters J.R. Potapov A.P. de Graaf J.M. Kraal B. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 242: 644-654Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). The early understanding of these reactions of EF-Tu allows it to serve as the archetypal guanine nucleotide-binding protein (G protein). EF-Tu is one of the most abundant proteins in rapidly growing Escherichia coli cells, with approximately 5–6 copies per ribosome (2Neidhardt F. Escherichia coli and Salmonella. ASM Press, Washington, D. C.1996: 1562Google Scholar). This abundance has promoted searches for other roles for EF-Tu. Recent reports indicate that EF-1α, the eukaryotic counterpart of EF-Tu, or EF-Tu itself may participate in the degradation of N-terminally blocked proteins by the 26 S protease complex (3Gonen H. Smith C.E. Siegel N.R. Kahana C. Merrick W.C. Chakraburtty K. Schwartz A.L. Ciechanover A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. 1994; 91: 7648-7652Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar, 4Gonen H. Dickman D. Schwartz A.L. Ciechanover A. Adv. Exp. Med. Biol. 1996; 389: 209-219Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). These results are particularly intriguing in that they suggest that EF-Tu or EF-1α may interact with a partially unfolded protein and that the peptide elongation factor may serve as a chaperone which binds to ubiquitin-conjugated proteins. The relative molecular weight of E. coli EF-Tu is 43.2 (5An G. Bendiak D.S. Mamelak L.A. Friesen J.D. Nucleic Acids Res. 1981; 9: 4163-4172Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). The crystal structure of the trypsin-modified EF-Tu complex shows a rather flat triangular molecule consisting of three domains and an unusually large hole between the domains (6Kjeldgaard M. Nyborg J. J. Mol. Biol. 1992; 223: 721-742Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar). EF-Tu forms distinct complexes with at least four different components during its participation in the reactions of peptide elongation on ribosomes. These complexes involve GDP, GTP, EF-Ts, and aminoacyl-tRNA. A striking feature of EF-Tu is the large conformational differences between the form of the protein when it is complexed with GDP or GTP.

Structure (Lond.). 1996; 4: 229-238Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar) reviewed these conformational differences and considered how the chemical energy of GTP hydrolysis might be converted into mechanical energy associated with a change in the conformation. EF-Tu·GTP has a relatively closed conformation, which opens upon hydrolysis of GTP or binding of GDP to give the EF-Tu·GDP complex. We speculate that this opening and closing of EF-Tu may be a critical component of the refolding of denatured rhodanese that we present here. EF-Tu is the specific target of the antibiotics kirromycin and pulvomycin, which both bind to the factor in a 1:1 molar ratio but at different sites (8Parmeggiani A. Swart G.W.M. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 1985; 39: 557-577Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar, 9Kraal B. Zeef L.A.H. Mesters J.R. Boon K. Vorstenbosch E.L.H. Bosch L. Anborgh P.H. Parmeggiani A. Hilgenfeld R. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1995; 73: 1167-1177Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Upon complex formation with kirromycin, the elongation factor becomes locked in the closed conformation similar to that induced by GTP and in which GTP hydrolysis can take place. Aminoacyl-tRNA can bind to EF-Tu in this conformation regardless of whether GTP or GDP is present. As a consequence, EF-Tu·GDP·kirromycin remains associated with the ribosome, inhibiting peptide bond formation and leaving the ribosomes stalled on the mRNA. In contrast, pulvomycin freezes EF-Tu in the open conformation of the EF-Tu·GDP complex even in the presence of GTP and thus inhibits GTP hydrolysis. Aminoacyl-tRNA cannot bind to this EF-Tu·pulvomycin complex. Refolding of denatured rhodanese has been used extensively to study protein folding over the last 20 years. Unassisted refolding is a relatively slow process that is critically dependent on protein concentration, temperature, and other factors (10Mendoza J.A. Rogers E. Lorimer G.H. Horowitz P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 13587-13591Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This refolding can be accelerated by agents such as micelles of lauryl maltoside (11Tandon S. Horowitz P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1988; 955: 19-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) or cardiolipin liposomes (12Zardeneta G. Horowitz P. Eur. J. Biochem. 1992; 210: 831-837Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar) and certain proteins such as serum albumin (13Jarabak R. Westley J. Dungan J.M. Horowitz P. J. Biochem. Toxicol. 1993; 8: 41-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar) and α-crystallin (14Das K.P. Petrash J.M. Surewicz W.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 10449-10452Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). However, the molecular chaperones GroEL and GroES in an ATP-dependent reaction promote a relatively high rate and extent of rhodanese refolding (reviewed in Ref. 15Horowitz P. Fink A.L. Goto Y. Structure and Function of Molecular Chaperones: The Role of Chaperonins in the Life Cycle of Proteins. Marcel Dekker, New York1997: 275-300Google Scholar). We have demonstrated that components of the protein synthesizing machinery, namely the 50 S ribosomal subunit and its 23 S RNA, promote efficient refolding of denatured rhodanese in the absence of ATP (16Kudlicki W. Coffman A. Kramer G. Hardesty B. Fold. Des. 1997; 2: 101-108Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Here we extend these studies and show that EF-Tu promotes refolding of denatured rhodanese. This refolding is strongly stimulated by GTP in the presence of EF-Ts but inhibited by the nonhydrolyzable analog of GTP, GMP·PCP, by GDP and by both kirromycin and pulvomycin. Nucleoside triphosphates and E. coli tRNA were purchased from Boehringer-Mannheim; urea, rifampicin, amino acids, and kirromycin were from Sigma. [14C]Leucine was purchased from NEN Life Science Products and [γ-32P]GTP was from Amersham Corp. The plasmid used was pSP65, containing the rhodanese coding sequence under the SP6 promoter (17Kudlicki W. Odom O.W. Kramer G. Hardesty B. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 16549-16553Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The antibiotic pulvomycin was a generous gift from Dr. Andrea Parmeggiani (Paris, France). Preparation of electrophoretically homogeneous EF-Tu from Thermus thermophilus was carried out as described previously (18Leberman R.B. Antonsson R. Giovanelli R. Guariguata R. Schumann R. Wittinghofer A. Anal. Biochem. 1980; 104: 29-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). Highly purified translational factors EF-Ts and EF-G from T. thermophilus were kindly provided by Dr. Paul Sigler and co-workers and Dr. Peter Moore and co-workers, respectively (Yale University, New Haven, CT). Rhodanese was synthesized in vitro by coupled transcription/translation in an E. coli cell-free extract as described previously (17Kudlicki W. Odom O.W. Kramer G. Hardesty B. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 16549-16553Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). After synthesis, the reaction mixture was centrifuged for 45 min at 150,000 × g to separate ribosomes from the soluble fraction. The synthesized enzyme was purified from the supernatant fraction by precipitation with (NH4)2SO4 and Affi-Gel blue chromatography (19Horowitz P.M. Anal. Biochem. 1978; 86: 751-753Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Denaturation and renaturation of in vitro synthesized and purified rhodanese was performed according to Mendoza and Horowitz (20Mendoza J.A. Horowitz P.M. J. Protein Chem. 1994; 13: 15-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). Rhodanese (5.2 μm) was denatured in 200 mm sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.4) containing 1 mm β-mercaptoethanol and 8 murea for 45 min at 25 °C. Spontaneous and EF-Tu or EF-Tu/EF-Ts-assisted refolding was initiated by diluting 2 μl of denatured enzyme in 8 m urea to a final volume of 130 μl of a solution containing 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.8), 200 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 50 mm sodium thiosulfate, 10 mm MgCl2, and 10 mmKCl. In addition, 1 mm GTP or GDP was added where indicated. The final concentration of rhodanese in the refolding reaction was 80 nm. The refolding reaction was carried out for 30 min at 25 °C unless indicated otherwise. Enzyme activity was used as a measure of successful refolding of rhodanese into its native conformation. Enzyme activity was determined as described (21Sörbo B.H. Acta. Chem. Scand. 1953; 7: 1129-1136Crossref Google Scholar). The reaction mixture (total volume 250 μl) contained 20 μmEF-Tu and 100 μm GDP in a solution containing 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 10 mm MgCl2, 50 mm NH4Cl, and 1 mmdithiothreitol. The incubation was carried out at 37 °C for 5 min. The EF-Tu·GDP complex was isolated from the reaction mixture by gel filtration on a Sephadex G-50 column (0.5 × 10 cm) equilibrated with the same solution. Fractions of 100 μl were collected and used for interaction with kirromycin as described in the legend to Fig.4. The GTPase activity of EF-Tu was measured as described by Conway and Lipmann (22Conway T. Lipman F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1964; 52: 1462-1469Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar) with modifications. For other experimental details, see legends to Tables and Figs. One of the reasons rhodanese has been used as a test protein is because of a simple and sensitive assay for its enzymatic activity (21Sörbo B.H. Acta. Chem. Scand. 1953; 7: 1129-1136Crossref Google Scholar). This activity is taken as a quantitative measure of refolding of the denatured protein into its native conformation. TableI indicates that only a small portion (13%) of denatured rhodanese refolds spontaneously when diluted 65-fold from an 8 m urea solution under the conditions used (refolding solution, 30 min incubation at 25 °C). This activity is expressed as a percentage of the activity of native rhodanese carried through the same procedure. The extent of spontaneous renaturation is sensitive to the conditions used, particularly the final concentration of rhodanese and temperature. Inclusion of EF-Tu in the refolding reaction mixture in an approximately equal molar amount to denatured rhodanese promoted renaturation of up to almost half of the activity of enzyme that had not been denatured. Renaturation was found to be dependent upon the concentration of EF-Tu up to the point at which a small molar excess of EF-Tu to rhodanese was reached, yielding about 45% refolding (data not shown). Doubling the amount of EF-Tu added above this point gave only a slight increase in the percent refolding under all of the conditions tested in the experiments represented by Table I. GTP had little or no effect on renaturation mediated by highly purified EF-Tu. Similarly, addition of ATP or ADP had little or no effect (data not shown).Table IGTP-dependent EF-Tu/EF-Ts activity in in vitro refolding of denatured rhodaneseAdditionsNo nucleotideRhodanese refolding (%)+GDP+GTP+GMP · PCPNone13141414EF-Tu47235429EF-Tu (2 ×)49225326EF-Tu + EF-Ts49519031EF-G16171616 Open table in a new tab The extent of renaturation increased to 90% when EF-Ts was added with EF-Tu and GTP (Table I). EF-Ts had no effect by itself or when added in the presence or absence of GTP or GDP. The enzymatic activity of native rhodanese that was not subjected to denaturation was constant under all the conditions represented by Table I. These results are interpreted to indicate that all of the denatured rhodanese, except possibly for a small amount that may refold spontaneously, initially binds to EF-Tu probably in a 1:1 molar ratio, and then about half of this protein refolds into the active, native conformation and is released. Nearly all of the bound rhodanese is renatured and released from EF-Tu, if EF-Ts and GTP are present under conditions in which multiple rounds of GTP hydrolysis can occur. A surprising result shown in Table I is that either the non-hydrolyzable analog of GTP, GMP·PCP, or GDP inhibit EF-Tu-mediated refolding from about 50% down to near the level of spontaneous refolding. The data appear to indicate that these compounds block the renaturation activity of EF-Tu that occurs in the absence of nucleotide, the increase in renaturation from about 13% for unassisted refolding to about 47% in the presence of EF-Tu only. EF-Tu-mediated renaturation of rhodanese in the presence of EF-Ts/GTP was analyzed kinetically. In the presence of EF-Tu alone, about 47% of the denatured rhodanese was renatured in 3–5 min. (Fig.1). When EF-Ts and GTP were added to a similar reaction mixture after 4 min, rhodanese activity reached 83% in the next 60 s and 92% in 120 s. When GTP and a 1.5-fold molar excess of EF-Tu/EF-Ts over rhodanese were present initially, 5 min were required to reach 81% refolding of the denatured rhodanese (Fig. 2). If the EF-Tu/EF-Ts concentration was reduced to 16 nm each to give a molar ratio of EF-Tu/EF-Ts to denatured rhodanese of 0.2, 30 min were required to reach about 80% renaturation (Fig. 2). These results, considered with those of Fig. 1, indicate that, in the presence of GTP and an equal molar amount of EF-Ts, each mole of EF-Tu is able to promote renaturation of several moles of denatured rhodanese on a molar basis, whereas this is not the case in the absence of EF-Ts and GTP. With limiting EF-Tu (molar ratio of 0.2 EF-Tu to denatured rhodanese in Fig. 2), there is only a small increase in renaturation (10% in Fig.2) in addition to spontaneous refolding, about 14%.Figure 2The relation between the rate and extent of rhodanese refolding and EF-Tu, EF-Ts, and GTP. Denatured rhodanese (80 nm) was incubated in refolding solution in the presence of 1 mm GTP, either with an excess of EF-Tu/EF-Ts (120 nm each) (♦) or with a limiting concentration of either EF-Tu only (16 nm) (▴), or EF-Tu/EF-Ts (16 nmeach) (▪). Samples were withdrawn and assayed for rhodanese activity at the indicated times.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Considered with the results of Fig. 1, these data indicate that under the conditions used about 14% of the denatured rhodanese will refold spontaneously and that an additional portion of the denatured enzyme, about 30%, can fold with an optimal concentration of EF-Tu alone. The results also indicate that there is a portion of the denatured rhodanese that cannot be renatured under these conditions, but can be refolded under conditions in which GTP is hydrolyzed by EF-Tu in the presence of EF-Ts. These conditions give multiple rounds of GTP hydrolysis and are assumed to cause an oscillation of EF-Tu between the closed conformation that is induced by GTP and the open conformation that is promoted by GDP (cf. Ref. 7Abel K. Jurnak F. Structure (Lond.). 1996; 4: 229-238Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). The stimulatory effect of denatured rhodanese on the GTPase activity of EF-Tu is shown in Fig. 3. The mechanism by which the activity is increased is unknown; however, we suggest that denatured rhodanese may hold at least a portion of the EF-Tu in the closed conformation in which GTP hydrolysis takes place followed by dissociation of the resulting GDP. Its effect might be similar to that caused by kirromycin, which also stimulates GTP hydrolysis by EF-Tu (see below). The effects of kirromycin and pulvomycin on refolding are shown in TableII. Both antibiotics bind to EF-Tu and inhibit peptide elongation on ribosomes by blocking the function of the elongation factor but by different mechanisms. Kirromycin blocks EF-Tu in the closed conformation that is induced by GTP, whereas pulvomycin blocks the elongation factor in the open conformation characteristics of the EF-Tu·GDP complex (in the Introduction). Both antibiotics strongly inhibit EF-Tu-mediated renaturation of rhodanese in the presence or absence of EF-Ts and either GDP or GTP, as shown by the data of Table II. Of special interest are the data indicating that both antibiotics inhibit EF-Tu-mediated renaturation from the levels of EF-Tu only (∼47%) to near the level for spontaneous refolding (∼14%) that occurs in the absence of EF-Tu. This result indicates that kirromycin inhibits not only the GTP-dependent folding activity of EF-Tu but, like GDP and GMP·PCP (Table I), the refolding activity of EF-Tu that occurs in the absence of added nucleotide (about 47–13% in Table I).Table IIEF-Tu mediated refolding of denatured rhodanese is blocked by kirromycin and pulvomycinAdditionsRhodanese refolding%+GDP+GTPNone1414EF-Tu2344EF-Tu plus kirromycin1214EF-Tu plus pulvomycin919None1414EF-Tu/EF-Ts5291EF-Tu/EF-Ts plus kirromycin1414EF-Tu/EF-Ts plus pulvomycin1023 Open table in a new tab The GTPase activity of EF-Tu is increased by kirromycin (23Bocchini V. Parlato G. De Vendittis E. Sander G. Parmeggiani A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1980; 113: 53-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar), as illustrated in Fig. 4 A, as well as by denatured rhodanese (Fig. 3). Surprisingly, in light of the inhibitory effect of kirromycin on EF-Tu-mediated refolding (Table II), the GTPase activity of EF-Tu is markedly inhibited in the presence of both denatured rhodanese and kirromycin (Fig. 4 A) even though each of these stimulate GTPase activity when added independently. Both refolding (Table II) and the GTPase activity (9Kraal B. Zeef L.A.H. Mesters J.R. Boon K. Vorstenbosch E.L.H. Bosch L. Anborgh P.H. Parmeggiani A. Hilgenfeld R. Biochem.

The results presented above demonstrate that EF-Tu has chaperone-like capacity to promote refolding of denatured rhodanese. Although the results might prompt provocative hypotheses about a possible physiological role for EF-Tu in folding of nascent proteins during their synthesis on ribosomes, the results presented provide no indication of whether or not EF-Tu carries out such a function. What the results do provide is an insight into a mechanism by which chaperone-like renaturation of rhodanese is accomplished. A most striking feature of EF-Tu is its ability to exist in two different conformations that are promoted by binding of either GDP or GTP. A relatively large change in conformation is thought to take place since GTP is hydrolyzed by the factor as a step in its reaction cycle on ribosomes during peptide elongation. It is hypothesized that, by this mechanism, energy from GTP hydrolysis causes a change in the conformation of EF-Tu, which in turn leads to a conformational change in the ribosome that promotes movement of tRNA and mRNA during peptide elongation (7Abel K. Jurnak F. Structure (Lond.). 1996; 4: 229-238Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Are there common elements in the mechanism by which EF-Tu functions as a peptide elongation factor and by which it facilitates refolding of denatured rhodanese? We suggest that there are. EF-Tu by itself, without nucleotides or other factors bound to it, is able to increase refolding of rhodanese from about 14% (spontaneous refolding) to about 50% of the activity of native enzyme carried through the same procedure. The level of refolding is increased to more than 90% by the addition of GTP and EF-Ts to the folding reaction mixture. Both components are required, suggesting that multiple rounds of GTP hydrolysis are involved in this second level of activity. Under these conditions, a molecule of EF-Tu can promote refolding of more than one molecule of rhodanese. However, GTP hydrolysis in itself is not adequate to promote EF-Tu-mediated refolding. GTP hydrolysis by EF-Tu is markedly increased by kirromycin, whereas refolding is inhibited to near the level of unassisted refolding. Bound kirromycin holds EF-Tu in the closed conformation that is induced by binding of GTP. GDP resulting from GTP hydrolysis is released from EF-Tu in this conformation so that successive rounds of GTP binding, hydrolysis, and release of GDP can take place in the absence of EF-Ts. Both GMP·PCP and kirromycin inhibit refolding. Denatured rhodanese appears to bind to EF-Tu in the presence of either of these compounds, but this binding results in inhibition rather than refolding of the protein into its native conformation. Inhibition of refolding was also observed when similar experiments were carried out with GDP or pulvomycin, both of which hold EF-Tu in the open conformation. Considered together, these results lead to the conclusion that, for successful refolding of the denatured protein, GTP hydrolysis is required under conditions in which EF-Tu can cycle between the open and closed conformation. We propose the following as the mechanism by which the mechanical energy related to this change in the conformation of EF-Tu is used to promote refolding of some improperly folded molecules of rhodanese that have taken an unproductive folding path. These molecules are trapped in a semi-stable, misfolded conformation in which relatively hydrophobic regions remain exposed on their surface. Presumably, these hydrophobic regions interact with regions of EF-Tu. In terms of a computer-generated folding landscape (25Dill K. Chan H.S. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1997; 4: 10-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (2012) Google Scholar), these misfolded molecules are trapped in a low energy depression or valley. By binding, probably through hydrophobic interactions across a region of EF-Tu in which a conformational change takes place, the misfolded protein may be repeatedly pulled and stretched or compressed locally by the relative movement within the structure of EF-Tu. By this mechanism, the protein is lifted out of the low energy folding depression so that it can fold in a different way. That is, the misfolded protein is activated to a point at which it can follow another folding pathway that may lead to the native conformation. In this conformation, most of its hydrophobic regions are buried within the protein that is then released from its association with EF-Tu. The mechanism proposed above is applicable to EF-Tu-mediated folding that is dependent on GTP hydrolysis and presumably the related change of conformation in the factor. But how could such a mechanism account for the EF-Tu-mediated refolding that does not involve GTP hydrolysis? This is the increase in refolding from 14 to about 50% that is promoted by EF-Tu in the absence of added nucleotide and EF-Ts, as shown in Table I. This refolding activity of EF-Tu is inhibited by either GMP·PCP or GDP from about 50 to 29 and 23%, respectively. It is inhibited even further to about the level of unassisted refolding by either kirromycin or pulvomycin. A common effect of each of these compounds appears to be to stiffen EF-Tu in either its open or closed conformation. E. coli EF-Tu alone appears to have considerable flexibility in solution (7Abel K. Jurnak F. Structure (Lond.). 1996; 4: 229-238Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Binding of one of the antibiotics or a guanine nucleotide tends to hold the factor in a specific conformation. We suggest that it is this decrease in flexibility that causes the reduction in rhodanese refolding. It follows that flexing of the EF-Tu, probably as a result of thermal motion, is able to activate some but not all of the misfolded rhodanese molecules in a manner that is essentially similar to that described above. We are grateful to Dr. Andrea Parmeggiani (Paris, France) for providing pulvomycin. We thank Drs. John Czworkowski and Peter Moore (Yale University, New Haven, CT) as well as Drs. Youxing Jiang and Paul Sigler (Yale University) for the generous gifts of purified EF-G and EF-Ts, respectively."

Although the Fas-FasL interaction plays a critical role in peripheral T cell homeostasis and cytotoxic T lymphocyte-mediated target cell killing, the requirements for human FasL receptor binding and oligomerization have not been defined.

Autoreactive anti-class II T cell lines have been derived from diseased BN rats. These T cell lines produce interleukin (IL)-4 and may transfer autoimmunity in CD8+ cell-depleted BN rats (3Saoudi A.

CD4+ T cells are divided into at least two subsets, Th1 and Th2, which differ by their functions and the profile of cytokines they produce (4Mosmann T.R. Coffman R.L. Adv. Immunol. 1989; 46: 111-147Crossref PubMed Scopus (1027) Google Scholar). Th1 cells produce IL-2 and interferon-γ and are responsible for cell-mediated immune reactions; Th2 cells produce IL-4, IL-5, IL-6, IL-10, and IL-13 and are implicated mainly in B cell help for IgG1 and IgE production. In addition, each cell subset antagonizes the other. It is well known that IL-4 is crucial for the differentiation of naive T cells into Th2 cells. Th2 cells, once activated, produce IL-4. However, the nature of the cell that initially produces IL-4 and allows the differentiation into Th2 cells is a matter of debate. Candidates include natural killer 1.1+ T cells (5Yoshimoto T. Paul W.E. J. Exp. Med. 1994; 179: 1285-1295Crossref PubMed Scopus (804) Google Scholar), mast cells, basophils, and eosinophils (6Paul W.E. Seder R.A. Plaut M. Adv.

It is also possible that IL-6, which is produced by antigen-presenting cells, initiates IL-4 production by naive CD4+ T cells (7Rincon M. Anguita J. Nakamura T. Fikrig E. Flavell R.A. J. Exp.

It is currently admitted that ligation of the extracellular domains of the TCR activates a cascade of protein tyrosine kinases including p56 lck, p59 fyn, and ZAP-70, which leads to phosphorylation and activation of the γ isoform of phospholipase C (10Premack B.A. Gardner P. Am. J. Physiol. 1992; 263: 1119-1140Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 11Fraser J.D. Straus D. Weiss A. Immunol.

Inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate and diacylglycerol are produced, resulting in release of stored intracellular Ca2+ and protein kinase C (PKC) activation, respectively. Both IL-2 and IL-4 promoters bind NF-AT and AP-1 nuclear factors, which integrate Ca2+- and PKC-dependent signaling pathways in T cells (13Rao A. Immunol. Today. 1994; 15: 274-281Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (490) Google Scholar, 14Rooney J.W. Hodge M.R. McCaffrey P.G. Rao A. Glimcher L.H.

In fact, Ca2+- and PKC-dependent pathways have been explored mainly in the context of TCR-dependent IL-2 production, and much less is known about IL-4 production. It has been put forward that the variation of [Ca2+] i required to induce IL-4 in Th2 cells is lower than the one required to induce IL-2 in Th1 cells (16Gajewski T.F. Schell S.R. Nau G. Fitch F.W. Immunol. Rev. 1989; 111: 79-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar, 17Gajewski T.F. Lancki D.W. Stack R. Fitch F.W. J. Exp. Med. 1994; 179: 481-491Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). It has also been proposed that IL-4 production does not involve the classical protein tyrosine kinases associated with the TCR or phospholipase C activation (18Tamura T. Yanagida T. Nariuchi H. J. Immunol. 1993; 151: 6051-6061PubMed Google Scholar, 19Tamura T. Nakano H. Nagase H. Morokata T. Igarashi O. Oshimi Y. Miyazaki S. Nariuchi H. J. Immunol. 1995; 155: 4692-4701PubMed Google Scholar). The aim of this work was to understand the mechanisms of HgCl2-induced IL-4 mRNA expression by T cells. Using two murine T cell hybridomas that express IL-4 mRNA upon stimulation with HgCl2, we show that HgCl2induces a PKC-dependent calcium influx through L-type calcium channels and that the Ca2+-dependent pathway and PKC activation are both required for HgCl2-induced IL-4 gene expression. PKC might be therefore one of the main target of HgCl2 in this cell model because chemical can activate PKC in a cell-free system. The following mouse T cell hybridomas were used in this study: H-2s-restricted SM1.27.9, specific for the Myo102–118s peptide derived from myelin (20Lamont A.G. Sette A. Fujinami R. Colon S.M. Miles C. Grey H.M. J. Immunol. 1990; 145: 1687-1693PubMed Google Scholar); I-Ed-restricted 1H11.3, specific for the peptide 108–116 derived from hen egg lysosome (21Adorini L. Sette A. Buus S.

A. 1988; 85: 5181-5185Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar); I-Ad-restricted 2G12.1, specific for the peptide 26–39 derived from β2-microglobulin (22Adorini L. Moreno J. Momburg F. Hämmerling G.J. Guéry J.-C. Valli A. Fuchs S. J. Exp.

Guéry J.-C. Valli A. Fuchs S. J. Exp. Med. 1991; 174: 945-948Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar); and I-Ak-restricted 3B11.1, specific for peptide 34–45 of hen egg lysosome (23Adorini L. Guéry J.C. Fuchs S. Ortiz-Navarrete V. Hämmerling G.J. Momburg F. J. Immunol. 1993; 151: 3576-3586PubMed Google Scholar). Hybridomas were grown in RPMI containing 10% FCS (Life Technologies, Inc., Cergy Pontoise, France) nonessential amino acids (0.1 mm), sodium pyruvate (1 mm), penicillin (100 units/ml)/streptomycin (100 μg/ml), and l-glutamine (2 mm; Biochrom, KG Germany). Four protocols were used. In the first protocol, T cell hybridomas were cultured in RPMI plus 10% FCS in the absence or in the presence of HgCl2 or ionomycin. HgCl2 (10−2m; Sigma) was prepared as a stock solution in 0.9% NaCl, and ionomycin (1 μm; Sigma) was initially dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide at a concentration of 2 mm. Further dilutions were done in FCS-free medium. In the second protocol, T cell hybridomas were preincubated for 30 min with the various inhibitors listed below, and HgCl2 was added for another 4 h before RNA extraction. These inhibitors have been used: cycloheximide (Sigma), as an inhibitor of protein synthesis; actinomycin D (Sigma), as an inhibitor of transcription; cyclosporin A (Sandimmun, Sandoz, Rueil Malmaison, France), as an inhibitor of calcineurin; U-73122 (1-[6-(-[(17β)-3-methoxyestra-1,3,5(10)-trien-17yl]amino)hexyl]-1H-pyrrole-2,5-dione), as an inhibitor of phospholipase C (Calbiochem); Ro 31–8220 (3-[1-[3-(amidinothio)propyl-1H-indol-3-yl]-3-(1-methyl-1H-indol-3-yl)] maleimide methanesulfonate) (Calbiochem), as an inhibitor of PKC which competes with ATP (24Davis P.D. Elliott L.H. Harris W. Hill C.H. Hurst S.A. Keech E. Kumar M.K. Lawton G. Nixon J.S. Wilkinson S.E. J. Med. Chem. 1992; 35: 994-1001Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar, 25Keller H.U. Niggli V. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1993; 194: 1111-1116Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar); herbimycin A (Calbiochem), as an inhibitor of protein tyrosine kinases; and R(+)-Bay K8644, as a blocker of L-type calcium channels. Cycloheximide was prepared as a stock solution in ethyl alcohol (1 g/ml), cyclosporin A in cremophor (50 mg/ml); and the other reagents, actinomycin D (1 mg/ml), Ro 31-8220 (2 mm), herbimycin A (100 μg/ml), U-73122 (10−2m), and R(+)-Bay K8644 (5 mm), were dissolved initially in dimethyl sulfoxide. Further dilutions were done in FCS-free culture medium. In the third protocol, T cell hybridomas were preincubated with the intracellular calcium chelator BAPTA/AM (30 μm; Calbiochem) or with vehicle for 1 h. Cells were washed twice and were then treated with HgCl2 or medium for 4 h before mRNA extraction. BAPTA/AM (10−2m) was dissolved initially in dimethyl sulfoxide, and further dilutions were done in FCS-free culture medium. In the fourth protocol, spleen cells from normal 8-week-old male BN rats (Center d'Elevage Janvier, Le Genest-Saint-Isle, France) were prepared and incubated or not with HgCl2 (20 μm) for 4 h before RNA extraction. The effects of cyclosporin A and Ro 31-8220 were tested as described in the second protocol. A putative cytotoxic effect of HgCl2 and of the different inhibitors was tested by trypan blue exclusion; none of them was cytotoxic at the concentrations used; the viability was > 85% and did not differ from that in controls. RNA extraction was done after 4 h of culture by using the TRIzol procedure (Life Technologies, Inc.). Semiquantitative reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was performed as described already (26Saoudi A. Simmonds S. Huitinga I. Mason D. J. Exp. Med. 1995; 182: 335-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). Briefly, RNA was reverse transcribed to cDNA using poly(dT) as primer and Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase (Life Technologies, Inc.) in a final volume of 40 μl (26Saoudi A. Simmonds S. Huitinga I. Mason D. J. Exp. Med. 1995; 182: 335-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). The following primers were used: β-actin sense, 5′-TGG AAT CCT GTG GCA TCC ATG AAA C-3′; β-actin antisense, 5′-TAA AAC GCA GCT CAG TAA CAG TCC G-3′; mouse IL-4 sense, 5′-AAC ACC ACA GAG AGT GAG CTC GTC T-3′; mouse IL-4 antisense, 5′-TGG ACT CAT TCA TGG TGC AGC TTA T-3′; rat IL-4 sense, 5′-TGA TGG GTC TCA GCC CCC ACC TTG C-3′; rat IL-4 antisense, 5′-CTT TCA GTG TTG TGA GCG TGG ACT C-3′. Primers were designed to amplify cDNA fragments representing mature 348-base pair mRNA transcripts for β-actin, 178 base pairs for mouse IL-4, and 378 base pairs for rat IL-4. cDNAs were amplified in a 50-μl reaction volume containing a 0.6 mm concentration of each dNTP (dATP, dTTP, dGTP, and dCTP) (Pharmacia, Uppsala, Sweden), 1 μg/ml of each oligonucleotide primer, 2.5 mmMgCl2, 1 unit of Taq-DNA polymerase (Boehringer Mannheim, Meylan, France), and 5 μl of PCR buffer (10 ×) (Boehringer). Reactions were performed in a DNA thermal cycler (Perkin-Elmer) for 20 cycles (β-actin), 30 cycles (mouse IL-4), or 35 cycles (rat IL-4): 45 s at 94 °C, 45 s at 60 °C, and 2 min 30 s at 72 °C preceded by an initial denaturation step (1 min at 93 °C). Each PCR was performed at least twice. In some experiments, serial dilutions of cDNA were amplified. Aliquots of the PCR products were analyzed by electrophoresis on a 2% agarose gel in Tris borate EDTA buffer plus ethidium bromide. Photographs of gels were numbered, and densitometric analysis of the bands was performed by using the Gel Analyst program (ICONIX, Greystone). Results are expressed in arbitrary units and represent the ratio of the intensity of the band for IL-4 to the intensity of the band for β-actin × 10, except when mentioned otherwise. IL-4 production was quantified by using two-site sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay with paired monoclonal antibody purchased from Pharmingen (27Guéry J.C. Galbiati F. Smiroldo S. Adorini L. J. Exp. Med. 1996; 183: 485-497Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). Briefly, 11B11 anti-IL-4 monoclonal antibody was used for capture. After three washes with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) containing 0.1% Tween 20 (PBS-Tween), undiluted culture supernatants (100 μl/well) were incubated overnight at 4 °C. Plates were then washed three times and incubated with biotinylated BVD6-24G2 anti-IL-4 monoclonal antibody in PBS-Tween containing 1% bovine serum albumin (PBS-Tween-bovine serum albumin). After washing, the bound biotinylated monoclonal antibody was revealed by an additional 30-min incubation with alkaline phosphatase-conjugated streptavidin (Jackson, Immunoresearch Laboratories, Avondale, PA) diluted 1/5,000 in PBS-Tween-bovine serum albumin. After washing, the plates were incubated with the substrate p-nitrophenyl phosphate disodium (Sigma) in diethanolamine buffer, pH 9.6. The reaction was stopped by adding 3 n NaOH, and the absorbance was read at 405 nm. Cytokines were quantified from a standard curve generated by using various concentrations of recombinant mouse IL-4 diluted in PBS containing 1% FCS and 0.1% phenol. The detection limit was 15 pg/ml. 1H11.3 cells were incubated with HgCl2 (20 μm) for 1 h 30 min or 3 h. Cells were harvested, and nuclei were prepared as described by Rolfe and Sewell (28Rolfe F.G. Sewell W.A. J. Immunol. Methods. 1997; 202: 143-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Nuclei were split into two aliquots of 100 μl and incubated for 30 min at 30 °C in 20% glycerol, 30 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 2.5 mm MgCl2150 mm KCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 40 units of RNasin. A 0.5 mm concentration of each rNTP (rATP, rCTP, rGTP, and rUTP) was added to one aliquot. No rNTPs were added to the second aliquot. After 30 min, nuclei were lysed. RNA extraction, reverse transcription, and PCR were performed as described above. Results were expressed by using the IL-4:β-actin ratio as described above. Purified rat brain PKC (enriched in α, β, and γ isoforms; 5 ng/well; Calbiochem) was incubated or not with HgCl2 (5, 10, 25, or 100 μm) in the presence of EGTA (20 mm). We also tested the effect of Ca2+ (10 or 100 μm) in the presence or in the absence of EGTA. The capacity of PKC to phosphorylate a specific substrate was assessed by using a specific PKC kit assay (Calbiochem). This assay was performed in the presence of phosphatidylserine and ATP but in the absence of diacylglycerol. Measurement of [Ca2+] i was performed by emission microspectrofluorometry as described previously (29Moreau M. Leclerc C. Gualandris-Parisot L. Duprat A.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 12639-12643Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Cells were incubated with 5 μm fluo3/AM (Molecular Probes) for 30 min at 37 °C. [Ca2+] i was measured in T cells stimulated by HgCl2 (15 or 20 μm), ionomycin (1 μm), phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA; 10 ng/ml; Sigma), and S(−)-Bay K8644 as an agonist of the L-type calcium channel (6 μm). Ionomycin, PMA, and S(−)-Bay K8644 were dissolved initially in dimethyl sulfoxide at concentrations of 2 mm, 0.2 mg/ml, and 5 mm, respectively. We also checked the effect of Ro 31-8220. In some experiments, cells were stimulated by HgCl2 in Hanks' balanced saline solution without calcium and magnesium and without phenol red (Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with EGTA (20 μm). Cell preparation was then placed on the stage of an inverted microscope (Diaphot, Nikon) and observed with an objective (× 40). Excitation light was 490 nm with a 525 nm barrier filter. Fluorescence was detected by a CCD camera intensified (Hamamatsu C2400-80). With the magnification used (× 40) a field of 200 × 200 μm was recorded by the camera. Three to five fields were observed for each type of experiment, and in each field 12 windows (9 μm) were distributed on different hybridoma cells and analyzed for fluorescence. Images were captured at intervals of 10 s and processed with the Argus 50 processing image system (Hamamatsu Photonics, Hamamatsu, Japan). Time courses of Ca2+ signals in cells were analyzed with the Argus 50 software. Data are presented as the ratio of fluorescence (F) in stimulated cells to fluorescence (F 0) at the resting level. Cells were scored as positive if the fluorescence intensity variation was 5% above the resting level. Two T cell hybridomas (SM1.27.9 and 1H11.3) out of the five tested were selected because they expressed IL-4 mRNA upon stimulation with nontoxic amounts of HgCl2. The experiments herein reported have been performed on both hybridomas. Results were similar whatever the hybridoma tested. HgCl2 induced IL-4 mRNA expression in a dose-dependent manner in both hybridomas (Fig.1 A and not shown). The effect was optimal when 1H11.3 T cells and SM1.27.9 T cells were incubated with 20 and 15 μm HgCl2, respectively. In these conditions and in six independent experiments the IL-4:β-actin ratio was 9.2 ± 4.5 in SM1.27.9 T cells stimulated with HgCl2 versus 1.2 ± 2 in unstimulated cells and was 14.2 ± 8.7 in 1H.11.3 T cells stimulated with HgCl2 versus 1.8 ± 1.5 in unstimulated cells. A semiquantitative assay in which serial dilutions of cDNA were performed confirms that HgCl2 induces IL-4 mRNA expression as ionomycin does (Fig. 1 B and not shown). As soon as 2 h after stimulation with HgCl2, IL-4 mRNA was observed, with a peak at 4 h and a decline at 6 h (not shown). Actinomycin D, an inhibitor of transcription, abolished HgCl2-induced IL-4 gene expression in SM1.27.9 (Fig.1 C) and 1H11.3 (not shown) T cell hybridomas, whereas cycloheximide, an inhibitor of protein synthesis, had no effect (Fig.1 D and not shown). To demonstrate that HgCl2 actually induced IL-4 gene transcription, a PCR-based run-on assay was performed because it has indeed been shown previously that a classical run-on assay may be not sensitive enough to detect cytokine gene transcription (28Rolfe F.G. Sewell W.A. J. Immunol. Methods. 1997; 202: 143-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 2, no expression of IL-4 mRNA was observed after a 1-h 30-min stimulation with HgCl2 in the absence of rNTPs, whereas the addition of rNTPs to the isolated nuclei allowed detection of IL-4 messenger. In contrast, 3 h after stimulation with HgCl2, IL-4 mRNA was detected in nuclei whether rNTPs were added or not. Altogether, these results show that HgCl2 induces IL-4 gene and that this effect does not require de novo protein synthesis. IL-4 was not detected by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay when 5 × 105 cells/ml were cultured in the presence of HgCl2 because the IL-4 assay is not sensitive enough. Indeed, when the cell density was increased (5 × 106/ml), although mortality was high (around 40% in both stimulated and unstimulated cultures), IL-4 was detected (144 ± 41 pg/ml, n = 4 in HgCl2-stimulated cells versus <15 pg/ml in control cultures). This shows that HgCl2 induces not only IL-4 mRNA expression but also IL-4 production. It is well known that the Ca2+-dependent pathway is important for IL-4 gene induction. Therefore, we first checked whether HgCl2was able to increase [Ca2+] i in 1H11.3 T cell hybridoma. As shown by microspectrofluorometry, in 58 out of 60 cells HgCl2 induced a transient increase in fluorescence which returned to resting level within 15 min (Fig.3 A), showing that this increase was not the result of a toxic effect of HgCl2. This increase was no longer observed when a Ca2+-free medium supplemented with EGTA (20 μm) was used (Fig.3 B), demonstrating that the fluorescence increase was dependent on Ca2+ entry from the extracellular medium (Figs. 3 B and 4). Interestingly, the Ro 31-8220 PKC inhibitor (24Davis P.D. Elliott L.H. Harris W. Hill C.H. Hurst S.A. Keech E. Kumar M.K. Lawton G. Nixon J.S. Wilkinson S.E. J. Med. Chem. 1992; 35: 994-1001Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar, 25Keller H.U. Niggli V. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1993; 194: 1111-1116Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar) consistently and markedly suppressed this HgCl2- (Figs. 3 C and 4) but not the ionomycin-induced increase in [Ca2+] i (not shown). To demonstrate whether direct PKC activation may be responsible for a Ca2+ influx, the effect of PMA, a well known PKC activator, was tested; PMA (10 ng/ml) actually increased [Ca2+] i (Fig. 4) in 44 out of 48 cells. L-type calcium channels contain PKC consensus sites (30Varadi G. Mori Y. Mikala G. Schwartz A. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 1995; 16: 43-49Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). To see whether 1H11.3 T cells express L-type calcium channels, we have tested the effect of an agonist of these channels. The S(−)-Bay K8344 agonist induced an increase in [Ca2+] i in 49 out of 69 1H11.3 T cells (Fig. 4).Figure 4Intracellular Ca2+ concentration variation in 1H11.3 T cells stimulated with HgCl2, PMA, or an agonist of L-type calcium channels. 1H11.3 T cells were stimulated with HgCl2, PMA (an activator of PKC; 10 ng/ml), S(−)-Bay K8344 (an activator of L-type Ca2+ channels; 6 μm). We have also checked the effect of Ca2+-free medium and of the inhibitor of PKC (Ro 31-8220) on HgCl2-induced [Ca2+] i variation (HgCl2 Ca0 and HgCl2+Ro, respectively). Results are expressed as mean ± 1 S.D. of experiments performed on 36–60 cells.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Because HgCl2 induced a PKC-dependent Ca2+ influx, we tested the effects of an inhibitor of PKC and of an intracellular Ca2+ chelator on HgCl2-induced IL-4 gene expression. The specific PKC inhibitor (Ro 31-8220) suppressed, in a dose-dependent manner, HgCl2-induced IL-4 gene expression (Fig. 5 A). BAPTA/AM, a chelator of intracellular Ca2+, abolished the effect of HgCl2 on IL-4 gene expression (Fig.5 B). Cyclosporin A, which inhibits calcineurin phosphatase (31Fruman D.A. Klee C.B. Bierer B.E. Burakoff S.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 3686-3690Crossref PubMed Scopus (757) Google Scholar), also inhibited HgCl2-induced IL-4 gene transcription (Fig. 5 C), supporting a role for the calcium/calmodulin/calcineurin-dependent pathway. Because there is some evidence that 1H11.3 T cells express L-type calcium channels we tested the effect of an L-type calcium channel blocker. R(+)-Bay K8344 abolished HgCl2-induced IL-4 gene induction (Fig. 5 D), suggesting that HgCl2 induces a Ca2+ influx through L-type calcium channels which leads to IL-4 gene transcription. It has been shown recently that an increase in extracellular Ca2+ concentration amplified calcium-dependent pathways including NF-AT nuclear translocation (32Timmerman L.A. Clipstone N.A. Ho S.N. Northrop J.P. Crabtree G.R. Nature. 1996; 383: 837-840Crossref PubMed Scopus (472) Google Scholar). In our system, increasing medium Ca2+ concentration from 1 to 10 mm resulted in a marked increase in IL-4 gene expression (Fig. 6 A) and IL-4 production (Fig. 6 B). These results reinforce the role of a calcium influx in HgCl2-mediated IL-4 induction. To assess whether PKC activation implies phospholipase C-mediated pathway, we used U-73122 as an inhibitor of phospholipase C. By itself this agent increased IL-4 gene expression in a 1H11.3 T cell hybridoma (Fig.7 A). Moreover, not only it did not decrease but it enhanced the effect of HgCl2 on IL-4 gene expression (Fig. 7 A). Similar results were observed with herbimycin A, a protein tyrosine kinase inhibitor (Fig.7 B). Because PKC activation plays a major role in HgCl2-induced IL-4 gene expression and because upstream activation pathways for PKC activation did not seem to be involved, the question was addressed as to whether HgCl2 could activate PKC directly. As shown in Fig. 8, HgCl2 activated rat brain PKC in a dose-dependent manner even in the virtual absence of Ca2+, as the experiments were done in the presence of 20 mm EGTA, a concentration that abolished Ca2+-dependent PKC activation. To demonstrate that the Ca2+- and PKC-dependent pathways were also implicated in the effect of HgCl2 on IL-4 expression in BN T cells, we tested the effects of cyclosporin A and of the inhibitor of PKC (Ro 31-8220). As shown in Fig. 9, HgCl2induced IL-4 mRNA expression in BN spleen cells, and this effect was abolished both by cyclosporin A and by the PKC inhibitor. Previous results indicated that the ability of HgCl2to induce IL-4 gene expression and IL-4 production by rat T cells directly (8Prigent P. Saoudi A. Pannetier C. Graber P. Bonnefoy Y. Druet P. Hirsch F. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 96: 1484-1489Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar) was of major importance in an understanding of why BN rats develop Th2-mediated autoimmunity after HgCl2 exposure. The mechanisms of HgCl2-induced IL-4 gene expression were explored by using two mouse T cell hybridomas that responded to HgCl2. Using these T cell hybridomas, we showed that 1) HgCl2 induced IL-4 gene transcription without de novo protein synthesis; 2) HgCl2 induced a PKC-dependent Ca2+ influx through L-type calcium channels; 3) PKC activation and Ca2+-dependent pathways were both required for HgCl2-induced IL-4 gene expression; and that 4) HgCl2 was able to activate PKC directly in a cell-free system. Others have shown that HgCl2 induces expression of the mercuric ion reductase gene (33O'Halloran T.V. Science. 1993; 261: 715-725Crossref PubMed Scopus (558) Google Scholar) and metallothionein gene (34Radtcke F. Heuchel R. Georgiev O. Hergersberg M. Gariglio M. Dembic Z. Schaffner W. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 1355-1362Crossref PubMed Scopus (339) Google Scholar) by interacting directly with DNA or transcription factors, respectively. The fact that a chelator of intracellular calcium and inhibitors of PKC both abolished IL-4 gene expression ruled out a role for an interaction of HgCl2 with DNA or transcription factors. This indicates that HgCl2, which has the ability to enter the cell (35Nordlind K. Int. Allergy Appl. Immunol. 1984; 77: 405-408Crossref Scopus (16) Google Scholar), has different intracellular targets. PKC and Ca2+-dependent pathways were implicated in HgCl2-induced IL-4 gene transcription since an inhibitor of PKC (Ro 31-8220), the chelator of intracellular calcium BAPTA/AM and cyclosporin A abolished the induction of IL-4 gene by HgCl2. H-7, another inhibitor of PKC which is different chemically from Ro 31-8220, also abolished HgCl2-induced IL-4 gene expression (not shown), confirming that PKC was implicated. An elevation in the extracellular calcium concentration, which increases calcium-dependent NF-AT translocation in the nucleus (32Timmerman L.A. Clipstone N.A. Ho S.N. Northrop J.P. Crabtree G.R. Nature. 1996; 383: 837-840Crossref PubMed Scopus (472) Google Scholar), enhanced the effect of HgCl2 on IL-4 mRNA expression and increased the production of IL-4, thus confirming the importance of the Ca2+-dependent pathway. Our results are in agreement with numerous reports that demonstrate the involvement of both PKC and calcium-dependent pathways in IL-4 production upon stimulation through TCR or after ionomycin plus PMA treatment (15Rooney J.W. Hoey T. Glimcher L.H. Immunity. 1995; 2: 473-483Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar, 36Todd M.D. Grusby M.J. Lederer J.A. Lacy E. Lichtman A.H. Glimcher L.H. J. Exp. Med. 1993; 177: 1663-1674Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). However, whether Ca2+ influx is inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate-dependent or not is a matter of debate. On the one hand, it is generally accepted that T cell activation through TCR induces inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate-dependent mobilization of calcium stores and secondarily an influx of Ca2+ from the external medium (for review, see Ref. 37Lewis R.S.

On the other hand, depletion of extracellular Ca2+ inhibited both the initial and the sustained Ca2+ elevation induced by TCR-mediated stimulation in some T cells, which rules out a role for an initial Ca2+ mobilization from the stores (38Donnadieu E. Cefai D. Tan Y.P. Paresys G. Bismuth G. Trautmann A. J. Immunol. 1992; 148: 2643-2653PubMed Google Scholar). Gajewski et al. (17Gajewski T.F. Lancki D.W. Stack R. Fitch F.W. J. Exp. Med. 1994; 179: 481-491Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar) also reported that signaling in IL-4-producing Th2 clones was associated with weak variations in [Ca2+] i in the absence of inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate production. The fact that HgCl2 induced a calcium influx in the absence of an initial mobilization of Ca2+ stores could be related to the fact that the T cell hybridomas used in this study resemble Th2 cells. Indeed, they produced IL-4 but no interferon-γ upon stimulation via TCR (not shown). Alternatively, HgCl2 is able to induce Ca2+ entry in brain and renal cells without mobilization of Ca2+ stores (39Miura K. Naganuma A. Himeno S. Imura N. Goyer R.A. Cherian M.G. Toxicology of Metals: Biochemical aspects. 115. Springer-Verlag, Berlin1995: 163-187Google Scholar), and it might have the same effect on T cells. We then investigated the relationship that could exist between PKC and the Ca2+-dependent pathway. Ro 31-8220, a PKC inhibitor, suppressed HgCl2-induced Ca2+ entry, but it had no effect on an ionomycin-induced [Ca2+] i increase (not shown). In addition, PMA, an activator of PKC, also triggered an entry of calcium in 1H11.3 T cell hybridoma. Dihydropyridine-sensitive L-type Ca2+ channels, known to be a target for PKC (30Varadi G. Mori Y. Mikala G. Schwartz A. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 1995; 16: 43-49Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar), have already been described in T cells (40Young W. Chen J. Jung F. Gardner P. Mol. Pharmacol. 1988; 34: 239-244PubMed Google Scholar, 41Kunert-Radek J. Stepien H. Lyson K. Pawlikowski M. Agents Actions. 1990; 29: 254-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). (S−)-Bay K8344, an agonist of L-type Ca2+ channels, induced an entry of Ca2+, indicating that these channels were expressed by 1H11.3 T cell hybridoma. These channels are likely to be implicated in HgCl2-induced IL-4 gene expression because an L-type Ca2+ channel blocker, R(+)-Bay K8344, abolished the induction of IL-4 gene by HgCl2. Thus, our experiments are in agreement with a pathway in which PKC activation is responsible for an influx of calcium through L-type Ca2+ channels. An ability of PKC to activate L-type or other Ca2+ channels has not been described in T cells to the best of our knowledge, but it is widely accepted in other cell types (29Moreau M. Leclerc C.

Nature. 1997; 385: 442-446Crossref PubMed Scopus (406) Google Scholar). To answer the question of how HgCl2 may activate PKC, we used in a cell-free system rat brain PKC that contains predominantly Ca2+-dependent α, β, and γ isoforms (44Sekiguchi K. Tsukuda M. Ase K. Kikkawa U. Nishizuka Y. J. Biochem. 1988; 103: 759-765Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). In this system we show that Hg was as efficient as Ca2+ in activating rat brain PKC. That relatively high concentrations of Hg2+ and Ca2+ were required for PKC activation is probably because the test was performed in the absence of diacylglycerol, which dramatically increases the affinity of the enzyme for Ca2+ (45Nishizuka Y. Science. 1986; 233: 306-312Crossref Scopus (4038) Google Scholar). Interestingly, lead also activates rat brain PKC (46Markovac J. Goldstein G.W. Nature. 1988; 334: 71-73Crossref PubMed Scopus (365) Google Scholar) and favors IL-4 production in vivo and in vitro (47Heo Y. Parsons P.J. Lawrence D.A. Toxicol. Appl. Pharmacol. 1996; 138: 149-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). Which PKC isoform(s) is(are) activated by HgCl2 as well as the site of interaction of HgCl2 with PKC are under investigation. Other authors have reported that HgCl2 (50–500 μm) activates p56 lck among other src protein tyrosine kinases in mouse T cells and fibroblasts (48Nakashima I. Pu M.-y. Nishizaki A. Rosila I. Ma L. Katano Y. Ohkusu K. Rahman S.M.J. Isobe K.-i. Hamaguchi M. Saga K. J. Immunol. 1994; 152: 1064-1070PubMed Google Scholar, 49Pu M.Y. Akhand A.A. Kato M. Koike T. Hamaguchi M. Suzuki H. Nakashima I. J. Cell. Biochem. 1996; 63: 104-114Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, the concentrations of HgCl2 used in this study were in a toxic range, the cell types used were different, and activation of p56 lck was not correlated with any biological effect. Another effect of protein tyrosine kinase and phospholipase C inhibitors was that they enhanced IL-4 mRNA expression by themselves. It has been reported previously that inhibition of phospholipase Cγ or inhibition of protein tyrosine kinases does not induce IL-4 production (18Tamura T. Yanagida T. Nariuchi H. J. Immunol. 1993; 151: 6051-6061PubMed Google Scholar, 19Tamura T. Nakano H. Nagase H. Morokata T. Igarashi O. Oshimi Y. Miyazaki S. Nariuchi H. J. Immunol. 1995; 155: 4692-4701PubMed Google Scholar), but the effect on IL-4 mRNA has not been studied. In addition, inhibition of protein tyrosine kinase and phospholipase Cγ enhanced the effect of HgCl2 on IL-4 gene expression, suggesting that this pathway may have an inhibitory effect on IL-4 gene transcription. Ca2+- and PKC-dependent pathways were also implicated in HgCl2-induced IL-4 gene expression in BN rat T cells (Fig.9). Whether direct PKC activation is also responsible for Ca2+ influx in these cells remains to be determined. If confirmed, the effect of HgCl2 on PKC activation might explain not only IL-4 production but also the T cell polyclonal activation described recently in BN rats treated with HgCl2(50Fillon J. Baccala R. Kuhn J. Druet P. Bellon B. Int. Immunol. 1997; 9: 263-271Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). To conclude, we propose that HgCl2 activates PKC, which is responsible for an influx of Ca2+ through L-type channels; Ca2+- and PKC-dependent pathways amplify each other, leading to IL-4 gene induction in cells that are engaged in IL-4 production. These findings may be of major importance in understanding how T cells differentiate into a Th2 subtype in the mercury model. They may also be relevant in other situations such as Leishmania major infection in BALB/c mice in which CD4+ T cells are thought to be the initial source of IL-4 (51Launois P. Ohteki T. Swihart K. MacDonald H.R. Louis J.A. Eur. J. Immunol. 1995; 25: 3298-3307Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). We appreciate greatly Drs. L. Adorini and J. C. Guéry for providing T cell hybridomas. We also thank Drs. G. Bismuth, B. Rubin, M. Record, and H. Chap for helpful discussions."
https://openalex.org/W2079344736,"Earlier experiments with animal and human arteries have shown that farnesol, a natural 15-carbon (C15) isoprenoid, is an inhibitor of vasoconstriction (Roullet, J.-B., Xue, H., Chapman, J., McDougal, P., Roullet, C. M., and McCarron, D. A. (1996) J. Clin. Invest.97, 2384–2390). We report here that farnesol reduced KCl- and norepinephrine-dependent cytosolic Ca2+ transients in fura-2-loaded intact arteries. An effect on Ca2+ signaling was also observed in cultured aortic smooth muscle cells (A10 cells). In these cells, farnesol reduced KCl-induced [Ca2+] i transients and mimicked the inhibitory effect of Ca2+-free medium on the [Ca2+] i response to both 12,13-phorbol myristate acetate, a protein kinase C activator, and thapsigargin, a specific endoplasmic reticulum ATPase inhibitor. Perforated patch-clamp experiments further showed in two vascular smooth muscle cell lines (A10 and A7r5), a reversible, dose-dependent inhibitory effect of farnesol on L-type Ca2+ currents (IC50 = 2.2 μm). Shorter (C10, geraniol) and longer (C20, geranylgeraniol) isoprenols were inactive. L-type Ca2+ channel blockade also occurred under tight (gigaohm) seal configuration using cell-attached, single-channel analysis, thus suggesting a possible action of farnesol from within the intracellular space. We finally demonstrated that farnesol did not affect Ca2+-sensitive pathways implicated in smooth muscle contraction, as tested with α-toxin permeabilized arteries. Altogether, our results indicate that farnesol is an inhibitor of vascular smooth muscle Ca2+ signaling with plasma membrane Ca2+ channel blocker properties. The data have implications for the endogenous and pharmacological regulation of vascular tone by farnesol or farnesol analogues. Earlier experiments with animal and human arteries have shown that farnesol, a natural 15-carbon (C15) isoprenoid, is an inhibitor of vasoconstriction (Roullet, J.-B., Xue, H., Chapman, J., McDougal, P., Roullet, C.

The data have implications for the endogenous and pharmacological regulation of vascular tone by farnesol or farnesol analogues. Farnesol is the dephosphorylated form of farnesyl pyrophosphate, the last precursor common to all branches of the mevalonate pathway (1Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. Nature. 1990; 343: 425-430Crossref PubMed Scopus (4566) Google Scholar). The metabolic and biologic importance of farnesol has been recently demonstrated by several reports that identified the isoprenol as a natural nonsterol regulatory component of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA reductase activity (2Correll C.C. Ng L. Edwards P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 17390-17393Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 3Bradfute D.L. Simoni R.D. J. Biol.

Cancer Lett. 1994; 79: 175-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Farnesol is catabolized into farnesal, farnesoic acid, and prenyl dicarboxylic acids (7Gonzales-Pacanowska D. Arison B. Havel C.M. Watson J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 1304-1306Google Scholar, 8Bostedor R.G. Karkas J.D. Arison B.H. Bansai V.S. Vaidya S. Germershausen J.I. Kurtz M.M. Bergstrom J.D. J. Biol.

However, it can also be “re-phosphorylated” into farnesyl pyrophosphate and used for protein isoprenylation (9Crick D.C. Andres D.A. Waechter C.J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 211: 590-596Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). The observation that shorter (C10, geraniol) and longer (C20, geranylgeraniol) isoprenols, which are metabolically and structurally related to farnesol, are devoid of biological activity (2Correll C.C. Ng L. Edwards P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 17390-17393Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 3Bradfute D.L. Simoni R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 6645-6650Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) suggest the existence of farnesol-specific cellular targets or binding sites. It has been proposed that farnesol inhibits the cytosol to membrane translocation of protein kinase C (PKC, 1The abbreviations used are: PKC, protein kinase C; MVA, mevalonate availability; HBSS, Hepes-buffered salt solution; AVP, arginine vasopressin; PMA, phorbol myristate acetate; CSS, cytoplasmic salt solution; TG, thapsigargin; GTPγS, guanosine 5′-[γ-thio]triphosphate; NE, norepinephrine; N, Newton. Ref. 10Voziyan P.A. Haug J.S. Melnykovych G. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 212: 479-486Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). An effect on PKC has also been observed with farnesylamine, a closely related structural analogue of farnesol (11Kothapalli R. Lui E.M.K. Guthrie N. Chambers A.F. Carrol K.K. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1994; 47: 1909-1916Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). However, a direct effect on PKC is unlikely as farnesol does not affect PKC cellular localization in cell lines derived from normal tissue (12Yazlovitskaya E.M. Melnykovych G. Cancer Lett. 1995; 88: 179-183Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Other studies have reported the existence of a farnesol-specific, orphan nuclear receptor in vertebrate cells, the farnesoid X-activated receptor, but the role of this receptor in cell signaling pathways still needs to be defined (13Forman B.M. Goode E. Chen J. Oro A.E. Bradley D.J. Perlmann T. Noonan D.J. Burka L.T. McMorris T. Lamph W.W. Evans R.M. Weinberger C. Cell. 1995; 81: 687-693Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (978) Google Scholar,14O'Brien M.L. Rangwala S.M. Henry K.W. Weinberger C. Crick D.C. Waechter C.J. Feller D.R. Noonan D.J. Carcinogenesis. 1996; 17: 185-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). We have shown that mevalonate (MVA) availability is an important determinant of vascular tone in animal and human arteries (15Roullet J.-B. Xue H. Pappu A.S. Roullet C.M. Holcomb S. McCarron D.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 11728-11732Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 16Roullet J.-B. Xue H. Roullet C.M. Fletcher W.S. Cipolla M.J. Harker C.T. McCarron D.A. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 96: 239-244Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Decreased vascular MVA availability following treatment with lovastatin, a 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA reductase inhibitor, was associated with an increase in the response to vasoconstrictors, whereas addition of MVA to the arteries inhibited vasoconstriction. These findings, together with the recently characterized metabolic importance of farnesol, led us to hypothesize that farnesol itself has vasoactive properties. In evaluating the functional properties of various farnesyl analogues in the vascular tissue (17Roullet J.-B. Xue H. Chapman J. McDougal P. Roullet C.M. McCarron D.A. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 97: 2384-2390Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar), we indeed confirmed this hypothesis and observed that farnesol is a potent inhibitor of vasoconstriction which affects vascular tone in both animals and humans. The effect is rapid, dose-dependent, reversible, and specific of farnesol as geraniol and geranylgeraniol are inactive. The study further indicated that both GTP-binding protein-dependent contractions and those induced by KCl are inhibited by farnesol. We concluded that farnesol inhibits post-receptor and post-GTP-binding protein events and perhaps Ca2+ channels. However, the precise mechanism of action of farnesol on modulating vasoconstriction remained elusive. In the present study, we have explored further the vasoactive properties of farnesol and document that farnesol 1) inhibits Ca2+ signaling in arteries and vascular smooth muscle cells and 2) possesses Ca2+ channel blocker properties. C15 (farnesol), C10(geraniol), and C20 (geranylgeraniol) isoprenols were purchased from Aldrich (trans-trans-farnesol, catalog number 27,754-1) and Sigma (trans-geraniol, product number G 5135, and all-trans-geranylgeraniol, product G 3278). Stock solutions of the isoprenols were prepared in ethanol. Fura-2/AM was purchased from Molecular Probes (Eugene, OR). All other chemicals were from Sigma except where specified. Arteries (internal diameter of approximately 200 μm) were isolated from the mesenteric arterial bed of ∼300-g male Wistar rats (Charles River Breeding Laboratories, Inc., Boston, MA). The vessels were mounted on an isometric myograph at 37 °C in Hepes-buffered (pH 7.40) salt solution (HBSS) containing (in mm): NaCl 130, KCl 4.7, MgSO4 1.17, Hepes 15, CaCl2 1.25, glucose 5. After stretching for optimal tension recording and maximum stimulation (“wake-up” procedure consisting of three consecutive stimulations with a high (100 mm) potassium salt solution and 10−6m NE) (16Roullet J.-B.

Intravascular [Ca2+] i was then determined using fluorescence ratios (340/380 nm excitation, 510 nm emission) as described previously (16Roullet J.-B. Xue H. Roullet C.M. Fletcher W.S. Cipolla M.J.

The experiments were conducted with a dual wavelength spectrofluorometer (Spex Industries, Inc., Edison, NJ), a Nikon microscope, and a 25 × water-oil immersion Zeiss lens. Background fluorescence was determined before loading with fura-2 and subtracted from all fluorescence readings. Based upon our having shown previously that farnesol inhibits NE- and KCl-induced contraction (17Roullet J.-B. Xue H. Chapman J. McDougal P. Roullet C.M. McCarron D.A. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 97: 2384-2390Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar), determinations of [Ca2+] i were conducted in basal conditions, and then after challenge with either a high K+(100 mm KCl) depolarizing solution or NE. Active tension (mN/mm) was recorded simultaneously. A10 and A7r5 cells were purchased from the American Type Culture Collection (Rockville, MD) and used between passages 7 and 25. A10 cells were cultured in RPMI medium 1640 with 10% fetal calf serum, streptomycin (30 μg/ml), and penicillin (30 units/ml). A7r5 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum and antibiotics. Both cell lines were cultured at 37 °C under a 5% CO2 atmosphere. All cell culture reagents were obtained from Life Technologies, Inc. A10 cells were grown to confluency on glass slides in 5% CO2-buffered RPMI medium 1640 containing 10% fetal calf serum and antibiotics. Intracellular [Ca2+] i was determined in adherent cells, after a 30-min loading with 2 μm fura-2/AM in HBSS as described previously (20Bukoski R.D. J. Hypertens. 1990; 8: 37-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Intracellular [Ca2+] i was measured at base line first and then after the addition of either one of the following agonists: KCl, arginine-vasopressin (AVP), 12,13-phorbol myristate acetate (PMA), and thapsigargin. Inward barium (I Ba) currents were studied in single cells by the patch-clamp technique in the perforated- (nystatin) or cell-attached configuration (21Hamill O.P. Marty A. Neher E. Sakmann B. Sigworth F.J. Pfluegers Arch. 1981; 391: 85-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (15174) Google Scholar, 22Gollasch M. Haller H. Schultz G. Hescheler J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

In the perforated patch experiments, a List patch-clamp amplifier (model EPC 7) was used for current amplification and data acquisition; command potentials were controlled with commercial software programs using a CED1401 interface (Cambridge Electronic Design Ltd., Cambridge, UK). Currents were recorded from holding potential −80 mV during linear voltage ramps from −100 to +100 mV at 0.67 V/s or 400 ms-step pulses to 0 mV (pulse frequency = 0.2 Hz, Ref. 24Gollasch M. Ried C. Liebold M. Haller H. Hofmann F. Luft F.C. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 271: C842-C850Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Analysis of the obtained currents was performed using CED Patch and Voltage Clamp Software Version 6.08 (Cambridge Electronic Design). Ba2+ was used as charge carrier; K+ currents were blocked by Cs+. The bath solution contained (in mm) NaCl 125, BaCl210.8, MgCl2 1, CsCl 5.4, glucose 10, and Hepes 10 (pH 7.4 at 24 °C). The patch pipette was filled with a solution containing (in mm) CsOH 75, CsCl 55, MgCl2 5, aspartic acid 75, Hepes 10 (pH 7.4 at 22 °C). Nystatin (Biochrom KG, Berlin, Germany) was dissolved in Me2SO and diluted into the pipette solution to give a final concentration ranging from 50 to 100 μg/ml. The resistance of the pipettes was 2 to 4 MΩ. Series resistance in perforated patch recordings was <20 MΩ. In cell-attached patch experiments, the pipette solution contained (in mm) BaCl2 110, Hepes 5, buffered to pH 7.4 with tetraethylammonium hydroxide. Patch pipettes were made of borosilicate glass and coated with wax to minimize capacitative transients and noise; pipette resistance was 7–10 MΩ. The recordings were made with a Biologic model RK 300 amplifier, filtered (−3 dB, 5-pole Tchebicheff filter) at 1 kHz and sampled at 5 kHz. Bath solution contained (in mm) potassium aspartate 140, MgCl2 5, EGTA 5, Hepes 10, buffered to pH 7.4 with KOH. The cells were continuously perfused during all recordings. Farnesol and other drugs were applied by changing the bath solution. Final concentrations of ethanol, the diluent, were 0.1% (v/v). Experiments were carried out at room temperature (20–24 °C). Rat mesenteric arteries were mounted on an isometric myograph at room temperature, stretched for optimal tension recording, and challenged with KCl and NE for maximum stimulation. The arteries were then exposed for ∼15 min to a Ca2+-free cytoplasmic salt solution (CSS, Refs. 25Jensen P.E. Halpern W. Bevan J.A. Brayden I. Dustan H. Nelson M. Osol G.

The bath was emptied, and the arteries were covered with 10 μl of CSS containing 2 mm EGTA and 1,000 units/ml Staphylococcus aureusα-toxin. After a 20-min incubation, the permeabilized arteries were washed 3 times with 4 mm EGTA-CSS, bathed in 2 mm EGTA-CSS, and exposed to cumulative addition of Ca2+ using a concentrated (0.1 m) CaCl2 solution. The bath was maintained at 20–22 °C during tension recording, and results were calculated as % of the maximum response obtained during wake up with KCl and NE. Free Ca2+ concentrations were calculated as described previously (25Jensen P.E. Halpern W. Bevan J.A. Brayden I. Dustan H. Nelson M. Osol G.

Differences were assessed using paired or unpaired Student's t tests as appropriate, and a p value < 0.05 was assumed to indicate a significant difference. Addition of KCl (100 mm) or NE (10−5m) to fura-2 loaded arteries induced a sharp [Ca2+] i increase with slow (∼300 s) return to base line (not shown). Exposure of arteries to farnesol (30 μm, 30-min incubation) reduced the peak [Ca2+] i transients evoked by addition of NE to approximately 35% of control values (p < 0.0001,n = 10, Fig. 1). As noted in our previous report (17Roullet J.-B. Xue H. Chapman J. McDougal P. Roullet C.M. McCarron D.A. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 97: 2384-2390Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar), NE-induced contractions were also reduced as follows: 2.40 ± 0.18 mN/mm versus 3.84 ± 0.24 mN/mm for farnesol and control, respectively (n = 10,p < 0.001). Under similar conditions, geraniol and geranylgeraniol were inactive on both [Ca2+] i and tension development (not shown). Farnesol also decreased K+-evoked peak [Ca2+] i transients, to approximately 35% of control values (Fig. 1, p < 0.001, n = 10). This was associated with a pronounced decrease in contraction, 1.20 ± 0.25 mN/mm versus3.22 ± 0.22 mN/mm for farnesol and control, respectively (p < 0.001). Finally, farnesol significantly reduced basal [Ca2+] i (Fig. 1, p < 0.001). The cells were loaded with fura-2/AM, and the Ca2+ response to KCl (25 mm) and AVP (20 nm) was studied after incubation with farnesol (25 μm, 30-min incubation) or ethanol (control). Farnesol did not affect basal [Ca2+] i (35.8 ± 2.2versus 31.7 ± 1.4 nm for farnesol and control, respectively, n = 25, p > 0.05, not significant). As illustrated in Fig.2 A, the response of control cells to KCl was characterized by a sharp rise in [Ca2+] i (from 29.2 ± 4.8 to 72.2.0 ± 6.9 nm, mean ± S.E., n = 6) followed by a sustained plateau (55.0 ± 3.4 nm at 150 s). This response was totally inhibited by farnesol at 25 μm(both KClpeak and KCl150 s = 34.7 ± 8.2 nm, n = 5, p < 0.001versus control values; Fig. 2 A). The response to AVP was characterized by a large and rapid increase in [Ca2+] i (AVPpeak = 293.6 ± 17.1 nm, n = 5) followed by a rapid decrease to a lower plateau (63.4 ± 3.3 nm at 400 s). The rise in [Ca2+] i is believed to result from both Ca2+ influx and Ca2+ release from intracellular stores, whereas the plateau corresponds to the opening of store-regulated and voltage-sensitive plasma membrane Ca2+ channels (28Ng L.L. Davies J.E. Wojcikiewicz R.J.H. Circ. Res. 1994; 74: 173-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 2 B, farnesol significantly reduced both phases of the response to AVP to 50.9 ± 6.1 (peak) and 73.7 ± 1.4% (plateau) of average control values (n = 5, p < 0.01). Fura-2-loaded A10 cells were incubated with or without farnesol (25 μm) for 30 min and challenged with either thapsigargin (TG) or with PMA. The addition of TG to control cells induced an immediate rise of free [Ca2+] (onset: 9 ± 2 s; rate: 5.1 ± 1.4 nmol × l−1 × s−1; n = 5) to a maximum (TGpeak) followed by a sustained plateau phase at ∼400 s after TG addition (TG400 s). This response is illustrated in Fig. 3 A. In the absence of extracellular Ca2+, only the plateau phase was decreased (Fig. 3 A), and no modification of the onset and the rate of the [Ca2+] i transient was observed. Farnesol decreased TG400 s but did not affect TGpeak(Fig. 3 A); average TG400 s values were 49.5 ± 3.5 and 103 ± 5.9 nm for farnesol and control, respectively (n = 5, p < 0.006), whereas TGpeak values were 83.7 ± 5.1 and 114.0 ± 5.6 nm (p = not significant). Onset (8 ± 1 s) and rate of the TG response (3 ± 1 nmol × liter−1 × s−1) were not modified by farnesol (p = not significant). In the absence of extracellular Ca2+, farnesol had no significant effect on either TGpeak (92.2 ± 4.4 versus106.0 ± 3.3 nm for farnesol and control, respectively; n = 5, p = not significant) or TG400s (45.8 ± 1.8 nm versus 55.8 ± 1.9 nm, p = not significant). As illustrated in Fig. 3 B, addition of PMA to control cells induced a sharp rise of [Ca2+] i to a maximum (PMApeak = 80.0 ± 5.7 nm from a base line of 30.6 ± 3.1 nm, n = 7) with a relatively long onset (35 ± 7 s) as compared with TG transients. The peak response was followed by a slow decline in [Ca2+] i. In the absence of extracellular Ca2+, no response to PMA was observed (Fig. 3 B). Incubation with farnesol inhibited the PMA response in a concentration-dependent manner (PMApeak = 59.0 ± 4.7 and 39.4 ± 3.8 nm for farnesol 5 and 25 μm, respectively; n = 5,p < 0.02 and p < 0.001versus control). For a farnesol concentration of 5 μm, the rate of the [Ca2+] i transients was decreased (Fig. 3 B) but not the onset (42 ± 9 s; p = not significant versus control). For a concentration of 25 μm, the response to PMA was totally abolished. This was similar in magnitude to the effect of farnesol on the Ca2+ response to KCl and to the effect of “0 mm” extracellular [Ca2+] on the PMA response. Two vascular smooth muscle cell lines (A10 and A7r5) were studied. Barium currents were reversibly inhibited by dihydropyridines (1 μm nimodipine) and augmented by Bay K 8644 (not shown). Both cell lines showed current-voltage relationships typical for high voltage-activated L-type Ca2+ channels, with apparent threshold and reversal potentials of approximately −50 and +60 mV, respectively (Fig. 4,A and B, and see Ref. 29Xiong Z. Sperelakis N. J. Mol. Cell. Cardiol. 1995; 27: 75-91Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Low voltage-activated T-type calcium channels were observed only in approximately 10% of cells in both cell lines. Farnesol (10 μm) reduced the peak current in A10 cells to 30 ± 5% (p < 0.01,n = 5) and in A7r5 to 26 ± 6% (p< 0.001, n = 10) of control values. The effect of farnesol was completely reversible after wash out (Fig. 4,A–C) and was observed over the whole voltage range (Fig. 4,A and B). Geraniol, applied to the bath solution at the same concentration (10 μm, Fig. 4 C), did not modify Ca2+ channel currents (peak current was reduced to 99 ± 5% of the control values, n = 5,p = not significant). Geranylgeraniol (10 μm, Fig. 4 C) had a modest but reversible effect (reduction to 89 ± 3%, n = 5,p < 0.02). No change in leak current was observed during application of the isoprenols suggesting that, at these concentrations, they had no “detergent-like” effect on cell plasma membrane. Half-maximal inhibition of the Ca2+ channel current was observed at 2.2 mm farnesol (Fig.4 D). The Hill coefficient was 0.82, indicating 1:1 binding of farnesol. In these experiments, the effect of farnesol on single L-type Ca2+ channel within the patch was determined. I Ba were evoked every 10 s by either 400-ms pulses to −10 mV (from holding potential of −40 mV) or steady state recordings at −10 mV. I Ba was augmented by application of 1 μm (−)-Bay K 8644 to the bath solution and eliminated by addition of 1 μmnimodipine, thus indicating the presence of functional L-type Ca2+ channels (not shown). Control conditions contained minimal (50 nm) (−)-Bay K 8644 in the bath solution to promote mode-2 gating and prolong openings. Typical control recordings with both long and short transient openings are shown in Fig. 5(left) with corresponding histogram analysis. After control currents were recorded, farnesol (25 μm) was perfused over the cells. As shown in Fig. 5 (middle), the open probability was dramatically reduced in the presence of farnesol. Maximum, steady state inhibition was reached after approximately 3 min. No change in leak current was observed during farnesol application. The effect of farnesol was reversible as evidenced by recovery of unitary currents after wash out within 3–5 min (not shown) and full response to (−)-Bay K 8644 (Fig. 5, right). As shown in Fig.6 (“basal” curves), farnesol (30 μm, 60-min incubation) did not inhibit significantly Ca2+-dependent contractions in permeabilized arteries. The Ca2+ concentrations necessary to induce half-maximum contraction (pCa50) were 732 ± 102 and 724 ± 78 nm for control and farnesol-treated vessels, respectively (p = not significant, n = 4). The response to Ca2+ was also determined in the presence of GTPγS, a non-hydrolyzable form of GTP, and in the presence of PMA, a PKC activator (30Jiang M.J. Morgan K.G. Am. J. Physiol. 1987; 253: H1365-H1371PubMed Google Scholar). As previously reported (31Andrea J.E. Walsh M.P. Hypertension. 1992; 20: 585-595Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar, 32Fujiwara T. Itoh T. Kubota Y. Kuriyama H. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1989; 408: 535-547Crossref Scopus (68) Google Scholar), both compounds shifted the Ca2+ dose-response curve to the left, indicating an increased sensitivity of the artery to Ca2+ (Fig. 6, GTPγS and PMA curves). However, the sensitizing effect of GTPγS and PMA was not modified by farnesol (same figure). This study was conducted to elucidate the molecular mechanisms by which farnesol, a natural endogenous intermediate of the mevalonate pathway, inhibits vasoconstriction. Because elevation of intracellular Ca2+ concentration in response to either membrane depolarization or vasoconstrictors is the main trigger for vascular smooth muscle contraction (33Somlyo A.P. Somlyo A.V. Nature. 1994; 372: 231-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (1733) Google Scholar), we first characterized the effect of farnesol on Ca2+ signaling. Experiments were conducted in both intact arteries and isolated vascular smooth muscle cells loaded with fura-2, a fluorescent cytosolic Ca2+ indicator (34Grynkiewicz G. Poenie M. Tsien R.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 3440-3450Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). For the experiments with vascular smooth muscle cells, the clonal A10 cell line was used (35Kimes B.W. Brandt B.L. Exp. Cell Res. 1976; 98: 349-366Crossref PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar). These cells do not contract and do not respond to NE. However, they do respond to KCl and to arginine-vasopressin by elevating [Ca2+ ] i and were therefore chosen to examine the impact of farnesol on Ca2+ signaling at the cellular level. It must be mentioned that farnesol inhibits contractions induced by AVP in intact arteries (36Roullet J.-B. Luft U.C. Xue H. Roullet C.M. McCarron D.A. Am. J. Hypertens. 1996; 9 (abstr.): 81Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), thus further justifying the use of the cell line in elucidating the mechanism of action of farnesol. The results of these experiments indicate that farnesol decreases agonist and depolarization-dependent [Ca2+] i transients in arteries and vascular smooth muscle cells. These findings suggest that inhibition of contraction is the consequence of reduced Ca2+ signaling in the presence of farnesol. Interestingly, farnesol also decreases basal arterial [Ca2+] i; this may explain our previous observation of a vasodilatory action of farnesol on resting human arteries, i.e. in the absence of agonist (17Roullet J.-B. Xue H. Chapman J. McDougal P. Roullet C.M. McCarron D.A. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 97: 2384-2390Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). The greater impact of farnesol on the KCl response compared with the AVP response observed in our cell experiments suggests that the primary action of farnesol is on plasma membrane-dependent Ca2+ influx, i.e. voltage-dependent Ca2+ channels, and not on Ca2+ release from intracellular stores. However, the reduction by farnesol of the peak response to AVP indicates a possible effect of farnesol on intracellular stores as both release from the stores and Ca2+ influx overlap during this phase of the response. The issue of the origin of the reduction in Ca2+ signaling was further explored in another series of experiments in which TG, a specific inhibitor of endoplasmic reticulum Ca2+-ATPase (37Thastrup O. Cullen P.J. Drobak B.K. Hanley M.K. Dawson A.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 2466-2470Crossref PubMed Scopus (3010) Google Scholar), and PMA, a PKC activator, were used. The data show that farnesol mimics the effect of extracellular Ca2+ removal on both TG- and PMA-induced Ca2+] i transients. As to the TG response, farnesol decrea"
https://openalex.org/W2010571388,"GRK5, a recently cloned member of the G protein-coupled receptor kinase family, has been shown to phosphorylate and participate in the desensitization of angiotensin II (Ang II) type 1A (AT1A) receptors. In this study, the effect of angiotensin II on GRK5 expression was examined in cultured vascular smooth muscle cells and aortas of Ang II-infused hypertensive rats. In vascular smooth muscle cells, Ang II (100 nm) up-regulated GRK5 mRNA as early as 1 h, with a peak at 16 h. This up-regulation was dose- and calcium-dependent. The increase in GRK5 mRNA was reflected in a smaller increase in protein expression, which nonetheless had functional significance since AT1 receptor phosphorylation was increased and phospholipase C activation was decreased following prolonged incubation with Ang II. In aortas of Ang II-infused hypertensive rats, both GRK5 mRNA and protein levels increased ∼3-fold compared with sham-operated rats at 5 and 7 days, respectively. This up-regulation was blocked either by losartan or by the nonspecific vasodilator hydralazine. Since a subpressor dose of Ang II did not increase GRK5 mRNA levels and norepinephrine infusion also increased GRK5 mRNA expression, we conclude that Ang II-induced GRK5 up-regulation in rat aortas may be due to hypertension per se. Hormone- and hemodynamic stress-induced GRK5 regulation may provide a novel molecular basis for long-term regulation of agonist sensitivity of vascular cells."

Tst-1/Oct6/SCIP, for instance, is essential for terminal differentiation of myelinating Schwann cells in the peripheral nervous system. Although Tst-1/Oct6/SCIP is also expressed in the myelin forming oligodendrocytes of the central nervous system, targeted deletion of Tst-1/Oct6/SCIP failed to reveal a gross alteration of myelination in the central nervous system. To better understand this apparent discrepancy, we examined the expression of POU proteins in both cultured primary oligodendrocytes and in the oligodendrocyte-like CG-4 cell line. These cells expressed Tst-1/Oct6/SCIP, Brn-1, and Brn-2 in significant amounts, indicating that Brn-1 and Brn-2 might have the capacity to compensate loss of Tst-1/Oct6/SCIP. We show that Tst-1/Oct6/SCIP, Brn-1, and Brn-2 were all down-regulated during the early phases of oligodendrocyte development both on RNA and protein level. All three POU proteins exhibited similar DNA binding characteristics. When promoters consisting of a single POU protein-binding site adjacent to a TATA box were used as reporters in transient transfections, Brn-1 proved to be a weaker transcriptional activator than Tst-1/Oct6/SCIP. In agreement with this, we found the transactivation domain of Brn-1, which we mapped between amino acids 119 and 237, significantly weaker than the transactivation domain of Tst-1/Oct6/SCIP. Taken together, our data imply a partial, but not complete redundancy between POU proteins in oligodendrocytes. Class III POU proteins are prominent regulators of neural development.

Glial cells of the mammalian nervous system can be grouped into various classes depending on their function and location. The two major classes of glia in the central nervous system are the myelin-forming oligodendrocytes and the non-myelinating astrocytes. Glial cells in the peripheral nervous system are similarly classified either as myelinating Schwann cells or non-myelinating Schwann cells. Progress has been made over recent years in understanding the contribution of transcription factors to Schwann cell development and differentiation (1Mirsky R. Jessen K.R. Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 1996; 6: 89-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar, 2Zorick T.S. Lemke G. Curr. Opin. Cell. Biol. 1996; 8: 870-876Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). Thus, it was convincingly shown that the paired domain protein Pax3, the POU protein Tst-1/Oct6/SCIP, and the zinc-finger protein Krox-20 are essential for different phases of Schwann cell development and myelination (3Bermingham J.R.

Preliminary data show, however, that some of the transcription factors identified as crucial regulators in the Schwann lineage such as Krox-20 are not expressed in the oligodendrocyte lineage (6Topilko P.

Others seem to be expressed both in Schwann cells and in oligodendrocytes (8Hart I.K. Richardson W.D. Raff M.C. Glia. 1992; 6: 310-313Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 9Monuki E.S. Weinmaster G. Kuhn R. Lemke G. Neuron. 1989; 3: 783-793Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar). Such a transcription factor is Tst-1/Oct6/SCIP (9Monuki E.S. Weinmaster G. Kuhn R. Lemke G. Neuron. 1989; 3: 783-793Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar, 10He X. Gerrero R. Simmons D.M. Park R.E. Lin C.R. Swanson L.W. Rosenfeld M.G. Mol. Cell.

EMBO J. 1990; 9: 3723-3731Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). Originally defined as the prominent POU protein in Schwann cells, it has later also been detected in oligodendrocytes (12Collarini E.J. Kuhn R. Marshall C.J. Monuki E.S. Lemke G. Richardson W.D. Development. 1992; 116: 193-200PubMed Google Scholar, 13Monuki E.S. Kuhn R. Weinmaster G. Trapp B. Lemke G. Science. 1990; 249: 1300-1303Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). Targeted deletion of Tst-1/Oct6/SCIP in mice revealed a myelination defect in the peripheral nervous system, thus corroborating the role of Tst-1/Oct6/SCIP in Schwann cell development (3Bermingham J.R. Scherer S.S. O'Connell S. Arroyo E. Kalla K.A. Powell F.L. Rosenfeld M.G. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 1751-1762Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar, 4Jaegle M. Mandemakers W. Broos L. Zwart R. Karis A. Visser P. Grosveld F. Meijer D. Science. 1996; 273: 507-510Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar). Unexpectedly, however, in the central nervous system myelination was apparently normal in these mice. Recent years have seen the identification of an ever growing list of POU proteins which have been grouped into six different classes (14Wegner M. Drolet D.W. Rosenfeld M.G. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1993; 5: 488-498Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar). Unlike the mammalian founding members of this family, which show a pituitary-specific (Pit-1), lymphocyte-specific (Oct-2), and ubiquitous (Oct-1) expression, respectively, most of the other members are widely expressed throughout the developing nervous system and become restricted to defined neural populations in the adult (15Schöler H.R. Hatzopoulos A.K. Balling R. Suzuki N. Gruss P. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 2543-2550Crossref PubMed Scopus (512) Google Scholar, 16He X. Treacy M.N. Simmons D.M. Ingraham H.A. Swanson L.W. Rosenfeld M.G. Nature. 1989; 340: 35-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (671) Google Scholar). Such an expression pattern is also characteristic of all class III POU proteins including Tst-1/Oct6/SCIP (17Alvarez B.G. Rosenfeld M.G. Swanson L.W. J. Comp. Neurol. 1995; 355: 237-295Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). Their overlapping expression in the developing nervous system indicates that these POU proteins might perform partially redundant functions in cells in which they are co-expressed. Here we identify Brn-1 and Brn-2 as two class III POU proteins which are co-expressed with Tst-1/Oct6/SCIP in the oligodendrocyte lineage. By analyzing their expression during oligodendrocyte differentiation and by investigating the functional characteristics of Brn-1, we try to address the question of functional redundancy between class III POU proteins during oligodendrocyte differentiation. A 324-bp 1The abbreviations used are: bp, base pair(s); RT-PCR, reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction; kb, kilobase(s); DBD, DNA-binding domain; GAPDH, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase; CMV, cytomegalovirus. fragment corresponding to the POU domain of Brn-1 was derived from RT-PCR, radiolabeled and used to screen an oligo(dT)-primed cDNA library constructed from poly(A)+ RNA of undifferentiated CG-4 cells in λ-Ziplox (Life Technologies, Inc.). Plasmids were excised from three independent positive λ phages according to the manufacturer's instructions. All were found to contain Brn-1 sequences. Plasmid pZL1/Brn-1 contained the longest insert with a size of 3.3 kb, including the complete open reading frame. Its sequence was determined over 3,050 bp and submitted to EMBL/GenBank (accession number AJ001641). The open reading frame for rat Brn-1 was retrieved as a 2.2-kb EcoRI/NsiI fragment from pZL1/Brn-1 and inserted between EcoRI and PstI sites of pCMV5, yielding pCMV/Brn1. Analogous mammalian expression plasmids for Brn-2, Brn-4, and Tst-1/Oct6/SCIP, and the POU-responsive luciferase reporters HSVoct-luc, and siteA-luc have been described (18Li P. He X. Gerrero M.R. Mok M. Aggarwal A. Rosenfeld M.G. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 2483-2496Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar, 19Mathis J.M. Simmons D.M. He X. Swanson L.W. Rosenfeld M.G.

A. 1993; 90: 4743-4747Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). pCMVGal4 contained coding sequences for the DNA-binding domain (DBD) of the yeast Gal4 protein (21Schreiber J. Sock E. Wegner M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 4739-4744Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Insertion of Brn-1 sequences led to an in-frame fusion of both open reading frames, with Brn-1 following Gal4 sequences. A fragment corresponding to the carboxyl-terminal region (amino acids 461–497) of Brn-1 was generated by PCR with flanking EcoRI and BamHI sites and inserted into pCMVGal4, yielding pCMVGal4/461–497. A fusion between Gal4-DBD and the amino-terminal region of Brn-1 (amino acids 3–315) was generated by inserting an MscI/AatII fragment into pCMVGal4, thus creating pCMVGal4/3-315. Shortened versions of the amino-terminal part of Brn-1 were generated by using naturally occurring AluI, NaeI, NarI, NcoI,NdeI, SmaI, and SstII restriction sites (see Fig. 8 A). Plasmid pCMVGal4/Tst-1N expressed a fusion between Gal4-DBD and amino acids 1–240 of Tst-1/Oct6/SCIP and will be described elsewhere. 2K. Kuhlbrodt and M. Wegner, manuscript in preparation. The Gal4-responsive luciferase reporter (3xUAS luc) contained three tandem copies of a Gal4-binding site in front of the rat prolactin minimal promoter (21Schreiber J. Sock E. Wegner M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 4739-4744Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Bacterial expression of Brn-1 holoprotein was achieved by cloning a 1.7-kb NotI fragment from pZL1-Brn1 into pET28b (Novagen). Insertion of an SphI fragment from rat Brn-2 cDNA (18Li P. He X. Gerrero M.R. Mok M. Aggarwal A. Rosenfeld M.G.

Glial cultures were prepared from the brains of 1-day-old Wistar rats as described (22McCarthy K.D. DeVellis J. J. Cell.

Neurochem. 1997; 68: 1911-1919Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Schwann cells were isolated from 3-day-old rats by the method of Brockes (23Brockes J.P. Fields P. Raff M.C. Brain Res. 1979; 165: 105-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (916) Google Scholar), as modified by Porter et al. (24Porter S. Clark M.B. Glaser L. Bunge R.P. J. Neurosci. 1986; 6: 3070-3078Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Rat CG-4 cells were grown on poly-l-ornithine-coated plates in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, containing N1 supplement (5 μg/ml transferrin, 16 μg/ml putrescine, 60 ng/ml progesterone, 50 ng/ml selenium, 5 μg/ml insulin), and 30% B104-conditioned medium (25Louis J.C. Magal E. Muir D. Manthorpe M. Varon S. J. Neurosci. Res. 1992; 31: 193-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (362) Google Scholar). Differentiation of CG-4 cells was induced by omitting the B104-conditioned medium. U138 human glioblastoma cells were propagated in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum. COS and T98-G human glioma cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum. Total RNA was isolated from cell cultures by the acid guanidinium thiocyanate-phenol method (26Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (63232) Google Scholar) using Trizol reagent (Life Technologies, Inc.). Poly(A)+ RNA was prepared from total RNA using OligotexTM resin (Quiagen). RNAs from Schwann cells (1 μg of poly(A)+), CG-4 cells (1 μg of poly(A)+), and primary oligodendrocytes (4 μg total) were reverse transcribed into cDNA for 1 h at 42 °C using 400 units of Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase, 45 pmol of oligo(dT) primer, and 0.5 mm dNTP in 30 μl of 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.3, 75 mm KCl, 3 mm MgCl2, and 1 mmdithiothreitol. For the identification of POU genes in glial cells, 2 μl of cDNA from undifferentiated CG-4 cells were amplified using the degenerate primers 5′-TTAGGATCCA(G/A)(A/T)(G/C)(G/A/T/C)(G/A)CCAT(A/T/C)T(G/ C)(T/C)(A/C)G(G/A/T/C)TT(T/C)GA-3′ and 5′-TTTAGAATTCTG(G/T/ C)C(G/T)(G/T/C)(T/C)(G/T)(G/A)TT(G/A)CA(G/A)AACCA(G/A/T/C)AC-3′. In addition to 40 pmol of each degenerate primer, polymerase chain reactions contained 0.2 mm dNTP and 1 unit of Taq-DNA polymerase in 50 μl of 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.3, 50 mm KCl, and 2 mm MgCl2. After an initial denaturation step for 1 min at 94 °C, 35 cycles were performed with each cycle consisting of a denaturation (1 min at 94 °C), an annealing (1 min at 50 °C), and an elongation step (1.5 min at 72 °C). Amplification products were subcloned between BamHI and EcoRI sites of pBluescript KS+ (Stratagene) and sequenced. For the quantitation of POU genes, 2 μl of cDNA from Schwann cells, CG-4 cells, and primary oligodendrocytes were amplified with primer pairs specific for Brn-1, Brn-2, Brn-4, Tst-1/Oct6/SCIP, and GAPDH. The following primer pairs were used: Brn-1 (5′-CAACAGCCACGACCCTCACT-3′ and 5′-CAGAACCAGACCCGCACGAC-3′, yielding a 450-bp product), Brn-2 (5′-CACCACGCTGCCAACAACCA-3′ and 5′-CTGCCCGAGGATGAGTCTGC-3′, yielding a 540-bp product), Brn-4 (5′-TCCATCACCGCTCGCC(T/G)CAC-3′ and 5′-CCTCCTTGCTTCCTCCAGTC-3′, yielding a 820-bp product), Tst-1/Oct6/SCIP (5′-CACTGCACGAGGACGGCCAC-3′ and 5′-TCGAGCGCGCCTTTGACACC-3′, yielding a 500-bp product), and GAPDH (5′-GCCATCAA(C/T)GACCCCTTCATT-3′ and 5′-CGCCTGCTTCACCACCTTCTT-3′, yielding a 700-bp product). In addition to 40 pmol of each primer in a selected pair, polymerase chain reactions contained 0.2 mmdNTP and 1 unit of Taq-DNA polymerase in 40 μl of 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.3, 10% dimethyl sulfoxide (v/v), 50 mm KCl, and 2 mm MgCl2. After denaturation (1 min at 94 °C), 24 or 27 cycles were performed with each cycle consisting of a denaturation (30 s at 94 °C), an annealing (30 s at 50 °C), and an elongation step (45 s at 72 °C). Amplification products were analyzed on 2% agarose gels. U138 were transfected by the calcium phosphate technique (27Renner K. Leger H. Wegner M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 6433-6437Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). COS and T98G cells were transfected by the DEAE dextran technique using a concentration of 500 μg/ml DEAE dextran followed by chloroquine treatment (28Sock E. Renner K. Feist D. Leger H. Wegner M. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 1512-1520Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). For luciferase assays, cells were transfected with 2 μg of luciferase reporter plasmid and 2 μg of CMV expression plasmid per 60-mm plate. The total amount of plasmid was kept constant using empty CMV vector. Cells were harvested 48 h after transfection, and extracts were assayed for luciferase activity (20Wegner M. Drolet D.W. Rosenfeld M.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 4743-4747Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Full-length Brn-1 protein was produced in Escherichia coli BL21 DE3 as a hexahistidine fusion protein using the pET expression system (Novagen). Purified denatured Brn-1 holoprotein was used to raise polyclonal antibodies in rabbit. In a similar manner, a rabbit antiserum was raised against amino acids 27–202 of Brn-2. The Tst-1-specific antiserum has been described (27Renner K. Leger H. Wegner M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 6433-6437Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Nuclear extracts were prepared 48 h post-transfection from transfected COS cells (29Renner K. Sock E. Bermingham J.R. Wegner M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 4552-4557Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). For whole cell extracts, CG-4 cells or primary glial cells were lysed in the presence of 2 μg/ml leupeptin and aprotinin each in ice-cold 10 mm Hepes pH 7.9, 0.2 mm EDTA, 2 mm dithiothreitol, and 1% Nonidet P-40. Immediately after lysis NaCl was added to a final concentration of 400 mm. After extraction for 15 min under constant rotation, cell debris was removed from the extract by centrifugation. In general, 0.5 ng of32P-labeled probe were incubated with 1 μg of nuclear or 2.5 μg of whole cell extract for 20 min on ice in a 20-μl reaction mixture containing 10 mm Hepes pH 8.0, 5% glycerol, 50 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1 mm EDTA, 4 μg of bovine serum albumin, and 1 μg of poly(dI-dC) as unspecific competitor. In some experiments, antiserum (0.5 μl) was added to the reaction, and incubation was continued for an additional 5 min before loading onto native 4% polyacrylamide gels. Electrophoresis was performed in 0.5 × TBE (45 mm Tris, 45 mmboric acid, 1 mm EDTA, pH 8.3). Gels were dried and exposed for autoradiography. The following oligonucleotides were used as probes: HSVoct (5′-GATCCGCATGCTAATGATATTCTTAGATC-3′), IgH-P (5′-GATCCGAGAATATGCAAATCAATTGGAGATC-3′), IgH-E (5′-GATCCGAGCCCGGGGTAATTTGCATTTCTACTAGAGATC-3′), O+H+ (5′-GATCCTGATTTGCATATTCATGAGAGATC-3′), O+H− (5′-GATCCTGATTTGCATATGAAGGATAGATC-3′), O−H+ (5′-GATCCTGATGTTCAGATTCATGAGAGATC-3′), CRH (5′-GATCTGCATAAATAATAGGGATC-3′), siteA (5′-TCGACCTCCTGTATATATAAAAAAAAGGGAAGGGCTCGA-3′), BR (5′-GATCTTCGTATATTTATGGGATC-3′), and FTZ (5′-GATCCAATTGTCAAGTAATCGTAAAGATC-3′). As a first step in identifying the POU proteins present in the oligodendrocyte lineage, we performed PCR with a pair of degenerate primers. Because the DNA recognition helices of the POU-specific domain and the POU homeodomain are strongly conserved between all known POU proteins (14Wegner M. Drolet D.W. Rosenfeld M.G. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1993; 5: 488-498Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar), we designed primers within these two regions. Situated between these two primers is the linker of the POU domain, which allows unambiguous identification of the respective POU protein. Using cDNA from the rat oligodendrocyte progenitor cell line CG-4 (25Louis J.C. Magal E. Muir D. Manthorpe M. Varon S. J. Neurosci. Res. 1992; 31: 193-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (362) Google Scholar) and from primary oligodendrocytes, we obtained significant amounts of PCR product specific for Tst-1/Oct6/SCIP, Brn-1, and Brn-2. Brn-4 (19Mathis J.M. Simmons D.M. He X. Swanson L.W. Rosenfeld M.G. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 2551-2561Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar,30LeMoine C. Young S.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 3285-3289Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar) was the only of the known class III POU proteins not represented among the PCR products (data not shown). Whereas Brn-2 and Tst-1/Oct6/SCIP have been extensively studied in the past both in vitro and in vivo (3Bermingham J.R. Scherer S.S. O'Connell S. Arroyo E. Kalla K.A. Powell F.L. Rosenfeld M.G.

Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 3122-3135Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar), not much is known about the function of Brn-1. To obtain a cDNA for Brn-1, we screened an oligo(dT)-primed cDNA library prepared from the rat CG-4 cell line using as probe a PCR fragment corresponding to the partial POU domain of Brn-1. The longest of the obtained clones contained a 3.3-kb insert which included the complete open reading frame for rat Brn-1 (Fig.1). As the message for Brn-1 was approximately 4.5 kb in size (data not shown), our clone is incomplete, most likely lacking additional 5′-untranslated sequences. Comparison of the identified DNA sequence for rat Brn-1 revealed a high homology with the previously described genomic sequence for mouse Brn-1 (36Hara Y. Rovescalli A.C. Kim Y. Nirenberg M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 3280-3284Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). Both sequences overlapped over 2,069 bp which included the complete open reading frame of this intronless gene. When compared over this region, both sequences were found to exhibit an identity of 95%. On the protein level, only 4 amino acid substitutions (residues 10, 17, 137, and 152) and an insertion of two additional amino acids (residues 81 and 82) were detected in the rat as compared with the mouse. A similarly high degree of identity was observed between rat and human Brn-1 protein (37Sumiyama K. Washiowatanabe K. Saitou N. Hayakawa T. Ueda S. J. Mol. Evol. 1996; 43: 170-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar) with 2 amino acid substitutions (residues 137 and 155) and an insertion of three glycines (1 glycine following residue 42, 2 glycines following residue 297) in the human protein. Using published sequences for class III POU genes (11Suzuki N. Rohdewohld H. Neumann T. Gruss P. Schöler H.R. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 3723-3731Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar, 18Li P. He X.

A. 1992; 89: 3280-3284Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar) and the newly identified rat Brn-1 sequence, we next designed specific primer pairs for each of these genes (see “Experimental Procedures”). We confirmed the specificity of each of these primer pairs in PCR with cloned POU cDNAs as templates (data not shown), and then applied the same primers to study the expression of class III POU genes during oligodendrocyte differentiation. For this purpose we made use of the CG-4 cell line which in the past has been shown to function as a reliable model system for the differentiation of oligodendrocytes from their O2-A precursors (7Sock E. Leger H. Kuhlbrodt K. Schreiber J. Enderich J. Richter-Landsberg C. Wegner M. J. Neurochem. 1997; 68: 1911-1919Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 25Louis J.C. Magal E. Muir D. Manthorpe M. Varon S. J. Neurosci. Res. 1992; 31: 193-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (362) Google Scholar,38Pende M. Holtzclaw L.A. Curtis J.L. Russell J.T. Gallo V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 3215-3219Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). mRNA was prepared from CG-4 cells before the onset of differentiation as well as 3 days after induction, and, as a control, from forskolin-treated Schwann cells. After reverse transcription, the resulting cDNA served as template for semi-quantitative PCR. Reaction conditions were chosen such that amplification was in the linear range. Amplification of a GAPDH-specific product from each cDNA, furthermore, indicated that comparable amounts of cDNA were present in each sample (Fig.2 A). As expected, cDNA from Schwann cells contained significant amounts of Tst-1/Oct6/SCIP, whereas Brn-1 and Brn-2 were absent. Undifferentiated CG-4 cells, which are comparable to oligodendrocyte progenitors, on the other hand, expressed Brn-1, Brn-2, and Tst-1/Oct6/SCIP. Interestingly, the expression of all three POU proteins was down-regulated after differentiation as judged from the amounts of PCR products in samples from differentiated and undifferentiated CG-4 cells. In agreement with data from our degenerate PCR we could not detect Brn-4 in CG-4 cells at any stage of differentiation. Similarly, Brn-4 was absent from Schwann cell cDNA. RT-PCR analysis was also performed on cDNA samples derived from primary oligodendroglial cells, which were kept in culture for 3 days or 2 weeks (Fig. 2 B). Because differentiation proceeds with time in culture, 2-week-old cultures contained a lower proportion of oligodendrocyte progenitor cells and a correspondingly higher proportion of mature oligodendrocytes as 3-day-old cultures. As already observed for CG-4 cells, all class III POU genes with the exception of Brn-4 were expressed in the oligodendrocyte lineage. Expression levels for Brn-1, Brn-2, and Tst-1/Oct6/SCIP were significantly higher in 3-day-old cultures than in 2-week-old cultures, indicating that expression of all three POU genes is down-regulated during oligodendrocyte differentiation. Amplification of a GAPDH-specific product again confirmed the presence of similar amounts of cDNA in both samples. To assess whether this expression pattern was reflected on the protein level, we performed gel shift analysis on extracts of undifferentiated CG-4 cells using the octamer site from the Herpes simplex virus ICP0 gene (HSVoct) as a probe (39ApRhys C.M. Ciufo D.M. O'Neill E.A. Kelly T.J. Hayward G.S. J. Virol. 1989; 63: 2798-2812Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). As shown in Fig.3 A, two complexes were obtained with CG-4 cell nuclear extract. To identify the proteins present in these two complexes, we expressed each of the four known class III POU proteins ectopically in transfected COS cells. By using nuclear extracts from transfected COS cells, we then compared the mobility of complexes formed between class III POU proteins and the HSVoct probe with the mobility of the two CG-4 cell complexes. The upper complex from CG-4 cell extracts exhibited a mobility characteristic of Brn-1. The lower complex from CG-4 cell extracts, on the other hand, migrated at a position similar to Brn-2 or Tst-1/Oct6/SCIP. In agreement with RNA analyses, no complex was observed at a position corresponding to Brn-4. Whole cell extracts of primary oligodendrocyte progenitor cells exhibited a similar pattern in electrophoretic mobility shifts as undifferentiated CG-4 cells (Fig. 3 B), again pointing to the fact that CG-4 cells are a good model system for the oligodendrocyte lineage. Extracts from several other cells were also tested. Under identical assay conditions only the lower of the two complexes was observed with nuclear extracts of primary Schwann cells, C6 glioblastoma cells, or OLN-93 oligodendroglioma cells (data not shown). To further corroborate the presence of Brn-1, Brn-2, and Tst-1/Oct6/SCIP in the respective complexes, we next performed antibody perturbation experiments (Fig. 3 C). Using longer gels to obtain a higher resolution, we attempted to separate the Brn-2 and Tst-1/Oct6/SCIP containing complexes. On these gels, the lower complex indeed split into a more prominent upper and a less intense lower band. When antibodies specific to Brn-1 were incubated with CG-4 cell extracts and the HSVoct, the complex with the lowest mobility disappeared. Incubation with a Brn-2 specific antiserum led to the selective disappearance of the middle complex, whereas an antiserum against Tst-1/Oct6/SCIP abolished the complex with the highest mobility. Thus, all class III POU proteins except Brn-4 could be detected in CG-4 cell extracts. Assuming similar DNA binding characteristics (see below), Tst-1/Oct6/SCIP seemed to be less abundant in CG-4 cells than either Brn-1 or Brn-2. Next we compared the amounts of class III POU proteins in extracts of differentiating CG-4 cells with the levels present i"

Here we report that Pyk2, another member of the focal adhesion kinase family, was present in the RBL-2H3 mast cell line and was rapidly tyrosine-phosphorylated and activated after FcεRI aggregation. Tyrosine phosphorylation of Pyk2 was also induced by the calcium ionophore A23187, by phorbol myristate acetate, or by stimulation of G-protein-coupled receptors. Adherence of cells to fibronectin dramatically enhanced the induced tyrosine phosphorylation of Pyk2. Although Src family kinases are activated by FcεRI stimulation and tyrosine-phosphorylate the receptor subunits, the activation and tyrosine phosphorylation of Pyk2 were downstream of Syk. In contrast, tyrosine phosphorylation of Pyk2 by stimulation of G-protein-coupled receptors was independent of Syk. Therefore, the FcεRI-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of Pyk2 is downstream of Syk and may play a role in cell secretion.

Previously we observed that FcεRI aggregation results in the tyrosine phosphorylation of ∼115-kDa proteins in the rat basophilic leukemia RBL-2H3 mast cell line (21Benhamou M. Stephan V. Robbins K.C.

Pyk2 (also called RAFTK for related adhesion focal tyrosine kinase, CAKβ for cell adhesion kinase β, CADTK and FAK2) is a cytoplasmic protein-tyrosine kinase that, like FAK, lacks a transmembrane region, myristoylation sites, and Src homology 2 and 3 domains. Both FAK and Pyk2 have a central kinase region flanked by large N-terminal and C-terminal domains. Pyk2 is expressed in neuronal cells, CD34+ bone marrow cells, primary bone marrow megakaryocytes, platelets, and T and B cells (24Lev S. Moreno H. Martinez R. Canoll P. Peles E. Musacchio J.M.

These stimuli include carbachol acting through nicotinic acetycholine receptors, stress signals, membrane depolarization, cytokines, and molecules that activate G-protein-coupled receptors. Recently, Pyk2 was found to be tyrosine-phosphorylated after integrin or immune receptor activation (27Li J.Z. Avraham H. Rogers R.A. Raja S. Avraham S.

Pyk2 is also activated by addition of the calcium ionophore and PMA, suggesting that the activation of Pyk2 is downstream of the increase in intracellular calcium and the activation of protein kinase C (24Lev S.

Stimulation of the cells with different stimuli induced the tyrosine phosphorylation of Pyk2. In a Syk-deficient cell line, G-protein-coupled receptors, but not FcεRI aggregation, still induced tyrosine phosphorylation of Pyk2. Therefore, there are Syk-dependent and -independent pathways for Pyk2 activation. Mouse monoclonal anti-Pyk2 was from Transduction Laboratories (Lexington, KY). The horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-phosphotyrosine monoclonal antibody, 4G10, was from Upstate Biotechnology Inc. (Lake Placid, NY). Affinity-purified rabbit anti-mouse Igs were obtained from Jackson ImmunoResearch (West Grove, PA). All other antibodies have been described previously (11Benhamou M. Ryba N.J.P. Kihara H. Nishikata H. Siraganian R.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 23318-23324Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The materials for electrophoresis were purchased from Novex (San Diego, CA), and the source of other materials was as described previously (11Benhamou M. Ryba N.J.P. Kihara H. Nishikata H. Siraganian R.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 23318-23324Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).N 6-2-(4-Aminophenyl)ethyladenosine (APNEA) was from Research Biochemicals International (Natick, MA), and fibronectin was from Calbiochem (La Jolla, CA). RBL-2H3, the Syk-negative variant TB1A2, and the Syk-transfected cells were maintained as monolayer cultures (20Zhang J. Berenstein E.H. Evans R.L. Siraganian R.P. J. Exp. Med. 1996; 184: 71-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar, 37Barsumian E.L. Isersky C. Petrino M.G. Siraganian R.P. Eur. J. Immunol. 1981; 11: 317-323Crossref PubMed Scopus (481) Google Scholar). Cells were stimulated either with antigen after overnight culture in the presence of antigen-specific IgE, or with different stimuli essentially as described previously (3Benhamou M. Gutkind J.S. Robbins K.C. Siraganian R.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 5327-5330Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). The concentration of the stimuli were: 30 ng/ml dinitrophenyl coupled to human serum albumin, 0.5 μm calcium ionophore A23187, 40 nm PMA, 1 unit/ml human plasma thrombin, or 10 μm APNEA. After stimulation for the indicated times, the medium was removed for histamine analysis. The monolayers were then rinsed with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline containing protease inhibitors and sodium orthovanadate with the same concentrations as in the lysis buffer described below and solubilized in lysis buffer (50 mmTris, pH 7.4, containing 1% Triton X-100, 1 mmNa3VO4, 150 mm NaCl, 5 μg/ml leupeptin, 45 milliunits/ml aprotinin, 1 μg/ml pepstatin A, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). The cells were scraped, and supernatants were collected after centrifugation for 30 min at 16,000 × g, 4 °C. In experiments to deplete extracellular Ca2+, the monolayers were washed twice either with Ca2+-containing (1.8 mm CaCl2) or Ca2+-free (1 mm EGTA) medium 199. The cells were then stimulated either in Ca2+-containing (1.8 mm CaCl2) or Ca2+-free (10 μm EGTA) medium. Stimulation of nonadherent and fibronectin-adherent cells was done as described previously (22Hamawy M.M. Mergenhagen S.E. Siraganian R.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 5227-5233Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Lysates were precleared by mixing for 1 h at 4 °C with protein A-agarose beads. The lysates were then incubated with 3 μg of mouse IgG or anti-Pyk2 antibody that had been preincubated with 10 μg of rabbit anti-mouse Ig and 25 μl of protein A-agarose beads. After gentle rotation at 4 °C for 1 h, the beads were washed three times with 1 ml of wash buffer (cell lysis buffer with detergent concentration decreased by 50%), once with 150 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris, pH 7.4, and the proteins eluted by boiling for 5 min with Laemmli's sample buffer as described previously (17Kihara H. Siraganian R.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 22427-22432Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Samples from the immunoprecipitations were separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis under reducing conditions, electrotransferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Millipore), and tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins were detected with monoclonal antibody 4G10 conjugated to horseradish peroxidase as described previously (4Stephan V. Benhamou M. Gutkind J.S. Robbins K.C. Siraganian R.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 5434-5441Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Proteins were visualized using the enhanced chemiluminescence kit from DuPont and Kodak X-Omat radiographic film (Eastman Kodak Co.). Antibodies were stripped from the membranes, and then membranes were reprobed with anti-Pyk2 antibodies. Pyk2 immunoprecipitated as described above was further washed with kinase buffer (30 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 10 mm MgCl2, and 2 mm MnCl2), and resuspended in 30 μl of kinase buffer. The reactions were started by the addition of 5 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP and 5 μm ATP. After 30 min of incubation at room temperature, the reactions were stopped by the addition of 50 μl of 2 × Laemmli's sample buffer and boiling for 5 min. Following centrifugation, the eluted proteins were separated under reducing conditions by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (4–20% gels), electrotransferred to membranes, and visualized by autoradiography. In some experiments, the kinase reaction buffer contained as substrate 20 μg of poly(Glu-Tyr) (4:1) (20–50 kDa). Scanning densitometry was with a Pharmacia LKB Imagemaster. We and others have reported that several ∼115-kDa proteins including FAK are tyrosine-phosphorylated after stimulation of RBL-2H3 cells (6Benhamou M. Siraganian R.P. Immunol. Today. 1992; 13: 195-197Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar, 15Hamawy M.M. Mergenhagen S.E. Siraganian R.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 6851-6854Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Since Pyk2 is another ∼115-kDa molecule with homology to FAK, we examined whether Pyk2 was tyrosine-phosphorylated. By immunoblotting, the Pyk2 protein-tyrosine kinase was detectable in RBL-2H3 cells (see below). There was constitutive low level tyrosine phosphorylation of Pyk2 (Fig.1 A). FcεRI aggregation induced a dramatic increase in the tyrosine phosphorylation of Pyk2 that was dependent on the extent of the stimulation with different concentrations of antigen. In time-course experiments, the tyrosine phosphorylation of Pyk2 was apparent at 1 min after stimulation and peaked by 10 min (Fig. 1 B). This tyrosine phosphorylation paralleled the release of histamine from the cells. These results demonstrate that there is rapid tyrosine phosphorylation of Pyk2 after FcεRI aggregation. Since tyrosine kinase activity is important for signal transduction, we next determined whether Pyk2 was activated by stimulation of FcεRI. By in vitro kinase reaction there was increased autophosphorylation of Pyk2 within 2 min after FcεRI aggregation (Fig. 2). There was also increased kinase activity as determined by phosphorylation of the poly(Glu-Tyr) substrate. Therefore, aggregation of FcεRI induced increased tyrosine phosphorylation and kinase activity of Pyk2. Following FcεRI aggregation, some proteins are tyrosine-phosphorylated early, whereas others are phosphorylated at later stages after a rise in intracellular calcium or the activation of protein kinase C (3Benhamou M.

Signalling. 1995; 7: 535-544Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar, 21Benhamou M. Stephan V. Robbins K.C. Siraganian R.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 7310-7314Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, activation and tyrosine phosphorylation of Pyk2 by stimulation of several cell-surface receptors may be due to the increase in intracellular calcium (24Lev S. Moreno H. Martinez R. Canoll P. Peles E. Musacchio J.M. Plowman G.D. Rudy B. Schlessinger J. Nature. 1995; 376: 737-745Crossref PubMed Scopus (1243) Google Scholar). In the RBL-2H3 cells, addition of calcium ionophore A23187 to directly increase intracellular calcium induced an increase in the tyrosine phosphorylation of Pyk2, which was similar to that by FcεRI activation (Fig. 3). There was also strong tyrosine phosphorylation of Pyk2 when cells were stimulated with PMA, an activator of protein kinase C. Under these conditions, there was histamine release with the calcium ionophore A23187 but no degranulation with PMA. These experiments suggested that the increased tyrosine phosphorylation of Pyk2 could be due to the rise in intracellular calcium and/or the activation of protein kinase C. FcεRI aggregation results in the release of Ca2+ from intracellular stores followed by the influx of Ca2+ from the medium. Since calcium ionophore induced the tyrosine phosphorylation of Pyk2, we examined the role of extracellular Ca2+ in the FcεRI-mediated tyrosine phosphorylation of Pyk2. RBL-2H3 cells were washed and then stimulated in a Ca2+-free medium (Fig. 4). The tyrosine phosphorylation of Pyk2 was decreased when the cells were stimulated in the absence of Ca2+ in the medium. Therefore, at least part of the tyrosine phosphorylation of Pyk2 was independent of the large increase in intracellular Ca2+ that occurs by influx of Ca2+ from the medium. Previously we observed that integrin-mediated adherence of RBL-2H3 cells to fibronectin resulted in the tyrosine phosphorylation of FAK (15Hamawy M.M. Mergenhagen S.E. Siraganian R.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 6851-6854Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Cell adhesion also enhanced the FcεRI-induced secretion and protein-tyrosine phosphorylation of FAK (15Hamawy M.M. Mergenhagen S.E. Siraganian R.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 6851-6854Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 38Hamawy M.M. Oliver C. Mergenhagen S.E. Siraganian R.P. J. Immunol. 1992; 149: 615-621PubMed Google Scholar). For the experiments described so far, the cells were adherent as monolayers and there was always some constitutive tyrosine phosphorylation of Pyk2. We therefore investigated whether adherence by integrins regulated the tyrosine phosphorylation of Pyk2 (Fig.5). When RBL-2H3 cells were added to either BSA- or fibronectin-coated surfaces, more than 90% of the cells adhered to fibronectin-coated surfaces, but none attached to BSA-coated surfaces. After plating the cells for 20 min at 37 °C, there was a slight increase in the tyrosine phosphorylation of Pyk2 in adherent compared with nonadherent cells (data not shown). Cell stimulation had dramatically different effects in nonadherent as compared with adherent cells. In the nonadherent cells, there was a very slight increase in the tyrosine phosphorylation of Pyk2 after FcεRI aggregation but no detectable change with the calcium ionophore or with PMA. In contrast, adherence dramatically enhanced the tyrosine phosphorylation of Pyk2 by stimulation with antigen, calcium ionophore, and PMA. Therefore, cell activation by adherence and other receptors synergistically regulate the tyrosine phosphorylation of Pyk2. In a Syk-deficient variant of the RBL-2H3 cell line, some proteins including the β and γ subunits of FcεRI are still tyrosine-phosphorylated, but there is no release of Ca2+ from intracellular sources and no influx of Ca2+ (20Zhang J. Berenstein E.H. Evans R.L. Siraganian R.P. J. Exp. Med. 1996; 184: 71-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar). We therefore used these Syk-deficient cells to evaluate the role of Syk in tyrosine phosphorylation of Pyk2 (Fig.6). Although there was less Pyk2 in the Syk-negative cells, its constitutive tyrosine phosphorylation was similar to that in the wild type RBL-2H3 cells. FcεRI aggregation did not induce an increase in the tyrosine phosphorylation of Pyk2 in the Syk-negative cells. However, in the cells that had been stably transfected with Syk, there was reconstitution of the FcεRI-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of Pyk2. Therefore, the FcεRI-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of Pyk2 requires Syk. In different cell types, stimulation of G-protein-coupled receptors such as those for bradykinin, thrombin, or lysophospatidic acid results in the tyrosine phosphorylation of Pyk2 (24Lev S. Moreno H.

Tokiwa G. Lev S. Courtneidge S.A. Schlessinger J. Nature. 1996; 383: 547-550Crossref PubMed Scopus (876) Google Scholar). Stimulation of thrombin and adenosine G-protein-coupled receptors in RBL-2H3 cells results in transient mobilization of intracellular calcium (39Ali H. Tomhave E.D. Richardson R.M. Haribabu B. Snyderman R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 3200-3206Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 40Ramkumar V. Stiles G.L. Beaven M.A. Ali H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 16887-16890Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Thrombin stimulation is mediated by a pertussis toxin-insensitive G-protein, whereas adenosine is inhibited by this toxin, suggesting that it is probably mediated by Gi (39Ali H. Tomhave E.D. Richardson R.M. Haribabu B. Snyderman R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 3200-3206Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 41Ramkumar V. Wilson M. Dhanraj D.N. Gettys T.W. Ali H. J. Immunol. 1995; 154: 5436-5443PubMed Google Scholar). Stimulation with thrombin of both the RBL-2H3 and the Syk-negative TB1A2 cells induced the rapid tyrosine phosphorylation of Pyk2 (Fig.7 A). This tyrosine phosphorylation in both the wild type and in the Syk-negative cells was detectable within 30 s of stimulation. Similarly the stimulation of adenosine receptors induced Pyk2 tyrosine phosphorylation in both the RBL-2H3 and the Syk-negative cells (Fig. 7 B). Therefore, Syk is not required for tyrosine phosphorylation of Pyk2 induced by G-protein-coupled receptors. These studies indicate that Pyk2 was present in mast cells and was tyrosine-phosphorylated and activated after cell stimulation. There were at least two different pathways that led to Pyk2 activation. The pathway from FcεRI aggregation required Syk, whereas that from G-protein-coupled receptors was Syk-independent. Pyk2 was also tyrosine-phosphorylated either by the addition of calcium ionophore A23187 to raise intracellular calcium or when protein kinase C was activated with PMA. These results strongly suggest that, similar to results in other cells, the tyrosine phosphorylation and activation of Pyk2 in mast cells was due to the rise in intracellular calcium (24Lev S. Moreno H. Martinez R. Canoll P. Peles E. Musacchio J.M. Plowman G.D. Rudy B. Schlessinger J. Nature. 1995; 376: 737-745Crossref PubMed Scopus (1243) Google Scholar, 28Tokiwa G. Dikic I. Lev S.

Nature. 1996; 383: 547-550Crossref PubMed Scopus (876) Google Scholar). Syk plays a major role in FcεRI-mediated activation of mast cells (20Zhang J. Berenstein E.H. Evans R.L. Siraganian R.P. J. Exp. Med. 1996; 184: 71-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar). In this pathway, receptor aggregation activates a protein-tyrosine kinase, probably Lyn, which results in tyrosine phosphorylation of the receptor subunits. Syk then binds to the tyrosine-phosphorylated receptor subunits and is activated to propagate downstream signals including the tyrosine phosphorylation of phospholipase C-γ, the release of calcium from intracellular sources, and the influx of calcium from the extracellular medium. Although FcεRI aggregation in the Syk-deficient cells results in the tyrosine phosphorylation of the β and γ subunits of the receptor and of several proteins (20Zhang J. Berenstein E.H. Evans R.L. Siraganian R.P. J. Exp. Med. 1996; 184: 71-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar, 42Kimura T. Sakamoto H. Appella E. Siraganian R.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 13991-13996Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar), it did not induce the activation or tyrosine phosphorylation of Pyk2. In contrast, activation of the T cell receptor, another member of the immune receptor family, results in tyrosine phosphorylation of Pyk2 that is selectively mediated by the Src family kinase Fyn (32Ganju R.K.

Schlessinger J. Weiss A. J. Exp. Med. 1997; 185: 1253-1259Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). These seemingly contradictory observations can be explained if, in mast cells, FcεRI aggregation by a Syk-dependent pathway results in an increase in intracellular calcium, which then utilizes a Src family kinase to tyrosine-phosphorylate Pyk2. The integrin-mediated adherence of RBL-2H3 cells to fibronectin results in cell spreading, reorganization of the cytoskeleton, and a redistribution of the granules to the periphery of the cells (38Hamawy M.M. Oliver C. Mergenhagen S.E. Siraganian R.P. J. Immunol. 1992; 149: 615-621PubMed Google Scholar, 43Hamawy M.M. Mergenhagen S.E. Siraganian R.P. Immunol. Today. 1994; 15: 62-66Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Adhesion also results in tyrosine phosphorylation of proteins such as FAK and the cytoskeletal protein paxillin (15Hamawy M.M. Mergenhagen S.E. Siraganian R.P. J. Biol.

Similarly, in the present experiments, there was a slight increase in tyrosine phosphorylation of Pyk2 after adherence to fibronectin, a reaction that is probably mediated by β1 integrins. The aggregation of β1 integrins in B cells and β3 integrins in T cells results in tyrosine phosphorylation of Pyk2 (34Ma E.A. Lou O. Berg N.N. Ostergaard H.L. Eur. J.

Avraham S. Blood. 1996; 88: 417-428Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). At these sites, the cytoplasmic domains of the integrins form focal adhesion complexes that contain cytoskeletal proteins such as talin, vinculin, α-actinin, filamin, FAK, and other phosphoproteins (27Li J.Z. Avraham H. Rogers R.A. Raja S. Avraham S. Blood. 1996; 88: 417-428Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 44Clark E.A. Brugge J.S.

Cell Biol. 1988; 4: 487-525Crossref PubMed Scopus (1684) Google Scholar). Although RBL-2H3 cells do not form classical focal adhesion complexes, stimulation of the cells results in actin plaques and tyrosine phosphorylation of FAK (15Hamawy M.M. Mergenhagen S.E. Siraganian R.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 6851-6854Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 48Pfeiffer J.R. Oliver J.M. J. Immunol. 1994; 152: 270-279PubMed Google Scholar). Here we observed that the stimulated tyrosine phosphorylation of Pyk2, as was previously reported for FAK, was dramatically enhanced by the adhesion of the cells to fibronectin (15Hamawy M.M. Mergenhagen S.E. Siraganian R.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 6851-6854Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, adhesion to fibronectin modulates the activation of both Pyk2 and FAK. There is also enhanced secretion from adherent cells. Therefore, adherence by regulating the level of the tyrosine phosphorylation of Pyk2, FAK, and other proteins could control the extent of degranulation in these cells. Pyk2 interacts with signaling molecules and may therefore play a role in signal transduction in mast cells. Pyk2 associates through its C-terminal region with paxillin, a 68-kDa cytoskeletal protein that is tyrosine-phosphorylated after FcεRI aggregation (36Hiregowdara D. Avraham H. Fu Y. London R.

Paxillin also accumulates at focal adhesion sites and binds to pp60 src, Lyn, Crk, vinculin, and talin. Pyk2 also associates with Grb2, which by binding to Shc and Sos may activate the Ras pathway (24Lev S. Moreno H. Martinez R. Canoll P. Peles E. Musacchio J.M. Plowman G.D. Rudy B. Schlessinger J.

There is also binding of p130 cas to Pyk2, probably by the SH3 domain of p130 cas binding to the C-terminal proline-rich region of Pyk2 (35Astier A. Avraham H. Manie S.N. Groopman J. Canty T. Avraham S. Freedman A.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 228-232Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). Pyk2 tyrosine-phosphorylates the potassium channel and suppresses channel currents (24Lev S. Moreno H. Martinez R. Canoll P. Peles E. Musacchio J.M. Plowman G.D. Rudy B. Schlessinger J. Nature. 1995; 376: 737-745Crossref PubMed Scopus (1243) Google Scholar) and also acts as an upstream regulator for stress signal activation of c-Jun N-terminal kinase (28Tokiwa G. Dikic I. Lev S. Schlessinger J. Science. 1996; 273: 792-794Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar). As many of these pathways are activated in stimulated mast cells, tyrosine phosphorylation of Pyk2 may play a role in the signals that lead to generation of mediators. Stimulation of cells by many G-protein-coupled receptors results in the tyrosine phosphorylation of Pyk2 (24Lev S. Moreno H. Martinez R. Canoll P. Peles E. Musacchio J.M. Plowman G.D. Rudy B.

Mast cells have thrombin receptors that couple to Gq, a pertussis toxin-insensitive G-protein α-subunit and A3 adenosine receptors that couple to a pertussis toxin-sensitive α-subunit Gi. The stimulation of these receptors in RBL-2H3 cells results in a transient increase in intracellular Ca2+ (39Ali H. Tomhave E.D. Richardson R.M. Haribabu B. Snyderman R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 3200-3206Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar,40Ramkumar V. Stiles G.L. Beaven M.A. Ali H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 16887-16890Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Here we observed that stimulation of the cells with either thrombin or an adenosine analog induced the rapid tyrosine phosphorylation of Pyk2. Interestingly the extent of this phosphorylation was not dependent on the presence of Syk in the cells. These results demonstrate that there are Syk-independent pathways that link G-protein-coupled receptors to Pyk2 activation. In summary, these experiments indicate that stimulation of mast cells with different stimuli induces the tyrosine phosphorylation of Pyk2. The FcεRI-mediated phosphorylation was downstream of Syk and probably secondary to the mobilization of intracellular Ca2+. In contrast, G-protein-coupled receptors induced tyrosine phosphorylation of Pyk2, which was independent of Syk. Adherence of cells to fibronectin regulated the tyrosine phosphorylation of Pyk2, similar to that which we had observed previously for FAK (15Hamawy M.M. Mergenhagen S.E. Siraganian R.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 6851-6854Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Since there are two different focal adhesion kinases in RBL-2H3 cells, it will be important to clarify the function of these two molecules in the signaling cascade. We thank Drs. Teruaki Kimura and Nicholas Ryba for helpful discussions and for reviewing this manuscript. We also thank Greta Bader for histamine analysis of the samples."

We have purified paranemin from embryonic chick skeletal muscle, prepared antibodies, and demonstrated that they label at the Z-lines of both adult avian and porcine cardiac and skeletal muscle myofibrils. We determined the cDNA sequence of paranemin by immunoscreening a λgt22A cDNA library from embryonic chick skeletal muscle. Northern blot analysis revealed a single transcript of 5.3 kilobases, which is much smaller than predicted from the size of paranemin (280 kDa) by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The derived amino acid sequence of paranemin (1,606 residues; 178,161 kDa) contains the conserved IF rod domain (308 amino acids), which has highest homology to the rod domains of nestin and tanabin. Thus, paranemin is an IF protein rather than an IFAP. Sequence analysis also revealed that the partial cDNA sequences of two proteins, namely EAP-300 and IFAPa-400, are almost identical to regions of the cDNA sequence of paranemin. The complete paranemin cDNA was expressed in a cell line (SW13) with, and without, detectable cytoplasmic IFs. Antibody labeling of these cells suggests that paranemin does not form IFs by itself, but rather is incorporated into heteropolymeric IFs with vimentin.

Much is now known about the cellular distribution, structure, and assembly of IFs (for recent reviews, see Refs. 3Fuchs E. Weber K. Annu. Rev.

Most IF proteins can be grouped into five major types or classes based upon their sequence and structure (1Steinert P.M. Roop D.R. Annu. Rev.

Biochem. 1994; 63: 345-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (1273) Google Scholar). The IFs, in general, are often considered to play an important role in the mechanical integration of cellular space (7Lazarides E.

They are present in a collar-like arrangement around the myofibrillar Z-lines where they appear to connect adjacent myofibrils together, and possibly help link the peripheral layer of myofibrils to costameric sites along the muscle cell membrane (4Klymkowsky M.W.

Paranemin, ∼280 kDa by SDS-PAGE, was first identified in embryonic chick skeletal muscle (17Breckler J. Lazarides E. J. Cell Biol. 1982; 92: 795-806Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Paranemin has been considered an IF-associated protein (IFAP) (1Steinert P.M. Roop D.R. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1988; 57: 593-625Crossref PubMed Scopus (1123) Google Scholar, 18Foisner R. Wiche G. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1991; 3: 75-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar) because it copurified with the type III IF proteins vimentin and desmin from embryonic muscle (17Breckler J. Lazarides E. J. Cell Biol. 1982; 92: 795-806Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar), and colocalized with the major IF proteins vimentin and desmin at the periphery of avian myofibrillar Z-lines (17Breckler J. Lazarides E. J. Cell Biol. 1982; 92: 795-806Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 19Price M.G. Lazarides E. J. Cell Biol. 1983; 97: 1860-1874Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Its immunolocalization indicated a developmentally regulated expression in chick myogenic cells, and a more restricted expression in adult chicken muscle cells (17Breckler J. Lazarides E. J. Cell Biol. 1982; 92: 795-806Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 19Price M.G. Lazarides E. J. Cell Biol. 1983; 97: 1860-1874Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). As shown herein, paranemin contains the ∼310-amino acid rod domain characteristic of IF proteins. Therefore, paranemin is a member of the IF protein superfamily rather than an IFAP. By sequence comparisons with other IF proteins, we have found that paranemin shares some homologies to other IF proteins, but significant differences as well. We also show in this report that regions of paranemin's sequence are almost identical to the partial cDNA sequences reported for two other proteins, EAP-300 (20Kelly M.M. Phanhthoutath C. Brees D.K. McCabe C.F. Cole G.J. Dev. Brain Res. 1995; 85: 31-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar) and IFAPa-400 (21Simard J.-L. Cossette L.J. Rong P.-M. Martinoli M.G. Pelletier G. Vincent M. Dev. Brain Res. 1992; 70: 173-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). The functional ability of paranemin to assemble into IFs was tested by cell transfection of the complete paranemin cDNA. Expression of paranemin cDNA in SW13 cell clones that either do, or do not, express vimentin, suggests that paranemin by itself is unable to form homopolymeric IFs, but that it can coassemble with vimentin into heteropolymeric IFs. Approximately 100 g of thigh and breast muscles were dissected from 144 14-day-old chick embryos and homogenized in 235 ml of 130 mm KCl, 5 mm EDTA, 20 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.5, as described (17Breckler J. Lazarides E. J. Cell Biol. 1982; 92: 795-806Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). The resulting homogenate was centrifuged for 15 min at 20,700 × g. The supernatant was filtered through glass wool and centrifuged for 90 min at 125,000 × g. The resulting supernatant, referred to as crude paranemin, was separated into four equal volumes (∼50 ml, ∼10 mg/ml), and each was applied to a 2.6 cm × 110-cm Bio-Gel A-5m (Bio-Rad) column previously equilibrated with 100 mm NaCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5 (17Breckler J. Lazarides E. J. Cell Biol. 1982; 92: 795-806Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Elution was carried out in equilibration buffer at a flow rate of 24 ml/h. All column fractions for the entire purification were collected in the presence of N α-p-tosyl-l-argininamide methyl ester to reduce proteolysis. Paranemin-enriched fractions (as determined by Western blotting) eluted near the column void volume, and were collected from the four column elutions, pooled, dialyzed against 6 m urea, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.5, and subjected to hydroxyapatite chromatography on a 2.6 cm × 33-cm column of HA-Ultrogel (Sepracor) previously equilibrated in the dialysis buffer. The column was eluted in the dialysis buffer with a linear 0–500 mm potassium phosphate gradient, pH 7.5, programmed on a Gradifrac System (Pharmacia Biotech) at a flow rate of 24 ml/h. Paranemin-containing fractions eluted from the column at ∼200 mm potassium phosphate, and were pooled, dialyzed against 6 m urea, 1 mmdithiothreitol, 5 mm EDTA, 0.2 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, and loaded onto a 2.6 cm × 20-cm DEAE-cellulose (Whatman, DE-52) column previously equilibrated with the dialysis buffer. The column was eluted in the dialysis buffer with a linear 0–2 m NaCl gradient at a flow rate of 24 ml/h. Paranemin-containing fractions eluted from the column at ∼1 m NaCl, and were pooled and dialyzed against column equilibration buffer. The sample of purified paranemin could be stored at −70 °C for at least 4 weeks without detectable degradation. Monoclonal antibodies were prepared following procedures described by Hemken et al. (22Hemken P. Guo X.-L. Wang Z.-Q. Zhang K. Gluck S. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 9948-9957Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Fusions with SP2/0-Ag14 (ATCC CRL 1581) myeloma cells were performed essentially according to published protocols (23McKearn T.J. Fitch F.W. Smilek D.E. Sarmiento M. Stuart F.P. Immunol. Rev. 1979; 47: 91-115Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays were performed to screen the monoclonals as described (22Hemken P. Guo X.-L. Wang Z.-Q. Zhang K. Gluck S. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 9948-9957Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Paranemin bands from SDS-PAGE gels, each containing ∼1 mg of protein, were minced and homogenized in 1-ml aliquots of phosphate-buffered saline and emulsified with equal volumes of TiterMax (Vaxcell, Inc.) adjuvant. New Zealand White specific pathogen-free rabbits were injected with purified paranemin at several sites subcutaneously over the back and at one site intramuscularly in the thigh. The rabbits were boosted twice after the initial injection at 4–6-week intervals. Titers were determined by Western blotting. Purified paranemin was subjected to SDS-PAGE and electrophoretically transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Micron Separations) (24Matsudaira P. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 10035-10038Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). For amino acid analysis, the 280-kDa paranemin band was excised from the washed blots and hydrolyzed in vacuo in 6 n HCl at 150 °C for 1, 2, and 3 h (25Moore S. Stein W.H. Methods Enzymol. 1963; 6: 819-831Crossref Scopus (1565) Google Scholar). Amino acid composition was determined with an Applied Biosystems Amino Acid Analyzer at the Iowa State University Protein Facility. For amino acid sequencing, deblocking using trifluoroacetic acid was necessary (26Wellner D. Panneerselvam C. Horecker B.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 1947-1949Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). The sample was analyzed with a 477A Protein Sequencer/120A Analyzer (Applied Biosystems Inc.). SDS-PAGE and Western blotting were performed essentially as described previously (22Hemken P. Guo X.-L. Wang Z.-Q. Zhang K. Gluck S. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 9948-9957Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Purified paranemin and synemin (27Becker B. Bellin R.M. Sernett S.W. Huiatt T.W. Robson R.M. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

Staehelin T. Gordon J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 4350-4354Crossref PubMed Scopus (44841) Google Scholar, 30Burnette W.N. Anal. Biochem. 1981; 112: 195-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (5889) Google Scholar). The blots were probed with monoclonal (4D3, 4C7, or 3B12 culture supernatant) or polyclonal antibodies to paranemin. Secondary antibodies included alkaline phosphatase-labeled sheep anti-mouse IgG (Sigma) and goat anti-rabbit IgG (Sigma), and horseradish peroxidase-labeled goat anti-mouse IgG (Sigma). Antibody labeling for the antibody specificity experiments was visualized by using the substrate nitro blue tetrazolium/5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate. Labeling for the paranemin purification, β-galactosidase fusion protein experiments, and the expression of full-length paranemin in Escherichia coli was visualized by chemiluminescence (ECL, Amersham). Total RNA was isolated from skeletal muscle of 14-day embryonic chicks by extraction with guanidinium thiocyanate at 4 °C (31Han J.H. Stratowa C. Rutter W.J. Biochemistry. 1987; 26: 1617-1625Crossref PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar). Poly(A)+ RNA was purified by chromatography on an oligo(dT)-cellulose column (Collaborative Biomedical Products) (32Aviv H. Leder P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1972; 69: 1408-1412Crossref PubMed Scopus (5179) Google Scholar). Ten μg of poly(A)+ RNA were used to construct an oligo(dT)-primed, directional cDNA expression library in λgt22A using the Lambda SuperScript system (Life Technologies, Inc.). By immunoscreening of the λgt22A cDNA library using monoclonal antibody 4D3 to paranemin and the ProtoBlot detection system (Promega Corp.), 132 positive plaques were identified. Of these, 20 were purified to homogeneity. For sequencing, the two clones having the largest inserts, 9 (3.2 kb) and 40 (2.7 kb), were subcloned into pBluescript II SK(+) vector (Stratagene) (33Sambrook J. Fritsch E.G. Maniatis T.

The cDNA library was rescreened by hybridization using a 205-bp BstXI restriction enzyme-generated cDNA probe from the 5′ end of clone 9 and a 2.2-kb cDNA probe generated by 5′-rapid amplification of cDNA ends (5′-RACE). For the 2.2-kb 5′-RACE probe, reverse-transcription of a poly(A)+ RNA sample was performed with a gene-specific primer spanning paranemin cDNA positions 2148–2165. PCR amplification of the target cDNA was performed using a paranemin-specific primer spanning cDNA positions 2130–2147 and the Anchor Primer (Life Technologies, Inc.). The λgt22A library was screened with both probes using a Digoxigenin DNA Labeling and Detection Kit (Boehringer Mannheim). A total of 200 positive plaques were chosen, 100 from each probe. PCR was used to screen λ phage mixes of all 200 positive plaques for sequence overlapping clone 9 by using a gene-specific primer spanning paranemin cDNA positions 2130–2147 and the λgt11 Upstream Amplimer Primer (CLONTECH). Twenty clones that contained a 2.2-kb product by PCR screening were purified to homogeneity. Clones 3, 24, 89, and 169 were subcloned into pBluescript II SK(+) vector for sequencing. Northern blots were performed essentially as described (34Wiche G. Becker B. Luber K. Weitzer G. Castañon M.J. Hauptmann R. Stratowa C. Stewart M. J.

Hybridization was performed overnight at 42 °C using 32P random prime-labeled cDNA probes diluted to a specific activity between 1.7 × 104 and 1.7 × 105 Bq/ml. Unbound probe was removed by washing the filter at a final stringency of 0.2 × SSC and 0.1% (w/v) SDS at 50 °C for 30 min. Filters were exposed to Hyperfilm-MP (Amersham) for 3 days at −70 °C. Synthetic RNA markers were visualized by staining in 0.04% (w/v) methylene blue in 0.5 m sodium acetate, pH 5.2. Purified phages of clone 9 were tested with monoclonal antibodies 4C7 and 3B12, and with rabbit polyclonal antiserum to paranemin. Bacterial lawns were infected with approximately 500 plaque forming units for each 150-mm plate. Incubations and visualization of antibody binding were done identically to immunoscreening of the library with monoclonal antibody 4D3. Crude lysates from recombinant lysogens in E. coli Y1089r− were prepared as described (36Huynh T.V. Young R.A. Davis R.W. Glover D.M. DNA Cloning: A Practical Approach. 1. IRL Press Limited, Oxford, UK1985: 76-78Google Scholar) for subsequent SDS-PAGE analysis and Western blotting. For analysis of the protein expressed from the full-length paranemin sequence, clone 24 was inserted into the pProExHTb vector (Life Technologies, Inc.) and expressed in E. coli XL-I Blue. Bacterial lysates, along with paranemin purified from muscle tissue, were subjected to Western blotting using the paranemin polyclonal antibodies. Nucleotide sequencing was conducted at the Iowa State University DNA Sequencing and Synthesis Facility using automated sequencers (373A and 377 DNA Sequencers, Applied Biosystems Inc.). Both strands of overlapping clones 9 and 89 were sequenced at least one time. Sequences at both 5′- and 3′-ends and at least three internal regions were also obtained for clones 3, 24, 40, and 169, which spanned the following paranemin cDNA positions: 3 (−24 to 2853), 24 (−14 to 5261), 89 (−14 to 2164), 169 (−9 to 2574), 9 (2035 to 5255), and 40 (2575 to 5255). Analysis of the nucleotide and predicted amino acid sequences was done using the GCG software package (Program Manual for the Wisconsin Package, Version 8) (37Devereux J. Haekerli P. Smithies O. Nucleic Acids Res. 1984; 12: 387-395Crossref PubMed Scopus (11534) Google Scholar). Dot matrix comparisons were performed with COMPARE, and the output was displayed by DOTPLOT (38Maizel Jr., J.V. Lenk R.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1981; 78: 7665-7669Crossref PubMed Scopus (345) Google Scholar). Multiple sequence alignment was done using PILEUP. Sequences of the rod domains from the following IF proteins were aligned: frog tanabin (39Hemmati-Brivanlou A. Mann R.W. Harland R.M.

The IF signature was identified with MOTIFS. Secondary structure predictions were analyzed according to the methods of Chou and Fassman (45Chou P.Y. Fasman G.D. Adv. Enzymol. 1978; 47: 45-148PubMed Google Scholar) and Garnier et al. (46Garnier J. Osguthorpe D.J. Robson B. J. Mol.

A restriction enzyme map and isoelectric point of paranemin sequence were predicted by using MAPSORT and ISOELECTRIC, respectively. Basic Local Alignment Search Tool (BLAST) searches were performed using the NCBI BLAST E-mail server (47Altschul S.F. Gish W. Miller W. Myers E.W. Lipman D.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 215: 403-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (69652) Google Scholar) to search both nucleotide (PDB, GBUpdate, GenBank, EmblUpdate, and EMBL) and peptide (PDB, SwissProt, PIR, SPUpdate, GenPept, and GPUpdate) sequence data bases. The 5′-RACE system Life Technologies, Inc.) was used to synthesize cDNA corresponding to the 5′-end of the paranemin transcript (48Frohman M.A. Dush M.K. Martin G.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 8998-9002Crossref PubMed Scopus (4329) Google Scholar). Reverse-transcription of a poly(A)+ RNA sample was performed with gene-specific primers spanning paranemin cDNA positions 1011 to 1028 and 2130 to 2147, and the SuperScript II reverse transcriptase (Life Technologies, Inc.). After removal of excess dNTP and primers, the cDNA was tailed with dCTP and terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase. Amplification of target cDNA was performed with Taq DNA polymerase (Promega), the anchor primer, and nested gene-specific primers spanning paranemin cDNA positions 455 to 472 or 1011 to 1028. PCR reactions of clones 3 and 24 were performed with the same nested gene-specific primers used for the amplification of the target cDNA and the M13 forward primer (Life Technologies, Inc.). The 5′-RACE and PCR products were analyzed on a 1% (w/v) agarose gel. Myofibrils were prepared according to Goll et al. (49Goll D.E. Stromer M.H. Robson R.M. Luke B.M. Hammond K.S. Tregear R.T. Insect Flight Muscle. Elsevier/North-Holland Inc., New York1977: 15-40Google Scholar) from adult chicken heart papillary and thigh muscle, and adult pig heart papillary and mixed neck muscle samples removed immediately after exsanguination. Myofibrils were placed on coverslips, and the coverslips were washed thoroughly to remove unbound myofibrils, incubated with undiluted culture supernatant of anti-paranemin monoclonal antibody 4D3 at 4 °C overnight, washed extensively, and then incubated for 30 min with a 1:50 dilution of fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled goat anti-mouse (Sigma). The coverslips were then washed thoroughly, mounted on glass slides with FITC-Guard (Testog), and examined with a Zeiss Photomicroscope III equipped for epifluorescence using × 67 and × 100 planapochromat objectives. Paranemin clone 24 was subcloned into the mammalian expression vector pRC/RSV (Invitrogen) at NotI and SalI sites. The expression construct was transfected into SW13cl.1Vim+ and SW13cl.2Vim− cells (obtained from Dr. W. Ip, University of Cincinnati, Cincinnati, OH; originally described by Sarria et al. (50Sarria A.J. Lieber J.G. Nordeen S.K. Evans R.M. J. Cell Sci. 1994; 107: 1593-1607PubMed Google Scholar)) (5 μg/∼75% confluent plate) via LipofectAMINE reagent (Life Technologies, Inc.). For vector control studies, the expression construct was replaced with the pRC/RSV vector with no insert. Proteins were visualized by double label immunofluorescence with anti-paranemin polyclonal antibodies and anti-vimentin monoclonal antibody AMF-17b (developed by Dr. A. B. Fulton, obtained from the Developmental Studies Hybridoma Bank maintained by the Department of Pharmacology and Molecular Sciences, Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, and the Department of Biological Sciences, University of Iowa, under contract NO1-HD-2-3144 from the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development). Transfected cells were grown on coverslips for 48 h and then fixed with cold methanol for 6 min at −20 °C. Coverslips were blocked for 30 min with 5% goat serum before a 1-h (37 °C) incubation with a mixture of the primary antibodies, with dilutions in phosphate-buffered saline of anti-paranemin, 1:100, and anti-vimentin, 1:5. The coverslips were thoroughly washed in phosphate-buffered saline and incubated for 2 h (37 °C) with a mixture of fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled goat anti-rabbit (1:200) and tetramethylrhodamine isothiocyanate-labeled goat anti-mouse (1:200). After incubation, the coverslips were again thoroughly washed in phosphate-buffered saline, mounted on glass slides with FITC-Guard (Testog), and observed on a Zeiss Photomicroscope III. The chromatographic purification of a representative (five total) paranemin preparation is shown in Fig. 1. A high molecular mass protein (∼280 kDa) was detected in the whole embryonic muscle homogenate (lane 1) and in the crude paranemin (lane 2), together with the IF proteins vimentin (54 kDa) and desmin (53 kDa), and many other proteins (17Breckler J. Lazarides E. J. Cell Biol. 1982; 92: 795-806Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Fractions eluting just after the void volume from the gel filtration column contained a complex of primarily paranemin, vimentin, and desmin (lane 3; vimentin and desmin are in same major band). Examination of negatively stained samples of these early fractions by electron microscopy revealed the presence of many long, ∼8–12 nm diameter filaments with irregular surface contour (data not shown), in agreement with results of Breckler and Lazarides (17Breckler J. Lazarides E. J. Cell Biol. 1982; 92: 795-806Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Only the first few fractions of the first peak collected immediately following the void volume were used for further purification. Hydroxyapatite chromatography was very effective in removing from the gel filtration, partially purified paranemin, small amounts of several proteins with molecular masses near that of paranemin, and near those of vimentin and desmin (lane 4). DEAE-cellulose column chromatography removed both the remaining vimentin and desmin and a trace of actin before elution of the purified paranemin (lane 5). The pooled fractions of purified paranemin are shown in Fig. 1 (lane 5). Paranemin made by this procedure also was examined by SDS-PAGE with higher percent acrylamide gels, and showed no evidence of lower molecular mass contaminants. Although Breckler and Lazarides (17Breckler J. Lazarides E. J. Cell Biol. 1982; 92: 795-806Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar) indicated the paranemin in their paranemin-enriched fractions migrated as two closely spaced polypeptides of very similar molecular mass by SDS-PAGE, we usually observed only one paranemin band, and sometimes one major band with a small trace of a band migrating just below it, which also labeled with monoclonal antibody 4D3 by Western blotting. The yield of paranemin from 100 g of embryonic skeletal muscle ranged from 1.2 to 2.5 mg with an average of 1.7 mg. Two monoclonal antibodies, 4D3 and 4C7, and the rabbit polyclonal a"

Furthermore, the effects of expressing APPΔNL in neurons on the production and secretion of Aβ-(1–40) and Aβ-(1–42) are unknown. To address these issues, we examined the generation of both intracellular and secreted Aβ-(1–40) and Aβ-(1–42) in human neuronal NT2N cells, in primary rat astrocytes, and in Chinese hamster ovary cells engineered to express wild-type APP or APPΔNL using a recombinant Semliki Forest virus expression system. Expression of APPΔNL led to a marked increase in APPβ and the C-terminal fragment containing the entire Aβ sequence (C99) in all cells tested. However, a dramatic elevation of intracellular and secreted Aβ-(1–40) and Aβ-(1–42) was seen only in astrocytes and Chinese hamster ovary cells. The ΔNL mutation did not cause a significant increase in intracellular or secreted Aβ-(1–40) or Aβ-(1–42) in NT2N cells. Since NT2N cells expressing APPΔNL accumulate much higher levels of C99 than cells expressing wild-type APP, we conclude that the rate-limiting step in Aβ production could be the further processing of C99 by γ-secretase in these cells. These results show that the Swedish ΔNL mutation causes nonneuronal cells to process APP via pathways more in common with the metabolism of wild-type APP in neurons.

A variety of proteolytic pathways have been described for the processing of APP, but not all of them result in the production of Aβ (reviewed in Refs. 10Sisodia S.S. Price D.L.

For example, a portion of APP is processed by the α-secretase pathway in which APP is cleaved within the Aβ region at or near the plasma membrane, releasing a large N-terminal ectodomain fragment (APPα) (12Sisodia S.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 6075-6079Crossref PubMed Scopus (627) Google Scholar, 13Esch F.S. Keim P.S. Beattie E.C. Blacher R.W. Culwell A.R. Oltersdorf T. McClure D. Ward P.J.

The utilization of this pathway appears to be preferred by transfected nonneuronal cells expressing wild-type APP (APPwt), since the N-terminal ectodomain containing the first 17 amino acids of Aβ (i.e. APPα) and p3, the Aβ fragment beginning at amino acid residue 17 of Aβ, are recovered at high levels from media conditioned by these transfected nonneuronal cells (13Esch F.S.

In addition, intracellular Aβ-(1–40) and Aβ-(1–42), but not p3, can be recovered in NT2N cells before their detection in the culture medium, suggesting an intracellular location for β-secretase.

Genet. 1994; 6: 251-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar), suggesting that the ΔNL mutation diverts APP into a processing pathway that resembles that found in postmitotic neurons. To test this hypothesis, we compared the processing of APPwt and APPΔNL in postmitotic NT2N cells, in primary rat astrocytes, and in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells. We found that APP is processed in a distinct manner in NT2N neurons and that the ΔNL mutation does not cause an increase in secreted or intracellular Aβ despite causing an increase in APPΔNL and C99 in these cells. However, this mutation does lead to greatly increased levels of intracellular and secreted Aβ-(1–40) and Aβ-(1–42) in both primary astrocytes and nonneuronal cell lines. These data provide evidence that the consequences of this familial AD-associated mutation on APP processing in nonneuronal cells is to increase the utilization of the β-secretory pathways at the expense of the α-secretory pathway such that they resemble the processing pathways in postmitotic neurons. Finally, we also provide evidence that γ-secretase, but not β-secretase, is a rate-limiting step in the production of Aβ in NT2N neuronal cells.DISCUSSIONExpression of APPΔNL in nonneuronal cells leads to a 5–10-fold increase in the amount of secreted and intracellular Aβ relative to that seen after expression of APPwt, perhaps explaining how this mutation results in accelerated AD pathology (19Martin B.L.

However, expression of APPΔNL in NT2N neurons resulted in only a minimal increase (<35%) in the amount of both secreted and intracellular Aβ-(1–40) and no increase in Aβ-(1–42) production. This differential effect of the Swedish ΔNL mutation on APP processing and Aβ production in NT2N neurons as compared with nonneuronal cell lines demonstrates that cells can process APPΔNL differently, provides insight into the mechanisms by which Aβ is generated from APPΔNL, and raises the question as to the cell type(s) specifically affected by this mutation in vivo that contribute the most to the formation of senile plaques.The failure of the ΔNL mutation to result in greatly enhanced Aβ production in NT2N neurons could be the result of several factors, including reduced processing by β- or γ-secretases. However, we found that expression of APPΔNL in all cell types examined, including NT2N cells, caused a marked shift from the α-secretory to the β-secretory pathway as evidenced by reduced secretion of APPα and increased secretion of APPβΔNL. The expression of APPΔNL also shifted the production of the C-terminal fragments from C83 (generated by α-secretase cleavage) to the C99 fragment (generated by β-secretase cleavage). This shift was especially pronounced in CHO cells, which produced little or no C99 after expression of APPwt. A similar though less dramatic effect on C99 production was observed in NT2N cells after APPΔNL expression, again indicating that processing by β-secretase(s) is increased in NT2N cells expressing APPΔNL. Thus, the ΔNL mutation leads to increased processing of APP by β-secretase(s) in both neuronal and nonneuronal cells.The increased processing by β-secretase(s) observed in all cell types after APPΔNL expression could be the result of several factors. At present, at least three different β-secretase processing pathways have been reported. The endosomal/lysosomal pathway, which processes APP after re-internalization from the cell surface into endosomes and lysosomes, is the most ubiquitous since both neurons and nonneuronal cells utilize this pathway to produce Aβ. However, the contribution of this pathway to the overall production of Aβ is relatively minor since nonneuronal cells transfected with APPwt produce mostly p3 and very little Aβ (15Haass C. Koo E.H. Mello A. Hung A.Y. Selkoe D.J. Nature. 1992; 357: 500-503Crossref PubMed Scopus (768) Google Scholar, 20Thinakaran G. Teplow D.B. Siman R. Greenberg B. Sisodia S.S. J. Biol.

Chem. 1995; 270: 3565-3573Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). In addition, it is unlikely that APPΔNL expression increases Aβ production via this pathway, since the expression of an APPΔNL construct lacking the cytoplasmic tail, which eliminates re-internalization of cell surface APPΔNL, does not reduce Aβ secretion (31Haass C. Lemere C.A. Capell A. Citron M. Seubert P. Schenk D. Lannfelt L. Selkoe D.J. Nat. Med. 1995; 1: 1291-1296Crossref PubMed Scopus (437) Google Scholar, 49Essalmani R. Macq A.-F. Mercken L. Octave J.-N. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 218: 89-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). A second β-secretory pathway, active primarily in Golgi-derived vesicles, is more likely to process APPΔNL (31Haass C. Lemere C.A. Capell A. Citron M. Seubert P. Schenk D. Lannfelt L. Selkoe D.J. Nat. Med. 1995; 1: 1291-1296Crossref PubMed Scopus (437) Google Scholar). Previous studies have suggested that nonneuronal cells utilize this pathway at the expense of the α-secretory pathway when APPΔNL is expressed (31Haass C. Lemere C.A. Capell A. Citron M. Seubert P. Schenk D. Lannfelt L. Selkoe D.J. Nat. Med. 1995; 1: 1291-1296Crossref PubMed Scopus (437) Google Scholar). However, it is unclear whether Aβ-(1–40) and Aβ-(1–42) are both produced by this route, since a recently identified β-secretory pathway localized to the ER/IC results in exclusive production of Aβ-(1–42) (25Cook D.G. Forman M.S. Sung J.C. Leight S. Kolson D.L. Iwatsubo T. Lee V.M.-Y. Doms R.W. Nat. Med. 1997; 3: 1021-1023Crossref PubMed Scopus (424) Google Scholar, 26Wild-Bode C. Tamazaki T. Capell A. Leimer U. Steiner H. Ihara Y. Haass C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 16085-16088Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar). Since the secretion of both Aβ-(1–40) and Aβ-(1–42) is elevated in nonneuronal cells expressing APPΔNL, it is possible that both the Golgi-associated and the ER β-secretase pathways are affected by this mutation. Alternatively, it is possible that both Aβ-(1–40) and Aβ-(1–42) can be produced by Golgi-derived vesicles and that the ΔNL mutation only affects this pathway selectively.The increased processing of APPΔNL by the β-secretase pathway in all cells tested coupled with markedly increased levels of Aβ production in all cells except NT2N neurons suggests that γ-secretase processing may be rate-limiting for Aβ production in NT2N cells by one of several mechanisms. For example, C99 may be more rapidly degraded in NT2N cells than in nonneuronal cells, precluding or minimizing the possibility of γ-secretase cleavage of C99 and concomitant Aβ production. However, if this were true, we would not expect the observed increase in the C99 fragment after APPΔNL expression in NT2N cells. Another possibility is that the high levels of expression resulting from the SFV vector system saturates the γ-secretase. However, we found no difference in Aβ levels between NT2N cells expressing APPwt or APPΔNL at early time points when APP expression levels were low. In addition, De Strooper et al.(43De Strooper B.D. Simons M. Multhaup G. Leuven F.V. Beyreuther K. Dotti C.G. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 4932-4938Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar) found that expression of APPΔNL in rat hippocampal neurons caused only a 2-fold increase in Aβ levels relative to APPwt as judged by immunoprecipitation. Although larger than the increase we observed in this study using a more quantitative ELISA approach, the increase in Aβ was still significantly less than the 5–10-fold increase observed in nonneuronal cells. Finally, the intracellular processing pathways utilized by the NT2N cells may be distinct from that of the nonneuronal cells (12Sisodia S.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Med. 1997; 3: 1021-1023Crossref PubMed Scopus (424) Google Scholar). Thus, the possibility exists that the γ-secretase did not have access to the carboxyl-terminal fragments generated when APPΔNL was expressed. Identification of the γ-secretase(s) will help distinguish these possibilities.Several studies suggest that the cellular source of Aβ deposition in senile plaques in nonfamilial cases of AD is the neuron (50Cras P.

Our data supports this hypothesis because only neuronal cells constitutively generate Aβ. This production of Aβ is accompanied by the generation of intracellular APPβ and C99 in NT2N cells. By contrast, intracellular APPβ and C99 were absent from nonneuronal cells expressing APPwt. This suggests that commitment to neuronal differentiation results in the acquisition of the ability to utilize the β pathway of APP processing, a necessary prerequisite for Aβ production. However, expression of APPΔNL led to markedly increased production of Aβ, APPβ, and C99 in nonneuronal cells, indicating that the Swedish ΔNL mutation alters APP processing in nonneuronal cells such that APP is now processed in a more “neuronal” fashion. NT2N cells may not exhibit such marked alterations in APP and Aβ metabolism after APPΔNL expression, because they are already committed to processing APP in pathways that favor increased production of both intracellular and secreted Aβ. The relatively modest effects of this mutation on Aβ production in NT2N neurons raises the question as to what role neurons play in elevating Aβ levels in individuals with the ΔNL mutation. It is possible that in such individuals cell types other than neurons, such as astrocytes, may significantly contribute to the marked increases in central nervous system Aβ levels and the formation of senile plaques.

The expression of heterologous proteins as fusions to ubiquitin in either prokaryotic or eukaryotic hosts often dramatically enhances their yield, and allows the exposure of any amino acid following cleavage of ubiquitin. The single exception is when proline is the amino acid immediately following ubiquitin; the ubiquitin-proline bond is poorly cleaved by presently studied ubiquitin-specific proteases.

N-terminal sequencing of the cleavage products reveals that cleavage occurs precisely at the ubiquitin-proline junction. The biological significance of this cleavage activity is unclear, as ubiquitin-proline fusions do not occur naturally. However, it may indicate a different catalytic mechanism for these ubiquitin-specific proteases and/or that they can cleave ubiquitin-like proteins.

Yeast also contains an additional ubiquitin-cleaving enzyme termed Yuh1p (12Miller H.I. Henzel W.J. Ridgway J.B. Kuang W.-J. Chisolm V. Liu C.-C. BioTechnology. 1989; 7: 698-704Crossref Scopus (55) Google Scholar), which is unrelated to the Ubp family by sequence, and which has several homologs in mammals (13Wilkinson K.D. Lee K. Deshpande S.

The presence of such a large family of Ubp enzymes in yeast is not required merely to cleave ubiquitin precursors, and is indicative of other regulatory roles in the ubiquitin pathway. The unusual ubiquitin fusion structure, and the ability of Ubps to cleave the ubiquitin moiety, have been exploited in several ways. The relative insensitivity of Ubp-mediated cleavage to the amino acid residue immediately following ubiquitin allows the synthesis of a protein with any residue at its N terminus. This technique was used to generate of a set of otherwise identical β-galactosidase (β-gal) proteins that differed only at their N-terminal residue, and subsequently led to the discovery of the N-end rule: the relationship between the half-life of a protein and the identity of its N-terminal residue (15Bachmair A.

One limitation observed during these experiments was that the ubiquitin-proline bond was cleaved very inefficiently, either in yeast or in mammalian cells (rabbit reticulocyte extract), presumably due to the unusual structure of proline. The rate of cleavage was estimated to be 20 times slower than all other ubiquitin-β-gal fusions (17Gonda D.K. Bachmair A. Wünning I. Tobias J.W. Lane W.S. Varshavsky A. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 16700-16712Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, the presence of the uncleaved ubiquitin moiety in a ubiquitin-proline-β-gal (Ub-P-β-gal) fusion in yeast, or an “uncleavable” Ub-β-gal fusion engineered by mutation of the Ubp cleavage site, actually targeted the fusion protein for degradation via ubiquitin-dependent proteolysis (19Johnson E.S. Bartel B. Seufert W. Varshavsky A. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 497-505Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar, 20Johnson E.S. Ma P.C.M. Ota I.M. Varshavsky A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 17442-17456Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (679) Google Scholar). Thus uncleaved ubiquitin fusions are recognized as abnormal proteins and rapidly degraded. The second feature of ubiquitin fusions is that they enhance (often dramatically) the yield of the protein to which ubiquitin is fused. This phenomenon was initially observed in yeast, where the natural ubiquitin-ribosomal protein fusion structure was found to enhance the yield of the ribosomal protein (21Finley D. Bartel B. Varshavsky A. Nature. 1989; 338: 394-401Crossref PubMed Scopus (556) Google Scholar). Ubiquitin fusions have since been used to improve the yield of recombinant proteins in bacteria, yeast, and insect cells (reviewed in Ref. 22Baker R.T. Curr. Opin. Biotechnol. 1996; 7: 541-546Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). That the yield enhancement occurs in bacteria, which lack ubiquitin and Ubp enzymes, indicates that this property is intrinsic to ubiquitin, and has been proposed to be due to a covalent chaperone effect of ubiquitin in allowing the fusion partner to fold and/or protect it from degradation (21Finley D. Bartel B. Varshavsky A. Nature. 1989; 338: 394-401Crossref PubMed Scopus (556) Google Scholar). The yield enhancement also occurs when a Ubp is co-expressed in bacteria with the fusion protein, which is rapidly cleaved co-translationally, indicating that the protective effect of ubiquitin is exerted in the small period of time that the fusion is intact (23Baker R.T. Smith S.A. Marano R. McKee J. Board P.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 25381-25386Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We have recently been studying a mouse protein termed Unp, that is an oncoprotein and causes tumors when overexpressed in nude mice (24Gupta K. Copeland N.G. Gilbert D.J. Jenkins N.A. Gray D.A. Oncogene. 1993; 8: 2307-2310PubMed Google Scholar, 25Gupta K. Chevrette M. Gray D.A. Oncogene. 1994; 9: 1729-1731PubMed Google Scholar). Unp, and also its human homolog Unph, both contain the conserved Ubp domains identified in the yeast Ubp family (5Baker R.T. Tobias J.W. Varshavsky A. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 23364-23375Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and thus are potential Ubps (6Papa F. Hochstrasser M. Nature. 1993; 366: 313-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar, 26Gray D.A. Inazawa J. Gupta K. Wong A. Ueda R. Takahashi T. Oncogene. 1995; 10: 2179-2183PubMed Google Scholar). During the characterization of the Ubp activity of Unp and Unph expressed in yeast and bacteria, we noted that it exhibited significant cleavage activity of the ubiquitin-proline bond. In this report, we characterize this novel cleavage activity. Escherichia coli was cultured and transformed with plasmids according to standard procedures (27Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Clones containing Unp and Unph cDNAs have been described previously (24Gupta K. Copeland N.G. Gilbert D.J. Jenkins N.A. Gray D.A. Oncogene. 1993; 8: 2307-2310PubMed Google Scholar, 26Gray D.A. Inazawa J. Gupta K. Wong A. Ueda R. Takahashi T. Oncogene. 1995; 10: 2179-2183PubMed Google Scholar). The 5′ portion of the Unp open reading frame from the initiation codon to the internal XbaI site was amplified by the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using oligonucleotides UNPDAG (5′-d(CTCGAATTCGAGATGGCGGAAGG)) and UNPXBA (5′-d(GGCTTCTTCTTTACGCGGTTCAG)). The product was digested with EcoRI and XbaI, ligated into pBluescript, and the insert of one clone was sequenced (ThermoSequenase kit, Amersham Corp.) in full to reveal no PCR errors. This fragment and the remainder of the Unp clone 3′ of the XbaI site were ligated into the bacterial expression plasmid pKK261 (a derivative of pKK223-3) (23Baker R.T. Smith S.A. Marano R. McKee J. Board P.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 25381-25386Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) to reconstruct the Unp open reading frame under control of the tac promoter (28Brosius J. Lupsky J.R. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 153: 54-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar), yielding plasmid pCG53. An analogous procedure was used to amplify and reconstruct Unph from a human Unph cDNA clone. Plasmids pCG43 and pCG42 were also initially constructed by analogous procedures, that expressed truncated Unp and Unph proteins, lacking residues 1–168 (UnpΔ1–168) and 1–55 (UnphΔ1–55), respectively. These truncated proteins were derived from deduced incomplete open reading frames due to sequencing errors in the original Unp and Unph sequencing reports (24Gupta K. Copeland N.G. Gilbert D.J. Jenkins N.A. Gray D.A. Oncogene. 1993; 8: 2307-2310PubMed Google Scholar, 26Gray D.A. Inazawa J. Gupta K. Wong A. Ueda R. Takahashi T. Oncogene. 1995; 10: 2179-2183PubMed Google Scholar).

L00681 (Unp) and U20657 (Unph). Plasmids expressing Ubp1p (pJT70), Ubp2p (pRB105, pRB173), Ubp3p (pRB143, pRB175), and Yuh1p (pKKYUH1) have been described previously (4Tobias J.W. Varshavsky A. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 12021-12028Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 5Baker R.T. Tobias J.W. Varshavsky A. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 23364-23375Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A plasmid for the expression of Unp in yeast was constructed by ligation of the EcoRI-HindIII fragment from pCG53 downstream of the constitutive ADH1 promoter (29Ammerer G. Methods Enzymol. 1983; 101: 192-201Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar) in the high copy vector YEplac181 (30Gietz R.D. Sugino A. Gene (Amst.). 1988; 74: 527-534Crossref PubMed Scopus (2514) Google Scholar). Plasmid pUb23-P expresses a Ub-P-β-gal fusion protein from a hybrid CYC-GAL10 promoter on a yeast high copy plasmid (15Bachmair A. Finley D. Varshavsky A. Science. 1986; 234: 179-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (1372) Google Scholar). We have previously described a pKK223-3-based plasmid, pRB269, containing a single ubiquitin-coding region that contains a SacII site at the 3′ end of ubiquitin to enable ligation of other gene fragments (5Baker R.T. Tobias J.W. Varshavsky A. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 23364-23375Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A ubiquitin-proline-GSTP1 fusion (Ub-P-GSTP1) was constructed in pRB269 analogously to the ubiquitin-methionine-GSTP1 fusion described previously (5Baker R.T. Tobias J.W. Varshavsky A. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 23364-23375Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The wild-type mature N terminus of human GSTP1 (Pro-Pro-Tyr) was mutated to Pro-Ala-Tyr, and a SacII restriction site added, using the forward primer UBPGST (5′-d(GTGCCGCGGTGGTCCGGCGTATACCGTGG)), the reverse primer 3EX2 (5′-d(CTTAAGCTTCCCTCACTGTTTCCCG) (5Baker R.T. Tobias J.W. Varshavsky A. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 23364-23375Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), a GSTP1 cDNA clone (5Baker R.T. Tobias J.W. Varshavsky A. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 23364-23375Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and the PCR. The PCR product was digested with SacII and HindIII, ligated into pBluescript, sequenced in full to reveal no PCR errors, and ligated into pRB269 digested with SacII and HindIII to yield pRB481. For coexpression of Ub-P-GSTP1 in E. coli with a Ubp-expressing plasmid, the tac promoter/Ub-P-GSTP1-rrnB terminator region of pRB481 was excised with EagI and ScaI, and ligated into pACYC184 digested with EagI and EcoRV to yield pRB486. The cysteine residue of Unp that lies within the conserved Ubp Cys domain (C311) was mutated to alanine using the oligonucleotide UNPCA (5′-d(CAGAGTTCATAAAGGCAGTGTTCCCC), an M13 subclone of the Unp 5′EcoRI-XbaI fragment, and a dut ungmutagenesis kit (Bio-Rad). This oligonucleotide also destroys an RcaI (BspHI) site in this region. Mutagenized clones were screened by RcaI digestion, and then sequenced to confirm the correct mutation. The EcoRI-XbaI fragment containing the C311A mutation was used to replace the corresponding wild-type fragment in pCG53 to yield pCG54, which expresses UnpC311A. Cleavage of Ub-P-β-gal fusions in yeast was assayed by pulse-labeling with [35S]methionine, extraction, immunoprecipitation with a monoclonal antibody to β-gal (Promega), electrophoresis in a 6% SDS-polyacrylamide gel (31Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207002) Google Scholar), and fluorography exactly as described elsewhere (32Baker R.T. Varshavsky A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 1090-1094Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). For in vitro cleavage assays, Ub-P-β-gal was immunoprecipitated from yeast cells containing plasmid pUB23-P, the protein A-agarose pellet washed with TN buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl) to remove SDS, and portions of the resuspended pellet slurry were mixed with extracts of E. coli expressing different Ubps. Where required, β-gal protein-containing bands were excised from dried gels, and the amount of 35S in the bands was determined. Bacterial extracts were prepared from exponentially growing cultures that had been induced with 1 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside for 3 h. Cells from 1.5-ml cultures were collected, resuspended in 0.2 ml of TN buffer containing 1 mm dithiothreitol and 0.25 mg lysozyme/ml, incubated on ice 10 min, sonicated for two 5-s bursts, and centrifuged for 5 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was collected as the soluble extract. Assays consisted of mixing an extract containing a Ubp (usually 15 μl) with an extract containing the substrate (5 μl) and incubating at 37 °C for 60 min. An antiserum against Ub-M-GSTP1 was raised in rabbits using purified Ub-M-GSTP1 (23Baker R.T. Smith S.A. Marano R. McKee J. Board P.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 25381-25386Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This antisera was used at 1:1000 dilution against immunoblots of cleavage reactions involving Ub-P-GSTP1 resolved in a 12.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gel. Where required, GSTP1-containing proteins were purified by affinity chromatography on GSH-agarose (Sigma) exactly as described previously (23Baker R.T. Smith S.A. Marano R. McKee J. Board P.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 25381-25386Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Protein sequencing was done at the Biomolecular Resource Facility, Australian National University. Unp and Unph are mouse and human proteins, respectively, that contain conserved sequence motifs originally identified in the yeast ubiquitin-specific proteases Ubp1p, Ubp2p, and Ubp3p (5Baker R.T. Tobias J.W. Varshavsky A. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 23364-23375Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 6Papa F. Hochstrasser M. Nature. 1993; 366: 313-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar, 24Gupta K. Copeland N.G. Gilbert D.J. Jenkins N.A. Gray D.A. Oncogene. 1993; 8: 2307-2310PubMed Google Scholar, 26Gray D.A. Inazawa J. Gupta K. Wong A. Ueda R. Takahashi T. Oncogene. 1995; 10: 2179-2183PubMed Google Scholar). These domains contain a conserved cysteine residue, and two histidine residues, respectively, that presumably form part of the active site of these thiol proteases (5Baker R.T. Tobias J.W. Varshavsky A. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 23364-23375Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) (Fig. 1). Mutation of the corresponding cysteine and/or histidine residues in both the yeast Doa4p(Ubp4p),Drosophila fat facets Ubp, and yeast Ubp2p abolish their Ubp activity (6Papa F. Hochstrasser M. Nature. 1993; 366: 313-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar, 10Huang Y. Baker R.T. Fischer-Vize J. Science. 1995; 270: 1828-1831Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar).2 To confirm that the presence of these conserved domains in Unp and Unph correlates with Ubp activity, we expressed these enzymes in E. coli and assayed crude extracts for Ubp activity against an artificial linear ubiquitin-GST fusion protein that has a methionine residue immediately following ubiquitin (UbMGSTP1) (23Baker R.T. Smith S.A. Marano R. McKee J. Board P.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 25381-25386Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). While E. coli extracts alone exhibit no cleavage of the Ub-M-GSTP1 fusion protein, extracts containing either Unp or Unph cleaved a substantial proportion of this ubiquitin-fusion protein, demonstrating that they are bona fide Ubps (data not shown). Furthermore, mutation of the conserved cysteine residue in Unp to alanine (UnpC311A) abolished this cleavage activity (data not shown; see below), consistent with a role for this residue in the active site of the enzyme. A full characterization of the Ubp activity of Unp and Unph will be presented elsewhere. 4C. A. Gilchrist, P. Blanchette, D. A. Gray, and R. T. Baker, manuscript in preparation. Ubiquitin-X-β-galactosidase (Ub-X-β-gal) fusion proteins have been routinely used as model substrates of ubiquitin-dependent proteolysis in yeast (e.g. see Refs. 15Bachmair A. Finley D. Varshavsky A. Science. 1986; 234: 179-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (1372) Google Scholar, 19Johnson E.S. Bartel B. Seufert W. Varshavsky A. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 497-505Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar, 20Johnson E.S. Ma P.C.M. Ota I.M. Varshavsky A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 17442-17456Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (679) Google Scholar, and 32Baker R.T. Varshavsky A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 1090-1094Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). During initial experiments where Unp was coexpressed in yeast with Ub-P-β-gal to ascertain any effect of Unp on ubiquitin-dependent proteolysis, we noticed that substantially more cleavage of the ubiquitin-proline bond occurred in cells containing Unp than those without. This effect was further quantitated in a pulse-chase assay (Fig. 2 A). In the presence of Unp, substantially more of the P-β-gal species is present at the zero time point than in control cells (compare lanes 1 and 4). The P-β-gal thus produced is a stable protein, in agreement with the N-end rule (15Bachmair A. Finley D. Varshavsky A. Science. 1986; 234: 179-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (1372) Google Scholar), and is not degraded over the 30-min chase. Unp does not have an isopeptidase activity in these experiments, in that the multiubiquitin chain assembled on Ub-P-β-gal (33Chau V. Tobias J.W. Bachmair A. Marriott D. Ecker D. Gonda D.K. Varshavsky A. Science. 1989; 243: 1576-1583Crossref PubMed Scopus (1116) Google Scholar) is not affected by the presence of Unp (Fig. 2 A). One explanation for the apparent enhanced cleavage at the ubiquitin-proline bond is that Unp may have a relaxed or degenerate cleavage specificity, and may be cleaving at an incorrect site other than the predicted glycine-proline junction. To test this, we used a Ub-X-β-gal fusion protein, UbV76-V-β-gal, where the Gly76 residue of ubiquitin had been mutated to valine, and the X residue was also valine. This mutation prevents cleavage by all known yeast Ubp enzymes, because when this fusion is expressed in yeast, no ubiquitin cleavage is observed, and the intact fusion is targeted for ubiquitin-dependent degradation via a pathway that recognizes noncleavable ubiquitin fusions (19Johnson E.S. Bartel B. Seufert W. Varshavsky A. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 497-505Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar, 20Johnson E.S. Ma P.C.M. Ota I.M. Varshavsky A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 17442-17456Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (679) Google Scholar). Yuh1p, a different yeast ubiquitin-specific protease, is also unable to cleave the ubiquitin-proline bond in Ub-P-β-gal fusions (12Miller H.I. Henzel W.J. Ridgway J.B. Kuang W.-J. Chisolm V. Liu C.-C. BioTechnology. 1989; 7: 698-704Crossref Scopus (55) Google Scholar). The presence of Unp did not result in any cleavage of this G76V mutant (Fig. 2 A), indicating that Unp also requires the Gly76 residue for cleavage, and does not appear to have a relaxed cleavage site specificity. To test whether Unp was capable of cleaving Ub-P-β-gal only when co-expressed with it in vivo, we performed an in vitro cleavage assay, whereby Ub-P-β-gal was immunoprecipitated from yeast cells grown with [35S]methionine and then incubated with extracts of E. coli expressing different Ubps. As shown in Fig. 2 B, an E. coli extract alone had no effect on Ub-P-β-gal, whereas extracts containing Unp resulted in 63% of the Ub-P-β-gal-containing species (including the multiubiquitinated species) being converted to P-β-gal (lane 5). In wild-type yeast, only 9% of the 35S in β-gal-containing species was present as P-β-gal (lane 1). Given that Unp does not have an isopeptidase activity (see above), it appears to be able to cleave the ubiquitin-proline bond even when a large multiubiquitin chain is attached to the ubiquitin moiety. The yeast Ubps Ubp1p (lane 3), Ubp2p (lane 4), or Ubp3p (not shown) were not able to cleave the ubiquitin-proline bond in this assay, consistent with the poor cleavage of Ub-P-β-gal in yeast, and indicative of the unique cleavage specificity of Unp. (The Ubp1p and Ubp2p extracts used here were able to cleave a Ub-M-GSTP1 fusion protein in vitro (data not shown) (5Baker R.T. Tobias J.W. Varshavsky A. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 23364-23375Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Ubp3p does not appear to have Ubp activity in vitro (5Baker R.T. Tobias J.W. Varshavsky A. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 23364-23375Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).) Notably, this assay revealed that Ubp1p has an apparent isopeptidase activity, in that it removed the bulk of the high molecular weight ubiquitin conjugates on Ub-P-β-gal (lane 3). This activity is being further investigated. We have previously used the ubiquitin fusion technique to express human glutathione S-transferase GSTP1 (23Baker R.T. Smith S.A. Marano R. McKee J. Board P.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 25381-25386Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). While the mature N terminus of GSTP1 is proline, we were unable to use the ubiquitin fusion technique to expose proline at the N terminus of GSTP1 due to the poor efficiency of cleavage at this bond by known Ubps, and so retained the initiator methionine codon in the fusion (23Baker R.T. Smith S.A. Marano R. McKee J. Board P.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 25381-25386Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Given the ability of Unp to cleave this bond in Ub-P-β-gal, we constructed a Ub-P-GSTP1 fusion and tested its cleavage with Unp and Unph (see “Experimental Procedures”). For the purposes of this experiment, we mutated the wild type N terminus of GSTP1 (Pro-Pro-Tyr) (34Ålin P. Mannervik B. Jörnvall H. FEBS Lett. 1985; 182: 319-322Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 35Suzuki T. Coggan M. Shaw D.C. Board P.G. Ann. Hum. Genet. 1987; 51: 95-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar) to Pro-Ala-Tyr, so that the subsequent N-terminal sequencing to determine the cleavage site would not be ambiguous. To assay in vivo cleavage of Ub-P-GSTP1, various Ubps were co-expressed in E. coli with Ub-P-GSTP1, cell extracts were resolved by SDS-PAGE, and an immunoblot was performed with a rabbit antiserum raised against purified Ub-M-GSTP1 (23Baker R.T. Smith S.A. Marano R. McKee J. Board P.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 25381-25386Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This antiserum detects uncleaved Ub-P-GSTP1, P-GSTP1, and (weakly) free ubiquitin. As shown in Fig. 3 A, approximately 40% of the Ub-P-GSTP1 fusion was cleaved when co-expressed with full-length Unp (lane 8), while the truncated Unp (UnpΔ1–168) and Unph (UnphΔ1–55) enzymes also exhibited substantial cleavage (lanes 5 and 6). However, no detectable cleavage occurred with either Ubp1p (lane 2), Ubp2p (lane 3), Ubp3p (lane 4), or notably with the UnpC311A mutant (lane 9). To assay in vitro cleavage of Ub-P-GSTP1, extracts of E. coli expressing Ub-P-GSTP1 were mixed with extracts of E. coli expressing different Ubps, and following incubation at 37 °C for 1 h, electrophoresis and immunodetection were performed as above. Similar results to the in vivo cleavage assays were observed (Fig. 3 B), with full-length Unp cleaving approximately 40% of Ub-P-GSTP1 (lane 4), while the truncated Unp and Unph enzymes exhibited partial activity (lanes 6 and 7). No detectable cleavage was observed with either Yuh1p (lanes 8 and 9), Ubp1p (lane 2), Ubp2p (lane 3), or E. coliextract (lane 1). Each of these extracts (except for Yuh1p) exhibited cleavage activity against a Ub-M-GSTP1 fusion protein (data not shown). Notably, the UnpC311A mutant was again devoid of activity (lane 5). To determine the fidelity of Unp and Unph-mediated cleavage of the ubiquitin-proline bond, the GSTP1-containing proteins arising from scaled-up cleavage reactions of UnpΔ1–168 cleavage of Ub-P-GSTP1in vivo (Fig. 3 A, lane 5), UnphΔ1–55 cleavage of Ub-P-GSTP1 in vivo (Fig.3 A, lane 6), and full-length Unp cleavage of Ub-P-GSTP1 in vitro (Fig. 3 B, lane 4) were purified by glutathione affinity chromatography on GSH-agarose, eluted with 5 mm GSH, and resolved by SDS-PAGE. A representative purification is shown in Fig.4 (full-length Unp cleavage of Ub-P-GSTP1in vitro). The Coomassie-stained P-GSTP1-sized bands were excised from the gel (Fig. 4, lanes 5 and 6), eluted onto a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane, and subjected to six cycles of automated N-terminal sequence analysis on a Applied Biosystems 494 Procise. The sequences obtained are listed in TableI. In all three cases, proline was the only residue detected at the N terminus, and the sequence obtained matched the expected sequence exactly. Neither glycine nor alanine was observed in the first cycle, which would be expected if cleavage had occurred either one residue N-terminal or C-terminal, respectively, of the glycine-proline bond. From this analysis, we conclude that at least 95% of the cleavage had occurred at the glycine-proline bond. Thus in contrast to other Ubps, Unp and its human homolog Unph exhibit very efficient and precise cleavage of the ubiquitin-proline bond in ubiquitin fusion proteins.Table IN-terminal sequencing of Unp and Unph cleavage products P4 P3 P2 P1 P1′ P2′ P3′ P4′ P5′ P6′Leu-Arg-Gly-Gly ↓ Pro-Ala-Tyr-Thr-Val-Val 73 74 75 76UbpCleavage*Observed sequenceUnpΔ1–168In vivoPro-Ala-Tyr-Thr-Val-ValUnphΔ1–55In vivoPro-Ala-Tyr-Thr-Val-ValUnpIn vitroPro-Ala-Tyr-Thr-Val-Val* Cleavage occurred either in vivo (co-expression of Ub-P-GSTP1 and Ubp in E. coli) or in vitro(mixing of an extract of E. coli expressing Ub-P-GSTP1 and an extract of E. coli expressing Unp).

The ubiquitin-fusion technique has proven to be a versatile method of increasing the yield of recombinant protein expression, and as a way of synthesizing proteins with any desired N terminus, both for biotechnological and research applications (reviewed in Ref. 22Baker R.T. Curr. Opin. Biotechnol. 1996; 7: 541-546Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). One limitation in this technique has been the extremely inefficient cleavage of the ubiquitin-proline bond, and thus proteins with an N-terminal proline residue have been excluded. For example, the status of N-terminal proline in the E. coli N-end rule has not been determined due to the inability of Ubp1p to deubiquitinate Ub-P-β-gal (36Tobias J.W. Shrader T.E. Rocap G.

Our demonstration that the mouse Ubp enzyme Unp, and its human homolog Unph, can efficiently and precisely cleave the ubiquitin-proline bond either in vitro or in vivo, allows circumvention of this problem, and improves the versatility of the ubiquitin fusion technique. Unp and Unph exhibit this activity irrespective of the size of the fusion partner (1045 residues in Ub-P-β-gal, 209 residues in Ub-P-GSTP1), and do not appear to be affected by the residue immediately following proline in the P-2′ position (His in Ub-P-β-gal, Ala in Ub-P-GSTP1). This activity is unique to Unp and Unph among known Ubps; cleavage of Ub-P-β-gal by Ubps present in yeast or in rabbit reticulocyte extract is very inefficient (15Bachmair A. Finley D. Varshavsky A. Science. 1986; 234: 179-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (1372) Google Scholar, 17Gonda D.K. Bachmair A. Wünning I. Tobias J.W. Lane W.S. Varshavsky A. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 16700-16712Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and recombinant yeast Ubps Ubp1p, Ubp2p, Ubp3p, and Yuh1p lack this activity (see “Results”). In addition, recombinant yeast Ubps Doa4p/Ubp4p, Ubp6p, Ubp12p, and Ubp15p cannot cleave the ubiquitin-proline bond (data not shown). Ubp12p is the most closely related yeast Ubp to Unp and Unph, and its inability to cleave this bond implies that yeast lack an efficient functional homolog of Unp/Unph with respect to ubiquitin-proline bond cleavage. While proline is only one of the 20 amino acids that may occur at the N terminus of a protein or peptide, several important proteins do have an N-terminal proline residue, including GSTP1, which is strongly induced in early stages of hepatocarcinogenesis in rats (reviewed in Hayes and Pulford (37Hayes J.D. Pulford D.J. Crit. Rev. Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1995; 30: 445-600Crossref PubMed Scopus (3245) Google Scholar)). Several biologically active peptides also have an N-terminal proline, such as angiogenesis inhibitor platelet factor 4 (38Maione T.E. Gray G.S. Petro J. Hunt A.J. Donner A.L. Bauer S.I. Carson H.F. Sharpe R.J. Science. 1990; 247: 77-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (625) Google Scholar), basic fibroblast growth factor (39Abraham J.A. Whong J.L. Tumolo A. Mergia A. Friedman J. Gospodarowicz D.

Pharmacol. 1993; 109: 902-904Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar). While organic synthesis is efficient for the production of short peptides in vitro, the ubiquitin fusion technique provides an efficient alternative for the synthesis of peptides of any length in vivo (43Yoo Y. Rote K. Rechsteiner M. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 17078-17083Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and the ability of Unp and Unph to cleave the ubiquitin-proline bond enhances this technique. Although the ability of Unp and Unph to cleave the ubiquitin-proline bond is a versatile research and biotechnology tool, the biological significance of this cleavage activity is unclear, as no natural ubiquitin fusions containing the ubiquitin-proline bond have been observed. It is likely that this cleavage activity reflects a unique property of Unp and Unph, in that they can access and cleave the C terminus of ubiquitin in fusions that other Ubps cannot. Presumably this reflects the structure of the natural substrate(s) of Unp/Unph, which may require a special catalytic mechanism of the Ubp that cleaves them. The unique structure of proline, with the side chain cyclized onto the backbone nitrogen atom, may sterically shield the bond to be cleaved from all Ubps other than Unp/Unph. It is also possible that Unp may cleave some or all of the ubiquitin-like proteins that are processed from linear precursors and/or post-translationally formed conjugates, such as the ubiquitin-like protein fused to ribosomal protein S30 (44Baker R.T. Williamson N.A. Wettenhall R.E.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 13549-13555Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar) that is apparently conjugated to an immune suppressor factor (45Nakamura M. Xavier R.M. Tsunematsu T. Tanigawa Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 3463-3467Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar), and the small ubiquitin-like modification (SUMO) of the Ran-GTPase-activating protein (46Matunis M.J. Coutavas E. Blobel G. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 1457-1470Crossref PubMed Scopus (955) Google Scholar, 47Mahajan R. Delphin C. Guan T. Gerace L. Melchior F. Cell. 1997; 88: 97-107Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1003) Google Scholar). An ability to cleave ubiquitin-like proteins may signify a “relaxed” active site conformation, which may be able to tolerate the proline residue, whereas other Ubps cannot. In this respect, we note that both Unp and Unph have a glycine positioned six residues on the N-terminal side of the active site cysteine within the conserved Cys domain, whereas no other known Ubp from any species has a glycine in this position, having instead much bulkier residues (Fig. 1 B) (8Hochstrasser M. Annu. Rev. Genet. 1996; 30: 405-439Crossref PubMed Scopus (1458) Google Scholar) (data not shown). Although we have no information on the structure that this domain adopts, the small glycine residue may allow toleration of the proline residue in the P-1′ position. One testable prediction of this model is that mutation of this Unp/Unph glycine to a non-glycine residue should greatly reduce its ability to cleave the ubiquitin-proline bond. It is also noteworthy that in any ubiquitin-fusion where the P-1′ residue is not proline, be it a linear fusion or an isopeptide linkage, there is a proton on the nitrogen atom of the P-1′ residue, whereas when the P-1′ residue is proline, this proton is absent. It is possible that this proton is required for the catalytic mechanism of most Ubps, which cleave very inefficiently if this proton is absent, and that Unp and Unph have an alternate mechanism and/or can utilize a different proton, and thus can cleave fusions where proline is in the P-1′ position. In the model thiol protease papain, it has been proposed that the NH of the P-1′ leaving group is involved in hydrogen bonding with a carbonyl group of the papain peptide backbone, to aid in distortion of the scissile C–N bond to increase its electrophilicity and thus facilitate attack by the thiol group (48Lowe G. Yuthavong Y. Biochem. J. 1971; 124: 107-115Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). The nitrogen of the P-1′ leaving group also has a role in the breakdown of the tetrahedral intermediate linking papain to its substrate, becoming protonated in the transition state (49Lowe G. Yuthavong Y. Biochem. J. 1971; 124: 117-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). If the Ubps operate by an analogous mechanism, then the unusual structure of proline in the P-1′ position may not allow either of these roles to operate. In either case, it would appear that Unp and Unph have a different catalytic mechanism than other Ubps. The exploitation of this mechanism to cleave the ubiquitin-proline bond should prove fruitful for both biotechnology and research applications.

Johnson A.L. Johnston L.H. Morrison A. Sugino A. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 733-740Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar, 8Budd M.E. Campbell J.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 2173-2179Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar); however, the yeast enzyme also appears exclusively to be required for base excision repair synthesis in vitro (9Wang Z. Wu X. Friedberg E.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 1051-1058Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). (In human cells, pol β plays the predominant role in base excision repair.) Furthermore, yeast pol ε has been proposed to exert an S-phase checkpoint function by sensing DNA replication blocks and DNA damage (10Navas T.A. Zhou Z. Elledge S.J. Cell. 1995; 80: 29-39Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (370) Google Scholar). Pol ε has also been implicated in DNA replication. In yeast, pol ε is required for cellular viability, and at restrictive temperatures, pol ε temperature-sensitive mutants are defective in chromosomal replication and exhibit the dumbbell terminal morphology typical of DNA replication mutants (4Morrison A. Araki H. Clark A.B. Hamatake R.K. Sugino A. Cell. 1990; 62: 1143-1151Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar). Mammalian pol ε has also been reported to be essential for chromosomal DNA replication (11Zlotkin T. Kaufmann G. Jiang Y. Lee M.Y. Syväoja J. Dornreiter I. Fanning E. Nethanel T. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 2298-2305Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar), although it is dispensable for SV-40 DNA replication (12Weinberg D.H. Kelly T.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

For both DNA repair and replication processes, however, the precise role of pol ε has not yet been defined. Extensively purified HeLa pol ε consists of a catalytic subunit of 261 kDa and a tightly bound small subunit with a relative molecular mass of 55 kDa (1Syväoja J. Linn S. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 2489-2497Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). S. cerevisiae pol ε has a catalytic subunit of 256 kDa with 39% peptide sequence identity to the HeLa pol ε catalytic subunit (2Kesti T. Frantti H. Syväoja J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 10238-10245Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), but it has two well defined accessory proteins of molecular masses 79,461 (DPB2) and 23,005 (DPB3). (The latter has two isoforms which migrate during denaturing PAGE to positions corresponding to molecular masses of 34,000 and 30,000 Da.) In addition, there is a third, less well defined subunit of relative molecular mass = 29,000 (14Hamatake R.K. Hasegawa H. Clark A.B. Bebenek K. Kunkel T.A. Sugino A. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 4072-4083Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A cDNA of HeLa pol ε 261-kDa catalytic subunit has been cloned (2Kesti T. Frantti H. Syväoja J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 10238-10245Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and the gene has been mapped to human chromosome 12q24.3 (15Szpirer J. Pedeutour F. Kesti T. Riviere M. Syväoja J.E. Turc-Carel C. Szpirer C. Genomics. 1994; 20: 223-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). The amino-terminal half of the protein contains the sequence motifs of both the polymerase and the proofreading exonuclease activities, and the majority of sequence homology to the yeast homologue. The COOH-terminal half contains a cysteine-rich region with sequence features typical of a zinc finger DNA-binding domain and a highly acidic region rich in glutamate and aspartate. The function(s) of the COOH-terminal half is/are unknown but it is not required for activity (16Kesti T. Syväoja J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 6336-6341Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In the case of the yeast enzyme, however, the COOH-terminal half has been implicated in binding the other subunits (4Morrison A. Araki H. Clark A.B. Hamatake R.K. Sugino A.

Cell. 1995; 80: 29-39Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (370) Google Scholar). The cDNAs encoding the 80-kDa (DPB2) and the 34/30 kDa (DPB3) subunits of yeast pol ε have been isolated. DPB2, which shares a common cell cycle regulation pattern with the POL 2gene encoding the catalytic subunit, is essential for cell viability and chromosome replication. Furthermore, the DNA polymerase ε holoenzyme was difficult to obtain from extracts from dpb2-1mutant cells and most of the 256-kDa catalytic subunit was proteolyzed to a 145-kDa peptide in those mutants, suggesting that DPB2 is important in maintaining a stable DNA pol II complex and an intact catalytic subunit (17Araki H. Hamatake R.K. Johnston L.H. Sugino A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 4601-4605Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). DPB3, while not essential for cell viability, is required to maintain fidelity of chromosome replication (18Araki H. Hamatake R.K. Morrison A. Johnson A.L. Johnston L.H. Sugino A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 4867-4872Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). A specific biochemical function of the small HeLa pol ε subunit has also not been assigned; however, it is appears to be required for the stability of pol ε catalytic activity since separation of the catalytic subunit from the small subunit results in unstable enzyme activity with a half-life of several minutes.2 To understand the function of the small subunit and the nature of the interaction between the two subunits of HeLa pol ε, we have isolated and sequenced the full-length cDNA encoding HeLa DNA pol ε small subunit and have localized its gene, DPE2.

The immunoprecipitating IgG, 3B4.12.9, directed against p59 was used in affinity purification; IgG 3A5.6 and IgG 3C5.1 directed against p59 and p261, respectively, were used for immunoblotting. A polyclonal antibody against CCTβ was a generous gift from Dr. K. Willison, Chester Beatty Laboratories, UK. Two human cDNA libraries were screened with either cDNA inserts or oligonucleotide probes. cDNA probes were labeled with [α-32P]dCTP (3000 Ci/mmol, NEN Life Science Products) and a random hexamer kit (Boehringer Mannheim) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Oligonucleotide probes were 5′ end-labeled with [γ-32P]dATP (3000 Ci/mmol, Amersham) and T4 polynucleotide kinase. Plaque screening was performed as described by Sambrook et al. (21Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis R. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Positive clones from a λgt10 library were subcloned into pBluescript KS(−) and those from a λZAP library were phagemid-rescued by M13R408 helper phage according to a protocol of Stratagene. Double-stranded DNA sequencing was performed by the Sanger dideoxy method (22Sanger F. Nicklen S. Coulson A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 5463-5467Crossref PubMed Scopus (52653) Google Scholar) using the Sequenase kit (Amersham). Intelligenetics molecular biology analysis programs were used for nucleotide sequence analyses and calculations of molecular weight and pI. Homology searches and alignments were performed using BLAST (23Altschul S.F. Gish W. Miller W. Myers E.W. Lipman D.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 215: 403-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (70635) Google Scholar) and GeneStream Align. SDS-PAGE was performed by the method of Laemmli (24Laemmli E.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207165) Google Scholar) and immunoblot analysis was done essentially as described in Harlow and Lane (25Harlow E. Lane D. Antibodies: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Sping Harbor, NY1988: 524Google Scholar). The entire coding sequence of p261 was cloned into a pT7-7 vector using conventional restriction digests/ligation reactions and site-directed mutagenesis using PCR to create an NdeI site at the start of p261 gene so that the ribosome-binding site provided by pT7-7 lay 9 base pairs upstream from the AUG start codon. The amplified region of the gene was sequenced to confirm that no other changes were created by the PCR amplification. This construct, pT7-7/pol ε, was then transformed to E. coli BL21(DE3) competent cells and the cells were grown in 2YT medium (16 g of Bacto-tryptone, 10 g of Bacto-yeast extract, 5 g of NaCl per liter) with 100 μg/ml ampicillin at 25 °C until the A 600 reached 0.6. Isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside was then added to a final concentration of 0.5 mm and the culture was grown at 25 °C. For enzyme assays, cultures were centrifuged at 6000 × g for 10 min, and the cell pellets were resuspended in Tris-HCl (pH 8), 5 ml of 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8), 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm DTT, 7.5% sucrose, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.1% LDAO, 5 μg/ml leupeptin, and 5 μg/ml apoproteinin and sonicated five times for 10 s each. The lysates were stirred on ice for 30 min and centrifuged 17,000 × g for 10 min. The p261 cDNA was cloned into the pBacPAK8 transfer vector with most of its 5′- and 3′- untranslated regions removed and the ribosome-binding site position 3 converted to A from T for better expression in insect cells (pBacPAK/pol ε). Recombinant baculovirus was constructed by co-infecting Sf9 cells with this construct and a linearized BacPAK6 viral DNA and amplified according to CLONTECH's protocol. For expression, Sf9 cells were grown to 1 × 106 cells/ml in Ex-Cell 400 medium supplemented with 2% fetal bovine serum and 1% Fungizone and infected with the recombinant virus at a multiplicity of infection of 10. Cells (17–50 × 106) were harvested by centrifugation, washed with cold phosphate-buffered saline, resuspended in 3 ml of 50 mmTris-HCl (pH 8), 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm DTT, 7.5% sucrose, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 5 μg/ml leupeptin, 5 μg/ml pepstatin (lysis buffer), and sonicated three times for 10 s each. The lysates were stirred on ice for 1 h, centrifuged at 12,000 × g for 10 min, and assayed for pol ε activity as described previously (3Nishida C. Reinhard P. Linn S. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 501-510Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and for protein concentration by the method of Bradford (26Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (216204) Google Scholar). Generally 72 h after infection roughly half of the cells had lysed. All procedures were carried out at 4 °C. Soluble extract was prepared from 72 liters of HeLa cells (5 × 105 cells/ml) as described (27Syväoja J. Suomensaari S. Nishida C. Goldsmith J.S. Chui G.S. Jain S. Linn S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 6664-6668Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). The extract was fractionated by 30–50% ammonium sulfate precipitation and then dialyzed overnight in PDG buffer (50 mm potassium phosphate (pH 8.0), 1 mm DTT, 20% glycerol), and applied to a 150-ml DEAE-Sephacel column pre-equilibrated with PDG buffer. The column was washed with 500 ml of PDG buffer and then eluted with a 1200-ml linear gradient from 50 to 500 mm potassium phosphate (pH 8.0) in 1 mmDTT, 20% glycerol. Fractions containing pol ε activity were pooled, precipitated from 70% saturated ammonium sulfate, suspended to 60 ml in antibody binding buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 0.1% Triton X-100, 50 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol), dialyzed against the same buffer, and then mixed with 3 ml of protein G-Sepharose beads (Pharmacia) for 2 h to eliminate proteins that bind nonspecifically to protein G. The supernatant obtained after centrifugation at 1500 × g for 5 min was suspended in 5 mg of IgG 3B4.12.9, covalently cross-linked to 2.5 ml of protein G-Sepharose beads with dimethylpimelimidate (25Harlow E. Lane D. Antibodies: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Sping Harbor, NY1988: 524Google Scholar). Immunoabsorption was carried out for 4 h at 4 °C, after which the beads were washed successively with 30 ml of antibody binding buffer, 30 ml of 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 0.5% Triton X-100, 300 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, and 10 ml of 10 mmpotassium phosphate (pH 8.0), 10% glycerol. Bound proteins were then eluted with 100 mm potassium phosphate (pH 13.0), 10% glycerol and the eluted fraction was immediately neutralized with 1m phosphoric acid, dialyzed versus 1 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 0.01% SDS, dried in a Speed-Vac, resuspended in Laemmli gel loading buffer (24Laemmli E.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207165) Google Scholar), and finally subjected to 7.5% SDS-PAGE. The protein was transferred to a nitrocellulose filter and the portion of the filter bearing the pol ε small subunit was removed. The protein was digested with either Lys-C (Wako Biochemicals) or Staphylococcus aureus V8 (Sigma) protease while bound to the filter and the resultant peptides were separated by reverse phase high performance liquid chromatography on an Altech Hypersil WP-MOS column and sequenced by automated sequential Edman degradation on an Applied Biosystems Automated Sequencer. Human expressed sequence tags were searched for sequences with homology to the S. cerevisiae pol ε accessory proteins' sequences using the NCBI BLAST server and the TBLASTN program (23Altschul S.F. Gish W. Miller W. Myers E.W. Lipman D.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 215: 403-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (70635) Google Scholar). One of them (accession number M62099), which had a marginal similarity to yeast DPB2 sequence, was used to design two primers: sense 1, ACTCCTCCGGTGATAGGTTCTCA (nucleotides 188–210); sense 2, AGCAAATTCCAGGTTAGAACA (nucleotides 227–247). Nested PCR was performed and a 1.36-kilobase fragment was amplified from a HeLa Uni-ZAPTM XR cDNA library in the pBluescript SK(±) vector (Stratagene). Briefly, the phage vector primer, T7, and the sense 1 primer were used to amplify the library and then 1 μl of the first round PCR product was reamplified with primers T7 and sense 2. The amplified fragment contained sequences corresponding to those of 5 of the proteolytic peptides from HeLa pol ε p59. Primers, ACTCCTCCGGTGATAGGTTCTCA and TGGTGGCCTTGGTAAGATGGAA that flanked a 650-bp sequence (nucleotides 549–1244 of the full-length cDNA) were chosen from this fragment and the same HeLa cDNA library was screened three times by a PCR-based method (28Israel D.I. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 2627-2631Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). To obtain the 5′-end of the cDNA, the 5′-rapid amplification of cDNA ends protocol was used (29Frohman M.A. Dush M.K. Martin G.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 8998-9002Crossref PubMed Scopus (4336) Google Scholar). Poly(A)+ RNA was isolated from HeLa cells using a QIAGEN OligotexTM direct mRNA mini kit, and the reverse transcript was obtained with Superscript II Reverse Transcriptase (Life Technologies, Inc.) using an antisense primer, CATGCCTGTGGGTCCTCTGGTGCAA, from the partial clone of HeLa p59 (nucleotides 539–563 of the full-length cDNA). The RNA of the cDNA product was then degraded with E. coli RNase H (Promega) and a poly(A)+ tail of uncertain length was attached to the 5′ terminus of the purified cDNA using dATP and terminal transferase. Finally, the cDNA corresponding to the 5′ terminus of the message was amplified with an antisense primer, TCACTGATAGACTGAAGAGCTT, from the partial clone of HeLa p59 (nucleotides 222–243 of the full-length cDNA) and an anchor primer, oligo(dT)18-dC. For sequencing, plasmid DNAs were purified using the QIAprep Spin plasmid miniprep kit (QIAGEN) and PCR products were purified using the UltraCleanTM 15 kit (Mo Bio Labs, Inc.). DNA sequencing was carried out by the UC Berkeley Sequencing facility using an automated ABI373 DNA Analysis System (Applied Biosystems Inc.). The open reading frame of the p59 cDNA with its Kozak sequence (nucleotides 128–1708 of the full-length cDNA) was cloned into the pBluescript KS(±) vector (Stratagene) with the 5′-end proximal to the T7 promoter.In vitro transcription and translation was carried out with the TNT®T7 Quick Coupled Reticulocyte Lysate System (Promega) according to the manufacture's protocols in a reaction volume of 25 μl. After incubation at 30 °C for 90 min, the reaction was terminated by adding 25 μl of 5 × Laemmli gel loading buffer (24Laemmli E.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207165) Google Scholar) and the translation products were separated on a 9% SDS-polyacrylamide gel, transferred to a nitrocellulose filter and visualized by autoradiography. To assign the gene encoding pol ε p59 to a human chromosome, a Southern blot of a monochromosomal human-rodent hybrid panel (Oncor, Gaithersburg, MD) was probed with a 695-bp (nucleotides 572–1266 of the full-length cDNA) fragment amplified from the partial cDNA clone in the pBluescript vector. (The probe was obtained by PCR with primers ACTCCTCCGGTGATAGGTTCTCA and TGGTGGCCTTGGTAAGATGGAA in the presence of 100 μCi of [α-32P]dCTP (400 Ci/mmol, NEN Life Science Products) and 100 μm dATP, dTTP, and dGTP.) Hybridization was carried out in 50% formamide, 6 × SSC, 1% SDS, 0.1% Ficoll, 0.1% bovine serum albumin, 0.1% polyvinylpyrrolidone, 10% dextran sulfate, 100 μg/ml sonicated salmon sperm DNA for 16 h at 45 °C (30Southern E. J. Mol. Biol. 1975; 98: 503-517Crossref PubMed Scopus (21469) Google Scholar). (1 × SSC contains 0.15 m NaCl, 0.015m Na3 citrate.) Washes were with 0.1 × SSC, 0.1% SDS at 52 °C. Hybridization was visualized by autoradiography. Mapping of the gene to its chromosome locus was performed by SeeDNA Biotech. Inc. (Department of Biology, York University, Ontario, Canada). A biotinlyated probe was prepared using the BioNick labeling kit (Life Technologies, Inc.) from a 1.55-kilobase fragment of p59 cDNA, and then FISH mapping analysis was carried out according to Heng and Tsui (31Heng H.H. Tsui L.C. Chromosoma. 1993; 102: 325-332Crossref PubMed Scopus (431) Google Scholar), and Heng et al. (32Heng H.H. Squire J. Tsui L.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Chem. 1993; 268: 10238-10245Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) we have cloned HeLa pol ε p261. Two PCR products were obtained from a random-primed HeLa cDNA by using primers designed from the sequences of the homologues regions of the α family of DNA polymerases (33Wong S.W. Wahl A.F. Yuan P.M. Arai N. Pearson B.E. Arai K. Korn D. Hunkapiller M.W. Wang T.S. EMBO J. 1988; 7: 37-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar) for yeast pol ε (regions IV, II, and III). Since the nucleotide sequence of these PCR products showed extensive homology to that of yeast pol ε catalytic subunit (4Morrison A. Araki H. Clark A.B. Hamatake R.K. Sugino A. Cell. 1990; 62: 1143-1151Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar), these products were used to screen a random-primed HeLa cDNA library in λgt10 to obtain a cDNA clone which was then used as a probe for plaque hybridization screening of a λgt10 library and a random-primed human fibroblast cDNA library in λZAP. Such screening was repeated until six overlapping cDNA clones representing the entire catalytic subunit were obtained. The open reading frame encodes a protein of 2285 amino acids and a calculated molecular weight of 261,408 and pI of 5.91. This sequence has a number of differences from that of Kesti et al. (2Kesti T. Frantti H. Syväoja J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 10238-10245Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) (Table I), and it has better homology to the S. cerevisiae and S. pombe pol ε catalytic subunit sequences (40.2 and 42.7% identity, respectively). The identity to that from S. cerevisiae is localized: amino acid residues 1–267 show 26.8% identity; residues 268–1166 (which include the pol α-family catalytic motifs) show 63.0% identity; residues 1167–2285 show 25.0% identity.Table IComparison of cDNA sequences for the catalytic subunit of DNA polymerases εSourceN-terminal residue and peptide sequenceThis report67 HPTEILD-EDKRLGS——————-AVDYYFIQDDGSRFKVAKesti et al.(2)67 HP———————————————–VAS. cerevisiae83 HATLVSQ-ETLSSGSNGGGNSNDGERVTTNQGISGVDFYFLDEEGGSFKSTS. pombe77 HPTVIESTKGNSTLS——————-AVDFYFIQDDGDTERCTThis report 440 PEDMCRMATEQKesti et al.

Immunoblotting of cell-free extracts with an anti-p261 antibody showed that within 1–2 h after isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside induction, peptide bands specific to p261 appeared in cells carrying pT7-7/pol ε but not those with pT7-7. A definite band corresponding to the location of p261 derived from HeLa was present along with a variety of smaller bands, but the level of the expression was poor and cell-free extracts exhibited no detectable pol ε activity (data not shown). The low level of expression along with the lack of activity could be explained by proteolysis, codon usage differences, lack of post-translational modification, and/or the absence of the small subunit of HeLa pol ε. The level of p261 expression was much higher with insect cells. A recombinant baculovirus containing the entire coding sequence and an appropriate promotor (see “Experimental Procedures”) expressed the full-length p261 48 h post-infection as judged by immunoblot analysis (Fig. 1 A). In this case, pol ε activity increased from 48 to 72 h to a level that was 6.5-fold that of the control and 25-fold that of the background level of uninfected cells (Fig. 1 B). Attempts to purify the HeLa pol ε p261 from insect cells according to the method developed for purification of pol ε from HeLa were unsuccessful. The recombinant protein did not bind to DEAE-Sephacyl or phosphocellulose and eluted from hydroxyapatite at a much higher potassium phosphate concentration than did the pol ε from HeLa cells. Most importantly, the protein lost its activity during purification (TableII).Table IIAttempted purification of HeLa pol ε p261 expressed in insect cellsFractionVolumeProteinActivitySpecific activitymlmgunitsunits/mgCrude extract68.081625,90031.7Ammonium sulfate25.03158,98028.5Concentrate14.51964,55023.3DEAE-Sephacyl16.8774,76061.6Hydroxyapatite42.018.565835.1 Open table in a new tab HeLa pol ε was previously purified in our laboratory by gentle Dounce homogenization, high speed centrifugation, ammonium sulfate fractionation, and DEAE-Sephacel, phosphocellulose, and hydroxyapatite chromatography (27Syväoja J.

At this point, on an SDS-PAGE gel the small subunit of pol ε is contaminated with CCTβ, a subunit of the very abundant TCP1-containing chaperonin (34Kubota H. Hynes G. Carne A. Ashworth A. Willison K. Curr. Biol. 1994; 4: 89-99Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar). Mono-S fast protein liquid chromatography or glycerol gradient sedimentation can be utilized to obtain pol ε free from CCTβ, but the yield of protein is too low for sequence information. Therefore, an antibody-affinity purification procedure was developed to prepare enough pol ε protein free from CCTβ for microsequencing, in which the DEAE-Sephacel fraction is absorbed to and then eluted from an immunoprecipitating-IgG (3B4.12.9) that binds to the HeLa pol ε small subunit (see “Experimental Procedures”). This eluate contained three major polypeptides: the 261-kDa catalytic subunit, the small subunit of relative molecular mass 55 kDa, and an unknown peptide of relative molecular mass 44 kDa (Fig. 2). The absence of CCTβ from the 55-kDa peptide was confirmed with an immunoblot probed with an antibody to CCTβ. To obtain partial amino acid sequence, the affinity-purified pol ε was subject to SDS-PAGE, transferred to a"

As found previously for MS of small molecules, this study shows that protein fragment identification can be greatly simplified by labeling the modification with stable isotopes. Further, the high resolution capabilities of Fourier transform MS make possible the direct identification of CH3/CD3-labeled peptides without chromatographic separation. Although separate Asp-N, Lys-C, and α-chymotrypsin digests of thiaminase I (42 kDa) yielded as many as 70 peptides, FTMS identification of the labeled peptide localized the modification site of a mechanism-based inhibitor to Arg101-Lys121, Asp90-Gly122, and Gly107-Tyr119, respectively. The measured mass difference values of the two labels agreed with that expected for CH3/CD3, 3.019 Da, with a standard deviation of 0.005 Da, providing persuasive identity verification. MS/MS fragmentation narrowed the site to Pro109-Phe118 and also caused loss of the derivative with a sulfur atom, uniquely identifying Cys113 as the thiaminase I active-site nucleophile among the 379 amino acids.

Further, MS/MS isolation and fragmentation of each isotopically unique ion group can provide information on the label's location in the molecule.

The mass difference (in units of 1.0034 Da) between the most abundant isotopic peak and the monoisotopic peak is denoted in italics after each M r value. For isotopic labels, the Δm values are corrected for isotopic overlaps such as the contribution of 13C31H3to 12C32H3.

Recombinant thiaminase I yielded three molecular ions (42,127-26, 42,198-26, 42,255-26 Da) due to N-terminal heterogeneity (extra Ala, Ala-Gly) (16Kelleher N.L. Costello C.A. Begley T.P.

This spectrum showed the isotopic cluster around 42,198 Da to be <5% as abundant as that around 42,305 Da (16Kelleher N.L. Costello C.A. Begley T.P. McLafferty F.W. J. Am. Soc.

NS dissociation of the multiply charged protein ions from the underivatized enzyme gave 61 different fragment ion masses whose sequence location could be assigned from the corrected DNA-derived sequence (16Kelleher N.L.

Fragments were identified that represented all parts of the protein, but loss of the covalent label from the molecular ion was not detected. For active-site location, the NS spectra of the enzyme without (Fig. 1,a and c) and with (Fig. 1, b and d) its covalently bound label are compared; all three of the molecular ions show that the label causes a 107-Da increase. The identification of fragment ions that do (Fig. 1, a and b) and do not (Fig. 1, c and d) show this increase is illustrated by the y301 and y193 ions (30Roepstorff P. Fohlman J. Biomed. Mass Spectrom. 1984; 11: 601Crossref PubMed Scopus (2371) Google Scholar), 3Amide bond cleavage yields b and y ions containing the N or C terminus, respectively. respectively. However, this comprehensive search for labeled fragments required careful cross-comparison of all isotopic clusters in both spectra; the shifted y30123+ peaks (Figs. 1, a versus b) represent <1% of the m/z range recorded. As an example of possible problems, in a spectrum of the original study (Ref. 16Kelleher N.L. Costello C.A. Begley T.P. McLafferty F.W. J. Am. Soc. Mass Spectrom. 1995; 6: 981-984Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar and Fig.2), the derivatized y301 peak at m/z 1,456 is overlapped by a b776+ fragment ion. In the derivatized sample spectrum (Fig. 1 b), the abundance of the underivatized y301 ions (33,355 Da) is <10% that of the 33,462-Da ions, consistent with the previous evidence for >95% derivatization (16Kelleher N.L.

Now only a single spectrum is needed to identify the modified y301 by its satellite peak at +121 Da, and the relative abundances of these peaks will be less affected by any NS fragmentation variance of separate measurements. Because the active site is in a region of the molecular ion stable to NS fragmentation, this only narrowed the label location to the 99-amino acid region Pro79-Thr177 (16Kelleher N.L. Costello C.A. Begley T.P. McLafferty F.W. J. Am. Soc. Mass Spectrom. 1995; 6: 981-984Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar) (although a modified site in other regions would be well localized by these data,e.g. the region yielding the NS fragment ions b46, b49, b50, b52, b53). Thus proteolysis was tried next, as it can cleave protein bonds at specific sites to produce smaller fragments. 4T. D. Wood, Z. Guan, M. Borders, L. H. Chen, G. L. Kenyon, and F. W. McLafferty, submitted for publication. The accuracy of measuring a 121-Da mass difference (± 1 Da) is relatively poor because the masses as well as their mass difference are so large. To make these smaller, thiaminase I was reacted with a 1:1 mixture of 2 and2-CH3 and digested with Asp-N. Inspection of the resulting complex spectrum for a pair of peaks of expected Δm = 14.016 was ambiguous, although the 3,816.05-2-Da peak (Fig. 2 a) corresponds to that calculated for the Asp-N peptide Asp90-Gly122 with a 121.06-Da label (3,816.06-2). The isotopic cluster corresponding to the peptide with the 107-Da label (3,802-2) is at the noise level, indicating at least a 20:1 overall reactivity difference for these suicide substrates. To avoid such reactivity differences, thiaminase I was labeled with2 and 2-CH3 in separate tubes, mixed 1:1, and digested. The resulting mixture gave a complex spectrum containing >80 isotopic distributions of ∼40 peptides examined by ESI/FTMS (Fig. 2 b). Now these peaks (3,802.05-2 and 3,816.06-2) are both of sufficient abundance (Fig.2 c) for an accurate measurement of their mass difference. The Δm value found, 14.01 ± 0.02 Da (calculated, 14.02 Da), is of far higher accuracy than that of Fig. 1 and strongly supports the dual label assignment. The Asp-N data further restrict the active site from the 79–177 to the 90–122 region of this protein. Isolation and dissociation of the Fig. 2 c ions gave the Fig.3 spectrum, with 11 assigned fragment ions, confirming that the peptide is Asp90-Gly122. However, recognition of the Δm = 14.02-Da label (indicated as “+14”) was difficult because the off-resonance SORI excitation (27Senko M.W. Beu S.C. McLafferty F.W. J. Am. Soc. Mass Spectrom. 1995; 6: 229-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (387) Google Scholar) activated the lower mass precursor ions to a far greater extent; infrared multiphoton dissociation (31Little D.P. Speir J.P. Senko M.W. O'Connor P.B. McLafferty F.W. Anal. Chem. 1994; 66: 2809-2815Crossref PubMed Scopus (666) Google Scholar) would be superior in this regard. The correct identification of the internal ion Pro109-Phe118, also made ambiguous by the low fragment ion abundance from the 3,816.06-2 precursor (Fig.3, inset), would have further restricted the active site. To minimize differences in substrate reactivity as well as SORI excitation, a 1:2 mixture of2-CH3 and 2-CD3 was reacted with thiaminase I, and the products were digested with Asp-N. The spectrum of this unfractionated digest (Fig.4 a) contained ∼40 components of sizes 1.2–4.5 kDa. Now even a casual inspection identifies the labeled peptide; the peak grouping at m/z 955 is highly distinctive with twice the normal number of isotopic peaks for a peptide of this size (Fig. 4 b). The measured monoisotopic mass of 3,814.06-0 (i.e. 3, 816.07-2) corresponds to Asp90-Gly122 with a 121.06-Da label (3,814.05-0 Da) with a measured 32:68 ratio for the fitted abundances (circles and squares, Fig. 4) of the two components; their measured Δm values of 3.021 and 3.026 Da for the two most abundant isotopes compare well with 3.019 Da expected for m(CD3) −m(CH3). To localize further the modification site within Asp90-Gly122, a region with two internal Lys residues, thiaminase I was treated with a 1:1 mixture of2-CH3 and 2-CD3 and digested with Lys-C. The product spectrum indicated 22 peptides of sizes 1 to 8.2 kDa (Fig. 5 a); of these, the abundance distributions of the isotopic peak groups beginning at 2,600.37 and 2,617.40 Da (Fig. 5 b) were highly distinctive with nearly twice the normal number of isotopic peaks. Fitting the abundance ratios to those expected for the CH3and CD3 adducts indicated these to be in 60:40 and 56:44 ratios for the 2,600 and 2,617 peak groups, respectively; any isotope effects are within the ± 10% error in sample preparation. For the two most abundant isotopic peaks of the two clusters, Δm = 3.020 and 3.021 and Δm = 3.015 and 3.015 Da. The 2,617.40-0-Da value matches that expected for Arg101-Lys121 with the 121.06-Da label (2,617.39-0), a site localization improved over the Asp-N peptide Asp90-Gly122. The labeled 2,600.37 peak at m/z 652 represents the loss of 17.02 ± 0.02 Da from M4+; loss of ammonia (17.03 Da) has been reported for other peptides with an N-terminal arginine (32Campbell S. Rodgers M.T. Marzluff E.M. Beauchamp J.L. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1995; 117: 12840-12854Crossref Scopus (341) Google Scholar, 33Schnier P.D. Price W.D. Jockusch P.A. Williams E.R. J. Am. Chem.

Mass Spectrom. 1997; 8: 253-261Crossref Scopus (48) Google Scholar). MS/MS of the 2,617.40-0-Da ions gave eight fragment ions, consistent with the Arg101-Lys121 assignment (Fig. 6 a). Of the fragments that exhibited broadened isotopic distributions, the 1,728.96-0 ions (Fig. 6 c) corresponding to y13 localized the modification to the 13-residue region Pro109-Lys121; the complementary b8ion was not labeled. The measured Δm values for the two most abundant isotopic peaks of the y13 are 3.022 and 3.014, and the isotopic abundances correspond to a label ratio of 67:33; differential SORI excitation of the CH3-versus the CD3-labeled molecular ions could have altered their 56:44 ratio. NH3 loss occurs from the N-terminal b7 and b8 ions but not from y13. Within the region Pro109-Phe118, the less specific enzyme α-chymotrypsin could cleave on the C-terminal side of Leu112, Leu116, Leu117, Phe118, or Tyr119. Its partial proteolysis of the 1:1 2-CH3:2-CD3inactivated thiaminase I with quenching after 10 and 36 min yielded spectra with 65 and 70 components, respectively. Despite this complexity, peak groups beginning at 1,614.87-0 in the 36-min spectrum (Fig. 7) and at 3,619.94-0 Da in the 10-min spectrum (not shown) were recognizable by their broadened isotopic distributions. These represented CH3/CD3 ratios of 58:42 and 45:55, with Δm = 3.027 and 3.026 (two most abundant isotopic peaks) and Δm = 3.024 and 3.015, respectively. These M r values correspond (expected, 1,614.86-0 and 3,619.92-0) to the 121.06-Da-labeled peptides Gly107-Tyr119 and Gly107-Tyr136 from proteolysis at Tyr106, Tyr119, and Tyr136. This simple identification of one out of 70 peptides limits the labeled site to 13 amino acids without assignment of any other peptides to those possible from common chymotryptic cleavages (i.e. C-terminal to Phe, Tyr, Trp, and Leu). Unfortunately, MS/MS of the Gly107-Tyr119 ions gave only one fragment ion cluster displaying the isotopic signature (Fig. 7, inset), with a measured CH3/CD3 65:35 ratio and Δm = 3.018 and 3.014. Assignment of this as b12 localizes the active site to Gly107-Phe118. These data combined with the Lys-C data localize the labeled site to Pro109-Phe118, confirming the Pro109-Phe118 poorly indicated (Fig. 3,inset) by Asp-N digestion and MS/MS. The only nucleophilic residues in this region are Cys113 and Thr114. The MS/MS spectra of Figs. 3 and 6 contained anomalous peaks that corresponded to the loss of a singly charged ion or neutral of unusual mass. Dissociation of the (Asp90-Gly122)5+ peptide ions (Fig.3) gave a (3,660.99 Da)4+ ion that corresponds to the loss of a singly protonated fragment ion of 141.05 Da (neutral mass), whereas losses of 141.03, 141.03, and 141.02 Da were observed from y304+, y314+, and y142+, respectively. Similarly, in Fig.6 the (Arg101-Lys121)4+ peptide ions of 2,619.39-2 and 2,622.41-2) produce 2,464.35-2 ions by the losses of 155.04 and 158.06 Da; such neutral losses from the y132+ ion are consistent with the formation of the 1,573.93-0 Da ion. These reactions all involve loss of the isotopic label (Fig. 6, c versus b); the only apparent explanation is that collisional dissociation is causing the Asp90-Gly122 ions to lose (Scheme FSII) 3a-SH and the Arg101-Lys121 ions to lose3b-SH. Thus the suicide substrate must be bound to the enzyme through a sulfur linkage, namely a Cys residue; the only one in these peptides is Cys113, identifying the modification site exactly. This ion fragmentation in which the suicide substrate is lost with the active-site nucleophile makes possible the identification of a single labeled residue in a 379-amino acid protein using only the spectrum of one enzymatic digest (Fig. 2 or 5) and one MS/MS spectrum of its labeled peaks (Fig. 3 or 6) and without assigning the many other M r values observed to other peptide products. Another isotopic label, 4,5,6-13C3-2, gave similar results. Without the 105 resolving power (RP) capabilities of FTMS, labeled site location in large proteins would be more difficult but still possible in many cases. Quadrupoles can achieve ∼103 RP for MS and MS/MS spectra, whereas time-of-flight instruments can achieve substantially higher RP for MS spectra but much lower for MS/MS spectra. The charge states of isotopically unresolved peptide ions from ESI would have to be determined by deconvolution (5McLafferty F.W. Acc. Chem. Res. 1994; 27: 379-386Crossref Scopus (209) Google Scholar), although not those of the singly charged ions from matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization (37Karas M. Hillenkamp F. Anal. Chem. 1988; 60: 2299-2301Crossref PubMed Scopus (4764) Google Scholar). For RP = 103, the Asp90-Gly122-labeled (Δm = 3 Da) ions of the Fig. 4 spectrum would form a single peak although broadened versus that of an unlabeled peptide (at RP = 103, each of 4-kDa isotopic peaks will be 4-Da wide at half-height). Even for a label of larger Δm, RP = 103 would require prior chromatographic separation to identify labeled peaks in more complex proteolysis mixtures (e.g. 70 peptides, Fig. 7). Successful application of this approach should be possible for many proteins. The covalent label must not be removed completely by the proteolysis or ion fragmentation used, but partial removal that includes a heteroatom of the labeled amino acid (S, N, O) can substantially restrict its location. High resolution and accuracy are valuable to detect multiple site derivatization from the M r shift caused by labeling and to identify with high confidence the Δm indicative of the labeled peaks. Isotopic labels minimize reaction rate differences, whereas ion dissociation methods other than SORI minimize m/zdiscrimination in MS/MS spectra."

The family of intermediate filament (IF) 1The abbreviations used are: IF, intermediate filament; K, keratin; PCR, polmerase chain reaction; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; β-ME, β-mercaptoethanol. 1The abbreviations used are: IF, intermediate filament; K, keratin; PCR, polmerase chain reaction; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; β-ME, β-mercaptoethanol. genes comprises >50 members and encodes proteins that assemble into filaments defined by their flexibility, an apparent lack of polarity, and a diameter of ∼10–12 nm. IFs are ubiquitous cellular components in higher multicellular organisms and have been subdivided into five major types based on nucleotide sequence homology and genomic structure (1Fuchs E. Weber K. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1994; 63: 345-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (1272) Google Scholar). Type I and type II IF genes encode the acidic and basic-neutral keratins, respectively, which co-polymerize into extended IFs in the cytoplasm of epithelial cells. The expression of the >12 basic-neutral and >12 acidic keratins is co-regulated in a pairwise fashion in the various epithelia of the body, depending on the epithelial tissue type and program of terminal differentiation executed (2O'Guin W.M. Schermer A. Lynch M. Sun T.-T. Goldman R.D. Steinert P.M. Cellular and Molecular Biology of Intermediate Filaments. Plenum Publishing Corp., New York1990: 301-334Crossref Google Scholar). The diversity and differentiation-specific expression of keratin genes is prevalent among higher vertebrates, although the underlying molecular basis remains obscure.Keratins and other cytoplasmic IF proteins show a conserved tripartite domain structure consisting of a ≈310-residue-long, α-helical central domain flanked by non-helical head and tail domains of various length and primary sequence. The rod domain features extended heptad repeats (abcdefg) in which the first (a) and fourth (d) residues are hydrophobic. Short linker sequences interrupt these repeats at three conserved locations, defining subdomains 1A, 1B, 2A, and 2B (1Fuchs E. Weber K. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1994; 63: 345-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (1272) Google Scholar, 3Parry D.A.D. Goldman R.D. Steinert P.M. Cellular and Molecular Biology of Intermediate Filaments. Plenum Publishing Corp., New York1990: 175-202Crossref Google Scholar). Such heptad repeats foster coiled-coil interactions between monomeric α-helices, producing a thermodynamically stable dimer. Keratins are unique among IF proteins in that the coiled-coil is a heterodimer involving a type I and a type II protein (4Coulombe P.A. Fuchs E. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 111: 153-169Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar, 5Hatzfeld M. Weber K. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 110: 1199-1210Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar, 6Steinert P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 8766-8774Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). As for all other IF proteins, however, the two keratin chains in the dimer are aligned in parallel and in register (see, e.g., Refs. 5Hatzfeld M. Weber K. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 110: 1199-1210Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar and 7Aebi U. Cohn J. Buhle L. Gerace L. Nature. 1986; 323: 560-564Crossref PubMed Scopus (678) Google Scholar, 8Geisler N.

Cytoplasmic IF dimers readily associate with an antiparallel orientation to form a tetramer, whose conformation is still debated (see, e.g., Refs.8Geisler N. Schunemann J. Weber K. Eur. J.

Cell Biol. 1993; 123: 1517-1533Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). The tetramer is the only assembly intermediate obtainable in high yield in vitro and may play a major role in the rapid elongation phase that ensues nucleation of 10-nm filament assembly (12Steinert P.M. J. Struct. Biol. 1991; 107: 175-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar,13Stewart M. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1993; 5: 3-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). In addition, the available evidence indicates that the tetramer is the predominant species in the cytoplasmic pool of soluble assembly subunits in various mammalian cell types in culture (see Refs. 14Eriksson J.E. Opal P. Goldman R.D. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1992; 4: 99-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar and15Chou C.F. Riopel C.L. Rott L.S. Omary M.B. J. Cell Sci. 1993; 105: 433-445Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, and references therein; for a different situation in Xenopus oocytes, see Ref. 16Bachant J.B. Klymkowsky M.W. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 132: 153-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). As such, it represents a logical candidate for being an exchangeable subunit in the context of dynamic IFs in vivo (14Eriksson J.E. Opal P. Goldman R.D. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1992; 4: 99-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). While these issues require further attention, they nevertheless identify the tetramer as a determinant of the assembly, regulation, and dynamics of cytoplasmic IFs, at least in mammalian cells.The molecular architecture of IFs remains to be defined. 10-nm filaments assembled from various IF protein types show consistent features when examined by electron microscopy. These filaments show an axial beading repeat of 21–22 nm when analyzed by glycerol spraying and rotary shadowing, and the occasional unraveling of the filament backbone reveals a subfibrillar structure with three to four protofibrils per filament cross-section (17Aebi U.

However, scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) analyses showed that the number of monomers per filament cross-section actually varies according to the IF protein type involved, its source, and method of preparation (11Heins S.

Accordingly, the molecular architecture that defines IFs, the identity of the species that nucleate their assembly, and the mechanism of subunit addition to the growing polymer are still being investigated (12Steinert P.M.

In these tissues, progenitor cells located in the basal layer express the type II K5 and the type I genes K14 and K15, while differentiating suprabasal cells express distinct keratin combinations depending upon the differentiation program executed (2O'Guin W.M. Schermer A. Lynch M. Sun T.-T. Goldman R.D. Steinert P.M. Cellular and Molecular Biology of Intermediate Filaments. Plenum Publishing Corp., New York1990: 301-334Crossref Google Scholar). Invariably, however, the pattern of keratin expression is altered after tissue injury and under conditions that promote altered differentiation in stratified epithelia. For example, induction of the type II K6 and the type I K16 and K17 genes occurs in the suprabasal (post-mitotic) layers of the wounded stratified epithelium (20Weiss R.A. Eichner R. Sun T.T. J. Cell Biol. 1984; 98: 1397-1406Crossref PubMed Scopus (447) Google Scholar, 21Mansbridge J.N. Knapp A.M. J. Invest. Dermatol. 1987; 89: 253-263Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 22Stoler A.

Cell Biol. 1996; 132: 381-397Crossref PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar). We showed that the rapid induction and the subsequent accumulation of these keratins during the first 24 h after acute injury to human skin correlates with striking changes in the organization of keratin IFs and cytoarchitecture of keratinocytes at the wound edge (23Paladini R.D. Takahashi K. Bravo N.S. Coulombe P.A. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 132: 381-397Crossref PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar). By comparing the assembly properties of K6-K16 and K5-K14, we demonstrated that K16, in particular, features unusual properties in that it formed unstable heterotetramers that polymerized into relatively short 10-nm filaments in vitro. Here we report on the biochemical basis underlying K16's peculiar tetramer assembly properties, provide evidence for its relevance to 10-nm filament assembly and regulation, and present a model that integrates the regulation of K16 protein levels and its function in stratified epithelia under normal and wound repair conditions. The family of intermediate filament (IF) 1The abbreviations used are: IF, intermediate filament; K, keratin; PCR, polmerase chain reaction; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; β-ME, β-mercaptoethanol. 1The abbreviations used are: IF, intermediate filament; K, keratin; PCR, polmerase chain reaction; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; β-ME, β-mercaptoethanol. genes comprises >50 members and encodes proteins that assemble into filaments defined by their flexibility, an apparent lack of polarity, and a diameter of ∼10–12 nm. IFs are ubiquitous cellular components in higher multicellular organisms and have been subdivided into five major types based on nucleotide sequence homology and genomic structure (1Fuchs E. Weber K. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1994; 63: 345-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (1272) Google Scholar). Type I and type II IF genes encode the acidic and basic-neutral keratins, respectively, which co-polymerize into extended IFs in the cytoplasm of epithelial cells. The expression of the >12 basic-neutral and >12 acidic keratins is co-regulated in a pairwise fashion in the various epithelia of the body, depending on the epithelial tissue type and program of terminal differentiation executed (2O'Guin W.M. Schermer A. Lynch M. Sun T.-T. Goldman R.D. Steinert P.M. Cellular and Molecular Biology of Intermediate Filaments. Plenum Publishing Corp., New York1990: 301-334Crossref Google Scholar). The diversity and differentiation-specific expression of keratin genes is prevalent among higher vertebrates, although the underlying molecular basis remains obscure. Keratins and other cytoplasmic IF proteins show a conserved tripartite domain structure consisting of a ≈310-residue-long, α-helical central domain flanked by non-helical head and tail domains of various length and primary sequence. The rod domain features extended heptad repeats (abcdefg) in which the first (a) and fourth (d) residues are hydrophobic. Short linker sequences interrupt these repeats at three conserved locations, defining subdomains 1A, 1B, 2A, and 2B (1Fuchs E. Weber K. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1994; 63: 345-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (1272) Google Scholar, 3Parry D.A.D. Goldman R.D. Steinert P.M. Cellular and Molecular Biology of Intermediate Filaments. Plenum Publishing Corp., New York1990: 175-202Crossref Google Scholar). Such heptad repeats foster coiled-coil interactions between monomeric α-helices, producing a thermodynamically stable dimer. Keratins are unique among IF proteins in that the coiled-coil is a heterodimer involving a type I and a type II protein (4Coulombe P.A. Fuchs E. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 111: 153-169Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar, 5Hatzfeld M. Weber K. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 110: 1199-1210Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar, 6Steinert P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 8766-8774Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). As for all other IF proteins, however, the two keratin chains in the dimer are aligned in parallel and in register (see, e.g., Refs. 5Hatzfeld M. Weber K. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 110: 1199-1210Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar and 7Aebi U. Cohn J. Buhle L. Gerace L. Nature. 1986; 323: 560-564Crossref PubMed Scopus (678) Google Scholar, 8Geisler N.

Chem. 1993; 268: 24916-24925Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Cytoplasmic IF dimers readily associate with an antiparallel orientation to form a tetramer, whose conformation is still debated (see, e.g., Refs.8Geisler N. Schunemann J. Weber K. Eur. J.

Cell Biol. 1993; 123: 1517-1533Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). The tetramer is the only assembly intermediate obtainable in high yield in vitro and may play a major role in the rapid elongation phase that ensues nucleation of 10-nm filament assembly (12Steinert P.M. J. Struct. Biol. 1991; 107: 175-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar,13Stewart M. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1993; 5: 3-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). In addition, the available evidence indicates that the tetramer is the predominant species in the cytoplasmic pool of soluble assembly subunits in various mammalian cell types in culture (see Refs. 14Eriksson J.E. Opal P. Goldman R.D. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1992; 4: 99-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar and15Chou C.F. Riopel C.L. Rott L.S. Omary M.B. J. Cell Sci. 1993; 105: 433-445Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, and references therein; for a different situation in Xenopus oocytes, see Ref. 16Bachant J.B. Klymkowsky M.W. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 132: 153-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). As such, it represents a logical candidate for being an exchangeable subunit in the context of dynamic IFs in vivo (14Eriksson J.E. Opal P. Goldman R.D. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1992; 4: 99-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). While these issues require further attention, they nevertheless identify the tetramer as a determinant of the assembly, regulation, and dynamics of cytoplasmic IFs, at least in mammalian cells. The molecular architecture of IFs remains to be defined. 10-nm filaments assembled from various IF protein types show consistent features when examined by electron microscopy. These filaments show an axial beading repeat of 21–22 nm when analyzed by glycerol spraying and rotary shadowing, and the occasional unraveling of the filament backbone reveals a subfibrillar structure with three to four protofibrils per filament cross-section (17Aebi U. Haner M. Troncoso J. Eichner R. Engel A. Protoplasma. 1988; 145: 73-81Crossref Scopus (104) Google Scholar). The current models for the structure of IFs assume that there are 16 dimers per filament cross-section (which may represent the “ideal” case), and propose a packing of dimer subunits that satisfies the many constraints imposed by the biochemical and ultrastructural data accumulated to date (1Fuchs E.

Transfection experiments in COS-1 cells of N-terminally deleted MxB constructs revealed a functional nuclear localization signal (NLS) within the first 24 N-terminal amino acids of the protein. In all the studied cell types, IFN-α induced the expression of MxB protein of two different molecular masses, namely 78- and 76-kDa forms. The 78-kDa protein represents a full-length translation product of the MxB gene with a putative NLS. Instead, the 76-kDa protein is apparently being translated from the second AUG codon of the same MxB mRNA. In primary leukocytes, the full-length NLS-containing 78-kDa protein constituted approximately 25% of the total MxB protein immunoreactivity (3Melén K. Keskinen P. Ronni T. Sareneva T. Lounatmaa K.

In the present study, we show that the nuclear and cytoplasmic MxB proteins form hetero-oligomers and that the nuclear transport of the cytoplasmic MxB protein is facilitated by an interaction with the nuclear NLS-containing MxB protein via the C-terminal leucine zipper element. Cell fractionation studies also confirmed a significant presence of the cytoplasmic form of MxB protein in the nucleus. This observation demonstrates how the transport of a protein to the nucleus through a nuclear pore complex (NPC) occurs both by a specific NLS-requiring transport system and by a passive cotransport mechanism. Using confocal laser microscopy, we also show that the cytoplasmic MxA and the nuclear MxB proteins do not colocalize.

To create a HA1-tagged (Tyr-Pro-Tyr-Asp-Val-Pro-Asp-Tyr-Ala) transient expression plasmid, oligonucleotides with a new BamHI cloning site and BclI sites with cohesive ends (5′-strand oligonucleotide, 5′GATCAACCATGTACCCCTACGACGTGCCCGACTACGCCGGATCCT and 3′-strand oligonucleotide, 5′GATCAGGATCCGGCGTAGTCGGGCACGTGGTAGGGG TACATGGTT) were synthesized on an Applied Biosystems (Foster City, CA) model 394 DNA/RNA oligonucleotide synthesizer.

Also the corresponding gene constructs, lacking a C-terminal leucine zipper domain, MxB(25–644) and MxB(83–644), were created by polymerase chain reaction (26Saiki R.K. Gelfand D.H. Stoffel S.

The primer for the 3′ end was CTG AAT (GGA TCC) TCA TTA CTG GTT GGC GAG ACG-3′ (the BamHI site is in parenthesis, and the STOP codon is underlined). All the DNA manipulations were performed according to standard protocols (27Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed.

Various MxB gene constructs were also cloned into the BamHI site of pGEM-3Zf(+) (Promega) vector, and in vitro translation was carried out as previously decribed (28Sareneva T. Mortz E. Tölö H.

COS-1, HEp-2, and T98G cells were transfected with pBC12/CMV-MxB and various MxB deletion gene constructs, using the LipofectAMINE reagent (Life Technologies, Inc.) in accordance with the manufacturer instructions.

IFN-α-induced (1000 IU/ml, 24 h) macrophages or T98G glioblastoma cells were washed twice with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline, scraped from the dishes, and pelleted. All the cell manipulations were done on ice. The pelleted cells were washed twice with isotonic buffer A (10 mmHEPES, pH 7.4, 0.25 m sucrose, 0.1 mmphenylmethylsulfonylfluoride (PMSF; Boehringer Mannheim GmbH), followed by disruption with a Dounce homogenizer (50 strokes) in 1 ml of buffer A, supplemented with 2 mm EDTA and 0.1 mmdithiothreitol. The nuclei were isolated by low speed centrifugation (500 × g for 10 min), and both the pellet (nuclei) and the supernatant (cytoplasmic fraction) were collected. This step was repeated once. The chemical cross-linking of cellular MxB protein was performed using a protocol described previously (21Melén K. Ronni T. Broni B. Krug R.M. von Bonsdorff C.-H. Julkunen I. J. Biol.

Transport of both the nuclear and various cytoplasmic MxB protein constructs were analyzed by indirect immunofluorescense microscopy in transiently transfected COS-1 and transiently transfected, IFN-α-induced HEp-2 and T98G cells. When COS-1 cells were transfected with a full-length human MxB gene, the expressed 78-kDa MxB protein was found in a granular pattern both in the nucleus and to a lesser extent in the cytoplasm (Fig.1 a). When the cells were transiently transfected with the MxB(25–715) gene, lacking the NLS and stained with anti-MxB antibodies, the 76-kDa MxB protein was found in a granular pattern solely in the cytoplasm (Fig. 1 e). The image was similar when COS-1 cells were transfected with the HA1-MxB(25–715) gene construct, followed by staining with anti-HA1 epitope-specific antibodies (Fig. 1 b). Instead, when both the wild-type MxB and epitope-tagged HA1-MxB(25–715) gene constructs were transiently cotransfected and stained with anti-HA1 antibodies, the HA1-MxB(25–715) form of MxB protein was found in a granular fashion in the nucleus (Fig. 1 c). Similarly, HA1-MxB(83–715) gene construct, lacking both the NLS and the whole PRD, was also cotransfected with the wild-type MxB gene product and found to be transported into the nucleus (Fig. 1 g). Nuclear staining was detected in 50 or 60% of the cells for HA1-MxB(25–715) or HA1-MxB(83–715) proteins, respectively (Fig. 3 A).Figure 3Percent of HA1 epitope-tagged MxB protein found in the nucleus of transiently transfected COS-1, HEp-2, and T98G cells.

Ronni T. Broni B. Krug R.M. von Bonsdorff C.-H. Julkunen I. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 25898-25907Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), was capable of mediating the oligomerization of the nuclear and cytoplasmic forms of MxB protein and subsequently initiate the transport of the cytoplasmic form into the nucleus, we created MxB gene constructs that lacked both the NLS (and PRD) and C-terminal leucine zipper element. When these gene constructs were cotransfected with the wild-type nuclear MxB gene into COS-1 cells and stained with monoclonal anti-HA1-tag antibodies, MxB protein, lacking both the NLS and leucine zipper element, was found diffusively in the cytoplasm (Fig. 1, d and h). The granular MxB-specific staining was found in the nucleus in only in 2 to 3% of the cells (Fig. 3 A), clearly suggesting that the leucine zipper element is mediating the oligomerization of the cytoplasmic and nuclear MxB proteins. To consider the possibility that overexpression of various MxB gene constructs in COS-1 cells affected their transport into the nucleus, we carried out transfection experiments with HA1-tagged MxB gene construct in cells that can naturally produce MxB protein in response to IFN-α stimulation. When HEp-2 and T98G cells were induced with IFN-α (1000 IU/ml, 24 h), MxB protein was found in a granular pattern both in the nucleus and cytoplasm (Fig. 2,a and e). When the HA1-MxB(83–715) gene construct, lacking both the NLS and PRD, was expressed in uninduced cells and stained with anti-HA1 antibodies, the protein was found in a granular pattern in the cytoplasm (Fig. 2, b and f). If the cells were first treated with IFN-α, followed by transfection and fixing of these cells 12 and 48 h later, respectively, the HA1 epitope-tagged MxB protein was found in a granular pattern both in the nucleus and cytoplasm (Fig. 2,c and g). Nuclear staining of HA1-MxB(83–715) protein was found in 40 and 50% of T98G and HEp-2 cells, respectively (Fig. 3 B), strongly suggesting that the natural, nuclear form of MxB protein can oligomerize with the HA1-MxB(83–715) protein and translocate it into the nucleus. If the experiment was done as above with a respective gene construct, also lacking the C-terminal leucine zipper element HA1-MxB(83–644), fluorescence was found diffusively in the cytoplasm (Fig. 2,d and h). The granular MxB-specific staining was found in the nucleus in only in 3–5% of the cells (Fig.3 B). To verify the cell biological observations of the cytoplasmic MxB protein being transported into the nucleus with the nuclear MxB protein (Fig. 1–3), we carried out cell fractionation experiments in cells or cell lines expressing human MxB as well as MxA proteins. First, we analyzed which of the two naturally expressed MxB-specific bands (78 and 76 kDa) in Western blotting (Ref. 3Melén K. Keskinen P. Ronni T. Sareneva T. Lounatmaa K. Julkunen I. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 23478-23486Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar; Fig.4A) corresponded to full-length or shorter MxB translation products. We used in vitrotranslation system with full-length and N-terminally truncated MxB gene constructs to verify their corresponding molecular masses. The full-length MxB gene construct was in vitro translated into two clearly detectable bands (78 and 76 kDa), corresponding exactly to the ones seen in primary leukocytes (PBMC, Fig. 4 A). MxB gene construct, lacking the NLS namely MxB(25–715), was translated into a single band of 76 kDa, strongly suggesting that this band corresponded to the in vivo translated cytoplasmic form of MxB protein. The in vitro translation products of the MxB(43–715) and MxB(83–715) gene constructs, initiating from the third and fourth methionine, gave rise to shorter MxB polypeptides (Fig. 4 A). To analyze the proportional amounts of the nuclear and cytoplasmic MxB proteins in the cell nucleus, IFN-α-induced macrophages and T98G glioblastoma cells were fractionated, and the nuclei and cytoplasmic extracts were analyzed in Western blotting. Based on densitometric scanning, the 78-kDa MxB protein comprised about 25% of the total MxB immunoreactivity in cells. In the nucleus, the proportional amounts of the 78- and 76-kDa forms of MxB protein were equal (50:50%) (Fig.4 B, lanes N), further supporting the view that also the cytoplasmic 76-kDa form of MxB protein is efficiently transported into the cell nucleus. Cytoplasmic MxA protein could not be found in the nucleus (Fig. 4 B, lanes N; see also Fig. 5), indicating that the nuclei were virtually free of cytoplasmic contamination. Since murine Mx1 protein is capable of forming oligomeric structures in vivo (21Melén K. Ronni T. Broni B. Krug R.M. von Bonsdorff C.-H. Julkunen I. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 25898-25907Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), we used chemical cross-linking of permeabilized IFN-α-induced T98G cells to analyze the potential oligomerization pattern of human MxB protein. Gel analysis revealed that dimers and trimers as well as other oligomeric forms of MxB protein were formed (Fig. 4 C). This oligomerization pattern closely resembles the ones seen for mouse and rat Mx1 proteins (21Melén K. Ronni T. Broni B. Krug R.M. von Bonsdorff C.-H. Julkunen I. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 25898-25907Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Since the cytoplasmic and nuclear forms of MxB protein can oligomerize via their leucine zipper elements, we addressed the question of whether the cytoplasmic MxA and cytoplasmic/nuclear MxB proteins would also form oligomers and colocalize in a natural situation, i.e. in IFN-α-treated primary human macrophages. The cells were treated with IFN-α (1000 IU/ml, 24 h), fixed, and double stained with rabbit anti-MxA and guinea pig anti-MxB antibodies, which show very good specificity (3Melén K. Keskinen P. Ronni T. Sareneva T. Lounatmaa K. Julkunen I. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 23478-23486Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Confocal laser microscopy revealed that MxA protein was found solely in the cell cytoplasm (Fig. 5 A, a), whereas MxB protein was distributed evenly between the nucleus and cytoplasm (Fig.5 A, c). Colocalization analysis (Fig.5 A, b, B, and C) revealed that no MxA protein was found in the nucleus, clearly suggesting that cytoplasmic MxA and nuclear MxB proteins do not form oligomers, and nuclear MxB protein cannot translocate cytoplasmic MxA protein into the nucleus. In the cytoplasm, there was some colocalization (Fig.5 A, b, yellow, and B) of MxA- and MxB-specific staining, but it is most likely due to localization of both proteins in similar network-like structures all over the cytoplasm. Quantitative analysis (Fig. 5, B and C) revealed that nuclear MxB protein accumulated underneath the nuclear membrane, and approximately 25% of the total MxB-specific staining was in the nucleus. We have previously shown that humans also, not just rodents (7Melén K. Julkunen I. Virology. 1994; 205: 269-279Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar,21Melén K. Ronni T. Broni B.

Chem. 1996; 271: 23478-23486Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Two forms of human MxB protein exist; an NLS-containing 78-kDa and a cytoplasmic 76-kDa form, the nuclear form comprising approximately 25% of total MxB immunoreactivity in primary human leukocytes. Deletion analyses revealed that the NLS of MxB protein is situated within the first 24 N-terminal amino acids of the protein (3Melén K. Keskinen P. Ronni T. Sareneva T. Lounatmaa K. Julkunen I. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 23478-23486Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). As detected by indirect immunofluorescence and immunoelectron microscopy, MxB protein was found in a granular pattern both in the cell cytoplasm and nucleus where it appeared to be localized in the nuclear matrix and associated to chromatin (3Melén K. Keskinen P. Ronni T. Sareneva T. Lounatmaa K. Julkunen I. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 23478-23486Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). These findings encouraged us to examine the nuclear transport of the MxB protein in more detail and specifically ask the question of whether the cytoplasmic 76-kDa MxB protein, without an NLS, could also be transported into the nucleus. To be able to identify transfected forms of MxB protein from the endogenous ones, we created chimeric influenza virus hemagglutinin epitope-tagged MxB proteins. Based on transient transfection experiments in COS-1 cells, we could conclude that HA1-tagged proteins behaved as expected. The NLS-containing MxB protein was transported into the nucleus, whereas the MxB protein, lacking the NLS, remained in the cytoplasm (Fig. 1, a and e). These experiments also indicated that the full-length, nuclear 78-kDa MxB protein was capable of forming oligomers with the cytoplasmic 76-kDa or shorter forms of MxB protein and was able to cotransport these forms into the nucleus (Figs. 1 and 3). This suggests that MxB protein complexes, containing e.g. only one nuclear MxB protein form, would most likely be transported into the nucleus. When N-terminally truncated MxB proteins also lacked the C-terminal leucine zipper element (HA1-MxB(25–644) and HA1-MxB(83–644)), they remained in the cell cytoplasm (Figs. 1 and 3 A), strongly suggesting that the C-terminal end is crucial in mediating the oligomerization of MxB proteins. An intact leucine zipper element is thus a prerequisite for the cytoplasmic form of MxB protein to be transported into the nucleus with the 78-kDa nuclear form. Conclusions based on the cotransfection experiments in COS-1 cells were fully supported by experiments carried out in HEp-2 and T98G cells in which the nuclear 78-kDa MxB protein was produced in response to IFN-α stimulation. In IFN-α-treated cells, the chimeric HA1-MxB(83–715) protein was found in the nucleus, indicating that endogenous, IFN-α-induced MxB protein cotransported the transfected cytoplasmic MxB protein into the nucleus. Similarly, if the C-terminal leucine zipper element was removed, no nuclear cotransport was taking place (Figs. 2 and 3 B), further supporting the view that the leucine zipper element is crucial for oligomerization. However, in a minority of cells (2–5%), some fluorescence was found in the cell nucleus even if the chimeric protein lacked the C-terminal leucine zipper element. It is possible that some other parts of the MxB protein can mediate weak oligomerization, as has been suggested to be the case in human MxA and murine Mx1 proteins (30Ponten A. Sick C. Weeber M. Haller O. Kochs G. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 2591-2599Crossref PubMed Google Scholar,31Nakayama M. Yazaki K. Kusano A. Nagata K. Hanai N. Ishihama A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 15033-15038Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It has to be pointed out that, in using LipofectAMINE transfection system in COS-1 cell cotransfections, nearly all the transfected cells expressed both transfected gene products such as MxA and MxB proteins (from 80 to 95%, data not shown). Therefore, it is also likely that practically all the cells, transfected with different MxB gene constructs, expressed both forms of MxB protein. However, formally, we could not control the cotransfection frequency since MxB-specific antibodies recognized both the tagged and untagged forms of MxB protein. Cell fractionation studies further supported, at a more quantitative level, the idea that the cytoplasmic MxB protein was cotransported into the nucleus with the nuclear form of MxB protein (Fig. 4). In two studied cell types, namely primary human macrophages and T98G glioblastoma cells, at least 50% of the nuclear MxB immunoreactivity was of the shorter 76-kDa cytoplasmic form. These two types of cells were used since they express both MxA and MxB proteins, and thus MxA-specific immunostaining functioned as a control for the purity of the isolated nuclei. In the nuclei hardly any MxA protein was seen. We have previously shown that human MxA protein as well as Mx proteins from other mammalian species could be chemically cross-linked to dimers, trimers, and larger oligomers both in vivo and in vitro (21Melén K. Ronni T. Broni B. Krug R.M. von Bonsdorff C.-H. Julkunen I. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 25898-25907Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We and others have also demonstrated that the C-terminal parts of Mx protein, including the leucine zipper element, are responsible for the oligomerization of homotypic Mx proteins (21Melén K. Ronni T. Broni B. Krug R.M. von Bonsdorff C.-H. Julkunen I. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 25898-25907Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar,30Ponten A. Sick C. Weeber M. Haller O. Kochs G. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 2591-2599Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Our previous experiments with murine Mx1 protein (21Melén K. Ronni T. Broni B. Krug R.M. von Bonsdorff C.-H. Julkunen I. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 25898-25907Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and the present experiments with human MxB protein indicate that the C-terminal leucine zipper element is an essential one in mediating the homo-oligomerization of Mx proteins. Cotransport experiments with transfected MxA and MxB proteins (results not shown) as well as the cell fractionation studies gave no indication that MxA protein would be transported into the nucleus with the nuclear form of MxB protein or that hetero-oligomers between MxA and MxB proteins would form. Quantitatively equal expression levels of MxA and MxB proteins (3Melén K. Keskinen P. Ronni T. Sareneva T. Lounatmaa K. Julkunen I. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 23478-23486Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar) also allowed us to reliably analyze their possible colocalization in primary human leukocytes. Using confocal laser microscopy, only MxB protein was found in the nucleus, whereas both MxA and MxB proteins were found in a granular fashion in the cytoplasm with some colocalization (Fig.5 A, b). This minimal colocalization was possibly due to a high expression level of these proteins and their accumulation in the same or similar cytoplasmic network-like structures (Fig. 5). We believe that, even though MxA and MxB proteins have a C-terminal leucine zipper element, they are not able to form any hetero-oligomers with each other either in the nucleus or cytoplasm. Amino acid sequence analysis of the C-terminal ends of Mx proteins reveal that there are certain differences in the leucine repeats of MxB protein as compared with MxA protein. There are phenylalanine and isoleucine residues in MxB protein instead of leucines in the first and fourth positions of the leucine zipper element, respectively. It is possible that sequences apart from leucine zipper elements take part in the oligomerization, which only enables homo-oligomerization. Our results clearly demonstrate that IFN-α-inducible human MxB proteins interact with each other via the C-terminal leucine zipper element, and oligomers with at least one NLS are transported into the cell nucleus, with the rest being destined to other structures in the cell cytoplasm. In the present study, we demonstrate a novel cotransport mechanism for the cytoplasmic human MxB protein. This includes a tight interaction between the leucine zipper elements of different molecules, followed by a “piggyback” ride of the cytoplasmic MxB protein with the nuclear form into the cell nucleus. This could enable a regulated transport mechanism of the cytoplasmic MxB protein into the nucleus depending on the tissue-specific relative expression level of the nuclear and cytoplasmic forms of MxB protein. However, a remaining question is the cellular function of MxB protein. Is it an antiviral protein against so far undetected viruses that have maturation steps both in the cell nucleus and cytoplasm, or has it some other profound effects on intracellular molecular traffic or cellular metabolism?

One proposal is that MgATP-dependent phosphatase is a significant cytoplasmic form of PP1. Results using PP1 expressed in bacteria led to another proposal that Inh2 functions as a molecular “chaperone” for folding newly synthesized PP1 into a biologically active conformation (26Alessi D.R. Street A.J. Cohen P. Cohen P.T.W. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 213: 1055-1066Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar, 27MacKintosh C. Garton A.J. McDonnell A. Barford D. Cohen P.T.W. FEBS Lett. 1996; 397: 235-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). On the other hand, the amount of Inh2 protein and heat-stable inhibitory activity against PP1 were found to oscillate during the cell cycle in rat embryo fibroblasts, peaking during S phase and mitosis (28Brautigan D.L. Fernandez A. Lamb N.J.C. Adv. Protein Phosphatases. 1991; 6: 375-390Google Scholar, 29Brautigan D.L. Sunwoo J. Labbe J.C. Fernandez A. Lamb N.J.C. Nature. 1990; 344: 74-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar), suggesting a possible role for Inh2 in the cell division cycle. A similar cell cycle-dependent change in the amount of the yeast GLC8 protein has been reported (8Cannon J.F. Clemens K.E. Morcos P.A. Nair B.M. Pearson J.L. Khalil M. Adv. Protein Phosphatases. 1995; 9: 211-232Google Scholar).The green fluorescent protein (GFP) of jellyfish Aequorea victoria (30Ormo M. Cubitt A.B. Kallio K. Gross L.A. Tsien R.Y. Remington S.J.

Gene. 1992; 111: 229-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (1748) Google Scholar) has emerged as a unique tool for examining intracellular phenomena in living cells. Because GFP possesses an intrinsic fluorescence that does not require other cofactors and because the S65T mutant of GFP shows an enhanced brightness compared with the wild type protein, fusion proteins with GFPS65T provide a powerful system to analyze protein expression and distribution in living cells (32Chalfie M. Tu Y. Euskirchen G. Ward W.W. Prasher D.C. Science. 1994; 263: 802-805Crossref PubMed Scopus (5449) Google Scholar, 33Gerdes H.-H. Kaether C.

In the present study, we used a Inh2-GFP fusion protein to examine intracellular localization of Inh2 during G1 and S phases of the cell cycle.DISCUSSIONThis study examined the intracellular localization of Inh2 in living cells during G1 and S phases of the cell cycle using an Inh2-GFP fusion protein. Accumulation of Inh2-GFP from the cytoplasm into the nucleus occurred during S phase. GFP itself, expressed as a control, remained uniformly distributed in the cell throughout G1 and S phase. Mutations to eliminate phosphorylation of Inh2 at either Thr-72, or Ser-86, or Ser-120 and Ser-121 abolished nuclear localization during S phase. Differences in amino acid residues at positions immediately adjacent to a phosphorylation site (e.g. C85 in human versus Y85 in rabbit) do not affect nuclear import of Inh2, 2J. Somers, N. J. C. Lamb, and D. L. Brautigan, unpublished data. supporting the idea that the multisite phosphorylation of Inh2 is required for its cell cycle-dependent localization.Phosphorylation of Inh2 is cooperative, or “synergistic,” because reaction with CK2 at Ser-86 potentiated phosphorylation of Thr-72 by glycogen synthase kinase 3, making phosphorylation of Thr-72 highly sensitive to the extent of prior phosphorylation by CK2. Different proline-directed protein kinases, namely glycogen synthase kinase 3, CDK2, and mitogen-activated protein kinase, can phosphorylate Thr-72. Therefore, it is possible that mutation of Ser-86 prevented nuclear localization indirectly by interfering with efficient phosphorylation of Thr-72. We present evidence that Thr-72 was phosphorylated in living cells even in the triple mutant S(86/120/121)A. One might suspect, therefore, that the failure of the S86A mutant of Inh2-GFP to localize in the nucleus indicates a function for this site beyond simply promoting phosphorylation of Thr-72. In addition, the CK2 phosphorylation sites at S120/121 themselves might facilitate nuclear accumulation, parallel to the case of SV40 T antigen (see below). It seems that all of these phosphorylation sites in Inh2 contribute to and are required for nuclear localization during S phase.Cell cycle-dependent nuclear localization of Inh2 also depended on a basic sequence resembling a NLS. Because the molecular size of Inh2-GFP is 63 kDa, it seems unlikely that the distribution of this fusion protein was a result of simple diffusion between cytoplasm and nucleus (43Breeuwer M. Goldfarb D.S. Cell. 1990; 60: 999-1008Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar, 44Gorlich D. Mattaj I.W. Science. 1996; 271: 1513-1518Crossref PubMed Scopus (1062) Google Scholar). At residues 134–147 in Inh2, there is a sequence of two clusters of basic amino acids in a region of Inh2 that is related in sequence to c-fos (5Park I.-K. Roach P. Bondor J. Fox S.P. DePaoli-Roach A.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 944-954Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 22Holmes C.F.B. Kuret J. Chisholm A.A.K. Cohen P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1986; 870: 408-416Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Mutation of lysines 143 and 145 abolished nuclear localization of Inh2 during S phase. As a transcription factor, c-fos surely is imported into the nucleus, but its NLS has not been functionally defined. Maybe Inh2 and c-fos are similar in sequence in the region used as their NLS.There are several examples of nuclear import of proteins mediated by a NLS and regulated by phosphorylation. Undoubtedly the best known example is that of SV40 T antigen, which has a NLS with the sequence PKKKRKV (45Kalderon D. Roberts B.L. Richardson W.D. Smith A.E. Cell. 1984; 39: 499-509Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1854) Google Scholar). When this sequence is fused or conjugated to other proteins, it results in their accumulation in the nucleus. However, it has not been well appreciated that the rate of nuclear import mediated by this NLS is controlled by phosphorylation of two serine sites approximately 20 residues to the N-terminal side (46Rihs H.-P. Peters R. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 1479-1484Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of these serines by CK2 accelerated by 30-fold the rate of nuclear import of a SV40 T antigen-β galactosidase fusion protein (47Rihs H.-P. Jans D.A. Fan H. Peters R. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 633-639Crossref PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar). The spacing of the dual CK2 Ser phosphorylation sites and basic residues of the putative NLS in Inh2 matches that in large T antigen, so similar mechanisms may govern localization of these proteins. Phosphorylation of cyclin B also results in nuclear localization, which is critical for its function at G2/M in the cell cycle (48Li J. Meyer A.N. Donoghue D.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 502-507Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). The sites in cyclin B under cell cycle control are thought to be phosphorylated by CK2 and mitogen-activated protein kinase, an interesting parallel to Inh2. Other examples of phosphorylation-regulated nuclear import are the transcription factor SWI5 of S. cerevisiae and the v-Jun oncoprotein. Both proteins are localized in nuclei in their unphosphorylated forms. Phosphorylation of SWI5 by CDC28 kinase results in its displacement into the cytoplasm (49Moll T. Tebb G. Surana U. Robitsch H. Nasmyth K. Cell. 1991; 66: 743-758Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (413) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of v-Jun also is correlated to loss of nuclear localization (50Tagawa T. Kuroki T. Vogt P.K. Chida K. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 130: 255-263Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Thus, phosphorylation can be employed to enhance or to eliminate nuclear localization.The Inh2 kinase activity in cytosols increased between G1and S phase. Most of this activity was potently inhibited by heparin, a characteristic of CK2. The results fit together with the previous data showing that CK2 activity oscillates during the cell cycle, peaking at S phase (51Carroll D. Marshak D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 7345-7348Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Inh2 phosphorylated by these S phase cytosols or by purified CK2 gave several of the same major phosphopeptides. This is consistent with Ser-86, Ser-120, and Ser-121, the sites in Inh2 phosphorylated by CK2, being phosphorylated during S phase. Peptides 3 and 6 were not produced by purified CK2, but were prominent in Inh2 phosphorylated by cytosols from S phase cells. The PhosPepSort2 program (GCG Computer Group) predicts this map location for phosphopeptides containing Thr-72, and because peptide 6 was produced by both G1 and S phase cytosols, we suspect that Thr-72 is phosphorylated during throughout G1 and S phases. A remaining issue is the identity of the site in phosphopeptide 1, which was the major site phosphorylated by G1 phase cytosol. The change in localization of Inh2 at G1/S may involve inactivation of a kinase and the dephosphorylation of the site in phosphopeptide 1. Overall, the results contribute to the concept that CK2 is part of a signaling system that regulates the nuclear import of multiple proteins at G1/S (reviewed in Refs. 52Litchfield D.W. Luscher B. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 1993; 127/128: 187-199Crossref Scopus (160) Google Scholar and53Meisner H. Czech M.P. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1991; 3: 474-483Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar).What might be the biological function of the nuclear accumulation of Inh2 at G1/S? One possibility is that it inhibits PP1, which dephosphorylates the retinoblastoma protein Rb in the nucleus throughout the G1 period (54Nelson D.A. Krucher N.A. Ludlow J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 4528-4535Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Recent evidence shows Rb-dependent cell cycle arrest at G1/S in cells loaded with a PP1 mutant that lacks an inhibitory phosphorylation site at T320 (55Berndt N. Dohadwala M. Liu C.W. Curr. Biol. 1997; 7: 375-386Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Inhibition of nuclear PP1 by an influx of Inh2 plus CDK phosphorylation of T320 could form a double shut-off system for PP1. Inhibition of PP1 coupled to activation of cyclin D:CDK4 would be a potent means to produce abrupt phosphorylation of Rb, which is recognized as a key step for entry into S phase (reviewed in Ref.56Weinberg R.A.

Nature. 1990; 344: 74-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar), suggesting a possible role for Inh2 in the cell division cycle. A similar cell cycle-dependent change in the amount of the yeast GLC8 protein has been reported (8Cannon J.F. Clemens K.E. Morcos P.A. Nair B.M. Pearson J.L. Khalil M. Adv. Protein Phosphatases. 1995; 9: 211-232Google Scholar). The green fluorescent protein (GFP) of jellyfish Aequorea victoria (30Ormo M. Cubitt A.B. Kallio K. Gross L.A. Tsien R.Y. Remington S.J.

Gene. 1992; 111: 229-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (1748) Google Scholar) has emerged as a unique tool for examining intracellular phenomena in living cells. Because GFP possesses an intrinsic fluorescence that does not require other cofactors and because the S65T mutant of GFP shows an enhanced brightness compared with the wild type protein, fusion proteins with GFPS65T provide a powerful system to analyze protein expression and distribution in living cells (32Chalfie M.

In the present study, we used a Inh2-GFP fusion protein to examine intracellular localization of Inh2 during G1 and S phases of the cell cycle. DISCUSSIONThis study examined the intracellular localization of Inh2 in living cells during G1 and S phases of the cell cycle using an Inh2-GFP fusion protein. Accumulation of Inh2-GFP from the cytoplasm into the nucleus occurred during S phase. GFP itself, expressed as a control, remained uniformly distributed in the cell throughout G1 and S phase. Mutations to eliminate phosphorylation of Inh2 at either Thr-72, or Ser-86, or Ser-120 and Ser-121 abolished nuclear localization during S phase. Differences in amino acid residues at positions immediately adjacent to a phosphorylation site (e.g. C85 in human versus Y85 in rabbit) do not affect nuclear import of Inh2, 2J. Somers, N. J. C. Lamb, and D. L. Brautigan, unpublished data. supporting the idea that the multisite phosphorylation of Inh2 is required for its cell cycle-dependent localization.Phosphorylation of Inh2 is cooperative, or “synergistic,” because reaction with CK2 at Ser-86 potentiated phosphorylation of Thr-72 by glycogen synthase kinase 3, making phosphorylation of Thr-72 highly sensitive to the extent of prior phosphorylation by CK2. Different proline-directed protein kinases, namely glycogen synthase kinase 3, CDK2, and mitogen-activated protein kinase, can phosphorylate Thr-72. Therefore, it is possible that mutation of Ser-86 prevented nuclear localization indirectly by interfering with efficient phosphorylation of Thr-72. We present evidence that Thr-72 was phosphorylated in living cells even in the triple mutant S(86/120/121)A. One might suspect, therefore, that the failure of the S86A mutant of Inh2-GFP to localize in the nucleus indicates a function for this site beyond simply promoting phosphorylation of Thr-72. In addition, the CK2 phosphorylation sites at S120/121 themselves might facilitate nuclear accumulation, parallel to the case of SV40 T antigen (see below). It seems that all of these phosphorylation sites in Inh2 contribute to and are required for nuclear localization during S phase.Cell cycle-dependent nuclear localization of Inh2 also depended on a basic sequence resembling a NLS. Because the molecular size of Inh2-GFP is 63 kDa, it seems unlikely that the distribution of this fusion protein was a result of simple diffusion between cytoplasm and nucleus (43Breeuwer M. Goldfarb D.S. Cell. 1990; 60: 999-1008Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar, 44Gorlich D. Mattaj I.W. Science. 1996; 271: 1513-1518Crossref PubMed Scopus (1062) Google Scholar). At residues 134–147 in Inh2, there is a sequence of two clusters of basic amino acids in a region of Inh2 that is related in sequence to c-fos (5Park I.-K. Roach P. Bondor J. Fox S.P. DePaoli-Roach A.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 944-954Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 22Holmes C.F.B. Kuret J. Chisholm A.A.K. Cohen P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1986; 870: 408-416Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Mutation of lysines 143 and 145 abolished nuclear localization of Inh2 during S phase. As a transcription factor, c-fos surely is imported into the nucleus, but its NLS has not been functionally defined. Maybe Inh2 and c-fos are similar in sequence in the region used as their NLS.There are several examples of nuclear import of proteins mediated by a NLS and regulated by phosphorylation. Undoubtedly the best known example is that of SV40 T antigen, which has a NLS with the sequence PKKKRKV (45Kalderon D. Roberts B.L. Richardson W.D. Smith A.E. Cell. 1984; 39: 499-509Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1854) Google Scholar). When this sequence is fused or conjugated to other proteins, it results in their accumulation in the nucleus. However, it has not been well appreciated that the rate of nuclear import mediated by this NLS is controlled by phosphorylation of two serine sites approximately 20 residues to the N-terminal side (46Rihs H.-P. Peters R. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 1479-1484Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of these serines by CK2 accelerated by 30-fold the rate of nuclear import of a SV40 T antigen-β galactosidase fusion protein (47Rihs H.-P. Jans D.A. Fan H. Peters R. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 633-639Crossref PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar). The spacing of the dual CK2 Ser phosphorylation sites and basic residues of the putative NLS in Inh2 matches that in large T antigen, so similar mechanisms may govern localization of these proteins. Phosphorylation of cyclin B also results in nuclear localization, which is critical for its function at G2/M in the cell cycle (48Li J. Meyer A.N. Donoghue D.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 502-507Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). The sites in cyclin B under cell cycle control are thought to be phosphorylated by CK2 and mitogen-activated protein kinase, an interesting parallel to Inh2. Other examples of phosphorylation-regulated nuclear import are the transcription factor SWI5 of S. cerevisiae and the v-Jun oncoprotein. Both proteins are localized in nuclei in their unphosphorylated forms. Phosphorylation of SWI5 by CDC28 kinase results in its displacement into the cytoplasm (49Moll T. Tebb G. Surana U. Robitsch H. Nasmyth K. Cell. 1991; 66: 743-758Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (413) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of v-Jun also is correlated to loss of nuclear localization (50Tagawa T. Kuroki T. Vogt P.K. Chida K. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 130: 255-263Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Thus, phosphorylation can be employed to enhance or to eliminate nuclear localization.The Inh2 kinase activity in cytosols increased between G1and S phase. Most of this activity was potently inhibited by heparin, a characteristic of CK2. The results fit together with the previous data showing that CK2 activity oscillates during the cell cycle, peaking at S phase (51Carroll D. Marshak D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 7345-7348Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Inh2 phosphorylated by these S phase cytosols or by purified CK2 gave several of the same major phosphopeptides. This is consistent with Ser-86, Ser-120, and Ser-121, the sites in Inh2 phosphorylated by CK2, being phosphorylated during S phase. Peptides 3 and 6 were not produced by purified CK2, but were prominent in Inh2 phosphorylated by cytosols from S phase cells. The PhosPepSort2 program (GCG Computer Group) predicts this map location for phosphopeptides containing Thr-72, and because peptide 6 was produced by both G1 and S phase cytosols, we suspect that Thr-72 is phosphorylated during throughout G1 and S phases. A remaining issue is the identity of the site in phosphopeptide 1, which was the major site phosphorylated by G1 phase cytosol. The change in localization of Inh2 at G1/S may involve inactivation of a kinase and the dephosphorylation of the site in phosphopeptide 1. Overall, the results contribute to the concept that CK2 is part of a signaling system that regulates the nuclear import of multiple proteins at G1/S (reviewed in Refs. 52Litchfield D.W. Luscher B. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 1993; 127/128: 187-199Crossref Scopus (160) Google Scholar and53Meisner H. Czech M.P. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1991; 3: 474-483Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar).What might be the biological function of the nuclear accumulation of Inh2 at G1/S? One possibility is that it inhibits PP1, which dephosphorylates the retinoblastoma protein Rb in the nucleus throughout the G1 period (54Nelson D.A. Krucher N.A. Ludlow J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 4528-4535Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Recent evidence shows Rb-dependent cell cycle arrest at G1/S in cells loaded with a PP1 mutant that lacks an inhibitory phosphorylation site at T320 (55Berndt N. Dohadwala M. Liu C.W. Curr. Biol. 1997; 7: 375-386Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Inhibition of nuclear PP1 by an influx of Inh2 plus CDK phosphorylation of T320 could form a double shut-off system for PP1. Inhibition of PP1 coupled to activation of cyclin D:CDK4 would be a potent means to produce abrupt phosphorylation of Rb, which is recognized as a key step for entry into S phase (reviewed in Ref.56Weinberg R.A. Cell. 1995; 81: 323-330Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4295) Google Scholar).

The spacing of the dual CK2 Ser phosphorylation sites and basic residues of the putative NLS in Inh2 matches that in large T antigen, so similar mechanisms may govern localization of these proteins. Phosphorylation of cyclin B also results in nuclear localization, which is critical for its function at G2/M in the cell cycle (48Li J. Meyer A.N. Donoghue D.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Other examples of phosphorylation-regulated nuclear import are the transcription factor SWI5 of S. cerevisiae and the v-Jun oncoprotein. Both proteins are localized in nuclei in their unphosphorylated forms. Phosphorylation of SWI5 by CDC28 kinase results in its displacement into the cytoplasm (49Moll T. Tebb G. Surana U. Robitsch H.

What might be the biological function of the nuclear accumulation of Inh2 at G1/S?

https://openalex.org/W2053597586,"We previously showed the 25-kDa corneal keratan sulfate proteoglycan to be a translation product of the gene producing osteoglycin and proposed the name mimecan for this gene and its product. We also demonstrated three mimecan RNA transcripts using Northern blot analysis. In this report, we investigate the mechanisms accounting for these transcripts. Ribonuclease protection analysis and reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction of bovine corneal mRNA detected a mimecan transcript that lacked 278 base pairs of the 5′-untranslated region between residues 62 and 340. This splice variant represents the predominant form of mimecan mRNA in bovine cornea and sclera. It was also detectable in other bovine tissues as a minor transcript. Two additional cDNA clones that were isolated contained 398 bases of nucleotide sequence at the 3′-end of mimecan cDNA, not present in the published sequence. Ribonuclease protection analyses with the 3′-probe, which included the new sequence, allow detection of three RNA transcripts while 5′-probes recognized only two. These results indicate that the three canonical polyadenylation sites in the 3′-untranslated region of mimican mRNA are alternatively selected. Possible roles for this previously undetected degree of diversity of mimecan RNA isoforms transcribed in the same tissue are discussed."
https://openalex.org/W1990997400,"Two overlapping cDNAs encoding a novel sarcolemmal associated protein (SLAP) were isolated from a cardiac cDNA expression library by immunoscreening with anti-sarcolemmal antibodies. Further characterization of these clones showed that they belonged to a family of related cDNAs that potentially encode polypeptides of 37, 46, and 74 kDa designated SLAP1, SLAP2, and SLAP3, respectively. The SLAP3 transcript was ubiquitously expressed, whereas SLAP1 and SLAP2 transcripts were predominantly expressed in cardiac, soleus, and smooth muscle. SLAP was encoded by a single gene that mapped to chromosome 3p14.3–21.2, and the various transcripts are likely generated by alternative splicing. The primary structure of SLAP predicted that it would have large regions of coiled-coil structure including an 11-heptad acidic amphipathic α-helical segment.

The SLAPs define a new family of tail-anchored membrane proteins that exhibit tissue-specific expression and are uniquely situated to serve a variety of roles through their coiled-coil motifs. In muscle cells, the membrane, also referred to as the sarcolemma, invaginates at discrete intervals to form the transverse tubules that extend into the cell interior where they physically associate with the intracellular membranes of the sarcoplasmic reticulum (1Franzini-Armstrong C. Jorgensen A.O. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1994; 56: 509-534Crossref PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar). This specialized architecture of the membrane allows for the efficient coupling of membrane excitability to the contractile response in muscle cells. The depolarization of the sarcolemma leads to the activation of voltage sensors concentrated in the transverse tubules which trigger calcium release from the sarcoplasmic reticulum and initiate muscle contraction (2Catterall W.A. Cell. 1991; 64: 871-874Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar, 3McPherson P.S. Campbell K.P. J. Biol.

Rev. Biophys. Chem. 1989; 18: 333-364Crossref PubMed Scopus (445) Google Scholar). Although there are major differences in membrane composition between divergent cells, more subtle yet critical differences in molecular composition of the membrane have also been noted in cells originating from a common lineage. For example, the molecular components of cardiac sarcolemma have undergone significant alterations to adapt to the functional requirements of the cardiac cell when compared with its skeletal muscle counterpart. Unlike skeletal muscle, the heart cells require external calcium for excitation-contraction coupling. The cardiac voltage-gated calcium channel is adapted to allow calcium entry across the sarcolemmal membrane which then serves as the trigger for calcium release from intracellular stores of the sarcoplasmic reticulum (6Varadi G. Mori Y. Mikala G. Schwartz A. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 1995; 16: 43-49Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). The calcium that enters the cardiac cell is then extruded via an active sodium-calcium exchange mechanism that has been shown to be concentrated in the transverse tubules through association with ankyrin (7Frank J.S. Mottino G. Reid D. Molday R.S. Philipson K.D. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 117: 337-345Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar, 8Li Z.P. Burke E.P. Frank J.S. Bennett V. Philipson K.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 11489-11491Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Although the advent of molecular biological techniques has resulted in a wealth of information about membrane proteins with measurable biochemical activities, some of the minor components that may participate in major functions remain to be defined. For example, syntaxin, a neural tail-anchored membrane protein, has been shown to bind to the N-type calcium channel and localize it to the site of vesicle release (9Sheng Z.H. Rettig J. Cook T. Catterall W.A. Nature. 1996; 379: 451-454Crossref PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar, 10Kutay U. Hartmann E. Rapoport T.A. Trends Cell Biol. 1993; 3: 72-75Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar). This allows for rapid exocytosis of synaptic vesicles by localizing sites of calcium influx to where synaptic vesicles are docked. In an effort to understand some of the molecular components of the heart cell membrane, we had raised and characterized antibodies to highly purified sarcolemma (11Tuana B.S. Sunahara R.K. Murphy B.J. Pierce G.N. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1991; 1091: 236-2414Crossref PubMed Scopus (2) Google Scholar). By using these antibodies as probes to screen a cardiac cDNA expression library, two cDNAs were isolated that encoded a novel family of sarcolemmal associated proteins which we have termed SLAPs. 1The abbreviations used are: SLAP, sarcolemmal associated protein; DAPI, 4,6′-diamido-2-phenylindole; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; PCR, polymerase chain reaction; kb, kilobase pair(s); FISH, fluorescence in situ hybridization; nt, nucleotides; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; bp, base pair(s); MOPS, 4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acid. The SLAP proteins were predicted to contain an extended coiled-coil structure and a carboxyl-terminal transmembrane domain. Subcellular localization of SLAP reveals that they can reside not only in the cell membrane but also in intracellular compartments. Furthermore, the expression of SLAPs in diverse tissues implies that these proteins may serve important roles in protein-protein interactions through their coiled-coil motifs in membranes from different cell types. Total RNA was isolated from rabbit heart by the guanidine thiocyanate method (12Chirgwin J.M. Przybyla A.E. MacDonald R.J. Rutter W.J. Biochemistry. 1979; 18: 5294-5299Crossref PubMed Scopus (16652) Google Scholar), and the mRNA was then affinity purified by oligo(dT)-cellulose chromatography (13Aviv H. Leder P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1972; 69: 1408-1412Crossref PubMed Scopus (5183) Google Scholar). A rabbit heart cDNA expression library was constructed using λ gt-11 phage vector according to the manufacturer's instructions (Amersham Corp.). The cDNA synthesis was primed with oligo(dT). The final library contained 1 × 106 plaques of which 5 × 105 plaques were screened with antiserum raised to highly purified canine cardiac sarcolemma (11Tuana B.S. Sunahara R.K. Murphy B.J.

The two positive clones were subcloned into PTZ19R (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.). A second λ gt-11 library (4 × 105 plaque-forming units) was constructed from rabbit heart mRNA, but cDNA synthesis was primed with random hexamers (Life Technologies, Inc.). 250,000 plaques of this library were screened with a 366-bp AvaI/EcoRI insert from LD1 that was labeled with [α-32P]dCTP by the random primer method (Fig.1 A). Three positive clones from a tertiary screen (R3a, R4b, and R4t) were subcloned into Bluescript II KS (Stratagene). A kit for rapid amplification of cDNA ends was used to identify the 5′ ends of the smaller SLAP clones (Life Technologies, Inc.). The reverse transcriptase reaction was primed with an oligonucleotide (nt 2150–2133 of SLAP3), and another nested oligonucleotide (nt 2113–2093 of SLAP3) was used for the PCR reaction (University of Ottawa Biotechnology Institute). The rapid amplification of cDNA ends procedure was performed using total rabbit heart RNA as a substrate for cDNA synthesis and following the conditions outlined by the manufacturer. After two rounds of PCR, a product of approximately 600 bp was subcloned into the pCRII vector using the TA cloning kit (Invitrogen). Human SLAP was isolated by screening a human cardiac λ Zap cDNA library (Stratagene) with a 1.1-kb EcoRI/XbaI fragment from the rabbit LD1 clone as a probe (Fig. 1 A). ExoIII/S1 nuclease deletions (Promega) of the various clones were made. Single-stranded DNA was isolated from deletions of LD1 and LD2, and double-stranded plasmid DNA was isolated (Qiagen) from the deletions of the other clones (R3a, R4b, and R4t). The deletions were sequenced on both strands by the dideoxy chain terminator method (14Sanger F. Nicklen S. Coulson A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 5463-5467Crossref PubMed Scopus (52771) Google Scholar) using Sequenase (Amersham Corp.). Areas of sequence not adequately covered by deletions were resolved by sequencing with specific internal primers (University of Ottawa Biotechnology Institute). Sequence analysis was performed using the Genetics Computer Group program, BLAST WWW server (15Altschul S.F. Gish W. Miller W. Myers E.W. Lipman D.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 215: 403-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (71458) Google Scholar), PSORT E-mail server (16Nakai K. Kaneshia M. Genomics. 1992; 14: 897-911Crossref PubMed Scopus (1368) Google Scholar), SeqaidII (University of Kansas), and the Coils analysis program (17Lupas A. Van Dyke M. Stock J. Science. 1991; 252: 1162-1164Crossref PubMed Scopus (3483) Google Scholar). Rabbit tissues (brain, heart, soleus (slow twitch), and longitudinus dorsi (fast twitch)) were excised and snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen until use. Total RNA from the tissues was isolated by using Trizol Reagent (Life Technologies, Inc.) following the manufacturer's protocol. Aliquots of total RNA (20 μg/lane) were electrophoresed through formaldehyde agarose gels and blotted onto Magna nylon membranes (MSI) (18Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). The various SLAP restriction fragments were radiolabeled with [α-32P]dCTP by the random primer method and used to hybridize to the filters. After washing twice at low stringency (0.1% SDS, 1 × SSPE, 25 °C) the blots were washed twice at high stringency (0.1% SDS, 0.1 × SSPE, 65 °C). The blots were then exposed to Kodak Biomax MR films for 1–3 days at −70 °C with intensifying screen. A SLAP fusion protein was created by ligating a 1.1-kb blunted EcoRI/XbaI insert from LD1 to a blunted BamHI/XbaI pMAL-cRI vector (New England Biolabs). This ligation ensured that the SLAP sequence was fused in-frame to the maltose binding protein domain of the vector. The SLAP fusion protein contained the carboxyl 370 amino acids of SLAP3. DH5α bacteria containing the recombinant protein were lysed by sonication, and then the protein was affinity purified on an amylose affinity column as specified by the manufacturer (New England Biolabs). The purified fusion protein was injected into guinea pigs and rabbits. Total soluble protein (50 mg) from a cell lysate of DH5α transformed with the pMAL-cRI vector alone was attached to an Affi-Gel-15 matrix (Bio-Rad) following manufacturer's protocol. Purified SLAP fusion protein (5 mg) was attached to another Affi-Gel-15 column. Crude guinea pig anti-SLAP antiserum (1 ml) was diluted 1:10 with 10 mm MOPS buffer (pH 7.4) and passed three times over the control cell lysate column to remove any maltose binding protein-specific antibodies. The cleared antiserum was then passed three times over the SLAP fusion column. The column was washed extensively with 10 mm MOPS (pH 7.4) and then with Tris-buffered saline containing 0.05% Tween (TBS-T). The specifically bound antibodies were eluted with 0.1 mglycine (pH 2.5) and immediately neutralized with 0.1 volume of 1m MOPS (pH 8.0). Fusion protein production in the LD1 λ gt-11 clone was induced, and the phage proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose filters (19Young R.A. Davis R.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1983; 80: 1194-1198Crossref PubMed Scopus (1288) Google Scholar). After blocking with 5% Carnation milk in TBS-T for 1 h, the filters were incubated with anti-sarcolemmal antibodies for 3 h at room temperature. The filters were then washed three times with TBS-T to remove nonspecific antibodies. Each filter was then washed for 2 min with 2 ml of elution buffer (5 mm glycine (pH 2.3), 150 mm NaCl, 10 mg of bovine serum albumin/ml, 0.3% Tween). The solution containing the eluted antibodies was immediately neutralized with 1 m Tris (pH 9.5) until the pH was 8.0. Crude and purified rabbit cardiac sarcolemmal membranes were isolated as described previously (20Tuana B.S. Murphy B.J. Yi Q. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 1987; 76: 173-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Membrane proteins were subjected to electrophoresis in a highly porous SDS-PAGE system which permits rapid and efficient transfer of proteins to nitrocellulose while maintaining a broad degree of resolution (21Doucet J.-P. Murphy B.J. Tuana B.S. Anal. Biochem. 1990; 190: 209-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). The proteins, resolved on gels, were electrophoretically transferred to nitrocellulose membranes (22Towbin H. Staehelin T. Gordon J. Proc. Natl. Acad. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 4350-4354Crossref PubMed Scopus (44939) Google Scholar). The affinity purified guinea pig anti-(SLAP) antibodies were used at a dilution of 1:5000, and the reaction developed with alkaline phosphatase-conjugated anti-guinea pig IgG (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories). Crude cardiac sarcolemmal membranes (5 mg) were pelleted for 1 h at 180,000 × g and then resuspended in one of the following buffers: phosphate-buffered saline (PBS); PBS with 1 mm EGTA; PBS with 1 m KCl; PBS with 4m urea, 150 mm NaCl, and 50 mmglycine (pH 3.0); PBS with 150 mm NaCl and 50 mm glycine (pH 10); and PBS with 1% Triton X-100. The resuspended pellets were incubated at 4 °C for 1 h with constant mixing and centrifuged at 180,000 × g for 1 h. Equal volumes of samples of the pellets (resuspended in 4 ml of PBS) and the supernatants were resolved on 10% SDS-PAGE gels, transferred to nitrocellulose, and analyzed by immunoblotting with the purified anti-SLAP antibodies as described above. A MYC-tagged SLAP protein was constructed by subcloning BglII/XbaI-digested SLAP3 restriction fragment (encoded all of SLAP1, SLAP2, and from amino acid 184 of SLAP3) into the six repeat human MYC epitope of Bluescript KS+ MYC-tagged vector (23Roth M.B. Zahler A.M. Stolk J.A. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 115: 587-596Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar). The cDNA encoding the fusion protein was excised with the appropriate restriction enzymes (KpnI/XbaI) and subcloned into pCDNA3 (Invitrogen). The SLAP coding sequence including the first ATG was PCR-amplified with IVITRO (5′-ggctcgagGTCTAACGCTTGTGAAGGCAG-3′) and TM3′ (5′-ggaattcCTCTTTACAGACAGATAC-3′) using SLAP3 construct as template. The PCR product was digested with XhoI/EcoRI and cloned into XhoI/EcoRI-digested pBluescript II KS+ to make the ATG1 plasmid. The ATG2 plasmid (which only contained the second ATG) was constructed by subcloning the KpnI/EcoRI restriction fragment of SLAP3 into KpnI/EcoRI-digested pBluescript II KS+. The two SLAP plasmids were linearized, and full-length SLAP was transcribed using T3 RNA polymerase. One μg of RNA was used to program a rabbit reticulocyte lysate (Promega) in the presence of [35S]methionine. Diethylpyrocarbonate-treated water and a luciferase transcript were used as negative and positive controls. Equal aliquots of each reaction were analyzed by SDS-PAGE followed by autoradiography. P19 embryonal carcinoma cells were cultured in α-minimum essential medium supplemented with 7.5% donor bovine serum and 2.5% fetal bovine serum (Cansera). P19 cells were transfected with the 6MYC-SLAP plasmid DNA, and stable transfectants were selected in G418 as described previously (24Pratt M.A.C. Kralova J. McBurney M.W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 6445-6453Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Immunofluorescence studies of cultured P19 cells was performed as described previously (25Staines W.A. Morassutti D.J. Reuhl K.R. Ally A.I. McBurney M.W. Neuroscience. 1994; 58: 735-751Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Anti-human MYC monoclonal antibody 9E10 was diluted 1:50 in 10 mm PBS containing 0.3% Triton X-100 (26Evan G.I. Lewis G.K. Ramsay G. Bishop J.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1985; 5: 387-402Crossref Scopus (2166) Google Scholar). CY3-conjugated sheep anti-mouse secondary antiserum (Sigma) was diluted 1:100 in 10 mm PBS, 0.3% Triton X-100. The cells were examined by using an upright Leica confocal scanning laser microscope equipped with a 55-milliwatt krypton/argon air-cooled laser and a 63 × Plan Apo oil immersion lens. The negative control for immunofluorescence studies was either mock-transfected P19 cells or P19 cells transfected with empty pCDNA3 vector. After decapitation, rat hearts were removed and immediately frozen in powdered dry ice. Sections were cut at a thickness of 4 μm on a cryostat and then fixed for 5 min using a fixative consisting of 4% (w/v) paraformaldehyde and 12% (v/v) saturated picric acid in 160 mm sodium phosphate buffer (pH 6.9). After rinsing, the sections were incubated in either a 1:400 dilution of rabbit anti-SLAP antiserum or a 1:100 dilution of affinity purified rabbit anti-dystrophin antiserum raised to the carboxyl terminus of dystrophin (27Meng H. Leddy J.J. Frank J. Holland P. Tuana B.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 12364-12371Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar) overnight at 4 °C. Primary antibodies were applied to the slide-mounted sections in 10 mm sodium phosphate buffer containing 0.3% Triton X-100. Sections were rinsed in PBS and then incubated with a 1:25 dilution of fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled donkey anti-rabbit (Amersham Corp.). Slides were coverslipped using a mounting medium of PBS containing phenylaminediamine (0.1 mm) and 90% glycerol and examined using a Zeiss Axioplan microscope with a 100 × oil immersion lens. Rabbit blood genomic DNA was purified as described previously (18Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). 20 μg of purified genomic DNA was digested with the indicated restriction enzymes and size-fractionated on a 0.75% 1 × TBE agarose gel. After size fractionation the DNA was denatured with alkali, neutralized, and transferred to Magna nylon membranes (MSI). A 366-bp EcoRI/AvaI fragment from LD1 was radiolabeled with [α-32P]dCTP by the random primer method. After overnight hybridization the blots were washed twice at low stringency (0.1% SDS, 1 × SSPE, 25 °C) and twice at high stringency (0.1% SDS, 0.1 × SSPE, 65 °C). The blots were then exposed to Kodak Biomax MR films for 1–3 days at −70 °C with intensifying screen. Human lymphocytes were cultured in α-minimum essential medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum and phytohemagglutinin at 37 °C for 68–72 h. The cultures were treated with bromodeoxyuridine (0.18 mg/ml Sigma) to synchronize the cell population. The synchronized cells were washed three times with serum-free medium to release the block and recultured at 37 °C for 6 h in α-minimum essential medium with thymidine (2.5 μg/ml). Cells were harvested and fixed on slides for FISH analysis. FISH detection was as described previously (28Heng H.H.Q. Squire J. Tsui L.-C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 9509-9913Crossref PubMed Scopus (521) Google Scholar). Essentially, slides were baked at 55 °C for 1 h. After RNase treatment, the slides were denatured in 70% formamide and 2 × SSC for 2 min at 70 °C followed by ethanol dehydration. Human SLAP probe was biotinylated with dATP using the Life Technologies, Inc., BioNick labeling kit and denatured at 75 °C for 5 min in a hybridization mix consisting of 50% formamide and 10% dextran sulfate. The slides were incubated with the probes overnight, washed, and analyzed. FISH signals and DAPI banding pattern was recorded separately by photography, and assignment of the FISH mapping data with chromosomal bands was achieved by superimposing the FISH signals with the DAPI-banded chromosomes as described previously (29Heng H.H.Q. Tsui L.-C. Chromosoma. 1993; 102: 325-332Crossref PubMed Scopus (431) Google Scholar). Antibodies to highly purified canine sarcolemma were raised and characterized previously (11Tuana B.S. Sunahara R.K. Murphy B.J. Pierce G.N. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1991; 1091: 236-2414Crossref PubMed Scopus (2) Google Scholar). This antisera was used to screen a rabbit heart λ gt-11 cDNA expression library to isolate cDNAs encoding molecular components of the sarcolemma. Two immunoreactive clones (LD1 and LD2) were isolated, subcloned, and sequenced. The two independent cDNAs shared 100% identity over a 900-bp overlap (Fig. 1 A). Both clones were polyadenylated but at different sites since each had poly(A) tails and putative polyadenylation signals within 20 bp of the site of polyadenylation (Fig. 1 B). To obtain the full-length sequence, a 366-bp EcoRI/AvaI fragment from LD1 was used to screen a randomly primed rabbit heart λ gt-11 cDNA expression library. Three overlapping clones R3a, R4b, and R4t were isolated from this screening (Fig. 1 A). The resulting sequence obtained from the overlapping clones LD1, LD2, R3a, R4b, and R4t was designated to encode sarcolemmal associated protein (SLAP) (Fig. 1 A). The SLAP cDNA had a large 5′-untranslated region of 757 ns and an even larger 3′-untranslated region of 1751 nt (Fig. 1 A). A large open reading frame extended from position 209 to 2675. There was a potential in-frame start codon at nucleotide 362, but it showed very poor agreement with the Kozak consensus start site (30Kozak M. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 108: 229-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (2810) Google Scholar). If this methionine was utilized, the predicted protein would be 89 kDa. The methionine codon which agreed very well with the Kozak consensus site was found at position 758, and if this was considered to be the initiating methionine the predicted polypeptide would be 639 amino acids in length and have a molecular mass of 73.7 kDa. However, to discern whether these two start sites can be effectively used an in vitro transcription/translation reaction was performed using two expression constructs. One construct utilized the methionine at 362 and the other only used the methionine at 758. Fig.2 shows that construct using the second in-frame methionine (Kozak consensus) produced a protein migrating with apparent molecular mass of 81 kDa in SDS-PAGE. The construct containing the first ATG (non-Kozak consensus) produced a protein of 94 kDa but much less effectively. Thus, although both ATGs can be used, the preferred initiator is likely to be at position 758 based on these data. The second ATG was considered to be the initiating methionine for the SLAP protein. The predicted protein would be acidic with a calculated pI of 4.9. The negatively charged amino acids were not evenly dispersed throughout the protein with the majority being in the carboxyl-terminal 370 amino acids of the protein. A hydropathy plot (31Kyte J. Doolittle R.F. J. Mol. Biol. 1982; 157: 105-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (17297) Google Scholar) illustrated that the SLAP protein was highly hydrophilic except for its carboxyl-terminal tail (amino acids 612–637) which several algorithms predicted could be a potential transmembrane domain (32Klein P. Kanehisa M. DeLisi C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1985; 815: 468-476Crossref PubMed Scopus (629) Google Scholar,33Rao J.K.M. Argos P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1986; 869: 197-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (408) Google Scholar). However, the PSORT sequence analysis program predicted that SLAP would not contain a potential signal sequence (16Nakai K. Kaneshia M. Genomics. 1992; 14: 897-911Crossref PubMed Scopus (1368) Google Scholar). Analysis with a coiled-coil prediction program, COILS, revealed that large segments of SLAP protein could potentially adapt a coiled-coil structure (17Lupas A. Van Dyke M. Stock J. Science. 1991; 252: 1162-1164Crossref PubMed Scopus (3483) Google Scholar). Furthermore, two regions (amino acids 465–493 and 514–535) were predicted to be potential leucine zippers, a specialized form of the coiled-coil motif where a leucine is found at every seventh amino acid (Fig. 1 B) (34O'Shea E.K. Rutkowski R. Kim P.S. Science. 1989; 243: 538-542Crossref PubMed Scopus (698) Google Scholar, 35O'Shea E.K. Klemm J. Kim P.S. Abler T. Science. 1991; 254: 646-648Crossref PubMed Scopus (1281) Google Scholar). These two potential leucine zippers are likely part of an 11-heptad coiled-coil structure since of the 11 heptads the a positions are occupied by 8 non-polar residues (Ala, Cys, Trp, 4 Leu, and 1 Met) and 2 polar or charged residues (Ser and Arg), and at the d position 9 are non-polar residues (Leu) and 2 polar residues (Gln and Ser) (Fig.3). A helical wheel plot of this region showed an alignment of the hydrophobic residues at positions a and d of the α helix (Fig. 3). Five potential i + 3 and i + 4 intrahelical ionic attractions were found as well in this coiled-coil region. If SLAP homodimerized in a parallel manner then there would be two attractive and two repulsive interchain ionic interaction between the i and i′ + 5 positions (Fig. 3). If SLAP homodimerized in an anti-parallel fashion then there would be six repulsive and three attractive interchain ionic interactions. SLAP protein contained numerous putative phosphorylation sites for casein kinase II (20 sites), protein kinase C (12 sites), and a single putative cAMP-dependent protein kinase phosphorylation site (Fig.1 B). Two potential glycosylation sites were predicted as well (Fig. 1 B). If the first non-Kozak ATG was utilized for translation initiation, SLAP would still be without a signal sequence, and the additional amino-terminal sequence would not conform to the coiled-coil structure predicted for the rest of the polypeptide.Figure 3Acidic amphipathic nature of the leucine zipper region of SLAP. A helical wheel plot shows the alignment of hydrophobic residues at the a and d positions of the α helix in a segment (amino acids 432–538) that covers the two leucine zippers. Seven glutamates in a row line up at the gposition giving the helix an acidic face as well as the hydrophobic one given at positions a and d. Potential i + 3 and i + 4 intrahelical attractions are shown by solid arrows. Equal number of interhelical attractions (solid arrows) and interhelical repulsions (dashed arrows) would be predicted if SLAP homodimerized.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) A BLAST search of GenBank revealed that SLAP shared 44% overall sequence identity with TOPAP, a topographically graded antigen of the chick visual system (36Savitt J.M. Trisler D. Hilt D.C. Neuron. 1995; 14: 253-261Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). SLAP exhibited over 90% sequence identity at the nucleotide level with several expressed sequence tag clones from different human tissues (GenBank accession numbers N98679, N21213, AA136875, and D58115). These sequences are likely partial cDNAs of the human orthologue of SLAP. SLAP showed extended low level homology (25 - 30% at the amino acid level) with myosins and other coiled-coil proteins i"
https://openalex.org/W2016468092,"In this study, we have elucidated the molecular mechanisms underlying the expression of an acidic 41-kDa protein inherited as an autosomal dominant trait of the hair keratin pattern of about 5% of the human population. We show that this protein is a size variant of the large type I hair cortex keratin hHa1 due to a genetic polymorphism in the hHa1 gene. We detected a G-A substitution in the 5′ splice site of intron 6 of the h Ha1gene, which segregates with the 41-kDa protein phenotype in two pedigrees and is responsible for the formation of an abnormally spliced hHa1 mRNA species. The use of an alternative 5′ splice site leads to the retention of 41 nucleotides of the initial intron 6 sequences in the mature transcript. The open reading frame of the aberrant mRNA creates a premature stop codon immediately downstream of the mutation site. The resulting hHa1 protein variant, hHa1-t, is about 6-kDa smaller than the 47-kDa hHa1 hair keratin and lacks the complete nonhelical tail domain. We show that the tailless hHa1-t is functional, since both recombinant hHa1 and hHa1-t form identical keratin intermediate filaments when assembled in vitro with a type II hair keratin partner. This finding confirms the view of a noninvolvement of the keratin tail domain in filament assembly and explains the lack of a pathological hair phenotype in hHa1-t positive individuals.

Besides the large number of epithelial or soft α-keratins, the complex keratin multigene family also comprises the numerically smaller group of hard α-keratins. These keratins are involved in the formation of various hard, keratinized structures such as hairs, nails, claws, beaks, etc., and according to their most intensely investigated site of expression, are commonly termed hair keratins (for a recent review see Ref. 1Powell B.C. Rogers G.E. Jolles P. Zahn H. Höcker H. Formation and Structure of Human Hair. Birkhäuser Verlag, Basel, Switzerland1997: 59-148Crossref Google Scholar). One- and two-dimensional gel electrophoretic analyses of native hair keratins have shown that, independent of mammalian species, hair keratins are resolved into two subfamilies, each consisting of four distinct but closely spaced type I acidic (47–44 kDa) and type II basic to neutral (60–58 kDa) members designated Ha1-Ha4 and Hb1-Hb4, respectively (2Heid H. Werner E. Franke W.W. Differentiation. 1986; 37: 215-230Crossref Scopus (164) Google Scholar, 3Lynch M.H. O'Guin W.M. Hardy C. Mak L. Sun T.-T. J. Cell Biol. 1986; 103: 2593-2606Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar). Together with a minor hair keratin pair termed Hax/Hbx, the family of hair keratins is considered to be composed of 10 members (2Heid H. Werner E. Franke W.W. Differentiation. 1986; 37: 215-230Crossref Scopus (164) Google Scholar, 4Heid H.W. Moll I. Franke W.W. Differentiation. 1988; 37: 137-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar). This notion seemed to be confirmed by the molecular cloning of four type I mouse hair keratins, mHa1-mHa4, and four type II sheep wool keratins, for which the designation K2.9-K2.12 has been proposed (5Bertolino A.P.

Expression studies showed that follicular hair keratin synthesis is compartmentalized into the cuticle, in which apparently only one keratin pair is expressed, and the cortex, which exhibits the sequential expression of several pairs of keratins (7Winter H.

Recent investigation in our laboratory aimed at characterizing human hair keratins has shown that the hair keratin family is distinctly more complex than previously assumed. At present, the human type I subfamily comprises seven members (hHa1(9), hHa2 (10Rogers M.A. Nischt R. Korge B. Krieg T. Fink T.M. Lichter P. Winter H. Schweizer J. Exp.

Moreover, contrary to previous evidence, hair keratin expression in the follicle is not restricted to the trichocytes of the cuticle and the cortex but also occurs much earlier in matrix cells of the hair bulb (12Rogers M.A. Winter H.

Several earlier reports on one- and two-dimensional electrophoretic analyses of keratin extracts from human hairs repeatedly emphasized the occurrence of a rather prominent but unusual protein component that invariably migrated about 3–4 kDa below the collective of type I hair keratins (14Baden H.P. Lee L.D. Kubilus J.A. Am. J. Hum. Genet. 1977; 27: 472-477Google Scholar, 15Hrdy D.B. Baden H.P. Lee L.D. Kubilus J.A. Ludwig K.W. Am. J. Hum.

Remarkably, this low molecular weight component was observed only sporadically and seemed to be restricted to hair keratin patterns present in about five percent of the human population (15Hrdy D.B. Baden H.P. Lee L.D. Kubilus J.A. Ludwig K.W. Am. J. Hum. Genet. 1977; 29: 98-100PubMed Google Scholar,17Schimkat M. Baur M.P. Henke J. Hum. Genet. 1990; 85: 311-314Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). Systematic large scale family studies revealed that the protein component was inherited by autosomal dominant transmission, however, without the manifestation of a distinct hair phenotype (14Baden H.P. Lee L.D. Kubilus J.A. Am. J. Hum. Genet. 1977; 27: 472-477Google Scholar, 15Hrdy D.B. Baden H.P. Lee L.D. Kubilus J.A. Ludwig K.W. Am. J. Hum.

Despite the intriguing properties and expression characteristics of this protein, up until now no efforts were made regarding its molecular characterization. Therefore, in the course of our investigations on the elucidation of new members of the human hair keratin family, we felt that this hair-associated protein could not be left unconsidered. In the present study we show that the low molecular weight protein belongs to the hair keratins. It is, however, not a novel hair keratin but represents a truncated isoform of the large type I hair keratin hHa1, resulting from a 5′ donor splice site mutation in intron 6 of the hHa1 gene. Human hair clippings from male and female volunteers were washed with ethanol, dried, and minced to 2–3 mm in length. The material was homogenized in a glass-glass homogenizer in 8m urea, 2% SDS, 100 mmDTT, 2The abbreviations used are: DTT, dithiothreitol; bp, base pair(s); PCR, polymerase chain reaction; IF, intermediate filaments. 100 mmTris-HCl, pH 8.0, in the presence of a small amount of sterile quartz sand. The homogenate was incubated overnight at 37 °C, heated at 60 °C for 3 min, and centrifuged at 10,000 rpm for 5 min. The supernatant was recovered and used 1:1 diluted with SDS sample buffer. Recombinant human hair keratins hHa1, hHa1-t, and hHb3 were diluted from 9.5 m urea with 3 × SDS sample buffer. One-dimensional SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of total hair keratin preparations and recombinant hair keratins was carried out according to Laemmli (20Laemmli U. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207012) Google Scholar) in 10 or 12% gels. Parallel gels were stained with Coomassie Blue or were blotted electrophoretically onto nitrocellulose (BA85; Schleicher & Schuell). The membranes were blocked with 10% nonfat milk powder and 0.1% Tween in Tris-buffered saline for 1 h. Samples were incubated with primary keratin antibodies at a suitable dilution (see antibodies) for 1 h in Tris-buffered saline followed by three washes with Tris-buffered saline Tween for 20 min each. Peroxidase-coupled secondary goat antibodies to guinea pig or murine IgG (Dianova; Hamburg, Germany) were diluted 1:10,000 in 5% nonfat milk powder in Tris-buffered saline and applied for 1 h. Subsequently, specimens were washed three times for 20 min each. Secondary antibodies were detected by chemiluminescence (ECL; Amersham, Braunschweig, Germany). The in situ hybridization procedure was performed essentially as described (13Rogers M.A. Langbein L. Praetzel S. Moll I. Krieg T. Winter H. Schweizer J. Differentiation. 1997; 61: 187-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 21Langbein L. Heid H.W. Moll I. Franke W.W. Differentiation. 1994; 55: 57-71Crossref Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Briefly, plucked anagen hairs were immediately snap-frozen in isopentane and cooled with liquid nitrogen, and cryostat sections (5 μm) were mounted on sialinized glass slides. The hHa1 specific antisense cRNA probe was in vitro transcribed from a 1,040-bp cDNA subclone (9Fink P. Rogers M.A. Korge B. Winter H. Schweizer J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1264: 12-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar) containing the complete 3′-untranslated region using35S-CTP and T7-polymerase (Boehringer Mannheim). A 630-bp hHa1-t-specific probe of intron 6 of the hHa1 gene was generated by PCR with forward primer 5′-TGAGTACATGGGCAGACGTGTTTG-3′ and reverse primer 5′-AAAATCATATGCCAGAGATATCCC-3′ and cloned into pMOS Blue vector (Amersham). The antisense cRNA probe was synthesized by in vitro transcription with T7-polymerase and 35S-GTP. All probes were used in their full length without alkaline hydrolyzation. After prehybridization, hybridization was performed with freshly denatured labeled probes (∼2 ng/tissue section) at 45 °C for 12 h. Posthybridization washes were done in 2 × SSC (1 × SSC, 150 mm NaCl, 15 mm sodium citrate, pH 7.0), 50% formamide at 50 °C. Before the last washing step, specimens were treated with 20 μg/ml RNase A, 1 × SSC at 37 °C. Subsequently, slides were covered with photoemulsion (NTB2; Eastman Kodak Co.), routinely exposed for 2 days, and counterstained with hematoxylin. Negative controls included (a) hybridization with hybridization buffer only, (b) hybridization with labeled sense cRNA probes, and (c) hybridization of RNaseA-predigested tissue sections. For microscopic recording of the in situ hybridization signals, a confocal laser scanning microscope (LSM 410 UV; Carl Zeiss, Oberkochen/Jena, Germany) was used. The instrument allowed simultaneous visualization in epi-illumination for the detection of the hybridization signals and in transmitted light in bright field for hematoxylin staining. The two signal channels were combined with an overlay in false colors (transmission image in green channel electronically changed by the computer to black/white; reflection image in red). The indirect immunofluorescence procedure was carried out as described previously (21Langbein L. Heid H.W. Moll I. Franke W.W. Differentiation. 1994; 55: 57-71Crossref Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Human anagen hair follicles were plucked and immediately frozen in isopentane precooled with liquid nitrogen. Cryosections were fixed by immersion in methanol at −20 °C for 10 min. Specimens were air-dried and incubated with the primary antibodies for 45 min at room temperature. After washing with phosphate-buffered saline, specimens were incubated with the respective secondary anti-mouse or anti-guinea pig immunoglobulin antibodies coupled to Cy3 and diluted 1:300 (Dianova) for 45 min at room temperature. The specimens were washed thoroughly in phosphate-buffered saline, dipped in distilled water, and mounted in Elvanol. Micrographs were taken with a fluorescence microscope (Axiophot; Carl Zeiss) using identical processing parameters. All antibodies used were diluted in phosphate-buffered saline, 5% normal goat serum. Primary antibodies were pan type I hair keratin guinea pig antiserum gp19 (Ref. 4Heid H.W. Moll I. Franke W.W. Differentiation. 1988; 37: 137-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar; diluted 1:200 for immunofluorescence, 1:20,000 for Western blot), pan type II guinea pig antiserum gp16 (Ref. 4Heid H.W. Moll I. Franke W.W. Differentiation. 1988; 37: 137-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar; diluted 1:40,000 for Western blot), and hHa1-specific mouse monoclonal antibody LHTric-1 (Ref. 22Westgate G.E. de Berker D.

Elsevier Science Publishing Co., Inc., New York1996: 167-168Google Scholar; undiluted for immunofluorescence, diluted 1:500 for Western blot). Blood was drawn from consenting members of two pedigrees. Genomic DNA was prepared using the blood and tissue culture DNA extraction system (QIAGEN, Hilden, Germany). PCR was used to amplify segments of the type I hair keratin genes hHa1 and hHa5 (9Fink P. Rogers M.A. Korge B. Winter H. Schweizer J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1264: 12-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar, 12Rogers M.A. Winter H. Langbein L. Krieg T. Schweizer J. J. Invest. Dermatol. 1996; 107: 633-638Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar) that spanned the coding sequences for the terminal part of the α-helix, the entire carboxyl terminus including intron 6, and in the case of hHa5, the additional intron 7 (12Rogers M.A. Winter H. Langbein L. Krieg T. Schweizer J. J. Invest. Dermatol. 1996; 107: 633-638Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Amplification primers were designed from the hHa1 cDNA sequence ((9) EMBL accession number X86570: forward primer, 5′-TCACCAACGTGGAGTCCCAG-3′, nucleotide position 1006–1025; reverse primer, 5′-TGCATCCTTGCTCCTCTGGCA-3′, nucleotide position 1316–1336) and the hHa5 cDNA sequence ((12); EMBL accession number X90763: forward primer, 5′-TGGAGGCCCAGCTGGCCGAGAT-3′, nucleotide position 1128–1149; reverse primer, 5′-GCCTTTGTGACAGGCTCTGAGA-3′, nucleotide position 1460–1481). PCR was carried out with the Expand Long Template-PCR system (Boehringer Mannheim). After initial denaturation at 94 °C for 2 min, 30 cycles were performed consisting of 94 °C for 10 s, 60 °C for 30 s, and 72 °C for 2 min. Final extension was at 72 °C for 15 min. PCR-amplified products purified by agarose gel extraction were sequenced directly according to the Sequenase-PCR sequencing protocol (U. S. Biochemical) using either the PCR primers or gene-specific internal primers. RNA was extracted from the bulbs of about 10–15 freshly plucked anagen hair follicles using the RNeasy system (QIAGEN). Reverse transcription was performed with an oligo(dT) adaptor-primer and Superscript Reverse Transcriptase according to the manufacturer's instructions (Life Technologies, Inc.). Amplification of cDNA fragments with the hHa1-specific primer pair was carried out as described for PCR amplification of genomic DNA. Alternatively, the respective forward primer was replaced by the primer 5′-CAGTTACCAGTCCTATTTTAAG-3′ derived from exon 1 sequences of the hHa1 cDNA ((9), nucleotide position 356–377). cDNA fragments containing the complete coding sequence of either the type I hair keratin hHa1 or the type II hair keratin hHb3 were generated by PCR using the available cDNA clones for both keratins as template (9Fink P. Rogers M.A. Korge B. Winter H. Schweizer J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1264: 12-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar, 13Rogers M.A. Langbein L. Praetzel S. Moll I. Krieg T. Winter H. Schweizer J. Differentiation. 1997; 61: 187-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Each of the respective forward primers contained an EcoRI cloning site and a Shine-Dalgarno sequence upstream of the start codon (23Hofmann I. Franke W.W. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 72: 122-132PubMed Google Scholar). The reverse primer sequences were derived from the hHa1- and hHb3-specific 3′-untranslated regions following the stop codon, each containing a HindIII site for cloning. For the generation of the cDNA of the truncated hair keratin hHa1-t, total cDNA obtained by reverse transcription of hair follicle RNA of a hHa1-t positive individual was used as a template. Whereas the forward primer was the same as for hHa1 cDNA amplification, the reverse primer contained intron 6 sequences specifically retained in the hHa1t mRNA. The three cDNAs were cloned into the prokaryotic expression vector pDs5 (24Bujard H. Gentz R. Lanzer Stueber D. Mueller I. Ibrahimi I. Haeuptle M.T. Dobberstein B. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 155: 416-433Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar), sequenced to verify the integrity of the reading frame and expressed in E. coli. Bacterial clones producing hair keratins were identified by immunoblot analysis using the guinea pig antisera gp16, specific for type II hair keratins, or gp19, specific for type I hair keratins (4Heid H.W. Moll I. Franke W.W. Differentiation. 1988; 37: 137-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar). Bound primary antibodies were detected by the alkaline phosphatase system of Promega, Madison, WI. Production of cDNA-engineered hair keratins, their enrichment in the inclusion body fraction, and purification by column chromatography was performed according to Hofmann and Franke (23Hofmann I. Franke W.W. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 72: 122-132PubMed Google Scholar) with the following modifications. All buffers used for purification contained 2 mm DTT. After purification by the Q-Sepharose column (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.), keratin-containing fractions were pooled and dialyzed against 9.5 m urea, 30 mm sodium formiate (pH 4.0), 1 mm EDTA, 2 mm DTT for 1 h at room temperature and applied to a 15-ml S-Sepharose column (Pharmacia). Bound protein was eluted in a 100-ml gradient of guanidine HCl (0–0.6 m) in column buffer. Keratin-containing fractions were checked for purity by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and pooled. Equimolar amounts of purified type I and type II hair keratins were mixed in 9.5 m urea, 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 2.5 mm EDTA, 2 mm DTT. The urea concentration was gradually lowered by step-wise dialysis against 5 m urea and 2.5 murea, buffered with 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 2.5 mm EDTA, 2 mm DTT at room temperature. Assembly was induced by a final dialysis step against 160 mm NaCl, 25 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 2 mm DTT for 2 h at room temperature. The assembled protein material was analyzed by negative staining as described (25Renner W. Franke W.W. Schmid E. Geisler N. Weber K. Madelkow E. J. Mol. Biol. 1981; 149: 285-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar, 26Hofmann I. Herrmann H. Franke W.W. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 56: 328-341PubMed Google Scholar). In a large scale screening study, keratins were extracted from clipped hairs of 30 unrelated healthy male and female individuals. Upon one-dimensional electrophoresis, keratins from mature hairs were generally separated into two broad bands, one migrating between 59 and 54 kDa and comprising the members of the type II hair keratin subfamily, the other occurring between 48 and 44 kDa, harboring the type I subfamily (2Heid H. Werner E. Franke W.W. Differentiation. 1986; 37: 215-230Crossref Scopus (164) Google Scholar). However, the keratin patterns of two unrelated male individuals clearly exhibited the additional low molecular weight protein (see arrowheads in Fig.1 A, individual 2, and Fig. 1 B, individual 2). The protein possessed an estimated size of 41 kDa in our gel system, which is in good agreement with previous reports (14Baden H.P. Lee L.D. Kubilus J.A. Am. J. Hum. Genet. 1977; 27: 472-477Google Scholar, 15Hrdy D.B. Baden H.P. Lee L.D. Kubilus J.A. Ludwig K.W. Am. J. Hum. Genet. 1977; 29: 98-100PubMed Google Scholar, 16Marshall R.C. J. Invest.

Med. Biol. Res. 1996; 29: 1427-1429PubMed Google Scholar). Subsequent two-generation family hair keratin analyses of the 41-kDa-positive individuals confirmed the autosomal dominant transmission of the protein (Fig. 1,A and B). Light microscopic examination of plucked hairs did not reveal macroscopically visible differences between 41-kDa positive and negative individuals of both pedigrees. In several previous electrophoretic hair keratin analyses, a diminished protein staining in the high molecular weight part of the type I hair keratins was consistently noticed in hair keratin patterns containing the 41-kDa component (16Marshall R.C. J. Invest. Dermatol. 1980; 75: 264-269Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 18Yu J. Yu D.W. Checkla D.M. Freedberg I.M. Bertolino A.P. J. Invest.

This observation could be confirmed in pedigree A (Fig. 1), in particular by comparing the type I hair keratin pattern of the 41-kDa protein-negative individual 1 with those of the 41-kDa protein-positive individuals 2 and 3 (Fig.1 A). Moreover, Yu et al. (18Yu J. Yu D.W. Checkla D.M. Freedberg I.M. Bertolino A.P. J. Invest. Dermatol. 1993; 101: 56S-59SAbstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar) recently described a family in which both parents were positive for the 41-kDa protein. These individuals as well as two of their offsprings showed type I hair keratin patterns similar to those of individuals 2 and 3 of pedigree A (Fig. 1), whereas a third member of the F1 generation clearly lacked a high molecular weight type I hair keratin (18Yu J. Yu D.W. Checkla D.M. Freedberg I.M. Bertolino A.P. J. Invest. Dermatol. 1993; 101: 56S-59SAbstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Collectively, these data led us to hypothesize that the 41-kDa protein might be a size variant of a large type I hair keratin. Out of the seven human type I hair keratins recently cloned in our laboratory, the cortex keratin hHa1 and the matrix keratin hHa5 are the largest proteins, having calculated molecular weights of 47,378 Da and 47,727 Da, respectively (9Fink P. Rogers M.A. Korge B. Winter H. Schweizer J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1264: 12-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar, 12Rogers M.A. Winter H. Langbein L. Krieg T. Schweizer J. J. Invest. Dermatol. 1996; 107: 633-638Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Assuming alterations in the genes of these two keratins, they were subjected to mutation analyses. At the gene level, a possible relationship between the hHa1 or hHa5 hair keratin and the 41-kDa protein can most easily be explained by a mutational event leading to a premature stop codon in one of the candidate genes and entailing the loss of about 50 amino acid residues. Since the non-α-helical tail domains of hHa1 and hHa5 are almost equally long (49 and 47 amino acid residues, respectively (9Fink P. Rogers M.A. Korge B. Winter H. Schweizer J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1264: 12-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar, 12Rogers M.A. Winter H. Langbein L. Krieg T. Schweizer J. J. Invest. Dermatol. 1996; 107: 633-638Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar)), such a mutation should in both cases be located in the gene region encoding the transition between the α-helical rod domain and the carboxyl terminus. Therefore, genomic DNA fragments comprising the coding sequences of this region for both genes were amplified from blood DNA of 41-kDa protein-negative and -positive individuals of pedigrees A and B (Fig. 1) by means of hHa1- and hHa5-specific PCR primers. Since the genes of both keratins are known (partial hHa1 and hHa5 gene sequences (12Rogers M.A. Winter H. Langbein L. Krieg T. Schweizer J. J. Invest. Dermatol. 1996; 107: 633-638Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 27Bowden P.E. Hainey S. Parker G. Hodgins M.B. J. Dermatol. Sci. 1994; 7: 152S-163SAbstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar) and own data for the complete hHa1 and hHa5 genes),1 the size of the amplified genomic fragments could be predicted. Independent of the source of the DNA, amplification with the specific hHa5 primers yielded a fragment that corresponded to the calculated size of 780 bp and that contained sequences for intron 6 as well as for an additional intron 7 (12Rogers M.A. Winter H. Langbein L. Krieg T. Schweizer J. J. Invest. Dermatol. 1996; 107: 633-638Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). It should be emphasized that except for hHa5, type I hair keratin genes do not possess a 7th intron (Ref. 12Rogers M.A. Winter H. Langbein L. Krieg T. Schweizer J. J. Invest. Dermatol. 1996; 107: 633-638Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar1; similar to the epithelial type I keratin K9 (28Reis A. Hennies H.C. Langbein L. Digweed M. Mischke D. Drechsler M. Schrock Royer-Pokora B. Franke W.W. Sperling K. Kuster W. Nat. Genet. 1994; 6: 174-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar), the hHa5 7th intron is located in the 3′ noncoding region of the gene). Sequencing of the fragments did not reveal sequence variations between 41-kDa protein negative and positive individuals (results not shown). Amplification with the specific hHa1 primers yielded a fragment corresponding to the calculated size of 1007 bp that contained 677 bp of intron 6 (partial hHa1 gene sequence (27Bowden P.E. Hainey S.

In contrast to this conclusion, we show here that when ATP is loaded at a single catalytic site on nucleotide-depleted MF1, the rate of product release is accelerated by up to 5 × 104-fold by the binding of ATP at adjacent catalytic sites. Hence, nucleotide-depleted MF1 is not an exception but does in fact show strong cooperative interactions. In addition, evidence is presented supporting a random order for product release during ATP hydrolysis.

In addition, evidence is presented supporting a random order for product release during ATP hydrolysis. F0F1-ATP synthases are found embedded in the membranes of mitochondria, chloroplasts, and bacteria. During oxidative phosphorylation and photo-phosphorylation, the synthases couple the movement of protons down an electrochemical gradient to the synthesis of ATP. The F0 sector is composed of membrane-spanning subunits that conduct protons across the membrane (1Deckers-Hebestreit G. Altendorf K. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 1996; 50: 791-824Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar,2Fillingame R.H. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1996; 6: 491-498Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar), whereas the F1 sector is an extrinsic complex that contains catalytic sites for ATP synthesis (3Boyer P.D. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1997; 66: 717-749Crossref PubMed Scopus (1570) Google Scholar). F1 can be removed from the membrane in a soluble form and, once unplugged from the proton current, functions as an ATPase.A model for energy coupling by F0F1-ATP synthases that has gained considerable support is called the binding change mechanism. According to this proposal, the major energy requiring step is not the synthesis of ATP at the three catalytic sites on F1 but rather the simultaneous and highly cooperative binding of substrates to and release of product from these sites (4Boyer P.D. Cross R.L. Momsen W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1973; 70: 2837-2839Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar,5Kayalar C. Rosing J. Boyer P.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1977; 252: 2486-2491Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, the binding changes are believed to be coupled to proton transport by the rotation of a complex of subunits that extends through F0F1 (6Boyer P.D. Kohlbrenner W.E. Selman B. Selman-Reimer S. Energy Coupling in Photosynthesis. Elsevier Science Publishing Co., Inc., New York1981: 231-240Google Scholar), and a number of recent studies provide strong support for this concept (7Gogol E.P. Johnston E. Aggeler R. Capaldi R.A.

Perhaps most compelling has been the demonstration that during ATP hydrolysis at a single site on soluble mitochondrial F1(MF1), 1The abbreviations used are: MF1, solubilized ATPase portion of beef heart mitochondrial F0F1-ATP synthase; ndMF1, nucleotide-depleted MF1; BSA, bovine serum albumin; Mops, 4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acid. 1The abbreviations used are: MF1, solubilized ATPase portion of beef heart mitochondrial F0F1-ATP synthase; ndMF1, nucleotide-depleted MF1; BSA, bovine serum albumin; Mops, 4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acid. the rate of product release can be accelerated by up to 5 orders of magnitude upon binding substrate to adjacent catalytic sites (13Grubmeyer C.

In contrast to this view, Reynafarje and Pedersen (16Reynafarje B.D. Pedersen P.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 32546-32550Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar) recently presented kinetic studies of nucleotide-depleted MF1(ndMF1), which they interpret as evidence against the kind of strong positive catalytic cooperativity that has been observed in other laboratories using the native enzyme. Although ndMF1is known to have some altered properties, the lack of catalytic cooperativity would be difficult to reconcile with the binding change mechanism (12Boyer P.D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1140: 215-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (913) Google Scholar). In studies presented here, we have applied techniques that have successfully revealed details of subunit cooperativity in previous studies. The results demonstrate that like native MF1, ndMF1 exhibits strong positive cooperativity between catalytic sites.RESULTSUnder conditions where substoichiometric ATP can bind rapidly at one of the three catalytic sites on ndMF1 (SchemeFS1, Step 1), ATP hydrolysis exhibits an initial burst followed by a slow phase (Fig.1, circles). The rapid phase is due to the establishment of an equilibrium between bound substrate and bound products (Scheme FS1, Step 2), whereas the slow phase is due to product release (Scheme FS1, Step 3). The overall reaction (Scheme FS1, Steps 1–3), referred to as uni-site catalysis, is a very slow process limited by the rate of product release in Step 3. A brief incubation with a large excess of unlabeled ATP just prior to acid quenching (Fig. 1,squares) has two effects. First, upon binding ATP to additional catalytic sites, the release of radiolabeled product from the first site is accelerated (Scheme FS1, Step 3′). This is demonstrated by the fact that all of the bound [γ-32P]ATP is hydrolyzed during the chase. Second, it prevents any remaining unbound [γ-32P]ATP from binding. Because only a few percent of the “cold chase” ATP is hydrolyzed during the 5-s incubation, any remaining unbound [γ-32P]ATP would be trapped. The fact that all of the radiolabel appears as 32Pi in the cold chase indicates that the [γ-32P]ATP initially added had all bound to catalytic sites prior to the first time point shown and that none of it dissociated as radiolabeled ATP during the cold chase.Figure 1Hydrolysis of substoichiometric [γ-32P]ATP by ndMF1. ndMF1was incubated at 108 nm with 15 nm[γ-32P]ATP (4.2 × 105 cpm/pmol) in MTEMP buffer (MTEM buffer containing 2 mm Pi) containing 0.3 mg/ml BSA (final volume, 10 μl). Reaction was stopped at the time indicated by addition of 150 μl of 0.6 mHClO4 containing 4 mmNaH2PO4 (circles). In the cold chase samples (squares), 90 μl of 2.22 mm MgATP solution in MTEMP buffer containing 0.3 mg/ml BSA was added at the time indicated, followed 5 s later by 60 μl of 1.5 mHClO4 containing 10 mmNaH2PO4. After quenching, 60 μl of an activated charcoal suspension (50 mg/ml in 0.1 m HCl) was added, denatured protein and charcoal-absorbed nucleotides were removed by centrifugation for 4 min in an Eppendorf 5415 centrifuge at top speed, and 32Pi in 165 μl of the supernatant was determined by Cherenkov counting. Each point is an average of duplicate samples.

As a more direct means of assessing the ability of substrate binding at one site to promote product release from a second site, we used a Sephadex centrifuge column binding assay for the experiments reported in Figs. 2 and3. In Fig. 2, we follow the dissociation of 32Pi by measuring the amount of [γ-32P]ATP plus 32Pi remaining bound to a site initially loaded under uni-site conditions. The addition of low nanomolar concentrations of unlabeled ATP results in a measurable acceleration in the rate of release of32Pi. The same effect is observed when we follow the dissociation of [α-32P]ADP by measuring the amount of [α-32P]ATP and [α-32P]ADP remaining bound to a site also loaded under uni-site conditions (Fig.3). Acceleration of product release by ATP (Figs. 2 and 3) is due to nucleotide binding at remaining unoccupied catalytic sites because ATP binding to noncatalytic sites is too slow (23Milgrom Y.M. Cross R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 23179-23185Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) to occur to a significant extent during these experiments. Hence, the promotive effect of excess ATP on the rates of release of bound32Pi and [α-32P]ADP are a direct demonstration of positive catalytic cooperativity.Figure 2Effect of ATP binding at a second site on the rate of dissociation of 32Pi from an occupied site. ndMF1 was preincubated at 108 nmwith 15 nm [γ-32P]ATP (25.3 × 105 cpm/pmol) in MTEMP buffer containing 0.3 mg/ml BSA for 10 s.

A linear regression analysis gives a value of 10.6 ± 1.6 × 106m−1 s−1 for the ATP concentration dependence of the rate of product release. This is in agreement with the rate constant for ATP binding at a second site (Scheme FS1, k′ 1) determined from the rates of hydrolysis of nanomolar concentrations of ATP (data not shown). This correlation provides further evidence that ATP binding at one catalytic site promotes product release from an adjacent site.Figure 4ATP dependence of the observed rate of product release.

Values obtained for the ndMF1 preparation used in this study are presented in the first line of Table I. The results show that substrate binding can increase the rate of product release from a separate but interacting site by up to 50,000-fold under maximal velocity conditions. This is similar to the degree of rate acceleration previously observed for native MF1 (Table I, second line). For both forms of enzyme, this reflects exceptionally strong positive catalytic cooperativity.Table IThe acceleration of product release during multi-site catalysisEnzyme formUni-siteMulti-siteFold increases−1s−1ndMF11.5 × 10−27005 × 104Native MF1 aFrom Ref. 15.4 × 10−36001 × 1051-a From Ref. 15Cunningham D.

Open table in a new tab Additional information not related to subunit cooperativity can be derived from the experiments presented in Figs. Figure 1, Figure 2, Figure 3. First, the equilibrium constant, K 2, for Step 2(Scheme FS1) can be obtained from the initial “acid quench” and cold chase data points (Fig. 1) and is equal to 0.53. This value is identical to the K 2 value obtained under similar conditions with MF1 preparations containing endogenous nucleotides (13Grubmeyer C. Cross R.L. Penefsky H.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 12092-12100Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Second, the observed rate constant for the slow phase of [γ-32P]ATP hydrolysis (1.1 × 10−2 s−1, Fig. 1), is significantly higher than either of the observed rate constants for unpromoted product release (32Pi = 4.6 × 10−3 s−1, Fig. 2, and [α-32P]ADP = 6.8 × 10−3 s−1, Fig. 3). Instead, the ATP hydrolysis rate under uni-site conditions is equal to the sum of the product dissociation rates (i.e. (4.6 + 6.8) × 10−3 = 1.1 × 10−2 s−1) as expected if the dissociation of products occurs in random order. A similar conclusion can be made from a reassessment of data reported for native MF1 that contains endogenous nucleotides (13Grubmeyer C. Cross R.L. Penefsky H.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 12092-12100Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar,15Cunningham D. Cross R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 18850-18856Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).DISCUSSIONThe finding that nanomolar concentrations of ATP accelerate the rate of product release from a catalytic site on ndMF1initially loaded under uni-site conditions establishes two features of catalysis by this form of the enzyme. First, because the ATP-promoted rates of release of Pi and ADP equal the rate of ATP binding, it can be concluded that the enzyme is not subject to product inhibition. This is consistent with the presence of Pi in the buffer because Pi is known to significantly reduce MgADP inhibition of MF1 (24Yalamova M.V. Vasilyeva E.A. Vinogradov A.D. Biochem. Int. 1982; 4: 337-344Google Scholar, 25Drobinskaya I.Y. Kozlov I.A. Murataliev M.B. Vulfson E.N. FEBS Lett. 1985; 182: 419-424Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). It is also consistent with the fact that any endogenous inhibitory MgADP bound to the enzyme would have been removed during the preparation of ndMF1. Second, the results directly demonstrate positive catalytic cooperativity. This is in accordance with the binding change mechanism where the exergonic tight binding of cold chase ATP to an unoccupied catalytic site would be expected to drive the release of tightly bound product from an adjacent occupied site.These conclusions are in contrast to those reached by Reynafarje and Pedersen (16Reynafarje B.D. Pedersen P.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 32546-32550Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). They reported that under conditions for uni-site catalysis, the rate of substrate binding measured by a luciferase assay was equal to the rate of product release measured by a charcoal quench/centricon filtration assay during a 2-s incubation. Data presented in Figs. Figure 1, Figure 2, Figure 3 clearly show that this is not the case. One possible explanation of their results is that the addition of charcoal at 2 s in their assay for product release was ineffective in stopping uni-site catalysis. Although charcoal would prevent further binding of ATP, it would not be expected to prevent cleavage of enzyme-bound ATP with subsequent dissociation of products. Indeed, we found that unisite catalysis continued for up to 2 min in the presence of charcoal when we bound substoichiometric [γ-32P]ATP to F1 under conditions described for Fig. 1, incubated for 4 s, added a charcoal suspension (pH 7.5) in the amount used by Reynafarje and Pedersen, and continued incubation for various times before quenching with perchloric acid (data not shown). Hence, in the experiments of Reynafarje and Pedersen (see Table III of 16Reynafarje B.D. Pedersen P.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 32546-32550Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar), the true reaction time for Pidissociation may have been much longer than the 2 s reported.Additional details of our results warrant comment. First, ndMF1 shares a number of properties in common with native MF1. The rate of ATP binding, the equilibrium constant for interconversion of bound substrate and product, and the maximal acceleration of product release caused by substrate binding are all very similar for the two forms of the enzyme. One rather minor difference is the 4-fold faster rate of uni-site catalysis observed with ndMF1. Second, the finding that the rate of ATP cleavage during uni-site hydrolysis is equal to the sum of the product release rates indicates a random order release of ADP and Pi. This is consistent with previous evidence that ADP and Pi bind in a random order during ATP synthesis (5Kayalar C. Rosing J. Boyer P.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1977; 252: 2486-2491Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). F0F1-ATP synthases are found embedded in the membranes of mitochondria, chloroplasts, and bacteria. During oxidative phosphorylation and photo-phosphorylation, the synthases couple the movement of protons down an electrochemical gradient to the synthesis of ATP. The F0 sector is composed of membrane-spanning subunits that conduct protons across the membrane (1Deckers-Hebestreit G. Altendorf K. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 1996; 50: 791-824Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar,2Fillingame R.H. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1996; 6: 491-498Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar), whereas the F1 sector is an extrinsic complex that contains catalytic sites for ATP synthesis (3Boyer P.D. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1997; 66: 717-749Crossref PubMed Scopus (1570) Google Scholar). F1 can be removed from the membrane in a soluble form and, once unplugged from the proton current, functions as an ATPase. A model for energy coupling by F0F1-ATP synthases that has gained considerable support is called the binding change mechanism. According to this proposal, the major energy requiring step is not the synthesis of ATP at the three catalytic sites on F1 but rather the simultaneous and highly cooperative binding of substrates to and release of product from these sites (4Boyer P.D.

Chem. 1977; 252: 2486-2491Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, the binding changes are believed to be coupled to proton transport by the rotation of a complex of subunits that extends through F0F1 (6Boyer P.D. Kohlbrenner W.E. Selman B. Selman-Reimer S. Energy Coupling in Photosynthesis. Elsevier Science Publishing Co., Inc., New York1981: 231-240Google Scholar), and a number of recent studies provide strong support for this concept (7Gogol E.P. Johnston E. Aggeler R. Capaldi R.A.

Perhaps most compelling has been the demonstration that during ATP hydrolysis at a single site on soluble mitochondrial F1(MF1), 1The abbreviations used are: MF1, solubilized ATPase portion of beef heart mitochondrial F0F1-ATP synthase; ndMF1, nucleotide-depleted MF1; BSA, bovine serum albumin; Mops, 4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acid. 1The abbreviations used are: MF1, solubilized ATPase portion of beef heart mitochondrial F0F1-ATP synthase; ndMF1, nucleotide-depleted MF1; BSA, bovine serum albumin; Mops, 4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acid. the rate of product release can be accelerated by up to 5 orders of magnitude upon binding substrate to adjacent catalytic sites (13Grubmeyer C.

In studies presented here, we have applied techniques that have successfully revealed details of subunit cooperativity in previous studies. The results demonstrate that like native MF1, ndMF1 exhibits strong positive cooperativity between catalytic sites. RESULTSUnder conditions where substoichiometric ATP can bind rapidly at one of the three catalytic sites on ndMF1 (SchemeFS1, Step 1), ATP hydrolysis exhibits an initial burst followed by a slow phase (Fig.1, circles). The rapid phase is due to the establishment of an equilibrium between bound substrate and bound products (Scheme FS1, Step 2), whereas the slow phase is due to product release (Scheme FS1, Step 3). The overall reaction (Scheme FS1, Steps 1–3), referred to as uni-site catalysis, is a very slow process limited by the rate of product release in Step 3. A brief incubation with a large excess of unlabeled ATP just prior to acid quenching (Fig. 1,squares) has two effects. First, upon binding ATP to additional catalytic sites, the release of radiolabeled product from the first site is accelerated (Scheme FS1, Step 3′). This is demonstrated by the fact that all of the bound [γ-32P]ATP is hydrolyzed during the chase. Second, it prevents any remaining unbound [γ-32P]ATP from binding. Because only a few percent of the “cold chase” ATP is hydrolyzed during the 5-s incubation, any remaining unbound [γ-32P]ATP would be trapped. The fact that all of the radiolabel appears as 32Pi in the cold chase indicates that the [γ-32P]ATP initially added had all bound to catalytic sites prior to the first time point shown and that none of it dissociated as radiolabeled ATP during the cold chase.The promotive effect of excess ATP on the hydrolysis of radiolabeled ATP preloaded at a single catalytic site (Fig. 1) indicates that the three catalytic sites on ndMF1 behave in a cooperative manner. As a more direct means of assessing the ability of substrate binding at one site to promote product release from a second site, we used a Sephadex centrifuge column binding assay for the experiments reported in Figs. 2 and3. In Fig. 2, we follow the dissociation of 32Pi by measuring the amount of [γ-32P]ATP plus 32Pi remaining bound to a site initially loaded under uni-site conditions. The addition of low nanomolar concentrations of unlabeled ATP results in a measurable acceleration in the rate of release of32Pi. The same effect is observed when we follow the dissociation of [α-32P]ADP by measuring the amount of [α-32P]ATP and [α-32P]ADP remaining bound to a site also loaded under uni-site conditions (Fig.3). Acceleration of product release by ATP (Figs. 2 and 3) is due to nucleotide binding at remaining unoccupied catalytic sites because ATP binding to noncatalytic sites is too slow (23Milgrom Y.M. Cross R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 23179-23185Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) to occur to a significant extent during these experiments.

Open table in a new tab Additional information not related to subunit cooperativity can be derived from the experiments presented in Figs. Figure 1, Figure 2, Figure 3. First, the equilibrium constant, K 2, for Step 2(Scheme FS1) can be obtained from the initial “acid quench” and cold chase data points (Fig. 1) and is equal to 0.53. This value is identical to the K 2 value obtained under similar conditions with MF1 preparations containing endogenous nucleotides (13Grubmeyer C. Cross R.L. Penefsky H.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 12092-12100Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Second, the observed rate constant for the slow phase of [γ-32P]ATP hydrolysis (1.1 × 10−2 s−1, Fig. 1), is significantly higher than either of the observed rate constants for unpromoted product release (32Pi = 4.6 × 10−3 s−1, Fig. 2, and [α-32P]ADP = 6.8 × 10−3 s−1, Fig. 3). Instead, the ATP hydrolysis rate under uni-site conditions is equal to the sum of the product dissociation rates (i.e. (4.6 + 6.8) × 10−3 = 1.1 × 10−2 s−1) as expected if the dissociation of products occurs in random order. A similar conclusion can be made from a reassessment of data reported for native MF1 that contains endogenous nucleotides (13Grubmeyer C. Cross R.L. Penefsky H.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 12092-12100Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar,15Cunningham D. Cross R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 18850-18856Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Under conditions where substoichiometric ATP can bind rapidly at one of the three catalytic sites on ndMF1 (SchemeFS1, Step 1), ATP hydrolysis exhibits an initial burst followed by a slow phase (Fig.1, circles). The rapid phase is due to the establishment of an equilibrium between bound substrate and bound products (Scheme FS1, Step 2), whereas the slow phase is due to product release (Scheme FS1, Step 3). The overall reaction (Scheme FS1, Steps 1–3), referred to as uni-site catalysis, is a very slow process limited by the rate of product release in Step 3. A brief incubation with a large excess of unlabeled ATP just prior to acid quenching (Fig. 1,squares) has two effects. First, upon binding ATP to additional catalytic sites, the release of radiolabeled product from the first site is accelerated (Scheme FS1, Step 3′). This is demonstrated by the fact that all of the bound [γ-32P]ATP is hydrolyzed during the chase. Second, it prevents any remaining unbound [γ-32P]ATP from binding. Because only a few percent of the “cold chase” ATP is hydrolyzed during the 5-s incubation, any remaining unbound [γ-32P]ATP would be trapped. The fact that all of the radiolabel appears as 32Pi in the cold chase indicates that the [γ-32P]ATP initially added had all bound to catalytic sites prior to the first time point shown and that none of it dissociated as radiolabeled ATP during the cold chase. The promotive effect of excess ATP on the hydrolysis of radiolabeled ATP preloaded at a single catalytic site (Fig. 1) indicates that the three catalytic sites on ndMF1 behave in a cooperative manner. As a more direct means of assessing the ability of substrate binding at one site to promote product release from a second site, we used a Sephadex centrifuge column binding assay for the experiments reported in Figs. 2 and3. In Fig. 2, we follow the dissociation of 32Pi by measuring the amount of [γ-32P]ATP plus 32Pi remaining bound to a site initially loaded under uni-site conditions. The addition of low nanomolar concentrations of unlabeled ATP results in a measurable acceleration in the rate of release of32Pi. The same effect is observed when we follow the dissociation of [α-32P]ADP by measuring the amount of [α-32P]ATP and [α-32P]ADP remaining bound to a site also loaded under uni-site conditions (Fig.3). Acceleration of product release by ATP (Figs. 2 and 3) is due to nucleotide binding at remaining unoccupied catalytic sites because ATP binding to noncatalytic sites is too slow (23Milgrom Y.M. Cross R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 23179-23185Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) to occur to a significant extent during these experiments. Hence, the promotive effect of excess ATP on the rates of release of bound32Pi and [α-32P]ADP are a direct demonstration of positive catalytic cooperativity. In Fig. 4, rates obtained from Figs. 2and 3 in the absence (closed symbols) or the presence (open symbols) of excess unlabeled ATP for the dissociation of 32Pi (circles) and [α-32P]ADP (squares) are plotted versus the concentration of cold chase ATP. A linear regression analysis gives a value of 10.6 ± 1.6 × 106m−1 s−1 for the ATP concentration dependence of the rate of product release. This is in agreement with the rate constant for ATP binding at a second site (Scheme FS1, k′ 1) determined from the rates of hydrolysis of nanomolar concentrations of ATP (data not shown). This correlation provides further evidence that ATP binding at one catalytic site promotes product release from an adjacent site. The degree of cooperativity between catalytic sites can be quantitated by measuring the acceleration of product release in going from uni- to multi-site turnover conditions. Values obtained for the ndMF1 preparation used in this study are presented in the first line of Table I. The results show that substrate binding can increase the rate of product release from a separate but interacting site by up to 50,000-fold under maximal velocity conditions. This is similar to the degree of rate acceleration previously observed for native MF1 (Table I, second line). For both forms of enzyme, this reflects exceptionally strong positive catalytic cooperativity. Additional information not related to subunit cooperativity can be derived from the experiments presented in Figs. Figure 1, Figure 2, Figure 3. First, the equilibrium constant, K 2, for Step 2(Scheme FS1) can be obtained from the initial “acid quench” and cold chase data points (Fig. 1) and is equal to 0.53. This value is identical to the K 2 value obtained under similar conditions with MF1 preparations containing endogenous nucleotides (13Grubmeyer C. Cross R.L. Penefsky H.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 12092-12100Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Second, the observed rate constant for the slow phase of [γ-32P]ATP hydrolysis (1.1 × 10−2 s−1, Fig. 1), is significantly higher than either of the observed rate constants for unpromoted product release (32Pi = 4.6 × 10−3 s−1, Fig. 2, and [α-32P]ADP = 6.8 × 10−3 s−1, Fig. 3). Instead, the ATP hydrolysis rate under uni-site conditions is equal to the sum of the product dissociation rates (i.e. (4.6 + 6.8) × 10−3 = 1.1 × 10−2 s−1) as expected if the dissociation of products occurs in random order. A similar conclusion can be made from a reassessment of data reported for native MF1 that contains endogenous nucleotides (13Grubmeyer C. Cross R.L. Penefsky H.S. J. Biol.

DISCUSSIONThe finding that nanomolar concentrations of ATP accelerate the rate of product release from a catalytic site on ndMF1initially loaded under uni-site conditions establishes two features of catalysis by this form of the enzyme. First, because the ATP-promoted rates of release of Pi and ADP equal the rate of ATP binding, it can be concluded that the enzyme is not subject to product inhibition. This is consistent with the presence of Pi in the buffer because Pi is known to significantly reduce MgADP inhibition of MF1 (24Yalamova M.V. Vasilyeva E.A. Vinogradov A.D. Biochem. Int. 1982; 4: 337-344Google Scholar, 25Drobinskaya I.Y. Kozlov I.A. Murataliev M.B. Vulfson E.N. FEBS Lett. 1985; 182: 419-424Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). It is also consistent with the fact that any endogenous inhibitory MgADP bound to the enzyme would have been removed during the preparation of ndMF1. Second, the results directly demonstrate positive catalytic cooperativity. This is in accordance with the binding change mechanism where the exergonic tight binding of cold chase ATP to an unoccupied catalytic site would be expected to drive the release of tightly bound product from an adjacent occupied site.These conclusions are in contrast to those reached by Reynafarje and Pedersen (16Reynafarje B.D. Pedersen P.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 32546-32550Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). They reported that under conditions for uni-site catalysis, the rate of substrate binding measured by a luciferase assay was equal to the rate of product release measured by a charcoal quench/centricon filtration assay during a 2-s incubation. Data presented in Figs. Figure 1, Figure 2, Figure 3 clearly show that this is not the case. One possible explanation of their results is that the addition of charcoal at 2 s in their assay for product release was ineffective in stopping uni-site catalysis. Although charcoal would prevent further binding of ATP, it would not be expected to prevent cleavage of enzyme-bound ATP with subsequent dissociation of products. Indeed, we found that unisite catalysis continued for up to 2 min in the presence of charcoal when we bound substoichiometric [γ-32P]ATP to F1 under conditions described for Fig. 1, incubated for 4 s, added a charcoal suspension (pH 7.5) in the amount used by Reynafarje and Pedersen, and continued incubation for various times before quenching with perchloric acid (data not shown). Hence, in the experiments of Reynafarje and Pedersen (see Table III of 16Reynafarje B.D. Pedersen P.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 32546-32550Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar), the true reaction time for Pidissociation may have been much longer than the 2 s reported.Additional details of our results warrant comment. First, ndMF1 shares a number of properties in common with native MF1. The rate of ATP binding, the equilibrium constant for interconversion of bound substrate and product, and the maximal acceleration of product release caused by substrate binding are all very similar for the two forms of the enzyme. One rather minor difference is the 4-fold faster rate of uni-site catalysis observed with ndMF1. Second, the finding that the rate of ATP cleavage during uni-site hydrolysis is equal to the sum of the product release rates indicates a random order release of ADP and Pi. This is consistent with previous evidence that ADP and Pi bind in a random order during ATP synthesis (5Kayalar C. Rosing J. Boyer P.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1977; 252: 2486-2491Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).

We have found that one of the negative calcium responsive elements, named oligo B, is found in the 5′-flanking region of such vasoactive genes as the vasopressin and atrial natriuretic polypeptide genes. Furthermore, the oligo B-like sequence in the former gene is conserved throughout evolution. Because expression of some of these vasoactive genes is altered by external stimuli which change cell volume, we examined whether oligo B is involved in gene regulation by hyperosmolarity. Here, we demonstrate that the binding between oligo B and its binding nuclear proteins including a redox factor 1 was reduced by hyperosmolarity generated by sodium chloride but not by urea. Such attenuated binding was reversed by dephosphorylating nuclear proteins by a potato acid phosphatase, suggesting that NaCl treatment elicited phosphorylation of these nuclear proteins to weaken their binding activity to oligo B. Furthermore, these nuclear events led to hyperosmolarity-mediated transcriptional stimulation of the genes bearing this DNA element in the cultured cells.

To maintain a constant cell volume against extracellular osmotic perturbations, virtually all living cells must be equipped with sensing machineries that transmit information from the cell membrane to the nucleus. The molecular mechanisms by which eukaryotic cells sense the changes in external osmolarity and transduce that information into a certain response are partially understood (1McManus M.L. Churchwell K.B. Strange K. N. Engl. J. Med. 1995; 333: 1260-1266Crossref PubMed Scopus (394) Google Scholar, 2Brewster J.L. de Valoir T. Dwyer N.D. Winter E. Gustin M.C.

For example, cells of the mammalian renal medulla are exposed to markedly elevated concentrations of NaCl and urea as a consequence of the renal concentrating mechanism. In these cells, a large but physiological elevation of the osmolarity activates certain ion channels and the mitogen-activated protein kinase cascade followed by up-regulation of some of the immediate early gene, resulting in an interaction between a transcription factor(s) and a specific DNA element(s) in cell nucleus (6Kohan D.E. Padilla E. J. Clin. Invest. 1993; 91: 1235-1240Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar, 7Takenaka M. Preston A.S. Kwon H.M. Handler J.S. J. Biol.

A. 1996; 93: 8624-8629Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). On the other hand, small changes such as 3–4% in osmolarity are also strictly sensed by many types of cells to maintain cell volume (1McManus M.L. Churchwell K.B. Strange K. N. Engl. J. Med. 1995; 333: 1260-1266Crossref PubMed Scopus (394) Google Scholar). However, the underlying molecular mechanism in the latter case is poorly understood.We have been studying the molecular mechanism of gene regulation by extracellular calcium (Ca2+ e). 1The abbreviations used are: Ca2+ e, extracellular calcium; nCaRE(B), negative calcium responsive element (binding protein); PTH, parathyroid hormone; CAT, chloramphenicol acetyltransferase; Ref1, redox factor protein; EMSA, electrophoretic mobility shift assay; Tk, thymidine kinase; HEK cells, human embryonal kidney cells; ANP, atrial natriuretic polypeptide; CRE, cyclic AMP response element. 1The abbreviations used are: Ca2+ e, extracellular calcium; nCaRE(B), negative calcium responsive element (binding protein); PTH, parathyroid hormone; CAT, chloramphenicol acetyltransferase; Ref1, redox factor protein; EMSA, electrophoretic mobility shift assay; Tk, thymidine kinase; HEK cells, human embryonal kidney cells; ANP, atrial natriuretic polypeptide; CRE, cyclic AMP response element.We found that, in the upstream region of the human parathyroid hormone gene, two DNA elements interact with ubiquitous nuclear proteins including Ref1 in a sequence-specific manner to mediate negative gene regulation by Ca2+ e (10Okazaki T.

One of such elements, named oligo B, is composed of a unique palindromic sequence, TGAGACAGGGTCTCA. We previously reported that a DNA sequence similar to oligo B was also found in the upstream region of the rat atrial natriuretic polypeptide (ANP) and vasopressin genes (11Okazaki T. Ando K. Igarashi T. Ogata E. Fujita T. J. Clin. Invest. 1992; 89: 1268-1273Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Expression of these two genes is known to be influenced by external biomechanical stimuli such as osmolarity (14Robinson A.G. Roberts M.M. Evron W.A. Verbalis J.G. Sherman T.G. J. Clin. Invest. 1990; 86: 1023-1029Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar, 15Pu L.-P. Van Leeuwen F.W. Tracer H.L. Sonnemans M.A.F. Loh L.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Rev. 1990; 70: 665-696Crossref PubMed Scopus (845) Google Scholar). Therefore, we examined the possibility that oligo B mediates osmolarity-induced regulation of gene expression in the cell nucleus.DISCUSSIONWe previously proposed a unique palindromic sequence,TGAGACAGGGTCTCA, oligo B, is one of the two DNA sequences necessary for negative gene regulation by Ca2+ e and speculated that oligo B might mediate osmolarity-induced regulation of gene expression (10Okazaki T. Zajac J.D. Igarashi T. Ogata E. Kronenberg H.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 21903-21910Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 11Okazaki T. Ando K. Igarashi T. Ogata E. Fujita T. J. Clin. Invest. 1992; 89: 1268-1273Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Of note, vasopressin, whose transcription is known to be stimulated by hyperosmolarity (14Robinson A.G. Roberts M.M. Evron W.A. Verbalis J.G. Sherman T.G. J. Clin. Invest. 1990; 86: 1023-1029Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar), contains DNA sequences similar to oligo B, and these sequences are conserved throughout evolution (Fig. 1).Our hypothesis is that virtually every living cell is equipped with a common sensing machinery against changes of osmolarity that signals from the cell membrane to the nucleus to maintain cell volume. Once a DNA element capable of interacting with such a machinery in the cell nucleus is introduced into the cell along with a reporter gene, the reporter activity would be properly regulated by changes of osmolarity through the interaction between such a nuclear machinery and the introduced DNA element. This may happen even when no endogenous gene is known to be susceptible to osmotic regulation in these cells. In this respect, a recent report by Shyy et al. (23Shyy J.-Y.J. Lin M.C. Han J. Lu Y. Petrime M. Chien S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 8069-8073Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar) encouraged our hypothesis. They postulated that the interaction between the exogenously added AP1 site and endogenous AP1 protein(s) in HeLa cells mediated gene regulation by fluid shear stress, another stimulus changing cell volume; expression of no endogenous gene is known to be influenced by this stimulus in HeLa cells.In this study, we first attempted to explore the hyperosmolar effects on the binding between oligo B and nuclear proteins from HeLa and HEK cells. We previously showed that, in Ca2+ e -mediated gene regulation, the binding between oligo B and nCaREB was augmented by a rise in Ca2+ e concentration, followed by suppression of expression of the genes bearing oligo B (11Okazaki T. Ando K. Igarashi T. Ogata E. Fujita T. J. Clin. Invest. 1992; 89: 1268-1273Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 12Okazaki T. Chung U. Nishishita T. Ebisu S. Usuda S. Mishiro S. Xanthoudakis S. Igarashi T. Ogata E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 27855-27862Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). By analogy with this observation, we speculated that hyperosmolarity induces up-regulation of the genes bearing oligo B due to suppression of the oligo B binding to HeLa or HEK nuclear proteins. This hypothesis was verified in several experiments. In EMSA (Fig. 2), we demonstrated that HeLa and HEK nuclear proteins bound to oligo B more weakly as NaCl concentrations were raised. Furthermore, in the Southwestern assay (Fig. 4), similar NaCl treatment of these cells conferred weaker binding activity to oligo B (B4) by the Ref1 protein, which had been shown by us to be one of the nCaRE (oligo B) binding proteins (nCaREBs, Ref. 12Okazaki T. Chung U. Nishishita T. Ebisu S. Usuda S. Mishiro S. Xanthoudakis S. Igarashi T. Ogata E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 27855-27862Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We also demonstrated that these nuclear events correlated with a NaCl-mediated transcriptional stimulation of an introduced reporter CAT gene bearing oligo B in either PTH or Tk promoter context (Fig. 3). Furthermore, our experiments using cells stably transfected with a Ref1 expression vector in the antisense orientation (12Okazaki T. Chung U. Nishishita T. Ebisu S. Usuda S. Mishiro S. Xanthoudakis S. Igarashi T. Ogata E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 27855-27862Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) revealed oligo B introduced into such cells no longer mediated gene regulation by hyperosmolarity (Fig. 5). This finding also underscores our hypothesis that oligo B and one of its binding proteins, Ref1, are crucially involved in this type of gene regulation.One unexpected finding was that hyperosmolarity generated by NaCl, but not by urea, mediated this type of DNA-protein interaction (Figs. 2 and4) and gene regulation (Fig. 3). Both of these stimuli are classified into “perturbing” solutes that would disturb many intracellular processes and are supposed to exert similar effects to the cells (1McManus M.L. Churchwell K.B. Strange K. N. Engl. J. Med. 1995; 333: 1260-1266Crossref PubMed Scopus (394) Google Scholar). However, in contrast to the cell-permeant nature of urea, NaCl is non-permeant and known to cause cell shrinkage (26Szaszi S. Buday L. Kapus A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 16670-16678Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). When we used another cell-permeant osmolyte, glycerol, we found that it did not affect the binding between oligo B and Ref1 nor was the CAT activity driven by oligo B-TkCAT (data not shown). Future experiments using several cell-impermeant osmolytes and/or monitoring of cell volume would clarify whether cell shrinkage rather than cell osmolarity triggers the nuclear events shown here.Cohen et al. (8Cohen D.M. Gullans S.R. Chin W.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 12903-12908Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar) reported that urea, but not NaCl, induced expression of an immediate early gene, egr-1, in renal medullary collecting duct cells, thereby discriminating their effects. They postulated that different types of phosphorylation elicited by these stimuli were responsible for their discriminative effects (8Cohen D.M. Gullans S.R. Chin W.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 12903-12908Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). In this regard, it is of particular interest that, in our experiment, dephosphorylation of the oligo B-binding proteins including Ref1 protein by potato acid phosphatase reversed their binding to oligo B once attenuated exclusively by NaCl treatment (Fig. 6). This result suggests that a certain protein kinase(s) activated by NaCl but not by urea might phosphorylate some of the oligo B-binding proteins including Ref1. These phosphorylated proteins might have weaker binding activity to oligo B, leading to NaCl-mediated transcriptional stimulation of the gene(s) bearing oligo B. The recent identification of SGK(Ref. 24Waldegger S. Barth P. Raber G. Lang F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 4440-4445Crossref PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar, human serum and glucocorticoid-regulated protein kinase) or p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (3Galcheava-gargova Z. Derijard B.

Science. 1994; 265: 808-811Crossref PubMed Scopus (2401) Google Scholar) as an intracellular mediator for osmotic stimuli might help understanding the molecular mechanism underlying our observations. In addition, the report implying that Ref1 protein shares consensus amino acid sequences for the substrates of several protein kinases (25Xanthoudakis S. Miao G.G. Wang F. Pan Y.E. Curran T. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 3323-3335Crossref PubMed Scopus (817) Google Scholar) also favors our speculation.Recently, several transcription factors and/or specific DNA elements were reported to be involved in osmolarity-mediated gene regulation in renal tubular cells (8Cohen D.M. Gullans S.R. Chin W.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 12903-12908Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar, 9Ruepp B. Bohren K.M. Gabbay K.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 8624-8629Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Unlike renal tubular cells that accumulate large amounts of organic osmolytes to compensate for the interstitial hypertonicity, the cultured cells we used in this study do not seem to tolerate such an extraordinary stimulus. Such a difference might explain, at least in part, why oligo B does not share any sequence with the recently identified DNA elements that mediate gene regulation in these cells by drastic osmotic changes (6Kohan D.E. Padilla E. J. Clin. Invest. 1993; 91: 1235-1240Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar, 7Takenaka M. Preston A.S. Kwon H.M. Handler J.S. J. Biol.

A. 1996; 93: 8624-8629Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar).With regard to our previous studies, we speculate that the effect of higher Ca2+ e concentrations and that of hyperosmolarity, that is higher NaCl concentration, is counteracting, one stimulatory and the other inhibitory on the oligo B-protein binding and vice versa on the oligo B-mediated CAT activity. Although the precise mechanism remains to be elucidated, we believe that both of these stimuli share, at least in part, signal transducing machinery from the cell membrane to the nuclei.The results of the EMSA, competition, and Southwestern assays indicate complex interactions of multiple factors including Ref1 with oligo B (or B4) sequence, which appear to differ between the “basal” isosmotic and the hyperosmotic states. Identification of the upstream components of this pathway in mammalian cells may provide information about intracellular signaling pathways that regulate mammalian cell responses to changing osmotic pressure. To maintain a constant cell volume against extracellular osmotic perturbations, virtually all living cells must be equipped with sensing machineries that transmit information from the cell membrane to the nucleus. The molecular mechanisms by which eukaryotic cells sense the changes in external osmolarity and transduce that information into a certain response are partially understood (1McManus M.L. Churchwell K.B. Strange K. N. Engl. J. Med. 1995; 333: 1260-1266Crossref PubMed Scopus (394) Google Scholar, 2Brewster J.L. de Valoir T. Dwyer N.D. Winter E. Gustin M.C.

Dinarello C.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 12230-12334Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar). For example, cells of the mammalian renal medulla are exposed to markedly elevated concentrations of NaCl and urea as a consequence of the renal concentrating mechanism. In these cells, a large but physiological elevation of the osmolarity activates certain ion channels and the mitogen-activated protein kinase cascade followed by up-regulation of some of the immediate early gene, resulting in an interaction between a transcription factor(s) and a specific DNA element(s) in cell nucleus (6Kohan D.E. Padilla E. J. Clin. Invest. 1993; 91: 1235-1240Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar, 7Takenaka M. Preston A.S. Kwon H.M. Handler J.S. J. Biol.

A. 1996; 93: 8624-8629Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). On the other hand, small changes such as 3–4% in osmolarity are also strictly sensed by many types of cells to maintain cell volume (1McManus M.L. Churchwell K.B. Strange K. N. Engl. J. Med. 1995; 333: 1260-1266Crossref PubMed Scopus (394) Google Scholar). However, the underlying molecular mechanism in the latter case is poorly understood. We have been studying the molecular mechanism of gene regulation by extracellular calcium (Ca2+ e). 1The abbreviations used are: Ca2+ e, extracellular calcium; nCaRE(B), negative calcium responsive element (binding protein); PTH, parathyroid hormone; CAT, chloramphenicol acetyltransferase; Ref1, redox factor protein; EMSA, electrophoretic mobility shift assay; Tk, thymidine kinase; HEK cells, human embryonal kidney cells; ANP, atrial natriuretic polypeptide; CRE, cyclic AMP response element. 1The abbreviations used are: Ca2+ e, extracellular calcium; nCaRE(B), negative calcium responsive element (binding protein); PTH, parathyroid hormone; CAT, chloramphenicol acetyltransferase; Ref1, redox factor protein; EMSA, electrophoretic mobility shift assay; Tk, thymidine kinase; HEK cells, human embryonal kidney cells; ANP, atrial natriuretic polypeptide; CRE, cyclic AMP response element.We found that, in the upstream region of the human parathyroid hormone gene, two DNA elements interact with ubiquitous nuclear proteins including Ref1 in a sequence-specific manner to mediate negative gene regulation by Ca2+ e (10Okazaki T.

J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 8593-8598Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). One of such elements, named oligo B, is composed of a unique palindromic sequence, TGAGACAGGGTCTCA. We previously reported that a DNA sequence similar to oligo B was also found in the upstream region of the rat atrial natriuretic polypeptide (ANP) and vasopressin genes (11Okazaki T. Ando K. Igarashi T. Ogata E. Fujita T. J. Clin. Invest. 1992; 89: 1268-1273Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Expression of these two genes is known to be influenced by external biomechanical stimuli such as osmolarity (14Robinson A.G. Roberts M.M. Evron W.A. Verbalis J.G. Sherman T.G. J. Clin. Invest. 1990; 86: 1023-1029Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar, 15Pu L.-P. Van Leeuwen F.W. Tracer H.L. Sonnemans M.A.F. Loh L.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Rev. 1990; 70: 665-696Crossref PubMed Scopus (845) Google Scholar). Therefore, we examined the possibility that oligo B mediates osmolarity-induced regulation of gene expression in the cell nucleus. DISCUSSIONWe previously proposed a unique palindromic sequence,TGAGACAGGGTCTCA, oligo B, is one of the two DNA sequences necessary for negative gene regulation by Ca2+ e and speculated that oligo B might mediate osmolarity-induced regulation of gene expression (10Okazaki T. Zajac J.D. Igarashi T. Ogata E. Kronenberg H.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 21903-21910Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 11Okazaki T. Ando K. Igarashi T. Ogata E. Fujita T. J. Clin. Invest. 1992; 89: 1268-1273Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Of note, vasopressin, whose transcription is known to be stimulated by hyperosmolarity (14Robinson A.G. Roberts M.M. Evron W.A. Verbalis J.G. Sherman T.G. J. Clin. Invest. 1990; 86: 1023-1029Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar), contains DNA sequences similar to oligo B, and these sequences are conserved throughout evolution (Fig. 1).Our hypothesis is that virtually every living cell is equipped with a common sensing machinery against changes of osmolarity that signals from the cell membrane to the nucleus to maintain cell volume. Once a DNA element capable of interacting with such a machinery in the cell nucleus is introduced into the cell along with a reporter gene, the reporter activity would be properly regulated by changes of osmolarity through the interaction between such a nuclear machinery and the introduced DNA element. This may happen even when no endogenous gene is known to be susceptible to osmotic regulation in these cells. In this respect, a recent report by Shyy et al. (23Shyy J.-Y.J. Lin M.C. Han J. Lu Y. Petrime M. Chien S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 8069-8073Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar) encouraged our hypothesis. They postulated that the interaction between the exogenously added AP1 site and endogenous AP1 protein(s) in HeLa cells mediated gene regulation by fluid shear stress, another stimulus changing cell volume; expression of no endogenous gene is known to be influenced by this stimulus in HeLa cells.In this study, we first attempted to explore the hyperosmolar effects on the binding between oligo B and nuclear proteins from HeLa and HEK cells. We previously showed that, in Ca2+ e -mediated gene regulation, the binding between oligo B and nCaREB was augmented by a rise in Ca2+ e concentration, followed by suppression of expression of the genes bearing oligo B (11Okazaki T. Ando K. Igarashi T. Ogata E. Fujita T. J. Clin. Invest. 1992; 89: 1268-1273Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 12Okazaki T. Chung U. Nishishita T. Ebisu S. Usuda S. Mishiro S. Xanthoudakis S. Igarashi T. Ogata E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 27855-27862Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). By analogy with this observation, we speculated that hyperosmolarity induces up-regulation of the genes bearing oligo B due to suppression of the oligo B binding to HeLa or HEK nuclear proteins. This hypothesis was verified in several experiments. In EMSA (Fig. 2), we demonstrated that HeLa and HEK nuclear proteins bound to oligo B more weakly as NaCl concentrations were raised. Furthermore, in the Southwestern assay (Fig. 4), similar NaCl treatment of these cells conferred weaker binding activity to oligo B (B4) by the Ref1 protein, which had been shown by us to be one of the nCaRE (oligo B) binding proteins (nCaREBs, Ref. 12Okazaki T. Chung U. Nishishita T. Ebisu S. Usuda S. Mishiro S. Xanthoudakis S. Igarashi T. Ogata E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 27855-27862Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We also demonstrated that these nuclear events correlated with a NaCl-mediated transcriptional stimulation of an introduced reporter CAT gene bearing oligo B in either PTH or Tk promoter context (Fig. 3). Furthermore, our experiments using cells stably transfected with a Ref1 expression vector in the antisense orientation (12Okazaki T. Chung U. Nishishita T. Ebisu S. Usuda S. Mishiro S. Xanthoudakis S. Igarashi T. Ogata E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 27855-27862Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) revealed oligo B introduced into such cells no longer mediated gene regulation by hyperosmolarity (Fig. 5). This finding also underscores our hypothesis that oligo B and one of its binding proteins, Ref1, are crucially involved in this type of gene regulation.One unexpected finding was that hyperosmolarity generated by NaCl, but not by urea, mediated this type of DNA-protein interaction (Figs. 2 and4) and gene regulation (Fig. 3). Both of these stimuli are classified into “perturbing” solutes that would disturb many intracellular processes and are supposed to exert similar effects to the cells (1McManus M.L. Churchwell K.B. Strange K. N. Engl. J. Med. 1995; 333: 1260-1266Crossref PubMed Scopus (394) Google Scholar). However, in contrast to the cell-permeant nature of urea, NaCl is non-permeant and known to cause cell shrinkage (26Szaszi S. Buday L. Kapus A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 16670-16678Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). When we used another cell-permeant osmolyte, glycerol, we found that it did not affect the binding between oligo B and Ref1 nor was the CAT activity driven by oligo B-TkCAT (data not shown). Future experiments using several cell-impermeant osmolytes and/or monitoring of cell volume would clarify whether cell shrinkage rather than cell osmolarity triggers the nuclear events shown here.Cohen et al. (8Cohen D.M. Gullans S.R. Chin W.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 12903-12908Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar) reported that urea, but not NaCl, induced expression of an immediate early gene, egr-1, in renal medullary collecting duct cells, thereby discriminating their effects. They postulated that different types of phosphorylation elicited by these stimuli were responsible for their discriminative effects (8Cohen D.M. Gullans S.R. Chin W.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 12903-12908Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). In this regard, it is of particular interest that, in our experiment, dephosphorylation of the oligo B-binding proteins including Ref1 protein by potato acid phosphatase reversed their binding to oligo B once attenuated exclusively by NaCl treatment (Fig. 6). This result suggests that a certain protein kinase(s) activated by NaCl but not by urea might phosphorylate some of the oligo B-binding proteins including Ref1. These phosphorylated proteins might have weaker binding activity to oligo B, leading to NaCl-mediated transcriptional stimulation of the gene(s) bearing oligo B. The recent identification of SGK(Ref. 24Waldegger S. Barth P. Raber G. Lang F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

With regard to our previous studies, we speculate that the effect of higher Ca2+ e concentrations and that of hyperosmolarity, that is higher NaCl concentration, is counteracting, one stimulatory and the other inhibitory on the oligo B-protein binding and vice versa on the oligo B-mediated CAT activity. Although the precise mechanism remains to be elucidated, we believe that both of these stimuli share, at least in part, signal transducing machinery from the cell membrane to the nuclei. The results of the EMSA, competition, and Southwestern assays indicate complex interactions of multiple factors including Ref1 with oligo B (or B4) sequence, which appear to differ between the “basal” isosmotic and the hyperosmotic states. Identification of the upstream components of this pathway in mammalian cells may provide information about intracellular signaling pathways that regulate mammalian cell responses to changing osmotic pressure."
https://openalex.org/W2009650273,"A new and essential cis-element AEE (aldose reductase enhancerelement), necessary for the constitutive activity and the osmotic stress response of rat aldose reductase transcription in a rat liver cell line, has been identified. In transient transfection assays, an increase in promoter activity, up to 3.8-fold, was observed with osmotic stress (600 mosm/kg H2O) using a luciferase reporter gene construct containing aldose reductase promoter sequence from −1,094 base pair (bp) to +23 bp. A deletion between −1,071 and −895 bp reduced the constitutive activity and abolished the osmotic response of the promoter. Exonuclease III mediated in vivoDNA footprinting and dimethyl sulfate in vivo footprinting revealed DNA protection of a 32-bp region and two guanosines (G) within this region protected from methylation, respectively. Electrophoretic gel mobility shift assays using whole liver cell extracts showed protein binding, under both normal and stressed conditions. Deletion of the sequence between the two guanosines protected by in vivo dimethyl sulfate DNA footprinting (GAAGAGTG) in a luciferase construct (−1,094 bp to +23 bp) abolished the constitutive promoter activity. One copy of AEE fused to the thymidine kinase promoter gave a maximum constitutive activity of 7.7-fold and a maximum osmotic response activity of 6.7-fold.

The elevation of renal medullary extracellular NaCl and urea during antidiuresis has been known to be adjusted intracellularly by accumulation of osmolytes such as sorbitol, myoinositol, betaine, and glycerophosphorylcholine. Aldose reductase (AR), 1The abbreviations used are: AR, aldose reductase; bp, base pair(s); PCR, polymerase chain reaction; TK, thymidine kinase; EMSA, electrophoretic mobility shift assay; LM-PCR, ligation-mediated PCR; AEE, aldose reductase enhancer element; kb, kilobase(s). an enzyme which catalyzes the reduction of various sugars to alcohols, including glucose to sorbitol, is highly expressed in kidney inner medulla (1Nishimura C.

A similar role for AR has been reported in plants that accumulate sorbitol during seed development (3Bartels D. Engelhardt K. Roncarati R. Schneider K. Rotter M. Salamini F. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 1037-1043Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Contrary to the role of AR in osmoregulation, AR-mediated accumulation of sorbitol from excess glucose in diabetic patients has been suggested to be one of the triggering events in diabetic complications, including cataract, retinopathy, neuropathy, and nephropathy (4Gabbay K.H.

The inhibition of this enzyme in diabetic animal models, such as galactose-fed rats has been successful in retarding or preventing such complications (7Robison Jr., W.G. Kador P.F. Kinoshita J.H.

Elevation of AR enzymatic activity and protein synthesis in cultured rabbit renal inner medulla cells (PAP-HT25) exposed to hypertonic medium was first reported by Moriyama et al. (2Moriyama T. Garcia-Prez A. Burg M.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 16810-16814Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) followed by additional findings that AR induction by hypertonic stress also occurs in other cell types and species by Kaneko et al.

DNA protection in a CGGAA(A/G) motif (−186 to −146), and a GC-rich region (−87 to −31) was observed by in vitro DNase I footprinting, but no response to osmotic stress was observed with this promoter region in transfection studies.

Three recent reports describe the involvement of a tonE-like osmotic response element of the human AR promoter at position −1,235 bp (11Ko B.C.B. Ruepp B. Bohren K.M. Gabbay K.H. Chung S.S.M. J.

A signal transduction study revealed that the p38 or SAPK/JNK pathway are not necessary for the transcriptional regulation of the AR promoter through osmotic response element (14Kültz D.

In this paper, we describe the identification of a novel cis-element necessary for the constitutive activity and the osmotic response activity of the rat AR promoter which is located in the proximity of the previously described tonE-like element. This novel AEE element is shown to be occupied in vivo in both transiently transfected templates and in the endogenous promoter, suggesting that a stable association with transcription factors at this site is required for effective rat AR promoter activity. The rat AR promoter was isolated from a phage rat genomic library (CLONTECH) (15Graham C. Szpirer C. Levan G. Carper D. Gene (Amst.). 1991; 107: 259-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). The 5′-flanking sequence of the gene was sequenced up to −3.6 kb (LARK Technologies, Houston, TX). The promoter fragments were amplified by PCR and subcloned into the pGL3 luciferase reporter vector (Promega, Madison, WI) and sequenced. Five additional reporter constructs were made by ligation of 5′-KpnI-GAGGGGTGTTGGAAGAGTGCCAAATTTCCGCCATT-KpnI-3′ sequence in both sense and antisense orientation, 5′-KpnI-AGGGGTGTTGGAAGAGTGCCAAATTTCC-KpnI-3′, 5′-KpnI-GGGTGTTGGAAGAGTGCCAAATTT-KpnI-3′, 5′-KpnI-GTGTTGGAAGAGTGCCAAAT-KpnI-3′ to the 5′ end of the thymidine kinase (TK) promoter (−105 to −52 bp) in the pGL3basic luciferase reporter vector (16Minucci S. Leid M. Toyama R. Saint-Jeannet J.-P. Peterson V.J. Horn V. Ishmael J.E. Bhattacharyya N. Dey A. Dawid I.B. Ozato K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 644-655Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). A normal rat liver cell line (Clone 9, ATCC, Rockville, MD) which expresses AR and responds to osmotic stress (data not shown) was cultured in 35-mm diameter culture wells (Falcon 3046) in Ham's F-12K medium (Life Technologies, Inc.), 10% fetal bovine serum (Life Technologies, Inc.), and 50 μg/ml gentamicin (Life Technologies, Inc.). When cells were 60% confluent, 1.7 μg of luciferase construct plasmid and 0.7 μg of pSV-β-galactosidase vector were transfected by the CaCl2 precipitation method (Profection mammalian transfection system, Promega) without osmotic shock. After 48 h, six of the wells received normal medium and the other six received hypertonic medium (medium supplemented with 150 mm NaCl; 600 mosm/kg H2O). Cells were harvested after 18 h, followed by luciferase assay and β-galactosidase assay according to the manufacturer's instructions (Dual-Light, Tropix, Bedford, MA). Exonuclease III (ExoIII)-mediated footprinting was carried out as described by Archer et al. with slight modification (17Archer T.K. Lefebvre P. Wolford R.G. Hanger G.L. Science. 1992; 255: 1573-1576Crossref PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar, 18Cordingley M.G. Riegel A.T. Hager G.L.

Cells were cultured in 10-cm diameter dishes up to 60% confluency and were then transfected with 10 μg of the luciferase construct 4, which contains 1,094 bp of upstream AR promoter sequence. After 6 h, the cells were washed with medium and grown an additional 48 h. Cells were scraped and washed with phosphate-buffered saline followed by suspension in 5 ml of homogenization buffer (10 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.4, 15 mm NaCl, 60 mm KCl, 1 mm EDTA, 0.1 mm EGTA, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 0.15 mm spermine, 0.5 mm spermidine, 5% sucrose). The suspension was homogenized in a Dounce homogenizer and 1 ml of sucrose solution (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 15 mmNaCl, 60 mm KCl, 0.15 mm spermine, 0.5 mm spermidine, 10% sucrose) was added. After centrifugation at 1,400 × g for 20 min the pelleted nuclei were washed once with wash buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 15 mm NaCl, 60 mm KCl, 0.15 mm spermine, 0.5 mm spermidine). Isolated nuclei (4.5 × 105) were resuspended in 200 μl of enzyme digestion buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 15 mm NaCl, 60 mm KCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, 5 mm MgCl2, 5% glycerol, 1 mmdithiothreitol) and treated at 30 °C for 15 min with 200 units of Asp718 or HindIII restriction enzyme (Boehringer Mannheim) and 650 units of ExoIII (Boehringer Mannheim). One ml of proteinase K buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 10 mm EDTA, 0.5% SDS, 0.2 mg/ml proteinase K) was added and incubated at 37 °C for 2 h to digest the nuclei. DNA was purified by phenol/chloroform extraction followed by ethanol precipitation. The DNA was resuspended and treated at 30 °C for 30 min with 50 units of mung bean nuclease (Boehringer Mannheim) in mung bean buffer (50 mm NaOAc, pH 5, 30 mm NaCl, 1 mm ZnSO4). Twenty micrograms of isolated DNA was used for linear PCR. Primers used for linear PCR were 5′-AAGCATGACCCAGCAGAAGGAGA-3′ (−974 bp to −952 bp, primer 1) for the coding strand and 5′-AGTTGCCCCAAGAACAATGGCGGAA-3′ (−877 bp to −901 bp, primer 2) for the noncoding strand. For control experiments construct 4 was digested with HindIII and linear PCR was performed with primer 1 (Fig. 2, lane 1) or the construct 4 was digested with Asp718 and linear PCR was performed with primer 2 (Fig. 2, lane 3). Linear PCR product were resolved in a 6% sequencing gel (Sequagel-6, National Diagnostics, Atlanta, GA). Cells were treated with 0.1% dimethyl sulfate for 90 s in both normal and hypertonic medium. DNA was extracted and cleaved by piperidine. Ligation-mediated (LM)-PCR was performed as described previously (20Dey A. Thornton A.M. Lonergan M. Weissman S.M. Chamberlain J.W. Ozato K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 3590-3599Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 21Garrity P.A. Wold B.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 1021-1025Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). Primers used for analysis were primer 2 (shown above), 5′-TGAACAGGCAGAATCCCATA-3′ (−747 to −766 bp, primer 3), and 5′-CTGAAATAATCGGAGTTGCCCCA-3′ (−864 to −886 bp, primer 4). After LM-PCR, labeled products were resolved in a 6% sequencing gel (Sequagel-6, National Diagnostics, Atlanta, GA). At least two independent DNA preparations were used. Whole cell extracts were prepared as described previously (22Minucci S. Zand D.J. Dey A. Marks M.S. Nagata T. Grippo J.F. Ozato K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 360-372Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Rat liver cells were cultured in three 10-cm diameter dishes to 90% confluency. The cells were then grown in normal medium or hypertonic medium for 30 min or 3 h. After stress, cells were pelleted, washed with phosphate-buffered saline, and resuspended in 2 packed cell volumes of Buffer C (20 mm Hepes, pH 7.9, containing 0.42 m NaCl, 1.5 mmMgCl2, 0.2 mm EDTA, 0.5 mmdithiothreitol, 25% (v/v) glycerol, 2 mm proteinase inhibitor 4-(2-aminoethyl)-benzenesulfonyl fluoride hydrochloride). The cells were snap frozen in ethanol/dry ice. Frozen cells were quickly thawed for homogenization and centrifuged for 1 h at 34,000 × g. The supernatant was used for EMSA without dialysis. Whole cell extracts (2–6 μg of protein) were incubated with 0.1 pmol of 32P-labeled oligonucleotide (105 cpm/reaction mixture) in EMSA binding buffer containing 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mmMgCl2, 0.2 mm EDTA, 0.5 mmdithiothreitol, 5% (v/v) glycerol, and 2 μg of poly(dI-dC) for 30 min at 4 °C. The oligomers used were: probe A, 5′-GAGGGGTGTTGGAAGAGTGCCAAATTTCCGCCATT-3′, probe A8, 5′-GAGGGGTGTTGAGGAGACACCAAATTTCCGCCATT-3′. For the competition experiments, extracts were preincubated at 4 °C for 30 min with a × 100 excess of unlabeled oligomers prior to the addition of labeled probe. Various luciferase reporter constructs of the rat AR promoter were made and transfected into rat liver cells to measure the promoter activity under normal and hypertonic conditions (Fig.1). Rat AR constitutive promoter activity was constant for constructs 1 (−3,104 to +23 bp) and 2 (−2,371 to +23 bp), while further deletions increased the activity up to construct 5 (−1,052 to +23 bp) which gave the highest constitutive activity. Deletion to construct 6 (−895 to +23 bp) had a significant effect on the reduction of constitutive promoter activity. Induction of promoter activity by osmotic response of construct 1 was 4.4-fold while deletion to construct 2 resulted in an increase of 11.8-fold (Fig. 1). Further deletion to construct 4 (1,094 to +23 bp) gave the highest absolute promoter activity by osmotic response (100.00 under hypertonic conditions). Construct 5 (−1,052 to +23 bp) which lacks the tonE element still maintained an osmotic response of 2.0-fold. Construct 8, which lacks 8 bp of sequence between the two guanosines protected in vivo (−915 to −908 bp) abolished the constitutive promoter activity. Construct 9, which contains all of the sequence of construct 1 except for a 177-bp deletion between −1,071 and −895 bp, abolished the constitutive activity and the osmotic response capability. These results indicated the presence of several regions involved in modulating the AR promoter activity and suggest the presence of an element(s) crucial for the constitutive activity and osmotic response located between −1,071 and −895 bp. Based on the luciferase gene expression experiments with construct 4, we tested transcription factor binding between −1,094 and −649 bp by using the ExoIII-mediated in vivo DNA footprinting method. This technique has been used to detect constitutive and hormone-induced factor binding to the mouse mammary tumor virus long terminal repeat (19Lee H.-L. Archer T.K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 32-41Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and is based on the fact that transcription factors upon binding, protect DNA from digestion with ExoIII nuclease. Under normal osmotic conditions, transient templates (construct 4) in isolated nuclei were digested with ExoIII and Asp718 (to supply an entry point for ExoIII) in the sense-directed digestion or with ExoIII and HindIII (to supply an entry point for ExoIII) in the antisense-directed digestion. A strong block to ExoIII digestion was detected at −926 bp for the sense strand-directed digestion and at −895 bp for the antisense strand-directed digestion (Fig.2). To observe whether the ExoIII protected region (−926 to −895 bp) was also protected in the endogeneous gene, dimethyl sulfate in vivo footprinting was performed (20Dey A. Thornton A.M. Lonergan M. Weissman S.M. Chamberlain J.W. Ozato K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 3590-3599Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Liver cells were grown in normal or hypertonic medium for 30 min or 3 h. The cells were then treated for 90 s with 0.1% dimethyl sulfate. As a control, DNA extracted from cells and treated with 0.1% dimethyl sulfate in vitro for 90 s was also analyzed by ligation-mediated PCR (LM-PCR) (Fig.3). When the intensity of the bands between the in vitro lane and the in vivo lanes were compared, two guanosines, at positions −915 and −908 bp, were strongly and reproducibly protected from methylation in cells grown in both normal or hypertonic medium as shown in comparison between lanes 4 and lanes 1–3. The relative intensity of the two guanosine bands was similar for normal and osmotic stress. This result confirms that a factor(s) binding to the region −926 to −895 bp occurs in vivo, and shows that occupancy of this site is constitutive in the endogeneous rat AR promoter. DNA probes were used to further evaluate putative transcription factor binding at −926 and −895 bp in the rat AR promoter. Probe A, which encompasses the 32-bp of sequence protected by ExoIII-mediated footprinting (Fig. 2), gave several complexes in EMSA experiments (Fig.4, lanes 2–4). These complexes were similar in normal and hypertonically-treated cells. In competition experiments, cold probe A caused inhibition of band complex formation (Fig. 4, lanes 5–7). Probe A8, which contains eight mutations, including the two guanosine nucleotides protected from methylation by dimethyl sulfate in vivo footprinting, did not show significant binding of the same factors (Fig. 4, lanes 8–10). This result was confirmed by a competition assay with cold mutated probe A8 which did not compete with wild type probe A (Fig. 4,lanes 11–13). The effect on constitutive activity and osmotic response of the thymidine kinase (TK) promoter (−105 to +52 bp) was studied by fusing a portion of 35-bp ExoIII-protected region to the 5′-end of the TK promoter (Fig.5). Construct pAEE35-TK, which contains the full 35-bp sequence of AEE, gave a 4-fold increase in basal activity as well as a 5.3-fold increase with osmotic stress. Construct pAEE28-TK (28 bp) which lacks 7 nucleotides of AEE gave the highest basal activity (7.7-fold) and the highest absolute activity under osmotic stress (100.00). Construct pAEE24-TK, which lacks 11 bp, was found to be the minimum required sequence for the functional induction of basal promoter activity and for the osmotic response. The constructs, pAEE20-TK and pTK, gave similar basal activity and no osmotic response. The transfection studies of the AR promoter region between −1,071 and −895 indicate important elements necessary for the increase of AR constitutive promoter activity and osmotic response (Fig.6). Within this region a tonE-like element (−1,071 to −1,059 bp), originally found as an osmotic response enhancer of the dog betaine transporter gene (TableI), was found (23Takenaka M. Preston A.S. Kwon H.M. Handler J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 29379-29381Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The sequence and the location of the element matches other tonE-like elements recently reported in the rabbit AR promoter between −1,108 and −1,092 bp (12Ferraris J.D. Williams C.K. Jung K.-Y.

The human tonE-like element has been reported at two positions, between −1,230 to −1,220 bp and −1,157 to −1,148 bp (11Ko B.C.B. Ruepp B. Bohren K.M. Gabbay K.H. Chung S.S.M. J. Biol.

Also, the lack of the tonE-like element had no effect on the high constitutive promoter activity. As the 5′-end of the promoter was deleted from construct 1 to construct 5, constitutive activity increased 7.0-fold suggesting that several negative regulatory elements may lie within this region. These results indicate that the most proximal cis-element required for the osmotic response and the constitutive promoter activity lie downstream of the tonE-like element. The ExoIII-mediated DNA footprinting method was used to scan the region between −1,094 and −649 bp for any DNA protection under normal osmolarity. ExoIII digestion was halted at positions −926 bp in the coding direction and at −895 bp in the noncoding direction, indicating that a 32-bp region was protected under normal osmotic conditions. This putative transcription factor binding sequence, indicated by the ExoIII method, was further studied by dimethyl sulfate in vivo DNA footprinting to determine whether the factor was bound to the endogeneous AR promoter and how it would be affected by osmotic stress. Two guanosines located at −915 and −908 bp within the 32-bp protected region were found to be protected from dimethyl sulfate methylation under both normal and hypertonic conditions. No change in the intensity of the DNA protection was observed under normal culture conditions, 30 min osmotic stress, or 3 h osmotic stress. No other sequence surrounding this ExoIII-protected region was observed protected from methylation by these experiments. Further confirmation of transcription factor binding and delineation of the critical nucleotides involved in binding were determined by EMSA. A probe containing the 35-bp protected sequence gave several intense complexes under normal and osmotic stress, while a probe containing eight nucleotide mutations, between and including the two guanosines protected in the dimethyl sulfate in vivo experiment, significantly reduced the transcription factor binding. Competition assays also confirmed that the sequences between the two guanosines are crucial for the transcription factor(s) to bind. No match was found to this sequence in the transcription factor data base. This novel cis-element was named aldose reductaseenhancer element (AEE). The regulatory properties of this novel cis-element were further demonstrated when various lengths of AEE were fused to the 5′-end of the thymidine kinase promoter (−105 to +52 bp). Surprisingly, construct pAEE28-TK gave a significant basal activity increase of 7.7-fold and an osmotic response of 5.7-fold, which is a higher increase than construct pAEE35-TK (Fig. 5). The minimum functional sequence for AEE was determined as 5′-GGGTGTTGGAAGAGTGCCAAATTT-3′ by construct pAEE24-TK and pAEE20-TK. Finally, luciferase assays were performed with constructs 8 and 9 to determine the effect of inhibition of AEE binding or inhibition of AEE plus tonE binding on promoter activity. Construct 8 was designed to only inhibit AEE binding by deleting 8 bp (5′-GAAGAGTG-3′) of the critical sequence determined by the EMSA experiment (Fig. 4). Both constructs 8 and 9 completely abolished the constitutive activity of the rat AR promoter, while construct 8 which includes tonE retained an osmotic response (2.5-fold). This unexpected finding suggests to us that the AEE element is critical for maintenance of constitutive activity. Deletion of AEE, which resulted in continued osmotic response, indicates the presence of other positive or negative elements. In conclusion, we have identified a new cis-element AEE, located downstream of the tonE-like element, which has a strong effect on the constitutive activity and osmotic response of the rat aldose reductase promoter. This enhancer is capable of inducing the basal activity of a heterologous promoter by 7.7-fold and osmotic response up to 6.7-fold. From our data on AEE and considering the fact that tonE-like elements have been reported in different locations in the AR promoter (11Ko B.C.B. Ruepp B. Bohren K.M. Gabbay K.H. Chung S.S.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 16431-16437Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar), it is likely that several elements might be involved in the control of the osmotic stress response. Identification of the relative role of these respective elements and their connection to the signal transduction pathway will be important in understanding the process of cellular osmoregulation. The in vivo occupancy of the AEE in the endogeneous AR promoter strongly suggests that this element plays a physiological role in the regulation of AR expression.

Because the cell of origin in all these tumors is a pluripotent mesenchymal cell, the variety of tumors seen in mice which express FBR v-Fos implies that FBR v-Fos inhibits multiple differentiation pathways. To study the mechanism of FBR v-Fos' inhibition of mesenchymal differentiation, we utilized an in vitro model of adipocyte differentiation. We show by both morphological and biochemical means that FBR v-Fos inhibits adipocyte differentiation in vitro. This inhibition is due to FBR v-Fos' inhibition of the growth arrest characteristic of terminal differentiation and FBR v-Fos' inhibition of the expression and activity of a key regulator of this growth arrest, C/EBPα. The in vitro inhibition of adipogenesis by FBR v-Fos has in vivo significance as immunostaining of FBR v-Fos-induced tumors shows no CCAAT/enhancer binding protein (EBP)-α expression. These data implicate C/EBPα as a protein involved in the generation of liposarcomas.

Clinically, cancers are graded according to their degree of differentiation. A high degree of differentiation of a cancer indicates a favorable prognosis while a low degree of differentiation indicates a poor prognosis (1Cotran R.S. Kumar V. Robbins S.L. Pathological Basis of Disease. W. B. Saunders, Philadelphia1994: 153-200Google Scholar). Despite the well established clinical relationship between differentiation and cancer, the molecular mechanisms by which this lack of differentiation occurs in high grade cancers are unknown. A model system to study this phenomenon has emerged through the use of the retroviral oncogene FBR v-fos. 1The abbreviations used are: FBR v-Fos, Finkel-Biskis-Reilly osteosarcoma virus v-Fos; C/EBP, CCAAT/enhancer binding protein; CAT, chloramphenicol acetyltransferase;neo R, neomycin resistance gene; G3PDH, glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase; EMSA, electrophoretic mobility shift assay; CRP, C-reactive protein; RSV, Rous sarcoma virus; MSV, murine sarcoma virus. FBR v-Fos is a fusion protein containing a retroviral gag gene, the mouse c-fos proto-oncogene, and the mouse c-fox gene (Fig. 1) (2Finkel M.P. Reilly Jr., C.A. Biskis B.O. Front. Radiat. Ther. Oncol. 1975; 10: 28-39Crossref Google Scholar, 3Lee C.K. Chan E.W. Reilly C.A. Pahnke V.A. Rockus G. Finkel M.P. Proc. Soc. Exp. Biol. Med. 1979; 162: 214-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar, 4Curran T. Verma I.M. Virology. 1984; 135: 218-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). The retroviral gag sequence contains a myristylation site which alters FBR v-Fos' carcinogenic potential (5Jotte R.M. Holt J.T. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 457-467Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). When FBR v-Fos is myristylated, transgenic mice which express this oncogene develop multiple undifferentiated tumors of mesenchymal origin, including rhabdomyosarcomas, chondrosarcomas, osteosarcomas, and liposarcomas (5Jotte R.M. Holt J.T. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 457-467Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). When the myristylation site of FBR v-Fos is altered in such a way that myristylation cannot occur (G2A v-Fos; Fig. 1), mice expressing this mutant retroviral oncogene develop only lipomas (5Jotte R.M. Holt J.T. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 457-467Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). The studies in the transgenic mice indicate that in vivo, FBR v-Fos can disrupt normal cellular differentiation pathways, and that since the effect on adipocytes is independent of the myristylation state of v-Fos, adipogenesis is particularly sensitive to inhibition by the Fos proteins. FBR v-Fos is thought to cause carcinogenesis via a two-step mechanism (6Abbott D.W. Holt J.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 14005-14008Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). First, transformation must occur. Second, genomic instability must be created. Our laboratory has recently shown that while FBR v-Fos and G2A v-Fos both cause transformation, only cells which express FBR v-Fos are highly susceptible to DNA damage caused by ionizing radiation. Cells which express G2A v-Fos show normal sensitivity to ionizing radiation (6Abbott D.W. Holt J.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 14005-14008Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). These data imply that the difference between benign tumors and malignant tumors lies in genomic instability. However, to reach the malignant phenotype, transformation must also occur. Because either FBR v-Fos or G2A v-Fos expression leads to tumor formation (either liposarcomas or lipomas, respectively) both FBR v-Fos and G2A v-Fos must be inhibiting adipocyte differentiation, and studying this step may give insight into the first step of FBR v-Fos-induced carcinogenesis. The study of adipocyte development has been made possible through the use of a pre-adipocyte cell line (NIH 3T3-L1) (8Green H. Kehinde O. Cell. 1974; 1: 113-116Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (746) Google Scholar, 9Green H. Kehinde O. Cell. 1975; 5: 19-27Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1097) Google Scholar, 10Green H. Kehinde O. Cell. 1976; 7: 105-113Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (616) Google Scholar). When exposed to isobutylmethylxanthine, dexamethosone, and insulin, confluent NIH 3T3-L1 cells begin to change their cytoskeletal shape and eventually become adipocytes (10Green H. Kehinde O. Cell. 1976; 7: 105-113Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (616) Google Scholar, 11Russell T.R. Ho R.-J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1976; 73: 4516-4520Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). Adipogenesis is initiated and maintained by the sequential expression of three tissue-specific transcription factors; C/EBPβ, PPARγ2, and C/EBPα (12MacDougald O.A. Lane M.D. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1995; 64: 345-373Crossref PubMed Scopus (943) Google Scholar, 13Yeh W.-C. McKnight S.L. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1995; 7: 885-890Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar, 14Tontonoz P. Hu E.

EMBO J. 1991; 10: 3787-3793Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). PPARγ2 is thought to be the major transcription factor responsible for the initiation of adipogenesis (14Tontonoz P. Hu E. Spiegelman B.M. Cell. 1994; 79: 1147-1156Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3133) Google Scholar) while C/EBPα is thought to be the major protein involved in the maintenance of adipogenesis (13Yeh W.-C. McKnight S.L. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1995; 7: 885-890Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar, 15Samuelsson L. Stromberg K. Vikman D Bjursell G. Enerback S. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 3787-3793Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). In the differentiated adipocyte, C/EBPα is the factor responsible for the expression of many fat cell-specific genes (16Christy R.J. Yang V. Ntambi J. Geiman D. Landschulz W.H. Friedman A. Nakabeppu Y. Kelly T. Lane M.D. Genes Dev. 1989; 3: 1323-1335Crossref PubMed Scopus (467) Google Scholar) including PEPCK (17Park E.A. Roesler W.J. Liu J. Klemm D.J. Gurney A.L. Thatcher J.D.

S. A. 1991; 88: 8465-8469Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Expression of C/EBPα has been shown to be both sufficient and necessary for adipocyte development as ectopic expression of C/EBPα will convert pre-adipocytes to adipocytes in the absence of hormonal stimulation (19Freytag S. Paielli D.L. Gilbert J.D. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 1654-1663Crossref PubMed Scopus (393) Google Scholar, 20Lin F.-T. Lane M.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 8757-8761Crossref PubMed Scopus (383) Google Scholar), and antisense inhibition of C/EBPα expression inhibits adipocyte development (21Lin F.-T. Lane M.D. Genes Dev. 1992; 6: 533-544Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar). Expression of C/EBPα also causes growth arrest (19Freytag S. Paielli D.L. Gilbert J.D. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 1654-1663Crossref PubMed Scopus (393) Google Scholar, 21Lin F.-T. Lane M.D. Genes Dev. 1992; 6: 533-544Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar, 22Hendricks-Taylor L.R.

Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 804-815Crossref PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar), a key characteristic of terminally differentiated cells. C/EBPα's maintenance of the characteristic growth arrest of terminally differentiated adipocytes is implicated in the formation of liposarcomas. CHOP, a member of the C/EBP family of proteins, is an antagonist of C/EBP-mediated transactivation (24Ron D. Habener J. Genes Dev. 1992; 6: 439-453Crossref PubMed Scopus (986) Google Scholar). In a myxoid liposarcoma, CHOP was identified in a chromosomal translocation fused to the Ews RNA-binding protein (25Crozat A. Aman P. Mandahl N. Ron D. Nature. 1993; 363: 640-644Crossref PubMed Scopus (762) Google Scholar, 26Rabbitts T.H. Forster A. Larson R. Nathan P. Nat. Genet. 1993; 4: 175-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (484) Google Scholar). This fusion protein allows constitutive activation of CHOP, thereby activating an inhibitor of C/EBPα activity (27Batchvarova N. Wang X.Z. Ron D. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 4654-4661Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). The CHOP-Ews fusion protein is sufficient for transformation of fibroblasts (28Zinszner H. Albalat R. Ron D. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 2513-2526Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar), implying that inhibition of C/EBP-mediated transactivation can subvert the C/EBPα-mediated growth arrest and lead to liposarcomas (29Hunter T. Cell. 1997; 8: 333-346Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (629) Google Scholar). Because FBR v-Fos and G2A v-Fos give rise to either liposarcomas or lipomas in transgenic mice (5Jotte R.M. Holt J.T. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 457-467Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar), we sought to study the mechanism of this inhibition of adipocyte development in vitro. We show that pre-adipocytes which express FBR v-Fos or G2A v-Fos do not differentiate into adipocytes. These cells begin the adipocyte differentiation pathway as they express normal levels of C/EBPβ, but later stages of differentiation are faulty as these cells do not express C/EBPα. These cells also do not undergo the growth arrest which is characteristic of terminally differentiated cells. We further show that expression of FBR v-Fos or G2A v-Fos causes decreased transcriptional activity of C/EBPα but not C/EBPβ. Lastly, by utilizing tumors from the FBR v-fos transgenic mice, we show that the expression pattern of the C/EBP proteins in vivomatches that seen in vitro. Thus, the use of FBR v-Fos to induce liposarcomas further implicates the C/EBP family of proteins as key factors in the generation of liposarcomas. NIH 3T3-L1 cells and HeLa cells were obtained from the American Type Tissue Collection (ATCC). These cells were grown in 10% fetal bovine serum (Sigma), 2 mml-glutamine (Sigma), and 1 × antimycotic/antibiotic (Sigma). RSV-neo, FBR v-Fos, and G2A v-Fos stable cell lines were generated by transfecting NIH 3T3-L1 cells with empty vector, FBR v-fos or G2A v-fos and the neomycin resistance gene (neo R) in a 9:1 ratio using calcium phosphate precipitation. Cells were then selected for 2 weeks in 1 mg/ml G418 (Sigma). Approximately 500–1000 colonies were pooled and shown to express FBR v-Fos or G2A v-Fos by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (5Jotte R.M. Holt J.T. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 457-467Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). CRP-CAT cells, CRP-CAT + FBR v-Fos cells and CRP-CAT + G2A v-Fos cells were generated in a similar manner, using a 9:9:1 ratio of CRP-CAT:empty vector:neo R, FBR v-fos or G2A v-fos:CRP-CAT:neo R. HeLa cells were used for transient transfection assays. These cells were transfected with the indicated amounts of CRP-CAT, FBR v-Fos, G2A v-Fos, C/EBPα, or C/EBPβ and β-galactosidase. Cells were transfected with a total of 23 μg of DNA, using Pgem 7Z(+) to standardize to equal amounts of DNA. Cells were transfected as described previously (30Graham F. van der Eb A. Virology. 1973; 52: 456-467Crossref PubMed Scopus (6499) Google Scholar). MSV-C/EBPα, MSV-C/EBPβ, FBR v-Fos, G2A v-Fos, and β-galactosidase were used as described previously (5Jotte R.M. Holt J.T. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 457-467Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar,31Kamata N. Jotte R.M. Holt J.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 765-772Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar, 32Kamata N.

Chem. 1994; 269: 16383-16396Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). CRP-CAT was obtained from Christian Trautwein and Michael Manns (Medizinishe Hochschule Hannover) (34Trautwein C. Walker D.L. Plumpe J. Manns M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 15130-15136Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Initiation and maintenance of differentiation was performed as described previously (35Yeh W.-C. Cao Z. Classon M. McKnight S.L. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 168-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (813) Google Scholar). All experiments were performed on low passage-number cells. Briefly, at confluence (day 0 of differentiation), cells were fed with medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum, 0.5 mmisobutylmethylxanthine (Sigma), 10 μg/mL insulin (Sigma), and 1 μm dexamethosone (Sigma). Two days later, the medium was replaced with medium containing 2.5 μg/ml insulin and 10% fetal bovine serum. The cells were refed with this medium every 2 days for the remainder of the differentiation period. Cells were fixed in 10% formaldehyde, and Oil Red O staining was performed as described previously (35Yeh W.-C. Cao Z. Classon M. McKnight S.L. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 168-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (813) Google Scholar). Cells were washed twice with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and scraped into a buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 1 mm EDTA, and 1 mmβ-mercaptoethanol. Cell suspensions were allowed to sit on ice for 10 min and then sonicated for 10 s. Cells were centrifuged for 10 min, and the protein concentration of the supernatant was determined using the Bio-Rad protein assay. G3PDH activities were then performed as described elsewhere (36Kozak L.P. Jensen J.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1974; 249: 7775-7781Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 37Wise L.S. Green H. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 273-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). 10 μg of total cell protein were added to a buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 5 mm EDTA, 0.16 NADH (Fluka Chemical Corp.), and 0.8 mm dihydroxyacetone phosphate (Fluka) in a total volume of 500 μl. This reaction was allowed to incubate at 30 °C for 30 min. Activity was measured using absorbance at 340 nm on a spectrophotometer. The reaction was linear for both time and enzyme concentration. Cells from each line were plated a day prior to the commencement of the differentiation protocol. For each cell line, 12 plates were used. At day 0 of differentiation, half the plates were subjected to the differentiation protocol and half were fed with normal medium (refed every 2 days). Cells were harvested and counted at the times indicated. Cells were differentiated for the time periods listed. Whole cells lysates were prepared as described above for the G3PDH assays. Equal amounts of lysates were treated with SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, 12% gel. Lysates were transferred to nitrocellulose filters (Amersham Corp.) for 2 h at 40 mV. To assure equal loading of proteins, the membranes were stained with Ponceau S prior to blocking. The nitrocellulose membrane was then blocked using 5% nonfat dry milk, 1% bovine serum albumin, 0.1% Tween 20 for 1 h. The blot was washed three times with Tris-buffered saline with 0.1% Tween 20 and exposed to a 1:1000 dilution of the chosen antibody for 1 h. After washing, the blot was then exposed to a horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) at a dilution of 1:2500 for 1 h. Bands were visualized using the ECL detection system (Amersham) using the manufacturer's procedures. Antibodies used (anti-C/EBPα and anti-C/EBPβ) were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. For CAT assays on the CRP-CAT, FBR v-Fos + CRP-CAT and G2A v-Fos + CRP-CAT stable cell lines, cells were differentiated for the time periods indicated. Cells were harvested and lysed by four cycles of freezing and thawing. Protein concentrations were standardized. CAT activity was determined as described previously (31Kamata N. Jotte R.M. Holt J.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 765-772Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). For CAT assays on the transiently transfected HeLa cells, cells were harvested 48 h after transfection. Cells were lysed by four cycles of freezing and thawing. Transfection efficiency was then standardized using β-galactosidase activity by methods previously described (38Kerr L.D. Holt J.T. Matrisian L.M. Science. 1988; 242: 1424-1427Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). CAT activity was assayed as described previously (31Kamata N. Jotte R.M. Holt J.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 765-772Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). RSV-neo cells and FBR v-Fos cells were subjected to the differentiation protocol for 2 days. Nuclei were isolated and proteins extracted by the method described in Rana et al.(39Rana B. Xie Y. Mischoulon D. Bucher N.L. Farmer S.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 18123-18132Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Protein concentrations were standardized, and EMSA was performed as described previously (39Rana B. Xie Y. Mischoulon D. Bucher N.L. Farmer S.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 18123-18132Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Briefly, 10 μg of nuclear extract from the indicated cell line was incubated with 3 mg of poly(dI-dC) in 25 μl of buffer containing a final concentration of 150 mmKCl, 25 mm Hepes (pH 7.6), 7.5% glycerol, 0.1 mm EDTA, and 2.5 mm MgCl2. A double-stranded oligonucleotide probe containing the C/EBP consensus site 5′-GATCCGCGTTGCGCCACGATG-3′ was end-labeled with [γ32P]ATP. Protein binding to the oligonucleotide was determined by electrophoresis on a nondenaturing 6% polyacrylamide gel in TBE buffer (0.09 m Tris borate, 2 mm EDTA (pH 8.0)). In supershift studies, 5 μl of appropriate antibody were preincubated with the protein mixture for 1 h at room temperature prior to the addition of the probe. After 8 days of differentiation, total RNA was harvested using the RNAeasy kit (Promega). Pgem7z-C/EBPα was digested with EcoRI/BamHI, and the resulting 1.4-kilobase pair fragment was isolated. This fragment was then random prime-labeled with [α-32P]dATP using the Prime-It II kit (Stratagene). 30 μg of RNA were electrophoresed on a formaldehyde gel and transferred to GeneScreen Plus. Prehybridization was performed using 200 μg/ml salmon sperm DNA, 6 × SSC, 50% formamide. Hybridization was then allowed to proceed overnight. The blot was washed five times in 2 × SSC, 1% SDS and subjected to autoradiography. Tumors were harvested from transgenic FBR v-Fos. Generation of these transgenic mice has already been reported (5Jotte R.M. Holt J.T. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 457-467Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). Processing of the tumor was conducted according to standard procedure by the Vanderbilt Cancer Center Human Tissue Acquisition and Pathology Shared Resource. Immunohistochemistry was conducted on an automatic stainer (model Techmate; Biotech Research Labs Inc., Rockville, MD) using a universal ABC detection kit with diaminobenzidine (DAB) chromagen using the following antibodies: anti-C/EBPα and anti-C/EBPβ (Santa Cruz Bioctechnology). Both antibodies were diluted 1:100. The transgenic mouse model suggested that both FBR v-Fos and G2A v-Fos inhibited adipocyte differentiation (5Jotte R.M. Holt J.T. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 457-467Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). To study this phenomenon further, we utilized an in vitro model of adipocyte differentiation. NIH 3T3-L1 cells are a pre-adipocyte cell line which will differentiate into adipocytes upon exposure at confluence to insulin, isobutylmethylxanthine, and dexamethosone for 2 days followed by exposure to insulin for the remainder of the differentiation period. By day 8 of the differentiation protocol, greater than 90% of the cells show overt morphological signs of adipocyte differentiation (8Green H. Kehinde O. Cell. 1974; 1: 113-116Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (746) Google Scholar, 9Green H. Kehinde O. Cell. 1975; 5: 19-27Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1097) Google Scholar, 10Green H. Kehinde O.

A. 1976; 73: 4516-4520Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). 3T3-L1 cell lines were made which stably expressed G2A v-Fos or FBR v-Fos. These cell lines were shown to constitutively express FBR v-Fos or G2A v-Fos by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (5Jotte R.M. Holt J.T. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 457-467Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar) and Western blotting (data not shown). The RSV-neo cells, FBR v-Fos cells, and G2A v-Fos cells were then allowed to grow to confluence and exposed to differentiation media for 8 days. The control cell line (RSV-neo cells) accumulated lipid droplets and showed morphological signs of adipocyte differentiation (Fig. 2). In contrast to the RSV-neo cells, neither the FBR v-Fos or G2A v-Fos cells showed any morphological signs of adipocyte differentiation (Fig. 2). The lack of morphological evidence of adipocyte differentiation in FBR v-Fos and G2A v-Fos cells was consistent as two additional cell lines derived independently from those shown in Fig. 2 gave similar results. In addition to morphological study of these stably transfected cell lines, we wanted to establish by biochemical means that FBR v-Fos and G2A v-Fos cells do not differentiate into adipocytes. G3PDH is an enzyme whose activity increases greatly as a cell differentiates into an adipocyte (36Kozak L.P. Jensen J.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1974; 249: 7775-7781Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 37Wise L.S. Green H. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 273-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 40Serrero G. Mills D. Proc.

Measuring the biochemical activity of this enzyme is a well established method to assay adipocyte differentiation (41Serrero G. Lepak N. Int. J. Obes. 1996; 3: 58-64Google Scholar). After 8 days of differentiation, RSV-neo cells, FBR v-Fos cells. and G2A v-Fos cells were lysed, and biochemical activity of G3PDH was assayed. RSV-neo cells showed over 50-fold greater G3PDH activity when compared with FBR v-Fos and G2A v-Fos cells (TableI), consistent with the fact that the RSV-neo cells differentiate to adipocytes, while neither the FBR v-Fos cells nor the G2A v-Fos cells differentiate to adipocytes.Table IGlycerophosphate dehydrogenase activity after 8 days of differentiation to adipocytesCell lineSpecific activity ± S.E.nmol NADH/mg protein/minRSV-neo1180 ± 9.40FBR v-Fos22.9 ± 7.201-ap values are <0.001 by Student's t test when compared to the RSV-neo cell line.G2A v-Fos23.8 ± 16.11-ap values are <0.001 by Student's t test when compared to the RSV-neo cell line.1-a p values are <0.001 by Student's t test when compared to the RSV-neo cell line. Open table in a new tab To begin to determine the molecular mechanism for this inability to differentiate, growth curves of RSV-neo cells, FBR v-Fos cells, and G2A v-Fos cells were measured. In normal adipocyte differentiation, cells must be growth-arrested before they began to show overt evidence of adipocyte differentiation (12MacDougald O.A. Lane M.D. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1995; 64: 345-373Crossref PubMed Scopus (943) Google Scholar, 42Umek R. Friedman A. McKnight S.L. Science. 1991; 251: 288-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (573) Google Scholar). Growth curves of differentiating pre-adipocytes should become relatively flat as the cells differentiate. To show that this is the case in our RSV-neo control cells, two plates of RSV-neo cells were plated at equal cell density for each of the six time points. At day 0, one plate of cells per time point began the differentiation protocol, while the other plate of cells per time point remained in normal media, maintaining a normal growth rate. Cell counts were taken 0, 1, 2, 3, 5, and 8 days after the beginning of the experiment. The RSV-neo cells remaining in normal medium showed exponential growth (Fig.3 A), while those undergoing adipogenesis showed a significantly lower rate of growth (Fig.3 B), consistent with differentiation to adipocytes. Both FBR v-Fos cells and G2A v-Fos cells showed a growth curve similar to the RSV-neo cells in normal media (Fig. 3 A), showing that the expression of these oncogenes does not increase the proliferation of these cells. Upon exposure to differentiation media, however, the G2A v-Fos cells showed no growth arrest, and the FBR v-Fos cells growth-arrested only slightly (Fig. 3 B). These results imply that FBR v-Fos and G2A v-Fos do not inhibit adipocyte differentiation by stimulating cell growth, but by inhibiting the growth arrest which is required for terminal adipocyte differentiation. The C/EBP family of transcription factors regulates fat cell-specific genes and is important for the initiation and maintenance of adipocyte differentiation (15Samuelsson L. Stromberg K. Vikman D Bjursell G. Enerback S. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 3787-3793Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar, 42Umek R. Friedman A. McKnight S.L. Science. 1991; 251: 288-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (573) Google Scholar). In an undifferentiated preadipocyte, C/EBPβ is expressed at a low level. One day after the initiation of the differentiation protocol, expression of C/EBPβ is greatly induced before decreasing at later differentiation stages (35Yeh W.-C. Cao Z. Classon M. McKnight S.L. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 168-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (813) Google Scholar). C/EBPα is not expressed in the undifferentiated preadipocyte, but as the cell begins to show overt signs of adipocyte differentiation (days 3–5), C/EBPα begins to become expressed (35Yeh W.-C. Cao Z. Classon M. McKnight S.L. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 168-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (813) Google Scholar). Since both C/EBPβ and C/EBPα are involved in a cascade regulation of adipocyte differentiation, we wanted to determine whether these proteins were expressed in FBR v-Fos and G2A v-Fos cells. By Western blot analysis, the RSV-neo cells show normal patterns of both C/EBPα and C/EBPβ expression. C/EBPβ is expressed early in differentiation, and expression lowers as the cell continues differentiating (Fig. 4,left/lower panel). In addition, the alternatively spliced C/EBPβ, liver inhibitory protein (43Descombes P. Schibler U. Cell. 1991; 67: 569-579Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (862) Google Scholar), which this antibody also recognizes, shows a similar expression pattern. C/EBPα begins to be expressed in the RSV-neo cells as the cell begins to reach the later stages of differentiation (Fig. 4, left/top panel). The expression pattern of these proteins is different in the FBR v-Fos and G2A v-Fos cells. In both cell lines, C/EBPβ is expressed at levels indistinguishable from RSV-neo cells (Fig. 4, compare lower panels). Since C/EBPβ expression is one of the earliest indicators of the initiation of adipogenesis (35Yeh W.-C. Cao Z. Classon M. McKnight S.L. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 168-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (813) Google Scholar), this implies that the early stages of adipogenesis are functioning normally in FBR v-Fos and G2A v-Fos cells. While the initiation of adipogenesis is unaltered, the expression pattern of C/EBPα shows that later stages of adipogenesis are faulty. Neither the FBR v-Fos cell line nor the G2A v-Fos cell line expresses C/EBPα (Fig. 4, upper middle and upper right panels; a positive control is shown in the far left lane of each blot). This expression pattern of C/EBPα is consistent with the fact that these cells do not differentiate. Moreover, the expression pattern of C/EBPβ and C/EBPα suggests that FBR v-Fos and G2A v-Fos affect adipo"
https://openalex.org/W2123930877,"In contrast to the F1-ATPases from bovine mitochondria and the thermophilic Bacillus PS3, which are reversibly inhibited by dequalinium in the absence of irradiation, the Mg2+-ATPase activity of heat- or dithiothreitol-activated chloroplast F1 (CF1) from spinach chloroplasts is slightly stimulated by dequalinium. Conversely, dequalinium is a partial inhibitor (maximal inhibition is 85–90%) of the Ca2+-ATPase of CF1 activated by heat, dithiothreitol, or octylglucoside. The Mg2+- and Ca2+-ATPase activities of CF1 respond differently in the presence of lauryl dimethylamine oxide (LDAO) in the assay medium. Whereas the Mg2+-ATPase activity of heat- or dithiothreitol-activated CF1 is stimulated up to 14-fold by increasing concentrations of LDAO, the Ca2+-ATPase is inhibited in a biphasic manner by increasing concentrations of LDAO. In the presence of LDAO, dequalinium does not stimulate the heat-activated Mg2+-ATPase over that promoted by LDAO alone. That dequalinium slightly stimulates Mg2+-ATPase activity although it inhibits Ca2+-ATPase activity can be reconciled by assuming that dequalinium binds to two sites in CF1, a stimulatory site that also binds LDAO and an inhibitory site. By acting as a partial inhibitor of the Mg2+-ATPase activity that it activates, the combined effect of dequalinium is modest stimulation. Irradiation of heat- or dithiothreitol-activated CF1 or the α3β3γ subcomplex of CF1 in the presence of 12 μm dequalinium led to rapid photoinactivation. ATP and ADP, separately or in combination with Mg2+, protect against photoinactivation. After photoinactivating the α3β3γ subcomplex of CF1 with [14C]dequalinium, tryptic and peptic digests of the isolated, derivatized β subunit were fractionated by high performance liquid chromatography. Sequencing of the isolated, radioactive tryptic and peptic peptides revealed that Metβ183, which is at or near the catalytic site, is derivatized in a single β subunit when CF1 is photoinactivated with [14C]dequalinium.

The ATP synthase complex of chloroplast thylakoid membranes catalyzes ATP synthesis coupled to a proton electrochemical gradient across the thylakoid membrane generated by light. The membrane-bound enzyme comprises an integral membrane protein complex, CF0, 1The abbreviations used are: CF0, the membrane sector of the chloroplast ATP synthase; CF1, MF1, and TF1, the F1-ATPase from chloroplasts, mitochondria, and the thermophilic BacillusPS3, respectively; CF1(−δ), CF1 deficient in the δ subunit; DTT, dithiothreitol; LDAO, lauryldimethylamine oxide; Rubisco, ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; AMP-PNP, adenosine 5′-(β,γ-iminotriphosphate). and a peripheral membrane protein complex, CF1. CF0mediates transmembrane proton conduction, whereas CF1contains the catalytic sites for ATP synthesis. The CF1 portion of ATP synthase can be easily removed from the thylakoid membrane. Isolated CF1 is composed of five different subunits, designated α, β, γ, δ, and ε in order of decreasing molecular weight with a stoichiometry of α3β3γδε, and has a molecular mass of 400 kDa (1Moroney J.L. Lopreseti I. McEwen B.F. McCarty R.E. Hammes G.G. FEBS Lett. 1983; 158: 58-62Crossref Scopus (99) Google Scholar). CF1 contains six binding sites for adenine nucleotides (2Girault G. Berger G. Galmiche J.-M. Andre F. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 14690-14695Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), three of which participate directly in catalysis, whereas the other three, which are called noncatalytic sites, do not have a well defined functional role. Isolated CF1 is a latent ATPase, which can be activated with dithiothreitol (DTT) (3McCarty R.E. Racker E. J. Biol.

DTT treatment reduces the disulfide bond within the γ subunit (8Arana J.L. Vallejos R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 1125-1127Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), while heat activation relieves inhibition caused by the ε subunit (9Nelson N. Nelson H. Racker E. J. Biol. Chem. 1972; 247: 6506-6510Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar,10Patrie W.J. McCarty R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 11121-11128Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Trypsin digestion partially cleaves the γ subunit, which significantly decreases the affinity of CF1 for the ε subunit (11Soteropoulos P. Süss K.-H. McCarty R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 10348-10354Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 12Hightower K.E. McCarty R.E. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 4846-4851Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). The effects of octylglucoside and organic solvents on CF1 are more complicated. Octylglucoside may remove the inhibitory ε subunit, decrease inhibition by free Mg2+, and also increase the affinity for substrate (7Pick U. Bassilian S. Biochemistry. 1982; 21: 6144-6152Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 13Feng Y. McCarty R.E. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1985; 238: 61-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). One effect of organic solvent is to overcome inhibition by the ε subunit. A second activating effect may be a decrease of the affinity for inhibitory MgADP (14Anthon G.E. Jagendorf A.T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1986; 848: 92-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). The F1-ATPases are inhibited by a variety of amphipathic cations that include substituted phenothiazines (15Chazotte B.

The binding sites for quinacrine mustard and dequalinium have been partly defined by labeling studies on TF1 and MF1. Inactivation of MF1 with quinacrine mustard is due, at least in part, to modification of one or more of the carboxylic acid side chains in the DELSEED segment of β subunit (25Bullough D.A. Ceccarelli E.A. Verburg J.G. Allison W.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 9155-9163Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), which, according to the x-ray structure, participates in a catch contact with Lys87 and Lys90 on the γ subunit (26Abrahams J.P. Leslie A.G.W. Lutter R. Walker J.E. Nature. 1994; 370: 621-628Crossref PubMed Scopus (2764) Google Scholar). Dequalinium inhibits MF1 noncompetitively in the absence of light (17Bullough D.A. Ceccarelli E.A. Roise D. Allison W.S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1989; 975: 377-383Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 22Zhuo S. Allison W.S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1988; 152: 968-971Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Irradiation of MF1 in the presence of dequalinium at 350 nm rapidly inactivates the enzyme. Photoinactivation of MF1with [14C]dequalinium results in the labeling of Pheα403 and Pheα406 in mutually exclusive reactions and a side chain within residues 440–459 of the β subunit (23Zhuo S. Paik S.R. Register J.A. Allison W.S. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 2219-2227Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). To a certain extent, dequalinium cross-links the α and β subunits of MF1, indicating that the reagent spans the distance between Pheα403 or Pheα406 and a side chain within residues 440–459 of the β subunit. Dequalinium interacts differently with TF1. Although it inhibits TF1 and MF1 noncompetitively, a long lag is introduced when TF1 is assayed in the presence of dequalinium, a phenomenon not observed with MF1. Irradiation of TF1 in the presence of dequalinium inactivates the enzyme, which is accompanied by derivatization of Phe420 (equivalent to Pheβ424 of MF1) in the nucleotide binding domain of a single β subunit (24Paik S.R. Jault J.-M. Allison W.S. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 126-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Groth and Junge (27Groth G. Junge W. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 8589-8596Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar) reported that dequalinium blocks proton release from the CF0CF1-ATP synthase under conditions of proton slip, a conducting state observed when ADP and Piare not present to consume the proton electrochemical potential generated when thylakoids are illuminated. They assumed that the DELSEED segment of the β subunit, which is derivatized when MF1 is inactivated with quinacrine mustard, is part of the binding site for dequalinium on CF1 (27Groth G. Junge W. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 8589-8596Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). Given that MF1 and TF1 respond differently to dequalinium and that different residues in the two enzymes are derivatized when they are photoinactivated with [14C]dequalinium, it was of interest to determine if the interaction of dequalinium with CF1 resembles more its interaction with MF1 or TF1. Reagents for gel electrophoresis were purchased from Bio-Rad. Enzymes and biochemicals used in assays and dequalinium dichloride were purchased from Sigma. LDAO (30% aqueous solution) was purchased from Calbiochem. Pepsin was purchased from Sigma. Sequence grade modified trypsin was purchased from Promega. HPLC solvents were purchased from Fisher. Centricon 30 was obtained from Amicon. [14C]Dequalinium with a specific radioactivity of 2.9 cpm/pmol was synthesized as described previously (23Zhuo S. Paik S.R. Register J.A. Allison W.S. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 2219-2227Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). CF1 was prepared by modification of previously described methods (28Jagendorf A.T. Edelman M. Hallick R.B. Chua N.-H. Methods in Chloroplast Molecular Biology. Elsevier Biomedical Press, New York1982: 881-898Google Scholar, 29Lien S. Racker E. Methods Enzymol. 1971; 23: 547-555Crossref Scopus (219) Google Scholar). After CF1 was purified by anion exchange on DEAE-cellulose (Whatman) and DEAE-Sephadex (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.), considerable Rubisco remained, which was removed as follows. A solution of CF1 (150 mg) in buffer A (50 mmTris-SO4, pH 8.0, 1 mm EDTA, and 1 mm ATP) containing 0.5 m(NH4)2SO4 was applied to a 2.5 × 8 cm column of Butyl-Toyopearl-650S (Toso-Haas), which was equilibrated with the same buffer. After application, the column was washed with two volumes of the same buffer. Rubisco was eluted by washing with 100 ml of 0.2 m(NH4)2SO4 in buffer A. The column was then washed with 100 ml of 0.15 m(NH4)2SO4 in buffer A, which eluted a small amount of CF1 deficient in the δ subunit, CF1(−δ), a trace amount of residual Rubisco, and contaminating proteins that migrate behind the α subunit on SDS-PAGE. Finally, pure, intact CF1 as assessed by SDS-PAGE was eluted with buffer A. The specific activity of CF1 was 26 μmol of ATP hydrolyzed min−1 mg−1 when assayed at 30 °C in the presence of 30 mm octylglucoside (7Pick U. Bassilian S. Biochemistry. 1982; 21: 6144-6152Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). When CF1, prepared as described above, was reapplied to the Butyl-Toyopearl-650S column in buffer A containing 0.5 m(NH4)2SO4 and then developed with a linear gradient of 0.5–0 m(NH4)2SO4 in buffer A in a total volume of 600 ml, CF1(−δ), as assessed by SDS-PAGE, eluted as a single peak in fractions 65–90 of the 6.5-ml fractions collected. The column was then washed with 50 ml of buffer A, which removed a single peak containing mostly δ subunit and trace amounts of the α, β, γ, and ε subunits as assessed by SDS-PAGE. This peak probably represents free δ subunit containing a trace of intact CF1. CF1(−δ) prepared in this manner was stored at 4 °C after precipitation with 50% saturated (NH4)2SO4. The α3β3γ subcomplex, CF1depleted of the δ and ε subunits, was prepared from CF1(−δ) by the method described for preparing CF1(−ε) (10Patrie W.J. McCarty R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 11121-11128Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Peptide separations by HPLC were conducted as described previously (23Zhuo S. Paik S.R. Register J.A. Allison W.S. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 2219-2227Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 24Paik S.R. Jault J.-M. Allison W.S. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 126-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Protein concentrations were determined by the method of Bradford (30Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (217546) Google Scholar) with Coomassie Blue Plus from Pierce, but using a correction factor of 1.5 based on an A 277 of 0.483 cm2/mg determined for CF1 (31Bruist M.F. Hammes G.G. Biochemistry. 1981; 20: 6298-6305Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). Molar concentrations of CF1 were based on a molecular mass of 400 kDa (1Moroney J.L. Lopreseti I. McEwen B.F. McCarty R.E. Hammes G.G. FEBS Lett. 1983; 158: 58-62Crossref Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Radioactivity was determined by scintillation counting in Ecoscint from National Diagnostics. CF1 was activated with DTT (8Arana J.L. Vallejos R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 1125-1127Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) or heat in the absence of 10 mm DTT (32Vallejos R.H. Ravizzini R.A. Andreo C.S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1977; 459: 20-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Excess ATP and DTT were removed using centrifuge columns of Sephadex G-50 (33Penefsky H.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1977; 252: 2891-2899Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) equilibrated with 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, for heat-activated CF1 and 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, and 1 mm DTT for DTT-activated CF1. The Mg2+-ATPase was determined spectrophotometrically using the ATP regeneration system described previously (34Jault J.-M. Allison W.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 1558-1566Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Ca2+-ATPase was determined by either inorganic phosphate release using the method of Taussky and Shorr with 5 mm ATP and 5 mm CaCl2(35Taussky H.H. Shorr E. J. Biol. Chem. 1953; 202: 675-685Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) or the enzyme-coupled assay method of Bruist and Hammes (36Bruist M.F. Hammes G.G. Biochemistry. 1982; 21: 3370-3377Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Octylglucoside-dependent Mg2+- and Ca2+-ATPase were assayed using the conditions of Pick and Bassilian (7Pick U. Bassilian S. Biochemistry. 1982; 21: 6144-6152Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). A solution of the α3β3γ subcomplex of CF1 at about 1 mg/ml in 50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 8.0, containing 7 mm β-mercaptoethanol and 14 μm[14C]dequalinium was irradiated at 350 nm in a Rayonet photochemical reactor. Samples were withdrawn with time and assayed for residual Mg2+-ATPase activity in the presence of octylglucoside (7Pick U. Bassilian S. Biochemistry. 1982; 21: 6144-6152Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). When the ATPase was photoinactivated by 80%, the reaction mixture was concentrated to 0.5 ml with a Centricon 30 membrane and passed through a 5-ml centrifuge column of Sephadex G-50 equilibrated with 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, to remove unbound [14C]dequalinium. The labeled α3β3γ subcomplex was dialyzed against 2 liters of medium consisting of 50 mm sodium succinate, 1m NaCl, 0.25 m NaNO3, 0.1 mm DTT, 4 mm EDTA, pH 6.1, overnight at 4 °C as described by Michel et al. (37Michel L. Garin J. Girault G. Vignais P.V. FEBS Lett. 1992; 313: 90-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (2) Google Scholar). Protein precipitated during dialysis, and was recovered by centrifugation. Analysis of the supernatant and precipitate revealed that the supernatant contained mostly β subunit with small amounts of the α and γ subunits, whereas the precipitate contained mostly α and γ subunits and a trace of the β subunit. The supernatant was applied to a hydroxyapatite column (Bio-Rad HTP, 1.5 × 5 cm) equilibrated with 25 mm Tricine-NaOH, pH 8.0, 0.2 mm EDTA, 0.1 mm ATP, and 0.1 mm DTT at 4 °C. The column was washed with two volumes of equilibration buffer. The β subunit was eluted with the same buffer supplemented with 30 mmsodium phosphate, pH 8.0 (38Richter M.L. Gromet-Elhanan Z. McCarty R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 12109-12113Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The solution containing β subunit was dried under vacuum and dissolved in 6 m guanidine HCl. About 1.5 mg of pure β subunit was obtained from 6 mg of α3β3γ subcomplex. Based on the amount of14C incorporated per mol of β subunit, 27% of the isolated β subunit was labeled by [14C]dequalinium. Prior to pepsin digestion, the denatured β subunit in guanidine HCl was dialyzed against 2 liters of 1% (v/v) formic acid overnight at 4 °C. An aqueous solution of pepsin was added to a final pepsin:protein ratio of 1:50. Digestion was performed at 30 °C for 4 h with continuous stirring and was interrupted by freezing at −20 °C. Prior to trypsin digestion, the denatured β subunit in guanidine HCl was dialyzed against 2 liters of distilled water overnight at 4 °C. The β subunit precipitated during dialysis and was collected by centrifugation. The protein was suspended in 500 μl of Tris-HCl, pH 8.0. Trypsin was added to a final protease:protein ratio of 1:50. Digestion was carried out at 37 °C for 4 h with continuous stirring and was interrupted by freezing at −20 °C. The neutral detergent LDAO stimulates the ATPase activity of F1-ATPase preparations from Escherichia coli with and without the ε subunit (39Dunn S.D. Tozer R.G. Zadorozny V.D. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 4335-4340Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar), and it also stimulates TF1-ATPase preparations with and without the δ and ε subunits (40Jault J.-M. Matsui T. Jault F.M. Kaibara C. Muneyuki E. Yoshida M. Kagawa Y. Allison W.S. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 16412-16418Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Since the ATPase activity of latent CF1 is activated by octylglucoside (7Pick U. Bassilian S. Biochemistry. 1982; 21: 6144-6152Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar) or methanol (14Anthon G.E. Jagendorf A.T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1986; 848: 92-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar), the effects of LDAO on the Mg2+-ATPase activity of CF1 and the α3β3γ subcomplex of CF1 were examined. Fig. 1 A illustrates that LDAO stimulates the Mg2+-ATPase activity of heat- or DTT-activated CF1, latent CF1 and the latent or DTT-activated α3β3γ subcomplex of CF1. Each was stimulated maximally at LDAO concentrations between 0.2 and 0.4%. In this range of LDAO concentration, heat-activated CF1, latent CF1, and the latent α3β3γ subcomplex were stimulated about 12-, 14-, and 6-fold, respectively. DTT-activated CF1 and the DTT-activated α3β3γ subcomplex were stimulated 14- and 6-fold, respectively. The finding that LDAO stimulates the latent α3β3γ subcomplex only half as much observed for latent CF1 and heat-activated CF1 indicates that part of the simulation of intact CF1 by LDAO is caused by displacement of the ε subunit from an inhibitory position. The same argument applies to the difference in LDAO-induced stimulations observed for DTT-activated CF1 and the DTT-activated α3β3γ subcomplex. A similar difference is observed when stimulation of E. coli F1 by LDAO is compared with that of E. coli F1 deleted of the ε subunit (39Dunn S.D. Tozer R.G. Zadorozny V.D. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 4335-4340Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). In contrast to the Mg2+-ATPase activity, which is stimulated by LDAO, the Ca2+-ATPase shows a biphasic response to increasing concentrations of LDAO illustrated in Fig.1 B. The Ca2+-ATPase activity of heat-activated, DTT-activated CF1 and the latent α3β3γ subcomplex are progressively inhibited by increasing concentrations of LDAO up to about 0.025%. Thereafter, the activity progressively activates, reaching a plateau where little further activation is observed with increasing LDAO concentration. A possible explanation for this apparent anomaly is as follows. The sharp dip in Fig. 1 B occurring at about 0.025% LDAO may represent the critical micelle concentration of LDAO under the ionic conditions of the experiment. In water, the critical micelle concentration of LDAO is 0.05% (41Helenius A. McCaslin D.R. Fries E. Tanford C. Methods Enzymol. 1979; 56: 734-739Crossref PubMed Scopus (598) Google Scholar). At LDAO concentrations over 0.025%, increasing concentrations of micelles are present, which might stimulate ATPase activity. When isolated from spinach chloroplasts, CF1is a latent ATPase that can be activated by a variety of methods. After heat activation or DTT activation, CF1 has low Mg2+-ATPase activity of 0.54 μmol of Pimg−1 min−1 or 0.59 μmol of Pimg−1 min−1, respectively, illustrated in Fig.2 A. Since dequalinium inhibits the ATPase activities of MF1 and TF1 (23Zhuo S. Paik S.R. Register J.A. Allison W.S. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 2219-2227Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 24Paik S.R. Jault J.-M. Allison W.S. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 126-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar), it was surprising to find that it stimulates the Mg2+-ATPase activity of heat-activated CF1 and DTT-activated CF1, whereas it has no effect on the Mg2+-ATPase activity of latent CF1. Heat-activated CF1 and DTT-activated CF1behaved differently in the presence of dequalinium. The heat-activated Mg2+-ATPase was maximally stimulated by about 50% with 10 μm dequalinium. At higher concentrations, stimulation declined. In contrast, the Mg2+-ATPase activity of DTT-activated CF1 was stimulated maximally by about 80% with 30 μm dequalinium. However, in this case, stimulation did not decline with increasing dequalinium in the concentration range examined. In the presence of 0.2% LDAO, dequalinium does not stimulate the Mg2+-ATPase activity of heat-activated CF1 over that stimulated by LDAO alone. In fact, concentrations of dequalinium greater than 15–20 μm inhibit Mg2+-ATPase activity in the presence of 0.2% LDAO. Whereas dequalinium inhibits the Mg2+-ATPase activity of the α3β3γ subcomplex of CF1before it is activated with DTT, the subcomplex is stimulated over 2-fold in the presence of 30 μm dequalinium after it is activated with DTT. In the presence of 0.2% LDAO, dequalinium only slightly stimulated the Mg2+-ATPase activity of the DTT-activated α3β3γ subcomplex over that observed in the presence of LDAO alone. Fig. 2 B shows that dequalinium inhibits the Ca2+-ATPase activity of CF1 activated by treatment with DTT, heat, or octylglucoside. Unlike the Mg2+-ATPase activity, the Ca2+-ATPase activity is inhibited at all concentrations of dequalinium examined. AK i value of 4.0 μm was determined from a Dixon plot for inhibition of heat-activated Ca2+-ATPase activity by dequalinium. When heat-activated CF1 was irradiated at 350 nm in the presence of dequalinium, and then assayed for Mg2+-ATPase activity in the presence of octylglucoside (7Pick U. Bassilian S. Biochemistry. 1982; 21: 6144-6152Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar), first order decay of enzyme activity was observed. Although in the presence of LDAO, low concentrations of dequalinium no longer stimulate the Mg2+-ATPase of heat-activated CF1, it has no effect on the rate of photoinactivation of heat-activated CF1 by dequalinium (data not shown). Pseudo-first order rate constants, summarized in Table I, were determined for photoinactivation of heat-activated CF1by 12 μm dequalinium in the presence or absence of ligands. Inorganic phosphate and pyrophosphate had almost no effect on the rate of photoinactivation, whereas ADP, ATP, and Mg2+ provided protection against photoinactivation. The combination of ADP plus Mg2+ and ATP plus Mg2+ were the most effective, each decreasing the rate of inactivation nearly 10-fold. Ca2+ alone or in combination with ADP or ATP also provides protection against photoinactivation, but is not as effective as Mg2+ alone or in combination with ADP or ATP. Since ATP in the presence of Mg2+ or Ca2+ is hydrolyzed by heat-activated CF1, the latter combinations contained a mixture of MgADP and MgATP or CaADP and CaATP.Table IEffect of ligands on the photoinactivation of CF 1 by dequaliniumLigandkinactLigandkinactmin−1min−1None3.45 × 10−2ADP + Pi2.56 × 10−2Pi3.45 × 10−2ADP + Mg2+4.66 × 10−3PPi3.83 × 10−2ADP + Mg2+ + Pi6.33 × 10−3ADP2.46 × 10−2ATP + Mg2+4.89 × 10−3ATP1.28 × 10−2PPi + Mg2+1.13 × 10−2Mg2+1.05 × 10−2Pi + Mg2+8.02 × 10−3Ca2+2.35 × 10−2ADP + Ca2+2.13 × 10−2ATP + Ca2+2.13 × 10−2 Open table in a new tab Fig. 3 shows the pattern of radioactive peptides obtained when a sample of heat-activated CF1 that had been photoinactivated by 80% with [14C]dequalinium was submitted to SDS-PAGE. About 1.4 mol of reagent/mol of CF1 was incorporated. The percentages of the 14C in the labeled CF1applied to the gel that were recovered in the α, β, γ, δ, and ε subunits are shown in Fig. 3. The 20% 14C found in slices 2 and 3 apparently represents derivatized CF1 that resisted depolymerization by SDS. A comparable band was not observed in the lane containing unmodified CF1 submitted to SDS-PAGE on the same gel. It is clear that the β subunit was predominantly labeled with [14C]dequalinium. With the exception of the α subunit, which was slightly labeled compared with β, very little radioactivity was covalently bound to the other subunits. A tryptic digest of the isolated β subunit prepared from the α3β3γ subcomplex derivatized with [14C]dequalinium as described under “Experimental Procedures” was submitted to HPLC on a C4 column equilibrated with 12 mm HCl. After the column was washed with 12 mm HCl for 10 min, it was developed with a linear gradient of 0–15% acetonitrile in 12 mm HCl for 10 min and then with a linear gradient from 15 to 53% acetonitrile in 12 mm. A single radioactive peak eluted from the column at 270 min and accounted for about 5% of the radioactivity applied. The resulting peptide was submitted to automatic Edman degradation, which revealed the sequence T-V-L-I-X-E-L-I-N-N corresponding to residues 179–188 of the β subunit. The “X” represents a cycle in which no detectable phenylthiohydantoin-amino acid was released. This is the position occupied by Metβ183 in CF1. Since the labeled tryptic peptide was obtained in only 5% yield, a peptic digest of the labeled β subunit was fractionated by HPLC using the scheme illustrated in Fig. 4. Two radioactive fractions, P1-A and P1-B, were isolated, which accounted for 9.1% and 32.1%, respectively, of the total 14C in the peptic digest submitted to the fractionation procedure. Automatic Edman degradation of the materials in P1-A and P1-B revealed the same tripeptide with the sequence: I-X-E. There are five segments in the β subunit of CF1 containing an I-X-E sequence. Only one of the tripeptide segments contains Met in the position designated X. This is Metβ183. The finding that the sequence of the labeled peptic peptides corresponds to the sequence of the labeled tryptic peptide strongly implicates Metβ183 as the site of derivatization when CF1 is photoinactivated with [14C]dequalinium. To ensure that photoinactivation of the different forms of CF1 examined in this study proceeds with modification of Metβ183, 1-mg samples of latent CF1, heat activated CF1 in the presence or absence of 0.1% LDAO, DTT-activated CF1, and the latent α3β3γ subcomplex of CF1 were inactivated with 12 μm [14C]dequalinium using the spectrophotometric assay in the presence of octylglucoside to monitor inactivation. After photoinactivation, each sample was denatured and digested with pepsin. The peptic digests were submitted to HPLC under the conditions described above for the large scale preparation of peptic peptides derived from the isolated β subunit derivatized with [14C]dequalinium. The profiles of radioactivity in the effluents of the peptic digests were essentially identical to the profiles obtained in the large scale fractionation of peptic peptides derived from the isolated β subunit derivatized with [14C]dequalinium. From these analyses, we conclude that Metβ183 is the major site of derivatization when each form of CF1 was photoinactivated with [14C]dequalinium. Given that 27% of the β subunit was derivatized on 80% photoinactivation of the α3β3γ subcomplex of CF1 by [14C]dequalinium, we also conclude that modification of Met183 in a single β subunit is sufficient for complete photoinactivation. It is clear from the results presented that photoinactivation of the various forms of CF1 with dequalinium is caused by derivatization of Metβ183. This residue corresponds to Metβ167 of MF1 (42Walker J.E. Fearnley L.M. Gay N.T. Gibson B.W. Northrop F.D. Powell S.J. Runswick M.J. Saraste M. Tybulewicz V.L.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1985; 184: 677-701Crossref PubMed Scopus (381) Google Scholar). Fig.5 shows that Metβ167 of MF1 is among a cluster of apolar amino acid residues that line a cavity surrounding the side chain of Gluβ199, a conserved residue near the catalytic nucleotide binding site. It is possible that the positive charge on one of the quinaldinium moieties of dequalinium interacts with the side chain of the equivalent of Gluβ199 in CF1. Comparison of the unliganded catalytic site, βE, illustrated in Fig. 5 A, with the catalytic site of MF1 liganded with AMP-PNP clearly shows that the side chain of Metβ167 shifts away from the entrance of this cavity when the catalytic site is liganded. In βDP (data not shown), the side chain of Metβ167 is also shifted away from the entrance to the cavity. This is consistent with the observation that ADP and ATP, especially when complexed with Mg2+, protect CF1 against photoinactivation by dequalinium. It is interesting that photoinactivation of TF1 with dequalinium, which has a glutamine residue in the position corresponding to Metβ167 of MF1 (43Andrews W.W. Yoshida M. Hill F.C. Allison W.S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1984; 123: 1040-1046Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar), leads to derivatization of Pheβ420, which corresponds to Pheβ424 of MF1. Fig. 5 shows that Pheβ424 is near the entrance of the hydrophobic cavity. The change in orientation of helix B with respect to helix C is extraordinarily large in going from the unliganded catalytic site shown in Fig. 5 A to the liganded catalytic site shown in Fig. 5 B. Derivatization of either Metβ183 in CF1 or Pheβ420 in TF1 probably blocks this conformational change. The finding that dequalinium binds at or near a catalytic site of CF1 is difficult to reconcile with the results of Groth and Junge (27Groth G. Junge W. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 8589-8596Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar), who reported that ADP blocks proton slip mediated by CF0F1 at the electrogenic step, whereas dequalinium blocks the proton release step. To explain the differential effects of dequalinium and ADP on proton slip, Groth and Junge (27Groth G. Junge W. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 8589-8596Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar) assumed that dequalinium does not bind to a catalytic site. The anomalous finding that, in the absence of light, dequalinium stimulates Mg2+-ATPase activity, whereas it inhibits Ca2+-ATPase activity of CF1 activated by dithothreitol or heat, can be explained by assuming that, in addition to binding to an inhibitory site at or near a catalytic site, dequalinium binds to a stimulatory site that also binds LDAO. The finding that dequalinium stimulates the Mg2+-ATPase activity of heat-activated CF1 at lower concentrations of LDAO, whereas it inhibits the ATPase activity at higher concentrations of LDAO, is consistent with this assumption. LDAO stimulates the α3β3γ subcomplex of TF1 by promoting dissociation of inhibitory MgADP from a catalytic site during turnover (40Jault J.-M. Matsui T. Jault F.M. Kaibara C. Muneyuki E. Yoshida M. Kagawa Y. Allison W.S. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 16412-16418Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Since isolated CF1 contains ADP tightly bound to a single catalytic site, which is converted to inhibitory MgADP in the presence of medium Mg2+ (44Murataliev M.B. Milgrom Y.M. Boyer P.D. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 8305-8310Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 45Vitseva O.I. Malyan A.N. Biochemistry (Moscow). 1990; 61: 251-255Google Scholar), that part of activation of CF1 by LDAO that is independent of the ε subunit is likely to occur by the same mechanism. In experiments not shown, it was found that addition of low concentrations of dequalinium to heat- or DTT-activated CF1 in the presence of 0.2% LDAO does not stimulate Mg2+-ATPase activity above the level observed in the presence of LDAO alone. This suggests that dequalinium also stimulates the Mg2+-ATPase activity of CF1in the same manner as LDAO. However in the presence of LDAO, higher concentrations of dequalinium still slightly inhibit the Mg2+-ATPase of heat-activated CF1. This also suggests that CF1 contains a low affinity inhibitory site for dequalinium that does not bind LDAO. In contrast, the Ca2+-ATPase of CF1 is not inhibited by CaADP bound to a single catalytic site (46Zhou J.-M. Xue Z. Du Z. Melese T. Boyer P.D. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 5129-5135Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Fig. 2 B shows that dequalinium is a partial inhibitor of the Ca2+-ATPase activity of CF1. Dequalinium is also a partial inhibitor of MF1 and TF1 (22Zhuo S. Allison W.S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1988; 152: 968-971Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 24Paik S.R. Jault J.-M. Allison W.S. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 126-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Maximal inhibition of each enzyme by dequalinium is not greater than 85–90%. Therefore, dequalinium may act both as an activator of the Mg2+-ATPase activity of CF1, by promoting dissociation of inhibitory MgADP from a catalytic site, and as a partial inhibitor of the Mg2+-ATPase activity that it activates. The combined effect of dequalinium is the relatively modest stimulation of Mg2+-ATPase activity observed, compared with that promoted by LDAO. In contrast to its effect on Mg2+-ATPase activity, dequalinium only inhibits the Ca2+-ATPase activity of heat-, DTT-, and octylglucoside-activated CF1. Unlike the Mg2+-ATPase activity, the Ca2+-ATPase activities of heat-activated CF1, DTT-activated CF1, and the latent α3β3γ subcomplex are inhibited by low concentrations of LDAO. These observations support an earlier report (46Zhou J.-M. Xue Z. Du Z. Melese T. Boyer P.D. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 5129-5135Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar) that the Ca2+-ATPase activity of CF1 is not subject to inhibition caused by binding of CaADP in a single catalytic site. Consistent with this argument, Leckband and Hammes (47Leckband D. Hammes G.G. Biochemistry. 1987; 26: 2306-2312Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar) reported that the initial rate of Ca2+-ATP hydrolysis by heat-activated CF1 is triggered by free Ca2+. In contrast, free Mg2+ inhibits the Mg2+-ATPase activity of CF1 by interacting with ADP bound to a catalytic site to form the inhibited CF1·ADPMg complex. The finding that derivatization occurs at or near a catalytic site when CF1 or TF1 are photoinactivated with dequalinium, whereas a different site is derivatized when MF1 is inactivated with the reagent, might be related to the insensitivity of spinach CF1 and TF1 and sensitivity of MF1 to inhibition by aurovertin (48Kagawa Y. Nukiwa N. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1981; 100: 1370-1376Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). In the case of MF1, photoinactivation with dequalinium is accompanied by derivatization of Pheα403 or Pheα406, in mutually exclusive reactions, and a side chain within residues 440–459 of the β subunit. To a limited extent, α-β cross-linking accompanies photoinactivation (23Zhuo S. Paik S.R. Register J.A. Allison W.S. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 2219-2227Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). The crystal structure of MF1 liganded with 2 aurovertin molecules has been solved (49van Raaij M.J. Abrahams J.P. Leslie A.G.W. Walker J.E. Proc. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 6913-6917Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). One aurovertin molecule is bound to βTP, and the other is bound to βE. In βTP, the pyrone ring of bound inhibitor interacts with the side chain of Tyrβ458 and the methoxy oxygen attached to the pyrone is in van der Waals contact with a carboxylate oxygen of Gluα199 of αTP. At an αTP/βTP interface, Pheα403 is 16.4 Å from Tyrβ458, which is within the spanning distance of the two 4-amino-2-methylquinaldinium moieties of dequalinium. Whether or not Tyrβ458 is derivatized when MF1 is photoinactivated with dequalinium has not been established. However, an investigation is in progress to identify the residue derivatized within residues 440–459 of the β subunit when MF1 is inactivated with [14C]dequalinium."
https://openalex.org/W2057932811,"Transcription activation via activating transcription factor cyclic AMP response element binding (ATF/CREB) sites in vitro was explored using transcription and permanganate assay for open complex formation. These sites were used to drive transcription from an adenovirus major late core sequence. Under conditions where activation is strong, 20-50-fold, ATF/CREB is required for preinitiation complexes to reach the open complex stage. Complete opening requires activator, ATP, and initiating nucleotides. In exploration of postinitiation steps, no stimulation of promoter clearance was observed but a modest stimulation of the rate of continuous transcription occurred. High amounts of DNA template, commonly used in in vitro studies, allows some templates to open without activator, but leaves the nucleotide requirements intact. This leads to a drastic lowering of the dependence on ATF/CREB. Taken together, the data indicate that ATF/CREB activates this system primarily by stimulating the formation of functional preinitiation complexes."
