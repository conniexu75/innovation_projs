https://openalex.org/W3137814608,"Rye is a valuable food and forage crop, an important genetic resource for wheat and triticale improvement and an indispensable material for efficient comparative genomic studies in grasses. Here, we sequenced the genome of Weining rye, an elite Chinese rye variety. The assembled contigs (7.74 Gb) accounted for 98.47% of the estimated genome size (7.86 Gb), with 93.67% of the contigs (7.25 Gb) assigned to seven chromosomes. Repetitive elements constituted 90.31% of the assembled genome. Compared to previously sequenced Triticeae genomes, Daniela, Sumaya and Sumana retrotransposons showed strong expansion in rye. Further analyses of the Weining assembly shed new light on genome-wide gene duplications and their impact on starch biosynthesis genes, physical organization of complex prolamin loci, gene expression features underlying early heading trait and putative domestication-associated chromosomal regions and loci in rye. This genome sequence promises to accelerate genomic and breeding studies in rye and related cereal crops."
https://openalex.org/W3137944384,"Rye (Secale cereale L.) is an exceptionally climate-resilient cereal crop, used extensively to produce improved wheat varieties via introgressive hybridization and possessing the entire repertoire of genes necessary to enable hybrid breeding. Rye is allogamous and only recently domesticated, thus giving cultivated ryes access to a diverse and exploitable wild gene pool. To further enhance the agronomic potential of rye, we produced a chromosome-scale annotated assembly of the 7.9-gigabase rye genome and extensively validated its quality by using a suite of molecular genetic resources. We demonstrate applications of this resource with a broad range of investigations. We present findings on cultivated rye's incomplete genetic isolation from wild relatives, mechanisms of genome structural evolution, pathogen resistance, low-temperature tolerance, fertility control systems for hybrid breeding and the yield benefits of rye-wheat introgressions."
https://openalex.org/W3136265598,"Petrochemical-based plastics have not only contaminated all parts of the globe, but are also causing potentially irreversible damage to our ecosystem because of their non-biodegradability. As bioplastics are limited in number, there is an urgent need to design and develop more biodegradable alternatives to mitigate the plastic menace. In this regard, we report aquaplastic, a new class of microbial biofilm-based biodegradable bioplastic that is water-processable, robust, templatable and coatable. Here, Escherichia coli was genetically engineered to produce protein-based hydrogels, which are cast and dried under ambient conditions to produce aquaplastic, which can withstand strong acid/base and organic solvents. In addition, aquaplastic can be healed and welded to form three-dimensional architectures using water. The combination of straightforward microbial fabrication, water processability and biodegradability makes aquaplastic a unique material worthy of further exploration for packaging and coating applications."

Here we describe a Cas9/AAV6-mediated genome editing strategy that can replace the entire HBA1 gene with a full-length HBB transgene in β-thalassemia-derived hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs), which is sufficient to normalize β-globin:α-globin messenger RNA and protein ratios and restore functional adult hemoglobin tetramers in patient-derived red blood cells. Edited HSPCs were capable of long-term and bilineage hematopoietic reconstitution in mice, establishing proof of concept for replacement of HBA1 with HBB as a novel therapeutic strategy for curing β-thalassemia."
https://openalex.org/W3137695951,"The visual perception of freshness is an important factor considered by consumers in the purchase of fruits and vegetables. However, panel testing when evaluating food products is time consuming and expensive. Herein, the ability of an image processing-based, nondestructive technique to classify spinach freshness was evaluated. Images of spinach leaves were taken using a smartphone camera after different storage periods. Twelve sensory panels ranked spinach freshness into one of four levels using these images. The rounded value of the average from all twelve panel evaluations was set as the true label. The spinach image was removed from the background, and then converted into a gray scale and CIE-Lab color space (L*a*b*) and Hue, Saturation and Value (HSV). The mean value, minimum value, and standard deviation of each component of color in spinach leaf were extracted as color features. Local features were extracted using the bag-of-words of key points from Oriented FAST (Features from Accelerated Segment Test) and Rotated BRIEF (Binary Robust Independent Elementary Features). The feature combinations selected from the spinach images were used to train machine learning models to recognize freshness levels. Correlation analysis between the extracted features and the sensory evaluation score showed a positive correlation (0.5 &lt; r &lt; 0.6) for four color features, and a negative correlation (‒0.6 &lt; r &lt; ‒0.5) for six clusters in the local features. The support vector machine classifier and artificial neural network algorithm successfully classified spinach samples with overall accuracy 70% in four-class, 77% in three-class and 84% in two-class, which was similar to that of the individual panel evaluations. Our findings indicate that a model using support vector machine classifiers and artificial neural networks has the potential to replace freshness evaluations currently performed by non-trained panels."
https://openalex.org/W3136125550,"In situ gels have been extensively explored as ocular drug delivery system to enhance bioavailability and efficacy. The objective of present study was to design, formulate and evaluate ion-activated in situ gel to enhance the ocular penetration and therapeutic performance of moxifloxacin in ophthalmic delivery. A simplex lattice design was utilized to examine the effect of various factors on experimental outcomes of the in situ gel system. The influence of polymers (independent variables) such as gellan gum (X 1 ), sodium alginate (X 2 ), and HPMC (X 3 ) on gel strength, adhesive force, viscosity and drug release after 10 h (Q 10 ) were assessed. Selected formulation (MH7) was studied for ex vivo permeation, in vivo irritation and pharmacokinetics in rabbits. Data revealed that increase in concentration of polymers led to higher gel strength, adhesive force and viscosity, however, decreases the drug release. MH7 exhibited all physicochemical properties within acceptable limits and was stable for 6 months. Release profile of moxifloxacin from MH7 was comparable to the check point batches and followed Korsmeyer-Peppas matrix diffusion-controlled mechanism. Ocular irritation study signifies that selected formulation is safe and non-irritant for ophthalmic administration. In vivo pharmacokinetics data indicates significant improvement of moxifloxacin bioavailability ( p &lt; 0.0001) from MH7, as evidenced by higher C max (727 ± 56 ng/ml) and greater AUC (2881 ± 108 ng h/ml), when compared with commercial eye drops (C max ; 503 ± 85 ng/ml and AUC; 978 ± 86 ng h/ml). In conclusion, developed in situ gel system (MH7) could offers a more effective and extended ophthalmic therapy of moxifloxacin in ocular infections when compared to conventional eye drops."
https://openalex.org/W3138075199,"Aims Metabolic syndrome (MetS) increases the risk of diabetes mellitus (DM), cardiovascular disease (CVD), cancer, and mortality. Sarcopenia has been reported as a risk factor for MetS, non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, and CVD. To date, the association between sarcopenia and MetS has been investigated. However, there have been few studies on the dose-response relationship between sarcopenia and MetS. We investigated the association between sarcopenia and the prevalence of MetS. We also aimed to analyze the dose-response relationship between skeletal muscle mass and the prevalence of MetS. Methods We enrolled 13,620 participants from October 2014 to December 2019. Skeletal muscle mass was measured using bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA). Appendicular skeletal muscle mass (ASM) was divided by body weight (kg) and was expressed as a percentage (ASM x 100/Weight, ASM%). The quartiles of ASM% were calculated for each gender, with Q1 and Q4 being the lowest and highest quartiles of ASM%, respectively. The quartiles of ASM% were calculated for each gender, with Q1 and Q4 being the lowest and highest quartiles of ASM%, respectively. Linear regression and logistic regression analyses were used to compare the clinical parameters according to ASM%, adjusted for age, sex, obesity, hypertension (HT), DM, dyslipidemia (DL), smoking, alcohol intake, and C-reactive protein (CRP). Multiple logistic regression analysis was performed to determine the risk of MetS in each group. Results A dose-response relationship was identified between ASM% and MetS. Sarcopenia was associated with an increased prevalence of MetS. After adjustment for age, sex, obesity, HT, DM, DL, smoking, alcohol intake, and CRP, sarcopenia remained significantly associated with MetS. For each 1 quartile increment in ASM%, the risk of MetS decreased by 56% (P&lt; 0.001). After adjusting for age, sex, obesity, HT, DM, DL, smoking, alcohol intake, and CRP, the risk of MetS decreased by 25% per 1Q increment in ASM% (P &lt; 0.001). Conclusions Sarcopenia by BIA is independently associated with the risk of MetS and has a dose-response relationship."
https://openalex.org/W3138195083,"The COVID-19 pandemic has spread worldwide, with considerable public health and socio-economic impacts that are seriously affecting health and safety of workers, as well as their employment stability. Italy was the first of many other western countries to implement extended containment measures. Health workers and others employed in essential sectors have continued their activity, reporting high infection rate with many fatalities. The epidemiological trend highlighted the importance of work as a substantial factor to consider both when implementing strategies aimed at containing the pandemic and shaping the lockdown mitigation strategy required for sustained economic recovery. To support the decision-making process, we have developed a strategy to predict the risk of infection by SARS-CoV-2 in the workplace based on the analysis of the working process and proximity between employees; risk of infection connected to the type of activity; involvement of third parties in the working processes and risk of social aggregation. We applied this approach to outline a risk index for each economic activity sector, with different levels of detail, also considering the impact on mobility of the working population. This method was implemented into the national epidemiological surveillance model in order to estimate the impact of re-activation of specific activities on the reproduction number. It has also been adopted by the national scientific committee set up by the Italian Government for action-oriented policy advice on the COVID-19 emergency in the post lockdown phase. This approach may play a key role for public health if associated with measures for risk mitigation in enterprises through strategies of business process re-engineering. Furthermore, it will make a contribution to reconsidering the organization of work, including also innovation and fostering the integration with the national occupational safety and health (OSH) system."
https://openalex.org/W3138781903,"Errors in medication self-administration (MSA) lead to poor treatment adherence, increased hospitalizations and higher healthcare costs. These errors are particularly common when medication delivery involves devices such as inhalers or insulin pens. We present a contactless and unobtrusive artificial intelligence (AI) framework that can detect and monitor MSA errors by analyzing the wireless signals in the patient’s home, without the need for physical contact. The system was developed by observing self-administration conducted by volunteers and evaluated by comparing its prediction with human annotations. Findings from this study demonstrate that our approach can automatically detect when patients use their inhalers (area under the curve (AUC) = 0.992) or insulin pens (AUC = 0.967), and assess whether patients follow the appropriate steps for using these devices (AUC = 0.952). The work shows the potential of leveraging AI-based solutions to improve medication safety with minimal overhead for patients and health professionals. Artificial intelligence coupled with wireless home sensors can monitor the use of insulin pens and inhalers by patients and alert of errors in self-medication in an unobtrusive manner."
https://openalex.org/W3122836811,"Many observational studies and some randomized trials demonstrate how fetal growth can be influenced by environmental insults (for example, maternal infections)1 and preventive interventions (for example, multiple-micronutrient supplementation)2 that can have a long-lasting effect on health, growth, neurodevelopment and even educational attainment and income in adulthood3. In a cohort of pregnant women (n = 3,598), followed-up between 2012 and 2019 at six sites worldwide4, we studied the associations between ultrasound-derived fetal cranial growth trajectories, measured longitudinally from <14 weeks' gestation, against international standards5,6, and growth and neurodevelopment up to 2 years of age7,8. We identified five trajectories associated with specific neurodevelopmental, behavioral, visual and growth outcomes, independent of fetal abdominal growth, postnatal morbidity and anthropometric measures at birth and age 2. The trajectories, which changed within a 20-25-week gestational age window, were associated with brain development at 2 years of age according to a mirror (positive/negative) pattern, mostly focused on maturation of cognitive, language and visual skills. Further research should explore the potential for preventive interventions in pregnancy to improve infant neurodevelopmental outcomes before the critical window of opportunity that precedes the divergence of growth at 20-25 weeks' gestation."
https://openalex.org/W3137750772,"Introduction In the pursuit of achieving the Sustainable Development Goal targets of universal health coverage and reducing maternal mortality, many countries in sub-Saharan Africa have implemented health insurance policies over the last two decades. Given that there is a paucity of empirical literature at the sub-regional level, we examined the prevalence and factors associated with health insurance coverage among women in in sub-Saharan Africa. Materials and methods We analysed cross-sectional data of 307,611 reproductive-aged women from the most recent demographic and health surveys of 24 sub-Saharan African countries. Bivariable and multivariable analyses were performed using chi-square test of independence and multi-level logistic regression respectively. Results are presented as adjusted Odds Ratios (aOR) for the multilevel logistic regression analysis. Statistical significance was set at p&lt;0.05. Results The overall coverage of health insurance was 8.5%, with cross-country variations. The lowest coverage was recorded in Chad (0.9%) and the highest in Ghana (62.4%). Individual-level factors significantly associated with health insurance coverage included age, place of residence, level of formal education, frequency of reading newspaper/magazine and watching television. Wealth status and place of residence were the contextual factors significantly associated with health insurance coverage. Women with no formal education were 78% less likely to be covered by health insurance (aOR = 0.22, 95% CI = 0.21–0.24), compared with those who had higher education. Urban women, however, had higher odds of being covered by health insurance, compared with those in the rural areas [aOR = 1.20, 95%CI = 1.15–1.25]. Conclusion We found an overall relatively low prevalence of health insurance coverage among women of reproductive age in sub-Saharan Africa. As sub-Saharan African countries work toward achieving the Sustainable Development Goal targets of universal health coverage and lowering maternal mortality to less than 70 deaths per 100,000 live births, it is important that countries with low coverage of health insurance among women of reproductive age integrate measures such as free maternal healthcare into their respective development plans. Interventions aimed at expanding health insurance coverage should be directed at younger women of reproductive age, rural women, and women who do not read newspapers/magazines or watch television."
https://openalex.org/W3138483255,"Cannabinoids reduce tremor associated with motor disorders induced by injuries and neurodegenerative disease. Here we show that this effect is mediated by cannabinoid receptors on astrocytes in the ventral horn of the spinal cord, where alternating limb movements are initiated. We first demonstrate that tremor is reduced in a mouse model of essential tremor after intrathecal injection of the cannabinoid analog WIN55,212-2. We investigate the underlying mechanism using electrophysiological recordings in spinal cord slices and show that endocannabinoids released from depolarized interneurons activate astrocytic cannabinoid receptors, causing an increase in intracellular Ca2+, subsequent release of purines and inhibition of excitatory neurotransmission. Finally, we show that the anti-tremor action of WIN55,212-2 in the spinal cords of mice is suppressed after knocking out CB1 receptors in astrocytes. Our data suggest that cannabinoids reduce tremor via their action on spinal astrocytes. Astrocytes regulate synaptic transmission. Carlsen et al. report that spinal astrocytes activated by endocannabinoids inhibit excitatory synaptic transmission and, thereby, decrease tremor."
https://openalex.org/W3138984074,"Ecological profiling of non-native species is essential to predict their dispersal and invasiveness potential across different areas of the world. Cassiopea is a monophyletic taxonomic group of scyphozoan mixotrophic jellyfish including C . andromeda , a recent colonizer of sheltered, shallow-water habitats of the Mediterranean Sea, such as harbors and other light-limited, eutrophic coastal habitats. To assess the ecophysiological plasticity of Cassiopea jellyfish and their potential to spread across the Mare Nostrum by secondary introductions, we investigated rapid photosynthetic responses of jellyfish to irradiance transitions—from reduced to increased irradiance conditions (as paradigm of transition from harbors to coastal, meso/oligotrophic habitats). Laboratory incubation experiments were carried out to compare oxygen fluxes and photobiological variables in Cassiopea sp. immature specimens pre-acclimated to low irradiance (PAR = 200 μmol photons m − 2 s − 1 ) and specimens rapidly exposed to higher irradiance levels (PAR = 500 μmol photons m − 2 s − 1 ). Comparable photosynthetic potential and high photosynthetic rates were measured at both irradiance values, as also shown by the rapid light curves. No significant differences were observed in terms of symbiont abundance between control and treated specimens. However, jellyfish kept at the low irradiance showed a higher content in chlorophyll a and c (0.76±0.51SD vs 0.46±0.13SD mg g -1 AFDW) and a higher Ci (amount of chlorophyll per cell) compared to jellyfish exposed to higher irradiance levels. The ratio between gross photosynthesis and respiration (P:R) was &gt;1, indicating a significant input from the autotrophic metabolism. Cassiopea sp. specimens showed high photosynthetic performances, at both low and high irradiance, demonstrating high potential to adapt to sudden changes in light exposure. Such photosynthetic plasticity, combined with Cassiopea eurythermal tolerance and mixotrophic behavior, jointly suggest the upside-down jellyfish as a potentially successful invader in the scenario of a warming Mediterranean Sea."
https://openalex.org/W3136040290,"Building on the epidemiological SIR model, we present an economic model with heterogeneous individuals deriving utility from social contacts creating infection risks. Focusing on social distancing of individuals susceptible to an infection we theoretically characterize the gap between private and social cost of contacts. Our main contribution is to quantify this gap by calibrating the model with unique survey data from Germany on social distancing and impure altruism from the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic. The optimal policy is to drastically reduce contacts at the beginning to almost eradicate the epidemic and keep them at levels that contain the pandemic at a low prevalence level. We find that also in laissez faire, private protection efforts by forward-looking, risk averse individuals would have stabilized the epidemic, but at a much higher prevalence of infection than optimal. Altruistic motives increase individual protection efforts, but a substantial gap to the social optimum remains."
https://openalex.org/W3136817442,"Background Applying evidence-based practice during care provision is essential because it improves the quality of care, reduces health care costs, and increases patient and family satisfaction. However, information on evidence-based nursing practice and associated factors were not well studied and documented in the study area. Hence, this study aimed to assess utilization and associated factors of evidence-based practice among nurses working in Amhara Region Referral Hospitals, Ethiopia. Methods An institution-based cross-sectional study was conducted from March 18 to April 16, 2019, in Amhara Region Referral Hospitals. A simple random sampling technique was used to select 684 respondents. Data were collected using a pretested and self-administered questionnaire. Data were entered into Epi Info version 7.1.2.0 and exported to SPSS version 22.0 for analysis. The bivariable analysis was used primarily and variables with p-value &lt; 0.2 were further examined using a multivariable logistic regression model to control con-founders. Then, variables’ p-value &lt; 0.05 with 95% CI was used to determine associated factors. Results From 684 proposed nurses, 671 of them completed the questionnaire giving 98.1% response rate. Of these, 55% (95% CI: 51.2, 58.9) of them had good evidence-based practice utilization. Variables including single (AOR = 1.662: 95% CI: 1.089–2.536), fewer work experience (AOR = 1.849: 95% CI: 1.049–3.257), good knowledge (AOR = 2.044: 95% CI: 1.406–2.972), effective communication skill (AOR = 2.537: 95% CI: 1.744–3.689), EBP training (AOR = 3.224 95% CI: 1.957–5.311), internet access (AOR = 1.655: 95% CI: 1.119–2.448) and evidence-based guideline availability (AOR = 1.827: 95% CI: 1.249–2.673) were found to be predictors of evidence-based practice utilization. Conclusions The study revealed that evidence-based practice utilization among nurses is low. Availing evidence-based guidelines in the work area, improving facilities’ internet access, and building nurses’ evidence-based practice competencies through either by giving separate training or incorporating as part of the curriculum would improve its utilization."
https://openalex.org/W3138790345,"How acute hyperglycaemia affects memory functions and functional brain responses in individuals with and without type 2 diabetes is unclear. Our aim was to study the association between acute hyperglycaemia and working, semantic, and episodic memory in participants with type 2 diabetes compared to a sex- and age-matched control group. We also assessed the effect of hyperglycaemia on working memory–related brain activity. A total of 36 participants with type 2 diabetes and 34 controls (mean age, 66 years) underwent hyperglycaemic clamp or placebo clamp in a blinded and randomised order. Working, episodic, and semantic memory were tested. Overall, the control group had higher working memory (mean z-score 33.15 ± 0.45) than the group with type 2 diabetes (mean z-score 31.8 ± 0.44, p = 0.042) considering both the placebo and hyperglycaemic clamps. Acute hyperglycaemia did not influence episodic, semantic, or working memory performance in either group. Twenty-two of the participants (10 cases, 12 controls, mean age 69 years) were randomly invited to undergo the same clamp procedures to challenge working memory, using 1-, 2-, and 3-back, while monitoring brain activity by blood oxygen level–dependent functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). The participants with type 2 diabetes had reduced working memory during the 1- and 2-back tests. fMRI during placebo clamp revealed increased BOLD signal in the left lateral frontal cortex and the anterior cingulate cortex as a function of working memory load in both groups (3&gt;2&gt;1). During hyperglycaemia, controls showed a similar load-dependent fMRI response, whereas the type 2 diabetes group showed decreased BOLD response from 2- to 3-back. These results suggest that impaired glucose metabolism in the brain affects working memory, possibly by reducing activity in important frontal brain areas in persons with type 2 diabetes."
https://openalex.org/W3112567963,"Purpose Assessment and a direct comparison of retinal vessel density with the thickness of inner retinal layer (IRL) and outer retinal layer (ORL) in the same regions of the macula in subjects with Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and primary open-angle glaucoma (POAG). Methods We analyzed data from 48 eyes of healthy control (HC) participants, 71 eyes with POAG, and 49 eyes of AD patients. Ophthalmic examination included optical coherence tomography (OCT) imaging to measure IRL and ORL thickness and OCT angiography (OCTA) in the same region for the imaging of vessel density in the superficial vascular plexus (SVP) and deep vascular plexus (DVP) of the retina. A direct comparison of vessel density and retinal layers thickness, which different dynamic ranges, was obtained by normalizing values as percentage losses. Results Patients with AD presented significantly greater losses of vascular density in the DVP and ORL thickness compared to POAG (p &lt;0.001), but percentage losses of vessel density in SVP and IRL thickness were considerable in POAG compared to AD eyes (p&lt;0.001). Positive associations among presence of AD were observed primarily in outer retina where a 1% decrease of ORL thickness was associated with about 24–29% increase in odds of the presence of AD. According to OCTA measurements, a 1% decrease of vessel density in DVP was positively associated with a 4–9% increase in odds of the presence of AD. In POAG positive associations among presence of disease were observed only in inner retina where 1% loss of IRL thickness and a 1% loss of vessel density in the SVP were positively associated with a 13–23% increase in risk of presence of the disease. Conclusions Analysis of ORL thickness and vessel density in DVP could potentially improve diagnostic capabilities and may provide a valuable approach for predicting of AD."
https://openalex.org/W3136772550,"A wide range of analytical methods applied to urban systems address the modeling of pedestrian behavior. These include methods for multimodal trip service areas, access to businesses and public services, diverse metrics of “walkability”, and the interpretation of location data. Infrastructure performance metrics in particular are an increasingly important means by which to understand and provide services to an urbanizing population. In contrast to traditional one-size-fits all analyses of street networks, as more detailed pedestrian-specific transportation network data becomes available, the opportunity arises to model the pedestrian network in terms of individual experiences. Here, we present a formalized and city-scale framework, personalized pedestrian network analysis (PPNA), for embedding and retrieving pedestrian experiences. PPNA enables evaluation of new, detailed, and open pedestrian transportation network data using a quantitative parameterization of a pedestrian’s preferences and requirements, producing one or more weighted network(s) that provide a basis for posing varied urban pedestrian experience research questions, with four approaches provided as examples. We introduce normalized sidewalk reach (NSR), a walkshed-based metric of individual pedestrian access to the sidewalk network, and sidewalk reach quotient (SRQ), an estimate of inequity based on comparing the normalized sidewalk reach values for different pedestrian profiles at the same location. Next, we investigate a higher-order and combinatorial research question that enumerates pedestrian network-based amenity access between pedestrians. Finally, we present city-scale betweenness centrality calculations between unique pedestrian experiences, highlighting disagreement between pedestrians on the “importance” of various pedestrian network corridors. Taken together, this framework and examples represent a significant emerging opportunity to promote the embedding of more explicit and inclusive hypotheses of pedestrian experience into research on urban pedestrian accessibility, multimodal transportation modeling, urban network analysis, and a broader range of research questions."
https://openalex.org/W3138269145,"Avascular necrosis of bone (AVN) is increasingly being recognized as a complication of SLE and causes significant disability due to pain and mobility limitations. We studied the prevalence and factors associated with avascular necrosis (AVN) in a multiethnic SLE cohort. SLE patients who visited the outpatient clinic from October 2017 to April 2019 were considered eligible. Their medical records were reviewed to identify patients who developed symptomatic AVN, as confirmed by either magnetic resonance imaging or plain radiography. Subsequently, their SLE disease characteristics and treatment were compared with the characteristics of patients who did not have AVN. Multivariable logistic regression analyses were performed to determine the independent factors associated with AVN among the multiethnic SLE cohort. A total of 390 patients were recruited, and the majority of them were females (92.6%); the patients were predominantly of Malay ethnicity (59.5%), followed by Chinese (35.9%) and Indian (4.6%). The prevalence of symptomatic AVN was 14.1%, and the mean age of AVN diagnosis was 37.6 ± 14.4 years. Both univariate and multivariable logistic regression analyses revealed that a longer disease duration, high LDL-C (low density lipoprotein cholesterol), positive anti-cardiolipin (aCL) IgG and anti-dsDNA results, a history of an oral prednisolone dose of more than 30 mg daily for at least 4 weeks and osteoporotic fractures were significantly associated with AVN. On the other hand, hydroxychloroquin (HCQ), mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) and bisphosphonate use were associated with a lower risk of AVN. No associations with ethnicity were found. In conclusion, several modifiable risk factors were found to be associated with AVN, and these factors may be used to identify patients who are at high risk of developing such complications. The potential protective effects of HCQ, MMF and bisphosphonates warrant additional studies."
https://openalex.org/W3135978588,"Background Identifying factors that can predict severe disease in patients needing hospitalization for COVID-19 is crucial for early recognition of patients at greatest risk. Objective (1) Identify factors predicting intensive care unit (ICU) transfer and (2) develop a simple calculator for clinicians managing patients hospitalized with COVID-19. Methods A total of 2,685 patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 admitted to a large metropolitan health system in Georgia, USA between March and July 2020 were included in the study. Seventy-five percent of patients were included in the training dataset (admitted March 1 to July 10). Through multivariable logistic regression, we developed a prediction model (probability score) for ICU transfer. Then, we validated the model by estimating its performance accuracy (area under the curve [AUC]) using data from the remaining 25% of patients (admitted July 11 to July 31). Results We included 2,014 and 671 patients in the training and validation datasets, respectively. Diabetes mellitus, coronary artery disease, chronic kidney disease, serum C-reactive protein, and serum lactate dehydrogenase were identified as significant risk factors for ICU transfer, and a prediction model was developed. The AUC was 0.752 for the training dataset and 0.769 for the validation dataset. We developed a free, web-based calculator to facilitate use of the prediction model ( https://icucovid19.shinyapps.io/ICUCOVID19/ ). Conclusion Our validated, simple, and accessible prediction model and web-based calculator for ICU transfer may be useful in assisting healthcare providers in identifying hospitalized patients with COVID-19 who are at high risk for clinical deterioration. Triage of such patients for early aggressive treatment can impact clinical outcomes for this potentially deadly disease."
https://openalex.org/W3136772657,"Background While whole genome sequencing (WGS) may be more expensive than traditional testing and polymerase chain reaction (PCR), simple cost comparisons ignore the potential for WGS to reduce the societal costs of non-typhoidal Salmonella enterica through public health action to prevent illness. Methods We determined how many cases the use of WGS data would need to prevent to be cost-equal to serotyping and MLVA, or culture independent testing based on PCR in Australia. We then examined the costs and cost-savings of current typing methods compared with WGS in outbreak scenarios. Results A median of 275 (90% CrI -55-775) or 1.9% (90% CrI -0.4%-5.4%) of notified serotyped Salmonella cases would need to be prevented for WGS to be cost-equal to current typing methods and 1,550 (90% CrI 820–2,725) or 9.6% of all notified Salmonella cases would need to be prevented to be cost-equal to PCR. WGS is likely to result in cost savings in prolonged outbreaks, where data can support earlier public health action. Conclusions Despite currently having a higher cost per isolate, routine WGS of Salmonella was no more expensive than existing typing methods or PCR where &gt;2% of illness was averted."
https://openalex.org/W3138088578,"Background Humane education, which focuses on the cultivation of kindness and empathy towards animals, the environment, and fellow humans, helps children to be less egocentric and more sensitive to the human–animal interaction in ecology. Aim This study aimed to evaluate an animal-assisted, school-based humane education programme that promotes a humane attitude and enhances social–emotional competence for children in Hong Kong. Method A sequential mixed-methods formative evaluation was adopted in the pilot year of the programme. A controlled trial and focus groups were conducted to evaluate the preliminary outcomes and process of the programme and to identify the implementation obstacles and effective strategies. One hundred and ten primary three students from two primary schools participated in the study (55 in the intervention group and 55 in the control group with ordinary formal school extra-curricular activities). Paired sample t tests and a mixed ANOVA were conducted to explore the changes in students’ social–emotional competence in our programme and two typical extra-curricular school programmes. Thematic analysis was conducted to categorise the transcriptions from the focus groups. Results Quantitative findings indicated that class-based, animal-assisted humane education increased cognitive competence (t[24] = 2.42, p = .02), empathy (t[24] = 2.94, p &lt; .01), and reduced hyperactivity (t[23] = -2.40, p = .02). Further analysis indicated that the participant recruitment strategies moderate the impact of interventions on the development of empathy (F[2,104] = 4.11, p = .02) and cognitive competence (F[2,104] = 2.96, p = .05). Qualitative analysis suggested three major themes: enhancement of self-control, promotion of humane attitude, and improvement of reading skills. Conclusion The preliminary results of this pilot study indicate positive effects of the programme. Vigorous systematic formative evaluation on the process and effective implementation should be included in future follow-up studies to ensure its sustainability and fidelity."
https://openalex.org/W3139312646,"Background Disclosure of Human Immune Virus (HIV) serostatus by pregnant and lactating women is crucial for the successful prevention of mother to child transmission of HIV/AIDS. However, little has been studied regarding the prevalence and factors associated with HIV status disclosure among HIV positive pregnant and lactating women in Ethiopia. Methods An institution-based cross-sectional study was conducted in the Nekemte Public Health facilities among 380 pregnant and lactating women enrolled in universal antiretroviral therapy (ART) treatment from January 2015-December, 2019. The data were collected by using a checklist, developed from Prevention of Mother to Child Transmission (PMTCT) logbook, ART intake forms, and medical cards of the patients. Epidata version 3.2 was used for data entry, and then the data were exported to STATA version 14 for further analysis. The binary logistic regression model was employed to determine factors associated with the disclosure status among HIV positive pregnant and lactating women. Adjusted Odds Ratio (AOR) with 95% confidence intervals was computed and statistical significance was declared when it is significant at a 5% level (p-value &lt; 0.05). Results A total of 380 women have participated in the study. Two hundred seventy-six (73.4%) of women had disclosed their HIV status to at least one individual. The study found living in urban (OR = 1.83, 95% CI: 1.04, 3.20), married women (OR = 4.16, 95% CI: 1.87, 9.24), higher educational status (OR = 2.35, 95% CI: 1.31, 5.51), positive HIV status of partner (OR = 2.35, 95%CI: 1.17, 4.70), and being multipara (OR = 4.94, 95% CI: 2.29, 10.66) were independent determinants of HIV status disclosure. Conclusions HIV status disclosure among pregnant and lactating women in the study area was sub-optimal. Empowering women through education, encouraging partners for HIV testing, and enhancing active male involvement in HIV treatment and control programs should get due attention."
https://openalex.org/W3139335072,"Garlic is a well-known example of natural self-defence system consisting of an inactive substrate (alliin) and enzyme (alliinase) which, when combined, produce highly antimicrobial allicin. Increase of alliinase stability and its activity are of paramount importance in various applications relying on its use for in-situ synthesis of allicin or its analogues, e.g., pulmonary drug delivery, treatment of superficial injuries, or urease inhibitors in fertilizers. Here, we discuss the effect of temperature, pH, buffers, salts, and additives, i.e. antioxidants, chelating agents, reducing agents and cosolvents, on the stability and the activity of alliinase extracted from garlic. The effects of the storage temperature and relative humidity on the stability of lyophilized alliinase was demonstrated. A combination of the short half-life, high reactivity and non-specificity to particular proteins are reasons most bacteria cannot deal with allicin’s mode of action and develop effective defence mechanism, which could be the key to sustainable drug design addressing serious problems with escalating emergence of multidrug-resistant (MDR) bacterial strains."
https://openalex.org/W3136854085,"Microinsurance is promoted as a valuable instrument for low-income households to buffer financial losses due to health or climate-related risks. However, apart from direct positive effects, such formal insurance schemes can have unintended side effects when insured households lower their contribution to traditional informal arrangements where risk is shared through private monetary support. Using a stylized agent-based model, we assess impacts of microinsurance on the resilience of those smallholders in a social network who cannot afford this financial instrument. We explicitly include the decision behavior regarding informal transfers. We find that the introduction of formal insurance can have negative side effects even if insured households are willing to contribute to informal risk arrangements. However, when many households are simultaneously affected by a shock, e.g. by droughts or floods, formal insurance is a valuable addition to informal risk-sharing. By explicitly taking into account long-term effects of short-term transfer decisions, our study allows to complement existing empirical research. The model results underline that new insurance programs have to be developed in close alignment with established risk-coping instruments. Only then can they be effective without weakening functioning aspects of informal risk management, which could lead to increased poverty."
https://openalex.org/W3138374432,"Background The World Health Organization recommends that treatment of depression in low and middle-income countries with a scarcity of psychiatrists could be done in primary care and should include prescription of antidepressant medications for moderate and severe depression. Little is known, however, about the actual practices of antidepressant prescription by primary care physicians in low and middle-income countries, nor about adherence by people receiving such prescriptions. In a large study of primary care clinics in Goa, India, we examined the relationship of actual to recommended prescribing practices for depression, among all patients who screened positive for common mental disorder. We also examined other patient and clinic characteristics associated with antidepressant prescription, and self-reported adherence over a one-month period. Methods Patients attending 24 primary care clinics were screened for common mental disorders. Those who screened positive were eligible to enroll in a trial to assess the effectiveness of a collaborative stepped care (CSC) intervention for mental disorders. Physicians in the 12 intervention and 12 control clinics (usual care) were free to prescribe antidepressants and follow-up interviews were conducted at 2, 6 and 12 months. Screening results were shared with the physician, but they were blinded to the diagnosis generated later using a standardized diagnostic interview administered by a health counsellor. We categorized these later diagnoses as “moderate/severe depression”, “mild depression or non-depression diagnosis”, and “no diagnosis”. We used a two-level hierarchical logistic regression model to examine diagnostic and other factors associated with antidepressant prescription and one-month adherence. Results Overall, about 47% of screened positive patients (n = 1320) received an antidepressant prescription: 60% of those with moderate/severe depression, 48% of those with mild depression or non-depression diagnosis, and 31% with no diagnosis. Women (OR 1.29; 95%CI 1.04–1.60) and older adults (OR 1.80; 95%CI 1.32–2.47) were more likely to receive an antidepressant prescription. While the overall rate of antidepressant prescription was similar in clinics with and without CSC, patients without any diagnosis were more likely to receive a prescription (OR 2.20 95% CI 1.03–4.70) in the usual care clinics. About 47% of patients adhered to antidepressant treatment for one month or more and adherence was significantly better among older adults (OR 3.92; 95% CI 1.70–8.93) and those who received antidepressant as part of the CSC treatment model (OR 6.10 95% CI 3.67–10.14) compared with those attending the usual care clinic. Conclusion Antidepressants were widely prescribed following screening in primary care, but prescription patterns were in poor accord with WHO recommendations. The data suggest under-prescription for people with moderate/severe depression; over-prescription for people with mild depression or non-depression diagnoses; and over-prescription for people with no disorders. For all diagnoses adherence was low, especially in usual care clinics. To address these concerns, there is an urgent need to study and develop strategies in primary care practices to limit unnecessary antidepressant prescriptions, target prescription for those patients who clearly benefit, and to improve adherence to antidepressant treatment.

https://openalex.org/W3137032558,"During the last months of the coronavirus pandemic, with all those public restrictions and health interventions, the transmission of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) appears now to have been raised in some countries around the world. Iran was one of those first countries facing the second wave of coronavirus, due to the lack of appropriate public restrictions because of economic problems the country is facing. The clinical and demographic characteristics of severe cases and non-severe cases of Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19) in 192 patients in Tehran, Iran, between June 16 and July 11, 2020, were investigated. The patients were divided into severe cases (n = 82) and non-severe cases (n = 110). Demographic and clinical characteristics were compared between the two study clusters. The mean age was 54.6 ± 17.2 years, and the most common presenting symptom was persistent cough (81.8%) and fever (79.7%). The logistic regression model revealed that age, BMI, and affected family members were statistically associated with severity. Patients with complicated conditions of disorders faced more hospitalization days and medical care than the average statistical data. As the coronavirus spike in the case and death reports from June 2020, we observed the rise in the incidence of severe cases, where 42.7% (82/192) of cases have resulted in severe conditions. Our findings also suggested that the effect of IFB (Betamethasone) was more valid than the other alternative drugs such as LPV/r and IVIg."
https://openalex.org/W3137228526,"Abnormally pronounced digital impressions (APDIs) on the endocranial surface develop secondary to a prolonged rise in the intracranial pressure. This can result from a number of pathological conditions, including hydrocephalus due to tuberculous meningitis (TBM). APDIs have been described with relation to TBM not only in the modern medical literature but also in several paleopathological studies. However, APDIs are not pathognomonic for TBM and their diagnostic value for identifying TBM in past human populations has not been evaluated in identified pre-antibiotic era skeletons. To assess the diagnostic value of APDIs for the first time, a macroscopic investigation was performed on skeletons from the Terry Collection (Smithsonian Institution, Washington, DC, USA). Our material consisted of 234 skeletons with tuberculosis (TB) as the cause of death (TB group) and 193 skeletons with non-tuberculous (NTB) causes of death (NTB group). The macroscopic examination focused on the stage of the prominence and frequency of APDIs in the TB group and NTB group. To determine the significance of difference (if any) in the frequency of APDIs between the two groups, χ 2 testing of our data was conducted. We found that APDIs were twice as common in the TB group than in the NTB group. The χ 2 comparison of the frequencies of APDIs revealed a statistically significant difference between the two groups. In addition, APDIs with more pronounced stages were recorded more frequently in the TB group. Our results indicate that APDIs can be considered as diagnostic criteria for TBM in the paleopathological practice. With suitable circumspection, their utilization provides paleopathologists with a stronger basis for identifying TB and consequently, with a more sensitive means of assessing TB frequency in past human populations."
https://openalex.org/W3137740029,"The purpose is to study the performance compensation of the bid purchased during the mergers and acquisitions (M&amp;A) process. An intelligent model of enterprise performance appraisal is built to analyze the performances of the acquired enterprises. First, the evaluation indicators of enterprise performance are selected from both financial and non-financial aspects. An enterprise performance appraisal model is established based on the neural networks and optimized by the factor analysis method and Genetic Algorithm (GA). The principal factors affecting enterprise performance are analyzed. Then the M&amp;A parties’ performances during the M&amp;A commitment period under the earnings compensation mechanism are analyzed quantitatively. Corresponding hypotheses and evaluation indicators are established. Mean test results and regression analyses demonstrate that the hypotheses proposed are valid under particular circumstances. Introducing the earnings compensation mechanism during the M&amp;A process can improve the enterprise performance effectively so that the earnings forecasted in the commitment period are significantly higher than the historical profitability. Hence, the earnings compensation mechanism plays a positive role in guiding enterprise performance. Comparison with models proposed in previous research reveals that the output error ratio of the designed corporate performance evaluation model is 1.16%, which can effectively evaluate corporate performance. The above results provide a reference for studying the impact of the earnings compensation mechanism on enterprise performance during the M&amp;A process."
https://openalex.org/W3136509390,"Youth mental health problems is the leading cause of disability worldwide and a major public health concern. Prevalence rates are needed for planning preventive interventions and health care services. We here report Norwegian prevalence estimates for youth mental disorders based on findings from the Bergen Child Study cohort. A web-based psychiatric interview; the Development and Well-Being Assessment, was completed by parents and teachers of 2,043 10-14-year-olds from the city of Bergen, Norway. Post-stratification weights were used to account for selective participation related to parental educational in the estimation of prevalence rates. Prevalence rates are presented for the whole sample and stratified by gender and age. The overall population weighted estimate suggests that 6.93% (95% CI 5.06–9.41) of the children met DSM-IV diagnostic criteria for one or more psychiatric disorders. There were no robust indications of age- or gender-related differences in the prevalence. 11.4% of the children fulfilled criteria for more than one diagnosis. The most common comorbid conditions were ADHD and disruptive disorders. The prevalence of psychiatric disorders was relatively low among Norwegian 10-14-year-olds, compared to published worldwide prevalence estimates. This is in line with estimates from prior studies from the Nordic countries. These findings raise important questions about the origins of different prevalence rates for psychiatric disorders between societies. The findings also illustrate the importance of locally driven epidemiological studies for planning preventative efforts and appropriately scaling mental health services to meet the need of the population."
https://openalex.org/W3137029951,"Host-associated microbiomes can play important roles in the ecology and evolution of their insect hosts, but bacterial diversity in many insect groups remains poorly understood. Here we examine the relationship between host environment, host traits, and microbial diversity in three species in the ground beetle family (Coleoptera: Carabidae), a group of roughly 40,000 species that synthesize a wide diversity of defensive compounds. This study used 16S amplicon sequencing to profile three species that are phylogenetically distantly related, trophically distinct, and whose defensive chemical secretions differ: Anisodactylus similis LeConte, 1851, Pterostichus serripes (LeConte, 1875), and Brachinus elongatulus Chaudoir, 1876. Wild-caught beetles were compared to individuals maintained in the lab for two weeks on carnivorous, herbivorous, or starvation diets (n = 3 beetles for each species-diet combination). Metagenomic samples from two highly active tissue types—guts, and pygidial gland secretory cells (which produce defensive compounds)—were processed and sequenced separately from those of the remaining body. Bacterial composition and diversity of these ground beetles were largely resilient to controlled changes to host diet. Different tissues within the same beetle harbor unique microbial communities, and secretory cells in particular were remarkably similar across species. We also found that these three carabid species have patterns of microbial diversity similar to those previously found in carabid beetles. These results provide a baseline for future studies of the role of microbes in the diversification of carabids."

We assessed HIV prevention knowledge, attitudes and beliefs from adults who self-identified as a primary support person to an AYA. Methods We surveyed AYA primary support persons at an academic hospital. Univariate and multivariate regression analyses were completed to identify factors associated with the belief AYAs engaging in HIV-associated behaviors should use PrEP and willingness to support AYAs on PrEP. Results 200 primary support persons completed the survey. Participants were predominately female (77%) and black (56%). Nearly all primary support persons believed AYAs engaging in HIV-associated behaviors should take PrEP (94%) and 98% would support an AYA taking PrEP via transportation to appointments, assistance with refilling prescriptions, medication reminders, or encouragement. Conclusions Primary support persons are willing to support AYAs using PrEP."

Moreover, to explore the impact of spectacles, contact lenses and visual acuity on the compliance to the facemask directive. Methods This is a prospective study that was conducted at the Department of Ophthalmology, University Hospital of Alexandroupolis, Greece between June 2020 and August 2020. Greek speaking citizens with permanent residency in Greece above 18 years old were included. A custom questionnaire (DeMask-20) was constructed and validated, which pertained to the perceived difficulty and discomfort when using a facemask. It contained 20 items grouped in 8 subscales (driving, near vision, distance vision, ocular discomfort, role limitation, collaboration, dependency on others, emotional stress). Perceived difficulty and discomfort when using a facemask, compliance and correlations of compliance with DeMask-20 scores, demographics, spectacle and/or contact lens use, and visual acuity were evaluated. Results The number of factors was determined through factor analysis. Cronbach’s alpha ranged from 0.716 for the “Role limitation” subscale to 0.938 for “Ocular discomfort” subscale. 1,214 participants (402 men, 812 women, mean age 36.79±12.50 years) completed the DeMask-20 instrument. Mean DeMask-20 score of all study participants was 3.79±0.71. Significant differences in DeMask-20 score were detected in gender (p = 0.009), spectacle use (p = 0.034), contact lens use (p = 0.049), and binocular distance visual acuity (bDVA) (p = 0.001). Mean compliance of all participants was 4.05±0.96. Men, people &lt;50 years and spectacle wearers showed significantly worse compliance (p&lt;0.05). Moreover, professional workers and professional drivers demonstrated significantly better compliance (p = 0.008 and p = 0.047). Significant correlation was detected between compliance and DeMask-20 score (p&lt;0.001, R 2 = 0.471). Significant correlations were detected with driving, near vision, distance vision, collaboration, role limitation, emotional stress (p&lt;0.05, R 2 : 0.386–0.493). Conclusions Factor analysis suggested that the DeMask-20 instrument demonstrates adequate validity, while Cronbach’s alpha indicated sufficient internal consistency of all subscales. This study provided the necessary methods that could evaluate compliance trends and the efficacy of healthcare interventions against COVID-19. Our outcomes suggest that young males who use spectacles should be targeted by Greek Healthcare authorities in order to improve compliance rates."
https://openalex.org/W3138653067,"Spare-part management has a significant effect on the productivity of mining equipment. The required number of spare parts can be estimated using failure and repair data collected under the name of reliability data. In the mining industry, failure and repair times are decided by the operational environment, rock properties, and the technical and functional behavior of the system. These conditions are heterogeneous and may change significantly from time to time. Such heterogeneity can change equipment’s reliability performance and, consequently, the required number of spare parts. Hence, it is necessary for effective spare-part planning to check the heterogeneity among the reliability data. After that, if needed, such heterogeneity should be modeled using an adequate statistical model. Heterogeneity can be categorized into observed and unobserved caused by risk factors. Most spare-part estimation studies ignore the effect of heterogeneity, which can lead to unrealistic estimations. In this study, we introduce the application of a frailty model for modeling the effect of observed and unobserved risk factors on the required number of spare parts for mining equipment. Studies indicate that ignoring the effect of unobservable risk factors can cause a significant bias in estimation."

The objective of this study was to translate the W-DEQ-A into Spanish and analyse its reliability and validity. The study was carried out in two phases: (1) adapting the questionnaire to Spanish and (2) a transversal study in a sample of 273 pregnant women in the Sexual and Reproductive Health centres in the Metropolitan Northern Barcelona in Catalonia (Spain). The psychometric properties were analysed in terms of reliability and construct validity. The confirmatory factorial analysis did not confirm the unidimensionality of the original structure of the WDEQ-A, as happened with the other studies in which it has previously been validated. The result of the exploratory factorial analysis suggests four factors, or dimensions, very similar but not identical to those obtained in other analysis studies of the W-DEQ-A. The Cronbach alpha and the omega scale were also adequate for all the scales and for each of the dimensions. The results of this study confirm the findings of other studies that suggest that the W-DEQ-A is multi-dimensional. In the Spanish version of the W-DEQ-A four dimensions have been identified to explore fear of childbirth in pregnant women. The Spanish version of the WDEQ-A (WDEQ-A-Sp) is reliable and valid for the measurement of fear of childbirth in clinical practice and for use in future research."
https://openalex.org/W3139269399,"Peripheral neuropathy (PN) is a dose-limiting, painful adverse reaction associated with the use of paclitaxel. This common side effect was often partially attributed to the solvent used for solubilization of the highly hydrophobic drug substance. Therefore, the development of alternative formulations thrived, which included that of Abraxane ® containing nanoparticle albumin-bound paclitaxel ( nab -paclitaxel). However, studies demonstrated inconsistent conclusions regarding the mitigation of PN in comparison with the traditional formulation. The mass spectrometry-based cell metabolomics approach was used in the present study to explore the potentially associated mechanisms. Although no significant difference in the effects on cell viability was observed, fold changes in carnitine, several acylcarnitines and long-chain fatty acid(s) were significantly different between treatment groups in differentiated and undifferentiated SH-SY5Y cells. The most prominent difference observed was the significant increase of octanoylcarnitine in cells treated with solvent-based paclitaxel, which was found to be associated with significant decrease of medium-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase (MCAD). The findings suggested the potential role of altered fatty acid oxidation in the different neurotoxicity patterns observed, which may be a possible target for therapeutic interventions worth further investigation."

The study of knowledge sharing in Saudi higher education is limited and offers little guidance to administrators, as well as faculty on how to capitalize on knowledge sharing and utilize it to their own and organizations’ benefits. This research presents findings from an original quantitative study testing a structural equation model linking social cognitive theory to knowledge sharing collection and donation measured by validated scales from the extant literature. Community characteristics including altruism and reputation carry significant positive effects on knowledge sharing collection and donation. Similarly, personal outcomes expectations possess a moderate positive effect on knowledge sharing collection and donation. Self-efficacy in knowledge sharing emerged as an important predictor of knowledge sharing activities among Saudi academics. The findings suggest the need for developing professional training seminars on using social media for knowledge sharing in formal departmental and college settings. Further, the results confirm the relevance of social cognitive theory for the study of knowledge sharing. This creates the need for Saudi universities to invest in mentorship programs using digital platforms where personal and community outcomes’ expectations are likely to improve among academics thereby increasing knowledge sharing activity."
https://openalex.org/W3137592120,"Background IgA nephropathy (IgAN) advances from multiple pathogenic “hits” resulting in poorly O-galactosylated IgA1 glycoforms (Gd-IgA1), production of antibodies and glomerular deposition of immune complexes. A sequence of immune responses arising from plasma cells, T cells and antigen presenting cells (APCs), causes glomerular injury. This study was designed to phenotype subsets of B cells, monocytes and T cells in the peripheral circulation and their association with inflammatory cytokines and kidney function in patients with IgAN, healthy controls (HC) and disease controls with autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD). Methods Patients with IgAN (n = 13), median estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) of 57 ml/min/1.73m 2 (IQR 42–84), patients with ADPKD (n = 13) matched for kidney function, gender and age and gender and age-matched HC (n = 13) were recruited. CD3+ and CD3- peripheral blood mononuclear cells were isolated and profiled based on their specific surface markers for different subsets of monocytes, B and T cells and analyzed by flow cytometry. Cytokines were analyzed by ELISA. Results We observed a significant decrease in the proportion of pre-switched B cells and plasmablasts, but an increase in long-lived plasma cells in the peripheral circulation of IgAN patients compared to HC. The proportion of non-classical monocytes was significantly higher in IgAN patients compared to both HC and ADPKD. We also report an association between sCD40L levels and the proportion of pre-switched B cells, as well as sCD40L and MCP-1 levels and albuminuria in IgAN patients. Conclusions We applied an easy-access method to analyze subsets of immune cells as well as relevant inflammatory mediators in IgAN patients. Our data demonstrate an altered B cell profile that indicates a pathophysiological role of the B cell lineage and an increased proportion of non-classical monocytes that suggests their role in the disease process."
https://openalex.org/W3138445960,"Background In Switzerland, details of current anaesthesia practice are unknown. However, they are urgently needed to manage anaesthesia drug supply in times of drug shortages due to the pandemic. Methods We surveyed all Swiss anaesthesia institutions in April 2020 to determine their annual anaesthesia activity. Together with a detailed analysis on anaesthetic drug use of a large, representative Swiss anaesthesia index institution, calculations and projections for the annual need of anaesthetics in Switzerland were made. Only those drugs have been analysed that are either being used very frequently or that have been classified critical with regard to their supply by the pharmacy of the index institution or the Swiss Federal Office of Public Health. Results The response rate to our questionnaire was 98%. Out of the present 188 Swiss anaesthesia institutions, 185 responded. In Switzerland, the annual number of anaesthesias was 1’071’054 (12’445 per 100’000 inhabitants) with a mean anaesthesia time of 2.03 hours. Teaching hospitals (n = 54) performed more than half (n = 572’231) and non-teaching hospitals (n = 103) provided almost half of all anaesthesias (n = 412’531). Thereby, private hospitals conducted a total of 290’690 anaesthesias. Finally, office-based anaesthesia institutions with mainly outpatients (n = 31) administered 86’292 anaesthesias. Regarding type of anaesthesia provided, two thirds were general anaesthesias (42% total intravenous, 17% inhalation, 8% combined), 20% regional and 12% monitored anaesthesia care. Projecting for example the annual need for propofol in anaesthesia, Switzerland requires 48’573 L of propofol 1% which corresponds to 5’644 L propofol 1% per 100’000 inhabitants every year. Conclusions To actively manage anaesthesia drug supply in the context of the current pandemic, it is mandatory to have a detailed understanding of the number and types of anaesthesias provided. On this basis, the Swiss annual consumption of anaesthetics could be projected and the replenishment organized."
https://openalex.org/W3139328885,"Monocytes and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) have profound effects on tissue injury and repair. In ventilator-induced lung injury (VILI), monocytes, the majority of which are Ly6C +high , and VEGF are known to initiate lung injury. However, their roles in post-VILI lung repair remain unclear. In this study, we used a two-hit mouse model of VILI to identify the phenotypes of monocytes recruited to the lungs during the resolution of VILI and investigated the contributions of monocytes and VEGF to lung repair. We found that the lung-recruited monocytes were predominantly Ly6C +low from day 1 after the insult. Meanwhile, contrary to inflammatory cytokines, pulmonary VEGF decreased upon VILI but subsequently increased significantly on days 7 and 14 after the injury. There was a strong positive correlation between VEGF expression and proliferation of alveolar epithelial cells in lung sections. The expression pattern of VEGF mRNA in lung-recruited monocytes was similar to that of pulmonary VEGF proteins, and the depletion of monocytes significantly suppressed the increase of pulmonary VEGF proteins on days 7 and 14 after VILI. In conclusion, during recovery from VILI, the temporal expression patterns of pulmonary growth factors are different from those of inflammatory cytokines, and the restoration of pulmonary VEGF by monocytes, which are mostly Ly6C +low , is associated with pulmonary epithelial proliferation. Lung-recruited monocytes and pulmonary VEGF may play crucial roles in post-VILI lung repair."
https://openalex.org/W3136123731,"The process by which tumor cells mechanically invade through the surrounding stroma into peripheral tissues is an essential component of metastatic dissemination. Matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-mediated extracellular matrix (ECM) degradation plays an important role in this invasive process. Defining the contribution and interaction between these MMPs during invasion remains a key interest in the development of targeted anti-metastatic therapies. In this study we have utilized multiple different stromal fibroblasts and tumor cells to define the relative contributions between cancer cells and stromal cells during MMP-dependent matrix remodeling and pancreatic (PDAC) tumor cell invasion. We find that tumor cells co-cultured with the conditioned medium from stromal fibroblasts exhibited a substantial increase in invadopodial-based matrix degradation and transwell invasion. This increase is dependent on pro-MMP2 expressed and secreted by stromal fibroblasts. Further, the pro-MMP2 from the stromal fibroblasts is activated by MT1-MMP expressed on the tumor cells. Depletion of MT1-MMP, the known activator of MMP2, in tumor cells largely blocked matrix remodeling, even in the presence of stromal cell medium. In summary, these findings implicate an important interplay between MT1-MMP from tumor cells and MMP2 from fibroblasts as a key component for ECM remodeling and invasion."
https://openalex.org/W3137670912,"Background There is a dearth of studies assessing non-communicable disease (NCD) mortality within population-based settings in Uganda. We assessed mortality due to major NCDs among persons ≥ 30 years in Eastern Uganda from 2010 to 2016. Methods The study was carried out at the Iganga-Mayuge health and demographic surveillance site in the Iganga and Mayuge districts of Eastern Uganda. Information on cause of death was obtained through verbal autopsies using a structured questionnaire to conduct face-face interviews with carers or close relatives of the deceased. Physicians assigned likely cause of death using ICD-10 codes. Age-adjusted mortality rates were calculated using direct method, with the average population across the seven years of the study (2010 to 2016) as the standard. Age categories of 30–40, 41–50, 51–60, 61–70, and ≥ 71 years were used for standardization. Results A total of 1,210 deaths among persons ≥ 30 years old were reported from 2010 to 2016 (50.7% among women). Approximately 53% of all deaths were due to non-communicable diseases, 31.8% due to communicable diseases, 8.2% due to injuries, and 7% due to maternal-related deaths or undetermined causes. Cardiovascular diseases accounted for the largest proportion of NCD deaths in each year, and women had substantially higher cardiovascular disease mortality rates compared to men. Conversely, women had lower diabetes mortality rates than men for five of the seven years examined. Conclusions Non-communicable diseases are major causes of death among adults in Iganga and Mayuge; and cardiovascular diseases and diabetes are leading causes of NCD deaths. Efforts are needed to tackle NCD risk factors and provide NCD care to reduce associated burden and premature mortality."
https://openalex.org/W3137823289,"Background Reproductive well-being is a crucial element of women’s health. Due to the asymptomatic nature of gynaecological morbidities, women rarely seek medical advice in the initial period leading to delayed diagnosis and poor prognosis of subsequent disease. The present study aimed to explore the cervical cytology and its associated risk factors among women from tribal communities of the southern part of coastal Karnataka, India. Methods Papanicolaou (Pap) smear test was performed among 1140 women from three tribal populations, to detect cervical lesions, infections and reactive changes. A semi-structured questionnaire was administered to collect data on socio-demographic and reproductive characteristics of the study population. Results The most predominant gynaecological complaint among the participants was severe lower back ache (77.6%), followed by white discharge per vagina (29.0%) and menstrual irregularities (25.9%). Of the 1140 women screened, 12.4% showed cervical microbial infections, 23.6% were reported to have reactive changes, and 0.2% had epithelial cell abnormalities in the cervix. Cervical microbial infections were found to be associated with younger age group, low socio-economic status and younger age at sexual debut. Conclusion Most of the symptoms suggestive of gynaecological morbidities reported in this study are preventable or treatable. Strengthening ongoing cervical cancer screening programme and implementation of health education programmes among tribal population would be the right policy approach to prevent, detect and treat these symptoms at an early stage and to achieve acceptable health outcomes among tribal women."
https://openalex.org/W3136813858,"Background Mycobacterium Tuberculosis (TB) poses a substantial burden in sub-Saharan Africa and is the leading cause of death amongst infectious diseases. Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) are regarded as the gold standard for evaluating the effectiveness of interventions. We aimed to describe published TB treatment trials conducted in Africa. Methods This is a cross-sectional study of published TB trials conducted in at least one African country. In November 2019, we searched three databases using the validated Africa search filter and Cochrane’s sensitive trial string. Published RCTs conducted in at least one African country were included for analysis. Records were screened for eligibility. Co-reviewers assisted with duplicate data extraction. Extracted data included: the country where studies were conducted, publication dates, ethics statement, trial registration number, participant’s age range. We used Cochrane’s Risk of Bias criteria to assess methodological quality. Results We identified 10,495 records; 175 trials were eligible for inclusion. RCTs were published between 1952 and 2019. The median sample size was 206 participants (interquartile range: 73–657). Most trials were conducted in South Africa (n = 83) and were drug therapy trials (n = 130). First authors were from 30 countries globally. South Africa had the most first authors (n = 55); followed by the United States of America (USA) (n = 28) and Great Britain (n = 14) with fewer other African countries contributing to the first author tally. Children under 13 years of age eligible to participate in the trials made up 17/175 trials (9.71%). International governments (n = 29) were the most prevalent funders. Ninety-four trials provided CONSORT flow diagrams. Methodological quality such as allocation concealment and blinding were poorly reported or unclear in most trials. Conclusions By mapping African TB trials, we were able to identify potential research gaps. Many of the global north’s researchers were found to be the lead authors in these African trials. Few trials tested behavioural interventions compared to drugs, and far fewer tested interventions on children compared to adults to improve TB outcomes. Lastly, funders and researchers should ensure better methodological quality reporting of trials."
https://openalex.org/W3137084396,"Background Erectile dysfunction is one of the common sexual dysfunctions, but it is generally misunderstood as it is not a condition that threatens life. It affects an individual’s physical as well as psychosocial health and has a significant impact on sufferers and their families’ quality of life. No data are suggesting the prevalence of erectile dysfunction at the population level in Ethiopia. This research aimed to assess the prevalence and associated factors of erectile dysfunction among the male population. Methods We employed a community based cross-sectional study among 802 study participants. A two-stage random sampling method was used for enrolling study participants. Including the International Index of Erectile Function Questionnaire-5 (IIEF-5) for erectile dysfunction, data were collected using pretested and a structured questionnaire administered by an interviewer. Binary logistic regression was performed to identify factors associated with erectile dysfunction. Result Out of the total of 802 individuals, 25.4%(95% CI:(22.4, 28.3%)) (n = 204) reported erectile dysfunction. The mean age of the participants was 34.3 ± 9.6 years. Age of 40years and above [AOR = 10.74, 95% CI: (7.07, 16.35)], physical inactivity [AOR = 3.62, 95% CI: (2.40, 5.45)], depression [AOR = 4.01, 95% CI: (2.22, 7.21)], poor quality of life [AOR = 1.59, 95% CI: (1.07, 2.36)] were significantly associated with erectile dysfunction. Conclusions In this study, the prevalence of erectile dysfunction was high. Therefore, it is recommended that erectile dysfunction treatment be integrated into the health care system that focuses on educating and inspiring people on healthy eating, physical activity, and behavior enhancing wellbeing."
https://openalex.org/W3138716110,"Various species of wild, adaptable, medium-sized carnivores occur outside of protected areas, often coming into contact with people and their domestic animals. Negative human-carnivore interactions can lead to antagonistic attitudes and behavior directed at such species. In the South African Karoo, a semi-arid rangeland, the predation of small-livestock by mesopredators is common and farmers typically use a combination of non-lethal and lethal methods to try and prevent livestock losses. We used ethnographic field observations and semi-structured interviews as part of a mixed methods approach, including the quantitative and qualitative analysis of farmers’ narratives to illustrate the nuanced ways in which sheep farmers relate to the two mesopredators that consume the most livestock on their farms; black-backed jackal and caracal. Overall, farmers attributed negative characteristics to jackal and caracal but farmers’ narratives provided evidence of complex perceptions in that the animals were admired as well as disliked. Both species were seen as charismatic due to traits such as their physical appearance, their “cunning” nature and their remarkable adaptability to human activities, including lethal control. Aesthetic appreciation was an important predictor of tolerance towards both species whereas negative attitudes were associated with the perception that mesopredators should only occur within protected areas. Attitudes towards jackals also appeared to have been affected by cultural representations of them as “thieves”. We showed that perceiving mesopredators as beautiful increased the average marginal probability of a farmer tolerating them, and that this strong relationship held when controlling for other covariates such as livestock predation. We advocate the importance of understanding the cultural and aesthetic aspects of predators and considering existing positive dimensions of human-wildlife relationships that may encourage increased farmers’ tolerance, which might promote coexistence."
https://openalex.org/W3139361171,"Objective Few studies on diabetes self-management considered the patterns and relationships of different self-management behaviours (SMB). The aims of the present study are 1) to identify patterns of SMB among persons with diabetes, 2) to identify sociodemographic and disease-related predictors of SMB among persons with diabetes. Research design and methods The present analysis includes data of 1,466 persons (age 18 to 99 years; 44.0% female; 56.0% male) with diabetes (type I and II) from the population-based study German Health Update 2014/2015 (GEDA 2014/2015-EHIS). We used latent class analysis in order to distinguish different patterns of self-management behaviours among persons with diabetes. The assessment of SMB was based on seven self-reported activities by respondents (dietary plan, diabetes-diary, diabetes health pass, self-assessment of blood glucose, self-examination of feet, retinopathy-screenings and assessment of HbA1c). Subsequent multinomial latent variable regressions identified factors that were associated with self-management behaviour. Results Latent class analysis suggested a distinction between three patterns of SMB. Based on modal posterior probabilities 42.8% of respondents showed an adherent pattern of diabetes self-management with above-average frequency in all seven indicators of SMB. 32.1% showed a nonadherent pattern with a below-average commitment in all seven forms of SMB. Another 25.1% were assigned to an ambivalent type, which showed to be adherent with regard to retinopathy screenings, foot examinations, and the assessment of HbA1c, yet nonadherent with regard to all other forms of SMB. In multivariable regression analyses, participation in Diabetes Self-Management Education programs (DSME) was the most important predictor of good self-management behaviour (marginal effect = 51.7 percentage points), followed by attentiveness towards one’s personal health (31.0 percentage points). Respondents with a duration of illness of less than 10 years (19.5 percentage points), employed respondents (7.5 percentage points), as well as respondents with a high socioeconomic status (24.7 percentage points) were more likely to show suboptimal forms of diabetes self-management. Discussion In the present nationwide population-based study, a large proportion of persons with diabetes showed suboptimal self-management behaviour. Participation in a DSME program was the strongest predictor of good self-management. Results underline the need for continual and consistent health education for patients with diabetes."
https://openalex.org/W3136544628,"Objective To present the clinical and radiological characteristics of women with severe structural deterioration of the bladder and upper urinary tract secondary to Primary Bladder Neck Obstruction (PBNO), and their outcomes after bladder neck incision (BNI). Methods Retrospective evaluation of adult women who underwent BNI for PBNO at one institution. Patients were assessed for symptoms, renal function, structural abnormalities of the urinary tract and video-urodynamics. PBNO diagnosis was confirmed with video-urodynamics in all patients. BNI was performed at the 4–5 and/or 7–8 o’clock positions. Postoperative symptoms, PVR, uroflowmetry and renal function were evaluated and compared to baseline. Results Median patient age was 56.5 years (range 40–80). All presented with urinary retention–four were on clean intermittent Catheterization (CIC) and two with a Foley catheter. All patients had bladder wall thickening and diverticula. Four women had elevated creatinine levels, bilateral hydronephrosis was present in five (83.3%). After BNI, all patients resumed spontaneous voiding without the need for CIC. Median Qmax significantly improved from 2.0 [1.0–4.0] mL/s to 15 [10–22.7] mL/s (p = 0.031). Median PVR decreased from 150 to 46 [22–76] mL (p = 0.031). There were no postoperative complications. Creatinine levels returned to normal in 3/4 (75%) patients. Conclusion PBNO in women may result in severe damage to the bladder and upper urinary tract. Despite severe structural abnormalities of the bladder, BNI was effective in reducing symptoms and improving structural and functional abnormalities of the lower and upper urinary tract."
https://openalex.org/W3139187475,"Background Post-surgical follow-up is a challenge in low- and middle-income countries. Understanding barriers to trachomatous trichiasis (TT) surgical follow-up can inform program improvements. In this study, patient perceived barriers and enabling factors to follow-up after TT surgery are identified. Methods A longitudinal study was carried out in a community-based cohort of persons who received TT surgery in Bahi district, Tanzania. Questionnaires were administered before TT surgery and again after the scheduled 6-month follow-up. Those who did not return were examined at their homes. Results At baseline, 852 participants were enrolled. Of these, 633 (74%) returned at 6 months and 128 (15%) did not and were interviewed at home. Prior to surgery, attenders were more likely to report familiarity with a community health worker (CHW) (22% vs. 14%; p = 0.01) and less likely to state that time constraints are a potential reason for failure to follow-up (66% vs. 74%; p = .04). At follow-up, non-attenders were more likely to endorse barriers pertaining to knowledge about the need for follow-up, lack of transportation, and satisfaction with surgery. There was no difference in post-operative TT between attenders and non-attenders (23% vs. 18% respectively; p = 0.25). Conclusions The outcome of surgery was not a barrier to follow-up. However, better integration of CHWs into their communities and work at coordinating post-surgical care may improve follow-up rates. Moreover, provision of transportation and implementation of effective reminder systems may address patient-perceived barriers to improve follow-up."
