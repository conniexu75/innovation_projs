TRAIL induces apoptosis via death receptors (DR4 and DR5) in a wide variety of tumor cells but not in normal cells. The objectives of this study are to investigate the intracellular mechanisms by which TRAIL induces apoptosis. The death receptor Fas, upon ligand binding, trimerizes and recruits the adaptor protein FADD through the cytoplasmic death domain of Fas. FADD then binds and activates procaspase-8. It is unclear whether FADD is required for TRAIL-induced apoptosis. Here we show that the signaling complex of DR4/DR5 is assembled in response to TRAIL binding. FADD and caspase-8, but not caspase-10, are recruited to the receptor, and cells deficient in either FADD or caspase-8 blocked TRAIL-induced apoptosis. In addition, TRAIL initiates the activation of caspases, the loss of mitochondrial transmembrane potential (Δψm), the cleavage of BID, and the redistribution of mitochondrial cytochrome c. Treatment of Jurkat cells with cyclosporin A delayed TRAIL-induced Δψm, caspase-3 activation and apoptosis. Similarly, Overexpression of Bcl-2 or Bcl-XL delayed, but did not inhibit, TRAIL-induced Δψm and apoptosis. In contrast, XIAP, cowpox virus CrmA and baculovirus p35 inhibited TRAIL-induced apoptosis. These data suggest that death receptors (DR4 and DR5) and Fas receptors induced apoptosis through identical signaling pathway, and TRAIL-induced apoptosis via both mitochondrial-dependent and -independent pathways."

In the present study, we determined the role of G proteins in eNOS activation by estrogen. Estradiol-17β (E2, 10−8m) and acetylcholine (10−5m) caused comparable increases in NOS activity (15 min) in intact endothelial cells that were fully blocked by pertussis toxin (Ptox). In addition, exogenous guanosine 5′-O-(2- thiodiphosphate) inhibited E2-mediated eNOS stimulation in isolated endothelial plasma membranes, and Ptox prevented enzyme activation by E2 in COS-7 cells expressing ERα and eNOS. Coimmunoprecipitation studies of plasma membranes from COS-7 cells transfected with ERα and specific Gα proteins demonstrated E2-stimulated interaction between ERα and Gαi but not between ERα and either Gαq or Gαs; the observed ERα-Gαi interaction was blocked by the ER antagonist ICI 182,780 and by Ptox. E2-stimulated ERα-Gαi interaction was also demonstrable in endothelial cell plasma membranes. Cotransfection of Gαi into COS-7 cells expressing ERα and eNOS yielded a 3-fold increase in E2-mediated eNOS stimulation, whereas cotransfection with a protein regulator of G protein signaling, RGS4, inhibited the E2 response. These findings indicate that eNOS stimulation by E2 requires plasma membrane ERα coupling to Gαi and that activated Gαimediates the requisite downstream signaling events. Thus, novel G protein coupling enables a subpopulation of ERα to initiate signal transduction at the cell surface. Similar mechanisms may underly the nongenomic actions of other steroid hormones.

The hormone estrogen classically exerts its effects by modifying gene expression through the action of estrogen receptors that serve as transcription factors (1Carson-Jurica M.A. Scrader W.T. O'Malley B.W. Endocr. Rev. 1990; 11: 201-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (744) Google Scholar). There are also important nongenomic actions of estrogen in a variety of tissues including bone, mammary gland, pituitary gland, neuron, ovary, and vasculature (2Pappas T.C. Gametchu B. Watson C.S.

We and others have previously shown that estrogen acutely stimulates the endothelial isoform of nitric oxide synthase (eNOS)1 by mechanisms that are nongenomic yet mediated by estrogen receptor α (ERα) (6Lantin-Hermoso R.L.

Recent studies demonstrate that there is a subpopulation of ERα localized to the endothelial cell plasma membrane in caveolae, where it functions in a signaling module with eNOS (9Chambliss K.L. Yuhanna I.S. Mineo C. Liu P. German Z. Sherman T.S. Mendelsohn M.E. Anderson R.G.W. Shaul P.W. Circ. Res. 2000; 87: e44-e52Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Involvement of the tyrosine kinase-MAP kinase signaling pathway has been implicated in the mechanism of ER-mediated eNOS activation (8Chen Z. Yuhanna I.S. Galcheva-Gargova Z. Karas R.H. Mendelsohn M.E. Shaul P.W. J. Clin. Invest. 1999; 103: 401-406Crossref PubMed Scopus (800) Google Scholar), and very recent work supports a role for the recruitment of the PI3-kinase-Akt pathway that may entail direct interaction between ERα and the p85 subunit of PI3-kinase (10Haynes M.P.

Brazil D.P. Ley K. Chin W.W. Liao J.K. Nature. 2000; 407: 538-541Crossref PubMed Scopus (1236) Google Scholar). However, the mechanisms by which plasma membrane ERα initiate signaling events remain unresolved (12Mendelsohn M.E. Circ. Res. 2000; 87: 956-960Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). The best-described agonists for eNOS, acetylcholine and bradykinin, activate specific plasma membrane-associated G protein-coupled receptors (GPCR) (13Liu J. Conklin B.R. Blin N. Yun J. Wess J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 11642-11646Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar, 14Vanhouette P.M. Eur. Heart J. 1997; 18: E19-E29Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). G proteins are heterotrimers of α, β, and γ subunits (Gαβγ), which dissociate into Gα and Gβγ upon GPCR stimulation, and activated Gα and/or Gβγ then modulate the activity of downstream effector molecules. Based on sequence and functional similarities, the α subunits are divided into four subfamilies: Gαs, Gαi, Gαq, and Gα12/13 (15Wess J. Pharmacol. Ther. 1998; 80: 231-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (373) Google Scholar, 16Gilman A.G. Biosci. Rep. 1995; 15: 65-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). To better understand the mechanisms responsible for nongenomic ERα action in endothelial cells, the present investigation was designed to delineate the role of G proteins in eNOS stimulation by estrogen. Studies were performed in both an immortalized endothelial cell line and in transfected COS-7 cells expressing ERα and eNOS to test the hypothesis that G proteins are required for coupling of plasma membrane ERα to eNOS. Additional experiments were designed to assess potential interactions between plasma membrane ERα and Gα proteins and to determine whether downstream signaling leading to eNOS stimulation is mediated by activated Gα or Gβγ. Immortalized ovine fetal pulmonary artery endothelial cells were propagated as previously described and studied at near confluence at passage 15–27 (17Pace M.C. Chambliss K.L. German Z. Yuhanna I.S. Mendelsohn M.E. Shaul P.W. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 277: L106-L112PubMed Google Scholar). The capacity of estrogen to activate eNOS observed in the endothelial cells was replicated in COS-7 cells transfected with human ERα cDNA and bovine eNOS cDNA using LipofectAMINE Plus (Life Technologies, Inc.), as previously outlined (8Chen Z. Yuhanna I.S. Galcheva-Gargova Z. Karas R.H. Mendelsohn M.E. Shaul P.W. J. Clin. Invest. 1999; 103: 401-406Crossref PubMed Scopus (800) Google Scholar); COS-7 cells do not constitutively express ER or eNOS (9Chambliss K.L. Yuhanna I.S. Mineo C. Liu P. German Z. Sherman T.S.

Additional experiments were done in COS-7 cells in three different paradigms: 1) cotransfection with cDNAs for ERα and Gαi2, Gαq, or Gαs, 2) cotransfection with ERα and eNOS cDNAs and empty vector, Gαi1, or Gαi2 cDNA (19Mumby S.M. Heukeroth R.O. Gordon J.I. Gilman A.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 728-732Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar), or 3) cotransfection with cDNAs for expression of eNOS and ERα and either empty vector or cDNA for a negative regulator of heterotrimeric G protein-mediated signal transduction (RGS), RGS4 (20Berman D.M. Wilkie T.M. Gilman A.G. Cell. 1996; 86: 445-452Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (657) Google Scholar). The Gα cDNAs were presented in pCMV5, and RGS4 was presented in pCB6. Transfection efficiency assessed by immunofluorescence staining was ∼20%, and coexpression was evident in the majority of transfected cells. The methods used for Western blot analysis generally followed those previously reported (9Chambliss K.L. Yuhanna I.S. Mineo C. Liu P. German Z. Sherman T.S. Mendelsohn M.E. Anderson R.G.W. Shaul P.W. Circ. Res. 2000; 87: e44-e52Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). ERα and eNOS protein abundance was determined in transfected COS-7 cell lysates with a 1:100 dilution of mouse monoclonal antibody to human ERα (AER 320, Neomarkers, Inc., Fremont, CA) or a 1:2,000 dilution of polyclonal antiserum to human eNOS kindly provided by Dr. Thomas Michel (Cardiovascular Division, Brigham and Women's Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA). Additional Western blots were performed with rabbit polyclonal antibodies to Gαi1 and Gαi2 (B084, 1:12,000), Gαq (W082, 1:2,500), or Gαs (584, 1:10,000) (21Gutowski S. Smrcka A. Nowak L. Wu D.

Antiserum W082 was generously provided by Dr. Paul Sternweis (Department of Pharmacology, University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center). NOS activation was assessed in whole cells by measuring [3H]-l-arginine conversion to [3H]-l-citrulline using previously reported methods (6Lantin-Hermoso R.L. Rosenfeld C.R. Yuhanna I.S. German Z. Chen Z. Shaul P.W. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 273: L119-L126PubMed Google Scholar). The capacity of estrogen to stimulate eNOS was evaluated in incubations done in the presence of 10−8m estradiol-17β (E2). eNOS activation by the known agonist acetylcholine (10−5m) or the calcium ionophore A23187(10−5m) was also examined. Under all conditions employed, the [3H]-l-citrulline generation was fully inhibited by 2 mm nitro-l-arginine methyl ester. In selected studies, cells were preincubated with either phosphate-buffered saline alone (control) or phosphate-buffered saline containing 100 ng/ml pertussis toxin (Sigma) for 120 min, and eNOS activation was determined in the continued absence or presence of pertussis toxin (24Carty D.J. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 237: 63-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Basal NOS activity was not altered by pertussis toxin. In individual experiments, a minimum of three wells was used for each treatment group. All findings were confirmed in at least three independent studies. Additional experiments were performed in highly purified plasma membranes isolated from endothelial cells by Percoll gradient (18Shaul P.W. Smart E.J. Robinson L.J. German Z. Yuhanna I.S. Ying Y.

Chem. 1999; 274: 32512-32519Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar). We have recently demonstrated ER-mediated activation of eNOS and the presence of ERα protein in isolated endothelial cell plasma membranes. Using previously described methods, eNOS activation by 10−8m E2 was assessed in the membranes during 30-min incubations with or without 2 mm GDPβS or GTP (Sigma) or purified GTPγS added (9Chambliss K.L.

Magness R.R. J. Clin. Invest. 2000; 88: 447-455Crossref Scopus (65) Google Scholar). The methods employed for coimmunoprecipitation were similar to those previously used by others in studies of epidermal growth factor and platelet-derived growth factor receptors (27Sorkin A. Mazzotti M. Sorkina T. Scotto L. Beguinot L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 13377-13384Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar, 28Liu P. Wang P. Michaely P. Zhu M. Anderson R.G.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 31648-31654Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). COS-7 cells transfected with ERα and Gαi, Gαq, or Gαs cDNA 48 h earlier were treated with vehicle or 10−8m E2 for 20 min and homogenized with a Dounce apparatus in ice-cold 0.25 msucrose buffer containing 1 mm EDTA and 20 mmTricine, pH 7.8. Aliquots of whole cell lysate were saved, the plasma membrane fraction was isolated (9Chambliss K.L. Yuhanna I.S. Mineo C. Liu P. German Z. Sherman T.S. Mendelsohn M.E. Anderson R.G.W. Shaul P.W. Circ. Res. 2000; 87: e44-e52Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and 400 µg of plasma membrane was dissolved by dilution in an equal volume of buffer (final concentrations: 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mmNaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.25% sodium deoxycholate, 1 mmEDTA). The plasma membrane samples were precleared with protein A/G Plus-agarose beads (Calbiochem, San Diego, CA) for 60 min before the addition of either 10 µl (2 µg) of monoclonal anti-ERα antibody (AER 320) or 1 µl of polyclonal anti-Gαi (P960) (29Casey P.J. Fong H.K.W. Simon M.I. Gilman A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 2383-2390Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and incubated at 4 °C overnight. The plasma membranes were further incubated for 2 h in the presence of 25 µl of protein A/G Plus-agarose beads at 4 °C, and the beads were washed four times with buffer (25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 5 mm EDTA, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100). The beads were subsequently pelleted, and immunoprecipitates were eluted by boiling for 3 min in SDS sample buffer and separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Protein transfer and Western blot analyses for ERα and Gα were done using the methods described above. Similar studies were done with plasma membranes isolated from endothelial cells previously treated with vehicle or 10−8m E2 for 20 min. In additional experiments, transfected COS-7 cells were treated with 10−8m E2 in the absence or presence of the ER antagonist ICI 182,780 (10−5m) or with 10−8m E2 in the absence or presence of 100 ng/ml pertussis toxin for 120 min prior to plasma membrane isolation. All findings were replicated in three independent experiments. Comparisons between two groups were made using Student's t test, and comparisons between more than two groups employed Student's t tests with Bonferroni correction for multiple comparisons. Nonparametric analysis was employed when indicated. Significance was accepted at the 0.05 level of probability. To evaluate the potential role of G proteins in E2-stimulated eNOS activity, intact endothelial cells were pretreated with vehicle or pertussis toxin and exposed to either the known GPCR agonist acetylcholine (10−5m) or E2(10−8m) for 15 min (Fig.1 A). In the absence of pertussis toxin, acetylcholine and E2 caused comparable NOS stimulation, as previously observed (9Chambliss K.L. Yuhanna I.S. Mineo C. Liu P. German Z. Sherman T.S. Mendelsohn M.E. Anderson R.G.W. Shaul P.W. Circ. Res. 2000; 87: e44-e52Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 17Pace M.C. Chambliss K.L. German Z. Yuhanna I.S. Mendelsohn M.E. Shaul P.W. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 277: L106-L112PubMed Google Scholar). eNOS activation by acetylcholine was fully blocked by pertussis toxin. Similarly, eNOS stimulation by E2 was prevented by pertussis toxin treatment. In contrast, pertussis toxin did not prevent eNOS activation by the calcium ionophore A23187 (data not shown). To further define the role of G proteins in E2-stimulated eNOS activation by an independent means, the effect of exogenous GDPβS on eNOS stimulation by E2 was evaluated in isolated endothelial cell plasma membranes (Fig. 1 B). When membranes were exposed to E2 alone, eNOS was activated, as previously observed (9Chambliss K.L. Yuhanna I.S. Mineo C. Liu P. German Z. Sherman T.S. Mendelsohn M.E. Anderson R.G.W. Shaul P.W. Circ. Res. 2000; 87: e44-e52Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, when GDPβS was added, eNOS stimulation by E2 was inhibited by 70%. E2-stimulated eNOS activity was not affected by GTP or GTPγS (data not shown). The plasma membrane preparations presumably contained sufficient endogenous GTP, the predominant guanine nucleotide in cells, to yield ER- and G protein-mediated eNOS activation that could not be further stimulated by additional GTP or GTPβγS. To confirm the observations made in endothelial cells and to provide a model system amenable to manipulation by cotransfection, the process was reconstituted in COS-7 cells, which do not constitutively express either ER or eNOS. The effect of pertussis toxin on E2-stimulated NOS activity in COS-7 cells transfected with eNOS and ERα is shown in Fig. 1 C. E2 treatment (10−8m for 15 min) caused eNOS stimulation that was completely blocked by pertussis toxin. Cells transfected with eNOS alone were not responsive to E2 (data not shown). Potential interactions between plasma membrane ERα and Gα proteins were first evaluated in coimmunoprecipitation studies using COS-7 cells transfected with ERα and Gαi2, Gαq, or Gαs (Fig. 2 A). Forty-eight h following transfection, immunoprecipitation was performed with ERα antibody on plasma membranes from cells treated with vehicle or 10−8m E2 for 20 min. Equivalent expression of transfected ERα and Gα proteins between study groups was confirmed by Western blot analysis of whole cell lysates. In plasma membranes from quiescent cells, Gαi, Gαq, and Gαs were minimally coimmunoprecipitated with ERα. However, the association of Gαi with ERα was markedly greater following E2 stimulation. In contrast, the association of Gαq and Gαs with ERα remained negligible after E2 treatment. To determine whether interactions occur between plasma membrane ERα and Gαi when the proteins are expressed at endogenous levels, additional studies were performed in endothelial cells (Fig.2 B). In plasma membranes from quiescent cells there was minimal Gαi coimmunoprecipitated with ERα. In contrast, interaction between ERα and Gαi was readily detectable in plasma membranes from endothelial cells treated with 10−8m E2 for 20 min. The requirement for ER activation in the induction of interaction between ERα and Gαi was tested in transfected COS-7 cells (Fig. 3 A). Forty-eight h following transfection, immunoprecipitation with ERα antibody was done on plasma membranes from cells treated with vehicle, 10−8m E2, or E2 plus 10−5m ICI 182,780 for 20 min. The abundance of ERα and Gαiprotein on the plasma membrane was comparable in the different treatment groups. As observed in Fig. 2 A, there was minimal interaction between the two proteins in plasma membrane from quiescent cells, and the interaction was enhanced by E2 treatment. In contrast, ERα-Gαi interaction stimulated by E2 was prevented by ICI 182,780. The extreme C terminus of Gα subunits is involved in the interaction of Gα with classical GPCR (30Neer E.J. Cell. 1995; 80: 249-257Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1290) Google Scholar), and pertussis toxin inhibits the function of most Gαi subfamily members by causing ADP ribosylation of a conserved cysteine at the fourth position (24Carty D.J. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 237: 63-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). To determine whether the Gα C terminus is similarly involved in the interaction of Gα with ERα, the effects of pertussis toxin on ERα-Gαi coimmunoprecipitation were evaluated in plasma membranes from transfected COS-7 cells. Forty-eight h following transfection, immunoprecipitation was performed with ERα antibody on plasma membranes from cells treated with vehicle, 10−8m E2, or E2 after pertussis toxin pretreatment (Fig. 3 B). ERα and Gαi protein abundance on the plasma membrane was similar in the various study groups. As observed in Figs.2 A and 3 A, there was minimal interaction between the two proteins in plasma membrane from quiescent cells, and the interaction was enhanced by E2 treatment. In contrast, ERα-Gαi interaction stimulated by E2 was prevented by pertussis toxin. Identical findings were obtained in parallel experiments in which immunoprecipitation was done with antibody to Gαi (Fig. 3 C); the interaction between ERα and Gαi that was enhanced by E2was prevented by pertussis toxin. Upon stimulation of classical GPCR, either the activated Gα or Gβγ subunits modulate the activity of downstream effectors (30Neer E.J. Cell. 1995; 80: 249-257Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1290) Google Scholar). The potential role of activated Gαi in acute eNOS stimulation by E2was evaluated by cotransfection of either sham vector or Gαi2 cDNA in COS-7 cells expressing ERα and eNOS. Whereas basal eNOS activity was unchanged by cotransfection with Gαi2, Gαi2 overexpression augmented E2-mediated eNOS stimulation 3-fold, and pertussis toxin completely blocked the enhanced response (Fig.4 A). Gαi1overexpression had similar effects (data not shown). The role of activated, endogenous Gαi was further substantiated in experiments assessing the effect of a negative regulator of heterotrimeric G protein-mediated signal transduction, or RGS. RGS4 is known to attenuate signaling by accelerating the GTPase activity of members of the Gαi and Gαqsubfamilies but not that of Gαs or Gα12/13(31Huang C. Hepler J.R. Gilman A.G. Mumby S.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 6159-6163Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). eNOS activation by E2 was evaluated in COS-7 cells expressing ERα and eNOS that were cotransfected with either sham vector or RGS4 cDNA (Fig. 4 B). In cells overexpressing RGS4, estrogen-mediated eNOS stimulation was decreased by 90%. Nongenomic actions of estrogen on vascular cells play a significant role in the cardioprotective properties of the hormone (32Mendelsohn M.E. Karas R.H. N. Engl. J. Med. 1999; 340: 1801-1811Crossref PubMed Scopus (2540) Google Scholar). In an effort to elucidate the underlying mechanisms, we and others have previously shown that estrogen acutely stimulates NO production in endothelium and that this is due to the activation of plasma membrane-associated ERα, leading to eNOS stimulation (6Lantin-Hermoso R.L. Rosenfeld C.R. Yuhanna I.S. German Z. Chen Z. Shaul P.W. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 273: L119-L126PubMed Google Scholar, 9Chambliss K.L. Yuhanna I.S. Mineo C. Liu P. German Z. Sherman T.S. Mendelsohn M.E. Anderson R.G.W. Shaul P.W. Circ. Res. 2000; 87: e44-e52Crossref PubMed Google Scholar,33Russel K.S. Haynes M.P. Sinha D. Clerisme E. Bender J.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 5930-5935Crossref PubMed Scopus (338) Google Scholar). In the present study, we employed a variety of approaches to show that plasma membrane ERα are coupled to eNOS via G proteins. This includes experiments demonstrating that plasma membrane ERα protein interacts with Gαi protein in endothelial cells. To our knowledge, this is the first evidence in any cell type that steroid hormone receptor proteins interact with G proteins. All known GPCR have seven transmembrane-spanning domains linked by alternating intracellular and extracellular loops. Extensive experimentation indicates that the GPCR intracellular domains function in the signal propagation to Gαβγ (15Wess J. Pharmacol. Ther. 1998; 80: 231-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (373) Google Scholar, 34Morris A.J. Malbon C.C. Physiol. Rev. 1999; 79: 1373-1430Crossref PubMed Scopus (398) Google Scholar). Because the structure of ERα is entirely different from any known GPCR, it is unlikely that ERα-Gαi interaction is direct. Alternatively, ERα may be coupled to a classical GPCR that interacts directly with Gαi. There is recent evidence that cross-talk of this type can occur to enable non-GPCR to perform G protein-mediated functions, such as the direct protein-protein coupling of γ-aminobutyric acid, type A receptors to dopamine D5 receptors in hippocampal neurons. The cross-talk involves specific domains on both the non-GPCR undergoing ligand activation and the GPCR interacting with G protein (35Liu F. Wan Q. Pristupa Z.B., Yu, X. Wang Y.T. Niznik H.B. Nature. 2000; 403: 274-280Crossref PubMed Scopus (1) Google Scholar). Detailed mutagenesis and yeast two-hybrid studies are now warranted to identify the domain(s) of ERα and the potential intermediary protein(s) required for ERα interaction with Gαi. We present multiple lines of converging evidence that indicate that Gαi mediates estrogen stimulation of eNOS. Whereas inhibition of the signaling event in isolated plasma membranes with GDPβS implicates any G protein isoform, attenuation by RGS4 in the COS-7 cell system narrows the field down to the Gαi or Gαq subfamilies (20Berman D.M. Wilkie T.M. Gilman A.G. Cell. 1996; 86: 445-452Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (657) Google Scholar, 31Huang C. Hepler J.R. Gilman A.G. Mumby S.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 6159-6163Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). The inhibition of ER-mediated eNOS activation by pertussis toxin implicates Gαisubfamily members only, of which Gαi is expressed in endothelial cells, whereas Gαo is not (16Gilman A.G. Biosci. Rep. 1995; 15: 65-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar, 24Carty D.J. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 237: 63-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 30Neer E.J. Cell. 1995; 80: 249-257Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1290) Google Scholar). The role of Gαi is further supported by the demonstration of an interaction between ERα and Gαi proteins in plasma membranes from transfected COS-7 cells that is dependent on ERα ligand binding, and by confirmation of this interaction in membranes from endothelial cells. In addition, the augmentation in signaling between ERα and eNOS with overexpression of Gαi in the COS-7 cell system not only confirms the proximal role of Gαi but also indicates that it is the α subunit, rather than Gβγ, that transmits the signal downstream to the effector. Our findings differ from those of a previous report in which membranes from Chinese hamster ovary cells overexpressing ER demonstrated increased binding of GTPγS to Gαs and Gαq upon activation by E2 (36Razandi M. Pedram A. Greene G.L. Levin E.R. Mol. Endocrinol. 1999; 13: 307-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (1014) Google Scholar). However, the latter studies were performed in a different cell type, they were limited to an overexpression paradigm, and G protein function and interaction with ER were not evaluated. The extreme C terminus of Gα subunits are involved in the interaction of Gα with classical GPCR (30Neer E.J. Cell. 1995; 80: 249-257Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1290) Google Scholar). To determine whether the Gαi C terminus plays a similar role in the interaction of Gαi with ERα, the effect of pertussis toxin on ERα-Gαi coimmunoprecipitation was evaluated in plasma membranes from transfected COS-7 cells. Pertussis toxin, which inhibits Gα function by causing ADP ribosylation of a conserved cysteine at the fourth position (24Carty D.J. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 237: 63-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar), prevented the coimmunoprecipitation of Gαi with ERα antisera that is induced by E2stimulation. In a parallel manner, the coimmunoprecipitation of ERα with Gαi antisera was enhanced after E2stimulation, and it was blunted by pertussis toxin. Thus, it is likely that the C terminus of Gαi is involved in ERα-Gαi interaction. In previous experiments, we showed that eNOS activation by E2 is prevented by tyrosine kinase or MAP kinase kinase inhibition and that the hormone causes MAP kinase activation in endothelial cells (8Chen Z. Yuhanna I.S. Galcheva-Gargova Z. Karas R.H. Mendelsohn M.E. Shaul P.W. J. Clin. Invest. 1999; 103: 401-406Crossref PubMed Scopus (800) Google Scholar). These observations are consistent with ER-mediated MAP kinase activation reported in other cells (3Watters J.J. Campbell J.S. Cunningham M.J. Krebbs E.G. Dorsa D.M. Endocrinology. 1997; 138: 4030-4033Crossref PubMed Scopus (421) Google Scholar, 37Migliaccio A. Di Dominico M. Castoria G. de Falco A. Bontempo P. Nola E. Aurrichio F. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 1292-1300Crossref PubMed Scopus (871) Google Scholar), and they suggest that tyrosine kinase-MAP kinase signaling plays a role in ER-mediated stimulation of eNOS. More recently, other laboratories have provided evidence that the activation of the enzyme by E2involves the PI3-kinase-Akt pathway. This includes studies demonstrating a direct interaction of ERα with the p85 regulatory subunit of PI3-kinase (10Haynes M.P. Sinha D. Russel K.S. Collinge M. Fulton D. Morales-Ruiz M. Sessa W.C. Bender J.R. Circ. Res. 2000; 87: 677-682Crossref PubMed Scopus (492) Google Scholar, 11Simoncini T. Hafezi-Moghadam A. Brazil D.P. Ley K. Chin W.W. Liao J.K. Nature. 2000; 407: 538-541Crossref PubMed Scopus (1236) Google Scholar). However, it remains unclear whether ERα-p85 binding occurs in vivo and whether this interaction leads to the activation of PI3-kinase. Furthermore, the possibility that additional signaling molecules may be required to activate the PI3-kinase complex remains unexplored (12Mendelsohn M.E. Circ. Res. 2000; 87: 956-960Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). The present study suggests that Gαi activation is proximal to the multiple signaling events that occur upon estrogen binding to ERα in the plasma membrane and the stimulation of eNOS that follows. Further experimentation is now indicated to determine the processes immediately downstream of ERα activation of Gαi, to define the kinetics of activation of the tyrosine kinase-MAP kinase and PI3-kinase-Akt pathways by ERα, and to understand the relative importance of these pathways in eNOS activation in vitro andin vivo (12Mendelsohn M.E. Circ. Res. 2000; 87: 956-960Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). In addition to explaining the proximal signaling events mediating the nongenomic effects of estrogen in endothelial cells, the present observations provide further support of a role for G proteins in nongenomic actions of estrogen in other cell types such as osteoblasts and neurons (4Le Melley V. Grosseet B. Lieberherr M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 11902-11907Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar, 38Kelly M.J. Lagrange A.H. Wagner E.J. Rønnekleiv O.K. Steroids. 1999; 64: 64-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). There is also accumulating evidence that certain nongenomic actions of progesterone, glucocorticoids, vitamin D3, and testosterone involve steroid hormone receptors acting through pertussis toxin-sensitive mechanisms (39Caldwell J.D. Walker C.H. Faggin B.M. Carr R.B. Pedersen C.A. Mason G.A. Brain Res. 1995; 693: 225-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 40Machelone V. Nome F. Grosse B. Lieberherr M. J. Cell.

Cell. 1999; 10: 3113-3123Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). It is anticipated that future studies of the processes by which plasma membrane ERα are coupled to Gαi in endothelial cells will provide valuable new information not only about the basis of nongenomic estrogen action in vascular and nonvascular cells but also about the means by which other steroid hormones have important nonnuclear effects.

https://openalex.org/W2063704877,"Because of increasing evidence that G protein-coupled receptors activate multiple signaling pathways, it becomes important to determine the coordination of these pathways and their physiological significance. Here we show that the beta(3)-adrenergic receptor (beta(3)AR) stimulates p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (p38 MAPK) via PKA in adipocytes and that cAMP-dependent transcription of the mitochondrial uncoupling protein 1 (UCP1) promoter by beta(3)AR requires p38 MAPK. The selective beta(3)AR agonist CL316,243 (CL) stimulates phosphorylation of MAP kinase kinase 3/6 and p38 MAPK in a time- and dose-dependent manner in both white and brown adipocytes. Isoproterenol and forskolin mimicked the effect of CL on p38 MAPK. In all cases activation was blocked by the specific p38 MAPK inhibitor SB202190 (SB; 1-10 microm). The involvement of PKA in beta(3)AR-dependent p38 MAPK activation was confirmed by the ability of the PKA inhibitors H89 (20 microm) and (R(p))-cAMP-S (1 mm) to block phosphorylation of p38 MAPK. Treatment of primary brown adipocytes with CL or forskolin induced the expression of UCP1 mRNA levels (6.8- +/- 0.8-fold), and this response was eliminated by PKA inhibitors and SB202190. A similar stimulation of a 3.7-kilobase UCP1 promoter by CL and forskolin was also completely inhibited by PKA inhibitors and SB202190, indicating that these effects on UCP1 expression are transcriptional. Moreover, the PKA-dependent transactivation of the UCP1 promoter, as well as its sensitivity to SB202190, was fully reproduced by a 220-nucleotide enhancer element from the UCP1 gene. We similarly observed that increased phosphorylation of ATF-2 by CL was sensitive to both H89 and SB202190, while phosphorylation of cAMP-response element-binding protein was inhibited only by H89. Together, these studies illustrate that p38 MAPK is an important downstream target of the beta-adrenergic/cAMP/PKA signaling pathway in adipocytes, and one of the functional consequences of this cascade is stimulation of UCP1 gene expression in brown adipocytes."

Chem. 274, 37012–37020). Analysis of platelet RNA by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction revealed that α-actinin expressed in platelets is identical to the cytoskeletal/non-muscle isoform. A construct of this isoform containing a His6 tag at the amino terminus was generated. Robust tyrosine phosphorylation of the recombinant protein was detected in cells treated with the tyrosine phosphatase inhibitor vanadate. The tyrosine phosphorylation site was localized to the amino-terminal domain by proteolytic digestion. A recombinant α-actinin protein containing a Tyr → Phe mutation at position 12 (Y12F) was no longer phosphorylated when expressed in vanadate-treated cells, indicating that tyrosine 12 is the site of phosphorylation. The wild type recombinant protein was not phosphorylated in cells lacking the focal adhesion kinase (FAK). Re-expression of FAK in these cells restored α-actinin phosphorylation. Purified wild type α-actinin, but not the Y12F mutant, was phosphorylated in vitro by wild type as well as a Phe-397 mutant of FAK. In contrast, no phosphorylation was detected in the presence of a kinase-dead FAK. Tyrosine phosphorylation reduced the amount of α-actinin that cosedimented with actin filaments. These results establish that α-actinin is a direct substrate for FAK and suggest that α-actinin mediates FAK-dependent signals that could impact the physical properties of the cytoskeleton. α-Actinin is tyrosine-phosphorylated in activated human platelets (Izaguirre, G., Aguirre, L., Ji, P., Aneskievich, B., and Haimovich, B.

Trends Biochem. Sci. 1991; 16: 87-92Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar). α-Actinins form homodimers composed of two polypeptide subunits arranged in an antiparallel orientation. Three highly conserved domains have been identified in the protein (3Puius Y.A. Mahoney N.M. Almo S.C. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1998; 10: 23-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). The amino terminus contains two calponin-like actin-binding modules that can fold independently (4Goldsmith S.C. Pokala N. Shen W. Fedorov A.A. Matsudaira P. Almo S.C. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1997; 4: 708-712Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). The central region is composed of four spectrin-like α-helical repeats that are involved in monomer-monomer interaction. The carboxyl terminus contains one or two calcium binding (EF) motifs depending on the isoform. At least four human α-actinin genes have been described. One gene (aac1) gives rise to two alternative splice variants; the cytoskeletal/non-muscle isoform contains two EF hand motifs, whereas the second variant, known as the smooth muscle isoform, has a single EF hand motif (5Millake D.B.

Chiba H. Hirohashi S. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 140: 1383-1393Crossref PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar). The two remaining genes, aac2 and aac3, encode several skeletal muscle isoforms (9Beggs A.H.

The localization of α-actinin in focal adhesion plaques suggested that it might serve to anchor the network of actin filaments to the plasma membrane. This possibility was substantiated by the finding that α-actinin associates with the cytoplasmic tail of members of several adhesion receptors families including integrins (11Otey C.A. Pavalko F.M.

A third group of proteins that interact with α-actinin includes signaling molecules such as extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1 (22Leinweber B.D. Leavis P.C. Grabarek Z. Wang C.L. Morgan K.G.

The broad spectrum of molecules with which α-actinin interacts strongly suggests that in addition to its role as an actin cross-linking protein, α-actinin also functions as a scaffold to promote protein-protein interactions. As a scaffold protein that is closely associated with both transmembrane adhesion receptors and cytoskeletal proteins, α-actinin may be an attractive regulatory target. Calcium binding to the EF hand modules in α-actinin decreases the interaction between α-actinin and actin (26de Arruda M.V. Watson S. Lin C.S. Leavitt J. Matsudaira P. J.

More recently, Greenwood et al. (30Greenwood J.A. Theibert A.B. Prestwich G.D. Murphy-Ullrich J.E. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 150: 627-642Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar) reported that in rat embryonic fibroblasts, phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-triphosphate, a lipid product of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, bound to α-actinin. Immunoprecipitation studies suggested that the binding of phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-triphosphate to α-actinin decreased the binding affinity of α-actinin for β3 and β1 integrins (30Greenwood J.A. Theibert A.B. Prestwich G.D. Murphy-Ullrich J.E. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 150: 627-642Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). This correlated with a relocalization of α-actinin and actin to the cell cortex and was accompanied by dissolution of actin stress fibers. These data raise the possibility that the interaction between α-actinin and its ligands may be regulated by more than one mechanism. Protein phosphorylation is a common signaling relay mechanism in numerous cellular processes. We have recently reported that α-actinin is tyrosine-phosphorylated in activated platelets (1Izaguirre G. Aguirre L. Ji P. Aneskievich B. Haimovich B. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 37012-37020Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Tyrosine phosphorylation of α-actinin was also observed in activated T-cells (31Egerton M. Moritz R.L. Druker B. Kelso A. Simpson R.J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 224: 666-674Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). The question of whether α-actinin is phosphorylated in non-hematopoietic cells is currently unresolved. We considered the possibility that the robust phosphorylation of α-actinin in platelets may be due to the expression of a distinct platelet α-actinin isoform. Analysis of platelet RNA by RT-PCR1 and sequencing of the resulting cDNA revealed that the α-actinin isoform expressed in platelets is identical to the human cytoskeletal/non-muscle isoform. Next, we generated and expressed a recombinant His-tagged construct of the human cytoskeletal/non-muscle isoform in various cell types. Using the recombinant protein we show that α-actinin is phosphorylated in non-hematopoietic cells and that the tyrosine residue at position 12 in α-actinin is the site of phosphorylation. In platelets, tyrosine phosphorylation of α-actinin and the focal adhesion kinase (FAK) are closely regulated events raising the possibility that α-actinin is a FAK substrate (32Haimovich B. Lipfert L. Brugge J.S. Shattil S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 15868-15877Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 33Haimovich B. Kaneshiki N. Ji P. Blood. 1996; 87: 152-161Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 34Lipfert L. Haimovich B. Schaller M. Cobb B.S. Parsons J.T. Brugge J.S. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 119: 905-912Crossref PubMed Scopus (632) Google Scholar). Consistent with this possibility we show that α-actinin is not phosphorylated in cells that lack FAK and that re-expression of FAK restored the phosphorylation of wild type α-actinin in these cells. Furthermore, wild type α-actinin, but not a mutant protein carrying a Tyr → Phe substitution at position 12 (Y12F), was phosphorylated by FAK in vitro, whereas a kinase-dead FAK mutant protein did not stimulate phosphorylation. Phosphorylation reduced the binding of α-actinin to actin. These data establish that α-actinin is a novel FAK substrate and as such is likely to transduce FAK-dependent signals that regulate the organization of the cytoskeleton. Human platelets were isolated by gel filtration from freshly drawn blood anticoagulated with 0.15 volumes of National Institutes of Health formula A acid-citrate-dextrose solution supplemented with 1 µm prostaglandin E1 and 1 unit/ml apyrase as described previously (32Haimovich B. Lipfert L. Brugge J.S. Shattil S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 15868-15877Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The platelet concentration was adjusted to 2–5 × 108 platelets/ml in an incubation buffer containing 137 mm NaCl, 2.7 mm KCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 5.6 mm glucose, 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 3.3 mm NaH2PO4, and 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4. Platelet adhesion to fibrinogen (100 µg/ml) was studied in electrically untreated polystyrene plates precoated with fibrinogen and blocked with bovine serum albumin as described previously (32Haimovich B. Lipfert L. Brugge J.S. Shattil S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 15868-15877Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Cell spreading was promoted by the addition of 10 nm phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate. Platelets were isolated from 100 ml of fresh blood, pelleted by centrifugation, and resuspended in 3 ml of TRIzol (Life Technologies, Inc.). Reverse transcription of RNA and amplification of cDNA were carried out utilizing the one-step RT-PCR System. Approximately 200 ng of total RNA were used in a 50-µl reaction mixture with the reverse transcription step at 50 °C for 30 min followed by 2 min at 94 °C. cDNA amplification was accomplished in 40 cycles of denaturation at 94 °C for 30 s, annealing at 55 °C for 15 s, and extension at 72 °C for 1 min with a final one-step extension for 7 min at 72 °C. Two sets of primers that matched the sequence of the human non-muscle isoform of α-actinin (GenBankTM accession number X15804) (5Millake D.B. Blanchard A.D. Patel B. Critchley D.R.

When combined, the two PCR products contained the complete sequence of the cDNA. The nucleotide sequence from the PCR products was determined using primers that hybridized to the cytoskeletal/non-muscle isoform of α-actinin. Using these primers, the entire platelet α-actinin cDNA product was sequenced. The cell line MCR-5 was obtained from the American Type Culture Collection. RNA from MCR-5 cells was extracted and analyzed by RT-PCR as described above. One set of primers was used to amplify the smooth muscle α-actinin isoform (primer 3, 5′-gag atc aat ggc aaa tgg-3′ (forward) and 5′-aca atc cat cat acc agt ctt c (reverse)) (see Fig. 1). The latter primer (primer 3, reverse) matched the sequence unique to the human smooth muscle isoform (6Waites G.T. Graham I.R. Jackson P. Millake D.B. Patel B. Blanchard A.D. Weller P.A. Eperon I.C.

McAfee M. Kwiatkowski D.J. Am. J. Hum. Genet. 1990; 47: 62-71PubMed Google Scholar) (a gift from Dr. Avri Ben-Z'eev) was subcloned in frame into pQE-31 vector (Qiagen, Inc. Chatsworth, CA), resulting in the addition of a His6 tag to the amino terminus. The gene was then subcloned into the vector pcDNA3.1(+) (Invitrogen Corp., San Diego, CA) for mammalian expression. Tyrosines at positions 4, 12, 193, and 319 were replaced with phenylalanines using QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) and Pfu Turbo DNA polymerase to make single base changes from TAT and TAC to TTT and TTC, respectively.

DNA sequencing was performed to confirm the correct introduction of the mutations. The synthesis of the primers and the DNA sequencing were carried out at Integrated DNA Technologies, Inc. (Coralville, IA). The fibroblasts established from FAK−/− and p53−/− mouse embryos (35Ilic D. Furuta Y. Kanazawa S. Takeda N. Sobue K. Nakatsuji N. Nomura S. Fujimoto J. Okada M. Yamamoto T.

Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 2677-2691Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and used at passages 15–25. Transfection of COS-7 cells and the FAK−/− fibroblasts was carried out using the LipofectAMINE Plus reagents (Life Technologies, Inc.) following the procedure recommended by the vendor. Where indicated, vanadate (sodium vanadate, Fisher catalog number S454-50) was added to the culture medium 48 h after transfection. Vanadate (100 mm stock solution) was dissolved in deionized water, boiled for 5 min, and used at a 1:200 dilution (500 µm). Unless otherwise indicated, the cells were cultured in the presence of vanadate for 24 h prior to analysis. To immunoprecipitate the recombinant proteins, adherent COS-7 cells were lysed in RIPA buffer (1% Triton X-100, 1% deoxycholic acid, 0.1% sodium dodecyl sulfate, 158 mm NaCl, 10 mmTris, pH 7.2, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 1 mm vanadate). The samples were normalized for protein content (200–400 µg of protein/sample in 500 µl) and were precleared for 30 min with 20 µl of protein A/G-agarose beads (Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Santa Cruz, CA) followed by an incubation with 4 µg of an anti-His monoclonal antibody (Qiagen, Inc.) for 2 h. Antibody-antigen complexes were precipitated with 20 µl of protein A/G-agarose beads, washed with RIPA buffer, and eluted with Laemmli's loading buffer. The proteins were resolved by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and blotted onto nitrocellulose. Where indicated, the RIPA washes were followed by three washes with 50 mm Tris, pH 8, 0.25 mm MgCl2. The immune complexes were next incubated for 2 h with 50 mm Tris, pH 8, 0.25 mm MgCl2 in the absence or the presence ofEscherichia coli alkaline phosphatase (5 units/sample) (Calbiochem, San Diego, CA) prior to elution with Laemmli's loading buffer. A monoclonal antibody to tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins (4G10; Upstate Biotechnology, Inc., Lake Placid, NY), an antiserum to α-actinin (antiserum generated by immunizing rabbits with a 14-mer peptide derived from residues 25–38 of human α-actinin), an anti-FAK antiserum directed against the FAK carboxyl-terminal region (36Sieg D.J. Hauck C.R. Schlaepfer D.D. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 2677-2691Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and anti-actinin antiserum (Sigma) and anti-HA monoclonal antibodies (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA or Babco, Berkely, CA) were used for immunodetection of blotted proteins. Immunocomplexes were detected using horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit and anti-mouse secondary antibodies and visualized by chemiluminescence with enhanced chemiluminescence (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Recombinant α-actinin was transiently expressed in COS-7 cells alone or in combination with recombinant HA-FAK. Unphosphorylated and phosphorylated His-α-actinin proteins were purified, respectively, from cells that were untreated or treated with vanadate for 24 h prior to cell lysis. The recombinant proteins were purified utilizing nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid agarose beads (Qiagen, Inc.) in a column setting. Adherent cells in 100-mm dishes were lysed in 1 ml of lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1 m NaCl, 10 mm imidazole, 1 mm vanadate, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 1% Triton X-100) per dish. The cell lysate was passed several times through a 27G1/2 needle to disrupt the cells and to shear the DNA. The lysate was cleared by centrifugation and mixed with 1 ml of nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid agarose resin that was pre-equilibrated in wash buffer (same as lysis buffer but lacking Triton X-100). After 1 h of incubation with repeated resuspensions, the resin was washed with 50 ml of wash buffer supplemented with 3 m urea and then with 50 ml of 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 10 mm imidazole, and 1 mm vanadate. The proteins were eluted in 4 ml of 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 50 mm EDTA, and 1 mmvanadate. The sample was concentrated by dialysis concentration in a collodion bag with a molecular mass cut-off of 75 kDa (Schleicher & Schuell) against 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, containing 1 mm vanadate. Platelet and recombinant α-actinin isolated from COS-7 cells were subjected to in gel proteolytic digestion. Platelet α-actinin was obtained from fibrinogen adherent platelets costimulated with 10 nm phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate. The cells were lysed in Laemmli's loading buffer and electrophoresed under denaturing conditions in a 7.5% T acrylamide gel (18 cm long, 1.5 mm thick). A section of the gel was blotted onto nitrocellulose. The membrane was probed with antibodies to phosphotyrosine and to α-actinin to verify the phosphorylation of α-actinin and its position in the gel. The rest of the gel was stained with Coomassie Blue R-250 for 2 h and destained overnight. The gel was rehydrated in water until it regained its original dimensions. The α-actinin band was excised using a razor blade and placed in a microcentrifuge tube. Each gel piece was washed for 5 min with 300 µl of 50% acetonitrile and then for 30 min each with the same volumes of 50% acetonitrile, 50 mm NH4HCO3, pH 8.0, followed by 50% acetonitrile, 10 mmNH4HCO3, pH 8.0. After the last wash, the gel pieces were dried by lyophilization and stored below 0 °C. Recombinant proteins were resolved by electrophoresis under denaturing conditions in a 10% T acrylamide gel (5 cm in length, 1.5 mm thick). The protein bands were excised and washed as described above for the platelet α-actinin. In gel proteolytic digestions of α-actinin were carried out with thermolysin (0.01 µg/µl; Sigma) in 20 mmNH4HCO3, pH 8.0, 10 mmCaCl2, and 1 mm ZnCl2, or with aminopeptidase I (0.05 µg/µl; Sigma) in 20 mmNH4HCO3, pH 8.0. The dehydrated gel pieces were first rehydrated on ice for 30 min with 20 µl of buffer plus enzyme (2-fold concentrated). The volume was increased to 40 µl by adding buffer, and the samples were incubated at 30 °C for the indicated time. The digestion was terminated by the addition of 50 µl of Laemmli's loading buffer (4×) and by heating for 2 min at 100 °C. The samples (including the gel pieces) were loaded onto an acrylamide gel, and the proteins were electrophoresed and analyzed by Western blotting and immunodetection. Human 293 cells were cultured and transiently transfected with either HA-tagged wild type FAK, an autophosphorylation defective (Phe-397) FAK, or kinase inactive (Arg-454) FAK cDNAs as described previously (37Schlaepfer D.D. Hunter T. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 13189-13195Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (351) Google Scholar). After 48 h, the cells were serum-starved overnight and were then stimulated with 100 ng/ml phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate for 10 min. The cells were lysed in RIPA, and recombinant FAK proteins were isolated with antibodies to the HA tag (monoclonal antibody 16B12 from Babco, Berkeley, CA). Immunoprecipitated proteins were washed twice in Triton lysis buffer (50 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 1 mmEGTA, 1 mm sodium vanadate, 10 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 100 mm NaF, 1% Triton X-100, 10 µg/ml leupeptine, 10 units/ml aprotinin, and 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride), once with HNTG buffer (50 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 0.1% Triton X-100, 10% glycerol), and once with kinase buffer (20 mmHEPES, pH 7.4, 10% glycerol, 10 mm MgCl2, 150 mm NaCl) and were then incubated with 1 µg/sample of recombinant wild type or Y12F mutant α-actinin proteins (purified as described above from transfected COS-7 cells using the nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose beads) along with 10 µCi of [γ-32P]ATP. Phosphorylation reactions were carried out for 15 min at 32 °C, and all products were resolved by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and transferred to Immobilon polyvinylidene difluoride membrane. Direct exposures were used to visualize FAK autophosphorylation and α-actinin transphosphorylation. The amount of either α-actinin or FAK present in the reactions was visualized by immunoblotting of the same Immobilon membrane used for the direct exposure. The cosedimentation of α-actinin and actin was assayed using a method adapted from Refs.38Johnson R.P. Craig S.W. J. Biol.

Recombinant wild type His-α-actinin fusion proteins in the phosphorylated and nonphosphorylated form were purified, respectively, from COS-7 cells untreated or treated with vanadate as described above. Various concentrations of F-actin (0–0.8 µm) were mixed for 60 min at 25 °C with a constant concentration of recombinant His-α-actinin fusion proteins (0.1 or 0.2 µm dimer form) in buffer containing 50 mm NaCl, 5 mmimidazole, pH 7.0, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 0.2 mm EGTA, 0.1 mm ATP, and 1 mmNaN3. The mixes (total volume, 50 µl) were centrifuged at 140,000 × g for 25 min at 25 °C using a TLA-100 rotor in a Beckman TL-100 Ultracentrifuge. The supernatants were separated from the pellets, and all of the samples were analyzed by Western blotting. The blots were probed with antibodies to phosphotyrosine, α-actinin, or actin. The films were scan digitized using the program Adobe PhotoShop 5.0. The integrated densities of the bands were measured using the program NIH Image 1.6. We recently demonstrated that α-actinin is tyrosine-phosphorylated in activated platelets (1Izaguirre G. Aguirre L. Ji P. Aneskievich B. Haimovich B. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 37012-37020Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). We considered the possibility that the α-actinin isoform expressed in platelets is distinct from the isoforms expressed in non-hematopoietic cells and therefore more readily phosphorylated. To resolve this issue we characterized the platelet α-actinin at the molecular level. To this end, RNA was extracted from freshly isolated platelets, and RT-PCR reactions were carried out using primers based on the DNA sequence of the cytoskeletal/non-muscle isoform (aac1 human; GenBankTM accession number X15804) (5Millake D.B. Blanchard A.D. Patel B. Critchley D.R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 6725Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar).

Although multiple genetic alterations have been identified in human bladder cancer, their cause-effect relationship with the two pathways has not been firmly established. Using a urothelium-specific promoter of the uroplakin II gene, we showed earlier in transgenic mice that the urothelial expression of SV40T antigen, which inactivates p53 and pRb, induced carcinoma in situ and invasive and metastatic bladder cancer. In striking contrast, we demonstrate here that the urothelial expression of an activated Ha-ras in transgenic mice caused urothelial hyperplasia and superficial papillary non-invasive bladder tumors. These results provide strong, direct experimental evidence that the two phenotypical pathways of bladder tumorigenesis are caused by distinctive genetic defects. Our results indicate that Ha-ras activation can induce urothelial proliferation in vivo; and that urothelial hyperplasia is a precursor of low-grade, superficial papillary bladder tumors. Our transgenic models provide unique opportunities to study the detailed molecular events underlying different types of bladder neoplasms, and can serve as useful preclinical models for evaluating the in vivo efficacy of preventive and therapeutic agents that act on various signaling pathways in bladder cancer."
https://openalex.org/W2019540980,"CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein-α (C/EBPα) is a basic leucine zipper protein that controls transcription of genes important for liver function, white adipose tissue development, and granulocyte differentiation. In addition to its function in controlling gene expression in differentiated tissues, C/EBPα is also associated with an antimitotic activity. We have previously demonstrated that C/EBPα interacts with p21, a cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) inhibitor, and that C/EBPα inhibits proliferation when expressed in several different cell types (Timchenko, N. A., Harris, T. E., Wilde, M., Bilyeu, T. A., Burgess-Beusse, B. L., Finegold, M. J., and Darlington, G. J. (1997) Mol. Cell. Biol.17, 7353–7361). Here we define the regions of C/EBPα required for interaction with p21 and demonstrate that CDK2 also interacts with C/EBPα. We show that C/EBPα can cooperate with p21 to inhibit CDK2 activity in vitro. The effect of C/EBPα on CDK2 activity requires the p21 and CDK2 interaction sites within C/EBPα. C/EBPα mutants incapable of inhibiting CDK2 activity in vitro do not inhibit proliferation in cultured cells. However, C/EBPα mutants defective in DNA binding inhibit proliferation as effectively as the wild-type protein. These findings show that C/EBPα-mediated growth arrest occurs through protein interactions and is independent of its transcriptional activity.

C/EBPα regulates the expression of genes involved in gluconeogenesis, including phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase and glucose 6-phosphatase, in the liver (2Croniger C. Leahy P. Reshef L. Hanson R.W.

It is also involved in the regulation of uncoupling protein-1 in brown adipose tissue (3Wang N.D. Finegold M.J. Bradley A. Ou C.N. Abdelsayed S.V. Wilde M.D. Taylor L.R. Wilson D.R. Darlington G.J.

C/EBPα-deficient animals exhibit an absence of subcutaneous white adipose tissue and granulocytes and typically die within a few hours after birth due to hypoglycemia (3Wang N.D. Finegold M.J.

The C/EBPα-deficient animals demonstrate that this transcription factor plays a key role in tissue-specific gene expression and differentiation. Early attempts to study the transcriptional activity of C/EBPα in cell culture revealed that C/EBPα overexpression leads to cell cycle arrest (5Umek R.M. Friedman A.D. McKnight S.L.

Subsequent investigations by several laboratories have suggested that there are multiple pathways by which C/EBPα causes growth arrest (6Hendricks-Taylor L.R. Darlington G.J.

Recent work has shown that C/EBPα interacts directly with a number of components of the cell cycle such as Rb, p107, and p21 (8Timchenko N.A. Harris T.E. Wilde M. Bilyeu T.A. Burgess-Beusse B.L.

It has been suggested that C/EBPα requires interaction with Rb to bring about differentiation of adipocytes (10Chen P.-L. Riley D.J. Chen Y. Lee W.-H. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 2794-2804Crossref PubMed Scopus (386) Google Scholar). C/EBPα may also directly interact with important regulatory proteins to bring about cell cycle arrest (8Timchenko N.A.

Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 2936-2945Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In particular, C/EBPα directly interacts with p21WAF1/CIP1/sdi1 (8Timchenko N.A. Harris T.E. Wilde M. Bilyeu T.A. Burgess-Beusse B.L. Finegold M.J. Darlington G.J. Mol. Cell.

Elledge S.J. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1996; 6: 56-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (361) Google Scholar). Paradoxically, these CDK inhibitors have also been shown to activate CDKs by an increase in the rate of CDK-cyclin assembly (13LaBaer J. Garrett M.D. Stevenson L.F. Slingerland J.M. Sandhu C. Chou H.S. Fattaey A. Harlow E. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 847-862Crossref PubMed Scopus (1197) Google Scholar). The carboxyl terminus of p21 directly binds to and inhibits proliferating cell nuclear antigen-dependent DNA polymerase processivity (14Chen J. Jackson P.J. Kirschner M.W. Dutta A. Nature. 1995; 374: 386-388Crossref PubMed Scopus (510) Google Scholar). This ability is not shared by p27. Finally, there are several reports that the inhibitory activity of p21 for CDK2 can be modulated by exogenous protein binding to the carboxyl terminus. These proteins include the human papilloma virus (HPV)-16 E7 gene product (15Funk J. Waga S. Harry J.B. Espling E. Stillman B. Galloway D.A. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 2090-2100Crossref PubMed Scopus (440) Google Scholar), the SET gene product (16Estanyol J. Jaumot M. Casanovas O. Rodriguez-Vilarrupla A. Agell N. Bachs O. J. Biol.

In this study, we show that the carboxyl-terminal region of p21 binds to C/EBPα and that this site of interaction is important for a C/EBPα-dependent enhancement of CDK2 inhibition by p21. We also show that C/EBPα interacts with CDK2 and that C/EBPα mutants incapable of enhancing p21 activity for CDK2 are also defective in growth arrest. We demonstrate that the ability of C/EBPα to bind DNA is not required for C/EBPα-mediated growth arrest. We propose that C/EBPα interacts specifically with p21 and CDK2 to directly inhibit the CDK enzymatic activity required for cell cycle progression. Our findings lend support for the role of p21 as an “adaptor” protein with its effects on CDK activity being modulated by additional proteins. The full-length human C/EBPα coding sequence was cloned into pGEX-4T-1, producing an amino-terminal GST tag and a carboxyl-terminal HA tag. GST-tagged C/EBPα-HA (pGEX-4TC/EBPα-HA) was generated by PCR to include residues 1–360. The forward primer included the initiating methionine, whereas the reverse primer included the sequence for the HA tag. The PCR product was subcloned into the pCR2.1 vector. The insert was removed by EcoRI digestion and subcloned into pGEX-4T-1. All deletion mutants were constructed in a similar fashion with the PCR primers generating precisely defined deletions. These constructs were C/EBPα-HA-(1–119), -(1–160), -(1–212), -(1–286), and -(1–320). The construct encoding amino acids 1–320 was subcloned into the pcDNA3.1 vector (pcDNA3.1C/EBPα-(1–320XhoI)). The reverse primer for this construct changed nucleotide 951 from G to C, thus introducing an XhoI restriction site. The construct encoding amino acids 313–360 (pGEX-4TC/EBPα-HA-(313XhoI–360)) also made the same substitution with the forward primer. The deletion construct encoding amino acids 1–286 (pcDNA3.1C/EBPα-(1–286SalI)) contained a point mutation in the reverse primer changing nucleotide 837 from G to C, thus introducing a SalI restriction site. The deletion construct encoding amino acids 280–360 (pGEX-4TC/EBPα-HA-(280SalI–360)) also contained the same mutation generated by the forward primer, as did pGEX-4TC/EBPα-HA-(280SalI–360)K300E and pGEX-4TC/EBPα-HA-(280Sal I–360)BR3. Point mutations were generated by PCR (18Li S. Wilkinson M.F. BioTechniques. 1997; 23: 588-590Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). To generate a protein that was defective in DNA binding, pcDNA3.1C/EBPα-HA-K300E (referred to as mutant K300E), PCR was used to change nucleotide 898 from A to G in pGEX-4TC/EBPα-HA-(280SalI–360), and the insert was removed by SalI and inserted into pGEX-4TC/EBPα-(1–286SalI). The coding region for C/EBPα-HA containing this point mutation was then inserted into pcDNA3.1. The L12V mutation has been previously published (19Landschulz W.H. Johnson P.F. McKnight S.L. Science. 1989; 243: 1681-1688Crossref PubMed Scopus (418) Google Scholar). pcDNA3.1C/EBPα-HA-L12V was constructed by PCR to generate a C/EBPα fragment containing amino acids 313XhoI–360 using pMEXCEBPL12V as a template (20Friedman A.D. McKnight S.L. Genes Dev. 1990; 4: 1416-1426Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). This fragment was subcloned into pCR2.1, excised by XhoI, and subcloned into pcDNA3.1C/EBPα-(1–320XhoI). The construct for pcDNA3.1C/EBPα-HA-(119–360) was generated by digesting pcDNA3.1C/EBPα-HA with BamHI and SacII, treating with mung bean nuclease, and ligating. The GST-p21 constructs pGEX-2Tsdi1, pGEX-2Tsdi1Δ1–71, and pGEX-2Tsdi1Δ72–164 have been previously described (21Nakanishi M. Robetorye R.S. Pereira-Smith O.M. Smith J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 17060-17063Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). The p21-(1–144) construct was generated by PCR, subcloned into the pCR2.1 vector, excised with EcoRI, and subcloned into pGEX-4T-1. The construct used to generate in vitro translated C/EBPα was pCR2.1C/EBPα-HA, whereas the construct used to generatein vitro translated p21 was pCR2.1p21. Wade Harper generously provided pETCDK2 and pGSTp27. All cell lines were maintained in 3:1 minimal essential media to Waymouth's media plus 10% fetal calf serum, and HT-1 cells were induced with either 10 mm isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside or glucose as previously described (7Timchenko N.A. Wilde M. Nakanishi M. Smith J.R. Darlington G.J. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 804-815Crossref PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar). Transient transfections for growth arrest assays were performed using Fugene (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) following the manufacturer's recommendations. All growth arrest studies were performed in the 293 cell line and confirmed in both Hep3B2 cells and immortalized mouse embryo fibroblasts (22Deng C. Zhang P. Harper J.W. Elledge S.J. Leder P. Cell. 1995; 82: 675-684Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1926) Google Scholar). GST-tagged, bacterially expressed proteins were purified using glutathione beads (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The recombinant proteins were expressed in either BL21(DE3) LysS or TG-2 cells. The bacterial pellet was lysed in phosphate-buffered saline and 0.5% Nonidet P-40 plus protease inhibitor tablets (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) using a Branson Model 450 sonifier. The proteins were incubated with ∼25 µl of glutathione beads/100 ml of culture, washed three times with 1 m NaCl and three times with 50 mm Tris (pH 8.0), and eluted with 50 mmglutathione. The eluate was dialyzed against phosphate-buffered saline and concentrated using Centricon columns (Amicon, Inc.). Proteins were stored in 50 mm Tris (pH 8.0), 20% glycerol, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm EDTA, and protease inhibitors. Protein concentration was determined by Coomassie Blue (Sigma) staining relative to an albumin standard (Sigma). For CDK activity assays performed with recombinant CDK2-cyclin E purified from Sf9 cells (23Albrecht J.H. Rieland B.M. Nelsen C.J. Ahonen C.L. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 277: G1207-G1216PubMed Google Scholar), ∼2–4 ng of CDK2 was used per reaction. To this were added the recombinant proteins diluted in 20 µl of kinase buffer (50 mm HEPES (pH 7.5), 2.5 mm EGTA, 10 mm MgCl2, and 1 mm dithiothreitol), and the reaction was allowed to incubate on ice for 15 min. 2.5 µg of histone H1 (HH1), 1 µCi of [γ-32P]ATP, and 10 µm unlabeled ATP were added in kinase buffer, and the reaction was incubated at 37 °C for 30 min. The reaction was stopped by the addition of 5 µl of Laemmli sample buffer and boiling. The samples were resolved on a 10% SDS-acrylamide gel and transferred to nitrocellulose membrane. Phosphorylated HH1 was visualized by autoradiography, and the membranes were subsequently probed with antibodies. Approximately 500 µg of 293 cell nuclear extract was used for the immunoprecipitation of CDK2, which was then divided into 10 reactions for individual kinase assays. 1 µg of antibody and 10 µl of protein A-agarose were used to immunoprecipitate CDK2. After immunoprecipitation, the complexes were washed three times and resuspended in kinase buffer. Kinase reactions were then performed as described above. All assays were phosphorimaged using the Storm Model 860 PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics, Inc.) and quantitated using ImageQuant. GST pull-down assays were performed by incubating bacterial lysate containing ∼1 µg of GST-tagged protein with 14 µl of glutathione-Sepharose 4B (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) in pull-down buffer (phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and protease inhibitors). After 30 min of incubation at 4 °C, the mixture was washed and resuspended in 500 µl of pull-down buffer, and to this were added either bacterially expressed proteins or in vitro translated and [35S]methionine-labeled proteins produced using the TNT T7-coupled reticulocyte lysate kit (Promega). After a 2-h incubation at 4 °C, the Sepharose beads were washed extensively with pull-down buffer. The Sepharose beads were then resuspended in Laemmli buffer, and the proteins were resolved on an SDS-acrylamide gel and transferred to nitrocellulose membrane. Proteins interacting with the GST-tagged proteins were visualized by Western blotting or directly by autoradiography of 35S-labeled proteins. To verify equal loading of the GST-tagged proteins in the pull-down assays, the membrane was subsequently stripped and stained with Coomassie Blue. Co-immunoprecipitation of C/EBPα and CDK2 was carried out using extracts from 293 cells containing C/EBPα-HA, expressed from the transfected pcDNA3.1C/EBPα-HA vector. One 10-cm plate was harvested for nuclear extracts (7Timchenko N.A. Wilde M. Nakanishi M. Smith J.R. Darlington G.J. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 804-815Crossref PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar) and used for each immunoprecipitation reaction. 1 µg of antibodies was attached to protein A-agarose beads by incubation at 4 °C for 30 min. After washing, the nuclear extract plus Nonidet P-40 and phosphate-buffered saline was added to give a final concentration of 0.5% Nonidet P-40 and 140 mm NaCl in 500 µl. Following a 2-h incubation at 4 °C, the agarose beads were washed extensively and resuspended in Laemmli buffer. Cells were seeded onto four-chamber plastic-coated slides (LabTek). For staining, cells were washed and then fixed in 4% formaldehyde overnight at 4 °C, permeabilized in 0.5% Triton X-100 for 30 min at room temperature, and then blocked in 5% dry milk. Cells were stained with a 1:50 dilution of mouse anti-BrdUrd antibodies (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) and 1:200 dilution of rabbit anti-C/EBPα antibodies (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.) for 1 h at 37 °C in the presence of 200 units/ml exonuclease III and 0.02 units/ml DNase I. Slides were then washed and incubated with a 1:500 dilution of anti-mouse antibodies conjugated to fluorescein isothiocyanate and anti-rabbit antibodies conjugated to tetramethylrhodamine B isothiocyanate. It has been previously demonstrated by co-immunoprecipitation studies and by mammalian two-hybrid assays that C/EBPα interacts with p21 (8Timchenko N.A. Harris T.E. Wilde M. Bilyeu T.A. Burgess-Beusse B.L. Finegold M.J. Darlington G.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 7353-7361Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The amino terminus of p21 contains cyclin- and CDK-binding sites and is sufficient for inhibition of CDK activity (24Fotedar R. Fitzgerald P. Rousselle T. Cannella D. Dorée M. Messier H. Fotedar A. Oncogene. 1996; 12: 2155-2164PubMed Google Scholar, 25Harper W.J. Elledge S.J. Keyomarsi K. Dynlacht B. Tsai L. Zhang P. Dobrowolski S. Bai C. Connell-Crowley L. Swindell E. Fox M.P. Wei N. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1995; 6: 387-400Crossref PubMed Scopus (849) Google Scholar). The carboxyl terminus of p21 contains a binding site for proliferating cell nuclear antigen and cyclins (Fig. 1 A) (14Chen J. Jackson P.J. Kirschner M.W. Dutta A. Nature. 1995; 374: 386-388Crossref PubMed Scopus (510) Google Scholar, 21Nakanishi M. Robetorye R.S. Pereira-Smith O.M. Smith J.R. J. Biol.

Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 1727-1733Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). GST fusion proteins were constructed as shown in Fig.1 A. To identify interaction sites, in vitrotranslated and [35S]Met-labeled human C/EBPα was incubated with full-length GST-p21, and GST-p21 deletion mutants bound to glutathione beads (Fig. 1 B). Full-length p21 was found to interact with C/EBPα (Fig. 1 B, lane 1). However, a truncated p21 mutant lacking the carboxyl terminus, p21-(1–71), did not (lane 2). Thus, C/EBPα binds to the carboxyl terminus of p21. To verify that C/EBPα binds to p21 directly and is not mediated through an unknown protein present in the reticulocyte lysate used for the in vitro translation reactions, bacterially expressed proteins were used in a GST pull-down assay (Fig. 1 C). GST (Fig. 1 C, lanes 1and 2), GST-tagged p21 (lanes 3 and4), and GST-tagged p21 missing the last 20 amino acids (p21-(1–144)) (lanes 5 and 6) were attached to glutathione beads and incubated with His-tagged C/EBPα alone (lanes 1, 3, and 5) or with His-tagged CDK2 (lanes 2, 4, and 6). C/EBPα bound only to full-length p21 and not to GST or GST-p21-(1–144) (lanes 3 and 4). Both full-length p21 and p21-(1–144) were able to bind to CDK2 with equal efficiency (lanes 4 and 6). Thus, C/EBPα binds within the last 20 amino acids of p21. This experiment also shows that the interaction of C/EBPα with p21 is likely to be direct, due to the absence of associated cellular proteins in this assay. C/EBPα interacts with a region of p21 that overlaps or is in close proximity to the proliferating cell nuclear antigen-binding site of p21 (14Chen J. Jackson P.J. Kirschner M.W. Dutta A.

A weak cyclin-binding site in p21 has been described to encompass amino acids 153–159 (27Chen J. Peters R. Saha P. Lee P. Theodoras A. Pagano M. Wagner G. Dutta A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 1727-1733Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). The carboxyl-terminal region of p21 has also been shown to interact with several proteins, including SET (16Estanyol J. Jaumot M. Casanovas O. Rodriguez-Vilarrupla A. Agell N. Bachs O. J. Biol.

Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 2101-2111Crossref PubMed Scopus (400) Google Scholar). Experiments to define the regions of C/EBPα capable of interaction with p21 were carried out using in vitro translated p21 incubated with GST-tagged C/EBPα deletion mutants. Fig. 1 Doutlines the relevant C/EBPα deletion mutants used in this analysis. In Fig. 1 E, both full-length C/EBPα (lane 1) as well as a C/EBPα mutant containing only the first 226 amino acids (lanes 2 and 6) were shown to interact with p21 as compared with GST alone (lanes 3 and 8) or C/EBPα-(1–119) (lane 5). A C/EBPα mutant containing only the leucine zipper was also shown to interact with p21 (Fig.1 E, lane 9), suggesting the existence of two independent binding sites for p21 within C/EBPα. One interaction site was localized to the leucine zipper region (amino acids 313–360), whereas the other site was found to reside between amino acids 119 and 226 in activation domain II (32Nerlov C. Ziff E.B. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 350-362Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). For both in vitrotranslated p21 binding to GST-C/EBPα and in vitrotranslated C/EBPα binding to GST-p21, the amount of protein bound typically fell within the range of 2–4%. This is similar to previously reported levels of binding between the carboxyl terminus of p21 and other proteins (15Funk J. Waga S. Harry J.B. Espling E. Stillman B. Galloway D.A. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 2090-2100Crossref PubMed Scopus (440) Google Scholar, 17Ono T. Kitaura H. Ugai H. Murata T. Yokoyama K.K. Iguchi-Ariga S.M. Ariga H. J. Biol.

Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 2101-2111Crossref PubMed Scopus (400) Google Scholar). The ability of C/EBPα to directly interact with other cell cycle components was investigated. A panel of GST-tagged C/EBPα mutants were tested for their ability to bind bacterially expressed CDK2. As shown in Fig.2 A, C/EBPα was found to specifically interact with CDK2 through two different regions. An amino-terminal region of C/EBPα located between amino acids 119 and 160 as well as a site within the basic region located between amino acids 280 and 313 both demonstrated binding to CDK2 (Fig.2 B). The amino-terminal binding site for CDK2 in C/EBPα is contained within the region defined for p21 interaction, and further definition of interaction sites will be required to determine whether they are different for p21 and CDK2. The second site of interaction for CDK2 is clearly distinct from that for p21. The basic region of C/EBPα interacts with CDK2 and not with the leucine zipper, as was seen for p21, thus demonstrating that the carboxyl terminus of C/EBPα contains separate binding sites for CDK2 and p21. To test the in vivo interaction of C/EBPα with CDK2, co-immunoprecipitation studies were performed. C/EBPα containing a carboxyl-terminal HA tag was transiently transfected into 293 cells. After 48 h, the cells were harvested, and CDK2 was immunoprecipitated from nuclear extracts. The associated complexes were assayed by Western blotting for the HA tag present on C/EBPα-HA. As shown in Fig. 2 C, C/EBPα-HA was co-immunoprecipitated with CDK2 (lane 1), but not with anti-p19 antibodies (used as a negative control) (lane 2). When no C/EBPα-HA was transfected (lane 3), no associated proteins were detected by anti-HA antiserum. These observations show that C/EBPα is capable of interaction with CDK2 in cells. p21-binding proteins such as HPV16 E7 (15Funk J. Waga S. Harry J.B. Espling E. Stillman B. Galloway D.A. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 2090-2100Crossref PubMed Scopus (440) Google Scholar, 31Jones D. Alani R.M. Munger K.

Chem. 1999; 274: 33161-33165Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar) have been shown to affect CDK2 activity by reversing the inhibitory activity of p21 for CDK2, whereas TOK-1α is capable of promoting the inhibitory activity of p21 for CDK2 (17Ono T.

It has been previously reported that C/EBPα controls the activity of CDK2in vivo (33Timchenko N.A. Wilde M. Iakova P. Albrecht J.H. Darlington G.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 27: 3621-3630Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Because C/EBPα interacts with both p21 and CDK2, we tested whether or not recombinant C/EBPα influences p21-mediated inhibition of CDK2 activity in vitro. Purified recombinant CDK2-cyclin E from baculovirus-infected Sf9 cells was assayed for phosphorylation of HH1 in the presence of purified p21, C/EBPα, or both. After incubation, the reaction was run on a 12% acrylamide gel, transferred to a membrane, and probed using antibodies to the HA tag present on C/EBPα and p21 (Fig.3 A). As shown in Fig.3 B, CDK2 phosphorylation activity was easily detectable in the absence of p21 (lane 1; this value was arbitrarily set to 100), whereas the addition of 100 nm recombinant p21 inhibited CDK2 activity to <20% (lane 2). Lower levels of p21 (4–5 nm) resulted in ∼40% of the kinase activity seen in uninhibited CDK2 (lane 3). In the presence of the partially inhibitory level of p21, the addition of increasing amounts of C/EBPα further inhibited CDK2 activity in a dose-dependent manner (lanes 4–6). In the absence of p21, equivalent levels of C/EBPα had no significant effect on CDK2 activity (lanes 7–9). Subsequent Coomassie Blue staining of the membrane showed equal loading of HH1 (Fig.3 C). Phosphorimaging of five repeat experiments is shown in Fig. 3 D. These findings suggest that C/EBPα is capable of enhancing the inhibitory activity of p21 while not directly affecting CDK2 activity at these concentrations. Immunoprecipitation of CDK2 under conditions identical to the kinase assay did not show a specific increase in p21 bound to CDK2 complexes in the presence of C/EBPα (data not shown). This suggests that C/EBPα does not enhance the rate of p21 binding to CDK2. The interaction between C/EBPα and p21 may be transient, or there may be a conformational change induced upon binding that leads to p21 binding to CDK2 in a more “inhibitory” fashion. C/EBPα was also shown to affect CDK2 activity immunoprecipitated fr"

Because hyperthermia is used for the treatment of colon cancer in combination with chemoradiotherapy, we investigated the influence of hyperthermia on YB-1 activity and the expression of multidrug resistance-related genes. Here we report that hyperthermia causes YB-1 translocation from the cytoplasm into the nucleus of human colon carcinoma cells HCT15 and HCT116. Nuclear translocation of YB-1 was associated with increasedMDR1 and MRP1 gene activity, which is reflected in strong efflux pump activity. However, a combination of hyperthermia and drug treatment effectively reduced cell survival of the HCT15 and HCT116 cells. These results demonstrate that activation ofMDR1 and MRP1 gene expression and increased efflux pump activity after hyperthermia were insufficient to cause an increase in drug resistance in colon cancer cell lines. The ability of hyperthermia to abrogate drug resistance in the presence of an increase in functional MDR proteins may provide an explanation for the efficacious results seen in the clinic in colon cancer patients treated with a combination of hyperthermia and chemotherapy.

The development of the MDR phenotype is often associated with increased expression of certain ATP-binding cassette transporters (ABC transporters) such as P-glycoprotein and MRP1. The multidrug resistance gene (MDR1) encodes P-glycoprotein, which causes classical MDR. In contrast, the MRP1 gene encodes the multidrug resistance-related protein (MRP1), which is associated with an atypical non-P-glycoprotein-dependent MDR phenotype (1Efferth T. Curr. Mol.

Kuwano M. Cell Growth Diff. 1993; 4: 147-157PubMed Google Scholar) were described earlier. In contrast, the influence of hyperthermia on the expression of MDR genes has not been clearly established. Two groups reported a heat-induced elevation ofMDR1 gene expression, either observed following a single treatment or after repeated treatments with heat (12Chin K.V. Tanaka S. Darlington G. Pastan I.

Anticancer Res. 1998; 18: 3045-3048PubMed Google Scholar). Induction of MRP1 expression by drugs/chemicals has also been reported (3Loe D.W. Deeley R.G. Cole S.P.C. Eur. J. Cancer. 1996; 32A: 945-957Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (402) Google Scholar); however, the effects of radiation and hyperthermia on MRP1 gene expression have not been explored.Signal transduction pathways that respond to external stimuli have been extensively investigated within drug-resistant cells. Involvement of YB-1 transcription factor (14Wolffe A.P. BioAssays. 1994; 16: 245-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar) in mediating the effects of different external stimuli has been described for a variety of chemicals and drugs such as cisplatin, mitomycin C, etoposide and also for UV light (15Ohga T.

FEBS Lett. 1997; 417: 390-394Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). YB-1 belongs to the family of Y-box transcription factors, which were identified by their interaction with inverted CCAAT-boxes (Y-box; 14). Translocation of YB-1 from the cytoplasm into the nucleus was observed after treatment of cell cultures with DNA-damaging agents (15Ohga T. Koike K. Ono M. Makino Y. Itagaki Y. Tanimoto M. Kuwano M. Kohno K. Cancer Res. 1996; 56: 4224-4228PubMed Google Scholar) as well as by UV irradiation (17Koike K. Uchiumi T. Ohga T. Toh S. Wada M. Kohno K. Kuwano M. FEBS Lett. 1997; 417: 390-394Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). Nuclear expression of YB-1 has been correlated with intrinsic MDR1 expression for breast carcinomas (18Bargou R.C. Jürchott K. Wagener C. Bergmann S. Metzner S. Bommert K. Mapara M.Y. Winzer K.J. Dietel M. Dörken B. Royer H.D. Nat. Med. 1997; 3: 447-450Crossref PubMed Scopus (374) Google Scholar) and for osteosarcomas (19Oda Y. Sakamoto A. Shinohara N. Ohga T. Uchiumi T. Kohno K. Tsuneyoshi M. Kuwano M. Iwamoto Y. Clin. Cancer Res. 1998; 4: 2273-2277PubMed Google Scholar). For colorectal carcinomas, an enhanced coexpression of YB-1 and topoisomerase IIα have recently been described when compared with mucosa (20Shibao K. Takano H. Nakayama K. Okazaki K. Nagata N. Izumi H. Uchiumi T. Kuwano M. Kohno K. Itoh H. Int. J. Cancer. 1999; 83: 732-737Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar).In the present study, we examined the subcellular distribution of YB-1 in colon carcinoma cells before and after treatment with hyperthermia. Our results show that hyperthermia causes nuclear accumulation of YB-1 and concomitant increase in MDR1 and MRP1 gene expression resulting in efflux pump activity. We further show that the increase in MDR1 and MRP1 gene expression and efflux pump activity after hyperthermia were unable to reduce the amount of drug in the cells to prehyperthermia levels. Even though treatment with hyperthermia resulted in an increase in MDR1and MRP1 expression and function in HCT116 and HCT15 cells, paradoxically an enhancement of drug resistance was not observed. These observations are in accord with the clinical experience that demonstrates hyperthermia in combination with chemotherapy is an effective treatment for colon cancer.DISCUSSIONHyperthermia-induced translocation of the transcription factor YB-1 from the cytoplasm into the nucleus was observed in HCT15 and HCT116 cells and was found to be time- and temperaturedependent with highest translocation rates observed at 43 °C compared with 40 °C. The mechanism of YB-1 translocation as a reaction to external stress stimuli has also been reported after treatment of cell cultures with DNA-damaging agents (15Ohga T. Koike K. Ono M. Makino Y. Itagaki Y. Tanimoto M. Kuwano M. Kohno K. Cancer Res. 1996; 56: 4224-4228PubMed Google Scholar) or UV irradiation (17Koike K. Uchiumi T. Ohga T. Toh S. Wada M. Kohno K. Kuwano M. FEBS Lett. 1997; 417: 390-394Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). Thus, translocation caused by environmental stress factors is a general activation mechanism of YB-1. The activities of a variety of other transcription factors such as NF-κB and STAT1 are also regulated by intracellular redistribution. Moreover, the nuclear translocation of DNA-binding proteins as a response to hyperthermia has also been reported for the heat shock transcription factors HSF1 and HSF3 (31Tanabe M. Takai A. Kawazoe Y. Nagata K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 15389-15395Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar).It was previously shown that YB-1 is involved in the regulation of P-glycoprotein expression in human breast carcinomas and osteosarcomas (18Bargou R.C. Jürchott K. Wagener C. Bergmann S. Metzner S. Bommert K. Mapara M.Y. Winzer K.J. Dietel M. Dörken B. Royer H.D. Nat. Med. 1997; 3: 447-450Crossref PubMed Scopus (374) Google Scholar, 19Oda Y. Sakamoto A. Shinohara N. Ohga T. Uchiumi T. Kohno K. Tsuneyoshi M. Kuwano M. Iwamoto Y. Clin. Cancer Res. 1998; 4: 2273-2277PubMed Google Scholar). The promoter of the MDR1 gene contains a Y-box, which is responsible for basal MDR1 expression (24Goldsmith M.E. Madden M.J. Morrow C.S. Cowan K.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 5856-5869Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In this study, the direct hyperthermia-induced binding of YB-1 to the Y-box of the MDR1 gene promoter was demonstrated in HCT15 and HCT116 cells. Previous reports discussed the DNA double strand-binding protein NF-Y as a potential regulator of MDR1 expression acting via the CCAAT-box (32Sundseth R. MacDonald G. King A.C. Mol. Pharmacol. 1997; 51: 963-971Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). NF-Y was also shown to be involved in mediating effects of several stimuli such as sodium butyrate or UV irradiation (33Jin S. Scotto K.W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 4377-4384Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 34Hu Z. Jin S. Scotto K.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 2979-2985Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). In this study, however, hyperthermia did not alter the binding of NF-Y to the Y-box of the MDR1promoter, suggesting that NF-Y is not involved in hyperthermia-regulated transcriptional control of the MDR1gene.The crucial role of YB-1 in MDR1 regulation was demonstrated by using stably YB-1-transfected HBL-100 cells. In HBL-100/YB-1 cellsMDR1 promoter-driven CAT gene expression was YB-1-dependent. However, YB-1 overexpression resulted in enhanced MRP1 promoter-driven CAT expression levels as well, although no Y-box motif was identified in the human MRP1promoter (27Zhu Q. Center M.S. Cancer Res. 1994; 54: 4488-4492PubMed Google Scholar). This suggested that YB-1 interacts with unknownMRP1 promoter elements. EMSA revealed that YB-1 binds to oligonucleotides derived from the MRP1 promoter fragment J. These oligonucleotides are all very GC-rich (about 80%). The interaction of recombinant YB-1 with similar GC-rich oligonucleotides was described recently (35Izumi H. Imamura T. Nagatani G. Ise T. Murakami T. Uramoto H. Torigoe T. Ishiguchi H. Yoshida Y. Nomoto M. Okamoto T. Uchiumi T. Kuwano M. Funa K Kohno K. Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: 1200-1207Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Therefore we conclude that YB-1 may interact with the MRP1 promoter directly and that the hyperthermia-induced translocation of YB-1 into the nucleus may result in an YB-1-dependent activation of the MRP1promoter.Our data show that after hyperthermia, P-glycoprotein and MRP1 protein levels were strongly up-regulated. It has been previously reported that heat shock activates MDR1 gene expression (12Chin K.V. Tanaka S. Darlington G. Pastan I. Gottesman M.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 221-226Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 13Hever-Szabo A. Pirity M. Szathmari M. Venetianer A. Anticancer Res. 1998; 18: 3045-3048PubMed Google Scholar). Our data provide a mechanism that shows how YB-1 links hyperthermia to gene activation. Furthermore, this is the first report to show that YB-1 is involved in regulating transcription of the MRP1gene. Although several cis elements have been identified in the promoter of the MDR1 gene, which respond to environmental stress (36Kioka N. Yamano Y. Komano T. Ueda K. FEBS Lett. 1992; 301: 37-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar, 37Miyazaki M. Kohno K. Uchiumi T. Tanimura H. Matsuo K. Nasu M. Kuwano M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1992; 187: 677-684Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar, 38Kim S.H. Hur W.Y. Kang C.D. Lim Y.S. Kim D.W. Chung B.S. Cancer Lett. 1997; 115: 9-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar), no such elements were detected in theMRP1 promoter (27Zhu Q. Center M.S. Cancer Res. 1994; 54: 4488-4492PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, the observed YB-1 interaction with the MRP1 promoter provides a potential mechanism how environmental stress leads to MRP1 gene activation.Increased transcription of MDR1 and MRP1 in response to hyperthermia was associated with elevated levels of the corresponding proteins and strongly increased efflux pump activity. Despite this result, we observed accumulation of anticancer drugs in hyperthermia-treated colon cancer cells. In this case, however, increased pump activity did not lead to an enhanced MDR phenotype which has been described for chemoresistance mechanisms (39Gritti A. Colombo A. Dasdia T. Melloni E. Marchesini R. Int. J. Hyperthermia. 1993; 9: 393-401Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar).Furthermore, mechanisms other than the induction of the ABC transporters might possibly be involved in the development/regulation of the drug resistance; e.g. the hyperthermia-induced phosphorylation of P-glycoprotein (40Yang J.M. Chin K.V. Hait W.N. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 210: 21-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar) or heat-dependent factors regulating the membrane topology of a P-glycoprotein sequence (41Zhang J.T Ling V. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 9159-9165Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). In addition, other protection mechanisms against environmental stress may be present in the colon carcinoma cells (6Meijer G.A. Schroeijers A.B. Flens M.J. Meuwissen S.G.M. van der Valk P. Baak J.P.A. Scheper R.J. J. Clin. Pathol. 1999; 52: 450-454Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 42Dumontet C. Bodin F. Michal Y. Clin. Cancer Res. 1998; 4: 1563-1566PubMed Google Scholar). Moreover, general effects of thermal stress such as the induction of epithelial permeability and induction of apoptosis (43Moseley P.L. Gapen C. Wallen E.S. Walter M.E. Peterson M.W. Am. J. Physiol. 1994; 267: C425-434Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) may also affect survival.In summary, we demonstrate here that hyperthermia induces YB-1 translocation from the cytoplasm into the nucleus leading to an enhanced YB-1 binding to the MDR1 promoter sequence, followed by an increase in the expression levels ofMDR1/P-glycoprotein and MRP1/MRP1 expression. However, the hyperthermia-induced increases in these drug resistance genes and functional proteins did not result in drug resistance following treatment with adriamycin and hyperthermia. In contrast, combination of hyperthermia and drug treatment resulted in a significant reduction in cell survival of both colon carcinoma cell lines. Further studies using patient samples are required to evaluate the effect of hyperthermia and chemotherapy on MDR genes and proteins in a clinically relevant situation to assess the risk of inducing MDR proteins, which may potentially complicate subsequent chemotherapy (44Stein U. Rau B. Wust P. Walther W. Schlag P.M. Int. J. Cancer. 1999; 80: 5-12Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Moreover, analyses of patient samples would provide information necessary for determining the appropriate regimen of chemotherapy with respect to potential hyperthermia-induced resistance gene expression. Multidrug resistance (MDR)1 of human malignant tumors represents a major cause of cancer chemotherapy failure. The development of the MDR phenotype is often associated with increased expression of certain ATP-binding cassette transporters (ABC transporters) such as P-glycoprotein and MRP1. The multidrug resistance gene (MDR1) encodes P-glycoprotein, which causes classical MDR. In contrast, the MRP1 gene encodes the multidrug resistance-related protein (MRP1), which is associated with an atypical non-P-glycoprotein-dependent MDR phenotype (1Efferth T. Curr. Mol. Med. 2001; 1: 45-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). Although both transporter proteins function as drug-efflux pumps, they share only 15% amino acid homology, transport a non-identical spectrum of anticancer substrates, and show a different distribution in human normal and cancer tissues (2Germann U.A. Eur. J. Cancer. 1996; 32A: 927-944Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (426) Google Scholar, 3Loe D.W. Deeley R.G. Cole S.P.C. Eur. J. Cancer. 1996; 32A: 945-957Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (402) Google Scholar). Colorectal tumors are one of the most prevalent human malignancies and are highly drug resistant because of an MDR phenotype. Intrinsic expression of the ABC transporters P-glycoprotein and MRP1 in colon cancer has been reported (4Linn S.C. Giaccone G. Eur. J. Cancer. 1995; 31A: 1291-1294Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 5Chuman Y. Sumizawa T. Takebayashi Y. Niwa K. Yamada K. Haraguchi M. Furukawa T. Akiyama S. Aikou T. Int. J.

Pathol. 1999; 52: 450-454Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). To improve the response of colon cancer to chemotherapy, other treatment modalities such as radiation and hyperthermia when used in combination with chemotherapy may be able to increase the efficacy of cancer chemotherapy (7Rau B. Wust P. Hohenberger P. Löffel J. Hünerbein M. Below C. Gellermann J. Speidel A. Vogl T. Riess H. Felix R. Schlag P.M. Ann. Surg. 1998; 27: 380-389Crossref Scopus (140) Google Scholar). However, environmental stresses such as drugs, radiation, and hyperthermia harbor the potential to induce or to enhance the MDR phenotype. Induction of MDR1 gene expression by exposure to drugs (8Kohno K. Sato S.A. Takano H. Matsuo K. Kuwano M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1989; 165: 1415-1421Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar, 9Chaudhary P.M. Roninson I.B. J. Natl. Cancer Inst. 1993; 85: 632-639Crossref PubMed Scopus (361) Google Scholar, 10Stein U.

Kuwano M. Cell Growth Diff. 1993; 4: 147-157PubMed Google Scholar) were described earlier. In contrast, the influence of hyperthermia on the expression of MDR genes has not been clearly established. Two groups reported a heat-induced elevation ofMDR1 gene expression, either observed following a single treatment or after repeated treatments with heat (12Chin K.V. Tanaka S. Darlington G. Pastan I.

Signal transduction pathways that respond to external stimuli have been extensively investigated within drug-resistant cells. Involvement of YB-1 transcription factor (14Wolffe A.P. BioAssays. 1994; 16: 245-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar) in mediating the effects of different external stimuli has been described for a variety of chemicals and drugs such as cisplatin, mitomycin C, etoposide and also for UV light (15Ohga T.

For colorectal carcinomas, an enhanced coexpression of YB-1 and topoisomerase IIα have recently been described when compared with mucosa (20Shibao K. Takano H. Nakayama K. Okazaki K. Nagata N.

Our results show that hyperthermia causes nuclear accumulation of YB-1 and concomitant increase in MDR1 and MRP1 gene expression resulting in efflux pump activity.

FEBS Lett. 1997; 417: 390-394Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). Thus, translocation caused by environmental stress factors is a general activation mechanism of YB-1. The activities of a variety of other transcription factors such as NF-κB and STAT1 are also regulated by intracellular redistribution. Moreover, the nuclear translocation of DNA-binding proteins as a response to hyperthermia has also been reported for the heat shock transcription factors HSF1 and HSF3 (31Tanabe M. Takai A. Kawazoe Y. Nagata K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 15389-15395Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar).It was previously shown that YB-1 is involved in the regulation of P-glycoprotein expression in human breast carcinomas and osteosarcomas (18Bargou R.C. Jürchott K. Wagener C. Bergmann S. Metzner S. Bommert K. Mapara M.Y. Winzer K.J. Dietel M. Dörken B. Royer H.D. Nat. Med. 1997; 3: 447-450Crossref PubMed Scopus (374) Google Scholar, 19Oda Y.

The promoter of the MDR1 gene contains a Y-box, which is responsible for basal MDR1 expression (24Goldsmith M.E. Madden M.J. Morrow C.S. Cowan K.H. J. Biol.

In this study, the direct hyperthermia-induced binding of YB-1 to the Y-box of the MDR1 gene promoter was demonstrated in HCT15 and HCT116 cells. Previous reports discussed the DNA double strand-binding protein NF-Y as a potential regulator of MDR1 expression acting via the CCAAT-box (32Sundseth R. MacDonald G. King A.C. Mol.

Scotto K.W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 4377-4384Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 34Hu Z. Jin S. Scotto K.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 2979-2985Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). In this study, however, hyperthermia did not alter the binding of NF-Y to the Y-box of the MDR1promoter, suggesting that NF-Y is not involved in hyperthermia-regulated transcriptional control of the MDR1gene.The crucial role of YB-1 in MDR1 regulation was demonstrated by using stably YB-1-transfected HBL-100 cells. In HBL-100/YB-1 cellsMDR1 promoter-driven CAT gene expression was YB-1-dependent. However, YB-1 overexpression resulted in enhanced MRP1 promoter-driven CAT expression levels as well, although no Y-box motif was identified in the human MRP1promoter (27Zhu Q. Center M.S. Cancer Res. 1994; 54: 4488-4492PubMed Google Scholar). This suggested that YB-1 interacts with unknownMRP1 promoter elements. EMSA revealed that YB-1 binds to oligonucleotides derived from the MRP1 promoter fragment J. These oligonucleotides are all very GC-rich (about 80%). The interaction of recombinant YB-1 with similar GC-rich oligonucleotides was described recently (35Izumi H. Imamura T. Nagatani G. Ise T. Murakami T. Uramoto H. Torigoe T. Ishiguchi H. Yoshida Y.

Therefore we conclude that YB-1 may interact with the MRP1 promoter directly and that the hyperthermia-induced translocation of YB-1 into the nucleus may result in an YB-1-dependent activation of the MRP1promoter.Our data show that after hyperthermia, P-glycoprotein and MRP1 protein levels were strongly up-regulated. It has been previously reported that heat shock activates MDR1 gene expression (12Chin K.V. Tanaka S. Darlington G. Pastan I. Gottesman M.M. J. Biol.

Our data provide a mechanism that shows how YB-1 links hyperthermia to gene activation. Furthermore, this is the first report to show that YB-1 is involved in regulating transcription of the MRP1gene. Although several cis elements have been identified in the promoter of the MDR1 gene, which respond to environmental stress (36Kioka N. Yamano Y. Komano T. Ueda K.

Thus, the observed YB-1 interaction with the MRP1 promoter provides a potential mechanism how environmental stress leads to MRP1 gene activation.Increased transcription of MDR1 and MRP1 in response to hyperthermia was associated with elevated levels of the corresponding proteins and strongly increased efflux pump activity. Despite this result, we observed accumulation of anticancer drugs in hyperthermia-treated colon cancer cells. In this case, however, increased pump activity did not lead to an enhanced MDR phenotype which has been described for chemoresistance mechanisms (39Gritti A. Colombo A. Dasdia T. Melloni E. Marchesini R. Int. J. Hyperthermia. 1993; 9: 393-401Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar).Furthermore, mechanisms other than the induction of the ABC transporters might possibly be involved in the development/regulation of the drug resistance; e.g. the hyperthermia-induced phosphorylation of P-glycoprotein (40Yang J.M. Chin K.V. Hait W.N. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 210: 21-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar) or heat-dependent factors regulating the membrane topology of a P-glycoprotein sequence (41Zhang J.T Ling V. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 9159-9165Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). In addition, other protection mechanisms against environmental stress may be present in the colon carcinoma cells (6Meijer G.A. Schroeijers A.B. Flens M.J. Meuwissen S.G.M. van der Valk P. Baak J.P.A. Scheper R.J. J. Clin. Pathol. 1999; 52: 450-454Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 42Dumontet C. Bodin F. Michal Y. Clin. Cancer Res. 1998; 4: 1563-1566PubMed Google Scholar). Moreover, general effects of thermal stress such as the induction of epithelial permeability and induction of apoptosis (43Moseley P.L. Gapen C. Wallen E.S. Walter M.E. Peterson M.W. Am. J. Physiol. 1994; 267: C425-434Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) may also affect survival.In summary, we demonstrate here that hyperthermia induces YB-1 translocation from the cytoplasm into the nucleus leading to an enhanced YB-1 binding to the MDR1 promoter sequence, followed by an increase in the expression levels ofMDR1/P-glycoprotein and MRP1/MRP1 expression. However, the hyperthermia-induced increases in these drug resistance genes and functional proteins did not result in drug resistance following treatment with adriamycin and hyperthermia. In contrast, combination of hyperthermia and drug treatment resulted in a significant reduction in cell survival of both colon carcinoma cell lines. Further studies using patient samples are required to evaluate the effect of hyperthermia and chemotherapy on MDR genes and proteins in a clinically relevant situation to assess the risk of inducing MDR proteins, which may potentially complicate subsequent chemotherapy (44Stein U. Rau B. Wust P. Walther W. Schlag P.M. Int. J. Cancer. 1999; 80: 5-12Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Moreover, analyses of patient samples would provide information necessary for determining the appropriate regimen of chemotherapy with respect to potential hyperthermia-induced resistance gene expression. Hyperthermia-induced translocation of the transcription factor YB-1 from the cytoplasm into the nucleus was observed in HCT15 and HCT116 cells and was found to be time- and temperaturedependent with highest translocation rates observed at 43 °C compared with 40 °C. The mechanism of YB-1 translocation as a reaction to external stress stimuli has also been reported after treatment of cell cultures with DNA-damaging agents (15Ohga T. Koike K. Ono M. Makino Y. Itagaki Y. Tanimoto M. Kuwano M. Kohno K. Cancer Res. 1996; 56: 4224-4228PubMed Google Scholar) or UV irradiation (17Koike K. Uchiumi T. Ohga T. Toh S. Wada M. Kohno K. Kuwano M. FEBS Lett. 1997; 417: 390-394Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). Thus, translocation caused by environmental stress factors is a general activation mechanism of YB-1. The activities of a variety of other transcription factors such as NF-κB and STAT1 are also regulated by intracellular redistribution. Moreover, the nuclear translocation of DNA-binding proteins as a response to hyperthermia has also been reported for the heat shock transcription factors HSF1 and HSF3 (31Tanabe M. Takai A. Kawazoe Y. Nagata K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 15389-15395Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). It was previously shown that YB-1 is involved in the regulation of P-glycoprotein expression in human breast carcinomas and osteosarcomas (18Bargou R.C. Jürchott K. Wagener C. Bergmann S. Metzner S. Bommert K. Mapara M.Y. Winzer K.J. Dietel M. Dörken B. Royer H.D. Nat. Med. 1997; 3: 447-450Crossref PubMed Scopus (374) Google Scholar, 19Oda Y. Sakamoto A. Shinohara N. Ohga T. Uchiumi T. Kohno K. Tsuneyoshi M. Kuwano M. Iwamoto Y. Clin. Cancer Res. 1998; 4: 2273-2277PubMed Google Scholar). The promoter of the MDR1 gene contains a Y-box, which is responsible for basal MDR1 expression (24Goldsmith M.E. Madden M.J. Morrow C.S. Cowan K.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 5856-5869Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In this study, the direct hyperthermia-induced binding of YB-1 to the Y-box of the MDR1 gene promoter was demonstrated in HCT15 and HCT116 cells. Previous reports discussed the DNA double strand-binding protein NF-Y as a potential regulator of MDR1 expression acting via the CCAAT-box (32Sundseth R. MacDonald G. King A.C. Mol. Pharmacol. 1997; 51: 963-971Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). NF-Y was also shown to be involved in mediating effects of several stimuli such as sodium butyrate or UV irradiation (33Jin S. Scotto K.W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 4377-4384Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 34Hu Z. Jin S. Scotto K.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 2979-2985Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). In this study, however, hyperthermia did not alter the binding of NF-Y to the Y-box of the MDR1promoter, suggesting that NF-Y is not involved in hyperthermia-regulated transcriptional control of the MDR1gene. The crucial role of YB-1 in MDR1 regulation was demonstrated by using stably YB-1-transfected HBL-100 cells. In HBL-100/YB-1 cellsMDR1 promoter-driven CAT gene expression was YB-1-dependent. However, YB-1 overexpression resulted in enhanced MRP1 promoter-driven CAT expression levels as well, although no Y-box motif was identified in the human MRP1promoter (27Zhu Q. Center M.S. Cancer Res. 1994; 54: 4488-4492PubMed Google Scholar). This suggested that YB-1 interacts with unknownMRP1 promoter elements. EMSA revealed that YB-1 binds to oligonucleotides derived from the MRP1 promoter fragment J. These oligonucleotides are all very GC-rich (about 80%). The interaction of recombinant YB-1 with similar GC-rich oligonucleotides was described recently (35Izumi H. Imamura T. Nagatani G. Ise T. Murakami T. Uramoto H. Torigoe T. Ishiguchi H. Yoshida Y. Nomoto M. Okamoto T. Uchiumi T. Kuwano M. Funa K Kohno K. Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: 1200-1207Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Therefore we conclude that YB-1 may interact with the MRP1 promoter directly and that the hyperthermia-induced translocation of YB-1 into the nucleus may result in an YB-1-dependent activation of the MRP1promoter. Our data show that after hyperthermia, P-glycoprotein and MRP1 protein levels were strongly up-regulated. It has been previously reported that heat shock activates MDR1 gene expression (12Chin K.V. Tanaka S. Darlington G. Pastan I. Gottesman M.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 221-226Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 13Hever-Szabo A. Pirity M. Szathmari M. Venetianer A. Anticancer Res. 1998; 18: 3045-3048PubMed Google Scholar). Our data provide a mechanism that shows how YB-1 links hyperthermia to gene activation. Furthermore, this is the first report to show that YB-1 is involved in regulating transcription of the MRP1gene. Although several cis elements have been identified in the promoter of the MDR1 gene, which respond to environmental stress (36Kioka N. Yamano Y. Komano T. Ueda K. FEBS Lett. 1992; 301: 37-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar, 37Miyazaki M. Kohno K. Uchiumi T. Tanimura H. Matsuo K. Nasu M. Kuwano M. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

Cancer Lett. 1997; 115: 9-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar), no such elements were detected in theMRP1 promoter (27Zhu Q. Center M.S. Cancer Res. 1994; 54: 4488-4492PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, the observed YB-1 interaction with the MRP1 promoter provides a potential mechanism how environmental stress leads to MRP1 gene activation.

https://openalex.org/W2037250487,"To establish the novel approach in order to distinguish the transcriptionally active androgen receptor (AR) from the transcriptionally inactive AR, we performed the three-dimensional construction of confocal microscopic images of intranuclear AR. This method clearly distinguished the subnuclear localization of transcriptionally active AR tagged with green fluorescent protein (AR-GFP) from the transcriptionally inactive AR-GFP. Transcriptionally active AR-GFP mainly produced 250–400 fluorescence foci in the boundary region between euchromatin and heterochromatin. Although the AR-GFP bound to such antiandrogens as hydroxyflutamide or bicalutamide translocated to the nucleus, they homogeneously spread throughout the nucleus without producing any fluorescence foci. Antiandrogenic environmental disrupting chemicals, such as 1,1-dichloro-2,2-bis(p-chlorophenyl)ethylene, vinclozolin, or nitrofen, also disrupted the intranuclear fluorescence foci. A point mutation (T877A) resulted in the loss of ligand specificity in AR-GFP. Even in this mutant receptor, agonists, such as dihydrotestosterone, hydroxyflutamide, or progesterone, produced the fluorescence foci in the nucleus, whereas the transcriptionally inactive mutant binding bicalutamide was observed to be spread homogeneously in the nucleus. Taken together, our findings suggest that, after nuclear translocation, AR is possibly located in the specific region in the nucleus while demonstrating clustering tightly depending on the agonist-induced transactivation competence.

The primary subcellular localization of ligand-unbound steroid hormone receptors differs among the various family members. For instance, estrogen receptor is located in the nucleus both in ligand-bound forms and in ligand-unbound forms (1Htun H. Holth L.T. Walker D. Davie J.R. Hager G.L. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 471-486Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar), whereas unliganded AR (2Georget V. Lobaccaro J.M. Terouanne B. Mangeat P. Nicolas J.C. Sultan C. Mol. Cell.

After dihydrotestosterone (DHT) binding, AR translocates into the nucleus and then binds to the specific DNA sequences; as a result DHT-bound AR activates the transcription of its target genes. AR plays an essential role during the differentiation of male gonadal tissues, and as a result, mutations in the AR gene may cause infertility in men, the severest form of which is called testicular feminization (6Imasaki K. Hasegawa T. Okabe T. Sakai Y. Haji M. Takayanagi R. Nawata H. Eur. J. Endocrinol. 1994; 130: 569-574Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar, 7McPhaul M.J. J. Steroid Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1999; 69: 315-322Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). In addition, recent evidence suggests that some abnormalities in the male reproductive system are also mediated via AR (8Kelce W.R. Wilson E.M. J. Mol. Med. 1997; 75: 198-207Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar). Chemicals synthesized for herbicides or insecticides, such as vinclozolin or 1,1-dichloro-2,2-bis(p-chlorophenyl)ethylene (p,p′-DDE), are known to act as antiandrogenic endocrine-disrupting chemicals and thus have been suspected to be a cause of infertility in wildlife (9Kelce W.R. Gray L.E. Wilson E.M. Reprod. Fertil. Dev. 1998; 10: 105-111Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). AR is also involved in the proliferation of some androgen-dependent tumors, the most well known of which is prostatic cancer (10Cude K.J. Dixon S.C. Guo Y. Lisella J. Figg W.D. J. Mol. Med. 1999; 77: 419-426Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 11Jenster G. Semin. Oncol. 1999; 26: 407-421PubMed Google Scholar). Many synthetic compounds have been made which either stimulate or antagonize the transactivation functions of nuclear receptors. Among these, nonsteroidal hydroxyflutamide (OHF) and bicalutamide (CAS) specifically suppress the androgen-dependent transactivation function of AR by the competitive binding to the hormone binding domain of AR (12Kemppainen J.A. Wilson E.M. Urology. 1996; 48: 157-163Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). They are called pure antiandrogens and are currently widely used for the treatment of patients with the advanced prostatic cancers (13Neri R. Florance K. Koziol P. van Cleave S. Endocrinology. 1972; 91: 427-437Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar, 14Furr B.J. Horm. Res. (Basel). 1989; 32: 69-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). AR found in the advanced or metastasized prostatic cancer cells have sometimes been shown to harbor mutations that result in the amino acid substitutions in the receptor (15Taplin M.E. Bubley G.J. Shuster T.D. Frantz M.E. Spooner A.E. Ogata G.K. Keer H.N. Balk S.P. N. Engl. J. Med. 1995; 332: 1393-1398Crossref PubMed Scopus (1037) Google Scholar). Among these, the AR in LNCaP cells, established from the metastatic prostate cancer cells, harbors a point mutation that causes a substitution of threonine residue at codon 877 to alanine (T877A), which thus results in the loss of ligand specificity. The mutated AR (AR(T877A)) that binds to OHF paradoxically stimulates the proliferation of the LNCaP cells (16Veldscholte J. Ris-Stalpers C. Kuiper G.G. Jenster G. Berrevoets C. Claassen E. van Rooij H.C. Trapman J. Brinkmann A.O. Mulder E. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1990; 173: 534-540Crossref PubMed Scopus (856) Google Scholar). We established a three-dimensional image analysis to characterize the images of the cells treated with chemicals possessing either an androgenic or antiandrogenic action. The images were collected using confocal laser scanning microscopy, from the living cells treated with natural steroids, pure antiandrogens for the treatment of prostatic cancers, and possible antiandrogenic chemicals. This approach allowed us to visualize the spatial interrelations of AR with the chromatin structures stained with DNA dye, and has proven to be a useful approach for screening antiandrogenic chemicals devoid of disadvantages promoting the antiandrogen withdrawal syndrome. Natural steroids and all chemicals except for OHF and CAS were purchased from Wako Pure Chemical Industries, Ltd. (Osaka, Japan), according to the guidelines of the company and the Ministry of International Trade and Industry. OHF or CAS were kindly provided by the Teikoku Zouki, Co. (Tokyo, Japan). COS-7 cells were obtained from the Riken Cell Bank (Tokyo), and human prostatic cancer cell lines LNCaP (17Horoszewicz J.S. Leong S.S. Kawinski E. Karr J.P. Rosenthal H. Chu T.M. Mirand E.A.

Urol. 1979; 17: 16-23PubMed Google Scholar) were obtained from American Type Culture Collection, and ALVA-41 and ALVA-101 (20Plymate S.R. Loop S.M. Hoop R.C. Wiren K.M. Ostenson R. Hryb D.J. Rosner W. J. Steroid Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1991; 40: 833-839Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar) were kindly provided by Dr. Naitoh (Kyusyu University). All cells were maintained in DMEM (Life Technologies, Inc.), supplemented with 10% FBS, 2 mml-glutamine. The cells were grown in 75-cm2flasks at 37 °C in 5% CO2. For the transfection experiments, cells were inoculated in 12-well plates for 16 h before the transfection and were grown in DMEM with 10% dextran/charcoal-treated FBS. The firefly luciferase reporter plasmid (pGL3-MMTV) was constructed by inserting the MMTV-long terminal repeat promoter sequence, obtained from pMAM vector (CLONTECH), into a pGL3-basic vector (Promega). The construction of a pCMVAR-H, which expressed full-length human AR, has been reported previously by us (21Nakao R. Haji M. Yanase T. Ogo A. Takayanagi R. Katsube T. Fukumaki Y. Nawata H. J. Clin. Endocrinol. & Metab. 1992; 74: 1152-1157Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). With the polymerase chain reaction technique using pCMVAR-H as a template, the NotI restriction site was created at the authentic stop codon, and then the site was blunt-ended. The NheI/blunt-ended NotI fragment was ligated in frame to the NheI/SmaI site in the pEGFP-N2 (CLONTECH) and thus generated a vector expressing for AR-GFP in which GFP sequence was fused to the C terminus of the AR sequence. Mutated AR(T877A) sequence was amplified by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction using RNAs from LNCaP cells. The vector expressing AR(T877A)-GFP was created using the same methods as those mentioned above. The validity of the plasmid constructs was confirmed by both nucleotide sequencing and Western blot. Western blotting was performed using rabbit polyclonal antibody, AR(N-20), raised against mouse AR (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), or a rabbit polyclonal antibody against GFP (CLONTECH). COS-7 cells, which lack endogenous AR, were used for the functional assays. 2 × 105 cells/well were transfected using 3 µg/well LipofectAMINE (Life Technologies, Inc.) with 0.5 µg/well pGL3-MMTV (Promega), 3 ng/well pRL (Renilla luciferase)-CMV (Promega) as an internal control, and 0.1 µg/well expression vector for AR- or AR(T877A)-GFP. Five hours posttransfection, 0.5 ml of DMEM, containing 10% dextran/charcoal-treated FBS, with or without DHT, 17β-estradiol, progesterone, OHF, CAS, or 49 chemicals candidates for the endocrine disrupters, at the indicated concentrations, was added. At 48 h posttransfection, the cells were lysed in Lysis Buffer for a luciferase assay (Promega). The reporter gene activities were determined using a Wallac ARVO.SX 1420 Multilabel Counter (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and were expressed as values normalized by pRL-induced activities, i.e. (firefly luciferase activity)/(Renilla luciferase activity). All experiments were repeated at least twice. The data are presented as the means ± S.D. The cells were divided into 35-mm glass-bottom dishes (MatTek Corporation) and then were transfected with 0.5 µg of the plasmids using 2.5 µl/dish of Superfect reagents (Qiagen). Six to 18 h posttransfection, the culture medium was replaced with a fresh DMEM. At first, the cells were scanned without any hormone treatment, and then the hormones or chemicals were added. One hour after adding the chemicals, they were scanned using confocal laser scanning microscopy (Leica TCS-SP system, Leica Microsystems, Heidelberg, Germany). The cells were imaged for green fluorescence by excitation with the 488 nm line from an argon laser, and the emission was viewed through a 496–505 nm band pass filter. A series of 30–50 images were collected for each single nucleus. The nuclei were stained with Hoechst 33342 (2 µg/ml) and were imaged by excitation with the 350 nm line from a UV laser, and the emission was viewed through a 400–450 nm band pass filter. The two-dimensional tomographic images taken by the confocal microscope were reconstructed using the three-dimensional analysis TRI Graphics Program software package (Ratoc System Engineering, Tokyo) on a Dell computer. cDNA fragment containing the entire sequence of human AR, either wild-type or the mutant in LNCaP cells, was ligated to the 5′-end of pEGFP for generating pAR-GFP or pAR(T877A)-GFP. These plasmids were transiently transfected into COS-7 cells to express the fusion proteins, AR-GFP and AR(T877A)-GFP, respectively. Within 3 h posttransfection, the fluorescence was detected in the cytoplasm. A Western blot analysis using the transfected cellular lysates probed with antiserum against GFP (Fig.1a) or AR (Fig. 1 b) revealed the single band corresponding to the AR-GFP or AR(T877A)-GFP, which migrated at the expected molecular weight (128 kDa). In a separate experiment, we also created a plasmid construct encoding the 5′-GFP-AR-3′ fusion protein, in which AR was fused to at 3′-end of GFP. The subcellular distribution of 5′-GFP-AR-3′ was not consistent,i.e. the fluorescence of the unliganded receptor was either cytoplasmic, nuclear, or both. When the COS-7 cellular lysates containing the 5′-GFP-AR-3′ was probed with anti-GFP antiserum, several signals migrating faster than the expected molecular weight were observed (data not shown). To rule out the possibility that the observed fluorescence signals from the expressed 5′-GFP-AR-3′ indeed represented the prematurely terminated proteins, we used pAR-GFP or pAR(T877A)-GFP for the subsequent experiments. COS-7 cells, transiently transfected with pAR-GFP together with pGL3MMTV-luc, were treated with various concentrations of DHT (10−11 to 10−7m) for 48 h. The DHT-dependent transactivation capacity of AR-GFP compared with that of AR was ∼50% at 10−8m DHT (Fig.2A). This DHT-dependent transactivation capacity of the AR-GFP was detected in other cell lines, including LNCaP, ALVA-41, ALVA-101, Du145, and PC3 (data not shown). Pure antiandrogen, OHF or CAS, acted as a potent antagonist for AR-GFP, and they thus did not induce any such transactivation (data not shown). Furthermore, the treatment of cells with OHF or CAS in the presence of 10−8m DHT suppressed the transactivation function in a dose-dependent fashion (Fig. 2 B). The point mutation, T877A, has been known to result in the loss of the ligand specificity, namely AR(T877A) binds to progesterone, 17β-estradiol, or OHF, as well as DHT, and thereby activates the AR target genes (16Veldscholte J. Ris-Stalpers C. Kuiper G.G. Jenster G. Berrevoets C. Claassen E. van Rooij H.C. Trapman J. Brinkmann A.O. Mulder E. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 2393-2399Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar). The profiles of ligand-bound transactivation function of AR(T877A)-GFP was assessed using COS-7 cells. The DHT-bound AR(T877A)-GFP activated the reporter gene in a concentration-dependent fashion. Progesterone or OHF acted as an agonist, whereas CAS acted as an antagonist. In contrast, 17β-estradiol did not exert any AR(T877A)-GFP-dependent transactivation (Fig. 2 C). By using two-dimensional confocal laser scanning microscopy, the intranuclear distribution of AR-GFP or AR(T877A)-GFP was visualized in COS-7 cells or in LNCaP, ALVA-41, ALVA-101, DU145, and PC3 (data not shown). In each cell line, unliganded AR-GFP was primarily located in the cytoplasm (Fig. 3, A, C,and E) as described previously (2Georget V. Lobaccaro J.M. Terouanne B. Mangeat P. Nicolas J.C. Sultan C. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 1997; 129: 17-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar), whereas after 10−8m DHT binding, AR-GFP translocated into the nucleus within 1 h, and thereafter produced fluorescence foci (Fig. 3, B, D, and F). In all experiments, the nucleoli demonstrated no fluorescence. When transfected cells were treated with 10−6m OHF or CAS, AR-GFP translocated to the nucleus as well as DHT-bound AR-GFP. However, AR-GFP bound to OHF or CAS did not produce any fluorescence foci, but it was homogeneously distributed in the nucleus as described recently (23Tyagi R.K. Lavrovsky Y. Ahn S.C. Song C.S. Chatterjee B. Roy A.K. Mol. Endocrinol. 2000; 14: 1162-1174Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar) (Fig. 3, G andH). Although the unliganded AR(T877A)-GFP was located in both the cytoplasm and in the nucleus (Fig.4A), AR(T877A)-GFP was exclusively located in the nucleus and thus produced fluorescence foci when transfected cells were treated with DHT, progesterone, or OHF (Fig. 4, B, D, and E). CAS- or 17β-estradiol-bound AR(T877A)-GFP did not make any foci, but it was spread homogeneously in the nucleus (Fig. 4, C andF). As a result, the fluorescence focus formation and the transactivation capacities were closely linked even in AR(T877A)-GFP which had lost the ligand specificity. However, the resolving power of regular confocal images was not sufficient to observe further the spatial interrelation of GFP clusters with the chromatin image.Figure 4Confocal laser microscopy images of AR (T877A)-GFP in the COS-7 cells, with or without ligand bindings.

Bar, 10 µm.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) We obtained 49 chemicals known to possibly act as environmental endocrine disrupters, and we examined the antiandrogenic actions in COS-7 cells, using a luciferase gene as a reporter (data not shown). At 10−6m, 6 chemicals, such as p, p′-DDE, which is a major and persistent metabolite of DDT, vinclozolin, alachlor, metribuzin, bisphenol A (BPA), and nitrofen, suppressed the 10−9m DHT-dependent transactivation by about 50–70% (Fig. 2 D). Similar results were observed in ALVA-41 cells established from human prostatic cancer. Among these 6 chemicals, vinclozolin (24Wong C. Kelce W.R. Sar M. Wilson E.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 19998-20003Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar), p,p′-DDE (25Kelce W.R. Stone C.R. Laws S.C. Gray L.E. Kemppainen J.A. Wilson E.M. Nature. 1995; 375: 581-585Crossref PubMed Scopus (1344) Google Scholar), and BPA (26Sohoni P. Sumpter J.P. J. Endocrinol. 1998; 158: 327-339Crossref PubMed Scopus (731) Google Scholar) were previously reported to be antiandrogenic EDC. However, alachlor, metribuzin, and nitrofen are not known to be antiandrogens. Much evidence has been accumulated suggesting that the chromatin structure is dynamic and tightly linked to the transcriptional activity. Nuclear staining with DNA dyes, such as 4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole or Hoechst 33342, has been used to discriminate the heterochromatin region from the euchromatin region. To clarify further the difference in the intranuclear distribution between the agonist-bound AR and the antagonist-bound AR, we used a novel approach by performing a three-dimensional reconstruction of the confocal images of GFP fluorescence in the nucleus. COS-7 cells transiently transfected with pAR-GFP were treated with 10−8mDHT or 10−6m OHF, and then the nuclei were simultaneously stained with Hoechst 33342. One hour after adding the chemicals and Hoechst 33342, the confocal images were collected using the Leica TCS-SP system. For each confocal image, low brightness noise rejection and median filter processing were carried out in the blue (chromatin) and green (GFP) channels, respectively, then the chromatin and the GFP images were extracted and constructed in three dimensions. For the chromatin images that were stained with Hoechst 33342, less dense areas (namely euchromatin region) were cut off and thus were shown as blank images. With our procedures to construct the three-dimensional images of the nucleus, the GFP images could be observed in high resolution, thus allowing us to observe any spatial interrelations with chromatin structures. The three-dimensional images were constructed for several cells to make sure that closely equivalent green or blue fluorescence volumes were obtained for each cell in each treated group. The final images were then displayed after carrying out the permeability compensation, and brightness, contrast enhancements. The images of GFP and chromatin in the DHT-treated cells (Fig.5, a and b, respectively) were viewed from the surface, and then they were spatially merged (Fig. 5 c). The DHT-bound AR-GFP was distributed almost exclusively in the euchromatin region which is shown as the blank region. In the single nucleus of the DHT-treated cells, about 250–400 bright GFP spots existed as a distinct volume. The tomographic views of the three-dimensional image in DHT-treated cells were displayed in the center on the z axis (Fig.5 d). In this view, it became clear that most of the GFP spots were located in the peripheral zone of the euchromatin region adjacent to the heterochromatin region in which Hoechst 33342 staining was more dominant. In strong contrast to the number of the bright GFP spots (250) in the single nucleus of the DHT-treated cell, the number of GFP spots in the single nucleus of OHF-treated cell was 1 (that is a whole nuclear space is the single volume of GFP after performing low brightness noise rejection), thus further showing GFP to homogeneously distribute in the nucleus without any clustering (Fig. 5 e). Next, to reveal the spatial interrelationship with the chromatin structures in the nucleus of OHF-treated cells, images were displayed as tomographic (Fig. 5 f for GFP, Fig. 5 g for Hoechst 33342, and Fig. 5 h for the merge, respectively). The antagonist-bound AR-GFP was diffusely distributed, except in the nucleolus, thus making a cyan space in which the two fluorescences were mixed. Therefore, the three-dimensional image more clearly distinguished the difference in the intranuclear localization of AR between the agonist-bound and antagonist-bound form than the regular two-dimensional confocal images (compare Fig. 3 and Fig. 5). We thus concluded that it can be applied to the screening of the chemicals possessing the antiandrogenic activities. AR-GFP bound to vinclozolin, p,p′-DDE, or nitrofen translocated to the nucleus, and the intranuclear distribution of such AR-GFPs was homogeneous as observed in the cells treated with OHF or CAS (Fig. 6b–f, Fig.6 a as a control). Furthermore, when the cells were treated with both 10−9m DHT and 10−6m vinclozolin,p,p′-DDE, or nitrofen, the intranuclear GFP cluster formation was strongly disrupted and was also observed against the homogeneous GFP fluorescence background that thus demonstrated diffusely distributed AR-GFP (Fig. 6, g–i). In contrast, the profiles of AR-GFP bound to alachlor, metribuzin, or BPA were different. They did not translocate to the nucleus, and the treatment of cells with 10−6m of these chemicals in the presence of 10−9m DHT revealed preserved DHT-induced fluorescence focus formations in the nucleus (data not shown). In this report, we showed that a three-dimensional image construction approach is sensitive enough to dramatically discriminate the intranuclear distribution of AR between DHT-bound and antiandrogenic chemical-bound forms. The transcriptionally active wild-type glucocorticoid receptor (5Htun H. Barsony J. Renyi I. Gould D.L. Hager G.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Antagonists such as ICI 182780 or hydroxytamoxifen evoke the intranuclear cluster formation of GFP-fused estrogen receptor-α (1Htun H. Holth L.T. Walker D. Davie J.R. Hager G.L. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 471-486Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar). Although Tyagi et al.(23Tyagi R.K. Lavrovsky Y. Ahn S.C. Song C.S. Chatterjee B. Roy A.K. Mol.

As described recently, the profile of the intranuclear distribution of the AR closely agreed with that of glucocorticoid receptor or mineralocorticoid receptor, in that the distribution of the inactive receptor is homogeneous (5Htun H.

This is the first report to demonstrate that the correlation between the intranuclear cluster formation and the transactivation capacities remains even when ligand specificity has been lost. The activation of AR(T877A) by OHF has been attributed to the pathogenesis of “antiandrogen withdrawal syndrome,” in which prostatic tumor cells paradoxically proliferate after treatment with antiandrogens, but the growth is suppressed after the treatment is stopped (29Scher H.I. Kolvenbag G.J. Eur. Urol. 1997; 31 (, 24–27): 3-7Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar, 30Breul J. Paul R. Urology. 1998; 37: 156-158Google Scholar). Unexpectedly, unliganded AR(T877A)-GFP was both cytoplasmic and nuclear. This subcellular localization pattern of the unliganded steroid hormone receptor was reported for vitamin D receptor or mineralocorticoid receptor (27Racz A. Barsony J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 19352-19360Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar, 28Fejes-Toth G. Pearce D. Naray-Fejes-Toth A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 2973-2978Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). The exact mechanism of the subcellular localization of the unliganded AR(T877A)-GFP remains to be elucidated. The exact nature of the fluorescent foci in the nucleus remains to be elucidated. The intranuclear GFP clusters are shown to be detected even in the nuclear matrix preparations after the DNase treatment; therefore, it has been suggested that the clusters are closely related to the nuclear matrix structure itself (23Tyagi R.K.

Recent studies revealed the colocalization of the transcriptionally active nuclear receptor, such as estrogen receptor-α or peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor, with the transcriptional cofactor, SRC-1 (34Stenoien D.L. Mancini M.G. Patel K. Allegretto E.A. Smith C.L. Mancini M.A. Mol. Endocrinol. 2000; 14: 518-534PubMed Google Scholar, 35Llopis J. Westin S. Ricote M. Wang J. Cho C.Y. Kurokawa R. Mullen T.M.

In addition, a negative correlation would be expected between the spatial distribution of GFP-fused mineralocorticoid receptor and 4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole using the fluorescence microscope (28Fejes-Toth G. Pearce D. Naray-Fejes-Toth A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 2973-2978Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). To our knowledge, this is the first detailed report on the spatial distribution of the transcriptionally active steroid hormone receptor tagged with GFP. With the novel approach using the high resolution three-dimensional imaging analysis, we demonstrated from 250 to 400 clusters of transcriptionally active AR to be mainly localized in the peripheral region (adjacent to the heterochromatin) of the transcriptionally active euchromatin. In the nucleus, the chromatin structures are dynamic, and this dynamic structural change is essential for the transcriptional activation mechanisms (36Lamond A.I. Earnshaw W.C. Science. 1998; 280: 547-553Crossref PubMed Scopus (775) Google Scholar). Recently, a transcriptional cofactor, exclusively localized in the euchromatin area, has been identified (37Remboutsika E. Lutz Y. Gansmuller A. Vonesch J.L. Losson R. Chambon P. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 1671-1683Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The cofactor, TIF-1a, is preferentially localized at borders between euchromatin and heterochromatin and is thus suggested to act as a “docking protein” to which liganded nuclear receptors can bind to enhance the efficiency of the transcription by selectively scanning the euchromatin. We have found that a putative cofactor specific to the N-terminal region (AF-1) of AR is crucial to the androgen-specific transactivation mechanism (38Adachi M. Takayanagi R. Tomura A. Imasaki K. Kato S. Goto K. Yanase T. Ikuyama S. Nawata H. N. Engl. J. Med. 2000; 343: 856-862Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). The dynamic change in such chromatin structures may involve the interaction of nuclear matrices with the transcriptional machinery composed of steroid hormone receptor-transcriptional cofactor complex, and the active basal transcriptional machinery, which is bridged by the molecule like a docking protein. The antiandrogenic action of p,p′-DDE is suggested to be mediated through the competitive inhibition of androgen binding of AR and subsequent inhibition of transcription activity (25Kelce W.R. Stone C.R. Laws S.C. Gray L.E. Kemppainen J.A. Wilson E.M. Nature. 1995; 375: 581-585Crossref PubMed Scopus (1344) Google Scholar) and that vinclozolin decreases the DNA binding of the bound AR (24Wong C. Kelce W.R. Sar M. Wilson E.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 19998-20003Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar). We showed that the profiles of the AR binding to such chemicals asp,p′-DDE, vinclozolin, or nitrofen were very similar to those of OHF- or CAS-bound AR. The AR bound to those chemicals translocated into the nucleus but was distributed homogeneously without producing any foci in the nucleus. Furthermore, a high resolution three-dimensional image analysis clearly showed that when those antiandrogenic chemicals were added in the presence of DHT, the intranuclear GFP cluster formation was strongly disrupted even for nitrofen. Nitrofen was originally synthesized as a herbicide; however, it is no longer on the market now because of its suspected carcinogenicity (39Hurt S.S. Smith J.M. Hayes A.W. Toxicology. 1983; 29: 1-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). It is also suspected that nitrofen contamination during pregnancy may cause the congenital diaphragmatic hernia or anomalies of the great vessels in newborns (40Greer J.J. Allan D.W. Babiuk R.P. Lemke R.P. Pediatr. Pulmonol. 2000; 29: 394-399Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Recent studies revealed lung hypoplasia, caused by nitrofen, also to be mediated by the down-regulation of the thyroid transcription factor TTF-1 mRNA (41Losada A. Xia H. Migliazza L. Diez-Pardo J.A. Santisteban P. Tovar J.A. Pediatr. Surg. Int. 1999; 15: 188-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Although its antiandrogenic action was relatively weak in comparison to either p,p′-DDE or vinclozolin, the three-dimensional imaging techniques clearly showed the images characteristic to the pure antiandrogens such as OHF or CAS. Limitations of this high resolution three-dimensional image analysis were found for such antiandrogenic chemicals as alachlor, metribuzin, and BPA. These chemicals neither caused the nuclear translocation of AR nor disrupted the DHT-induced intranuclear cluster formation of the AR. Further studies are called for to clarify the mechanisms of the actions for these chemicals, since they might affect the posttranscriptional levels such as mRNA stability. In summary, we suggest that the mechanism of the action of antiandrogenic chemicals is a more complex action than the simple competitive binding to AR. The high resolution three-dimensional image analysis of the intranuclear cluster formation of AR in the living cell is a very sensitive and a useful method for the screening of the antiandrogenic chemicals. We thank Mitoshi Toki for valuable technical assistance in performing the three-dimensional imaging analysis."

Critical genes in the apoptotic process have been identified and include the Bcl-2 family of proteins (1Kroemer G. Nat. Med. 1997; 3: 614-620Crossref PubMed Scopus (1706) Google Scholar), as well as a family of cysteine proteases known as caspases, which specifically cleave their substrates at aspartic acid residues (2Wolf B. Green D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 20049-20052Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (861) Google Scholar). Apoptosis is initiated either by ligand binding to cell surface receptors or by cell toxins via a pathway that targets the mitochondria (3Sun X.-M. MacFarlane M. Zhuang J. Wolf B.B. Green D.R. Cohen G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 5053-5060Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (780) Google Scholar). In the receptor-mediated pathway, ligand binding to the tumor necrosis factor (TNF)α/FAS family of receptors results in activation of the initiator caspase, caspase 8. Active caspase-8 then activates downstream “effector” caspases such as 3, 6, and 7, which cleave cell proteins ultimately resulting in DNA fragmentation and cell death.The mitochondrial-dependent apoptotic pathway is induced by agents such as drugs, chemicals, irradiation, and some types of cell stress. Although the specific cell signals delivered by these agents differ, all appear to converge at the mitochondria resulting in the release of cytochrome c, activation of the initiator caspase, caspase-9, and the subsequent activation of downstream caspases. How many diverse signals initiate this common pathway is not known. One possibility is that specific protein kinase cascades may function to integrate these signals upstream of the mitochondria. In line with this, recent evidence implicates specific serine/threonine protein kinases as regulators of apoptosis. These include the phosphoinositide 3-kinase/AKT pathway (4Kennedy S.G. Wagner A.J.

Interestingly, although PKCδ has been shown to contribute to phorbol ester-induced apoptosis, caspase cleavage of PKCδ does not occur under these conditions, suggesting a role for the uncleaved form of PKCδ in apoptosis (9Fujii T. Garcia-Bermejo M.L. Bernabo J.L. Caamano J. Ohba M. Kuroki T. Li L. Yuspa S.H. Kazanietz M.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 7574-7582Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar).We have previously shown that activation of PKC by phorbol ester is sufficient to induce an apoptotic program in parotid salivary acinar cells (10Reyland M. Barzen K. Anderson S. Quissell D. Matassa A. Cell Death Differ. 2000; 7: 1200-1209Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar) and that PKCδ is essential for genotoxin-induced cell death (11Reyland M. Anderson S. Matassa A. Barzen K. Quissell D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 11915-11923Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (230) Google Scholar). Here we demonstrate that expression of a dominant inhibitory form of PKCδ from an adenoviral vector is sufficient to suppress apoptosis in parotid cells in response to diverse stimuli and that PKCδ is required for loss of mitochondrial membrane potential in apoptotic cells. This argues that PKCδ is important for the integration of diverse death signals at or prior to their convergence at the mitochondria.DISCUSSIONMany chemicals and drugs induce apoptosis through a mitochondrial-dependent mechanism. However, how these diverse signals are integrated is not known. The data presented here indicate that PKCδ is a required intermediate in the apoptotic pathway induced by agents that cause DNA damage (etoposide; UV) as well as toxins that target the Golgi (brefeldin A) and microtubule network (taxol). Although all agents required PKCδ for a maximal apoptotic response, the dependence on PKCδ for apoptosis induced by UV and brefeldin A was slightly greater than for taxol and etoposide for all apoptotic parameters assayed. This suggests that whereas PKCδ functions as a common integrator of these apoptotic signals, alternative pathways also exist to integrate apoptotic signals initiated by specific types of cell damage. In this regard, etoposide has been reported to induce two distinct pathways of apoptosis: a caspase-dependent pathway at low doses (10 µm) and a caspase-independent pathway at higher doses (>25 µm) (42Robertson J.D. Gogvadze V. Zhivotovsky B. Orrenius S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 32438-32443Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). The less efficient inhibition of etoposide-induced apoptosis by PKCδKD may indicate that PKCδ is required for one but not both of these pathways. For all agents except etoposide, upstream events in the apoptotic pathway, such as loss of MMP and activation of caspase-9-like protease, were inhibited to a greater extent than downstream events such as caspase-3 activation and DNA fragmentation. This suggests that PKCδ is required for regulation of a key early component(s) in the apoptotic pathway and functions at, or prior to, the mitochondria.Previous studies showing a requirement for PKCδ for apoptosis have relied heavily, but not exclusively, on the use of rottlerin to inhibit PKCδ. A recent publication by Davies et al. (44Davies S.P. Reddy H. Caivano M. Cohen P. Biochem. J. 2000; 351: 95-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (3917) Google Scholar) however indicates that rotterlin does not inhibit PKCδ in vitro, bringing into question reports by Gschwendt et al. (45Gschwendt M. Muller H.-J. Kielbassa K. Zang R. Kittstein W. Rincke G. Marks F. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 199: 93-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (757) Google Scholar) and Keenan et al. (46Keenan C. Goode N. Pears C. FEBS Lett. 1997; 415: 101-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar), which demonstrate specific inhibition of PKCδ by rottlerin. Thus alternative inhibitory strategies are required to verify the role of PKCδ in apoptosis. Our current studies, which use a kinase-dead mutant of PKCδ to inhibit endogenous PKCδ activity, provide independent verification of the importance of PKCδ as a regulator of apoptosis. This approach has been used extensively to inhibit the activity of protein kinases; however, pitfalls include a potential lack of specificity, as well as the possibility that the subcellular localization of the kinase may be altered because of the mutation and/or overexpression. To address the issue of specificity, we have shown that inhibition is specific for PKCδ, as expression of PKCαKD does not inhibit etoposide-induced apoptosis. Likewise, preliminary experiments using PKCζKD also show no inhibition of apoptosis. 3R. Bell and M. E. Reyland, unpublished data.Furthermore, as expected, expression of PKCδWT has the opposite effect of PKCδKD, i.e. it is an inducer of apoptosis. Expression of PKCδKD can block apoptosis induced by overexpression of PKCδWT, indicating that PKCδWT is a target of PKCδKD. Inhibition of apoptosis with PKCδKD increased in a dose dependent manner when the kinase-dead mutant was expressed in the range of 5–30-fold over endogenous PKCδ (MOI of 25–250). Whereas it is not clear why such high ratios of kinase-dead to endogenous PKCδ are required, one possibility, not addressed in the current manuscript, is that some/much of the overexpressed protein does not localize to the correct subcellular localization, and hence is not available to suppress the biological effect being assayed.PKCδ is proteolytically activated by caspase-3 in response to many agents that induce mitochondrial-dependent apoptosis, including the agents utilized in these studies. Whereas caspase cleavage and activation of PKCδ clearly contributes to apoptosis in many cells, our data are also consistent with a role for PKCδ in apoptosis prior to caspase cleavage and activation. First, PKCδ is required for mitochondrial membrane depolarization, a process that we show here to be caspase-independent in parotid C5 cells. Second, expression of PKCδKD inhibits activation of both initiator (caspase-9) and effector (caspase-3) caspases. Third, whereas induction of apoptosis by PKCδWT is accompanied by cleavage of PKCδ in cells which express PKCδKD no cleavage of PKCδ is seen. This suggests that the kinase function of PKCδ is required for activation of a pathway, which subsequently mediates caspase activation. However, expression of the caspase-cleavage fragment of PKCδ is sufficient to induce apoptosis in many cells, including parotid C5 cells,2 suggesting that both full-length and caspase-cleaved PKCδ contribute to the apoptotic program. One explanation is that the function of the activated full-length and caspase-cleaved forms of PKCδ are the same, with caspase cleavage simply being a more efficient method of activating the kinase. In this paradigm, caspase cleavage would serve to amplify the PKCδ signal in apoptotic cells. In support of this is the demonstration from our laboratory and Fujii et al. that caspase cleavage of PKCδ is not required for phorbol ester-induced apoptosis, and that phorbol ester is a much weaker inducer of apoptosis than agents that induce PKCδ cleavage (9Fujii T. Garcia-Bermejo M.L. Bernabo J.L. Caamano J. Ohba M. Kuroki T. Li L. Yuspa S.H. Kazanietz M.G. J. Biol.

Chem. 1999; 274: 11915-11923Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (230) Google Scholar). Alternatively, it is tempting to speculate that either changes in conformation or subcellular localization may result in the regulation of targets specific for the caspase-cleaved form of PKCδ. Thus the functions of full-length and caspase-cleaved PKCδ may be distinct, with full-length PKCδ regulating an early event(s) and the caspase-cleaved form of PKCδ regulating a later event(s) in the apoptotic pathway. Consistent with this possibility is the observation that PKCδ translocates to specific sites following induction of apoptosis (16Majumder P.K. Pandey P. Sun X. Cheng K. Datta R. Saxena S.

Immunol. 1999; 29: 2603-2612Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar).It should be noted that expression of PKCδKD did not totally inhibit apoptosis in response to any agent tested. Because PKCδKD is thought to function as a competitive inhibitor of endogenous PKCδ, it is possible that we cannot achieve the level of expression of the inhibitory protein required to completely suppress the function of the endogenous kinase (28Li W., Yu, J.-C. Shin D.-Y. Pierce J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 8311-8318Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). In addition it is likely that other regulatory signals contribute to the induction and/or amplification of apoptosis by these agents. In particular, members of the mitogen-activated protein kinase/extracellular-regulated kinase family have been shown to regulate apoptosis (6Seimiya H. Mashima T. Toho M. Tsuruo T. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 4631-4636Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar, 7Frasch S.C. Nick J.A. Fadok V.A. Bratton D.L. Worthen G.S. Henson P.M. J. Biol.

Biol. 1997; 17: 24-35Crossref PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar). In addition, the caspase cleavage and constitutive activation of other protein kinases such as MEKK-1, MST1, PAK-2, FAK have also been shown to contribute to apoptosis as does caspase cleavage and inactivation of enzymes required for DNA repair (48Utz P. Anderson P. Cell Death Differ. 2000; 7: 589-602Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar, 49Widmann C. Gibson S. Johnson G.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 7141-7147Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar).Our studies suggest that PKCδ functions at, or prior to, the mitochondria in apoptotic cells, and that overexpression of PKCδWT is sufficient to induce apoptosis. This is consistent with a recent report from Li et al. (18Li L. Lorenzo P. Bogi K. Blumberg P. Yuspa S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 8547-8558Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) in which phorbol ester treatment of keratinocytes which overexpress PKCδWT induced apoptosis. In this study apoptosis correlated with translocation of PKCδWT, but not PKCδKD to the mitochondria, suggesting that mitochondrial localization of PKCδ facilitates apoptosis (16Majumder P.K.

Whereas our studies are consistent with the hypothesis that PKCδ regulates mitochondrial events in apoptosis, they do not address whether this is a direct effect at the level of the mitochondria or an indirect effect perhaps via regulation of another component of the apoptotic pathway. Notably, the nuclear proteins DNA-PK (50Bharti A. Kraeft S.-K. Gounder M. Pandey P. Jin S. Yuan Z.-M. Lees-Miller S.P. Weichselbaum R. Weaver D. Chen L.B. Kufe D. Kharbanda S. Mol. Cell.

Oncogene. 2000; 4: 2331-2337Crossref Scopus (197) Google Scholar) are reported to be substrates for PKCδ in apoptotic cells and Scheel-Toellner et al. (47Scheel-Toellner D. Pilling D. Akbar A.N. Hardie D. Lombardi G. Salmon M. Lord J.M. Eur. J. Immunol. 1999; 29: 2603-2612Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar) show translocation of PKCδ to the nucleus in T cells treated with IFN-β to induce apoptosis (47Scheel-Toellner D. Pilling D.

Future studies directed at identifying substrates of PKCδ in apoptotic cells will greatly enhance our understanding of the function of this essential signaling pathway. Apoptosis is a genetically regulated form of cell death that plays a critical role in the destruction of unwanted cells such as tumor cells and cells damaged by viral infection, drugs, chemical radiation, and aging. Critical genes in the apoptotic process have been identified and include the Bcl-2 family of proteins (1Kroemer G. Nat. Med. 1997; 3: 614-620Crossref PubMed Scopus (1706) Google Scholar), as well as a family of cysteine proteases known as caspases, which specifically cleave their substrates at aspartic acid residues (2Wolf B. Green D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 20049-20052Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (861) Google Scholar). Apoptosis is initiated either by ligand binding to cell surface receptors or by cell toxins via a pathway that targets the mitochondria (3Sun X.-M. MacFarlane M. Zhuang J. Wolf B.B. Green D.R. Cohen G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 5053-5060Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (780) Google Scholar). In the receptor-mediated pathway, ligand binding to the tumor necrosis factor (TNF)α/FAS family of receptors results in activation of the initiator caspase, caspase 8. Active caspase-8 then activates downstream “effector” caspases such as 3, 6, and 7, which cleave cell proteins ultimately resulting in DNA fragmentation and cell death. The mitochondrial-dependent apoptotic pathway is induced by agents such as drugs, chemicals, irradiation, and some types of cell stress. Although the specific cell signals delivered by these agents differ, all appear to converge at the mitochondria resulting in the release of cytochrome c, activation of the initiator caspase, caspase-9, and the subsequent activation of downstream caspases. How many diverse signals initiate this common pathway is not known. One possibility is that specific protein kinase cascades may function to integrate these signals upstream of the mitochondria. In line with this, recent evidence implicates specific serine/threonine protein kinases as regulators of apoptosis. These include the phosphoinositide 3-kinase/AKT pathway (4Kennedy S.G. Wagner A.J.

https://openalex.org/W2318252390,"The disruption of mitochondrial function is a key component of apoptosis in most cell types. Localization of Bcl-2 to the outer mitochondrial and endoplasmic reticulum membranes is consistent with a role in the inhibition of many forms of apoptosis. In Rat-1 cells, a Bcl-2 mutant targeted exclusively to the endoplasmic reticulum (Bcl-cb5) was effective at inhibiting apoptosis induced by serum starvation/myc, or ceramide but not apoptosis induced by etoposide. The former conditions cause a decrease in mitochondrial transmembrane potential (Deltapsi(m)) as an early event that precedes the release of cytochrome c from mitochondria. By contrast, when cells are exposed to etoposide, a situation in which cytochrome c release and membrane localization of the pro-apoptotic protein Bax precede loss of Deltapsi(m), wild type Bcl-2 but not Bcl-cb5 prevents apoptosis. Therefore, Bcl-2 functions in spatially distinct pathways of apoptosis distinguished by the order of cytochrome c release and loss of Deltapsi(m)."

Apoptosis pathways triggered by ionizing radiation (XRT) and the death ligand TRAIL were analysed in Jurkat lymphoma cells. Both induced the activation of caspase-8, caspase-3, BID and mitochondrial potential loss. TRAIL induced apoptosis required caspase-8, whereas it was not essential for radiation induced apoptosis. The inhibition of mitochondrial damage by Bcl-2 abrogated XRT induced apoptosis and caspase activation, but only marginally attenuated TRAIL induced cell death. The combined treatment with TRAIL and XRT exerted additive apoptotic effects in control cells, whereas highly synergistic effects occurred in cells overexpressing Bcl-2. In addition, a strong effect of TRAIL on radiation induced clonogenic cell death was found. In conclusion, TRAIL seems to be of high potential value for a combination with ionizing radiation in tumor therapy."

Paradoxically, several of these agents also induce the anti-apoptotic transcription factor NF-κB. In this report, we demonstrate that NF-κB inhibits GADD153 activation in breast cancer cells exposed to nutrient deprived media, tunicamycin (which blocks protein folding in ER) or calcium ionopore (which depletes calcium stores in ER). Basal and calcium ionopore-induced GADD153 expression was more pronounced in fibroblasts obtained from mouse embryos lacking in p65 subunit of NF-κB compared to fibroblasts from wild type littermate embryos. Moreover, p65−/− fibroblasts were killed more efficiently by calcium ionopore and tunicamycin but not hydrogen peroxide compared to wild type fibroblasts. We also show that parthenolide, a NF-κB inhibitor, sensitizes breast cancer cells to tunicamycin. Transient transfection assay revealed that the p65 subunit but not the p50 subunit of NF-κB represses GADD153 promoter activity. These results establish a correlation between repression of pro-apoptotic genes by NF-κB and increased cell survival during ER stress as well as identify a distinct NF-κB regulated cell survival pathway."
https://openalex.org/W2320782426,"The hallmark of Burkitt lymphoma (BL) is a constitutively activated c-myc gene that drives tumor cell growth. A majority of BL-derived cell lines also carry mutant p53. In addition, the p16INK4a promoter is hypermethylated in most BL biopsies and BL cell lines, leading to silencing of this gene. Activation of c-myc and/or cell cycle dysregulation can induce ARF expression and p53-dependent apoptosis. We therefore investigated the p14ARF-MDM2-p53 pathway in BL cell lines. p14ARF was expressed and localized to nucleoli in all BL carrying mutant p53. Three out of seven BL carrying wt p53 had a homozygous deletion of the CDKN2A locus that encodes both p14ARF and p16INK4a. Three BL carrying wild type p53 retained the CDKN2A locus and overexpressed MDM2. DNA sequencing revealed a point mutation in CDKN2A exon 2 in one of these BL, Seraphine. However, this point mutation did not affect p14ARF's nucleolar localization or ability to induce p53. The Bmi-1 protein that negatively regulates the p14ARF promoter and co-operates with c-myc in tumorigenesis was expressed at low to moderate levels in all BL analysed. Our results indicate that inactivation of the ARF-MDM2-p53 pathway is an essential step during the development of Burkitt lymphoma, presumably as a mechanism to escape c-myc induced apoptosis."
https://openalex.org/W2331262097,"Vitronectin (VN) and pro-urokinase (pro-uPA) stimulated migration of rat smooth muscle cells in a dose-dependent and additive way, and induced motile-type changes in cell morphology together with a complete reorganization of the actin filaments and of the microtubules. All these effects were inhibited by pertussis toxin, or by antibodies directed against the urokinase receptor (uPAR) or against the VN receptor alpha(v)beta(3) suggesting that an association between the two receptors is required to mediate both signals. Investigation of the signaling pathways showed that increasing the intracellular cAMP resulted in a selective inhibition of VN-induced cell migration. On the other hand, PD 98059, an inhibitor of MEK, differentially inhibited the pro-uPA- but not the VN-induced cell migration. Phosphorylation and nuclear translocation of Erk by pro-uPA was directly observed. We conclude that the signaling pathways of pro-uPA and VN must be at least in part different."

In mast cells, however, IL-15 uses a distinct receptor system different from that used in T and NK cells. We recently reported that IL-15 induces STAT6 activation and IL-4 production in a mouse mast cell line (MC/9) and bone marrow-derived mast cells. In the present study, we have demonstrated that IL-15 prevents MC/9 and bone marrow-derived mast cell apoptosis induced by factor withdrawal or anti-Fas antibody treatment. IL-15 increased mRNA and protein levels of an anti-apoptotic protein (Bcl-xL) in these cells, whereasbcl-2 mRNA remained unchanged. In addition, the transcriptional activity of the bcl-x L promoter was increased by IL-15 in MC/9 cells. In an electrophoretic mobility shift assay, IL-15 induced STAT6 binding to the STAT recognition site in thebcl-x L gene promoter. Furthermore, the expression of a dominant-negative form of STAT6 abrogated the effects of IL-15 on both bcl-x L mRNA up-regulation and prevention of apoptosis in mast cells. Altogether, our results suggest that IL-15 plays an important role in maintaining the number of mast cells through Bcl-xL expression mediated by STAT6.

Thus, the number of mast cells needs to be tightly controlled by cell proliferation, development, and death. Several factors have been described to induce mast cell proliferation and maturation (1Tsai M. Takeishi T. Thompson H. Langley K.E. Zsebo K.M. Metcalfe D.D. Geissler E.N. Galli S.J. Proc. Natl. Acad.

As for cell death mechanisms, deprivation of interleukin (IL)1-3 or stem cell factor has been demonstrated to induce apoptosis in mast cells (3Mekori Y.A. Oh C.K. Metcalfe D.D. J.

Furthermore, mast cells express Fas antigen and variably undergo apoptosis when stimulated with some anti-Fas antibodies (8Hartmann K. Wagelie-Steffen A.L. von Stebut E. Metcalfe D.D. J. Immunol. 1997; 159: 4006-4014PubMed Google Scholar), indicating that mast cell numbers in vivomay be regulated not only by growth factors, but also by cell death in the Fas-dependent pathway (8Hartmann K. Wagelie-Steffen A.L. von Stebut E. Metcalfe D.D. J. Immunol. 1997; 159: 4006-4014PubMed Google Scholar). IL-15 is a member of the cytokine family with T and NK cell growth-promoting activity (9Bamford R.N. Grant A.J. Burton J.D. Peters C. Kurys G. Goldman C.K. Brennan J. Roessler E. Waldmann T.A. Proc.

Among a variety of cytokines involved in this activity, IL-2 plays a pivotal role through a receptor system composed of at least three polypeptide chains known as the IL-2 receptor (IL-2R) α, β, and γc chains for their signal transduction (11Minami Y. Kono T. Miyazaki T. Taniguchi T. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1993; 11: 245-268Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In T and NK cells, IL-15 and IL-2 share IL-2Rβ and IL-2Rγc (9Bamford R.N. Grant A.J. Burton J.D.

The IL-2R α-subunit is a private receptor used by IL-2, but not by IL-15. IL-15, on the other hand, utilizes the IL-15-specific receptor subunit, IL-15Rα (13Giri J.G. Kumaki S. Ahdieh M. Friend D.J.

Although mast cells lack IL-2Rβ and do not respond to IL-2, they proliferate in response to IL-15. Mast cells express a novel 60–65-kDa IL-15R molecule, designated IL-15RX (17Tagaya Y. Burton J.D. Miyamoto Y. Waldmann T.A. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 4928-4939Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). IL-15 activates Jak2 and STAT5 or Tyk2 and STAT6 in mast cell lines, instead of Jak1/3 and STAT3/5, which are activated by the IL-2R/IL-15R system in T cells (17Tagaya Y. Burton J.D. Miyamoto Y.

Chem. 2000; 275: 29331-29337Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar), other effects of IL-15 on mast cell functions remain largely unknown. Among STAT proteins, STAT6 was first isolated as a protein tyrosine-phosphorylated in response to IL-4 stimulation (19Hou J. Schindler U. Henzel W.J. Ho T.C. Brasseur M. McKnight S.L. Science. 1994; 265: 1701-1706Crossref PubMed Scopus (726) Google Scholar). STAT6 has been demonstrated to play a critical role in the IL-4-mediated Th2 response based on analyses of STAT6-deficient mouse models (20Takeda K. Tanaka T. Shi W. Matsumoto M. Minami M.

Immunity. 1996; 4: 313-319Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1328) Google Scholar). IL-4 also inhibits apoptosis of T cells at least partly due to the induction of Bcl-xL, an anti-apoptotic member of the Bcl-2 protein family. STAT6, however, seemed unnecessary for the anti-apoptotic effects of IL-4 (22Vella A. Teague T.K. Ihle J. Kappler J. Marrack P. J. Exp. Med. 1997; 186: 325-330Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar). Although Bcl-xL is induced by the activation of some STAT proteins (STAT1, STAT3, and STAT5) by direct binding to a consensus sequence in thebcl-x gene promoter (23Silva M. Benito A. Sanz C.

In this study, we analyzed the effects of IL-15 on mast cell proliferation and survival. We have shown that although IL-15 alone does not induce mast cell proliferation, it synergizes with IL-3 in the increase in the number of MC/9 and bone marrow-derived mast cells (BMMCs). We have also demonstrated that IL-15 induces Bcl-xL expression and prevents apoptosis of the mast cell line MC/9 induced by either factor deprivation or Fas stimulation. Upon activation by IL-15 treatment, STAT6 bound to the STAT-binding site in the bcl-x gene promoter and seemed be responsible for the transcriptional activation of the bcl-x promoter. Additionally, the expression of a C-terminally truncated dominant-negative form of STAT6 significantly suppressed thebcl-x L mRNA up-regulation and prevention of apoptosis mediated by IL-15, suggesting that STAT6 activation is essential for the IL-15-mediated anti-apoptotic effect. Recombinant human IL-15 and mouse IL-3 were purchased from Peprotech Corp. (Seattle, WA). RPMI 1640 medium was from Life Technologies, Inc. Fetal calf serum (FCS) was purchased from Sigma. The anti-Bcl-xL and anti-Bcl-2 polyclonal antibodies were purchased from Calbiochem. The anti-mouse Fas monoclonal antibody (jo2) and the neutralizing anti-IL-4 antibody (rat IgG1, 11B11) were purchased from Pharmingen (San Diego, CA). The anti-ERK-1 and anti-STAT6 polyclonal antibodies were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA). All cell lines were grown in tissue culture flasks at 37 °C in 5% CO2 and 95% air and passaged every 2 or 3 days to maintain logarithmic growth. The MC/9 mouse mast cell line was obtained from American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA). The cells were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium containing 10% FCS, 20 µm 2-mercaptoethanol, 10% WEHI-3-conditioned medium as a source for IL-3, and 10% mouse spleen-conditioned medium with concanavalin A. BMMCs were derived from femoral bone marrow cells of 6-week-old BALB/c mice. After 3 weeks of culture with 10% WEHI-3-conditioned medium, the cells were harvested for the experiments and consisted of >98% mast cells as assessed by toluidine blue staining. Cells were washed twice with serum-free medium (RPMI 1640 medium containing 1% bovine serum albumin and 20 µm2-mercaptoethanol) and incubated in serum-free medium for 6 h before cytokine stimulation, unless otherwise indicated. Cytokine concentrations used for the stimulation experiments were as follows: IL-3, 10 ng/ml; IL-15, 10 ng/ml; and IL-3 plus IL-15, 10 ng/ml each, unless otherwise indicated. Proliferation was measured by MTS assay. Briefly, 20,000 cells were plated in 96-well microtiter plates containing a dilution series of cytokines in 100 µl of medium. After 48 h, 20 µl of freshly prepared combined MTS/phenazine methosulfate solution (Promega) was added to each sample. After an additional 4 h of incubation at 37 °C, the conversion of MTS into the aqueous soluble formazan was measured by absorbance at 490 nm. Total cell counts were determined by trypan blue exclusion and by counting at least 200 cells from each individual culture. For the measurement of apoptosis, cells were stained with the FITC-conjugated anti-annexin V antibody (CLONTECH). Flow cytometric analysis was performed using a FACSCalibur flow cytometer (Becton Dickinson, Mountain View, CA). 1 × 106 cells were fixed in ice-cold 70% ethanol for 1 h, washed with phosphate-buffered saline twice, and stained with 250 µg/ml propidium iodide and 50 µg/ml RNase A at 4 °C for 30 min. Propidium iodide fluorescence of individual nuclei was measured using the FACSCalibur flow cytometer. MC/9 cells were incubated for 6 h at 37 °C in serum-free medium and stimulated under various conditions. Total cellular RNA was isolated using TrizolTMreagent (Life Technologies, Inc.) according to the manufacturer's instructions. 20-µg aliquots of the total RNAs were fractionated on a 1% agarose gel containing 20 mm MOPS, 5 mmsodium acetate, 1 mm EDTA (pH 7.0), and 6% (v/v) formaldehyde and transferred to a nylon membrane. After UV cross-linking, membranes were soaked in prehybridization solution (6× SSC, 5× Denhardt's reagent, 0.5% SDS, 100 mg/ml denatured salmon sperm DNA, and 50% formamide) for 3 h at 65 °C, followed by incubation with 32P-labeled probe in hybridization solution (6× SSC, 0.5% SDS, 100 mg/ml denatured salmon sperm DNA, and 50% formamide) for 14 h at 65 °C. The membranes were washed with 2× SSC and 0.1% SDS for 10 min twice at room temperature and with 0.1× SSC and 0.1% SDS for 10 min twice at 50 °C and exposed to Fuji RX-U film. cDNA fragments of the coding regions of mousebcl-x L, bcl-2, and β-actin were used as specific probes. Cells incubated for 6 h at 37 °C in serum-free medium and stimulated under various conditions were lysed in ice-cold lysis buffer (50 mm Hepes (pH 7.0), 150 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 1% Triton X-100, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EGTA, 100 mm NaF, 10 mm sodium inorganic pyrophosphate, 1 mm Na3VO4, and 1 mmphenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride with 10 µg/ml each aprotinin and leupeptin) and incubated on ice for 20 min. Samples were centrifuged (15,000 rpm, 5 min); the supernatants were analyzed on a 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gel; and the proteins were transferred to Immobilon polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Millipore Corp., Bedford, MA). The membranes were blocked with 1% bovine serum albumin in Tris-buffered saline containing 0.05% Tween 20 for 1 h, and Western blot analysis was performed as described previously (29Matsuguchi T. Zhao Y. Lilly M.B. Kraft A.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 17450-17459Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar), followed by detection using an enhanced chemiluminescence system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Nuclear extracts were prepared as previously described (30Schwenzer R. Siemienski K. Liptay S. Schubert G. Peters N. Scheurich P. Schmid R.M. Wajant H. J. Biol.

The double-strand DNA fragment carrying the STAT-binding site in the mouse bcl-x Lgene 5′-upstream region was prepared by annealing two oligonucleotides (sense, 5′-AAAGGCATTTCGGAGAAAAGGG-3′; and antisense, 5′-CCACCCCCTTTTCTCCGAAATG-3′), followed by 32P labeling by T4 nucleotide kinase. As described elsewhere (30Schwenzer R. Siemienski K. Liptay S. Schubert G. Peters N. Scheurich P. Schmid R.M. Wajant H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 19368-19374Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar), nuclear extracts (5 µg of total protein) were incubated with the 32P-labeled double-stranded probe. For the supershift experiment, 1 µg of the anti-STAT6 antibody or isotype-matched control antibody was added to the binding reaction. For competition assays, nuclear extracts containing equal amounts of total protein were preincubated with a 100-fold molar excess of the unlabeled bcl-x probe. Samples were run on a 5% nondenaturing polyacrylamide gel in Tris/glycine/EDTA buffer. The gel was dried and visualized by autoradiography. The 5′-upstream region of the murinebcl-x gene was obtained by polymerase chain reaction using two primers (5′-GCTCAACCAGTCCATTGTCC-3′ and 5′-CTAAACCCATACCTCCGGGA-3′) and the murine genomic DNA as a template. The amplified 748-base pair DNA fragment was digested with SmaΘ and BamHI and cloned into the pGL3-luciferase vector (Promega) to create thebcl-x promoter/luciferase construct. The STAT-binding site deletion mutant was prepared by ligating two polymerase chain reaction products amplified by primers 5′-GCTCAACCAGTCCATTGTCC-3′ (sense) and 5′-CGCTCGAGATGCCTTTCTCCAAAAGT-3′ (antisense) and primers 5′-CGCTCGAGAAGGGGGTGGGTTGGTTGT-3′ (sense) and 5′-CTAAACCCATACCTCCGGGA-3′ (antisense) after XhoI digestion. This procedure replaced the STAT-binding site with an XhoI recognition site. The ligated DNA fragment was cloned into the pGL3-luciferase vector. The expression plasmid of dominant-negative STAT6 lacking the C-terminal transactivation domain was previously described (18Masuda A. Matsuguchi T. Yamaki K. Hayakawa T. Kubo M. LaRochelle W.J. Yoshikai Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 29331-29337Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). MC/9 cells were transiently transfected with 3.5 µg of bcl-xpromoter/luciferase plasmid and 0.5 µg of pRL/SV40 (an internal control) by DMRIE-C reagent (Life Technologies, Inc.) according to the manufacturer's instructions. When indicated, cells were cotransfected with 1.8 µg of dominant-negative STAT6 or an empty vector and 1.8 µg of bcl-x promoter. 24 h after transfection, the cells were stimulated with IL-15 (10 ng/ml) or left untreated. After 12 h of incubation with IL-15, cells were lysed, and the luciferase activity was measured using the dual-luciferase reporter assay system (Toyo Ink Co., Tokyo, Japan) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The data are presented as the means ± S.D. of triplicate samples. The statistical significance of the data was determined by Student's t test. A pvalue of <0.05 was taken as significant. It has previously been shown that IL-15 weakly stimulates the proliferation of mast cells (17Tagaya Y. Burton J.D. Miyamoto Y. Waldmann T.A. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 4928-4939Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). To examine the efficiency of IL-15 as a mast cell growth factor, we measured the number of MC/9 cells stimulated by IL-15, IL-3, or both using the MTS assay. As shown in Fig.1 A, IL-15 weakly increased the number of MC/9 cells compared with IL-3, a potent growth factor of mast cells. Although it has been reported that IL-15 is a growth factor of mast cells (17Tagaya Y. Burton J.D. Miyamoto Y. Waldmann T.A. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 4928-4939Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar), a high concentration of IL-15 (>1000 pm) was needed to promote significant growth, and the concentration we used (10 ng/ml) promoted little growth. Surprisingly, when IL-15 was used in combination with IL-3, it significantly promoted MC/9 cell growth stimulated by IL-3. Furthermore, this synergistic effect of IL-15 and IL-3 was also observed when BMMCs were used, as shown Fig. 1 B. To confirm the results of the MTS assay, we also counted the MC/9 cell numbers. Similar to the results in Fig.1 A, the addition of IL-15 further promoted the cell number increase by IL-3 for at least up to 48 h (Fig. 1 C). To determine whether the growth of mast cells stimulated by IL-15 or IL-3 was due to increased cell division or inhibition of cell death, the cell cycle status was analyzed. MC/9 cells were incubated with IL-3, IL-15, or both for 48 h, and the cell cycle status was examined by flow cytometric analysis using propidium iodide staining. As shown in Fig.2 A, IL-3 stimulation moderately reduced the number of cells in the sub-G0 phase and increased the number of cells in S/G2/M compared with the unstimulated control. In contrast, there was only a slight increase in the proportion of S/G2/M cells in the presence of IL-15, consistent with the previously reported weak proliferative activity of IL-15 in mast cells. On the other hand, a moderate reduction was observed in the number of cells in the sub-G0 phase. The combination of IL-3 and IL-15 reduced the number of cells in the sub-G0 phase more significantly. The anti-apoptotic effect of IL-15 was observed as soon as 18 h after IL-3 withdrawal (data not shown). To confirm whether these cytokines could prevent mast cell apoptosis, we examined apoptotic cell death by flow cytometric staining with FITC-conjugated annexin V (Fig. 2 B). Similar to the results in Fig. 2 A, both IL-3 and IL-15 significantly reduced the proportion of annexin V-stained cells, suggesting that these cytokines inhibit the apoptotic death of MC/9 cells induced by growth factor deprivation. The combination of IL-3 and IL-15 reduced the proportion of annexin V-stained cells more significantly. It has recently been reported that induction of apoptosis by activation of the Fas pathway may contribute to the regulation of mast cell numbers in vivo (8Hartmann K. Wagelie-Steffen A.L. von Stebut E. Metcalfe D.D. J. Immunol. 1997; 159: 4006-4014PubMed Google Scholar). As the IL-15/IgG2b fusion protein protects against Fas-mediated apoptosis in the liver, spleen, and thymus (31Bulfone-Paus S. Ungureanu D. Pohl T. Lindner G. Paus R. Ruckert R. Krause H. Kunzendorf U. Nat. Med. 1997; 3: 1124-1128Crossref PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar), we next sought to determine whether IL-15 could prevent the Fas-mediated cell death of mast cells. MC/9 cells constitutively expressed a significant amount of Fas antigen on the cell surface (data not shown). To determine whether IL-15 could prevent anti-Fas antibody-mediated cell death, MC/9 cells were incubated with 50 ng/ml anti-Fas mAb alone or in combination with IL-3, IL-15, or IL-3 plus IL-15. Apoptotic cell death was examined by flow cytometric staining with FITC-conjugated annexin V. As shown in Fig.3, IL-15 significantly inhibited cell death induced by Fas cross-linking. In contrast, IL-3 did not inhibit the Fas-mediated cell death of MC/9 cells. Members of the Bcl-2 family of proteins have central roles in the regulation of apoptosis (32Boise L.H. Gonzalez-Garcia M.

To investigate the effects of IL-15 on the gene expression involved in the intrinsic resistance of MC/9 cells to apoptosis, bcl-2 andbcl-x L mRNA levels were examined during deprivation and cytokine stimulation. As shown in Fig.4 A, only IL-3, but not IL-15, increased bcl-2 mRNA expression. In contrast, only IL-15, but not IL-3, increased bcl-x L mRNA. The up-regulation of bcl-x L mRNA was also observed when BMMCs were stimulated with IL-15 (Fig. 4 A). As shown in Fig. 4 B, 100 or 1000 pg/ml IL-15 induced moderate increases in bcl-x L mRNA, whereas 10,000 pg/ml IL-15 showed a more evident effect. In the time course analysis, the increase in bcl-x L mRNA was found to occur as fast as 4 h and lasted for at least 24 h after IL-15 stimulation (Fig. 4 B). Since it has been reported that the levels ofbcl-2 mRNA do not necessarily correlate well with the levels of Bcl-2 protein (43Chleq-Deschamps C.M. LeBrun D.P. Huie P. Besnier D.P. Warnke R.A.

MC/9 cells were cultured in IL-3 or IL-15 for 16 h, and Western blot analyses were performed. The levels of Bcl-2 protein did not vary significantly during factor deprivation or IL-3 or IL-15 stimulation (Fig. 4 C). However, the levels of Bcl-xL protein were increased when the cells were stimulated with IL-15 (Fig. 4 C). We also examined other signaling pathways known to regulate cell apoptosis. Although Akt is a known target of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase and has been implicated in the survival of mast cells (44Yang F.C. Kapur R. King A.J. Tao W. Kim C. Borneo J. Breese R. Marshall M.

https://openalex.org/W2316942563,"Signal Transducer and Activator of Transcription (STATs) are important mediators of cytokine and growth factor-induced signal transduction. STAT5A and STAT5B have been shown to play a role in survival and proliferation of hematopoietic cells both in vitro and in vivo and to contribute to the growth and viability of cells transformed by the TEL-JAK2 oncoprotein. In this study, we investigated the molecular mechanisms by which constitutively active STAT5 proteins induce cell proliferation and survival of Ba/F3 cell lines expressing either dominant positive STAT5A or STAT5B variants or TEL-JAK2 or TEL-ABL fusion proteins. Our results showed that active STAT5 constitutively interacted with p85, the regulatory subunit of the PI 3-kinase. A constitutive activity of the PI 3-kinase/Akt pathway was observed in these cells and required for their cell cycle progression. In contrast, while activity of the PI 3-kinase/Akt pathway was required for survival of Ba/F3 cells expressing the constitutively active forms of STAT5A or STAT5B, it was dispensable for cells transformed by TEL-JAK2 or TEL–ABL fusion proteins, suggesting that additional survival pathways take place in these transformed cells."
https://openalex.org/W2313180978,"Alternative use of genes of the closely-related pp32 family is a common occurrence in human prostate cancer. pp32r1 and pp32r2, the oncogenic members of the pp32 family, are expressed in prostatic adenocarcinoma, while adjacent benign prostate continues to express pp32. This study focuses upon the role of pp32 in tumor suppression. We demonstrate that antisense inhibition of pp32 in NIH3T3 cells leads to a variety of phenotypic changes associated with transformation including reduced serum dependence and loss of contact inhibition. NIH3T3 cells with antisense-inhibited pp32 are not tumorigenic, but are markedly more susceptible to oncogenic stimuli such as ras. In contrast, constitutive expression of pp32 abolishes ras mediated transformation in vitro and tumorigenesis in vivo. These data demonstrate, from the functional aspect, that pp32 acts as a tumor suppressor. Furthermore, inactivation of pp32 function through alternative gene use may be a critical event in tumor evolution and progression."

https://openalex.org/W2090023262,"The D2 dopamine receptor has been expressed in Sf21 insect cells together with the G proteins Go and Gi2, using the baculovirus system. Expression levels of receptor and G protein (α, β, and γ subunits) in the two preparations were similar as shown by binding of [3H]spiperone and quantitative Western blot, respectively. For several agonists, binding data were fitted best by a two-binding site model in either preparation, showing interaction of expressed receptor and G protein. For some agonists, binding to the higher affinity site was of higher affinity in D2/Go than in the D2/Gi2 preparation. Some agonists exhibited binding data that were best fitted by a two-binding site model in D2/Go and a one-binding site model in D2/Gi2. Therefore, receptor/G protein interaction seemed to be stronger in the D2/Gopreparation. Agonist stimulation of [35S]GTPγS (guanosine 5′-3-O-(thio)triphosphate) binding in the two preparations also gave evidence for higher affinity D2/Go interaction. In the D2/Go preparation, agonist stimulation of [35S]GTPγS binding occurred at higher potency for several agonists, and a higher stimulation (relative to dopamine) was achieved in D2/Go compared with D2/Gi2. Some agonists were able to stimulate [35S]GTPγS binding in the D2/Gopreparation but not in D2/Gi2. The extent of D2 receptor selectivity for Go over Gi2 is therefore dependent on the agonist used, and thus agonists may stabilize different conformations of the receptor with different abilities to couple to and activate G proteins.

Raven Press, New York1993Google Scholar). Agonists must bind to receptors, and this may be characterized in terms of an affinity of agonist binding. Agonists must also activate the receptor and associated signaling systems, and this property is often referred to as efficacy. Efficacy is exhibited in terms of the maximal effect induced by the agonist and also in the EC50 of the agonist in activating the signaling system, which is often lower than the concentration of agonist which achieves half-maximal occupancy of the receptor.For G protein-coupled receptors, an influential model of agonist action is the ternary complex model and its recent extensions (4De Lean A. Stadel J.M. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 7108-7117Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 5Samama P. Cotecchia S. Costa T. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol.

In this model the receptor exists in an inactive ground state, which may isomerize to a partially activated state (R*)1 that is able to couple more efficiently to the G protein to form the coupled active species (R*G). The formation of R*G may occur spontaneously, but in the presence of an agonist both R* and R*G are stabilized, and the ternary complex (AR*G) is formed. Guanine nucleotide exchange (GDP/GTP) occurs in both the binary complex (R*G) and the ternary complex (AR*G). The binary and ternary complexes dissociate releasing αGTP and βγ subunits of the G protein which can alter effector activity. The agonist may also influence ternary complex breakdown (7Hausdorff W.P. Hnatowitch M. O'Dowd B.F. Caron M.G. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 1388-1393Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 8Birnbaumer L. Abramowitz J. Brown A.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1990; 1031: 163-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (958) Google Scholar) so that there are several places at which agonism is determined.There is, however, evidence that some receptors may interact with more than one G protein so that influences on different signaling pathways can occur. If a receptor can interact with more than one G protein this may influence the potency of agonist action and the pattern of agonist effects, i.e. the pharmacological profile of the response observed through the different G proteins. For the 5HT1A serotonin receptor, it was shown that the receptor interacts preferentially with Gi/Go/Gzsubtypes of G protein (9Raymond J.R. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1999; 127: 1751-1764Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar) and that the nature of the G protein subtype influenced the agonist selectivity of the response (10Gettys T.W. Fields T.A. Raymond J.R. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 4283-4290Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). This question was addressed more explicitly for the α2-adrenergic receptor (11Yang Q. Lanier S.M. Mol. Pharmacol. 1999; 56: 651-656Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Expression of Gαo, together with the endogenous G proteins of NIH 3T3 cells, altered the agonist selectivity of the receptor; the partial agonists, oxymetazoline and clonidine, exhibited increased efficacy. The possibility that the pharmacological profile of the response depends on the nature of the G protein has been termed “agonist trafficking” (12Kenakin T. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 1995; 16: 232-238Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (578) Google Scholar).The D2 dopamine receptor has been shown to interact with different G proteins to influence different signaling events (13Neve K. Neve R.A. The Dopamine Receptors. Humana Press, Totowa, NJ1997Crossref Google Scholar, 14Ghahremani M.H. Cheng P. Lembo P.M.C. Albert P.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 9238-9245Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). In one study, interaction with Go has been shown to lead to inhibition of calcium channels, whereas interaction with Gisubtypes has been shown to lead to inhibition of adenylyl cyclase (15Liu Y.F. Jakobs K.H. Rasenick M.M. Albert P.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 13880-13886Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Also, the two splice variants of the D2 receptor (D2short and D2long) have been reported to interact with different G proteins (13Neve K. Neve R.A. The Dopamine Receptors. Humana Press, Totowa, NJ1997Crossref Google Scholar), although a clear definition of the selectivity pattern has not emerged as yet. Furthermore, the relative efficacies of quinpirole and (+)-3-PPP are reversed when tested on the D2 receptor in the striatum and the pituitary gland (16Meller E. Puza T. Diamond J. Lieu H.D. Bohmaker K. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1992; 263: 462-469PubMed Google Scholar), suggesting agonist trafficking, possibly via different G proteins.To investigate these phenomena we have expressed the D2dopamine receptor together with the G proteins Go and Gi2 in insect cells, using the baculovirus system (17Summers M.D. Smith G.E. Tex. Agric. Exp. Stn. Bull. 1987; 1555: 5-53Google Scholar). This system provides a powerful tool for the reconstitution of receptor/G protein interactions. Insect cells do not contain endogenous dopamine receptors, and interaction between recombinant receptors and the endogenous G proteins of the cells is minimal.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterials[phenyl-4-3H]Spiperone (25Ci/mmol) was from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, and [35S]GTPγS (1,250 Ci/mmol) was from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. Antibodies specific for different G protein subunits were from Chemicon and Santa Cruz as indicated. Other reagents were obtained as indicated or were of the highest purity available from commercial suppliers.MethodsCell CultureSf21 cells were grown either in monolayers or in suspension, using shaker flasks (25–100-ml cultures) agitated at 116 rpm. Cells were cultured at 26 °C in TC100 medium supplemented with 8% fetal calf serum and 0.1% Pluronic F-68 (Life Technologies, Inc.). CHO cells expressing the long form of the rat D2 dopamine receptor (18Castro S.W. Strange P.G. FEBS Lett. 1993; 315: 223-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 19Castro S.W. Strange P.G. J.

Strange P.G. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1995; 115: 102Google Scholar). The first fragment consisted of the generic baculovirus transfer nonfusion vector, pVL1392 (PharMingen), digested with PstI andBamHI. The second fragment was generated by polymerase chain reaction and comprised at its 5′-end, a PstI restriction site, to facilitate ligation to the vector, an ATG start codon, immediately followed by DNA encoding the FLAG epitope and the first 116 amino acids of the rat D2long receptor sequence, and at its 3′-end, an Alw44I restriction site to allow ligation to the final cDNA fragment. The final fragment was a 1.0-kilobase cDNA fragment, coding for the remaining amino acids of the dopamine receptor, and was excised from an existing baculovirus transfer vector containing receptor cDNA (pVL1392D2), usingAlw44I and BamHI. The sequence of the DNA corresponding to the polymerase chain reaction fragment and the three ligation sites was confirmed by dideoxy DNA sequencing using the Sequenase version 2.0 DNA sequencing kit (United States Biochemical). Transfer of the FLAG-D2long cDNA into theAutographa californica nuclear polyhedrosis virus genome in the form of BaculoGold (PharMingen) was achieved by cotransfecting Sf21 cells with plasmid DNA and BaculoGold in the presence of Lipofectin (Life Technologies, Inc.). Recombinant baculovirus was purified by a single round of plaque purification (17Summers M.D. Smith G.E. Tex. Agric. Exp. Stn. Bull. 1987; 1555: 5-53Google Scholar) and stocks amplified (100-ml cultures, multiplicity of infection = 0.1). For expression, cells were infected at a cell density of 1 × 106 cells/ml with recombinant baculovirus at a multiplicity of infection of 10. Baculoviruses containing G protein sequences were constructed as described (21Graber S.G. Figler R.A. Garrison J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 1271-1278Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).Preparation of Washed Cell HomogenatesAll operations were carried out at 0–4 °C. Sf21 cells were harvested 48 h after infection by centrifugation at 3,000 × g for 10 min and resuspended at ∼5 × 107 cells/ml in 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 6 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, and protease inhibitors (Boehringer COMPLETE ™). Sf21 cells were homogenized with 50 strokes of a Dounce homogenizer and centrifuged at 3,000 ×g for 10 min. The supernatant was collected and centrifuged at 48,000 × g for 60 min, and the pellet was resuspended in 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 10 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, and protease inhibitors (Boehringer COMPLETE ™). The resulting washed membrane homogenates were stored at −80 °C until used for Western blot analysis or ligand binding assays.Membrane preparations from CHO cells expressing D2 dopamine receptors were made as described by Castro and Strange (18Castro S.W.

Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), with bovine serum albumin as the standard.Ligand Binding AssaysBinding to washed membrane homogenates (15–50 µg of protein) was assayed in triplicate using [phenyl-4-3H]spiperone (25Ci/mmol; 0.1–5 nm for saturation analyses and 1 nm for competition assays). Except where indicated, assays were performed in a final volume of 1 ml of assay buffer: 20 mm HEPES, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 6 mmMgCl2, pH 7.4. In agonist binding assays, 100 µm dithiothreitol was added as an antioxidant. For substituted benzamide antagonists, the standard assay buffer was supplemented with 100 mm NaCl or N-methyld-glucamine (NMDG) as indicated. Binding was measured in the presence of 3 µm (−)-butaclamol and (+)-butaclamol to define total and nonspecific binding, respectively, over a period of 180 min at 25 °C. Bound and free radioligands were separated by rapid filtration through GF/B filters on a Brandel cell harvester with four washes of 4 ml of phosphate-buffered saline (0.14 mNaCl, 3 mm KCl, 1.5 mmKH2PO4, and 5 mmNa2HPO4, pH 7.4). Bound radioactivity was determined by liquid scintillation counting. Ligand binding data were analyzed by nonlinear least squares regression using the computer program GraphPad Prism (GraphPad Software Inc.).In some saturation assays a total assay volume of 10 ml was employed. The protein amount was the same as in the 1-ml assays so that the protein concentration was 10-fold lower. The concentrations of other substances were the same as in the 1-ml assays, but the time of incubation was 7 h.[35S]GTPγS Binding AssaysIn agonist stimulation experiments, 50 µg of cell membranes were incubated in triplicate with 10 µm GDP and increasing concentrations of agonist in a final volume of 0.9 ml of buffer (20 mmHEPES, 10 mm MgCl2, 100 mm NaCl, pH 7.4) for 30 min at 30 °C as described by Gardner et al. (23Gardner B. Hall D.A. Strange P.G. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1996; 118: 1544-1550Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 24Gardner B. Hall D.A. Strange P.G. J.

Pharmacol. 1998; 124: 978-984Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). 0.1 ml of [35S]GTPγS (1,250 Ci/mmol) was added to a final concentration of 100 pm and the incubation continued for a further 20 min. Basal levels of [35S]GTPγS binding were defined as that in the absence of agonist. Incubations were terminated by rapid filtration through Whatman GF/B glass fiber filters using a Brandel cell harvester with four washes of 4 ml of phosphate-buffered saline, and radioactivity determined as above. When different agonists were tested, a 1 mm dopamine control was always present in the assay to allow relative efficacy determinations to be made.In saturation binding experiments, 40 µg of cell membranes was incubated in triplicate with 10 µm GDP, 100 pm [35S]GTPγS, 100 pm-100 nm GTPγS in the absence or presence of 1 mmdopamine in a final volume of 1 ml of buffer for 2 h at 30 °C. Dopamine-stimulated [35S]GTPγS binding was obtained by subtraction, and total dopamine-stimulated GTPγS binding was determined as dpm bound × ([total GTPγS]/[[35S]GTPγS]).Determination of G Protein Level Using Quantitative Western BlotBefore analysis, proteins (Sf21 membranes or pure G protein subunits) were denatured by the addition of 10 µl of electrophoresis loading buffer (100 mm Tris-Cl, 200 mm dithiothreitol, 4% SDS, 0.2% bromphenol blue, 20% glycerol) and heated at 90 °C for 5 min. Sf21 membrane proteins (20–40 µg) and G protein standards were separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis on 12% acrylamide gels. Samples were then transferred to nitrocellulose membranes using the Bio-Rad semidry transfer system. Nitrocellulose membranes were incubated for 1 h with 5% dried milk (w/v) in buffer (137 mm NaCl, 3 mm KCl, 25 mm Tris-Cl, 0.1% Tween). Membranes were then incubated overnight at 4 °C with single primary antibodies (monoclonal antibody 3073 anti-αo, 1 µg/ml (Chemicon); C-10 anti-α1–3, 1 µg/ml (Santa Cruz, see Fig. 2); monoclonal antibody 3077 anti-αi2, 1 µg/ml (Chemicon, see Fig. 3); C-16 anti-β1, 0.4 µg/ml (Santa Cruz); A-16 anti-γ2, 0.4 µg/ml (Santa Cruz)) in buffer containing 5% dried milk (w/v). Membranes were washed five times with buffer (10 min each) and then incubated with secondary antibody (anti-mouse (αo, αi2)/rabbit (αi1–3, β1, γ2) immunoglobin horseradish peroxidase conjugate (Sigma, 1:5,000)) for 1 h. Membranes were then washed three times (10 min each) with buffer before exposure to equal volumes of Enhanced Chemiluminescence (ECL) detection reagents 1 and 2 (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Membranes were then wrapped in Clingfilm and exposed to Hybond-ECL x-ray film for between 30 s and 2 min. Densitometry was performed using a GS710 calibrated imaging densitometer (Bio-Rad), and data were analyzed using GraphPad Prism. Determinations of levels of G protein subunits were always performed using ECL exposures that ensured a linear dependence of band density on protein amount.Figure 3Extraction of G protein α subunits by cholate. Membranes from preparations expressing Go or Gi2 were extracted with 1% cholate as described under “Experimental Procedures,” and the levels of G protein α subunit were determined as in Fig. 2. In panels A and B, lanes 1–5 contain 1, 0.5, 0.1, 0.05, and 0.01 µg of pure G protein α subunit, respectively (panel A, αo; panel B, αi2), and lanes 6 and 7 contain, respectively, the supernatant and pellet from the cholate extract (equivalent to 100 µg of membrane protein). The distribution of α subunit in the two preparations was: Go supernatant, 68 ± 5%; pellet, 32 ± 5%; Gi2 supernatant, 59 ± 8%; pellet, 41 ± 8% (mean ± S.E. (3Kenakin T.P.

The mixture was centrifuged at 4,500 × gfor 5 min at 4 °C, and the supernatant and pellet were collected. These were then analyzed using Western blotting as above, the pellet having been dissolved in 1% cholate, 1% Nonidet P-40, and 1m NaCl.DISCUSSIONIn this study we have expressed the D2 dopamine receptor together with the G proteins Go and Gi2 in insect cells using the baculovirus system. We show that the D2 receptor interacts more strongly with Go than Gi2 and that this influences the functional selectivity of agonist signaling. We also show that the extent of the selectivity of the interaction between the D2receptor and Go or Gi2 depends on the agonist used. Thus, agonists may stabilize different conformations of the receptor with different abilities to interact with and activate G proteins. This is the first study to address this issue for the D2 dopamine receptor in a fully defined system.The levels of receptor (R) and G protein (G) subunits (αo/αi2, and β1 and γ2) in the preparations expressing Go and Gi2 were determined using saturation analysis with the radioligand [3H]spiperone and quantitative Western blot, respectively. The levels of α subunit detected were similar to those reported in other studies on expression of receptors and Gior Gs proteins in insect cells (27Wenzel-Seifert K. Hurt C.M. Seifert R J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 24181-24189Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar, 32Wenzel-Seifert K. Seifert R. Mol. Pharmacol. 2000; 58: 954-966Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). The γ2 subunit was expressed at lower levels than either the β1 or α subunits and so may limit the levels of G protein heterotrimers. Membranes were also extracted with 1% cholate because this has been proposed to extract active G protein (33McCallum J.F. Wise A. Grassie M.A. Magee A.I. Guzzi F. Parenti M. Milligan G. Biochem. J. 1995; 310: 1021-1027Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 34Ransnas L.A. Jasper J.R. Leiber D. Insel P.A. Biochem.

FEBS Lett. 1994; 354: 195-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar); in each preparation 60–70% of the α subunit was extractable. Based on these values and the limiting level of γ2 subunit, there was a ratio of heterotrimeric G protein to receptor of ∼20-fold in both preparations. This ratio is comparable with to obtained in other studies on expression of receptors and G proteins. G/R ratios of ∼30–100 have been reported in insect cells (27Wenzel-Seifert K. Hurt C.M. Seifert R J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 24181-24189Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar, 31Grunewald S. Reilander H. Michel H.

Pharmacol. 2000; 58: 954-966Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar), and G/R ratios of ∼50 have been reported for α2 adrenergic receptors in platelets (37Neubig R.R. FASEB J. 1994; 8: 939-946Crossref PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar) and ∼100 for β-adrenergic receptors in lymphoma cells (38Ransnas L.A. Insel P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 9482-9485Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).[35S]GTPγS saturation binding assays were performed in the two preparations. These assays have been used by others to assess G protein levels (see, e.g. Ref. 39Selley D.E. Sim L.J. Xiao R. Liu Q. Childers S.R. Mol. Pharmacol. 1997; 51: 87-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). In the present system, [35S]GTPγS saturation binding assays gave similar values for the level of dopamine-stimulated [35S]GTPγS binding in the two preparations. The levels determined by [35S]GTPγS binding are low compared with the numbers of G proteins measured by quantitative Western blot. This is probably because there is a high concentration of GDP in the [35S]GTPγS binding assays which reduces the binding of the radioligand substantially. At the highest concentrations of GTPγS used, there is more than a 100-fold excess of GDP, and therefore it is not surprising that the levels of α subunits detected by Western blotting are roughly 100-fold higher than detected in the [35S]GTPγS binding assays. Nevertheless, in the present study, based on these different determinations, the levels of receptor and G protein subunits were similar in the membranes expressing Go and Gi2. The two preparations are, therefore, comparable, and any differences between the preparations are unlikely to be caused either by receptor or G protein numbers.Agonist binding in the membranes expressing receptor and G protein (Go, Gi2) could, for many agonists, be resolved into contributions from sites of higher and lower affinity in similar proportions in the two preparations. This shows that the expressed D2 receptor and G proteins are able to interact. For two of the agonists (dopamine, NPA), GTP abolished the higher affinity binding site. The affinity seen in the presence of GTP was similar to both the lower affinity site seen in the absence of GTP and the affinity for these agonists seen in a preparation containing receptor alone. These data follow the predicted behavior of a system that conforms to a ternary complex model with an excess of receptor over G protein (40Wreggett K.A. DeLean A. Mol. Pharmacol. 1984; 26: 214-227PubMed Google Scholar,41Lee T.W.T. Sole M.J. Wells J.W. Biochemistry. 1986; 25: 7009-7020Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). The data on the levels of receptor and G protein in the membranes show, however, that there is an excess of G protein over receptor of about 20-fold. Similar discrepancies between inferred and measured R/G ratios have been noted in other systems. It has been proposed (37Neubig R.R. FASEB J. 1994; 8: 939-946Crossref PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar, 42Jakubik J. Haga T. Tucek S. Mol. Pharmacol. 1998; 54: 899-906Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar) that receptors and G proteins may not interact freely and that there may be microdomains with different amounts of receptor and G protein. Alternatively, the ternary complex models are an oversimplification and receptor and G protein may form oligomers with properties different from the predictions of the models (43Chidiac P. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1998; 55: 549-556Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar).Two observations from the ligand binding studies suggest that there may be a greater affinity of the D2 receptor for Gothan for Gi2 when occupied by several agonists. First, the affinity of the higher affinity site is higher in the preparation containing Go, for m-tyramine and NPA. This affinity difference should reflect the affinity of R/G coupling, given that the ground state affinity of the receptor is similar in the two preparations. Also, (−)-3-PPP is unable to stabilize the higher affinity state in the preparation containing Gi2 but can do so in the preparation containing Go. In agreement with these findings, differences in agonist affinity for one receptor coupled to different G proteins have been described by others (11Yang Q. Lanier S.M. Mol. Pharmacol. 1999; 56: 651-656Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 44Bae H. Anderson K. Flood L.A. Skiba N.P. Hamm H.E. Graber S.G. J. Biol.

Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 12930-12938Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar).A range of agonists was used to stimulate [35S]GTPγS binding in the two preparations to assess G protein activation. Maximal agonist effects (relative to dopamine) were greater in the preparation containing Go, and some agonists (p-tyramine, (−)-3-PPP) were unable to stimulate [35S]GTPγS binding at all in the preparation containing Gi2. The potencies of agonists to stimulate [35S]GTPγS binding were also generally greater in the preparation containing Go, with the exception of bromocriptine. These data suggest that there is a more productive interaction between the D2 receptor and Go. The affinity of the interaction between receptor and G protein may contribute to this, as suggested above from the ligand binding data. The pattern of agonist binding and potencies in [35S]GTPγS binding assays is very similar in the preparation containing Go compared with that seen for the D2 receptor expressed in CHO cells (23Gardner B. Hall D.A. Strange P.G. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1996; 118: 1544-1550Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 24Gardner B. Hall D.A. Strange P.G. J.

The present system is, therefore, behaving similarly to a system in which the receptor couples exclusively with endogenous mammalian G proteins.To understand the differences between the two preparations in more detail, the data were analyzed to provide theKl/EC50 ratio (ratio of agonist binding dissociation constant to agonist potency) (TableV). TheKl/EC50 ratio (or amplification ratio (24Gardner B. Hall D.A. Strange P.G. J. Neurochem. 1997; 69: 2589-2598Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 25Gardner B. Strange P.G. Br. J.

Sci. 1983; 220: 141-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (927) Google Scholar)) indicates the extent to which agonist activation of a response occurs at lower concentrations than agonist binding to the receptor and so is a measure of receptor/G protein activation. TheKl/EC50 ratio of the agonists is greater in the preparation containing Go than in the preparation containing Gi2, providing a further indication that there is a more productive interaction between the D2 receptor and Go.Table VAgonist signaling parametersLigandPreparationK l/K hK l/EC50D2/αo/β1/γ2D2/αi2/β1/γ2D2/αo/β1/γ2D2/αi2/β1/γ2Bromocriptine110.60.6Dopamine270570232.8NPA600170194.8(+)-3-PPP2,6002,7007.93.3(−)-3-PPP60017.5m-Tyramine66"

This feature allows these proteins to be readily purified in a single step by immobilized metal affinity chromatography. The Cu,Zn-superoxide dismutases from both Haemophilus ducreyi andHaemophilus parainfluenzae display anomalous absorption spectra in the visible region due to copper binding at the N-terminal region. Reconstitution experiments of copper-free enzymes demonstrate that, under conditions of limited copper availability, this metal ion is initially bound at the N-terminal region and subsequently transferred to an active site. Evidence is provided for intermolecular pathways of copper transfer from the N-terminal domain of an enzyme subunit to an active site located on a distinct dimeric molecule. Incubation with EDTA rapidly removes copper bound at the N terminus but is much less effective on the copper ion bound at the active site. This indicates that metal binding by the N-terminal histidines is kinetically favored, but the catalytic site binds copper with higher affinity. We suggest that the histidine-rich N-terminal region constitutes a metal binding domain involved in metal uptake under conditions of metal starvation in vivo. Particular biological importance for this domain is inferred by the observation that its presence enhances the protection offered by periplasmic Cu,Zn-superoxide dismutase toward phagocytic killing.

Zn-SOD, Cu,Zn-superoxide dismutase Luria-Bertani broth polymerase chain reaction polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis nitrilotriacetic acid, IDA, iminodiacetic acid Cu,Zn-superoxide dismutases (Cu,Zn-SODs)1 (encoded in bacteria by sodC gene(s)) are metalloenzymes that catalyze the dismutation of the superoxide anion into oxygen and hydrogen peroxide by the alternate reduction and oxidation of a copper ion that constitutes the catalytically active redox center (1Bannister J.V. Bannister W.H. Rotilio G. CRC Crit. Rev. Biochem. 1987; 22: 111-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (786) Google Scholar). Although for a long time Cu,Zn-SODs have been considered almost exclusively eukaryotic cytosolic enzymes, more recent studies have established that this enzyme is present in a large number of bacterial species, where it is exported to extracytoplasmic compartments (2Kroll J.S. Langford P.R. Wilks K. Keil A.D. Microbiology. 1995; 141: 2271-2279Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Since the first step in the phagocytic oxidative burst is the single electron reduction of molecular oxygen to superoxide by a transmembrane NADPH-oxidase complex (3Babior B.M Am. J.

These studies have shown that prokaryotic and eukaryotic Cu,Zn-SODs derive from a common ancestor gene and share a similar three-dimensional fold, based on a flattened Greek-key eight-stranded β-barrel and a similar organization of the redox center. In the oxidized form the copper ion is coordinated by the nitrogen atoms of four histidine residues; the zinc ion is coordinated by three histidines and an aspartic acid residue, and the two metal ions are simultaneously coordinated by a single histidine residue (termed the “histidine bridge” or the “bridging imidazolate”), in a structural motif so far found only in Cu,Zn-SODs (22Rotilio G. Calabrese L. Coleman J. J. Biol. Chem. 1973; 248: 3853-3859Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar, 23Tainer J.A. Getzoff E.D. Beem K.M. Richardson J.S. Richardson D.C. J. Mol. Biol. 1982; 160: 287-303Crossref PubMed Scopus (900) Google Scholar). Relevant differences are, however, observed in the organization of the active site channel and in the way subunits are assembled. In particular, these studies have highlighted that bacterial Cu,Zn-SOD may be monomeric or dimeric (15Bordo D. Matak D. Djinovic-Carugo K. Rosano C. Pesce A. Bolognesi M. Stroppolo M.E. Falconi M. Battistoni A. Desideri A. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 285: 283-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar) and that small differences at the dimer interface may finely modulate the enzyme activity and stability (17Pesce A. Battistoni A. Stroppolo M.E. Polizio F. Nardini M. Kroll J.S. Langford P.R. O'Neill P. Sette M. Desideri A. Bolognesi M. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 302: 465-478Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Interestingly, whereas all eukaryotic Cu,Zn-SODs conform to a single structural model that appears to have been strictly preserved throughout evolution (24Bordo D. Djinovic-Carugo K. Bolognesi M. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 238: 366-368Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar), analysis of amino acid sequences from Cu,Zn-SODs of different bacterial species suggests much greater variation, so individual enzyme variants may exhibit unique properties (15Bordo D. Matak D. Djinovic-Carugo K. Rosano C. Pesce A. Bolognesi M. Stroppolo M.E. Falconi M. Battistoni A. Desideri A. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 285: 283-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 16Forest K.T. Langford P.R. Kroll J.S. Getzoff E.D. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 296: 145-153Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). The most obvious differences between bacterial Cu,Zn-SODs include insertions and deletions in some of the major loops protruding from the β-barrel, which could plausibly result in differences in the active site channel architecture and subunit assembly, and the substitutions of some of the conserved metal ligands that are expected to affect significantly the enzyme activity. The functional implications of these variations are still to be explored, but it is likely that such differences may lead to modulation in the enzyme activity in different bacteria. In general, the bacterial Cu,Zn-SODs are least alike at their N-terminal ends. In this study, we have investigated the metal binding ability of N-terminal extensions present in a subset of Cu,Zn-SODs from Gram-negative pathogenic bacteria. We have found that such extensions, which are in a highly mobile conformation and contain several histidine residues, bind divalent metal ions with high efficiency. We propose that they represent high affinity functional metal binding domains, perhaps involved in the uptake of the prosthetic metals of the enzyme in environments where their concentration is very low. Plasmids pIT4, pJSK130, and pJSK40, bearing the sodC genes from H. ducreyi, Haemophilus parainfluenzae, andHaemophilus influenzae, respectively, have been described previously (25Langford P.R. Kroll J.S. FEMS Immunol. Med. Microbiol. 1997; 17: 235-242PubMed Google Scholar, 26Kroll J.S. Langford P.R. Loynds B.M. J. Bacteriol. 1992; 173: 7449-7457Crossref Google Scholar). In order to ensure similar expression levels of the different enzyme variants, all sequences encoding mature Cu,Zn-SODs were cloned in plasmid pHEN-1 (27Hoogenboom H. Griffiths A.D. Johnson K.S. Chiswell D.J. Hudson P. Winter G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 4133-4137Crossref PubMed Scopus (893) Google Scholar), under control of thelacZ promoter. Plasmid pPHduSOD1, expressing wild typeH. ducreyi Cu,Zn-SOD, was obtained by PCR amplification with the oligonucleotides HduFor1 (5′-CTAAGCTTAAGGAGATAAAATGAAATTA) and HduRev (5′-CCTGAATTCTTATTTAATTACACCGCATGCC), using pIT4 as a DNA template and the high fidelity polymerase ExpandTM (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). The amplified DNA was digested withHindIII and EcoRI and cloned in the corresponding sites of pHEN-1. Plasmid pJSK326, expressing a truncated form ofH. ducreyi Cu,Zn-SOD (N-terminal deleted mutant) lacking the first 22 amino acids (HGDHMHNHDTKMDTMSKDMMSM), was obtained by a similar strategy, amplifying the coding sequence with primers HduFor2 (5′-TTCCATGGCCGAAAAAATTGTAGTGCCT) and HduRev and subsequently cloning the amplified DNA in the NcoI andEcoRI sites of pHEN1. To construct plasmid pPHduSODFIRS, expressing a mutant H. ducreyi enzyme lacking residues 11–22, the sequence encoding residues 1–10 was amplified with primers HduFor1 and HduRevS (5′-GACCATGGTGTCATGATTATGCATA). The PCR product was restricted with HindIII and NcoI and inserted in the corresponding sites of plasmid pJSK326. Plasmids pPHpSOD and pPHiSOD expressing wild type Cu,Zn-SODs from H. parainfluenzae and H. influenzae, respectively, were constructed as follows. The sequences coding for the two mature enzymes were amplified with primers HiFor (5′-AACCATGGCCCATGACCATATGGCAAAAC) and HiRev (5′-CTGAATTCTTATTTAATCACGCCACATGC), using plasmids pJSK130 and pJSK40 as templates. The amplified DNA fragments were digested withNcoI and EcoRI. Since there is an internalNcoI site in these two sodC genes, the resultingNcoI-NcoI (279 base pairs) andNcoI-EcoRI (216 base pairs) DNA fragments were separated by agarose gel electrophoresis, and theNcoI-EcoRI fragment from H. parainfluenzae (identical to the corresponding DNA region of theH. influenzae sodC gene) was cloned in plasmid pHEN-1, thus obtaining plasmid pPHaeShort. Subsequently, theNcoI-NcoI fragments from the two distinctsodC genes were inserted in the NcoI site of pPHaeShort. To construct plasmids pPHpSOD-3 and pPHiSOD-3, expressing mutant proteins lacking the first three amino acid residues (HDH), DNA was amplified with primers hemeFor2 (5′-AACCATGGCTATGGCAAAACCAGCAGGT) and HiRev, using pPHpSOD and pPHiSOD as DNA templates, respectively. After digestion with NcoI, the 270-base pairNcoI-NcoI DNA fragments were purified and inserted in the NcoI site of plasmid pPHaeShort. Plasmids pPEcSODHis and pPXSODBHis, expressing Escherichia coli andXenopus laevis Cu,Zn-SODs fused to the 22 N-terminal residues from H. ducreyi Cu,Zn-SODs, were obtained by inserting a DNA fragment obtained by amplification with HduFor1 and HduRevL into the HindIII and NcoI sites of pPEcSOD81A (28Battistoni A. Folcarelli S. Gabbianelli R. Capo C. Rotilio G. Biochem. J. 1996; 320: 713-716Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar) and pPXSODB (29Battistoni A. Mazzetti A.P. Rotilio G. FEBS Lett. 1999; 413: 313-316Crossref Scopus (21) Google Scholar). The complete nucleotide sequences of all the PCR amplified DNA fragments were checked by the dideoxy chain termination method. Overexpression of the different Cu,Zn-SODs was carried out in 71/18 E. colicells (30Messing J. Gronenborn B. Muller-Hill B. Hans-Hopschneider P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 3642-3646Crossref PubMed Scopus (476) Google Scholar) grown at 37 °C in Luria Bertani broth (LB) containing 100 µg/ml ampicillin. When cells reached an A 600of 0.5, cultures were supplemented with 0.2 mmisopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside, 0.25 mmCuSO4, and 10 µm ZnSO4. The periplasmic fraction was prepared as described previously (19Battistoni A. Folcarelli S. Cervone L. Polizio F. Desideri A. Giartosio A. Rotilio G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 5655-5661Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Wild type and mutant enzymes were purified by immobilized metal affinity chromatography on a nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid (NTA) resin (Qiagen). The column was equilibrated with a buffer containing 300 mmNaCl and 50 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.8 (buffer A). Proteins bound to the resin were eluted by washing the column sequentially with 2–4 volumes of buffer A supplemented with 10, 20, 40, 80, and 250 mm imidazole. Fractions were analyzed by denaturing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE). The same procedure was used to test the affinity of Cu,Zn-SOD for different metal ions on an iminodiacetic acid (IDA) resin, charged with nickel, copper, zinc, cadmium, or cobalt according to the manufacturer's instructions (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Cu,Zn-SOD samples purified by immobilized metal affinity chromatography were analyzed for their metal content using the PerkinElmer Life Sciences spectrometer AAnalyst 300 equipped with the graphite furnace HGA-800. No significant nickel contamination was found in Cu,Zn-SODs purified from Ni-NTA, whereas the enzymes purified from IDA exhibited severe metal contamination. After affinity purification on Ni-NTA columns, samples containing wild type Cu,Zn-SODs (usually >90% pure) were concentrated and subjected to gel filtration chromatography on a HiLoadTM 16/60 SuperdexTM FPLC column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Wild type H. ducreyi Cu,Zn-SOD purified from 71/18 was not suitable for a spectral analysis of copper binding (31Pacello F. Langford P.R. Kroll J.S. Indiani C. Smulevich G. Desideri A. Rotilio G. Battistoni A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 30326-30334Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Therefore, for this purpose, the enzyme was expressed in H500 E. coli cells (32Nakayashiki K. Nishimura K. Tanaka R. Inokuchi H. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1995; 249: 139-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar) and purified by the procedure described above. To purify truncated proteins lacking N-terminal histidines (obtained from E. coli 71/18 cells harboring pJSK326 or pPHpSOD-3), periplasmic extracts were concentrated and dialyzed against 10 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.0, and fractionated onto a Whatman DE52 column equilibrated with the same buffer. Fractions containing Cu,Zn-SOD were pooled, concentrated, and dialyzed against 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.0, 0.15 m NaCl and injected onto a High Load 16/60 Superdex 75 gel filtration FPLC column and eluted with the same buffer. As a final step, the enzymes were further dialyzed against 20 mm potassium phosphate, pH 6.5, and subjected to ion exchange chromatography on a Mono-S HR 5/5 FPLC column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) equilibrated with the same buffer, using a 0–0.1 m NaCl gradient. Whereas the H. parainfluenzae mutant eluted in a single peak containing the pure enzyme, the H. ducreyi mutant eluted in two major peaks, one of which corresponded to the heme-containing enzyme (31Pacello F. Langford P.R. Kroll J.S. Indiani C. Smulevich G. Desideri A. Rotilio G. Battistoni A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 30326-30334Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). This Cu,Zn-SOD form was discarded, and the heme-lacking protein was subjected to a second round of ion exchange chromatography under identical conditions. All purified proteins were concentrated and dialyzed against 10 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.0. Protein concentration was determined by the Lowry method (33Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.J. Farr A.L Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The zinc and copper content of purified Cu,Zn-SOD samples was verified by atomic absorption. The metal content of enzymes purified from metal enriched media was variable from one preparation to another. On average, the copper content of wild type H. parainfluenzae and H. ducreyi enzymes was between 1 and 2.5 copper ions/subunit, whereas zinc content was between 1.3 and 1.8 zinc ions/subunit. The metal content of these samples was diminished by treatment with EDTA (followed by dialysis), indicating that a significant fraction of these metal ions is loosely bound on the enzyme surface. Mutant enzymes contained lower amounts of both metals. H. ducreyi Cu,Zn-SOD (0.25 mg/ml) was dissolved in 50 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 8.0, and incubated at 20 °C in the presence of increasing amounts of proteinase K (proteinase K/Cu,Zn-SOD ratios were between 0.01 and 1%). At different times aliquots were withdrawn, and the proteolytic digestion was stopped by boiling the sample in 2% SDS, 5% mercaptoethanol. A similar procedure was used for trypsin digestion, but in this case the reaction was carried out in ammonium bicarbonate buffer at 37 °C. Samples from limited proteolysis experiments were subjected to SDS-PAGE on 15% gels and electrotransferred onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Immobilon P, Millipore). Protein bands were visualized by Coomassie Blue staining, excised from the membrane, and subjected to several cycles of automated Edman degradation performed with a model 473A pulsed liquid sequencer (Applied Biosystems) with an on-line analyzer of phenylthiohydantoin amino acids. Copper-free Cu,Zn-SODs were prepared following a procedure described previously (34Rigo A. Viglino P. Bonori M. Cocco D. Calabrese L. Rotilio G. Biochem. J. 1977; 161: 27-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Briefly, the enzymes were treated with excess potassium ferrocyanide to reduce copper and then dialyzed for 12–24 h at 4 °C against 0.1 m potassium phosphate buffer, 50 µm KCN, pH 6.0. The samples were further dialyzed twice for 24 h at 4 °C against phosphate buffer to remove KCN. The metal content of copper-free proteins was evaluated by atomic absorption spectroscopy. The final copper content of samples used for reconstitution experiments contained between 0.3 and 0.6% of the initial value, whereas no significant loss of zinc was observed. Reconstitution experiments were carried out by adding stoichiometric or sub-stoichiometric amounts of CuCl2 to the copper-free SOD dissolved in water at 25 or 37 °C. The reconstitution process was monitored spectrophometrically by registering protein absorption in the visible region as a function of time with a PerkinElmer Life Sciences Lambda 2 spectrophotometer thermostated at 25 or 37 °C, using 1-cm path length cuvettes. In these experiments Cu,Zn-SODs were dissolved at a concentration of 2.5 × 10−4m. The rate of copper binding at the active site was also evaluated by measuring the increase in catalytic activity following the addition of copper to copper-free Cu,Zn-SODs dissolved in water. Reconstitution experiments at copper/subunit ratios below or equal to 1 were carried out by adding variable amounts of proteins to a 5.8 × 10−7m copper solution. Reconstitution experiments at higher copper/subunit ratios were obtained by adding the proteins (at a final concentration of 2.9 × 10−7m) to copper solutions of higher concentrations. The activity assays were carried out by the pyrogallol method (35Marklund S. Marklund G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1974; 47: 469-474Crossref PubMed Scopus (8034) Google Scholar). To rule out a possible contribution to enzyme activity of copper bound outside the active site, 0.1 mm EDTA was added to the assay buffer. The percent activity values were obtained by the ratio between the activity of reconstituted enzymes and that of an equal amount of fully reconstituted Cu,Zn-SODs. All the activity values obtained during reconstitution experiments were corrected by subtracting the contribution to activity of residual copper present in copper-free proteins. Fully metallated H. parainfluenzae and mutant H. parainfluenzae andH. ducreyi enzymes showed nearly identical activity values. An approximate activity value for the fully reconstituted wild typeH. ducreyi enzyme was obtained using as a standard the reconstituted N-terminal deleted mutant. The mouse macrophage-like cell line J774 and the human macrophage-like line THP-1 were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum in an atmosphere of 5% CO2. 3 h before the experiments the THP-1 cell suspension was supplemented with 1 µg/ml phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate. Macrophage cell concentration was adjusted to 2 × 107 cells/ml for killing experiments. E. coli GC4468 cells (36Carlioz A. Touati D. EMBO J. 1986; 5: 623-630Crossref PubMed Scopus (611) Google Scholar) expressing either wild type or mutant (devoid of N-terminal histidines) H. parainfluenzaeand H. ducreyi Cu,Zn-SODs were grown overnight at 37 °C in LB medium or in LB supplemented with 0.25 mmCuSO4 and 10 µm ZnSO4. After growth cells were washed three times in phosphate-buffered solution without Ca2+ and Mg2+. The bacterial cell concentration was then adjusted to 1 × 108 cells/ml in phosphate-buffered solution without Ca2+ and Mg2+. Before presentation to macrophages, microorganisms were pre-opsonized by exposing 2 × 107 bacteria (200 µl) to 50 µl of fresh pooled serum plus 750 µl of phosphate-buffered saline (pH 7.4), for 25 min at 37 °C with moderate agitation. 200 µl (∼2 × 106) of opsonized bacteria were added to a mixture of 5% fresh serum (40 µl), phosphate-buffered solution (560 µl), and 200 µl of culture medium with or without macrophages (4 × 106). 100-µl samples were withdrawn at 0, 30, 60, and 90 min in order to determine bacterial survival in serum and in macrophages by counting colony-forming units in trypticase soy agar (Oxoid). The number of surviving bacteria was obtained from at least three independent experiments. In each experiment, the macrophage killing assay was done in triplicate. Fig. 1 shows an alignment of the amino acid sequences of 10 Cu,Zn-SODs from Gram-negative bacteria, which includes the four enzymes whose three-dimensional structures have been solved and a few other enzyme variants that are expected to possess a similar structure (15Bordo D. Matak D. Djinovic-Carugo K. Rosano C. Pesce A. Bolognesi M. Stroppolo M.E. Falconi M. Battistoni A. Desideri A. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 285: 283-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Some of these enzymes, namely those from the mucosal colonists and pathogensH. ducreyi, H. parainfluenzae, H. influenzae, N. meningitidis, and Actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae, show two features that were ignored during previous analyses; they are characterized by an unusually large number of histidine residues (which in the case of the H. ducreyiand A. pleuropneumoniae enzymes approximates the 10% of total residues) and by amino acid extensions at their N-terminal sequence. These N-terminal extensions are of variable length and display low sequence identity, but all of them initiate with a cluster of histidines (2–4 residues) interspersed with negatively charged residues. Similar His-rich regions have been found in several other proteins able to bind nickel, zinc, or other transition metals. These proteins include UreE from Klebsiella aerogenes (37Lee M.H.

For some of these proteins, it has been shown that the His-rich region is directly involved in metal binding, suggesting that the N-terminal sequence found in some bacterial Cu,Zn-SOD may represent a protein domain able to bind divalent metals. Cu,Zn-SODs are in general very stable enzymes, highly resistant to protease digestion. However, we found that preparations of the H. ducreyi enzyme underwent rapid fragmentation, accumulating a maj"

Overexpression of calreticulin correlates with (i) increased cell adhesiveness, (ii) increased expression of N-cadherin and vinculin, and (iii) decreased protein phosphorylation on tyrosine. Among proteins that are dephosphorylated in cells that overexpress calreticulin is β-catenin, a structural component of cadherin-dependent adhesion complexes, a member of the armadillo family of proteins and a part of the Wnt signaling pathway. We postulate that the changes in cell adhesiveness may be due to calreticulin-mediated effects on a signaling pathway from the endoplasmic reticulum, which impinges on the Wnt signaling pathwayvia the cadherin/catenin protein system and involves changes in the activity of protein-tyrosine kinases and/or phosphatases.

Molinari M. Helenius A. Science. 1999; 286: 1882-1888Crossref PubMed Scopus (1064) Google Scholar). It is also an important site for the storage and release of Ca2+ (2Meldolesi J. Pozzan T. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1998; 23: 10-14Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (450) Google Scholar). In fact, the ER is the major signal transducing organelle within the cell, continuously responding to extracellular stimuli by releasing Ca2+ (3Pozzan T. Rizzuto R. Volpe P. Meldolesi J. Physiol. Rev. 1994; 74: 595-636Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 4Clapham D.E. Cell. 1995; 80: 259-268Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2263) Google Scholar). The ER is also sensitive to intracellular signaling; in response to a variety of stimuli signals are transduced from the ER to the cytoplasm, the plasma membrane, and the nucleus, and they affect a variety of cellular activities including Ca2+ influx, protein folding, and synthesis, cholesterol synthesis, and transcription (5McMillan A. Gething M.-J. Sambrook J. Curr. Opin. Biotech. 1994; 6: 540-545Crossref Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 6Pahl H.L. Baeuerle P.A. Trends Biochem.

Signaling from the extracellular space to the cell interior has long been the subject of intense research. In contrast, little is known about intracellular signaling from the ER. The lumen of the ER is a unique environment, which contains a high concentration of Ca2+-binding chaperones (2Meldolesi J. Pozzan T. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1998; 23: 10-14Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (450) Google Scholar). Calreticulin, a major Ca2+-binding protein resident in the ER, is ubiquitous in eukaryotic cells (9Michalak M. Corbett E.F. Mesaeli N. Nakamura K. Opas M. Biochem. J. 1999; 344: 281-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (671) Google Scholar). It functions as a molecular chaperone (10Helenius A. Trombetta E.S. Hebert D.N. Simons J.F. Trends Cell Biol. 1997; 7: 193-200Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (345) Google Scholar, 11Saito Y. Ihara Y. Leach M.R. Cohen-Doyle M.F. Williams D.B. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 6718-6729Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar) and also participates in ER-dependent Ca2+homeostasis (2Meldolesi J. Pozzan T. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1998; 23: 10-14Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (450) Google Scholar, 9Michalak M. Corbett E.F. Mesaeli N. Nakamura K. Opas M. Biochem. J. 1999; 344: 281-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (671) Google Scholar). Calreticulin also affects processes external to the ER, such as steroid-sensitive gene expression and cell adhesiveness (12Johnson S. Michalak M. Opas M. Eggleton P. Trends Cell Biol. 2001; 11: 122-129Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar). Although the Ca2+ storage and chaperone functions of calreticulin are consistent with its localization to the lumen of the ER and with its structure, it is not obvious how it can affect cell adhesiveness at the level of the plasma membrane. To investigate the mechanisms behind calreticulin-dependent modulation of cell adhesiveness, we used well characterized mouse L fibroblasts differentially expressing calreticulin (13Burns K. Duggan B. Atkinson E.A. Famulski K.S. Nemer M. Bleackley R.C. Michalak M. Nature. 1994; 367: 476-480Crossref PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar, 14Mery L. Mesaeli N. Michalak M. Opas M. Lew D.P.

Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 1913-1923Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Here we show that stable overexpression of full-length, ER-targeted calreticulin correlates with an increased adhesiveness in transformed fibroblasts, such that their cohesion resembles that of epithelial cells in culture. We also show that changes in the expression of calreticulin affect the tyrosine phosphorylation of cellular proteins, including β-catenin. β-Catenin is a structural component of cadherin-mediated adhesion complexes and is also a part of the Wnt signaling pathway (16Hatzfeld M. Int. Rev. Cytol. 1999; 186: 179-224Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We found that calreticulin, from the lumen of the ER, influences tyrosine phosphorylation of β-catenin, resulting in the modulation of cell adhesiveness. We suggest that calreticulin may play a role in a signaling pathway from the ER (8Kaufman R.J. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 1211-1233Crossref PubMed Scopus (1930) Google Scholar), involving protein-tyrosine kinases and/or phosphatases. Stably transfected lines of mouse L fibroblasts were generated as previously described (13Burns K. Duggan B. Atkinson E.A. Famulski K.S. Nemer M. Bleackley R.C. Michalak M. Nature. 1994; 367: 476-480Crossref PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar). Briefly, to construct the calreticulin expression vector, theDraI/SmaI restriction DNA fragment (nucleotides 20–1653) of pcDx-calreticulin (GenBankTM accession numberJ05138) was first inserted into the SmaI-digested pSVL vector to generate pSCR-1. Next, the full-length calreticulin cDNA was excised from the pSCR-1 and cloned into the XbaI site of the pRc/CMV vector. Two constructs were generated and designated pRCR-DT-1 and pRCR-DT-2, which contain calreticulin cDNA in the sense and antisense orientations, respectively (13Burns K. Duggan B. Atkinson E.A. Famulski K.S. Nemer M. Bleackley R.C. Michalak M. Nature. 1994; 367: 476-480Crossref PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar). These vectors were used to stably transfect L fibroblasts. For transfections, all plasmids were purified using Mega-plasmid preparation and Qiagen columns as recommended by the manufacturer. Mouse L fibroblasts were transfected with 20 mg of pRCR-DT-1, pRCR-DT-2, or pRc/CMV plasmid, by electroporation (1500 V/cm, 25 millifarad). The cells were then selected for resistance to geneticin (200 mg/ml) for 14 days. The clones obtained were then screened for expression of calreticulin. Two cell lines expressed elevated (∼2.0-fold, referred to as calreticulin overexpressers) and reduced (0.5-fold, referred to as calreticulin underexpressers) levels of calreticulin as determined by Western blot analyses (see Fig.1 A). These two cell lines, together with a mock-transfected L fibroblast cell line (transfected with pRc/CMV vector and referred to as control) were recloned by a limiting dilution method and used in the present report. The cells were grown in high glucose Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Life Technologies, Inc.) and geneticin (Sigma) as previously described (15Opas M. Szewczenko-Pawlikowski M. Jass G.K. Mesaeli N. Michalak M. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 1913-1923Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). For aggregation assays, 106 cells were plated in tissue culture dishes (100-mm diameter) and grown for 72 h. To prepare single cell suspensions, the cells were detached from the plates by treatment with EDTA-free trypsin, followed by scrubbing with a rubber policeman and pipetting several times. Trypsin was inactivated by adding fetal bovine serum, and the cells were then centrifuged, resuspended in medium, and plated in bacteriological dishes. The dishes were shaken for 48 h on an orbital shaker in a cell culture incubator (5% CO2, 37 °C) at a constant speed of 50 cycles/min. The cell aggregates were then sized and counted. For motility assays, cells were plated at a density of ∼250,000 cells/60-mm cell culture dish. Time lapse recording, cell tracking, average cell velocity calculations, and morphometry were done as described previously (15Opas M. Szewczenko-Pawlikowski M. Jass G.K. Mesaeli N. Michalak M. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 1913-1923Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Wound closure rates were calculated as the time required for cells to cover a 3-mm-wide wound in cell monolayer. For the induction of calreticulin with thapsigargin (Sigma), cells were plated at a density of 2 × 105/3.5-cm dish and allowed to attach overnight. After changing the medium, the cells were incubated with thapsigargin (100 nm or 1 µm) for 16 h. Semi-quantitative reverse transcription-PCR was carried out as follows. The cDNA was synthesized with a first strand cDNA synthesis kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), using duplicate samples of 200 ng of total RNA and random hexamers. The first strand reactions were diluted to a volume of 200 µl with nuclease-free water (Promega). 3 µl of the cDNA solution was used in the subsequent PCR. Each PCR reaction was performed in 50 µl of 10 mm Tris, pH 8.3, with 50 mm KCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 0.2 mm dNTPs, l µCi of [α-32P]dCTP (DuPont Canada Inc.), and 250 ng of the appropriate primer, both forward and reverse. The following N-cadherin-specific primers were used: N-cadherin forward, 5′-CAAGAGCTTGTCAGAATCAGG-3′ (nucleotides 864–884); N-cadherin reverse, 5′-CATTTGGATCATCCGCATC-3′ (nucleotides 1209–1227); hypoxanthine phosphoribosyltransferase forward, 5′-CCTGCTGGATTACATTAAAGCACTG-3′ (nucleotides 16–340); and hypoxanthine phosphoribosyltransferase reverse, 5′-GTTCAAGGGCATATCCAACAACAAAC-3′ (nucleotides 643–667). The PCR was carried out by 30 cycles of preheating at 99 °C for 30 s, annealing at 55–60 °C for 45 s, and extending at 72 °C for 1 min. The PCR products were resolved by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (6% acrylamide). The gels were dried and exposed to a storage phosphorus screen (Molecular Dynamics). The radioactive signal produced by the labeled PCR products was quantified using a Molecular Dynamics PhosphorImager. In each sample, levels of N-cadherin PCR products were normalized to the levels of PCR products from the housekeeping gene hypoxanthine phosphoribosyltransferase (17Melton D.W. Konecki D.S. Brennand J. Caskey C.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1984; 81: 2147-2151Crossref PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar). The mean and standard error was calculated, and the levels in different samples were compared by analysis of variance. The antibodies used for immunodetection were as follows. A well characterized goat polyclonal anti-calreticulin antibody (18Opas M. Dziak E. Fliegel L. Michalak M. J. Cell. Physiol. 1991; 149: 160-171Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar) was used to detect calreticulin and a rabbit polyclonal antibody against C-terminal amino acids of chick N-cadherin (“pan-cadherin” from Sigma) was used to detect N-cadherin (19Geiger B. Volberg T. Ginsberg D. Bitzur S. Sabanay I. Hynes R.O. J. Cell Sci. 1990; 97: 607-614Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Anti-αv and anti-β3 integrins were from Santa Cruz, anti-β1 integrin was from Dr. M. Ginsberg (Scripps Research Institute), and anti-α5 and anti-β1 integrins were from Dr. B. Chan (University of Western Ontario). Mouse monoclonal antibodies against phosphotyrosine (clone PY20, Santa Cruz), α-catenin and pp125 focal adhesion kinase (Transduction Laboratories), β-catenin (Sigma), vinculin (ICN ImmunoBiologicals, Montreal, Canada), talin (Sigma), and rabbit polyclonal antibodies against α-actinin were used to detect their respective proteins. The rabbit anti-calnexin antibodies were purchased from StressGen. All secondary antibodies were from Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories (West Grove, PA). For Western blotting, cells were homogenized in ice-cold lysis buffer (50 mmTris-HCl, 120 mm NaCl, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, pH 8.0), boiled for 5 min, subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and then transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. Immunoprecipitations were performed on cellular lysates before SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, as described by Ozawa and Kemler (20Ozawa M. Kemler R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 6166-6170Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). Nitrocellulose membranes were incubated with primary antibodies for 1 h at room temperature followed by incubation with appropriate horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies (Jackson Immunoresearch). Immunoreactive bands were detected using enhanced chemiluminescence (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Some nitrocellulose membranes were stripped by a 30-min incubation in a solution of 100 mm2-mercaptoethanol, 2% SDS, and 62.5 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.7, at 50 °C. The protein bands in each blot were scanned using a densitometer, and the areas under the curves were calculated using Gel Scan XL software. The mean and standard error of samples for each protein from each cell line was calculated, and the levels from each sample were compared by analysis of variance. Immunofluorescence confocal microscopy was carried out as previously described (15Opas M. Szewczenko-Pawlikowski M. Jass G.K. Mesaeli N. Michalak M. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 1913-1923Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar) on a Bio-Rad MRC-600 confocal fluorescence microscope. Western blotting (Fig.1 A) showed that calreticulin overexpressers expressed ∼2.0-fold elevated levels of calreticulin, whereas calreticulin underexpressers expressed 0.5-fold reduced levels of calreticulin, compared with control, mock-transfected L fibroblasts. Functionally, in a single cell suspension under constant shear stress, cells overexpressing calreticulin aggregated more efficiently than either cells underexpressing calreticulin or control mock-transfected cells (Fig. 1 B). No significant difference in the distribution profile of aggregate sizes was detected between these cell lines. In an in vitro scrape wound closure assay, calreticulin overexpressers closed a 3-mm-wide wound in less than 72 h, which is 2.5 times faster than the underexpressers (170–190 h) and ∼2 times faster than the control mock-transfected cells (120–160 h). Importantly, in this assay, calreticulin overexpressers migrated like an epithelial sheet, maintaining intercellular contacts and a well defined leading edge of cell monolayer, whereas calreticulin underexpressers dissociated early from the wound edge and migrated independently (Fig. 1 C). In comparison, both wild type (parent) and control cells exhibited intermediate monolayer migration patterns. Thus, phenomenologically, changes in cell adhesiveness parallel alterations in the level of expression of calreticulin. Reverse transcription-PCR established that it is N-cadherin that is likely the cell surface protein responsible for the increased intercellular adhesiveness of L fibroblasts overexpressing calreticulin. Semi-quantitative Western blot and reverse transcription-PCR analysis showed that amounts of the protein N-cadherin and its mRNA were elevated in calreticulin overexpressers, ∼2-fold and ∼12-fold, respectively (Fig.2, A and B). The Western blot and RT-PCR data were further supported by immunofluorescence labeling of cells with anti-cadherin antibodies (Fig. 2, C–F). Calreticulin underexpressers did not attach to each other, had few cadherin-positive intercellular junctions, and showed a tendency to multilayer. In contrast, calreticulin overexpressers flattened out and, by developing abundant cadherin-rich intercellular junctions, formed a flat monolayer that closely resembled an epithelial cell sheet. The formation of a monolayer by calreticulin overexpressers is especially evident with optical sectioning along the optical axis of the microscope (XZ sectioning). Control cells formed scattered cadherin-positive intercellular contacts. Cadherin-positive intercellular contacts were also prominent in an optical cross-section of an aggregate of calreticulin overexpressers (Fig. 2 F). With Western blotting we detected no changes in the abundance of actin, α5 and β1 integrins (i.e.fibronectin receptor), αv and β3 integrins (i.e. vitronectin receptor), pp125 focal adhesion kinase, talin, α-actinin, and α- and β-catenins (Fig.3 B). It should be noted that, in our L fibroblast cell lines, the expression level of αvβ3 integrin was very low compared with that of α5β1 integrin. In keeping with earlier findings (15Opas M. Szewczenko-Pawlikowski M. Jass G.K. Mesaeli N. Michalak M. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 1913-1923Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar, 21Fadel M.P. Dziak E. Lo C.M. Ferrier J. Mesaeli N. Michalak M. Opas M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 15085-15094Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar), the amounts of vinculin and its mRNA were elevated in calreticulin overexpressers and reduced in calreticulin underexpressers (Fig. 3 A). The induction of vinculin in the calreticulin overexpressers was accompanied by its translocation to junctional areas when the cells packed to form cell sheets (not shown). Finally, using Western blotting we detected no changes in the expression of SERCA2, the inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptor (not shown), immunoglobulin-binding protein, calnexin, ERp57, ERp72, GRP 94, and protein-disulfide isomerase in extracts of cells that were differentially expressing calreticulin (Fig.3 C).Figure 3Western blotting shows that, except for vinculin and N-cadherin (A), changes in the level of calreticulin expression do not affect the abundance of several adhesion-related proteins (B). Also, differential expression of calreticulin does not affect the abundance of several other ER-resident proteins (C) such as SERCA2, immunoglobulin binding protein (BiP), calnexin, ERp57, ERp72, GRP 94, and protein-disulfide isomerase (PDI).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) In L fibroblasts overexpressing calreticulin, the level of protein phosphorylation on tyrosine was decreased compared with that in control cells and substantially increased in cells that were underexpressing calreticulin (Fig. 4 A). To determine whether these differences were specifically related to the altered calreticulin levels, we studied the effect of induction of calreticulin on protein tyrosine phosphorylation. The calreticulin promoter is activated by exposure of cells to either the Ca2+ ionophore A23187 or the ER Ca2+-ATPase inhibitor, thapsigargin (22Waser M. Mesaeli N. Spencer C. Michalak M. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 138: 547-557Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). Both of these agents cause depletion of Ca2+ in the lumen of the ER (23Pressman B.C. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1976; 45: 501-530Crossref PubMed Scopus (1452) Google Scholar, 24Thastrup O. Cullen P.J. Drobak B.K. Hanley M.R. Dawson A.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 2466-2470Crossref PubMed Scopus (2998) Google Scholar), and this leads to increased levels of both calreticulin mRNA and calreticulin itself, via de novo protein synthesis (22Waser M. Mesaeli N. Spencer C. Michalak M. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 138: 547-557Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar, 25Llewellyn D.H. Kendall J.M. Sheikh F.N. Campbell A.K. Biochem.

Fig.4 B shows that induction of calreticulin by treatment with thapsigargin resulted in decreased phosphotyrosine levels in the treated cells. These results indicate that increased expression of calreticulin, whether resulting from genetic manipulation of cells or from the ER stress, is accompanied by changes in the level of tyrosine phosphorylation of cellular proteins. In adherens-type junctional complexes cadherins link to the actin cytoskeleton via proteins of the catenin family (27Gumbiner B.M. McCrea P.D. J. Cell Sci. 1993; 106 Suppl, 17: 155-158Crossref Google Scholar, 28Aberle H. Schwartz H. Kemler R. J. Cell. Biochem. 1996; 61: 514-523Crossref PubMed Scopus (717) Google Scholar, 29Barth A.I. Näthke I.S. Nelson W.J. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 683-690Crossref PubMed Scopus (485) Google Scholar). It appears that both the localization and function of β-catenin depend on its degree of tyrosine phosphorylation (30Papkoff J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 4536-4543Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 31Provost E. Rimm D.L. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1999; 11: 567-572Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar), although the mechanisms are still unclear (32Gumbiner B.M. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 148: 399-403Crossref PubMed Scopus (688) Google Scholar). To determine whether the tyrosine phosphorylation of β-catenin is affected by overexpression of calreticulin, we immunoprecipitated β-catenin from cell extracts and assessed its phosphotyrosine content by Western blotting with anti-phosphotyrosine antibodies. In calreticulin underexpressers, the phosphotyrosine content of β-catenin was readily detected, whereas in calreticulin overexpressers the phosphotyrosine content of β-catenin was below detection level (Fig. 4 C). To address the question of whether induction of calreticulin by the ER stress will also affect the phosphotyrosine content of β-catenin, we immunoprecipitated phosphotyrosine-containing proteins from extracts of thapsigargin-treated cells. Western blotting with antibodies to β-catenin (Fig. 4 D) shows a decrease in amount of PY-20-precipitable β-catenin from thapsigargin-treated cell extracts. Importantly, using immunofluorescence microscopy (Fig.5), we found that β-catenin, albeit barely detectable in all the cell lines, could be found in patches localized to areas of cell-cell contact in cells overexpressing calreticulin but not in the underexpressers and control cells. As previously reported (15Opas M. Szewczenko-Pawlikowski M. Jass G.K. Mesaeli N. Michalak M. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 1913-1923Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar), subconfluent calreticulin overexpressers were more spread than the other cell types (Fig. 5). Next, we asked whether a change in the level of tyrosine phosphorylation of cellular proteins could itself affect the degree of cell spreading. Fig.6 shows immunolocalization of phosphotyrosine in of calreticulin underexpressers (A,B, and C), overexpressers (A′,B′, and C′), and control cells (A“,B”, and C“). Row A shows untreated cultures, row B shows cultures treated with pervanadate (vanadate/H2O2) to inhibit tyrosine phosphatases, and row C shows cultures treated with herbimycin A to inhibit tyrosine kinases. The phosphotyrosine signal in the underexpressers was mostly cytoplasmic and strong (Fig.6 A), whereas in the overexpressers it was confined to focal adhesions and weak (Fig. 6 A′). Herbimycin A treatment lowered the cytosolic level of phosphotyrosine in all cell lines and caused all cells to spread more. Conversely, pervanadate treatment elevated the cytosolic level of phosphotyrosine in all cell lines and caused the cells to retract thus making control cells (Fig.6 B”) to look like the untreated calreticulin underexpressers shown in (Fig. 6 A). Treatment of cells with Tyrphostin A25, an inhibitor more specific for receptor-type protein-tyrosine kinases (33Levitzki A. FASEB J. 1992; 6: 3275-3282Crossref PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar), was less effective in induction of cell spreading (not shown). Morphometric analysis of the degree of spreading of treated cells is shown in Fig. 6 D. In this study we have shown that increased expression of calreticulin, a Ca2+-binding chaperone resident in the lumen of the ER, correlates with an increase in cell adhesiveness. When overexpressing calreticulin, fibroblasts (i) aggregate effectively at a shear stress, which prevents aggregation in other cell lines, and (ii) when released from contact inhibition display a pattern of mobility resembling that of epithelia. Further, cells overexpressing calreticulin have significantly decreased tyrosine phosphorylation of cellular proteins including β-catenin, a component of cadherin-based junctional complexes. Our results indicate that calreticulin can affect cell adhesiveness via alterations in tyrosine phosphorylation. Because calreticulin is resident in the lumen of the ER, its modulation of cell adhesion must involve signaling from the ER. This signaling could occur via multiple pathways, including activation of gene expression (15Opas M. Szewczenko-Pawlikowski M. Jass G.K. Mesaeli N. Michalak M. J.

Michalak M. Opas M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 15085-15094Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar and this work). Protein phosphorylation on tyrosine plays a significant role in cell adhesion (35Burridge K. Chrzanowska-Wodnicka M. Zhong C.L. Trends Cell Biol. 1997; 7: 342-347Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar, 36Daniel J.M. Reynolds A.B. BioEssays. 1997; 19: 883-891Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar). Therefore, calreticulin-dependent alteration of tyrosine phosphorylation may represent a novel pathway via which the ER signals to the plasma membrane to modulate cell adhesiveness. In this study, we have shown that the reduced phosphorylation of tyrosine in cells that overexpress calreticulin is not an artifact of transfection, because a similar reduction is seen in untransfected parental cells (Fig. 1 E) and in NIH3T3 cells (not shown) when calreticulin expression is induced by exposure to thapsigargin (22Waser M. Mesaeli N. Spencer C. Michalak M. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 138: 547-557Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). This conclusion is further supported by the observation that, in a Tet-on inducible HeLa cell line (in which a calreticulin gene is controlled by a promoter dependent on doxycycline-controlled transactivator), increased expression of calreticulin caused a similar decrease in tyrosine phosphorylation of proteins (not shown). Also, we have recently shown that retinal pigmented epithelial cells, which overexpressed calreticulin, had lower levels of tyrosine phosphorylation, compared with calreticulin underexpressing cells (21Fadel M.P.

Although the mechanisms are still unclear, protein phosphorylation on appears to regulate the stability and, possibly, function, of cell adhesions (31Provost E. Rimm D.L. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1999; 11: 567-572Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar, 32Gumbiner B.M. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 148: 399-403Crossref PubMed Scopus (688) Google Scholar). It must be stressed, however, that the effects of tyrosine phosphorylation on junctional function are very dynamic, may be transient, and are often cell type-dependent (37Ayalon O. Geiger B. J. Cell Sci. 1997; 110: 547-556PubMed Google Scholar, 38Lampugnani M.G. Corada M. Andriopoulou P. Esser S. Risau W. Dejana E. J.

The viral genome is a positive polarity single-stranded polyadenylated RNA molecule of ∼7.4 kilobases, with a virus genome-linked protein (VPg) covalently attached to its 5′-end (4Meyers G.

Seven of the eight necessary cleavage sites have been demonstrated experimentally. Amino acid sequencing studies carried out first in thePrimate calicivirus Pan-1 (10Dunham D.M. Jiang X. Berke T. Smith A.W. Matson D.O. Arch. Virol. 1998; 143: 2421-2430Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar) and more recently inFeline calicivirus (11Sosnovtsev S.V. Green K.Y. Virology. 2000; 277: 193-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar), together with point mutant studies performed in the RHDV system (9Meyers G. Wirblich C. Thiel H.J. Thumfart J.O. Virology. 2000; 276: 349-363Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar) have allowed the identification of the N-terminal sequence of a few calicivirus VPg proteins as well as the genome mapping of their coding regions. Nevertheless, since the first description of a VPg on a calicivirus RNA (12Burroughs J.N. Brown F. J. Gen. Virol. 1978; 41: 443-446Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar), functional studies on this viral protein and the identification of the amino acid residues putatively involved in RNA linkage are still lacking. In the poliovirus system, a closely related type of viruses, VPg has been found to be a 22-amino acid residue peptide that is genome-linked by a bond between the O4 of tyrosine and the 5′-P atom of the terminal uridylic acid residue (13Rothberg P.G. Harris T.J. Nomoto A. Wimmer E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1978; 75: 4868-4872Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). It has been recently found that poliovirus VPg uridylylation was mediated by the RNA polymerase 3Dpol of the virus in a poly(A)-dependent reaction (14Paul A.V. van Boom J.H. Filippov D. Wimmer E. Nature. 1998; 393: 280-284Crossref PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar, 15Paul A.V. Rieder E. Kim D.W. van Boom J.H. Wimmer E. J. Virol. 2000; 74: 10359-10370Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar). The VPg of RHDV is a larger protein of 115 amino acid residues showing no significant sequence homologies to that of polioviruses. Nevertheless, considering the similarities found between these two types of viruses concerning their genomic organization and catalytic properties of viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerases (16López Vázquez A. Martı́n Alonso J.M. Casais R. Boga J.A. Parra F. J. Virol. 1998; 72: 2999-3004Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 17López Vázquez A. Martı́n Alonso J.M. Parra F. J.

Virol. 2001; 146: 59-69Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar), it is tempting to hypothesize that VPg could play a similar role in RHDV genome synthesis initiation and that a tyrosine residue could be involved in the VPg-genome linkage. The RHDV VPg coding region was cloned as a BamHI-EcoRI cassette by PCR amplification of RHDV cDNA using the sense oligonucleotide 3B5a (Table I) containing a BamHI restriction endonuclease site and the antisense oligonucleotide 3B3, which added a unique EcoRI site at the 3′-end of the amplified region. The 3B5a primer also included four nucleotide substitutions that cause a Val to Ser point mutation at residue 2 of the recombinant RHDV VPg. This was done to enable accurate thrombin cleavage of the GST-VPg fusion protein just before the authentic Gly N-terminal residue of VPg without the addition of unwanted amino acid extensions to the recombinant product. In this way a 351-base pair DNA fragment, corresponding to nucleotide residues 2988 to 3333 of the Spanish AST/98 RHDV isolate (GenBankTM/EMBL accession number Z49271), was amplified (Fig. 1A) and cloned into the pGEM-T vector (Promega). After digestion of the recombinant plasmid withBamHI and EcoRI, the resulting 351-base pair fragment was purified and inserted intoBamHI-EcoRI-digested expression vector pGEX-2T (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) to generate the recombinant plasmid pGEX-VPg. This expression vector included the VPg coding region fused in frame to the 3′ end of the Schistosoma japonicumglutathione S-transferase (GST) gene.Table IOligonucleotides used for RHDV VPg cloning, mutagenesis and in vitro transcription of positive and negative genomic and subgenomic viral RNAOligonucleotideSequence1-aLowercase boldface characters indicate the mutations made with respect to the wild type RHDV AST/89 sequence (GenBank™/EMBL accession number Z49271).

For point mutant construction directed to the VPg Tyr-21 residue, the BamHI-EcoRI fragment from pGEX-VPg plasmid was transferred into the BamHI-EcoRI sites of pBluescript SK(+) vector, originating recombinant plasmid pSKVPg. This construct was used to perform in vitrosite-directed mutagenesis using specific antisense mutagenic oligonucleotide primers (Table I) by the Chameleon double-stranded site-directed mutagenesis method (Stratagene) following the manufacturer's instructions. The resulting mutantBamHI-EcoRI DNA fragments were separately inserted into the BamHI-EcoRI-digested pGEX-2T expression vectors. Each of the mutated constructs was checked by nucleotide sequencing and then transformed into E. coli BL21 cells for point mutant VPg production. Positive and negative sense genomic and subgenomic RNAs were synthesized by in vitro transcription of purified PCR fragments to which a modified T7 promoter was added using the appropriate primers (Table I). Amplifications of viral RNA (RHDV isolate AST/89) were made using the Expand Long Template PCR System (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) following the manufacturer's protocol. The PCR fragments used to produce full-length positive (gRNA+) or negative sense genomic RNA (gRNA−) were made using primer pairs RHDV2/RHDV1 and RHDV4/RHDV5, respectively (Table I). The PCR amplicons used to produce positive (sRNA+) or negative sense subgenomic RNA (sRNA−) were made using RHDV3/RHDV1 and RHDV4/RHDV6 primer pairs, respectively (Table I). RNA transcripts were synthesized from the appropriate PCR amplicons using Ribomax, the large scale RNA production system fromPromega. The positive and negative transcripts of genomic or subgenomic length were analyzed by electrophoresis on agarose gels containing formaldehyde. The recombinant GST-VPg proteins were purified from E. coli BL21 bacterial lysates by affinity chromatography using a bulk GST purification module (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The wild type or mutant VPg proteins were released from GST by thrombin cleavage and the purified recombinant proteins stored at −20 °C in 50 mmTris-HCl, pH 8.0, containing 150 mm NaCl and 0.25 mm EDTA. Purified VPg samples were analyzed by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight (MALDI-TOF) mass spectrometry and N-terminal sequencing. The wild type RHDV 3Dpol was produced in E. coli XL1-Blue from plasmid pGEX-3D as described previously (16López Vázquez A. Martı́n Alonso J.M. Casais R. Boga J.A. Parra F. J. Virol. 1998; 72: 2999-3004Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The mutant D355N RNA polymerase was also produced in E. coli XL1-Blue as described elsewhere (17López Vázquez A. Martı́n Alonso J.M. Parra F. J. Virol. 2000; 74: 3888-3891Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). SDS-PAGE analysis of the recombinant proteins was performed as described elsewhere (19Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207537) Google Scholar) using 15% polyacrylamide gels. The size markers used were the low molecular weigh markers (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and the kaleidoscope polypeptide standards (Bio-Rad). The protein concentration was determined by the Bio-Rad protein assay. The protocol used was based on that described previously for poliovirus VPg (14Paul A.V. van Boom J.H. Filippov D. Wimmer E. Nature. 1998; 393: 280-284Crossref PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar) with some modifications such as the use of MnCl2 instead of magnesium acetate (MgAcO) and the absence of an added RNA template. Briefly, the reaction mixtures (20 µl) usually contained 50 mm HEPES buffer, pH 7.5, 1 mm MnCl2, 100 µm UTP, 2 µCi of [α-32P]UTP (800 Ci mmol−1), and appropriate amounts of purified 3Dpol and VPg as indicated. Incubations were made at 30 °C, and the reactions were stopped at the indicated times (usually 60 min) by the addition of SDS-PAGE loading buffer and analyzed using polyacrylamide gels, which were finally dried and autoradiographed. [32P]UMP incorporated into the reaction products was quantified using an Instant-Imager (Packard Instrument Co.). To obtain large quantities of VPg we used the expression vector pGEX-2T, designed for inducible expression of foreign polypeptides in E. colias fusion proteins with GST. After induction with isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside, a major protein band of about 38 kDa was observed in the induced extracts corresponding to the cells transformed with the recombinant vector pGEX-VPg (Fig.1 B, lane 1). The mass of this polypeptide was in the expected range for the fusion protein GST-VPg. The 38-kDa polypeptide was retained onto a glutathione-Sepharose column (Fig. 1 B, lane 2) further supporting the possibility that this band was indeed the fusion protein. The VPg moiety was released from the carrier protein byin situ thrombin proteolysis of the fusion protein adsorbed onto the column, showing the expected molecular mass of 13 kDa (Fig.1 B, lane 3). As mentioned under “Experimental Procedures,” the recombinant polypeptide was almost identical in amino acid sequence to the authentic RHDV VPg, except that it contained a Val to Ser substitution, for accurate processing purposes, at the second residue from the N terminus of the RHDV mature VPg product. Nevertheless, the SDS-PAGE analysis of purified recombinant VPg consistently showed a double band pattern (Fig. 1 B, lane 3). This result was the consequence of a cleavage after the Lys-99 residue of recombinant VPg (data not shown) as deduced from the results of MALDI-TOF analysis performed on purified VPg samples. This cleavage was most probably caused by the presence of catalytic amounts of thrombin in the recombinant VPg preparations as a consequence of the purification procedure used. Point mutant substitutions directed to the Lys-99 residue did not completely abolished VPg processing (not shown) due to the appearance of secondary cleavage sites at alternative amino acid sequences of the recombinant products. Despite these results indicating some degree of C-terminal heterogeneity in the VPg preparations, this type of material was used in subsequent functional studies considering that VPg and its cleaved derivatives all sheared a common N-terminal sequence (not shown). This was a relevant finding considering that the residues putatively involved in VPg-genome linkage were thought to be located at the N-terminal region of VPg, based on sequence conservation among VPg from caliciviruses (20Boga J.A. Martı́n Alonso J.M. Marı́n M.S. Casais R. Vázquez A.L. Machı́n A. Parra F. Pandalay S.G. Recent Research Developments in Virology. Transworld Research Network, Trivandrum, India1999: 107-119Google Scholar). As a first step toward establishing a functional assay for RHDV VPg, we have used an uridylylation protocol described previously for poliovirus VPg (14Paul A.V. van Boom J.H. Filippov D. Wimmer E. Nature. 1998; 393: 280-284Crossref PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar). Major differences between the poliovirus protocol and the one used in this work were the use of MnCl2 instead of MgCl2 and the absence of an added poly(A) template in the reaction mixture. Under the conditions described, the recombinant RHDV VPg was radioactively labeled in the presence of [α-32P]UTP (Fig. 1 C, lane 4) and Mn2+ ions. The incorporation of labeled uridylyl residues into RHDV recombinant VPg in the absence of poly(A) RNA template was a major difference with respect to the results described previously in the poliovirus system in which the presence of poly(A) was an absolute requirement for VPg uridylylation (14Paul A.V. van Boom J.H. Filippov D. Wimmer E. Nature. 1998; 393: 280-284Crossref PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar). Our data also indicated that no radioactive products were detected in the absence of RHDV 3Dpol (Fig. 1 C, lane 5), or in the presence of the inactive 3Dpol D355N point mutant (17López Vázquez A. Martı́n Alonso J.M. Parra F. J. Virol. 2000; 74: 3888-3891Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1 C, lane 6), supporting the theory that the VPg uridylylation observed was catalyzed by the viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase and was not due to some bacterial contaminant present in the purified VPg or polymerase preparations. We have also demonstrated that the radioactivity associated to VPg was due to a true incorporation of UMP and not to a phosphorylation event because of some residual γ-32P contaminant, as deduced from the lack of radioactivity linked to VPg in the samples in which [γ-32P]UTP was used (Fig.1 C, lanes 1–3) instead of [α-32P]UTP. The presence of divalent cations is a well known requirement forin vitro RNA polymerase activity. The standard RNA polymerase assay described previously (16López Vázquez A. Martı́n Alonso J.M. Casais R. Boga J.A. Parra F. J. Virol. 1998; 72: 2999-3004Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) contained 3 mmMgAcO, also showing that concentrations above 10 mmcompletely abolished 3Dpol activity. Our previous studies demonstrated that Mg2+ in the standard RHDV 3Dpol in vitro assays could be replaced by Mn2+ giving rise to comparable radioactive precursors incorporation into products, being 0.5 mm the optimal MnCl2 concentration (18López Vázquez A. Martı́n Alonso J.M. Parra F. Arch. Virol. 2001; 146: 59-69Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Considering that VPg uridylylation was dependent on the presence of RHDV 3Dpol, several divalent ion salts were used to investigate the metal requirements of the assay. Our results indicated that the uridylylation reaction was much more efficient in the presence of 1 mm MnCl2 and could also be detected in the presence of 3.5 mm MgAcO or CoCl2 (Fig.2A), although after a much longer exposure time. These results also showed that Mn2+could not be replaced by other ions such as Zn2+ (Fig.2 A, lane 4). It should be mentioned that several nucleic acid polymerases of different origins have been shown to be more efficient in the presence of Mn2+ instead of Mg2+ (21Brooks R.R. Andersen J.A. Biochem. J. 1978; 171: 725-732Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar, 22Huang Y. Beaudry A. McSwiggen J. Sousa R. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 13718-13728Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 23Cirino N.M. Cameron C.E. Smith J.S. Rausch J.W. Roth M.J. Benkovic S.J. Le Grice S.F. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 9936-9943Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). In some cases this effect has been related to a relaxed specificity of the enzyme toward template (24Palmenberg A. Kaesberg P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1974; 71: 1371-1375Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar) or nucleotide (22Huang Y. Beaudry A. McSwiggen J. Sousa R. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 13718-13728Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 25Tabor S. Richardson C.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 4076-4080Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar) in the presence of Mn2+. More recently the preference for Mn2+over Mg2+ of the poliovirus 3Dpol has been attributed to a substantial reduction in the KMvalue of the enzyme for primer-template and to an increase in the number of the productive enzyme-primer-template complexes formed in the presence of this divalent ion (26Arnold J.J. Ghosh S.K. Cameron C.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 37060-37069Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Considering than in the poliovirus system VPg uridylylation was not observed in the absence of an RNA template and that the presence of some viral sequences, instead of a poly(A), could also additionally increase this reaction (15Paul A.V. Rieder E. Kim D.W. van Boom J.H. Wimmer E. J. Virol. 2000; 74: 10359-10370Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar), we investigated RHDV VPg uridylylation in the presence of poly(A) or synthetic genome RNA (gRNA) and subgenomic RNA (sRNA) of positive and negative polarity. The results obtained did not reveal a significant increase in VPg labeling (Fig.2 B), indicating that in the RHDV system, under the experimental conditions used, VPg uridylylation did not required the presence of an RNA template. The possibility that these results were due to a relaxed enzyme specificity as a consequence of the use of Mn2+ ions in the reaction mixture was also investigated. Nevertheless, a similar behavior was obtained in the presence of Mg2+ ions, although after much longer exposition times (not shown). The lack of a requirement for an RNA template under the conditions used for RHDV VPg uridylylation was also consistent with the finding that incorporation of the corresponding nucleotidyl residues into VPg could also be observed from any of the remaining three NTP precursors (not shown). Nevertheless, the results described in this work do not rule out the possibility that RHDV RNA-dependent RNA polymerase will eventually require a viral RNA template for optimal VPg uridylylation under improved reaction conditions. Considering these results, further biochemical characterization of the VPg uridylylation reaction was carried out using Mn2+ ions, in the absence of added RNA template. The amount of labeled VPg product synthesized in a 60-min reaction was a linear function of 3Dpol concentration from 0 to 10 µg of enzyme (data not shown). In the presence of 6 µg of 3Dpol and 2 µg of VPg, the rate of UMP incorporation into VPg was constant for about 20 min (Fig. 3A) and decreased at longer incubation times at 30 °C. Under the conditions used (6 µg of 3Dpol), the amount of UMP incorporation in 60 min was found to be a linear function of the VPg amount present in the reaction mixture up to 5 µg of the recombinant protein, showing saturation kinetics at higher concentrations of VPg (Fig.3 B). It should be noted that under these conditions the reaction yield was very low and only 0.3% of the input VPg was uridylylated. Considering that both recombinant VPg and 3Dpol were routinely purified using a buffer containing NaCl, the reaction mixture usually contained 6–15 mm NaCl, depending on the amount of protein used. Then, to optimize the uridylylation assay, we investigated the effects of increasing NaCl concentration in the reaction mixture. For this particular purpose both VPg and 3Dpol were purified using 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) in the absence of added NaCl. Using this type of protein preparation, we found that uridylylation activity was negatively affected by the increasing amounts of NaCl (Fig. 3 C). The results indicated that maximum incorporation values were obtained in the presence of up to 15 mm NaCl. As a first approach to investigating the identity of the amino acid residues involved in VPg uridylylation, we constructed two VPg deletion mutants, which lacked 21 or 24 amino acid residues from the N or C-terminal regions of recombinant VPg, respectively (Fig. 1 A). The N-terminal deletion was made by PCR amplification using oligonucleotides Δ5VPg22 and 3B3 (TableI), whereas the C-terminal deleted VPg was made using oligonucleotides 3B5a and Δ3VPg91 (Table I). The resulting amplified DNA fragments were then cloned independently into pGEM-T vectors. After digestion of the recombinant pGEM-T derivatives with BamHI and EcoRI, the DNA inserts were purified and cloned into BamHI-EcoRI-digested pGEX-2T expression plasmid to generate the recombinant vectors pGEX-Δ5VPg and pGEX-Δ3VPg. Each of the expression vectors coding for the truncated forms of VPg were transformed into E. coliBL21 cells and used for the synthesis and purification of recombinant Δ5VPg and Δ3VPg proteins. To asses the overall purity and molecular size of the resulting recombinant polypeptides, equivalent amounts of each purified protein preparation were analyzed by SDS-PAGE, and the gels were stained with Coomassie Blue. The observed molecular masses of the deleted VPg proteins were 11 and 10.5 kDa, respectively (not shown). The uridylylation reactions performed using 2 µg of purified wild type VPg and the corresponding N- and C-terminal deleted forms indicated that Δ3VPg protein was fully active, whereas Δ5VPg protein, which lacked the first 21 N-terminal residues of wild type VPg, was not radioactively labeled in the presence of 3Dpol under standard reaction conditions (Fig.4A). These data indicated that the relevant residues involved in VPg uridylylation were located near or within the N-terminal deleted region of the protein. At this point it should be noted that in poliovirus the bond between VPg and the nucleotide was found to be O4-(5′-uridylyl)tyrosine (13Rothberg P.G. Harris T.J. Nomoto A. Wimmer E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1978; 75: 4868-4872Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar, 27Ambros V. Baltimore D. J. Biol. Chem. 1978; 253: 5263-5266Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, it is tempting to predict that the tyrosine 21 located within the VPg N-terminal deletion could be the uridylylation acceptor residue of the protein. To confirm this hypothesis we made three point mutants in which Tyr-21 was substituted by Phe, a similar amino acid residue devoid of the acceptor hydroxyl group, or by Ser or Thr, to investigate the possibility that other hydroxyl amino acids could act as uridylyl acceptors. The method used to construct the mutant VPg proteins has been described under “Experimental Procedures.” To assess the overall purity and molecular size of the resulting recombinant polypeptides, each purified protein preparation was analyzed by SDS-PAGE. Equivalent amounts of the wild type and point mutant VPg proteins were used in uridylylation assays under standard conditions. The results clearly indicated that none of the point mutant VPg were radioactively labeled (Fig. 4 B), thus supporting the belief that Tyr-21 was the acceptor residue, which could not be substituted by any other hydroxyl amino acid. These data constitute the first experimental evidence on the identity of the amino acid residue involved in VPg-genome linkage in a member of the Caliciviridae family. In addition, considering the high level of sequence conservation around this Tyr residue among several representative members of different calicivirus genera (Fig.5), we also suggest that this residue could play similar roles in their respective systems. It has been shown in some members of the Caliciviridae family, such asFeline calicivirus, that VPg is not essential for infectivity, as deduced from the in vitro synthesis of an infectious RNA genome (28Sosnovtsev S. Green K.Y. Virology. 1995; 210: 383-390Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, VPg plays a crucial role in RHDV genome expression and infectivity, and no infectious transcripts could be made so far in the laboratory. Consequently, the progress made toward the understanding of this essential reaction could be invaluable in designing new approaches to investigate this highly virulent pathogen, which cannot be propagated in tissue cultures. Further studies on the in vitro mechanism of RHDV RNA replication will most possibly require the expression and purification of VPg and 3Dpol precursors, in addition to other host cell proteins that are possibly involved, as the starting point for the development of an in vitro replication system based on the reconstitution of a replicase complex from individual purified components. This approach might help in part to overcome the lack of a permissive tissue culture for RHDV. We thank Dr. L. Li (Dept. of Chemistry) and Dr. K.

https://openalex.org/W2033526561,"Src tyrosine kinase plays key roles in signal transduction following growth factor stimulation and integrin-mediated cell-substrate adhesion. Since src-signal transduction defects are implicated in a multitude of human diseases, we have sought to develop new ways to identify small molecule inhibitors using a yeast-based, activated-src over-expression system. In the present study, we describe the identification of a unique src-signal transduction inhibitor, UCS15A. UCS15A was found to inhibit the src specific tyrosine phosphorylation of numerous proteins in v-src-transformed cells. Two of these phosphoproteins were identified as bona-fide src substrates, cortactin and Sam68. UCS15A differed from conventional src-inhibitors in that it did not inhibit the tyrosine kinase activity of src. In addition, UCS15A appeared to differ from src-destabilizing agents such as herbimycin and radicicol that destabilize src by interfering with Hsp90. Our studies suggest that UCS15A exerted its src-inhibitory effects by a novel mechanism that involved disruption of protein-protein interactions mediated by src. One of the biological consequences of src-inhibition by UCS15A was its ability to inhibit the bone resorption activity of osteoclasts in vitro. These data suggest that UCS15A may inhibit the bone resorption activity of osteoclasts, not by inhibiting src tyrosine kinase activity, but by disrupting the interaction of proteins associated with src, thereby modulating downstream events in the src signal transduction pathway."

Whether CD44 interacts directly or indirectly with Lck and Fyn in this fraction is not known, and the significance of CD44 in this fraction is not understood.

Brown E.J. Immunol. Today. 1999; 20: 406-411Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar and 21Johnson P. Felberg J. Mod. Asp. Immunobiol. 2000; 1: 156-159Google Scholar). To a lesser extent, CD45 can also dephosphorylate the analogous site in Fyn. However the effects of this are less noticeable because TCR signaling and T cell activation are less affected by the absence of Fyn (22Appleby M.W. Gross J.A. Cooke M.P. Levin S.D. Qian X. Perlmutter R.M. Cell. 1992; 70: 751-763Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (444) Google Scholar, 23Stein P.L. Lee H.-M. Rich S. Soriano P. Cell. 1992; 70: 741-750Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (500) Google Scholar). Csk is a tyrosine kinase that phosphorylates Src family kinases at the negative regulatory site (24Bergman M. Mustelin T. Oetken C. Partanen J. Flint N.A. Amrein K.E. Autero M. Burn P. Alitalo K. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 2919-2924Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar) and thus phosphorylation at this site depends on the balance of CD45 and Csk activities. Under some circumstances, CD45 can dephosphorylate Lck at Tyr394, a positive regulatory site located in the activation loop of the kinase domain (reviewed in Refs.20Thomas M.L. Brown E.J. Immunol. Today. 1999; 20: 406-411Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar and 25Ashwell J.D. D'Oro U. Immunol. Today. 1999; 20: 412-416Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). This indicates that CD45 has the potential to down regulate, as well as up-regulate, Lck activity. The positive role of CD45 in regulating Lck function in TCR signaling and T cell activation is well established (reviewed in Refs. 26Alexander D.R. Semin. Immunol. 2000; 12: 349-359Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar and21Johnson P. Felberg J. Mod. Asp. Immunobiol. 2000; 1: 156-159Google Scholar). More recently, CD45 has been implicated in the regulation of integrin-induced leukocyte adhesion, which has suggested a new role for CD45 in the negative regulation of cell adhesion (reviewed in Ref. 20Thomas M.L. Brown E.J. Immunol. Today. 1999; 20: 406-411Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). CD45 was shown to negatively regulate α5β1integrin, but not α4β1, mediated adhesion to fibronectin in T cells (27Shenoi H. Seavitt J. Zheleznyak A. Thomas M.L. Brown E.J. J. Immunol. 1999; 162: 7120-7127PubMed Google Scholar). Also, in CD45− bone marrowderived macrophages, β2 integrin-mediated cell adhesion to plastic occurred more rapidly than in CD45+macrophages, but this adhesion was not sustainable (28Roach T. Slater S. Koval M. White L. Cahir McFarland E. Okumura M. Thomas M. Brown E. Curr. Biol. 1997; 7: 408-417Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). Integrin-mediated adhesion occurs at points of focal contact and signaling via integrins involves the activation of Src and focal adhesion kinases (reviewed in Refs. 29Giancotti F.G. Ruoslahti E. Science. 1999; 285: 1028-1032Crossref PubMed Scopus (3825) Google Scholar and 30Calderwood D.A. Shattil S.J. Ginsberg M.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 22607-22610Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (413) Google Scholar). In the CD45− macrophages, the Src family kinases, Hck and Lyn were found to be hyperphosphorylated at their negative regulatory site, yet were more active in an in vitro kinase assay than the dephosphorylated form present in the CD45+ cells (28Roach T. Slater S. Koval M. White L. Cahir McFarland E. Okumura M. Thomas M. Brown E. Curr. Biol. 1997; 7: 408-417Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). This suggests that CD45 may contribute to the down-regulation of these kinases in macrophages, possibly by dephosphorylation of the positive regulatory site during integrin-mediated adhesion. These hyperphosphorylated, hyperactivatable kinases may contribute to the aberrant integrin-mediated adhesion in these cells. Previous work in CD45+ and CD45− BW5147 T cells indicated that Lck, and to a lesser extent Fyn, were hyperphosphorylated at their negative regulatory site in the CD45− cells (31Ostergaard H.L. Shackelford D.A. Hurley T.R. Johnson P. Hyman R. Sefton B.M. Trowbridge I.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 8959-8963Crossref PubMed Scopus (413) Google Scholar, 32Hurley T.R. Hyman R. Sefton B.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 1651-1656Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). Despite this, Lck was just as active in an in vitro kinase assay as Lck isolated from CD45+ cells (33Ng D.H.W. Jabali M.D. Maiti A. Borodchak P. Harder K. Brocker T. Malissen B. Jirik F.R. Johnson P. Biochem. J. 1997; 327: 867-876Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). TCR signaling was also greatly attenuated in the CD45− BW5147 T cells expressing the TCR/CD3 complex (33Ng D.H.W. Jabali M.D. Maiti A. Borodchak P. Harder K. Brocker T. Malissen B. Jirik F.R. Johnson P. Biochem. J. 1997; 327: 867-876Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar), indicating a positive role for CD45 in TCR signaling. Here we provide evidence implicating a negative role for CD45 in regulating CD44 mediated cell spreading in TCR+ BW5147 T cells by preventing CD44 mediated signaling events. In the absence of CD45, CD44 mediated adhesion to immobilized antibodies resulted in the signaling via Src family kinases and the induction of tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins, including two focal adhesion family kinases, Pyk2 and to a lesser extent, FAK. In the CD45+ cells, no tyrosine phosphorylation was induced implying that the CD44 associated Src family kinases are not activated. This suggests a negative regulatory role for CD45 in Src family kinase activation and in CD44 mediated signaling events leading to cell adhesion and spreading. This work supports an emerging role for CD45 in negatively regulating adhesion molecule signaling leading to cell spreading in T cells. Murine BW5147 T lymphoma cells (CD45+ and CD45−; ATCC) and these cells transfected with CD3ζ and δ to express surface T cell receptor (TCR)/CD3 were used (34Wegener A.-M.K. Letourneur F. Hoeveler A. Brocker T. Luton F. Malissen B. Cell. 1992; 68: 83-95Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar). These TCR/CD3+-transfected BW5147 T cells, hereafter referred to as CD45+ BW and CD45− BW cells, were maintained at 37 °C equilibrated with 5% CO2 in DMEM with 10% v/v horse serum and 3 mm of Histidinol (Sigma-Aldrich) to maintain plasmid expression.

Rabbit anti-actin was from Sigma-Aldrich, rabbit anti-Csk, anti-FAK, and goat anti-Pyk2 were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, and mouse mAb anti-p130 Cas was from BD Transduction Laboratories. 50 µl of purified anti-CD44 antibody KM201 (40 µg/ml) or 2% w/v bovine serum albumin (BSA, Life Technologies, Inc.) in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), were coated on 96-well tissue culture plates at 37 °C for 3 h. Plates were washed 2× with PBS then blocked with 2% w/v BSA in PBS for another 2 h at 37 °C and washed 3× with PBS prior to use. 105 BW cells were added to the antibody or BSA-coated 96-well tissue culture plates at a concentration of 2 × 106 cells/ml in DMEM and 0.1% v/v fetal calf serum for various time periods. 30 µl of 3× reducing SDS sample buffer was added directly to the cells after each time point and treated at 100 °C for 5 min before electrophoresis. In some experiments, cells were preincubated with 10 µmPP2 (Calbiochem) or 25 µm cytochalasin D (Calbiochem) in DMEM, 0.1% fetal calf serum for 30 min at 37 °C, before the cells and media were transferred to the antibody-immobilized plates. 5 × 107 cells were lysed in 1 ml of ice-cold TK buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.2, 140 mm KCl, 0.5 mm sodium orthovanadate, 0.2 mm sodium molybdate, 1 µg/ml aprotinin, 1 µg/ml leupeptin, 1 µg/ml pepstatin, 0.2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) containing 1% v/v Brij-58 (Pierce) or 1% v/v Triton X-100 (Fisher Scientific Ltd.). The lysate was mechanically disrupted with a Dounce homogenizer for 15 strokes, then incubated on ice for 20 min. The lysate was transferred to an ultracentrifuge tube diluted with 1 ml of 80% w/v sucrose in TK buffer, overlaid with 6 ml of 30% w/v sucrose and 3.5 ml of 5% w/v sucrose in TK buffer, and then Ultracentrifuged at 230,000 × g for 16 h at 4 °C. The gradients were collected from the top into 8- × 1.5-ml fractions. The pellet was washed twice with TK buffer and dissolved in 150 µl of 2% w/v SDS, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.2. 20 µl from each fraction and 2 µl from dissolved pellet were boiled in the presence of 3× reducing SDS sample buffer prior to electrophoresis. 107cells were lysed in 0.5 ml of ice-cold TK buffer with 1% Brij-58 or 1% Triton X-100, incubated on ice for 10 min, then centrifuged at 16,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. Detergent-soluble material was precleared with 50 µl of 50% slurry of Sepharose CL-4B beads (Sigma-Aldrich) for 1 h at 4 °C, then 50 µl of 25% slurry of IM7 conjugated CNBr-Sepharose beads (4 mg/ml) or 50 µl of Sepharose beads alone was added as a control and incubated for 2 h at 4 °C. For immunoprecipitation from sucrose gradient fractions, fractions 2 to 4 (low density), and fractions 7 and 8 (high density), were pooled separately. The high density pool was diluted two times with TK buffer to reduce the sucrose concentration. 60 µl of 50% slurry of Sepharose beads was added to preclear the mixture. Then 60 µl of 25% slurry of IM7-conjugated CNBr-Sepharose beads or 30 µl of Sepharose beads alone (control) was added and incubated for 2 h at 4 °C. For Pyk2, FAK, and Cas immunoprecipitation, 5 × 106cells were added to 1 well of a 6-well tissue culture plate (Life Technologies, Inc.) after the wells were coated with 0.5 ml of 40 µg/ml KM201. The cells were allowed to flatten at 37 °C for various times before they were lysed on ice on the plate in the presence of 1 ml of media with 250 µl of 5× lysis buffer containing 5% Triton X-100, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.2, 140 mm KCl, 10 mm EDTA, 2.5 mm sodium orthovanadate, 1 mm sodium molybdate, 5 µg/ml aprotinin, 5 µg/ml leupeptin, 5 µg/ml pepstatin, and 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. Cell lysate was either pipetted or scraped off the plate, collected into Eppendorf tubes, and centrifuged at 16,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. Soluble cell lysate was incubated with 1 µg of anti-Pyk2 or anti-FAK or 0.5 µg of anti-Cas antibody at 4 °C, rotating for 1 h. Then 20 µl of 50% slurry protein A-agarose beads (Repligen Corp.) or protein G-Sepharose 4 Fast Flow (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) was added, and the mixture was further rotated at 4 °C for 45 min. All immunoprecipitates were washed three times with 1 ml of lysis buffer, and the proteins were eluted from beads by boiling in reducing SDS sample buffer, analyzed on SDS-PAGE using 7.5% polyacrylamide gel, and then transferred to a PVDF membrane (Immobilon P, Millipore). The membrane was air-dried and incubated with primary antibodies in TTBS buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 0.1% v/v Tween 20) with 0.5% w/v BSA for 1 h. For anti-phosphotyrosine immunoblotting, the PVDF membrane was air-dried or incubated directly with 5% w/v BSA in TBS or TTBS buffer for 1 h prior to incubation with the primary antibody. After incubation with the primary antibody, the membrane was washed three times with TTBS and further incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary reagents in 0.5% w/v BSA TTBS for another hour, then washed again in TTBS three times. Antibody-reactive bands were visualized using ECL or ECL plus (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Primary antibodies used included JIWBB at 1/1000 dilution, R54-3B and anti-actin at 1/2500 dilution, R02.2 at 1/5000 dilution, 4G10 at 0.4 µg/ml, anti-Csk at 0.5 µg/ml, anti-Pyk2 and anti-FAK at 1 µg/ml, and anti-Cas at 0.25 µg/ml. Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary reagents included protein A (Bio-Rad Laboratories) and goat anti-rat or mouse IgG (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, Inc.), both were used at 1/5000 dilution. If reprobing of the same membrane was required, the membrane was stripped by incubating with stripping buffer (50 mmglycine, pH 2.5, 150 mm NaCl, 0.1% v/v Nonidet P-40) for 30 min at room temperature. Blots were scanned and spot densitometry was carried out using IMAGE software (National Institutes of Health). CD45+ and CD45− TCR/CD3+ BW5147 T lymphoma cells (34Wegener A.-M.K. Letourneur F. Hoeveler A. Brocker T. Luton F. Malissen B. Cell. 1992; 68: 83-95Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar), hereafter called CD45+ BW and CD45− BW, both adhered to HA and anti-CD44-coated plates, but only CD45−BW T cells underwent a distinct morphological change and flattened and spread lengthwise on the immobilized anti-CD44 mAb, KM201 (Fig.1 A). This elongated flattening was observed with an immobilized antibody concentration ranging from 40 to 250 µg/ml, with a higher percentage of cells flattened at the higher concentrations. Differences in cell spreading were also observed between the CD45+ and CD45− BW cells lacking TCR expression and between the SAKR CD45+ and CD45− T cell lines, although the differences were less pronounced (data not shown). The binding of CD45− BW cells to other immobilized CD44 mAbs, IM7 and IRAW, also resulted in their elongation and spreading in a distinct manner from CD45+ BW cells, although the CD45+ BW cells exhibited some circular spreading with IM7 and high concentrations of KM201 (data not shown). The anti-CD44 antibody, KM201, binds to the HA binding site of CD44, yet adhesion of either CD45+ or CD45− BW cells to immobilized HA did not cause cell spreading under any condition tested. Thus, in addition to CD45, the epitope or affinity of the CD44 antibody may influence the signaling ability of CD44. The cell flattening and spreading was observed in the CD45− cells after 30 min but increased over a period of 2 h and was still observed after 16 h (Fig. 1 B). Cell spreading was abolished by pretreatment of cells with 25 µmcytochalasin D for 30 min, indicating that cell spreading required an intact actin cytoskeleton (data not shown). Overall, these data indicate that the presence or absence of CD45 can affect CD44-induced cell spreading in T cell lines, indicating that CD45 may negatively regulate CD44-mediated signaling events. One of the main functions of CD45 in T cells is to regulate the function of the Src family tyrosine kinase, Lck. To determine if Src family kinases played a role in CD44 triggered cell spreading, the CD45− BW T cells were pretreated for 30 min with 10 µm PP2, a Src family kinase inhibitor (40Hanke J.H. Gardner J.P. Dow R.L. Changelian P.S. Brissette W.H. Weringer E.J. Pollok B.A. Connelly P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 695-701Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1788) Google Scholar). PP2 did not prevent the binding of either CD45+ or CD45−BW T cells to the immobilized CD44 mAb, KM201, but it did prevent the cell spreading observed in the CD45− BW T cells (Fig.1 A). This indicates that CD44-mediated spreading in CD45− BW T cells is mediated by Src family kinases. To further examine the role of Src family kinases in CD44-mediated signaling events, we examined whether adhesion of CD45+ or CD45− BW T cells to immobilized CD44 antibody involved the induction of tyrosine phosphorylation. The induction of tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins was observed in the CD45− BW cells that had undergone cell spreading but was not observed to any significant degree in CD45+ BW cells that had not spread on the immobilized CD44 mAb (Fig. 2). The tyrosine-phosphorylated doublet (∼55 kDa) observed in lysates from CD45− BW cells co-migrated with Lck and Fyn (data not shown). There were at least two prominent tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins of 120–130 kDa that were induced in the CD45− BW cells upon binding immobilized CD44 antibody. There was also a less defined band at ∼80 kDa; however, this was not consistently observed. The induction of tyrosine phosphorylation correlated with the initiation of the morphological changes, becoming noticeable after 30 min and being sustained up to 16 h (data not shown). Therefore, the induction of tyrosine phosphorylation correlates with the induction of cell spreading. It was noted that, after 4 h, induction of some tyrosine phosphorylation was occasionally observed in CD45− BW T cells in wells coated with BSA (Fig.2 B). However, these tyrosine-phosphorylated bands were distinct from those observed upon incubation with immobilized CD44 antibody, and the phosphorylation of these proteins did not result in cell spreading (Fig. 1 A). The addition of PP2 inhibited both the spreading and the induction of tyrosine phosphorylation induced by immobilized anti-CD44 antibody (Figs. 1 A and 2 B). Therefore, CD44 signaling resulted in cytoskeletal changes and cell spreading in CD45− BW T cells that required Src family kinase activity and resulted in the sustained tyrosine phosphorylation of cellular proteins. Several proteins of ∼120–130 kDa are known to become tyrosine-phosphorylated after stimulation and activation of Lck and Fyn, two Src family kinases expressed in T cells. These include p130 Cas, p130 SLAP or fyb, FAK, and Pyk2. Both FAK and Pyk2 have been implicated in mediating integrin-triggered cell adhesion and cell spreading, by linking the integrin-mediated signal to the cytoskeleton (reviewed in Refs. 29Giancotti F.G. Ruoslahti E. Science. 1999; 285: 1028-1032Crossref PubMed Scopus (3825) Google Scholar and 41Avraham H. Park S.Y. Schinkmann K. Avraham S. Cell. Signalling. 2000; 12: 123-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (409) Google Scholar). FAK and Pyk2 are also inducibly tyrosine-phosphorylated in response to TCR ligation and can associate with Lck (42Berg N.N. Ostergaard H.L. J. Immunol. 1997; 159: 1753-1757PubMed Google Scholar). It was therefore determined whether these kinases became phosphorylated upon immobilization of the BW T cells by anti-CD44 antibody. Fig. 3 demonstrates that Pyk2 becomes strongly tyrosine-phosphorylated after 30 min in the CD45− BW cells. This timing correlated with the induction of cell spreading and was sustained over the measurement period of 2 h. Much lower levels of tyrosine phosphorylation of Pyk2 were seen in the CD45+ BW T cells, suggesting that, in the presence of CD45, the induction of Pyk2 phosphorylation could occur but was greatly attenuated. Low levels of FAK phosphorylation were observed only in the CD45− BW T cells. Thus, strong Pyk2 tyrosine phosphorylation and weak FAK phosphorylation correlated with the induction of cell spreading in the CD45− cells. This suggests that CD44 signaling leading to cell spreading in CD45− BW cells is mediated by Src family kinases, Pyk2, and, to a lesser extent, FAK. It is not known whether the low levels of observed FAK tyrosine phosphorylation represents a preference for Pyk2 in the CD44 signaling pathway or whether FAK is expressed at low levels in these cells. Paxillin is a cytoskeletal protein that can recruit both FAK and Src kinases to the plasma membrane, and activation of these kinases by integrin engagement leads to paxillin phosphorylation. Paxillin also co-localizes with Pyk2, FAK, and Src at the microtubule-organizing center (reviewed in Ref. 43Turner C.E. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: E231-E236Crossref PubMed Scopus (660) Google Scholar). However, in this study, paxillin was not reproducibly tyrosine-phosphorylated in CD45− BW cells after immobilization on anti-CD44 antibody (data not shown). Thus, cell spreading initiated by immobilized CD44 antibody in the CD45− BW cells requires Src family kinase activity for induction of the tyrosine phosphorylation of Pyk2 and, to a lesser extent, FAK but does not require the tyrosine phosphorylation of paxillin. Cas family members (p130 Cas, HEF-1, and Efs) are docking proteins implicated in integrin receptor signaling to the actin cytoskeleton. They can associate with FAK and Pyk2 via SH3 domain interactions and can be tyrosine-phosphorylated by either FAK or Pyk2 or by cooperative interaction between Src family kinases and FAK or Pyk2 (reviewed in Ref. 44O'Neill G.M. Fashena S.J. Golemis E.A. Trends Cell Biol. 2000; 10: 111-119Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar). Fig. 3 C demonstrates that the p130 Cas mAb detects two molecular mass species in BW cells and that the lower molecular mass species becomes tyrosine-phosphorylated in the CD45− cells 30 min after immobilization on anti-CD44 mAb. Unlike the Pyk2 phosphorylation, this tyrosine phosphorylation is not sustained and is reduced at the 2-h time point. To further investigate the link between CD44 signaling and Src family kinases, CD44 was immunoprecipitated from both CD45+ or CD45− BW T cells and its association with the Src family kinases was assessed.

M-T1 is a secreted 43-kDa glycoprotein produced by the myxoma virus, a poxvirus pathogen of rabbits, that binds CC-chemokines with high affinity, blocks binding to their cognate G-protein coupled receptors, and thereby inhibits chemokine-induced leukocyte chemotaxis.

In addition to biochemically characterizing the nature of this interaction, we demonstrate that M-T1 can also simultaneously interact with CC-chemokines while bound to heparin, suggesting that the binding sites on M-T1 for chemokines and heparin are distinct. Furthermore, using recombinant baculovirus-expressed M-T1 truncation and internal deletion mutants, we localize the heparin-binding region of M-T1 to the C terminus of the protein, a region that contains a high abundance of basic residues and includes two clusters of basic amino acid residues that resemble Cardin and Weintraub heparin-binding consensus sequences. The ability of M-T1 to simultaneously interact with chemokines and glycosaminoglycans may enable M-T1 to tether to endothelial surfaces or extracellular matrix and capture host chemokines that are expressed close to sites of virus infection.

Chemokines are secreted from a variety of cells in response to a diverse array of stimuli and alert different subsets of leukocytes through high affinity interactions with cell surface G-protein-coupled receptors found on different cell subsets. Chemokines have been divided into several groups (CXC, CC, C, and CX3C) based on the number and arrangement of conserved cysteines located at the N-terminal region of these proteins. Chemokine presentation is also thought to be influenced by their low affinity association with glycosaminoglycans (GAGs)1 that are found as the posttranslational modification of proteoglycans on the surface of cells and within the extracellular matrix (4Ali S.

GAGs, such as heparan sulfate and chondroitin sulfate, participate in a variety of important biological processes, such as cell attachment, growth factor and cytokine binding, cell proliferation, migration, morphogenesis, and viral pathogenicity (8Bernfield M.

They function by binding to and modulating the biological function of a large and diverse group of proteins generically termed “heparin-binding proteins.” In the case of chemokines, interactions with cell surface GAGs during the process of inflammation or infection are thought to enable the formation of solid-phase gradients that lure leukocytes into the local areas of inflammation (6Witt D.P.

Given the importance of chemokines for host immune surveillance, their high affinity and low affinity binding sites offer attractive targets for disruption by viruses in order to benefit virus propagation (15Lalani A.S. McFadden G. Cytokine Growth Fact. Rev. 1999; 10: 219-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 16Lusso P. Virology. 2000; 273: 228-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 17McFadden G.

Myxoma virus is a poxvirus that causes a highly virulent systemic disease in European rabbits known as myxomatosis (18Fenner F. Ratcliffe F.N. Myxomatosis. Cambridge University Press, London1965Google Scholar). This results from the ability of myxoma virus to cause severe immune dysfunction by producing multiple modulators that disrupt key components of the host innate and acquired immune responses (19Nash P. Barrett J. Cao J.-X. Hota-Mitchell S. Lalani A.S. Everett H. Xu X.-M. Robichaud J. Hnatiuk S. Ainslie C. Seet B.T. McFadden G. Immunol. Rev. 1999; 168: 103-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). This virus has therefore served as a useful model to examine the methods that poxviruses, such as variola virus (smallpox virus), or viruses in general use to disarm the immune system and contribute to disease pathogenesis. Two distinct myxoma virus virulence factors that have been identified that interact with chemokines are the M-T7 and the M-T1 proteins (20Lalani A.S. Graham K. Mossman K. Rajarathnam K. Clark-Lewis I. Kelvin D. McFadden G. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 4356-4363Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 21Graham K.A. Lalani A.S. Macen J.L. Ness T.L. Barry M. Liu L.-Y. Lucas A. Clark-Lewis I. Moyer R.W. McFadden G. Virology. 1997; 229: 12-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). Originally identified as an interferon-γ receptor homolog (22Upton C. Mossman K. McFadden G. Science. 1992; 258: 1369-1372Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar), the M-T7 protein has an additional ability to interact with low affinity with the heparin-binding domain of CXC, CC, and C chemokines (20Lalani A.S. Graham K. Mossman K. Rajarathnam K. Clark-Lewis I. Kelvin D. McFadden G. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 4356-4363Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast, M-T1 binds with high affinity and specificity to the CC family of chemokines and can antagonize CC-chemokine binding to their cognate G-protein-coupled receptors, thus inhibiting chemokine-induced chemotaxis (23Lalani A.S. Ness T.L. Singh R. Harrison J.K. Seet B.T. Kelvin D.J. McFadden G. Moyer R.W. Virology. 1998; 250: 173-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). M-T1 is also a member of a larger family of related poxvirus chemokine-binding proteins collectively known as the T1/35-kDa family (also called viral CC-chemokine inhibitors) of poxvirus CC-chemokine inhibitors (21Graham K.A. Lalani A.S. Macen J.L. Ness T.L. Barry M. Liu L.-Y. Lucas A. Clark-Lewis I. Moyer R.W. McFadden G. Virology. 1997; 229: 12-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar, 24Alcamı́ A. Symons J.A.

Although the crystal structure of the cowpox virus CC-chemokine-binding protein p35 (CPV-p35) has been determined (27Carfi A. Smith C.A. Smolak P.J. McGrew J. Wiley D.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 12379-12383Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar), the biophysical mechanism by which this family of viral proteins inhibits the activity of so many CC-chemokines is currently unknown. Nonetheless, characterization of M-T1 has shown that it is a 43-kDa N-linked secreted glycoprotein that not only can inhibit the biological function of CC-chemokines in vitro but also disrupts normal leukocyte trafficking in vivo during virus infection (21Graham K.A. Lalani A.S. Macen J.L. Ness T.L. Barry M. Liu L.-Y. Lucas A. Clark-Lewis I. Moyer R.W. McFadden G. Virology. 1997; 229: 12-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar, 23Lalani A.S. Ness T.L.

In this study, we show that in addition to binding CC-chemokines, M-T1, under physiological conditions, interacts specifically with cell surface GAGs. In an effort to characterize the nature and significance of this interaction, we demonstrate that M-T1 can bind CC-chemokines while simultaneously bound to GAGs, and we also provide evidence that the CC-chemokine-binding domain of M-T1 is distinct from its heparin-binding domain. As discussed in this report, this property has the potential to augment the ability of M-T1 to inhibit the local activity of CC-chemokines in situ and may represent a general mechanism for maintaining viral cytokine-binding proteins at sites of infection.

L cells, gro2C cells, and sog9 cells were generously provided by Dr. Frank Tufaro (University of British Columbia, Vancouver, British Columbia). Baby green monkey kidney cells, L cells, gro2C cells, and sog9 cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% newborn calf serum (Life Technologies, Inc.), 200 µg/ml streptomycin (BioWhittaker Inc.), 200 units/ml penicillin (BioWhittaker Inc.), and 2 mm glutamine (BioWhittaker Inc.). A 1-kilobase pair fragment of the myxoma virus genome containing m001L/R, which encodes the M-T1 protein, was subcloned from pMJT1 (21Graham K.A. Lalani A.S. Macen J.L. Ness T.L. Barry M. Liu L.-Y.

Orientation of m001L/R was confirmed by PstI restriction endonuclease analysis and sequencing. A series of mutant plasmids were constructed in pAlterT1 using the Altered Sites in vitro mutagenesis systems (Promega) with the custom oligonucleotides described in Table I. The plasmids were designated pAlterT1 m1 through pAlterT1 m6 based on the oligonucleotide annealed to each pAlterT1 plasmid to form the mutant plasmids. Oligonucleotides m1–m6 were designed to introduceBglII restriction sites at various locations along the length of m001L/R through the introduction of directed base pair mutations.Table Im001 L/R mutations constructed by oligonucleotide-directed mutagenesisOligonucleotideM-T1 codon(s) alteredAmino acid substitution(s)m15′-GGCATCTGCAGATCTGGCGAAGATGTC-3′23Q to Sm25′-TGTCAGGGTCTGAGATCTACGACTATTGAA-3′53,54RT to RSm35′-GGAAGTACTTACAGATCTATCGTCGGAGGA-3′103,104HT to RSm45′-GTGTCTATGAACAGATCTGAGGCGCTCGCC-3′154,155RT to RSm55′-CCGTAGATATCAGATCTAGTCGCGTCAAC-3′171,172KS to RSm65′-GTCTTAAGGTAAGATCTGGCAAACTACTC-3′258,259KN to RS Open table in a new tab pAlterT1 m1–m6 mutant plasmids were strategically digested with restriction enzymes to yield 5′- and/or 3′-fragments of various sizes. 5′-Fragments were ligated with 3′-fragments and inserted into the appropriately digested parental plasmid, pAlter, to form an intact plasmid. Ligation of different 5′- and 3′-restriction fragments together with the digested parental vector yielded a panel of in-frame deletion mutant plasmids that were amplified by transforming electrocompetent E. coli DH5α cells by electroporation. Colonies were screened for the presence of deletion mutant plasmids using polymerase chain reaction. Positive clones containing deletion mutant DNA were isolated and verified by sequencing. The preparation of the recombinant vaccinia virus-35 kDa (VV-35 kDa) protein-expressing baculovirus is described elsewhere. 2Seet, B. T., Singh, R., Paavola, C., Lau, E. K., Handel, T. M., and McFadden, G. (2001) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A., in press Them001L/R deletion and truncation mutants contained in pAlterT1 were subcloned into pSP6–2 vector (Promega). For the purpose of generating recombinant baculovirus M-T1 protein mutants, we subcloned the m001L/R mutants contained within the pSP6–2 vector into pBacPAK1 (CLONTECH Laboratories Inc.) by PstI and XhoI restriction enzyme digest ofm001L/R deletion fragments. The fragments were isolated and inserted into the PstI and XhoI restriction-digested sites of the intact m001L/R gene present in pBacPAKm001L/R. pBacPAK containingm001L/R deletion mutants (pBacPAKΔm001) from positive clones were isolated and purified. The expression of M-T1 was accomplished by co-transfecting Spodoptera frugiperdaSf-21 insect cells with pBacPAKΔm001 mutant DNA andBsu36I linearized Autographa californica nucleopolyhedrovirus (AcNPV) DNA, BacPAK6DNA (CLONTECH Laboratories Inc.). Sf-21 cells were seeded in a six-well tissue culture plate at 9 × 105cells/well in Sf900II medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) and allowed to attach for at least 1 h. As per the manufacturer's instructions, pBacPakΔm001 mutant DNA was transfected into Sf-21 cells. After transfection, cells were placed at 27 °C and assayed for protein expression 48 h, 72 h, and 8 days posttransfection by immunoblot. Baculovirus-expressed wild-type m-T1 protein and mutant M-T1 protein (bM-T1) contained in supernatants of virally infected Sf-21 cells were detected by immunoblot (30Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207516) Google Scholar) using polyclonal antiserum against M-T1. The M-T1 and M-T7 proteins were purified from myxoma virus supernatants by fast protein liquid chromatography as previously described (20Lalani A.S. Graham K. Mossman K. Rajarathnam K. Clark-Lewis I. Kelvin D. McFadden G. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 4356-4363Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 23Lalani A.S. Ness T.L. Singh R. Harrison J.K. Seet B.T. Kelvin D.J. McFadden G. Moyer R.W. Virology. 1998; 250: 173-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Baculovirus-expressed VV-35 kDa protein was purified from supernatants of baculovirus-infected cells by fast protein liquid chromatography using a three-step purification procedure. Viral supernatants were collected 72 h postinfection, subjected to anion exchange chromatography using a 5-ml HitrapQ column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), and eluted with a linear salt gradient (0–600 mm NaCl in 25 mm Tris, pH 6.0). Fractions containing VV-35 kDa were detected by immunoblot using anti-VV-35 kDa antiserum A18691. Fractions containing the protein were collected, pooled, concentrated, and dialyzed against 25 mm Tris, pH 8.0. Samples were subjected to anion exchange chromatography using a MonoQ column and eluted with a linear salt gradient (0–600 mm NaCl in 25 mm Tris, pH 8.0). Fractions with VV-35 kDa protein were pooled, subjected to size exclusion chromatography using a Superdex 200 16/60 column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), and isocratically eluted with PBS. Pooled fractions containing viral protein were visualized by silver staining to evaluate the purity of the recombinant viral proteins and demonstrated >%95 homogeneity (not shown). Heparin-Sepharose beads were swollen in binding buffer (PBS with 0.2% bovine serum albumin) and washed three times in PBS prior to preparing a slurry of 50% (v/v) heparin-Sepharose beads in binding buffer. M-T1, M-T7, or VV-35 kDa protein (50 nm) was incubated with 10 µl of heparin-Sepharose for 1 h at room temperature and rotated in a volume of 400 µl of binding buffer. The beads were then recovered by a brief centrifugation in a microcentrifuge at 15,000 rpm. The supernatant was discarded, and the beads were washed three times with 400 µl of PBS. Bound viral proteins were eluted from the beads by the addition of 25 µl of SDS-gel loading buffer and boiled for 1 min. The gel loading buffer containing eluted viral protein was then subjected to SDS-PAGE and visualized by immunoblotting. As a negative control, the same procedures were repeated with Sepharose beads. This heparin-Sepharose pull-down assay was also varied to include co-incubations of M-T1 with various salt concentrations in 25 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.4, with 0.2% bovine serum albumin. To examine interactions of M-T1 with heparin and chemokines, the heparin-Sepharose pull-down assay was also combined with a cross-linking electrophoretic mobility shift assay that we have previously used to examine chemokine interactions with M-T1 (21Graham K.A. Lalani A.S. Macen J.L. Ness T.L. Barry M. Liu L.-Y. Lucas A. Clark-Lewis I. Moyer R.W. McFadden G. Virology. 1997; 229: 12-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). After co-incubation of M-T1 and MCP-1 with heparin-Sepharose in binding buffer, all proteins that bound the immobilized heparin were pulled down by centrifugation of the heparin-Sepharose beads. To cross-link the interacting proteins, 15 µl of 10 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.0, was mixed with 2 µl of 200 mm1-ethyl-3(3-dimethylaminopropyl)-carbodiimide (EDC) and added to the beads for 10 min. After 10 min, 2 µl of 1 m Tris-Cl, pH 7.5, was added to quench the reaction. The cross-linked products were eluted from the heparin-Sepharose beads with the addition of SDS-gel loading buffer and boiling. The sample was subjected to SDS-PAGE and immunoblotted using an anti-M-T1 antibody. To ensure that MCP-1 had not complexed with M-T1 in the cross-linking solution, the beads were washed with PBS after cross-linking, and proteins were eluted as described and subjected to SDS-PAGE. Cell binding assays were performed using L cells, gro2c cells, and sog9 cells. Cells were grown to confluency in 48-well dishes and were washed three times with PBS before binding studies were performed. Binding studies with L cells, gro2C cells, and sog9 cells were performed by incubating M-T1 (200 nm) in cell medium. After 2 h incubation at 4 °C, cells were washed three times. Cells were lysed with the addition of SDS gel loading buffer, and samples were subjected to SDS-PAGE. After electrophoretic transfer to nitrocellulose, M-T1 was detected by immunoblot against M-T1 as described. Relative quantities of M-T1 were determined densitometrically and expressed as the percentage bound relative to the specific binding of M-T1 to parental L cells. An identical method was used with L cells preincubated for 3 h at 37 °C with 5 units/ml of heparinase I (Sigma), 2 milliunits/ml chondroitinase ABC (Sigma), or both enzymes together. To ensure equal loading of lysates onto gels, blots were reprobed for β-actin (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). To examine the effect of M-T1 on MCP-1 binding to cell surface GAGs, L cells grown in 48-well dishes were incubated with constant concentrations of 125I-MCP-1 (250 pm) and increasing concentrations of M-T1 for 2 h at 4 °C in medium without newborn calf serum. Nonspecific binding was determined using a 1000-fold excess of unlabeled MCP-1. Cells were washed with PBS three times and lysed using 20 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 8.0, with 0.2% Triton X-100. Whole lysates were transferred to polystyrene tubes and 125I-MCP-1 was measured using a gamma counter (Wallac). To measure the kinetic and affinity binding parameters between M-T1 and heparin, we performed biomolecular interaction analysis (BIAcore) to measure real-time binding. We developed an artificial proteoglycan surface using a streptavidin (SA) chip (BIAcore, Inc.) and measured binding using a BIAcoreX apparatus (BIAcore, Inc.). The active binding surface was constructed by immobilizing 400 response units (RU) of heparin-albumin-biotin (Sigma) onto flow cell 2 of the SA chip that noncovalently captured the biotinylated heparin-albumin. On a control flow cell (flow cell 1), biotinylated albumin (Sigma) was injected, and 400 RU of protein was noncovalently immobilized. 50 µl of glycine, pH 2.0, was injected over both surfaces to remove any loosely bound heparin-albumin-biotin. For kinetic studies, M-T1 was serially diluted into HBS-EP (10 mm Hepes, 150 mm NaCl, 0.005% polysorbate (v/v), 3 mm EDTA). 100 µl of each concentration of M-T1 was injected over both flow cells at a rate of 100 µl/min at 25 °C. Following the association phase, HBS-EP was allowed to flow over the two surfaces to monitor the dissociation phase of M-T1 for up to 200 s. Specific binding was determined automatically using BIAcore Control software 2.1 by subtracting the control cell sensorgram (nonspecific binding) from the active flow cell sensorgram. Flow cells were regenerated by eluting bound protein with three 10-µl pulses of a 1 m NaCl solution. To eliminate sensorgram deviations introduced by the BIAcoreX hardware, we subtracted from the initial data a sensorgram generated from the injection of buffer alone (31Rich, R. L., and Myszka, D. G. (2000) Curr. Opin. Biotechnol. 11.Google Scholar). During preliminary experiments, an observed heterogeneity of binding occurred at higher concentration of M-T1, possibly due to oligomerization at the surface. We therefore confined kinetic analysis to three lower concentrations of M-T1 (4, 12, and 36 nm). Because kinetic analysis affords the ability to generate accurate affinity measurements using the association and dissociation phases of binding, these curves were adequate for determining the kinetic parameters for M-T1 binding to immobilized heparin conjugated to biotinylated albumin. Curves were globally fit using BIAevaluation software 3.0 using a 1:1 mass transport model. Using the determined association (k on) and dissociation (k off) rate constants, the dissociation equilibrium affinity constant (K D) was calculated (K D =k off/k on). To examine the oligosaccharide structures that M-T1 may be capable of binding, we used the heparin-albumin chip in a surface plasmon resonance (SPR) competition assay that involved the preincubation of 50 nm of M-T1 with several concentrations of soluble GAG competitors, heparin, heparan sulfate, chondroitin sulfate A, and chondroitin sulfate B for 2 h prior to SPR analysis. For each GAG competitor, M-T1 (50 nm) preincubated with 1000 µg/ml GAG was injected at a flow rate of 5 µl/min. The M-T1 binding curve was allowed to equilibrate (dRU/dt = 0), and the response at equilibrium was recorded. Subsequently, M-T1 (50 nm) preincubated with 100 µg/ml GAG was then injected over the chip and allowed to equilibrate, and the response was recorded. This was further repeated for M-T1 preincubated with GAG concentrations of 10, 1, and 0 µg/ml. To identify the location of potential heparin-binding domains within the three-dimensional structure of M-T1, a model of M-T1 was compared with a model of the related VV-35 kDa protein, which does not bind heparin. Both M-T1 and the VV-35 kDa models were constructed using the crystal structure of CPV-p35 (27Carfi A. Smith C.A. Smolak P.J. McGrew J. Wiley D.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 12379-12383Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar) (Research Collaboratory for Structural Bioinformatics Protein Data Bank accession number PDB 1CQ3). A multiple sequence alignment containing M-T1, VV-35 kDa, CPV-p35, and four other CC-chemokine-binding proteins from poxviruses was used to match residues from M-T1 and VV-35 kDa to those of CPV-p35 (21Graham K.A. Lalani A.S. Macen J.L. Ness T.L. Barry M. Liu L.-Y. Lucas A. Clark-Lewis I. Moyer R.W. McFadden G. Virology. 1997; 229: 12-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). When aligned in this manner, the sequence identity between M-T1 and CPV-p35 is ∼38%, with an additional 18% sequence similarity; in the case of the VV-35 kDa protein, sequence identity to CPV-p35 was 81%, with an additional 5% sequence similarity. M-T1 and the VV-35 kDa protein sequences were threaded onto the corresponding coordinates of the CPV-p35 crystal structure using the SwissPDB Viewer program (32Guex N. Peitsch M.C. Electrophoresis. 1997; 18: 2714-2723Crossref PubMed Scopus (9640) Google Scholar). For M-T1, main chain adjustments were required to connect residues 40–41, 196–197, and 245–246, regions where there are small deletions in M-T1. Residues 68–85 of M-T1 have no equivalents in the CPV-p35 structure, and therefore, this region of M-T1 was not included in the model. Side chain conformations were adjusted manually using the program O (33Jones T.A. Zou J.Y. Cowan S.W. Kjeldgaard M. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. A. 1991; 47: 110-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (13014) Google Scholar), and the model was subjected to energy minimization with CNS (crystallography and NMR system) (34Brunger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. Delano W.L. Gras P. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Jiang J.S. Kuszewski J. Nilges M. Pannu N.S. Read R.J. Rice L.M. Simonson T. Warren G.L. Acta Crystallogr. D. Biol. Crystallogr. 1998; 54: 905-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (16979) Google Scholar) using harmonic restraints on Cα atomic positions. Because of the very high sequence similarity between VV-35 kDa and CPV-p35 and the absence of gaps in the sequence alignment, the VV-35 kDa model required only a few minor side chain adjustments after threading. In both the M-T1 and VV-35 kDa models, the positions of cysteines are conserved, and the four disulfide bonds present in the CPV-p35 struct"
https://openalex.org/W2005981557,"Hereditary vitamin D-resistant rickets (HVDRR) is caused by heterogeneous inactivating mutations in the vitamin D receptor (VDR). Treatment of HVDRR patients with high doses of oral calcium and supraphysiologic doses of 1α,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 (1,25D3) has had limited success. In this study we explored the use of vitamin D analogs as a potential therapy for this disorder. The rationale for the use of vitamin D analogs is that they bind the VDR at different amino acid residues than 1,25D3, and their ability to modulate VDR functions differs from that of the natural hormone. In this report, we examined the VDR from three HVDRR patients with mutations in the ligand-binding domain of the VDR (histidine 305 to glutamine, arginine 274 to leucine, and phenylalanine 251 to cysteine) for their responses to two vitamin D analogs, 20-epi-1,25D3 and 1β-hydroxymethyl-3-epi-16-ene-26a,27a-bishomo-25D3(JK-1626-2). Our results reveal that vitamin D analogs partially or completely restore the responsiveness of the mutated VDR. Analog treatment seemed to be more successful when the mutation affects the amino acids directly involved in ligand binding rather than amino acids that contribute to a functional VDR interface with dimerization partners or coactivators of transcription. Hereditary vitamin D-resistant rickets (HVDRR) is caused by heterogeneous inactivating mutations in the vitamin D receptor (VDR). Treatment of HVDRR patients with high doses of oral calcium and supraphysiologic doses of 1α,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 (1,25D3) has had limited success. In this study we explored the use of vitamin D analogs as a potential therapy for this disorder. The rationale for the use of vitamin D analogs is that they bind the VDR at different amino acid residues than 1,25D3, and their ability to modulate VDR functions differs from that of the natural hormone. In this report, we examined the VDR from three HVDRR patients with mutations in the ligand-binding domain of the VDR (histidine 305 to glutamine, arginine 274 to leucine, and phenylalanine 251 to cysteine) for their responses to two vitamin D analogs, 20-epi-1,25D3 and 1β-hydroxymethyl-3-epi-16-ene-26a,27a-bishomo-25D3(JK-1626-2). Our results reveal that vitamin D analogs partially or completely restore the responsiveness of the mutated VDR. Analog treatment seemed to be more successful when the mutation affects the amino acids directly involved in ligand binding rather than amino acids that contribute to a functional VDR interface with dimerization partners or coactivators of transcription. hereditary vitamin D-resistant rickets 25D3, 1α,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 vitamin D receptor vitamin D-responsive element ligand-binding domain 25D3, 20-epi-1,25D3 retinoid X receptor wild type 1β-hydroxymethyl-3-epi-26,27-bishomo-25-hydroxy-vitamin D3 1,25-dihydroxy-16,23E-diene-26,27-hexafluoro-vitamin D3 osteocalcin VDRE thymidine kinase growth hormone steroid receptor coactivator 1 glutathioneS-transferase Hereditary vitamin D-resistant rickets (HVDRR)1 is an autosomal recessive disorder characterized by end-organ resistance to 1α,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 (1,25D3) (1Brooks M.H.

Resistance to 1,25D3 in HVDRR leads to impaired intestinal calcium absorption. This results in a series of metabolic abnormalities including frank hypocalcemia, secondary hyperparathyroidism, elevated alkaline phosphatase levels, hypophosphatemia, and markedly increased 1,25D3 levels (2Malloy J.P.

Treatment of HVDRR patients with high doses of oral calcium and supraphysiologic doses of 1,25D3 has had limited success. More aggressive therapy to bypass the defect in intestinal calcium absorption is long term intravenous infusion of calcium that restores the serum calcium levels to normal and reverses the rickets in some cases (2Malloy J.P.

However, this approach has the usual complications associated with intravenous therapy, and its use has been limited because of its complexity.The resistance to 1,25D3 in HVDRR is caused by heterogeneous mutations in the nuclear receptor for vitamin D (2Malloy J.P. Pike J.W. Feldman D. Endocr. Rev. 1999; 20: 156-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (345) Google Scholar, 8Hughes M.R. Malloy P.J. Kieback D.G. Kesterson R.A. Pike J.W. Feldman D. O'Malley B.W.

Therefore, this disease emphasizes the importance of vitamin D receptor (VDR)-mediated action of 1,25D3 in skeletal development and bone mineralization as well as in the development of hair follicles. Like other members of the nuclear receptor superfamily, the VDR is activated by binding to its ligand (1,25D3), and its action is mediated through distinct functional domains for DNA binding, ligand binding, and transcriptional activation (10McDonnell D.P. Scott R.A. Kerner S.A. O'Malley B.W. Pike J.W. Mol. Endocrinol. 1989; 3: 635-644Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar, 11Haussler M.R. Jurutka P.W. Hsieh J.C. Thompson P.D. Hsieh J.C.

HVDRR patients with mutations in the DNA binding domain of VDR do not respond to 1,25D3 treatment mainly because of structural disruption of VDR binding to its DNA response elements (VDREs) with a total loss of transcriptional regulation (2Malloy J.P. Pike J.W. Feldman D. Endocr. Rev. 1999; 20: 156-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (345) Google Scholar). Conversely, some patients harboring mutations in the ligand-binding domain (LBD) have been partially responsive to high doses of calcium and 1,25D3, presumably because the excess active metabolite was able to override the insensitivity caused by the ligand-binding defect (2Malloy J.P. Pike J.W. Feldman D. Endocr. Rev. 1999; 20: 156-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (345) Google Scholar).In the present study we considered vitamin D analogs as an alternative treatment to large doses of 1,25D3 for the following reasons. First, some analogs of vitamin D are significantly more potent transcriptionally than the natural hormone. This enhanced transcriptional potency is proposed to be mediated through differential modulation of VDR functions (11Haussler M.R. Jurutka P.W. Hsieh J.C. Thompson P.D. Hsieh J.C. Thompson P.D.

Bishop J.E. Norman A.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 10551-10558Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). For example, side chain-modified analogs such as 20-epi-1,25D3 (20E-1,25D3) have 100–1000-fold greater transcriptional potency than 1,25D3, and this is associated with enhanced potency to heterodimerize with the retinoid X receptor (RXR) and to interact with the transcription coactivator vitamin D receptor interacting protein 205 (12Peleg S.

Chem. 1999; 274: 16838-16845Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). The proposed mechanism for this enhanced potency is that in which the analog changes the conformation of the VDR to provide a more effective interface for interaction with RXR and transcription coactivators. Second, even analogs that are less potent transcriptionally than 1,25D3 may contact different amino acid residues in the ligand-binding pocket such that they have the potential to bind and activate VDRs with mutations at the usual contact points for the hormone (15Liu Y.Y. Collins E.D. Norman A.W. Peleg S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 3336-3345Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar, 16Peleg S. Nguyen C. Woodard B.T. Lee J.K. Posner G.H. Mol. Endocrinol. 1998; 12: 525-535Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar).To determine whether analogs can bind and restore transcriptional activity of VDR in HVDRR patients, we selected three HVDRR mutations that were restricted to the LBD of the VDR: arginine 274 to leucine (R274L) (17Kristjansson K. Rut A.R. Hewison M. O'Riordan J.L. Hughes M.R. J. Clin. Invest. 1993; 92: 12-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar), histidine 305 to glutamine (H305Q) (18Malloy P.J. Eccleshall T.R. Gross C. Van M.L. Bouillon R. Feldman D. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 99: 297-304Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar), and phenylalanine 251 to cysteine (F251C) (19Malloy, P. J., Zhu, W. J., Zhao, X. Y., Pehling, G. B., and Feldman, D. (2001) Mol. Genet. Metab., in press.Google Scholar, 20Gardezi A. Nguyen C. Malloy P.J. Feldman D. Peleg S. Norman A.W. Bouillon R. Thomasset M. Vitamin D Endocrine System: Structural, Biological and Clinical Aspect. University of California, Riverside, CA2000: 931-934Google Scholar). The amino acid residues arginine 274 and histidine 305 have been shown to contact the 1α-OH and 25-OH groups, respectively, in 1,25D3 (21Rochel N. Wurtz J.M. Mitshler A. Klaholz B. Moras D. Mol. Cell. 2000; 5: 173-179Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (739) Google Scholar). The amino acid residue phenylalanine 251, which is localized to the E1 domain, is in a region that modulates RXR heterodimerization and coactivator interaction (22Rosen E.D. Beninghof E.G. Koenig R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 11534-11541Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 23Whitfield G.K. Hsieh J.-C. Nakajima S. MacDonald P.N. Thomposon P.W. Jurutka P.W. Haussler C.A. Haussler M.R. Mol. Endocrinol. 1995; 9: 1166-1179Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In each case we reproduced the mutation by site-directed mutagenesis and compared the response of the WT and mutant VDR to 1,25D3 and analogs with respect to ligand binding, coactivator interaction, formation of active conformations, and transcriptional activation.DISCUSSIONThe study presented here demonstrates that vitamin D analogs may be an effective treatment for a subset of patients with a rare but devastating inherited disorder, HVDRR. Analogs of 1,25D3have been developed in the past 20 years primarily to counter hypercalcemic effects of the natural hormone while maintaining various therapeutic properties including bone protective and antiproliferative actions in malignant cells (33Zhou J.Y. Norman A.W. Lubbert M. Collins E.D. Uskokovic M.R. Koeffler H.P. Blood. 1989; 74: 82-93Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 34Bouillon R. Okamura W.H. Norman A.W. Endocr. Rev. 1995; 16: 200-257Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The analogs are being used also as molecular probes to understand the mechanism of action of proteins associated with the vitamin D endocrine system such as the P450 enzymes, vitamin D-binding protein, and the nuclear VDR (35Okamura W.H. Zhu G.D. Feldman D. Glorieux F.H. Pike J.W. Vitamin D. Academic Press, San Diego, CA1997: 939-971Google Scholar). Studies focusing on the mechanism of action of these analogs with respect to VDR activation have led to the realization that they have the potential to interact with the receptor at amino acid contact points that differ from those utilized by the natural ligand, 1,25D3. Furthermore, these analogs have the potential to shape the functional surfaces of the LBD of the receptor such that it interacts with dimerization partners and coactivators of transcription differently from the 1,25D3-bound receptor (12Peleg S. Sastry M. Collins E.D. Bishop J.E. Norman A.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 10551-10558Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar, 14Yang W. Freedman L.P. J. Biol.

Endocrinol. 1998; 12: 525-535Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). The most obvious application of these findings is to determine whether they apply to a disease or diseases with functional defects in VDR action, hence, our choice to study HVDRR.The selection of analogs for these studies out of a pool of several hundred compounds became somewhat easier as a result of molecular modeling of the LBD of VDR. Models have been either constructed theoretically using coordinates of other ligand-binding nuclear receptors (36Norman A.W. Adams D. Collins E.D. Okamura W.H. Fletterick R. J. Cell. Biochem. 1999; 74: 323-333Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 37Yamamoto K. Masuno H. Choi M. Nakashima K. Taga T. Ooizumi H. Umesono K. Sicinska W. VanHooke J. DeLuca H.F. Yamada S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 1467-1472Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar) or directly by x-ray crystallography of the hormone-occupied VDR LBD (21Rochel N. Wurtz J.M. Mitshler A. Klaholz B. Moras D. Mol. Cell. 2000; 5: 173-179Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (739) Google Scholar). These models elucidate the contact points of the 1,25D3 in the binding pocket and the nature of amino acid residues that contribute to the functional surface of the receptor. We used this information to select candidate mutations for analog treatment and the analogs that may be able to restore the functions of these mutants.Our experiments strongly support the concept that analogs of 1,25D3 are capable of using alternative contact points in the LBD and show for the first time that this alternative interaction can restore the function of mutant VDRs. By using an analog with a 20E-1,25D3 side chain, which places the 25-OH group in the northwest orientation (as opposed to the northeast orientation in the natural hormone), or an analog that had hexafluoride substitutions at positions 26 and 27 of the side chain, we were able to restore functions of a VDR that had a mutation at its 25-OH contact point, H305Q. However, from the findings with this mutant we made two additional observations. First, although histidine 305 is a contact point for the 25-OH group according to the x-ray crystallography, it is not essential for high affinity binding of 1,25D3. However, it has been reported that the analog 1α-OH-D3, which lacks this group, does not have a significant affinity for VDR and does not have significant activity in vitro (although it is used as a prohormone in vivo) (34Bouillon R. Okamura W.H. Norman A.W. Endocr. Rev. 1995; 16: 200-257Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 35Okamura W.H. Zhu G.D. Feldman D. Glorieux F.H. Pike J.W. Vitamin D. Academic Press, San Diego, CA1997: 939-971Google Scholar). Therefore, we propose that the 25-OH group is essential for 1,25D3 binding but that the hormone may use an alternative contact point in the H305Q VDR, as do the analogs. The difference is that the presumed new contact of the natural hormone with the mutant VDR fails to stabilize a functional conformation of the protein, whereas the analogs do so more successfully.The second observation is that the VDR conformations of the 1,25D3- or 20E-1,25D3-bound WT and H305Q receptors are probably different, as has been demonstrated by the protease sensitivity assays, although the 20E-1,25D3 analog had the same potency to stabilize both conformations. This change in conformation did not have a significant effect on the potency of the 20E-1,25D3-occupied H305Q VDR to interact with the transcription coactivator SRC-1 in vitro, but in cultured cells there was a 4–10-fold decrease in its potency to induce transcription of either the ocVDRE-TK-GH reporter or the24-hydroxylase gene. These results imply that the conformation of the 20E-1,25D3-bound H305Q is associated with somewhat impaired transcription. This conclusion is supported by our findings that another side chain analog (Ro25-5318) induced a WT conformation of the H305Q VDR (Fig. 8) and maintained 43% of WT potency to induce transcription of the ocVDRE-GH transgene (Table I) and 100% of WT potency to induce the 24-hydroxylase mRNA in the patient cells (data not shown). Taken together, these results suggest that perhaps it is not the p160 coactivator-binding site that is compromised in the 20E-1,25D3-occupied H305Q VDR but another functional interface.Our results with R274L, a VDR mutated at a contact point for another essential functional group of 1,25D3, that is the 1α-OH group, were simpler to interpret. The data confirmed both the importance of the 1α-OH group for binding to VDR and the importance of R274 in this binding. The results also clearly showed that it is possible to restore the activity of R274L VDR with an analog (JK-1626-2), the 1-OH group of which is replaced with the 1β-hydroxymethyl group. Furthermore, the limited structure-activity analyses performed in this study clearly show that the A ring-modified analog had a greater potency to bind and transactivate this mutant than the two side chain analogs used in this study. Our results also showed that of JK-1626-2 apparently either used an alternative contact point for the substituted 1-OH group or made contact with the substituted leucine. We hypothesize that the latter possibility was unlikely, because in additional experiments (data not shown) we replaced the arginine 274 with a less hydrophobic residue, alanine, and found that the potencies of JK-1626-2 to bind the R274A and R274L VDRs were similar. Further evidence that JK-1626-2 uses an alternative contact point or points is that mutation of serine 275 diminished binding of JK-1626-2 but not the binding of 1,25D3 (data not shown). However, because we did not use molecular modeling to dock JK-1626-2 in the VDR binding pocket, we cannot make a conclusive statement about the interactions of the modified A-ring of JK-1626-2, especially because it also has a side chain modification.This study also attempted to test the hypothesis that analog-occupied VDR might assume a functional conformation that is different from the functional conformation of 1,25D3-occupied VDR by using the F251C mutant VDR. The functional interface of the LBD of VDR includes binding sites for transcriptional coactivators and for bridging factors such as vitamin D receptor-interacting protein 205 and several regions that regulate heterodimerization such as E1 and heptad 9 (14Yang W.

An effect of the analog on the functional interface may be to expose or hide an amino acid residue that may therefore be included or excluded from the functional interface, because they are found in the 1,25D3-VDR complexes. These changes may improve or diminish the binding of common coactivators to the receptor or, alternatively, may change the preference of the binding site for individual dimerization partners or coactivators. Although 1,25D3 and 20E-1,25D3 have been shown to induce different conformational changes in VDR (12Peleg S. Sastry M. Collins E.D. Bishop J.E. Norman A.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 10551-10558Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar, 30Vaisanen S. Juntunen K. Itkonen A. Vihko P. Maenpaa P.H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 248: 156-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar), they failed to induce the F251C mutant to bind SRC-1 or to induce transcription of theocVDRE-TK-GH reporter. Interestingly, the analog 20E-1,25D3 exhibited a significant ability to induce transcription through the 24-hydroxylase promoter and to up-regulate 24-hydroxylase mRNA in the cells of the patient. This may imply that the transcriptional activity of the VDR through theocVDRE reporter gene may utilize primarily a SRC-like coactivator that is necessary for both 1,25D3- and 20E-1,25D3-induced transcription. However, for transactivation of the 24-hydroxylase promoter, another coactivator or bridging factor may be used (14Yang W. Freedman L.P. J. Biol.

Endocrinol. 2000; 14: 401-420Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar), and that factor is preferentially recruited by the 20E-1,25D3-bound VDR. However, our results do not reveal whether the binding site for the putative factor is compromised by the F251C mutation or located outside of the E1 domain.In conclusion, our studies demonstrated that analogs of 1,25D3 may restore the function of defective mutant VDR in HVDRR. Our results suggest that use of analogs to treat HVDRR will be more successful if the mutation is at a ligand contact point rather than a contact point for a coactivator of transcription. However, we cannot exclude the possibility that other mutations in the LBD that alter the interaction of VDR with proteins indirectly may also be rescued by vitamin D analogs. These biochemical and cellular studies form the basis for considering clinical trials using vitamin D analogs to treat selected patients with HVDRR.

However, this approach has the usual complications associated with intravenous therapy, and its use has been limited because of its complexity. The resistance to 1,25D3 in HVDRR is caused by heterogeneous mutations in the nuclear receptor for vitamin D (2Malloy J.P. Pike J.W. Feldman D. Endocr.

Therefore, this disease emphasizes the importance of vitamin D receptor (VDR)-mediated action of 1,25D3 in skeletal development and bone mineralization as well as in the development of hair follicles. Like other members of the nuclear receptor superfamily, the VDR is activated by binding to its ligand (1,25D3), and its action is mediated through distinct functional domains for DNA binding, ligand binding, and transcriptional activation (10McDonnell D.P. Scott R.A. Kerner S.A. O'Malley B.W. Pike J.W. Mol. Endocrinol. 1989; 3: 635-644Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar, 11Haussler M.R. Jurutka P.W. Hsieh J.C. Thompson P.D. Hsieh J.C.

HVDRR patients with mutations in the DNA binding domain of VDR do not respond to 1,25D3 treatment mainly because of structural disruption of VDR binding to its DNA response elements (VDREs) with a total loss of transcriptional regulation (2Malloy J.P. Pike J.W. Feldman D. Endocr. Rev. 1999; 20: 156-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (345) Google Scholar). Conversely, some patients harboring mutations in the ligand-binding domain (LBD) have been partially responsive to high doses of calcium and 1,25D3, presumably because the excess active metabolite was able to override the insensitivity caused by the ligand-binding defect (2Malloy J.P. Pike J.W. Feldman D. Endocr. Rev. 1999; 20: 156-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (345) Google Scholar). In the present study we considered vitamin D analogs as an alternative treatment to large doses of 1,25D3 for the following reasons. First, some analogs of vitamin D are significantly more potent transcriptionally than the natural hormone. This enhanced transcriptional potency is proposed to be mediated through differential modulation of VDR functions (11Haussler M.R. Jurutka P.W. Hsieh J.C. Thompson P.D. Hsieh J.C. Thompson P.D.

For example, side chain-modified analogs such as 20-epi-1,25D3 (20E-1,25D3) have 100–1000-fold greater transcriptional potency than 1,25D3, and this is associated with enhanced potency to heterodimerize with the retinoid X receptor (RXR) and to interact with the transcription coactivator vitamin D receptor in"
https://openalex.org/W2013936276,"Tropomyosin (TM) family of cytoskeletal proteins is implicated in stabilizing actin microfilaments. Many TM isoforms, including tropomyosin-1 (TM1), are down-regulated in transformed cells. Previously we demonstrated that TM1 is a suppressor of the malignant transformation, and that TM1 reorganizes microfilaments in the transformed cells. To investigate how TM1 induces microfilament organization in transformed cells, we utilized ras-transformed NIH3T3 (DT) cells, and those transduced to express TM1, and/or TM2. Enhanced expression of TM1 alone, but not TM2, results in re-emergence of microfilaments; TM1, together with TM2 remarkably improves microfilament architecture. TM1 induced cytoskeletal reorganization involves an enhanced expression of caldesmon, but not vinculin, alpha-actinin, or gelsolin. In addition, TM1-induced cytoskeletal reorganization and the revertant phenotype appears to involve re-activation of RhoA controlled pathways in DT cells. RhoA expression, which is suppressed in DT cells, is significantly increased in TM1-expressing cells, without detectable changes in the expression of Rac or Cdc42. Furthermore, expression of a dominant negative Rho kinase, or treatment with Y-27632 disassembled microfilaments in normal NIH3T3 and in TM1 expressing cells. These data suggest that reactivation of Rho kinase directed pathways are critical for TM1-mediated microfilament assemblies."

The activity of SK2–414was partially restored by the peptides SK1–2, SK1–5, SK1–10, and SK1–15, whereas Pg562–569 peptides were much less effective. Active site-specific fluorescence labeling demonstrated directly that the active catalytic site was formed on the Pg zymogen by the combination of SK1–10 and SK2–414, whereas sequence-scrambled SK1–10 was inactive. The characterization of SK1–10 containing single Ala substitutions demonstrated the sequence specificity of the interaction.

This interaction triggers the conformational change that completes the folding of the proteinase and activates the enzyme by the formation of the substrate binding site and the oxyanion hole (3Huber R.

In the case of Pg activation, additional atypical changes occur in the positions of the catalytic residues and Trp761, which are also required for activation (8Peisach E. Wang J. de los Santos T. Reich E. Ringe D. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 11180-11188Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 9Wang X. Terzyan S. Tang J. Loy J.A. Lin X. Zhang X.C. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 295: 903-914Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). The activation of Pg by the thrombolytic drug streptokinase (SK) represents a rare and poorly understood exception to the standard mechanism, because the binding of SK to the catalytic domain of Pg results in the expression of the active catalytic site without proteolysis (10McClintock D.K. Bell P.H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1971; 43: 694-702Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar, 11Davidson D.J. Higgins D.H. Castellino F.J. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 3585-3590Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 12Reddy K.N.N. Markus G. J. Biol. Chem. 1972; 247: 1683-1691Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The transition of trypsinogen toward a trypsin-like conformation can be achieved without proteolysis through strongly linked binding of a ligand to the catalytic site and binding of the amino-terminal dipeptide Ile-Val to the binding cleft (4Bode W. J. Mol. Biol. 1979; 127: 357-374Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar, 5Bode W. Huber R. FEBS Lett. 1976; 68: 231-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). Thus, the inactive conformation of trypsinogen and homologous zymogens is thought to be in highly unfavorable but reversible equilibrium with an active conformation (4Bode W. J. Mol. Biol. 1979; 127: 357-374Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). On this basis, it was hypothesized that a “molecular sexual” encounter of the amino terminus of SK with the binding cleft of Pg could induce the activation of the zymogen (5Bode W. Huber R. FEBS Lett. 1976; 68: 231-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). Experimental evidence consistent with this molecular sexuality hypothesis was provided in the recent findings that the deletion (13Wang S. Reed G.L. Hedstrom L. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 5232-5240Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar) or substitution (14Wang S. Reed G.L. Hedstrom L. Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 3994-4001Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar) of Ile1 of SK was correlated with the loss of activity in conformational activation. This mechanism, however, is in apparent disagreement with the reported high activity of recombinant SK species in which the first 16 residues were deleted or the amino terminus was blocked by fusion to a maltose-binding protein (15Reed G.L. Lin L.-F. Parhami-Seren B. Kussie P. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 10266-10271Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 16Young K.-C. Shi G.-Y. Chang Y.-F. Chang B.-I. Chang L.-C. Lai M.-D. Chuang W.-J. Wu H.-L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 29601-29606Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Moreover, it has been reported subsequently that this SK fusion protein is inactive in conformational activation (14Wang S. Reed G.L. Hedstrom L. Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 3994-4001Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Although recent evidence demonstrates that Ile1 is important, the possible role of the amino-terminal 2–15 residue sequence of SK is unknown. An alternative mechanism for conformational activation has also been proposed in which a conformational change accompanying SK binding reorients Lys698 of Pg to occupy the amino-terminal binding cleft in place of Val562 (17Wang X. Lin X. Loy J.A. Tang J. Zhang X.C. Science. 1998; 281: 1662-1665Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar). Recent studies, however, implicate Lys698 of micro-Pg in SK binding affinity (14Wang S. Reed G.L. Hedstrom L. Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 3994-4001Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar) while also finding that this residue is not essential for conformational activation. Finally, a comparison of the affinities of SK for Pg and Pm demonstrated a 3100–3500-fold higher affinity of SK for the activated proteinase domain of Pm, which has been proposed to participate in the conformational activation of Pg by stabilizing the active conformation of the zymogen (18Boxrud P.D. Fay W.P. Bock P.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 14579-14589Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 19Boxrud P.D. Bock P.E. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 13974-13981Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). The unresolved roles of SK binding to Pg and Pm and interactions of the SK amino-terminal sequence with the Pg amino-terminal binding site in the conformational activation mechanism were evaluated in the present fluorescence and kinetic studies of Pg interactions with an SK mutant lacking Ile1 (SK2–414). SK2–414bound to fluorescein-labeled [Lys]Pg and [Lys]Pm with affinities equivalent to native SK, but this tight binding alone was insufficient to induce conformational activation of Pg. Compelling evidence for an additional critical requirement for interactions of the SK amino terminus was obtained in the novel demonstration that the loss of activity of SK2–414 could be restored partially by the specific binding of peptides based on the amino-terminal 10-residue sequence of SK. The results support a mechanism of conformational activation in which the amino-terminal sequence of SK beginning with Ile1 interacts in a sequence-specific manner with the amino-terminal binding cleft of Pg and through extended binding sites on the SK2–414·Pg complex to induce a transition toward the active conformation. Evidence for the additional role of preferential binding affinity of SK for Pm compared with Pg was obtained in the finding that conformational activity of the further SK truncation mutants SK55–414 and SK78–414could not be restored by SK1–10. The loss of activity was associated with a selective loss of affinity of SK55–414for labeled [Lys]Pm, whereas the affinity for [Lys]Pg was not significantly affected. On this basis, conformational activation is concluded to occur through the amino-terminal interaction in cooperation with the stabilization of the active conformation by the enhanced binding affinity of the remainder of SK for the active form of the zymogen. [Glu]Pg and [Lys]Pm carbohydrate forms 1 and 2 were purified and characterized by the procedures published previously (18Boxrud P.D. Fay W.P. Bock P.E. J. Biol.

Chem. 2000; 275: 14579-14589Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). [Lys]Pg was generated by Pm cleavage of [Glu]Pg (19Boxrud P.D. Bock P.E. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 13974-13981Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar), and the reaction mixture was chromatographed on soybean trypsin inhibitor-agarose in 10 mm Hepes, 10 mm Mes, 20 mm 6-AHA, 0.15 m NaCl, 1 mg/ml of PEG, pH 7.4, to remove Pm. [Lys]Pg was further purified by chromatography on aminohexyl-agarose (21Nieuwenhuizen W. Traas D.W. Thromb. Haemostasis. 1989; 61: 208-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). [Lys]Pg and [Lys]Pm form 2 were labeled at the catalytic site with ATA-FFR-CH2Cl and 5-(iodoacetamido)fluorescein to give [5F]FFR-[Lys]Pg and [5F]FFR-[Lys]Pm following the methods described previously (18Boxrud P.D.

The 5′ and 3′ primers were TCATCTATCATATGGCTGGACCTGAGTGGCTG and AAGGTTACCGAACCATC, respectively. Template DNA was pET-3a/SKC (24Fay W.P. Bokka L.V. Thromb. Haemostasis. 1998; 79: 985-991Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). The resulting product was digested with NdeI and AflII and then ligated into similarly restricted pET-3a/SKC. An analysis of a single clone (pET-3a/SK 2–414) confirmed the absence of unintended mutations in the SK sequence bounded by the NdeI and AflII sites. SK2–414 was expressed in BL21(DE3)pLysS and purified as described previously (24Fay W.P. Bokka L.V. Thromb. Haemostasis. 1998; 79: 985-991Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Protein sequence analysis confirmed that the amino terminus of the recombinant protein was alanine.

The absorption coefficient for SK78–414was calculated from the aromatic amino acid content (27Gill S.C. von Hippel P.H. Anal. Biochem. 1989; 182: 319-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (5005) Google Scholar). The peptides were SK1–15(IAGPEWLLDRPSVNN), SK1–10, SK1–5, SK1–2, a sequence-scrambled SK1–10 control peptide (ELGLDPWIAR), the dipeptides Ile-Val, Ac-Ile-Val, Phe-Val, Val-Val (Pg562–563), the peptides Pg562–565and Pg562–569 with Cys566 replaced by Ser (Pg562–569(C566S), VVGGSVAH), and SK1–10peptides with single Ala substitutions. All peptides except Ile-Val, Phe-Val, and Ile-Ala (SK1–2) were synthesized by SynPep (Dublin, CA) and were >95% pure. Ile-Val, Phe-Val, and SK1–2 were purchased in >99% purity from Bachem, Schweizerhall, and Sigma, respectively. Peptides were dissolved in buffer or water, and the concentrations were determined by weight. The solubility of SK1–10 and SK1–15 limited the concentrations of these peptides in the reactions to 3.5 and 1 mm, respectively. Fluorescence titrations were done with an SLM 8100 spectrofluorometer following methods described previously (18Boxrud P.D. Fay W.P. Bock P.E. J. Biol.

Blank-corrected titrations of [5F]FFR-[Lys]Pg and [5F]FFR- [Lys]Pm, expressed as the fractional change in the initial fluorescence ((F obs − F o)/F o =ΔF/F o) versus the total SK concentration, were analyzed by nonlinear least squares fitting of the quadratic binding equation (23Bock P.E.

The fitted parameters were the maximum fluorescence change and dissociation constant with the stoichiometric factor fixed at one or the previously determined value for that interaction. Uncertainties in reported parameters are ± 2 S.D. The activation of [Lys]Pg form 1 by SK species was measured by continuously monitoring the hydrolysis of 200 µm H-d-Val-Leu-Lys-p-nitroanilide (<5% substrate depletion) at 405 nm and 25 °C in 50 mmHepes, 0.125 m NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mg/ml of PEG, ± 10 or 50 mm 6-AHA as indicated, pH 7.4. For native and wild-type SK, the reactions were typically initiated by the addition of ≥13 nm SK to 5 nm [Lys]Pg. For mutant SK species with low activity, reactions were started by the addition of 500 nm SK mutant to 100 nm [Lys]Pg. For reactions in the presence of peptides, [Lys]Pg was preincubated for 5 min before initiation with the SK mutant. The slow background rate obtained with Pg alone was subtracted, and the progress curves, measured by the absorbance increase (ΔA 405 nm), were fit by the parabolic Equation 1 (28Wohl R.C. Summaria L.

ΔA405nm=V2t22+V1t(Eq. 1) This analysis gave the initial rate of chromogenic substrate hydrolysis at the beginning of the reaction (V 1) because of the conformationally activated SK·Pg* (where Pg* represents conformationally activated Pg) complex and the rate of the increase in activity with time due to Pm formation (V 2). For reactions in the presence of 6-AHA that were linear, V 1 was obtained from the slopes of the least squares fits of the absorbance versustime data. The potencies of the peptides were determined from the least squares fitted slopes of linear plots of V 1 as a function of peptide concentration. The effect of 2 mmSK1–10 on chromogenic substrate hydrolysis by the SK·Pm complex was measured from rates of reactions of 7 nm Pm after preincubation for 2–3 min with 58 nm wild-type SK, native SK, SK2–414, or 200 nmSK55–414 or SK78–414. The active site generated in [Lys]Pg by SK2–414 and SK1–10was specifically labeled with ATA-FFR-CH2Cl (18Boxrud P.D. Fay W.P. Bock P.E. J. Biol.

The reactions of 15 µm [Lys]Pg, equimolar SK2–414, and 100 µmATA-FFR-CH2Cl were incubated for 1 h in 50 mm Hepes, 0.125 m NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mg/ml of PEG, pH 7.4, at 25 °C in the presence and absence of 3 mm SK1–10 or the scrambled control peptide. Excess ATA-FFR-CH2Cl was removed by gel filtration on a 1-ml G-25-Sephadex spin column (Bio-Rad) equilibrated with 0.1m Hepes, 0.3 m NaCl, 10 mm 6-AHA, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mg/ml of PEG, pH 7.0. Fluorescein labeling was initiated by the addition of 0.1 m NH2OH in the presence of 100 µm 5-(iodoacetamido)fluorescein in the above pH 7.0 buffer followed by incubation at 25 °C for 1 h in the dark. Reactions in the above pH 7.4 buffer containing 50 mm 6-AHA were performed similarly at 5 µm[Lys]Pg, 15 µm SK2–414, and 3 mm SK1–10 when present. After incubation for 5 min with ATA-FFR-CH2Cl and removal of excess inhibitor, labeling was performed as described above. Samples were analyzed by 4–15% SDS polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The binding of SK2–414 to fluorescent analogs of Pg and Pm that were specifically labeled at the catalytic site with ATA-FFR-CH2Cl and 5-(iodoacetamido)fluorescein (18Boxrud P.D. Fay W.P. Bock P.E.

Titrations of fluorescein-labeled [Lys]Pg and [Lys]Pm with SK2–414 yielded dissociation constants of 31 ± 7 nm and 20 ± 12 pm, which were indistinguishable from those determined previously for native SK and [Lys]Pg of 44 ± 9 nm and the much tighter value of 11 ± 2 pm for [Lys]Pm (18Boxrud P.D. Fay W.P. Bock P.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 14579-14589Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 19Boxrud P.D. Bock P.E. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 13974-13981Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar) (Fig.1). The binding of recombinant wild-type SK was similarly indistinguishable from native SK with a dissociation constant for [Lys]Pg of 77 ± 12 nm (data not shown) and the previously determined value for [Lys]Pm of 33 ± 6 pm (18Boxrud P.D. Fay W.P. Bock P.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 14579-14589Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). The maximum fluorescence change observed for labeled Pm upon binding SK2–414 was −18 ± 2%, which was considerably less than the −52 ± 1% observed for native SK and −49 ± 1% for wild-type SK (18Boxrud P.D. Fay W.P. Bock P.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 14579-14589Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar), indicating significant differences in the active site environments of the SK·Pm and SK2–414·Pm complexes. In contrast to the results for Pm, SK2–414 binding to labeled Pg resulted in a maximum change in fluorescence of −24 ± 1%, which was indistinguishable from that of native SK (−28 ± 1%). These results showed that the lack of activity previously observed for SK2–414 (13Wang S. Reed G.L. Hedstrom L. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 5232-5240Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar,14Wang S. Reed G.L. Hedstrom L. Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 3994-4001Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar) was not attributed to the loss of affinity for [Lys]Pg or [Lys]Pm, and that the amino-terminal Ile residue did not contribute significantly to binding affinity. These results were in approximate agreement with the finding of ∼5-fold reduced affinity for SK2–414 compared with native SK, estimated from the kinetics of [Glu]Pg activation (13Wang S. Reed G.L. Hedstrom L. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 5232-5240Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). However, Ile1 was required to induce the full perturbation in the active site of Pm that accompanied the binding of SK as judged by the difference in the maximum fluorescence change. The activity of SK2–414 in plasminogen activation via the conformational change in Pg and the effect of synthetic peptides based on the SK amino-terminal sequence were examined in the kinetic studies of [Lys]Pg activation. Reactions were measured by continuous monitoring of the hydrolysis of the plasmin substrateH-d-Val-Leu-Lys-p-nitroanilide. As previously demonstrated (28Wohl R.C. Summaria L. Robbins K.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 2005-2013Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 29Kosow D.P. Biochemistry. 1975; 20: 4459-4464Crossref Scopus (57) Google Scholar), the addition of native SK to 5–20 nm Pg resulted in a parabolic increase in product concentration with time, which could be analyzed by the fitting of Equation 1 (see under “Experimental Procedures”) to extract the initial rate of chromogenic substrate hydrolysis (V 1 ) because of rapid conformational activation of Pg and the subsequent slower rate of proteolytic conversion of Pg to Pm (V 2 ) from the acceleration phase. The dependence of V 1 on chromogenic substrate concentration at saturating levels of SK showed Michaelis-Menten kinetics with parameters for the activated SK·Pg* complex of 37 ± 11 s−1 fork cat and 3.0 ± 1.1 mm fork m (data not shown). As observed previously (13Wang S. Reed G.L. Hedstrom L. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 5232-5240Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar), the reactions of Pg with saturating levels of SK2–414yielded progress curves with no initial activity followed after several minutes by rapid acceleration where the full-time course was not well described by Equation 1. Although this apparent change in mechanism is not completely understood, the acceleration phase has been previously shown to involve Pm formation (13Wang S. Reed G.L. Hedstrom L. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 5232-5240Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar) and may involve traces of Pm in Pg preparations that binds to SK2–414 and proteolytically activates Pg. This activation pathway has been suggested (13Wang S. Reed G.L. Hedstrom L. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 5232-5240Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar) to account for previous reports that SK species modified at the amino terminus retained activity (15Reed G.L. Lin L.-F. Parhami-Seren B. Kussie P. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 10266-10271Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 16Young K.-C. Shi G.-Y. Chang Y.-F. Chang B.-I. Chang L.-C. Lai M.-D. Chuang W.-J. Wu H.-L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 29601-29606Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Investigation of this secondary process was not pursued further, and the studies were focused onV 1, which was the rate of interest in conformational activation of Pg. The activity of SK2–414 was tested further at high sensitivity in kinetic studies at 100 nm [Lys]Pg and 500 nm SK2–414 in the absence and presence of the SK peptide SK1–10 (Fig. 2). Limiting the assays under these conditions to the initial phase of Pg activation resulted in progress curves that were well described by Equation 1 and allowed V 1 to be determined accurately (Fig. 2). SK2–414 alone had no detectable activity in conformational activation under these conditions as shown by the intercept of the linearly transformed data, corresponding to a value for V 1 that was indistinguishable from zero (Fig. 2, inset). An addition of 1 mmSK1–10, however, increased V 1dramatically indicating that the activity of SK2–414 in conformational activation was partially restored by the peptide (Fig.2). The specificity of the binding site for amino-terminal peptides was first characterized in similar kinetic studies of the effects of various peptides on conformational activation of [Lys]Pg by SK2–414. SK1–2, SK1–5, SK1–10, and SK1–15increased V 1 linearly with increasing peptide concentration (Fig. 3 A), indicating that the regained function in conformational activation was associated with a weak binding of the peptides to the SK2–414·Pg complex. The effectiveness of the peptides increased with increasing length past the amino-terminal dipeptide sequence through at least SK15 (Fig. 3 A). On the basis of the kinetic parameters determined for the SK·Pg* complex, SK1–10 and SK1–15 at 1 mmsupported a regain of 3.4 ± 1% and 11 ± 1% of the activity of native SK, respectively. Peptides corresponding to the Pg sequence, which normally inserts into the amino-terminal binding pocket upon proteolytic conversion to Pm, Pg562–563, Pg562–565, and Pg562–569(C566S), showed less activity than the SK peptides and no significant increase with increasing length (Fig. 3 A). Pg562–569(C566S), for example, was<5% as effective as SK1–10 in restoring conformational activation. A sequence-scrambled peptide of identical composition to SK1–10 induced no increase inV 1, indicating the sequence specificity of the interaction of SK2–414·Pg with SK1–10 (Fig.3 B). In other control experiments, SK1–10 had no significant effect on the kinetics of Pg activation by native SK or on the chromogenic substrate activity of the SK·Pm complex (data not shown). Active site-specific fluorescence labeling was used to confirm the identity of the active species formed in reactions of Pg with SK2–414 and SK1–10. Reaction mixtures containing [Lys]Pg and SK2–414 in the absence or presence of 3 mmSK1–10 or the presence of the same concentration of scrambled SK1–10 were inactivated with ATA-FFR-CH2Cl. The thiol group subsequently generated on the incorporated inhibitor was specifically labeled with 5-(iodoacetamido)fluorescein, and the reaction products were examined by SDS gel electrophoresis (Fig. 4). Covalent active site-specific labeling of Pg was observed in the presence of SK1–10 as evidenced by the intensely fluorescent band corresponding to Pg in the reduced sample (Fig. 4,A and B, lanes 5), whereas a less intense band was also present that corresponded to the labeled light chain of Pm formed during the experiment (Fig. 4 A andB, lanes 6 and 7). Although the control reactions showed a significantly lower fluorescein incorporation, essentially all of the Pg in these reactions were converted to Pm at the high protein concentrations necessary for the experiment (Fig. 4 B). Therefore, similar reactions were performed in the presence of 50 mm 6-AHA to inhibit proteolytic activation (30Alkjaersig N. Fletcher A.P. Sherry S. J. Biol. Chem. 1958; 234: 832-837Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar). It was first confirmed that under these conditions SK1–10 activated SK2–414 with indistinguishable potency as that seen in the absence of 6-AHA and also that the scrambled peptide was inactive (Fig. 3 B). Pg was not significantly converted to Pm under these conditions, and the Pg zymogen was intensely labeled in the presence of SK1–10 as before, whereas control reactions with scrambled SK1–10 or no peptide resulted in no significant labeling (Fig. 4, Cand D). These results clearly identified the intact Pg zymogen as the initially formed active species in the absence and presence of saturating 6-AHA and demonstrated that conformational activation required both SK2–414 and SK1–10. Previous studies (4Bode W. J. Mol. Biol. 1979; 127: 357-374Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar) of trypsinogen demonstrated the specificity of the amino-terminal binding cleft for dipeptides in which the natural Ile-Val sequence bound most tightly and the extension of the peptides to three residues had no further effect. As shown by the results in Fig. 3 A, the specificity of the analogous interaction of [Lys]Pg with dipeptides was characterized by very low but reproducible enhancements in the activity of comparable magnitude for Ile-Val and Ile-Ala (SK1–2). Ac-Ile-Val and Phe-Val had no detectable activity, as predicted from the studies of trypsinogen, because of the lack of a free amino terminus and steric hindrance, respectively (4Bode W. J. Mol. Biol. 1979; 127: 357-374Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the natural sequence in [Lys]Pm (Val-Val) was also inactive compared with Ile-Val, similar to the large difference in affinity observed for trypsinogen (4Bode W. J. Mol. Biol. 1979; 127: 357-374Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). These results supported the involvement of the amino-terminal binding site of Pg in the activation of the SK2–414·Pg complex by SK1–10 and suggested that the site had a trypsinogen-like specificity for dipeptides. To address the specificity of the interaction of SK1–10 in more detail, wild-type and nine single Ala-substituted SK1–10 peptides were compared in conformational activation in the absence and presence of near-saturating 6-AHA. The potencies of the peptides were assessed as described above from the slopes of linear plots of V 1 as a function of peptide concentration. As shown in Fig. 5, Ile1 and Gly3 were essential for peptide activity, whereas Trp6 and Arg10 contributed significant but smaller effects. Interestingly, the substitution of Asp9 by Ala had a potency-enhancing effect of 2-fold, suggesting a negative role for this residue in the native sequence. The results were indistinguishable for experiments in the presence and absence of 6-AHA with one exception. The substitution of Pro4 with Ala in SK1–10 had little effect on the reactivation of SK2–414 in the absence of 6-AHA but showed a large decrease in potency in the presence of the lysine analog (Fig. 5). The activity of this peptide in restoring conformational activation was apparently enhanced through lysine binding site interactions. The further truncated SK mutants SK55–414 and SK78–414 were also inactive in the conformational activation of [Lys]Pg, but unlike SK2–414, they showed no detectable reactivation by SK1–10 (Fig.3 B). The affinity of SK55–414 for [5F]FFR-[Lys]Pg was determined from fluorescence titrations (Fig.6) and compared with the previously determined affinity of this mutant for [5F]FFR-[Lys]Pm (18Boxrud P.D. Fay W.P. Bock P.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 14579-14589Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar) and the corresponding affinities of fluorescein-labeled Pg and Pm for native and wild-type SK (18Boxrud P.D. Fay W.P. Bock P.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 14579-14589Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 19Boxrud P.D. Bock P.E. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 13974-13981Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). SK55–414 was shown previously to bind labeled [Lys]Pm with a dissociation constant of 4 ± 1 nm, 360-fold more weakly than native SK (11 ± 2 pm) (18Boxrud P.D. Fay W.P. Bock P.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 14579-14589Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). By contrast, SK55–414 bound to [Lys]Pg with a dissociation constant of 79 ± 24 nm, indicating a <2-fold lower affinity compared with the dissociation constants of 44 ± 9 nm for native SK (18Boxrud P.D. Fay W.P. Bock P.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 14579-14589Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 19Boxrud P.D. Bock P.E. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 13974-13981Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar) (Fig.6) and 77 ± 12 for wild-type recombinant SK. The maximum fluorescence change for SK55–414 binding to labeled [Lys]Pg of −35 ± 3% was similar to the amplitude for native SK of −28 ± 1% (19Boxrud P.D. Bock P.E. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 13974-13981Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Thus, the near total loss of reactivation of SK55–414 in conformational activation by SK1–10 was correlated with a differential loss of affinity for the activated catalytic domain of Pm of ∼360-fold, whereas the binding to [Lys]Pg was affected <2-fold. This demonstrated a critical role for residues 3–54 of the SK α-domain in the preferentially high affinity of SK for Pm compared with Pg in conformational activation. The results of these studies support the molecular sexuality hypothesis (5Bode W. Huber R. FEBS Lett. 1976; 68: 231-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar, 13Wang S. Reed G.L. Hedstrom L. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 5232-5240Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar) and extend the understanding of the conformational activation mechanism in the conclusion that the combination of sequence-specific interactions of SK1–10 with the amino-terminal binding cleft of Pg and enhanced binding affinity of SK2–414 for the activated conformation of the Pg catalytic domain are both critical elements of the mechanism. As expected from previous studies of trypsinogen and Ile-Val (4Bode W. J. Mol. Biol. 1979; 127: 357-374Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar, 5Bode W. Huber R. FEBS Lett. 1976; 68: 231-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar), the combination of SK1–10and SK2–414 was less effective in Pg activation than native SK. This was consistent with the apparently low intrinsic affinity of the amino-terminal interaction and the loss of proximity and orientation available to the SK sequence in the intact molecule. Unlike previous studies of this site in trypsinogen, however, the SK peptides increased in potency with increasing length beyond the dipeptide and were significantly more effective than comparable Pg peptides. Moreover, an analysis of SK2–414 reactivation by each of wild-type and nine Ala-substituted SK1–10 peptides demonstrated that not only Ile1 but also Gly3and, to a lesser extent, Pro4, Trp6, Asp9, and Arg10 played significant roles in determining the specificity of the peptide interaction. On this basis, the results are concluded to reflect the specificity of the interactions of the SK1–10 sequence with sites that extend beyond the amino-terminal dipeptide binding site. It is important to consider the possible effect of the 2–10 residue sequence present on SK2–414 in activation by the peptides. The removal of Ile1 in SK2–414 that normally anchors the amino-terminal binding interaction may result in weakening the binding of the remaining SK2–10 sequence to Pg or disordering of the SK2–10 segment. The latter possibility is suggested by the disordered structure of this sequence when SK is bound to micro-Pm where Val562 occupies the amino-terminal binding site and Ile1 does not interact (17Wang X. Lin X. Loy J.A. Tang J. Zhang X.C. Science. 1998; 281: 1662-1665Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar). In either case, the results would reflect the specificity of the amino-terminal binding site on Pg in the SK2–414·Pg complex, although the possibility that the peptides interact with the SK component of the complex cannot be ruled out completely. The SK1–10 sequence specificity of the amino-terminal interaction is suggested to contribute to the narrow specificity of SK for the activation of Pg among homologous zymogens. The fluorescence probe in [5F]FFR-[Lys]Pm is thought to be in or near the S4 substrate specificity subsite. Previous studies with similar tripeptide fluorescence probes and chromogenic substrates demonstrated that the probes did not report changes affecting S1 but reported effects on the specificity of the S2 subsite, and these changes contributed to those reported by the probes located in the vicinity of S4 (18Boxrud P.D. Fay W.P. Bock P.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 14579-14589Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 19Boxrud P.D. Bock P.E. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 13974-13981Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Thus, the sources of the fluorescence changes include changes in the environment of the S2-S4 subsites, if not other events as well. In this context, the dissimilar maximum fluorescence changes observed with SK2–414 and native SK binding to [5F]FFR-[Lys]Pm but not for [5F]FFR-[Lys]Pg are thought to represent Ile1-dependent differences in the subsite perturbations of Pg and Pm. Further studies will be needed to resolve the net fluorescence changes accompanying SK binding into the individual sources of the perturbations. The inability of SK1–10 to complement the activity of SK55–414 and SK78–414 compared with SK2–414 was correlated with a 360-fold reduced affinity of SK55–414 for labeled [Lys]Pm (18Boxrud P.D. Fay W.P. Bock P.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 14579-14589Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar), whereas the affinity for labeled [Lys]Pg was not significantly affected. This indicated that the interactions of residues 3–54 of the SK α-domain were not essential for Pg binding but were essential for both preferentially tighter binding of SK to Pm and for conformational activation of Pg. Together, the results support a mechanism in which the insertion of Ile1 of SK into the amino-terminal binding cleft acts as the trigger to initiate the transition of Pg toward the active conformation. This is thought to occur in cooperation with preferential stabilization of the active zymogen species as a result of the higher affinity of SK for the activated conformation of the Pg catalytic domain.

In this study, we investigated the effects of mutant K-ras on apoptosis in vitro following DNA damage. To avoid complications resulting from mutations in other cancer-related genes and from the presence of endogenous K-ras, we derived K-ras null embryonic stem cells. Expression of either wild-type or mutant K-ras was reconstructed by stable plasmid transfection. The cell lines were treated with etoposide, cisplatin and UV radiation and apoptosis measured flow cytometrically. Mutant K-ras potentiated the effect of etoposide-derived DNA damage by increasing apoptosis, whereas absence of K-ras had the opposite effect. This pattern was similar but less marked with cisplatin, whereas UV yielded no difference in apoptosis with regard to K-ras status, suggesting that the effect of K-ras on apoptosis is dependent on the nature of the DNA damage. To investigate possible mechanisms, we examined the expression of p19(ARF) mRNA by RT-PCR. Cells expressing mutant K-ras produced elevated levels of p19(ARF) mRNA, which could link K-ras status with p53 expression and hence susceptibility to DNA damage-induced apoptosis."

Science. 1996; 274: 782-784Crossref PubMed Scopus (2919) Google Scholar, 6Hsu H. Shu H.B. Pan M.G. Goeddel D.V.

Cell. 1994; 78: 681-692Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (923) Google Scholar). TNFR-bound TRAFs have been shown to induce NF-κB activation through down-regulation of I-κB, an inhibitor of NF-κB (8Karin M. Cancer J. Sci. Am. 1998; 4 (Suppl 1): S92-S99PubMed Google Scholar). Down-regulation of I-κB results from I-κB phosphorylation by I-κB kinases (IKKs) and ubiquitin-dependent degradation of the phosphorylated I-κB (9Zandi E. Rothwarf D.M. Delhase M. Hayakawa M. Karin M. Cell. 1997; 91: 243-252Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1562) Google Scholar). Three isoforms of IKK have been identified: α, β, and γ. Studies using knockout mice have shown that IKKβ is responsible for the TNF-α-induced NF-κB activation (10Li Q. Van Antwerp D. Mercurio F. Lee K.F. Verma I.M. Science. 1999; 284: 321-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (847) Google Scholar), whereas IKKα is dispensable for the TNF-α signaling (11Li Q. Lu Q. Hwang J.Y. Buscher D. Lee K.F. Izpisua-Belmonte J.C. Verma I.M. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 1322-1328Crossref PubMed Scopus (416) Google Scholar). Nonenzymatic IKKγ/NEMO induces the formation of an IKKα and IKKβ complex (12Harhaj E.W. Sun S.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 22911-22914Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). In addition to the activation of the IKKs by IKKγ-mediated complex formation, IKKα and IKKβ can be activated by phosphorylations catalyzed by upstream kinases such as the NF-κB inducing kinase (NIK) (13Woronicz J.D. Gao X. Cao Z. Rothe M. Goeddel D.V. Science. 1997; 278: 866-869Crossref PubMed Scopus (1060) Google Scholar), MEKK1 (14Lee F.S. Hagler J. Chen Z.J. Maniatis T. Cell. 1997; 88: 213-222Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (658) Google Scholar) and Akt (15Ozes O.N. Mayo L.D. Gustin J.A. Pfeffer S.R. Pfeffer L.M. Donner D.B. Nature. 1999; 401: 82-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (1866) Google Scholar). NIK and MEKK1 have been reported to directly interact with TRAF2. Thus, TRAF2 has been thought to be an important component of the TNFR signaling complexes in the NF-κB activation (16Malinin N.L. Boldin M.P. Kovalenko A.V. Wallach D. Nature. 1997; 385: 540-544Crossref PubMed Scopus (1157) Google Scholar, 17Baud V. Liu Z.G. Bennett B. Suzuki N. Xia Y. Karin M. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 1297-1308Crossref PubMed Scopus (400) Google Scholar). However, a recent study using TRAF2-null mice has demonstrated that the TNF-α-induced NF-κB activation is intact while the TNF-α-induced c-Jun N-terminal kinase activation is defective in the TRAF2-deficient cells (18Yeh W.C. Shahinian A. Speiser D. Kraunus J. Billia F. Wakeham A. de la Pompa J.L. Ferrick D. Hum B. Iscove N. Ohashi P. Rothe M. Goeddel D.V. Mak T.W. Immunity. 1997; 7: 715-725Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (706) Google Scholar). Therefore, the major physiological function of TRAF2 may be the activation of the c-Jun N-terminal kinase pathway through physical interaction with mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase kinase kinases such as MEKK1 (17Baud V. Liu Z.G. Bennett B. Suzuki N. Xia Y. Karin M. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 1297-1308Crossref PubMed Scopus (400) Google Scholar) and apoptosis-stimulating kinase 1 (19Nishitoh H. Saitoh M. Mochida Y. Takeda K. Nakano H. Rothe M. Miyazono K. Ichijo H. Mol. Cell. 1998; 2: 389-395Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (566) Google Scholar) rather than the activation of the NF-κB pathway. Receptor-interacting protein (RIP) has been shown to interact with cell surface receptors containing death domains such as TNFR1, Fas, and TNF-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL), and with cytoplasmic adaptor proteins containing death domains such as Fas-associated death domain and TNFR-associated death domain (20Hsu H.

RIP can also associate with proteins involved in the NF-κB signaling such as TRAF2, Epstein-Barr virus-latent membrane protein 1, p62, and IKKγ (25Sanz L. Sanchez P. Lallena M.J. Diaz-Meco M.T.

Immunity. 2000; 12: 419-429Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (353) Google Scholar). It has been reported previously that RIP-deficient thymocyte cells were defective in TNF-α-induced NF-κB activation but not c-Jun N-terminal kinase activation (29Kelliher M.A. Grimm S. Ishida Y. Kuo F. Stanger B.Z. Leder P. Immunity. 1998; 8: 297-303Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (907) Google Scholar). Although RIP possesses serine/threonine kinase activity, the biological significance of the kinase activity is not yet clearly understood, and the physiological substrates of RIP have not yet been identified. In the present study, we investigated the mechanism underlying the RIP-mediated IKK activation to understand the role of RIP in the NF-κB signaling pathway. We demonstrate here that MEKK1 is a substrate of RIP. The RIP-induced phosphorylation of MEKK1 enhances enzymatic activity of MEKK1, and it then contributes to the TNF-α-induced activation of NF-κB. Mouse monoclonal anti-hemagglutinin (HA) antibody was purchased from Roche Molecular Biochemicals. Mouse monoclonal anti-FLAG antibody was purchased from Stratagene, and mouse monoclonal anti-Myc antibody was from Santa Cruz, Inc. Human recombinant TNF-α was bought from R&D Systems. Mouse monoclonal anti-RIP and anti-MEKK1 antibodies were purchased from Pharmingen.32PO4, [γ-32P]ATP, and [35S]methionine were purchased from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. pRK7-FLAG-IKKα, pRK5-FLAG-IKKβ, pRK5-FLAG-IKKβ(K44A), and pRK7-FLAG-NIK were kindly provided by Dr. David Goeddel (Tularik Inc.). Fragments of the human RIP gene (20Hsu H. Huang J. Shu H.B. Baichwal V. Goeddel D.V. Immunity. 1996; 4: 387-396Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (964) Google Scholar) were isolated by polymerase chain reaction and cloned into the BamHI/XhoI sites of pcDNA3-HA or pGEX-4T-1. Derivatives of MEKK1 were produced by polymerase chain reaction from pcDNA3-HA-MEKK1 (30Widmann C. Gerwins P. Johnson N.L. Jarpe M.B. Johnson G.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 2416-2429Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar) and cloned into theBamHI/EcoRI sites of the pCMV2-FLAG vector (Kodak) or the BamHI/SalI sites of pGEX-4T-1 (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Point mutations of MEKK1 were produced using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). Vector constructs were transfected into human embryonic kidney 293 (HEK293) cells using LipofectAMINE (Life Technologies, Inc.) and RIP(−) Jurkat cells by electroporation at 0.4 kV and 960 microfarads using an electroporator (Bio-Rad). HEK293 cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. Wild type and RIP(−) Jurkat cells (31Ting A.T. Pimentel-Muinos F.X. Seed B. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6189-6196Crossref PubMed Scopus (464) Google Scholar) were grown in RPMI 1640 with 10% fetal bovine serum. Phosphorylation of MEKK1 in cells was examined as described previously (32Chaplin D.D. Wedner H.J. Parker C.W. J. Immunol. 1980; 124: 2390-2398PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, wild type or RIP(−) Jurkat cells were incubated in phosphate-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% phosphate-free fetal bovine serum for 1 h and labeled with 100 µCi/ml carrier-free32PO4. Cells were then treated with 20 ng/ml TNF-α or 80 J/m2 UV and incubated further for 10 or 30 min, respectively. Cells were lysed and subjected to immunoprecipitation using anti-MEKK1 antibody. The immunopellets were analyzed by 8% SDS-PAGE and autoradiography. To assess the transcription stimulating activity of NF-κB, pcDNA3-3X-NF-κB-Luc, and pcDNA3-β-galactosidase were cotransfected with various vector constructs into the cells, and luciferase activities in the transfected cells were measured using a luciferase assay kit (Promega). Luciferase activity was normalized relative to the coexpressed β-galactosidase activity. IKK activity was measured by the method of Regnier et al. (33Regnier C.H. Song H.Y. Gao X. Goeddel D.V. Cao Z. Rothe M. Cell. 1997; 90: 373-383Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1069) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were transfected with FLAG-IKKα, FLAG-IKKβ, or other indicated constructs. Where indicated, the cells were treated for 20 min with 20 ng/ml recombinant human TNF-α at 48 h after the transfection. The cell lysates were subjected to immunoprecipitation using anti-FLAG antibody. IKK activity in the immunocomplexes was determined by incubating them at 30 °C for 30 min in a reaction buffer containing 20 mm HEPES (pH 7.5), 20 mmβ-glycerophosphate, 10 mm MgCl2, 100 mm Na3VO4, 2 mmdithiothreitol, 20 mm ATP, 100 µCi/ml [γ-32P]ATP, and 2 µg GST-I-κBβ. Phosphorylation of GST-I-κBβ was analyzed by 10% SDS-PAGE followed by autoradiography. c-Jun N-terminal kinase 1 and MEKK1 activity was measured by a procedure described previously (34Minden A. Lin A. McMahon M. Lange-Carter C. Derijard B. Davis R.J. Johnson G.L. Karin M. Science. 1994; 266: 1719-1723Crossref PubMed Scopus (1009) Google Scholar). c-Jun N-terminal kinase 1 and MEKK1 activity was monitored by following the phosphorylation of GST-c-Jun and GST-SEK1(K129R) or GST-IKKα(1–200), respectively. To assess the phosphorylation of MEKK1 by RIP, HEK293 cells were transfected with HA-RIP or MEKK1(K1253M)-FLAG construct. After 48 h of transfection, the cells were subjected to immunoprecipitation using anti-HA or anti-FLAG antibody. HA-RIP immunoprecipitates were then used for the RIP kinase assay by incubating with MEKK1(K1253M)-FLAG immunoprecipitates at 30 °C for 30 min in a reaction buffer containing 20 mmHEPES (pH 7.3), 10 mm MnCl2, 10 mmMgCl2, and 100 µCi/ml [γ-32P]ATP as described elsewhere (31Ting A.T. Pimentel-Muinos F.X. Seed B. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6189-6196Crossref PubMed Scopus (464) Google Scholar). Either RIP or MEKK1 was labeled with [35S]methionine by in vitrotranscription/translation procedures using the Quick-coupled TNT kit (Promega). The 35S-labeled proteins were incubated with 1 µg of GST fusion proteins in binding buffer consisting of 20 mm Tris (pH 7.4), 100 mm NaCl, 2 mmEDTA, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 0.05% bovine serum albumin, and 5% glycerol (35Takayama S. Sato T. Krajewski S. Kochel K. Irie S. Millan J.A. Reed J.C. Cell. 1995; 80: 279-284Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (793) Google Scholar) at 4 °C for 1 h. The GST-fusion proteins were recovered using glutathione-Sepharose 4B resins (Amersham Pharmacia), and washed three times with PBS (pH 7.4). The 35S-labeled proteins bound to the GST fusion proteins were analyzed by 10% SDS-PAGE and autoradiography. Coimmunoprecipitation experiments were performed following a procedure described previously (20Hsu H. Huang J. Shu H.B. Baichwal V. Goeddel D.V. Immunity. 1996; 4: 387-396Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (964) Google Scholar) with some modification. Transfected cells were lysed in a buffer containing 50 mm HEPES (pH 7.4), 150 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 1 mm EDTA, 20 mm NaF, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. The cell lysates were subjected to immunoprecipitation using appropriate antibodies. The immunoprecipitates were resolved by SDS-PAGE and analyzed by immunoblot probed with the indicated antibodies. The death domain serine/threonine kinase RIP plays a key role in the TNF-α-induced activation of NF-κB (29Kelliher M.A. Grimm S. Ishida Y. Kuo F. Stanger B.Z. Leder P. Immunity. 1998; 8: 297-303Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (907) Google Scholar). TNF-α induces NF-κB activation through IKK activation and the subsequent IKK-mediated phosphorylation of I-κB. Phosphorylated I-κB undergoes ubiquitin-mediated degradation (36DiDonato J.A. Hayakawa M. Rothwarf D.M. Zandi E. Karin M. Nature. 1997; 388: 548-554Crossref PubMed Scopus (1890) Google Scholar). To understand better the role of RIP in the regulation of the NF-κB pathway, we investigated the mechanism by which RIP mediates the TNF-α-induced IKK activation. We transfected HEK293 cells with expression vectors producing HA-tagged RIP variants and FLAG-tagged IKKα or IKKβ. We then examined IKKα or IKKβ activity in the transfected cells (Fig. 1). Because overexpression of RIP alone can induce apoptotic cell death (22Stanger B.Z. Leder P. Lee T.H. Kim E. Seed B. Cell. 1995; 81: 513-523Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (853) Google Scholar), a caspase inhibitor crmA was coexpressed to prevent RIP-induced apoptosis. Ectopic expression of RIP or its mutants did not affect IKKα activity (Fig. 1 B). In contrast, the ectopic RIP induced an increase in the IKKβ activity in the transfected cells. IKKβ can be phosphorylated and activated by mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase kinases such as NIK (13Woronicz J.D. Gao X. Cao Z. Rothe M. Goeddel D.V. Science. 1997; 278: 866-869Crossref PubMed Scopus (1060) Google Scholar) or MEKK1 (14Lee F.S. Hagler J. Chen Z.J. Maniatis T. Cell. 1997; 88: 213-222Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (658) Google Scholar, 37Nakano H. Shindo M. Sakon S. Nishinaka S. Mihara M. Yagita H. Okumura K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 3537-3542Crossref PubMed Scopus (471) Google Scholar). We therefore examined the action of RIP on the upstream kinases of IKKβ, NIK, and MEKK1 (Fig.2 A). Ectopic RIP induced the stimulation of NIK or MEKK1 activity for phosphorylating IKKα. A kinase-inactive RIP mutant, RIP(K45R), was also able to activate NIK, but not MEKK1. This suggests that the kinase activity of RIP may be critical for MEKK1 activation, but not for NIK activation. Furthermore, the RIP-induced activation of IKKβ was inhibited by a kinase-inactive MEKK1 mutant, MEKK1(K1253M), but not by a kinase-inactive NIK mutant, NIK(K293A/K294A) (Fig. 2 B). These data suggest that MEKK1 may mediate the RIP-induced activation of IKKβ. The involvement of MEKK1 in the RIP-induced activation of IKKβ was supported further by data showing that the RIP-induced stimulation of NF-κB activity was repressed by coexpression of MEKK1(K1253 m) (Fig.2 C). To test whether RIP could physically associate with MEKK1, we carried out in vitrobinding experiments using in vitro translated [35S]methionine-labeled RIP and recombinant GST-MEKK1 variants that were immobilized on glutathione-agarose beads (Fig.3 A). 35S-Labeled RIP physically associated with GST-MEKK1-M (amino acids 821–1172), which contains the conserved Cdc42/Rac interactive binding motif (38Gerwins P. Blank J.L. Johnson G.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 8288-8295Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). We also carried out in vitro binding analyses using35S-labeled MEKK1 and recombinant GST-RIP fragments (Fig.3 B). The in vitro binding data indicate that the binding of RIP to MEKK1 occurred in the intermediate domain (ID) of RIP (Fig. 3 B). Next, we examined whether RIP and MEKK1 would bind to each other in intact cells. HEK293 cells were cotransfected with full-length MEKK1-FLAG and HA-tagged RIP variants (Fig.3 C) or full-length HA-RIP and FLAG-tagged MEKK1 variants (Fig. 3 D). The coimmunoprecipitation results indicated that MEKK1 physically interacted with RIP or RIP-ID but not with RIP lacking ID (RIP-ΔID) (Fig. 3 C). RIP bound to MEKK1 or MEKK1-M in intact cells (Fig. 3 D). Furthermore, TNF-α treatment increased the interaction between RIP and MEKK1 in the cotransfected cells (Fig. 3 E). The TNF-α-dependent increase in the interaction between RIP and MEKK1 was reduced by overexpressed RIP-ΔID. RIP-ΔID contains a C-terminal death domain, which is involved in the interaction with TNFR-associated death domain during TNF-α signaling (20Hsu H. Huang J. Shu H.B. Baichwal V. Goeddel D.V. Immunity. 1996; 4: 387-396Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (964) Google Scholar, 21Liu Z.G. Hsu H. Goeddel D.V. Karin M. Cell. 1996; 87: 565-576Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1778) Google Scholar, 27Zhang S.Q. Kovalenko A. Cantarella G. Wallach D. Immunity. 2000; 12: 301-311Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (391) Google Scholar). We also examined the physical interaction between the two endogenous RIP and MEKK1 proteins in HEK293 cells. Immunoblot analysis of protein complexes immunoprecipitated with anti-MEKK1 antibody showed that endogenous RIP protein physically interacted with endogenous MEKK1 in intact cells and that this interaction was enhanced when the cells had been exposed to TNF-α (Fig. 3 F). Our data in Figs. 2 and 3 suggested that MEKK1 functioned as a downstream signal of RIP and that MEKK1 was physically associated with RIP in intact cells. We therefore examined whether RIP could phosphorylate MEKK1. We used MEKK1(K1253M) to avoid the basal autophosphorylation of MEKK1. RIP and MEKK1(K1253M) were immunoprecipitated from TNF-α-treated HEK293 cells, and in vitro phosphorylation of the immunopellets was tested (Fig. 4 A). Interestingly, RIP enhanced the phosphorylation of MEKK1(K1253M), suggesting that RIP could phosphorylate MEKK1. The phosphorylation of MEKK1 by RIP was examined further using GST fusion proteins as substrates. RIP phosphorylated MEKK1(821–1172) but not NIK, IKKα, or TRAF2 (Fig. 4 B). Next, we constructed various MEKK1 fragments to map the in vitro phosphorylation sites of MEKK1(821–1172) (Fig. 4 C). The in vitrophosphorylation study showed that MEKK1 phosphorylation by RIP occurred at a site(s) between amino acids 922 and 1021. MEKK1(922–1021) was then divided further into three fragments to identify the phosphorylation site(s). RIP-dependent in vitrophosphorylation was observed in two fragments: amino acids 953–981 and 982–1021 (Fig. 4 C). Next, we replaced the serine or threonine residues in the two fragments with alanine and tested whether the mutations would prevent any phosphorylation by RIP (Fig.4 D). Our data demonstrate that RIP-dependent phosphorylation was abolished by the mutations of MEKK1 at Ser-957 and Ser-994. These findings strongly suggest that RIP phosphorylates MEKK1 at Ser-957 and Ser-994. We next examined the effect of the RIP-mediated MEKK1 phosphorylation on the activation of IKKβ and NF-κB (Fig.5, A and B). Overexpression of RIP, MEKK1, or both induced IKKβ activation in the transfected HEK293 cells. The forced expression of MEKK1(S957A/S994A) resulted in a complete inhibition of the RIP-induced IKKβ activation (Fig. 5 A). Overexpressed MEKK1(S957A/S994A) also abolished RIP-induced NF-κB activation (Fig. 5 B). MEKK1(S957A/S994A) expression also blocked RIP-induced c-Jun N-terminal kinase 1 activation in the transfected cells (data not shown). We examined further the effect of the RIP-induced MEKK1 phosphorylation on the MEKK1 activity (Fig.6). Ectopically expressed RIP induced a stimulation of the MEKK1 activity phosphorylating its substrates GST-IKKα(1–200) and GST-SEK1(K129R), whereas RIP(K45R) did not affect the MEKK1 activity (Fig. 6 A). MEKK1(S957A/S994A) failed to phosphorylate the substrates regardless of the coexpression of RIP or RIP(K45R). The involvement of MEKK1 phosphorylation in RIP-induced MEKK1 activation is supported further by our results showing that TNF-α induced the stimulation of MEKK1, but not that of MEKK1(S957A/S994A) (Fig. 6 B). These results suggest that the RIP-catalyzed MEKK1 phosphorylation at Ser-957 and Ser-994 is important for TNF-α-induced MEKK1 activation. To understand better the mechanism of the RIP-induced MEKK1 activation, we examined the phosphorylation of MEKK1 and the TNF-α-stimulated MEKK1 activity in RIP(−) Jurkat cells (31Ting A.T. Pimentel-Muinos F.X. Seed B. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6189-6196Crossref PubMed Scopus (464) Google Scholar) (Fig. 7). Our metabolic labeling study using 32PO4 demonstrated that TNF-α induced an increase in MEKK1 phosphorylation in wild type Jurkat cells but not in RIP(−) Jurkat cells (Fig. 7 A). In comparison, UV irradiation resulted in an increase in MEKK1 phosphorylation both in wild type and RIP(−) Jurkat cells. These results suggest that RIP mediates the TNF-α-induced, but not UV-induced, phosphorylation of endogenous MEKK1 in Jurkat cells. Furthermore, the phosphorylation of MEKK1 was recovered in RIP(−) Jurkat cells when the cells were transfected with a RIP construct (Fig. 7 B). However, RIP did not increase the phosphorylation of MEKK1(S957A/S994A) in RIP(−) Jurkat cells. We also examined the effect of TNF-α on the endogenous MEKK activity in phosphorylating IKKα or SEK1 in wild type and RIP(−) Jurkat cells (Fig. 7 C). The TNF-α treatment resulted in an increase in MEKK1 activity in wild type Jurkat cells but not in RIP(−) cells. Collectively, these data suggest that RIP is a major mediator of the TNF-α-induced activation of MEKK1. The death domain Ser/Thr kinase RIP has been shown to be a factor required for TNF-α-induced NF-κB activation (20Hsu H. Huang J. Shu H.B. Baichwal V. Goeddel D.V. Immunity. 1996; 4: 387-396Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (964) Google Scholar, 22Stanger B.Z. Leder P. Lee T.H. Kim E. Seed B. Cell. 1995; 81: 513-523Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (853) Google Scholar). A study using thymocytes from RIP(−)-deficient mice has shown complete absence of TNF-α-induced NF-κB activation (29Kelliher M.A. Grimm S. Ishida Y. Kuo F. Stanger B.Z. Leder P. Immunity. 1998; 8: 297-303Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (907) Google Scholar). RIP can activate IKKs through interaction with IKKγ/NEMO, a regulatory subunit of the IKK complex (27Zhang S.Q. Kovalenko A. Cantarella G. Wallach D. Immunity. 2000; 12: 301-311Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (391) Google Scholar, 28Devin A. Cook A. Lin Y. Rodriguez Y. Kelliher M. Liu Z. Immunity. 2000; 12: 419-429Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (353) Google Scholar), suggesting that RIP activates the NF-κB signal pathway through the direct interaction with this IKK complex. However, the role of kinase activity of RIP in the TNF-α-induced signaling cascades has not yet been clarified. In the present study, we show that RIP can phosphorylate MEKK1 and that the RIP-mediated MEKK1 phosphorylation results in both ΘKKβ and NF-κB activation. We show in this study that RIP induces the activation of IKKβ but not IKKα in transfected cells. The intermediate domain of RIP alone can also induce the IKKβ activation. The IKKβ activity in cells overexpressing wild type RIP appears to be higher than that of cells overexpressing the intermediate domain only. It may be proposed, therefore, that the noncatalytic intermediate domain of RIP is involved in the RIP-induced IKKβ activation, but the kinase activity of RIP is required for maximal activation of IKKβ by RIP. Because the intermediate domain of RIP can associate with IKKγ (27Zhang S.Q. Kovalenko A. Cantarella G. Wallach D. Immunity. 2000; 12: 301-311Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (391) Google Scholar), the activation of IKKβ by the intermediate domain may result from the interaction of the intermediate domain with IKKγ. In addition, RIP has been shown to oligomerize itself through the C-terminal death domain in the absence of TNF-α (20Hsu H. Huang J. Shu H.B. Baichwal V. Goeddel D.V.

The oligomerization of RIP might induce a partial activation of the downstream signaling components, whereas the kinase activity might be required for maximal activation. This may reconcile our results with previous reports stating that the kinase activity of RIP is not essential for RIP-induced NF-κB activation (20Hsu H. Huang J. Shu H.B. Baichwal V. Goeddel D.V. Immunity. 1996; 4: 387-396Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (964) Google Scholar, 31Ting A.T. Pimentel-Muinos F.X. Seed B. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6189-6196Crossref PubMed Scopus (464) Google Scholar). We show here that MEKK1 mediates RIP-induced IKKβ activation. IKKβ can be phosphorylated and activated by NIK (16Malinin N.L. Boldin M.P. Kovalenko A.V. Wallach D. Nature. 1997; 385: 540-544Crossref PubMed Scopus (1157) Google Scholar), MEKK1 (14Lee F.S. Hagler J. Chen Z.J. Maniatis T. Cell. 1997; 88: 213-222Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (658) Google Scholar), and Akt (40Romashkova J.A. Makarov S.S. Nature. 1999; 401: 86-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (1654) Google Scholar). MEKK1 preferentially activates IKKβ, whereas NIK activates IKKα more effectively (37Nakano H. Shindo M. Sakon S. Nishinaka S. Mihara M. Yagita H. Okumura K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 3537-3542Crossref PubMed Scopus (471) Google Scholar). We demonstrated here that the kinase activity of RIP is required for the stimulation of MEKK1 but not for the stimulation of NIK. Involvement of MEKK1 in RIP-induced IKKβ activation is supported further by the data showing that the kinase-inactive mutant, MEKK1(K1253M) suppressed the RIP-induced activation of IKKβ. Our data suggest that RIP induces stimulation of the MEKK1-mediated NF-κB signaling pathway via a direct interaction of RIP with MEKK1. It has been reported previously that both RIP and MEKK1 can interact with TRAF2 (17Baud V. Liu Z.G. Bennett B. Suzuki N. Xia Y. Karin M. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 1297-1308Crossref PubMed Scopus (400) Google Scholar), suggesting a complex formation between MEKK1 and RIP through TRAF2. Our in vitro binding data, however, indicate that RIP can bind to MEKK1 without the participation of TRAF2. The intermediate domain of RIP is important for the interaction between RIP and MEKK1. As reported previously, the intermediate domain also seems to be involved in physical interactions with other proteins such as TRAF2, p62, Epstein-Barr virus-latent membrane protein 1, and IKKγ (21Liu Z.G. Hsu H. Goeddel D.V. Karin M. Cell. 1996; 87: 565-576Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1778) Google Scholar, 25Sanz L. Sanchez P. Lallena M.J. Diaz-Meco M.T. Moscat J.

Immunity. 2000; 12: 301-311Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (391) Google Scholar). It may be proposed, therefore, that the intermediate domain may be a docking site for the interactions of RIP with various signaling components and that the downstream signaling may be determined by which signaling component(s) is bound to the intermediate domain of RIP. RIP can phosphorylate MEKK1 at Ser-957 and Ser-994, resulting in MEKK1 stimulation. Interestingly, a replacement of one serine residue with alanine diminishes the phosphorylation of the other serine residue in MEKK1 by RIP. These findings imply that there might be a cross-regulatory interaction between the Ser-957 and Ser-994 residues in MEKK1, although the detailed mechanism underlying the MEKK1 phosphorylation by RIP needs to be investigated further. Both of the phosphorylation sites are followed by a proline residue, suggestingS/T-P as a putative RIP phosphorylation site. This motif has been also observed in sites phosphorylated by cyclin-dependent kinase (41Pearson R.B. Kemp B.E. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 200: 62-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (865) Google Scholar) and MAP kinase (42Davis R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 14553-14556Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It suggests that the properties of the kinase activity of RIP might resemble those of cyclin-dependent kinase or MAP kinase. Interestingly, it has been reported recently that RIP2, one of the RIP kinase family members, possesses MAP kinase kinase activity (43Navas T.A. Baldwin D.T. Stewart T.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 33684-33690Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar), although RIP2 failed to phosphorylate MEKK1 in our experiments (data not shown). RIP has been shown to mediate TNF-α-induced signaling for apoptosis (22Stanger B.Z. Leder P. Lee T.H. Kim E. Seed B. Cell. 1995; 81: 513-523Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (853) Google Scholar, 44Pimentel-Muinos F.X. Seed B. Immunity. 1999; 11: 783-793Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar) as well as for cell survival via NF-κB activation (29Kelliher M.A. Grimm S. Ishida Y. Kuo F. Stanger B.Z. Leder P. Immunity. 1998; 8: 297-303Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (907) Google Scholar). RIP can function as a proapoptotic factor when it is cleaved by caspase-8 during TNF-α-induced apoptosis (45Lin Y. Devin A. Rodriguez Y. Liu Z. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 2514-2526Crossref PubMed Scopus (655) Google Scholar, 46Kim J.W. Choi E.J. Joe C.O. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 4491-4499Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). The proapoptotic C-terminal cleavage product of RIP in turn stimulates caspase-8 and caspase-3, although it attenuates the TNF-α-induced IKKβ activation (46Kim J.W. Choi E.J. Joe C.O. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 4491-4499Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). In addition, the caspase-8-cleaved RIP does not stimulate MEKK1 (data not shown). Recent studies suggest that MEKK1 is a negative regulator of apoptosis (47Yujiri T. Sather S. Fanger G.R. Johnson G.L. Science. 1998; 282: 1911-1914Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar, 48Minamino T. Yujiri T. Papst P.J. Chan E.D. Johnson G.L. Terada N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 15127-15232Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar), whereas the caspase-3-cleaved MEKK1 fragment becomes proapoptotic (49Hibi M. Lin A. Smeal T. Minden A. Karin M. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 2135-2148Crossref PubMed Scopus (1697) Google Scholar, 50Cardone M.H. Salvesen G.S. Widmann C. Johnson G. Frisch S.M. Cell. 1997; 90: 315-323Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (457) Google Scholar). The cleavage of MEKK1 by caspase-3 separates the RIP-catalyzed phosphorylation sites (Ser-957 and Ser-994) from the C-terminal catalytic domain of MEKK1, which is a constitutively active form. Thus, the caspase-3-cleaved active form of MEKK1 cannot be phosphorylated by RIP. Therefore, the caspase-3-induced MEKK1 cleavage and the caspase-8-induced RIP cleavage may prevent RIP from stimulating MEKK1 activity for activation of the IKKβ-NF-κB pathway. Furthermore, overexpression of MEKK1(S957A/S994A) enhances TNF-induced apoptotic cell death in HEK293 cells (data not shown). Collectively, our findings and those of others suggest that the RIP-mediated MEKK1 phosphorylation may be important for the cell survival mechanism of the IKKβ-NF-κB pathway, whereas the caspase signaling cascades may terminate the IKKβ-NF-κB signaling by cleaving both RIP and MEKK1.

When LM (expressing p53) and LME6 (lacking p53) cells were exposed to the genotoxinN-methyl-N-nitro-N-nitrosoguanidine (MNNG), both cell lines underwent cytolysis in a very similar manner, suggesting the presence of a p53-independent apoptotic response to this genotoxic stress. To determine whether sphingolipids such as ceramide might serve as mediators in this system, the responses of these cells to exogenous sphingolipids as well as their changes in endogenous sphingolipid levels after DNA damage were examined. Treatment with exogenous C2-ceramide and sphingosine led to cell death in both LM and LME6, and treatment of the LME6 cells with MNNG resulted in a transient increase in intracellular ceramide of ∼50% over a period of 3 h. Finally, treatment with the de novo inhibitor of ceramide synthesis ISP-1 protected LME6 cells from MNNG-triggered cell death. This MNNG-triggered induction of ceramide was not observed in the p53-expressing LM cells, suggesting that it may be down-regulated by p53. Although ceramide-mediated cell death can proceed in the absence of p53, exogenously added C2-ceramide increased the cellular p53 level in LM cells, suggesting that the two pathways do interact.

In addition, ceramide can activate the stress-activated protein kinase/Jun-N-terminal kinase cascade, which is thought to play a central role in various stress responses (23Coroneos E. Wang Y.

Damage can be induced by exposure to UV- or γ-irradiation, environmental chemicals, or therapeutic reagents. Several signal transduction pathways involved in the cellular response to genotoxic stress have been identified, one of which is mediated by the tumor suppressor protein p53 (reviewed in Refs. 27Evan G. Littlewood T. Science. 1998; 281: 1317-1322Crossref PubMed Scopus (1363) Google Scholar, 28Levine A.J. Cell. 1997; 88: 323-331Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (6759) Google Scholar, 29Wang X. Ohnishi T. J. Radiat. Res. 1997; 38: 179-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). After genotoxic stress, the cellular level of p53 is increased (30Fritsche M. Haessler C. Brandner G. Oncogene. 1993; 8: 307-318PubMed Google Scholar, 31Kastan M.B. Onyekwere O. Sidransky D.

This protein then functions as a transcriptional modulator to activate or repress specific gene expression. One possible outcome is G1/S arrest, which allows repair of damaged DNA before replication, whereas a second possible outcome is apoptosis. In either case, replication of damaged DNA is prevented. The mechanism leading to this increased p53 protein level is stabilization of the protein, which is caused by changes in the phosphorylation and acetylation of p53 through the activation of several pathways, including the Jun-N-terminal kinase/stress-activated protein kinase pathways (33Chiarugi V. Cinelli M. Magnelli L. Oncology Res. 1998; 10: 55-57PubMed Google Scholar, 34Kubbatat M.H. Vousden K.H. Mol. Med.

It has been proposed that many, if not all, genotoxic response pathways converge on p53, allowing it to serve as the “universal sensor of genotoxic stress” (37Liu Z.G. Baskaran R. Lea-Chou E.T. Wood L.D. Chen Y. Karin M. Wang J.Y. Nature. 1996; 384: 273-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar). However, there are also studies indicating the presence of a p53-independent pathway in the genotoxic stress response (38Strasser A. Harris A.W. Jacks T. Cory S. Cell. 1994; 79: 329-339Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (679) Google Scholar). Recently, a role for ceramide in the genotoxic response has been proposed (1Dbaibo G.S. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 1997; 25: 557-561Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar, 2Hannun Y.A. Science. 1996; 274: 1855-1859Crossref PubMed Scopus (1500) Google Scholar). For example, Santana et al. (39Santana P. Pena L.A. Haimovitz-Friedman A. Martin S. Green D. McLoughlin M. Cordon-Cardo C. Schuchman E.H. Fuks Z. Kolesnick R. Cell. 1996; 86: 189-199Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (729) Google Scholar) showed that acid sphingomyelinase-deficient human lymphoblasts and mice were unable to generate ceramide and undergo apoptosis after exposure to ionizing radiation; these responses were restored after transfecting the cells with cDNA encoding human acid sphingomyelinase. Other reports also suggest that radiation can affect ceramide levels (24Huang C. Ma W. Ding M. Bowden G.T. Dong Z. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 27753-27757Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar, 40Brenner B. Koppenhoefer U. Weinstock C. Linderkamp O. Lang F. Gulbins E. J. Biol.

Haimovitz-Friedman A. Fuks Z. Kolesnick R.N. Nature. 1996; 380: 75-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (1718) Google Scholar). However, whether this induction of ceramide is a general response to genotoxic stress or whether it is limited to ionizing or UV radiation has not been demonstrated. N-methyl-N-nitro-N-nitrosoguanidine (MNNG),1 a substance found in cigarette smoke, is a monofunctional alkylating agent. These chemicals target the cellular DNA and induce severe genotoxic stress to the cell that can result in chromosomal aberrations, sister chromatid exchanges, point mutations, and cell death. Therefore, most such alkylating agents, including MNNG, are considered genotoxic mutagens and carcinogens (42Smart R.C. Carcinogenesis. Appleton & Lange, East Norwalk, CT1994Google Scholar). MNNG treatment also induces apoptosis in cell culture, and this process can be inhibited by the Bcl-2 protein (43Hour T. Shiau S.L. Lin J. Toxicol. Lett. 1999; 110: 191-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the Jun-N-terminal kinase/stress-activated protein kinases and p38 kinase are activated in MNNG-treated cells (44Wilhelm D. Bender K. Knebel A. Angel P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 4792-4800Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar), and our laboratory has previously shown that treatment with MNNG can activate the p53 pathway (32Yang J. Duerksen-Hughes P. Carcinogenesis. 1998; 19: 1117-1125Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Because of the ability of sphingolipids to mediate growth arrest and apoptosis and the growing evidence suggesting their possible role in responses to DNA damage, we wished to investigate whether sphingolipids such as ceramide might mediate cellular responses to DNA damage induced by genotoxins such as MNNG. We also wished to determine whether the sphingolipid- and p53-mediated pathways, both of which can lead to growth arrest and apoptosis, might interact with each other. C2-ceramide (Cer), C2-dihydroceramide (DHCer), ISP-1 (myriocin), sphingosine (So), sphinganine (Sa), and sphingosine 1-phosphate were obtained from Biomol (Plymouth Meeting, PA) and prepared following the manufacturer's instruction and Hannun et al. (45Hannun Y.A. Merrill A.H. Bell R.M. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 201: 316-328Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Briefly, Cer was dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide (Me2SO) as a 60 mm stock solution; So was dissolved in ethanol as a 100 mm stock solution; DHCer was dissolved in methanol as a 15 mm stock solution; Sa was dissolved in Me2SO as a 10 mm stock solution; and sphingosine 1-phosphate was dissolved in Me2SO as a 5 mm stock solution. MNNG was obtained from Aldrich (Milwaukee, WI). LM mouse fibroblast cells were cultivated in minimum essential medium (MEM) (Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Life Technologies, Inc.). LME6 cells were derived from LM cells that were cotransfected with pSV2neo and the human papilloma virus 16 E6 gene, which mediates the rapid degradation of p53 through the ubiquitin pathway. They express E6 mRNA, and their level of p53 is undetectable even after genotoxin treatment (46Duerksen-Hughes P.J. Yang J. Schwartz S.B. Virology. 1999; 264: 55-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). They were cultured as were the LM cells with the exception that G418 (Life Technologies, Inc.) was present in the medium. LMD cells were derived from LM cells that were cotransfected with pSV2neo and a mutant version of the human papilloma virus 16 E6 gene (deleted for amino acids 106–110) that does not mediate the rapid degradation of p53 (Refs. 46Duerksen-Hughes P.J. Yang J. Schwartz S.B. Virology. 1999; 264: 55-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar and references therein). They were cultured as were the LME6 cells. The medium was changed to MEM with 2% fetal bovine serum or to serum-free Opti-MEM (Life Technologies, Inc.) before treatment with sphingolipids. The delivery of sphingolipids using the bovine serum albumin solution was carried out as described by Hannun et al. (45Hannun Y.A. Merrill A.H. Bell R.M. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 201: 316-328Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Cells were assayed for p53 by ELISA as described previously (32Yang J. Duerksen-Hughes P. Carcinogenesis. 1998; 19: 1117-1125Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were removed from the plate by trypsinization, concentrated by centrifugation (10 min, 1,000 rpm), and suspended in phosphate-buffered saline/TDS (50 mmNa2HPO4, 17 mmNaH2PO4, 68 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, pH 7.4, with 1% aproteinin added before use). After lysis, lysates were stored at −80 °C for no more than 1 week before analysis. The ELISA analysis used pAB122 (hybridoma was obtained from ATCC, and antibodies were purified from the culture medium using protein-A Sepharose) as the primary or capture antibody, biotinylated anti-p53 (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) as the detection antibody, and glutathione S-transferase (GST)-p53 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) as a standard. Each point was measured in triplicate, and results were normalized to the amount of protein present in each sample to control for any variability in the number of cells recovered from each plate. Protein concentration was determined by the bicinchoninic acid assay (BCA assay) (Pierce). The cellular levels of the Bax protein were determined by Western blot as described previously (32Yang J. Duerksen-Hughes P. Carcinogenesis. 1998; 19: 1117-1125Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar), with the exception that anti-Bax was used as the primary antibody rather than anti-p53. Briefly, after electrophoresis, proteins were transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane (Micron Separations Inc., Westborough, MA) and incubated with anti-Bax (2 µg/ml) (Oncogene, Cambridge, MA), and the Bax protein was detected using the Kirkegaard and Perry Laboratories (Gaithersburg, MD) chemiluminescent horseradish peroxidase system following the manufacturer's instructions. Apoptosis was measured by the cell death detection ELISA (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). The assay is based on the quantitative sandwich enzyme immunoassay principle using mouse monoclonal antibodies directed against DNA and histones. This allows the specific determination of mono- and oligonucleosomes in the cytoplasmic fraction of cell lysate. The cell death detection ELISA was conducted as described by the manufacturer. Briefly, lysates were added to wells to which the anti-histone antibody had been fixed adsorptively. Nucleosomes in the sample bound via their histone components to the immobilized anti-histone antibody. Anti-DNA peroxidase, which binds to the DNA portion of the nucleosomes, was then added. The amount of bound peroxidase was determined photometrically by measuring absorbance at 405 nm after the addition of 2,2′-azino-di(3-ethylbenzthiazolin sulfonate) (ABTS) as substrate. The CellTiter 96Aqueous One Solution cell proliferation assay (Promega, Madison, WI) is a colorimetric method for determining the number of viable cells in proliferation or cytotoxicity assays. It contains a tetrazolium compound, 3-(4, 5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-5-(3-carboxymethoxyphenyl)-2-(4-sulfophenyl)-2H-tetrazolium inner salt (MTS), which is bioreduced by viable cells into a colored formazan product that is soluble in tissue culture medium. It was preformed according to the manufacturer's instruction. Briefly, 1 × 104 cells were seeded into a 96-well culture plate (Corning Glass, Corning, NY) and treated with the indicated concentrations of sphingolipids or genotoxins for the specified times. 20 µl of the CellTiter solution was added directly to each culture well and incubated at 37 °C for 2 h, and the absorbance at 490 nm was determined in a Bio-Rad microplate reader. 1 × 105 cells were seeded into 12-well plates (Corning) and grown in 3 ml of media. After treatment, cells were harvested with 0.25% trypsin, and the number of Trypan blue-excluding cells was determined using a hemacytometer. Determination and quantification of intracellular ceramide content were performed as described (22Xu J. Yeh C.H. Chen S. He L. Sensi S.L. Canzoniero L.M. Choi D.W. Hsu C.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 16521-16526Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar) with some modifications. 1 × 106 cells were cultured in MEM (10% fetal bovine serum) with 10 µCi of [3H]palmitate (Sigma) for 16–24 h before the addition of MNNG. After further incubation for the times indicated (allowing the labeled palmitate to remain in the culture medium), cells were harvested by scraping into a glass tube and pelleted by centrifugation. Lipid was extracted as described (47Merrill A.H. Wang E. Mullins R.E. Jamison W.C.L. Nimkar S. Liotta D. Anal. Biochem. 1988; 171: 373-381Crossref PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar). Briefly, CH3OH (2 ml) and CHCl3 (0.5 ml) were added to the cells, followed by H2O (3 ml), and the mixture was vortexed and centrifuged to separate the phases. After transfer of the organic phase to a clean tube, residual proteins were removed by an additional extraction with H2O, then the organic phase was transferred to a sodium sulfate column to remove residual H2O. The eluate was vacuum-dried and resuspended in 40 µl of chloroform:CH3OH (20:1, v/v). Half was used to determine the total counts of the labeled lipids, whereas the other half was analyzed by thin layer chromatography (TLC) (Panvera, Madison, WI) using chloroform:acetone:methanol:acetic acid:H2O (50:20:15:10:5) as the solvent system. Lipids were visualized by iodine vapor, and the radioactive spots corresponding to ceramide were scraped off and quantitated by liquid scintillation counting. The ceramide standard used was obtained from Matreya, Inc. (Pleasant Gap, PA). Determination and quantification of intracellular sphinganine and sphingosine contents was performed as described (47Merrill A.H. Wang E. Mullins R.E. Jamison W.C.L. Nimkar S. Liotta D. Anal. Biochem. 1988; 171: 373-381Crossref PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar). Briefly, lipids were extracted as above except that the cells were not radiolabeled. The acylglycerolipids were cleaved by incubation with 0.1 m KOH in CH3OH and chloroform (2:1, v/v). The free long-chain bases were then recovered in the chloroform phase and derivatized witho-phthalaldehyde (Sigma). The HPLC analyses were performed using an Isco (Lincoln, NE) model 2300 pump with a Waters (Milford, MA) Nova Pak C18 column (5 µm, 3.9 × 150) and a Nova Pak C18 guard column (Waters). Sphingosine and C20-sphingosine standards (Matreya, Inc.) were prepared by dissolving them in EtOH to make 5 mm stocks. They were then serially diluted to 10 µm. 10 µl of each of the standards was derivatized with o-phthalaldehyde, and the final volume was made up to 1 ml with CH3OH, 5 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.0 (90:10, v/v), yielding a final standard concentration of 100 pm. LM is a mouse fibroblast cell line that expresses p53, whereas LME6 is a cell line derived from LM cells transfected with the human papilloma virus 16 E6 protein. In contrast to the parental LM cells, LME6 cells express no detectable p53 either before or after genotoxin treatment (46Duerksen-Hughes P.J. Yang J. Schwartz S.B. Virology. 1999; 264: 55-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). They are therefore able to serve as a system in which to study genotoxin-triggered apoptotic pathways other than those mediated by p53. As shown in Fig. 1, LME6 cells were killed by MNNG treatment to an extent and with kinetics essentially equivalent to that of the parental LM cells, as measured by either the cell death ELISA (Fig. 1 A) or a cell viability assay (CellTiter assay) (Fig. 1 B). The ability of MNNG to induce cell death in the absence of p53 indicated that these cells possess a p53-independent pathway to apoptosis. Because of the well documented ability of sphingolipids such as ceramide and sphingosine to cause cell cycle arrest and apoptosis (25Jarvis W.D. Kolesnick R.N. Fornari F.A. Traylor R.S. Gewirtz D.A.

If these sphingolipids are important in mediating MNNG-triggered apoptosis in LME6 cells, one prediction was that the addition of these compounds exogenously should also cause cell death in LME6 cells. LM and LME6 cells treated with ceramide at different concentrations (Fig. 2 A, top panel) or for different times (Fig. 2 B, top panel) experienced a loss of viability in a time- and dose-dependent manner as measured by the CellTiter assay. Cells undergoing cell death also demonstrated the budding morphologically associated with apoptosis. Additionally, flow cytometry results using propidium iodide staining of fixed cells showed the characteristic apoptotic peak of cells containing less than 2N DNA in ceramide-treated cells but not control cells (data not shown). Sphingosine, another member of the sphingolipid family, had a similar effect on both LM and LME6 cells (Fig. 2, A andB, middle panel). However, DHCer, a closely related molecule considered to be largely biologically inactive, had little or no effect on the cell viability at a similar concentration, although it did demonstrate cytotoxic effects at much higher concentrations (Fig. 2, A and B, bottom panel). The effects noted with DHCer indicate that it may not be completely biologically inactive. When observed over a period of days, untreated cells proliferated vigorously, as assessed by a direct cell count (Fig. 3). Ceramide and sphingosine treatment, on the other hand, resulted in an inhibition of LM and LME6 proliferation that was essentially comparable for the two cell types, whereas DHCer treatment did not inhibit proliferation (Fig. 3). These results indicated that ceramide and sphingosine can induce cell death regardless of the presence or absence of p53.Figure 3Cell proliferation measured by direct cell count for LM and LME6 cells treated with Cer (25 µm), So (25 µm), or DHCer (20 µm) for a 3-day period.

To test this prediction, LME6 cells were treated with MNNG, and their cellular ceramide levels were measured. As shown in Fig. 4, the ceramide level rose in LME6 cells after treatment with MNNG. An increase of ∼50% was achieved within the first 3 h, and this increase was transient, since the ceramide level began to drop after that point, returning to the control level by 6 h. There was no further change through 24 h post-treatment (data not shown). In an effort to identify a possible role for other sphingolipids in this response, the cellular levels of sphingosine and sphinganine were also measured by HPLC. Our results demonstrated that there was no significant change in either the sphingosine or sphinganine level after MNNG treatment (data not shown), excluding their involvement in the response. To determine whether MNNG treatment causes the accumulation of ceramide in cells expressing p53 as well as in those lacking p53, the parental LM cells were treated with the genotoxin, and their cellular ceramide levels were measured. As shown in Fig. 4, ceramide did not accumulate in MNNG-treated LM cells. Later measurements (up to 24 h) also showed no accumulation of ceramide (data not shown). These results suggest that ceramide does not play an important role in mediating MNNG-triggered apoptotic signals in LM cells. However, LM cells did activate their p53 pathway after MNNG treatment (Fig. 5). Within 2 h post-treatment, p53 levels began to rise, reaching a maximum value 12 h post-treatment (panel A). The levels of Bax, a p53-regulated protein involved in apoptosis (54Miyashita T. Krajewski S. Krajewska M. Wang H.G. Lin H.K. Liebermann D.A. Hoffman B. Reed J.C. Oncogene. 1994; 9: 1799-1805PubMed Google Scholar), were also observed to rise, showing a detectable increase 12 h post-treatment (panel B), and these events were followed by an increase in cell death which was maximal 16 h post-treatment (panel C). In contrast, neither p53 levels nor those of Bax increased after treatment of LME6 cells with MNNG (data not shown). The difference in the ceramide response of LM and LME6 cells could be due either to the fact that LM cells express p53, whereas LME6 cells do not, or to the fact that LME6 cells express the viral E6 protein, whereas LM cells do not. To address this question, a third cell line was tested for its"

Here we provide evidence that the periplasmic Cu,Zn-superoxide dismutase from this organism is a heme-binding protein, unlike all the other known Cu,Zn-superoxide dismutases from bacterial and eukaryotic species. When the H. ducreyi enzyme was expressed inEscherichia coli cells grown in standard LB medium, it contained only limited amounts of heme covalently bound to the polypeptide but was able efficiently to bind exogenously added hemin. Resonance Raman and electronic spectra at neutral pH indicate thatH. ducreyi Cu,Zn-superoxide dismutase contains a 6-coordinated low spin heme, with two histidines as the most likely axial ligands. By site-directed mutagenesis and analysis of a structural model of the enzyme, we identified as a putative axial ligand a histidine residue (His-64) that is present only in theH. ducreyi enzyme and that was located at the bottom of the dimer interface. The introduction of a histidine residue in the corresponding position of the Cu,Zn-superoxide dismutase fromHaemophilus parainfluenzae was not sufficient to confer the ability to bind heme, indicating that other residues neighboring His-64 are involved in the formation of the heme-binding pocket. Our results suggest that periplasmic Cu,Zn-superoxide dismutase plays a role in heme metabolism of H. ducreyi and provide further evidence for the structural flexibility of bacterial enzymes of this class.

Zn-SOD, Cu,Zn-superoxide dismutase resonance Raman Luria-Bertani broth polymerase chain reaction polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis 6-coordinated low spin Bacteria have evolved different strategies to acquire iron, an essential element for all organisms, and to protect themselves from its potential toxic effects (1Guerinot M.L. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 1994; 48: 743-772Crossref PubMed Scopus (536) Google Scholar). The problem of iron availability is particularly important for those microorganisms that colonize animal hosts, where most of the extracellular iron is tightly bound to plasma proteins. Strategies to overcome limitation in iron availability include the production of siderophores and the use of host compounds containing iron, such as heme, hemoglobin, transferrin, and lactoferrin (2Wandersman C. Stojiljkovic I. Curr. Opin. Microbiol. 2000; 3: 215-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar). Haemophilus ducreyi, the etiological agent of the sexually transmitted human genital ulcerative disease known as chancroid, is unable to synthesize heme, and therefore must obtain this from its host. Although chancroid is relatively uncommon in the United States and Western Europe, it is one of the most prevalent sexually transmitted diseases worldwide and is an important cause of morbidity in the developing world. Recent studies have provided evidence that chancroid is a significant cofactor for the heterosexual spread of the human immunodeficiency virus, type 1, increasing the risk of acquiring human immunodeficiency virus infection 2–5-fold (3Wasserheit J.N. Sex. Transm. Dis. 1992; 19: 61-77Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 4Telzak E.E. Chiasson M.A. Bevier P.J. Stoneburner R.L. Castro K.G. Jaffe H.W. Ann. Intern. Med. 1993; 119: 1181-1186Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). This observation, together with the emergence of antibiotic-resistant strains in areas where this disease is widespread, has stimulated increasing research effort aimed at understanding the pathogenesis of chancroid and characterizing H. ducreyi virulence factors, including proteins involved in heme uptake, that might be exploited in developing new strategies to prevent infection. Free heme, hemoglobin, or catalase can supply the iron and heme requirement for H. ducreyi in vitro (5Lee B.C. J. Med. Microbiol. 1991; 34: 317-322Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar, 6Totten P.A. Stamm W.E. J. Clin. Microbiol. 1994; 32: 2019-2023Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).

Recently, it has been observed that an H. ducreyi hemoglobin receptor mutant is unable to initiate disease, thus suggesting that the main source of heme in vivo is hemoglobin (9Al-Tawfiq J.A.

A few other putative virulence determinants of H. ducreyihave been described, including a hemolytic cytotoxin (10Palmer K.L. Munson Jr., R.S. Mol.

In view of its periplasmic location, it has been proposed that bacterial Cu,Zn-SOD, by its ability to scavenge the superoxide radical at diffusion-controlled rates, could provide protection from the oxygen free radicals produced in the respiratory burst of the phagocytic host defense. This hypothesis is supported by recent studies that have shown that periplasmic Cu,Zn-SOD could confer protection from oxidative damage caused by exposure to phagocytic cells (17De Groote M.A. Ochsner U.A.

Battistoni A. Polizio F. Desideri A. Rotilio G. FEBS Lett. 1994; 356: 314-316Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar) as a template. Amplified DNA was digested withNcoI and EcoRI and inserted in the corresponding sites of plasmid pHEN-1 (34Hoogenboom H. Griffiths A.D. Johnson K.S. Chiswell D.J. Hudson P. Winter G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 4133-4137Crossref PubMed Scopus (893) Google Scholar). Site-specific mutants were prepared according to a procedure described previously (41Folcarelli S. Battistoni A. Falconi M. O'Neill P. Rotilio G. Desideri A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 244: 908-911Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar), involving a two-step PCR. In the first step of H. ducreyi Cu,Zn-SOD mutant construction, we used the oligonucleotide 5′-CTAAGCTTAAGGAGATAAAATGAAATTA as a 5′ primer and the mutagenic primers, HdH60Q (5′-TCCGTGGGCTAAATCTTGTAATTTTGG), HdH64E (5′-GCCATGTAATCCTTCGGCTAAATCGTG), HdH60Q, H64E (5′-TCCTTCGGCTAAATCTTGTAATTTTGG), and HdM123L (5′-AGGATCATGTAACACAAATAA) and pIT4 as a template. The PCR-amplified DNA fragments were purified from agarose gels and used as primers in the second step of amplification in combination with the 3′ primer 5′-CCTGAATTCTTATTTAATTACACCGCATGCC. The resulting amplified DNAs, encompassing the whole sequence coding for mature Cu,Zn-SOD, were restricted with NcoI and EcoRI and ligated into plasmid pHEN-1, thus obtaining plasmids pPHduSODQ60, pPHduSODE64, pPHduSODQ60E64, and pPHduSODL123. The same approach was used to construct plasmid pPHpSODH64. In this case the mutagenic primer was HpH64 (5′-GCCATGTAAACCGTGAGCTAAACCTTG) and the external primers were Hfor (5′-AACCATGGCCCATGACCATATGGCAAAAC) and Hrev (5′-CTGAATTCTTATTTAATCACGCCA- CATGC). Overexpression of wild type and mutants Cu,Zn-SODs was carried out in E. coli71/18 cells grown at 37 °C in LB medium containing 100 µg/ml ampicillin. When cells reached an A 600 value of 0.5, Cu,Zn-SOD expression was induced by the addition of 0.1 mm isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside, 0.25 mm CuSO4, and 10 µmZnSO4. Cells were harvested by centrifugation 16 h after induction. Wild type H. ducreyi Cu,Zn-SOD was purified from periplasmic extracts by immobilized metal affinity chromatography on a nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid (NTA) resin (Qiagen), as described (35Battistoni A. Pacello F. Mazzetti A.P. Capo C. Kroll S.J. Langford P.R. Donnarumma G. Valenti P. Rotilio G. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 275: 30315-30325Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (52) Google Scholar). The affinity purified enzyme was further subjected to gel filtration chromatography on a High Load 16/60 Superdex 75 gel filtration FPLC (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Samples of H. ducreyi Cu,Zn-SOD were subjected to different ion exchange chromatography tests on Mono Q HR 5/5 or Mono S HR FPLC columns (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) with different buffers and pH conditions. Partial separation of the heme-containing Cu,Zn-SOD from the heme-devoid enzyme was obtained using the cationic exchange column Mono S, equilibrated with 20 mm potassium phosphate, pH 6.5, eluting the enzyme with a 0–0.1 m NaCl gradient. Pure heme-devoid enzyme was obtained by E. coli H500 cells grown for 24 h in LB medium supplemented with 0.2% glucose, 0.05 mm isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside, 0.125 mm CuSO4, and 5 µmZnSO4. It should be noted that H500 cells grow very poorly, and after 24 h of growth at 37 °C theA 600 of cultures never exceeded 0.5. H. parainfluenzae and the N-terminal deleted H. ducreyi Cu,Zn-SODs were purified as described (35Battistoni A. Pacello F. Mazzetti A.P. Capo C. Kroll S.J. Langford P.R. Donnarumma G. Valenti P.

Polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis under denaturing conditions (SDS-PAGE) was performed according to Laemmli (42Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207218) Google Scholar) using a 12.5% resolving gel and a 4.5% stacking gel. Samples were heated at 100 °C for 5 min in a buffer containing 0.1% SDS and 10% β-mercaptoethanol. Gels were stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue. In order to detect covalent heme binding by Cu,Zn-SOD, SDS-PAGE gels were stained for heme-dependent peroxidase activity using 3,3′,5,5′-tetramethylbenzidine as an oxidizable substrate, according to established procedures (43Thomas P.E. Ryan D. Levin W. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 75: 168-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (896) Google Scholar). Before electrophoresis samples were heated for 5 min at 100 °C in a sample buffer containing 0.1% SDS but devoid of β-mercaptoethanol. Electrophoresis was carried out using the buffer system described by Laemmli (42Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207218) Google Scholar), with the addition of 2 mm EDTA. Gels were immersed in a 30:70 methanol, 0.25m sodium acetate, pH 5.0 solution, containing 1.25 mm 3,3′,5,5′-tetramethylbenzidine and kept in constant shaking at room temperature. After 30 min H2O2was added to 26 mm. After shaking for a further 15 min, the same quantity of H2O2 was again added. Gels were photographed immediately. Protein concentration was determined by the Lowry method, using bovine serum albumin as a standard (44Lowry H.O. Rosebrough N.J. Farr L.A. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Cu,Zn-SOD molar concentrations were determined assuming a molecular mass of 38,172 and 32,972 Da for dimeric wild type and N-terminal deleted H. ducreyi enzyme, respectively. Superoxide dismutase activity was assayed by the pyrogallol method (45Marklund S. Marklund G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1974; 47: 469-474Crossref PubMed Scopus (8067) Google Scholar). Pyridine hemochromes of Cu,Zn-SOD samples were obtained by diluting the enzyme with alkaline pyridine and then adding solid sodium dithionite to the protein solution. Absorption spectra were recorded in a PerkinElmer Life Sciences Lambda 2 spectrophotometer thermostated at 25 °C, using 1-cm path length cuvettes. Heme content in purified Cu,Zn-SOD solutions was determined from the absorbance of the α-peak (at 551–556 nm) of the pyridine hemochrome (46Smith L. Methods Enzymol. 1978; 53: 202-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar), using the ε value of 34500 m−1cm−1 for samples obtained from hemin-supplemented LB (which contain only limited amounts of covalently bound heme) or the ε value of 29100m−1 cm−1for samples obtained from standard LB medium. It should be noted, however, that such extinction coefficients provide only an approximate value of heme concentration in Cu,Zn-SOD, due to the variable amount of covalently bound heme in each protein sample. Acid-acetone heme extraction was carried out as described by Di Iorio (47Di Iorio E.E. Methods Enzymol. 1981; 76: 57-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar), by dropping small amounts of Cu,Zn-SOD into a large volume excess of cold (−20 °C) acid/acetone, prepared by adding 2 ml of 12n HCl to 1 liter of acetone. After 10 min of centrifugation at 17,000 × g, the supernatant was discarded, and the same operation was repeated. Once clear of all traces of acetone, the final precipitate was dissolved in 100 mm phosphate buffer, pH 7.0, and the heme content was reanalyzed. 0.5 mg of heme-deficient wild type (from H500 E. coli cells) or His-64 → Glu mutant H. ducreyi Cu,Zn-SOD (≅0.013 µmol of enzyme) was dissolved in 400 µl of 10 mm phosphate buffer, pH 8.0, placed in dialysis bags, and dialyzed against 1 liter of the same buffer containing 8.48 mg of hemin (13 µmol) with constant stirring. After 15 h of dialysis at room temperature, the samples were extensively dialyzed against 10 mm phosphate buffer, pH 8.0 (with several changes of the buffer), to remove unbound hemin. The heme content of each sample was assessed by recording the enzyme absorption spectra in the visible region, whereas the presence of covalently bound heme was evaluated by acid/acetone extraction and by the staining of SDS-PAGE gels for heme-dependent peroxidase activity. Resonance Raman (RR) and electronic absorption spectra were carried out in 10 mm sodium phosphate buffer at pH 7.0. The protein samples (N-del 1 and N-del 2) used for spectral analysis were obtained from cells grown in hemin-enriched LB or in standard LB, respectively; N-del 1 contained less than 10% covalently bound heme, whereas N-del 2 contained about 90% covalent heme. The ferrous forms were prepared by adding a minimum volume of fresh sodium dithionite solution to a deoxygenated buffered solution. Protein concentration was about 0.04–0.15 mm for RR spectroscopy and about 0.05–0.1 mm for the UV-visible absorption measurements. The absorption spectra were recorded with a Cary 5 spectrophotometer. The RR spectra were obtained with excitation from the 406.7-nm line of a Kr+ laser (Coherent Radiation) and the 514.5-nm line of an Ar+ laser (Coherent Radiation, Innova/5). The back-scattered light from a slowly rotating NMR tube was collected and focused into a computer-controlled double monochromator (Jobin-Yvon HG2S) equipped with a cooled photomultiplier (RCA C31034 A) and photon-counting electronics. Polarized spectra were obtained by inserting a Polaroid analyzer between the sample and the entrance slit of the spectrometer. The depolarization ratios of the bands at 314 and 460 cm−1 of CCl4 were measured to check the reliability of the polarization measurements using a rotating NMR tube with a back-scattered geometry. The values obtained, 0.73 and 0.0, compare favorably with the theoretical values, 0.75 and 0.0, respectively. To minimize the heating effects induced on the protein by the laser beam, RR spectra were collected using a rotating NMR tube cooled by a gentle flow of N2 gas passed through liquid N2. RR spectra were calibrated with indene as standard. The frequencies were accurate to ±1 cm−1 for the intense isolated bands and to about ±2 cm−1 for overlapped bands or shoulders. A molecular model ofH. ducreyi Cu,Zn-SOD was generated using the Swiss PDB-Viewer (48Guex N. Peitsch M.C. Electrophoresis. 1997; 18: 2714-2723Crossref PubMed Scopus (9587) Google Scholar) starting from the x-ray structure of the highly homologous Cu,Zn-SOD from A. pleuropneumoniae (see Ref. 26Forest K.T. Langford P.R. Kroll J.S. Getzoff E.D. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 296: 145-153Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, Protein Data Bank code 2aps.pdb). Eighteen residues (out of the 155 present in each monomer) were mutated in order to account for all the differences between the two enzymes. The periplasmic extracts from E. coli 71/18 cells expressing H. ducreyi Cu,Zn-SOD were of a reddish color, unlike extracts from control cells. The electronic absorption spectrum of a periplasmic extract containing this enzyme in comparison with periplasmic extracts from control cells is shown in Fig. 1. It shows a pattern typical of hemoproteins with a main band in the Soret region around 410 nm and weaker bands close to 530 and 555 nm, indicative of the presence of relatively large amounts of heme. Initial expression experiments were carried out with E. coli cells bearing plasmid pIT4. As this plasmid contains a rather large H. ducreyi chromosomal insert containing genes other than sodC, we performed other expression experiments using the plasmid pPHduSOD (35Battistoni A. Pacello F. Mazzetti A.P. Capo C. Kroll S.J. Langford P.R. Donnarumma G. Valenti P. Rotilio G. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 275: 30315-30325Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Periplasmic extracts from cells bearing plasmid pPHduSOD or pIT4 contained comparable amounts of heme (data not shown). On the contrary, the periplasmic extracts from cells bearing the control plasmids pEMBL18 or overexpressing the Cu,Zn-SODs from E. coli,Photobacterium leiognathi, Haemophilus influenzae, Haemophilus parainfluenzae, Xenopus laevis B, andHomo sapiens (some of which are reported in Fig. 1) contained only barely detectable amounts of heme, thus indicating that heme accumulation in the periplasmic space is specifically related to the expression of H. ducreyi Cu,Zn-SOD. This phenomenon is independent of the E. coli strain used to express theH. ducreyi enzyme, as nearly identical spectra were recorded in extracts from the E. coli strains 71/18, GC4468, and MC1061 (data not shown). The histidine-rich N-terminal region of H. ducreyi Cu,Zn-SOD (25Kroll J.S. Langford P.R. Loynds B.M. J. Bacteriol. 1992; 173: 7449-7457Crossref Google Scholar) is not involved in the accumulation of heme, as the periplasmic fraction from cells expressing a mutant devoid of the first 22 amino acid residues (henceforth referred to as N-terminal deleted Cu,Zn-SOD) showed an absorption spectrum identical to that of the wild type enzyme (Fig. 1). Fig. 2 shows the absorption spectra of a sample of H. ducreyi Cu,Zn-SOD purified by affinity chromatography on a Ni-NTA column (spectrum 3) (35Battistoni A. Pacello F. Mazzetti A.P. Capo C.

Chem. 2001; 275: 30315-30325Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (52) Google Scholar), the periplasmic extract (spectrum 1), and the flow-through eluate (spectrum 2). Nearly all the heme present in the periplasmic fraction is associated with the purified enzyme, which, on the basis of SDS-PAGE analysis, appears to be more than 95% pure (inset, Fig. 2). These findings suggested that heme could be bound to Cu,Zn-SOD. However, purified enzyme samples showed very high Cu,Zn-SOD/heme molar ratios (between 80:1 and 5:1, depending on the enzyme preparatio"
https://openalex.org/W2052024751,"In contrast to the hereditary form of medullary thyroid carcinoma (MTC), little is known about the etiology of sporadic MTC. Somatic gain-of-function mutations in the RET proto-oncogene, encoding a receptor tyrosine kinase, are found in an average of 40% of sporadic MTC. We analysed 31 sporadic MTC for somatic and germline variants in GFRA1, GFRA2 and GFRA3 which encode the co-receptors of RET. Although there were no somatic mutations in any of the three genes, a sequence variant (−193C>G) in the 5′-UTR of GFRA1 was found in 15% of cases. Three patients were heterozygous (het); another three patients homozygous (hom) for the G variant. The G allele was not observed in 31 race-matched normal controls. Hence, the relative frequency of this variant in sporadic MTC cases and controls differed significantly (P<0.05). Since this variant lies in the 5′ UTR, likely at the transcriptional start site, we analysed for differential expression of GFRα-1 at the transcript and protein levels. At the mRNA level, GFRA1 was over-expressed in tumors harboring the rare variant (P=0.06). The presence of the G polymorphic allele seemed to be associated with increased expression by immunostaining for GFRα-1. Interestingly, cytoplasmic staining was stronger in intensity for het patients and nuclear staining predominant in hom cases. In conclusion, mutation analysis of GFRA1, GFRA2 and GFRA3 revealed over-representation of a rare variant in GFRA1 (−193C>G) in the germline of sporadic MTC cases. Our data suggest that the mechanism is related to over-expression of GFRα-1 and differential subcellular compartmentalization but the precise mechanism as to how it acts as a low penetrance susceptibility allele for the development of sporadic MTC remains to be elucidated."
https://openalex.org/W1965085769,"Loss of heterozygosity (LOH) analysis, performed in 68 gamma-radiation-induced primary thymic lymphomas of F1 hybrid mice, provided evidence of significant LOH on chromosome 19 in a region defined by the D19Mit106 (22 cM) and D19Mit100 (27 cM) markers (Thymic Lymphoma Suppressor Region 8, TLSR8). Cd95 and Pten, two genes mapped at this region, were inactivated in a vast majority of these tumors (85.3% for Cd95 and 61.8% for Pten). Moreover, altered expression of Cd95 and Pten occurred concomitantly in 34 of 68 (50%) thymic lymphomas suggesting a coordinated mechanism of inactivation of these genes. Surprisingly, we also found that Jak2, a proto-oncogene located between Cd95 and Pten, was simultaneously inactivated in a significant fraction of the tumors analysed (24 of 34, 70.6%). Taken together these findings and the lack of mutations in the coding sequences of the mentioned genes clearly suggest a possible regional epigenetic inactivation mechanism on mouse chromosome 19 operating during the development of these tumors."
https://openalex.org/W2329842087,"Activation of the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) cascade is a well documented mechanism for the G-protein-coupled receptors. Here, we have analysed the requirements for ERKs and p38 MAPK activation by thrombin in Jurkat T cells. We show that thrombin-mediated ERKs activation requires both PTK and PKC activities, whereas p38 MAPK activation is dependent only on PTKs. Thrombin-induced ERK and p38 MAPK activation was more pronounced in p56Lck deficient cells indicating that this PTK exerts a negative control on MAPK activity. Accordingly, overexpression of p50 Csk a kinase that inactivates p56Lck induced constitutive activation of ERKs. Requirement for a Src kinase was evidenced by expression of a constitutively active form of p59Fyn in Jurkat cells. Besides its effect on tyrosine phosphorylation events, thrombin also triggered a rapid and robust redistribution of PKCε and δ from the cytosol to the membrane. Expression of constitutively active and dominant negative PKCε demonstrates the pivotal role of this PKC isoform in ERKs activation by thrombin. These data are consistent with a model where thrombin induces ERK activation via both PKC-dependent and independent pathways, whereas p38 MAPK activation requires only PTKs. The PKC-independent pathway requires Src kinases other than p56Lck more likely p59Fyn, while the PKC-dependent mechanism depends on PKCε"
https://openalex.org/W2333275843,"We have previously demonstrated that amplification and overexpression of the Ki-ras gene is associated with mammary tumor progression in C3(1)/SV40Tag transgenic mice (Liu et al., 1998). To further evaluate the functional significance of the Ki-ras proto-oncogene in mammary cancer development, in vivo studies were conducted to examine the effect of Ki-ras gene dosage on tumor progression. The lack of one normal Ki-ras allele C3(1)/SV40Tag transgenic mice resulted in significantly delayed mammary intraepithelial neoplasia (MIN) formation as well as in a decreased number of mammary gland carcinomas. However, despite the retardation of tumor development by reduced Ki-ras gene dosage, overall survival was only modestly affected. This appears to be due to several factors including significant mammary tumor growth associated with Ki-ras gene amplification and over-expression that occurs during the advanced stage of oncogenesis in mice carrying either one or two normal Ki-ras alleles. The retardation of tumor progression due to the haploid loss of Ki-ras did not appear to be related to accelerated apoptosis, or a reduced rate of cell proliferation at the tumor stages examined. These data strongly suggest that the gene dosage of Ki-ras affects tumor promotion at an early stage of mammary tumor progression in this SV40 Tag-induced model of mammary oncogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W2334199313,"Primitive neuroectodermal tumors (PNETs) such as human medulloblastomas are genetically heterogeneous and therefore poorly understood. In a rat model the SV40 large T antigen was used to induce neoplasms with characteristic features of PNETs. Tumor development requires a latency period of 8–11 months implicating secondary genetic alterations. To identify such secondary alterations we performed comparative analyses of two phenotypically identical PNET-derived cell lines. Indeed, these cell lines displayed distinct high-level amplification sites. Using a combination of subtractive cDNA analysis and radiation hybrid mapping we have now identified genes in the amplicon regions of the two cell lines. Interestingly, one of these genes encodes the rat homolog of a cytosolic branched chain aminotransferase (BCATC) previously shown to be amplified in a mouse teratocarcinoma cell line. We propose that this simple cloning strategy may serve as a powerful tool for the isolation of genes implicated in known chromosomal aberrations in primary tumors and tumor cell lines."
https://openalex.org/W2329295531,"We have investigated the productive interaction between the four mammalian Ras proteins (H-, N-, KA- and KB-Ras) and their activators, the mammalian exchange factors mSos1, GRF1 and GRP, by using a modified Saccharomyces cerevisiae whose growth is dependent on activation of a mammalian Ras protein by its activator. All four mammalian Ras proteins were activated with similar efficiencies by the individual exchange factors. The H-Ras mutant V103E, which is competent for membrane localization, nucleotide binding, intrinsic and stimulated GTPase activity as well as intrinsic exchange, was defective for activation by all factors tested, suggesting that the integrity of this residue is necessary for catalyzed exchange. However, when other H-Ras mutants were studied, some distinct sensitivities to the exchange factors were observed. GRP-mediated, but not mSos1-mediated, exchange was blocked in additional mutants, suggesting different structural requirements for GRP. Analysis of Ras-mediated gene activation in murine fibroblasts confirmed these results."

https://openalex.org/W2064464180,"Evidence from genetic linkage analysis indicates that a gene located at 19q13.4, FWT2, is responsible for predisposition to Wilms tumor in many Wilms tumor families. This region has also been implicated in the etiology of sporadic Wilms tumor through loss of heterozygosity analyses. The PPP2R1A gene, encoding the alpha isoform of the heterotrimeric serine/threonine protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A), is located within the FWT2 candidate region and is altered in breast and lung carcinomas. PPP2R1B, encoding the beta isoform, is mutated in lung, colon, and breast cancers. These findings suggested that both PPP2R1A and PPP2R1B may be tumor suppressor genes. Additionally, PP2A is important in fetal kidney growth and differentiation and has an expression pattern similar to that of the Wilms tumor suppressor gene WT1. Since PPP2R1A was therefore a compelling candidate for the FWT2 gene, we analysed the coding region of PPP2R1A in DNA and RNA samples from affected members of four Wilms tumor families and 30 sporadic tumors and identified no mutations in PPP2R1A in any of these 34 samples. We conclude that PPP2R1A is not the 19q familial Wilms tumor gene and that mutation of PPP2R1A is not a common event in the etiology of sporadic Wilms tumor."
