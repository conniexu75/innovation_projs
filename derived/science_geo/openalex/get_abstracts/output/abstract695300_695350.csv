https://openalex.org/W4282975798,"The wettability of a polymer surface plays a critical role in cell-cell interaction and behavior. The degree to which a surface is hydrophobic or hydrophilic affects the adhesion and behavior of cells. Two distinct techniques for patterning the surface wettability of a Cyclic Olefin Copolymer (COC) substrate were developed and investigated in this article for the purpose of patterning cell growth. These include oxygen plasma treatment and graphene oxide (GO) coating to alter the wettability of the COC substrate and create hydrophilic patterned regions on a hydrophobic surface. When the two techniques are compared, patterning the surface of COC using GO film results in a more stable wettability over time and increases the roughness of the patterned area. Interestingly, both developed techniques were effective at patterning the COC surface's wettability, which modulated cell adhesion and resulted in micropatterning of cell growth. The novel methods described herein can be used in the fields of cell and tissue culture as well as in the development of new biological assays."
https://openalex.org/W4282972085,"The study of artifacts is fundamental to archaeological research. The features of individual artifacts are recorded, analyzed, and compared within and between contextual assemblages. Here we present and make available for academic-use Artifact3-D, a new software package comprised of a suite of analysis and documentation procedures for archaeological artifacts. We introduce it here, alongside real archaeological case studies to demonstrate its utility. Artifact3-D equips its users with a range of computational functions for accurate measurements, including orthogonal distances, surface area, volume, CoM, edge angles, asymmetry, and scar attributes. Metrics and figures for each of these measurements are easily exported for the purposes of further analysis and illustration. We test these functions on a range of real archaeological case studies pertaining to tool functionality, technological organization, manufacturing traditions, knapping techniques, and knapper skill. Here we focus on lithic artifacts, but the Artifact3-D software can be used on any artifact type to address the needs of modern archaeology. Computational methods are increasingly becoming entwined in the excavation, documentation, analysis, database creation, and publication of archaeological research. Artifact3-D offers functions to address every stage of this workflow. It equips the user with the requisite toolkit for archaeological research that is accurate, objective, repeatable and efficient. This program will help archaeological research deal with the abundant material found during excavations and will open new horizons in research trajectories."
https://openalex.org/W4282978130,"Suicide attempts by self-poisoning have become a critical health problem. This study aimed to investigate the trend, incidence, and the associated risk factors of suicide attempts by self-poisoning. A total of 7398 Egyptian patients were analyzed. The trend of suicide attempts by self-poisoning was analyzed using 6745 patients over four registry years from January 1, 2016, to January 1, 2020. Then, the associated risk factors behind attempted suicide by self-poisoning from January 1, 2019, to January 1, 2020, were assessed using 2523 suicide attempters by self-poisoning, 201 fatalities by self-poisoning, and another 653 survivors of accidental poisoning. Results showed a rising trend of suicide attempts by self-poisoning over the studied years. The incidence of suicide attempts through deliberate self-poisoning represented 26.63/1,000 (CI95%: 25.63-27.86) to the admitted patients and 26.10/100,000 (CI95%: 25.10-27.14) to the regional population. The death rate due to suicide attempts by self-poisoning was 2.08/100,000 (1.90-2.49). The case fatality rate and the proportionate mortality rate for suicide by self-poisoning were 7.38% (CI95%: 6.45-8.42) and 14.11% (CI95%: 12.4-16.0) respectively. Multivariate analysis revealed that attempted suicide by self-poisoning was predicted among patients aged <25 or 25-40 years old (OR = 27.49, CI95%: 15.28-49.64 and OR = 59.42, CI95%: 32.76-107.77 respectively), those of low or moderate socioeconomic status (OR = 35.03, CI95%: 21.32-57.56 and OR = 14.11, CI95%: 10.86-18.43 respectively), students (OR = 2.91, CI95%: 1.57-5.43) and those living in rural residency (OR = 4.12, CI95%: 3.27-5.19). Suicide attempts by self-poisoning exhibited an incremental rise across time which raises a serious concern. Efforts should be directed to overcome the mentioned risk factors triggering suicide attempts by self-poisoning."

To the best of researchers' knowledge, there is no Study on ARDS of COVID-19 in Ethiopia. Therefore, this study aimed to identify the prevalence of ARDS and associated factors among severe COVID-19 patients at Wollega University Referral Hospital.An institution-based retrospective cross-sectional study was conducted from September 20, 2020, to June 10, 2021. Real-Time Reverse transcription-polymerase Chain Reaction (rRT-PCR) test was used to test Patients for COVID-19. Epi-data version 3.2 was used for data entry, and the final data analysis was through STATA version 14. After checking the assumption P-value<0.25 in the bivariable analysis was used to select a candidate variable for multi-variable analysis, and a p-value of <0.05 was used to declare statistical significance.In this study, the prevalence of ARDS was 32%. Almost all the patients had the clinical feature of cough (93.7%), followed by shortness of breath (79.9%), fever (77.7%), and headache (67%). Age older than 65 years (AOR = 3.35, 95%CI = 1.31, 8.55), male gender (AOR = 5.63, 95%CI = 2.15, 14.77), and low oxygen saturation level (AOR = 4.60, 95%CI = 1.15, 18.35) were the independent predictors of ARDS among severe COVID-19 patients.The prevalence of ARDS among patients with severe COVID-19 was high in the study area. Therefore, elders and patients with critical conditions (low oxygen saturation) better to get special attention during COVID-19 case management to enhance good care and monitoring of the patients."
https://openalex.org/W4282974970,"Background Colorectal cancer (CRC) needs several mutations to occur in various genes, and can vary widely in different individuals; hence it is essential to be discovered in a specific population. Until recently, there has been no known study describing APC , TP53 , PIK3CA , KRAS , and MLH1 of CRC in Indonesian population. This study describes the nature and location of mutation in CRC patients treated at three different hospitals in Jakarta. Methods This descriptive study was conducted on CRC patients who underwent neoadjuvant, surgical, and adjuvant therapy at RSCM, RSKJ, and MRCCC in 2017–2018. DNA analysis was performed using next-generation sequencing and aligned against GRCh38. The pathogenic variant was identified using ACMG classification and FATHMM score. Data related to behavior and survival were collected from medical records. Results Twenty-two subjects in which APC , TP53 , and PIKCA were mutated. KRAS mutation occurred in 64%, while MLH1 in 45%. There were five mutation types: nonsense, missense, frameshift, splice-site, and silent mutation. There are four groups of co-occurring mutations: APC , TP53 , PIK3CA (triple mutation/TM) alone; TM+ KRAS ; TM+ MLH1 ; and TM+ KRAS + MLH1 , presenting different nature and survival. Conclusion Indonesia has a distinct profile of pathogenic mutation, mainly presenting with locally-advanced stage with various outcomes and survival rate."
https://openalex.org/W4282980578,"The trade agreement is generally considered an effective mechanism to encourage trading activities. However, trade activities may lead to environmental degradation because more trade is generally associated with more energy consumption. In addition, financial development with an increased flow of capital among members is required to fund trading activities. Renewable energy can be a moderating factor to balance the effects of trade activities and financial development on the economy and the environment. This paper focuses on the inter-relationship between growth-energy-finance nexus for the CPTPP members in the 1971-2020 period. While the energy-growth-environment nexus has been extensively investigated, the energy-growth-finance relationship has been largely ignored in existing literature, particularly for the CPTPP countries. Our findings can be summarized as follows. First, we find that renewable energy consumption does reduce CO2 emission while financial development does not necessarily increase environmental degradation. Second, financial development is found to cause renewable energy usage bilaterally. Finally, when different proxies are used for financial development, a bilateral causality relationship between renewable energy usage, financial development and economic growth is confirmed. These important findings imply that the governments of the CPTPP countries should encourage renewable energy usage to achieve the dual objectives from the CPTPP trade agreement: (i) to increase trade activities; and (ii) to support further financial development within the region. These two objectives together support economic growth."
https://openalex.org/W4283012437,"Central Iran supports a diversity of carnivores, most of which are threatened by habitat loss and fragmentation. Carnivore conservation requires the identification and preservation of core habitats and ensuring connectivity between them. In the present study, we used species distribution modeling to predict habitat suitability and connectivity modeling to predict linkage (resistant kernel and factorial least-cost path analyses) for grey wolf and golden jackal in central Iran. For grey wolf, elevation, topographic ruggedness, and distance to Conservation Areas (CAs) were the strongest predictors; for golden jackal, distance to human settlements, dump sites and topographic ruggedness were the most influential variables in predicting the occurrence of this species. Our results also indicated a high potential for large parts of the landscape to support the occurrence of these two canid species. The largest and the most crucial core habitats and corridor paths for the conservation of both species are located in the southern part of the study landscape. We found a small overlap between golden jackal corridor paths and core habitats with CAs, which has important implications for conservation and future viability of the golden jackal populations. Some sections of core areas are bisected by roads, where most vehicle collisions with grey wolf and golden jackal occurred. To minimize mortality risk, we propose that successful conservation of both species will necessitate integrated landscape-level management, as well as conservation of core areas and corridors and development of mitigation strategies to reduce vehicle collisions."
https://openalex.org/W4283016016,"Sleep staging is the basis of sleep evaluation and a key step in the diagnosis of sleep-related diseases. Despite being useful, the existing sleep staging methods have several disadvantages, such as relying on artificial feature extraction, failing to recognize temporal sequence patterns in the long-term associated data, and reaching the accuracy upper limit of sleep staging. Hence, this paper proposes an automatic Electroencephalogram (EEG) sleep signal staging model, which based on Multi-scale Attention Residual Nets (MAResnet) and Bidirectional Gated Recurrent Unit (BiGRU). The proposed model is based on the residual neural network in deep learning. Compared with the traditional residual learning module, the proposed model additionally uses the improved channel and spatial feature attention units and convolution kernels of different sizes in parallel at the same position. Thus, multiscale feature extraction of the EEG sleep signals and residual learning of the neural networks is performed to avoid network degradation. Finally, BiGRU is used to determine the dependence between the sleep stages and to realize the automatic learning of sleep data staging features and sleep cycle extraction. According to the experiment, the classification accuracy and kappa coefficient of the proposed method on sleep-EDF data set are 84.24% and 0.78, which are respectively 0.24% and 0.21 higher than the traditional residual net. At the same time, this paper also verified the proposed method on UCD and SHHS data sets, and the figure of classification accuracy is 79.34% and 81.6%, respectively. Compared to related existing studies, the recognition accuracy is significantly improved, which validates the effectiveness and generalization performance of the proposed method."
https://openalex.org/W4283023407,"Background The emergence of the corona virus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has increased the workload of health workers particularly those in sub-Saharan Africa predisposing them to extra job-related stress and its associated job-related burnout. Burnout reduces the number, distribution and productivity of health workers. This study sought to determine personal and job-related characteristics of health workers in Accra, Ghana that influenced their experience of burnout during the COVID-19 pandemic. Method A cross-sectional study was conducted among 1,264 health workers recruited from three public hospitals in Accra, Ghana between March to November, 2020. The participants were recruited using a proportionate stratified sampling technique and completed a pre-tested questionnaire that collected information on socio-demographic and job-related factors. Also, the questionnaire assessed participants’ level of resilience and job-related burnout. Pearson’s chi-square test was used to determine the association between burnout and the socio-demographic as well as job-related factors. However, for variables with observations less than six, a Fisher’s exact test, was used to determine the associations. After the binary analysis, multivariate logistic regressions were used to determine the strength of association between the socio-demographic as well as job-related factors and burnout. Data analyses were conducted at a significant level (alpha 0.05) and power of 95% confidence with the aid of Stata 15.0. Results The prevalence of burnout among the participants was 20.57% with non-clinicians displaying higher burnout compared to clinicians (26.74&amp;% v 15.64%, p&lt; 0.001). Health workers with 1–5 years working experience were 26.81 more likely to experience burnout (AOR = 26.81, CI = 6.37–112.9). Night shifts defined as shifts between 8:00pm to 8:00am was associated with the 1.86 odds of experiencing burnout (OR = 1.86; 95% CI: 1.33–2.61; p&lt;0.001). Also, participants of the primary level facility were 3.91 times more likely (AOR = 3.91, 95% CI = 2.39–6.41) to experience burnout on the job. Similarly, participants with additional jobs were 1.14 times more likely (AOR = 1.14, 95% CI = 0.75–1.74) to experience burnout. In addition, participants harboring intentions of leaving their current jobs were 4.61 times more likely (AOR = 4.61, 95% CI = 2.73–7.78) to experience burnout. Furthermore, participants with perceived high workload were 2.38 times more likely (AOR = 2.38, 95% CI = 1.40–4.05) to experience burnt-out on the job. Conclusion There is high prevalence of burnout among health workers in Accra particularly during the onslaught of the COVID-19 pandemic. Working on night shifts and at the primary level of healthcare is significantly associated with increased odds of experiencing burnout.We recommend shift rotation for staff and adequate resource provision for primary level hospitals. The high burnout in this study could be influenced by other factors such as the grief caused by multiple losses and also the limited supportive resources for health workers."
https://openalex.org/W4283028952,"Black transgender women endure pervasive polyvictimization (experiencing multiple forms of violence throughout the lifespan). Polyvictimization is associated with poor mental health. Black transgender women also face barriers in access to healthcare, but the extent that such barriers modify the association between polyvictimization and poor mental health has not been described using convergent mixed-methods analysis.This convergent mixed-methods secondary analysis employs an intersectional lens and integrates two inter-related datasets to describe barriers to healthcare and the extent that such barriers modify the association between polyvictimization and mental health among Black transgender women. Investigators used survey data (n = 151 participants) and qualitative interview data (n = 19 participants) collected from Black transgender women (age 18 years and older) in Baltimore, MD and Washington, DC between 2016 and 2018. Analyses include thematic content analysis, bivariate analysis, joint display, and multivariate linear regression analysis examining mediation and moderation.Joint display illuminated three domains to describe how barriers to healthcare present among Black transgender women-Affordability, Accessibility, and Rapport and Continuity. Independent t-tests revealed significantly higher polyvictimization, Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD), and depression scores among participants who reported at least one barrier to healthcare (BHI) compared to those who reported no barriers. BHI significantly moderated and partially mediated the association between polyvictimization and PTSD symptom severity and BHI fully mediated the association between polyvictimization and depressive symptom severity-when accounting for age and location.Findings highlight the importance of access to healthcare in modifying the association between polyvictimization and PTSD and depression symptom severity among Black transgender women. Findings call for immediate interventions aimed at reducing barriers to healthcare and improved training for clinical providers serving Black transgender women."
https://openalex.org/W4282980385,"Sleep disorders related to Parkinson's disease (PD) have recently attracted increasing attention, but there are few clinical reports on the correlation of Parkinson's disease patients with rapid eye movement (REM) sleep behavior disorder (RBD). Therefore, this study conducted a cognitive function examination for Parkinson's disease patients and discussed the application effect of three algorithms in the screening of influencing factors and risk prediction effects.Three algorithms (logistic regression, machine learning-based regression trees and random forest) were used to establish a prediction model for PD-RBD patients, and the application effects of the three algorithms in the screening of influencing factors and the risk prediction of PD-RBD were discussed.The subjects included 169 patients with Parkinson's disease (Parkinson's disease with RBD [PD-RBD] = 69 subjects; Parkinson's disease without RBD [PD-nRBD] = 100 subjects). This study compared the predictive performance of RF, decision tree and logistic regression, selected a final model with the best model performance and proposed the importance of variables in the final model. After the analysis, the accuracy of RF (83.05%) was better than that of the other models (decision tree = 75.10%, logistic regression = 71.62%). PQSI, Scopa-AUT score, MoCA score, MMSE score, AGE, LEDD, PD-course, UPDRS total score, ESS score, NMSQ, disease type, RLSRS, HAMD, UPDRS III and PDOnsetage are the main variables for predicting RBD, along with increased weight. Among them, PQSI is the most important factor. The prediction model of Parkinson's disease RBD that was established in this study will help in screening out predictive factors and in providing a reference for the prognosis and preventive treatment of PD-RBD patients.The random forest model had good performance in the prediction and evaluation of PD-RBD influencing factors and was superior to decision tree and traditional logistic regression models in many aspects, which can provide a reference for the prognosis and preventive treatment of PD-RBD patients."
https://openalex.org/W4283023581,"Remote surgery social implementation necessitates achieving low latency and highly reliable video/operation signal transmission over economical commercial networks. However, with commercial lines, communication bandwidth often fluctuates with network congestion and interference from narrowband lines acting as bottlenecks. Therefore, verifying the effects on surgical performance and surgeon fatigue when communication lines dip below required bandwidths are important.To clarify the communication bandwidth environment effects on image transmission and operability when bandwidth is lower than surgical robot requirements, and to determine surgeon fatigue levels in suboptimal environments.Employing a newly developed surgical robot, a commercial IP-VPN line connected two hospitals 150 km apart. Thirteen surgical residents remotely performed a defined suturing procedure at 1-Gbps to 3-Mbps bandwidths. Communication delay, packet loss, time-to-task completion, forceps-movement distance, video degradation, and robot operability were evaluated before and after bandwidth changes. The Piper Fatigue Score-12 (PFS-12) was used to measure fatigue associated with surgeon performance.Roundtrip communication time for both 1-Gbps and 3-Mbps lines averaged 4 ms. Video transmission delay from camera to monitor was comparable, at 92 ms. Surgical robot signal transmission rate averaged 5.2 Mbps, so changing to 1-Gbps-3-Mbps lines resulted in significant packet loss. Surgeons perceived significant roughness, image distortion, diplopia, and degradation of 3D images (p = 0.009), but not changes in delay time or maneuverability. All surgeons could complete tasks, but objective measurement of task-completion time and forceps-travel distance were significantly prolonged (p = 0.013, p = 0,041). Additionally, PFS-12 showed post-procedure fatigue increase at both 1-Gbps and 3-Mbps. Fatigue increase was significant at 3-Mbps (p = 0.041).In remote surgery environments with less than the optimal bandwidth, even when delay time and operability are equivalent, reduced surgical performance occurs from video degradation from packet loss. This may cause increased surgeon fatigue."
https://openalex.org/W4283030354,"Background Disorders of mental health are known to affect cognitive functions, hence called as cognitive disorders. Impaired glucose metabolism, insulin resistance, vitamin-D deficiency and oxidative stress are some of the key early events reported to be involved in the pathogenesis of most common cognitive disorders, which include Alzheimer’s disease. Type-2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is one of the known contributing factors of cognitive impairment and dementia. Methods A cross sectional study was carried out in 145 subjects, who were assessed for cognitive function by modified mini mental status examination (3MS). In addition, measurement of fasting blood sugar (FBS), fasting insulin, HbA1c, lipid profile, vitamin D and oxidative markers was performed. Participants were divided into different groups based on (a) vitamin D insufficiency and sufficiency; (b) diabetic and non-diabetic with and without cognitive impairment. Results The study included a total of 145 subjects; 51 males and 94 females and the mean age was 68.24±9.70 years. Among diabetics with vitamin D insufficiency, 35 subjects (71.43%) had cognitive impairment, but, among non-diabetics with vitamin D insufficiency, 27 subjects (62.79%) had cognitive impairment. Chi square test showed no significant association between diabetes, vitamin D insufficiency and cognitive impairment. Glutathione peroxidase (GPx) and superoxide dismutase (SOD) levels were non-significantly lower in cognition-impaired subjects, when compared to cognition normal subjects in diabetics with vitamin D insufficiency. Conclusion Our study showed that cognitive impairment is more predominant in individuals with diabetes. However, our study did not find any significant relationship between T2DM, vitamin D deficiency, cognitive impairment, and oxidative stress. A significant association was found only with GPx and 3MSE score in vitamin D insufficient non-diabetics."
https://openalex.org/W4282962191,"Vγ9Vδ2 T cells are immune effector cells capable of killing multiple myeloma (MM) cells and have been tested in clinical trials to treat MM patients. To enhance the MM cell killing function of Vγ9Vδ2 T cells, we introduced a BCMA-specific CAR into ex vivo expanded Vγ9Vδ2 T cells through electroporation of the CAR-encoding mRNA. The modified Vγ9Vδ2 T cells displayed a high cytolytic activity against BCMA-expressing MM cell lines in vitro, while sparing BCMA-negative cells, including normal B cells and monocytes. Subsequently, we intravenously injected KMS-11 human MM cells to generate a xenograft mouse model. The treatment of the tumor-bearing mice with Zometa and anti-BCMA CAR- Vγ9Vδ2 T cells resulted in a significant reduction of tumor burden in the femur region, as well as the overall tumor burden. In association with the decrease in tumor burden, the survival of the MM cell-inoculated mice was markedly prolonged. Considering the potential of Vγ9Vδ2 T cells to be used as off-the-shelf products, the modification of these cells with a BCMA-specific CAR could be an attractive option for cancer immunotherapy against bone marrow cancer MM."
https://openalex.org/W4282972391,"The need for environmental protection and involvement of ecological aspects in the business operations is forcing the organizations to re-examine their action plans and rebuild their supply chain activities. Many organizations are incorporating environmental rules and regulations in their everyday matters by focusing on green supplier selection. The proposed research paper develops a multi-objective interactive fuzzy programming model for the selection of suppliers. This model works on a business quartet of green appraisal score, cost, quality, and time. The model uses an environmental scale for different green parameters and all the suppliers are scored based on this scale. In this research model, Quality Function Deployment (QFD) methodology is integrated with the multi-objective interactive fuzzy programming. QFD technique is utilized to compute the weights of several green factors used for the selection of suppliers. The model uses a Fuzzy linguistic scale and a triangular membership function to link expert opinions along with their experience to solve the problem. Finally, the model is validated on a numerical case study of the textile industry for green supplier selection which achieves a 100% satisfaction for cost and time, 75% satisfaction for green appraisal score, and 93.95% for the quality. The proposed model assists the decision-makers in selecting green suppliers to improve the overall sustainability of their organizations."
https://openalex.org/W4282983032,"Hordenine, a bioactive food compound, has several pharmacological properties and has recently been identified as a dopamine D2 receptor (D2R) agonist. Since the pharmacokinetic profile of hordenine has been described to a limited extent, the present study focused on the transfer and transport of hordenine across the intestinal epithelium and the blood-brain barrier (BBB) in vitro. Hordenine was quickly transferred through the Caco-2 monolayer in only a few hours, indicating a rapid oral uptake. However, the high bioavailability may be reduced by the observed efflux transport of hordenine from the bloodstream back into the intestinal lumen and by first pass metabolism in intestinal epithelial cells. To determine the biotransformation rate of hordenine, the metabolite hordenine sulfate was synthesized as reference standard for analytical purposes. In addition, transfer studies using primary porcine brain capillary endothelial cells (PBCEC) showed that hordenine is able to rapidly penetrate the BBB and potentially accumulate in the brain. Thus, a D2R interaction of hordenine and activation of dopaminergic signaling is conceivable, assuming that the intestinal barrier can be circumvented by a route of administration alternative to oral uptake."

The aim is to present an adaptation and transcultural validation -in Spanish- of the Moral Sensitivity Questionnaire by Lützén et al. in Spain. In addition to that, we provide a practical implementation analysing the degree of moral sensitivity of nursing students. The data used for data collection were moral Sensitivity Questionnaire, socio-demographic data and a self-report questionnaire. The psychometric properties of the questionnaire were assessed, including validity and reliability. Fit indices of the overall model were computed. The fit indices of the Confirmatory Factor Analysis (CFA) indicate a poor fit, although the Exploratory Factor Analysis (EFA) revealed two dimensions that show a better fit of its indices. Women and those women with more experience in the clinical setting have a higher mean score, as well as those who study in centers where the strategic lines are the humanization of care. Female nursing students with more experience in the clinical setting and with more educational training present higher sensitivity indexes, as well as those who study in centers where the strategic lines are the humanization of care. The findings confirm that the Lützén et al. questionnaire is multidimensional. In the Spanish sample, it was necessary to group the three initial factors into two: sense of moral burden and moral strength-grouping the moral responsibility items into the above items to make the instrument more resilient."
https://openalex.org/W4283021632,"Recently reported specimens of the enigmatic Ediacaran fossil Dickinsonia from Russia show damage and repair that provides evidence of how they grew, and of their biological affinities. Marginal and terminal areas of wilting deformation are necrotic zones separating regenerated growth, sometimes on two divergent axes, rather than a single axis. Necrotic zones of damage to Dickinsonia are not a thick scar or callus, like a wound or amputation. Nor are they smooth transitions to a regenerated tail or arm. The wilted necrotic zone is most like damage by freezing, salt, or sunburn of leaves and lichens, compatible with evidence of terrestrial habitat from associated frigid and gypsic paleosols. Dickinsonia did not regrow by postembryonic addition of modules from a subterminal or patterned growth zone as in earthworms, myriapods, trilobites, crustaceans, and lizards. Rather Dickinsonia postembryonic regrowth from sublethal damage was from microscopic apical and lateral meristems, as in plants and lichens. Considered as fungal, Dickinsonia , and perhaps others of Class Vendobionta, were more likely Glomeromycota or Mucoromycotina, rather than Ascomycota or Basidiomycota."

There are a number of studies on support agencies, but studies on entrepreneurial performance from the perspective of a relationship marketing orientation (RMO) between support agencies and entrepreneurs are lacking. This study aimed to investigate the hypothesized relationships between the RMO of an entrepreneur support agency and the financial and nonfinancial performances of small- and medium-size entrepreneurs (SMEs). A total of 276 valid SMEs survey responses based on purposive sampling were collected and analyzed using partial least squares structural equation modeling (PLS-SEM). Findings indicate that trust and reciprocity are the significant factors to financial performance of SMEs. Meanwhile, trust, communication, empathy, and reciprocity indicate a significant positive relationship with nonfinancial performance of SMEs. To the best of the authors’ knowledge, this is the first study to provide an interesting avenue to understand the relationship between an entrepreneur support agency and entrepreneurs to work on synergistic relationship approaches in order to remain sustainable in the market. This study has also drawn specific implications for SMEs and government agencies for entrepreneur and policy planning to coordinate appropriate entrepreneurship development programs and strengthen the entrepreneurship ecosystem."
https://openalex.org/W4282962885,"Phosphorus magnetic resonance spectroscopy (31P-MRS) has previously demonstrated decreased energy reserves in the form of phosphocreatine to adenosine-tri-phosphate ratio (PCr/ATP) in the hearts of patients with type 2 diabetes (T2DM). Recent 31P-MRS techniques using 7T systems, e.g. long mixing time stimulated echo acquisition mode (STEAM), allow deeper insight into cardiac metabolism through assessment of inorganic phosphate (Pi) content and myocardial pH, which play pivotal roles in energy production in the heart. Therefore, we aimed to further explore the cardiac metabolic phenotype in T2DM using STEAM at 7T. Seventeen patients with T2DM and twenty-three healthy controls were recruited and their cardiac PCr/ATP, Pi/PCr and pH were assessed at 7T. Diastolic function of all patients with T2DM was assessed using echocardiography to investigate the relationship between diastolic dysfunction and cardiac metabolism. Mirroring the decreased PCr/ATP (1.70±0.31 vs. 2.07±0.39; p<0.01), the cardiac Pi/PCr was increased (0.13±0.07 vs. 0.10±0.03; p = 0.02) in T2DM patients in comparison to healthy controls. Myocardial pH was not significantly different between the groups (7.14±0.12 vs. 7.10±0.12; p = 0.31). There was a negative correlation between PCr/ATP and diastolic function (R2 = 0.33; p = 0.02) in T2DM. No correlation was observed between diastolic function and Pi/PCr and (R2 = 0.16; p = 0.21). In addition, we did not observe any correlation between cardiac PCr/ATP and Pi/PCr (p = 0.19). Using STEAM 31P-MRS at 7T we have for the first time explored Pi/PCr in the diabetic human heart and found it increased when compared to healthy controls. The lack of correlation between measured PCr/ATP and Pi/PCr suggests that independent mechanisms might contribute to these perturbations."
https://openalex.org/W4282967109,"The Grain for Green project (GGP), initialized by the Chinese government in 1999, has achieved substantial achievements accompanied by a decrease in surface runoff on the Loess Plateau, but the impacts of large-scale afforestation on regional water resources are uncertain. Hence, the objective of this study was to explore the impact of land use change on generalized water resources and ecological water stress using the blue and green water concepts, taking the Yanhe River Basin as the case study. The Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) was applied to quantify the green water and blue water, which are defined as generalized water resources. The ecological water requirement of vegetation (forest and grass), agricultural water footprint and virtual water flow are considered regional water requirements. The land use types of 1980 (Scenario I) and 2017 (Scenario II) were entered into the SWAT model while keeping the other parameters constant to isolate the influence of land use changes. The results show that the average annual differences in blue, green and generalized water resources were -72.08 million m 3 , 24.34 million m 3 , and -47.74 million m 3 , respectively, when the simulation results of Scenario II were subtracted from those of Scenario I, which shows that land use change caused by the GGP led to a decrease in blue and generalized water resources and an increase in green water resources. Surface runoff in Scenario I was more than that in Scenario II in all of the years of the study period from 1980–2017, and green water storage in Scenario I was more than that in Scenario II in all of the years of the study period except in 1998; although lateral flow in Scenario I was less than that in Scenario II except in 2000 and 2015, as was groundwater runoff in 1992, 2000 and 2015, and green water flow in 1998. Blue water flow, green water storage and green water flow in Scenario II were less than those in Scenario I in the whole basin, 12.89 percent of the basin and 99.21 percent of the basin, respectively. The total water footprint increased from 1995 to 2010 because the forest water footprint increased significantly in this period, although the agricultural water footprint and grass water footprint decreased. The ecological water stress index values had no obvious temporal change trends in either land use scenario, but the ecological water stress index in Scenario II was greater than that in Scenario I, which illustrates that the GGP led to an increase in ecological water stress from the perspective of generalized water resources."
https://openalex.org/W4282969955,"AlphaFold2 and RoseTTAfold are able to predict, based solely on their sequence whether GFP-like proteins will post-translationally form a chromophore (the part of the protein responsible for fluorescence) or not. Their training has not only taught them protein structure and folding, but also chemistry. The structures of 21 sequences of GFP-like fluorescent proteins that will post-translationally form a chromophore and of 23 GFP-like non-fluorescent proteins that do not have the residues required to form a chromophore were determined by AlphaFold2 and RoseTTAfold. The resultant structures were mined for a series of geometric measurements that are crucial to chromophore formation. Statistical analysis of these measurements showed that both programs conclusively distinguished between chromophore forming and non-chromophore forming proteins. A clear distinction between sequences capable of forming a chromophore and those that do not have the residues required for chromophore formation can be obtained by examining a single measurement-the RMSD of the overlap of the central alpha helices of the crystal structure of S65T GFP and the AlphaFold2 determined structure. Only 10 of the 578 GFP-like proteins in the pdb have no chromophore, yet when AlphaFold2 and RoseTTAFold are presented with the sequences of 44 GFP-like proteins that are not in the pdb they fold the proteins in such a way that one can unequivocally distinguish between those that can and cannot form a chromophore."

This study aims to understand how family affects HIV risk and protective factors for young adults. PR MSM ages 21 through 30 in San Juan, PR completed semi-structured interviews exploring the influence interpersonal family relationships have on HIV risk and protective factors. PR MSM (N = 15) completed a semi-structured in-depth individual interview. NVivo was used for administering a thematic analysis based on the transcripts in the original language of the interview, 14 in Spanish and one in English. The following five general themes emerged from the data analysis: 1) Immediate versus Extended Family; 2) The Matriarch; 3) Fractured Paternal Relationships; 4) Siblings Influence; and 5) Fictive Kin-Creating My Own Family. Findings suggest that the immediate family play an integral role in enhancing HIV protective factors for PR MSM as young adults. This study highlights the importance for developing family-based interventions that reinforce cultural beliefs and values through a strengths-based approach towards enhancing HIV protective behaviors for PR MSM."
https://openalex.org/W4282974585,"Peripheral T cell CXCR3 expression has been found uniquely lower in patients having neovascular age-related macular degeneration (nAMD) than in healthy individuals. The CXCR3-axis has been shown to have angiostatic and antifibrotic properties. We have recently investigated systemic markers in patients with myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPNs) because of their higher prevalence of AMD, and we have observed higher systemic chronic low-grade inflammation and immunosenescence signs in MPNs with drusen (MPNd) compared to those with normal retinas (MPNn). The MPNs evolve in a biological continuum from early cancer-stages (essential thrombocytosis, polycythemia vera) to the advanced myelofibrosis stage. Especially myelofibrosis is characterized by bone marrow angiogenesis and fibrosis, similarly to retinal observations in nAMD. We speculate if we can find lower CXCR3 expression in MPNs, particularly myelofibrosis and if differences are seen between MPNd and MPNn. We also wanted to compare expression in nAMD and intermediate (i)AMD.Patients in this cross-sectional study were 29 nAMD, 28 iAMD, 35 MPNd, and 27 MPNn. We performed flowcytometry on blood to measure CXCR3 expression.CD8+CXCR3 expression in nAMD was 6,1%, significantly lower than in iAMD 16%, MPNd 11%, MPNn 12% (p-values<0.05). Similar results were seen for CD4+CXCR3 expression. We also found CXCR3 expression decreasing over the MPN-continuum. For instance, in myelofibrosis, intermediate monocytes expression was 6.2%, significantly lower than 18% in ET and 18% in PV (p-values<0.05).We find CXCR3 downregulation on T-cells and some monocyte subset in nAMD compared to iAMD, MPNd, and MPNn, in line with previous nAMD studies. We also find CXCR3 downregulation in most monocyte subsets over the MPN continuum. Systemic leukocyte CXCR3 expression could both be involved in changes seen in the retina and the bone marrow. Further understanding the CXCR3-axis in AMD and MPNs may elucidate underlying pathogenic mechanisms and reveal new targets for treatment."
https://openalex.org/W4282979749,"Use of face coverings has been shown to reduce transmission of SARS-CoV-2. Despite encouragements from the CDC and other public health entities, resistance to usage of masks remains, forcing government entities to create mandates to compel use. The state of Oklahoma did not create a state-wide mask mandate, but numerous municipalities within the state did. This study compares case rates in communities with mandates to those without mandates, at the same time and in the same state (thus keeping other mitigation approaches similar). Diagnosed cases of COVID-19 were extracted from the Oklahoma State Department of Health reportable disease database. Daily case rates were established based upon listed city of residence. The daily case rate difference between each locality with a mask mandate were compared to rates for the portions of the state without a mandate. All differences were then set to a d0 point of reference (date of mandate implementation). Piecewise linear regression analysis of the difference in SARS-CoV-2 infection rates between mandated and non-mandated populations before and after adoption of mask mandates was then done. Prior to adopting mask mandates, those municipalities that eventually adopted mandates had higher transmission rates than the rest of the state, with the mean case rate difference per 100,000 people increasing by 0.32 cases per day (slope of difference = 0.32; 95% CI 0.13 to 0.51). For the post-mandate time period, the differences are decreasing (slope of -0.24; 95% CI -0.32 to -0.15). The pre- and post- mandate slopes differed significantly (p&lt;0.001). The change in slope direction (-0.59; 95% CI -0.80 to -0.37) shows a move toward reconvergence in new case diagnoses between the two populations. Compared to rates in communities without mask mandates, transmission rates of SARS-CoV-2 slowed notably in those communities that adopted a mask mandate. This study suggests that government mandates may play a role in reducing transmission of SARS-CoV-2, and other infectious respiratory conditions."
https://openalex.org/W4283034777,"SONAR signal processing plays an indispensable role when it comes to parameter estimation of Direction of Arrival (DOA) of acoustic plane waves for closely spaced target exclusively under severe noisy environments. Resolution performance of classical MUSIC and ESPRIT algorithms and other subspace-based algorithms decreases under scenarios like low SNR, smaller number of snapshots and closely spaced targets. In this study, optimization strength of swarm intelligence of Cuckoo Search Algorithm (CSA) is accomplished for viable DOA estimation in different scenarios of underwater environment using a Uniform Linear Array (ULA). Higher resolution for closely spaced targets is achieved using smaller number of snapshots viably with CSA by investigating global minima of the highly nonlinear cost function of ULA. Performance analysis of CSA for different number of targets employing estimation accuracy, higher resolution, variance analysis, frequency distribution of RMSE over the monte Carlo runs and robustness against noise in the presence of additive-white Gaussian measurement noise is achieved. Comparative studies of CSA with Root MUSIC and ESPRIT along with Crammer Rao Bound analysis witnesses better results for estimating DOA parameters which are further endorsed from the results of Monte Carlo simulations."
https://openalex.org/W4282962892,"The sea urchin egg cortex is a peripheral region of eggs comprising a cell membrane and adjacent cytoplasm, which contains actin and tubulin cytoskeleton, cortical granules and some proteins required for early development. Method for isolation of cortices from sea urchin eggs and early embryos was developed in 1970s. Since then, this method has been reliable tool to study protein localization and cytoskeletal organization in cortex of unfertilized eggs and embryos during first cleavages. This study was aimed to estimate the reliability of RT-qPCR to analyze levels of maternal transcripts that are localized in egg cortex. Firstly, we selected seven potential reference genes, 28S, Cycb, Ebr1, GAPDH, Hmg1, Smtnl1 and Ubb, the transcripts of which are maternally deposited in sea urchin eggs. The candidate reference genes were ranked by five different algorithms (BestKeeper, CV, ΔCt, geNorm and NormFinder) based on calculated level of stability in both eggs as well as isolated cortices. Our results showed that gene ranking differs in total RNA and mRNA samples, though Ubb is most suitable reference gene in both cases. To validate feasibility of comparative analysis of eggs and isolated egg cortices, we selected Daglb-2 as a gene of interest, which transcripts are potentially localized in cortex according to transcriptome analysis, and observed increased level of Daglb-2 in egg cortices by RT-qPCR. This suggests that proposed RNA isolation method with subsequent quantitative RT-qPCR analysis can be used to determine cortical association of transcripts in sea urchin eggs."
https://openalex.org/W4282968513,"Crop yield prediction provides information to policymakers in the agricultural production system. This study used leaf reflectance from a spectroradiometer to model grain yield (GY) and aboveground biomass yield (ABY) of maize (Zea mays L.) at Aba Gerima catchment, Ethiopia. A FieldSpec IV (350-2,500 nm wavelengths) spectroradiometer was used to estimate the spectral reflectance of crop leaves during the grain-filling phase. The spectral vegetation indices, such as enhanced vegetation index (EVI), normalized difference VI (NDVI), green NDVI (GNDVI), soil adjusted VI, red NDVI, and simple ratio were deduced from the spectral reflectance. We used regression analyses to identify and predict GY and ABY at the catchment level. The coefficient of determination (R2), the root mean square error (RMSE), and relative importance (RI) were used for evaluating model performance. The findings revealed that the best-fitting curve was obtained between GY and NDVI (R2 = 0.70; RMSE = 0.065; P < 0.0001; RI = 0.19), followed by EVI (R2 = 0.65; RMSE = 0.024; RI = 0.61; P < 0.0001). While the best-fitting curve was obtained between ABY and GNDVI (R2 = 0.71; RI = 0.24; P < 0.0001), followed by NDVI (R2 = 0.77; RI = 0.17; P < 0.0001). The highest GY (7.18 ton/ha) and ABY (18.71 ton/ha) of maize were recorded at a soil bunded plot on a gentle slope. Combined spectral indices were also employed to predict GY with R2 (0.83) and RMSE (0.24) and ABY with R2 (0.78) and RMSE (0.12). Thus, the maize's GY and ABY can be predicted with acceptable accuracy using spectral reflectance indices derived from spectroradiometer in an area like the Aba Gerima catchment. An estimation model of crop yields could help policy-makers in identifying yield-limiting factors and achieve decisive actions to get better crop yields and food security for Ethiopia."
https://openalex.org/W4282968782,"Recently there have been tremendous efforts to develop statistical procedures which allow to determine subgroups of patients for which certain treatments are effective. This article focuses on the selection of prognostic and predictive genetic biomarkers based on a relatively large number of candidate Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs). We consider models which include prognostic markers as main effects and predictive markers as interaction effects with treatment. We compare different high-dimensional selection approaches including adaptive lasso, a Bayesian adaptive version of the Sorted L-One Penalized Estimator (SLOBE) and a modified version of the Bayesian Information Criterion (mBIC2). These are compared with classical multiple testing procedures for individual markers. Having identified predictive markers we consider several different approaches how to specify subgroups susceptible to treatment. Our main conclusion is that selection based on mBIC2 and SLOBE has similar predictive performance as the adaptive lasso while including substantially fewer biomarkers."
https://openalex.org/W4282972726,"This study aimed to discover predictors of subjective and objective difficulty in emotion perception from dynamic facial expressions. We used a multidimensional emotion perception framework, in which observers rated the perceived emotion along a number of dimensions instead of choosing from traditionally-used discrete categories of emotions. Data were collected online from 441 participants who rated facial expression stimuli in a novel paradigm designed to separately measure subjective (self-reported) and objective (deviation from the population consensus) difficulty. We targeted person-specific (sex and age of observers and actors) and stimulus-specific (valence and arousal values) predictors of those difficulty scores. Our findings suggest that increasing age of actors makes emotion perception more difficult for observers, and that perception difficulty is underestimated by men in comparison to women, and by younger and older adults in comparison to middle-aged adults. The results also yielded an increase in the objective difficulty measure for female observers and female actors. Stimulus-specific factors–valence and arousal–exhibited quadratic relationships with subjective and objective difficulties: Very positive and very negative stimuli were linked to reduced subjective and objective difficulty, whereas stimuli of very low and high arousal were linked to decreased subjective but increased objective difficulty. Exploratory analyses revealed low relevance of person-specific variables for the prediction of difficulty but highlighted the importance of valence in emotion perception, in line with functional accounts of emotions. Our findings highlight the need to complement traditional emotion recognition paradigms with novel designs, like the one presented here, to grasp the “big picture” of human emotion perception."

We test a measure with survey items and vignettes to capture gender-based value and stereotypes, an Implicit Association Test (IAT) capturing gender-based value, and an IAT capturing gender stereotype. All demonstrate good internal reliability, and both IATs are significantly associated with our survey measure suggesting criterion validity, though not confirming it due to the lack of a gold standard measure on gender attitudes. Finally, construct validity is indicated from the measures' positive significant associations with higher girls' mobility and education. The gender-related IAT tools developed are consistent and valid, and modestly correlated with gender-related behavior outcomes such as mobility and school enrolment."

Although manual testing using microscope examination and computer-assisted semen analysis are standard methods of measuring sperm count and motility, these methods are limited by being laboratory based. To investigate the usefulness of a novel semen analysis device using a smartphone camera. This prospective multicenter randomized parallel design trial enrolled 200 men aged ≥19 years of age between August and December 2018. Each subject was advised to use the Smart Sperm Test for OVIEW-M at home after 5 days of abstinence. The accuracy of the OVIEW-M test relative to the in-hospital test was determined. A questionnaire was administered to assess subject likelihood of using the OVIEW-M. Measurements using standard methods and the OVIEW-M showed similar sperm counts and similar motile sperm counts. Correlation analysis showed significant correlations between sperm count and sperm motility when measured by OVIEW-M tests (r = 0.893, p &lt; 0.01) and standard microscope examination (r = 0.883, p &lt; 0.01). Of the subjects who responded to questionnaires, 43% regarded the results of the OVIEW-M tests as reliable and 18% as unreliable. Semen analysis with the smartphone-based application and accessories yielded results not inferior to those of laboratory tests. Men who visit the hospital for evaluation of infertility can easily perform OVIEW-M semen tests at home."
https://openalex.org/W4283014235,"Neurons in visual area V4 modulate their responses depending on the figure-ground (FG) organization in natural images containing a variety of shapes and textures. To clarify whether the responses depend on the extents of the figure and ground regions in and around the classical receptive fields (CRFs) of the neurons, we estimated the spatial extent of local figure and ground regions that evoked FG-dependent responses (RF-FGs) in natural images and their variants. Specifically, we applied the framework of spike triggered averaging (STA) to the combinations of neural responses and human-marked segmentation images (FG labels) that represent the extents of the figure and ground regions in the corresponding natural image stimuli. FG labels were weighted by the spike counts in response to the corresponding stimuli and averaged over. The bias due to the nonuniformity of FG labels was compensated by subtracting the ensemble average of FG labels from the weighted average. Approximately 50% of the neurons showed effective RF-FGs, and a large number exhibited structures that were similar to those observed in virtual neurons with ideal FG-dependent responses. The structures of the RF-FGs exhibited a subregion responsive to a preferred side (figure or ground) around the CRF center and a subregion responsive to a non-preferred side in the surroundings. The extents of the subregions responsive to figure were smaller than those responsive to ground in agreement with the Gestalt rule. We also estimated RF-FG by an adaptive filtering (AF) method, which does not require spherical symmetry (whiteness) in stimuli. RF-FGs estimated by AF and STA exhibited similar structures, supporting the veridicality of the proposed STA. To estimate the contribution of nonlinear processing in addition to linear processing, we estimated nonlinear RF-FGs based on the framework of spike triggered covariance (STC). The analyses of the models based on STA and STC did not show inconsiderable contribution of nonlinearity, suggesting spatial variance of FG regions. The results lead to an understanding of the neural responses that underlie the segregation of figures and the construction of surfaces in intermediate-level visual areas."

Despite the prevalence and associated burden of post-stroke cognitive impairment, there is uncertainty regarding optimum interventions to improve cognitive function in people post-stroke. The aim of this study is to explore the perspectives of key stakeholders on the design and development of a multidisciplinary intervention to rehabilitate cognitive deficits in people post-stroke. Materials and methods Audio-recorded, semi-structured interviews were employed with people post-stroke, caregivers, healthcare professionals and academics. All transcribed interviews were exported to NVivo software and analysed using reflexive thematic analysis. Results Thirty interviews were conducted across stakeholder groups including people post-stroke (n = 10), caregivers (n = 5), healthcare professionals (n = 14) and academics (n = 1). Four themes relevant to the design and development of the intervention were identified (i) engagement in the intervention must be meaningful, (ii) the point of readiness to engage, (iii) a familiar but flexible setting is key (iv) pragmatics of intervention delivery. Conclusions These findings present new perspectives across stakeholder groups on the design and delivery of an intervention to rehabilitate cognitive deficits in people post-stroke. Taken together with existing quantitative evidence, these findings will inform the development of a feasibility trial, examining patient and process outcomes, to rehabilitate cognitive deficits post-stroke."
https://openalex.org/W4283019467,"Previous studies in the liverwort Marchantia polymorpha have shown that the putative evening complex (EC) genes LUX ARRHYTHMO (LUX) and ELF4-LIKE (EFL) have a function in the liverwort circadian clock. Here, we studied the growth phenotypes of MpLUX and MpEFL loss-of-function mutants, to establish if PHYTOCHROME-INTERACTING FACTOR (PIF) and auxin act downstream of the M. polymorpha EC in a growth-related pathway similar to the one described for the flowering plant Arabidopsis. We examined growth rates and cell properties of loss-of-function mutants, analyzed protein-protein interactions and performed gene expression studies using reporter genes. Obtained data indicate that an EC can form in M. polymorpha and that this EC regulates growth of the thallus. Altered auxin levels in Mplux mutants could explain some of the phenotypes related to an increased thallus surface area. However, because MpPIF is not regulated by the EC, and because Mppif mutants do not show reduced growth, the growth phenotype of EC-mutants is likely not mediated via MpPIF. In Arabidopsis, the circadian clock regulates elongation growth via PIF and auxin, but this is likely not an evolutionarily conserved growth mechanism in land plants. Previous inventories of orthologs to Arabidopsis clock genes in various plant lineages showed that there is high levels of structural differences between clocks of different plant lineages. Here, we conclude that there is also variation in the output pathways used by the different plant clocks to control growth and development."
https://openalex.org/W4283023181,"We aimed to elucidate the characteristics of HIV molecular epidemiology and identify transmission hubs in eastern China using genetic transmission network and lineage analyses. HIV-TRACE was used to infer putative relationships. Across the range of epidemiologically-plausible genetic distance (GD) thresholds (0.1-2.0%), a sensitivity analysis was performed to determine the optimal threshold, generating the maximum number of transmission clusters and providing reliable resolution without merging different small clusters into a single large cluster. Characteristics of genetically linked individuals were analyzed using logistic regression. Assortativity (shared characteristics) analysis was performed to infer shared attributes between putative partners. 1,993 persons living with HIV-1 were enrolled. The determined GD thresholds within subtypes CRF07_BC, CRF01_AE, and B were 0.5%, 1.2%, and 1.7%, respectively, and 826 of 1,993 (41.4%) sequences were linked with at least one other sequence, forming 188 transmission clusters of 2-80 sequences. Clustering rates for the main subtypes CRF01_AE, CRF07_BC, and B were 50.9% (523/1027), 34.2% (256/749), and 32.1% (25/78), respectively. Median cluster sizes of these subtypes were 2 (2-52, n = 523), 2 (2-80, n = 256), and 3 (2-6, n = 25), respectively. Subtypes in individuals diagnosed and residing in Hangzhou city (OR = 1.423, 95% CI: 1.168-1.734) and men who have sex with men (MSM) were more likely to cluster. Assortativity analysis revealed individuals were more likely to be genetically linked to individuals from the same age group (AIage = 0.090, P<0.001) and the same area of residency in Zhejiang (AIcity = 0.078, P<0.001). Additionally, students living with HIV were more likely to be linked with students than show a random distribution (AI student = 0.740, P<0.01). These results highlight the importance of Hangzhou City in the regional epidemic and show that MSM comprise the population rapidly transmitting HIV in Zhejiang Province.

Progenitor cell populations may on the other hand contribute to the renewal of other cell types, including endothelial and smooth muscle cells. The phenotypes of immature cell populations in the adult human heart have not been extensively explored. We therefore investigated whether SSEA4+CD34- cells might constitute immature cycling cardiomyocytes in the adult failing and non-failing human heart. The phenotypes of Side Population (SP) and C-kit+CD45- progenitor cells were also analyzed. Biopsies from the four heart chambers were obtained from patients with end-stage heart failure as well as organ donors without chronic heart failure. Freshly dissociated cells underwent flow cytometric analysis and sorting. SSEA4+CD34- cells expressed high levels of cardiomyocyte, stem cell and proliferation markers. This pattern resembles that of cycling, immature, cardiomyocytes, which may be important in endogenous cardiac regeneration. SSEA4+CD34- cells isolated from failing hearts tended to express lower levels of cardiomyocyte markers as well as higher levels of stem cell markers. C-kit+CD45- and SP CD45- cells expressed high levels of endothelial and stem cell markers–corresponding to endothelial progenitor cells involved in endothelial renewal."

Since the implementation of the health system reform plan as well as the allocation of new financial resources for health system in Iran, the rate of irrational prescription has increased and prescription of surfactant for neonates, has raised unexpectedly, which is thought to be due to irrational prescriptions partly. The present study aimed to determine the rate of irrational prescription of surfactant for neonates with respiratory distress.This research was a cross-sectional descriptive study, which was conducted retrospectively. In the current study, determining the rate of irrational prescription was done in terms of the surfactant prescription guideline. Finally, the medical data of 846 neonates who underwent surfactant therapy in Iran in 2018, were extracted from the information system of the Ministry of Health and the neonatal medical records.The results show that drug selection index, dose index, and time index were irrational for 14.30%, 27.42%, and 1.06% of neonates, respectively. Moreover, the total index of drug prescription, which is a combination of the above-mentioned three components, was found to be irrational for 31.47% of neonates.The results of the present study are considered as a warning to providers and decision makers in the field of neonatal health to reduce irrational prescriptions of surfactant for neonates. This study suggests the use of educational interventions in order to reduce irrational prescriptions due to drug selection as well as the use of computer alert approaches in order to reduce irrational prescriptions due to wrong dose."

Compound 40 (MIC~ 8 μM) was the most potent among all 60 compounds, whose potency is comparable with broad spectrum antibiotics like ciprofloxacin and streptomycin and three times more potent than pyrazinamide. Additionally, compound 40 was also less selective and hence non-toxic towards the human live cell lines-LO2 in its MTT assay. Compounds 30 , 27 , 50 , 41 , 51 , and 60 have exhibited streptomycin like activity (MIC~16–18 μM). Fluorinated chalcones, pyridine and pyran derivatives were found to occupy prime position in thymidylate kinase enzymatic pockets in molecular docking studies. The molecule 40 being most potent had shown a binding energy of -9.67 Kcal/mol, while docking against thymidylate kinase, which was compared with its in vitro MIC value (~8 μM). These findings suggest that 2-aminopyridine-3-carbonitrile and 2-amino-4H-pyran-3-carbonitrile derivatives are prospective lead molecules for the development of novel antitubercular drugs."
https://openalex.org/W4282967449,"Background Dementia is a big medical and socioeconomic problem on aging society, and cardiac diseases have already shown a significant contribution to developing dementia. However, the risk of dementia related to hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM), the most common inherited cardiomyopathy, has never been evaluated. Methods In a large-scale longitudinal cohort using National Health Insurance database, 4,645 subjects with HCM aged ≥50 years between 2010 and 2016 were collected and matched with 13,935 controls, based on propensity scores (1:3). We investigated the incidence and risk of dementia, Alzheimer’s disease (AD), and vascular dementia (VaD) between groups. Results During follow-up (median 3.9 years after 1-year lag), incident dementia occurred in 739 subjects (4.0%): 78.2% for AD and 13.0% for VaD. The incidence of dementia, AD, and VaD were 23.0, 18.0, and 2.9/1,000 person-years, respectively, and was generally more prevalent in HCM. HCM group had a 50% increased risk of dementia, particularly AD, whereas there was no difference in the risk of VaD. The impact of HCM on AD (HR 1.52, 95% CI 1.26–1.84, p &lt;0.001) was comparable with that of diabetes mellitus and smoking. Increased risk of AD in relation to HCM was consistent in various subgroups including younger healthier population. Conclusions This is the first to demonstrate the increased risk of dementia, mainly AD rather than VaD, in subjects with HCM. Early surveillance and active prevention for cognitive impairment could help for a better quality of life in an era that HCM is considered a chronic manageable disease with low mortality."
https://openalex.org/W4282975512,"Objective To explore the value of ultrasound in evaluating T/N staging of differentiated thyroid carcinoma (DTC). Methods The clinical data of 1206 patients with DTC in our hospital from January 2018 to December 2020 were retrospectively analyzed. Cervical ultrasound was performed before surgery, and the standard ultrasound images of thyroid nodules and cervical lymph nodes I to VII were retained. According to the 8th TNM staging guidelines of AJCC DTC, the T/N stages were assessed by preoperative ultrasonic data. Then, the sensitivity, specificity, negative predicted value, positive predicted value (PPV), and diagnostic value of ultrasound T/N staging were assessed using postoperative pathological staging as the reference. Results Ultrasonic T-stage had good consistency to pathological T stage in T4a and T4b tumors (kappa value&gt;0.75), and moderate consistency to pathological T stage in T1, T2 and T3a tumors (kappa value between 0.4 and 0.75). ultrasonic T-stage had a sensitivity higher than 66%, except in T3b assessment (13/44, 29.5%, 95%CI: 16.1%-43.0%). All ultrasonic T-stage had specificity higher than 93%, except in T1b assessment (734/889, 82.6%, 95%CI: 80.1%-85.1%). The PPV of ultrasonic T1a to T4b was 94.3% (494/524), 61.0% (242/397), 54.4% (87/160), 34.3% (12/35), 20.3% (13/64), 100% (22/22) and 100% (4/4), respectively. The diagnostic accuracy values were 83% in T1a, 81% in T1b, 91% in T2, 98% in T3a, 93% in T3b, 99% in T4a and 100% in T4b. Nltrasonic N-stage had poor consistency to pathological N stage in any N stages (kappa value&lt;0.3). The PPV of ultrasonic N0, N1, N1a and N1b was 61.0% (542/889), 55.2% (37/67), 48.2% (53/110), and 24.3% (34/140), respectively. Conclusion Ultrasound has a good consistency and high accuracy in assessing the T-stage of DTC. However, the consistency and accuracy were poor in N-staging. It has a certain reference value in reducing excessive surgical treatment of DTC."
https://openalex.org/W4282975530,"The brown alga Silvetia siliquosa (Tseng et Chang) Serrão, Cho, Boo & Brawly is endemic to the Yellow-Bohai Sea and southwestern Korea. It is increasingly endangered due to habitat loss and excessive collection. Here, we sequenced the mitochondrial (mt) and chloroplast (cp) genomes of S. siliquosa. De novo assembly showed that the mt-genome was 36,036 bp in length, including 38 protein-coding genes (PCGs), 26 tRNAs, and 3 rRNAs, and the cp-genome was 124,991 bp in length, containing 139 PCGs, 28 tRNAs, and 6 rRNAs. Gene composition, gene number, and gene order of the mt-genome and cp-genome were very similar to those of other species in Fucales. Phylogenetic analysis revealed a close genetic relationship between S. siliquosa and F. vesiculosus, which diverged approximately 8 Mya (5.7-11.0 Mya), corresponding to the Late Miocene (5.3-11.6 Ma). The synonymous substitution rate of mitochondrial genes of phaeophycean species was 1.4 times higher than that of chloroplast genes, but the cp-genomes were more structurally variable than the mt-genomes, with numerous gene losses and rearrangements among the different orders in Phaeophyceae. This study reports the mt- and cp-genomes of the endangered S. siliquosa and improves our understanding of its phylogenetic position in Phaeophyceae and of organellar genomic evolution in brown algae."
https://openalex.org/W4282978086,"The dynamic performance of the Model Predictive Control (MPC) of an Induction Motor (IM) relies on the accuracy and computational efficiency of the Discretisation Technique (DT). If the discretisation process is inaccurate or slow approximation, the MPC will exhibit high torque ripple and lower load handling capabilities. Traditionally, Euler's method is used to discretise the MPC, which merely relies on the predictor to yield a fast, but less accurate system approximation. In contrast, Heun's method uses a combination of predictor and corrector at alternate sampling intervals to improve the discretisation accuracy; however, the controller response becomes slow due to increased computational intensity of the algorithm. In this study, a new Hybrid Discretisation Technique (HDT) for Model Predictive Field Oriented Control (MPFOC) for IM control systems is presented to achieve robust discretisation with improved accuracy. In the proposed approach, Euler's method is used to discretise the system at the first nine samples, followed by the predictor-corrector at the tenth sampling interval, accomplishing the desired speed and accuracy of discretisation. This newly proposed HDT in MPFOC is verified with Processor-In-Loop (PIL) for a three-phase IM with bi-directional rotation under varying load conditions. The results indicate that the IM torque ripple is reduced by up to 20%, whereas, the load handling capability is increased by up to 10%. Moreover, the controller gives 20% and 23% improvement in rise time and settling time, respectively, under high loading conditions, as compared to traditional Euler and Heun methods."
https://openalex.org/W4282978490,"Biocatalysts are widely used in industry, but few examples of the use of oxidoreductases, in which enzymatic function often requires electrons, have been reported. NADPH is a cofactor that supplies an electron to oxidoreductases, but is consequently inactivated and no longer able to act as an electron donor. NADP + can not receive electrons from electrodes through straightforward electrochemistry owing to its complicated three-dimensional structure. This study reports that bipyridines effectively mediate electron transfer between an electrode and NADP + , allowing them to serve as electron mediators for NADPH production. Using bipyridines, quinones, and anilines, which have negative oxidation–reduction potentials, an electrochemical investigation was conducted into whether electrons were transferred to NADP + . Only bipyridines with a reduction potential near -1.0 V exhibited electron transfer. Furthermore, the NADPH production level was measured using spectroscopy. NADPH was efficiently produced using bipyridines, such as methyl viologen and ethyl viologen, in which the bipyridyl 1- and 1’-positions bear small substituents. However, methyl viologen caused a dehydrogenation reaction of NADPH, making it unsuitable as an electron mediator for NADPH production. The dehydrogenation reaction did not occur using ethyl viologen. These results indicated that NADP + can be reduced more effectively using substituents that prevent a dehydrogenation reaction at the bipyridyl 1- and 1’-positions while maintaining the reducing power."
https://openalex.org/W4282981442,"Antidote stocking represents a major challenge to hospitals all over the world, including Kuwait. In order to assist hospitals to reduce costs and improve patient care, an essential antidote list can be used as an initial foundation for securing sufficient antidote availability at healthcare institutions. The aim of our study is to generate a nationally relevant essential antidote list for emergency care hospitals in Kuwait using the e-Delphi method by establishing consensus through a multidisciplinary expert group of healthcare providers. An electronic survey with 47 essential antidotes was developed. The e-Delphi method was used, with three rounds of voting, to determine expert consensus on an essential antidote list for hospitals in Kuwait. A purposive sample of healthcare professionals from governmental and private hospitals were selected for this study (n = 30). Consensus was gained if ≥75% of the expert panel agreed on the inclusion of the antidote, without any strong disagreements. Round 1 of the e-Delphi resulted in 41 antidotes reaching consensus and seven new antidotes suggested by the expert panel. Round 2 had two antidotes (out of seven newly suggested ones) reaching consensus. Round 3 was a confirmatory round, where the expert group agreed on their previous rounds' opinions. This resulted in the development of an essential antidote list with 43 antidotes. The optimal approach for ensuring adequate availability of antidotes is continuous monitoring of local poisoning incidence and antidote requirements through collaborations between academic researchers and emergency care clinicians. The development of an essential antidote list, with expert consensus, is one of the initial steps in securing a foundation for appropriate provision of antidotes at all healthcare institutions. This is the first study that the authors are aware of that demonstrates that the e-Delphi technique can consolidate recommendations of experts in emergency medicine to provide a list of essential antidotes."
https://openalex.org/W4283009951,"Introduction Consumer escalation systems allow patients and families to escalate concerns about acute clinical deterioration. Hospital staff can impact upon the success of this process. As part of evaluation processes within a Local Health Network, where a consumer escalation system was introduced in accordance with National requirements, we sought to explore clinicians’ understanding and perceptions of consumer escalation. Methods Voluntary and anonymous staff surveys pre, and post, system introduction. Quantitative data was analysed using descriptive statistics, chi-square independence, and non-parametric independent samples median tests. Qualitative data was evaluated using content analysis and cross-referenced with quantitative responses. Results Respondent’s (pre: 215; post: 89) area of work varied significantly between survey periods. Most agreed that patients/families have a sound knowledge of a patient’s typical health status (pre: 192/215 (89.3%); post 82/88 (93.2%)) and that patients/families should be encouraged to escalate concerns of deterioration to ward staff (pre: 209/212 (98.6%); post: 85/89 (95.5%)). Respondent perceptions of patient/family ability to recognise clinical deterioration varied. Staff agreement towards local response expectations decreased as the degree of clinical requirement increased. Staff concerns of increased workloads (pre: 90/214 (42.1%); post 12/72 (16.7%), p&lt;0.001) and conflict generation (pre: 71/213 (33.3%); post: 7/71 (9.9%), p = 0.001) decreased significantly following system introduction. However, clinician perceptions of positive system effects also decreased (patient-staff rapport pre: 163/213 (76.5%); post: 38/72 (52.8%), p = 0.001; patient centred care pre: 188/214 (87.9%); post: 53/72 (73.6%), p = 0.012; patient safety pre: 173/214 (80.8%); post: 49/72 (68.1%), p = 0.077). Only 53% of respondents (pre: 112/213 (52.6%); post: 48/88 (54.5%)) perceived that patient/family have sufficient confidence to escalate concerns. Conclusion Consumer escalation systems require staff support. Staff perceptions may indicate, and act as, barriers to the operation of consumer escalation processes. Further exploration in identifying and managing staff barriers is crucial to the success of consumer escalation."
https://openalex.org/W4283022351,"This paper examines how to reduce the number of control animals in preclinical hyperinsulemic glucose clamp studies if we make use of information on historical studies. A dataset consisting of 59 studies in rats to investigate new insulin analogues for diabetics, collected in the years 2000 to 2015, is analysed. A simulation experiment is performed based on a carefully built nonlinear mixed-effects model including historical information, comparing results (for the relative log-potency) with the standard approach ignoring previous studies. We find that by including historical information in the form of the mixed-effects model proposed, we can to remove between 23% and 51% of the control rats in the two studies looked closely upon to get the same level of precision on the relative log-potency as in the standard analysis. How to incorporate the historical information in the form of the mixed-effects model is discussed, where both a mixed-effect meta-analysis approach as well as a Bayesian approach are suggested. The conclusions are similar for the two approaches, and therefore, we conclude that the inclusion of historical information is beneficial in regard to using fewer control rats."
https://openalex.org/W4283025030,"Fever is one of the common clinical symptoms found among children suffering from various illnesses. India carries a substantial burden of febrile illness among under-five children which heighten the risk of malnutrition, mortality and morbidity. This study aims to determine the factors associated with delay in treatment-seeking for fever among under-five children in India.A cross-sectional study was carried out using the large-scale nationally representative data from the National Family Health Survey (NFHS-4), conducted in 2015-2016. The data were collected by using four survey questionnaires i.e., Household Questionnaire, Woman's Questionnaire, Man's Questionnaire, and Biomarker Questionnaire. Delay in treatment-seeking was defined as taking a child for treatment after 24 hours of fever onset. Bivariate and multivariate logistic regression models were performed to assess the factors associated with delay in treatment-seeking behaviour for fever in under-five children.In India, 31.12% (n = 7229) of the caregivers sought treatment for children after 24 hours of the onset of fever. Findings show no significant differences in delay in treatment-seeking behaviour by age groups and sex of children. Multivariate analysis revealed that the odds of delay in treatment-seeking behaviour of fever were higher among children from the poorest wealth quintile (AOR: 2.06; 95% CI: 1.85, 2.31), belonging to the scheduled tribe (AOR: 1.35; 95% CI: 1.24, 1.48), children who resided in rural areas (AOR: 1.14; 95% CI: 1.07, 1.22), children from the northeast region (AOR: 1.29; 95% CI: 1.14, 1.46), and children of caregivers who perceived distance to health facilities as a 'big problem' (AOR: 1.16; 95% CI: 1.09, 1.23).The study shows a high prevalence of delay in seeking treatment for fever among caregivers of under-five children in India. Delay in seeking treatment is associated with socio-demographic and socio-economic factors. Therefore, there is a need for intensified health promotion programs to sensitize caregivers on the importance of early health-seeking behaviour."
https://openalex.org/W4283032595,"The Lagrangian vortex method has the advantage of producing highly detailed simulations of fluids such as turbulent smoke. However, this method has two problems: the construction of the velocity field from the vorticity field is inefficient, and handling the boundary condition is difficult. We present a pure Lagrangian vortex method, including a nested grid to accelerate the construction of the velocity field, and a novel boundary treatment method for the vorticity field. Based on a tree structure, the nested grid algorithm considerably improves the efficiency of the velocity computation while producing visual results that are comparable with the original flow. Based on the vortex-generating method, the least square method is used to compute the vorticity strength of the new vortex elements. Further, we consider the mutual influence between the generated vortex particles. We demonstrate our method's benefits by using a vortex ring and various examples of interaction between the smoke and obstacles."
https://openalex.org/W4283034431,"Microelectrodes are commonly used in electrochemical analysis and biological sensing applications owing to their miniaturised dimensions. It is often desirable to improve the performance of microelectrodes by reducing their electrochemical impedance for increasing the signal-to-noise of the recorded signals. One successful route is to incorporate nanomaterials directly onto microelectrodes; however, it is essential that these fabrication routes are simple and repeatable. In this article, we demonstrate how to synthesise metal encapsulated ZnO nanowires (Cr/Au-ZnO NWs, Ti-ZnO NWs and Pt-ZnO NWs) to reduce the impedance of the microelectrodes. Electrochemical impedance modelling and characterisation of Cr/Au-ZnO NWs, Ti-ZnO NWs and Pt-ZnO NWs are carried out in conjunction with controls of planar Cr/Au and pristine ZnO NWs. It was found that the ZnO NW microelectrodes that were encapsulated with a 10 nm thin layer of Ti or Pt demonstrated the lowest electrochemical impedance of 400 ± 25 kΩ at 1 kHz. The Ti and Pt encapsulated ZnO NWs have the potential to offer an alternative microelectrode modality that could be attractive to electrochemical and biological sensing applications."
