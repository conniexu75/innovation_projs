https://openalex.org/W1594281994,"Hydrogen peroxide, superoxide radical, and hydroxyl radical were all formed during the autoxidation of four cytotoxic agents, namely, 6-hydroxydopamine, 6-aminodopamine, 6,7-dihydroxytryptamine, and dialuric acid. Ascorbic acid and 5-hydroxydopamine, two autoxidizable agents of biological interest but without similar cytotoxic actions, were used as negative controls. The results tend to implicate O2- and ·OH, as well as H2O2, in the molecular mechanisms for cytotoxicity. Production of H2O2 was measured with an oxygen electrode. Accumulation of H2O2 was apparent from the return to solution of approximately one-half of the consumed oxygen after the addition of catalase. Superoxide radicals were detected by reduction of cytochrome c, with inhibition by superoxide dismutase. Although O2- radicals were observed previously by other means during the autoxidation of 6-hydroxydopamine, there was no clear effect in the cytochrome c system. This may have been due, in part, to a previously described scavenging of O2- by 6-hydroxydopamine itself. Hydroxyl radicals were detected by reaction with β-methylthiopropionaldehyde to form ethylene. Catalase or superoxide dismutase inhibited ethylene production. These results point to a reaction between H2O2 and O2- (Haber-Weiss reaction) as a major source of the ·OH radicals. Ethylene production was inhibited by known ·OH trappers, such as benzoate and ethanol, and by a variety of other agents. Catechol and the catecholamines, dopamine and norepinephrine, were very potent inhibitors of ethylene production. The effectiveness of these agents may have been due to a combined action of blocking ·OH formation as well as accelerating its removal. Superoxide dismutase had a biphasic effect in the 6-hydroxydopamine system, inhibitory at early times but causing increased accumulation of ethylene at later times. An explanation for this latter phenomenon may be based on a reaction between O2- and ·OH, as described by other investigators."

The time course of binding of 125I-insulin and displacement of tracer at the plateau of binding was measured as a function of temperature and ionic strength. Hormone tracer concentrations were in the low physiologic range. The reaction is complex and includes reversible binding of insulin to its receptor and degradation of both insulin and receptor. The degrading reactions were minimized by using low to medium membrane concentrations and were corrected for by measuring the intact insulin remaining. When the binding reaction was studied over the range of 0.06 to 1000 ng per ml of insulin at 30°, the data fit a model with a minimum of three classes of receptor sites: a high affinity low capacity site with a K of 2.0 x 109 m-1 and a capacity of 5 x 10-14 moles per mg of membrane protein; a low affinity-high capacity site with a K of 2.1 x 108 m-1 and a capacity of 1.5 x 10-12 moles per mg of membrane protein; and a very low affinity-high capacity site (nonspecific site) representing about 5% of the total tracer binding. Both the affinity and binding capacity are influenced by temperature and ionic strength. Kinetic data for insulin receptor complex dissociation are also consistent with heterogeneity of receptor sites. Discrepancies in the literature between the number of reported classes of insulin receptor sites and their affinity constants are discussed in terms of the variables of this complex reaction."
https://openalex.org/W2099828606,"Spinach chloroplasts induced the photoreduction of cytochrome c and photooxidation of epinephrine, both of which depended on oxygen and were inhibited by superoxide dismutase. This confirmed the univalent reduction of molecular oxygen in illuminated chloroplasts. In the presence of cytochrome c, hydrogen peroxide formation by chloroplasts was inhibited completely. Rates for the photoreduction of cytochrome c and the formation of hydrogen peroxide were equivalent, indicating that the univalent reduction of oxygen is a part of the Mehler reaction and the divalent reduction of oxygen is absent in chloroplasts. Spinach ferredoxin, cytochrome c-reducing substance, and phenazine methosulfate did not stimulate or decrease the superoxide dismutase-inhibited rates of the photoreduction of cytochrome c and photo-oxidation of epinephrine. Chloroplasts treated with histone, which blocked Photosystem I, could not photooxidize epinephrine. Thus, we propose that the univalent reducing site of oxygen is a primary electron acceptor in Photosystem I."

https://openalex.org/W2102626025,"Abstract Lipoprotein lipase was purified from acetone powders of pig adipose tissue. Extraction of acetone powders with 1.2 m NaCl in 0.005 m sodium-barbital buffer, pH 7.4, or heparin (200 units per ml) in distilled water, was 6 times as effective as extraction with 0.025 m NH4OH-NH4Cl buffer, pH 8.6, the commonly used extractant for lipoprotein lipase. At pH values below 7.5, over 85% of the activity extracted into 1.2 m NaCl could be recovered after 4 hours. The partially purified enzyme at later stages was stabilized by the inclusion of 20% glycerol in the buffers. Most of the purification was accomplished by affinity chromatography on Sepharose 4B columns containing covalently bound heparin. At this step, the preparation was purifed 600-fold. This purified enzyme binds reversibly to columns containing concanavalin A covalently bound to Sepharose. Lipolytic activity was eluted from concanavalin A-Sepharose column with 0.2 m α-methyl-d-mannoside, 1.0 m NaCl and 0.005 m sodium-barbital, pH 7.0. At this stage, the enzyme was purified 2100-fold. Isoelectric focusing yielded a single major peak of activity with an isoelectric point of 4.0. Minimum molecular weight determination by gel filtration in buffers containing 1.0 m NaCl and by disc gel electrophoresis in sodium dodecyl sulfate yielded values of 62,000 and 60,000, respectively. The crude enzyme, and that eluted from heparin-Sepharose columns, did not show stimulation by heparin, whereas that obtained after isoelectric focusing exhibited a 60 to 100% stimulation at 22 µg of heparin per ml. Activation by dialyzed serum was dependent on the stage of purification. The crude enzyme showed a 20-fold stimulation by serum but showed some activity in its absence; that purified by isoelectric focusing exhibited a complete dependence on the presence of serum for hydrolysis of triolein emulsions stabilized with gum arabic. Of the three very low density lipoprotein apoproteins studied, only apoLp-Glu could substitute for serum as an activator. In the presence of serum in the assay system, apoLp-Ser was as potent an inhibitor of lipoprotein lipase as apoLp-Ala."
https://openalex.org/W1508757311,"Abstract Isolated rat fat cells were incubated with insulin or lipolytic agents and measurements made of the activity of low Km cyclic adenosine 3' : 5'-monophosphate (cyclic AMP) phosphodiesterase in subsequently prepared fat-free homogenates. In the assay [3H]adenosine production from cyclic[3H]AMP was measured. Insulin consistently increased Vmax, did not alter Km (0.3 µm), and was ineffective when added to homogenates. As little as 7.5 microunits per ml of insulin increased phosphodiesterase activity by 18% and 50 microunits produced maximum stimulation of 65%. Incubation of fat cells with isoproterenol, epinephrine, or adrenocorticotropic hormone increased phosphodiesterase activity by 20 to 30 %. The effect of lipolytic hormones on phosphodiesterase activity could be reproduced when fat cells were incubated with 2.0 mm N6, O2'-dibutyryl adenosine 3' : 5'-monophosphate. The effect of insulin on phosphodiesterase activity was apparent within 2 min, was maximum at 5 min, and was sustained for at least 60 min. The response to isoproterenol was equally rapid, reaching a peak at 5 to 10 min but was not sustained. The fall in phosphodiesterase activity observed with isoproterenol was apparently related to intracellular ATP depletion. Homogenates prepared from fat cells preincubated with insulin and isoproterenol were separated into 50,000 x g particulate and supernatant fractions. The low Km phosphodiesterase activity associated with the particulate fraction was increased, while that of the supernatant was unaffected by hormonal preincubation. These data suggest that the antilipolytic effect of insulin may be mediated through activation of low Km phosphodiesterase. As well, the activation of phosphodiesterase produced by lipolytic hormones may be responsible for the failure of these agents to produce sustained increases in adipocyte intracellular cyclic AMP."
https://openalex.org/W1523220226,"Equilibrium and kinetic studies of the isomerization of horse heart ferricytochrome c at alkaline pH have been carried out using difference spectroscopy and stopped flow techniques. The minimal reaction scheme is: [see PDF for equation] where CH and C are species of ferricytochrome c which exhibit a 695 nm absorbance band, and NC (no color) is a form without this band; the oxidation-reduction potentials of CH and NC differ significantly. The values of the constants in this scheme were determined at 25° except for the oxidation and reduction rate constants, which were determined at 22°. The pH dependence of the observed rate constant for the conformational changes was measured as the change in the 695 nm band absorbance and as the release and uptake of hydrogen ions. From this it was calculated that the ionizing group in the scheme above has an apparent pK of 11.0 ± 0.1 at 25°. The conformation equilibrium constant, Kc, defined as κf/κb, was found to be 125 ± 36 at 25°. An over-all pK of 9.0 was calculated from the product of the equilibrium constants, in agreement with the over-all pK of 9.0 determined from the pH dependence of the 695 nm band at equilibrium. Spectrophotometric measurements at 243 nm indicate that tyrosine is not the ionizing group with an apparent pK of 11. It is suggested that the difference in oxidation-reduction potential and the absorbance band at 695 nm arises by substituting the sulfur of Met-80 as one of the ligands of the iron porphyrin in CH by the e-amino group of Lys-79 in NC. This suggestion, consistent with structural information, is accessible to experimental verification."
https://openalex.org/W1500549143,"Abstract The inhibition of protein synthesis by diphtheria toxin in extracts of mammalian cells results from the inactivation of elongation factor 2 (EF-2) by covalent attachment of the adenosine diphosphate ribose (ADPR) moiety of NAD+. NAD+ + EF-2 ⇌ ADPR-EF-2 + nicotinamide + H+ This reaction is catalyzed by Fragment A (mol wt 24,000) or other less common fragments generated by limited proteolysis and reduction of the toxin, but not by the toxin itself (mol wt 63,000). This report describes studies of the interaction of NAD+ with Fragment A. In addition to its major enzymic activity, Fragment A also catalyzes the slow hydrolysis of the nicotinamide-ribose linkage of NAD+. NAD+ + H2O ⇌ ADPR + nicotinamide + H+ This activity (NAD+-glycohydrolase; EC 3.2.2.5) is several orders of magnitude lower than the NAD+:EF-2-ADPR-transferase activity and probably does not contribute to the toxicity of diphtheria toxin. However, its existence implies a direct binding of NAD+ to Fragment A and is of interest with regard to the mechanism of transfer of ADPR to EF-2. Binding of NAD+ and related compounds to Fragment A was studied by dynamic dialysis, fluorescence quenching, and spectral absorbance techniques. The fragment contains a single binding site for NAD+ with a Kd of about 8 µm. Binding of NAD+ is rapidly reversible, and no evidence of a covalent ADPR-Fragment A intermediate was found. NAD+ strongly quenches the intrinsic fluorescence of the fragment (emission maximum 333 nm) and induces a broad peak of absorbance at 360 nm (e ∼ 500). Both effects are interpreted to result from formation of a charge transfer complex between the nicotinamide moiety of NAD+ and at least one of the tryptophan residues of the fragment. Binding of NAD+ also enhances the resistance of the fragment to trypsin or chymotrypsin. No significant change in either the sedimentation coefficient (2.19 S) or the rotational relaxation time was found upon addition of NAD+. The affinities of various NAD+ analogs and partial structures for the binding site on Fragment A closely paralleled their activities as inhibitors or substrates of ADPR transfer. These results, together with the fact that Fragment A alone hydrolyzes the same linkage which is ruptured during ADPR transfer, leave little doubt that it is this binding site which is involved in transfer of ADPR to EF-2. A model of the ADP-ribosylation of EF-2 is proposed based on these and other results."
https://openalex.org/W1587418696,"Abstract Hepatocytes, prepared by collagenase treatment of livers of ad libitum- and meal-fed rats, were incubated with glucose, fructose, lactate, and a number of other substrates, labeled uniformly with 14C and in the presence of 3HOH. The uptake of lactate and the incorporation of 14C into CO2 and glucose equals or exceeds rates reported in perfused liver. The 14C yield in glucose from labeled fructose, glycerol, and dihydroxyacetone exceeds considerably that in CO2 and greatly that in lipids. The 14C yield in CO2 from pyruvate, lactate, alanine, and acetate is equal to or exceeds that in glucose, and the fraction incorporated into lipids is greater than that from the neutral compounds. Fatty acid synthesis is greatly increased in meal-fed as compared to ad libitum-fed animals. Incorporation of glucose and of lactate carbon into fatty acids increases with concentration up to concentrations of 100 mm. Lactate carbon is a much better fatty acid precursor than glucose carbon. When both substrates are present at physiological concentrations (10 mm in glucose and 2 mm in lactate), the incorporation of lactate exceeds several times that of glucose carbon. At concentrations below 10 mm fructose is a better precursor of fatty acids than glucose, but the reverse is true at higher concentrations. Fructose and glycerol at concentrations above 5 mm inhibit the incorporation of 3H from 3HOH into fatty acids. In cells from meal-fed rats considerable incorporation of 3H from 3HOH into fatty acids occurs in the absence of added substrate. The ratio, microatoms of 14C from substrate to microatoms of 3H from water (14C:3H ratio), in the presence of low glucose concentrations is below 0.1 and increases at 100 mm glucose up to 0.5 to 0.7. Lactate stimulates 3H incorporation up to a concentration of 20 mm, but incorporation of lactate carbon continues to increase. The 14C:3H ratio attains values close to 1.0 at about 20 mm and increases to 1.5 to 2.0 at 100 mm lactate. The incorporation of tritium from water into fatty acids by hepatocytes of meal-fed rats in the presence of 10 to 20 mm lactate ranged in most experiments from 200 to 600 µatoms per g dry weight per hour, but in a number of experiments rates above 1000 µatoms per g per hour were obtained. This corresponds to an incorporation of over 120 acetyl equivalents per g wet weight of tissue per hour. Our results indicate that free glucose has a minor role as direct precursor of fatty acids in liver, and the major substrates are glycogen and lactate. Due to the presence of glycogen and the reversibility of glycogen and glucose synthesis and glycolysis in liver, the quantitative interpretation of 14C incorporation from labeled glucose is difficult."

https://openalex.org/W1578657852,"Abstract Artificial myoglobins and hemoglobins containing cobaltous proto-, meso-, and deuteroporphyrins and their interaction with oxygen are examined by X- and K-band electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy in a range from 4.2°K to room temperature. Deoxy cobalt porphyrin-substituted myoglobin (CoMb) and cobalt porphyrin-substituted hemoglobin (CoHb) exhibit an EPR absorption of axial symmetry (g⊥ = 2.3 and g|| = 2.0) with 59Co hyperfine and 14N superhyperfine splittings at the g|| extreme. These features are consistent with a penta-coordinated, square-pyramidal configuration of the low spin cobaltous ion (3d7, S = ½) in deoxy CoMb and deoxy CoHb. Upon oxygenation, the deoxy EPR absorption is replaced by another EPR absorption of a free radical type with axial symmetry (g⊥ = 2.00 and g|| = 2.08), indicating a substantial transfer of the unpaired spin density from the cobaltous ion to the bound oxygen. The oxy EPR absorption is sharpened upon measurements in D2O, suggesting a possible hydrogen bonding of the paramagnetic center (the bound oxygen) to the distal histidine residue. Oxy CoMb and oxy CoHb are readily photolyzed at 4.2°K. The reversion of the photolyzed products to the original oxy state is essentially retarded below 20°K. Visible absorption spectra of the photolyzed products are indistinguishable from those of the corresponding deoxy compounds. However, the photolyzed products exhibit new EPR extrema at g = 3.87 and ∼ 1.9, which may be attributable to a new intermediate of photolysis containing a high spin cobaltous ion (3d7, S = 3/2)."

https://openalex.org/W1583633691,"Plasma membranes isolated from bovine corpora lutea showed specific binding with 125I-human chorionic gonadotropin and 125I-human luteinizing hormone; unlabeled hormones competitively inhibited the binding. The binding of the 125I-human chorionic gonadotropin to the receptor was a saturable phenomenon and the half-saturation was attained at a concentration of 4 x 10-10 m . Maximum hormone receptor binding was obtained within 15 min at pH 7.2 and 37°. The rate constants of association and dissociation of human chorionic gonadotropin to the receptor determined at 37° were 2.8 x 106 m -1 s -1 and 2.1 x 10-5 s -1, respectively. The dissociation constant calculated from these rates was 8.0 x 10-10 m . At 4° the rate of association was extremely slow and the hormone receptor complex was stable up to 48 hours. The dissociation constants obtained from equilibrium data were calculated to be 1.5 x 10-10 m for human chorionic gonadotropin and the number of binding sites were approximately 6.3 x 10-15 per mg of tissue. The binding of 125I-human chorionic gonadotropin to the plasma membranes was optimum at pH 7.2 and was reduced at acidic and basic pH. The binding was also inhibited at high concentrations of CaCl2, MgCl2, and NaCl, and in the presence of guanidine HCl and urea. The inhibition of binding at pH 5 and 9 and up to 1 m concentration of various ions was reversible. Treatment of plasma membrane with phospholipase C, neuraminidase, glucosidase, trypsin, and α-chymotrypsin did not decrease the binding of 125I-human chorionic gonadotropin. Pepsin and phospholipase A inhibited the binding of 125I-human chorionic gonadotropin to plasma membranes. The plasma membranes were solubilized in detergents. The proteins reprecipitated from the solution by ethanol-ammonium acetate retained the ability to bind 125I-human chorionic gonadotropin. Solubilization of the plasma membranes in 6 m guanidine HCl resulted in the separation of protein and lipid components. Fractionation of the protein component was achieved by gel filtration on a column of Sepharose 4B in 6 m guanidine HCl and ion exchange chromatography on DEAE-cellulose in 3 m urea. The receptor activity of the purified fractions could be reconstituted by emulsification with the lipid fraction, indicating the requirement of lipids to retain the native conformation of the receptor. The molecular weight of the active material estimated from Sepharose 4B column in 6 m guanidine HCl and polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis in sodium dodecyl sulfate was between 30,000 to 70,000. This partially purified protein may represent the regulatory subunit of the gonadotropin receptor."

https://openalex.org/W1506445145,"Abstract The molecular properties of the principal protein component of human high density lipoprotein have been evaluated in aqueous solution at pH 2.0, 7.4, and 12.0 and in guanidine hydrochloride at pH 7.4. The high helical content observed at neutral pH by circular dichroism is partly eliminated in acid, more extensively lost in alkali, and almost completely lost in 1.7 m guanidine hydrochloride. The fluorescence properties of the tryptophanyl residues also indicate greater loss of structure in 1.7 m guanidine hydrochloride than in aqueous solutions at any pH. ApoA-I contains both secondary and tertiary structure in water at neutral pH comparable to that found in native globular proteins and undergoes molecular transitions below pH ∼7, above pH ∼11, and in guanidine hydrochloride solutions between 0.8 to 1.4 m. The properties of succinylated apoA-I at neutral pH resemble those of apoA-I at pH 12.0."
https://openalex.org/W1551250386,"Abstract Reaction mixtures containing coenzyme B12 (5'-deoxyadenosylcobalamin), an equivalent concentration of ribonucleotide reductase from Lactobacillus leichmannii, dGTP, and dihydrolipoate were incubated for 6 to 1000 ms at 37° in a rapid reaction apparatus and then freeze-quenched. When the frozen samples were examined by EPR spectroscopy, an EPR signal previously undescribed for coenzyme B12 systems was observed, but the signal was not observed with samples frozen more slowly. The kinetics of the appearance of this signal closely parallel those of the spectrophotometric changes observed previously in this system by stopped flow techniques. When GTP is substituted for dGTP, the paramagnetic species first accumulates and then disappears with kinetics again following those seen by stopped flow spectroscopy. The maximum spin concentration attained in the presence of dGTP or GTP is somewhat higher than that of the intermediate concentration calculated from the spectrophotometric changes, corresponding to about 60% of the original enzyme or coenzyme concentration, whichever is limiting. Changes in the reaction components affect the concentration of the species observed by EPR and by spectrophotometry in the same way. It is concluded that the EPR spectrum and the changes in absorption spectrum are due to the formation of the same cobamide intermediate of ribonucleotide reduction. The EPR spectrum has not yet been analyzed in sufficient detail to permit proposal of the structure for the intermediate, but it is considered possible that it may be a B12r-deoxyadenosyl radical-enzyme complex."
https://openalex.org/W1480773423,"Abstract The inert coordination complex, chromium ATP, has been used to study the steady state kinetic mechanisms of acetate, pyruvate, and 3-phosphoglycerate kinases. With pyruvate and 3-phosphoglycerate kinases, CrATP competes with both substrates and has a dissociation constant of 200 µm. This behavior is consistent with a random sequential mechanism for these enzymes. The fact that saturation with the non-nucleotide substrate eliminates most or all of the CrATP inhibition makes these enzymes useful as coupling enzymes (together with lactate dehydrogenase or glyceraldehyde-P dehydrogenase) in assays for other kinases when CrATP inhibition is being studied. With acetate kinase, CrATP competes with MgATP and is noncompetitive versus acetate. As a product inhibitor, acetyl phosphate is noncompetitive versus either MgATP or acetate. Initial velocity studies show the enzyme to have a sequential mechanism. A random mechanism is proposed which accounts for the kinetic data, and for the isotope exchanges and the phosphoenzyme isolated by other workers."
https://openalex.org/W2065183520,"The mucosal epithelium of the toad urinary bladder reabsorbs sodium, acidifies the urine, and is responsive to neurohypophyseal hormones. Mucosal epithelial cells, consisting of two major morphologic cell types, ""mitochondria-rich"" and ""granular,"" were removed from the bladder and separated by density gradient centrifugation. The mitochondria-rich cells contained three times as much carbonic anhydrase activity as the granular cells. Oxytocin caused a 235 percent increase in the adenosine 3′,5′-monophosphate content of mitochondria-rich cells but had no effect on the granular cells. The evidence indicates that the mitochondria-rich cell, which accounts for only 15 percent of the mucosal cells, plays a major role in the mediation of sodium ion and hydrogen ion transport in the toad bladder and is a specific site of action of neurohypophyseal hormones."
https://openalex.org/W1599100308,"Abstract Angiotensin-converting enzyme was found in rat lung predominantly in association with membranous subcellular particles. The converting enzyme was solubilized from a particulate fraction of rat lung that sedimented between 775 and 54,000 x g with sodium deoxycholate and was subsequently purified with DEAE-cellulose and Sephadex G-200 chromatography. The fraction with converting enzyme activity obtained from Sephadex G-200 chromatography had an estimated molecular weight of 270,000 as observed by gel filtration. Analytical disc gel electrophoresis of this preparation showed a single band. The specific converting enzyme activity of the purified preparation was 17.6 µmoles per min per mg with hippurylhistidylleucine as substrate and 1.8 µmoles per min per mg with angiotensin 1 as substrate. This represented a greater than 100-fold purification of the activity of subcellular particles. Sodium chloride was required for activation of the enzyme, and it was inhibited by EDTA, bradykinin potentiating factor-nonapeptide, and angiotensin 2, but not by histidylleucine. The purified preparation was free of carboxypeptidase activity on angiotensin 1. The distribution of converting enzyme activity in subcellular particles from rat lung paralleled that of 5'-AMPase activity which has been associated with pinocytotic vesicles of endothelial membranes. Little or no converting enzyme activity was present in particles obtained from lung lavage."
https://openalex.org/W1594139819,"Abstract The specific interaction of glucocorticoids with fetal and adult rabbit tissues was studied in vitro. Specific cytoplasmic binding sites for [3H]dexamethasone were demonstrated in liver, thymus, kidney, lung, muscle, heart, small intestine, skin, brain, and placenta of the rabbit fetus as well as in liver, thymus, spleen, kidney, small intestine, and lung of the adult rabbit. In the rabbit fetus at 28 to 30 days of gestation the concentration of specific binding sites for [3H]dexamethasone was higher (1.62 to 1.83 pmoles per mg of DNA) in placenta, kidney, and lung, somewhat lower (0.69 to 1.25 pmoles per mg of DNA) in skin, muscle, small intestine, and heart, and much lower (0.35 to 0.49 pmole per mg of DNA) in liver, thymus, and brain. Sucrose density gradient analysis of tissue extracts showed the presence of one or two [3H]dexamethasone-macromolecular complexes sedimenting at 7 to 8 S and 4 S. The 7 to 8 S complex was present in all tissues, but the 4 S complex was detected only in liver, kidney, small intestine, and spleen. These results demonstrate the presence of similar [3H]-dexamethasone-binding components (receptors) in a variety of fetal and adult rabbit tissues. It is suggested that in addition to the liver and thymus, which are usually regarded as the target tissues for glucocorticoids, several other rabbit tissues may also be targets for these hormones."
https://openalex.org/W1514190739,"Abstract The steady state kinetics of glycerokinase from Candida mycoderma has been studied at pH 7.0 by initial velocity and product inhibition techniques and by dead-end inhibition by the inert coordination complex, chromium ATP. The mechanism appears to be Ordered Bi Bi with glycerol adding before the magnesium nucleotide and l-glycerol 3-phosphate being released last. With different nucleotides as substrates the dissociation constant for glycerol is constant, but the Kms of the nucleotides vary from 9 µm for MgATP to 2400 µm for MgXTP. In addition to glycerol (Km, 15 µm), dihydroxyacetone (Km, 5 mm) and l-glyceraldehyde (Km, 3.7 mm) are phosphorylated. d-Glyceraldehyde (Km, 0.5 mm) is not phosphorylated but incluces hydrolysis of MgATP. Glycerol is competitive versus l-glycerol 3-phosphate and noncompetitive versus MgADP. CrATP is competitive versus MgATP and is uncompetitive versus glycerol or MgADP. The dissociation constant of CrATP from the enzymeglycerol complex is 0.5 to 0.7 µm. In an ordered mechanism the sum of the vertical coordinates of the crossover points in initial velocity patterns for forward and reverse reactions, divided by the sum of reciprocal velocities in both directions, is a dimensionless number varying from 0 for a mechanism where second product release is solely rate limiting, to 1 for a rapid equilibrium ordered mechanism where catalysis and/or first product release is solely rate limiting. Where the two maximum velocities are not equal, this number indicates the rate-limiting step in the slower direction only. For glycerokinase this analysis and comparison of inhibition constants for CrATP versus MgATP and MgADP show that in the reverse direction, glycerol release is 2 to 5 times faster than catalysis and/or release of MgATP."

The molecular weight of the enzyme, which has been named triphosphate pyrophosphohydrolase, has been estimated at 17,000. It will not use any of the nucleoside triphosphates as substrate; it exhibits a Km value of 11 µm for dihydroneopterin triphosphate; and Mg2+ is required for activity.

https://openalex.org/W1602412389,"Abstract Succinate dehydrogenase in the deactivated form becomes activated on incubation at mildly acid pH to an extent dependent on the pH, type of anion present, and the concentration of the anion. The equilibrium level established under one set of conditions can be perturbed by changing either the pH or the anion concentration and the resulting level of activation reflects the new set of conditions. The rate of activation is influenced by the temperature, the anion concentration, and the pH when simple anions (e.g. Br-) are used, but the energy of activation is not affected by either pH or anion concentration. The value found for the activation energy (Ea) is 25 Cal per mole. In contrast, when activation of the enzyme is mediated by succinate, malonate, or reduced coenzyme Q10, the Ea value is 31 to 33 Cal per mole. Although this difference in energies of activation suggests that activation by mild acid and anions involves a different mechanism, no difference in the catalytic activity of preparations activated by these different methods is detected."

https://openalex.org/W1576775130,Abstract Specific binding of glucocorticoids was studied in the cytoplasmic extracts of mouse mammary tumors induced by mammary tumor virus. The binding protein satisfied all the general criteria of hormone receptors namely a specific high affinity for glucocorticoids (4 x 10-9 m for dexamethasone) and limited number of binding sites which were saturated with low hormone concentrations (1 x 10-8 m). It is suggested that the glucocorticoids may influence mammary tumor growth through the specific glucocorticoid receptors.

The rate-limiting reaction in the catalytic cycle at ascorbate saturation requires protonation of a negatively charged enzymic group with a pK′ near pH 8. Although citrate buffers are commonly used for assay of this enzyme, the univalent citrate anion is a competitive inhibitor with respect to ascorbate. Piperazine-N,N′-bis(2-ethanesulfonic acid) anions also inhibit competitively but EDTA has no effect except to prevent the nonenzymic oxidation of ascorbate. The maximal velocity of the isolated enzyme can be increased severalfold by treatment with excess ascorbate in the absence of oxygen. This activation process may involve generation of additional catalytically competent sites."

https://openalex.org/W1522550792,"Abstract The specificity of F1 histones from tumors was investigated with the following immunological probes: antisera elicited by each of the F1 subfractions obtained from rat thymus; antisera elicited by purified unfractionated rat hepatoma F1 histones; and antisera elicited by the COOH-terminal (N1) fragment of rat hepatoma F1 histones. The results indicate that F1 histones derived from tumors retain to a large extent the species and tissue specificity of the normal tissues. The species and tissue specificity was also observed with N1 fragments derived from the tumor F1 histones, suggesting that the COOH-terminal portions contain regions which vary from one molecular type to another. Comparison of the chromatographic elution profiles of F1 histone from rat liver and rat hepatoma revealed that one of the peaks in rat liver (Peak 4a) was either absent or present in very low amounts in rat hepatoma. With the exception of Peak 2, the respective peaks of rat liver and rat hepatoma were immunologically closely related."
https://openalex.org/W1523296167,"Abstract Rhodospirillum rubrum chromatophores depleted of photophosphorylation coupling factor lost more than 95% of their phosphorylation activity in every tested phosphorylating system including the endogenous as well as the N-methylphenazonium methosulfate-supported systems. Full restoration of photophosphorylation in all tested systems was obtained by preincubating depleted chromatophores in the presence of coupling factor and MgCl2. Removal of coupling factor did not affect light-induced oxygen uptake in the presence of ascorbate plus dichloroindophenol and light-induced quenching of atebrin fluorescence. Light-induced enhancement of the fluorescence of anilinonaphthalene sulfonic acid was decreased by 50% in depleted chromatophores, but this decrease was completely relieved by the addition of oligomycin. It is therefore concluded that the functional integrity of cyclic electron flow is preserved in depleted chromatophores and that the removed coupling factor is functioning specifically in the terminal step of ATP synthesis. Light-induced reduction of NAD+ was 90% inhibited by removal of coupling factor and addition of either oligomycin or coupling factor restored only 40% of the original activity. No further restoration could be obtained even in the presence of both oligomycin and coupling factor in amounts sufficient for complete reconstitution of photophosphorylation. These results seem to indicate that a component required exclusively for NAD+ reduction was removed together with the phosphorylation coupling factor."

https://openalex.org/W1591942412,"Abstract The complementation of fragments of staphylococcal nuclease to form an ordered structure was studied by stopped flow kinetic measurements. The increase in the intensity of tryptophan fluorescence of residue 140 on complementation was followed. The complementation of two fragments containing residues 6 to 48 and residues 49 to 149 (or 50 to 149) to form Nuclease-T' follows apparent first order kinetics, both with regard to variation of time and fragment concentration accessible to study. The first order rate constant of the formation of Nuclease-T' is in the range of 0.03 to 0.05 s-1, which is much less than that of refolding of acid-denatured intact nuclease observed by Schechter et al. (Schechter, A. N., Chen, R.F., and Anfinsen, C.B. (1970) Science 167, 886–887). The change of temperature from 5° to 45° caused only a small increase in the rate of formation of Nuclease-T'. The presence of the ligands, thymidine 3',5'-diphosphate and Ca2+, and the change of pH of the reaction mixture from 5 to 8 had no effect on the rate constant. The complementation between the fragments of residues 1 to 126 and of residues 99 to 149 and between the fragments of residues 1 to 126 and of residues 49 to 149 (or 50 to 149) also fits first order kinetics and shows rate constants equivalent to that of Nuclease-T'. Examination of the kinetic equation for the simplest model, in which specific prefolding of each fragment is required for the productive collision, and the collision is the rate-limiting step of the complementation, fails to explain these results. However, the results may be interpreted by assuming the rate-limiting step either to be the prefolding of one of the two fragments, which then combines with the other fragment, or the folding of a disordered intermediate complex formed by the two fragments."

https://openalex.org/W1580429984,"Abstract An orange crystalline copper(II) perchlorate complex of riboflavin, a possible model for enzymic metal-flavin interactions, has been prepared and characterized by x-ray techniques. The crystals are triclinic, with symmetry P1; unit cell constants are a = 7.701 (2) A (figures in parentheses following numerical values are standard deviations in the least significant digits cited), b = 11.230 (3) A, c = 17.336 (4) A, α = 101.85 (2)°, β = 96.41 (2)°, γ = 89.90 (2)°, Z = 1, ρobs = 1.70 g per cm3, ρcalc = 1.701 g per cm3 for 2 Cu-(CIO4)2·2C17H20N4O6·12H2O per unit cell. The crystal structure, refined by use of 3636 counter-measured reflections, gives an R factor of 7.9%. There are 2 independent riboflavin molecules and 2 independent Cu(II) ions in each cell. One riboflavin (RFa) is bound to both copper ions, to Cu(1) via O(4) and N(5) at distances of 2.00 (2) and 2.43 (2) A, and to Cu(2) via O(5'), O(4'), and O(2) with distances of 2.30 (2), 1.97 (2), and 2.49 (2) A. The other riboflavin (RFb) is bound to only one copper, Cu(1), via O(4) and N(5) with lengths 2.00 (2) and 2.39 (2) A. A water, H2O(3) is hydrogen-bonded to O(2) of RFb. These results confirm the existence of two separate chelate sites, N(1)-O(2) and O(4)-N(5), in the flavoquinoid system and offer further evidence that both these chelate sites will nearly always be occupied by positive ions or dipoles. Supporting an earlier prediction, both ribityl groups are in an approximate C(2')-C(5') extended planar conformation with O(2') pointing over the secondary chelate site in RFb. However, the copper in the secondary site of RFa alters the relationship of the chain to the ring skeleton, by producing an approximate 180° rotation about the N(10)-C(1') bond. This change permits O(4') to hydrogen bond with N(1), and O(4') and O(5') to coordinate to copper. Water molecules complete distorted octahedral coordination shells about both copper ions."
https://openalex.org/W1622564536,"Abstract A cyclic adenosine 3' : 5'-monophosphate (cyclic AMP)-independent protein kinase was purified 116-fold from cellfree extracts of Neurospora crassa mycelium. The molecular weight of the enzyme as determined by gel filtration was 60,000. The sedimentation coefficient by sucrose density gradient centrifugation was 3.8 S. The enzyme has a broad pH optimum (7.0 to 8.5). Activity was maximal at an ionic strength of 0.15. The Eact was 10.7 Cal. Kinetic studies have shown that the actual substrate for the reaction is the MgATP2- complex. Free ATP is inhibitory. The Km for MgATP2- at saturating casein is approximately 3 x 10-5 m. The Km for casein at saturating Mg-ATP2- is approximately 1.60 mg per ml. Phosvitin is the only other protein substrate tested that could replace casein. Co2+ and Mn2+ could partially substitute for Mg2+ in the reaction. Neither MgUTP2- nor MgGTP2- was a substrate. Both nucleotides were competitive inhibitors with respect to MgATP2-. Reciprocal plots of 1/v versus 1/[MgATP2-] at different fixed concentrations of casein and 1/v versus 1/[casein] at different fixed concentrations of MgATP2- were apparently parallel. However, product inhibition studies (MgADP-) and dead end inhibition studies (MgUTP2-, casein peptides) yielded results consistent with a random mechanism in which the binding of one substrate greatly decreases the affinity of the enzyme for the other substrate (Kma >> Kia, Kmb >> Kib, or in alternate terms, α >> 1)."

https://openalex.org/W1520729429,"Abstract The role of Ca2+ in adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH)-stimulated lipolysis in rat adipocytes was investigated using perifused fat cells. With this system, it is possible to monitor minute-to-minute changes in glycerol release from adipocytes during both the activation and inactivation phases of hormone-induced lipolysis. The lipolytic response to ACTH was dose-dependent and 0.1 unit per ml of ACTH produced the maximal lipolytic response. Unlike the response observed with other lipolytic polypeptide hormones and with catecholamines, cessation of ACTH infusion did not result in a return of lipolysis to the basal value, rather, maximal rates of lipolysis were maintained. During this period of maintained lipolytic response after the termination of ACTH administration, the infusion of EGTA (1 mm), or the perifusion with Ca2+-free buffer caused the lipolytic rate to return to basal value. When the lipolytic response was tested in Ca2+-free buffer, the maximal rate of ACTH-stimulated lipolysis was decreased 45% and the rate returned to the basal value after the termination of ACTH infusion. On the basis of the present findings it is speculated that a part of the ACTH-stimulated lipolysis in rat adipocytes may be Ca2+-independent and that Ca2+ exerts a role in the binding of ACTH to its membrane receptor."

https://openalex.org/W1506456422,"Abstract The kinetics of a heme-linked ionization of pK 5.5 in ferric carboxymethyl- and carboxamidomethyl-cytochrome c (alkcyt c) were followed by a series of pH jump experiments in a stopped flow apparatus. The results were consistent with a conformation change following deprotonation of a histidine residue. It is suggested that the heme-linked ionization leading to the formation of a low spin hemoprotein belongs to histidine-18, coordinating the heme iron of alk-cyt c. The extent of absorbance changes following pH jump from pH 4.0 decreased above pH 6.0. This finding was attributed to the coordination of a sixth ligand which increases the rate of the conformational change beyond the capabilities of the stopped-flow technique. A pK of 7.25 was estimated for this event. A similar pK was calculated from the pH dependence of the association constants of alk-cyt c with imidazole."

https://openalex.org/W2061571961,"DIENER1 and Zuckerman2 have recently speculated that hepatitis A and B, respectively, may be caused by infective naked nucleic acids or viroids. In response to their hypotheses, we felt it would be of interest to investigate the nature of an agent known to cause hepatitis in marmoset monkeys. We reasoned that if the aetiologic agent of hepatitis found in serum is a free, or naked, nucleic acid in this system, then its infectivity should be destroyed by the action of a specific endonuclease. For example, a free viral DNA would be rendered uninfective after treatment with pancreatic DNase. The virus used in our study was the ‘Barker’ agent, originally recovered by Deinhardt et al. from acute phase sera of marmosets inoculated with serum from a human case of viral hepatitis3. This virus consistently induces hepatitis in such animals, although its pedigree as a human hepatitis agent has been a subject of controversy4."
