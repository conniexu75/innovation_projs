https://openalex.org/W2053197667,In phytoplankton of the eastern tropical Pacific Ocean from 25 to 90 percent of the biomass (measured as chlorophyll a) and 20 to 80 percent of the inorganic carbon fixation were attributable to particles that could pass a screen with a 1-micrometer pore diameter. Evidence is presented that these are indeed autotrophic cells and not cell fragments.

Selectivity is categorized according to chemical reactivity (chemoselectivity), orientation (regioselectivity), and spatial arrangement (diastereoselectivity and enantioselectivity). Recent developments in reduction-oxidation methods and C-C bond forming reactions illustrate some solutions to problems of selectivity. The design of selectivity-inducing groups and the increased role of main group and transition metals in enhancing selectivity are especially noted."

More than 75 percent of the strontium in the vegetation is ultimately derived from atmospheric transport and less than 25 percent from the weathering of the underlying rock. Much of the airborne strontium enters the watersheds by impacting on coniferous foliage, but deciduous foliage apparently traps little, if any, strontium-bearing aerosol. The strontium and presumably other nutrients are continuously recycled in a nearly closed system consisting of upper soil horizons, forest litter, and the standing crop of vegetation."
https://openalex.org/W1975698432,"Penicillium digitatum mycelium can accumulate uranium from aqueous solutions of uranyl chloride. Azide present during the uptake tests does not inhibit the process. Killing the fungal biomass in boiling water or by treatment with alcohols, dimethyl sulfoxide, or potassium hydroxide increases the uptake capability to about 10,000 parts per million (dry weight). Formaldehyde killing does not enhance the uranium uptake. The inference that wall-binding sites were involved led to the testing of uranium uptake by chitin, cellulose, and cellulose derivatives in microcolumns. All were active, especially chitin."
https://openalex.org/W1988726604,"A model of the evolution and radiative effects of a debris cloud from a hypothesized impact event at the Cretaceous-Tertiary boundary suggests that the cloud could have reduced the amount of light at the earth's surface below that required for photosynthesis for several months and, for a somewhat shorter interval, even below that needed for many animals to see. For 6 months to 1 year, the surface would cool; the oceans would cool only a few degrees Celsius at most, but the continents might cool a maximum of 40 Kelvin. Extinctions in the ocean may have been caused primarily by the temporary cessation of photosynthesis, but those on land may have been primarily induced by a combination of lowered temperatures and reduced light."

https://openalex.org/W1975481103,Numerical experiments with an energy balance model of the earth's climate suggest an enhancement of albedo-temperature feedback caused by the presence of a high middle-latitude plateau in the zonally averaged Northern Hemisphere topography. The increased climate sensitivity arises from the increased rate of change of snow cover produced by the advance or retreat of the winter snow line over the north slope of this topographic feature.

https://openalex.org/W2066436858,Two important factors that contributed to Japan's economic success were government investment in industrial development and the early recognition that a good educational system is a prerequisite to technological progress. Government policies promoted the importation of technologies from Europe and North America and encouraged the education of students abroad. This facilitated the rapid development of Japanese industry and the adaptation of foreign technologies to local conditions. Many of the methods used to develop industry in Japan could be used to advantage in developing countries today.

https://openalex.org/W2060138844,"Executive Order 12356, signed by President Reagan on 2 April 1982, prescribes a system for classifying information on the basis of national security concerns. The order gives unprecedented authority to government officials to intrude at will in controlling academic research that depends on federal support. As such, it poses a serious threat to academic freedom and hence to scientific advances and the national security."
