https://openalex.org/W2043264912,"Cells lytically infected with simian virus 40 contain viral DNA in the form of very small chromlosomnes (minichromosomes) segmented into 100-A lengths, each segment containing about 200 base pairs of DNA. This form resembles that of eukaryotic chromnosom1es anid is consistent with the model of chromatin structure proposed recently."

https://openalex.org/W1964317701,"Sponges consume an order of magnitude more organic matter on Caribbean coral reefs than on the Great Barrier Reef. This rate of consumption is attributed to Caribbean sponge biomass being five to six times greater than that on the Great Barrier Reef, on average, and to the absence in the Caribbean of phototrophic sponges, which are a feature of clean water regions of the Great Barrier Reef. The long temporal and spatial separation of the Atlantic and Pacific oceans has resulted in the evolution of dissimilar sponge faunas, with Caribbean sponges being heterotrophic, whereas many Great Barrier Reef sponges rely on nutritional input from photosynthetic symbionts."
https://openalex.org/W2077893432,"The amount of water released on Mars in association with volcanism is estimated to equal a layer 46 meters deep over the entire planet. Most of this water was released in the first 2 billion years of martian history. The estimate is based on mapping the volcanic materials and by inferring the volatile content of the lavas. Water from other sources, such as plutonic activity and cometary contributions, is not included in the estimate."

These displacements were analyzed to determine the best-fitting rigid rotation, which could then be ascribed to true polar wander. The true polar wander so obtained is no larger than a few degrees and is within the magnitude of the uncertainties involved."

https://openalex.org/W1982021272,"Viscum fischeri has 2n = 23 chromosomes in male plants. These fornm 7 bivalents and a translocation chain of 9 chromosomes during meiosis. Pollen with 11-and 12-chromosome genomes is thus produced. Female plants have 2n = 22 chromosomes and produce 11 bivalents during meiosis. Sex determination is technically a rare multiple X-multiple Y type, but more importantly it provides the mechanism whereby permanent translocation heterozygosity is maintained in the system. In a second species, Viscum engleri, male plants have 2n=28 chromosomes associating as 11 bivalents and a ring of 6 chomosomes at meiosis."
https://openalex.org/W1964015447,Aggressive drilling for oil and gas in the lower 48 states of the United States over the past decade yielded reserve additions sufficient to arrest decline and to stabilize levels of production. Such positive response from a maturely explored and developed oil resource base was unpredicted and largely unanticipated. Two elements of the recent experience-maintenance of stable rates of finding and substantial levels of conventional reserve growth in older fields-indicate that the capability of the resource base to sustain production is yet considerable. The volume of domestic oil and gas production that is necessary in the national interest and the extent to which the resource base should be pursued are the central issues of public energy policy.

Electron microscopic observation revealed in several cells a dense precipitate of thallium iodide within the cisternae of the endoplasmic reticulum, which suggests that this membrane system is involved in intracellular ion transport."

Here are three current examples discussed at the meeting: gauging the output of the sun, measuring crustal movement, and deciphering the mineral composition of surface rocks."
