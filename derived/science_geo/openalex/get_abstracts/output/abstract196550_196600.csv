https://openalex.org/W2000329032,"THE common Norway rat is a wild, fierce, aggressive animal which fights with other rats or other animals, large or small, at apparently slight provocation. When captured and brought into the laboratory such rats show no diminution of their aggressive tendencies even after months or years of the comparative safety and ease of laboratory life. They escape at the slightest opportunity and are difficult to recapture. They must always be handled carefully and with heavy gloves to avoid serious injury."

However, no mention has been made of levan-producing Pseudomonas species isolated from other than diseased or killed plant material."

https://openalex.org/W1934772814,8 rhesus monkeys were given reserpine 1 mg/kg (maximal tranquilizing dose) daily except Sundays 5 monkeys for 8-19 days and 3 monkeys for 100 days or more. Observations were made of cycle length ovulation by rectal palpation histology of ovary and uterus and vaginal lavage. Except for the first menstruation expected after the summer anovulatory period menstruation was delayed 47-140 days in the 3 monkeys given chronic reserpine. In 2 monkeys given reserpine from Cycle days 8-18 ovulation was normal but in 3 treated on Days 2-10 or 12 ovulation was delayed at least until Day 23. Cycle length was 15-39 days in 94% of the colony.

Histopathological changes after prolonged exposure to carbon dioxide have been reported by Stephens2. They consisted mainly of swelling, chromatolysis and vacuolation of nerve cells."

https://openalex.org/W1965599513,"THE application of the principle of electrophoretic separation on paper to steroids is limited by their relatively low polarity, so that they do not readily migrate under the influence of an electric current, and also by their sparing solubility in aqueous media. By converting the steroids into derivatives with polar groupings, some separation has been achieved (Voigt and Beckmann1, 1953, using the hemisuccinates; McKinley2, 1955, using the mono- and di-phenylhydrazone derivatives). Our early experiments, begun before the publication of these authors' results, were along similar lines, and with somewhat similar results. It did not seem likely, however, that electro-phoretic separation would be so convenient a method as chromatography, which has been adapted by Lembart and Schneider3 for the separation on paper of mixtures of pure steroid conjugates. The natural occurrence of more polar steroid derivatives, the sulphates and glucuronides in urine, suggested to us that these might undergo electrophoretic separation on paper. Although the individual steroids could not be resolved, the two groups of conjugates were sharply separated."

Most of the work deals with glutamic acid decarboxylase of higher plants; so it was thought of interest to study the enzyme system in the case of dry seeds of legumes."

https://openalex.org/W1973696922,"DURING some work on a problem unrelated to the present communication, a microcalorimeter was developed based on the ‘Callendar Radio-balance’1. This calorimeter has been used for measuring the rate of heat production of unbuffered bull semen under anaerobic conditions, and although the calorimeter was not ideally suited to the work some results have been obtained which might be of interest to workers in the field of fertility."

https://openalex.org/W2070140443,IN their recent letter on this subject Gregory and Cane1 state that “perhaps other threshold and summation phenomena may be described in terms of statistical information available in neural information channels”. A survey of available data on there relationship between the Weber–Fechner fraction ΔI/I and stimulus area A certainly supports this contention2.
