However, the recent recognition that APP and Notch undergo highly similar proteolytic processing has suggested a potential signaling function for APP. After ligand binding, Notch is cleaved by the ADAM-17 metalloprotease followed by an intramembrane cleavage mediated by γ-secretase. The γ-secretase cut releases the Notch intracellular domain (NICD), which enters the nucleus and modulates transcription. Because APP is processed similarly by ADAM-17 and γ-secretase, we reasoned that the APP intracellular domain (AICD) has a role analogous to the NICD. We therefore generated a plasmid encoding the AICD sequence and studied the subcellular localization of the expressed protein (C60). Our results demonstrate that the cytoplasmic domain of APP is a highly labile fragment that is stabilized by forming complexes with Fe65 and can then enter the nucleus in neurons and non-neural cells. These findings strongly support the hypothesis that APP signals in the nucleus in a manner analogous to the function of Notch.

Physiol. Rev. 2001; 81: 741-766Crossref PubMed Scopus (5196) Google Scholar). The large ectodomain is first cleaved at one of three sites close to the membrane by either α- or β-secretase to liberate a soluble APP extracellular piece (termed α- or β-APPs). In doing so, α-secretase generates an 83-residue carboxyl-terminal fragment (CTF) C83, whereas β-secretase cuts at the other two sites to generate an 89- or 99-residue CTF (C89 and C99, respectively) (1Selkoe D.J. Physiol. Rev. 2001; 81: 741-766Crossref PubMed Scopus (5196) Google Scholar, 2Buxbaum J.D. Thinakaran G. Koliatsos V. O'Callahan J. Slunt H.H. Price D.L. Sisodia S.S. J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 9629-9637Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These 3 CTFs are retained in the membrane and become substrates for an unusual intramembrane cleavage mediated by γ-secretase, producing a heterogeneous set of products. The best characterized of these is the amyloid β-protein (Aβ) derived from C99, which accumulates to high abundance in senile plaques and appears to play a central role in the etiology of Alzheimer's disease (AD) (1Selkoe D.J. Physiol. Rev. 2001; 81: 741-766Crossref PubMed Scopus (5196) Google Scholar). Whereas the several Aβ species have been studied in great detail, the other products generated by γ-secretase have received scant attention. One fragment of particular interest is theAPP intracellular domain (AICD), the ∼6-kDa extreme C terminus of APP that results from the γ-secretase cleavage of the C83, C89, or C99 fragments. The potential importance of AICD has recently been emphasized by the recognition of similarities between APP and another type I transmembrane protein, Notch (3Wolfe M.S. Haass C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 5413-5416Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Notch is a cell surface receptor that plays a critical role in many cell fate decisions during embryogenesis and adulthood (4Artavanis-Tsakonas S. Rand M.D. Lake R.J. Science. 1999; 284: 770-776Crossref PubMed Scopus (4951) Google Scholar). Following binding to its prototypical ligand Delta, Notch undergoes two cleavages, the first of which is performed by the metalloprotease ADAM-17, also called tumor necrosis factor-α converting enzyme (5Brou C.

It is subsequently cut by the presenilin-dependent γ-secretase (7De Strooper B. Annaert W. Cupers P. Saftig P. Craessaerts K. Mumm J.S. Schroeter E.H. Scchrijvers V. Wolfe M.S. Ray W.J. Goate A. Kopan R. Nature. 1999; 398: 518-522Crossref PubMed Scopus (1808) Google Scholar), releasing theNotch intracellular domain (NICD), a fragment analogous to AICD. After release from the membrane, the NICD fragment associates with the cellular factor CSL (for CBF1,Suppressor of Hairless and Lag-1) and translocates into the nucleus, where it alters gene transcription (8Schroeter E.H. Kisslinger J.A. Kopan R. Nature. 1998; 393: 382-386Crossref PubMed Scopus (1365) Google Scholar). APP is the only other known protein that shares similar sequential processing by ADAM-10 (9Lammich S. Kojro E. Postina R. Gilbert S. Pfeiffer R. Jasionowski M. Haass C. Fahrenholz F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 3922-3927Crossref PubMed Scopus (986) Google Scholar) or ADAM-17 (10Buxbaum J.D. Liu K.N. Luo Y. Slack J.L. Stocking K.L. Peschon J.J. Johnson R.S. Castner B.J. Cerretti D.P. Black R.A.

Chem. 2001; 276: 5413-5416Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). The striking similarities between Notch and APP proteolysis therefore raise the intriguing possibility that APP is a cell surface receptor that also signals via release and translocation of AICD into the nucleus. In the absence of a defined functional assay for APP in vitro or in vivo, we reasoned that an analysis of exogenous AICD expression could provide insights into its potential role in transducing a signal from the cell surface. However, detection of free AICD in intact cells has been elusive, similar to the situation with NICD. Because the binding of the CSL protein to NICD stabilizes the latter (8Schroeter E.H. Kisslinger J.A. Kopan R. Nature. 1998; 393: 382-386Crossref PubMed Scopus (1365) Google Scholar), we hypothesized that an analogous mechanism might also apply for AICD. We therefore assessed whether a previously described protein, which binds to the APP cytoplasmic tail, Fe65, could stabilize AICD and allow nuclear translocation. Our results show that AICD complexes with and is stabilized by Fe65 in a manner analogous to the NICD and CSL proteins and that the complexes can enter the nucleus in both primary neurons and non-neural cells. A cDNA encoding an initiating methionine and the last 59 residues of the APP C terminus was amplified by polymerase chain reaction, inserted into pcDNA5 (Invitrogen), and confirmed by sequencing. Plasmids encoding wild-type human APP695 (11Selkoe D.J. Podlisny M.B. Joachim C.L. Vickers E.A. Lee G. Fritz L.C. Oltersdorf T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 7341-7345Crossref PubMed Scopus (543) Google Scholar) and human Fe65 with a Myc epitope (12Lau K.F. McLoughlin D.M. Standen C.L. Irving N.G. Miller C.C. Neuroreport. 2000; 11: 3607-3610Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar) have been characterized. For transfections, 10 µg of DNA was introduced into COS cells (95% confluent) or mouse primary neurons (18,000 cells/cm2) using LipofectAMINE 2000 (Life Technologies, Inc.) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Neurons were plated and maintained in neurobasal media supplemented with B27 (Life Technologies, Inc.) using standard methods (13Hartley D.M. Walsh D.M. Ye C.P. Diehl T. Vasquez S. Vassilev P.M. Teplow D.B. Selkoe D.J. J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 8876-8884Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Polyclonal antibodies C7 and X81 were described previously (Refs. 14Haass C. Schlossmacher M.G. Hung A.Y. Vigo-Pelfrey C. Mellon A. Ostaszewski B.L. Lieberburg I. Koo E.H. Schenk D. Teplow D.B. Selkoe D.J. Nature. 1992; 359: 322-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (1765) Google Scholar and 15Podlisny M.B.

Dis. 1997; 3: 325-337Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar, respectively). Monoclonal antibodies 13G8 and 8E5 were gifts of P. Seubert and D. Schenk and are directed against APP732–751 and APP500–648, respectively. Polyclonal antibody C4 is raised against APP722–751 and was a gift of Y. Ihara. Monoclonal antibodies 9E10 (which recognizes the c-Myc epitope) and histone H1 were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, and polyclonal tubulin antibody was from Sigma. De novo generation of Aβ and AICD was performed essentially as described (16Xia W. Ray W.J. Ostaszewski B.L. Rahmati T. Kimberly W.T. Wolfe M.S. Zhang J. Goate A.M. Selkoe D.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 9299-9304Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). The membrane pellet (microsomes) was resuspended in 50 mm Tris, pH 7.0, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA. The resuspended vesicles were incubated for 4 h at 37 °C, and the reaction stopped with Nonidet P-40 at a final concentration of 1%. Experiments were performed in 3 independent replicates. The nuclear fractionation of whole cells was performed as described (17Thomas J.E. Smith M. Rubinfeld B. Gutowski M. Beckmann R.P. Polakis P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 28630-28635Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Following Dounce homogenization, nuclei were pelleted at 800 × g and washed three times in wash buffer containing 0.1% Nonidet P-40. In the postnuclear supernatant, membranes were separated from cytosol with a 100,000 × g spin for 45 min. Cells were solubilized in 100 µl of an SDS lysis buffer containing 50 mm Tris, pH 7.6, 150 mm NaCl, 2 mmEDTA, 1% SDS, and Complete protease inhibitors (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Lysates were sonicated at 4 °C for three 5-s pulses and then diluted 1:9 with a detergent buffer identical to 1% SDS lysis buffer except that it contained 1% Nonidet P-40 instead of SDS. Some samples were lysed directly in 1% Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer. Lysates were precipitated with C7 (for APP, 1:200) or 9E10 (for Fe65, 1:100) and 50 µl of protein A-Sepharose (Sigma) or protein G-agarose (Roche) for more than 2 h at 4 °C. Following extensive washing, samples were eluted in 2× sample buffer (20% glycerol, 4% SDS, 10% β-mercaptoethanol) at 100 °C for 5 min, resolved by 10–20% Tris/Tricine SDS-PAGE (Bio-Rad), and transferred to 0.2 µm polyvinylidine difluoride (Bio-Rad). Western blotting using ECL Plus detection was performed according to the manufacturer's instructions (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). All experiments were repeated at least three times. Cells plated on 18-mm coverglass were fixed for 15 min in 4% paraformaldehyde and then blocked with 5% goat serum in phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.1% Triton X-100 for 1 h. Primary antibodies (C7, 1:2000; C4, 1:2000; 9E10, 1:1000) were diluted in the blocking buffer and incubated for 2 h. Following three 5-min washes with phosphate-buffered saline, secondary antibodies (goat anti-rabbit Cy3, 1:400; goat anti-mouse FITC, 1:200; Jackson ImmunoResearch) were incubated for 1 h at room temperature. Nuclei were stained with 1 µm DAPI for 30 min and mounted with SlowFade Light anti-fade reagent (Molecular Probes). Images were collected with an Axiovert 100M confocal scanning microscope and analyzed with LSM 510 software (Zeiss). The APP intracellular domain (AICD) corresponds to the cytoplasmic tail of APP that is released after cleavage of C83, C89, or C99 by γ-secretase (see Fig. 1a). In our search for the AICD fragment, we first attempted to generate it using a cell-free in vitro reaction. We had previously measured Aβ generation in microsome vesicles derived from Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells stably overexpressing APP751 (16Xia W. Ray W.J. Ostaszewski B.L. Rahmati T. Kimberly W.T. Wolfe M.S. Zhang J. Goate A.M. Selkoe D.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 9299-9304Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). We therefore probed for de novo generation of AICD by similarly incubating microsomes at 37 °C. After the incubation, the microsomal membranes were lysed, precipitated with the APP antiserum C7, and resolved by 10–20% Tris/Tricine SDS-PAGE. Identical preparations incubated in parallel were analyzed by a sensitive and specific sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay for Aβ, confirming thede novo production of Aβ (669 + 127 pg/ml (mean + S.D.) in 4 h; n = 3). In these same reactions, we observed the de novo production of a 6-kDa C-terminal fragment of APP that was present only after the 4-h incubation at 37 °C (Fig.1 b, lane 2). Importantly, production of this fragment was specifically inhibited by a well characterized peptidomimetic inhibitor of γ-secretase, compound 11 (18Wolfe M.S. Xia W. Moore C.L. Leatherwood D.D. Ostaszewski B. Rahmati T. Donkor I.O. Selkoe D.J. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 4720-4727Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1 b, lanes 3 and 4). Note that the Tris/Tricine gel resolves the three membrane-bound APP CTFs (C83, C89, and C99), which are more readily visible in a shorter exposure (Fig. 1 b, lane 5). We next constructed a plasmid encoding the C-terminal 59 amino acids of APP plus an initiating methionine (C60). The expressed protein corresponds to the APP sequence starting after the principal γ-secretase cleavage site, i.e. after position 40 of Aβ. We transiently expressed this construct in COS cells and sequentially lysed them in 1% Nonidet P-40 followed by 1% SDS. In control COS transfectants expressing full-length APP695, an 8-kDa C-terminal fragment corresponding to C83 was readily seen in the Nonidet P-40-soluble fraction, and only a small amount was found in the Nonidet P-40-insoluble/SDS-soluble fraction (Fig. 1 c,lanes 2 and 5). In the COS transfectants expressing C60, a faint ∼6-kDa band was visible in the Nonidet P-40-soluble fraction; however, the vast majority of the C60 protein was found in the Nonidet P-40-insoluble pellet (Fig. 1 c, compare lanes 3 and 6). Because SDS, but not Nonidet P-40, readily dissolves nuclei, we postulated that most of the C60 protein was associated with the nuclei of these cells. To establish the subcellular localization of the expressed C60 protein, we performed a nuclear fractionation technique described previously (17Thomas J.E. Smith M. Rubinfeld B. Gutowski M. Beckmann R.P. Polakis P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 28630-28635Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Following hypotonic swelling, we subjected the transfected COS cells to Dounce homogenization and pelleted their nuclei. After washing the nuclear pellets with 0.1% Nonidet P-40 to dissolve associated membranes, the nuclei were lysed in 1% SDS. The postnuclear supernatants were spun at 100,000 × g to separate membranes from cytosol. The localization of three protein markers confirmed the validity of the fractionation technique (Fig. 1 d). We therefore used this method to analyze the location of C60 in transfected COS cells by immunoprecipitation and Western blotting. First, endogenous APP CTFs, principally corresponding to C89 and C83, exclusively localized to the membrane fraction, as expected (Fig. 1 e, lanes 2,5, 8, and 11). This result confirmed that little or no membrane protein contaminated the nuclear fraction. In cells transfected with C60, a majority of the expressed protein was localized to the nucleus (Fig. 1 e, lane 10) with a small amount associating with the membrane fraction (lane 8). Because the CSL protein is known to stabilize the NICD fragment (8Schroeter E.H. Kisslinger J.A. Kopan R. Nature. 1998; 393: 382-386Crossref PubMed Scopus (1365) Google Scholar), we reasoned that one of the APP cytoplasmic binding partners might perform a similar function for APP. Although there are several proteins that are reported to bind to APP (19De Strooper B. Annaert W. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 1857-1870Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), we focused our efforts on Fe65 because it is a prototypical member of a family of genes that alters APP processing (20Sabo S.L. Lanier L.M. Ikin A.F. Khorkova O. Sahasrabudhe S. Greengard P. Buxbaum J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 7952-7957Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar, 21Guenette S.Y.

Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 6545-6550Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar), localizes to the nucleus (22Minopoli G. de Candia P. Bonetti A. Faraonio R. Zambrano N. Russo T. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 6545-6550Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar), and binds to the CP2 transcription factor (23Zambrano N. Minopoli G. de Candia P. Russo T. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 20128-20133Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). Indeed, when we co-transfected C60 with Fe65, we observed a marked increase in C60 levels in all three subcellular compartments (Fig. 1 e, lanes 11–13). Fe65 was found in the same three subcellular fractions (data not shown), in agreement with previously published observations (22Minopoli G. de Candia P. Bonetti A. Faraonio R. Zambrano N. Russo T. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 6545-6550Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). However, endogenous AICD was not detected when Fe65 was overexpressed alone (Fig. 1 e, lanes 5–7). In fact, even the transient co-expression of Fe65 with APP695 did not allow visualization of an AICD fragment (data not shown), suggesting that the latter is degraded with great efficiency and cannot be detected by this technique. To establish more directly the subcellular localization of C60, we used confocal immunofluorescent microscopy to visualize intact cells. When C60 was transfected alone, we were unable to identify any cells that displayed C7 fluorescence above the background level (Fig.2, m and n). Samples transfected in parallel and analyzed by immunoprecipitation-Western blotting confirmed successful expression of C60, suggesting that confocal microscopy is less sensitive than Western blotting. Because C60 expression alone yields far lower levels of the protein than does co-expression of C60 and Fe65 (see Fig.1 e), we co-transfected C60 with Fe65. We double-stained cells for the C terminus of APP and Fe65 followed by counterstaining with DAPI to visualize all nuclei. Under these conditions, specific immunoreactivity for C60 was localized primarily to the nucleus but was also present in the cytoplasm (Fig. 2, a–d). Furthermore, Fe65 was readily detectable (Fig. 2 b), and when this signal was merged with the C7 fluorescence, the two patterns overlapped to a great extent (Fig. 2 c). As further confirmation, this pattern was reproduced identically with a different C-terminal-specific APP antibody, C4 (Fig. 2,e–h). To control rigorously for the specificity of this staining, we preabsorbed C7 with its peptide immunogen, which eliminated the C7-specific immunofluorescence without affecting Fe65 detection (Fig.2, i–j). Additionally, when the C7 and Fe65 primary antibodies were omitted, we observed no appreciable fluorescence (Fig. 2, k and l). Finally, we confirmed that Fe65 subcellular localization is independent of C60 because it retained the same expression pattern in the presence or absence of C60 co-transfection (Fig. 2, compare b witho). We next assessed whether Fe65 can bind to the C60 fragment. Previous work demonstrated that Fe65 binds to the C terminus of full-length APP (24Zambrano N. Buxbaum J.D. Minopoli G. Fiore F. De Candia P. De Renzis S. Faraonio R. Sabo S. Cheetham J. Sudol M. Russo T. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 6399-6405Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). We therefore performed co-immunoprecipitations in COS cells expressing both C60 and Fe65. Immunoprecipitating Fe65 via its Myc tag and then Western blotting for APP with C7 revealed a 6-kDa band only when the two proteins were co-expressed (Fig.3a, compare lane 4with lanes 2 and 3). This was confirmed when the order of the antibodies was reversed; immunoprecipitating with an APP-specific antibody and Western blotting with an anti-Myc antibody yielded detectable Fe65 when the two proteins were co-expressed (Fig.3a, lane 7). Here, we also noticed faint co-immunoprecipitation of Fe65 when it was expressed alone (Fig.3 a, lane 6). Because the precipitating antibody (C7) also recognizes full-length endogenous APP, we interpreted this result to mean that a small amount of Fe65 co-precipitated with endogenous APP. In accord, we found that C7 equally precipitated endogenous APP holoprotein in all three transfection conditions (data not shown). Therefore, these co-immunoprecipitations confirm published evidence that Fe65 binds to APP and demonstrate that this interaction is maintained when just the C60 fragment is expressed. To address the effect of Fe65 on C60 stability, we performed quantitative pulse-chase analysis. COS cells were incubated with [35S]methionine for 10 min and chased in cold media for various times, followed by immunoprecipitation of C60. To accurately compare the differences in half-life, we used phosphorimaging quantitation followed by graphical analysis. Fig. 3 b shows the quantitative results from three independent experiments, depicting an exponential decrease in the level of C60 when expressed alone. A slower pattern of decay was observed with Fe65 co-transfection. We calculated its half-life to be ∼10 min when expressed alone but 188 min when Fe65 was also present. Furthermore, the latter curve reveals that a small fraction (∼20%) of the C60 protein is more stable (present at chase times >8 h) in the presence of Fe65. Although APP is expressed in many tissues in the adult, it is particularly enriched in neurons (1Selkoe D.J. Physiol. Rev. 2001; 81: 741-766Crossref PubMed Scopus (5196) Google Scholar, 25Simeone A. Duilio A. Fiore F. Acampora D. De Felice C. Faraonio R. Paolocci F. Cimino F. Russo T. Dev. Neurosci. 1994; 16: 53-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Fe65 is also predominantly expressed in the brain (26Duilio A. Zambrano N. Mogavero A.R. Ammendola R. Cimino F. Russo T. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 5269-5274Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar), suggesting that the physiological location and action of these two proteins resides in neurons. We therefore asked whether C60 protein was detectable when transfected into cultured primary neurons. We transfected the 3- or 4-day-old mouse neurons with C60 (with or without Fe65) and analyzed the lysates by immunoprecipitation and Western blotting (Fig. 3 c). The results were qualitatively similar to those seen with COS cells. Although the transfection of C60 alone resulted in undetectable C60 expression (Fig. 3 c, lane 4), co-transfection with Fe65 resulted in the appearance of a 6-kDa band (lane 5). The relative difference in the amount of C60 detected in COS cells and neurons is likely due to the relative transfection efficiencies in these two cell types. Therefore, as in COS cells, Fe65 co-expression stabilizes the otherwise rapidly degraded C60 protein. Because the C terminus of APP is known to be phosphorylated in neurons (2Buxbaum J.D. Thinakaran G. Koliatsos V. O'Callahan J. Slunt H.H. Price D.L. Sisodia S.S. J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 9629-9637Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), we also detected several endogenous CTF bands, corresponding to the predominant neuronal α- and β-secretase products, C83 and C89, in both their non-phosphorylated and phosphorylated forms (Fig.3 c, lanes 2–5). To establish the subcellular localization of C60 in neurons, we performed nuclear fractionation on the transfected neurons. As with the COS cells, we found endogenous APP C83 and C89 to be located exclusively in the membrane fraction, confirming the validity of our fractionation technique (Fig. 3 d, lane 2). Co-transfection of C60 and Fe65 and subsequent fractionation led to the detection of the ∼6-kDa C60 fragment in all three subcellular compartments (Fig. 3 d, lanes 2–4), in agreement with the COS results (Fig. 1 e, lanes 11–13), although we obtained relatively less nuclear C60 in the neurons. Having established the importance of Fe65, we next asked whether transient expression of this protein would aid the detection of endogenous AICD derived from full-length APP. To this end, we transiently transfected a CHO cell line that stably overexpresses APP751 with the V717I mutation (7PA2 cells) (27Podlisny M.B. Ostaszewski B.L. Squazzo S.L. Koo E.H. Rydel R.E. Teplow D.B. Selkoe D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 9564-9570Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (335) Google Scholar) with empty vector or Fe65. When vector was transfected, a very faint ∼6-kDa band was visible (Fig. 3 e, lane 2), which was stabilized by Fe65 transient overexpression (lane 3). Importantly, we obtained similar results when Fe65 was transfected into primary mouse neurons, which express endogenous levels of APP695 (Fig. 3 e, lanes 4 and5). In this study, we provide evidence that supports the hypothesis that the free APP intracellular domain (AICD) created by γ-secretase cleavage is markedly stabilized by and reaches the nucleus with the adaptor protein, Fe65. The potential importance of the Fe65-C60 complex that our co-precipitation experiments document in intact cells is highlighted by its striking similarity to CSL and NICD in Notch processing. Both APP and Notch are cleaved precisely 12 amino acids outside of the membrane by an α-secretase activity mediated by ADAM proteases. These scissions release the respective ectodomains, apparently allowing the membrane-retained, C-terminal fragments to be cleaved by γ-secretase. This intramembranous cleavage is highly unusual and is shared by few other proteins (28Brown M.S. Ye J. Rawson R.B. Goldstein J.L.

The highly labile NICD fragment then binds to the CSL protein and translocates into the nucleus where it regulates the transcription of downstream genes. The detection of NICD is improved by the co-expression of CSL (8Schroeter E.H. Kisslinger J.A. Kopan R. Nature. 1998; 393: 382-386Crossref PubMed Scopus (1365) Google Scholar). Our results indicate that C60 and Fe65 have an analogous relationship: C60 is highly labile and binds Fe65, which, like CSL, is present in the cytoplasm and nucleus. Furthermore, Fe65 markedly stabilizes and promotes nuclear translocation of C60 in a manner similar to CSL and NICD. Although our results support an important role for Fe65, other binding partners may also affect AICD production, stability, and/or location. Indeed, certain other binding partners, e.g.X11α, can alter APP metabolism when transiently overexpressed (29Mueller H.T. Borg J.P. Margolis B. Turner R.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 39302-39306Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). It is possible that a dynamic balance among several proteins capable of binding the cytoplasmic domain of APP may impact on its proteolytic fate and function. Our findings in this regard are consistent with recent evidence in cell transfection studies that the cytoplasmic domain of chimeric APP molecules can participate in Fe65-containing complexes, which drive transcription of heterologous reporter genes in the nucleus (30Cao X. Sudhof T. Science. 2001; 293: 115-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (1058) Google Scholar). Our demonstration that the free cytoplasmic domain generated by γ-secretase cleavage from full-length APP is detectable in cells after stabilization by Fe65 transfection supports the model proposed by Cao and Sudhof (30Cao X. Sudhof T. Science. 2001; 293: 115-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (1058) Google Scholar) that sequential α- and γ-secretase cleavages serve to release the cytoplasmic domain to signal in the nucleus. Taken together, the emerging data highlight a novel mechanism of APP function that could explain previously identified roles for cell-surface APP in neurite extension and growth (31Milward E.A.

In summary, our studies of the APP cytoplasmic domain are consistent with rapidly emerging evidence that a primary function of APP may be as a receptor that signals through cleavage and nuclear translocation of its cytoplasmic tail together with adaptor proteins that include Fe65. Such a mechanism shows striking analogy to that of the Notch receptor. These two proteins, along with a sterol regulatory element-binding protein, appear to define a new class of receptor molecules that may signal following regulated cleavage within their transmembrane domains.

https://openalex.org/W2075334642,"Eight major episodes of biological extinction of marine families over the past 250 million years stand significantly above local background (P < 0.05). These events are more pronounced when analyzed at the level of genus, and generic data exhibit additional apparent extinction events in the Aptian (Cretaceous) and Pliocene (Tertiary) Stages. Time-series analysis of these records strongly suggests a 26-million-year periodicity. This conclusion is robust even when adjusted for simultaneous testing of many trial periods. When the time series is limited to the four best-dated events (Cenomanian, Maestrichtian, upper Eocene, and middle Miocene), the hypothesis of randomness is also rejected for the 26-million-year period (P < 0.0002)."

Mass-balance calculations using a coupled model of the biogeochemical cycles of carbon, phosphorus, oxygen, and iron indicate that the redox dependence of phosphorus burial in the oceans provides a powerful forcing mechanism for balancing production and consumption of atmospheric oxygen over geologic time. The oxygen-phosphorus coupling further guards against runaway ocean anoxia. Phosphorus-mediated redox stabilization of the atmosphere and oceans may have been crucial to the radiation of higher life forms during the Phanerozoic."

They belong to the immunoglobulin superfamily, are homologues of the poliovirus receptor (PVR/CD155), and were also named poliovirus receptor-related (PRR) proteins. We identify a new member of the nectin family named nectin4. Peptide sequences of human and murine nectin4 share 92% identity, and as for other members, the ectodomain is made of three immunoglobulin-like domains of V, C, C types. In contrast to other nectin molecules, detection of nectin4 transcripts is mainly restricted to placenta in human tissues. Expression is broader in mouse, and interestingly nectin4 is detected at days 11, 15, and 17 during murine embryogenesis. Nectin4 interacts with afadin, a F-actin-associated molecule, via its carboxyl-terminal cytoplasmic sequence. Both molecules co-localize at cadherin-based adherens junctions in the MDCKII epithelial cell line. Nectins are homophilic adhesion molecules, and recently heterophilic interactions have been described between nectin3/nectin1 and nectin3/nectin2. We confirmed these trans-interactions and also described nectin3 as the PVR/CD155 ligand. By means of several approaches, we report on the identification of nectin4 as a new ligand for nectin1. First, a soluble chimeric recombinant nectin4 ectodomain (nectin4-Fc) trans-interacts with cells expressing nectin1 but not with cells expressing nectin2, nectin3, or PVR/CD155. Conversely, nectin1-Fc binds to cells expressing nectin4. Second, nectin1-Fc precipitates nectin4 expressed in COS cells. Third, reciprocal in vitro physical interactions were detected between nectin4-Fc and nectin1-Fc. The nectin4-Fc/nectin4-Fc interaction was detected suggesting that nectin4 exhibits both homophilic and heterophilic properties.

EMBO J. 1990; 9: 3217-3224Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar). The transmembrane isoforms are different in length and can be classed into two groups according to their carboxyl-terminal sequences. One group carries a conserved carboxyl-terminal motif ((A/E)XYV) that interacts with the PSD-95/Dlg/ZO-1 (PDZ) domain of the filamentous-actin (F-actin)-associated molecule called afadin (7Takahashi K. Nakanishi H. Miyahara M. Mandai K. Satoh K. Satoh A. Nishioka H. Aoki J. Nomoto A. Mizoguchi A. Takai Y. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 145: 539-549Crossref PubMed Scopus (438) Google Scholar). The other group does not carry this motif of interaction. Two different isoforms of afadin have been described: the long isoform (l-afadin), ubiquitously expressed, is associated with F-actin via a carboxyl-terminal region absent from the short isoform (s-afadin) (18Mandai K. Nakanishi H. Satoh A. Obaishi H. Wada M. Nishioka H. Itoh M. Mizoguchi A. Aoki T. Fujimoto T. Matsuda Y. Tsukita S. Takai Y. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 139: 517-528Crossref PubMed Scopus (392) Google Scholar). In turn, afadin interacts with molecular components of the tight junctions like ZO-1 (zonula occludens) and JAM (junctional adhesion molecule) (19Yamamoto T. Harada N. Kano K. Taya S. Canaani E. Matsuura Y. Mizoguchi A. Ide C. Kaibuchi K. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 139: 785-795Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar,20Ebnet K. Schulz C.U. Meyer Zu Brickwedde M.K. Pendl G.G. Vestweber D. J.

Afadin also interacts with specific components of adherens junctions (AJs) like nectins and ponsin (7Takahashi K. Nakanishi H. Miyahara M. Mandai K. Satoh K. Satoh A. Nishioka H. Aoki J. Nomoto A. Mizoguchi A. Takai Y. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 145: 539-549Crossref PubMed Scopus (438) Google Scholar, 21Mandai K. Nakanishi H. Satoh A. Takahashi K. Satoh K. Nishioka H. Mizoguchi A. Takai Y. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 144: 1001-1017Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). A recent report demonstrates that afadin associates with the actin cytoskeletal regulator profilin (22Boettner B. Govek E.E. Cross J. Van Aelst L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 9064-9069Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). Afadin has also been shown to interact with the activated Ras proteins involved in cell signal transduction and known to control cell proliferation (23Kuriyama M. Harada N. Kuroda S. Yamamoto T.

Altogether afadin acts as a “linker” between nectins and the cortical actin and depicts a prototype of a scaffold molecule that exerts a central role in the organization of junctional complexes and in the recruitment of signaling molecules.The function of nectin molecules is currently unknown. Recently mutations in the nectin1/PRR1 gene, leading to abnormal forms of the receptor, have been associated with cleft lip/palate-ectodermal dysplasia (25Suzuki K. Hu D. Bustos T. Zlotogora J. Richieri-Costa A. Helms J.A. Spritz R.A. Nat. Genet. 2000; 25: 427-430Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar). Nectin2−/− mice display male sterility due to morphologically aberrant spermatozoa (26Bouchard M.J. Dong Y. McDermott Jr., B.M. Lam D.H. Brown K.R. Shelanski M. Bellve A.R. Racaniello V.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 2865-2873Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). A key property of nectins is their ability to form cis- and trans-dimers through their ectodomains and thus mediate cell-to-cell adherence (3Lopez M. Aoubala M. Jordier F. Isnardon D. Gomez S. Dubreuil P. Blood. 1998; 92: 4602-4611Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 7Takahashi K. Nakanishi H. Miyahara M. Mandai K. Satoh K. Satoh A. Nishioka H. Aoki J. Nomoto A. Mizoguchi A. Takai Y. J.

Chem. 2000; 275: 10291-10299Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar). Indeed Ca2+-independent homophilic trans-interactions have been documented for nectin1, -2, and -3, and heterophilic trans-interactions have been proposed between nectin3 and nectin1 and between nectin3 and nectin2 in mouse (16Satoh-Horikawa K. Nakanishi H. Takahashi K. Miyahara M. Nishimura M. Tachibana K. Mizoguchi A. Takai Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 10291-10299Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar). Trans-interactions between nectins are dependent on cis-dimerization at the cell surface and may lead to the phosphorylation of cytoplasmic tyrosine residues (3Lopez M. Aoubala M. Jordier F. Isnardon D. Gomez S. Dubreuil P. Blood. 1998; 92: 4602-4611Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Thus the respective properties of nectins are probably not redundant. Nectins display different expression patterns, may interact or not with afadin, and most importantly may trans-heterointeract in a specific manner to regulate physiological processes through their respective cytoplasmic domains.In this report we describe a new member of the nectin family called nectin4. We show that nectin4 (i) is structurally related to the nectin family members; (ii) is expressed mainly in placenta in human tissues, presents a broader distribution in mouse tissues, and is expressed in mouse embryo; (iii) is a 66-kDa protein that co-localizes and interacts with the PDZ domain of afadin; (iv) recruits afadin at cadherin-based adherens junctions; (v) is a Ca2+-independent homophilic adhesion molecule; (vi) is a new ligand for nectin1 but not for nectin2, nectin3, and PVR/CD155; and (vii) binds nectin1 through the extracellular V domain interaction.DISCUSSIONNectins are a growing family of adhesion molecules that belong to the IgSF, that are involved in cell to cell adhesion processes, and that serve as receptors for herpes simplex virus entry. Here we describe a new member of this family, namely nectin4. We show that (i) nectin4 is structurally and functionally related to other nectins; (ii) the ectodomain is formed of three immunoglobulin like domains of V, C, C types; (iii) nectin4 is expressed mainly in placenta in human and in brain, lung, testis, and embryo in mouse; (iv) nectin4 interacts with afadin via its C-terminal cytoplasmic region; (v) nectin4 recruits and co-localizes with afadin at cadherin-based AJs; (vi) nectin4 forms cis-dimers at the cell surface and is a trans-homophilic adhesion molecule; (vii) nectin4 trans-heterointeracts with nectin1 and not with other nectins; and (viii) the region of nectin4/nectin1 and nectin3/nectin1 interactions resides in the V domain of nectin1. Nectin4 does not act as a receptor for alphaherpesviruses. 2G. Campadelli-Fiume, unpublished results. Based on sequence comparison in the nonredundant and expressed sequence tag databases we identified nectin4 and a genomic clone AL162592 that encompassed nectin4 exons. This genomic clone is localized in the 1q chromosomal region that may correspond to a region paralogous to the 3q (nectin3), 11q23 (nectin1), and 19q13 (nectin2 and PVR) chromosomal regions. Each of these regions includes paralogous genes belonging to the same family. These genes probably derive from a common ancestral region (32Ollendorff V. Mattei M. Fournier E. Adelaide J. Lopez M. Rosnet O. Birnbaum D. Int. J. Oncol. 1998; 13: 1159-1161PubMed Google Scholar). We cloned the murine nectin4 cDNA that is 92% identical to the human sequence. Interestingly we identified a murine genomic clone AC087229 that encompassed murine nectin4 exons and localized in the murine chromosome 1. This region is syntenic to the human chromosomal region 1q (33Rubin G.M. Yandell M.D. Wortman J.R. Gabor Miklos G.L. Nelson C.R. Hariharan I.K. Fortini M.E. Li P.W. Apweiler R. Fleischmann W.

Science. 2000; 287: 2204-2215Crossref PubMed Scopus (1360) Google Scholar) and strengthens the fact that these two genes are orthologous genes.A key property of some nectins resides in their ability to interact with afadin via a consensus C-terminal amino acid sequence ((A/E)XYV). Nectin4 interacts with the PDZ domain of the F-actin-associated molecule called afadin despite the absence of this sequence. Indeed the C-terminal amino acid sequence of nectin4 (IYINGRGHLV) does not fit with this sequence, but interaction with the PDZ domain of afadin is abolished by the terminal valine deletion, suggesting similar mechanisms of interaction as for other nectins. From Fig. 4, the new consensus sequence for nectins would be (K/R)XX(Y/L)V. Promiscuous interactions between PDZ domains and their target peptides have already been reported in other systems. The type II afadin PDZ domain is also very flexible and interacts with different carboxyl-terminal sequences present in some ephrin receptors, neurexin, Jagged, and JAM (20Ebnet K. Schulz C.U.

The precise subcellular localization of afadin in cell-cell junctional complexes was beyond the purpose of this study as we were interested in demonstrating nectin4/afadin interaction using MDCKII cells. In our experiments, afadin localization at cell-cell junctions is actually directed by nectin4 expression and confirms biochemical interaction studies. We noted that the localization at intercellular junctions was only seen between adjacent cells both of which expressed nectin4 probably via a homophilic mechanism as demonstrated in Fig. 9. Interestingly we demonstrate that nectin4 binds to nectin1 through ectodomain trans-interaction (Figs.Figure 7, Figure 8, Figure 9). The absence of nectin4 expression at intercellular junctions when only one cell expressed nectin4 is due to the undetectable expression of endogenous nectin1 in MDCKII cells (7Takahashi K. Nakanishi H. Miyahara M. Mandai K. Satoh K. Satoh A. Nishioka H. Aoki J. Nomoto A. Mizoguchi A. Takai Y. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 145: 539-549Crossref PubMed Scopus (438) Google Scholar). Moreover we failed to detect nectin4-Fc binding to MDCKII cells (data not shown). Trans-heterointeraction between nectin4 and nectin1 is specific as no interaction was detected between nectin4 and nectin2, nectin3, or PVR. Nectin4/nectin1 interaction is direct and does not involve other accessory molecules as nectin1 precipitates nectin4 and nectin4-Fc binds nectin1-Fc in an in vitro binding assay. In the course of identifying nectin4 binding partners, we demonstrated that human nectin1 trans-heterointeracts with human nectin3 as suggested by a previous report with the murine homologues (16Satoh-Horikawa K. Nakanishi H. Takahashi K. Miyahara M. Nishimura M. Tachibana K. Mizoguchi A. Takai Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 10291-10299Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar). These data point to a fundamental role of nectin trans-heterointeractions as they are preserved in human and rodent. Preliminary results showed that PVR trans-interacts with nectin3 but not with nectin1, nectin2, and nectin4. Altogether our results depicts a complex “nectin network” that probably contributes to the regulation of epithelial and endothelial physiology (Fig. 10). Interestingly natural soluble isoforms of PVR and nectin1 have been described and may also participate to this regulation (13Lopez M. Cocchi F. Avitabile E. Leclerc A. Adelaide J. Campadelli-Fiume G.

EMBO J. 1990; 9: 3217-3224Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar).We show here that nectin1 binds to both nectin4 and nectin3 through its V domain. The gD glycoprotein of HSV binds to the CC′C“ region of the nectin1 V domain, and the epitope recognized by the mAb R1.302 was recently mapped to the C′C”D regions of the nectin1 V domain (27Cocchi F. Menotti L. Dubreuil P. Lopez M. Campadelli-Fiume G. J. Virol. 2001; 75: 7987-7994Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). This mAb blocks gD and nectin4 binding to nectin1 suggesting that both interactions share common binding regions in the nectin1 V domain. Fine mapping is in progress to define and compare the regions of nectin1 involved in nectin4 and nectin3 binding and conversely to identify critical interacting regions in the other nectin members.Nectin4 expression is mainly restricted to endothelial cells in placenta and is expressed at embryonic days 11, 15, and 17 in mouse embryo. Previous reports have described the fundamental role of afadin in the organization of cell-cell junctions during mouse development (34Zhadanov A.B. Provance D.W. Speer C.A. Coffin J.D. Goss D.

Altogether these results point to a major role of nectin4 and possibly other nectins in embryogenesis. Nectin/poliovirus receptor-related (PRR)1 molecules are adhesion receptors that belong to the immunoglobulin superfamily. They were originally described as molecules homologous to the poliovirus receptor (PVR/CD155) and called PRR.

The transmembrane isoforms are different in length and can be classed into two groups according to their carboxyl-terminal sequences. One group carries a conserved carboxyl-terminal motif ((A/E)XYV) that interacts with the PSD-95/Dlg/ZO-1 (PDZ) domain of the filamentous-actin (F-actin)-associated molecule called afadin (7Takahashi K.

The other group does not carry this motif of interaction. Two different isoforms of afadin have been described: the long isoform (l-afadin), ubiquitously expressed, is associated with F-actin via a carboxyl-terminal region absent from the short isoform (s-afadin) (18Mandai K.

Well studied examples show an enrichment in the light isotope of carbon, 12C. This enrichment presumably reflects unusual circumstances in the deposition of these sedimentary rocks. It is suggested here that the isotopically-light carbonate results from early diagenetic oxidation by bacteria of substantial amounts of isotopically light organic carbon. The electron acceptor that permits oxidation in the absence of free oxygen is presumed to be iron(III) which may have been significantly more abundant in the initial chemical precipitate than in the post-diagenetic sedimentary rock."

Meanwhile, there are still significant knowledge gaps with regard to various aspects of regulation of the phospholipid biosynthetic pathway (1Daum G. Lees N.D. Bard M. Dickson R.

It is well established that the initial step of phospholipid biosynthesis involves the acylation of G-3-P1 at the sn-1 position by a G-3-P acyltransferase to form lysophosphatidic acid (LPA). LPA acyltransferase then catalyzes the acylation of LPA at the sn-2 position to generate phosphatidic acid (PA), which serves as a general precursor for all glycerophospholipids, including triacylglycerol in eukaryotes (5Dircks L. Sul H.S. Prog. Lipid Res. 1999; 38: 461-479Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 6Christiansen K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1978; 530: 78-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). In Escherichia coli, an integral membrane protein (plsB) is responsible for the G-3-P acyltransferase activity, and its corresponding gene has been identified (7Wilkison W.O. Bell R.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1348: 3-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). In eukaryotic cells, multiple isoforms of G-3-P acyltransferase are present and localized in different intracellular compartments (8Dircks L.K. Sul H.S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1348: 17-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 9Murata N. Tasaka Y. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1348: 10-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). The genes corresponding to the mammalian mitochondrial and plant plastidial G-3-P acyltransferases have been isolated and characterized in detail (8Dircks L.K. Sul H.S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1348: 17-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 9Murata N. Tasaka Y. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1348: 10-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). In contrast, the eukaryotic microsomal counterpart has so far remained elusive, mainly because of the difficulties encountered in the purification of these membrane proteins and reconstitution of functional enzymes. Bakers' yeast, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, is a convenient model organism for eukaryotic lipid studies because its glycerolipid biosynthetic pathway is very similar to a wide range of species including higher plants and mammals. More than a decade ago, Tillman and Bell reported mutants deficient in the activities of G-3-P acyltransferase in S. cerevisiae (10Tillman T.S. Bell R.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 9144-9149Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Subsequent biochemical characterizations of one such mutant, generally known as TTA1, have yielded many new insights into lipid metabolism. It is now widely accepted that the initial step of glycerolipid biosynthesis in yeast is mediated by a G-3-P/DHAP dual substrate acyltransferase (10Tillman T.S. Bell R.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 9144-9149Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar,12Athenstaedt K. Weys S. Paltauf F. Daum G. J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 1458-1463Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and that multiple isoforms of G-3-P acyltransferase are present in yeast (11Athenstaedt K. Daum G. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 7611-7616Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar, 12Athenstaedt K. Weys S. Paltauf F. Daum G. J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 1458-1463Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, the protein and the gene corresponding to the mutation have not been identified because of the lack of an apparent selectable growth phenotype in TTA1. Based on our general interest in eukaryotic fatty acyltransferases, we pursued the identification of G-3-P acyltransferase genes after examining some of the available information on yeast mutants related to phospholipid synthesis. When the CDP-DAG pathway is suppressed by inositol in the yeast mutant ise (13Yamashita S. Oshima A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1980; 104: 611-616Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar), the activity of choline transporter (CTR1) becomes essential for phospholipid biosynthesis through the CDP-choline pathway (14Nikawa J. Tsukagoshi Y. Yamashita S. J. Bacteriol. 1986; 166: 328-330Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 15Nikawa J. Hosaka K. Tsukagoshi Y. Yamashita S. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 15996-16003Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The ise ctr1 double mutant cannot grow on high inositol medium even in the presence of a choline supplement (14Nikawa J. Tsukagoshi Y. Yamashita S. J. Bacteriol. 1986; 166: 328-330Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Such a growth defect is apparently caused by a reduced synthesis of phosphatidylcholine (PC). It was subsequently reported that a choline transporter suppressor gene, SCT1, corresponding to ORF YBL011w (also annotated as YBL03.09), when expressed via a multicopy vector, could complement the cell growth defect, which resulted from the deficiency in choline transport in ise ctr1 (16Matsushita M. Nikawa J. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1995; 117: 447-451Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). However, SCT1 cannot suppress the growth defect of CTR1 null mutant, and overexpression of SCT1 did not appear to restore choline transport activity. It was suggested that Sct1p might stabilize the mutant form of the choline transporter (16Matsushita M. Nikawa J. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1995; 117: 447-451Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). However, one could also envisage Sct1p as being a positive factor involved in the biosynthetic pathway leading to PC synthesis. This would appear to be a plausible explanation if a small amount of choline is available, as this seems to be the case in ctr1. In the present study, we demonstrate that the choline transporter suppressor, Sct1p, encoded by YBL011w, and a closely related protein encoded by YKR067w, are two yeast sn-1 acyltransferases catalyzing both G-3-P and DHAP acylation. A point mutation in YKR067w results in a deficiency of the acyltransferase activities in the yeast mutant TTA1. As evident in the studies of other acyltransferases, identification of these two initial enzymes of the glycerolipid pathway is crucial for understanding the regulation of phospholipid biosynthesis in yeast and will, it is hoped, facilitate similar endeavors in other eukaryotes, including plants.

The TTA1 mutant (Matα,his3-X1, leu2–3, leu2–112,ura3–52, trp1–289) was kindly provided by Dr. Robert M. Bell (10Tillman T.S. Bell R.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 9144-9149Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Cells were cultured at 30 °C in YPD medium containing 1% Bacto-yeast extract, 2% Bacto-peptone, and 2% glucose (Sigma). Genomic DNA (150 ng) from TTA1 and its parental strain DBY746 was used, respectively, to amplify the coding regions of YBL011w and YKR067w genes. PCR amplification was performed in a 50-μl PCR reaction containing 0.2 mmdNTPs, 0.2 μm primers, and 2.5 units of PfuDNA polymerase (Stratagene). The primers used for the amplification of YBL011w and YKR076w were 5′-ATGCCTGCACCAAAACTCACGGAG-3′ and 5′-CTACGCATCTCCTTCTTTCCCTTC-3′, and 5′-ATGTCTGCTCCCGCTGCCGATCAT-3′ and 5′-TCATTCTTTCTTTTCGTGTTCTCT-3′, respectively. The PCR program employed was as follows: initial dwell time of 2 min at 94 °C, then 32 cycles of denaturation at 94 °C for 30 s, annealing at 60 °C for 30 s, and extension at 72 °C for 3 min, followed by extension at 72 °C for 7 min. The amplified DNA fragments were cloned into pCR2.1-TOPO vector (Invitrogen) following the addition of a single 3′-deoxyadenosine through Taq DNA polymerase treatment, and fully sequenced using an automated DNA sequencer (Applied Biosystems 373). Two pairs of primers, 5′-GGATCCAACATGTCTGCTCCCGCTGCCGATCAT-3′ and 5′-CTCGAGTCATTCTTTCTTTTCGTGTTCTCT-3′ for GAT1and the gat1 allele from TTA1, and 5′-GGATCCAACATGCCTGCACCAAAACTCACGGAG-3′ and 5′-CTCGAGCTACGCATCTCCTTCTTTCCCTTC-3′ for GAT2gene, were designed to include BamHI and XhoI restriction sites (underlined). The amplified DNA fragments were first cloned into vector pCR2.1-TOPO (Invitrogen). The orientation of the insert was determined by restriction enzyme digestion. Plasmids containing GAT1, gat1, and GAT2 were designated as GAT1/pCR2.1-TOPO, gat1/pCR2.1-TOPO, and GAT2/pCR2.1-TOPO, respectively. To construct bacterial expression vectors, the coding regions of GAT1, gat1, and GAT2 were recovered by digestion of GAT1/pCR2. 1-TOPO, gat1/pCR2.1-TOPO, and GAT2/pCR2.1-TOPO with BamHI. Purified DNA fragments were inserted into pQE60 (Qiagen) and then transformed into E. coli DH5α. Prior to transforming the resulting plasmids GAT1/pQE60, gat1/pQE60, and GAT2/pQE60 into BB26–36 (17Bell R.M. J. Bacteriol. 1974; 117: 1065-1076Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), correct orientation and in-frame fusion of the inserts were confirmed by sequencing. To construct yeast expression vectors, coding regions of GAT1 and GAT2 genes were excised from GAT1/pCR2.1-TOPO and GAT2/pCR2.1-TOPO through digestion with BamHI and XhoI and inserted into vector pYES2 (Invitrogen). The integrity of the constructs,GAT1/pYES2 and GAT2/pYES2, was verified by sequencing. Transformation of pYES2 and the recombinant pYES2 plasmids into gat1Δ strain was performed using lithium acetate according to the standard protocol (18Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D.

Single colonies containing plasmids GAT1/pQE60,gat1/pQE60, and GAT2/pQE60 were cultured in 2 ml of LB medium supplemented with 0.4% glucose, 0.1% glycerol, and 60 μg/ml ampicillin. After incubation at 37 °C for 6 h, the cultures were transferred to 50 ml of fresh medium and allowed to grow until the cell density reached an A600 = 0.1. Isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside was then added to a final concentration of 0.1 mm, and the cells were grown at 28 °C for an additional 12 h to induce protein expression. Cells were harvested by centrifugation at 5000 × g for 5 min, washed with 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, and resuspended in lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1 mmEDTA, 1 mm DTT, 10% glycerol). After treatment with 100 μg/ml lysozyme (Sigma) for 30 min on ice, the suspension was sonicated six times on ice with a 15-s burst. The lysate was spun at 2000 × g for 5 min to pellet cell debris, and the supernatant was used for enzyme assays. Expression of the proteins was confirmed through SDS-PAGE. To overexpress GAT1 and GAT2 in yeast, single colonies carrying pYES2 (plasmid-only control) or GAT1/pYES2 and GAT2/pYES2 were inoculated in 10 ml of SD-uracil medium with 2% glucose. After incubation at 30 °C for 30 h, the cells were harvested by centrifugation at 1500 × g for 5 min, and resuspended in SD-uracil medium with 1% raffinose and 2% galactose (SD induction medium). The cells were then diluted with 50 ml of SD induction medium to obtain a cell density of A600 = 0.6. After incubation at 30 °C for 7 h to induce the protein expression, the cells were harvested by centrifugation at 1500 × g for 5 min. For preparation of the yeast homogenates, the cell pellets were washed with 10 volumes of distilled H2O and then immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at −80 °C until use. Yeast homogenates were prepared with glass beads according to standard method (18Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1994: 13.0.1-13.13.9Google Scholar). Yeast lysate in buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm DTT, 10% glycerol) was spun at 2500 × g, 4 °C for 5 min to pellet large cell debris, and the supernatant was used directly for enzyme assays. Protein concentration was determined using Bio-Rad Dc protein assay regents and bovine serum albumin as a standard. G-3-P acyltransferase activity was assayed at room temperature for 10 min in a 200-μl reaction mixture containing 400 μm [14C]glycerol 3-phosphate (2.5 nCi/nmol), 45 μm palmitoyl-CoA, 75 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mm DTT, and 2 mmMgCl2. The reaction mixture was stopped by extracting the mixture with 3 ml of chloroform-methanol (1:2, v/v) in the presence of 600 μl of 1% HClO4. After a repeated extraction with another 1 ml of chloroform and 1 ml of 1% HClO4, the lower organic phase of the Bligh and Dyer extract (19Bligh E.G. Dyer W.J. Can. J. Biochem. Physiol. 1959; 37: 911-917Crossref PubMed Scopus (43133) Google Scholar) was washed three times with 2 ml of 1% HClO4. An aliquot of the chloroform phase containing the glycerolipid fraction was dried under nitrogen and subjected to scintillation counting for radioactivity. Results shown are the means ± S.E. from at least three independent assays. To confirm the reaction products, the lipid extracts were subjected to TLC in a solvent system of chloroform/methanol/acetic acid/5% aqueous sodium bisulfite (100:40:12:4). The RF values for LPA and PA were 0.33 and 0.90, respectively (20Hajra A.K. Burke C. J. Neurochem. 1978; 31: 125-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). DHAP acyltransferase activity was measured essentially as described by Bates and Saggerson (21Bates E.J. Saggerson E.D. Biochem. J. 1979; 182: 751-762Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar) with minor modifications. The reaction was terminated by the addition of 0.8 ml 1% HClO4, followed by extraction with 3 ml of chloroform-methanol (1:2, v/v) and 1 ml of chloroform. The lower phase of the Bligh and Dyer extract was washed three times with 2 ml of 1% HClO4, and the radioactivity measured through scintillation counting. The products were separated by TLC with the above solvent systems. The RF value of 1-acyl-DHAP in this system was 0.20 (20Hajra A.K. Burke C. J. Neurochem. 1978; 31: 125-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Yeast cell cultures at late logarithmic phase were disrupted with glass beads. Total lipids were extracted using the procedure of Folch et al. (22Folch J.M. Lees M. Sloane-Stanley G.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1957; 226: 497-509Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Separation of the phospholipids was performed with two-dimensional TLC on Silica Gel-60 plates and developed in solvent systems as described (23Morash S.C. MacMaster C.R. Hjelmstad R.H. Bell R.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 28769-28776Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Phospholipids were visualized with iodine vapor through a nitrogen stream, scraped off the TLC plates, and transmethylated directly with methanolic-HCl. Fatty acid methyl esters derived from each of the lipid species were analyzed and quantified by gas chromatography. From these data the mole percentages of the analyzed phospholipids were calculated for each lipid. Plasmid GAT1/pCR 2.1-TOPO was digested with AccIII and PinAI to delete a fragment corresponding to a region between nucleotides 459 and 1678 in GAT1. A linker sequence with AccIII, SmaI, and PinAI sites was used to link the remaining fragments of the GAT1 gene. The yeast URA3 gene was then inserted into the SmaI site of the linker to generate a GAT1 knockout vector. The DNA fragment containing the whole yeast URA3 gene flanked by two partial GAT1 sequences was amplified using the vector as a template with primers located at 5′ and 3′ ends of the GAT1coding region (5′-ATGTCTGCTCCCGCTGCCGATCAT-3′ and 5′-TCATTCTTTCTTTTCGTGTTCTCT-3′). The same amount of the purified PCR product (3 μg) was used to transform the diploid gat2(sct1)Δ/gat2(sct1)Δ strain and the haploid gat2[sct1]Δ strain, respectively. More than 300 transformants were obtained from diploid knockout experiments. The transformants were successively plated onto the uracil-dropout selective medium, and the stable transformants bearing one disrupted GAT1 and one undisrupted GAT1 were identified by PCR and restriction analysis of the PCR products. Several repeated experiments with the haploid gat2(sct1)Δ strain did not result in any viable gat1Δgat2(sct1)Δ colonies. Sporulation and tetrad analysis were performed according to standard protocol (18Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1994: 13.0.1-13.13.9Google Scholar). Previous studies have shown that SCT1 gene is constitutively expressed in yeast. Its encoded product is most likely a membrane protein, as it was predicted to contain a cluster of three potential membrane-spanning domains (16Matsushita M. Nikawa J. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1995; 117: 447-451Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Our sequence analysis revealed that Sct1p encoded by YBL011w and a protein encoded by YKR067w, which displays 31% sequence identity to Sct1p, contained segments with similarities to conserved domains of known acyltransferases (24Lewin T.M. Wang P. Coleman R.A. Biochem. J. 1999; 38: 5764-5771Crossref Scopus (233) Google Scholar). A portion of their deduced amino acid sequences is aligned with those of the membrane-bound G-3-P acyltransferases from E. coli and the mitochondrial G-3-P acyltransferase from Rattus norvegicus as shown in Fig.1 A. Two short segments from YBL011wp and YKR067wp resemble the conserved motifs III and IV, respectively, of G-3-P acyltransferases (24Lewin T.M. Wang P. Coleman R.A. Biochem. J. 1999; 38: 5764-5771Crossref Scopus (233) Google Scholar). The region corresponding to motif III is accentuated by a stretch of 6 amino acids (IFPEGG) that is conserved in YBL011wp and YKR067wp. The structural similarity between the yeast proteins and other known membrane based G-3-P acyltransferases can be further inferred by hydropathy plot predictions as shown in Fig. 1 B. Based on these analyses, we hypothesized that YBL011wp and YKR067wp are candidates for the so far elusive membrane-bound sn-1 fatty acyltransferase. The above observations led us to investigate if disruption of the open reading frames YBL011wand YKR067w would affect G-3-P acyltransferase activity in yeast. Haploid strains with targeted disruption in YBL011w(EUROSCARF accession no. Y13037) and YKR067w (EUROSCARF accession no. Y15983) were acquired from the collection of deletion strains at EUROSCARF. Neither strain displayed any abnormal growth phenotype when examined on solid or in liquid media. Nor was there any apparent sensitivity to temperature or inositol found upon the disruption of the respective open reading frames. Previously, it was shown that a dramatic reduction of G-3-P acyltransferase-specific activity could be easily detected even when a total homogenate of the yeast strain TTA1 was directly used for enzyme assays (12Athenstaedt K. Weys S. Paltauf F. Daum G. J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 1458-1463Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We thus decided to examine the effect of the gene disruptions on G-3-P acyltransferase activities employing total yeast homogenate prepared after a brief spin at 2500 × g. As shown in Fig.2, G-3-P acyltransferase activity was clearly reduced in both gene disruption strains. The total G-3-P acyltransferase activity in the YBL011w disruption strain was reduced by one third in comparison to the parental strain. Disruption of YKR067w, on the other hand, had a more striking effect, leaving a residual enzyme activity at about one eighth of the control (Fig. 2). Under our assay conditions, the level of residual enzyme activity in the YKR067w gene disruption strain is very close to the G-3-P acyltransferase activity for strain TTA1 (data not shown), even though they are derived from somewhat different genetic backgrounds. To further investigate the implications of these initial results, we examined if the mutation leading to the deficiencies in G-3-P acyltransferase and DHAP acyltransferase activities in the mutant TTA1 occurred in either YBL011w or YKR067w (10Tillman T.S. Bell R.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 9144-9149Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The coding regions of the two genes were amplified by PfuDNA polymerase-based PCR using genomic DNA isolated from TTA1 and its parental strain DBY746. Several nucleotide polymorphic differences were found in both genes between the S. cerevisiae strains. The sequences of YBL011w and YKR067w from DBY746 were deposited into the EMBL data base under the accession of AJ314608 andAJ311354, respectively. Direct sequencing of the purified PCR products and subsequent sequencing of the PCR fragment cloned into a vector plasmid demonstrated that there was no nucleotide sequence change in YBL011w between TTA1 and DBY746. On the other hand, analysis of YKR067w revealed the presence of one nucleotide change from G to A at position 785 in the mutant TTA1, which is predicted to result in the substitution of aspartic acid for glycine at amino acid position 262 of the encoded protein. Significantly, this amino acid substitution occurred in the segment exhibiting high similarity to the conserved motif III of acyltransferases (24Lewin T.M. Wang P. Coleman R.A. Biochem. J. 1999; 38: 5764-5771Crossref Scopus (233) Google Scholar). This result indicates that the deficiency of acyltransferase activity in TTA1 is attributed to this missense mutation, and thereby suggested that YKR067w encodes for a G-3-P acyltransferase. The residual G-3-P acyltransferase activity in TTA1 is comparable with that of the YKR067w knockout strain, suggesting that the mutation in TTA1, even in the form of a single amino acid change, completely abolished the activity of this enzyme. This result is in agreement with previous observations of the E. coli G-3-P acyltransferase, where a change in the amino acid sequence in the conserved domain III from YFVEGGRSRTGR to YFVELGRSRTGR completely eliminated the enzyme activity (24Lewin T.M. Wang P. Coleman R.A. Biochem. J. 1999; 38: 5764-5771Crossref Scopus (233) Google Scholar). Our results further support the functional importance of these conserved sequence domains in fatty acyltransferases. Previously it has been demonstrated that the defect in TTA1 affected mainly the acyltransferase activities of the lipid particle preparations. It thus can be inferred that YKR067wp is the lipid particle G-3-P acyltransferase. In accordance with the nomenclature proposed by Athenstaedt and Daum and co-workers (12Athenstaedt K. Weys S. Paltauf F. Daum G. J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 1458-1463Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), we named YKR067wp as Gat1p. The protein Sct1p encoded by YBL011w, which has structural properties of a membrane protein (16Matsushita M. Nikawa J. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1995; 117: 447-451Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar), should be localized in other cytoplasmic membrane compartments. Therefore, we designated it herein as Gat2p. The genes corresponding to YKR067w and YBL011w were named GAT1 and GAT2, respectively. Reconstitution of purified acyltransferases for enzyme activity has often proven to be inefficient. In an attempt to establish a direct enzyme-protein relationship, GAT1 and GAT2(SCT1) as well as the gat1 allele from TTA1 were inserted into expression vector pQE60 (Qiagen), and introduced into E. coli (plsB) strain BB26–36 (17Bell R.M. J. Bacteriol. 1974; 117: 1065-1076Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). BB26–36 has a mutation in plsB that gives rise to a G-3-P acyltransferase with altered properties, particularly, a lower specific activity (25Lightner V.A. Larson T.J. Tailleur P. Kantor G.D. Raetz C.R.H. Bell R.M. Modrich P. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 9413-9420Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 26Heath R.J. Rock C.O. J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 1944-1946Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This strain had been used as a convenient host to express G-3-P acyltransferase genes for enzyme property assessment (24Lewin T.M. Wang P. Coleman R.A. Biochem. J. 1999; 38: 5764-5771Crossref Scopus (233) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 3, G-3-P acyltransferase activity in this plsB mutant expressing GAT1 was more than 6 times higher than that of the control. In contrast, expression of gat1 in the plsBmutant showed no enzyme activities beyond the control. E. coli strain BB26–36 has a G-3-P auxotrophic phenotype as a result of a marked increase in the apparent Km of the G-3-P acyltransferase for G-3-P (17Bell R.M. J. Bacteriol. 1974; 117: 1065-1076Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 24Lewin T.M. Wang P. Coleman R.A. Biochem. J. 1999; 38: 5764-5771Crossref Scopus (233) Google Scholar, 26Heath R.J. Rock C.O. J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 1944-1946Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, expression of the GAT1 using both pQE60 and pET28a vectors in strain BB26–36 failed to complement this defect. In addition, expression of the GAT2(SCT1) appeared to be extremely deleteri"

We have used surface plasmon resonance to analyze the kinetic and thermodynamic properties of the interactions between the ectodomains of human low affinity FcγRs (FcγRIIa, FcγRIIb, and FcγRIIIb-NA2) and IgG1 or the Fc fragment of IgG1. All three receptors bind Fc or IgG with similarly low affinities (KD ∼0.6–2.5 μm) and fast kinetics, suggesting that FcγR-mediated recognition of aggregated IgG and IgG-coated particles or cells is mechanistically similar to cell-cell recognition. Interestingly, the Fc receptors exhibit distinct thermodynamic properties. Whereas the binding of the FcγRIIa and FcγRIIb to Fc is driven by favorable entropic and enthalpic changes, the binding of FcγRIII is characterized by highly unfavorable entropic changes. Although the structural bases for these differences remain to be determined, they suggest that the molecular events coupled to the binding differ among the low affinity FcγRs.

Fcγ receptor soluble Fcγ receptor killer cell Ig-like receptor T cell receptor inhibitory receptor superfamily natural killer major histocompatibility complex surface plasmon resonance nitriloacetic acid bovine serum albumin Fcγ receptors (FcγRs)1 are membrane glycoproteins that are expressed on all immunologically active cells. They bind the Fc portion of the main serum immunoglobulin IgG, and this binding triggers a wide range of events. These include the activation of B cells, endocytosis of antibody/antigen (immune) complexes, phagocytosis of antibody-coated particles or cells, and antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxity (1Fridman W.H. Bonnerot C. Daeron M. Amigorena S. Teillaud J.L. Sautes C. Immunol. Rev. 1992; 125: 49-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). Upon aggregation of FcγRs (e.g. by ligation of aggregated IgG or IgG-coated particles or cells) their cytoplasmic domains are phosphorylated by tyrosine kinases, which recruit SH2-domain-containing cytoplasmic signaling molecules. FcγRs can also appear as soluble molecules (sFcγRs) in serum and other body fluids. Although sFcγRs may be involved in immunological disorders, their role in normal immune responses is questionable. Nevertheless, these soluble receptor forms may be useful as a prognostic and staging tool in diseases such as systemic lupus erythematosus (2Hutin P. Lamour A. Pennec Y.L. Soubrane C. Dien G. Khayat D. Youinou P. Int. Arch. Allergy Immunol. 1994; 103: 23-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar), rheumatoid arthritis (3Fleit H.B. Kobasiuk C.D. Daly C. Furie R. Levy P.C. Webster R.O. Blood. 1992; 79: 2721-2728Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), multiple myeloma (4Mathiot C. Teillaud J.L. Elmalek M. Mosseri V. Euller-Ziegler L. Daragon A. Grosbois B. Michaux J.L. Facon T.

It is notable that several viruses, including human immunodeficiency virus (6Homsy J. Meyer M. Tateno M. Clarkson S. Levy J.A. Science. 1989; 244: 1357-1360Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar), dengue (7Littaua R. Kurane I. Ennis F.A. J. Immunol. 1990; 144: 3183-3186PubMed Google Scholar), measles (8Ravanel K. Castelle C. Defrance T. Wild T.F. Charron D. Lotteau V. Rabourdin-Combe C. J. Exp. Med. 1997; 186: 269-278Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar) and Ebola (9Yang Z. Delgado R. Xu L. Todd R.F. Nabel E.G. Sanchez A. Nabel G.J. Science. 1998; 279: 1034-1037Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar), employ FcγR to the disadvantage of the host, e.g. by antibody-mediated enhancement of infection (10Tortorella D. Gewurz B.E. Furman M.H. Schust D.J. Ploegh H.L. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2000; 18: 861-926Crossref PubMed Scopus (708) Google Scholar), underlining the central role of these receptors in the immune response. FcγRs belong to the immunoglobulin (Ig) superfamily and have been subdivided into three classes. FcγRI (CD64) has a high affinity for IgG (Kd ≈10−8m) and has three Ig-like domains in the extracellular region. In contrast, FcγRII (CD32) and FcγRIII (CD16) have lower affinities (Kd ≈10−6m) and only two extracellular Ig-like domains. There are three FcγRII genes (A, B, and C) and two FcγRIII genes (A and B), the products of which show distinct patterns of expression. The ectodomains of FcγRIIb and FcγRIIc are identical but distinct from FcγRIIa. FcγRIIIa and FcγRIIIb have a transmembrane and a glycosylphosphatidylinositol anchor, respectively, as well as 6 amino acid differences in their ectodomains. FcγRIIIb exists as the two alleles NA1 and NA2, which vary in their extracellular domains at three amino acid positions, resulting in two more potential N-glycosylation sites for the NA2 form. Although all low affinity IgG receptors bind to aggregated IgG or IgG-coated cells or particles, their different membrane anchors and cytoplasmic portions confer distinct functional properties. Low affinity IgG receptors that transduce activating signals typically either have immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motifs in their cytoplasmic domains (FcγRIIa or FcγRIIc) or, as with FcγRIIIa, are associated with molecules possessing immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motifs. In contrast, the receptor that transduces inhibitory signals (FcγRIIb) has an immunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhibitory motif in its cytoplasmic domain, much like the killer cell Ig-like receptors (KIRs) identified on natural killer (NK) cells. Finally, FcγRs bind with different affinities to the various IgG subclasses, a property that may allow a fine tuning of the immune response (11van de Winkel J.G. Capel P.J. Immunol. Today. 1993; 14: 215-221Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (631) Google Scholar). Crystal structures have been solved for the low affinity IgG receptors FcγRIIa (12Maxwell K.F. Powell M.S. Hulett M.D. Barton P.A. McKenzie I.F. Garrett T.P. Hogarth P.M. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1999; 6: 437-442Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar), FcγRIIb (13Sondermann P. Huber R. Jacob U. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 1095-1103Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and FcγRIII (14Sondermann P. Huber R. Oosthuizen V. Jacob U. Nature. 2000; 406: 267-273Crossref PubMed Scopus (601) Google Scholar), as well as the high affinity IgE receptor FcεRIα (15Garman S.C. Kinet J.P. Jardetzky T.S. Cell. 1998; 95: 951-961Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). As might be expected from their sequence similarity, these structures are very similar. One notable feature is that the Ig domains in these receptors are structurally related to Ig domains in KIRs (16Fan Q.R. Mosyak L. Winter C.C. Wagtmann N. Long E.O. Wiley D.C. Nature. 1997; 389: 96-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar, 17Snyder G.A. Brooks A.G. Sun P.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 3864-3869Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar, 18Maenaka K. Juji T. Stuart D.I. Jones E.Y. Structure. 1999; 7: 391-398Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar) (Fig.1 A), which also have a unique topology intermediate between the I-set and C2-set Ig domains (Fig. 1 B), as also pointed out by Dennis et al. (19Dennis G. Kubagawa H. Cooper M.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 13245-13250Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Although sequence similarity between the Fc receptors and KIRs is not high, this structural similarity suggests that they share a common ancestral receptor. A second similarity is the acute angle between the long axes of the membrane-distal and membrane-proximal domains (Fig. 1 A). Nevertheless there are notable differences. First, the arrangement between the two domains differs substantially (Fig.1 A). Second, the recent solution of the structure of the crystallized complexes KIR2DL2/HLA-Cw3 (20Boyington J.C. Motyka S.A. Schuck P. Brooks A.G. Sun P.D. Nature. 2000; 405: 537-543Crossref PubMed Scopus (344) Google Scholar) and FcγRIIIb/Fc (14Sondermann P. Huber R. Oosthuizen V. Jacob U. Nature. 2000; 406: 267-273Crossref PubMed Scopus (601) Google Scholar) reveals distinct ligand binding sites. While the KIR molecule uses loop residues from both of its Ig-like domains to bind the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I molecule, the FcγR only uses loop and strand residues from domain 2 and the interdomain linker for interacting with IgG. Despite recent advances in understanding the structural basis of FcγR/Fc binding, the basic thermodynamic and kinetic properties of these interactions are not well characterized. These data could help address several important questions in relation to FcγR function including the requirements for, and mechanism of, triggering through low affinity FcγRs, the mechanism of detachment of FcγR-bearing cells from immune complexes or IgG-coated cells or particles, and the requirement for significant molecular rearrangements upon binding. Here we report the kinetic and thermodynamic characteristics of IgG and Fc binding to soluble forms of all human low affinity FcγRs (FcγRIIa, FcγRIIb, and FcγRIII). The extracellular regions of the FcγR receptors, FcγRIIa, FcγRIIb, FcγRIIb-His6 (FcγRIIb with a C-terminal hexahistidine tag), and FcγRIIIb-NA2, all having two Ig-like domains, were expressed in Escherichia coli as inclusion bodies, refolded, and purified by hIgG affinity chromatography and gel filtration, as described (21Sondermann P. Jacob U. Biol. Chem. 1999; 380: 717-721Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar), resulting in sFcγRs. The purified sFcγRs are monomeric and specifically bind to human IgG (22Sondermann P. Jacob U. Kutscher C. Frey J. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 8469-8477Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Human IgG1 (hIgG1, kindly provided by R. E. Schmidt and T. Witte) was obtained by plasmapheresis from a myeloma patient, and its Fc fragment (hFc1) was produced by plasmin digestion. Both proteins were purified by standard methods, including protein A and size-exclusion chromatography. SPR experiments were performed using a BIAcore™ 2000 (BIAcore AB, St. Albans, United Kingdom). All experiments were performed with HBS-EP (10 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 3.4 mm EDTA, and 0.005% surfactant P20) as running buffer using CM5 sensor chips and HBS-P (no EDTA) when using nickel-charged nitriloacetic acid (Ni2+-NTA) sensor chips (BIAcore AB). Direct coupling of human IgG1 (hIgG1), human Fc1 (hFc1), or mouse IgG2a (mIgG2a) on CM5 sensor chips (BIAcore AB) was performed using the standard amine coupling kit (BIAcore AB). For coupling hIgG1, hFc1 and mIgG2a were injected at 5 μg·ml−1 in 10 mmsodium acetate, pH 5.5. FcγRIIb-His6 was immobilized onto, and eluted from, a Ni2+-NTA sensor chip (BIAcore AB) using the protocol recommended by BIAcore AB. All affinity, kinetic, and thermodynamic parameters were measured as described previously (23Maenaka K. Juji T. Nakayama T. Wyer J.R. Gao G.F. Maenaka T. Zaccai N.R. Kikuchi A. Yabe T. Tokunaga K.

Briefly, affinity constants were derived by Scatchard analysis and nonlinear curve fitting of the Langmuir binding isotherm to the data. Kinetic constants were derived using the curve-fitting facility of the BIAevaluation program (version 3.0, BIAcore). Equations derived from the simple 1:1 Langmuir binding model (A + B ↔ AB) were used. Other curve fitting was performed in Origin (MicroCal, version 3). Thermodynamic data were obtained by fitting the affinity data obtained at several temperatures to the nonlinear form of the van't Hoff equation (24Yoo S.H. Lewis M.S.

Soluble forms of FcγRs (sFcγRIIa, sFcγRIIb, sFcγRIIb-His6, and sFcγRIII) were expressed in E. coli and refolded in vitro (see “Experimental Procedures”). Affinity chromatography with the native ligand hIgG1 bound to the matrix indicated that the proteins were biologically active. sFcγRIIa (25Sondermann P. Kaiser P. Jacob U. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 309: 737-749Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar), sFcγRIIb (13Sondermann P. Huber R. Jacob U. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 1095-1103Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and sFcγRIII (14Sondermann P. Huber R. Oosthuizen V. Jacob U. Nature. 2000; 406: 267-273Crossref PubMed Scopus (601) Google Scholar) were used successfully for x-ray crystallographic structure determinations, indicating that they are uniformly and correctly folded. All sFcγRs migrated as monomers on nonreducing SDS-polyacrylamide gels and size-exclusion columns (data not shown). Binding of FcγR constructs was analyzed on a BIAcore instrument by surface plasmon resonance, which measures the changes in refractive index near a sensor surface (26Karlsson R. Falt A. J. Immunol. Methods. 1997; 200: 121-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (497) Google Scholar). Each sFcγR was injected (Fig.2 A, solid bar) simultaneously through four flow cells containing sensor surfaces to which human IgG1 (hIgG1), its Fc fragment (hFc1), mouse IgG2a (mIgG2a), or bovine serum albumin (BSA) had been directly immobilized via primary amines. A “background” response (measured in response units) is seen in the negative control BSA flow cell, which is a consequence of the high concentration, and therefore high refractive index, of injected sFcγR samples. However, a greater response was seen with injection over hIgG1, hFc1, and mIgG2a, indicating specific binding (Fig. 2). The affinity of sFcγRs binding to IgG and Fc was measured by equilibrium binding analysis on the BIAcore. A range of concentrations of sFcγRs were injected through flow cells with immobilized human IgG1, its Fc fragment, or BSA as a control. The binding response at each concentration was calculated by subtracting the equilibrium response measured in the control flow cell from the response in each flow cell. Conventional (Fig. 3) and Scatchard (Fig. 3, inset) plots of these binding data indicate that the interaction conforms to a simple 1:1 Langmuir binding model (see “Discussion”). The results of several experiments are summarized in Table I. All sFcγRs showed similar affinity constants (Kd = 0.6–1.7 μm) measured at 25 °C (298.15 K). A similar affinity was measured in the reverse orientation, using hFc1 in solution and sFcγRIIb-His6 immobilized to a Ni2+-NTA sensor chip via its C-terminal hexahistidine tag (Table I). The affinity of sFcγRIIa for hIgG1, hFc1 fragment, and mIgG2a is slightly higher than that of sFcγRIIb and sFcγRIII. For all sFcγRs, the affinity toward hIgG1 was quite similar to that of its Fc fragment, indicating that Fab fragment does not contribute to sFcγR binding. Although sFcγRIIa and IIb bind with similar affinity to mIgG2a, sFcγRIII bound with a much lower affinity in this experiment, as reported previously by Chesla et al. (27Chesla S.E. Li P. Nagarajan S. Selvaraj P. Zhu C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 10235-10246Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar), indicating that the ligand specificity of sFcγRIII is different from that of sFcγRIIa and IIb.Table ISummary of affinity constantsImmobilizedKd at 25 °CsFcγRIIasFcγRIIbsFcγRIIIμmhIgG10.69 ± 0.021.67 ± 0.031.57 ± 0.05hFc10.56 ± 0.021.40 ± 0.031.42 ± 0.05mIgG2a0.80 ± 0.041.37 ± 0.02ND1-aAffinity too weak for exact determination.ImmobilizedKd at 25 °ChIG1hFc1μmsFcγRIIb-His62.52 ± 0.181.57 ± 0.301-a Affinity too weak for exact determination. Open table in a new tab All sFcγRs bound their ligands with typical association and fast dissociation kinetics similar to those of other receptor/ligand interactions (Table IV). Association and dissociation rate constants were obtained by direct nonlinear curve fitting to data obtained by SPR, as illustrated for sFcγRIIb and sFcγRIII binding to the Fc fragment of hIgG1 (Fig.4). Global fitting of mono-exponential rate equations derived from the simple 1:1 Langmuir binding model produced reasonable fits to the data (Fig. 4), yielding the rate constants shown in Table II. The rate constants did not change significantly when the level of immobilized IgG and Fc varied 2-fold (Table II), indicating that binding was not substantially affected by mass transport or rebinding artifacts. The excellent agreement between the kinetically derivedKd (Table II) and the Kd determined by equilibrium binding (Table I) is further evidence that these kinetic rate constants are correct. Furthermore, similar rate constants were measured in the reverse orientation, with sFcγRIIb-His immobilized and Fc fragment in solution (Table II). The confirmation of both affinity (Table I) and kinetic measurements in both orientations indicates that binding is not substantially influenced by the coupling method and that the affinity and kinetic measurements are unlikely to be influenced by the presence of multivalent aggregates or errors in determination of active protein concentrations.Table IVSummary of affinity and kinetic data for lymphocyte cell-cell recognition moleculesInteractionkonkoffKdReferencesm−1 s−1s−1μmsFcγRIIa/hFc1∼440,0000.310.72This studysFcγRIIb/hFc1∼430,0000.962.4This studysFcγRIII/hFc1∼380,0000.691.9This studyKIR2D/HLA-C∼200,0001.2–25–1023, 43sFcαR/Fc∼26,8000.0281.038Wines B.D.

Immunity. 1999; 10: 357-365Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar), we measured the temperature dependence of the sFcγR/hFc1 interactions. Arrhenius plots yielded an activation energy for dissociation of 7–16 kcal·mol−1for the measured sFcγR/hFc1 interaction (data not shown). These values are comparable with that obtained for sKIR2DL3/HLA-Cw7-DS11 dissociation (13 kcal·mol−1) (23Maenaka K. Juji T. Nakayama T. Wyer J.R. Gao G.F. Maenaka T. Zaccai N.R. Kikuchi A. Yabe T.

The enthalpy change (ΔH) that accompanies FcγR binding to IgG or Fc was estimated by van't Hoff analysis, which involves measuring the dependence of affinity on temperature (Fig. 5). Because the enthalpic (ΔHvH) and entropic (TΔS) changes vary with temperature the nonlinear form of the van't Hoff equation was used (see “Experimental Procedures”). For sFcγRIIa and IIb, favorable enthalpic (ΔHvH ∼ −5.3 to −6.4 kcal·m−1) and entropic (−TΔS° ∼ −1.9 to −2.7 kcal·m−1) changes contribute to the binding energy (ΔG° ∼ −7.9 to −8.5 kcal·m−1) at 25 °C. In contrast, for sFcγRIII/IgG or sFcγRIII/Fc interactions, large unfavorable entropic changes (−TΔS° ∼ 6.9–7.4 kcal·m−1) were compensated by even larger favorable enthalpic changes (ΔHvH ∼ −14.9 to −15.4 kcal·m−1) (TableIII). Thus despite having a similar binding affinity and similar kinetics, the sFcγRIII/Fc interaction has very different thermodynamic characteristics. The FcγRs also differ with respect to the heat capacity (ΔCp ). This is derived from the nonlinear van't Hoff fit and is a measure of the dependence of the enthalpic and entropic changes on temperature. ΔCp for the sFcγRIII/Fc interaction is at the low end of the range of values (42Stites W.E. Chem. Rev. 1997; 97: 1233-1250Crossref PubMed Scopus (434) Google Scholar) measured for other protein/protein interactions (−0.333 ± 0.2 kcal·mol−1·K−1), whereas the ΔCp values measured for sFcγRIIa and sFcγRIIb are in the middle of the range (Table III).Table IIISummary of thermodynamic dataInteractionΔH−TΔSΔCpΔGkcal · mol−1kcal · mol−1kcal · mol−1 K−1kcal · mol−1sFcγRIIa/hFc1−5.8 ± 0.14−2.7 ± 0.14−0.43 ± 0.016−8.5 ± 0.28sFcγRIIa/hIgG1−6.4 ± 0.16−2.0 ± 0.16−0.41 ± 0.019−8.4 ± 0.32sFcγRIIa/mIgG2a−5.0 ± 0.12−3.3 ± 0.12−0.28 ± 0.014−8.3 ± 0.24sFcγRIIb/hFc1−5.3 ± 0.27−2.6 ± 0.27−0.23 ± 0.031−7.9 ± 0.54sFcγRIIb/hIgG1−6.0 ± 0.34−1.9 ± 0.39−0.28 ± 0.040−7.9 ± 0.73sFcγRIIb/mIgG2a−4.4 ± 0.28−3.6 ± 0.28−0.22 ± 0.033−8.0 ± 0.54sFcγRIII/hFc1−15.4 ± 0.587.4 ± 0.58−0.70 ± 0.068−8.0 ± 1.16sFcγRIII/hIgG1−14.9 ± 0.566.9 ± 0.56−0.66 ± 0.066−8.0 ± 1.12 Open table in a new tab In this paper we report the use of SPR to measure the kinetic and thermodynamic properties of interactions between the low affinity FcγRs and IgG or Fc. Although some of these properties have been measured before, no previous study has undertaken a comprehensive kinetic and thermodynamic analysis of sFcγR/ligand interactions. All three sFcγRs bound with similar affinities (Kd ∼ 0.6–2.5 μm). These were at the high affinity end of the range of values reported for other interactions that mediate cell-cell recognition (Table IV). Our results agree well with affinities measured independently using SPR (Kd = 1.2–2.1 μm for sFcγRIIa/hIgG1 (Ref. 29Wines B.D. Powell M.S. Parren P.W. Barnes N. Hogarth P.M. J.

This consistency between independent studies using different techniques suggests that these affinity measurements are correct. All three FcγRs bound to Fc or IgG with typical association rate constants (kon = 130,000–540,000m−1·s−1) and dissociated with fast dissociation rate constants (koff > 0.3 s−1). This indicates that interactions between monomeric IgG and the low affinity FcγRs are relatively unstable, and that only multivalent interactions will persist, providing an explanation for the specificity of the low affinity FcγRs for aggregated or cell-associated IgG. Fast dissociation rate constants facilitate the reversal of multivalent FcγR/IgG interactions where this is necessary. This may be important in situations where FcγR-enhanced activity is inhibited because of the engagement of the inhibitory FcγRIIb on respective cells. In common with many leukocyte receptors, signal transduction by engaged FcγRs involves tyrosine phosphorylation of their cytoplasmic tails and recruitment of SH2-domain containing signaling molecules. The additional similarity revealed here between FcγRs and other cell surface recognition molecules with respect to their ligand-binding properties (Table IV) suggests that this first step of the signaling mechanisms is conserved. Despite similarities in binding affinities and kinetics, thermodynamic analysis unexpectedly revealed major differences between FcγRII (a and b) and FcγRIII. Binding by sFcγRIIa and sFcγRIIb was characterized by favorable entropic and enthalpic changes, which is typical of protein/protein interactions including cell-surface receptor/ligand interactions (Fig.5 B). In contrast, sFcγRIII binding was accompanied by large, unfavorable entropic changes compensated for by even larger favorable enthalpic changes (Fig. 5). Large, unfavorable entropic changes have been reported for TCR/peptide-MHC (28Willcox B.E. Gao G.F. Wyer J.R. Ladbury J.E. Bell J.I. Jakobsen B.K. van der Merwe P.A.

Major causes of unfavorable entropic changes upon binding are a reduction in conformational flexibility upon binding or the trapping of water molecules at the binding interface. For gp120/CD4 and TCR/peptide-MHC interactions, binding was also characterized by slow kon values and (for TCR/peptide-MHC) strongly temperature-dependent kinetics, consistent with a requirement for conformational adjustments, which need some time to fit and reach the proper binding state.

Nucleoside diphosphates would probably have been synthesized along with the standard nucleotides under prebiotic conditions. For these reasons, the template-directed reactions of activated derivatives of these diphosphates, alone or mixed with activated nucleotides, were investigated. An activated derivative of deoxyguanosine 3′,5′-diphosphate condensed efficiently on a polycytidylate template to give oligonucleotide analogues in which each 3′,5′-phosphodiester bond was replaced by a pyrophosphate linkage. Oligomers were formed even in the absence of a template, but much more slowly. Template-directed condensation occurred also with an analogous deoxyadenosine derivative on polyuridylic acid and with an analogous acycloguanosine derivative on polycytidylic acid."

Recent biochemical measurements establish that Gt activation by rhodopsin occurs about 100 times faster than the activation of other G proteins (5Leskov I.B. Klenchin V.A. Handy J.W. Whitlock G.G.

Two properties are believed to be responsible for this rapid rate of Gtactivation: 1) the high concentration of Gt on the surface of the rod outer segment disc membrane and 2) the low degree of acyl chain packing order in the disc membrane, resulting from the high levels of phospholipid acyl chain polyunsaturation (5Leskov I.B. Klenchin V.A. Handy J.W. Whitlock G.G. Govardovskii V.I. Bownds M.D. Lamb T.D. Pugh E.N. Arshavsky V.Y. Neuron. 2000; 27: 525-537Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). Recent experiments with whole rod cells from transgenic mice that expressed half the normal amount of rhodopsin establish that the rate of phototransduction in the rod cell is determined by protein diffusion in the disc membrane (6Calvert P.D. Govardovskii V.I. Krasnoperova N. Anderson R.E. Lem J. Makino C.L. Nature. 2001; 411: 90-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). Within a few milliseconds of photon absorption, a metastable equilibrium is established between two conformational states of photoexcited rhodopsin, MI and MII (7Mathews R. Hubbard R. Brown P. Wald G. J. Gen. Physiol. 1963; 47: 215-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (432) Google Scholar). MII is the conformation of photoisomerized rhodopsin that binds and activates Gt(8Kibelbek J. Mitchell D.C.

Gt is bound to the membrane by a combination of electrostatic forces (11Seitz H.R. Heck M. Hofmann K.P. Alt T. Pellaud J. Seelig A. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 7950-7960Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar) and hydrophobic forces associated with a farnesyl group on the γ subunit of Gt (12Matsuda T. Takao T. Shimonishi Y.

Chem. 1994; 269: 21399-21402Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The binding interaction between rhodopsin and Gt has been examined in some detail (for reviews, see Refs. 14Hargrave P.A. Hamm H.E. Hofmann K.P. Bioessays. 1993; 15: 43-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar and 15Bourne H.R. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 134-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (530) Google Scholar). Binding of Gt by MII catalyzes the exchange of GDP for GTP, and the visual “signal” is carried from rhodopsin to the effector enzyme, a cGMP-specific phosphodiesterase. The activated phosphodiesterase catalyzes the hydrolysis of cGMP, which triggers the closure of cGMP gated Na+/Ca2+ channels leading to the hyperpolarization of the rod outer segment (ROS) plasma membrane and the visual response. In the absence of GTP, the MII-Gtcomplex is stable and has the same absorption spectrum as unbound MII. In the outer segment of the human rod cell there are about 10 rhodopsin molecules for every Gt molecule. However, during normal physiological function, only ∼1 rhodopsin of every 100,000 is photoisomerized and active at any one time. Consequently, the rate of MII-Gt complex formation is governed by a two-dimensional, diffusion-controlled search in the plane of the disc membrane of Gt for photoactivated rhodopsin, in its MII conformational state (6Calvert P.D. Govardovskii V.I. Krasnoperova N. Anderson R.E. Lem J. Makino C.L. Nature. 2001; 411: 90-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). Previous studies in this laboratory (16Litman B.J. Mitchell D.C. Lipids. 1996; 31 (suppl.): S193-S197Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and others (17Brown M.F. Chem. Phys. Lipids. 1994; 73: 159-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (373) Google Scholar, 18O'Brien D.F. Costa L.F. Ott R.A. Biochemistry. 1977; 16: 1295-1303Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar) demonstrate that the equilibrium concentration of MII is increased by the presence of phospholipids with one or more 22:6n-3 acyl chains. An important aspect of visual signal transduction is rapid response, and studies on rhesus monkeys show that electroretinagram b-wave implicit times (19Neuringer M. Connor W.E. Lin D.S. Barstad L. Luck S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 4021-4025Crossref PubMed Scopus (763) Google Scholar) and a-wave implicit times 2B. G. Jeffrey, D. C. Mitchell, M. Neuringer, and R. A. Gibson, submitted for publication. are delayed inn-3-deficient animals. Studies on human infants show that light-adapted oscillatory potentials are delayed in infants fed standard infant formula without 22:6n-3 relative to infants fed 22:6n-3-supplemented formula (20Birch D.G. Birch E.E. Hoffman D.R. Uauy R.D. Invest. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 1992; 33: 2365-2376PubMed Google Scholar). The present study was undertaken to determine the effects of 22:6n-3 and cholesterol on the kinetics of the first two steps in visual signal transduction, which are the formation of MII and the binding of Gt to MII. The latter process represents the first stage in signal amplification in the visual transduction pathway. Phospholipids 18:0,18:1PC and 18:0,22:6PC were purchased from Avanti Polar Lipids Inc. (Alabaster, AL), and their purity was ascertained by high performance liquid chromatography. Cholesterol was purchased from Calbiochem (La Jolla, CA). All preparation of phospholipids was carried out in an argon-filled glove box and in thoroughly degassed buffers because of the susceptibility to oxidation of polyunsaturated phospholipids. ROS were isolated from frozen retinas (James and Wanda Lawson, Lincoln, NE) as described previously (21McDowell J.H. Kuhn H. Biochemistry. 1977; 16: 4054-4060Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). ROS was solubilized in octyl glucoside, and rhodopsin was purified on a concanavalin A affinity column (22Litman B.J. Methods Enzymol. 1982; 81: 150-153Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Large unilamellar vesicles containing rhodopsin at a ratio of 1 rhodopsin to 100 phospholipids were prepared using the rapid dilution technique (23Jackson M.L. Litman B.J. Biochim. Biophys Acta. 1985; 812: 369-376Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Following dialysis to remove detergent, all vesicle preparations were suspended in pH 7.5 Tris basal salt (TBS) buffer consisting of 10 mm Tris, 60 mm NaCl, 30 mm KCl, 50 μm diethylenetriamine pentaacetic acid. Gt was prepared from ROS as a hypotonic extract (24Miller J.L. Litman B.J. Dratz E.A. Biochim. Biophys Acta. 1987; 898: 81-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar), the activity level was determined by a binding assay using 35S-labeled GTPγS (25Fung B.K. Stryer L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1980; 77: 2500-2504Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar), and stored in pH 7.5 TBS buffer with 30% glycerol at −20 °C for no longer than 2 weeks. The phospholipid, cholesterol, and rhodopsin content of each reconstituted vesicle preparation were determined by independent phosphate (26Bartlett G.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1959; 234: 596Google Scholar), cholesterol (Waco Chemicals USA, Inc., Richmond, VA), and ΔA500 assays, respectively. Samples for flash photolysis measurements were prepared by diluting concentrated, reconstituted vesicle stocks with pH 7.5 TBS buffer, dividing the solution in half, and adding concentrated Gt to one half and an identical amount of Gt buffer to the other half. Samples were then incubated for 4 h on ice to ensure binding of Gt to the bilayer (24Miller J.L. Litman B.J. Dratz E.A. Biochim. Biophys Acta. 1987; 898: 81-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). Final concentrations were 7.5 μm rhodopsin and 0.5–1.5 μmGt. Kinetics of MII and MII 158 Gt formation were assessed by measuring the transient absorption at 380 nm using a flash photolysis system constructed in the laboratory (27Straume M. Mitchell D.C. Miller J.L. Litman B.J. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 9135-9142Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar) with the following modifications. Excitation was provided by a high pressure flash lamp (E.G. & G., pulse width = 1μs) filtered with a broad (± 25 nm) bandpass filter centered at 500 nm. The current from a thermoelectrically cooled photomultiplier tube (R928, Hamamatsu) was passed to a low noise current amplifier (Stanford Research). The amplifier output voltage was acquired at 2–10 μs/point by a 1.25-MHz., 12-bit analog-to-digital converter (National Instruments) installed in a PC. The detailed kinetics of MII formation were extracted from the changes in absorbance observed at 380 nm in the absence of Gt via analysis in terms of the microscopic rate constants of the square (28Thorgeirsson T.E. Lewis J.W. Wallace-Williams S.E. Kliger D.S. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 13861-13872Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar) and branched (27Straume M. Mitchell D.C. Miller J.L. Litman B.J. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 9135-9142Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar) photoreaction models shown in Fig. 1. The observed absorbance increase at 380 nm was directly analyzed in terms of the microscopic rate constants of the two models using NONLIN (29Johnson M. Frasier S. Methods Enzymol. 1985; 117: 301-342Crossref Scopus (511) Google Scholar) with subroutines specifying each model written by the authors. The dilution reconstitution procedure produces rhodopsin-containing vesicles with half of the rhodopsin oriented with its cytoplasmic face external to the vesicle and half with the cytoplasmic face internal to the vesicle (23Jackson M.L. Litman B.J. Biochim. Biophys Acta. 1985; 812: 369-376Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Gt that has been added to the vesicle suspension can only interact with half of the rhodopsin; thus, the absorbance change observed in the presence of Gt is the result of three distinct species: MIIinside, MIIoutside, and MII-Gt. To isolate the absorbance increase caused by formation of MII-Gt, it is necessary to remove the contributions resulting from MIIinside and MIIoutside. The absorbance change recorded in the absence of Gt was multiplied by the following scaling factor and subtracted from the absorbance change recorded in the presence of Gt. Scaling factor=[(Keq−G+1)/(Keq+G+1)+1]/2Eq. 1 K eq−G and K eq+G are the MI-MII equilibrium constants measured in the absence and presence of Gt, respectively, and were determined from equilibrium measurements on the same samples used for the kinetic measurements (30Niu S. Mitchell D.C. Litman B.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 42807-42811Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Absorbance increases at 380 nm observed in the presence of Gt were analyzed with the two microscopic photoreaction models shown in Fig. 1plus a sum-of-two exponentials process for the binding of Gt to MII. The rate of formation of MII and MII-Gt complex in 18:0,22:6PC and 18:0,18:1PC with and without 30 mol% cholesterol was measured by flash photolysis. The flash-induced increase in absorbance at 380 nm, near the absorbance maximum for MII, was monitored from 20 μs to several hundred ms. For samples containing Gt, it was necessary to separate the rate of MII formation from that of the MII-Gt complex by characterizing the kinetics of MII formation observed in the absence of Gt. The increase in absorbance corresponding to the formation of MII was analyzed using the two microscopic photoreaction models shown in Fig.1, which characterize the portion of the rhodopsin photoreaction cascade from the decay of lumirhodopsin to the formation of MII. An example of the flash-induced increase in absorbance at 380 nm for rhodopsin in 18:0,22:6PC/30 mol% cholesterol with and without added Gt at 37 °C is shown in Fig.2. The results of the analysis for the Gt-free sample using the branched model (Ref. 27Straume M. Mitchell D.C. Miller J.L. Litman B.J. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 9135-9142Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar; Fig.2 A) and the square model (Ref. 28Thorgeirsson T.E. Lewis J.W. Wallace-Williams S.E. Kliger D.S. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 13861-13872Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar; Fig. 2 B) demonstrate the difference between these two models. In the branched model, both MIIfast and MIIslow are present at equilibrium; thus, the MI-MII equilibrium for this model is calculated according to Keq = (MIIfast + MIIslow)/MI. The two models produced values ofKeq for the MI-MII equilibrium that agreed with each other, as shown by the similar amplitudes for both MI and total MII for both models. The significant difference between the two photoreaction models is the manner in which they account for the most rapidly appearing species with an absorbance at 380 nm. For the branched model, the most rapidly forming species is MIIfast(dashed curve, Fig. 2 A), which rises to a maximum at ∼ 200 μs and decays to a level such that it constitutes ∼25% of total MII at equilibrium. In the square model, the most rapidly forming species with an absorbance at 380 nm is MI380 (dashed curve, Fig.2 B), which reaches a maximum at ∼200 μs and then decays to zero by 6 ms. The decay of MI380 to zero results in the time course for formation of total MII being shifted to the right for the square model (solid curve, Fig. 2 B) relative to the branched model (solid curve, Fig.2 A). An exponential rise to a plateau is characterized by the lifetime, τ, denoting the time required to rise to within (1 − 1/e) of the final, equilibrium value. Thevertical mark in the solid curves in Fig. 2 (A and B) denotes τ for total MII. For the branched model this occurs 0.68 ms after flash, and for the square model it occurs 1.47 ms after flash. The significance of the 0.79-ms difference in the rate of formation of MII for the two models is illustrated by the analysis of the flash-induced kinetics in the presence of Gt, shown in Fig.2 C. The upper curve in Fig.2 C was obtained for a sample identical to the one shown in Fig. 2 (A and B), except that it contains 1 μm Gt. The lower curvein Fig. 2 C is the isolated formation of the MII-Gt complex, as determined by an empirical separation of the raw data. The separation was accomplished by scaling the transient recorded without Gt according to Equation 1 and subtracting it from the transient observed in the presence of Gt. Inspection of this curve shows that it rises very rapidly, and thehash mark denotes the time, 0.74 ms, when it reaches to within (1 − 1/e) of its equilibrium value. Thus, the lifetime for MII formation, according to the square model, is greater than the lifetime for the MII-Gt complex formation. This physically improbable situation is simply a result of the provision in the square model that the most rapidly forming species at 380 nm is a MI species that decays to zero at equilibrium. In the branched model, the most rapidly forming species at 380 nm is a kinetically distinct form of MII. As a result, formation of total MII, according to the branched model, is approximately coincident with formation of the MII-Gt complex. The analysis and comparisons presented in Fig. 2 make it clear that at 37 °C the fastest component appearing at 380 nm must correspond to a “normal” MII species that is capable of binding Gt. Because of the consistency generated for the kinetics of the MII and MII-Gt formation, the branched model for the Lumi-MI-MII portion of the rhodopsin photoreaction cascade was employed in all analysis. In the absence of Gt, all kinetic data were well described by the branched model (Fig. 1), as shown by the smooth curves through the data obtained in the absence of Gt, as shown in Fig.3. The flash-induced increase in equilibrium absorbance at 380 nm is proportional to the MI-MII equilibrium constant, K eq−G. The values of K eq−G calculated from the branched model agreed with those determined from equilibrium difference spectra obtained for the same samples (30Niu S. Mitchell D.C. Litman B.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 42807-42811Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Agreement between the values of K eq−Gdetermined from equilibrium measurements and from analysis of kinetic data with the branched model was reported previously (31Mitchell D.C. Straume M. Miller J.L. Litman B.J. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 9143-9149Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar, 32Mitchell D.C. Straume M. Litman B.J. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 662-670Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). In the presence of Gt, all kinetic data were well described by using the solution to the branched model obtained in the absence of Gt, rescaled according to Equation 1, plus the sum of two exponential terms, as shown by the smooth curves through the kinetic absorbance changes acquired in the presence of Gt (Fig.3). The two pairs of curves in Fig. 3demonstrate one of the fundamental differences between the kinetic processes observed at 37 °C and those observed at 20 °C. The two kinetic traces observed at 37 °C (Fig. 3 A) diverge within ∼100 μs of the activating flash, demonstrating the rapid formation of the MII-Gt complex. In contrast, the two kinetic traces observed at 20 °C (Fig. 3 B), do not diverge until 2 or 3 ms after flash. This difference demonstrates that, at 37 °C, the MII-Gt complex forms very quickly after MII formation, whereas, at 20 °C, there is a lag time in the formation of the MII-Gt complex relative to MII. The increase in absorbance at 380 nm was measured in the absence and presence of Gt at physiological temperature for rhodopsin in vesicles with four different bilayer compositions: 18:0,22:6PC and 18:0,18:1PC, with and without 30 mol% cholesterol. Changes in phospholipid acyl chain composition and cholesterol altered the kinetics of both MII formation (Fig.4 A) and MII-Gtcomplex formation (Fig. 4 B). The data in each panel in Fig.4 have been scaled to the same maximum change in absorbance to facilitate comparison of the differences in kinetics. Comparison of the curves in panels A and B of Fig. 4show that, whereas both decreased acyl chain unsaturation and increased bilayer cholesterol delay the formation of MII, variation in these parameters cause an even greater delay in the formation of the MII-Gt complex. Complete analysis of the kinetic data acquired at 37 °C, summarized in Fig. 5, shows that cholesterol has relatively little effect on the kinetics of either MII or MII-Gt formation in a bilayer consisting of 18:0,22:6PC. This is consistent with a number of measurements that show that cholesterol has its smallest effect on bilayer properties in bilayers that contain 22:6n-3 acyl chains (33Mitchell D.C. Litman B.J. Biophys J. 1998; 75: 896-908Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). In contrast, in an 18:0,18:1PC bilayer, cholesterol increases the time required for MII formation by 50%, and the time required for MII-Gtformation by 400%. Reducing sn-2 acyl chain unsaturation from 22:6 to 18:1 doubles the time required for both MII formation and MII-Gt formation. At physiological temperature, the rates of MII-Gt complex formation approach those of MII formation in all bilayer compositions examined, with the exception of 18:0,18:1PC/30 mol% cholesterol, as shown in Fig. 5. To isolate the effects of bilayer composition on the lateral diffusion process that leads to formation of the MII-Gt complex, it is informative to compare the lifetimes for MII formation and MII-Gt complex formation. Comparison of the ratio of the average lifetimes, 〈τ〉MII-Gt/〈τ〉MII, eliminates the effect of delayed MII formation on the diffusional search process. At physiological temperature, MII formation and MII-Gt complex formation are nearly coincident in 18:0,22:6PC, even in the presence of 30 mol% cholesterol, as shown in Table I. Because MII cannot react with Gt any faster than it is formed from MI, the rate of formation of MII-Gt complex in 18:0,22:6PC appears to be maximal. In 18:0,22:6PC, the rate of MII-Gt complex formation, which is limited by lateral diffusion, is only slightly altered by the presence of 30 mol% cholesterol, further suggesting that 18:0,22:6PC has the optimum acyl chain composition for rapid formation of receptor-G protein complex. In 18:0,18:1PC, the addition of 30 mol% cholesterol increases the lifetime ratio by about a factor of 2.5, demonstrating the sharp reduction in the rate of lateral diffusion caused by cholesterol in a bilayer with a low level of unsaturation. In 18:0,18:1PC, the lifetime ratio is about the same as in 18:0,22:6PC, but both 〈τ〉MII and 〈τ〉MII-G are approximately doubled, indicative of the slower kinetics caused by reduced acyl chain unsaturation at thesn-2 position.Table IAverage lifetimes (ms) for MII and MII-G t complex formation and their ratio at 20 °C and 37 °C20 °C37 °C〈τ〉MII〈τ〉MII-Gt〈τ〉MII-Gt/〈τ〉MII〈τ〉MII〈τ〉MII-Gt〈τ〉MII-Gt/〈τ〉MII18:0,22:6PC10.1 ± 0.413.9 ± 0.31.4 ± 0.10.55 ± 0.060.59 ± 0.061.1 ± 0.218:0,22:6PC/30 mol% cholesterol10.6 ± 0.215.9 ± 0.31.5 ± 0.10.68 ± 0.070.73 ± 0.061.1 ± 0.218:0,18:1PC7.6 ± 0.222.2 ± 0.82.9 ± 0.21.12 ± 0.11.32 ± 0.071.2 ± 0.218:0,18:1PC/30 mol% cholesterol15.7 ± 0.456.8 ± 2.03.6 ± 0.21.83 ± 0.115.3 ± 0.22.9 ± 0.3 Open table in a new tab At 20 °C the rates of MII and MII-Gt formation in bilayers were slower than those at 37 °C. The greatest effect of bilayer composition was on the lifetime for diffusion-dependent MII-Gt complex formation, as shown in Table I. The MII-Gt complex forms at about the same rate in bilayers consisting of 18:0,22:6PC and 18:0,22:6PC/30 mol% cholesterol, but forms much slower in a bilayer consisting of 18:0,18:1PC/30 mol% cholesterol. In both pure phospholipid bilayers and cholesterol-containing bilayers, the MII-Gt complex formed fastest in 18:0,22:6PC, as shown in Table I. In pure 18:0,18:1PC, the MII-Gt complex formed 60% slower than in 18:0,22:6PC, and the addition of 30 mol% cholesterol slowed MII-Gt complex formation by a factor of 2.5 in 18:0,18:1PC, whereas it had relatively little effect in 18:0,22:6PC. These differences suggest that a high level of polyunsaturation at thesn-2 position increases the rate of Gt lateral diffusion. The bilayer compositions examined in this study produced changes in the rates of formation of both MII and MII-Gt complex, demonstrating that the diffusion of receptor and G protein are sensitive to the lipid composition of the membrane. Gt is anchored to the membrane by an isoprenoid moiety; thus, the effects of bilayer composition on Gt lateral diffusion are likely to be similar to those observed for phospholipid lateral diffusion. The present results are consistent with changes in the rate of lateral diffusion of fluorescent phospholipids caused by changes in bilayer cholesterol (34Ladha S. Mackie A.R. Harvey L.J. Clark D.C. Lea E.J. Brullemans M. Duclohier H. Biophys J. 1996; 71: 1364-1373Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar) and changes in polyunsaturated acyl chain oxidation (35Borst J.W. Visser N.V. Kouptsova O. Visser A.J. Biochim. Biophys Acta. 2000; 1487: 61-73Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). These two studies reported a positive correlation between slower lateral diffusion and more ordered acyl chain packing. Previous studies demonstrate that increased phospholipid acyl chain unsaturation leads to more disordered acyl chain packing and increased bilayer free volume (36Mitchell D.C. Litman B.J. Biophys J. 1998; 74: 879-891Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). The present results are also in agreement with a detailed analysis of lateral diffusion in di14:0PC/cholesterol bilayers that determined that cholesterol slows phospholipid lateral diffusion by decreasing phospholipid acyl chain packing free volume (37Almeida P.F. Vaz W.L. Thompson T.E. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 6739-6747Crossref PubMed Scopus (524) Google Scholar). A unique feature of this study is the comparison of the kinetics of the unimolecular MI-to-MII reaction and the diffusion-dependent MII-Gt at physiological temperature and at a reduced temperature. The results presented in Fig. 3 and summarized in Table Idemonstrate that these two kinetic processes are slowed to different degrees by reduced temperature. In a bilayer consisting of 18:0,18:1PC, at 37 °C, the lifetime for MII-Gt formation is only 20% greater than the lifetime for MII formation. However, at 20 °C, MII-Gt formation trails MII formation by a factor of 3. The implication of this difference is that studies of MII-Gtbinding must be carried out at physiological temperature if the ultimate goal of the investigation is provide an explanation for processes observed in vivo. It is noteworthy that, among the bilayer compositions examined, the two compositions that most closely resemble the native ROS disc membrane are 18:0,22:6PC with and without 30 mol% cholesterol. Like the native membrane, 50% of the acyl chains in these bilayers are 22:6n-3, and the basal disc membranes contain 30 mol% cholesterol (38Boesze-Battaglia K. Hennessey T. Albert A.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 8151-8155Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and the predominant acyl chain configuration of 22:6-containing phospholipids in the ROS disc membrane issn-1 saturated, sn-2 22:6n-3 (39Stinson A.M. Wiegand R.D. Anderson R.E. Exp. Eye Res. 1991; 52: 218Google Scholar). The results presented here suggest that the delays in electroretinagram response observed in dietary n-3 deficiency2(19Neuringer M. Connor W.E. Lin D.S. Barstad L. Luck S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 4021-4025Crossref PubMed Scopus (763) Google Scholar, 20Birch D.G. Birch E.E. Hoffman D.R. Uauy R.D. Invest. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 1992; 33: 2365-2376PubMed Google Scholar) could be partially the result of a slower rate of MII-Gt formation in the absence of 22:6n-3 phospholipid acyl chains. At physiological temperature and the conditions of our measurements, MII-Gt complex formed twice as slowly in 18:0,18:1PC relative to 18:0,22:6PC. The measurement conditions differ from those found in vivo in several respects. The two most significant differences are the low level of rhodopsin stimulation in vivo and the large contrast in acyl chain composition between 18:0,18:1PC and 18:0,22:6PC. In the measurements reported here, 15% of the rhodopsin was bleached, resulting in an average distance between MII molecules of 15 nm. The physiological range of rod cell function involves activation of about 1 rhodopsin of every 100,000, resulting in an average distance between MII molecules of about 1000 nm. Thus, the experimental conditions employed in the present study would tend to lessen the effects of altered receptor and/or G protein lateral diffusion on the rate MII-Gt formation relative to what would be observed under physiological conditions. The comparison of 18:1 and 22:6 at thesn-2 position is a greater alteration than that produced by dietary n-3 fatty acid deficiency, which generally leads to replacement of 22:6n-3 with 22:5n-6 (40Neuringer M. Am. J. Clin. Nutr. 2000; 71: 256S-267SCrossref PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, the bilayer compositions examined in the present study exaggerate the differences in membrane composition produced by dietary n-3 deficiency. The increase in 〈τ〉MII-G caused by exchanging 22:6 for 18:1 at the sn-2 position, corresponds to a 50% reduction in the rate of binding of Gt to MII. The initial rising phase of the rod cell photoresponse is a parabolic function of time and a linear function of the rate of activation of phosphodiesterase catalytic subunits per unit time (5Leskov I.B. Klenchin V.A. Handy J.W. Whitlock G.G. Govardovskii V.I. Bownds M.D. Lamb T.D. Pugh E.N. Arshavsky V.Y. Neuron. 2000; 27: 525-537Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). Biochemical analysis shows that the rates of Gt activation and phosphodiesterase catalytic subunit activation are approximately equal (5Leskov I.B. Klenchin V.A. Handy J.W. Whitlock G.G. Govardovskii V.I. Bownds M.D. Lamb T.D. Pugh E.N. Arshavsky V.Y. Neuron. 2000; 27: 525-537Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). Assuming that the rates of Gt binding and Gt activation are similar, this means that a reduction in the rate of MII-Gt complex formation by 10% will delay the rod cell photoresponse by 5%. We report a 50% reduction in the rate of MII-Gt complex formation, under conditions that minimize the effects of lateral diffusion relative to physiological conditions. These results indicate that the effect of membrane composition on the rates of rhodopsin and/or Gt lateral diffusion would be sufficient to account for the 5% delay in a-wave implicit time activity observed in dietary n-3 deficiency.2 Since the classical photoreaction cascade of Lumi → Meta I → Meta II was introduced by Wald and co-workers (7Mathews R. Hubbard R. Brown P. Wald G. J. Gen. Physiol. 1963; 47: 215-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (432) Google Scholar), a number of additional photointermediates on the microsecond to millisecond timescale have been proposed based on observed kinetic complexity (27Straume M.

Fukada Y. Terakita A. Shichida Y. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 14173-14180Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Several investigations have determined that the full complexity of the transitions between photointermediates occurring on the MI-to-MII time scale become most apparent when examined at physiological temperature (27Straume M. Mitchell D.C. Miller J.L. Litman B.J. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 9135-9142Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 45Lewis J.W. Winterle J.S. Powers M.A. Kliger D.S. Dratz E.A. Photochem. Photobiol. 1981; 34: 375-384Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). However, no previous study has examined the interaction of Gt with MII, or any other 380 nm-absorbing species at 37 °C. The data and analysis presented in Fig. 2 provide strong evidence that the most rapidly forming photointermediate with an absorbance at 380 nm is part of the classical MI-MII equilibrium and binds Gt. The measurements presented in this study do not address issues raised by other investigations such as the effect of pH, proton uptake, or possible effects of GTP on the MI-to-MII transition. All measurements were made in the absence of GTP, a condition that leads to the formation of a Gt-MIb complex in measurements at −35 °C (44Tachibanaki S. Imai H. Mizukami T. Okada T. Imamoto Y. Matsuda T. Fukada Y. Terakita A. Shichida Y. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 14173-14180Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). However, the measurements reported here for samples at 37 °C showed no evidence for binding of Gt to a state other than MII. The visual signal transduction pathway has been optimized by evolution to be one of the most rapid and highly amplified signal transduction pathways in the human body. The present results demonstrate that the lipid composition of the rod outer segment disc membrane makes a significant contribution to the optimal kinetic functioning of this prototypical G protein-coupled pathway. The excitable membranes of the nervous system all contain high levels of phospholipids with polyunsaturated acyl chains, thus it is expected that the results presented here will be applicable to G protein-coupled systems associated with neurotransmitters, taste, and olfaction and should be generally applicable to other members in the G protein-coupled superfamily."

Rhodopsin was reconstituted into large, unilamellar phospholipid vesicles with varying acyl chain unsaturation, with and without cholesterol. The association constant (K a) for metarhodopsin II (MII) and transducin (Gt) binding was determined by monitoring MII-Gt complex formation spectrophotometrically.

Increasing acyl chain unsaturation from 18:0,18:1PC to 18:0,22:6PC resulted in a 3-fold increase in K a. The inclusion of 30 mol% cholesterol in the membrane reduced K a in both 18:0,22:6PC and 18:0,18:1PC. These findings demonstrate that membrane compositions can alter the signaling cascade by changing protein-protein interactions occurring predominantly in the hydrophilic region of the proteins, external to the lipid bilayer.

The receptors for these systems are integral membrane proteins, embedded in a lipid matrix. Neuronal and retinal tissues and the olfactory bulb contain high levels of then-3 polyunsaturated acyl chain derived from docosahexaenoic acid (22:6n-3)1 in their cell membrane phospholipids (1Stinson A.M. Wiegand R.D. Anderson R.E. Exp. Eye Res. 1991; 52: 213-218Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar, 2Salem N. Spiller G.A. Scala J. New Protective Roles for Selected Nutrients. Alan R.

Uauy R. Invest. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 1992; 33: 3242-3253PubMed Google Scholar), learning deficits (2Salem N. Spiller G.A. Scala J. New Protective Roles for Selected Nutrients. Alan R.

Neurochem. 2000; 75: 2563-2573Crossref PubMed Scopus (353) Google Scholar) associated with n-3 fatty acid deficiency. In all cases where acyl chain analysis was carried out, the 22:6n-3 content of membrane phospholipids was dramatically reduced in then-3-deficient animals where it was replaced by 22:5n-6 (5Moriguchi T. Greiner R.S. Salem N. J. Neurochem. 2000; 75: 2563-2573Crossref PubMed Scopus (353) Google Scholar). These findings suggest that the high levels of 22:6n-3 in membrane phospholipids play a critical role in various membrane-associated signaling pathways. A common thread in several of these processes is the ubiquitous motif of G protein-coupled signaling systems. However, molecular mechanisms linking 22:6n-3 phospholipids with essential physiological functions remain to be clarified. The study described herein aims to elucidate such mechanisms by investigating the effect of membrane lipid composition on G protein-coupled signal transduction.In G protein-coupled systems, the receptor activates an effector protein through the action of a G protein (6Helmreich E.J. Hofmann K.P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1286: 285-322Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). Receptors in this superfamily are integral membrane proteins made up of seven transmembrane helices and their respective connecting loops. In contrast, the G protein and effector proteins are generally peripheral proteins, bound to the membrane by a combination of an isoprenoid chain-lipid bilayer interactions (7Matsuda T. Takao T.

Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 7950-7960Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). The receptor-binding site for the ligand is formed by the transmembrane helices and lies near the midpoint of the membrane; hence, the conformational changes accompanying receptor activation would be expected to have a dependence on the membrane lipid composition. In contrast, the interaction of the G protein with the receptor occurs primary external to the membrane bilayer (10Ernst O.P. Meyer C.K. Marin E.P. Henklein P. Fu W.Y. Sakmar T.P. Hofmann K.P. J.

How the lipid composition might affect the interaction between receptor and G protein external to membrane bilayer is not clear.The visual transduction system is among the best characterized G protein-coupled signaling systems (12Litman B.J. Mitchell D.C. Lee A. Biomembranes. JAI Press, Greenwich, CT1996: 1-32Google Scholar) and is used as a model in these studies (13Hargrave P.A. McDowell J.H.

Light absorption results in the generation of a rapid equilibrium between MI and MII (15Mathews R. Hubbard R. Brown P. Wald G. J. Gen. Physiol. 1963; 47: 215-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (428) Google Scholar), and the active conformation, MII, readily associates with Gt, forming the MII-Gtcomplex, which is relatively stable in the absence of GTP (16Hofmann K.P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1985; 810: 278-281Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). The interaction sites on MII involved in binding Gt are composed of three cytoplasmic loops formed by the peptide sequence connecting helices III and IV, V and VI, and a putative loop formed by amino acids 310–321, anchored in the bilayer by palmitate groups esterified to Cys-322 and Cys-323 (17Hamm H.E.

Studies using various peptides representing the putative binding region of Gt implicate two regions in the carboxyl-terminal region of Gα and a segment of Gγ as the interaction sites with MII (18Konig B.

The interactions appear to be mainly hydrophilic in nature, because the interaction sites are located external to the membrane bilayer.In this study, rhodopsin was reconstituted into large, unilamellar vesicles containing either di22:6PC, 18:0,22:6PC, or 18:0,18:1PC with and/or without 30 mol% cholesterol and the association constants of MII-Gt formation in these lipids were determined. Our results show that acyl chain unsaturation and cholesterol in the membrane significantly alter the MII-Gt coupling. Because the visual signaling system is the prototype member in the superfamily of G-protein coupled signaling systems, our findings of the effect of lipid composition and cholesterol on receptor-G protein coupling should serve as a general demonstration of the modulation of cell signaling efficiency by membrane composition.RESULTSThe MI-MII equilibrium and the association of MII with Gt can be readily monitored through changes in the absorption spectra of these photointermediates. Examples of the effect of two different lipid compositions on the MI-MII equilibrium and MII-Gt complex formation are shown in Fig.1. The spectra for rhodopsin reconstituted in vesicles consisting of a highly unsaturated 18:0,22:6PC are shown in Fig. 1 A, whereas those in a monounsaturated 18:0,18:1PC mixed with 30 mol% cholesterol are shown in Fig. 1 B. In the absence of Gt, the spectra in Fig. 1 A contained two absorption bands centered about 385 and 480 nm, associated with the MII and MI photointermediates, respectively. In Fig. 1 A (open circles), the MI and MII peaks are approximately equal, whereas the MII peak was greatly reduced accompanied by a large increase in the MI peak in Fig. 1 B (open circles). The presence of Gt caused an enhancement of the MII peaks in both bilayer systems (Fig. 1,A and B, filled circles). This is the result of MII-Gt complex formation and the fact that formation of this complex does not alter the spectral properties of MII.The spectral contribution of the bands with absorption peaks centered at 480 nm and 385 nm in Fig. 1 (A and B) were deconvolved into contributions as a result of MI and MII in the absence of Gt and MI and (MII + MII-Gt) in the presence of Gt, as shown by dashed and solid curves, respectively. It is clear that the amount of MII or (MII + MII-Gt) formed was greater in 18:0,22:6PC relative to 18:0,18:1PC with 30 mol% cholesterol, demonstrating the role of lipid composition in modulating the formation of MII and MII-Gt. The calculated values of K eq−G and K eq+G in 18:0,22:6PC (Fig.1 A) were 1.01 ± 0.02 and 2.22 ± 0.14, respectively, whereas K eq−Gand K eq+G in 18:0,18:1PC with 30 mol% cholesterol (Fig. 1 B) were 0.19 ± 0.04 and 0.35 ± 0.04, respectively.Both K eq−G and K eq+G varied by more than a factor of 5 over the range of bilayer compositions examined in this study, as shown in Fig. 2. In the absence of Gt, K eq−Gfollowed the order of di22:6PC > 18:0,22:6PC > 18:0,22:6PC + 30 mol% cholesterol ≈ 18:0,18:1PC > 18:0,18:1PC + 30 mol% cholesterol. This is consistent with previous findings (25Litman B.J. Mitchell D.C. Lipids. 1996; 31 (suppl.): S193-S197Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 26Brown M.F. Chem. Phys.

Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 662-670Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar) that showed that the reduced acyl chain unsaturation and the presence of cholesterol reduce the equilibrium concentration of MII. The presence of Gt increased the apparent amount of MII formed in all samples, as indicated by the values of K eq+G. This results from the formation of the MII-Gt complex. The trend for K eq+G with bilayer composition followed that of K eq−G.Figure 2Effect of lipid composition onK eq−G (open bars) andK eq+G (diagonal bars). These values were derived from equilibrium measurements in the absence and presence of 1.0 μm Gt as shown in Fig. 1 at 20 °C, pH 7.5. K eq−G is defined as the ratio of [MII]/[MI], whereas K eq+G is defined as the ratio of ([MII]+[MII-Gt])/[MI].View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Values of [Gt]free, [MII-Gt], and [MII] were calculated from K eq−G and K eq+G according to EquationsEq. 3, Eq. 4, Eq. 5. A series of measurements made with increasing ratios of Gt to MII was used to produce the binding profiles of MII to Gt. Example plots of [MII-Gt]/[MII]total versus[Gt]free in two lipid compositions are shown in Fig. 3. Increased concentrations of Gt resulted in an increase amount of MII-Gtcomplex formation. However, the slopes in the binding plots were rather different, reflecting dissimilar binding constants in the two lipid bilayers. Analysis of the data according to Equation 2 gaveK a of 1.5 × 107m−1 for 18:0,22:6PC vesicles andK a of 2.5 × 106m−1 for 18:0,18:1PC vesicles containing 30 mol% cholesterol.Figure 3Lipid dependence of MII-Gtbinding.

Two key observations may be drawn from the values of K a. 1) The increase in acyl chain unsaturation going from 18:0,18:1PC to 18:0,22:6PC resulted in a 3-fold enhancement in K a, whereas further increase in unsaturation going to di22:6PC resulted in a slight reduction inK a relative to 18:0,22:6PC. 2) Cholesterol reducedK a in both monounsaturated 18:0,18:1PC and highly unsaturated 18:0,22:6PC. The K a values in 18:0,18:1PC + 30 mol% cholesterol and 18:0,22:6PC + 30 mol% cholesterol are 2.5 × 106m−1 and 4.4 × 106m−1, respectively, showing a somewhat smaller effect in the polyunsaturated bilayer.Figure 4Effect of lipid composition onK a of MII-Gt. The values are derived from data similar to that shown in Fig. 3 at 20 °C, pH 7.5.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)DISCUSSIONPrevious studies have demonstrated that the formation of the active conformation of the G protein-coupled receptor rhodopsin, MII, is dependent on the membrane lipid composition (23;25–29), consistent with the present results regarding the lipid dependence of K eq−G. A primary finding of this study is that MII-Gt complex formation, the initial amplification step in the visual cascade, is also modulated by the phospholipid acyl chain and cholesterol composition of the membrane. Increased acyl chain unsaturation and decreased level of cholesterol resulted in a higher affinity of MII to Gt. One characteristic of the native disc membrane is that ∼50% of the total acyl chains are made of 22:6n-3, which is similar to that in 18:0,22:6PC. The reported K a in native disc is on the order of 107m−1 (30Kuhn H. Bennett N. Michel-Villaz M. Chabre M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1981; 78: 6873-6877Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar, 31Parkes J.H. Gibson S.K. Liebman P.A. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 6862-6878Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar), whereas K a in 18:0,22:6PC reconstituted vesicles is 1.5 × 107m−1. The agreement between these values, despite the differences in phospholipid headgroup composition, indicates the important role of 22:6n-3 in modulating the coupling of rhodopsin to Gt.Increased phospholipid acyl chain unsaturation was shown to increase the formation of MII (27O'Brien D.F. Costa L.F. Ott R.A. Biochemistry. 1977; 16: 1295-1303Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar, 29Mitchell D.C. Straume M. Litman B.J. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 662-670Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar), whereas increased cholesterol concentration decreases MII (28Mitchell D.C. Straume M. Miller J.L. Litman B.J. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 9143-9149Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). These findings have been linked to the specific packing properties of polyunsaturated acyl chains and the effect of cholesterol on these packing properties (29Mitchell D.C. Straume M. Litman B.J. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 662-670Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). Current evidence indicates that MII-Gt interactions involve the three hydrophilic loops on the cytoplasmic surface of rhodopsin with regions in the carboxyl-terminal region of Gt, placing the interaction surfaces external to the bilayer. The dependence of the extent of MII-Gt complex formation on the phospholipid acyl chain composition demonstrates that membrane lipid composition can not only play a role in modulating the level of MII formation, but it has a marked effect on the coupling of an integral membrane protein receptor to a peripherally bound G protein. Hence, the acyl chain packing in the hydrophobic region of the bilayer can affect interactions thought to occur primarily in the hydrophilic region of integral and peripheral membrane proteins.Our results demonstrate that acyl chain composition and cholesterol content modulate the coupling step of Gt to MII. To understand how lipid composition may modulate MII-Gtinteractions, it is necessary to consider the molecular events associated with MII-Gt binding. The formation of the MII-Gt complex involves a diffusional search of MII and Gt for each other on the membrane surface and subsequent productive collisions leading to binding. Varying phospholipid acyl chain composition and cholesterol content can alter membrane properties in a number of ways. 1) Acyl chain packing properties can affect the rotation and diffusion of rhodopsin in the membrane. 2) The lateral diffusion and association of Gt on the membrane can be changed. Gt is associated with the membrane through an isoprenoid linkage. Acyl chain packing may affect the orientation of Gt in the bilayer making MII-Gt collisions less productive in terms of complex formation. 3) Increased acyl chain saturation inhibits the formation of MII because the outward movement of helices during MII formation may be hindered in a more rigid lipid environment resulting in reduced MII-Gt complex formation. In addition, the sensitivity to acyl chain and cholesterol content may indicate a greater role of protein-protein interactions within the hydrophobic portion of the membrane than were considered previously. In a separate study, the effect of lipid composition on the kinetics of MII and MII-Gt formation was studied using flash photolysis (32Mitchell D.C. Niu S. Litman B.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 42801-42806Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). We found that the kinetics of MII formation, which is a unimolecular reaction, exhibited relatively mild dependence on bilayer composition, whereas the kinetics of MII-Gt formation was greatly diminished by the presence of cholesterol and more saturated lipids. These findings support the role of lipid composition in modulating the diffusional coupling of MII to Gt on membrane surface.Visual signaling is initiated from rhodopsin and propagated along the visual cascade through a series of coupled steps. In this study we have demonstrated that the initial steps, which are rhodopsin activation and MII-Gt coupling, are modulated by lipid composition and cholesterol. The net effect of bilayer composition on visual transduction can be evaluated in terms of the yield of MII-Gt complex formation per bleached rhodopsin, [MII-Gt]/[Rh*]. The following equation was used for such calculation. [MII−Gt][Rh*]=m−m2−4·Ka2·Rh*·[Gt]2·Ka·[Rh*],Eq. 6 where [Gt] is the total concentration of Gt, and m=(1+1/Keq−G)+Ka·[Gt]+[Rh*]·Ka.Eq. 7 Equation 6 is derived from the following equations. Keq−G=[MII]/[MI]Eq. 8 Ka=[MII­Gt]/([MII]·([Gt]−[MII­Gt]))Eq. 9 [Rh*]=[MI]+[MII]+[MII­Gt]Eq. 10 Under physiological conditions, the ratio of rhodopsin to Gt is ∼10 to 1 in ROS membranes and in the range of 1 of 100,000 rhodopsins absorbs a photon, giving rise to a visual response. The effect of bilayer composition on [MII-Gt]/[Rh*] is clearly demonstrated in Fig. 5. Although ∼90% of bleached rhodopsin formed complex with Gt in 18:0,22:6PC and di22:6PC vesicles, only 60% of such complex is formed in 18:0,18:1PC vesicles. The presence of 30 mol% cholesterol in 18:0,22:6PC and 18:0,18:1PC resulted in ∼60 and 30% complex formation, respectively. It was recently reported that ∼10% of rhodopsin in the ROS disc membrane is contained in a detergent-resistant membrane fraction or lipid raft (33Seno K. Kishimoto M. Abe M. Higuchi Y. Mieda M. Owada Y. Yoshiyama W. Liu H. Hayashi F. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 20813-20816Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). If this raftlike phase exists under physiological conditions, and like other lipid rafts, it is rich in cholesterol and saturated acyl chains, the present results suggest that MII-Gt binding strength and kinetics would be reduced for this population of rhodopsin. In addition to phosphatidylcholine, the native disc membrane also contains ∼10% phosphatidylserine (PS) and ∼42% phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) (1Stinson A.M. Wiegand R.D. Anderson R.E. Exp. Eye Res. 1991; 52: 213-218Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). PS will add a negative surface charge to the membrane, whereas PE will contribute an increased level of acyl chain packing order because of its higher melting point relative to PC. Our current data would suggest that the presence of PE would be somewhat inhibitory relative to MII-Gt complex formation. The effect of PS is yet to be determined.Figure 5Calculated yield of MII-Gt formed relative to the number of rhodopsin molecules that absorbed a photon at physiological light levels. [MII-Gt]/[Rh*] was calculated according to Equation 6 using experimentally determined values of K eq−G andK a. The concentrations of rhodopsin and Gt were set at 10 and 1 μm, respectively. The physiological bleach level for rhodopsin was assumed to be 1 of 100,000.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)A model, relating the biochemical events in the visual transduction pathway with the neural response, as measured by the electroretinograms, was recently published (34Leskov I.B. Klenchin V.A. Handy J.W. Whitlock G.G. Govardovskii V.I. Bownds M.D. Lamb T.D. Pugh E.N. Arshavsky V.Y. Neuron. 2000; 27: 525-537Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). In this model, the response at any time after a light stimulus is directly proportional to the concentration of activated rhodopsin molecules, i.e.[MII]. Here, we have determined that, at very low light levels, the fraction of MII-Gt complex to bleached rhodopsin, [MII-Gt/Rh*] depends on the lipid composition of the membrane, Fig. 5. If [MII-Gt/Rh*] is a measure of the fraction of bleached rhodopsin that can participate in activating Gt, then the factor in the equation for the response time at physiological light exposures needs to be corrected for variation in membrane lipid composition. Both the 22:6n-3-containing PCs examined in this study support nearly full participation of the bleached rhodopsin in Gt activation, Fig. 5. In contrast, the 18:1n-9- containing PC supports only 60% participation of the bleached rhodopsin in Gt activation, whereas the addition of 30 mol% of cholesterol reduces this to about 30%. Thus, the response time in the 22:6n-3-containing PC's would be expected to be faster relative to that observed in the 18:1n-9-containing PC by a factor of 1.67. In the case ofn-3 deficiency, 22:6n-3 is replaced by a lower level polyunsaturated, 22:5n-6, and a lag time is observed in the leading edge of the a-wave in the electroretinograms (35Neuringer M. Connor W.E. Van Petten C. Barstad L. J. Clin. Invest. 1984; 73: 272-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (504) Google Scholar). Decreased MII participation in MII-Gt complex formation would also contribute to lower signal amplitude, because fewer Gt proteins would be activated. Although, it is not anticipated that the difference between 22:6n-3 and 22:5n-6 will produce as great a lag time as is indicated for 18:1n-9, the observed lag time and reduced signal amplitude in n-3 deficiency relative to n-3-sufficient subjects is consistent with the dependence of the level of MII-Gt complex formation on the membrane lipid composition.The visual cascade, initiated by the light activation of rhodopsin, involves a series of protein-coupled reactions resulting in an amplified response. The first step in signal amplification in the visual pathway is the formation of the MII-Gt complex. The modulatory effect of bilayer acyl chain composition and cholesterol content on both the kinetics and extent of formation of the MII-Gt complex observed in this and the previous (32Mitchell D.C. Niu S. Litman B.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 42801-42806Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar) study will have direct impact on the downstream steps of the visual cascade. Weakened MII-Gt interactions will results in reduced amplification and slower kinetics at the Gt activation step, which will propagate down the pathway to produce reduced activity of the effector protein, cGMP phosphodiesterase. These effects may well provide the molecular basis for the diminished amplitude and sensitivity (36Weisinger H.S. Vingrys A.J. Sinclair A.J. Lipids. 1996; 31: 65-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar, 37Weisinger H.S. Vingrys A.J. Bui B.V. Sinclair A.J. Invest. Ophthalmol. Vis.

Because of the similar signaling motif in other G protein-coupled signaling systems, the findings in this study should be generally applicable to other members in the G protein-coupled family, providing a molecular mechanism for the observed loss in cognitive skills (2Salem N.

We interpret a 23.3 +/- 0.3-yr periodicity preserved in a 2,500 Myr BP Australian banded iron formation (BIF) as reflecting the climatic influence of the lunar nodal tide, which has been detected with its modern 18.6-yr periodicity in some modern climate records.

The implied history of Precambrian tidal friction is in accord with both the more recent palaeontological evidence and the long-term stability of the lunar orbit.

The disease is also known as “kala-azar” in India and Nepal. Treatment for this disease involves chemotherapy using antimony-based drugs, which is less effective in immunocompromised individuals (1Handman E. Clin. Microbiol. Rev. 2001; 14: 229-243Crossref PubMed Scopus (437) Google Scholar). To date no vaccine is available for this disease. L. donovani has a digenic life cycle. The flagellated form, called promastigote, resides extracellularly in the gut of a dipteran sand fly insect. The second form, amastigote, is found in the macrophages of the infected human host. The growth and differentiation of Leishmania involves both qualitative and quantitative changes in various biochemical parameters (2Chang K.P. Chaudhuri G. Fong D. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 1990; 44: 499-529Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). In our previous studies, we have identified genes that may have a role in growth and differentiation of the parasite (3Joshi M. Dwyer D.M. Nakhasi H.L. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1993; 58: 345-354Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar, 4Pogue G.P. Lee N.S. Koul S. Dwyer D.M. Nakhasi H.L.

Here we describe one such gene, centrin, and analyze its function with respect to growth of the parasite. Centrins are cytoskeletal, calcium-binding (EF-hand) proteins that are localized in the microtubule-organizing center of eukaryotes (6Baron A.T. Greenwood T.M. Salisbury J.L. Cell Motil. Cytoskeleton. 1991; 18: 1-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Centrins are one of the several regulatory proteins essential for duplication or segregation of the centrosome in higher eukaryotes and basal bodies in lower eukaryotes (7Wiech H. Geier B.M. Paschke T. Spang A. Grein K. Steinkotter J. Melkonian M. Schiebel E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 22453-22461Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). In many organisms, more than one centrin isotype has been described e.g. three centrins in humans and mice. Though three centrin forms have been recognized in the unicellular algae Chlamydomonas, only one has so far been characterized (8Taillon B.E. Adler S.A. Suhan J.P. Jarvik J.W. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 119: 1613-1624Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). One subfamily of centrins, which includes human centrin 1 (HsCEN1), human centrin 2 (HsCEN2), and Chlamydomonas reinhardtii centrin (CrCEN1), is involved in centrosome segregation (9Laoukili J. Perret E. Middendorp S. Houcine O. Guennou C. Marano F. Bornens M. Tournier F. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 1355-1364PubMed Google Scholar). The other subfamily, which includes human centrin 3 (HsCEN3) and yeast centrin (CDC31), is involved in centrosome duplication (10Middendorp S. Paoletti A. Schiebel E. Bornens M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 9141-9146Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar, 11Khalfan W. Ivanovska I. Rose M.D. Genetics. 2000; 155: 1543-1559PubMed Google Scholar). Results from diverse experimental systems, mostly in yeast, suggest that different types of proteins like PKic1p, protein kinase (11Khalfan W. Ivanovska I.

Though centrin has been characterized in a variety of eukaryotes, it has not been reported in the order Kinetoplastida. The parasites of the Kinetoplastida are responsible for a wide variety of diseases affecting humans, animals, and plants (15Bastin P. Pullen T.J. Moreira-Leite F.F. Gull K. Microbes Infect. 2000; 2: 1865-1874Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Members of this group have been considered to be one of the earliest eukaryotes, developing conventional organelles, but sometimes with extreme features rarely seen in other organisms (15Bastin P. Pullen T.J. Moreira-Leite F.F. Gull K. Microbes Infect. 2000; 2: 1865-1874Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). The role of such unique structural and functional features of these organelles, like the cytoskeleton and the flagellar apparatus, in infectivity is still obscure. Hence, the identification of genes that enable Leishmania to grow and differentiate within the harsh and diverse environments (sand fly gut and human macrophages) continues to be our objective (3Joshi M. Dwyer D.M. Nakhasi H.L. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1993; 58: 345-354Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar, 16Joshi M. Dwyer D.M. Nakhasi H.L. J. Eukaryot.

The nature and the role of either the microtubule-organizing center or the basal body apparatus in the primitive eukaryoteLeishmania are still not known. None of the genes (e.g. centrin, calmodulin, and γ-tubulin) that are associated with these organelles in higher eukaryotes has been characterized so far in this important human parasite. As a first step toward that, here we report our findings leading to cloning, sequencing, and characterization of a centrin gene from L. donovani (LdCEN). We have also undertaken a functional analysis of Leishmania centrin protein by performing deletion analysis of the centrin gene and expressing such truncated proteins in the parasites to test their potential role in the growth of the parasite. L. donovaniisolated from either the Indian kala-azar patient (K80) or the cloned line designated by the World Health Organization as MHOM/SD/62/1S-C12D (SD) (16Joshi M. Dwyer D.M. Nakhasi H.L. J. Eukaryot. Microbiol. 1995; 42: 628-632Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar) was used in all the experiments. Promastigotes and the axenic amastigotes were grown and harvested as described previously (16Joshi M. Dwyer D.M. Nakhasi H.L. J. Eukaryot. Microbiol. 1995; 42: 628-632Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). A cloned arbitrarily primed polymerase chain reaction fragment (AP-PCR-8), amplified specifically from an Indian kala-azar parasite DNA using AP-PCR primer 9 (5Pogue G.P. Koul S. Lee N.S. Dwyer D.M. Nakhasi H.L. Parasitol. Res. 1995; 81: 282-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar), hybridized differentially to 2.1 kb1 RNA from promastigotes compared with axenic amastigotes. This DNA was used as a probe to screen a genomic cosmid library of L. donovani (19Debrabant A. Gottlieb M. Dwyer D.M. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1995; 71: 51-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). A positive cosmid clone was sequenced in the region of the AP-PCR8 fragment. Sequencing revealed that the 3′-end of AP-PCR8 fragment overlapped with the 5′-untranslated region of an ORF. The encoded protein of 149 amino acids was identified through BLAST search as a homolog of the centrin gene from other organisms. The authenticity of the start site of the centrin ORF was confirmed by performing a reverse transcription-PCR, using an internal reverse primer (5′-TTCGCAACCTCCTTCAAG) and a forward primer (5′-ACTAACGCTATATAAGTA) designed from the Leishmania-specific mRNA splice leader sequence (20Wilson K. Hanson S. Landfear S. Ullman B. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 5787Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). The reverse transcription-PCR-amplified products were cloned into pCRII-TOPO vector and sequenced with the M13 forward and reverse primers. Multiple sequence alignment of centrins from various organisms was conducted in MacVector 7.0 program and used to determine cluster relationships among the sequences and to construct dendrograms representing cluster relationships (21Ahmad S. Selvapandiyan A. Bhatnagar R.K. Int. J. Syst. Evol. Microbiol. 2000; 50 Pt. 5: 1761-1766Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Total Genomic DNA was isolated from either promastigotes or axenic amastigotes according to the methods described in the manual for GENOME DNA isolation kit from BIO 101 Inc. The DNA was digested with restriction endonucleases EcoRI, NcoI, andSalI and separated on 1% agarose gels. Southern blot analysis of digested DNA was done as described previously (22Selvapandiyan A. Majumder K. Fattah F.A. Ahmad S. Arora N. Bhatnagar R.K. FEBS Lett. 1995; 374: 253-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Total RNA was isolated from promastigote and axenic amastigote cultures of L. donovani using RNA STAT-60 according to the manufacturer's instructions (Tel-Test, Inc. Friendswood, TX). Total RNA (10 μg) was analyzed by Northern blot as described (23Pogue G.P. Joshi M. Lee N.S. Dwyer D.M. Kenney R.T. Gam A.A. Nakhasi H.L. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1996; 81: 27-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Both Northern and Southern blots were hybridized with a 32P-labeled centrin coding region (450 base pairs) probe. The membranes were exposed and scanned on the PhosphorImager system (Molecular Dynamics Amersham Pharmacia Biotech Piscataway, NJ). The intensity of the hybridized bands was quantitated using ImageQuant software version 1.1 (Molecular Dynamics). Plasmid constructs to express either the wild type or the mutant forms of LdCEN in eitherEscherichia coli or L. donovani cells are described in Fig. 1. The full-length open reading frame of wild type centrin and its various mutant forms were PCR-amplified with primers as described in Fig. 1 and ligated individually in pCR-T7/CT TOPO vector (Invitrogen) and transformed into competent E. coli BL21 (DE3) PlysS (Invitrogen). The authenticity of each of the constructs and the PCR-amplified fragments was confirmed by DNA sequencing. Reverse primers that were used to amplify wild type or mutant centrin forms to be expressed in the Leishmania parasite contained a hemagglutinin (HA) tag sequence (24Pati U.K. Gene. 1992; 114: 285-288Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar) added in frame with centrin at the 3′-end. All the amplified products were digested with SpeI and ligated at the same site of pKSNEO (25Zhang W.W. Charest H. Ghedin E. Matlashewski G. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1996; 78: 79-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar) and transfected into the parasite. To clone LdCEN in bacterial expression vector (pQE-70) the PCR-amplified fragment was digested withSphI and BglII and cloned into SphI and BamHI site of pQE-70 in frame with the histidine-tag (His6) at the 3′-end and transformed intoE. coli M15 cells as described (26Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). The protein was expressed from E. coli, purified through Ni-agarose ion-exchange column chromatography according to the manufacturer protocol (Qiagen Inc., Valencia, CA), and the protein was used to generate polyclonal antibody in rabbits (26Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Antisera raised against two recombinant human centrins (HsCen2p and HsCen3p, both rabbit polyclonal; gifts from Dr. Michel Bornens, Institute Curie, Paris, France), C. reinhardtii centrin (CrCenp1 (20H5) mouse monoclonal; gift from Dr. J.

Salisbury, Mayo Clinic Foundation, Rochester, MN), and LdCenp (rabbit polyclonal; prepared by Spring Valley Labs, Woodbine, MD) were used to determine immunogenic cross-reactivity of the recombinant LdCenp. 100–200 ng of recombinant centrin protein was separated in a 12 or 15% SDS-PAGE gel, transferred to nitrocellulose membranes, and analyzed by Western blot (27Towbin H. Staehelin T. Falgout B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

The proteins were visualized using the SuperSignal Chemi-luminescent substrate system (Pierce). To analyze the endogenous centrin and determine its size, mid-log culture of either promastigotes or axenic amastigotes were resuspended in 20 mm HEPES buffer, protein concentration was determined by BCA (Pierce), and 20 μg of total cell protein was analyzed on SDS-PAGE by Western blot analysis using various centrin antibodies. The binding assay for45Ca was performed as described (17Joshi M. Pogue G.P. Duncan R.C. Lee N.S. Singh N.K. Atreya C.D. Dwyer D.M. Nakhasi H.L. Mol. Biochem.

Briefly, the various recombinant proteins were subjected to SDS-PAGE and transferred onto a nitrocellulose membrane. The membrane was incubated with 1 μCi/ml 45Ca in buffer containing 60 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2, and 10 mm imidazole-HCl, pH 7.0, for 10 min at the room temperature, washed with distilled water, dried, and exposed to x-ray film. To confirm the calcium binding and conformational changes of LdCenp in vivo, metal chelator EGTA (100 mm) was added to the parasite's cell lysate in 10 μl of reaction volume, incubated for 5 min at room temperature, and processed for Western blot analysis on a non-denaturing gel according to NovexTM, San Diego, CA using anti-LdCenp antibody. L. donovanipromastigotes were fixed in suspension in 4% (w/v) paraformaldehyde in PBS (50 mm Na2HPO4, 150 mm NaCl, pH 7.4) for 20 min at room temperature, washed three times in PBS, and allowed to attach to glass slides. After air drying, the slides were first immersed in ice-cold methanol (−20 °C) for 5 min, blocked for 30 min in 1% (w/v) bovine serum albumin (United States Biochemical Co., Cleveland, OH) in PBS, and incubated 1 h with either the anti-LdCenp serum (1:200 dilution) or the anti-HA serum (1:30 dilution) diluted in 1% bovine serum albumin in PBS. After three washes in PBS, cells were incubated for 1 h with affinity-purified fluorescein-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG (H+L) antibody when probed with anti-LdCenp Ab and Texas red anti-mouse IgG (H+L) antibody when probed with anti-HA serum antibody. These secondary antibodies (Vector Laboratories Inc., Burlingame, CA), were diluted 1:200-fold in PBS containing 1% bovine serum albumin. Cells were subsequently washed three times with PBS and mounted in Vectashield containing 4′6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) (Vector, Vector Lab. Inc.) to stain both nucleus and kinetoplast. Cells were examined for fluorescence under the microscope (Nikon (DIAPHOT-200), Tokoyo, Japan), with epi-fluorescence and images captured with Pixera (120ES) color digital camera. Confocal studies were conducted under 100× objective lens of Leica-DM IRBE (Leica Microsystem, Heidelberg, Germany) using krypton and argon/UV lasers. The focal plane chosen in all the cells was in the middle of the cells. The images were processed using Adobe Photoshop 5.5 (Adobe Systems Inc., Mountain View, CA). Mid-log phase promastigotes (2–4 × 107 cells/ml) were harvested by centrifugation at 3000 g for 10 min at 4 °C. Cell pellets were washed in ice-cold PBS and electroporated with the DNA using conditions as described previously (29Debrabant A. Ghedin E. Dwyer D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 16366-16372Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Transfected promastigotes were selected with minimal doses of G418 (20 μg/ml). The drug-resistant cells were used in all subsequent experiments. Promastigotes from early exponential cultures were collected, fixed in 70% ethanol, and washed with PBS. The fixed cells were treated with 100 μg/ml ribonuclease in PBS for 5 min at room temperature and stained with 50 μg/ml propidium iodide (Sigma) in PBS for 15 min on ice and analyzed on a FACScan flow cytometer (Becton Dickinson Immunocytometry Systems, San Jose, CA) and CELLQuest software. For each sample 20,000 fluorescent events were measured, and the data was analyzed using the Modfit Lt. Software was Verity Software House, Inc. (Topshan, ME). We used an arbitrarily primed polymerase chain reaction (AP-PCR) approach, as previously described (5Pogue G.P. Koul S. Lee N.S. Dwyer D.M. Nakhasi H.L. Parasitol. Res. 1995; 81: 282-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar), to isolate genes fromL. donovani that are differentially expressed during the growth and differentiation of this parasite. A 1-kb AP-PCR fragment was generated specifically using DNA isolated from L. donovaniparasites collected from an Indian Kala-azar patient. The fragment was cloned and used as a probe to analyze total RNA from the promastigotes and axenic amastigotes of L. donovani. A 2.1-kb RNA hybridizing to the AP-PCR fragment was found to be expressed significantly more in promastigotes than in axenic amastigotes (data not shown). Based on such differential expression, the AP-PCR fragment was used to screen a L. donovani cosmid DNA library. Sequence analysis of a positive clone showed an ORF that overlapped with the 3′-end of the 1-kb AP-PCR sequence. Homology search of the open reading frame revealed that it has significant similarity with centrin proteins from many organisms. The complete nucleotide and deduced amino acid sequence of the L. donovani centrin (LdCEN) gene is shown in Fig.2. The authenticity of the start site of the centrin's ORF was confirmed by performing a reverse transcription PCR, using an internal reverse primer and the splice leader forward primer. The nucleotide sequence of the reverse transcription PCR clones confirmed that the identified ORF occurs in a mature transcript of theLdCEN gene. The sequences of the amplified fragments also indicated the presence of at least two splice sites in the 5′-untranslated region of the gene (Fig. 2). Centrins and calmodulins, another closely related Ca2+-binding protein, have in general four EF-hand (Ca2+ binding) domains; however, the number of functional EF-hand domains vary among the centrins (30Huang B. Mengersen A. Lee V.D. J. Cell Biol. 1988; 107: 133-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar, 31Brugerolle G. Bricheux G. Coffe G. J. Eukaryot. Microbiol. 2000; 47: 129-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Sequence motif analysis of L. donovani centrin protein (LdCenp) predicted only two Ca2+ binding sites (EF-hand 1 and 4) (Fig. 2). In addition the LdCenp was also found to possess hydrophobic amino acids in their α-helices around both the EF-hands 1 and 4 (Fig. 2) as have been observed with other centrins. The amino acid sequence of LdCenp was analyzed by ClustalW alignment with centrins from different organisms, as shown in Fig.3 A. The calculated percent similarity shows that it is closer to HsCen2p (61%), HsCen1p (60%), or Trichomonas centrin (60%) than other centrins. The N′-terminal non-conserved domain of centrins, which is variable in length, is considered to be responsible for the functional diversity of centrins (32Salisbury J.L. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1995; 7: 39-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar, 33Bhattacharya D. Steinkotter J. Melkonian M. Plant Mol. Biol. 1993; 23: 1243-1254Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Interestingly, L. donovani centrin has a significantly small N-terminal region compared with centrins from other species (Fig. 3 A). A neighbor-joining systematic tree based on centrins of various eukaryotes was constructed, to study the phylogenetic relationship of LdCenp with centrins of other organisms. Two distinct clusters were seen in the tree (Fig. 3 B). One cluster had CrCen1p, mouse centrin, HsCen2p, and HsCen1p, and the second cluster hadGiardia centrin, CDC31p, and HsCen3p. However, centrins ofParamecium and Leishmania branched off independently from the common ancestor of all the centrins (Fig.3 B). To analyzeLdCEN mRNA levels in both promastigotes and axenic amastigotes, a Northern blot analysis was performed using total RNA obtained from the mid-log cultures of these two parasite stages. The32P-labeled LdCEN probe recognized two bands (Fig. 4 A): a major ∼1.7-kb band that expressed equally in both promastigotes and axenic amastigotes and a 2.1-kb band expressed significantly more in promastigotes than in axenic amastigotes. To determine the copy number of LdCEN in the genome, Southern blot analysis of the total genomic DNA from L. donovani promastigotes was done using the centrin coding region as a probe (Fig. 4 B). DNA digested individually with eitherSalI or EcoRI, whose sites are not present in the coding region of the centrin gene, gave a single band of ∼4.1 or 4.3 kb, respectively. On the other hand, digestion of DNA withNcoI, which has two sites at positions 1 and 203 in theLdCEN coding region, resulted in three bands of ∼0.2, 3.8, and 6.5 kb (Fig. 4 B, lane 2). These results are consistent with LdCEN being a single copy gene. To test whether LdCenp has any antigenic similarity with centrins from other organisms, a Western blot containing the recombinant LdCenp expressed in E. coli was performed with antisera raised against human centrin 2, human centrin 3, C. reinhardtii centrin 1, and LdCenp (Fig.5 A). The recombinant LdCenp cross-reacted with anti-LdCenp Ab and anti-HsCen2p Ab, but did not react with either anti-HsCen3p Ab or anti-CrCen1p Ab (Fig.5 A). To further confirm that LdCenp is expressed in the parasite and to analyze whether there are more than one form of LdCenp that may cross-react with the various anti-centrin antibodies, we tested these antibodies in a separate Western blot using cell lysates from mid-log promastigotes and axenic amastigotes (Fig. 5 B). Anti-LdCenp Ab and anti-HsCen2p Ab reacted with a 17-kDa protein in both the lysates (Fig. 5 B, lanes 1–4). However, anti-Hs-Cen2p antibody reacted with an additional protein of ∼25 kDa (Fig. 5 B, lanes 3 and 4). On the other hand, anti-HsCen3p and anti-CrCen1p antibodies reacted with different size proteins (∼19 kDa and ∼18 kDa, respectively) inLeishmania cell lysates. (Fig. 5 B, lanes 5–8). The intensity of cross-reacting centrin bands was similar in promastigotes and axenic amastigotes. These results suggest that additional centrin-like proteins may exist in the parasite. Amino acid sequence analysis of LdCenp and its comparison with known centrins revealed that it has two putative Ca2+ binding EF-hand domains (1 and 4). We tested whether LdCenp binds to Ca2+ in vitro and defined which of the predicted sites interact with Ca2+. To do so we constructed three LdCenp mutants that had either the first, the fourth, or both putative Ca2+ binding domains deleted (Fig.6 A), and expressed the full-length and mutant centrins in E. coli (Fig.6 B). The proteins were tested for their binding to45Ca in vitro. Full-length and N-terminal-deleted (LdCenp ΔN) centrins bound a similar level of45Ca (Fig. 6 C, lanes 1 and3). However, the C-terminal-deleted centrin (LdCenp ΔC) bound significantly less Ca2+ (Fig. 6 C,lane 2), and the LdCenp that lacked both the C- and the N-terminal regions (LdCenp ΔNC) did not bind calcium at all (Fig.6 C, lane 4). The PhosphorImager quantitation of45Ca-bound bands revealed that the LdCenp ΔN bound 16-fold more 45Ca than the LdCenp ΔC. The Ca2+ binding to centrin was specific, since bovine serum albumin, a non-Ca2+-binding protein, did not bind to45Ca in this assay (data not shown). These results demonstrate that the LdCenp has two Ca2+ binding sites and that Ca2+ binds preferentially to the C-terminal site. Recent reports using either NMR spectrum forC. reinhardtii centrin (34Weber C. Lee V.D. Chazin W.J. Huang B. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 15795-15802Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) or CD spectroscopy and size exclusion chromatography for Scherffelia dubia and human centrins (7Wiech H. Geier B.M.

Chem. 1996; 271: 22453-22461Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar) showed Ca2+induced conformational changes in the proteins. Having shown that the LdCenp binds to Ca2+, we analyzed the Ca2+-induced folding conformation of LdCenp. Plasmid constructs containing either full-length centrin (pKSNEO LdCEN) or N-terminal-deleted centrin (pKSNEO LdCEN ΔN) and C-terminal-deleted centrin (pKSNEO LdCEN ΔC) along with vector control (pKSNEO) were transfected into wild type L. donovani promastigote cells. Proteins were extracted from all the transfected parasites at mid-log stage and analyzed by Western blot using anti-LdCenp Ab (Fig.7 A). Though the level of expression of each form of recombinant centrin differed, each corresponded to the predicted molecular weight and was sufficiently abundant for further analysis. These protein extracts were incubated in the presence or absence of the metal chelator EGTA, separated in a non-denaturing gel, and analyzed by Western blot using antibody against either LdCenp, which recognizes the endogenous centrin of the control parasite, or antibody against HA tag sequence, which recognizes the episomally expressed centrins in the transfected parasites (Fig.7 B). Endogenous centrin after treatment with EGTA migrated faster in the gel than untreated (Fig. 7 B, lanes 1 and 2). The same EGTA-induced shift occurred with the transfected over-expressed full-length centrin (Fig. 7 B,lanes 5 and 6). However, treatment with EGTA did not affect the mobility of either LdCenp ΔN or LdCenp ΔC (Fig. 7 B, lanes 7–10). These results suggested that binding of Ca2+ to both binding sites induced a conformational change of this protein. Further, deletion of the N or C terminus resulted in a loss of the Ca2+dependent conformational change. Centrins have been implicated to have an essential function during the cell division cycle (35Paoletti A. Moudjou M. Paintrand M. Salisbury J.L. Bornens M. J. Cell Sci. 1996; 109: 3089-3102Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). As a first step toward understanding the role of LdCenp inLeishmania growth, we explored whether there is a correlation between the expression of LdCenp and the parasite growth. The level of expression of both centrin mRNA (the 1.7-kb) and protein was measured at different stages of promastigote and axenic amastigote growth. Quantitation of Northern (Fig.8 A) and Western blots (Fig.8 B) indicated that the level of LdCEN mRNA and protein, in b"

One such complex in yeast, NuA4, specifically acetylates nucleosome-associated histone H4. Recent studies have revealed that NuA4 comprises at least 11 subunits, including Yng2p, a yeast homolog of the candidate human tumor suppressor gene, ING1. Consistent with prior data, we find that cells lacking Yng2p are deficient for NuA4 activity and are temperature-sensitive. Furthermore, we show that the NuA4 complex is present in the absence of Yng2p, suggesting that Yng2p functions to maintain or activate NuA4 HAT activity. Sporulation of diploid yng2 mutant cells reveals a defect in meiotic progression, whereas synchronized yng2 mutant cells display a mitotic delay. Surprisingly, genome-wide expression analysis revealed little change from wild type. Nocodazole arrest and release relieves the mitotic defects, suggesting that Yng2p may have a critical function prior to or during metaphase. Rather than a uniform decrease in acetylated forms of histone H4, we find striking cell-to-cell heterogeneity in the loss of acetylated histone H4 in yng2mutant cells.

Recent work in budding yeast has demonstrated that multi-protein HAT-containing complexes acetylate chromatin-associated histones (3Eberharter A. John S. Grant P.A. Utley R.T. Workman J.L. Methods (Orlando). 1998; 15: 315-321Google Scholar). Histone acetylation has important roles in both growth and cell division. Mutations in the HAT catalytic subunits, as well as mutant histones lacking their amino-terminal tails, confer marked cell cycle delays in mitosis and other growth defects (4Smith E.R. Eisen A. Gu W.

The former preferentially acetylate histones H3 and H2B, whereas the NuA4 complex acetylates histone H4 and to a lesser extent H2A (8Grant P.A. Duggan L. Cote J. Roberts S.M. Brownell J.E. Candau R.

The prototypic HAT, Gcn5, is the catalytic subunit of both ADA and SAGA, whereas Sas3 and Esa1p perform that role in NuA3 and NuA4, respectively (8Grant P.A. Duggan L. Cote J. Roberts S.M.

Although biochemical properties of NuA4 are well characterized, its regulation and function in cell division is less well understood. In wild-type yeast cells, most histone H4 is fully or partially acetylated via modification of lysines at positions 5, 8, 12, and/or 16 in the histone H4 amino terminus (13Waterborg J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 13007-13011Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Although mutating the four histone H4 lysines to arginine confers dramatic growth defects (14Megee P.C. Morgan B.A. Mittman B.A. Smith M.M. Science. 1990; 247: 841-845Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar), a single lysine is sufficient to restore regulated growth (15Megee P.C. Morgan B.A. Smith M.M. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 1716-1727Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). Chromatin containing a high proportion of polyacetylated histones is considered to be more “open” or accessible to regulatory factors, whereas unacetylated chromatin is more compact and may be less active (16Grunstein M. Nature. 1997; 389: 349-352Crossref PubMed Scopus (2351) Google Scholar). In turn, acetylation may facilitate large scale conformational change that is impaired by the tighter packing of unacetylated chromatin (17Morales V. Richard-Foy H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 7230-7237Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Recent data showing that Esa1p has a relatively limited role in transcriptional regulation at specific loci but is important for large scale acetylation of chromatin (18Reid J.L. Iyer V.R. Brown P.O. Struhl K. Mol. Cell. 2000; 6: 1297-1307Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar, 19Vogelauer M. Wu J. Suka N. Grunstein M. Nature. 2000; 408: 495-498Crossref PubMed Scopus (369) Google Scholar) suggest that NuA4 has a primary role in global histone H4 acetylation and thereby in regulating changes in large scale chromatin structure and function. That recombinant Esa1p alone acetylates only free histone H4 suggests that other NuA4 subunits target this HAT to its chromatin-associated nucleosomal substrates (9Allard S. Utley R.T. Savard J. Clarke A. Grant P. Brandl C.J. Pillus L. Workman J.L. Cote J. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 5108-5119Crossref PubMed Scopus (368) Google Scholar). Thus, further insight into the function of NuA4 in cellular processes may be provided by genetic and biochemical analysis of the noncatalytic subunits. In this report, we further characterize the NuA4 subunit Yng2p, previously identified as a yeast homolog of the candidate human tumor suppressor gene ING1(12Loewith R. Meijer M. Lees-Miller S.P.

Rothstein R. Cell. 1989; 58: 409-419Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (447) Google Scholar). Yeast culture and genetic techniques were essentially as described (23Guthrie C. Fink G.R. Guide to Yeast Genetics and Molecular Biology. 194. Academic Press, Inc., San Diego1991Google Scholar). Media were obtained from United States Biological, molecular biology reagents from New England BioLabs, and chemical reagents from Sigma, unless otherwise noted. Yeast were cultured in YPD (1% yeast extract, 2% peptone, 0.3 mm adenine, and 2% glucose) or SC (synthetic complete media with 2% glucose) lacking the appropriate amino acids. A diploid strain heterozygous for a knockout of YNG2 (SKY2302) was constructed by PCR-based gene disruption as described (24Longtine M.S. McKenzie A.R. Demarini D.J. Shah N.G. Wach A. Brachat A. Philippsen P. Pringle J.R. Yeast. 1998; 14: 953-961Crossref PubMed Scopus (4084) Google Scholar) to replace the entire coding sequence of one allele of YNG2 in a wild-type diploid with the kanMX6 gene conferring G418 resistance. Transformants were sporulated and dissected to isolate YNG2 disruptants (yng2::kanMX6). YNG2and EPL1 were epitope-tagged at their carboxyl terminus with 13-Myc or 3-Ha, respectively, using a PCR-based strategy (24Longtine M.S. McKenzie A.R. Demarini D.J. Shah N.G. Wach A. Brachat A. Philippsen P. Pringle J.R. Yeast. 1998; 14: 953-961Crossref PubMed Scopus (4084) Google Scholar). All strain constructions were confirmed by PCR. A unique BglII site was introduced immediately after the start codon of YNG2 to construct GFP (see below) fusions with YNG2. The YNG2::BglII construct inserts Arg and Ser directly after the first ATG but complements a YNG2 disruption. The YNG2::BglII mutant was constructed in a centromeric LEU2 (pRS315 (25Sikorski R.S. Hieter P. Genetics. 1989; 122: 19-27Crossref PubMed Google Scholar)) or an integrating URA3 vector (pRS306 (25Sikorski R.S. Hieter P. Genetics. 1989; 122: 19-27Crossref PubMed Google Scholar)), yielding pRS315-YNG2::BglII (SKB4302) and pRS306-YNG2::BglII (SKB4303). A mutant GFP, mgfp6 (26Haseloff J. Methods Cell Biol. 1999; 58: 139-151Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), a kind gift of J. Haseloff, was amplified and cloned via in-frame BamHI sites into BglII-digested SKB4303 to construct pRS306-GFP-YNG2 (SKB4308). This GFP fusion complements a YNG2 disruption. Cells of the relevant genotypes were grown in YPD overnight at 22 °C then diluted to an A600 nm of ∼0.05–0.1 in fresh YPD and allowed to grow for 3–4 h in the presence of 5 μm alpha mating peptide (αf, Research Genetics) or 15 μg/ml of nocodazole at 22 °C. Alternatively, cells were incubated at 22 °C in the presence of αf or nocodazole for 2 h and then shifted to 37 °C for 1–1.5 h. Trichostatin A (TSA) in methanol (5 mg/ml) was added directly to cultures to a final concentration of 30 μg/ml. Cells were released from αf or nocodazole arrest by centrifugation, a YPD wash, and then resuspension in liquid YPD at 22 °C or in YPD prewarmed to 37 °C. Cells were collected at 20-min intervals (or as described under “Results”) for flow cytometry and Northern and Western analyses (see “Protein Techniques”). For flow cytometry, cells were fixed in 70% ethanol, resuspended in 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), sonicated, treated with 1 mg/ml RNase A at 50 °C for 1 h, and stained with 0.05 mg/ml propidium iodide. Approximately 2–3 × 104cells were analyzed using CellQuest software and a FACSCalibur flow cytometer (Becton Dickinson) for each time point. For Northern analysis, 25 ml of culture were collected, and RNA was extracted as described (27Cross F.R. Tinkelenberg A.H. Cell. 1991; 65: 875-883Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar), separated on a 1% formaldehyde-agarose gel, and transferred onto a nylon membrane (Osmonics). Probes labeled with [32P]dATP or -dCTP (ICN) were generated with PCR or Klenow and used to detect YNG2, CLN2,CLB5, CLB1, and CLB2 mRNA. A PhosphorImager detection system and ImageQuant software (Molecular Dynamics) were used for analysis of blots. Strains were grown in YPD media to mid-log phase and then harvested. RNA was collected from cells using a Qiagen Rneasy kit (Qiagen). 24 μg of total RNA was used as template for double-stranded cDNA synthesis using a Life Technologies SuperScript Double Strand cDNA synthesis kit and protocol described by Affymetrix (Affymetrix GeneChip Expression Analysis Technical Manual). Briefly, total RNA is synthesized into double-stranded cDNA by means of the SuperScript Choice system (Life Technologies, Inc.) and a T7-(dT) 24 Primer (Genset Corp.). Samples were then extracted with phenol:chloroform:isoamyl alcohol (25:24:1) and precipitated with 7.5 m ammonium acetate and ethanol. An Enzo Bioarray Highyield RNA transcript labeling kit (Enzo Diagnostics, Inc.) was used according to manufacturer's instructions to transcribe biotin-labeled cRNA, which was purified using an RNeasy kit (Qiagen). These products were fragmented into 50–200-nucleotide pieces with a Trizma base solution as described by Affymetrix. 5 μg of fragmented cRNA was hybridized on an Affymetrix Test 2 array. After washing, the array was stained with streptavidin-phycoerythrin (Molecular Probes), amplified by biotinylated anti-streptavidin (Vector Laboratories, Inc.), and then scanned on an HP Gene-array scanner. The intensity for each feature of the array was captured with Affymetrix GeneChip software according to standard Affymetrix procedures. All 3′-5′ ratios fell between normal parameters. 15 μg of fragmented cRNA was assayed on Yeast Genome S98 arrays (Affymetrix) utilizing the same protocol and equipment. Data were analyzed on the Affymetrix MicroArray Suite data analysis package. Of a total of 9159 probe sets representing ∼7000 genes, including nonannotated open reading frames (ORFs) from SAGE analysis, 7616 (83.2%) were detected and exceeded the probe pair threshold determined by Affymetrix GeneChip software. The 54 ORFs that decreased includes 18 transcripts scored by Affymetrix MicroArray Suite as “no change.” Nonetheless, these were included for completeness. Molecular function and gene names for each open reading frame was obtained from the Saccharomyces Genome Data base web page (at genome-www.stanford.edu/Saccharomyces). For protein extracts, 25–50 ml of culture at A600 nm ∼0.1 was pelleted, washed, and resuspended in buffer containing protease inhibitors (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 10% glycerol, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 2 mm EDTA, 150 mm NaCl, 500 μmbenzamidine HCl, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 μg/ml pepstatin A, 1 mm phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride). An equal volume of 0.5-mm glass beads was added, and the mixture was vortexed at high speed for 30 min at 4 °C and centrifuged at 20,000 ×g at 4 °C to clear the lysate. For Western analysis, 50 μg of protein, determined by Bradford assay (Bio-Rad), was loaded per lane on a 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gel and then transferred to Hybond C nitrocellulose (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Blots were processed as described by the manufacturer for enhanced chemiluminescence (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and exposed to Hyperfilm ECL (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The following concentrations of antibodies were used to detect Yng2p-Myc, Epl1p-Ha, Esa1p, and Clb2p: 1/1000 of A14 anti-Myc polyclonal (Santa Cruz), 1/500 of 16B12 anti-Ha polyclonal (Covance), 1/200 of anti-Esa1p (Santa Cruz), and 1/2000 anti-Clb2p (28Ahn S.H. Acurio A. Kron S.J. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 3301-3316Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). For immunoprecipitation reactions, 3 μg of a monoclonal anti-Myc antibody (9E10, Covance) or anti-Ha antibody (12CA5, Roche Molecular Biochemicals) was added to 400 μl of total yeast extract (0.2–1.0 mg/ml) and incubated on a rocker at 4 °C for 2–3 h or overnight. Then, 50 μl of a 50% slurry of protein A-Sepharose beads (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), washed once with lysis buffer, was added and incubated on a mixer at 4 °C for 2–3 h. Immune complexes were collected by centrifugation at 800 × g for 2 min, washed three times with 1 ml of lysis buffer, and then resuspended in 1× SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis sample buffer (62.5 mm Tris, pH 6.8, 10% glycerol, 2% SDS, 16 mmdithiothreitol, 0.004% bromphenol blue) or washed once with 1 ml of HAT buffer for HAT assays (see below). HAT assays were performed essentially as described (29Mizzen C.A. Brownell J.E. Cook R.G. Allis C.D. Methods Enzymol. 1999; 304: 675-696Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Immunoprecipitates were incubated at 30 °C for 45 min with 50 μg of calf thymus histones (type IIA, Sigma), 0.3 μCi of [3H]acetyl-CoA (ICN) in HAT buffer A (50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 8.0, 10% glycerol, 10 mmsodium butyrate, 1 mm phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 1.5 μm acetyl-CoA in a total volume of 50–80 μl. Reactions were terminated by the addition of 4× SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis sample buffer and separated on a 15 or 18% SDS-polyacrylamide gel, transferred onto polyvinylidene difluoride (Millipore), treated for fluorography using En3Hance (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) as described by the manufacturer, and exposed to Hyperfilm ECL (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) at −80 °C for 1 to 2 weeks. Cultures grown to A600 nm ∼0.2–0.4 at 22 °C or 37 °C were fixed by the addition of 1/10 volume of formaldehyde (37% w/v) directly to the media and incubation at 22 °C or 30 °C for 1–2 h, and were then washed and resuspended in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS, 50 mm sodium phosphate, 150 mmNaCl, pH 7.5). To detect acetylated H4 isoforms, fixed cells in PBS were spheroplasted for 1 h at 30 °C with 0.05 mg/ml zymolyase (Seikagaku) in 1 m sorbitol, washed three times, immobilized onto polylysine slides (Sigma), and blocked in 2% powdered milk in PBS containing 0.2% Tween 20 (PBS/Tween-20) overnight at 4 °C. Cells were then treated with the following antibody dilutions for 2 h at 22 °C: 1/100 of anti-H4K8, 1/100 of anti-H4 acetylated at lysines 5, 8, 12, and 16, 1/1000 of anti-H4K12, and 1/1000 of anti-acH3 (Upstate Biotechnology, Inc.). Slides were washed three times with PBS/Tween-20 before treatment for 1 h at 22 °C with a 1/1000 dilution of goat anti-rabbit secondary antibodies conjugated to Alexa 488 (Molecular Probes) in PBS/Tween-20. Afterward, slides were washed three times with PBS/Tween-20. Anti-fade reagent (2.5% 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane in 70% glycerol containing 0.5 μg/ml 4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI)) and coverslips were applied, and fluorescence was visualized using a Zeiss AxioSkop microscope equipped with epifluorescence optics, High Q fluorescein, and DAPI filter sets (Chroma Technologies) and a Sensys CCD camera (Photometrix) controlled with IP-Lab Spectrum software (Signal Analytics). Cells carrying GFP-YNG2 (SKY2303) were grown to A600 nm ∼0.2–0.4 in synthetic media at 30 °C and washed with water. To examine GFP-Yng2p localization through the cell cycle, cells were subjected to an αf arrest-release regimen. Samples were collected at 30-min intervals after release and imaged using a High Q fluorescein filter set (Chroma) and the microscope system described above. Cells carrying GFP-Yng2p were grown in the presence of DAPI (2.5 μg/ml) in synthetic media for 3–4 h for colocalization studies. Recently, Loewith et al. (12Loewith R. Meijer M. Lees-Miller S.P. Riabowol K. Young D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 3807-3816Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar) reported that Yng2p is associated with both Tra1, an ataxia-telangiectasia mutated (ATM)-like subunit of NuA4, and Esa1p, the catalytic subunit of NuA4 (9Allard S. Utley R.T. Savard J. Clarke A. Grant P. Brandl C.J. Pillus L. Workman J.L. Cote J. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 5108-5119Crossref PubMed Scopus (368) Google Scholar). Independently, by two-hybrid screening and co-immunoprecipitation (data not shown), we found that Yng2p physically interacts with Epl1p, a stable subunit of the NuA4 HAT complex (11Galarneau L. Nourani A. Boudreault A.A. Zhang Y. Heliot L. Allard S. Savard J. Lane W.S. Stillman D.J. Cote J. Mol. Cell. 2000; 5: 927-937Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). Moreover, by Western analysis of total histone protein, Loewith et al. (12Loewith R. Meijer M. Lees-Miller S.P. Riabowol K. Young D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 3807-3816Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar) observed decreased levels of acetylated forms of histone H4 in YNG2 deletion mutants. These results suggest that Yng2p is a bona fide NuA4 subunit and is important for H4 acetylation in vivo. However, Yng2p may be important for NuA4 HAT catalytic activity, may act to target NuA4 to its chromosomal histone H4 substrate, or may serve some other role. Given that YNG2is not essential for vegetative growth at 22 °C (12Loewith R. Meijer M. Lees-Miller S.P. Riabowol K. Young D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 3807-3816Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar), we sought to assay the NuA4 HAT activity in YNG2-deficient cells. Because Epl1p is a stable subunit of NuA4 (11Galarneau L. Nourani A. Boudreault A.A. Zhang Y. Heliot L. Allard S. Savard J. Lane W.S. Stillman D.J. Cote J. Mol. Cell. 2000; 5: 927-937Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar) and the expression of Epl1p-Ha in yng2 mutants was comparable with that in wild-type cells (Fig. 1 A), immunoprecipitation of Epl1p-Ha provided a means of assaying NuA4 HAT activity in vitro. Epl1p-Ha immune complexes from wild-type cells possessed ∼5-fold greater H4 HAT activity than Epl1p-Ha immune complexes isolated from Yng2p-deficient cells (Fig. 1 B). To determine whether Yng2p is necessary for full NuA4 activity and/or assembly in vivo, we examined Epl1p-Ha immune complexes for the presence of Esa1p in wild-type cells versus yng2mutant cells. Strikingly, we found that Esa1p coimmunoprecipitated with Epl1p-Ha to a similar degree in both wild-type and yng2mutant cells (Fig. 1 C). These data suggest that Yng2p is not necessary for NuA4 complex formation but is required for wild-type levels of NuA4 H4 HAT activity. The physiological processes that Yng2p may mediate remain unclear. Previous studies by Megee et al. (15Megee P.C. Morgan B.A. Smith M.M. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 1716-1727Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar) demonstrate that yeast cells harboring a non-acetylatable mutant histone H4 allele delay in G2 and mitosis. Moreover, Clarke et al.(5Clarke A.S. Lowell J.E. Jacobson S.J. Pillus L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 2515-2526Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar) showed that cells carrying a temperature-sensitive allele of ESA1 display a G2/M arrest. To examine whether a similar delay might underlie the slow growth at 22 °C and temperature sensitivity at 37 °C of yng2 mutant cells (12Loewith R. Meijer M. Lees-Miller S.P. Riabowol K. Young D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 3807-3816Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar), we performed flow cytometry on YNG2 wild-type and mutant cells synchronized by αf-induced G1 arrest. To limit growth to a single cell cycle, αf was added back after cells entered S phase, trapping cells in the subsequent G1phase. Virtually all wild-type cells released at 22 °C completed DNA synthesis by 60 min, progressed through mitosis, and reentered G1 as indicated by the complete return to a 1n DNA peak within 140 min (Fig.2 A, left). Under the same conditions, yng2 mutants completed S phase with near wild-type kinetics. However, cells with 2 n DNA content persisted and only began to reenter G1 at 160 min (compare Fig. 2 B, left with Fig. 2 A, left). Furthermore, 45% of yng2 mutant cells did not exit from the 2n DNA content fraction for the duration of the experiment (Fig. 2 B, left). At 37 °C, wild-type cells completed DNA replication by 40 min, promptly entered mitosis, and began to return to G1 by 80 min (Fig. 2 A, right). yng2mutants exhibited a brief delay at the onset of S phase but then completed DNA replication by 60 min (Fig. 2 B, right). However, a long mitotic arrest ensued. Although some yng2mutant cells were able to reenter G1 by 120 min, ∼48% of yng2 mutant cells persisted with a 2 n DNA content for the duration of the experiment (compare Fig. 2 B, right with 3 A, right). These data suggest that the growth defect observed in yng2 mutant cells is largely because of slow mitotic progression. Previous studies by Park and Szostak (30Park E.C. Szostak J.W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 4932-4934Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar) showed that sporulation efficiency is dramatically reduced in amino-terminal histone H4 mutants, suggesting that yng2 mutants might also be defective for meiosis. To address this possibility, we determined sporulation efficiency for diploid wild-type or yng2homozygous mutant cells. After a 3-day incubation on sporulation media, only ∼1.5% of yng2 mutant cells formed four-spore asci compared with ∼30% in wild-type cells (Fig. 2 C). Staining the yng2 mutant cells with DAPI revealed that, except for the few cells that successfully formed four spores, yng2mutant cells arrested unbudded and with a single nuclear mass (Fig.2 C), suggesting that Yng2p-dependent NuA4 activity is critical for early meiotic progression. Histone acetylation has been shown to be important for transcriptional activation (31Brownell J.E. Zhou J. Ranalli T. Kobayashi R. Edmondson D.G. Roth S.Y. Allis C.D. Cell. 1996; 84: 843-851Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1273) Google Scholar, 32Kuo M.H. Zhou J. Jambeck P. Churchill M.E. Allis C.D. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 627-639Crossref PubMed Scopus (394) Google Scholar). In general, increased histone acetylation is associated with highly expressed genes, whereas deacetylation is coupled with transcriptional repression (33Struhl K. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 599-606Crossref PubMed Scopus (1530) Google Scholar). We hypothesized that hypoacetylation, leading to decreased expression of mitotic cyclins, might underlie the cell cycle delay in yng2 mutants. We performed Northern analyses using wild-type and yng2 mutants synchronously released from αf-mediated G1 arrest at 22 °C. The G1 cyclin CLN2 appeared with kinetics similar to the wild type but persisted longer, the S phase cyclin CLB5 is expressed at nearly normal levels and with similar kinetics to wild-type cells, and the expression of CLB2 in yng2 mutants began later and peaked at a lower level but persisted longer than in wild-type cells (Fig.3 A). In addition, transcription of CLB1 was not detectable in yng2mutants but occurred with similar kinetics and abundance as CLB2 in wild-type cells. These changes in timing and abundance correspond to the kinetics of S phase entry and mitotic progression revealed by flow cytometry (Fig. 3 B). With a view toward a comprehensive and quantitative examination of transcription in yng2 mutants, we used Affymetrix DNA oligonucleotide microarray analysis to compare genome-wide expression levels between asynchronously growing wild-type and yng2mutant cells at 22 °C. 83% of all probe sets were detected in this experiment.

At the current stage of analysis of our results there is insufficient evidence to determine whether the effect seen in space was related to removal from 24-hour periodicities and whether the circadian timekeeping mechanism, or merely its expression, was affected."

The splicing reaction takes place via a two-step transesterification mechanism involving nucleophilic attacks of phosphodiester bonds and creation of new bonds resulting in the formation of mature mRNA that is then exported to the cytoplasm for use in protein synthesis (for review see Ref. 1Staley J.P. Guthrie C. Cell. 1998; 92: 15-26Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (910) Google Scholar). Splicing is catalyzed by a large ribonucleoprotein complex made up of over a hundred proteins called the spliceosome. The spliceosome complex contains four ribonucleoprotein (snRNP)1 particles (U1, U2, U5, and U4/U6), each of which contains the corresponding small nuclear RNA and a set of specific and common proteins (2Krämer A.

Spliceosome assembly involves the sequential association of the snRNP particles and other proteins onto the pre-mRNA substrate prior to catalysis (reviewed in Ref. 5Reed R. Palandjian L. Krainer A.R. Eukaryotic mRNA Processing. Oxford University Press, New York1997: 103-129Google Scholar). Several recent studies have suggested that both the human proteins CDC5L and PLRG1 and their respective homologues in yeast are in a large complex containing other pre-mRNA splicing factors (6Neubauer G.

The possible involvement of the human proteins in pre-mRNA splicing was first suggested when both proteins were identified by mass spectrometry in purified spliceosomes assembled on adeno-pre-mRNA in vitro (6Neubauer G. King A. Rappsilber J. Calvio C. Watson M. Ajuh P. Sleeman J. Lamond A. Mann M. Nat. Genet. 1998; 20: 46-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (421) Google Scholar). However, other cellular roles for CDC5L have also been proposed; for example, it has been suggested that CDC5L may also be involved in transcription because of sequence similarities in the amino-terminal domain of the protein with the proto-oncogenic transcription factor, c-Myb (11Ohi R. McCollum D. Hirani B. Den Haese G.J. Zhang X. Burke J.D. Turner K. Gould K.L. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 471-483Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar, 12Bernstein H.S. Coughlin S.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 5833-5837Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Also, the Arabidopsis thaliana homologue of this protein (AtCDC5), when overexpressed in Schizosaccharomyces pombe, can complement a growth-defective phenotype of an S. pombe cdc5+temperature-sensitive mutant. A sequence-specific DNA binding activity has been reported for AtCDC5 (13Hirayama T. Shinozaki K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 13371-13376Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). A possible role for this protein in the regulation of the cell division cycle was observed in a genetic screen of S. pombe for cell division cycle mutants. The study indicated that the cdc5+ gene encodes an essential protein and that the function of the gene may be required in the G2 phase of the cell cycle (11Ohi R. McCollum D. Hirani B. Den Haese G.J. Zhang X. Burke J.D. Turner K. Gould K.L. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 471-483Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). More recently, it has been shown that overexpression of CDC5L in mammalian cells shortened the G2 phase of the cell cycle. Also, a dominant negative mutant of the protein lacking the activation domain slowed G2 progression and delayed entry into mitosis (12Bernstein H.S. Coughlin S.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 5833-5837Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). The human protein PLRG1, recently identified as a component of the CDC5L complex, is highly homologous to the A. thaliana PRL1 gene product. The PRL1 protein has been shown to be essential for the regulation of glucose and hormone responses in A. thaliana(14Nemeth K. Salchert K. Putnoky P. Bhalerao R. Konc-Kalman Z. Stankovic-Stangeland B. Bako L. Mathur J. Okresz L. Stabel S. Geigenberger P. Stitt M. Redei G.P. Schell J. Koncz C. . 1998; 12: 3059-3073Google Scholar). Mutations in PRL1 have pleiotropic phenotypes in A. thaliana. For example, a prl1 mutation can cause transcriptional de-repression of glucose-responsive genes; augment the sensitivity of the plants to growth hormones such as cytokinin, abscissic acid, ethylene, and auxin; stimulate the accumulation of sugars and starch in the leaves of the plants; and inhibit root elongation (14Nemeth K. Salchert K. Putnoky P. Bhalerao R. Konc-Kalman Z. Stankovic-Stangeland B. Bako L. Mathur J. Okresz L. Stabel S. Geigenberger P. Stitt M. Redei G.P. Schell J. Koncz C. . 1998; 12: 3059-3073Google Scholar). In both A. thaliana and COS-1 cells, PRL1 shows nuclear localization and interacts with ATHKAP2, an α-importin nuclear import receptor (14Nemeth K. Salchert K. Putnoky P. Bhalerao R. Konc-Kalman Z. Stankovic-Stangeland B. Bako L. Mathur J. Okresz L. Stabel S. Geigenberger P. Stitt M. Redei G.P. Schell J. Koncz C. . 1998; 12: 3059-3073Google Scholar). PLRG1 and the PRL1 protein both contain seven copies each of the phylogenetically conserved WD repeat domains that were first characterized in β-transducin (15Neer E.J. Schmidt C.J. Nambudripad R. Smith T.F. Nature. 1994; 371: 297-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (1292) Google Scholar). Proteins with WD domains are thought to have regulatory functions in the cell as well as being involved in protein-protein interactions. These WD domain proteins have been identified in a variety of species, from human to the facultatively thermophilic actinomycete Thermospora curvata (16Janda L. Tichy P. Spizek J. Petricek M. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 1487-1489Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 17Smith T.F. Gaitatzes C. Saxena K. Neer E.J. Trends Biochem.

In a phenotypic screen for cell cycle mutants of an A. thaliana cDNA library in fission yeast,PRL1 was identified as one of 11 genes that can cause severe morphological changes in the yeast. This was interpreted to indicate that PRL1 may be involved in cell shape maintenance and/or regulation of the cell cycle (18Xia G. Ramachandran S. Hong Y. Chan Y.S. Simanis V. Chua N.H. Plant J. 1996; 10: 761-769Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). More recently, it has been shown that mutations in the PLRG1 homologue in S. pombe;prp5+results in defects in pre-mRNA splicing and also blocks progression of the cell division cycle at the G2/M phase (19Potashkin J. Kim D. Fons M. Humphrey T. Frendewey D. Curr. Genet. 1998; 34: 153-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). In yeast it has been demonstrated that cells lacking cdc5+function are defective in pre-mRNA splicing (8McDonald W.H. Ohi R. Smelkova N. Frendewey D. Gould K.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 5352-5362Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). The CDC5L gene product is highly conserved across species, and homologues have been identified in several eukaryotic species including S. pombe, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Caenorhabditis elegans, Drosophila melanogaster, and Xenopus laevis (7Tsai W.Y. Chow Y.T. Chen H.R. Huang K.T. Hong R.I. Jan S.P. Kuo N.Y. Tsao T.Y. Chen C.H. Cheng S.C. J. Biol.

Stankovic-Stangeland B. Bako L. Mathur J. Okresz L. Stabel S. Geigenberger P. Stitt M. Redei G.P. Schell J. Koncz C. . 1998; 12: 3059-3073Google Scholar), suggesting essential cellular functions for these proteins. However, a direct role for PLRG1 in pre-mRNA splicing has not yet been shown despite its presence in splicing factor complexes. We have recently purified a protein complex associated with CDC5L from HeLa nuclear extracts and shown that this complex contains at least six “core” proteins (10Ajuh P. Kuster B. Panov K. Zomerdijk J.C.B.M. Mann M. Lamond A.I. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 6569-6581Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). Two of the core proteins, which also are the most highly conserved across species, are CDC5L and PLRG1. We show here that these two proteins will interact directly in vitro and provide evidence that a direct interaction between CDC5L and PLRG1 is essential for pre-mRNA splicing. The PLRG1 and CDC5L cDNAs were cloned from a HeLa cDNA library (CLONTECH) by PCR. Primers were designed for the amino and carboxyl termini of the proteins using previously deposited sequences for these cDNAs in the GenBankTM data base (PLRG1 accession number AF044333 and CDC5L accession number U86753). The PLRG1 primers contained BamHI and XhoI sites added to the 5′ ends of the 5′ and 3′ end primers, respectively. The CDC5L PCR primers contained SalI sites added to their 5′ ends. The PCR products were purified on a PCR purification column (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Purified PCR products from CDC5L and PLRG1 cDNAs were digested with the appropriate enzymes and cloned using standard methods into the compatible sites of the vectors pGEX-4T1 (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), pET-30a (Novagen), pEGFP-C1, pEYFP-C1 (CLONTECH) and pSG-9M, a modified form of the plasmid pSG5 (22Green S. Issemann I. Sheer E. Nucleic Acids Res. 1988; 16: 369Crossref PubMed Scopus (546) Google Scholar) containing an amino-terminal Myc tag. The plasmid DNA was sequenced on the Applied Biosytems 377 automated DNA sequencer using the Taq dye terminator cycle sequencing method according to the manufacturer’s instructions. pGEX-4T1 and pET-30a were used for expression of recombinant protein in Escherichia coli, whereas the pEGFP-C1 and pSG-9M vectors were used for expression in mammalian cells (HeLa). pET-30a clones were also used for in vitrotranscription/translation experiments. cDNAs cloned into the pGEX-4T1 vector were used to transform E. coli BL21(DE3). Overnight cultures were grown from single colonies and then diluted 1:10 in fresh LB medium with ampicillin (100 μg/ml) and grown at 30 °C to an A600 of 0.7–1.0 before induction with 0.1 mmisopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside. Three hours post-induction, cells were pelleted and resuspended in 10 ml of PBS, 0.5% Triton X-100 containing protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Cell lysis was achieved by sonication. The cell debris was removed by centrifugation at 10,000 ×g for 10 min. Pre-swollen glutathione-Sepharose beads pre-equilibrated in PBS were added to the supernatant (1 ml per liter of culture). The beads were incubated with the crude protein extract for 2 h at 4 °C with rocking. Beads were collected and washed 3 times in PBS, 0.5% Triton X-100 followed by 3 washes in PBS. Proteins were eluted from the beads by incubating in 25 mmglutathione in 50 mm Tris·Cl, pH 8.0. The proteins were dialyzed into a buffer containing 20 mm HEPES, pH 8.0, 20% glycerol, 100 mm KCl, 0.2 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, or PBS and stored at −80 °C. pET-30a cDNA clones were treated as above for expression except that 1 mmisopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside was used for induction and the cells were grown at 37 °C prior to induction at 30 °C. The expressed protein was bound to nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose beads (Qiagen) and the beads washed with a buffer containing 20 mm imidazole, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 50 mmNaH2PO4, and 300 mm NaCl (pH 8.0). Recombinant protein was eluted from beads using the same buffer as above except that the concentration of imidazole was increased to 250 mm. Eluted proteins were dialyzed in the same buffer as above. Peptide antibodies to CDC5L and PLRG1 were prepared as described previously (10Ajuh P. Kuster B. Panov K. Zomerdijk J.C.B.M. Mann M. Lamond A.I. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 6569-6581Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). Antibodies to bacterially expressed PLRG1 and CDC5L were also produced in sheep and rabbits (SAPU, Lanarkshire, Scotland, UK). Nuclear extracts used in the splicing assays were obtained commercially from Computer Cell Culture Center (Mons, Belgium). Splicing assays were done using uniformly labeled, capped pre-mRNAs incubated with nuclear extract as described previously (23Lamond A.I. Konarska M. Sharp P.A. Genes Dev. 1987; 1: 532-543Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). In experiments where recombinant proteins were added to the splicing reactions, proteins that gave low yields during expression in E. coli and purification by affinity chromatography were concentrated using centrifugal filter devices (molecular weight cut-off 3500) (Microcon) according to the manufacturer’s instructions before addition to splicing reactions. The adeno-pre-mRNA was transcribed from Sau3AI-digested plasmid pBSAd1 (24Konarska M. Sharp P.A. Cell. 1987; 49: 763-774Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar). The splicing reactions were loaded on a 10% polyacrylamide, 8 m urea denaturing gel and run in 1× TBE to separate the splicing products. When samples were to be used for the analysis of splicing complexes, the reactions were loaded onto a polyacrylamide-agarose composite gel (25Konarska M.M. Sharp P.A. Cell. 1986; 46: 845-855Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar) and run for about 5 h at 25 mA. Immunoprecipitations of the spliceosomal proteins from nuclear extract were done using affinity-purified peptide antibodies. 50 μl of nuclear extract (4–5 mg/ml) were pre-cleared for 1 h at 4 °C on 25 μl of settled protein G- or A-Sepharose (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) or protein G/A-agarose beads (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) that had been preincubated with 10 μg of sheep preimmune IgG. The pre-cleared nuclear extract was diluted 10 times (except in immunodepletion experiments) with PBS buffer containing 0.5% Triton X-100 before adding to protein G-Sepharose or -agarose beads (25 μl) that had been preincubated with 30 pools of antibody for 1 h at 4 °C. Immunoprecipitations were carried out at 4 °C for 2–16 h. The immunoprecipitates were washed three times at 4 °C with 1 ml of PBS containing 0.5% Triton X-100. Protein G beads carrying the immune complexes were collected after each wash by centrifugation at 1500 × g for 1 min. For immunodepletion experiments a higher amount of antibody (0.33 nmol/250 μg) of HeLa nuclear extract was used during the immunoprecipitation step. SDS-PAGE gel analysis was done as described previously (26Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207129) Google Scholar). For immunoblotting, the washed immunoprecipitates were resuspended in 50 μl of 2× SDS-PAGE loading buffer and heated at 95 °C for 5 min. Approximately 10–15 μl of the supernatant were loaded on a 10% SDS-PAGE gel or 4–12% pre-cast gradient gel (NOVEX). The separated proteins were transferred onto Hybond-C extra membrane (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) by electroblotting. The membranes carrying the transferred proteins were blocked with 5% non-fat milk powder in PBS, 0.3% Tween 20. The membranes were incubated with primary antibody for 1–16 h at room temperature, washed with blocking buffer, and incubated with the appropriate secondary antibody. The primary antibodies were used at the following dilutions: anti-CDC5L (1:1000), anti-PLRG1(1:1000), and anti-SPF30 (dilution 1:2000). After washing the blots in blocking buffer 3–4 times (5 min per wash at room temperature), the membranes were then incubated with a secondary antibody to which has been covalently coupled horseradish peroxidase or alkaline phosphatase. Protein bands were detected by developing blots using the ECL kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) according to the manufacturer’s instructions or using nitro blue tetrazolium (60 μl of a 30 mg/ml solution)/5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate (60 μl of a 25 mg/ml solution) in 10 ml of alkaline phosphatase buffer (0.1 mNaHCO3, 1 mm MgCl2, pH 9.8) for colorimetric detection on the membrane. The in vitro transcription and translation experiments were done with the T7 or SP6 RNA polymerase transcription/translation systems that used rabbit reticulocyte lysate (TNT Systems, Promega) andl-[35S]methionine (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, AG1094) to produce 35S-labeled proteins according to the manufacturer's recommendations. Aliquots of these reactions were used for protein-protein interaction assays as described below. About 0.2 nmol of the appropriate GST fusion recombinant protein was mixed with an equimolar amount of hexahistidine-tagged bacterially expressed protein or 8–10 μl of the in vitro translation reaction above and incubated in binding buffer (250 mm NaCl, 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 2% bovine serum albumin) at room temperature for 15 min. The binding reaction was then added to 25 μl of glutathione-Sepharose beads or antibody-bound protein G-Sepharose and mixed at 4 °C for 1–2 h. The beads were washed 3–4 times in 1 ml of PBS, 0.1% Triton X-100 and resuspended in 25 μl of 2× SDS-PAGE loading dye before heating at 70 °C for 10 min or 95 °C for 5 min. Bound proteins were separated on a 10 or 12% SDS-PAGE gel after which the gel was fixed in 50% methanol, 10% acetic acid for 30 min. The fixed gel was then soaked in a fluorographic reagent (Amplify, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) for 30 min before drying. Protein bands were detected by autoradiography at −80 °C after 4–16 h. For antibody probing, the gels containing proteins from the antibody beads were treated as described above under “SDS-PAGE and Western Blotting.” Point mutations generating stop codons were inserted into the cDNAs at ∼100-amino acid intervals by PCR using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. The cDNAs were sequenced to confirm the presence of the appropriate mutations. Regions of the cDNAs involved in binding and overlapping regions were subcloned into the vectors pGEX-4T1 (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) or pET-30a (Novagen) for use in E. coli expression and protein-protein interaction assays. HeLa cells were grown in Dulbecco’s modified Eagles’ medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum and 100 units/ml penicillin and streptomycin (Life Technologies, Inc.). For immunofluorescence assays, cells were grown on coverslips and transfected using Effectene transfection reagent (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Cells were washed in PBS and fixed for 5 min in 3.7% (w/v) paraformaldehyde in CSK buffer (10 mm PIPES, pH 6.8; 10 mm NaCl; 300 mm sucrose; 3 mm MgCl2; 2 mm EDTA) at room temperature. Permeabilization was performed with 1% Triton X-100 in PBS for 15 min at room temperature. Cells were incubated with primary antibodies diluted in PBS with 1% goat serum for 35 min to 1 h, washed 3 times for 10 min with PBS, incubated for 35 min to 1 h with the appropriate secondary antibodies diluted in PBS with 1% goat serum, and washed 3 times for 10 min with PBS. Antibodies used were Y12 monoclonal antibody (anti-Sm) (27Petterson I. Hinterberger M. Mimori T. Gottlieb E. Steitz J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 5907-5914Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) (dilution 1:500), rabbit anti-CDC5L (1:500), and rabbit anti-PLRG1. Tetramethylrhodamine B isothiocyanate-conjugated goat anti-mouse and Cy5-conjugated goat anti-rabbit secondary antibodies were also used (Jackson ImmunoResearch). Microscopy and image analysis was carried out using a Zeiss DeltaVision Restoration microscope as described previously (28Platani M. Goldberg I. Swedlow J.R. Lamond A.I. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 151: 1561-1574Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). The human CDC5L and PLRG1 proteins can be co-purified as part of a multiprotein complex as can their homologues in yeast (8McDonald W.H. Ohi R. Smelkova N. Frendewey D. Gould K.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 5352-5362Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar,10Ajuh P. Kuster B. Panov K. Zomerdijk J.C.B.M. Mann M. Lamond A.I. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 6569-6581Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). We also observed that CDC5L and PLRG1 are highly phylogenetically conserved proteins in the core CDC5L associated complex in HeLa nuclear extracts. These observations prompted us to investigate whether all of the PLRG1 protein in HeLa nuclear extract was associated with CDC5L. A GST-PLRG1 fusion protein was expressed in E. coli, purified, and used to raise antibodies in sheep and rabbits for use in the analysis of the CDC5L-PLRG1 interaction. The immune serum obtained recognizes the protein in HeLa nuclear extract as well as the bacterially expressed protein (Fig. 1 B lane 1, Fig. 3 A, lane 3, and data not shown).Figure 3CDC5L interacts directly with PLRG1 in vitro. A, GST-PLRG1 (lanes 2 and 3) was incubated for 20 min at room temperature with 0.5 mg of HeLa nuclear extract. An immunoprecipitation was performed on the reaction either using control preimmune serum, CTRL1 (lane 2) or anti-CDC5L antibodies (lane 3). The blotted proteins from the immunoprecipitates were probed with anti-PLRG1 antibodies. Lane 4 shows a pull-down experiment in which GST-CDC5L was incubated with nuclear extracts as above and the interacting proteins pulled down using 25–30 μl of glutathione-Sepharose beads. The blot was probed with anti-GST-PLRG1 antibodies. Lane 5 is a control reaction using GST alone in the pull-down experiment instead of GST-CDC5L. Lane 1contained ∼40 μg of HeLa nuclear extract. Note that the anti-GST-PLRG1 antiserum (which also contains GST antibodies) recognizes full-length GST-CDC5L and a minor band in lane 4corresponding to a partial cleavage product of the GST-CDC5L protein used in the pull-down experiment as well as endogenous PLRG1.B, GST-PLRG1 (0.2 nmol) was used to pull downl-[35S]methionine-labeled in vitrotranslated CDC5L (5–8 μl). Lanes 1 and 2 are duplicate samples of the pull-down experiment, and lanes 3and 4 are controls using glutathione-Sepharose beads alone and GST, respectively, for pull-downs. Lane 5 contained about 30–40% of the input labeled CDC5L. C, GST-PLRG1 was used to pull down bacterially expressed His-tagged CDC5L. Lanes 1 and 2 contained duplicate samples of the pull-down of His-CDC5L by GST-PLRG1. Lane 3 had a control pull-down using the spliceosomal protein SPF30 that does not interact with CDC5L.Lane 4 is the positive control and contained His-CDC5L alone used in the binding assays. All the arrows on the right of the panels indicate proteins identified in the pull-down experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Anti-CDC5L antibodies (10Ajuh P.

EMBO J. 2000; 19: 6569-6581Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar) were used to immunodeplete CDC5L from HeLa nuclear extract, and both the proteins bound on the beads and the proteins remaining in the supernatants were separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred onto a nitrocellulose membrane by Western blotting as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Transferred proteins were probed using anti-CDC5L antibodies (Fig. 1 A), anti-PLRG1 antibodies (Fig. 1 B), and as a negative control, an antibody to the spliceosomal protein SPF30 (6Neubauer G. King A. Rappsilber J. Calvio C. Watson M. Ajuh P. Sleeman J. Lamond A. Mann M. Nat. Genet. 1998; 20: 46-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (421) Google Scholar), which was not identified in the human CDC5L complex (Fig. 1 C). The results indicate that most of the PLRG1 is co-depleted upon immunodepletion of CDC5L from HeLa nuclear extract (Fig. 1, A and B, lanes 4 and 5). In contrast, the spliceosomal protein SPF30 remains in the supernatant, i.e. not associated with the CDC5L-PLRG1 complex. These data show that most of the PLRG1 protein in HeLa nuclear extract is associated with CDC5L. Because of the tight association between CDC5L and PLRG1 found in immunoprecipitation experiments, we next decided to investigate whether these proteins are present in the same nuclear structures in vivo. HeLa cells were either transfected with expression vectors encoding GFP-tagged CDC5L and PLRG1 proteins or else stained with specific antibodies. PLRG1 and CDC5L both showed a speckled nuclear staining pattern, as judged by antibody staining and by expression of GFP fusion proteins, which co-localized with the pattern obtained by co-staining the cells with the monoclonal antibody Y12 (Fig. 2, A and B). The antibody Y12 recognizes the “Sm” proteins common to each of the major splicing snRNPs (27Petterson I. Hinterberger M. Mimori T. Gottlieb E. Steitz J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 5907-5914Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). When HeLa cells transiently expressing GFP-CDC5L were stained with anti-PLRG1, both proteins were found to co-localize in the same speckled structures (Fig. 2 C). Similar results were obtained by staining cells transiently expressing GFP-PLRG1 with anti-CDC5L antibodies (data not shown). These results are consistent with the presence of CDC5L and PLRG1 in a common complex in vivo but do not address whether the proteins directly interact. We next decided to investigate a possible direct interaction between the two proteins using in vitro methods. HeLa nuclear extracts were incubated with GST-PLRG1, and an immunoprecipitation was performed on the reaction mixture using anti-CDC5L antibodies. Immunoprecipitated proteins were then separated by SDS-PAGE and blotted onto nitrocellulose filters before probing with anti-PLRG1 antibodies (Fig. 3 A, lane 3). The results show that bacterially expressed GST-PLRG1 as well as endogenous PLRG1 are co-immunoprecipitated by"

Members of this family are characterized by an extracellular part containing at least one immunoglobulin domain, a transmembrane segment, and a cytoplasmic tail. A subset of the Ig superfamily is the inhibitory receptor characterized by the presence of one or more immunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhibitory motifs (ITIM)1 in their cytoplasmic tail. The consensus sequence of the ITIM is generally described as (L/V/I/S/T)XY XX(L/V) (3Vivier E. Daeron M. Immunol. Today. 1997; 18: 286-291Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar). Following phosphorylation of the tyrosine residue within this motif, the SH2 domain containing protein-tyrosine phosphatases SHP-1 and/or SHP-2 can be recruited to the receptor, where they can dephosphorylate membrane-bound phosphoproteins, thus modulating the signaling cascade. SHP-1 is a non-transmembrane protein primarily expressed in hematopoietic cells and is considered to play a negative role in cell signaling (4Zhang J. Somani A.K. Siminovitch K.A. Semin.

The complete sequence of this region has been determined (18The MHC Sequencing ConsortiumNature. 1999; 401: 921-923Crossref PubMed Scopus (926) Google Scholar). The central MHC region is termed the class III region and comprises 0.8 megabases. Of the 59 genes in this region, 40% are known or predicted to have a role in the immune system or inflammation, such as tumor necrosis factor, lymphotoxin-α, and lymphotoxin-β. Susceptibility to a wide range of diseases has been linked to the MHC, including insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (19Todd J.A. Pathol. Biol. 1997; 45: 219-227PubMed Google Scholar), rheumatoid arthritis (20Svejgaard A. Platz P. Ryder L.P. Immunol. Rev. 1983; 70: 193-218Crossref PubMed Scopus (456) Google Scholar), and ankylosing spondylitis (21Brown M.A. Pile K.D. Kennedy L.G. Campbell D. Andrew L. March R. Shatford J.L. Weeks D.E. Calin A. Wordsworth B.P. Arthritis Rheum. 1998; 41: 588-595Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Although disease susceptibility is often due to allelic differences in the class I and class II antigens, there is evidence that loci located in the class III region may also contribute (21Brown M.A. Pile K.D. Kennedy L.G. Campbell D. Andrew L. March R. Shatford J.L. Weeks D.E. Calin A. Wordsworth B.P. Arthritis Rheum. 1998; 41: 588-595Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 22Schaffer F.M. Palermos J. Zhu Z.B. Barger B.O. Cooper M.D. Volanakis J.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 8015-8019Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). For this reason the detailed characterization of genes located in the class III region with a potential role in the immune system is of great interest. G6b is an uncharacterized gene located in the class III region of the MHC that encodes a putative cell surface receptor of the Ig superfamily. Its predicted gene product was found to contain a potential signal peptide, a variable type Ig domain, and a transmembrane segment (23Ribas G. Neville M. Wixon J.L. Cheng J. Campbell R.D. J. Immunol. 1999; 163: 278-287PubMed Google Scholar). Interestingly, we have observed that the intracellular stretch also contains two tyrosine residues in ITIM consensus sequences. In this study, the available genomic sequence information was used as a starting point to obtain the cDNA encoding the G6b protein. By RT-PCR, several alternative splice variants of the G6b mRNA were identified in the bone marrow-derived cell lines K562, Molt4, and Jurkat but not in other hematopoietic and fibroblast cell lines studied. These mRNAs encode proteins with different C termini, some of which lacked a transmembrane segment. Expression of four of the proteins as epitope-tagged fusion proteins in mammalian cells allowed their further characterization. An association of the splice isoform containing the ITIM motifs with SHP-1 and SHP-2 was shown following pervanadate-induced tyrosine phosphorylation. RNA isolation from human cell lines was performed as described previously (24Aguado B. Campbell R.D. Biochem. J. 1999; 341: 679-689Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). cDNA synthesis was carried out using a Promega Reverse Transcription System and ∼1 μg of poly(A)+ RNA according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Control PCR reactions with β-actin primers were performed on each cDNA reaction (forward 5′-CTTCGCGGGCGACGATGC-3′ and reverse 5′-TGGTGGTGAAGCTGTAGCC-3′). PCR primers for G6b were designed based on the genomic sequence (GenBankTM accession number AF129756). To obtain the complete open reading frame, nested PCR was performed on the cDNA samples. In the first round, forward primer 5′-AGCTTCTCCTCACCACATCC-3′ (nt position 26694–26713) and reverse primer 5′-AAAGGGTCAGTCTCCTGACG-3′ (nt position 23402–23421) were used. In the second round, forward primer 5′-CCTAACCATGGCTGTGTTTC-3′ (nt position 26676–26695) was used in combination with reverse primer 5′-GGGAGGTTTGGAGTAAGGGC-3′ (nt position 24972–24991). In each round, 25 cycles were performed using an annealing temperature of 60 °C. PCR fragments were cloned into the pGEM-T vector (Promega). Clones were checked by sequencing on an Applied Biosystems (Applera) 377 automated DNA sequencer using Big Dye terminators. For expression of epitope-tagged proteins in mammalian cells, the open reading frames of the different splice isoforms were cloned into the pcDNA3 vector (Invitrogen) fused to a T7-epitope tag (MASMTGGQQMGRDP). To express the G6b isoforms fused at the C terminus to the T7-epitope tag, PCR copies were made of the open reading frames removing the stop codons. The forward primer 5′-TTATAAGCTTACCATGGCTGTGTTTCTGC-3′ was used, creating a HindIII site (underlined). The reverse primer (either 5′-TCATGCGGCCGCGCTAGCAACTACAACTGCATAGA-3′ (for G6b splice isoforms B and E) or 5′-TCATGCGGCCGCGCTAGCGCAGGGTCCGCTGTGG-3′ (for G6b splice isoforms A and D)) was used. These two reverse primers obliterated the stop codons and introduced NheI sites (underlined), allowing direct fusion to the T7 tag sequence in the T7.TagpBlsc vector (25Milner C.M. Smith S.V. Carrillo M.B. Taylor G.L. Hollinshead M. Campbell R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 4549-4558Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). PCR fragments were cloned into this vector using HindIII-NheI. Constructs were checked by DNA sequencing as described above. The inserts encoding the fusion proteins were cloned into the pcDNA3 vector using HindIII-NotI. To express the G6b isoforms with the T7-epitope tag fused to the N terminus, an expression vector was created containing the human CD33 signal peptide (26Simmons D. Seed B. J. Immunol. 1988; 141: 2797-2800PubMed Google Scholar) instead of the G6b signal peptide followed by the T7-epitope tag in pcDNA3. First, a fusion between the CD33 signal peptide and the T7-epitope tag was constructed in pBluescript. The CD33 leader-T7 tag fusion was amplified by PCR using primers 5′-GCTTGGTACCATGCCGCTGCTGCTACTG-3′ introducing a NdeI site (underlined) and 5′-GATCTATGGATCCCGACCC-3′ containing a BamHI site (underlined). The resulting fragment was cloned into the pcDNA3 vector using NdeI and BamHI, yielding the plasmid CD33-T7-pcDNA3. The G6b splice isoforms were PCR-amplified with primer 5′-GTCGGGATCCCCAAGGGAACCCTGGGGC-3′, introducing a BamHI site (underlined) and removing the first 15 amino acids of the potential signal sequence, and 5′-AATTGCGGCCGCCCTTCAAACTACAACTGC-3′, introducing a NotI site (underlined) and maintaining the stop codon. The resulting PCR fragments were digested with BamHI and NotI and cloned into CD33-T7-pcDNA3 digested with BamHI and NotI. The clones were checked by DNA sequencing. Mutations of tyrosine to phenylalanine in the cytoplasmic tail of the N-terminal-tagged G6b-B construct were made using the QuikChange™ mutagenesis method (Stratagene) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Proteins were transiently expressed in COS-7 cells using the DEAE-dextran method as described elsewhere (25Milner C.M. Smith S.V. Carrillo M.B. Taylor G.L. Hollinshead M. Campbell R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 4549-4558Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Three days after transfection, cells and supernatants were harvested. K562 cells were transfected with Lipofectin (Life Technologies, Inc.) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Three days after transfection, cells were maintained in the presence of 0.5 mg/ml G418. For direct analysis on SDS-polyacrylamide gels, cells were washed once with phosphate-buffered saline and lysed in SDS-PAGE sample buffer (27Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207227) Google Scholar). Supernatants were routinely cleared by centrifugation. SDS-PAGE was done according to Laemmli (27Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207227) Google Scholar) on 12% polyacrylamide gels. Western blot immunostaining was performed with the anti-T7 tag monoclonal antibody (mAb) (Novagen). Immunoreactive proteins were detected with horseradish peroxidase-coupled secondary antibody followed by detection with ECL (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Immunofluorescence localization studies were performed as described elsewhere (28Aguado B. Campbell R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 4096-4105Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar), and staining was examined with a Nikon Eclipse E800 microscope linked to a MicroRadiance confocal imaging system (Bio-Rad). G6b splice isoforms were expressed in COS-7 cells as described above, and cell lysates were prepared in 10 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 6.5, 0.1% SDS, and 50 mm β-mercaptoethanol. For treatment of secreted G6b forms, the medium was harvested, and SDS (final concentration, 0.1%) and β-mercaptoethanol (final concentration, 50 mm) were added. To denature the proteins, both cell lysates and media were heated for 2 min at 95 °C. Thereafter, Nonidet P-40 (final concentration, 1%), sodium phosphate buffer, pH 6.5 (final concentration, 50 mm), and protease inhibitor mixture (Sigma P8340, 200× diluted) were added. Aliquots of these preparations were treated with N-glycosidase F (25 units/ml), neuraminidase (0.15 units/ml), or O-glycosidase (4 milliunits/ml) for 5 h at 37 °C. (All three enzymes were obtained from Roche Molecular Biochemicals.) Reactions were then stopped by the addition of SDS-PAGE sample buffer and analyzed on 12% polyacrylamide gels followed by Western blot immunostaining as described above. Pervanadate was prepared by mixing sodium orthovanadate (Sigma) and hydrogen peroxide (Sigma) in phosphate-buffered saline to final concentrations of 1 and 10 mm, respectively, and leaving the mixture for 15 min at room temperature. To remove excess hydrogen peroxide, catalase (Sigma) was added to a final concentration of 0.2 mg/ml. Cells were stimulated by a 10× dilution of pervanadate in phosphate-buffered saline for 10 min at 37 °C. Cells were lysed in lysis buffer (10 mmTris/HCl, pH 7.5, 1% Nonidet P-40, 150 mm NaCl, 0.02% sodium azide, and 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin) supplemented with protease inhibitor mixture (200× diluted). Lysates were cleared by a 15-min centrifugation at 4 °C, and immunoprecipitations were performed with the anti-T7 mAb and protein A-Sepharose (Sigma) at 4 °C. Proteins were eluted with SDS-PAGE sample buffer at 95 °C for 2 min and analyzed by SDS-PAGE followed by Western blotting. The Western blots were probed with either the anti-T7 tag mAb horseradish peroxidase conjugate (Novagen), anti-phosphotyrosine mAb (4G10) coupled to horseradish peroxidase (Upstate Biotech), anti-SHP-1, or anti-SHP-2 polyclonal antisera (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). In the case of the anti-SHP-1 and SHP-2 antisera, a secondary antibody coupled to horseradish peroxidase was used. Proteins were detected with ECL as before. No human expressed sequence tag (EST) clones were found that contained any part of the coding region of G6b, although ESTBE750421 was found to encode a putative bovine homologue. However, there were a few human ESTs that corresponded to the genomic sequence ∼1000–1600 nt downstream of the putative stop codon. Characterization of some of these clones (e.g. AA699838) indicated that they did not contain the complete open reading frame. Because one-step RT-PCR turned out not to be sensitive enough, nested RT-PCR was performed on cDNA preparations from poly(A)+RNA derived from various human cell lines. The preparations from the bone marrow-derived cell lines K562 (erythroleukemia), Molt4, and Jurkat (T cell leukemias) yielded a number of differently sized PCR fragments (Fig. 1 A,bands A–F) with the two closely migrating bands A and B (Fig. 1 A) being of the expected size. PCR on the bone marrow-derived cell lines U937 (monocyte-like), Raji (B cell-like), HL60 (promyelocytic), and the fibroblast cell lines Tk and HeLa did not yield any of these products (Fig. 1). Similarly, in a separate experiment, we were not able to amplify by PCR G6b mRNA from human natural killer cell lines NKL, NK92, and YT (data not shown). Sequence analysis of the generated RT-PCR products showed that the band with the lower molecular weight (band B) represents the form predicted by Genscan (23Ribas G. Neville M. Wixon J.L. Cheng J. Campbell R.D. J. Immunol. 1999; 163: 278-287PubMed Google Scholar) and also annotated in EMBL/GenBankTM entry AF129756). This form contains two ITIM motifs at amino acid positions 209–214 and 235–240 in the encoded polypeptide (Fig. 2 B). Comparison of the cDNA sequence of the higher molecular weight band (band A) with the genomic sequence revealed that this form includes an extra stretch of 19 base pairs relative to G6b-B due to different splicing at the 5′ end of coding exon 5 (Fig. 2). This extra stretch shifts the reading frame of the C-terminal end of G6b-A compared with G6b-B, resulting in the absence of the two ITIM motifs in G6b-A. The lower molecular weight bands (bands C–E) correspond to variants missing either exon 3 or exons 3 and 4 together (Fig. 2). Because the putative transmembrane segment is encoded by exon 3, these variants would encode proteins that are predicted to be secreted and not to be membrane-associated. Bands that showed higher molecular weights than the ones described above (bands F and G) turned out to contain intronic sequences. These cDNAs would encode proteins that contain the same signal sequence, Ig domain, and transmembrane domain as the previous forms but with a different cytoplasmic tail. The only PCR band observed in Tk cells (Fig. 1 A) contained the intron between coding exons 1 and 2, which leads to a premature stop codon. No potentially functional transcript could be amplified from this cell line. Four splice isoforms were selected for further characterization, two transmembrane segment-containing isoforms (G6b-A and G6b-B) and two soluble isoforms (G6b-D and G6b-E). The C terminus of G6b-A is identical to the C terminus of G6b-D, and the C terminus of G6b-B corresponds to the C terminus of G6b-E. The four splice isoforms were cloned into a pcDNA3 expression vector as fusions with a T7 epitope. The fusion proteins were transiently expressed in COS-7 cells. Multiple bands per lane were observed on SDS-polyacrylamide gel, which could be indicative of glycosylation, each band representing the protein in a different state of glycosylation (Fig. 3). As expected, only the isoforms lacking transmembrane segments (G6b-D and G6b-E) were present in the medium. The expected molecular sizes for the G6b splice variants without leader peptide are 24.3 (G6b-A), 23.2 (G6b-B), 19.5 (G6b-D), and 18.3 kDa (G6b-E). The observed molecular sizes of the proteins on SDS-polyacrylamide gel are in general in good agreement with the expected molecular sizes when considering the lowest band found in each case. An exception to this is the G6b-E form found in the medium, which migrates at ∼30–38 kDa. This might be due to the presence of relatively large glycan chains. In this respect, it is noteworthy that G6b-E found within the cell has a molecular size much closer to the theoretical one, probably because these proteins have not been through the complete glycosylation pathway. To investigate whether the different G6b variants were glycosylated, COS-7 cell lysates and cell supernatants containing the various C-terminal-tagged forms of G6b were incubated with combinations of the glycosidases N-glycosidase F, O-glycosidase, and/or neuraminidase (Fig. 4). Treatment of N-glycosidase F alone causes in all forms (except G6b-E) the disappearance of some of the multiple bands, indicating that the various forms have, at least in part, N-glycan chains. Treatment with both neuraminidase and O-glycosidase resulted in bands with molecular weights no different from the bands obtained after only neuraminidase treatment, except in the case of the secreted form of G6b-E, indicating that only this form contains a substantial O-glycosylation. However, when the molecular weights of the membrane proteins G6b-A and G6b-B treated with only N-glycosidase F (devoid of N-glycan chains) are compared with these proteins treated with all three glycosidases (devoid of both N- as well as O-glycan chains), a small difference in the molecular weight is observed (Fig. 4). This difference can be explained by the presence of low molecular weight O-glycan chains. Comparing the same treatments in the case of secreted G6b-D shows that the higher molecular weight band observed when the protein is treated with N-glycosidase F alone is not detected when the protein is treated with all three glycosidases, indicating that this particular band contains O-glycosylation. In the case of the non-membrane-bound isoforms (G6b-D and G6b-E), the proteins secreted into the medium contain more glycosylation than what is found in the corresponding cell lysates. The proteins found in the cell lysates may also represent misfolded proteins. For that reason they may not be transported through the secretory pathway and thus may not be fully glycosylated. When the same treatments were performed on the N-terminal-tagged isoforms, similar results were obtained (data not shown). Localization studies with immunofluorescence were performed using the constructs with either the C-terminal or N-terminal T7-epitope tag (Fig. 5). Using the C-terminal-tagged proteins, an overall staining of the cells was observed in the case of the isoforms G6b-A and G6b-B, which contain potential transmembrane segments. This finding is in line with a localization at the plasma membrane. In contrast, G6b-D and G6b-E showed a pattern consistent with endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi labeling. In the case of the N-terminal-tagged proteins, staining was performed under both permeabilizing as well as non-permeabilizing conditions. With permeabilizing conditions, the patterns observed were similar to the ones observed with the C-terminal-tagged proteins (Fig. 5 B). Staining under non-permeabilizing conditions clearly indicated that the G6b forms containing a transmembrane segment (G6b-A and G6b-B) were present at the plasma membrane with the T7-epitope tag outside the cell (Fig. 5 C). In contrast, G6b-D- and G6b-E-expressing cells showed a completely different pattern when stained under non-permeabilizing conditions compared with permeabilizing conditions. G6b-D-expressing cells showed staining around the edges of the cell, in contrast to G6b-E, where this type of staining is virtually absent (Fig. 5 C). This staining might be explained if the protein sticks to the cell after being secreted. Most inhibitory receptors, either of the Ig superfamily or lectin-like superfamily, contain at least two ITIMs with a typical spacing of 20–32 amino acids in the primary sequence (3Vivier E. Daeron M. Immunol. Today. 1997; 18: 286-291Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar) and are known to bind SHP-1 and/or SHP-2 after phosphorylation. G6b-B contains two tyrosine residues in consensus ITIM sequences in its cytoplasmic tail, and the spacing between these two ITIMs is 26 amino acids. To investigate whether this isoform was able to bind SHP-1 and/or SHP-2 after phosphorylation, COS-7 cells expressing the four N-terminal T7-tagged G6b isoforms were treated with pervanadate. In the case of the membrane-bound forms G6b-A and G6b-B, the N-terminal epitope tag (present outside the cell) is expected not to interfere with these interactions, which take place at the cytoplasmic tail. Analysis of total COS-7 lysates by Western blotting with anti-phosphotyrosine antibodies showed that tyrosine phosphorylation in the cells was highly increased due to pervanadate treatment (data not shown). The different G6b isoforms were immunoprecipitated with the anti-T7 mAb from cells treated or untreated with pervanadate (Fig. 6). Induction of tyrosine phosphorylation on G6b was checked with a phosphotyrosine-specific antibody. Only the G6b-B isoform was found to be tyrosine-phosphorylated after pervanadate stimulation (Fig. 6). In the immunoprecipitate containing tyrosine-phosphorylated G6b-B, both SHP-1 and SHP-2 can be detected by Western blot immunostaining (Fig. 6). The presence of SHP-1 and SHP-2 is strictly dependent on both the presence of the ITIM-containing G6b-B isoform and on the induction of tyrosine phosphorylation by pervanadate on this molecule. To investigate whether both cytoplasmic tyrosines of G6b-B or just one of them are phosphorylated, three mutant constructs were expressed in COS-7 cells, namely G6b-B(Y211F), G6b-B(Y237F), and G6b-B(Y211F/Y237F). Mutation of Tyr-211 to Phe resulted in a total loss of detectable tyrosine phosphorylation as well as a loss of interaction of G6b-B with SHP-1 and SHP-2 (Fig. 7). Mutation of Tyr-237 to Phe leads to a clearly detectable, although strongly reduced, level of tyrosine phosphorylation and SHP-1 and SHP-2 interaction. These results suggest that Tyr-211 is the only tyrosine residue to be phosphorylated and to be involved in SHP-1 and SHP-2 binding, even though Tyr-237 is in an ITIM consensus sequence. To confirm the interaction of G6b-B with SHP-1 and SHP-2 in a human bone marrow-derived cell line, a similar experiment was performed using the human leukemic cell line K562, which expresses G6b at the RNA level (Fig. 1). The two membrane-bound forms of G6b (G6b-A and G6b-B) were expressed in this cell line. Only the G6b-B isoform was phosphorylated upon pervanadate treatment (Fig. 8). Both SHP-1 and SHP-2 can be detected in immunoprecipitates of tyrosine-phosphorylated G6b-B in transfected K562 cells, confirming the results obtained in COS-7 cells. We have characterized the G6b gene located in the class III region of the human MHC, a region known to contain many genes with relevance in the immune system. RT-PCR on cDNA preparations from various human cell lines showed that the G6b gene is only expressed in a restricted set of hematopoietic cell lines, suggesting an immune-related function. Furthermore, it was observed that the RNA derived from this gene is alternatively spliced. One spliced form, which encodes a protein containing two ITIM sequences (G6b-B), appears to be less abundant at the RNA level than the form lacking these motifs (G6b-A). Besides these forms, other variants were detected encoding proteins lacking a transmembrane segment (G6b-D and G6b-E). When expressed in COS-7 cells, these latter forms were secreted, showing that the N-terminal hydrophobic segment indeed serves as a signal sequence. Glycosidase treatment of the various G6b isoforms provided evidence that the proteins are both N- as well as O-glycosylated. The extracellular part of the membrane-bound forms of G6b contains only one consensus N-glycosylation site. This site is located in the predicted B-strand of the V-type Ig domain, and the side chain of the asparagine residue (Asn-32) to be glycosylated is likely to be on the surface (see Ref. 29Chothia C. Gelfand I. Kister A. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 278: 457-479Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar for a detailed description of V-type Ig domains), making it a suitable residue for glycosylation. Secreted G6b-E contains a relatively high amount of O-glycosylation compared with the other isoforms. Because the difference between G6b-D and G6b-E lies in the C-terminal tail, it is likely that there is at least one extra O-glycosylation site in this part of G6b-E, which could explain the difference in glycosylation between these two forms. Although G6b-B contains a C terminus identical to the C terminus of G6b-E, in the case of G6b-B, this tail is cytoplasmic and, therefore, not available for glycosylation. Immunofluorescence with non-permeabilized cells using the N-terminal-tagged constructs showed that the T7 tag is outside the cells in the case of G6b-A and G6b-B. Although these constructs do not carry their own signal sequence, it confirms that the proteins are transported to the plasma membrane and not retained in the endoplasmic reticulum. These observations indicate that these proteins are able to fold correctly in these cells because proteins that are not able to fold correctly are retained in the endoplasmic reticulum and finally broken down (30Parodi A.J. Biochem. J. 2000; 348: 1-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar). For the same reason, it can be assumed that G6b-D and G6b-E are able to correctly fold in COS-7 cells because these variants are secreted into the medium. Of all the G6b isoforms analyzed, only G6b-B appears to be efficiently phosphorylated when COS-7 and K562 cells expressing this recombinant protein are treated with pervanadate. This is completely in line with expectations as G6b-A does not contain cytoplasmic tyrosine residues and the soluble isoforms do not have a part exposed to the cytoplasmic kinases even though G6b-E contains ITIM sequences identical to G6b-B. The interaction of tyrosine-phosphorylated G6b-B with SHP-1 and SHP-2 could be observed in two different cell lines, one of them (K562) expressing G6b mRNA endogenously. SHP-1 is known to be primarily expressed in hematopoietic cells (4Zhang J. Somani A.K. Siminovitch K.A. Semin. Immunol. 2000; 12: 361-378Crossref PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar), but we could clearly detect this protein in the monkey fibroblast cell line COS-7. Although G6b-B contains two tyrosine residues in ITIM consensus sequences in its cytoplasmic tail (Tyr-211 and Tyr-237), site-directed mutagenesis suggested that only one of them (Tyr-211) gets phosphorylated upon pervanadate stimulation of COS-7 cells and that this tyrosine is responsible for SHP-1 and SHP-2 binding. This result was not anticipated because mutagenesis studies with similar receptors containing two tyrosine residues in ITIMs showed the involvement of both residues in SHP-1 or SHP-2 binding (15Xu M. Zhao R. Zhao Z.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 17440-17446Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 31Zhao R. Zhao Z.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 5453-5459Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). It is assumed that in these cases, the tandem SH2 domains of SHP-1 and SHP-2 bind the diphosphorylated receptor with high affinity. However, the absence of detectable tyrosine phosphorylation of the Y211F mutant does not necessarily mean that Tyr-237 does not get phosphorylated in the wild type construct. It cannot be excluded that the phosphorylation of tyrosine 237 is dependent on the prior phosphorylation of tyrosine 211. It has become clear that inhibitory receptors often have closely related activating homologues that are expressed on the same cell type and are believed to bind similar or identical extracellular ligands (32Taylor L.S Paul S.P. McVicar D.W. Rev. Immunogenet. 2000; 2: 204-219PubMed Google Scholar). Known examples are the killer inhibitory receptor family as well as the Ly49 family (32Taylor L.S Paul S.P. McVicar D.W. Rev. Immunogenet. 2000; 2: 204-219PubMed Google Scholar). In these cases, inhibitory and activating receptors are encoded by different genes. In contrast to the inhibitory proteins, the activating receptors generally have a short cytoplasmic tail lacking ITIM sequences. Furthermore, they possess a positively charged residue in the transmembrane segment involved in binding to signaling effector molecules such as CD3ξ, DAP10, and DAP12 (33Wu J. Cherwinski H. Spies T. Phillips J.H. Lanier L.L. J. Exp. Med. 2000; 192: 1059-1068Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar, 34Lanier L.L. Corliss B. Wu J. Phillips J.H. Immunity. 1998; 8: 693-701Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (436) Google Scholar). The results obtained in this study with G6b resemble the studies with the mouse natural killer cell receptor 2B4 in which two splice variants exist that differ only in the cytoplasmic tail (35Stepp S.E. Schatzle J.D. Bennett M. Kumar V. Mathew P.A. Eur. J. Immunol. 1999; 29: 2392-2399Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). The longer variant of 2B4 contains four consensus ITIM sequences, interacts with SHP-2 upon tyrosine phosphorylation, and inhibits NK cell-mediated lysis of tumor targets (36Schatzle J.D. Sheu S. Stepp S.E. Mathew P.A. Bennett M. Kumar V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 3870-3875Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). In contrast, the shorter 2B4 isoform contains only one potential ITIM but does not get phosphorylated upon pervanadate stimulation and thus does not recruit SHP-2. This shorter variant has been shown to stimulate NK cell-mediated lysis of tumor targets (36Schatzle J.D. Sheu S. Stepp S.E. Mathew P.A. Bennett M. Kumar V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Analogous to these results, one can speculate that the G6b-A variant is the activating counterpart of the inhibitory receptor G6b-B. However, both the short form of 2B4 as well as G6b-A lack a positively charged residue in the transmembrane segment, which is in contrast to the killer inhibitory receptor and Ly49 family of activating receptors. In summary, we have shown that the G6b gene located in the class III region of the human MHC is expressed and processed in immune-related cells at the RNA level. Characterization of the different G6b isoforms expressed in mammalian cells is in line with G6b encoding a novel glycosylated cell surface receptor, although soluble variants are found as well. The interaction of G6b-B with SHP-1 and SHP-2 classifies this variant at least as a new member of the family of inhibitory receptors of the Ig superfamily and the first one found so far in the MHC. However, the G6b Ig domain does not contain any significant homology toward other Ig domain-containing proteins with known ligand. Identification of the extracellular ligand might be crucial in understanding the role of the G6b gene product in cellular signaling. We thank Drs. A. Alcami and C.

https://openalex.org/W1583778028,"The nuclear receptor COUP-TFII was recently shown to bind to the promoter of the epsilon- and gamma-globin genes and was identified as the nuclear factor NF-E3. Transgenic experiments and genetic evidence from humans affected with hereditary persistence of fetal hemoglobin suggest that NF-E3 may be a repressor of adult epsilon and gamma expression. We show that, on the epsilon-promoter, recombinant COUP-TFII binds to two sites, the more downstream of which overlaps with an NF-Y binding CCAAT box. Binding occurs efficiently to either the 5' or the 3' COUP-TFII site but not to both sites simultaneously. However, adding recombinant NF-Y induces the formation of a stable COUP-TFII.NF-Y-promoter complex at concentrations of COUP-TFII that would not give significant binding in the absence of NF-Y. Mutations of the promoter indicate that COUP-TFII cooperates with NF-Y when bound to the 5' site, whereas binding at the 3' site is mutually exclusive. Likewise, in the gamma-promoter, COUP-TFII binds to a site overlapping the distal member of a duplicated CCAAT box, competing with NF-Y binding. Transfections in K562 cells show that both the mutation of the 5' COUP-TFII or of the NF-Y site on the epsilon-promoter decrease the activity of a luciferase reporter; the mutation of the 3' COUP-TFII site has little effect. These results, together with transgenic experiments suggesting a repressive activity of COUP-TFII on the epsilon-promoter and the observation that, on the 3' site, COUP-TFII and NF-Y binding is mutually exclusive, suggest that COUP-TFII may exert different effects on epsilon transcription depending on whether it binds to the 5' or to the 3' site. At the 5' site, COUP-TFII might cooperate with NF-Y, forming a stable complex, and stimulate transcription; at the 3' site, COUP-TFII might compete for binding with NF-Y and, directly or indirectly, decrease gene activity."

Moreover, both viruses have a related, trimeric envelope spike protein containing non-covalently associated gp120 and gp41 glycoprotein fragments derived from a posttranslationally cleaved precursor polypeptide (14Robey W.G.

The envelope glycoproteins are essential for viral infectivity and pathogenesis.The HIV and SIV envelope trimers have at least three conformational states: an unliganded state found on the surface of mature virions, a CD4-liganded state, and an end-product state in which the gp120 fragments have dissociated from the gp41 trimers and the gp41 portions have rearranged (16Sattentau Q.J. Moore J.P. J. Exp. Med. 1991; 174: 407-415Crossref PubMed Scopus (516) Google Scholar, 17Sattentau Q.J. Moore J.P. Vignaux F. Traincard F. Poignard P. J.

The transition to this final state is triggered by binding of the viral co-receptor, a member of the chemokine-receptor family (19Feng Y. Broder C.C. Kennedy P.E. Berger E.A. Science. 1996; 272: 872-877Crossref PubMed Scopus (3620) Google Scholar, 20Alkhatib G. Combadiere C. Broder C.C. Feng Y. Kennedy P.E. Murphy P.M. Berger E.A. Science. 1996; 272: 1955-1958Crossref PubMed Scopus (2437) Google Scholar). There are likely to be intermediate states of varying stability in the transitions between the conformations just listed. Cleavage of the envelope precursor (gp160) is required for the transition between the last two states and may be important for the first transition as well. CD4 binds more weakly to envelope trimers from fresh viral isolates than to the gp120 monomers derived from them, consistent with the notion that the initial state of the trimer restrains its gp120 moieties in a low-affinity conformation and with the observations that CD4 binding induces a structural transition (21Moore J.P.

Wyatt R. Robinson J. Sweet R.W. Sodroski J. Hendrickson W.A. Nature. 1998; 393: 648-659Crossref PubMed Scopus (2501) Google Scholar). The latter structure is presumably also in a state similar to the one found after dissociation of the gp120 fragment from the envelope trimer (16Sattentau Q.J. Moore J.P. J. Exp. Med. 1991; 174: 407-415Crossref PubMed Scopus (516) Google Scholar, 17Sattentau Q.J. Moore J.P. Vignaux F. Traincard F. Poignard P. J. Virol. 1993; 67: 7383-7393Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The structure of the initial state of the gp160 (or gp120/gp41) trimer is not known. Models derived from the structure of free gp120 in complex with CD4 yield plausible approximations, but these are limited by uncertainties concerning conformational rearrangements (27Kwong P.D. Wyatt R. Sattentau Q.J. Sodroski J. Hendrickson W.A. J. Virol. 2000; 74: 1961-1972Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar).In this paper, experiments were designed to analyze properties of the SIVmac32H envelope protein ectodomain gp140, overexpressed in a recombinant system. We have recently reported results from chemical cross-linking, analytical ultracentrifugation, and mass spectrometry that demonstrate that the secreted recombinant protein, modified to render it unsusceptible to the processing cleavage, is a trimer (28Chen B. Zhou G. Kim M. Chishti Y. Hussey R.E. Ely B. Skehel J.J. Reinherz E.L. Harrison S.C. Wiley D.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 34946-34953Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Stably trimeric SIV envelope protein offers an opportunity to determine biochemical correlates of its various states. We describe here the kinetics of CD4 binding to trimeric gp140 versus monomeric gp120 and the stoichiometry of the CD4 interaction for each. We also report the binding properties of Fab fragments from neutralizing and non-neutralizing monoclonal antibodies (mAbs). We show that only one CD4 molecule binds to an uncleaved trimer, while both neutralizing and non-neutralizing Fabs bind with a stoichiometry of one Fab per gp120/gp41 subunit.DISCUSSIONOur finding that only one CD4 molecule can readily bind to an SIV envelope trimer is unexpected. Nonetheless, this conclusion results from independent evaluations of gp140-CD4 complexes using molecular sizing chromatography, gel mobility shift assays, quantitative amino acid analysis, and analytical ultracentrifugation. Steric blockage of the two other potential CD4 binding sites on a trimer by s4CD4 itself is an unlikely explanation of the results because s2CD4, a truncated D1D2 envelope-binding fragment of CD4, also has the same binding characteristics (Table I). How then can the observed stoichiometry be rationalized?The Fab binding analyses show that the trimer itself must be a symmetric structure. None of the monoclonals in our panel, which recognize epitopes distributed widely across the surface of the molecule, appears to exhibit interference between related sites on a trimer. By contrast, when CD4 binds, a striking asymmetry is induced that effectively blocks the other two sites. One potential source of this asymmetry is the constraint imposed on the molecule by the intact cleavage site between gp120 and gp41. When CD4 binds to one subunit in a trimer, it induces a conformational change that transforms the target gp120 into a conformation probably very close to the one seen in the CD4/Fab/gp120-core complex studied by Kwong et al. (26Kwong P.D. Wyatt R. Robinson J. Sweet R.W. Sodroski J. Hendrickson W.A. Nature. 1998; 393: 648-659Crossref PubMed Scopus (2501) Google Scholar). If this change included displacements possible only if the C terminus of gp120 and the N terminus of gp41 could move relative to one another, then the changes induced in the uncleaved trimer would be incomplete and the trimer might accommodate CD4 ligation by adopting an asymmetric structure. The asymmetry would prevent the other subunits from undergoing a similar transition and thus would strongly reduce their effective affinity for CD4.An alternative hypothesis is that CD4 binding induces asymmetry even in a cleaved gp140 trimer. CD4 binding to one gp120 on a trimer clearly produces strain, since the affinity of CD4 for gp120 on trimers is generally lower than its affinity for free gp120 from the same viral isolate. The trimer adapts to this imposed strain by shifting to a conformation that reveals a co-receptor binding site but that is inherently less stable than the “ground state”. Based on the kinetic analysis here, the conformational adaptation of one gp120 subunit in a trimer is not as favorable as of a gp120 monomer, hence yielding a faster CD4 off rate for the former. If the conformational change induced in the first subunit to bind produced sufficient strain in the neighbors to prevent symmetrical conformational changes and hence, to block their capacity to bind CD4, we might expect high concentrations of CD4 to induce gp120 dissociation (freeing it from the trimeric constraints and allowing it to open up and bind CD4). CD4-induced shedding of gp120 has indeed been described (48Hart T.K. Kirsh R. Ellens H. Sweet R.W. Lambert D.M. Petteway Jr., S.R. Leary J. Bugelski P.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 2189-2193Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar), but there are of course additional ways to account for this observation.Due to dissociation of gp120 from gp41, we have not succeeded in purification of an intact gp120-gp41 complex where the two components are in noncovalent association. Hence, the study of the stoichiometry of CD4 binding comparable with that made with the non-cleavable gp140 precursor could not be conducted. Furthermore, digestion of purified and uncleaved gp140 C1 envelope protein in vitro by furin was not able to generate gp120 and gp41 component products (data not shown). Envelope glycosylation may protect the furin cleavage site from digestion or additional enzymes may be required to generate the mature envelope fragments.Recently, Salzwedel and Berger (49Salzwedel K. Berger E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 12794-12799Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar) presented evidence for cooperative subunit interaction within the oligomeric envelope glycoprotein of HIV in the fusion process using a genetic complementation analysis. By examining a series of envelope variants with defects at specific functional sites in either gp120 or gp41 that render the glycoprotein incompetent for fusion with a CD4 target cell bearing a particular co-receptor, they showed that fusion can occur when one gp120 subunit is defective for CD4 binding or for co-receptor binding as long as it can pair with a subunit with intact function. A similar result was shown with complementation of normal and fusion-defective gp41 components. These data are consistent with the notion that binding of a single CD4 molecule to a trimeric envelope protein is sufficient to trigger conformational change in the native oligomer, subsequently followed by co-receptor binding and fusion.Whatever the detailed mechanism underlying the observed anti-cooperativity of CD4 binding to trimeric gp140, we can conclude that there must be a significant rearrangement in gp120 on the surface of a trimer when it binds CD4, perhaps including reorganization of the polypeptide chain near the gp120/gp41 cleavage point. Binding of the Fabs analyzed here appears not to induce this conformational change since we did not observe comparable anti-cooperativity. In the event that only the binding of a single CD4 molecule to a viral trimeric gp160 spike is necessary to trigger conformational change leading to fusion, antibody-related viral neutralization would be at a distinct disadvantage; blockade by a given antibody of all three sites on the trimer is then required to prevent viral binding and fusion.Any of a number of theories have been proposed to explain the basis upon which only certain antibodies neutralize viruses. Kinetic parameters including fast on rates and slow off rates have been identified (44VanCott T.C. Bethke F.R. Polonis V.R. Gorny M.K. Zolla-Pazner S. Redfield R.R. Birx D.L. J. Immunol. 1994; 153: 449-459PubMed Google Scholar, 46Sattentau Q. Moore J.P. J. Exp. Med. 1995; 182: 185-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar). Others have emphasized qualitative differences between neutralizing versus non-neutralizing antibodies. For example, anti-envelope antibodies that bind to the envelope spike on the virion will be neutralizing whereas those that bind to viral peptide fragments and/or monomeric envelope components will fail to be neutralizing (50Burton D.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 10018-10023Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). In the case of HIV1, it has been further suggested that neutralization by antibody is determined primarily by occupancy sites on the virion, regardless of epitope specificity (45Parren P.W.H.I. Mondor I. Naniche D. Ditzel H.J. Klasse P.J. Burton D.R. Sattentau Q.J. J. Virol. 1998; 72: 3512-3519Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).The present findings speak to these issues in specific molecular terms. Thus, while a threshold affinity is required for neutralization, site-specific localization of epitope binding is critical. For example, although KK41 binds SIV envelope with a K d = 2.1 nm, equivalent to the neutralizing mAb 2C3 (2.3 nm), the KK41 mAb is not neutralizing. This confirms other observations that certain mAbs and human anti-C4 mAbs bind well to intact virions but do not neutralize the virus (51Fouts T.R. Trkola A. Fung M.S. Moore J.P. AIDS Res. Hum. Retroviruses. 1998; 14: 591-597Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 52Nyambi P.N. Gormy M.K. Bastiani L. VanderGroen G. Williams C. Zolla-Pazner S. J. Virol. 1998; 72: 9384-9391Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 53Stamatatos L. Zolla-Pazner S. Gorny M.K. Cheng-Mayer C. Virology. 1997; 229: 360-369Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Moreover, four of the five neutralizing antibodies identified here recognize a native V3V4 conformational epitope as judged by their inability to detectably bind to denatured gp140 in Western blot analysis. These mAbs may directly or indirectly interfere with chemokine receptor binding; such mAbs are known to be neutralizing (30Edinger A.L. Ahuja M. Sung T. Baxter K.C. Haggerty B. Doms R.W. Hoxie J.A. J. Virol. 2000; 74: 7922-7935Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). These findings emphasize the view that most neutralizing antibodies recognize epitopes that contribute to an accessible functional site on the native trimer structure of the virion. Nevertheless, that non-conformational epitopes may be neutralizing, at least under some circumstances, is evident from the analysis of the gp41-specific 9G3 mAb. Consistent with this finding is the observation that the broadly neutralizing antibody 2F5 recognizes a linear sequence epitope ELDKWA in the membrane proximal segment of HIV1-gp41 (54Muster T. Steindl F. Purtscher M. Trkola A. Klima A. Himmler G. Rükler F. Katinger H. J. Virol. 1993; 67: 6642-6647Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).In the current study, we did not generate CD4 binding site-specific mAbs. Kinetic data showed that the affinity of CD4 to a gp140 trimer is weaker than that of CD4 to a gp120 monomer. Perhaps the CD4 binding site is partially occluded by the interactions between gp120 subunits in a trimer, necessitating conformational alterations. The resistance of primary HIV-1 isolates to soluble CD4 therapy has been attributed to a lower binding affinity of primary virus envelope glycoprotein oligomers for CD4 (46Sattentau Q. Moore J.P. J. Exp. Med. 1995; 182: 185-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar, 55Moore J.P. Cao Y. Qing L. Sattentau Q.J. Pyati J. Koduri R. Robinson J. Barbas III, C.F. Burton D.R. Ho D.D. J.

Although anti-CD4 mAb binding site epitopes and the CD4 binding site overlap, mapping studies demonstrate that they are not identical (57Thali M. Furman C. Ho D.D. Robinson J. Tilley S. Pinter A. Sodroski J. J. Virol. 1992; 66: 5635-5641Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In the crystal structure of the gp120-CD4-Fab complex, a number of the residues contributing to CD4 binding site epitopes are located in a depression at the interface between the inner and outer gp120 domains, a configuration that may offer poor immunogenicity. Furthermore, CD4 binding site antibodies might recognize a native gp120 conformation that is altered in the CD4-bound state (26Kwong P.D. Wyatt R. Robinson J. Sweet R.W. Sodroski J. Hendrickson W.A. Nature. 1998; 393: 648-659Crossref PubMed Scopus (2501) Google Scholar). Dynamic alterations of the CD4 binding site may foster poor antibody complementarity, resulting in only modest antibody affinity for the site. Occlusion of the CD4 binding site epitopes by CD4 may delay the generation of high affinity antibodies against the CD4 binding site epitopes. Hence, CD4 binding site epitopes alone may not be sufficient targets for vaccine development. Synergy between antibodies directed against CD4 binding site epitopes and other unrelated epitopes have been reported (58Laal S. Burda S. Gorny M.K. Karwowska S. Buchbinder A. Zolla-Pazner S. J. Virol. 1994; 68: 4001-4008Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 59McKeating J.A. Cordell J. Dean C.J. Balfe P. Virology. 1992; 191: 732-742Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar, 60Tilley S.A.

Virol. 1996; 70: 4466-4473Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).Elicitation of neutralizing antibodies by oligomeric forms of soluble gp140 has been disappointing to date, perhaps because those tested oligomers are mostly dimers or tetramers and modified trimers (62McKeating J.A. McKnight A. Moore J.P. J. Virol. 1991; 65: 852-860Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 63Staropoli I. Chanel C. Girard M. Altmeyer R. J. Biol.

Virol. 2000; 74: 5716-5725Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). Nonetheless, recent comparison of antibody responses in rabbits to HIV gp120 and gp140 produced and purified in an identical manner showed that gp140 elicits enhanced cross-reactivity with heterologous envelope proteins as well as greater neutralization (65Earl P.L. Sugiura W. Montefiori D.C. Broder C.C. Lee S.A. Lifson J. Moss B. J. Virol. 2001; 75: 645-653Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). Trimeric uncleaved gp140 produced as described here seems to be a physiologic representation of the native envelope structure on the virus particle and may offer a prototype for a useful immunogen. The structure of the trimeric envelope glycoprotein in its non-CD4 contacted ground state might provide the needed clues for rational design of a protein fragment capable of eliciting neutralizing antibodies to the native molecule.

Moreover, both viruses have a related, trimeric envelope spike protein containing non-covalently associated gp120 and gp41 glycoprotein fragments derived from a posttranslationally cleaved precursor polypeptide (14Robey W.G.

The HIV and SIV envelope trimers have at least three conformational states: an unliganded state found on the surface of mature virions, a CD4-liganded state, and an end-product state in which the gp120 fragments have dissociated from the gp41 trimers and the gp41 portions have rearranged (16Sattentau Q.J.

The transition to this final state is triggered by binding of the viral co-receptor, a member of the chemokine-receptor family (19Feng Y. Broder C.C. Kennedy P.E. Berger E.A.

Cleavage of the envelope precursor (gp160) is required for the transition between the last two states and may be important for the first transition as well. CD4 binds more weakly to envelope trimers from fresh viral isolates than to the gp120 monomers derived from them, consistent with the notion that the initial state of the trimer restrains its gp120 moieties in a low-affinity conformation and with the observations that CD4 binding induces a structural transition (21Moore J.P.

Structures have been determined for the gp41 ectodomain, in a state that probably corresponds to the final conformational rearrangement (23Weissenhorn W. Dessen A. Harrison S.C. Skehel J.J.

The latter structure is presumably also in a state similar to the one found after dissociation of the gp120 fragment from the envelope trimer (16Sattentau Q.J. Moore J.P. J. Exp.

The structure of the initial state of the gp160 (or gp120/gp41) trimer is not known.

Part of the chemical energy is used to translocate Ca2+ through the membrane (work) and part is dissipated as heat. The amount of heat produced during catalysis increases after formation of the Ca2+gradient across the vesicle membrane. In the absence of gradient (leaky vesicles) the amount of heat produced/mol of ATP cleaved is half of that measured in the presence of the gradient. After formation of the gradient, part of the ATPase activity is not coupled to Ca2+ transport. We now show that NaF can impair the uncoupled ATPase activity with discrete effect on the ATPase activity coupled to Ca2+ transport. For the control vesicles not treated with NaF, after formation of the gradient only 20% of the ATP cleaved is coupled to Ca2+ transport, and the caloric yield of the total ATPase activity (coupled plus uncoupled) is 22.8 kcal released/mol of ATP cleaved. In contrast, the vesicles treated with NaF consume only the ATP needed to maintain the gradient, and the caloric yield of ATP hydrolysis is 3.1 kcal/mol of ATP. The slow ATPase activity measured in vesicles treated with NaF has the same Ca2+ dependence as the control vesicles. This demonstrates unambiguously that the uncoupled activity is an actual pathway of the Ca2+-ATPase rather than a contaminating phosphatase. We conclude that when ATP hydrolysis occurs without coupled biological work most of the chemical energy is dissipated as heat.

The main physiological role of the sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca2+-ATPase is to remove Ca2+ from the cytosol thus controlling the transition between muscle contraction and relaxation (1Hasselbach W.

The ATPase uses the energy derived from ATP hydrolysis to transport Ca2+ across the membrane thus converting chemical energy into osmotic energy. The catalytic cycle of the Ca2+-ATPase can be reversed, during which Ca2+ leaves the vesicles through the ATPase, and coupled to the Ca2+ efflux, ATP is synthesized from ADP and Pi using the energy derived from the Ca2+gradient (3Hasselbach W.

Contrasting to the removal of Ca2+ from the medium, there is no evidence indicating that the reversal of the Ca2+ pump can play a role in muscle physiology. In recent years, two more properties of the Ca2+-ATPase were discovered that apparently are of no physiological relevance, the uncoupled Ca2+ efflux (10de Meis L. J. Biol.

During transport, part of the Ca2+accumulated by the vesicles leaks to the medium through the ATPase, but this efflux is not coupled to ATP synthesis. The uncoupled Ca2+-ATPase activity was described by Yu and Inesi (13Yu X. Inesi G. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 4361-4367Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar), who observed that the progressive rise in the Ca2+concentration in the vesicle lumen promotes the hydrolysis of ATP without concomitant Ca2+ translocation through the membrane. Depending on the conditions used, the rate of the uncoupled ATPase activity can be 2- to 8-folds faster than the ATPase activity coupled to Ca2+ translocation (15de Meis L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 25078-25087Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Uncoupled Ca2+ efflux and ATPase activities represent ramifications of the catalytic cycle that are detected only when a Ca2+gradient is formed across the vesicle membrane. The cycle varies depending on the Ca2+ concentration in the vesicle lumen. When the free Ca2+ concentration inside and outside the vesicles is kept in the micromolar range (no gradient), the reaction cycle flows as shown in Fig. 1 (4de Meis L. Vianna A.L. Annu. Rev.

The two main features of this cycle are that the hydrolysis of each ATP molecule is coupled to the translocation of two Ca2+ ions across the membrane (3Hasselbach W. Biochim. Biophys.

The enzyme cycles through two more sets of intermediary reactions when the vesicles accumulate Ca2+ and a gradient is formed across the membrane (dashed lines in Fig.2). These correspond to uncoupled ATPase activity (reaction 10) and uncoupled Ca2+ efflux (reactions 7–9). Recently (18de Meis L. Bianconi M.L. Suzano V.A.

The total amount of energy released during ATP hydrolysis is always the same, but the fraction of the total energy that is converted into osmotic energy, used for the resynthesis of ATP, or is converted into heat seems to be modulated by the ATPase. The main finding leading to this conclusion is that the amount of heat released during the hydrolysis of each ATP molecule varies depending on whether or not a gradient is formed across the vesicle membrane (15de Meis L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 25078-25087Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar, 18de Meis L. Bianconi M.L. Suzano V.A.

In the absence of gradient between 10 and 12 kcal are released/mol of ATP cleaved, and in the presence of gradient the heat released increases to the range of 20 to 24 kcal/mol of ATP cleaved. This difference seems to be related to the ramifications of the catalytic cycle that arise after Ca2+accumulation (15de Meis L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 25078-25087Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). In one of them, the chemical energy derived from ATP hydrolysis is first converted into osmotic energy (reactions 1–4 in Fig. 2) and then, during uncoupled Ca2+ efflux (reactions 7–9), osmotic energy is converted into heat (15de Meis L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 25078-25087Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar, 22de Meis L. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 276: 35-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). The uncoupled ATPase activity involves the hydrolysis of the high energy phosphoenzyme form 2Ca:E1∼P, and the amount of heat released in this step is larger than that released during the hydrolysis of the low energy form E2-P (15de Meis L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 25078-25087Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Not all the intermediary reactions catalyzed by the Ca2+-ATPase are exergonic. Calorimetric measurements revealed that heat is absorbed from the environment during the Ca2+ efflux coupled to ATP synthesis (15de Meis L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 25078-25087Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar, 22de Meis L. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 276: 35-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar), and the balance between the hydrolysis of the phosphoenzymes 2Ca:E1∼P,E2-P and ATP synthesis seems to determine the amount of heat released during Ca2+ transport and ATP hydrolysis. The observation that the Ca2+-ATPase can modulate the amount of heat released during catalysis raises the possibility that uncoupled activities and reversal of the Ca2+ pump may, after all, have physiological roles related to heat generation, a process that plays a key role in thermogenesis and the metabolic control of the cell (23Clausen T.

When the effect of fluoride was discovered, it was not known that a large fraction of the Ca2+-ATPase activity measured with intact vesicles is not coupled to Ca2+ transport nor was it known that the amount of heat produced during the hydrolysis of ATP varies depending on whether or not a Ca2+ gradient is formed across the vesicles membrane. In this study, we show that fluoride inhibits the uncoupled ATPase activity and the Ca2+transport becomes tightly coupled to the hydrolysis of ATP with little heat dissipation.Figure 2The catalytic cycle of the Ca2+-ATPase in the presence of a Ca2+gradient. The characteristics of the enzyme formsE1 and E2 are the same as those described in Fig. 1. This sequence is observed when the Ca2+ concentration on the outer surface of the vesicles is lower than 50 μm and inside the vesicles is higher than 1 mm. The high intravesicular Ca2+ concentration favors the reversion of reactions 4 and 3. As a consequence, the catalytic cycle can be reversed leading to Ca2+ efflux and ATP synthesis (steps 5–1, backward). Uncoupled Ca2+ efflux occurs through reactions 7–9 in the forward direction (12de Meis L. Wolosker H. Engelender S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1275: 105-110Crossref Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Uncoupled ATPase activity is processed through reaction 10 (13–15).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) These were derived from the longitudinal sarcoplasmic reticulum (light fraction) of rabbit hind limb white skeletal muscle. They were prepared as previously described (32Eletr S. Inesi G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1972; 282: 174-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar). These were measured by the filtration method (33Chiesi M. Inesi G. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 10370-10377Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). For 45Ca uptake, trace amounts of 45Ca were included in the assay medium. The reaction was arrested by filtering samples of the assay medium through Millipore filters. After filtration, the filters were washed five times with 5 ml of 3 mm La(NO3)3, and the radioactivity remaining on the filters was counted using a liquid scintillation counter. For Ca2+in ↔ Ca2+out exchange, the assay medium was divided into two samples. Trace amount of 45Ca2+ was added to only one of the samples, and the reaction was started by the simultaneous addition of vesicles to the two media. The sample containing the radioactive Ca2+ was used to determine the incubation time when the vesicles are filled and the steady state45Ca2+ uptake is reached. The rate of Ca2+in ↔ Ca2+outexchange was measured after steady state was reached by adding trace amount of 45Ca2+ to the second sample containing vesicles loaded with non-radioactive Ca2+. The exchange between radioactive Ca2+ from the medium and the non-radioactive Ca2+ contained inside the vesicles was measured by filtering samples of the assay medium through Millipore filters 5, 10, 15, 20, and 25 s after the addition of45Ca2+. This was assayed by measuring the release of 32Pi from [γ-32P]ATP. The reaction was arrested with trichloroacetic acid, final concentration 5% (w/v). The [γ-32P]ATP not hydrolyzed during the reaction was extracted with activated charcoal as previously described (34Grubmeyer C. Penefsky H.S. J. Biol.

The Ca2+-dependent ATPase activity, which is correlated with Ca2+ transport, is determined by subtracting the Mg2+-dependent activity from the activity measured in the presence of both Mg2+ and Ca2+. ATP synthesis was measured using32Pi as previously described (37de Meis L. Methods Enzymol. 1988; 157: 190-206Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). This was measured using an OMEGA Isothermal Titration Calorimeter from Microcal, Inc. (Northampton, MA) (18de Meis L. Bianconi M.L. Suzano V.A.

After equilibration at 35 °C, the reaction was started by injecting vesicles into the sample cell, and the heat change was recorded for 20 min. The volume of vesicle suspension injected in the sample cell varied between 0.02 and 0.03 ml. The heat change measured during the initial 2 min after vesicles injection was discarded to avoid artifacts such as heat derived from the dilution of the vesicle suspension in the reaction medium and binding of ions to the Ca2+-ATPase. The duration of these events is less than 1 min. Calorimetric enthalpy (ΔHcal) is calculated by dividing the amount of heat released by the amount of ATP hydrolyzed (15de Meis L. J. Biol.

The units used are moles for substrate hydrolyzed and kilocalorie for heat released. Negative values indicate that the reaction is exothermic, and positive values indicate that it is endothermic. All experiments were performed at 35 °C. In a typical experiment the assay media was divided in five samples, which were used for the simultaneous measurement of Ca2+ uptake, Ca2+in ↔ Ca2+out exchange, substrate hydrolysis, ATP synthesis, and heat release. The syringe of the calorimeter was filled with vesicles, and the temperature difference between the syringe and the reaction cell of the calorimeter was allowed to equilibrate, a process that usually took between 8 and 12 min. During equilibration, the vesicles used for measurements of Ca2+ uptake, Ca2+in ↔ Ca2+outexchange, ATP hydrolysis, and ATP synthesis were kept at the same temperature, length of time, and protein dilution as the vesicles kept in the calorimeter syringe. These different measurements were started simultaneously with vesicles to a final concentration of 0.01 mg/ml. NaN3 (5 mm), an inhibitor of ATP synthase, was added to the assay medium to avoid interference from possible contamination of the sarcoplasmic reticulum vesicles with this enzyme. The free Ca2+ concentration in the medium was calculated using the association constants of Schwartzenbach et al. (39Scwartzenbach G. Senn H. Anderegg G. Helvetia Chimica Acta. 1957; 40: 1886-1900Crossref Scopus (216) Google Scholar) in a computer program described by Fabiato and Fabiato (40Fabiato A. Fabiato F. J.

Now, we show that contrasting to the inhibition of the ATPase activity, both the initial rate of Ca2+ uptake and the maximal amount of Ca2+accumulated by the vesicles are enhanced by fluoride (Figs. 3B, 4, and Table I). The maximal effect is obtained in presence of 20 mm NaF (Fig. 4). The inhibition of the ATPase activity increases as the vesicles are filled with Ca2+, and maximal inhibition is observed after the steady state Ca2+ uptake is reached (Table I). These combined effects of fluoride on the ATPase activity and Ca2+ uptake indicate that in the presence of fluoride the vesicles are able to accumulate more Ca2+ with less ATP hydrolysis (Table I). In fact, the ratio between the initial rates of Ca2+ uptake and ATP hydrolysis is 0.26 ± 0.06 (5Mitchell P. Nature. 1961; 191: 144-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (2924) Google Scholar) in the absence of NaF and increases to 1.63 ± 0.13 (7de Meis L. Bittar E.

These values are mean ± S.E. of the number of experiments shown in parenthesis. Notice in Fig. 3 A that the inhibition of the ATPase activity becomes more pronounced after 5 min incubation. Nevertheless, the vesicles are able to pump Ca2+ even after prolonged incubation intervals with NaF. This was shown by diluting the vesicles in a medium containing 20 mm NaF and adding small amounts of Ca2+ at different incubation intervals (Fig.5). It was found that the Ca2+ added is rapidly taken up by the vesicles even after 20 min of incubation (Fig. 3 A).Figure 4Effect of NaF on ATPase activity (●) and Ca2+ uptake (○).

Chem. 2001; 276: 25078-25087Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). A possible explanation to the effects of NaF noted in Figs. Figure 3, Figure 4, Figure 5 and Table I is that fluoride inhibits the uncoupled Ca2+-ATPase activity to an extent larger than the ATPase activity actually responsible for Ca2+ uptake (reactions 1–6 in Fig. 2). This could be confirmed in experiments in which the vesicles are preincubated with NaF, and then the concentration of fluoride in the assay medium is decreased to a very low level. Earlier studies indicate that fluoride binds tightly to the enzyme form E2 but not to the form 2Ca:E1 (27Murphy A.J. Coll R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 16990-16994Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 31Kubota T. Daiho T. Kanazawa T. Biochim. Biophys.

The enzyme-fluoride complex formed in the absence of Ca2+ is very stable and can be isolated free of other components by 48 h of dialysis at 4 °C (27Murphy A.J. Coll R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 16990-16994Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This protective effect of Ca2+is confirmed in Fig. 6 where vesicles were pre-incubated without ATP and with 20 mm NaF either in presence or absence of Ca2+. After different intervals, samples of the mixture were diluted 75-fold in the assay media containing ATP used to measure the enzyme activities. The presence of Ca2+ during the preincubation period prevented the inhibition of the Ca2+-ATPase by fluoride. When Ca2+ is substituted by EGTA, both the rate of Ca2+ uptake and the maximal amount of Ca2+accumulated by the vesicles are diminished by fluoride (Fig.7 A). However, the ATPase activity is inhibited to a far larger extent than Ca2+uptake. Both control vesicles and vesicles preincubated with NaF are able to resynthesize part of the ATP cleaved (Fig. 7). The values of net ATP hydrolysis shown on Tables II and IIIrepresent the true amount of ATP cleaved during Ca2+transport and are calculated by subtracting the rate of ATP synthesis from the rate of ATP hydrolysis. For control vesicles, the ratio between the initial rate of Ca2+ uptake and net ATP hydrolysis varies between 0.68 (Table II) and 0.33 (Table III), values similar to those described in the bibliogr"

We have shown previously that the tyrosine kinase Lyn is involved in differentiation signals emanating from an activated erythropoietin receptor. Here we demonstrate that Lyn interacts with thyroid hormone receptor-interacting protein 1 (Trip-1), a transcriptional regulator associated with the T3 receptor, providing a link between the Epo and T3 signaling pathways. Trip-1 co-localized with Lyn and the T3 receptor α in the cytoplasm/plasma membrane of erythroid cells but translocated to discrete nuclear foci shortly after Epo-induced differentiation. Our data reveal that T3 stimulated the proliferation of immature erythroid cells, and inhibited maturation promoted by erythropoietin. Removal of T3 reduced cell division and enhanced terminal differentiation. This was accompanied by large increases in the cell cycle inhibitor p27Kip1 and by increasing expression of erythroid transcription factors GATA-1, EKLF, and NF-E2. Strikingly, a truncated Trip-1 inhibited both erythropoietin-induced maturation and T3-initiated cell division. This mutant Trip-1 acted in a dominant negative fashion by eliminating endogenous Lyn, elevating p27Kip1, and blocking T3 response elements. These data demonstrate that Trip-1 can simultaneously modulate responses involving both cytokine and nuclear receptors.

Secondary antibodies were coupled to horseradish peroxidase and detected by enhanced chemiluminescence (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, Little Chalfont, Buckinghamshire, UK).

Amphotropic and ecotropic retroviruses expressing the Cs and Cα constructs were used to infect erythroid cells as described previously (33Ingley E. Sarna M.K. Beaumont J.G. Tilbrook P.A. Tsai S.

Cells (107) were electroporated with 10 μg of the TR reporter constructs pF2-Luc or pDR4-Luc (44Yen P.M. Liu Y. Sugawara A. Chin W.W. J. Biol.

Transfected cells were harvested after 48 h of culture in the presence or absence of T3, and dual luciferase reporter assays were performed (Promega) on an Autolumat LB953 (EG&G Berthold, Oak Ridge, TN). To identify specific binding partners of Lyn, a yeast two-hybrid screen was conducted using wild-type Lyn and the kinase-inactive Y397F mutant (33Ingley E. Sarna M.K. Beaumont J.G. Tilbrook P.A.

In addition to transcriptionally regulating TRα (34Swaffield J.C. Melcher K. Johnston S.A. Nature. 1995; 374: 88-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar, 35Lee J.W., F., R. Swaffield J.C.

Young R.A. Goldberg A.L. Finley D. Nature. 1996; 379: 655-657Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). In vitro studies with purified proteins revealed that Lyn and Trip-1 interacted directly (Fig. 1 B) in a phosphotyrosine-independent manner (Fig. 1, A–C). Trip-1 also bound the kinase-inactive Y397F mutant of Lyn (Fig. 1,A and B), indicating that the enzymatic activity of Lyn was not required for this association. Deletion analyses showed that the SH2 and, to a lesser extent, the SH3 domains of Lyn were responsible for Trip-1 binding in vitro (Fig. 1,B and C); these observations were confirmed using lysates from erythroid cells (data not shown). The regions of Trip-1 that bound Lyn were then analyzed. Fig. 1 D shows that the amino-terminal of Trip-1 but not the coiled-coil domain alone was required for Lyn binding. This region is distinct from the highly conserved ATPase/DNA helicase AAA (ATPaseassociate with a variety of cellularactivities) domain of Trip-1 needed to bind the TRα (41Fraser R.A. Rossignol M. Heard D.J. Egly J.M. Chambon P. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 7122-7126Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Co-immunoprecipitation experiments performed on lysates from erythroid cell lines show that Lyn does indeed associate with Trip-1 in vivo (Fig. 1 E). Similarly, Trip-1 and TRα co-immunoprecipitated in these cells. These studies show that Trip-1 is able to bind both Lyn and TRα in erythroid cells, thereby connecting discrete signaling pathways involving Epo and T3. Having established a biochemical interaction between Lyn and Trip-1, the subcellular localization of these proteins was ascertained in uninduced erythroid cells. Lyn was found primarily in the cytoplasm of erythroid cells, with significant concentration at the plasma membrane (Fig. 2 A). As Trip-1 was also distributed in the cytosol and plasma membrane, appreciable co-localization between Lyn and Trip-1 was observed (Fig.2 A). As described by Zhu et al. (46Zhu X.G. Hanover J.A. Hager G.L. Cheng S.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 27058-27063Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar), TRα was detected in both the cytoplasm and nucleus. Consequently, Trip-1 co-localized with TRα in the cytoplasm, but not the nucleus, of these unstimulated erythroid cells (Fig. 2 B). Comparable results were obtained with other erythroid cells (data not shown). These experiments demonstrate that the association of Trip-1 with Lyn and TRα occurs in the cytoplasm/plasma membrane of erythroid cells. As both Epo and T3 affect erythropoiesis (1Krantz S.B. Blood. 1991; 77: 419-434Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 2Dainiak N. Sutter D. Kreczko S. Nature. 1978; 272: 260-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar), and Trip-1 was shown to associate with Lyn and TRα (Figs. 1 and 2), biological evidence for interplay between these pathways was sought. To this end, T3 and Epo concentrations were manipulated and cellular responses monitored. Fig. 3 Ashows that the removal of T3 enhanced Epo-induced hemoglobin production, whereas the addition of T3 severely impeded synthesis of the oxygen carrier. These effects were T3-specific, as reverse T3 (Fig. 3 A) and a variety of nuclear hormones (data not shown) had no effect on differentiation. The inhibitory effects of T3 on hemoglobin synthesis were concentration-dependent with an IC50 of 100 pm. Furthermore, morphological maturation was severely retarded in the presence of T3; nuclear condensation, cytoplasmic acidophilia, reduced cell size, and enucleation were all restricted by T3 (Fig. 3 B). Conversely, removal of T3 accelerated the appearance of erythroid cells with a more mature phenotype, in particular orthochromatic erythroblasts and reticulocytes. Identical results were obtained with other Epo-responsive cell lines (data not shown). In marked contrast with the inhibition of Epo-initiated differentiation, T3 promoted [3H]thymidine uptake (Fig. 3 C). When T3 was removed from cultures, DNA synthesis almost ceased; however, replication resumed upon re-introduction of T3. This observation was supported by monitoring cell numbers in these cultures (data not shown). To extend the analysis of erythroid cells beyond cell lines, the Epo/T3 axis was examined in red cell progenitors from murine fetal livers. Fig. 4 Ashows that the inhibitory effects of T3 on differentiation were not restricted to immortalized cells, as increasing the T3 concentration reduced Epo-induced colonies from normal progenitors. However, the effect was more pronounced on erythroid colony-forming units (CFU-E) than erythroid burst-forming units (BFU-E). These data indicate that T3 also had an inhibitory effect on Epo-induced differentiation of normal erythroid cells. To determine whether T3 affected fetal liver erythroid progenitors before exposure to Epo, cells were pre-incubated with T3 and then treated with Epo. Intriguingly, when T3 was added prior to Epo, both the BFU-E and CFU-E numbers rose (Fig. 4 B). This expansion of the erythroid progenitor compartment by pre-incubation with T3 indicates that the effects of T3 are stage-specific. Taken together these results show that T3 promotes proliferation and the expansion of immature erythroid cells at the expense of maturation, whereas Epo favors terminal differentiation toward a nonreplicating state. To identify the biochemical mechanism for the effects of T3 on erythroid proliferation and differentiation, an immunoblot analysis was performed on key transcription factors and cell cycle regulators. The effects of T3 were quite striking as the levels of erythroid-restricted transcription factors EKLF, NF-E2, and GATA-1 rose 3–10-fold when T3 concentrations were reduced (Fig.5, left). In addition, withdrawal of T3 resulted in a 20-fold increase in p27Kip1, a cell cycle inhibitor important for the maturation of erythroid cells (47Fero M.L. Rivkin M. Tasch M. Porter P. Carow C.E. Firpo E. Polyak K. Tsai L.H. Broudy V. Perlmutter R.M. Kaushansky K. Roberts J.M. Cell. 1996; 85: 733-744Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1333) Google Scholar, 48Hsieh F.F. Barnett L. Green W.F. Freedman K. Matushansky I. Skoultchi A.I. Kelley L.L. Blood. 2000; 96: 2746-2754Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast, no change was observed in p57Kip2 (Fig. 5, right). Interestingly, the Lyn and TRα content doubled when cells were cultured in T3-depleted media. These observations provide biochemical explanations for enhanced differentiation and restricted replication after T3 withdrawal i.e. raised GATA-1, EKLF, and NF-E2 facilitate red cell maturation, whereas elevated p27Kip1 enables cells to exit the cell cycle and enter the terminally differentiated state. At this stage it is unclear whether the addition of T3 increases the frequency of immature cells containing less EKLF, NF-E2, and GATA-1 or directly reduces the expression of these factors in erythroid cells. To determine whether Trip-1 could simultaneously regulate differentiation signaling by Epo and proliferation promoted by T3, a truncated Trip-1 (tTrip-1) encompassing the Lyn-binding domain (Fig.1 D) was introduced into J2E cells. Numerous independently isolated transfectants were termed JCs cells, whereas the antisense controls were labeled JCα. Significantly, tTrip-1 had a marked inhibitory effect on Epo-induced hemoglobin production and morphological maturation; very few hemoglobin-synthesizing cells were detected in JCs cultures, and the cells were incapable of proceeding beyond the proerythroblast/basophilic erythroblast boundary of maturation (Fig. 6, A andB). Moreover, T3-induced proliferation was severely impeded (Fig. 6 C). In contrast, the antisense controls behaved like control cells or those infected with the retroviral vector alone (data not shown). These data demonstrate that the truncated Trip-1 acted in a dominant negative manner and had a profound impact on both Epo-induced differentiationand T3-promoted cell division. The effect of tTrip-1 on normal erythroid progenitors was investigated by infecting fetal liver cells and observing colony formation. Consistent with the effects of tTrip-1 on cell lines, the truncated Trip-1 decreased the number of Epo-induced BFU-E and CFU-E (Fig.7 A). Furthermore, tTrip-1 greatly diminished the ability of T3 pre-incubation to expand the progenitor compartment (Fig. 7 B). It was concluded from these experiments that Trip-1 plays an important role in regulating the responses of normal as well as immortalized erythroid cells to Epo and T3. The biochemical mechanisms by which tTrip-1 inhibited Epo and T3 action were then investigated. The inhibition of Epo-induced differentiation by tTrip-1 coincided with the elimination of Lyn but not other tyrosine kinases such as Fyn, Src, Syk, Lck, and Hck (Fig. 8 A and data not shown). Conversely, the elevated levels of p27Kip1 in JCs cells correlated with reduced proliferation (Fig. 8 A). However, the inability to differentiate was not caused by a reduction in GATA-1, EKLF, NF-E2, globins, or endogenous Trip-1 (Fig.8 A), nor was it due to restricted phosphorylation of the Epo receptor or STAT5 (data not shown). It is noteworthy that the antisense control did not affect Trip-1 protein levels, validating its use as an additional control (Figs. 6 and 7). To determine whether tTrip-1 also interfered with T3-induced transcription, activation of T3response elements was examined in JCs cells. The cells were transfected with either direct repeats or inverted palindromes of the T3 response elements and were then exposed to T3. Significantly tTrip-1 negated the T3responsiveness of both elements (Fig. 8 B and data not shown). It was concluded from this series of experiments that tTrip-1 blocked erythroid differentiation and proliferation by suppressing endogenous Lyn, increasing p27Kip1 and interfering with the transcriptional activity of T3 response elements. Trip-1 localized primarily in the cytoplasm of uninduced erythroid cells (Fig. 2). The subcellular localization of this protein was then examined in cells stimulated with Epo or when T3 was withdrawn from culture. Strikingly, cytoplasmic Trip-1 translocated to discrete nuclear regions after 30 min of exposure to Epo or removal of T3 (Fig.9, A and B). Altering the compartmental balance of Trip-1, therefore, coincided with enhanced differentiation and reduced replication. Trip-1 also relocated to the nucleus in JCs cells (data not shown), indicating that the inhibitory effects of tTrip-1 were not due to impaired nuclear translocation. In this article we have demonstrated that Trip-1, a transcriptional regulator of TRα (34Swaffield J.C. Melcher K. Johnston S.A. Nature. 1995; 374: 88-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar, 36vom Baur E. Zechel C. Herry D. Heine M.J.S. Garnier J.M. Vivat V. Le Douarin B. Gronemeyer H. Chambon P. Losson R. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 110-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar), associates with the tyrosine kinase Lyn in erythroid cells. The interaction between Lyn and Trip-1 was initially identified by a yeast two-hybrid screen and was confirmed by in vitro binding, co-immunoprecipitations, and intracellular co-localization (Figs. 1 and 2). Because Lyn is involved in the Epo signaling cascade (27Tilbrook P.A. Ingley E. Williams J.H. Hibbs M.L. Klinken S.P. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 1610-1619Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar, 29Chin H.

Williams J.H. Ingley E. Schneider-Mergener J. Krystal G. Klinken S.P. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 2453-2458PubMed Google Scholar), Trip-1 provides a link between pathways mediated by cytokine receptors and nuclear hormone receptors. The parallels between the Trip-1 association with Lyn and TRα and the interaction of p62ORCA with Lck and COUP-TFII are striking. Like Trip-1 and Lyn, p62ORCA associates with Lck (the closest Src kinase family member to Lyn) through phosphotyrosine-independent binding of p62ORCA to the SH2 domain of Lck (49Park I. Chung J. Walsh C.T. Yun Y. Strominger J.L. Shin J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 12338-12342Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the Trip-1/TRα association (34Swaffield J.C. Melcher K. Johnston S.A. Nature. 1995; 374: 88-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar, 36vom Baur E. Zechel C. Herry D. Heine M.J.S. Garnier J.M. Vivat V. Le Douarin B. Gronemeyer H. Chambon P. Losson R. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 110-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar) is similar to p62ORCA interacting with the nuclear hormone receptor COUP-TFII (50Marcus S.L. Winrow C.J. Capone J.P. Rachubinski R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 27197-27200Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar), which has been implicated in the regulation of globin genes (51Filipe A. Li Q.L. Deveaux S. Godin I. Romeo P.H. Stamatoyannopoulos G. Mignotte V. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 687-697Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Marcus et al. (50Marcus S.L. Winrow C.J. Capone J.P. Rachubinski R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 27197-27200Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar) proposed “a role for ORCA and related factors in mediating cross-talk among distinct signal transduction pathways important for cellular growth and differentiation.” Here we have provided the biological and biochemical evidence to support this proposition and have shown that Trip-1 can modulate pathways activated by Epo and T3. The dominant negative effects of the truncated Trip-1 were quite profound, as it simultaneously inhibited Epo-induced differentiation in immortalized and normal erythroid cells and suppressed T3-mediated proliferation. The introduction of tTrip-1 resulted in a complete loss of endogenous Lyn, increased p27Kip1, and an inability to activate T3response elements. As Trip-1 is also a component of the 26-S proteasome (45Rubin D.M. Coux O. Wefes I. Hengartner C. Young R.A. Goldberg A.L. Finley D. Nature. 1996; 379: 655-657Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar), perhaps the truncated Trip-1 fosters proteasomal degradation of Lyn. The importance of Trip-1 to the T3 pathway was illustrated by the suppression of T3 response elements with the truncated Trip-1. It is noteworthy that Trip-1 localized with Lyn and TRα in the cytoplasm/plasma membrane of uninduced erythroid cells and then translocated to discrete nuclear foci within 30 min of Epo stimulation or after withdrawal of T3. To our knowledge this is the first description of Trip-1 relocation between subcellular compartments correlating with enhanced differentiation. Studies are currently under way to determine the nature of these nuclear structures and their function during erythroid maturation. Epo and T3 had major effects on erythroid maturation in both cell lines and normal progenitors. Whereas Epo promoted differentiation (manifest by hemoglobin synthesis and morphological maturation), T3 stimulated proliferation at the expense of terminal differentiation. Similarly, it has been shown that T3 prevents hemoglobin production by NFS-60 cells and increases the erythrocyte yield from erythroblasts (18Perrin M.C. Blanchet J.P. Mouchiroud G. Hematol. Cell Ther. 1997; 39: 19-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar, 20Zenke M. Munoz A. Sap J. Vennstrom B. Beug H. Cell. 1990; 61: 1035-1049Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). Our data with normal erythroid progenitors confirm that T3 inhibits colony formation (18Perrin M.C. Blanchet J.P. Mouchiroud G. Hematol. Cell Ther. 1997; 39: 19-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). However, we also demonstrated that T3 is able to expand the erythroid progenitor compartment prior to Epo stimulation, which supports the notion that the effects of T3 may be stage-specific (18Perrin M.C. Blanchet J.P. Mouchiroud G. Hematol. Cell Ther. 1997; 39: 19-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar, 19Schroeder C. Gibson L. Zenke M. Beug H.

Withdrawal of T3 from erythroid cells produced large increases in erythroid-restricted transcription factors GATA-1, EKLF, and NF-E2, which have been strongly implicated in the control of red cell maturation, especially in hemoglobin production (52Miller I.J. Bieker J.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 2776-2786Crossref PubMed Scopus (648) Google Scholar, 53Tsai S. Martin D.I.K. Zon L.I. D'Andrea A.D. Wong G.G. Orkin S.H.

Nature. 1993; 362: 722-728Crossref PubMed Scopus (566) Google Scholar). Increasing the concentration of these transcription factors, therefore, promotes differentiation. Cross-regulation of these nuclear proteins may also be important because TRα and COUP-TFII together suppress GATA-1 transcription (57Trainor C.D. Evans T. Felsenfeld G. Mol. Endocrinol. 1995; 9: 1135-1146PubMed Google Scholar), whereas TRα is able to associate directly with NF-E2 (58Cheng X. Reginato M.J. Andrews N.C. Lazar M.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 1407-1416Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Altering the concentration, activity, or combinations of these DNA proteins can have a major impact upon expression of genes required for red cell maturation. Removal of T3 also caused a marked elevation in p27Kip1, which is significant because entry of erythroid cells into the noncycling, terminally differentiated state involves increasing p27Kip1 levels (48Hsieh F.F. Barnett L. Green W.F. Freedman K. Matushansky I. Skoultchi A.I. Kelley L.L. Blood. 2000; 96: 2746-2754Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, terminal differentiation was enhanced by the combination of cell cycle exit and elevated transcription factor levels. It is conceivable that the Epo/T3 axis provides a complementary mechanism for expanding erythroid progenitors and increasing cell numbers before terminal differentiation to generate the correct number of functionally mature red blood cells. As TRα has been proposed to act as a switch between proliferation and differentiation (24Bauer A. Mikulits W. Lagger G. Stengl G. Brosch G. Beug H.

However, a new model of Triton's atmosphere, in which only solar radiation is present, predicts a large column of carbon atoms. With an assumed, but reasonable, rate of charge transfer between N2(+) and C, a peak C+ abundance results that is close to the peak electron densities measured by Voyager in Triton's ionosphere. These results suggest that Triton's upper atmospheric chemistry may thus be solar-controlled. Measurement of key reaction rate constants, currently unknown or highly uncertain at Triton's low temperatures, would help to clarify the chemical and physical processes occurring in Triton's atmosphere."

In mammalian cells, responses to TGF-β are mediated by type I and type II cell surface receptors, which are expressed in most tissues (1Massague J. Wotton D.

TGF-β1, which is the prototype of the TGF-β family, elicits its effects by binding to a heteromeric complex of transmembrane Ser/Thr kinase receptors cloned as type I and type II receptors. The TGF-β type II receptor (ΤβR-II) binds TGF-β on its own and recruits and phosphorylates the TGF-β type I receptor (ΤβR-I) in a juxtamembrane domain rich in glycine and serine called the GS box (3Wrana J.L.

Activation of the type I receptor leads to the phosphorylation of members of the Sma- and Mad- related factors (Smads) (4Liu F. Hata A. Baker J.C. Doody J. Carcamo J. Harland R.M. Massague J.

By these mechanisms, TGF-β1 activates the transcription of mammalian genes important for cell cycle regulation and for extracellular matrix formation and may also promote immunosuppressive responses. Based on these functions, the use of TGF-β agonists or antagonists could be of considerable interest in human therapy to prevent or exacerbate TGF-β responses. A better understanding of the mechanisms by which TGF-β could have beneficial or deleterious effects in various physiological processes is obtained through the generation of molecular tools that allow novel routes of investigation. The recent generation of transgenic mice either lacking the functional gene for TGF-β or overexpressing TGF-β in brain has greatly aided our understanding of the role that TGF-β plays in many systems. For example, targeted disruption of the TGF-β1 gene in mice causes enhanced inflammatory responses leading to early death (9Shull M.M. Ormsby I. Kier A.B. Pawlowski S. Diebold R.J. Yin M. Allen R.

Overexpression of brain-derived TGF-β promotes vascular amyloidogenesis, a histopathological hallmark of Alzheimer's disease (11Wyss-Coray T. Masliah E. Mallory M. McConlogue L. Johnson-Wood K.

Recently a better understanding of the pathophysiological actions of TGF-β have been obtained through the use of recombinant soluble TGF-β type II receptors as TGF-β antagonists (13Komesli S. Vivien D. Dutartre P. Eur. J. Biochem. 1998; 254: 505-513Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 14Krieglstein K. Richter S. Farkas L. Schuster N. Dunker N. Oppenheim R.W. Unsicker K. Nat.

Biochem. 1998; 254: 505-513Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar), we have generated a soluble type II receptor for TGF-β fused with the Fc region of human immunoglobulin and characterized its ability to prevent TGF-β signaling in mink lung epithelial cells by sequestering the TGF-β peptide. By using this tool, we have demonstrated that blockage of the activity of endogenously produced TGF-β, in a model of cerebral ischemia in rats, enhanced the volume of the damaged tissue (15Ruocco A. Nicole O. Docagne F. Ali C. Chazalviel L. Komesli S. Yablonsky F. Roussel S. MacKenzie E.T. Vivien D. Buisson A. J. Cereb. Blood Flow Metab. 1999; 19: 1345-1353Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). These data suggest that the potentiation of the TGF-β signaling in ischemic brain tissues may represent an innovative approach for the treatment of stroke in man. With the aim to develop agonists or antagonists for TGF-β, we have generated a soluble type I receptor for TGF-β and then tested its potential ability to bind TGF-β1 and to influence both TGF-β-induced transcriptional and cell growth responses. The cDNA encoding the extracellular domain of the human ΤβR-I was amplified by PCR from the plasmid pBlueScript (Stratagene), which contained a full-length cDNA of the receptor (with minimal 5′- and 3′-untranslated regions). The sense primer was 5′-CCGAAGCTTGGCGAGGCGAGGTTTGCTGGGGTGAGGCAGCG-3′ corresponding to a HindIII site (underlined) and to base pairs −76 to −46 of the cDNA preceding the start codon. The antisense primer had the sequence 5′-CGGGGATCCACTTACCTGTTTCCACAGGACCAAGGCC-3′ representing base pairs 357–375, which encoded residues Gly120 to Glu125 immediately preceded by a splice donator site and aBamHI site (underlined). The standard PCR conditions usingPfu DNA polymerase (Stratagene) were as follows: 92 °C for 1 min, 55 °C for 1 min, and 72 °C for 1 min for 30 cycles with a final extension at 72 °C for 7 min. The resulting amplified PCR product was digested with HindIII and BamHI and ligated into the respective sites in the polylinker of the vector pIg-Tail (R&D Systems). The pIg-Tail expression system enables the mammalian production of fusion proteins with a C-terminal Fc tail. The truncated cDNA derived from PCR was sequenced to confirm the fidelity of the reaction. The cDNA encoding the extracellular domain of human ΤβR-II was amplified by PCR and cloned in the polylinker between the EcoRI and BamHI sites of the pIg-Tail (R&D Systems) containing a hygromycin-selectable marker. As a first attempt, the chimeric protein ΤβRIs-Fc was expressed into the medium of transiently transfected COS-7 cells (American Type Culture Collection CRL1651). COS-7 cells were cultured in AIM V medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) and transfected as previously described (53Komesli S. Vivien D. Dutartre P. Eur. J. Biochem. 1998; 254: 505-513Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar) with the recombinant pIg-Tail vector. Following biochemical characterization the chimeric receptor ΤβRIs-Fc was routinely expressed into the medium of cultured Chinese hamster ovary cells (American Type Culture Collection CRL 9618) after a stable double transfection with recombinant pIg-Tail vector and pTK-Hyg vector (CLONTECH). A stable clone was isolated by single-cell cloning. The selected clone was cultured in AIM V medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) in which it loses its adherent properties and forms spheroids. Stable transfected Chinese hamster ovary cells were adjusted to 1.3 × 106/ml, and 15 ml of the suspension were injected into the cell compartment of the CELLine production chamber (CL1000 Integra Biosciences). The nutrient medium reservoir was filled with 1 liter of AIM V medium without antibiotics supplemented with 4.5 g/liter glucose and 4 mm Glutamax (Life Technologies, Inc.). The CELLine was then placed into a 37 °C humidified 5% CO2 incubator. A silicone membrane, at the bottom of the production chamber, allowed gas exchange. The production chamber in which cells were grown was separated from the nutrient medium reservoir by a dialysis membrane permeable to nutrients smaller than 10 kDa. Low molecular weight metabolic products diffused from the 15-ml production chamber, which, in turn, provided nutrients for cell proliferation and protein synthesis. Nutrient medium was exchanged once every week. Cells were harvested 7 days after inoculation. The cell suspension (15 ml) was collected, and the concentration and percentage of viable cells were determined. Once more, 15 ml at 3 × 107 cells/ml were injected into the cell compartment. Cells were harvested three times per week. The human recombinant proteins ΤβRIs-Fc and TβRIIs-Fc were purified by one-step protein A affinity chromatography. To preserve the activity of the purified protein, the pH was immediately neutralized by the addition of a110 volume of 1 m Tris-HCl, pH 9.0 to the collected fractions. The eluted protein was dialyzed overnight against 0.1× phosphate-buffered saline and lyophilized. The purified protein was then analyzed by 10% SDS-PAGE using a precast gel (Novex) followed by silver staining (Silver Staining kit, Novex). The amount of protein was quantified using the Bio-Rad Protein Assay kit (microtiter plate format). Purified recombinant protein was separated by 10% SDS-PAGE and then transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Schleicher & Schuell). The membrane was blocked for 30 min with 10% dry fat milk in pH 7.2 NaCl/Pisupplemented with 0.1% Tween 20. For the analysis of fractions containing ΤβRIs-Fc, the membrane was incubated with goat anti-human IgG Fc (Caltag) then with swine anti-goat IgG conjugated to horseradish (Caltag) peroxidase. As indicated in the corresponding figure, some immunoblots were revealed either with a rabbit antibody raised against human TGF-β1 (a generous gift from P. ten Dijke) or a goat antibody raised against human IgG Fc (Caltag) then with an appropriate secondary antibody conjugated to horseradish peroxidase. The chemiluminescence immunoassay was performed with Renaissance Western Blot Chemiluminescence Reagent (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) following the procedure given by the manufacturer. The FlashPlate (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) is a white 96-well polystyrene microtiter plate with plastic scintillator-coated wells. The FlashPlates were precoated with protein A to allow the immobilization of the chimeric proteins (100 μl of affinity-purified protein at 2.5 μg/ml in pH 7.2 NaCl/Pi) by the Fc portion for 2 h at room temperature. After two washes with binding buffer (128 mmNaCl; 5 mm KCl; 5 mm MgSO4; 1.3 mm CaCl2; 50 mm Hepes, pH 7.6) the wells were treated for 2 h at room temperature with a blocking solution consisting of binding buffer containing 5% bovine serum albumin. After incubation, the wells were washed three times with additional binding buffer containing 1% bovine serum albumin.125I-labeled TGF-β1 (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) was diluted in binding buffer prior to its addition into the wells. The plates were incubated at room temperature for 2 h, then sealed, and counted on a Packard Top Count microplate scintillation counter. A 1-min counting period was used. All determinations were carried out at least in duplicate. Nonspecific binding was determined with an excess of unlabeled TGF-β1 (100-fold). For the competition binding assay, the final concentration of radiolabeled ligand was 600 pm(specific activity, 300–450 Ci/mmol) with final concentrations ranging over 0.001–3 μg/ml for ΤβRIs-Fc and ΤβRIIs-Fc. The Mv1Lu cell line (American Type culture collection CCL-64) was maintained in minimum essential medium (MEM) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (Life Technologies, Inc.). 125I-TGFβ1 (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) binding to monolayer cells was performed following the published procedures (2Vivien D. Bernaudin M. Buisson A. Divoux D. MacKenzie E.T. Nouvelot A. J. Neurochem. 1998; 70: 2296-2304Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). For the competition binding assay, the final concentration of radiolabeled ligand was 40 pm (specific activity, 3000–4500 Ci/mmol) with final concentrations ranging over 0.001–10 μg/ml for ΤβRIs-Fc and ΤβRIIs-Fc alone or associated. Mv1Lu cells were stable transfected (by using the lipofection protocol Transfast (Promega)) with the construct (caga)12MLP-Luc (16Dennler S. Itoh S. Vivien D. ten Dijke P. Huet S. Gauthier J.M. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 3091-3100Crossref PubMed Scopus (1588) Google Scholar) and the selection vector pTK-Hyg (CLONTECH). CAGA reporter vectors were generated using pGL3 basic plasmid (Promega). Transfected cells were plated into 96-well plates (5 × 104 cells/well) using MEM containing 10% fetal calf serum for one night before the assay. The wells were washed three times in MEM, 0% fetal calf serum then cells were incubated at 37 °C, 5% CO2 in MEM, 1% fetal calf serum. After 1 h, increasing concentrations of TGF-β1 (R&D Systems) (25–300 pg/ml) and ΤβRIs-Fc and ΤβRIIs-Fc (0.03–3 μg/ml) were added to the medium. Cells were then harvested 6 h later and assayed for luciferase activity using the Luc-Lite Packard kit as described by the manufacturer. The total light emission was measured using a Packard TopCount microplate luminescence counter. Similar experiments were performed following transient transfection of the (caga)12MLP-Luc in Mv1Lu, DR-26, and R-1B cell lines by using the lipofection protocol (Transfast, Promega). Cells were harvested 20 h after the addition of either TGF-β1 (1 ng/ml) or ΤβRIs-Fc (3 μg/ml) in serum-deficient MEM and assayed for luciferase activity by using a commercial system (luciferase reporter assay system, Promega). Cells were plated 24 h after treatment in 24-well plates containing medium with 10% fetal bovine serum. Medium was replaced with fresh medium containing 1% fetal bovine serum in the presence or absence of TGF-β1 (1 ng/ml) or ΤβRIs-Fc (3 μg/ml) for 20 h. Cells were labeled with [3H]thymidine (1 μCi/ml) (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) for the last 4 h of incubation. Cells were washed three times with cold phosphate-buffered saline, fixed with 5% trichloroacetic acid for 1 h at 4 °C, washed twice with cold 5% trichloroacetic acid, and extracted with 1 n NaOH for 30 min at room temperature. The extracts were collected and counted in a β-counter. The coordinates of the different three-dimensional (3D) structures are found in the Protein Data Bank (PDB) (17Bernstein F.C. Koetzle T.F.

COS-7 cells were transfected with the expression plasmid pIg-Tail containing the cDNA encoding for a truncated TGF-β type I receptor (amino acid residues 1–124) as described in Fig. 1. After one-step purification by affinity chromatography on protein A-Sepharose, a soluble pure chimeric protein was recovered from the medium of cells transiently transfected with the pIg-Tail/ΤβRIs plasmid. Analysis of the purified chimeric receptor was performed by SDS-PAGE under either nonreducing or reducing conditions prior to silver staining or by immunoblotting performed with an antibody raised against human immunoglobulin (Fig. 2). A product of molecular mass of ∼40 kDa was visualized in reducing conditions corresponding to the expected molecular mass of the extracellular domain of ΤβR-I fused with the Fc region of the human immunoglobulin (11 + 30 kDa). However, in nonreducing conditions, immunoblotting revealed products of higher molecular mass (over 100 kDa), which may represent homomeric forms of a secreted chimeric soluble receptor due to the presence of the Fc fragment.Figure 2SDS-PAGE and Western blotting analyses of the recombinant soluble chimeric ΤβRIs-Fc.

Vivien D. Dutartre P. Eur. J. Biochem. 1998; 254: 505-513Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar) in a protein A FlashPlate binding assay. Protein A-coated plastic surfaces within the wells were coated with the purified recombinant ΤβRIs-Fc chimeric receptor allowing the immobilization of the chimeric protein by its Fc portion. Then 125I-TGF-β1 was added in the presence of increasing concentrations of soluble type II receptor. As shown in Fig.3, increasing concentrations of soluble TGF-β type I receptor (from 3 ng/ml to 3 μg/ml) failed to influence125I-TGF-β1 binding (500 pm). However, co-incubation in the presence of similar concentrations of the previously characterized ΤβRIIs-Fc (13Komesli S. Vivien D. Dutartre P. Eur. J. Biochem. 1998; 254: 505-513Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar) revealed125I-TGF-β1 binding to the coated type I receptor with a typical saturation curve. The kinetics of 125I-labeled TGF-β1 binding were performed at room temperature in conditions showing equilibrium binding, achieved after 2–3 h of incubation in the case of the ΤβRIIs-Fc-coated FlashPlate (data not shown). Nonspecific binding, obtained upon ΤβRIs-Fc coating, was determined for each condition in the presence of 200 nm cold TGF-β1 and subtracted from total binding. Similarly, TGF-β1 binding activity to the recombinant TβRIIs-Fc was tested in a precoated protein A FlashPlate binding assay as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The addition of increasing concentrations of the soluble type I receptor cannot compete binding of iodinated TGF-β1 to the precoated TβRIIs-Fc. Based on these observations, two concepts could explain these data. The first one could be that TβRIs-Fc is not capable of binding TGF-β1 on its own, and the second one may be that the TβRIs-Fc is actually binding type II and does not directly contact the ligand. To further characterize the binding properties of the soluble TGF-β type I receptor, 125I-TGF-β1 binding was evaluated in Mv1Lu cells in the presence of increasing concentrations of soluble TGF-β type I (Fig. 4). As expected, increasing concentrations of the soluble TGF-β type II receptor inhibited the binding ability of iodinated TGF-β1 on the Mv1Lu cell line with an apparent IC50 of 0.15 μg/ml. In contrast, increasing concentrations of the soluble type I receptor failed to influence the binding of TGF-β1 in Mv1Lu cells. These data show that extracellular domains of both ΤβR-I and ΤβR-II display the same binding properties that the full-length transmembrane receptors expressed in cell lines (3Wrana J.L. Attisano L. Carcamo J. Zentella A. Doody J. Laiho M. Wang X.F. Massague J. Cell. 1992; 71: 1003-1014Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1372) Google Scholar). To test the properties of the recombinant chimeric TGF-β type I receptor on TGF-β signaling, this component was tested on a model of TGF-β-responsive luciferase reporter gene assay in the presence of exogenous TGF-β1. Following stable transfection in the Mv1Lu cell line, increasing concentrations of TGF-β1 were evaluated for their ability to induce the activation of the previously proposed (16Dennler S. Itoh S. Vivien D. ten Dijke P. Huet S. Gauthier J.M. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 3091-3100Crossref PubMed Scopus (1588) Google Scholar) TGF-β-inducible element, named CAGA box (Fig.5). As shown in Fig. 5 A, TGF-β1 enhances the activity of the CAGA-luciferase reporter gene in the Mv1Lu cell line in a dose-dependent manner. As expected, the soluble TGF-β type II receptor induced a dose-dependent inhibition of the TGF-β1 response (TGF-β1 at 80 pg/ml) (Fig. 5 B). Surprisingly, although ΤβRIs-Fc did not influence the TGF-β-dependent transcriptional activity for a range of concentrations between 30 ng/ml and 1 μg/ml, at the highest concentrations tested (3 μg/ml) it induced a reproducible enhancement of the TGF-β-induced signal (Fig.5 B). Based on these results, similar experiments were performed in the absence of exogenous TGF-β1. As observed in Fig.5 C, the ΤβRIs-Fc induced a marked dose-dependent activation of the TGF-β1-inducible element CAGA box. Altogether these data demonstrate that while a soluble type II receptor could be characterized as a TGF-β antagonist, a soluble TGF-β type I receptor mimicked TGF-β transcriptional activity. Moreover, to address the possibility that immunoglobulin could drive TGF-β receptor heteromerization and subsequent signaling, increasing concentrations of purified whole human immunoglobulin were tested in a TGF-β1-responsive reporter gene assay. As shown in Fig.5 D, whole IgG failed to induce TGF-β1-like signaling. Moreover, the specificity of the TβRIs-Fc-induced transcriptional response was confirmed by data showing that the same type of molecular construct containing the extracellular domain of the type II receptor did not induce any signal (Fig. 5 C). Similar results to those obtained for the transcriptional activity of the TGF-β1-dependent luciferase reporter gene were observed with the antimitogenic effect of TGF-β1 in mink lung epithelial cells. Although TGF-β1 (1 ng/ml) induced a marked decrease of the [3H]thymidine incorporation into the DNA (90% of the control value) (Fig. 6) incubation in the presence of the TβRIs-Fc (3 μg/ml) led to the same effect. These data show that the addition of the soluble TGF-β type I receptor mimicked the growth inhibition induced by TGF-β1 in the Mv1Lu cell line. To further characterize the signaling properties of the ΤβRIs-Fc we used R1-B and DR-26 cell lines subjected to transient transfection of the luciferase reporter gene driven by the TGF-β-responsive element (CAGA box). DR-26 cells are resistant to TGF-β due to a non-sense mutation in the transmembrane region of the endogenous ΤβR-II (3Wrana J.L. Attisano L. Carcamo J. Zentella A. Doody J. Laiho M. Wang X.F. Massague J. Cell. 1992; 71: 1003-1014Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1372) Google Scholar). DR-26 cells lack ΤβR-II at their surface and are unable to bind TGF-β with endogenous ΤβR-I. As shown in Fig. 7, although both TGF-β1 and ΤβRIs-Fc enhance the CAGA-luciferase reporter gene activity in the Mv1Lu cell line (Fig. 7 A), ΤβRIs-Fc is devoid of this activity in the DR-26 cell line (Fig. 7 B). R1-B cells are unable to respond to TGF-β because of the absence of functional TGF-β type I receptor. As observed in Fig. 7 C, the soluble hΤβRIs-Fc failed to restore TGF-β signaling in this model. Overall these results suggest that the soluble TGF-β type I receptor requires functional ΤβR-II and ΤβR-I to transduce its signal. The soluble TGF-β type I receptor is able to form a stable complex with both ΤβR-II and ΤβR-I and to mimic TGF-β1-mediated responsiveness. To further understand this process, we have generated a three-dimensional model of the extracellular domain of TβR-I based on common sequence and structural features with the already known structure of BRIA-ECD (19Kirsch T. Sebald W. Dreyer M.K. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 7: 492-496Crossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar). A model of TβR-I-ECD (PDB entry 1tbi) was constructed using protectin CD59 as a template (25Jokiranta T.S. Tissari J. Teleman O. Meri S. FEBS Lett. 1995; 376: 31-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). The alignment between TβR-I-ECD and CD59 was based on a conserved cysteine pairing pattern and a highly conserved cysteine box (sequence CCXXXXCN). No other similarities between theses two sequences emerged from the alignment. The alignment with BRIA-ECD shows a better conservation of hydrophobic properties and less gaps and insertions than the alignment with CD59 even if only 9 of the 10 cysteine residues are conserved. Four disulfide bridges among the five have been preserved. The new disulfide bridge is easily rebuilt within the model without important distortions. The potential of mean force and the surface potential appear correct according to the validation software Verify3D (data not shown) (26Luthy R. Bowie J.U. Eisenberg D. Nature. 1992; 356: 83-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (2612) Google Scholar). A comparative analysis of the proposed TβR-I-ECD model and the structures of TGF-βs has shown interesting similarities. Although sequences and structures of TGF-βs and TβR-I-ECD are dissimilar and cannot be aligned, five residues with similar properties can be spatially superimposed (Fig.8, A and B). We were able to superimpose an arginine (a lysine in TGF-β2) on a lysine, a tyrosine on a phenylalanine, a histidine on a histidine, a glutamate on an aspartate, and a lysine on a lysine in TGF-βs and in TβR-I-ECD, respectively. In the present study, we have reported that a soluble TGF-β type I receptor could mimic TGF-β1 responses in mink lu"
https://openalex.org/W2031673611,"Observations of Uranus at wavelengths of 2 and 6 centimeters with the Very Large Array were made in 1980 and 1981. The resulting maps of brightness temperature show a subsolar symmetry at 2 centimeters but a near-polar symmetry at 6 centimeters. The 6-centimeter maps show an increase in temperature from equator to pole with some evidence for a warm ""ring"" surrounding the north pole. The disk-average temperatures (147 +/- 5 K and 230 +/- 6 K at 2 and 6 centimeters, respectively) are distinctly lower than recently reported values; these results suggest that the secular increase in temperature reported during the last 15 years has been reversed. The variations in brightness temperature probably reflect variations in ammonia abundance in the planet's atmosphere, but the mechanism driving these variations is still unclear."
