https://openalex.org/W2172209113,"S. typhimurium become resistant to killing by hydrogen peroxide and other oxidants when pretreated with nonlethal levels of hydrogen peroxide. During adaptation to hydrogen peroxide, 30 proteins are induced. Nine are constitutively overexpressed in dominant hydrogen peroxide-resistant oxyR mutants. Mutant oxyR1 is resistant to a variety of oxidizing agents and overexpresses at least five enzyme activities involved in defenses against oxidative damage. Deletions of oxyR are recessive and uninducible by hydrogen peroxide for the nine proteins overexpressed in oxyR1, demonstrating that oxyR is a positive regulatory element. The oxyR1 mutant is also more resistant than the wild-type parent to killing by heat, and it constitutively overexpresses three heat-shock proteins. The oxyR regulatory network is a previously uncharacterized global regulatory system in enteric bacteria."
https://openalex.org/W1996241166,"The multifunctional nature of coated pit receptors predicts that these proteins will contain multiple domains. To establish the genetic basis for these domains, we have determined the exon organization of the gene for the low-density lipoprotein (LDL) receptor. This gene is more than 45 kilobases in length and contains 18 exons, most of which correlate with functional domains previously defined at the protein level. Thirteen of the 18 exons encode protein sequences that are homologous to sequences in other proteins: five of these exons encode a sequence similar to one in the C9 component of complement; three exons encode a sequence similar to a repeat sequence in the precursor for epidermal growth factor (EGF) and in three proteins of the blood clotting system (factor IX, factor X, and protein C); and five other exons encode nonrepeated sequences that are shared only with the EGF precursor. The LDL receptor appears to be a mosaic protein built up of exons shared with different proteins, and it therefore belongs to several supergene families."
https://openalex.org/W2028706937,"The location of cis-acting regulatory sequences within the long terminal repeat (LTR) of the human T cell lymphotropic virus type III (HTLV-III/LAV) was determined. An enhancer element capable of increasing the rate of transcription from a heterologous promoter, irrespective of distance and orientation, is located between nucleotides -137 and -17 (cap site +1). The promoter sequences present near the TATA box respond to heterologous enhancers. The sequences present between nucleotides -17 and +80 are responsive to HTLV-III-associated trans-acting regulatory factors. Activation of these sequences by the viral regulatory factors requires the presence of a functional enhancer. The enhancer requirement is nonspecific, as the enhancer sequences of RSV, HTLV-I, and SV40 can functionally replace the HTLV-III enhancer. These findings define a new type of regulatory element, provide insight into the mechanisms that regulate HTLV-III gene expression, and may help to explain the effects of this virus on infected cells."

https://openalex.org/W2081322983,"Normal mast cells can be propagated in culture when medium is supplemented with interleukin-3 (IL-3). We demonstrate that Abelson-MuLV (Ab-MuLV) infection of mast cells eliminates dependence on IL-3 for growth. By contrast, Harvey, BALB, and Moloney MSV, which also productively infect mast cells, are unable to relieve IL-3 dependence. Ab-MuLV induced IL-3-independent lines express the v-abl-specific transforming protein and have phenotypic characteristics of mast cells. These cells also possess high loning efficiencies in soft agarose and are tumorigenic in nude mice. In addition, Ab-MuLV induces transplantable mastocytomas in pristane-primed adult mice resistant to lymphoid transformation, defining a new hematopoietic target for malignant transformation by this virus. None of the Ab-MuLV-derived transformants express or secrete detectable levels of IL-3 nor is their growth inhibited by anti-IL-3 serum. These results argue that Ab-MuLV abrogation of the IL-3 requirement is not due to an autocrine mechanism."
https://openalex.org/W2141815299,"In some systems, such as the turkey erythrocyte, agonist-promoted phosphorylation of the beta-adrenergic receptor appears to be associated with desensitization of the adenylate cyclase system. This process can be partially mimicked by cyclic AMP analogs. Accordingly, we have investigated the phosphorylation of the pure mammalian beta-adrenergic receptor by the pure catalytic subunit of the cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase. The beta-adrenergic receptor, purified from hamster lung to apparent homogeneity, contains a single polypeptide of Mr approximately 64,000. The receptor can be phosphorylated in vitro by the catalytic subunit of cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase (approximately 2 mol of phosphate (on serine residues) per mol). Isoproterenol, a beta-agonist, promoted a 2-3-fold increase in the rate of receptor phosphorylation which was blocked by the beta-antagonists propranolol and alprenolol. High performance liquid chromatographic tryptic peptide mapping reveals two major phosphorylation sites. Phosphorylated receptor can be completely dephosphorylated by a high molecular weight phosphoprotein phosphatase. The rate of receptor dephosphorylation is enhanced 2-3-fold by isoproterenol and this effect is blocked by alprenolol. The functional significance of receptor phosphorylation was examined using ligand binding and reconstitution techniques. While the binding of isoproterenol and alprenolol to the receptor was unaffected by phosphorylation, the ability of the receptor to interact with the stimulatory guanine nucleotide regulatory protein, as assessed by isoproterenol-promoted GTPase activity, was decreased 24 +/- 1% (mean +/- S.E., p less than 0.001, n = 17). The quantitative extent of receptor phosphorylation and functional impairment are virtually identical to those previously observed when intact turkey erythrocytes were incubated with cyclic AMP. These data provide a direct demonstration of regulation of the function of the isolated beta-adrenergic receptor by cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase."
https://openalex.org/W2007319400,"Abelson virus has been used to transform cells of a murine, factor-dependent myeloid cell line (FD). Factor-independent (FI) cell lines were derived, which expressed the viral genome and were tumorigenic in syngeneic mice. Karyotypic analysis of FI cells before and after passage in vivo indicated that the tumorigenic cells were derived from FD cells. Northern gel analysis of mRNA, bioassay of culture supernatants, and the density-independent growth of the FI cells indicated that the transformation had not induced the synthesis of the hemopoietic growth factors normally required to support the FD cells, that is, granulocyte-macrophage CSF or Multi-CSF. The FD and FI cells displayed similar numbers of cell surface receptors for Multi-CSF (IL-3) and GM-CSF. We conclude that Abelson virus transformation of this line from factor-dependence to factor-independence and tumorigenicity did not involve autocrine stimulation."
https://openalex.org/W2039692177,"The alternate expression of flagellin genes in Salmonella is the result of an inversion of a 996 bp segment of chromosomal DNA. We have analyzed the components of this site-specific recombination reaction in an in vitro system derived from E. coil. Efficient Hin-mediated inversion requires the 20,000 MW Hin protein and a proteinase K-sensitive host component. The supercoiled DNA substrate must contain two 26 bp recombination sites in inverted configuration and a 60 bp sequence that increases the rate of recombination over 20-fold. This recombinational enhancer can function at many different locations and consists of at least two noncontiguous sequence domains whose relative orientation, but not precise spacing, with respect to each other is important. Synthetically derived wild-type and mutant recombination sites were constructed to analyze the sequence and structural features that are important within the recombination site."
https://openalex.org/W2077423941,"The subcellular distribution of the type II enzyme of cAMP-dependent protein kinase (cAMP-dPK II) in epithelial and fibroblastic cells was determined by indirect immunofluorescence microscopy. In interphase cells both regulatory (R II) and catalytic (C) subunits were concentrated in a perinuclear area. By comparison of the R II distribution with the location of a bona fide Golgi membrane constituent, this area was identified as the Golgi complex. The cytochemical localization of R II was confirmed by subcellular fractionation. In addition, cAMP-dPK II was associated with microtubule-organizing centers, in particular with mitotic spindle poles. These distributions of cAMP-dPK II probably represent important factors in mediating the effects of cAMP on basic cellular activities ranging from secretion and proliferation to cell shape and motility."
https://openalex.org/W2068151645,"ALV induced erythroblastosis results from the specific interruption of the host oncogene, c-erbB, by the insertion of an intact provirus. Integrated proviruses are oriented in the same transcriptional direction as c-erbB, and expression of truncated c-erbB transcripts is observed. Evidence, including sequence analysis of cDNA clones, indicates that transcription of truncated c-erbB mRNA is initiated in the 5′ LTR of the integrated provirus. This transcript is processed through a series of remarkable splicing reactions to yield viral gag and env sequences fused to erbB sequences. These results establish a novel pathway of promoter insertion oncogenesis that stands in contrast to the pathways used in the activation of c-myc in B lymphomas."
https://openalex.org/W2077685056,"The circumsporozoite (CS) protein of the human malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum may be the most promising target for the development of a malaria vaccine. In this study, proteins composed of 16, 32, or 48 tandem copies of a tetrapeptide repeating sequence found in the CS protein were efficiently expressed in the bacterium Escherichia coli. When injected into mice, these recombinant products resulted in the production of high titers of antibodies that reacted with the authentic CS protein on live sporozoites and blocked sporozoite invasion of human hepatoma cells in vitro. These CS protein derivatives are therefore candidates for a human malaria vaccine."

https://openalex.org/W2095369948,"In a study of recombinant proteins that might be useful in developing a vaccine against malaria, synthetic peptides from the circumsporozoite (CS) protein of Plasmodium falciparum were found to be immunogenic for mice and rabbits. Antibody to peptides from the repeating region of the CS protein recognized native CS protein and blocked sporozoite invasion of human hepatoma cells in vitro. Antibodies to peptides from regions I and II had no biologic activity, although antibody to region I recognized processed CS protein by Western blot analysis. These data support the feasibility of developing a vaccine against the sporozoite stage of the malaria parasite by using synthetic peptides of the repeating region of the CS protein conjugated to a carrier protein."
https://openalex.org/W1559409164,"Pro-opiomelanocortin (adrenocorticotropin/endorphin prohormone) is processed to yield active hormones by cleavages at paired basic amino acid residues. In this study, an enzyme that specifically cleaves at the paired basic residues of this prohormone has been purified from bovine pituitary intermediate lobe secretory vesicles, the intracellular processing site of proopiomelanocortin. This enzyme, named pro-opiomelanocortin converting enzyme, has been characterized as a glycoprotein of Mr approximately 70,000. It has an apparent isoelectric point between 3.5 and 4.0. The pH optimum of the pro-opiomelanocortin converting enzyme is between 4 and 5, but the enzyme is highly active at the intravesicular pH of 5.1-5.6. The enzyme specifically cleaved the Lys-Arg pairs of pro-opiomelanocortin to yield Mr = to 21,000-23,000 ACTH, beta-lipotropin, Mr 13,000 and 4,500 ACTH, beta-endorphin, and a Mr = 16,000 NH2-terminal glycopeptide, the products synthesized by the pituitary intermediate lobe in situ. NH2- and COOH-terminal analysis of the products indicated that the pro-opiomelanocortin converting enzyme cleaves the peptide bond either between the Lys and Arg or on the carboxyl side of the Arg at Lys-Arg pairs of pro-opiomelanocortin. The intracellular localization, pH optimum, and cleavage specificity of the enzyme suggest that it may function as a pro-opiomelanocortin processing enzyme in the pituitary intermediate lobe in vivo."
https://openalex.org/W1518322853,"We have studied transcription of the dihydrofolate reductase gene as cells progress through the cell cycle. We used the techniques of DNA-excess filter hybridization and in vivo pulse labeling of a synchronous population of cells to measure the transcription rate of the dihydrofolate reductase gene in different phases of the cell cycle. Our results indicate that the dihydrofolate reductase gene is cell cycle regulated at the transcriptional level. The transcription rate is low in G1, increases 7-fold at the beginning of S phase, decreases almost immediately thereafter, and remains low throughout the remainder of S and into G2. This cell cycle regulation seen in the G1 to S phase transition is achieved by increasing the rate of transcription from a single promoter region. The fact that this region is similar to promoter regions of other housekeeping genes suggests that this type of regulation may not be unique to dihydrofolate reductase."
https://openalex.org/W1979822004,"Mu transposition works efficiently in vitro and generates both cointegrate and simple insert products. We have examined the reaction products obtained under modified in vitro reaction conditions that do not permit efficient initiation of DNA replication. The major product is precisely the intermediate structure predicted from one of the current models of DNA transposition. Both cointegrates and simple inserts can be made in vitro using this intermediate as the DNA substrate, demonstrating that it is indeed a true transposition intermediate. The requirements for efficient formation of the intermediate include the Mu A protein, the Mu B protein, an unknown number of E. coli host proteins, ATP, and divalent cation. Only E. coli host proteins are required for conversion of the intermediate to cointegrate or simple insert products. Structures resulting from DNA strand transfer at only one end of the transposon are not observed, suggesting that the strand transfers at each end of the transposon are tightly coupled."

https://openalex.org/W2076024234,"Mature Herpes Simplex Virus (HSV) genomes are cleaved from concatemeric precursors by a site-specific mechanism. These cleavage events are probably coupled to the encapsidation process. Sequences within the terminal repeat of HSV DNA are necessary for the cleavage and packaging reactions, and are also thought to be responsible for high frequency genome isomerization events. Here we present evidence to show that two viral DNA cleavage and packaging signals reside within a 250 bp subfragment of the terminal repeat, that the termini of mature viral DNA are generated by a process involving two separate DNA cleavages at sites distal to the cleavage signals, and that the sequences between these two cleavage sites are duplicated by the DNA maturation system."
https://openalex.org/W1597383241,"The Bacillus subtilis rpoD gene has been sequenced and the primary structure of its product deduced. The molecular weight calculated for the sigma 43 is 42,828. The DNA and protein sequences of sigma 43 exhibit extensive homology to the Escherichia coli rpoD gene and its sigma 70 product, especially in the C-terminal two-thirds of the sequence. Other proteins exhibiting partial homology with sigma 43 include the E. coli nusA protein, the E. coli htpR (heat-shock regulatory gene) product sigma 32, and specific DNA-binding proteins. No amino acid homology was found between sigma 43 and B. subtilis phage SP01 sigma gp28, phage T7 RNA polymerase, or E. coli DNA primase. The gene exhibits a strong ribosomal binding site and a typical rho-independent transcription terminator sequence. A typical transcription terminator sequence was not observed upstream from the sigma 43 gene. The sigma 43 gene may be part of an operon, resembling the situation found in the E. coli sigma operon."
https://openalex.org/W86334536,"The ada gene of Escherichia coli K12, the regulatory gene for the adaptive response of bacteria to alkylating agents, was cloned and placed under the control of the lac regulatory region on a multicopy runaway plasmid, thereby yielding a hybrid plasmid pYN3059. Ada protein with a molecular weight of about 38,000 was overproduced when cells harboring pYN3059 were incubated at 42 degrees C in the presence of a lac inducer, isopropyl-beta-D-thiogalactoside. Taking advantage of overproduction of Ada protein, we purified the protein to apparent physical homogeneity. The purified 38,000-dalton Ada protein transferred the methyl group from the O6-methylguanine residue of alkylated DNA to the Ada protein, per se. Although the Ada protein was degraded to smaller polypeptides when crude extracts or partially purified preparations were incubated in a high ionic-strength buffer at neutral pH, the purified Ada protein remained stable under the same conditions, indicating that the Ada protein may not undergo autodegradation. An amino-terminal sequence and total amino acid composition of the purified Ada protein were in accord with nucleotide sequence of the ada gene, determined by the dideoxy method using M13 phage. It was deduced that Ada protein comprises 354 amino acids and its molecular weight is 39,385. The promoter for the ada gene was determined by S1 nuclease mapping."
https://openalex.org/W2156439743,"We have characterized crp* mutations in E. coli that allow CRP to function without CAMP crp* mutants carrying a deletion of the gene encoding adenylate cyclase (cya) show significant lac expression. Cyclic GMP, normally an ineffective activator of CRP+, can stimulate these mutant CRP*s to permit greater lac expression in vivo. Cyclic AMP binding to the amino-terminal domain of CRP+ induces an allosteric transition that changes the DNA-binding property of the carboxy domain. The CRP* phenotype is caused by substitution of amino acids with bulkier side chains in the D α-helix of the protein's carboxy domain, near the hinge connecting the two domains. These results are consistent with a model in which the mutant CRP*s assume, in part, a conformation normally evoked only by cAMP binding: one in which the relative orientation of the C, D, and F α-helices is altered.

PreSAP biosynthesis is directed by a 1.1-kilobase mRNA. Synthesis and postsynthetic processing of preSAP in Xenopus oocytes result in secretion of a protein with mobility similar to native purified SAP when analyzed by sodium dodecyl sulfate gel electrophoresis. The human SAP gene is on chromosome 1, probably closely linked to the gene for C-reactive protein which encodes the related acute phase reactant found in human plasma."

https://openalex.org/W82133889,"cAMP-dependent protein kinases have been characterized in parietal cells isolated from rabbit gastric mucosa. Both Type I and Type II cAMP-dependent protein kinase isozymes are present in these cells. Type II isozymes were detected in 900, 14,000, and 100,000 X g particulate fractions as well as 100,000 X g cytosolic fractions; Type I isozymes were found predominately in the cytosolic fraction. When parietal cells were stimulated with histamine, an agent that elevates intracellular cAMP content and initiates parietal cell HCl secretion, cAMP-dependent protein kinase activity was increased in homogenates of these cells as measured by an increase in the cAMP-dependent protein kinase activity ratio. Histamine activation of cAMP-dependent protein kinase was correlated with parietal cell acid secretory responses which were measured indirectly as increased cellular uptake of the weak base, [14C]aminopyrine. These results suggest that cAMP-dependent protein kinase(s) is involved in the control of parietal cell HCl secretion. The parietal cell response to histamine may be compartmentalized because histamine appears to activate only a cytosolic Type I cAMP-dependent protein kinase isozyme, as determined by three different techniques including 1) ion exchange chromatography; 2) Sephadex G-25 to remove cAMP and allow rapid reassociation of the Type II but not the Type I isozyme; and 3) 8-azido-[32P]cAMP photoaffinity labeling. Forskolin, an agent that directly stimulates adenylate cyclases, was found to activate both the Type I and Type II isozymes. Several cAMP-dependent protein kinases were also detected in parietal cell homogenates, including a Ca2+-phospholipid-sensitive or C kinase and two casein kinases which were tentatively identified as casein kinase I and II. At least two additional protein kinases with a preference for serine or lysine-rich histones, respectively, were also detected. The function of these enzymes in parietal cells remains to be shown."
https://openalex.org/W2139690747,"Previous studies have shown that the a sequence located at the termini and at the junction between the L and S components is the site-specific, cis-acting sequence mediating the inversions of herpes simplex virus 1 DNA. We constructed mutated a sequences, inserted them into the thymidine kinase gene, and recombined them into the L component of the viral genome. Deletion of Uc or Ub domains of the a sequence did not affect inversions, whereas the deletion of direct repeat #4 (DR4) drastically reduced their frequency. Deletion of both direct repeat #2 (DR2) and DR4 abolished inversions. Recombinational events leading to inversions appear to occur through DR2, and possibly DR4. These results complement previous studies showing that most of one DR1 sequence can also be dispensed with and are consistent with the hypothesis that DR4 and possibly DR2 are the cis-acting sites for the inversions mediated by the a sequence."
https://openalex.org/W1509312708,"Antisera to the human erythrocyte Glc transporter immunoblotted a polypeptide of Mr 55,000 in membranes from human hepatocarcinoma cells, Hep G2, human fibroblasts, W138, and murine preadipocytes, 3T3-L1. This antisera immunoprecipitated the erythrocyte protein which had been photoaffinity labeled with [3H]cytochalasin B, immunoblotted its tryptic fragment of Mr 19,000, and immunoblotted the deglycosylated protein as a doublet of Mr 46,000 and 38,000. This doublet reduced to a single polypeptide of Mr 38,000 after boiling. When Hep G2, W138, and 3T3-L1 cells were metabolically labeled with L-[35S]methionine for 6 h, a broad band of Mr 55,000 was immunoprecipitated from membrane extracts. In pulse-chase experiments, two bands of Mr 49,000 and 42,000 were identified as putative precursors of the mature transporter. The t1/2 for mature Glc transporter was 90 min for Hep G2 cells that had been starved for methionine (2 h) and pulsed for 15 min with L-[35S]methionine. Polypeptides of Mr 46,000 and 38,000 were immunoprecipitated from Hep G2 cells that had been metabolically labeled with L-[35S]methionine in the presence of tunicamycin. This doublet reduced to the single polypeptide of Mr 38,000 after boiling. In the absence of tunicamycin, but not in its presence, mature polypeptide of Mr 55,000 was immunoprecipitated from Hep G2 cells metabolically labeled with D-[3H]GlcN. A polypeptide of Mr 38,000 was observed in boiled immune complexes from the in vitro translation products of Hep G2, W138, and 3T3-L1 cell RNA. Dog pancreatic microsomes cotranslationally, but not posttranslationally, converted this to a polypeptide of Mr 35,000. A model for Glc transporter biogenesis is proposed in which the primary translation product of Mr 38,000 is converted by glycosylations to a polypeptide of Mr 42,000. The latter is then processed via heterogeneous complex N-linked glycosylations to form the mature Glc transporter, Mr 55,000."
https://openalex.org/W2158893070,"Both cDNA and genomic clones encoding the beta subunit of bovine luteinizing hormone (LH) have been isolated and characterized. The nucleotide sequence was determined for the entire gene and 776 base pairs of 5'-flanking sequence. The mRNA cap site and polyadenylation site were mapped by primer extension and S1 nuclease protection, respectively. The bovine LH beta spans less than 1.1 kilobase pairs and has three exons encoding a 550 nucleotide mRNA (excluding the poly(A) tail). Bovine LH beta is a single-copy gene, in contrast to human LH beta, which is a member of the LH/chorionic gonadotropin beta subunit multigene family. Comparison of the bovine LH beta gene with the human LH beta/chorionic gonadotropin gene family reveals a high degree of nucleotide sequence homology, both within the genes and in the 5'-flanking sequences. Despite this extensive sequence conservation, there is a major difference between the two species in the selection of a promoter site. As a result, the bovine LH beta gene produces an mRNA with an usually short 5'-untranslated region of only 6-11 nucleotides."
https://openalex.org/W2027112158,"The envelope gene of HTLV-III, the retrovirus directly linked to AIDS, encodes a protein of 856 amino acids. Our sequence analysis of the cloned HTLV-III (HXB-3) env gene and its comparison with other isolates reveal significant divergence, especially in the external portion of this protein. A large segment of the env gene (1800 bp) was inserted into the expression vector pEV-vrf3, and a corresponding 68 kd protein, which encompasses both the extracellular and the membrane-associated regions of the native protein, was produced in E. coli. Several smaller polypeptides, which appear to be internal initiation products, were also produced. All 50 AIDS patient sera obtained from different locations in the United States specifically recognized the bacterially synthesized envelope proteins, as judged by Western blots. This suggests that these proteins will be useful for the diagnosis of HTLV-III infection and possibly as a vaccine against AIDS."
https://openalex.org/W2088165134,"Eukaryotic microorganisms, as well as higher animals and plants, display many autonomous physiological and biochemical rhythmicities having periods approximating 24 hours. In an attempt to determine the nature of the timing mechanisms that are responsible for these circadian periodicities, two primary operational assumptions were postulated. Both the perturbation of a putative element of a circadian clock within its normal oscillatory range and the direct activation as well as the inhibition of such an element should yield a phase shift of an overt rhythm generated by the underlying oscillator. Results of experiments conducted in the flagellate Euglena suggest that nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+), the mitochondrial Ca2+-transport system, Ca2+, calmodulin, NAD+ kinase, and NADP+ phosphatase represent clock ""gears"" that, in ensemble, might constitute a self-sustained circadian oscillating loop in this and other organisms."
https://openalex.org/W1575243525,"The DNA sequence flanking the gene (lep) encoding signal peptidase I of Escherichia coli has been determined. The upstream flanking sequence contains a gene (lepA) that encodes a polypeptide of 598 amino acid residues and terminates 18 base pairs from the initiation codon of the lep gene.

The lepA gene was cloned into a high expression vector (pIN-III), and its gene product was identified to be a protein of apparent molecular weight of 76,000. This gene product was preferentially localized in the cytoplasmic membrane and periplasmic fractions upon subcellular fractionation. The DNA sequence immediately downstream of the lep gene contains features consistent with a rho factor-independent transcriptional termination site, indicating that the lep operon encodes only two proteins (lepA and lep)."
https://openalex.org/W1954646088,"In an in vitro poliovirus replication system, purified viral polymerase, plus sense virion RNA, and a host factor have been previously shown to be necessary for the transcription of minus strands. We have found that a partially purified eukaryotic initiation factor-2 (eIF-2) fraction from rabbit reticulocytes can replace HeLa host factor in the replicase reaction. This enzyme preparation contains eIF-2 and two other major proteins. In addition to eIF-2 activity, which does not appear to play a role in the replicase reaction, we find that the fraction contains terminal uridylyl transferase activity. The enzyme adds UMP moieties to the 3' end of primer RNA molecules. The number of UMP residues added depends on the primer. Although long tails of heterogeneous lengths (50 to 100 nucleotides) can be polymerized on the 3' end of oligo(U), a poly(A) primer accepts only four U's. The terminal uridylyl transferase activity requires only UTP, Mg2+, a sulfhydryl reagent, and an RNA primer for activity. It is partially associated with ribosomes. We provide preliminary evidence that it may be responsible for host factor-like activity. We present a model for minus strand synthesis by poliovirus replicase, based on the hypothesis that a terminal uridylyl transferase can participate in initiation."
https://openalex.org/W1500994585,"We have observed that the addition of Ca2+ to platelets, permeabilized with saponin, promotes a drastic dephosphorylation of proteins and polyphosphoinositides without inducing platelet responses. Subsequent addition of thrombin could promote secretion of serotonin and aggregation in the absence of phospholipase C-induced breakdown of the inositol phospholipids and protein phosphorylation. This information indicates that activation of saponized platelets by thrombin is independent of the formation of second messengers derived from the phospholipase C-induced breakdown of the inositol phospholipids. The implications of this result for intact platelets are discussed."
https://openalex.org/W1561767449,"We have probed the structure of nucleosomes within the 31-kilobase pair long, transcriptionally active gene for dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) in mouse cells which contain multiple copies of the DHFR gene. We found that the distribution of electrophoretically variant nucleosomes within the DHFR gene is highly nonuniform: variant DHFR nucleosomes are abundant within and in the immediate vicinity of the approximately 200-base pair (bp) long first DHFR exon, and decrease by at least 10-fold within two nucleosomes upstream and downstream from this region. The nonuniformly distributed variant DHFR mononucleosomes are of two electrophoretically distinguishable discrete types. One corresponds to a mononucleosome containing a approximately 180-bp DNA fragment and possibly also histone H1 and high mobility group proteins. The other type of variant DHFR mononucleosome contains a approximately 146-bp DNA fragment, and its changes in relative content within the DHFR gene closely parallel those of the 180-bp variant mononucleosome. Several lines of evidence are consistent with the interpretation that the electrophoretically variant approximately 146-bp (core) mononucleosome species corresponds to diubiquitinated DHFR nucleosomes. We discuss possible causal relationships between the observed nonuniform distribution of variant nucleosomes within the DHFR gene and the DHFR gene transcription."

The affinity of this protein for actin did not change significantly in the presence of various concentrations of KCl and MgCl2, profilin-actin complex concentration being strictly dependent on the critical actin monomer concentration and free profilin concentration. We also examined profilin's interactions with actin in the presence of acumentin, a macrophage protein which inhibits actin monomer exchange at the pointed ends of actin filaments. Low concentrations of this protein caused substantial decreases in estimated profilin-actin complex concentration. The macrophage gelsolincalcium ion complex which blocks exchange at the barbed end of actin filaments, when added to profilin and actin solutions in substoichiometric concentrations, caused large increases in estimated profilin-actin complex concentration. The changes in calculated profilin-actin complex concentration induced by these two actin-modulating proteins were too large to be explained solely by their effects on critical actin monomer concentration."
https://openalex.org/W1970690658,"The phage-encoded proteins required for conservative integration of infecting bacteriophage Mu DNA were investigated. Our findings show that functional gpA, an essential component of the phage transposition system, is required for integration. The Mu B protein, which greatly enhances replicative transposition of Mu DNA, is also required. Furthermore, a truncated form of gpB lacking 18 amino acids from the carboxy terminus is blocked in replicative transposition, but not conservative integration. Our results point to a more prominent role for gpB than simply a replication enhancer in Mu DNA transposition. The ability of a truncated form of B to function in conservative integration, but not replicative transposition, also suggests a key role for the carboxy-terminal domain of the protein in the replicative reaction. The existence of a shortened form of gpB, which uncouples conservative integration from replicative transposition, should be invaluable for future dissection of Mu DNA transposition."
https://openalex.org/W2047259447,"Trypanosomes can change their surface coat either by slotting a different surface antigen gene copy into an active (telomeric) expression site or by activating a new VSG gene expression site and inactivating the old one. How expression sites are activated or inactivated is not clear. We report an exceptional trypanosome variant in which the inactivation of a surface antigen gene is accompanied by a 30 kb DNA insertion 5' of the gene. Transcription of the region upstream of the insertion continues unaltered and retains the characteristic insensitivity to alpha-amanitin of VSG gene transcription units, showing that the expression site is still active. The expressed VSG gene in this trypanosome variant resides in another telomere. Hence, two VSG gene transcription units can be simultaneously active. This argues against a single mobile activating element controlling VSG gene transcription and favors a stochastic model of telomere activation/inactivation."
https://openalex.org/W1533828353,"The transcriptional organization was determined for the DNA polymerase III epsilon subunit (dnaQ) and the ribonuclease H (rnh) genes, which are closely spaced and organized in a face-to-face system (Maki, H., Horiuchi, T., and Sekiguchi, M. (1983) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 80, 7137-7141). Nuclease S1 mapping revealed that transcription starts from a single promoter for rnh and two promoters for dnaQ and proceeds in opposite directions. The 5' terminus of the rnh RNA overlaps about 100 and 20 nucleotide sequences with the 5' terminus of the dnaQ-1 and dnaQ-2 RNA, respectively. The levels of in vivo transcription for the three RNA species increased altogether by more than 10-fold in cells carrying a multicopy plasmid with intact dnaQ-rnh genes, keeping the relative level for the convergent transcription units nearly constant."
https://openalex.org/W1535676260,"Because the nonionic detergent octaethylene glycol dodecyl ether has been used extensively for studies on active solubilized preparations of (Na+ + K+)-ATPase, we tried to see if the detergent alters the properties of the membrane-bound enzyme prior to solubilization. Addition of the detergent, at concentrations below its critical micellar concentration, to reaction mixtures containing the highly purified membrane-bound enzyme reduced the K0.5 of ATP for (Na+ + K+)-dependent ATPase activity without affecting the maximal velocity or abolishing the negative cooperativity of the substrate-velocity curve. Under these conditions, however, the enzyme was not solubilized as evidenced by complete sedimentation of the membrane fragments containing the enzyme upon centrifugation at 100,000 X g for 30 min. Other nonsolubilizing effects of the detergent included an increase in K0.5 of K+, inhibition of Na+-dependent ATPase with no effect on K0.5 of ATP for this activity, and reductions in the spontaneous decomposition rates of the K+-sensitive phosphoenzyme obtained from ATP and the phosphoenzyme obtained from Pi. The nonsolubilizing effects of the detergent on the purified enzyme were obtained with no detectable lag, were readily reversible, and could be distinguished from its vesicle-opening effects on crude membrane preparations. Several other nonionic and ionic detergents had similar effects on the enzyme. The findings indicate (a) detergent binding to hydrophobic sites on extramembranous segments of enzyme subunits; (b) that occupation of these sites mimics the effects of ATP at a low-affinity regulatory site with no effect on high-affinity ATP binding to the catalytic site; and (c) that in studies on detergent-solubilized preparations, it is necessary to distinguish between the effects of solubilization per se and detergent effects at the regulatory site."
https://openalex.org/W1547136412,"In the absence of sodium, sea urchin sperm have an acidic internal pH. The addition of sodium, lithium, or ammonium, but not of potassium ions, induces an internal alkalization. If potassium is added in the presence of sodium, a further alkalization is obtained; in contrast, potassium addition in presence of Li+ or NH+4 does not change the internal pH. The K+-induced pHi change is inhibited by ouabain and when sperm are depleted of their ATP. A large part of the potassium influx is stimulated by Na+, but not Li+, and inhibited by ouabain and cellular ATP depletion. We conclude that activity of Na/K-ATPase pumps located in the plasma membrane of sea urchin sperm could play a role in regulating the internal pH of sea urchin sperm by recycling sodium ions that enter the cell through Na/H countermovements."
https://openalex.org/W1606464636,"The reactions of bromoacetaldehyde (BAA) with recombinant plasmids that contain sequences which can adopt left-handed Z structures or, at other locations, cruciforms were studied as a function of supercoil density. The sequence in pRW756 that undergoes a supercoil induced transition from a right to left-handed helix was (dC-dG)16 and regions near the replication origin of the pBR322 vector were converted from linearforms to cruciforms. The locations of the most nonpaired structural features were mapped by S1 nuclease cleavage of the wedged open duplexes after linearization of the DNAs. Three cruciforms in the pBR322 portions of the plasmids were specifically detected by BAA reaction at physiological supercoil densities (sigma = -0.067). However, the B-Z junctions did not react with BAA under these conditions although the junctions were present since the (dC-dG)16 was shown to be left-handed. Thus, the B-Z junctions have less single-stranded character than the pBR322 cruciforms (3-6 nonpaired bases) and may be fully paired. At much higher superhelical densities (sigma = -0.11-0.12), the B-Z junctions as well as the cruciforms react with BAA indicating a change in the nature of the junctions. Studies were also performed with pRW777 which harbors the mouse kappa immunoglobin sequence (dT-dG)32 . (dC-dA)32 that adopts a left-handed helix under appropriate conditions; the results were similar to those found with pRW756."
https://openalex.org/W1556639221,"A calmodulin-dependent protein phosphatase has been identified in human platelets by its cross-reactivity with an antibody developed against a bovine brain calmodulin-dependent protein phosphatase and by its calmodulin-stimulated dephosphorylation of 32P-labeled substrates. The platelet enzyme was partially purified to separate it from calmodulin and calmodulin-independent phosphatases. The partially purified enzyme was stimulated by calmodulin, requiring 15 nM calmodulin for half-maximal activation. Calmodulin increased the Vmax of the phosphatase, with no significant effect on its Km. The enzyme was stimulated irreversibly and made calmodulin-independent by limited proteolysis. The optimal pH for the phosphatase was 7.5. After partial purification, phosphatase activity was significantly increased in the presence of Mn2+ and Ca2+ over that observed in the presence of Ca2+ alone. The enzyme effectively dephosphorylated casein, histone, protamine, and platelet actin. The holophosphatase was estimated to have a molecular weight of 76,900 as determined by sedimentation on sucrose gradients. Immunoblotting techniques using an antibody against the brain phosphatase suggests that the enzyme consists of 2 subunits of 60,000 and 16,500 daltons; the 60,000-dalton subunit co-migrates in sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis with a 60,000-dalton calmodulin-binding protein in the platelet suggesting that it is the calmodulin-binding subunit of the enzyme. The identification of a calmodulin-dependent protein phosphatase in human platelets suggests a role for Ca2+-dependent dephosphorylation in platelet activation."
https://openalex.org/W81244878,"Abstract Two reservations have previously made interpretation of biological 23Na NMR measurements difficult: the size of the extracellular space penetrated by the shift reagent and the possibility of a 60% reduction in the intensity of the NMR-visible 23Na signal due to quadrupolar interactions (Berendsen, H. J. C., and Edzes, H. T. (1973) Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 204, 459-485; Civan, M. M., Degani, H., Margalit, Y., and Shporer, M. (1983) Am. J. Physiol. 245, C213-C219; Gupta, R. K., and Gupta, P. (1982) J. Magn. Reson. 47, 344-350). We have addressed both these issues using a suspension of rat outer medullary kidney tubules, nephron segments responsible for the fine control of total body volume and electrolyte balance. First, the extracellular space penetrated by the shift reagent dysprosium tripolyphosphate, as defined by the extracellular 23Na resonance, revealed a space similar to that which contained extracellular 35Cl- ions. Measurement of an extracellular 35Cl- space using 35Cl NMR was possible because the intracellular 35Cl- resonance was broadened beyond detection in the cells studied. Second, to characterize the reduction of the 23Na signal by quadrupolar interactions, the intracellular 23Na level was raised artificially by simultaneously inhibiting Na+ efflux and increasing the ion permeability of the plasma membrane. Under these conditions, NMR-observable intracellular Na+ reached a level which was approximately 81% of that in the medium, a level determined using chemical techniques. This observation would suggest that the resonance of the intracellular 23Na pool was not subject to a 60% reduction in signal intensity, as a result of nuclear quadrupolar interaction. The intracellular 23Na level measured, under basal conditions, was 23 +/- 2 mumol/ml of cell water (37 degrees C) (n = 3, S.D.) and was demonstrated to be responsive to a number of physiological stimuli. The level was temperature-sensitive. It was reduced by inhibitors of apical Na+ transport, furosemide and amiloride, and it was raised with (Na+ + K+)-ATPase inhibition. The furosemide and amiloride actions described would suggest that the Na+-transporting mechanisms sensitive to these agents (e.g. Na+/K+/Cl- cotransport system, Na+:H+ exchange system) contribute to the regulation of the intracellular Na+ level in the kidney tubular preparation studied."

https://openalex.org/W1583158669,"Infrared spectroscopy in the amide I region of purified membrane-bound Na,K-ATPase preparation shows that Na+- and K+-bound forms of the enzyme have almost the same secondary structure. No difference is detected in the beta-structure (pleated sheets) content. This is contrary to the statement of the recent paper (Gresalfi, T. J., and Wallace, B. A. (1984) J. Biol. Chem. 259, 2622-2628) where a similar preparation was examined by circular dichroism spectroscopy and it was claimed that net 7% of protein peptide groups undergo a beta-sheet to alpha-helix conformational change upon Na,K-ATPase conversion from the K+ to the Na+ form. The discrepancy of the results is most likely caused by the particulate nature of the enzyme preparations used that could lead to optical artifacts in CD but not in IR measurements. A thorough comparison of IR spectra of these enzyme forms has revealed a very minor spectral difference which could suggest conformational perturbations, if any, of a much lower scale and another type than that claimed by Gresalfi and Wallace. The K+ form tends to absorb slightly more in the region of the alpha-helix band. This could reflect some distortion or a transition to a random coil structure of a small fraction of alpha-helical segments (less than or equal to 2% protein peptide groups) upon the enzyme conversion from the K+ to the Na+ form."
https://openalex.org/W1570048226,"The adenosine kinase enzymes from arabinofuranosyladenine-resistant (araAr) mutants of the baby hamster kidney cell line were analyzed using adenosine kinase-specific antibody probes purified by adenosine kinase-Sepharose column chromatography. Wild-type baby hamster kidney cells were shown to produce two adenosine kinase polypeptides of Mr 43,000 and 40,000. The class I araAr mutants that have no detectable adenosine kinase activity are completely deficient in the two adenosine kinase polypeptides. As expected, the class II araAr mutants, which had been shown to have an altered ribonucleotide diphosphate reductase activity, produce a wild-type level of the two adenosine kinase polypeptides. The five class III araAr mutants which are adenosine-sensitive (AdoS) have various levels of adenosine kinase activity and produced two adenosine kinase polypeptides with similar Mr as that of wild-type cells. The adenosine kinase proteins synthesized by two of the AdoS mutants, ara-19a and ara-74b, differed from wild type in their isoelectric points. These results plus the observations that the AdoS mutants produce adenosine kinase enzymes with altered kinetic properties suggest a point mutation in the adenosine kinase gene. An araAr mutant, ara-60a, with intermediate adenosine sensitivity, was shown to have two truncated adenosine kinase polypeptides. This observation strongly supports the genetic data which suggests that there is only one functional adenosine kinase allele in baby hamster kidney cells and that the two adenosine kinase polypeptides are due to posttranscriptional modification."
https://openalex.org/W1485807811,"The sugar phosphate specificity of the active site of 6-phosphofructo-2-kinase and of the inhibitory site of fructose-2,6-bisphosphatase was investigated. The Michaelis constants and relative Vmax values of the sugar phosphates for the 6-phosphofructo-2-kinase were: D-fructose 6-phosphate, Km = 0.035 mM, Vmax = 1; L-sorbose 6-phosphate, Km = 0.175 mM, Vmax = 1.1; D-tagatose 6-phosphate, Km = 15 mM, Vmax = 0.15; and D-psicose 6-phosphate, Km = 7.4 mM, Vmax = 0.42. The enzyme did not catalyze the phosphorylation of 1-O-methyl-D-fructose 6-phosphate, alpha- and beta-methyl-D-fructofuranoside 6-phosphate, 2,5-anhydro-D-mannitol 6-phosphate, D-ribose 5-phosphate, or D-arabinose 5-phosphate. These results indicate that the hydroxyl group at C-3 of the tetrahydrofuran ring must be cis to the beta-anomeric hydroxyl group and that the hydroxyl group at C-4 must be trans. The presence of a hydroxymethyl group at C-2 is required; however, the orientation of the phosphonoxymethyl group at C-5 has little effect on activity. Of all the sugar monophosphates tested, only 2,5-anhydro-D-mannitol 6-phosphate was an effective inhibitor of the kinase with a Ki = 95 microM. The sugar phosphate specificity for the inhibition of the fructose-2,6-bisphosphatase was similar to the substrate specificity for the kinase. The apparent I0.5 values for inhibition were: D-fructose 6-phosphate, 0.01 mM; L-sorbose 6-phosphate, 0.05 mM; D-psicose 6-phosphate, 1 mM; D-tagatose 6-phosphate, greater than 2 mM; 2,5-anhydro-D-mannitol 6-phosphate, 0.5 mM. 1-O-Methyl-D-fructose 6-phosphate, alpha- and beta-methyl-D-fructofuranoside 6-phosphate, and D-arabinose 5-phosphate did not inhibit. Treatment of the enzyme with iodoacetamide decreased sugar phosphate affinity in the kinase reaction but had no effect on the sensitivity of fructose-2,6-bisphosphatase to sugar phosphate inhibition. The results suggest a high degree of homology between two separate sugar phosphate binding sites for the bifunctional enzyme."
