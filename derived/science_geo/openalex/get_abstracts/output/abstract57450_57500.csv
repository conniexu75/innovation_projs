https://openalex.org/W2157246688,"Abstract A study of the variables in techniques for alkaline hydrolysis of proteins and for chromatographic analysis of the products has led to a method for the accurate determination of tryptophan. Quantitative recoveries of tryptophan are obtained when proteins (1 to 5 mg) are hydrolyzed at 110° or 135° in 0.6 ml of 4.2 n NaOH containing 25 mg of starch. The hydrolysis is performed in polypropylene liners sealed inside glass tubes evacuated to below 50 µm of mercury. Ion exchange chromatography of tryptophan on Beckman PA-35 resin (column height 8 or 12 cm) has been accomplished in 30 to 50 min with pH 5.4 buffer, 0.21 n in Na+. The details in the procedure which make possible complete recovery of tryptophan include: (a) addition of the sample at pH 4.25 instead of at pH 2.2 in order to avoid loss of tryptophan in citrate buffer at acid pH; (b) the use of NaOH instead of Ba(OH)2 to avoid loss of tryptophan by adsorption on BaSO4 or BaCO3; (c) the inclusion of starch as the most effective antioxidant tested; and (d) chromatography with a buffer which separates tryptophan from Ne-(dl-2-amino-2-carboxyethyl)-l-lysine, which can be formed in significant quantities during alkaline hydrolysis. Molar calculations of protein concentrations are based on the results from analysis of an acid hydrolysate run parallel with the alkaline hydrolyses. Integral values (100 ± 3%) have been obtained for the expected number of tryptophan residues in tryptophyl-leucine, human serum albumin, porcine pepsin, sperm whale apomyoglobin, and in bovine α-chymotrypsin, trypsin, deoxyribonuclease, and serum albumin. Since carbohydrate does not interfere, the procedure is applicable to foods and has been tested on normal and opaque-2 maize meals and on wheat flours."

https://openalex.org/W1495386551,"Abstract The mischarged species Val-tRNAile and Phe-tRNAile (both Escherichia coli B) were enzymatically synthesized in a heterologous aminoacylation system under special reaction conditions. When mixed with isoleucyl-tRNA synthetase in the absence of AMP or PPi, Val-tRNAile is very rapidly deacylated at pH 7, 5 mm Mg2+, 15°. On the other hand, isoleucyl-tRNA synthetase does not deacylate Phe-tRNAile. Isoleucyl-tRNA synthetase can form valyl adenylate (Val-AMP) from valine and ATP, but the isoleucyl-tRNA synthetase-bound Val-AMP is rapidly hydrolyzed when confronted with tRNAile (Baldwin, A. N., and Berg, P. (1966) J. Biol. Chem. 241, 839). Since Val-tRNAile is rapidly and specifically deacylated by isoleucyl-tRNA synthetase, it is reasonable to speculate that Val-tRNAile is a transient intermediate in the tRNAile-induced hydrolysis of Val-AMP. This possibility was tested further by kinetic studies of the Val-tRNAile deacylation and the tRNAile-induced hydrolysis of Val-AMP."

https://openalex.org/W1565208875,"Abstract In the absence of deoxynucleoside triphosphates, T4 DNA polymerase functions as a 3' → 5' exonuclease. It has a strong preference for single stranded DNA, which is hydrolyzed 100 times faster than double stranded DNA. Polynucleotides of short chain length (300 residues) are hydrolyzed more rapidly than longer chain polymers (3000 residues) of the same base composition and at the same concentration of termini. A likely explanation for this finding is that the enzyme can bind to internal nucleotides as well as to the 3'-hydroxyl terminus of a polynucleotide, thus inhibiting hydrolysis which only occurs at the 3'-hydroxyl end. The products of hydrolysis are deoxynucleoside 5'-monophosphates and a dinucleotide derived from the 5' terminus of the polynucleotide. In contrast to the polymerization reaction which is stimulated by the product of T4 gene 32, the exonuclease activity is completely inhibited. Escherichia coli DNA, glucosylated T4 DNA as well as a variety of synthetic polydeoxynucleotides are susceptible to the enzyme."
https://openalex.org/W1532296654,"Abstract In an attempt to learn more about the proteolytic enzymes responsible for protein turnover in cells, the effects of various protease inhibitors on protein catabolism in Escherichia coli were examined. Diisopropyl fluorophosphate, phenylmethane sulfonyl fluoride, and toluenesulfonyl fluoride, all of which inhibit serine proteases, were found to decrease protein breakdown in E. coli, starved for a carbon source. These compounds partially inhibited protein breakdown at doses which did not inhibit growth on minimal medium. The effects of the sulfonyl fluorides were reversed by washing the cells. Protein breakdown in starving cells could also be inhibited reversibly by the aromatic diamidines, dibromopropamidine and pentamidine, which are potent trypsin inhibitors. The effects of pentamidine and p-toluenesulfonyl fluoride did not require concomitant protein synthesis. Tosyl lysine chloromethyl ketone, an inhibitor of trypsin, also inhibited protein breakdown in starving cells. A number of other protease inhibitors were tested and found either to have no effect on intact cells or to prevent normal cell growth. These findings suggest that at least one of the enzymes responsible for the increased protein breakdown in starving cells is a serine protease, possibly similar to trypsin. In cells deprived of a carbon or nitrogen source, synthesis of new enzymes should be dependent upon the breakdown of previously existent cell proteins. Treatment with the sulfonyl fluorides or aromatic diamidines inhibited amino acid incorporation into proteins under such conditions, but did not do so in growing cells. Similarly these compounds reversibly inhibited the induction of β-galactosidase and tryptophanase in cells deprived of a carbon or nitrogen source, but did not do so in cells growing on glycerol. The sulfonyl fluorides, the aromatic diamidines, and tosyl lysine chloromethyl ketone did not reduce the relatively low amount of protein breakdown found in growing cells. Growing cells degrade selectively or aberrant proteins, and the rate of protein breakdown in such cells increased markedly when they were grown on amino acid analogs, canavanine or threo-α-amino-β-chlorobutyric acid. This accelerated degradation also was not inhibited by the sulfonyl fluorides or the diamidines. These results thus suggest that there may exist at least two proteolytic systems in E. coli: one operating in all cells, which can degrade abnormal proteins, and one found in starving cells which is sensitive to sulfonyl fluorides and aromatic diamidines."

https://openalex.org/W1509903166,"Abstract The theory and results of solvent structure control on solute behavior for ordinary chemical reactions, generated in other laboratories (e.g. by Arnett and colleagues), were applied to enzyme reactions in water-organic cosolvent binary mixtures. Three kinds of reactions were studied: (a) catalysis of substrate reactions; (b) denaturation, judged by loss of overall activity; (c) renaturation, aided by organic cosolvents after heat denaturation in water, judged by relative activity. The enzymes studied were trypsin, potato acid phosphatase, l-glutamate dehydrogenase, bacterial β-glucuronidase, glucose 6-phosphate dehydrogenase, glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase, and lysozyme. In the critical 0.01 to 0.05 mole fraction region, with four carbon alcohols and sometimes dioxane, the results generally were: (a) the enzymes are slightly (a factor of 1½ to 3 times) more active than they are in water only. Occasionally they are markedly more active (factor of 10 or more). In no case are they less active in the binary mixture than in water unless the critical mole fraction region is exceeded. (b) The cosolvents enhance the tendency to heat denature. (c) They also enhance the tendency to renature at lower temperatures after heating in neat water. As expected from the general results of other laboratories in physical organic chemistry, the lower alcohols and ethylene glycol are much less effective than the higher alcohols in the critical mole fraction ranges. The design of experiments with enzymes and interpretation of the results hinge on the conformationally motile model in all phenomena. There is a good possibility that in vivo enzymes, which in effect are in solvents other than neat water, are more active than they are n strictly aqueous in vitro systems."
https://openalex.org/W1577385599,"Abstract Fatty acyl thioesterase activity in crude Escherichia coli extracts consists of two activities separable by gel filtration. The two enzymes are designated thioesterases I and II from the order in which they are eluted from Sephadex G-100. Thioesterase I, after 8400-fold purification, was homogeneous as judged by acrylamide gel electrophoresis and constant specific activity of the enzyme peak on DEAE-Sephadex. The native enzyme is a tetramer with a molecular weight of 122,000 and a subunit molecular weight of 30,000. Saturated and unsaturated fatty acyl-CoA thioesters of chain length C14 to C18 were the most active substrates with Km values of 4 to 6 µm and turnover numbers of 18,000 and 27,000 per min, respectively. Neither acetyl-CoA nor oxygen esters were hydrolyzed at detectable rates. Of the many active site reagents tested only photoactivated methylene blue and iodoacetamide inhibited thioesterase I. Acid hydrolysis of thioesterase I inhibited with [14C]iodoacetamide yielded [14C]glycolic acid as the major radioactive product, while mild base hydrolysis yielded mainly [14C]-glycolamide. The evidence presented indicates that iodoacetamide inhibits thioesterase I by esterifying an essential carboxyl group."

https://openalex.org/W1507942573,"A deoxyribonuclease has been purified 2000-fold from Hemophilus influenzae Rd. The enzyme requires ATP and Mg2+ for the degradation of both double- and single-stranded DNA. The hydrolysis of single-stranded DNA proceeds at one-tenth the rate of duplex DNA. The enzyme degrades double-stranded DNA by producing large fragments which are then degraded further to oligonucleotides. It appears to degrade preferentially those molecules to which it has already become attached rather than moving randomly from one molecule to another for each bond scission. The limit product consists of 5′-phosphoryl, 3′-hydroxyl-terminated oligonucleotides, ranging in chain length from 1 to about 12 nucleotides. The average chain length of the limit product is 5.9, and the predominant species in the digest are di- and trinucleotides. The purified enzyme has a molecular weight of approximately 270,000 as determined by sucrose gradient sedimentation. However, ATP-dependent DNase activity has also appeared in a smaller species in some purified enzyme preparations, and two active components have been eluted from DEAE-cellulose and hydroxylapatite columns during the purification."
https://openalex.org/W1581308848,"Abstract 1. The formation and properties of the 30 S initiation complex and its subsequent conversion to the 70 S initiation complex have been studied. The 30 S polypeptide chain initiation complex contains fMet-tRNA and intact GTP in equimolar amounts. Incorporation of both species into the complex requires mRNA (f2 RNA, poly (U, G), or A-U-G) and large amounts of initiation factor IF 2. Initiation factor IF 1 stimulates 30 S complex formation. 2. Addition of 50 S subunits to the isolated 30 S complex results in the hydrolysis of all bound GTP to GDP and Pi. In the absence of 50 S subunits, no hydrolysis occurs. Concurrently a 70 S couple is formed and fMet-tRNA in the complex becomes available for peptidyl transfer. 3. Under appropriate conditions the 30 S complex can be depleted of its complement of GTP while retaining a full complement of fMet-tRNA. GTP released in this manner remains intact. Such a GTP-deficient 30 S complex can still accept 50 S subunits to form a 70 S couple and can still donate fMet into peptide linkage. 4. At the low (catalytic) levels of factor IF 2 necessary for GTP-dependent 70 S initiation complex formation using a mixture of ribosomal subunits, 5'-guanylyl methylene diphosphonate (GMP-PCP) does not replace GTP. At the high (stoichiometric) levels of IF 2 necessary for GTP-dependent 30 S initiation complex formation, GMP-PCP can substitute for GTP in promoting 30 S complex formation. The GMP-PCP-stimulated 30 S complex can then accept a 50 S subunit to form a 70 S couple. However, this complex is inactive in subsequent peptidyl transfer. 5. A model for the initiation process is presented which suggests that a GTP-dependent translocation of fMet-tRNA does not occur. Rather, it is postulated that fMet-tRNA binds directly to the donor site equivalent on the 30 S subunit. Upon 50 S addition, a 70 S couple is formed. GTP hydrolysis serves to release IF 2 and GTP from the initiation complex. Released IF 2 recycles to catalyze another round of initiation. Release of GTP and IF 2 also serves to unblock fMet-tRNA for peptidyl transfer."

https://openalex.org/W2021160671,"PLASMA membranes isolated from bovine olfactory epithelium containing large numbers of olfactory receptors cells are characterized bya high lipid, and especially phospholipid, content1. Odorant molecules are lipoid-soluble, and so this suggests that the interaction of odorant molecules with the lipid layer of the olfactory receptor membrane is important in olfactory reception. We have therefore examined the effect of various odorants on lipid monolayers from olfactory epithelium and propose a theory for the mechanism of olfactory reception."

https://openalex.org/W1536086891,"Bromopyruvate inactivates the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex of Escherichia coli in a thiamine pyrophosphate (TPP)-dependent process. The catalytic activities of the individual enzyme components within the complex are not destroyed by bromopyruvate under similar conditions, but the activities of the pyruvate dehydrogenase and dihydrolipoyl dehydrogenase components are reduced in thiamine pyrophosphate-independent processes. Radioactivity from [2-14C]bromopyruvate is irreversibly bound in the presence or absence of thiamine pyrophosphate, but the amount of radioactivity bound in the presence of thiamine pyrophosphate is 3.9 times the amount bound in its absence. The data are consistent with the interpretation that TPP-dependent inactivation involves the action of bromopyruvate as an irreversible inhibitor which is directed into the complex by specific, but not necessarily irreversible, interaction with the pyruvate dehydrogenase component and ultimately blocks some site within the complex which is essential for catalytic activity in the over-all reaction but not in partial reactions catalyzed by the component enzymes."

https://openalex.org/W1545789413,"Abstract 2,3-Butanedione (biacetyl) was found to modify an arginyl residue in porcine pepsin at pH 6.0, 25°. In an inhibition study, half-inactivation occurred after 2½ hours of reaction, and maximum inactivation of 80 to 85% was reached after 24 hours. Amino acid analysis of the modified pepsin revealed that 1 arginine residue remained, indicating that 1 arginine residue had been modified. The loss of activity and loss of arginine occurred concomitantly during the course of reaction. The presence of substrates retarded enzyme inactivation, as well as arginine loss, at corresponding rates. Porcine pepsinogen treated with biacetyl in a pH 7.0 solution did not lose activity significantly, as shown by its proteolytic activity after subsequent activation by acid. Biacetyl-modified pepsin continued to be susceptible to specific esterification reagents: diazoacetyl-dl-norleucine methyl ester, p-bromophenacyl bromide, and 1,2-epoxy-3-(p-nitrophenoxy)propane. Peptides from a chymotryptic digest of pepsin and of biacetyl-treated pepsin were separated by high voltage paper electrophoresis at pH 6.5. Two peptides were isolated, containing one each of the only 2 arginine residues of pepsin. The sequences of these peptides were ascertained from amino acid compositions and amino-terminal determinations. One of the peptides (A1) from biacetyl-pepsin contained almost no free arginine. An additional spot, apparently representing modified arginine, was observed for the digest of Peptide A1 in high voltage electrophoresis. These results indicated that the arginyl residue in Peptide A1, located 12 residues from the carboxyl terminus of pepsin, is the site of biacetyl modification. This arginyl residue apparently does not directly participate in the catalysis of the enzyme. Biacetyl was also found to inactivate other gastric proteases in similar fashion, i.e. human gastricsin, human pepsin, and bovine rennin."
