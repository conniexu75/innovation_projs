 worked primarily with Frank Exner. At the time, Exner was building a million-volt x-ray machine for use in his research. This
 article was a result of the collaboration between the two scientists in which they utilized Exner's machine to analyze
 bacteriophages."

S. Commissioner of Fisheries. Little did I realize then that I would have the privilege and honor, two decades later, to study fishes and share the same laboratories and office rooms with such an eminent and internationally known and highly start..... honored scientist. It is my intention in this memorial number of COPEIA to review certain aspects of Dr. Smith's life and contributions to science. Dr. Smith came from one of the oldest fami i es in Washington, as he represented the fifth generation born in the District of Columbia and his grandchildren the seventh. He was born November 21, 1865, near 5th and M Streets, N.W. His mother, a Hazard of Virginia, was born on a farm adjoining Wakefield, where George Washington started life. His father, Thomas Croggon Smith, was a well-known and much loved physician in Washington from his graduation in 1864 to his death in 1913. The real name of the family may be said to be Howard-not Smith-because the grandparent, five generations previous to Dr. H. M. Smith, when a small boy, started from England in a sailing ship with his parents, Mr. and Mrs. Howard. On the way both died and the boy was cared for by fellow passengers named Smith, who settled in Maryland where they brought him up and he became known by his foster parents' name. Dr. H. M. Smith began his natural history studies when he was a small boy, owing largely to his father's interest in the birds, snakes, and other small animals on his farm in Virginia. Several hundred of these specimens, collected before Smith was 18 years of age, were still in his possession. During Smith's attendance at Central High School, D.C., he was made first president of the Natural History Society which he helped organize and while in this office obtained specimens and display cases from Prof. Spencer Fullerton Baird. Upon graduating in 1884 he secured work in the bird department of the United States National Museum under Mr. Robert Ridgeway, Curator of Birds. Later he was transferred to the Library and on January 1, 1886, to"
