https://openalex.org/W2781889220,"The present study aims to elucidate the state of gender equality in high-quality research by analyzing the representation of female authorships in the last decade (from 2008 to 2016).Based on the Gendermetrics platform, 293,557 research articles from 54 journals listed in the Nature Index were considered covering the categories Life Science, Multidisciplinary, Earth & Environmental and Chemistry. The core method was the combined analysis of the proportion of female authorships and the female-to-male odds ratio for first, co- and last authorships. The distribution of prestigious authorships was measured by the Prestige Index.29.8% of all authorships and 33.1% of the first, 31.8% of the co- and 18.1% of the last authorships were held by women. The corresponding female-to-male odds ratio is 1.19 (CI: 1.18-1.20) for first, 1.35 (CI: 1.34-1.36) for co- and 0.47 (CI: 0.46-0.48) for last authorships. Women are underrepresented at prestigious authorships compared to men (Prestige Index = -0.42). The underrepresentation accentuates in highly competitive articles attracting the highest citation rates, namely, articles with many authors and articles that were published in highest-impact journals. More specifically, a large negative correlation between the 5-Year-Impact-Factor of a journal and the female representation at prestigious authorships was revealed (r(52) = -.63, P < .001). Women publish fewer articles compared to men (39.0% female authors are responsible for 29.8% of all authorships) and are underrepresented at productivity levels of more than 2 articles per author. Articles with female key authors are less frequently cited than articles with male key authors. The gender-specific differences in citation rates increase the more authors contribute to an article. Distinct differences at the journal, journal category, continent and country level were revealed. The prognosis for the next decades forecast a very slow harmonization of authorships odds between the two genders."
https://openalex.org/W2549029187,"Because of their abundance and their amenability to high-throughput genotyping techniques, Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs) are powerful tools for efficient genetics and genomics studies, including characterization of genetic resources, genome-wide association studies and genomic selection. In wheat, most of the previous SNP discovery initiatives targeted the coding fraction, leaving almost 98% of the wheat genome largely unexploited. Here we report on the use of whole-genome resequencing data from eight wheat lines to mine for SNPs in the genic, the repetitive and non-repetitive intergenic fractions of the wheat genome. Eventually, we identified 3.3 million SNPs, 49% being located on the B-genome, 41% on the A-genome and 10% on the D-genome. We also describe the development of the TaBW280K high-throughput genotyping array containing 280,226 SNPs. Performance of this chip was examined by genotyping a set of 96 wheat accessions representing the worldwide diversity. Sixty-nine percent of the SNPs can be efficiently scored, half of them showing a diploid-like clustering. The TaBW280K was proven to be a very efficient tool for diversity analyses, as well as for breeding as it can discriminate between closely related elite varieties. Finally, the TaBW280K array was used to genotype a population derived from a cross between Chinese Spring and Renan, leading to the construction a dense genetic map comprising 83,721 markers. The results described here will provide the wheat community with powerful tools for both basic and applied research."
https://openalex.org/W2770740042,"Synthetic biology builds upon the foundation of engineering principles, prompting innovation and improvement in biotechnology via a design-build-test-learn cycle. A community-wide standard in DNA assembly would enable bio-molecular engineering at the levels of predictivity and universality in design and construction that are comparable to other engineering fields. Golden Gate Assembly technology, with its robust capability to unidirectionally assemble numerous DNA fragments in a one-tube reaction, has the potential to deliver a universal standard framework for DNA assembly. While current Golden Gate Assembly frameworks (e.g. MoClo and Golden Braid) render either high cloning capacity or vector toolkit simplicity, the technology can be made more versatile—simple, streamlined, and cost/labor-efficient, without compromising capacity. Here we report the development of a new Golden Gate Assembly framework named Mobius Assembly, which combines vector toolkit simplicity with high cloning capacity. It is based on a two-level, hierarchical approach and utilizes a low-frequency cutter to reduce domestication requirements. Mobius Assembly embraces the standard overhang designs designated by MoClo, Golden Braid, and Phytobricks and is largely compatible with already available Golden Gate part libraries. In addition, dropout cassettes encoding chromogenic proteins were implemented for cost-free visible cloning screening that color-code different cloning levels. As proofs of concept, we have successfully assembled up to 16 transcriptional units of various pigmentation genes in both operon and multigene arrangements. Taken together, Mobius Assembly delivers enhanced versatility and efficiency in DNA assembly, facilitating improved standardization and automation."
https://openalex.org/W2782502410,"Sexual orientation encompasses three dimensions: sexual identity, attraction and behaviour. There is increasing demand for data on sexual orientation to meet equality legislation, monitor potential inequalities and address public health needs. We present estimates of all three dimensions and their overlap in British men and women, and consider the implications for health services, research and the development and evaluation of public health interventions.Analyses of data from Britain's third National Survey of Sexual Attitudes and Lifestyles, a probability sample survey (15,162 people aged 16-74 years) undertaken in 2010-2012.A lesbian, gay or bisexual (LGB) identity was reported by 2·5% of men and 2·4% of women, whilst 6·5% of men and 11·5% of women reported any same-sex attraction and 5·5% of men and 6·1% of women reported ever experience of same-sex sex. This equates to approximately 547,000 men and 546,000 women aged 16-74 in Britain self-identifying as LGB and 1,204,000 men and 1,389,000 women ever having experience of same-sex sex. Of those reporting same-sex sex in the past 5 years, 28% of men and 45% of women identified as heterosexual.There is large variation in the size of sexual minority populations depending on the dimension applied, with implications for the design of epidemiological studies, targeting and monitoring of public health interventions and estimating population-based denominators. There is also substantial diversity on an individual level between identity, behaviour and attraction, adding to the complexity of delivering appropriate services and interventions."
https://openalex.org/W2782059439,"Consumer physical activity tracking devices (PATs) have gained popularity to support individuals to be more active and less sedentary throughout the day. Wearable PATs provide real-time feedback of various fitness-related metrics such as tracking steps, sedentary time, and distance walked. The purpose of this study was to examine the prevalence and correlates of PAT ownership and use among a population-based sample of adults. A representative sample of adults ≥18 years (N = 1,215) from Alberta, Canada were recruited through random-digit dialing and responded to a questionnaire via computer-assisted telephone interviewing methods in summer 2016. Questionnaires assessed demographic and health behaviour variables, and items were designed to assess PAT ownership and usage. Logistic regression analysis (odds ratios) was used to assess correlates of PAT ownership and use. On average, participants (N = 1,215) were 53.9 (SD 16.7) years and 50.1% were female. Of the sample, 19.6% (n = 238) indicated they currently own and use a PAT. Participants who owned a PAT wore their device on average 23.2 days within the past month. Currently owning a PAT was significantly associated with being female (OR = 1.41, CI: 1.10 to 1.82), being <60 years of age (OR = 1.86, CI: 1.37 to 2.53), having at least some post secondary education (OR = 1.88, CI: 1.36 to 2.60), having a BMI ≥25 (OR = 1.52, CI: 1.16 to 1.99), and meeting physical activity guidelines (OR = 1.45, CI: 1.12 to 1.88). Similar correlates emerged for PAT use. Correlates significantly associated with PAT use and ownership included being female, being less than 60 years of age, having a post-secondary education, meeting physical activity guidelines, and being overweight/obese. This is the first study to examine characteristics of PAT ownership and use among Canadian adults."
https://openalex.org/W2781783863,"Poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP)10 is a PARP family member that performs mono-ADP-ribosylation of target proteins. Recent studies have linked PARP10 to metabolic processes and metabolic regulators that prompted us to assess whether PARP10 influences mitochondrial oxidative metabolism. The depletion of PARP10 by specific shRNAs increased mitochondrial oxidative capacity in cellular models of breast, cervical, colorectal and exocrine pancreas cancer. Upon silencing of PARP10, mitochondrial superoxide production decreased in line with increased expression of antioxidant genes pointing out lower oxidative stress upon PARP10 silencing. Improved mitochondrial oxidative capacity coincided with increased AMPK activation. The silencing of PARP10 in MCF7 and CaCo2 cells decreased the proliferation rate that correlated with increased expression of anti-Warburg enzymes (Foxo1, PGC-1α, IDH2 and fumarase). By analyzing an online database we showed that lower PARP10 expression increases survival in gastric cancer. Furthermore, PARP10 expression decreased upon fasting, a condition that is characterized by increases in mitochondrial biogenesis. Finally, lower PARP10 expression is associated with increased fatty acid oxidation."
https://openalex.org/W2777419374,"Background Goal-directed reaching for real-world objects by humans is enabled through visual depth cues. In virtual environments, the number and quality of available visual depth cues is limited, which may affect reaching performance and quality of reaching movements. Methods We assessed three-dimensional reaching movements in five experimental groups each with ten healthy volunteers. Three groups used a two-dimensional computer screen and two groups used a head-mounted display. The first screen group received the typically recreated visual depth cues, such as aerial and linear perspective, occlusion, shadows, and texture gradients. The second screen group received an abstract minimal rendering lacking those. The third screen group received the cues of the first screen group and absolute depth cues enabled by retinal image size of a known object, which realized with visual renderings of the handheld device and a ghost handheld at the target location. The two head-mounted display groups received the same virtually recreated visual depth cues as the second or the third screen group respectively. Additionally, they could rely on stereopsis and motion parallax due to head-movements. Results and conclusion All groups using the screen performed significantly worse than both groups using the head-mounted display in terms of completion time normalized by the straight-line distance to the target. Both groups using the head-mounted display achieved the optimal minimum in number of speed peaks and in hand path ratio, indicating that our subjects performed natural movements when using a head-mounted display. Virtually recreated visual depth cues had a minor impact on reaching performance. Only the screen group with rendered handhelds could outperform the other screen groups. Thus, if reaching performance in virtual environments is in the main scope of a study, we suggest applying a head-mounted display. Otherwise, when two-dimensional screens are used, achievable performance is likely limited by the reduced depth perception and not just by subjects’ motor skills."
https://openalex.org/W2781792177,"This study aimed to assess and validate the repeatability and agreement of quantitative elastography of novel shear wave methods on four individual tissue-mimicking liver fibrosis phantoms with different known Young’s modulus. We used GE Logiq E9 2D-SWE, Philips iU22 ARFI (pSWE), Samsung TS80A SWE (pSWE), Hitachi Ascendus (SWM) and Transient Elastography (TE). Two individual investigators performed all measurements non-continued and in parallel. The methods were evaluated for inter- and intraobserver variability by intraclass correlation, coefficient of variation and limits of agreement using the median elastography value. All systems used in this study provided high repeatability in quantitative measurements in a liver fibrosis phantom and excellent inter- and intraclass correlations. All four elastography platforms showed excellent intra-and interobserver agreement (interclass correlation 0.981–1.000 and intraclass correlation 0.987–1.000) and no significant difference in mean elasticity measurements for all systems, except for TE on phantom 4. All four liver fibrosis phantoms could be differentiated by quantitative elastography, by all platforms (p<0.001). In the Bland-Altman analysis the differences in measurements were larger for the phantoms with higher Young’s modulus. All platforms had a coefficient of variation in the range 0.00–0.21 for all four phantoms, equivalent to low variance and high repeatability."
https://openalex.org/W2782524496,"Reward prediction errors (RPEs) are thought to drive learning. This has been established in procedural learning (e.g., classical and operant conditioning). However, empirical evidence on whether RPEs drive declarative learning–a quintessentially human form of learning–remains surprisingly absent. We therefore coupled RPEs to the acquisition of Dutch-Swahili word pairs in a declarative learning paradigm. Signed RPEs (SRPEs; “better-than-expected” signals) during declarative learning improved recognition in a follow-up test, with increasingly positive RPEs leading to better recognition. In addition, classic declarative memory mechanisms such as time-on-task failed to explain recognition performance. The beneficial effect of SRPEs on recognition was subsequently affirmed in a replication study with visual stimuli."
https://openalex.org/W2781656968,"FRET biosensors have proven very useful tools for studying the activation of specific signalling pathways in living cells. Most biosensors designed to date have been predicated on fluorescent protein pairs that were identified by, and for use in, intensity based measurements, however fluorescence lifetime provides a more reliable measurement of FRET. Both the technology and fluorescent proteins available for FRET have moved on dramatically in the last decade. Lifetime imaging systems have become increasingly accessible and user-friendly, and there is an entire field of biology dedicated to refining and adapting different characteristics of existing and novel fluorescent proteins. This growing pool of fluorescent proteins includes the long-lifetime green and cyan fluorescent proteins Clover and mTurquoise2, the red variant mRuby2, and the dark acceptor sREACh. Here, we have tested these donors and acceptors in appropriate combinations against the standard or recommended norms (EGFP and mTFP as donors, mCherry and either Ypet or Venus as acceptors) to determine if they could provide more reliable, reproducible and quantifiable FLIM-FRET data to improve on the dynamic range compared to other donors and breadth of application of biosensor technologies. These tests were performed for comparison on both a wide-field, frequency domain system and a multiphoton, TCSPC time domain FLIM system. Clover proved to be an excellent donor with extended dynamic range in combination with mCherry on both platforms, while mRuby2 showed a high degree of variability and poor FRET efficiencies in all cases. mTFP-Venus was the most consistent cyan-yellow pair between the two FLIM methodologies, but mTurquoise2 has better dynamic range and transfers energy consistently over time to the dark acceptor sRCh. Combination of mTFP-sRCh with Clover-mCherry would allow the simultaneous use of two FLIM-FRET biosensors within one sample by eliminating the crosstalk between the yellow acceptor and green donor emissions."
https://openalex.org/W2782041497,"Biotrickling filters (BTFs) are becoming very potential means to purify waste gases containing multiple VOC components, but the removal of the waste gases by BTF has been a major challenge due to the extremely complicated interactions among the components. Four biotrickling filters packed with polyurethane foam were employed to identify the interactions among four aromatic compounds (benzene, toluene, xylene and styrene). The elimination capacities obtained at 90% of removal efficiency for individual toluene, styrene and xylene were 297.02, 225.27 and 180.75 g/m3h, respectively. No obvious removal for benzene was observed at the inlet loading rates ranging from 20 to 450 g/m3h. The total elimination capacities for binary gases significantly decreased in all biotrickling filters. However, the removal of benzene was enhanced in the presence of other gases. The removal capacities of ternary and quaternary gases were further largely lowered. High-throughput sequencing results revealed that microbial communities changed greatly with the composition of gases, from which we found that: all samples were dominated either by the genus Achromobacter or the Burkholderia. Different gaseous combination enriched or inhibited some microbial species. Group I includes samples of BTFs treating single and binary gases and was dominated by the genus Achromobacter, with little Burkholderia inside. Group II includes the rest of the samples taken from BTFs domesticated with ternary and quaternary gases, and was dominated by the genus Burkholderia, with little Achromobacter detected. These genera were highly associated with the biodegradation of benzene series in BTFs."
https://openalex.org/W2781884874,"Cancer results from alterations at essential genomic sites and is characterized by uncontrolled cell proliferation, invasion and metastasis. Identification of driver genes of metastatic progression is essential, as metastases, not primary tumors, are fatal. To gain insight into the mutational concordance between different steps of malignant progression we performed exome sequencing and validation with targeted deep sequencing of successive steps of malignant progression from pre-invasive stages to asynchronous distant metastases in six breast cancer patients. Using the ratio of non-synonymous to synonymous mutations, a surprisingly large number of cancer driver genes, ranging between 3 and 145, were estimated to confer a selective advantage in the studied primary tumors. We report a substantial amount of metastasis specific mutations and a number of novel putative metastasis driver genes. Most notable are the DCC, ABCA13, TIAM2, CREBBP, BCL6B and ZNF185 genes, mainly mutated exclusively in metastases and highly likely driver genes of metastatic progression. We find different genes and pathways to be affected at different steps of malignant progression. The Adherens junction pathway is affected in four of the six studied patients and this pathway most likely plays a vital role in the metastatic process."
https://openalex.org/W2781770079,"We have identified a series of tetrahydrocarbazoles as novel P-type ATPase inhibitors. Using a set of rationally designed analogues, we have analyzed their structure-activity relationship using functional assays, crystallographic data and computational modeling. We found that tetrahydrocarbazoles inhibit adenosine triphosphate (ATP) hydrolysis of the fungal H+-ATPase, depolarize the fungal plasma membrane and exhibit broad-spectrum antifungal activity. Comparative inhibition studies indicate that many tetrahydrocarbazoles also inhibit the mammalian Ca2+-ATPase (SERCA) and Na+,K+-ATPase with an even higher potency than Pma1. We have located the binding site for this compound class by crystallographic structure determination of a SERCA-tetrahydrocarbazole complex to 3.0 Å resolution, finding that the compound binds to a region above the ion inlet channel of the ATPase. A homology model of the Candida albicans H+-ATPase based on this crystal structure, indicates that the compounds could bind to the same pocket and identifies pocket extensions that could be exploited for selectivity enhancement. The results of this study will aid further optimization towards selective H+-ATPase inhibitors as a new class of antifungal agents."
https://openalex.org/W2781888867,"Parasitic nematodes infect over one quarter of the population worldwide, causing morbidity in over one billion people. Current anthelmintic drugs are beginning to lose effectiveness due to the presence of resistant strains. We are interested in the role of neuropeptides, which regulate behaviors in all organisms, as another possible target for anthelmintic drugs. FMRFamide-related peptides (FaRPs) are a family of neuropeptides that are conserved throughout the animal kingdom. In particular, nematodes contain the largest family of FaRPs identified thus far and many of these FaRPs are identical among different nematode species; FaRPs in nematodes are collectively referred to as FLPs (FMRFamide-like peptides). However, little is known about the function of these FLPs. We are using the non-parasitic nematode Caenorhabditis elegans as a model for examining FLPs in nematodes. C. elegans contains at least 31 flp genes that encode 72 potential FLPs. Among the flp genes, flp-1 is one of the few that is universally found in nematodes. FLP-1 neuropeptides were previously reported to be involved in sensory and motor functions. However, previous alleles of flp-1 also disrupted a neighboring gene, daf-10. To understand the phenotypes of flp-1, new alleles that specifically disrupt flp-1 were characterized. The previously reported locomotory and egg-laying defects were found to be due to loss of flp-1, while the osmolarity defect is due to loss of daf-10. In addition, loss of flp-1 and daf-10 both cause several phenotypes that increase in severity in the double mutants by disrupting different neurons in the neural circuits."
https://openalex.org/W2781837621,"Background New Delhi Metallo-β-Lactamase (NDM-1) is one of the most recent additions to the β-lactamases family. Since its discovery in 2009, NDM-1 producing Enterobacteriaceae have disseminated globally. With few effective antibiotics against NDM-1 producers, there is an urgent need to design new drug inhibitors through the help of structural and mechanistic information available from mutagenic studies. Results/Conclusions In our study we focus the attention on the non-catalytic residue Leucine 209 by changing it into a Phenylalanine. The L209F laboratory variant of NDM-1 displays a drastic reduction of catalytic efficiency (due to low kcat values) towards penicillins, cephalosporins and carbapenems. Thermofluor-based assay demonstrated that NDM-1 and L209F are stable to the temperature and the zinc content is the same in both enzymes as demonstrated by experiments with PAR in the presence of GdnHCL. Molecular Dynamics (MDs) simulations, carried out on NDM-1 and L209F both complexed and uncomplexed with Benzylpenicillin indicate that the point mutation produces a significant mechanical destabilization of the enzyme and also an increase of water content. These observations clearly show that the single mutation induces drastic changes in the enzyme properties which can be related to the observed different catalytic behavior."
https://openalex.org/W2781499465,"Background Ascites syndrome is the most severe manifestation of pulmonary hypertension in fast-growing broilers. The disease can be attributed to increased body weights of birds, where the higher metabolic load is not matched by sufficient oxygen supply to the cells and tissues. Although there are environmental components, the disease exhibits moderate to high heritability. The current study uses high throughput whole genome resequencing (WGR) to identify genes and chromosomal regions associated with ascites. Results The WGR data identified the CPQ gene on chromosome 2. The association was confirmed by genotyping a large collection of DNAs from phenotyped birds from three distinct broiler lines using SNPs in intron 6 and exon 8 of the CPQ gene. By combining the genotype data for these two SNP loci, we identified three different alleles segregating in the three broiler lines. Particular genotypes could be associated with resistance to ascites. We further determined that particular genotypes most associated with resistance overexpress CPQ mRNA in three tissues which might explain the role of these alleles in contributing to resistance. Conclusions Our findings indicate CPQ is an important determinant of pulmonary hypertension syndrome leading to ascites in broilers. We identified particular SNPs that can be used for marker-assisted selection of broilers for resistance to the disease. Our findings validate WGR as a highly efficient approach to map determinants contributing to complex phenotypic or disease-related traits. The CPQ gene has been associated with pulmonary hypertension in genome-wide association studies in humans. Therefore, ascites investigations in broilers are likely to provide insights into some forms of hypertension in humans."
https://openalex.org/W2781783099,"Five full-scale wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) in China using typical biodegradation processes (SBR, oxidation ditch, A2/O) were selected to assess the removal of four popular artificial sweeteners (ASs). All four ASs (acesulfame (ACE), sucralose (SUC), cyclamate (CYC) and saccharin (SAC)) were detected, ranging from 0.43 to 27.34μg/L in the influent. Higher concentrations of ASs were measured in winter. ACE could be partly removed by 7.11–50.76% through biodegradation and especially through the denitrifying process. The A2/O process was the most efficient at biodegrading ASs. Adsorption (by granular activated carbon (GAC) and magnetic resin) and ultraviolet radiation-based advanced oxidation processes (UV/AOPs) were evaluated to remove ASs in laboratory-scale tests. The amounts of resin adsorbed were 3.33–18.51 times more than those of GAC except for SUC. The adsorption ability of resin decreased in the order of SAC > ACE > CYC > SUC in accordance with the pKa. Degradation of ASs followed pseudo-first-order kinetics in UV/H2O2 and UV/PDS. When applied to the secondary effluent, ASs could be degraded from 30.87 to 99.93% using UV/PDS in 30 minutes and UV/PDS was more efficient and economic."
https://openalex.org/W2782199253,"The objective of this study was to investigate the safety and the tolerability of combined cellular immunotherapy with low-dose cyclophosphamide (CPA) in patients with advanced solid tumors. This study targeted a novel tumor-associated antigen, ring finger protein 43 (RNF43). Eligible patients were resistant to standard therapy, HLA-A*24:02- or A*02:01-positive and exhibiting high RNF43 expression in their tumor cells. They were administered 300 mg/m2 CPA followed by autologous lymphocytes, preliminarily cultured with autologous RNF43 peptide-pulsed dendritic cells (DCs), RNF43 peptide-pulsed DCs and systemic low dose interleukin-2. The primary endpoint was safety whereas the secondary endpoint was immunological and clinical response to treatment. Ten patients, in total, were enrolled in this trial. Primarily, no adverse events greater than Grade 3 were observed. Six out of 10 patients showed stable disease (SD) on day 49, while 4 other patients showed progressive disease. In addition, one patient with SD exhibited a partial response after the second trial. The frequency of regulatory T cells (Tregs) in patients with SD significantly decreased after CPA administration. The ratio of interferon-γ-producing, tumor-reactive CD8+ T cells increased with time in patients with SD. We successfully showed that the combination of immune cell therapy and CPA was safe, might induce tumor-specific immune responses and clinical efficacy, and was accompanied by a decreased ratio of Tregs in patients with RNF43-positive advanced solid tumors."
https://openalex.org/W2781902122,"Tuberculosis (TB) in the elderly remains a challenge in intermediate disease burden areas like Hong Kong. Given a higher TB burden in the elderly and limited impact of current case-finding strategy by patient-initiated pathway, proactive screening approaches for the high-risk group could be optimal and increasingly need targeted economic evaluations. In this study, we examined whether and under what circumstance the screening strategies are cost-effective compared with no screening strategy for the elderly at admission to residential care homes.A decision analytic process based on Markov model was adopted to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of four strategies: (i) no screening, (ii) TB screening (CXR) and (iii) TB screening (Xpert) represent screening for TB in symptomatic elderly by chest X-ray and Xpert® MTB/RIF respectively, and (iv) LTBI/TB screening represents screening for latent and active TB infection by QuantiFERON®-TB Gold In-Tube and chest X-ray. The target population was a hypothetical cohort of 65-year-old people, using a health service provider perspective and a time horizon of 20 years. The outcomes were direct medical costs, life-years and quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) measured by incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER).In the base-case analysis, no screening was the most cost-saving; TB screening (CXR) was dominated by TB screening (Xpert); LTBI/TB screening resulted in more life-years and QALYs accrued. The ICERs of LTBI/TB screening were US$19,712 and US$29,951 per QALY gained compared with no screening and TB screening (Xpert), respectively. At the willingness-to-pay threshold of US$50,000 per QALY gained, LTBI/TB screening was the most cost-effective when the probability of annual LTBI reactivation was greater than 0.155% and acceptability of LTBI/TB screening was greater than 38%. In 1,000 iterations of Monte Carlo simulation, the probabilities of no screening, TB screening (CXR), TB screening (Xpert), and LTBI/TB screening to be cost-effective were 0, 1.3%, 20.1%, and 78.6% respectively.Screening for latent and active TB infection in Hong Kong elderly people at admission to residential care homes appears to be highly effective and cost-effective. The key findings may be the next key factor to bring down TB endemic in the elderly population among intermediate TB burden areas."

The results showed that diffusion polarization exist in the positive and negative electrodes, and diffusion polarization increase with the conducting of the discharge process.

https://openalex.org/W2782393269,"Toxoflavin, a 7-azapteridine phytotoxin produced by the bacterial pathogens such as Burkholderia glumae and Burkholderia gladioli, has been known as one of the key virulence factors in crop diseases. Because the toxoflavin had an antibacterial activity, a metagenomic E. coli clone capable of growing well in the presence of toxoflavin (30 μg/ml) was isolated and the first metagenome-derived toxoflavin-degrading enzyme, TxeA of 140 amino acid residues, was identified from the positive E. coli clone. The conserved amino acids for metal-binding and extradiol dioxygenase activity, Glu-12, His-8 and Glu-130, were revealed by the sequence analysis of TxeA. The optimum conditions for toxoflavin degradation were evaluated with the TxeA purified in E. coli. Toxoflavin was totally degraded at an initial toxoflavin concentration of 100 μg/ml and at pH 5.0 in the presence of Mn2+, dithiothreitol and oxygen. The final degradation products of toxoflavin and methyltoxoflavin were fully identified by MS and NMR as triazines. Therefore, we suggested that the new metagenomic enzyme, TxeA, provided the clue to applying the new metagenomic enzyme to resistance development of crop plants to toxoflavin-mediated disease as well as to biocatalysis for Baeyer-Villiger type oxidation."
https://openalex.org/W2782217416,"Phenotypic responses to rising CO2 will have consequences for the productivity and management of the world's forests. This has been demonstrated through extensive free air and controlled environment CO2 enrichment studies. However intraspecific variation in plasticity remains poorly characterised in trees, with the capacity to produce unexpected trends in response to CO2 across a species distribution. Here we examined variation in photosynthesis traits across 43 provenances of a widespread, genetically diverse eucalypt, E. camaldulensis, under ambient and elevated CO2 conditions. Genetic variation suggestive of local adaptation was identified for some traits under ambient conditions. Evidence of genotype by CO2 interaction in responsiveness was limited, however support was identified for quantum yield (φ). In this case local adaptation was invoked to explain trends in provenance variation in response. The results suggest potential for genetic variation to influence a limited set of photosynthetic responses to rising CO2 in seedlings of E. camaldulensis, however further assessment in mature stage plants in linkage with growth and fitness traits is needed to understand whether trends in φ could have broader implications for productivity of red gum forests."

https://openalex.org/W2781680167,"Introduction Transradial coronary angiography (TRC) can be performed with a one-catheter approach for the right and left coronary ostium (R/LCO). We investigated the performance of a special diagnostic catheter widely used for the one-catheter-approach, the Tiger (Tiger II, TerumoTM). Methods In a dual center registry we analyzed 1412 TRC-procedures exclusively performed by experienced TRC-operators. We compared the performance of the Tiger with Judkins catheters by retrospectively judging ostial catheter stability during contrast injection, and by measuring contrast use, fluoroscopy time (FT) and complication rate. Results Poor or failed ostial engagement was found in 40.5% in the Tiger group, compared to 46.6% with the use of Judkins catheters (p<0.183). Ostial instability of the Tiger was found more often during engagement of the LCO than the RCO (34.4% vs. 10.8%, p<0.001), whereas it was similar in the LCO and RCO for Judkins catheters (27.4% vs. 26.7%, p = 0.840). TRC-procedures performed with Tiger catheters were associated with less contrast volume (63.48 ± 29.83mL vs. 82.51 ± 56.58mL, p<0.004) and shorter FT than with Judkins catheters. (198.27 ± 194.8sec vs. 326.85 ± 329.70sec). Forearm hematomas occurred less often with the Tiger (1.2% vs. 6.6%, p< 0.02). Conclusion The Tiger employed as a single catheter in TRC is an effective tool to achieve lower contrast volume and fluoroscopy time at a low complication rate. Unstable engagement affects predominantly the left coronary artery, but its overall frequency is similar for both, the Tiger and Judkins catheters."
https://openalex.org/W2781882039,"Although condensed tannins (CTs) are known to reduce forage intake by mammalian herbivores in controlled experiments, few studies have tested these effects in the field. Thus the role of CTs on foraging ecology of free-ranging herbivores is inadequately understood. To investigate the effects of CTs under natural savanna conditions, we pre-dosed groups of goats with polyethylene glycol (PEG, a CT-neutralising chemical), CT powder or water before observing their foraging behaviour. While accounting for the effects of season and time of the day, we tested the hypothesis that herbivores forage in ways that reduce the intake rate (g DM per minute) of CTs. We expected pre-dosing goats with CTs to reduce CT intake rates by (1) consuming diets low in CTs, (2) reducing bite rates, (3) increasing the number of foraging bouts, or (4) reducing the length of foraging bouts. Lastly, (5) expected CT to have no influence the number of dietary forage species. In both wet and dry seasons, pre-dosing goats with CTs resulted in lower CT consumption rates compared to PEG goats which seemed relieved from the stress associated with CT consumption. During dry season, the number of dietary forage species was similar across treatments, although goats that were dosed with PEG significantly increased this number in the wet season. Dosing goats with PEG increased the number and length of browsing bouts compared to goats from the other treatments. Pre-loading goats with PEG also tended to increase bite rates on browse forages, which contributed to increased consumption rates of CTs. Based on the behavioural adjustments made by goats in this study and within the constraints imposed by chemical complexity in savanna systems, we concluded that herbivores under natural conditions foraged in ways that minimised CTs consumption. More research should further elucidate the mechanism through which CTs regulated feeding behaviour."
https://openalex.org/W2782042989,"Radical S-adenosylmethionine (rSAM) enzymes use a 5’-deoxyadensyl 5’-radical to methylate a wide array of diverse substrates including proteins, lipids and nucleic acids. One such enzyme, Elongator protein-3 (TgElp3), is an essential protein in Toxoplasma gondii, a protozoan parasite that can cause life-threatening opportunistic disease. Unlike Elp3 homologues which are present in all domains of life, TgElp3 localizes to the outer mitochondrial membrane (OMM) via a tail-anchored trafficking mechanism in Toxoplasma. Intriguingly, we identified a second tail-anchored rSAM domain containing protein (TgRlmN) that also localizes to the OMM. The transmembrane domain (TMD) on Toxoplasma Elp3 and RlmN homologues is required for OMM localization and has not been seen beyond the chromalveolates. Both TgElp3 and TgRlmN contain the canonical rSAM amino acid sequence motif (CxxxCxxC) necessary to form the 4Fe-4S cluster required for tRNA modifications. In E. coli, RlmN is responsible for the 2-methlyadenosine (m2A) synthesis at purine 37 in tRNA while in S. cerevisiae, Elp3 is necessary for the formation of 5-methoxycarbonylmethyl-2-thiouridine (mcm5s2U) at the wobble tRNA position. To investigate why these two rSAM enzymes localize to the mitochondrion in Toxoplasma, and whether or not TgRlmN and TgElp3 possess tRNA methyltransferase activity, a series of mutational and biochemical studies were performed. Overexpression of either TgElp3 or TgRlmN resulted in a significant parasite replication defect, but overexpression was tolerated if either the TMD or rSAM domain was mutated. Furthermore, we show the first evidence that Toxoplasma tRNAGlu contains the mcm5s2U modification, which is the putative downstream product generated by TgElp3 activity."
https://openalex.org/W2782141661,"The role of intra-host genetic diversity in dengue viral populations remains a topic of debate, particularly the impact on transmission of changes in this diversity. Several approaches have been taken to increasing and decreasing the genetic diversity of populations of RNA viruses and have drawn what appear to be contradictory conclusions. A 2–6 fold increase in genetic diversity of a wild type population of dengue virus serotype 1(DENV1) and of an infectious clone population derived from the wild type population, produced by treatment with nucleotide analogue 5 fluorouracil (5FU), drove the populations to extinction. Removal of 5FU immediately prior to extinction, resulted in a return to pre-treatment levels of fitness and genetic diversity, albeit with novel single nucleotide polymorphisms. These observations support the concept that DENV populations exist on fitness peaks determined by their transmission requirements and either an increase or a decrease in genetic diversity may result in a loss of fitness."
https://openalex.org/W2782254000,"The theory of island biogeography predicts the effects of habitat isolation and size on species richness, community assembly, and the persistence of species. Various studies showed that habitat conditions and the ecology of species are also of relevance in explaining community assembly. Geographically isolated habitats like caves with rather constant environmental conditions provide models to test for the relevance of the above described variables. In this study we analysed springtails living in karst caves of the Romanian Carpathians and Dobrogea region. We considered phylogenetic relatedness, habitat and species characteristics to identify the relevant drivers of community assembly. Our data show that species richness of single caves is low. Neither phylogenetic relatedness nor habitat filtering and competitive interactions seem to shape species composition or to affect species richness. We found that glacial-interglacial cycles with subsequent range contractions and expansions might have led to independent and multiple colonisations of caves. Furthermore, single caves might have acted as refugia and thus might have provided the prerequisite for distinct evolution processes, leading to a high level of endemicity of these animal species."
https://openalex.org/W2781921611,"Glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) stimulated insulin secretion has a considerable heritable component as estimated from twin studies, yet few genetic variants influencing this phenotype have been identified. We performed the first genome-wide association study (GWAS) of GLP-1 stimulated insulin secretion in non-diabetic individuals from the Netherlands Twin register (n = 126). This GWAS was enhanced using a tissue-specific protein-protein interaction network approach. We identified a beta-cell protein-protein interaction module that was significantly enriched for low gene scores based on the GWAS P-values and found support at the network level in an independent cohort from Tübingen, Germany (n = 100). Additionally, a polygenic risk score based on SNPs prioritized from the network was associated (P < 0.05) with glucose-stimulated insulin secretion phenotypes in up to 5,318 individuals in MAGIC cohorts. The network contains both known and novel genes in the context of insulin secretion and is enriched for members of the focal adhesion, extracellular-matrix receptor interaction, actin cytoskeleton regulation, Rap1 and PI3K-Akt signaling pathways. Adipose tissue is, like the beta-cell, one of the target tissues of GLP-1 and we thus hypothesized that similar networks might be functional in both tissues. In order to verify peripheral effects of GLP-1 stimulation, we compared the transcriptome profiling of ob/ob mice treated with liraglutide, a clinically used GLP-1 receptor agonist, versus baseline controls. Some of the upstream regulators of differentially expressed genes in the white adipose tissue of ob/ob mice were also detected in the human beta-cell network of genes associated with GLP-1 stimulated insulin secretion. The findings provide biological insight into the mechanisms through which the effects of GLP-1 may be modulated and highlight a potential role of the beta-cell expressed genes RYR2, GDI2, KIAA0232, COL4A1 and COL4A2 in GLP-1 stimulated insulin secretion."
https://openalex.org/W2782463413,"Influenza and asthma are two of the major public health concerns in the world today. During the 2009 influenza pandemic asthma was found to be the commonest comorbid illness of patients admitted to hospital. Unexpectedly, it was also observed that asthmatic patients admitted to hospital with influenza infection were less likely to die or require admission to intensive care compared with non-asthmatics. Using an in vivo model of asthma and influenza infection we demonstrate that prior exposure to Blomia tropicalis extract (BTE) leads to an altered immune response to influenza infection, comprised of less severe weight loss and faster recovery following infection. This protection was associated with significant increases in T cell numbers in the lungs of BTE sensitised and infected mice, as well as increased IFN-γ production from these cells. In addition, elevated numbers of CD11b+ dendritic cells (DCs) were found in the lung draining lymph nodes following infection of BTE sensitised mice compared to infected PBS treated mice. These CD11b+ DCs appeared to be better at priming CD8 specific T cells both in vivo and ex vivo, a function not normally attributed to CD11b+ DCs. We propose that this alteration in cross-presentation and more efficient T cell priming seen in BTE sensitised mice, led to the earlier increase in T cells in the lungs and subsequently faster clearance of the virus and reduced influenza induced pathology. We believe this data provides a novel mechanism that explains why asthmatic patients may present with less severe disease when infected with influenza."
https://openalex.org/W2781969425,"It is well known that the active set algorithm is very effective for smooth box constrained optimization. Many achievements have been obtained in this field. We extend the active set method to nonsmooth box constrained optimization problems, using the Moreau-Yosida regularization technique to make the objective function smooth. A limited memory BFGS method is introduced to decrease the workload of the computer. The presented algorithm has these properties: (1) all iterates are feasible and the sequence of objective functions is decreasing; (2) rapid changes in the active set are allowed; (3) the subproblem is a lower dimensional system of linear equations. The global convergence of the new method is established under suitable conditions and numerical results show that the method is effective for large-scale nonsmooth problems (5,000 variables)."
https://openalex.org/W2781993689,"Clostridium taeniosporum, a non-pathogenic anaerobe closely related to the C. botulinum Group II members, was isolated from Crimean lake silt about 60 years ago. Its endospores are surrounded by an encasement layer which forms a trunk at one spore pole to which about 12–14 large, ribbon-like appendages are attached. The genome consists of one 3,264,813 bp, circular chromosome (with 26.6% GC) and three plasmids. The chromosome contains 2,892 potential protein coding sequences: 2,124 have specific functions, 147 have general functions, 228 are conserved but without known function and 393 are hypothetical based on the fact that no statistically significant orthologs were found. The chromosome also contains 101 genes for stable RNAs, including 7 rRNA clusters. Over 84% of the protein coding sequences and 96% of the stable RNA coding regions are oriented in the same direction as replication. The three known appendage genes are located within a single cluster with five other genes, the protein products of which are closely related, in terms of sequence, to the known appendage proteins. The relatedness of the deduced protein products suggests that all or some of the closely related genes might code for minor appendage proteins or assembly factors. The appendage genes might be unique among the known clostridia; no statistically significant orthologs were found within other clostridial genomes for which sequence data are available. The C. taeniosporum chromosome contains two functional prophages, one Siphoviridae and one Myoviridae, and one defective prophage. Three plasmids of 5.9, 69.7 and 163.1 Kbp are present. These data are expected to contribute to future studies of developmental, structural and evolutionary biology and to potential industrial applications of this organism."
https://openalex.org/W2782241013,"Cytological diploidization process is different in autopolyploid and allopolyploid species. Colchicine applied at the onset of meiosis suppresses the effect of pairing regulator genes resulting multivalents formation in bivalent-forming species. Colchicine treated maizes (4x = 2n = 20, AmAmBmBm) showed up to 5IV, suggesting pairing between chromosomes from genomes homoeologous Am and Bm. In untreated individuals of the alloautooctoploid Zea perennis (8x = 2n = 40, ApApAp´Ap´Bp1Bp1Bp2Bp2) the most frequent configuration was 5IV+10II (formed by A and B genomes, respectively). The colchicine treated Z. perennis show up to 10IV revealing higher affinity within genomes A and B, but any homology among them. These results suggest the presence of a paring regulator locus (PrZ) in maize and Z. perennis, whose expression is suppressed by colchicine. It could be postulated that in Z. perennis, PrZ would affect independently the genomes A and B, being relevant the threshold of homology, the fidelity of pairing in each genomes and the ploidy level. Cytological analysis of the treated hexaploid hybrids (6x = 2n = 30), with Z. perennis as a parental, strongly suggests that PrZ is less effective in only one doses. This conclusion was reinforced by the homoeologous pairing observed in untreated dihaploid maizes, which showed up to 5II. Meiotic behaviour of individuals treated with different doses of colchicine allowed to postulate that PrZ affect the homoeologous association by controlling entire genomes (Am or Bm) rather than individual chromosomes. Based on cytological and statistical results it is possible to propose that the cytological diploidization in Zea species occurs by restriction of pairing between homoeologous chromosomes or by genetical divergence of the homoeologous chromosomes, as was observed in untreated Z. mays ssp. parviglumis. These are independent but complementary systems and could be acting jointly in the same nucleus."
