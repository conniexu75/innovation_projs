https://openalex.org/W1970000184,The strontium content of bone is a function of the strontium content of the ingested food. Under favorable conditions of fossilization it can be used for the determination of feeding habits of extinct terrestrial vertebrates. Homogeneous samples of fossil biotic communities are a prerequisite for significant results.
https://openalex.org/W2026349813,Experiments on several species of moths and cockroaches indicate that the production of sex pheromone (a male attractant) in virgin females is under endocrine control in some species but not in others. The presence or absence of endocrine control over pheromone production may be correlated with the type of life cycle exhibited.
https://openalex.org/W2082017373,"Midsummer productivity of Antarctic microalgae, commonly occurring in brown sea ice along the west coast of the Palmer Peninsula, averaged more than 900 milligrams of carbon per cubic meter per hour, with an assimilation number of about 2.6. The rate of photosynthesis increased with light intensity to a maximum of about 18,000 lux, above which some inhibition was observed. The floral composition, genesis, and physiological properties of these ice communities are different from the epontic under-ice diatoms previously studied by other investigators in McMurdo Sound."

Thus, it showed much greater teratogenicity than other glucocorticoids tested on mice. Widely ranging doses of desoxycorticosterone did not produce cleft palates."
https://openalex.org/W2060039499,"The average rate of downslope movement of rock fragments on shale hillslopes is directly proportional to the sine of the slope angle or that component of the gravitational force which acts parallel to the hillslope. The rates of surficial rock creep range from a few millimeters per year on a 3degree slope to almost 70 millimeters per year on a 40-degree slope, but these rates vary with natural variations in soil characteristics and microclimate, as well as with accidental disturbances."

https://openalex.org/W2075241146,"Because of the high temperatures prevailing in the lower atmosphere of Venus, its chemistry is dominated by the tendency toward thermodynamic equilibrium. From the atomic composition deduced spectroscopically, the thermodynamic equilibrium composition of the atmosphere of Venus is computed, and the following conclusions drawn. (i) There can be no free carbon, hydrocarbons, formaldehyde, or any other organic molecule present in more than trace amounts. (ii) The original atomic composition of the atmosphere must have included much larger quantities of hydrogen and a carbon/oxygen ratio </= 0.5. (This ratio is now almost precisely 0.5.) (iii) The present atomic proportions of the atmosphere of Venus are so unique that an evolutionary mechanism involving two independent processes seems necessary, as follows. Water, originally present in large quantities, has been photodissociated in the upper atmosphere, and the resulting atomic hydrogen has been lost in space. The resulting excess oxygen has been very effectively bound to the surface materials. (iv) There must be some weathering process, for example, violent wind erosion, to disturb and expose a sufficient quantity of reduced surface material to react with the oxygen produced by photodissociation."

https://openalex.org/W2084103532,"The occurrence of glass as a major constituent in a chondrule from the Chainpur meteorite provides evidence that the chondrules formed by rapid cooling of liquid droplets. The virtual absence of nickel in the silicates suggests that it segregated into the metal phase in the molten stage, prior to crystallization of the silicates."
https://openalex.org/W2034614198,"The Lunar Receiving Laboratory will be the permanent depository of a portion of the collection of lunar samples; it will safeguard the collection, providing continuing security and ensuring scientific integrity. In carrying out the time-dependent experiments and continuing functions of the laboratory, NASA will rely on visiting expert scientists supplementing a relatively small resident staff; outside scientists will be relied upon for most investigations and detailed analyses of samples. It is believed that the designed procedures and facilities provided will ensure the maximum scientific return from the Apollo Program in the way of information from lunar samples."

https://openalex.org/W1972040174,"A radiocarbon age of 8680 +/- 140 years found for fossil marine shells in the Lake St. John area, Quebec, shows that marine submergence there apparently preceded the ""Tyrrell Sea"" in southeastern Hudson Bay, but followed the Champlain Sea episode in the St. Lawrence Lowlands."

https://openalex.org/W2041826240,"Excavations at site U.C.L.J.-M-15 at Agua Hedionda Lagoon in southern California have provided a radiocarbon date of 7070 B.C. for a transitional phase between the San Dieguito and the La Jolla complex. The many radiocarbon dates taken from sites in San Diego County demonstrate a somewhat greater age than was hitherto generally expected for the three cultures in the area. The age of the most recent culture, the Yuman-Diegueno, has been extended to about 1000 B.C. The La Jolla shows an extremely long period of occupation spanning roughly 1000 B.C. to 7070 B.C. The third group, the San Dieguito, a pre-Desert culture, is still undated. Samples are now in process and should, judged from the new La Jolla dates, give a date earlier than 7000 B.C. for the earliest phases of the San Dieguito."
