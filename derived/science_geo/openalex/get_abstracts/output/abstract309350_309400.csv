https://openalex.org/W2083196847,"At least four active geyser-like eruptions were discovered in Voyager 2 images of Triton, Neptune's large satellite. The two best documented eruptions occur as columns of dark material rising to an altitude of about 8 kilometers where dark clouds of material are left suspended to drift downwind over 100 kilometers. The radii of the rising columns appear to be in the range of several tens of meters to a kilometer. One model for the mechanism to drive the plumes involves heating of nitrogen ice in a subsurface greenhouse environment; nitrogen gas pressurized by the solar heating explosively vents to the surface carrying clouds of ice and dark partides into the atmosphere. A temperature increase of less than 4 kelvins above the ambient surface value of 38 +/- 3 kelvins is more than adequate to drive the plumes to an 8-kilometer altitude. The mass flux in the trailing clouds is estimated to consist of up to 10 kilograms of fine dark particles per second or twice as much nitrogen ice and perhaps several hundred or more kilograms of nitrogen gas per second. Each eruption may last a year or more, during which on the order of a tenth of a cubic kilometer of ice is sublimed."

https://openalex.org/W2043455641,"Nitrogen and methane ices on the surface of Triton, Neptune's largest satellite, are exchanged between the summer and winter hemispheres on a seasonal time scale. Images of the satellite's sky obtained by the Voyager 2 spacecraft show the presence of several types of scattering materials that provide insights into this seasonal cycle of volatiles. Discrete clouds, probably composed of N2 ice particles, arise in regions of active sublimation. They are found chiefly poleward of 30Â°S in the southern, summer hemisphere. Haze particles, probably made of hydrocarbon ices, are present above most, but not all places. Recent snowfall may have occurred at low southern latitudes in places where they are absent. The latent heat released in the formation of the discrete clouds may have a major impact on the thermal balance of the lower atmosphere. Triton may have been less red at the time of the Voyager flyby than 12 years earlier due to recent N2 snowfall at a wide range of latitudes."
https://openalex.org/W2037052927,"Four geyser-like plumes were discovered near Triton's south pole in areas now in permanent sunlight. Because Triton's southern hemisphere is nearing a maximum summer solstice, insolation as a driver or a trigger for Triton's geyser-like plumes is an attractive hypothesis. Trapping of solar radiation in a translucent, low-conductivity surface layer (in a solid-state greenhouse), which is subsequently released in the form of latent heat of sublimation, could provide the required energy. Both the classical solid-state greenhouse consisting of exponentially absorbed insolation in a gray, translucent layer of solid nitrogen, and the ""super"" greenhouse consisting of a relatively transparent solid-nitrogen layer over an opaque, absorbing layer are plausible candidates. Geothermal heat may also play a part if assisted by the added energy input of seasonal cycles of insolation."
https://openalex.org/W1976520107,"The location of active geyser-like eruptions and related features close to the current subsolar latitude on Triton suggests a solar energy source for these phenomena. Solidstate greenhouse calculations have shown that sunlight can generate substantially elevated subsurface temperatures. A variety of models for the storage of solar energy in a sub-greenhouse layer and for the supply of gas and energy to a geyser are examined. ""Leaky greenhouse"" models with only vertical gas transport are inconsistent with the observed upper limit on geyser radius of approximately 1.5 kilometers. However, lateral transport of energy by gas flow in a porous N(2) layer with a block size on the order of a meter can supply the required amount of gas to a source region approximately 1 kilometer in radius. The decline of gas output to steady state may occur over a period comparable with the inferred active geyser lifetime of five Earth years. The required subsurface permeability may be maintained by thermal fracturing of the residual N2 polar cap. A lower limit on geyser source radius of approximately 50 to 100 meters predicted by a theory of negatively buoyant jets is not readily attained."
https://openalex.org/W2068696820,"Hapke's photometric model has been combined with a plane-parallel thin atmospheric haze model to describe Voyager whole-disk observations of Triton, in the violet (0.41 microm), blue (0.48 microm), and green (0.56 microm) wavelength bands, in order to obtain estimates of Triton's geometric albedo, phase integral, and Bond albedo. Phase angle coverage in these filters ranging from approximately 12 degrees to 159 degrees was obtained by combining narrow- and wide-angle camera images. An upturn in the data at the highest phase angles observed can be explained by including scattering in a thin atmospheric haze layer with optical depths systematically decreasing with wavelength from approximately 0.06 in the violet to 0.03 for the green filter data. The geometric albedo, phase integral, and spherical albedo of Triton in each filter corresponding to our best fit Hapke parameters yield an estimated Bond albedo of 0.82 +/- 0.05. If the 14-microbar N(2) atmosphere detected by Voyager is in vapor equilibrium with the surface (therefore implying a surface temperature of 37.5 K), our Bond albedo implies a surface emissivity of 0.59 +/- 0.16."
https://openalex.org/W2081452025,"Aeolian features on Triton that were imaged during the Voyager Mission have been grouped. The term ""aeolian feature"" is broadly defined as features produced by or blown by the wind, including surface and airborne materials. Observations of the latitudinal distributions of the features probably associated with current activity (known plumes, crescent streaks, fixed terminator clouds, and limb haze with overshoot) all occur from latitude -37 degrees to latitude -62 degrees . Likely indicators of previous activity (dark surface streaks) occur from latitude -5 degrees to -70 degrees , but are most abundant from -15 degrees to -45 degrees , generally north of currently active features. Those indicators which give information on wind direction and speed have been measured. Wind direction is a function of altitude. The predominant direction of the surface wind streaks is found to be between 40 degrees and 80 degrees measured clockwise from north. The average orientation of streaks in the northeast quadrant is 59 degrees . Winds at 1- to 3- kilometer altitude are eastward, while those at &8 kilometers blow west."
https://openalex.org/W2059983692,"Impact craters on Triton are scarce owing to the relatively recent resurfacing by icy melts. The most heavily cratered surface has a crater density about the same as the lunar maria. The transition diameter from simple to complex craters occurs at a diameter of about 11 kilometers, and the depth-diameter relationship is similar to that of other icy satellites when gravity is taken into account. The crater size-frequency distribution has a differential -3 slope (cumulative -2 slope) and is the same as that for the fresh crater population on Miranda. The most heavily cratered region is on the leading hemisphere in Triton's orbit. Triton may have a leading-trailing asymmetry in its crater population. Based primarily on the similarity of size distributions on Triton and Miranda and the relatively young surface on Triton, the source of Triton's craters is probably comets. The very peculiar size distribution of sharp craters on the ""cantaloupe"" terrain and other evidence suggests they are volcanic explosion craters."
https://openalex.org/W2019478331,"Triton's plumes are narrow columns 10 kilometers in height, with tails extending horizontally for distances over 100 kilometers. This structure suggests that the plumes are an atmospheric rather than a surface phenomenon. The closest terrestrial analogs may be dust devils, which are atmospheric vortices originating in the unstable layer close to the ground. Since Triton has such a low surface pressure, extremely unstable layers could develop during the day. Patches of unfrosted ground near the subsolar point could act as sites for dust devil formation because they heat up relative to the surrounding nitrogen frost. The resulting convection would warm the atmosphere to temperatures of 48 kelvin or higher, as observed by the Voyager radio science team. Assuming that velocity scales as the square root of temperature difference times the height of the mixed layer, a velocity of 20 meters per second is derived for the strongest dust devils on Triton. Winds of this speed could raise particles provided they are a factor of 103 to 104 less cohesive than those on Earth."
https://openalex.org/W1963657817,"The spontaneous decay of chemically bound radioactive atoms affords a route to ions of well-defined structure and charge location, free of counterions. The nuclear nature of the ionization process makes it insensitive to environmental effects, so that exactly the same charged species can be generated, and its reactivity investigated, in widely varying media, from low-pressure gases to liquids and solids. Techniques based on nuclear decay are used in studies of the production of otherwise inaccessible species, the structural characterization of free ions, and the comparative evaluation of their reactivity in different environments, in particular, gas phase and solution."
https://openalex.org/W2019823026,"Analysis of the preliminary results from the Voyager mission to the Neptune system has provided the scientific community with several methods by which the temperature of Neptune's satellite Triton may be determined. If the 37.5 K surface temperature reported by several Voyager investigations is correct, then the photometry reported by the imaging experiment on Voyager requires that Triton's surface have a remarkably low emissivity. Such a low emissivity is not required in order to explain the photometry from the photopolarimeter experiment on Voyager. A low emissivity would be inconsistent with Triton having a rough surface at the approximately 100-microm scale as might be expected given the active renewal processes which appear to dominate Triton's surface."

https://openalex.org/W2057565782,"The Task Force1 on the Science Court Experiment was appointed by the Presidential Advisory Group on Anticipated Advances in Science and Technology to explore the feasibility of a series of experiments to help define the promise and the problems of the Science Court approach for providing factual basis for policy-making. This is an interim report from the Task Force. There are many cases in which technical experts disagree on scientific facts that are relevant to important public decisions. Nuclear power, disturbances to the ozone layer, and food additives are recent examples. As a result, there is a pressing need to find better methods for resolving factual disputes to pvovide a sounder basis for public decisions. We ac? cordingly propose a series of experiments to develop adversary proceedings and test their value in resolving technical disputes over questions of scientific fact.2 One such approach is embodied in a proposed Science Court that is to be concerned solely with questions of scientific fact. It will leave social value questions?the ultimate policy decisions?to the normal decision-making apparatus of our society, namely, the executive, legislative, and judicial branches of government as well as popular referenda. Similar proposals have been made by several authors, and those which have come to the attention of the Task Force are listed in the bibliography."

https://openalex.org/W2009918765,"Again in 1990, drastic depletion of stratospheric ozone over the South Pole has been measured, in August 140 Dobson units, far below the 220 Dobson units typically seen over Antarctica. This extensive destruction of ozone is determined to be brought about by sunshine acting in combination with the chlorine released from chlorofluorohydrocarbons (CFCs) by icy stratospheric clouds. It is concluded that CFC concentrations have now reached a level that will almost totally destroy the ozone in the lower stratosphere in most years."

https://openalex.org/W2083576716,"The search for high-temperature superconductors (HTS) with increasing critical temperatures, {Tc}, seems to have come to a halt. Therefore, promising research in the use of HTS seems to be the new route of approach. Most research is focusing on YBa{sub 2}Cu{sub 3}O{sub x} in various forms. Small specimens of this material have been glued together to produce a single magnet. The ceramic has been fired at a lower temperature to produce smaller grains that do not contain the microcracks found in larger grains, and silver has been added to form a microcomposite both of which improve the mechanical properties of the HTS. Laser ablation has been used to form transite-like devices out of HTS material. A device based on a thallium-based HTS material has been developed at Sandia National Laboratory. This device uses magnetic flux to modulate a current."
