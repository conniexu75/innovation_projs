https://openalex.org/W2096273252,"Recent work has shown that a major population of murine influenza A specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL) recognize the viral nucleoprotein. In order to investigate the mechanism by which this nonglycoprotein component of the virus is recognized by CTL, a series of deletion mutants of an A virus NP gene were studied. The results showed that CTL recognize three distinct epitopes of the NP molecule. Both N- and C-terminal fragments of the protein are transported, independently of each other, to the site of recognition by CTL. These findings imply that a mechanism may exist for transport to the cell surface and presentation to CTL, of viral proteins and protein fragments that lack defined signal sequences."

https://openalex.org/W1975173778,"A crucial event during angiogenesis is the invasion of the perivascular extracellular matrix by sprouting endothelial cells. To investigate the possible role of proteases in endothelial cell invasiveness in vitro, bovine microvascular endothelial cells (BMEC) grown on collagen gels were treated with phorbol myristate acetate (PMA), a tumor promoter that markedly increases their production of collagenase and plasminogen activator. Whereas control BMEC were confined to the surface of the gels, PMA-treated BMEC invaded the underlying collagen matrix, where they formed an extensive network of capillary-like tubular structures. This phenomenon, which mimics some of the events occurring during angiogenesis in vivo, required protein synthesis and intercellular contact, was accompanied by collagen degradation, and was prevented by the metalloprotease inhibitor 1,10-phenanthroline."
https://openalex.org/W1606765224,"We describe the properties of a family of 22-amino acid peptides, the mu-conotoxins, which are useful probes for investigating voltage-dependent sodium channels of excitable tissues. The mu-conotoxins are present in the venom of the piscivorous marine snail, Conus geographus L. We have purified seven homologs of the mu-conotoxin set and determined their amino acid sequences, as follows, where Hyp = trans-4-hydroxyproline. GIIIA R.D.C.C.T.Hyp.Hyp.K.K.C.K.D.R.Q.C.K.Hyp.Q.R.C.C.A-NH2 [Pro6]GIIIA R.D.C.C.

Using the major peptide (GIIIA) in electrophysiological studies on nerve-muscle preparations and in single channel studies using planar lipid bilayers, we have established that the toxin blocks muscle sodium channels, while having no discernible effect on nerve or brain sodium channels. In bilayers the blocking kinetics of GIIIA were derived by statistical analysis of discrete transitions between blocked and unblocked states of batrachotoxin-activated sodium channels from rat muscle. The kinetics conform to a single-site, reversible binding equilibrium with a voltage-dependent binding constant. The measured value of the equilibrium KD for GIIIA is 100 nM at OmV, decreasing e-fold/34 mV of hyperpolarization. This voltage dependence of blocking is similar to that of tetrodotoxin and saxitoxin as measured by the same technique. The tissue specificity and kinetic characteristics suggest that the mu-conotoxins may serve as useful ligands to distinguish sodium channel subtypes in different tissues."

https://openalex.org/W2046954253,"Anti-sense thymidine kinase (TK) RNA was expressed as part of a chimeric dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) anti-sense TK transcript. High level expression was obtained by selection of cells resistant to progressively higher levels of methotrexate, provided by over-production of DHFR. The result was a concomitant increase in intracellular anti-sense TK RNA level owing to its presence on the same transcription unit as DHFR. In several cell lines expressing high levels of anti-sense TK RNA, thymidine kinase activity was reduced by 80%–90%. RNA:RNA duplexes were detected in the nuclear fraction. The results suggest a mechanism for diminution of TK activity; anti-sense RNA hybridizes with sense TK RNA in the nucleus, and duplex containing TK transcripts fail to enter the cytoplasm with normal efficiency."
https://openalex.org/W2000254114,"We have found reverse transcriptase activity and virus-like particles only in yeast cells that contain a galactose-promoted Ty element induced on galactose. The cofractionation of reverse transcriptase, genomic-length Ty RNA, and a Ty-specified protein antigen in a particulate fraction and the ability of this complex to synthesize specifically a product that is homologous to the entire Ty suggest that reverse transcription of Ty RNA takes place in the particle. The absence of appreciable levels of reverse transcriptase and particles in uninduced cells despite the presence of at least 35 copies of chromosomal Ty elements suggests that some of these elements may be defective. The numerous virus-like particles visible in thin sections of Ty transposition-induced cells appear not to be infectious. These particles resemble the intracisternal A-type particles of the mouse and copia particles of Drosophila. The results support the idea that Ty elements and retroviruses share a common origin."

https://openalex.org/W2151814085,"The gene for mouse myelin basic protein (MBP) was mapped to chromosome 18 by hybridization of cloned MBP probes to DNA from hamster-mouse hybrid cell lines, showing it to be linked to the shiverer mutation which causes abnormal CNS myelination. Genomic blotting experiments show that in the mutants five of six exons which constitute the wild-type gene have been deleted. In shiverer brains the steady state level of transcripts that initiate correctly at the 5′ end of the remaining exon I is reduced 16-fold. These RNAs are not spliced correctly and are not efficiently polyadenylated. It is proposed that the partial deletion of the MBP gene is an important part of the shiverer lesion."
https://openalex.org/W1594621311,"We have studied the effects of methotrexate (MTX-Glu1) and the polyglutamate derivatives of methotrexate (MTXPGs) with 2, 3, 4, and 5 glutamyl residues on the catalytic activity of thymidylate synthase purified from MCF-7 human breast cancer cells and on the kinetics of the ternary complex formation by 5-fluoro-2'-deoxyuridine 5'-monophosphate, folate cofactor, and thymidylate synthase. MTX-Glu1 exhibited uncompetitive inhibition of thymidylate synthase when reaction kinetics were analyzed by either double reciprocal plots or a computerized mathematical model based on nonlinear least-squares curve fitting. The Ki for MTX-Glu1 inhibition was 13 microM and the I50 was 22 microM, irrespective of the degree of polyglutamation of the folate. In contrast, the polyglutamated derivatives of MTX all acted as noncompetitive inhibitors. The MTXPGs had 75-300-fold greater potency than MTX-Glu1 as inhibitors of thymidylate synthase catalytic activity, with Ki values from 0.17 to 0.047 microM for MTX-Glu2 to MTX-Glu5, respectively. Neither MTX-Glu1 nor MTXPGs promoted the formation of a charcoal-stable ternary complex with thymidylate synthase and 5-fluoro-2'-deoxyuridine 5'-monophosphate. CH2-H4PteGlu5 (where PteGlu represents pteroylglutamic acid) was found to be 40-fold more potent than CH2-H4PteGlu1 in participating in the formation of a ternary complex, and 10 microM MTX-Glu5 significantly inhibited the formation of a ternary complex containing this folate as cofactor. The inhibition was determined to be due to a reduction in the kon. The potency of this inhibition was markedly greater in the presence of CH2-H4PteGlu1 as compared to CH2-H4PteGlu5. This finding suggests that the degree of interference with complex formation in intact cells would depend on the state of polyglutamation of available folate cofactor. Ternary complex formation with H2PteGlu5 as the folate cofactor was also investigated, and a 50% reduction in complex formation was found in the presence of a 2 microM concentration of MTX-Glu5. These findings have significant implications regarding the mechanism of action of MTX-Glu1 and contribute to an understanding of the complex interactions of MTX-Glu1 and 5-fluorouracil."

https://openalex.org/W2008091979,"We report that the 12,000 dalton domain of fibronectin that interacts with fibroblast cell surfaces also binds specifically to thrombin-inducible, saturable receptors on platelets. Furthermore, we have used chemical cross-linking and monoclonal antibodies to show that the 12,000 dalton domain of fibronectin interacts directly with glycoprotein IIIa at the platelet cell surface. Both binding and cross-linking of this domain to platelets are competed by a hexapeptide previously shown to block fibroblast adhesion to fibronectin. Finally, we show that a complex of the platelet glycoproteins IIIa and IIb binds to affinity columns of a cell-attachment fragment of fibronectin. These results localize a major fibronectin-platelet interaction to a specific domain of fibronectin and to a specific platelet glycoprotein."
https://openalex.org/W2037871888,"A growth factor detected in the medium of vaccinia-virus-infected cells was purified to homogeneity. Sequence analysis shows it to be a processed form of a polypeptide encoded in the vaccinia virus genome which is related to epidermal growth factor (EGF) and alpha-transforming growth factor (alpha TGF). The amino terminus of the processed vaccinia virus growth factor (VVGF) begins at residue 20 of the primary translation product, indicating a signal sequence has been removed. The amino acid composition of purified VVGF predicts the carboxyl terminus is at, or near, residue 96, suggesting a transmembrane sequence has also been removed from secreted VVGF, which is, therefore, approximately 77 amino acids. VVGF, unlike EGF or alpha TGF, is glycosylated. VVGF binds to the EGF receptor and stimulates its autophosphorylation, suggesting that vaccinia virus has acquired sequences encoding a growth factor that may allow it to subvert EGF receptor-dependent functions."
https://openalex.org/W2140365038,"A mouse cosmid library was screened with a cDNA clone for rat small (M, 14,000) myelin basic protein (MBP). The entire MBP gene was isolated. Five exons were detected with the cDNA clone, which encode the Mr 14,000 MBP. A sixth exon, detected using a synthetic oligonucleotide, encodes the 41 amino acids specific to the Mr 18,500 form of MBP. Splicing together all six exons would give rise to Mr 18,500 MBP, while an mRNA omitting exon V would be translated to produce Mr 14,000 MBP. Further experiments indicate that there is probably a single MBP gene in the mouse genome, and that there is a single major 5' end for mouse MBP transcripts, 47 bp 5' of the initiator methionine codon."
https://openalex.org/W1966142934,"c-myc Messenger RNAs are known to be extremely unstable (t1/2 = 10 min) in normal and tumor cells, suggesting that degradation could play an important role in regulating their steady state level in the cytoplasm. We have investigated the stabilities of c-myc mRNAs in three murine plasmacytomas, where the c-myc gene either remains intact (ABPC20) or exists in a truncated form (MPC-11 and J558L) subsequent to 6;15 or 12;15 chromosome translocations respectively, and in an A-MuLV-induced pre-B lymphoma line (18-81.5) that lacks chromosome translocations and contains both c-myc genes in their normal context. The truncated myc genes in J558L and MPC-11 lack the promoters of the normal gene but are transcribed from cryptic promoters within the first c-myc intron. We found that posttranscriptional processes are largely responsible for the higher steady state accumulations of truncated c-myc transcripts, while broken and intact c-myc genes are transcribed at comparable rates."
https://openalex.org/W2024943390,"Three independent T cell hybridomas were isolated that have identical specificities for antigen and products of the major histocompatibility complex (MHC). All three react with the same clone-specific antireceptor antibody, and Southern blots show all three contain the same rearranged alpha and beta genes. Variants of one of these hybridomas, DO-11.10, were isolated that had lost the ability to respond to antigen plus MHC. These proved to have lost the DO-11.10-specific alpha or beta genes or both. Fusion of alpha-loss variants to beta-loss variants restored reactivity. These results indicate that the specific recognition of antigen plus MHC is determined solely by the alpha/beta-containing T cell receptor."
https://openalex.org/W1923688770,"Procedures are described for separation of the alpha, beta 1, and beta 2 subunits of the voltage-sensitive sodium channel from rat brain by gel filtration in sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) before and after reduction of intersubunit disulfide bonds or by preparative SDS-gel electrophoresis. Partial proteolytic maps of the SDS-denatured subunits indicate that they are nonidentical polypeptides. They are all heavily glycosylated and contain complex carbohydrate chains that bind wheat germ agglutinin. The apparent molecular weights of the separated subunits were estimated by gradient SDS-gel electrophoresis, by Ferguson analysis of migration in SDS gels of fixed acrylamide concentration, or by gel filtration in SDS or guanidine hydrochloride. For the alpha subunit, SDS-gel electrophoresis under various conditions gives an average Mr of 260,000. Gel filtration methods give anomalously low values. Removal of carbohydrate by sequential treatment with neuraminidase and endoglycosidase F results in a sharp protein band with apparent Mr = 220,000, suggesting that 15% of the mass of the native alpha subunit is carbohydrate. Electrophoretic and gel filtration methods yield consistent molecular weight estimates for the beta subunits. The average values are: beta 1, Mr = 36,000, and beta 2, Mr = 33,000. Deglycosylation by treatment with endoglycosidase F, trifluoromethanesulfonic acid, or HF yields sharp protein bands with apparent Mr = 23,000 and 21,000 for the beta 1 and beta 2 subunits, respectively, suggesting that 36% of the mass of the native beta 1 and beta 2 subunits is carbohydrate."
https://openalex.org/W1549365118,"Expression of a region of the Moloney murine leukemia virus (M-MuLV) pol gene in Escherichia coli resulted in the synthesis of reverse transcriptase activity which could be detected in crude extracts. Construction of deletions at the 3' terminus of this gene resulted in a 4-fold increase in the level of the reverse transcriptase activity in the soluble fraction of crude lysates and yielded the high level production of a stable protein species of Mr = 71,000. Purification of this protein by column chromatography on DEAE-cellulose, phosphocellulose, polyribocytidylic acid-agarose, and hydroxylapatite indicated that it was a multifunctional enzyme containing RNase H and reverse transcriptase activity. The Mr = 71,000 species had a sedimentation coefficient of 4.65 S by glycerol gradient centrifugation, indicating that the enzyme was a monomer. Using poly(A)+ mRNAs primed with oligo(dT), the enzyme synthesized double-stranded DNA copies between 1.3 and 9.9 kilobases in length. Synthesis of long cDNA required 8 mM Mg2+, 4 mM Mn2+, 2 mM dNTPs, and saturating levels of enzyme. Actinomycin D efficiently limited the enzyme to the first strand synthesis. Additional characteristics of the fusion protein are described."
https://openalex.org/W1571456015,"Two isozymes of the Na,K-ATPase were purified from rat renal medulla and rat brainstem axolemma, and antisera were raised in rabbits. When antibody titers were measured, two sera showed specificity for either the kidney or axolemma Na,K-ATPases and had limited cross-reactivity which could be removed by cross-adsorption. In blots of polyacrylamide gels, these sera reacted with only the alpha or alpha (+) Na,K-ATPase catalytic subunits, while they cross-reacted with both types of beta subunits. Two other sera each recognized both alpha and alpha (+), indicating that the catalytic subunit isozymes have additional shared antigenic determinants. A comparison of the Na,K-ATPases from the brains of different vertebrate species indicates that birds and fish differ from mammals and amphibians in the manifestation of Na,K-ATPases isozymes. Neither neuraminidase nor endoglycosidase F treatment eliminated specific antibody reaction or affected the electrophoretic mobilities of the alpha and alpha (+) subunits, although endoglycosidase F increased the mobilities of the two types of beta subunits to similar final apparent molecular weights. Blots of the peptide fragments produced by incomplete papain and trypsin digests of the alpha and alpha (+) subunits were stained with the specific sera, and the patterns of immunoreactive fragments were found to be markedly different. The results suggest that the antigenic differences reside in differences in the primary protein sequences of the two isozymes."
https://openalex.org/W1655889108,"To determine the role of free cytosolic calcium ([Ca+2]i) in stimulated enzyme secretion from exocrine pancreas, we determined the effects of various pancreatic secretagogues on [Ca+2]i and amylase release in dispersed acini from the guinea pig pancreas. Cholecystokinin-octapeptide (CCK-OP), carbachol, and bombesin, but not vasoactive intestinal peptide, stimulated rapid increases in [Ca+2]i from 100 to 600-800 nM that were independent of extracellular calcium. The increases in [Ca+2]i were transient (lasting less than 5 min) and correlated with an initial rapid phase of amylase release. After 5 min, secretagogue-stimulated amylase release occurred at basal [Ca+2]i. Carbachol pretreatment of the acini abolished the effects of CCK-OP and bombesin on [Ca+2]i and the initial rapid phase of amylase release. 4 beta-phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) had no effect on [Ca+2]i but stimulated an increase in amylase release. The addition of CCK-OP or A23187 to PMA-stimulated acini caused an increase in [Ca+2]i and PMA-stimulated amylase release only during the first 5 min after addition of these agents. These results indicate that CCK-OP, carbachol, and bombesin release calcium from an intracellular pool, resulting in a transient increase in [Ca+2]i and that this increase in [Ca+2]i mediates enzyme secretion during the first few minutes of incubation. The results with PMA suggest that secretagogue-stimulated secretion not mediated by increased [Ca+2]i (sustained secretion) is mediated by 1,2-diacylglycerol."
https://openalex.org/W1546020694,"When angiotensin II stimulates aldosterone secretion, it causes a rapid but transient mobilization of calcium from an intracellular pool and a sustained increase in the influx of calcium in adrenal glomerulosa cells. The present studies were undertaken to determine the respective roles of the two angiotensin II-induced changes in cellular calcium metabolism in modulating events during the sustained phase of cellular response which is thought to be mediated by the C-kinase branch of the calcium messenger system. The sustained response to angiotensin II is only 50% of maximal in cells pretreated with dantrolene in a concentration sufficient to inhibit the angiotensin II-induced mobilization of intracellular calcium. Also, if A23187 is added to cells simultaneously with 1-oleoyl-2-acetylglycerol (OAG), the aldosterone secretory response is similar to that seen after angiotensin II. However, if A23187 is added first and the transient aldosterone secretory response allowed to decay, and OAG then added, the sustained aldosterone secretory response is only 45-50% of maximal. Addition of the calcium channel agonist, BAY K 8644, with OAG leads to an aldosterone secretory response which is only 50% of maximal, but if upon addition of OAG and BAY K 8644 the cells are also exposed for 5 min to media containing 8 mM K+, then the sustained secretory response is maximal. These data imply that the initial transient rise in the [Ca2+] of the cell cytosol plays a role in determining the extent to which C-kinase is shifted from its calcium-insensitive to its calcium-sensitive form. The second group of experiments examined the relationship between the sustained angiotensin II-induced increase in plasma membrane calcium influx and the sustained aldosterone secretory response. The results show that in the presence of 1 microM nitrendipine or 2 mM extracellular K+, angiotensin II causes no increase in calcium influx and only a transient rather than a sustained increase in the rate of aldosterone secretion indicating that the sustained phase of the response is dependent upon a continued high rate of Ca2+ influx which regulates the rate of turnover of the activated C-kinase."
https://openalex.org/W1492156350,"The characteristics of angiotensin II-, K+-, and adrenocorticotropin (ACTH)-induced calcium influx were studied in isolated adrenal glomerulosa cells. Basal calcium influx rate is 0.64 +/- 0.09 nmol/min/mg of protein. Addition of angiotensin II (1 nM) causes a rapid 230% increase in calcium influx rate. This angiotensin II-induced calcium influx is sustained and is rapidly reversed by angiotensin II antagonist, [Sar1,Ala8]angiotensin II. Addition of either K+ or ACTH (1 nM) causes a 340 or 160% increase, respectively, in the rate of calcium influx. The effect of either angiotensin II, K+, or ACTH on calcium influx is dependent on extracellular calcium. The apparent Km for calcium is 0.46, 0.35, and 0.32 mM, respectively. When the extracellular concentration of K+ is 2 mM, neither angiotensin II nor ACTH stimulates calcium influx. Conversely, when extracellular K+ is increased to 6 mM, both angiotensin II and ACTH cause a greater stimulation of calcium influx than at 4 mM K+. When extracellular K+ is increased to 10 mM, calcium influx is 360% of the basal influx seen at 4 mM K+, and neither angiotensin II nor ACTH further stimulates the influx rate. Nitrendipine (1 microM) blocks both angiotensin II- and K+-induced calcium influx completely. In contrast, 10 microM nitrendipine does not completely block ACTH-induced calcium influx. The calcium channel agonist, BAY K 8644, also stimulates calcium influx; 10 nM BAY K 8644 leads to a rate of calcium influx which is 185% of basal. This BAY K 8644-induced increase in calcium influx and that caused by either angiotensin II or ACTH are additive. In contrast, BAY K 8644 has more than an additive effect on the calcium influx when paired with 6 mM K+. These results suggest that angiotensin II, K+, and ACTH stimulate calcium influx via a common calcium channel but act by different mechanisms to alter its function."
https://openalex.org/W2060695079,"The ground squirrel hepatitis virus (GSHV) belongs to a recently defined class of viruses with open circular DNA genomes that encode proteins in extensively overlapping reading frames and appear to replicate via RNA intermediates. We have determined the primary structure of the major GSHV transcripts in the livers of infected ground squirrels. Both major classes of transcripts, 2.3 kb and 3.5 kb, are plus-stranded, unspliced, polyadenylated at a common position, and display heterogeneous 5' ends that can encode proteins with different amino termini. The 2.3 kb transcripts, like their structural analogs transcribed from human hepatitis B virus DNA, are likely mRNAs for products of the major surface antigen and presurface coding domains. The 3.5 kb transcripts are likely mRNAs for one or more products of the core antigen reading frame; these transcripts also encompass the entire genome and contain terminal redundancies of 130-160 nucleotides that include a putative initiation site for reverse transcription."

Like the type I topoisomerases from several eukaryotic cells, phospho-RII X cAMP can relax both positive and negative superhelical turns of phi X174 DNA. Topological isomers with a decreasing number of superhelical turns can be identified as transient products.

https://openalex.org/W1565070195,"Using the preparation of purified glucose transporter from human erythrocytes as antigen, we have prepared and characterized six monoclonal antibodies. Three of these antibodies have been shown to be to the glucose transporter by several criteria: they immunoprecipitate the transport activity, the cytochalasin B binding activity, and 75% of the protein from the solubilized purified preparation. The remaining three antibodies were shown to recognize the same polypeptide by a Western blot procedure. All of the antibodies reacted with the deglycosylated transporter and are thus against peptide determinants; most bound to the cytoplasmic domain of the transporter. The antibodies exhibited a range of effects on cytochalasin B binding, from slight enhancement to modest inhibition to strong inhibition; for this reason they must bind to at least three different epitopes. Western blot analysis of erythrocyte membranes prepared in the presence of protease inhibitors showed that all six antibodies bound to a polypeptide of average Mr = 55,000. Moreover, by immunological assay this polypeptide accounted for 5.3% of the membranes protein, a value similar to that given by cytochalasin B binding. Thus, the proposal that the native transporter is a Mr = 100,000 polypeptide is highly unlikely. The antibodies also react with the glucose transporter in other human cell types, but not with that in rodent or avian cells."

After transformation into adenosine deaminase-deficient Escherichia coli hosts, recombinant plasmids containing functional murine adenosine deaminase cDNAs were identified by selecting for functional complementation. Analysis of plasmids containing functional adenosine deaminase cDNA sequences strongly suggested that adenosine deaminase expression resulted mainly from beta-lactamase/adenosine deaminase fusion proteins even when the adenosine deaminase codons were out-of-frame with respect to the beta-lactamase gene codons upstream. The nucleotide sequence of a 1.65-kilobase pair cDNA insert in one of the functional recombinant clones was determined and found to contain a 1056-nucleotide open reading frame. When this 1056-nucleotide open reading frame was inserted into a mammalian expression vector and introduced into monkey kidney cells, a high level of authentic mouse adenosine deaminase was produced. Nucleic acid blot analysis using a full-length adenosine deaminase cDNA clone as probe revealed that the mouse adenosine deaminase structural gene was at least 21 kilobase pairs in size and encoded three polyadenylated mRNAs. Analysis of the cDNA library from which the functional clones were isolated suggested that this approach of cloning functional mammalian adenosine deaminase cDNA clones by genetic complementation of enzyme-deficient bacteria could be accomplished even if the abundance of the adenosine deaminase mRNA sequences were as low as approximately 0.001%."
https://openalex.org/W1568536515,"Human serum spreading factor (SF) is a blood glycoprotein that promotes attachment and spreading and influences growth, migration, and differentiation of a variety of animal cells in culture. SF purified from human plasma or serum by chromatographic methods reported previously (Barnes, D. W., and Silnutzer, J. (1983) J. Biol. Chem. 258, 12548-12552) does not bind to heparin-Sepharose under conditions of physiological ionic strength and pH. In a further examination of the heparin-binding properties of human serum SF, we found that exposure of purified SF to 8 M urea altered several properties of the protein, including heparin affinity, and these alterations remained after removal of the urea from SF solutions. Urea-treated SF bound to heparin under physiological conditions, and salt concentrations of 0.4 M or higher were required for elution of urea-treated SF from heparin-Sepharose at pH 7.0. The alteration of heparin-binding properties of SF also was observed upon exposure of the protein to heat or acid. Treatment of SF with urea, heat, or acid resulted additionally in greatly decreased cell spreading-promoting activity of the molecule. The decreased biological activity was associated with a reduced ability of the treated SF to bind to the cell culture substratum, a prerequisite for the attachment-promoting activity of the molecule. Experiments examining the heparin-binding properties of native SF in unfractionated human plasma indicated that the major portion of SF in blood did not bind to heparin under conditions of physiological ionic strength and pH."

Using a middle repetitive DNA sequence called alpha-DNA as a target sequence, we have compared the sequence specificity of bleomycin-induced DNA cleavage in intact human cells and in purified human DNA. Bleomycin induces numerous cleavage sites in alpha-DNA which vary widely in intensity and give rise to a complex pattern of bands on a DNA sequencing gel. Unexpectedly, the intensity and position of bleomycin-induced DNA cleavage sites are very similar in intact human cells and in purified human DNA."
https://openalex.org/W1487700094,"Docking protein is a 73-kDa integral membrane protein of the rough endoplasmic reticulum. It is essential for translocation of nascent secretory proteins into the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum. Monoclonal and polyclonal antibodies have been generated which, in conjunction with limited proteolysis, have been used to characterize several subspecies of docking protein. These proteolytic fragments have been analyzed with respect to the various functions ascribed to docking protein which can be assayed in vitro. Proteolytic digestion of membrane-associated or of affinity-purified intact docking protein showed that: elastase cleavage generates a 59-kDa soluble fragment and one of 14 kDa which contains the membrane anchoring domain; trypsin as well as endogenous proteolysis generates a 46-kDa fragment, leaving a 27-kDa domain containing the membrane anchor. This 27-kDa fragment can be reduced to a 13- and a 14-kDa piece by elastase digestion. The characteristics of these various subspecies were examined. The 59-kDa soluble fragment, which can reconstitute full translocation activity to docking protein-depleted microsomes (Meyer, D. I., and Dobberstein, B. (1980) J. Cell Biol. 87, 503-508) was capable of releasing a signal recognition particle-mediated translation arrest. The 46-kDa fragment was neither able to reassociate with nor to reconstitute the activity of docking protein-depleted microsomes. Moreover this fragment was unable to release a signal recognition particle-mediated arrest. This suggests that the 13-kDa fragment (the difference between 46 and 59 kDa) is both essential for association with the membrane, and for the release of translation arrests."
https://openalex.org/W1606766566,"Antibodies to substance P (SP) produced in rabbits have been characterized for their specificity toward SP and some 30 SP-related peptides. For each compound, we observed a close correlation between capacity of binding to anti-SP antibodies and biological activity, namely their spasmogenic effect on guinea pig ileum in vitro and their hypotensive effect in the rat in vivo, indicating that the combining sites of anti-SP and SP receptor(s) are structurally very similar. Further immunization of five rabbits with anti-SP immunoglobulins elicited in two allotype-matched animals the production of anti-SP anti-idiotypic antibodies. These latter antibodies were found to strongly inhibit the spasmogenic action of SP on the guinea pig ileum. In contrast, they specifically enhanced, like SP, phospholipid turnover in rat parotid gland cells, a physiological function mediated through an activation of SP receptors. Immunocytochemical studies actually revealed the presence of specific membranous binding sites for anti-idiotypic antibodies on the parotid gland-dissociated cells. The anti-idiotypic antibodies described here, which thus behave either as agonists or antagonists for SP depending on the biological test, might be used as original and powerful tools not only in studies of the receptor stereospecificity but also in attempts to purify the membranous SP receptors."
https://openalex.org/W2096910052,"Abstract The alkaline sucrose density gradient centrifugation method was modified to permit detection of 1 lesion/10(9) daltons of DNA. With this technique, the involvements of DNA polymerases in DNA repair of damage by dimethyl sulfate, UV irradiation, neocarzinostatin, and bleomycin were studied in HeLa cells with the aid of the DNA polymerase inhibitors aphidicolin and 2',3'-dideoxythymidine. DNA repair after UV-induced damage seemed to involve only polymerase alpha, while repair of damage by the other three agents involved both polymerase alpha and a non-alpha polymerase, probably polymerase beta. But repair after damage by dimethyl sulfate differed from that after damage by neocarzinostatin or bleomycin with respect to the co-operations of polymerase alpha and polymerase beta: in repair of dimethyl sulfate-induced damage, both polymerases operated on the same lesions, whereas after damage by neocarzinostatin or bleomycin, polymerase alpha and polymerase beta functioned independently on different lesions."
https://openalex.org/W1598184974,"Twenty-one hybridoma cell lines which secret antibodies to the subunits of the Escherichia coli F1-ATPase were produced. Included within the set are four antibodies which are specific for alpha, six for beta, three for gamma, four for delta and four for epsilon. The antibodies were divided into binding competition subgroups. Two such competition subgroups are represented for the alpha, beta, and epsilon subunits, one for delta and three for gamma. The ability to bind intact F1-ATPase was demonstrated for some of the antibodies to alpha and beta, and for all of those to delta, while the antibodies to gamma and epsilon gave unclear results. All of the antibodies to alpha and beta which bound ATPase were found to have effects on the ATPase activity of purified E. coli F1-ATPase. One of those to alpha inhibited activity by about 30%. Another anti-alpha was mildly stimulatory. The four antibodies to beta which bound ATPase inhibited activity by 90%. In contrast, membrane-bound ATPase was hardly affected by the antibodies to alpha, but was inhibited by 40-60% by the antibodies to beta. The other antibodies to alpha and beta bound only free subunits, or partially dissociated ATPase, suggesting that their epitopes are buried between subunits in ATPase. These antibodies had no effects on activity. The ability of the antibodies to recognize ATPase subunits present in crude extracts from mitochondria, chloroplasts, and a variety of bacteria was tested using nitrocellulose blots of sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gels. One anti-beta specifically recognized proteins in the range of 50,000-60,000 daltons in each of the extracts, although the reaction with mitochondrial beta was weak. Some of the other antibodies had limited cross-reaction, but most were specific for the E. coli protein. In some species, those proteins which were recognized by the anti-beta ran with a higher apparent molecular weight than proteins which were recognized by an anti-alpha. All antibodies which exhibited cross-reactivity were found to recognize sites which were not exposed in intact ATPase, implying that the surfaces which lie between subunits are most highly conserved."
https://openalex.org/W1560402984,"Apoprotein E (apo-E) is a surface component of several classes of plasma lipoproteins. It functions as a ligand for receptor-mediated uptake of lipoproteins. Granulosa cells from ovaries of diethylstilbestrol-stimulated hypophysectomized immature rats cultured in serum-free medium with [35S]methionine secretes a 34-kDa protein which reacts with a monospecific anti-rat apo-E antibody and represents 0.2% of total secreted protein. Protease mapping confirms that this protein is apoprotein E. The secreted apoprotein E may be complexed with lipid since it floats in the ultracentrifuge at density less than 1.21 micrograms/ml. Freshly isolated granulosa cells contain receptors for follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) but not for human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) or prolactin. Apoprotein E secretion is stimulated 2-fold by FSH, but hCG and prolactin have no effect. When granulosa cells develop hCG and prolactin receptors after 48 h of culture with FSH, apoprotein E secretion is not stimulated by addition of FSH, hCG, or prolactin although steroidogenesis is induced. The addition of 10(-7) M androgen plus FSH stimulates a marked increase in progestin synthesis over FSH alone, but androgen has little added effect on apoprotein E secretion. Cholera toxin (1.25 micrograms/ml) and dibutyryl cAMP (5 mg/ml), both of which increase intracellular cAMP, stimulate apo-E secretion 9-fold and 12-fold, respectively. The dibutyryl cAMP effect is dependent on both dose (greater than or equal to 0.5 mg/ml required) and time (onset at 24 h, maximum at 48 h, and back to near baseline at 96 h). Isobutylmethylxanthine, a phosphodiesterase inhibitor, augments FSH-stimulated apoprotein E synthesis 2.5-fold, supporting a role for cAMP in mediating the FSH effect. This is the first demonstration of the hormonal regulation of apoprotein E synthesis in an extrahepatic tissue."
https://openalex.org/W2058883949,"Cap methylation was examined in the early sea urchin embryo. Nucleotide analyses of 3H-methyl methionine-labeled RNA in two-cell embryos and in unfertilized eggs show that fertilization activates the cap methylation of about 10(7) RNA molecules. Greater than 37% of methyl-labeled RNAs following fertilization hybridize with so-called early histone genes H1, H4, and H2B, which encode a subpopulation of the maternal mRNA molecules. Activation of RNA cap methylation is inhibited by aphidicolin, but not by actinomycin D, suggesting that this process is temporally coordinated with DNA replication, but independent of RNA transcription. These results indicate that the translational activation of maternal early histone mRNA during fertilization is a consequence of cap methylation of mRNAs incompletely formed during oogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W1521312055,"Intestinal cytosol receptors for 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 (1,25(OH)2D3) were subjected to limited trypsin digestion, and the properties of the resulting discrete polypeptide fragments were identified and contrasted with the native 1,25(OH)2D3 receptor. Physical characterization was achieved through sedimentation analysis, gel filtration chromatography, and DEAE anion exchange high performance liquid chromatography. Intactness of functional ligand-binding domains was evaluated by assessing macromolecular retention of 1,25(OH)2D3 as well as by determining reactivity to DNA and monoclonal antibody. While two differentially trypsin-sensitive effects on the 1,25(OH)2D3 receptor were noted, both produced a major polypeptide fragment which retained 1,25(OH)2D3. Action within region I (1 microgram of trypsin/A280-A310) had no effect on net charge but significantly decreased the Stokes radius of the 1,25(OH)2D3 receptor from 3.6 nm (60,000 daltons) to 3.2 nm, concomitant with a significant reduction in receptor aggregational capacity. This large hormone-bound fragment did not elicit detectable DNA-binding activity, and only a portion displayed reactivity to monoclonal antibody. Activity within region II (25 micrograms of trypsin/A280-A310) resulted in a less charged, more globular macromolecule with a Stokes radius of 2.9 nm which was completely unreactive to monoclonal antibody. Immunoblot methodology confirmed the protease-dependent loss of immunologic reactivity of the 60,000-dalton 1,25(OH)2D3 receptor and correspondingly identified receptor fragments of 50,000 and 20,000 daltons displaying positive immunologic reactivity. These studies provide the first evidence for the distinct nature of the molecular domains for 1,25(OH)2D3 and DNA on 1,25(OH)2D3 receptors while confirming the close spatial relationship between interactive sites for DNA and monoclonal antibody."
https://openalex.org/W1530436910,"Androgen-regulated changes in the abundance of two mRNAs in mouse kidney have been studied with the aid of a cDNA clone. The clone was isolated from a library prepared using poly(A+) RNA from kidneys of androgen-induced mice and is designated MAK-I. Unique DNA sequence from MAK-I hybridizes to multiple RNAs which are approximately 1600 and 2200 nucleotides long, and Southern blot analysis of genomic DNA suggests that there is a single gene from which the RNAs are transcribed. When the MAK RNAs are isolated by hybrid selection and translated in a cell-free system, one polypeptide of 42,000 daltons is obtained. The transcripts, in combination, comprise approximately 0.2% of poly(A+) RNA in the kidneys of male mice. Following treatment with testosterone, this level increases 3-fold. The uninduced level of MAK mRNA in female kidneys is half of that exhibited by males and is increased 8-fold by testosterone. The mRNAs are also present and their abundance is hormonally controlled in the liver. Levels of MAK RNA detected in submaxillary gland, heart, brain, muscle, and testes are unaffected by testosterone treatment. Differences in the relative amounts of the different sized mRNAs are observed for several tissues. In addition, brain and muscle contain an intermediate sized mRNA instead of the smaller one seen in other tissues. Functional androgen receptor is required for expression of MAK RNA in kidney as shown by reduced levels in Tfm mice. Hormones produced by or controlled by the pituitary gland do not appear to be involved in the regulation of MAK RNA levels."
https://openalex.org/W1546906674,"The human protease inhibitor alpha 2-macroglobulin (alpha 2 M) is inactivated by reaction with methylamine. The site of reaction is a protein functional group having the properties of a thiol ester. To ascertain the relationship between thiol ester cleavage and protein inactivation, the rates of methylamine incorporation and thiol release were measured. As expected for a concerted reaction of a nucleophile with a thiol ester, the rates were identical. Furthermore, both rates were first order with respect to methylamine and second order overall. The methylamine inactivation of alpha 2M was determined by measuring the loss of total protease-binding capacity. This rate was slower than the thiol ester cleavage and had a substantial initial lag. However, the inactivation followed the same time course as a conformational change in alpha 2M that was measured by fluorescent dye binding, ultraviolet difference spectroscopy, and limited proteolysis. Thus, the methylamine inactivation of alpha 2M is a sequential two-step process where thiol ester cleavage is followed by a protein conformational change. It is the latter that results in the loss of total protease-binding capacity. A second assay was used to monitor the effect of methylamine on alpha 2M. The assay measures the fraction of alpha 2M-bound protease (less than 50%) that is resistant to inactivation by 100 microM soybean trypsin inhibitor. In contrast to the total protease-binding capacity, this subclass disappeared with a rate coincident with methylamine cleavage of the thiol ester. alpha 2M-bound protease that is resistant to a high soybean trypsin inhibitor concentration may reflect the fraction of the protease randomly cross-linked to alpha 2M. Both the thiol ester cleavage and the protein conformational change rates were dependent on methylamine concentration. However, the thiol ester cleavage depended on methylamine acting as a nucleophile, while the conformational change was accelerated by the ionic strength of methylamine. Other salts and buffers that do not cleave the thiol ester increased the rate of the conformational change. A detailed kinetic analysis and model of the methylamine reaction with alpha 2M is presented. The methylamine reaction was exploited to study the mechanism of protease binding by alpha 2M. At low ionic strength, the protein conformational change was considerably slower than thiol ester cleavage by methylamine. Thus, at some time points, a substantial fraction of the alpha 2M had all four thiol esters cleaved, yet had not undergone the conformational change. This fraction (approximately 50%) retained full protease-binding capacity.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)"
https://openalex.org/W1579712508,"Reaction of either human C5a or its des-Arg74 derivative (des-Arg74-C5a) with tetranitromethane under nondenaturing conditions results in selective nitration of only 1 of the 2 tyrosine residues found in these glycopolypeptides. This reactive tyrosyl residue was identified as that found in position 23 of the sequence. Nitrotyrosyl23-C5a and -des-Arg74-C5a were separated from their respective unmodified precursors by cation-exchange fast protein liquid chromatography. These purified derivatives served as reagents for the subsequent preparation of both aminotyrosyl23-C5a and -des-Arg74-C5a as well as photoreactive analogs of C5a. Radioimmunoassays performed with C5a derivatives serving as competing ligands and a murine antihuman C5a monoclonal antibody employed as first antibody demonstrated that selective modification of tyrosine23 did not produce a detectible alteration in the antigenic properties of C5a. By contrast, either nitro- or aminotyrosyl23-C5a was approximately 3-fold less active than native C5a in both bioassays and competitive ligand-receptor binding assays. Additionally, photoreactive derivatives prepared by coupling either N-succinimidyl-6-(4'-azido-2'-nitrophenylamino)-hexanoate or p-nitrophenyl-2-diazo-3,3,3-trifluoropropionate to aminotyrosyl23-C5a at pH 5.0 failed to interact with the neutrophil C5a receptor. These observations suggest that the tyrosyl23 residue of C5a may participate importantly in the binding interactions of this chemotactic factor and its granulocyte receptor."
https://openalex.org/W1532155386,"The structure of apolipoprotein B and its stoichiometry on plasma lipoproteins has been a major issue and one refractory to a variety of analyses. Immunochemical analyses represent an independent approach. Examinations of apolipoprotein B (apo-B) epitopes on human plasma low density lipoproteins (LDL) using monoclonal antibodies have consistently revealed the existence of extensive apo-B heterogeneity. In the present study, we have addressed the solution of the stoichiometry problem using quantitative analysis of the maximum number of identical antibodies that can be bound per LDL particle in which we take into account this ligand heterogeneity. We have estimated the molecular weight of apo-B by quantifying the number of times a given apo-B epitope is expressed on the surface of LDL. The quantitative binding of eight previously characterized monoclonal antibodies was measured in a fluid phase radioimmunoassay. The results were analyzed by Scatchard analysis and expressed on the basis of independent measurements of the maximum amount of LDL that could be bound by each antibody. Affinity constants for each of the eight antibodies varied between 8.5 X 10(7) and 80 X 10(7) M-1. For these same antibodies, the concentration of maximally bound antibody at a normalized LDL concentration of 1000 ng/ml was estimated to be 0.9-1.8 nM with a mean of 1.23 nM. Adopting a molecular mass from physicochemical analysis for LDL apo-B of 550,000 daltons, the molar ratio between bound antibody and LDL varied between 0.5 and 1.2 (mean 0.75 +/- 0.15). The results supported the hypothesis that apo-B is present as a single large molecular weight polypeptide in LDL."
https://openalex.org/W1549299298,"The in vivo production of RNA that is complementary to the mRNA of a particular target gene (anti-sense RNA) appears to be an effective tool for the regulation of genes in Escherichia coli (Coleman, J., Green, P.J., and Inouye, M. (1984) Cell 37, 429-436). These investigators demonstrated that short anti-sense transcripts which are complementary to the ribosome binding site of the target mRNA are overwhelmingly the most effective in blocking protein synthesis. We have constructed plasmids which produce thermally regulated anti-sense transcripts of three regions of the E. coli lac Z gene coding sequence, and have examined the relative effects of these constructs on the synthesis of the lac Z gene product, beta-galactosidase. We conclude that there is a strong correlation between the length of RNA complementarity and the suppression of beta-galactosidase synthesis. Furthermore, a significant inhibition of translation can be obtained when the anti-sense transcript lacks complementarity to the 5' noncoding region of the mRNA, provided that the extent of complementarity with the coding sequence is considerable."

https://openalex.org/W1596362865,"The addition of glucose to the medium of Tetrahymena thermophila results in a 7-fold repression of galactokinase (EC 2.7.1.6; ATP:D-galactose-1-phosphotransferase). The presence of millimolar amounts of the catecholamines dopa, dopamine, norepinephrine, and epinephrine or the hormone glucagon also results in the repression of galactokinase in the absence of glucose. The addition of millimolar amounts of adrenergic agonists (isoproterenol, tyramine, 2-amino-6,7-dihydroxytetrahydronaphthalene) results in significant repression of galactokinase in the absence of glucose; concentrations of 2-amino-6,7-dihydroxytetrahydronaphthalene less than or equal to 10(-4) M result in a derepression of galactokinase specific activity. Addition of adrenergic antagonists (propranolol, dichloroisoproterenol) have no effect on galactokinase activity at concentrations less than 10(-4) M but do arrest cell growth at greater concentrations. The addition of the cAMP analogs caffeine or theophylline in millimolar amounts results in repression of galactokinase activity; however, cell growth is greatly slowed or completely arrested at these concentrations. Analysis of the repression response of several mutants demonstrates that mutants deficient in catecholamine biosynthesis are altered in their regulation of galactokinase. Measurements of intracellular cAMP levels for 0-24 h following the addition of several of the above compounds to exponentially growing cells did not demonstrate any change over this period. Measurement of intracellular cAMP levels for 24 h following the addition of glucose or galactose to exponentially growing wild-type and mutant cell strains did not demonstrate any difference in cAMP concentrations over this period although a wide range of galactokinase activity was exhibited. Starvation of wild-type cells prior to the addition of glucose in minimal medium without added carbohydrate resulted in a significant increase in cAMP following the addition of glucose. This increase is demonstrated to be dependent upon the ability of the cells to resume division after the arrest of growth and is not correlated with galactokinase regulation. These results support the conclusion that cAMP is not involved in the repression of galactokinase gene expression initiated by glucose or hormone-like effectors and demonstrate the participation of an adrenergic control system in galactokinase regulation which is subordinate to the regulation by glucose. A possible model is discussed."
