https://openalex.org/W2009550948,"The multiple biological activities of tumor necrosis factor (TNF) are mediated by two distinct cell surface receptors of 55 kd (TNFRp55) and 75 kd (TNFRp75). Using gene targeting, we generated a TNFRp55-deficient mouse strain. Cells from TNFRp55-/- mutant mice lack expression of TNFRp55 but display normal numbers of high affinity TNFRp75 molecules. Thymocyte development and lymphocyte populations are unaltered, and clonal deletion of potentially self-reactive T cells is not impaired. However, TNF signaling is largely abolished, as judged by the failure of TNF to induce NF-κB in T lymphocytes from TNFRp55-deficient The loss of TNFRp55 function renders mice resistant to lethal dosages of either lipopolysaccharides or S. aureus enterotoxin B. In contrast, TNFRp55-deficient mice are severely impaired to clear L. monocytogenes and readily succumb to infection. Thus, the 55 kd TNFR plays a decisive role in the host's defense against microorganisms and their pathogenic factors."

https://openalex.org/W2053235171,"Null mutant mice for retinoic acid receptor γ2 (RARγ2) or all RARγ isoforms were generated. RARγ2 mutants appeared normal, whereas RARγ mutants exhibited growth deficiency, early lethality, and male sterility due to squamous metaplasia of the seminal vesicles and prostate. These defects were previously observed in vitamin A-deficient animals and could be prevented by RA administration, demonstrating that RARγ mediates some of the retinoid signal in vivo. Congenital defects included Harderian gland agenesis, tracheal cartilage malformations, and homeotic transformations along the rostral axial skeleton, establishing a direct link between RA and patterning of the axial skeleton. We also show that in utero RA-induced lumbosacral truncations are mediated by RARγ. The observed RARγ null phenotype suggests a high degree of functional redundancy among the RARs. The variable penetrance of some of the observed defects is discussed in light of this redundancy and stochastic variation of gene activity."

In some cells, low voltage-activated calcium channels have been proposed to underlie a depolarizing potential that regulates bursting. The sequence of a rat brain calcium channel alpha 1 subunit (rbE-II) was deduced. Although it is structurally related to high voltage-activated calcium channels, the rbE-II channel transiently activated at negative membrane potentials, required a strong hyperpolarization to deinactivate, and was highly sensitive to block by nickel. In situ hybridization showed that rbE-II messenger RNA is expressed in regions throughout the central nervous system. The electrophysiological properties of the rbE-II current are consistent with a type of low voltage-activated calcium channel that requires membrane hyperpolarization for maximal activity, which suggests that rbE-II may be involved in the modulation of firing patterns."
https://openalex.org/W1505365469,"We have detected a common (allele frequency 0.53/0.47) single base pair insertion/deletion polymorphism 675 base pairs upstream from the start of transcription of the plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1) gene, using the chemical cleavage mismatch analysis. Band shift assays suggest that the allele with the single base pair insertion contains an additional protein binding site which is not present in the del allele. Competition experiments confirmed that the binding was specific to the sequence of the ins allele and suggest that proteins bound to this site may be NF-kB-like proteins. Analysis of chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) mRNA produced by constructs containing the PAI-1 promoter (-805 to +83) showed that the deletion allele produced six times more mRNA than the insertion allele in response to interleukin-1 (p < 0.001). In a sample of 107 young patients with previous myocardial infarction and 95 healthy population-based subjects, the del allele was associated with increased PAI-1 levels, 21% higher than the sample mean in the del homozygotes (p < 0.05). This study also suggested that individuals homozygous for the del allele may have an altered response to the acute phase stimulus. Taken together these results suggest that the insertion/deletion polymorphism in the PAI-1 promoter is of functional importance in regulating the expression of the PAI-1 gene."
https://openalex.org/W2042480227,"Transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) affects cellular proliferation, differentiation, and interaction with the extracellular matrix primarily through interaction with the type I and type II TGF-beta receptors. The type II receptors for TGF-beta and activin contain putative serine-threonine kinase domains. A murine serine-threonine kinase receptor, Tsk 7L, was cloned that shared a conserved extracellular domain with the type II TGF-beta receptor. Overexpression of Tsk 7L alone did not increase cell surface binding of TGF-beta, but coexpression with the type II TGF-beta receptor caused TGF-beta to bind to Tsk 7L, which had the size of the type I TGF-beta receptor. Overexpression of Tsk 7L inhibited binding of TGF-beta to the type II receptor in a dominant negative fashion. Combinatorial interactions and stoichiometric ratios between the type I and II receptors may therefore determine the extent of TGF-beta binding and the resulting biological activities."
https://openalex.org/W2029545106,"Transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) is a multifunctional protein that regulates cell proliferation and differentiation and extracellular matrix production. Although two receptor types, the type I and type II receptors, have been implicated in TGF-beta-induced signaling, it is unclear how the many activities of TGF-beta are mediated through these receptors. With the use of cells overexpressing truncated type II receptors as dominant negative mutants to selectively block type II receptor signaling, the existence of two receptor pathways was shown. The type II receptors, possibly in conjunction with type I receptors, mediate the induction of growth inhibition and hypophosphorylation of the retinoblastoma gene product pRB. The type I receptors are responsible for effects on extracellular matrix, such as the induction of fibronectin and plasminogen activator inhibitor I, and for increased JunB expression. Selective inactivation of the type II receptors alters the TGF-beta response in a similar manner to the functional inactivation of pRB, suggesting a role for pRB in the type II, but not the type I, receptor pathway."

https://openalex.org/W2034607609,"The three-dimensional solution structure of the DNA binding domain (DBD) of the retinoid X receptor alpha (RXR alpha) was determined by nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. The two zinc fingers of the RXR DBD fold to form a single structural domain that consists of two perpendicularly oriented helices and that resembles the corresponding regions of the glucocorticoid and estrogen receptors (GR and ER, respectively). However, in contrast to the DBDs of the GR and ER, the RXR DBD contains an additional helix immediately after the second zinc finger. This third helix mediates both protein-protein and protein-DNA interactions required for cooperative, dimeric binding of the RXR DBD to DNA. Identification of the third helix in the RXR DBD thus defines a structural feature required for selective dimerization of the RXR on hormone response elements composed of half-sites (5'-AGGTCA-3') arranged as tandem repeats."
https://openalex.org/W2093098283,"P-type Ca2+ channels in cerebellar Purkinje neurons were inhibited by GABA and the GABAB receptor agonist baclofen. Inhibition of P-type Ca2+ channel current involved changes in voltage dependence and kinetics. Baclofen induced a slow phase of activation and altered tail current kinetics, and inhibition could be partly overcome by large depolarizations. These effects were mimicked by internal application of GTP gamma S, which also made the action of baclofen irreversible. In spinal cord neurons, use of selective channel blockers showed that baclofen inhibited both P-type and N-type Ca2+ channels, but not L-type Ca2+ channels; a high threshold current resistant to blockers of P-type, N-type, and L-type channels was also modulated by baclofen. These results show that stimulation of GABAB receptors in central neurons can modulate P-type Ca2+ channels through a G protein-mediated mechanism similar to the one linked to N-type Ca2+ channels."
https://openalex.org/W2089314092,"A collection of yeast strains bearing single marked Ty1 insertions on chromosome III was generated. Over 100 such insertions were physically mapped by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis. These insertions are very nonrandomly distributed. Thirty-two such insertions were cloned by the inverted PCR technique, and the flanking DNA sequences were determined. The sequenced insertions all fell within a few very limited regions of chromosome III. Most of these regions contained tRNA coding regions and/or LTRs of preexisting transposable elements. Open reading frames were disrupted at a far lower frequency than expected for random transposition. The results suggest that the Ty1 integration machinery can detect regions of the genome that may represent ""safe havens"" for insertion. These regions of the genome do not contain any special DNA sequences, nor do they behave as particularly good targets for Ty1 integration in vitro, suggesting that the targeted regions have special properties allowing specific recognition in vivo."
https://openalex.org/W2115494245,"Thymocytes from mice congenitally deficient for TCR alpha chain synthesis were examined for the status of their TCR beta chain genes, by DNA sequencing and by a novel technique that analyzes populations of gene rearrangements. TCR beta chain genes were predominantly productively rearranged, in contrast with the statistical prediction for a quasi-random rearrangement process. Therefore, productive TCR beta chain gene rearrangement appears to be a critical step in thymocyte maturation, independent of TCR alpha chain expression. Moreover, the beta chain gene rearrangements in TCR alpha-/-mice are typical of those found in the thymus and periphery of normal mice. Thus, the extent of junctional diversity is a property of TCR genes that is imposed prior to selection on the mature alpha beta TCR."
https://openalex.org/W139815902,"Vitamin E, the major lipid chain-breaking antioxidant in erythrocyte membranes, is present in low concentration, suggesting that mechanisms should exist to protect against its loss. Enzymatic pathways for the recycling of vitamin E from its tocopheroxyl radical have been observed previously in inner membranes of mitochondria and microsomes. These pathways use electron transport enzymes and their substrates to regenerate vitamin E. Erythrocyte membranes also contain significant NADH-cytochrome c reductase activity, as well as cytochrome b5, the function of which is not yet known. Using an enzymatic oxidation system composed of lipoxygenase and arachidonic acid, free radicals were produced in human erythrocyte membranes, and their reaction with chromanols was followed by ESR and high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). Since the endogenous vitamin E content of the membranes is very low, we used a vitamin E homologue lacking the hydrocarbon chain (2,2,5,7,8-pentamethyl-6-hydroxychromane) as a probe molecule for ESR measurements. However, parallel HPLC determinations of lipid hydroperoxides and of endogenous vitamin E confirmed the results obtained by ESR. It was found that protection against the loss of vitamin E can be provided either by NADH-cytochrome b5-dependent enzymatic recycling or by a nonenzymatic pathway involving ascorbate and dihydrolipoic acid."
https://openalex.org/W2052159815,"Amiloride has been suggested to inhibit responses to a variety of taste stimuli, including salty, sweet, and sour (acid). To test for the involvement of amiloride-sensitive Na+ channels in the transduction of acid stimuli, fungi-form taste receptor cells were examined using patch-clamp techniques. Approximately one-half of all cells had amiloride-sensitive Na+ currents (INa) with a Ki value near 0.2 μM amiloride. After blocking voltage-gated conductances, cells having amiloride sensitivity were tested for responses to acid stimuli. Over three-fourths of cells showed an inward proton current (IH+) with an extrapolated reversal potential near approximately +150 mV, which was completely blocked by amiloride (30 μM). Treatment of isolated taste cells with argininee-vasopressin caused equivalent increases in both INa and IH+; each effect was mimicked by 8-Br-cAMP. Taken together, these results indicate that protons permeate amiloride-sensitive Na+ channels in hamster fungiform taste cells and contribute to acid transduction.

https://openalex.org/W1596505093,"Rat liver peroxisomes contain three acyl-CoA oxidases: palmitoyl-CoA oxidase, which oxidizes the CoA esters of straight chain fatty acids and prostaglandins; pristanoyl-CoA oxidase, which oxidizes the CoA esters of 2-methyl-branched fatty acids (e.g. pristanic acid); and trihydroxycoprostanoyl-CoA oxidase, which oxidizes the CoA esters of the bile acid intermediates di- and trihydroxycoprostanic acids (Van Veldhoven, P. P., Vanhove, G., Asselberghs, S., Eyssen, H. J., and Mannaerts, G. P. (1992) J. Biol. Chem. 267, 20065-20074). In the present report we demonstrate that human liver peroxisomes contain only two acyl-CoA oxidases: palmitoyl-CoA oxidase, which oxidizes the CoA esters of straight chain fatty acids and prostaglandins, and a novel branched chain acyl-CoA oxidase, which oxidizes the CoA esters of 2-methyl-branched fatty acids as well as those of the bile acid intermediates (which also possess a 2-methyl substitution in their side chains). The branched chain acyl-CoA oxidase was purified to near homogeneity by means of column chromatography. It appeared to be a 70-kDa monomeric protein that did not cross-react with antisera raised against rat palmitoyl-CoA oxidase and pristanoyl-CoA oxidase. No indication was found for the presence of a separate trihydroxycoprostanoyl-CoA oxidase in human liver. The branched chain acyl-CoA oxidase was present also in human kidney, suggesting that it is expressed in other extrahepatic tissues as well. Our results explain a number of clinical-chemical observations made in certain cases of peroxisomal beta-oxidation disorders."
https://openalex.org/W1603402598,"To examine the role of the NH2-terminal region of the 402-residue-long beta-1,4-galactosyltransferase (beta-1,4-GT), a series of mutants and chimeric cDNA were constructed by polymerase chain reaction and transiently expressed in COS-7 cells, the enzyme activities were measured, and the protein was localized in the cells by subcellular fractionation or indirect immunofluorescence microscopy. We showed earlier that the deletion of the amino-terminal cytoplasmic tail and transmembrane domain from GT abolishes the stable expression of this protein in mammalian cells (Masibay, A.S., Boeggeman, E., and Qasba, P.K. (1992) Mol. Biol. Rep. 16, 99-104). Further deletion analyses of the amino-terminal region show that the first 21 amino acids of beta-1,4-GT are not essential for the stable production of the protein and are consistently localized in the Golgi apparatus. In addition, analysis of hybrid constructs showed that residues 1-25 of alpha-1,3-galactosyltransferase can functionally replace the beta-1,4-GT amino-terminal domain (residues 1-43). This fusion protein also showed Golgi localization. On the other hand, the alpha-2,6-sialyltransferase/beta-1,4-GT fusion protein (alpha-2,6-ST/beta-1,4-GT) needed additional COOH-terminal sequences flanking the transmembrane domain of the alpha-2,6-ST for stability and Golgi localization. Substitution of Arg-24, Leu-25, Leu-26, and His-33 of the beta-1,4-GT transmembrane by Ile (pLFM) or substitution of Tyr by Ile at positions 40 and 41 coupled with the insertion of 4 Ile residues at position 43 (pLB) released the mutant proteins from the Golgi and was detected on the cell surface. Our results show that (a) the transmembrane domains of beta-1,4-GT, alpha-1,3-galactosyltransferase, and alpha-2,6-ST, along with its stem region, all play a role in Golgi targeting and participate in a common mechanism that allows the protein to be processed properly and not be degraded in vivo; (b) increasing the length of the transmembrane domain overrides the Golgi retention signal and directs the enzyme to the plasma membrane; and (c) the length of the hydrophobic region of the transmembrane domain of beta-1,4-GT is an important parameter but is not sufficient by itself for Golgi retention."

A construct containing 2.9 kilobase pairs of MUC1 5'-flanking sequence sequence showed expression of CAT in breast and pancreatic cell lines but not in the non-epithelial cell lines HT-1080, SK23, and HTB96. Deletion analysis showed that maximum expression was obtained in ZR-75 (breast cancer line) and HPAF (pancreatic cancer line) with only 743 base pairs of 5'-flanking sequence. Sequences within 1.6 kilobase pairs of the transcriptional start site showed enhancing activity in a vector carrying an enhancerless SV40 promoter. Analysis of proximal 5'-sequences in a promoterless CAT vector carrying the SV40 enhancer showed that sequences between -60 and -150 were crucial for tissue-specific expression. An Sp1 site at -99/-90 and an E box (E-MUC1) at -84/-64 in this region were shown by mutational analysis to play a role in the regulation of transcription. Gel shift analysis with oligonucleotides and nuclear extracts of ZR-75 showed protein binding to both of these sites. Sp1 binding activity was similar in ZR-75 and HT1080 cells, whereas binding of factors to the E-MUC1 oligonucleotide revealed quantitative and qualitative differences between epithelial and non-epithelial cells."
https://openalex.org/W1978596696,"Axon terminals from retinal ganglion cells in the left and right eyes initially overlap with each other in the lateral geniculate nucleus of the neonatal ferret, then segregate into eye-specific layers via an activity-dependent process. Brain slices were used to show that, during this period of reorganization, retinal terminals within the lateral geniculate nucleus evoke excitatory postsynaptic currents composed of both NMDA and non-NMDA receptor-mediated currents. The amplitude of these currents could be enhanced for several tens of minutes to more than an hour by several bursts of high frequency synaptic stimulation, and the induction of enhancement appears to depend on NMDA receptor activation. Synaptic enhancement such as this could provide one of the physiological mechanisms by which retinal terminals segregate into eye-specific layers during development."
https://openalex.org/W2170306518,"The carboxyl-terminal half of the heavy chain of tetanus toxin (Hc) contains the domain required for binding to purified gangliosides and neuronal cells. The structural requirements for the interaction of Hc with receptor were studied by generating mutants of Hc with deletions at either the carboxyl or amino terminus and characterizing their binding. A deletion of 10 or more amino acids from the carboxyl terminus resulted in a major loss of Hc binding to purified gangliosides and spinal cord neuronal cells, whereas a deletion of the carboxyl-terminal 5 amino acids did not affect binding. The removal of up to 263 amino acids from the amino terminus did not inhibit binding. Each of the truncated proteins was much more sensitive to trypsin than was full-length Hc, suggesting an alteration in conformation. The receptor binding activity of Hc was not retained in a peptide corresponding to the carboxyl-terminal 20 amino acids. These data suggest that the carboxyl-terminal region of Hc is important for maintaining a conformation necessary for binding to receptor."
https://openalex.org/W1580644393,"Glucose-activated beta-cell insulin secretion depends upon elevation of intracellular calcium concentration, [Ca2+]i, which is thought to arise from Ca2+ influx through voltage-dependent calcium channels. Using fura-2-loaded mouse islets, we demonstrate, in fact, that the major component of the glucose-activated [Ca2+]i rise represents voltage-dependent intracellular Ca2+ release. Furthermore, the Ca2+ release pool possesses a novel pharmacology in that it is caffeine-sensitive but ryanodine-insensitive. In the absence of external Ca2+, glucose still caused intracellular Ca2+ release, an effect blockable by tetrodotoxin. However, depolarization of the islet with KCl in low Ca(2+)-containing solutions induced intracellular Ca2+ release, which was resistant to tetrodotoxin. We conclude that glucose release of intracellular Ca2+ is dependent upon depolarization alone, possibly through increasing inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate production."
https://openalex.org/W1487158137,"A permeable cell system in which Ca2+ release can be evoked by inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3) or agonist stimulation was used to study the regulation of Ca2+ release by Ca2+ itself. At low concentrations, Ca2+ activated IP3-mediated Ca2+ release (IMCR) with half-maximal effect at about 15 nM. At high concentrations, Ca2+ inhibited IMCR giving rise to a biphasic [Ca2+] dependence of IMCR. The activation of IMCR by Ca2+ appears to be mediated by a kinase, probably the Ca(2+)-and calmodulin-dependent protein kinase (CaMKII). Thus, the activation required MgATP, completely blocked at 0 degrees C, required Ca2+, and was inhibited by the CaMKII inhibitors KT5926 and KN62. The inhibition of IMCR seems to be mediated by a protein phosphatase, probably the Ca(2+)-dependent protein phosphatase 2B. Hence, the inhibition required Ca2+, was prevented by the general protein phosphatase inhibitor pyrophosphate and by the immunosuppressants cyclosporin A and FK506, but not by okadaic acid or VO4(2-), and was modified by chelating agents such as EGTA. Stimulation with agonists modified the activities of the kinase and phosphatase to make the release independent of [Ca2+]. This appears to be due to an increase in the apparent affinity for Ca2+ in stimulating IMCR and inhibition of the phosphatase. We suggest that agonist-dependent modification of the kinase/phosphatase activity ratio can be the biochemical pathway responsible for regulation of Ca2+ release and in turn [Ca2+]i oscillations."
https://openalex.org/W1511450172,"Kinesin is an ubiquitous heterotetrameric microtubule-based motor which translocates membrane-bound organelles. Since organelle motility and motor protein function can be regulated by components of signaling pathways, the ability of purified bovine brain (kinesin) to be phosphorylated and to recognize calmodulin (CaM) was tested. Extensively purified kinesin was found to consist of several forms of both heavy (KHC) and light (KLC) chains. Phosphorylation of by a variety of protein kinases was examined; cAMP-dependent protein kinase (cAMP-PK) was the most active enzyme leading to the incorporation of up to 8 mol P/mol kinesin. Phosphorylation occurred predominantly on the KLCs and led to substantial acidic pI shifts. Peptide maps indicated that multiple phosphorylation sites exist on each KLC. Incubation of in vitro with protein kinase C (PKC) led to the phosphorylation of both KHCs and KLCs. In vivo phosphorylation of KHC and KLCs was demonstrated by immunoprecipitation of [32P]-labeled from cultured rat hippocampal pyramidal neurons; phosphorylation was stimulated by 8-chlorophenyl-thio-cAMP or 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate. Native bovine brain was shown to bind 125I-CaM by nucleotide-dependent pelleting with stable microtubules. Specific calcium-dependent binding of 125I-CaM to KLCs but not KHC was found using a ligand blotting assay. cAMP-PK phosphorylated bound 125I-CaM less well than untreated protein in both ligand blotting and microtubule-pelleting paradigms. Calcium-dependent binding of CaM to inhibited the ATPase activity of native but not of cAMP-PK phosphorylated kinesin. These results suggest that the KLCs have a regulatory function and integrate information coming from diverse signaling pathways to modulate the activity and function of kinesin."
https://openalex.org/W1610083062,"Insulin activates the ras proto-oncogene product p21ras (Ras) by stimulating conversion of the inactive GDP-bound form of Ras to the active GTP-bound form. The protein ASH (for abundant Src homology) (Matuoka, K., Shibata, M., Yamakawa, A., and Takenawa, T. (1992) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 89, 9015-9019) is composed of one Src homology (SH)2 and two SH3 domains and highly homologous to the Caenorhabditis elegans protein sem-5 that couples a tyrosine kinase to a Ras protein. We have studied an interaction of ASH with insulin-stimulated tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins in Chinese hamster ovary cells overexpressing human insulin receptors (CHO-HIR cells). In an anti-ASH (alpha ASH) immunoprecipitates, we detected a 170-kDa phosphoprotein that was recognized by an anti-phosphotyrosine antibody and an anti-insulin receptor substrate 1 antibody (alpha IRS-1) from the insulin-stimulated [32P]orthophosphate-labeled CHO-HIR cells. We failed to detect the tyrosine phosphorylation of the protein ASH. These data suggested that insulin stimulates IRS-1.ASH complex formation in intact cells. Incubation of an ASH fusion protein with the lysates of insulin-stimulated CHO-HIR cells revealed that the fusion protein of ASH was able to bind the tyrosine-phosphorylated 170-kDa protein that was recognized by alpha IRS-1. We also demonstrated that fusion protein of ASH was able to bind the fusion protein of tyrosine-phosphorylated IRS-1 fragments, suggesting that ASH is able to bind tyrosine-phosphorylated IRS-1 directly. These data suggest that IRS-1.ASH complex formation may play a role in coupling the insulin receptor kinase to a Ras signaling pathway. Furthermore, we observed an insulin-stimulated phosphatidylinositol (PI) 3-kinase activity in alpha ASH immunoprecipitates, suggesting the formation of an ASH.IRS-1.PI 3-kinase complex. This complex formation was detected as early as 10 s after insulin stimulation in intact CHO-HIR cells. This is the first report that supports the notion that IRS-1 binds several signal transducing molecules containing SH2 domains, thus serves as an SH2 docking protein that transduces insulin's signal multidirectionally."
https://openalex.org/W1588962899,"Phosphatidylinositol (PtdIns) 3-kinase is composed of a catalytic p110 subunit and a regulatory p85 subunit. A synthetic phosphopeptide corresponding to the kinase insert of the human PDGF beta subunit receptor and monoclonal antibodies raised against the two described p85 isoforms, p85 alpha and p85 beta were used to isolate PtdIns 3-kinase from human T lymphocytes. We demonstrate that T cells express both p85 alpha and p85 beta proteins. Both isoforms tightly associate with a p110 protein and with PtdIns 3-kinase activity in T cells. Upon triggering of the T cell antigen receptor (TCR)/CD3 complex or activation of protein kinase C (PKC) the p110 protein complexed to p85 alpha becomes rapidly phosphorylated exclusively on serine residues. p85 alpha does not appear to undergo a change in its basal serine phosphorylation during T cell activation. In contrast, stimulation of the TCR/CD3 complex or PKC, results in a marked and rapid increase in phosphorylation of p85 beta on threonine residues. These data show that PtdIns 3-kinase can be a substrate for serine/threonine kinases in T cells. The differential phosphorylation of p85 alpha and p85 beta reveals the potential for divergent regulation and function of these two PtdIns 3-kinase isoforms during T cell activation."
https://openalex.org/W1535702842,"Variations in glycosylation exist among urokinase plasminogen activator receptors (u-PARs) from different cell types. We have studied the functional role of N-linked carbohydrate within the ligand-binding domain of u-PAR. Treatment with glycosidases demonstrated that all the N-linked carbohydrates on u-PAR are complex-type oligosaccharides. Substitution of a single Asn (Asn52) to Gln by means of site-directed mutagenesis led to an active receptor mutant with a ligand-binding domain devoid of carbohydrate. The cellular distribution, the glycosyl-phosphatidylinositol anchoring, and the conformational stability after solubilization were unaffected by this single substitution. However, ligand binding analysis demonstrated a 4- 5-fold decrease in affinity as compared with the wild type receptor. Two different strategies were used in order to obtain a u-PAR type completely devoid of N-linked carbohydrates. 1) Tunicamycin treatment of wild type u-PAR-expressing cells. 2) Mutation of all glycosylation sites (Hu-PARN5-mut). In neither case, unglycosylated receptors with ligand binding activity were identified. However, immunofluorescence studies demonstrated that the Hu-PARN5-mut was retained inside the cells in the endoplasmic reticulum. The same result was found for Hu-PARN4-mut, where only the glycosylation sites outside the binding domain were mutated. These results demonstrate that some extent of glycosylation of u-PAR is necessary for cellular transport and for molecular maturation events leading to ligand binding activity. Glycosylation of the binding domain per se affects only the affinity of the receptor. The positive modulation of the Asn52 carbohydrate side chain on ligand affinity suggests that the u-PAR glycosylation variants observed in various cell types may have different functional roles."
https://openalex.org/W1579034919,"Farnesyl diphosphate (FPP)/geranylgeranyl diphosphate (GGPP) synthase, a bifunctional enzyme that synthesizes C15 and C20 isoprenoid diphosphates from isopentenyl diphosphate and dimethylallyl diphosphate, was purified to homogeneity from the archaebacterium Methanobacterium thermoautotrophicum. The only activities detected from synthesis of FPP and GGPP copurified through (NH4)2SO4 precipitation and four chromatographic steps. The pure enzyme was a 79-kDa homodimer that catalyzed the sequential addition of isopentenyl diphosphate to dimethylallyl diphosphate, geranyl diphosphate, and FPP by a non-processive mechanism which allowed substantial amounts of FPP to accumulate during turnover, creating a pool for further elongation to GGPP or for synthesis of squalene. The bifunctional enzyme required Mg2+ or Mn2+ and was optimally active at 65 degrees C. Catalysis of chain elongation in M. thermoautotrophicum differs from related reactions in eubacteria and eukaryotes, where distinct FPP synthases and GGPP synthases are found."
https://openalex.org/W1593574040,"A truncated mutant (hPMCA4b(ct120)) of the plasma membrane Ca2+ pump was expressed in COS-1 cells. The full-length pump (hPMCA4b) consisted of 1205 residues, and the mutant lacked 120 residues (including the 28-residue calmodulin-binding inhibitory domain) at the COOH terminus. To characterize this construct, Ca2+ transport was determined in a microsomal fraction. Phosphate was added to increase Ca2+ uptake, and specificity was enhanced by adding thapsigargin to inhibit the endoplasmic reticulum Ca2+ pump. The mutant showed a similar level of expression as hPMCA4b and a Ca2+ affinity and Ca2+ transport activity about equal to that of hPMCA4b when hPMCA4b was activated. Addition of the synthetic peptide C28R2, corresponding to the calmodulin binding region of the pump, inhibited the mutant and restored the non-activated state of the enzyme. In these respects, the truncated mutant acted like hPMCA4b, when hPMCA4b had been proteolyzed to cleave a bond between the calmodulin binding region and the NH2-terminal portion of the molecule. This indicates that the effects of proteolysis are due to removal of the COOH terminus and not to rearrangement of the two fragments. Since the truncated mutant was fully active and its tryptic digestion resulted in the appearance of the expected 81- and 76-kDa active fragments, we concluded that the COOH-terminal portion which is missing cannot be important in synthesis or proper folding of the enzyme."
https://openalex.org/W1526880812,"A tyrosine kinase inhibitor, genistein, caused the subcellular translocation of phosphoinositide-specific phospholipase C (PLC) activity from membrane fractions to cytosolic fractions in rat 3Y1 fibroblasts and their transformants by Rous sarcoma virus, SR-3Y1. The ratio of PLC activities associated with the membrane fractions to those of the homogenate fractions was greater in SR-3Y1 (32.6%) than in 3Y1 (20.8%) whereas membrane-associated PLC activities were strikingly reduced to the same levels in both cells by treatment with genistein. Moreover, it was found by immunoblotting analyses of membrane fractions that the amounts of PLC-gamma 1 isozyme were reduced to 20.4% of initial level in SR-3Y1 and to 30.2% of that in 3Y1 cells. While the levels of PLC-delta, another detectable PLC isozyme, were not altered by genistein suggesting that tyrosine kinase plays an important role in the association of PLC-gamma 1 with membranes. PLC-gamma 1 molecules were detected in anti-p60arc antibody immunoprecipitates of both 3Y1 and SR-3Y1 cells. The amounts of PLC-gamma 1 co-immunoprecipitating with src kinases were higher in SR-3Y1 than 3Y1 cells and were reduced in both cell types by treatment with genistein. In addition, it was confirmed that PLC-gamma 1 purified from rat liver was phosphorylated at a tyrosine residue and associated with viral src kinase and that src kinases associated with the recombinant SH2 region of PLC-gamma 1, expressed in Escherichia coli, depending upon phosphorylation of tyrosine residues. These findings suggest that both viral and cellular src kinases associate with PLC-gamma 1 and may mediate cellular signaling in normal and transformant cell growth."
https://openalex.org/W1532176495,"The alpha 2-adrenergic receptor (alpha 2-AR) is a member of the seven transmembrane-spanning G-protein-coupled receptor superfamily. In the kidney, the alpha 2-AR is most abundant in the epithelial cells of the proximal tubule where it is important in enhancing Na+ reabsorption via the modulation of Na+/H+ exchange. Radioligand binding and physiological studies suggest that the alpha 2-AR residues primarily on the basolateral surface of these proximal tubule cells in vivo. To investigate the mechanisms underlying alpha 2-AR polarization in epithelial cells, we permanently expressed wild-type and an epitope-tagged version of the alpha 2A-AR in Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cells. Using a steady-state surface biotinylation assay, we observe that 80-90% of the alpha 2A-AR in MDCK cell clones is located on the basolateral membrane domain. Immunolocalization studies confirm the biotinylation results and demonstrate that the alpha 2A-AR is actually confined primarily to the lateral domain of the basolateral surface. Metabolic labeling experiments suggest that basolateral polarization of the alpha 2A-AR is achieved by direct targeting of the receptor to the basolateral domain. Targeting of the alpha 2A-AR to the basolateral surface is not perturbed by pertussis toxin-treatment of MDCK cells, suggesting that coupling of the alpha 2A-AR to GTP-binding proteins is not important for receptor polarization."
https://openalex.org/W1598798142,"The Caco-2 human intestinal cell line was used to examine fatty acid esterification during development of the enterocytic phenotype. Acyl-CoA synthetase activity increased approximately 40%, and the incorporation of palmitic acid into triacylglycerol relative to phosphatidylcholine increased nearly 2-fold during Caco-2 differentiation. A rate-limiting enzyme activity in the glycerol 3-phosphate pathway of triacylglycerol synthesis, glycerol-3-phosphate acyltransferase, was at levels comparable with rat jejunum and remained unchanged during differentiation. In contrast, the activity of monoacylglycerol acyltransferase, which is unique to the monoacylglycerol pathway of triacylglycerol synthesis, was present at < 7% of the levels in rat jejunum. Further analysis of the glycerol 3-phosphate pathway showed that the rate-limiting enzyme activities for diacylglycerol conversion to triacylglycerol, diacylglycerol acyltransferase, and phosphatidylcholine, CTP:phosphocholine cytidylyltransferase, increased 2-3-fold and decreased approximately 40%, respectively, during Caco-2 differentiation. In addition, a 2-fold increase in cellular diacylglycerol mass was observed during enterocytic conversion. These data indicate that fatty acid esterification to triacylglycerol in Caco-2 cells occurs primarily via the glycerol 3-phosphate pathway. Furthermore, the differentiation-dependent increase in fatty acid esterification to triacylglycerol relative to phosphatidylcholine appears to result from increased utilization of diacylglycerol to synthesize triacylglycerol and a concomitant decrease in diacylglycerol utilization for phosphatidylcholine synthesis."
https://openalex.org/W1676148024,"The ATP-dependent binding of simian virus 40 (SV40) large tumor antigen (T antigen) to the SV40 origin of replication is an essential step in the initiation of SV40 DNA synthesis. Previous studies indicated that the ATP-dependent complex consists of a double hexamer of T antigen at the origin. The binding reaction and the subsequent unwinding of the duplex DNA from the origin were examined using a gel mobility shift assay. T antigen bound to the core origin cooperatively in the presence of ATP. In the presence of human single-stranded DNA-binding protein (HSSB), T antigen, complexed to the core origin, started the unwinding of duplex DNA. At low concentrations of T antigen and in the presence of ATP, DNA polymerase alpha (pol alpha) stimulated the binding of T antigen to the core origin, while HSSB did not. This stimulation resulted in an increase in the subsequent unwinding reaction in the presence of HSSB. Primase alone did not affect the binding reaction and was not required for the stimulation by pol alpha. The stimulation required the hydrolysis of ATP and the AT tract domain of the core origin. Kinetic studies showed that while pol alpha stimulated the binding of T antigen to the core origin, it did not stabilize the complex. Pol alpha also stimulated the formation of the ATP-dependent T antigen-site I complex, a region that also contains an AT-rich sequence. These observations imply a regulatory role for pol alpha in the initiation of SV40 DNA replication."
https://openalex.org/W1528817098,"The C-terminal portion of the plasma membrane Ca(2+)-ATPase contains different regulatory domains. A recombinant C-terminal fragment of the human plasma membrane Ca(2+)-ATPase 1b isoform (E1079-P1180) was used to study the role of two acidic amino acid stretches located on either side of the calmodulin binding domain, corresponding to synthetic peptides A18 (Vorherr, T., James, P., Krebs, J., Enyedi, A., McCormick, D. J., Penniston, J. T., and Carafoli, E. (1990) Biochemistry 29, 355-365) and B28 (James, P., Pruschy, M., Vorherr, T., Penniston, J. T., and Carafoli, E. (1989) Biochemistry 28, 4253-4258), respectively. The molecular mass of the recombinant C-terminal fragment, as determined by electrospray ionization mass spectrometry, was higher by 39 mass units than the calculated value (12,055 Da). This difference was the result of an EGTA-insensitive Ca2+ ion, which was located by chymotryptic proteolysis in a fragment corresponding to the last 37 amino acids of the expressed protein. Fluorescence experiments on the dansylated recombinant C-terminal fragment titrated with increasing amounts of free Ca2+ revealed two additional Ca2+ binding sites with affinities corresponding to KD values of about 30 and 300 nM, respectively. Stains All spectra of different synthetic peptides, corresponding to subdomains of the expressed protein, indicated that the site with the KD of 30 nM was probably located in the acidic sequence on the N-terminal side of the calmodulin binding domain (peptide A18); the site with the 300 nM KD was apparently located on the C-terminal side of the calmodulin binding domain (peptide B28) or, alternatively, formed by the cooperation of distant residues of the domain."
https://openalex.org/W1559812180,"Abstract Protein phosphatase 2A2 is inactivated by phosphorylation following incubation with purified preparations of an autophosphorylation-activated protein kinase (Hong Guo and Zahi Damuni (1992) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 90, 2500-2504). This protein kinase was purified about 250,000-fold from extracts of bovine kidney to apparent homogeneity. The purified preparations exhibited a single polypeptide of apparent M(r) approximately 36,000. Up to 1 mol of phosphoryl groups was incorporated per mol of the purified kinase following incubation with ATP. This autophosphorylation reaction (t1/2 approximately 0.5-1 min) was accompanied by a approximately 10-fold activation of the kinase. Autophosphorylation and activation were reversed by protein phosphatase 2A2 or the catalytic subunit of protein phosphatase 1. Phosphoamino acid analysis indicated that the kinase underwent autophosphorylation on threonines. The rate of autophosphorylation was independent of the concentration of the enzyme and a slope of 0.97 (gamma = 0.998) was obtained by van't Hoff's plot indicating that autoposphorylation was intramolecular. Relative to myelin basic protein, the enzyme exhibited about 8, 62, 130, 33, 5, and < 0.1% activity with histones H1, H2A, H2B, H3, and H4 and with glycogen synthase alpha, respectively. Heparin inhibited the activity of the enzyme half-maximally at about 20 micrograms/ml. The results indicate that this autophosphorylation-activated kinase is a new protein kinase."
https://openalex.org/W1519469344,"Abstract The small proline-rich protein gene (spr1) is a marker whose expression is frequently associated with squamous cell differentiation. We observed that the expression of the spr1 gene is strongly induced by phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA). Both the time course result and the nuclear run-on transcriptional assay suggested that the regulation of spr1 expression by PMA is controlled at the transcriptional level. To understand the nature of this regulation, human genomic clones of the spr1 gene were isolated. DNA sequence analysis revealed that the human spr1 gene contains two exons and a single intron located within the 5'-untranslated region. An AP-1 binding site (TGAGTCA) is found at -142, and a putative cyclic AMP-responsive element (TGAGGTCA) at -597 base pairs upstream of the transcription start site. A chimeric construct containing the 5'-flanking region of the spr1 gene and the chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) reporter gene was used to transfect HeLa cells or monkey primary TBE cells. The CAT activity in transfected cells is stimulated 7.5-11-fold by PMA, and the stimulation is inhibited by a protein kinase C inhibitor or by pretreating cells with PMA to down-regulate the protein kinase C activity. The CAT activity is also stimulated 3.5-fold by dibutyryl cyclic AMP, a protein kinase A activator. The stimulations by PMA and cAMP are additive. These results suggest that protein kinase C and probably protein kinase A play important roles in regulating the transcription of the spr1 gene."
https://openalex.org/W1504163363,"Herein, we report that overexpression of either human or murine interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) receptors lacking their entire intracellular domains in cells bearing functionally active IFN gamma receptors ablates responsiveness to homologous ligand in a dominant negative manner. Unresponsiveness could also be induced in murine cells overexpressing murine IFN gamma receptor mutants that either lack 39 COOH-terminal amino acids or contain an alanine substitution for a functionally critical tyrosine. Overexpression of the full-length receptor did not alter cellular responsiveness to IFN gamma. The inhibitory activities of the receptor mutants were dose-dependent, generalizable to a variety of cellular responses, and specific. Cells expressing 100:1 ratios of mutant to wild-type receptor were unresponsive to IFN gamma even at doses 30,000 times greater than that required to induce a maximal response in wild-type cells. These results provide an example of a dominant negative mutation that effects the complete inactivation of a transmembrane receptor lacking a kinase domain and suggest a more general utility for dominant negative mutations in the study of cytokine receptor function."
https://openalex.org/W1543675846,"Abstract Cultured pig kidney epithelial cells were transfected with a chimeric P-type ATPase catalytic subunit composed of the NH2-terminal half of the rat gastric H,K-ATPase and the COOH-terminal half of the rat Na,K-ATPase (alpha 1 isoform). Low concentrations of ouabain (< or = 0.2 mM) were used to inhibit completely the endogenous pig Na,K-ATPase and high concentrations (5 nM) to test the sensitivity of the chimeric rodent pump. In the presence of a low concentration of ouabain, a small but significant inhibition of residual Rb+(K+) influx by 5 mM ouabain was observed in only the transfected cells. Conditions were found in which a similar component of Rb+ influx was inhibited by the gastric H,K-ATPase inhibitor SCH28080, consistent with SCH28080 binding to the extracellular H1-H2 loop of this enzyme. These experiments demonstrate that this chimera behaves as a functional ion pump and indicate that the protein domains involved in cardiac glycoside binding are not confined to the amino-terminal half of the Na,K-ATPase."
https://openalex.org/W1648690878,"Abstract A DNA helicase, called DNA helicase alpha, was purified from HeLa cells to apparent homogeneity. The helicase and its single-stranded DNA-dependent ATPase activities cosedimented in glycerol gradients with two polypeptides of 110 and 90 kDa with a sedimentation coefficient of 7.4 S. The DNA helicase was markedly stimulated by DNA substrates with a 5'-tailed fork. A DNA substrate with a 3'-tailed fork structure was less stimulatory, although it was more active than substrates without a fork. The directionality of unwinding is 3'-->5' with respect to the single-stranded DNA to which the enzyme was bound. The helicase activity also required a single-stranded DNA-binding protein (SSB) for unwinding activity. The stimulation by SSBs was nonspecific; all SSBs tested, such as human SSB, bacteriophage T4 gene 32, and Escherichia coli SSB, stimulated the DNA helicase activity to a varying extent in the presence of a fork structure. With long duplex substrates (> 500 base pairs), the presence of a fork substantially stimulated the DNA helicase activity in the presence of E. coli SSB. Human SSB stimulated the DNA helicase activity to the greatest extent (> 10-fold) with a substrate containing a fork compared with substrates without a fork. DNA helicase activity required ATP hydrolysis and could be supported by all eight nucleoside triphosphates. The Km values for ATP and dATP in unwinding were 28 and 48 microM, respectively. In general, ribonucleoside triphosphates were better effectors than deoxyribonucleoside triphosphates. The properties of this DNA helicase make it a candidate for a DNA replicative helicase in human cells."
https://openalex.org/W1526474794,"The melibiose carrier of Escherichia coli couples sugar transport to H+, Na+, and Li+, while that of Klebsiella pneumoniae utilizes only H+ and Li+. We made five chimeric carriers derived from the two carriers to identify the region(s) involved in Na+ recognition. The chimeric carriers E2K10, E4K8, E6K6, E8K4, and E10K2 have the amino-terminal 77, 144, 197, 298, and 349 amino acid residues derived from E. coli and the rest derived from K. pneumoniae, respectively. Melibiose accumulation through the chimeric carriers E2K10, E4K8, and E6K6 was strongly stimulated by Na+ and Li+ as is the case with the E. coli carrier. On the other hand, there was very little stimulation with the carriers E8K4 and E10K2. These results suggest that, 1) the amino-terminal 77 amino acids of the E. coli carrier, which has 5 different and 4 fewer amino acids than the K. pneumoniae carrier, have a crucial role in Na+ recognition in melibiose transport and 2) the carboxyl-terminal half of the carrier also forms a part of the Na+ recognition site which may be distorted in chimeric structures. In contrast with melibiose accumulation, there was very little Na+ stimulation of TMG (methyl-1-thio-beta-D-galactopyranoside) transport and no Na+ stimulation was observed in lactose transport with any of the chimeric carriers, whereas in E. coli Na+ stimulates TMG and lactose transport. These results suggest that there is no universal Na+ recognition site for all the sugar substrates. Instead different parts of the carrier seem to participate in cation recognition for different sugar substrates."
https://openalex.org/W1559233041,"Epithelin 1 and 2 are cysteine-rich proteins that act as growth modulators of epithelial cells. In this report, we have characterized the epithelins receptors of MDA-MB-468 human breast carcinoma cells using both binding and cross-linking techniques. Equilibrium binding studies of iodinated epithelin 1 indicated that two classes of binding sites are expressed at the surface of breast carcinoma cells. The high affinity sites had a dissociation constant of approximately 2 x 10(-10) M, with approximately 290 receptors/cell. The low affinity sites had a dissociation constant of approximately 10(-8) M, with approximately 32,000 receptors/cell. Binding of iodinated epithelin 1 was specifically inhibited by unlabeled epithelin 1, 2, or 3, but not by other growth factors tested. We also performed competition binding studies of 125I-epithelin 1 to cell surface receptors in the presence of unlabeled epithelin 1, 2, or 3. Binding results analyzed by the method of Scatchard suggested that all three epithelins interact with a same receptor. A 140-145-kDa epithelin 1-binding protein complex was identified by chemical cross-linking of 125I-epithelin 1 to breast cancer cells. Formation of such a complex was prevented by coincubation of 125I-epithelin 1 with an excess of unlabeled epithelin 1, 2, or 3."

Although a component in the chain of pyrimidine catabolism, imidase is capable of serving in a broader role that includes detoxication of xenobiotics. The enzyme catalyzes the hydrolytic cleavage of imides that range from the linear to the heterocyclic and that include hydantoins, dihydropyrimidines, and phthalimide. For some substrates, the reaction is experimentally reversible. The pH activity curves are a function of the pKa of the individual substrate's imino group, with cleavage favored at a pH near the respective pKa value. There is evidence for stereoselectivity and for stereospecificity. A mechanism is proposed for the enzyme-catalyzed reaction."
https://openalex.org/W1550149310,"We have analyzed the respiratory chains in the log-arithmic and stationary growth phases of Bacillus subtilis cells grown in rich glucose medium. The cytochrome c branch of the respiratory chain was absent from both types of cells, which used a quinol oxidase branch for respiration. Cytochrome aa3-600 was found to be the major terminal oxidase in log phase cells. This enzyme was shown to translocate protons across the membrane in addition to the charge separation in the oxidation of quinol. Both cytochromes d and aa3-600 were expressed in the stationary phase. After inhibition of the latter by cyanide, cytochrome d was shown to catalyze charge separation during quinol oxidation, but not to pump protons across the membrane. A CO-binding membrane-bound cytochrome of approximately 17 kDa, called cytochrome b558, was presented in log phase cells. This protein did not exhibit oxidase activity and did not have the characteristics of members of the conserved terminal oxidase family."
https://openalex.org/W1512345591,"CaM kinase-Gr is a Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase that is enriched in brain and thymus. The enzyme was isolated from rat cerebellum, which contained alpha (M(r) 65,000) and beta (M(r) 67,000) polypeptides, and rat forebrain, which contained only the alpha polypeptide. Both enzyme preparations readily underwent autophosphorylation with dramatic up-regulation of their Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent, as well as-independent, activity. Autophosphorylation also caused a characteristic retardation in the electrophoretic gel mobility of the alpha and beta polypeptides. Treatment of autophosphorylated CaM kinase-Gr with acid phosphatase fully dephosphorylated the enzyme and reversed the changes in electrophoretic migration of both polypeptides. Phosphopeptide mapping indicated that the alpha and beta polypeptides were phosphorylated on identical or homologous sites, which probably induces similar structural and catalytic modifications in the two polypeptides. The actual site(s) of autophosphorylation was determined by the purification and amino acid sequencing of tryptic peptides from 32P-labeled CaM kinase-Gr. The major site of autophosphorylation was localized to a novel N-terminal domain, which is rich in Ser/Thr/Pro residues. The functional and structural studies on CaM kinase-Gr autophosphorylation imply that the enzyme is comprised of two regulatory domains, one on either side of a catalytic domain, followed by a C-terminal, putative association domain. The properties of such a structural model are discussed."
https://openalex.org/W1589735741,"The mitogenic effect of extracellular ATP on IMR-90 human fibroblasts subjected to in vitro aging was studied. ATP stimulated DNA synthesis and cell proliferation in young cells as much as epidermal growth factor (EGF) or insulin, while it stimulated aged cells to a much greater extent than seen for any other growth factor tested. When combined with EGF or insulin, ATP restored the greatly reduced mitogenic responsiveness of aged cells nearly to the level noted for young cells. Addition of prostaglandin E2 or other agents that elevate cAMP levels resulted in inhibition of DNA synthesis stimulated by EGF or insulin. Furthermore, the basal release of arachidonic acid and prostaglandin E2 and the endogenous levels of cAMP rose during aging and became much greater than in young cells. All three of these changes were suppressed by extracellular ATP. ATP-dependent suppression of cAMP accumulation was pertussis toxin-sensitive. Protein kinase C down-regulation inhibited arachidonate metabolism and enhanced DNA synthesis stimulated by ATP. These studies suggest that ATP exerts its mitogenic effect, especially on aged IMR-90 cells, at least partially by suppression of arachidonate metabolism."
https://openalex.org/W1620663301,"A mutation substituting a valine for phenylalanine at residue 382 in the insulin receptor alpha-subunit has been found in two sisters with a genetic form of extreme insulin resistance. This receptor mutation impairs the ability of the hormone to activate autophosphorylation of solubilized receptors and phosphorylation of substrates (Accili, D., Mosthaf, L., Ullrich, A., and Taylor, S. I. (1991) J. Biol. Chem. 266, 434-439). We have previously demonstrated that in native receptors insulin induces a conformational change in the receptor beta-subunit, which is thought to be necessary for receptor activation (Baron, V., Gautier, N., Komoriya, A., Hainaut, P., Scimeca, J. C., Mervic, M., Lavielle, S., Dolais-Kitabgi, J., and Van Obberghen, E. (1990) Biochemistry 29, 4634-4641). Hence, it was thought that a defect in this conformational change might explain the functional defect of the mutant receptor. This appears to be the case, as we demonstrate here that the mutant receptor is locked in its inactive configuration. However, we found two monoclonal antibodies, directed to the extracellular domain, which are capable of restoring the mutant receptor kinase activity. The activation of the mutant receptor was accompanied by restoration of conformational changes in the beta-subunit C terminus. From these data, we draw the two following conclusions. (i) A causal link exists between receptor kinase activation and the occurrence of conformational changes. (ii) Ligands other than insulin, such as antibodies, which perturb the extracellular domain, can function as alternative ways to restore the mutant receptor kinase."
https://openalex.org/W1534561101,"The type I interleukin-1 receptor (IL-1R) is capable of transducing a signal resulting in promoter activation in T cells. This signal transduction is dependent on the cytoplasmic domain, which consists of 213 amino acids. In contrast to the type I receptor, the type II IL-1R has a small cytoplasmic tail, and it is not clear whether this receptor is a signal-transducing or a regulatory molecule. Here we report that the type II IL-1R does not mediate gene activation in Jurkat cells. However, a hybrid receptor composed of the extracellular and transmembrane regions of the human type II interleukin-1 fused to the cytoplasmic domain of the human type I IL-1R was capable of transducing a signal across the membrane resulting in a pattern of gene activation identical to that mediated by the type I IL-1R. Our results indicated that the extracellular domain of the type II IL-1R was capable of functionally interacting with interleukin-1 and transmitting the resulting signal to a heterologous cytoplasmic domain."
https://openalex.org/W1530818588,"The best characterized yeast guanine nucleotide releasing factor is CDC25, which acts on RAS and thereby stimulates cAMP production in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. In order to determine if CDC25 could be a specific GDP-GTP releasing factor for the mammalian proteins Ha-ras, Ki-ras, and N-ras, its functions were studied both in vitro and in NIH3T3 cells. The 561 amino acid composing the C-terminal domain of CDC25 (CDC25 C-domain) released guanine nucleotides (both GDP and GTP) from Ha-, Ki-, and N-ras but not from Rap1A, Rab5, and Rab11. CDC25 acted on oncogenically activated Ha-ras even if the last 23 amino acids (167-189) of the Ras proteins were not present. CDC25 transformed NIH3T3 cells; its transforming capacity was enhanced by overexpression of wild-type Ha-ras. CDC25 C-domain probably exerts its effects through the activation of cellular Ras proteins. These data suggest that the CDC25 C-domain can function as an upstream activator of Ras proteins in a heterologous system and therefore could be a useful tool to study the regulation of Ras activation by growth factor receptors."
