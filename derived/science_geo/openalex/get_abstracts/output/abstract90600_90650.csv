https://openalex.org/W1984387553,"We have determined the sequences of separate germline genetic elements which encode two parts of a mouse immunglobulin heavy chain variable region. These elements, termed gene segments, are heavy chain counterparts of the variable (V) and joining (J) gene segments of immunoglobulin light chains. The VH gene segment encodes amino acids 1-101 and the JH gene segment encodes amino acids 107-123 of the S107 phosphorylcholine-binding VH region. This JH gene segment and two other JH gene segments are located 5' to the mu constant region gene (Cmu) in germline DNA. We have also determined the sequence of a rearranged VH gene encoding a complete VH region, M603, which is closely related to S107. In addition, we have partially determined the VH coding sequences of the S107 and M167 heavy chain mRNAs. By comparing these sequences to the germline gene segments, we conclude that the germline VH and JH gene segments do not contain at least 13 nucleotides which are present in the rearranged VH genes. In S107, these nucleotides encode amino acids 102-106, which form part of the third hypervariable region and consequently influence the antigen-binding specificity of the immunoglobulin molecule. This portion of the variable region may be encoded by a separate germline gene segment which can be joined to the VH and JH gene segments. We term this postulated genetic element the D gene segment, referring to its role in the generation of heavy chain diversity. Essentially the same noncoding sequences are found 3' to the VH gene segment and as inverse complements 5' to two JH gene segments. These are the same conserved nucleotides previously found adjacent to light chain V and J gene segments. Each conserved sequence consists of blocks of seven and ten conserved nucleotides which are separated by a spacer of either 11 or 22 nonconserved nucleotides. The highly conserved spacing, corresponding to one or two turns of the DNA helix, maintains precise spatial orientations between blocks of conserved nucleotides. Gene segments which can join to one another (VK and JK, for example) always have spacers of different lengths. Based on these observations, we propose a model for variable region gene rearrangement mediated by proteins which recognize the same conserved sequences adjacent to both light and heavy chain immunoglobulin gene segments."

Electrical stimulation of the brain was used to move the eyes of monkeys just before saccades to visual targets. Despite the stimulation-induced perturbation, saccades brought gaze to the target locations. This compensation indicates that saccades are coded to direct the eyes to a certain position in the orbit (or in space)."

The mechanism of biosynthesis of this key intermediate has now been characterised in detail. Some of the information thereby obtained is also of use in the investigation of human diseases such as the porphyrias."
https://openalex.org/W1977221546,"Changes in γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA) occurring in the presence and in the absence of GABA-containing nerve terminals were estimated in rats in which the dense GABA projection to the substantia nigra was surgically destroyed on one side of the brain. The net increase in GABA of the denervated nigra was compared with that of the intact nigra at various times after a single injection of γ-vinyl-GABA, which irreversibly inhibits GABA transaminase. Total GABA reached a maximum within 12 hours, but the GABA pool associated with nerve terminals did not increase until 36 hours and peaked at 60 hours. The onset and peak of anticonvulsant activity against maximal electroshock seizures directly paralleled the time course for the increase in GABA in nerve terminals, but was not positively correlated with that independent of the terminals. This result supports the concept that elevating GABA in nerve terminals facilitates GABA-mediated synaptic transmission and predicts anticonvulsant activity."
https://openalex.org/W1669371681,"Swiss mouse 3T3 fibroblasts were grown in tissue culture, fixed with lysine-paraformaldehyde-periodate solutions containing 0 to 0.1% Tween 20, and then stained for cyclooxygenase antigenicity using rabbit anti-cyclooxygenase IgG in the peroxidase anti-peroxidase procedure. When examined by light microscopy, those cells fixed in the presence of 0.03 to 0.1% Tween 20 exhibited staining throughout the cytoplasm and around the nucleus but not on the cell surface. No staining occurred when either preimmune IgG or anti-cyclooxygenase IgG adsorbed with purified enzyme was substituted for the immune IgG. Electron microscopic examination of cells treated with fixative containing 0.05% Tween 20 and then stained for cyclooxygenase antigenicity revealed electron-dense deposits on the endoplasmic reticulum and nuclear membrane but not the mitochondrial or plasma membranes. No staining was seen in cells treated with control sera. Agents such as angiotensin II, bradykinin, antidiuretic hormone, and thrombin interact, apparently with the 3T3 cell surface to cause a release of arachidonic acid and prostaglandin E2 formation (Pong, S.S., Hong, S. L., and Levine, L. (1977) J. Biol. Chem. 252, 1408-1413). Our results establish that conversion of arachidonic acid to the prostaglandin endoperoxide precursor of PGE2 actually takes place on the endoplasmic reticulum and the nuclear envelope."

https://openalex.org/W2082681689,"Immunomicrospheres are specially designed microscopic particles that have antibodies or similar molecules chemically bound to their surfaces. The antibody-coated microspheres react in a highly specific way with target cells, viruses, or other antigenic agents. Immunomicropheres may be synthesized so that they incorporate compounds that are highly radioactive, intensely fluorescent, magnetic, electron opaque, highly colored, or pharmacologically active. These various types of microspheres may be coated with pure, highly specific monoclonal antibodies obtained by the new hybridoma cell cloning techniques or with conventional antibody preparations. Some of the many present and potential applications for these new reagents are (i) new types of radioimmune or immunofluorescent assays, (ii) improved fluorescence microscopy, (iii) separation of cells on the basis of the fluorescent, electrophoretic, or magnetic properties of bound immunomicrospheres, (iv) markers for use in several types of electron or standard light microscopy, and (v) delivery of lethal compounds to specific undesirable living cells. The combination of the various new types of synthetic microspheres and the newly available homogeneous antibodies offers new opportunities in research, diagnosis, and therapy."
https://openalex.org/W2052636744,"cDNA clones complementary to poly(A)-containing RNA from ovarian follicle cells of Drosophila have been prepared. On the basis of restriction mapping and cross hybridization tests, 22 such clones were found to comprise four classes (group I–group IV). Filter-bound DNA from clones in each group hybridized, under stringent conditions, with a single size class of ovarian poly(A)-containing RNA. The mobilities of these RNAs on gels corresponded to those of putative chorion messenger RNAs (Spradling and Mahowald 1979). Translation of the RNAs in vitro yielded proteins with apparent molecular weights 1000–3000 daltons greater than those of mature chorion proteins isolated from purified eggshells. When a membrane fraction from dog pancreas was included in the in vitro translation reaction, the mobilities of the products were indistinguishable from those of major chorion proteins in three cases: c38 (group I), c36 (group II) and c18 (group III). The 16K product of hybrid-selected RNA from group IV clones could not be associated unambiguously with a specific chorion protein. Hybridization of cloned cDNAs to restriction digests of DNA prepared from embryonic nuclei was consistent with the presence of one (c38 and c36) or several (c18) copies of these genes per haploid genome. Hybridization in situ of RNA transcripts from the clones to polytene chromosomes demonstrated that the genes for these four proteins are clustered at two sites. In agreement with previous results (Spradling, Waring and Mahowald 1979), both c36 and c38 are coded at 7E11-7F1-2 on the X chromosome. Group III and group IV clones were both localized at a site on the third chromosome (66D15)."
https://openalex.org/W1500360994,"3-Hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase from rat liver microsomes has been purified to apparent homogeneity with recoveries of approximately 50%. The enzyme obtained from rats fed a diet supplemented with cholestyramine had specific activities of approximately 21,500 nmol of NADPH oxidized/min/mg of protein. After amino acid analysis a specific activity of 31,000 nmol of NADPH oxidized/min/mg of amino acyl mass was obtained. The s20,w for HMG-CoA reductase was 6.14 S and the Stokes radius was .39 nm. The molecular weight of the enzyme was 104,000 and the enzyme subunit after sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis was 52,000. Antibodies prepared against the homogeneous enzyme specifically precipitated HMG-CoA reductase from crude and pure fractions of the enzyme. Incubation of rat hepatocytes for 3 h in the presence of lecithin dispersions, compactin, or rat serum resulted in significant increases in the specific activity of the microsomal bound reductase. Immunotitrations indicated that in all cases these increases were associated with an activated form of the reductase. However activation of the enzyme accounted for only a small percentage of the total increase in enzyme activity; the vast majority of the increase was apparently due to an increase in the number of enzyme molecules. In contrast, when hepatocytes were incubated with mevalonolactone the lower enzyme activity which resulted was primarily due to inactivation of the enzyme with little change in the number of enzyme molecules. Immunotitrations of microsomes obtained from rats killed at the nadir or peak of the diurnal rhythm of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA reductase indicated that the rhythm results both from enzyme activation and an increased number of reductase molecules."
https://openalex.org/W1507435959,"Several fluorinated derivatives of p-hydroxybenzoate were synthesized and examined as substrates in the reaction catalyzed by p-hydroxybenzoate hydroxylase. All the derivatives tested served as substrates, undergoing tightly coupled hydroxylation by molecular oxygen. Hydroxylation of the difluoro and tetrafluoro derivatives liberated stoichiometric amounts of fluoride. Little or no fluoride was released with monofluoro substrates. The defluorination caused higher consumption of NADPH with an overall NADPH to oxygen ratio of 2, in contrast to the ratio of 1 with the physiological substrate and with the monofluoro derivatives. Evidence was obtained strongly suggestive of a quinonoid species as the primary product formed upon oxygenative defluorination. The additional equivalent of NADPH consumed upon fluoride elimination is presumably used in a nonenzymatic reaction with the quinonoid intermediate, resulting in the observed dihydroxy product. Stopped flow studies of the reductive and oxidative half-reactions with tetrafluoro-p hydroxybenzoate substrate were examined. The oxygen half-reaction was analogous to that with p-hydroxybenzoate involving two transient oxygenated flavin intermediates. The decay of the first intermediate, a C(4a)-peroxyflavin, results in rupture of the oxygen-oxygen bond and is rate-determining in overall catalysis. This is in contrast to the reaction with the normal substrate, presumably due to a deactivating effect of the fluorine substituents. The above results are consistent with an oxenoid mechanism of oxygen attack."

https://openalex.org/W60602641,"The effect of Ca2+ on guinea pig bra in adenylate cyclase has been studied using metal buffers to regulate the free Ca2+ concentration. Particulate fractions prepared in the presence of CaZ+ (to bind all of the available calmodulin to all of the available binding sites) exhibited a biphasic response to Ca2+. The first was a 2fold stimulation of basal cyclase activity (half-maximal = 0.08 p ~ ) . At higher [Ca2+], the cyclase was inhibited to -80 to 90% of basal (half-maximal inhibition = 0.3 p ~ ) . Particulate fractions prepared by exhaustive washing with EDTA and ethylene glycol bis(P-aminoethyl ether)N,N,iV’,iV’-tetraacetic acid (EGTA) (in an att empt to deplete the membranes of calmodulin) exhibited no stimulation of adenylate cyclase by Ca2+ but did show the Ca2+-dependent inhibitory phase (halfmaximal inhibition = 0.5 p ~ ) . The calmodulin content of this preparation (EGTA-membranes) was 0.24 pg/mg of protein. The activation phase could be restored to EGTA-membranes by addition of calmodulin. The CaZ+ dependence of calmodulin-dependent phosphodiesterase exhibited a half-maximal activation at [Ca”] = 0.3 p ~ , similar to the half-maximal inhibition of cyclase in the two preparations. Likewise, 51.2’ activation of phosphodiesterase (half-maximal stimulation = 0.1 mM) occurred over the same [SI-*’] range as did half-maximal inhibition of cyclase (0.3 mM) in EGTAand Ca-membranes. The Ca2+ and Sr2+ dependence of calmodulin tyrosine fluorescence (an indirect measure of Ca2+ and Sr2+ binding) were essentially the same as the Ca2+ and Sr2+ dependence of phosphodiesterase activation and the inhibition of the cyclase. These results suggest that the Ca2+ dependent inhibition of adenylate cyclase may be mediated either by calmodulin or by a metal binding site which has binding properties similar to calmodulin. Thus, our results show that the re is an inverse relationship between adenylate cyclase activity and phosphodiesterase activity and suggest that intracellular calcium may mediate a coordinated regulation of the rates of synthesis and degradation of cyclic nucleotides."
https://openalex.org/W198026508,"Vaccinia virus DNA-dependent RNA polymerase has been solubilized from purified virions and purified over 2500-fold by chromatography on DEAE-cellulose and phosphocellulose with a 64% yield. RNA synthesis catalyzed by the purified enzyme requires the presence of a DNA template, a divalent cation (Mn2’), and the four ribonucleoside triphosphates. The polymerase activity is inhibited by actinomycin, by monovalent salt concentrations in excess of 0.1 M, by N-ethylmaleimide, and by pyrophosphate, yet is insensitive to rifampicin and to a-amanitin. Single-stranded DNAs are the most effective templates for the vaccinia RNA polymerase. The enzyme is inactive with duplex DNAs, including vaccinia DNA. Superhelical DNAs do serve as template for vaccinia polymerase, yet their template activity is abolished by relaxation of the DNA by DNA topoisomerase. The binding of RNA polymerase to DNA is also most effective with single-stranded DNAs; duplex DNAs are inert. The binding of polymerase to superhelical DNAs may be eliminated by nicking-closing enzyme. The RNA product synthesized in the presence of single-stranded DNA is of large size (23 S), while RNA made in the presence of superhelical DNAs is very small (<4 S), suggesting that the polymerase binds to and transcribes short single-stranded regions present in superhelical DNAs. Although seemingly incapable of displacing and reading through DNA duplex structures, the vaccinia polymerase is capable of transcribing through an RNA:DNA hybrid with concomitant displacement of the RNA strand."
https://openalex.org/W2074015952,"Abstract The arrangement and the nucleotide sequences of the tRNA genes in a 9.3 kb fragment of Drosophila DNA have been determined. This fragment, cloned in Col E1 to form the plasmid pCIT12 (Yen et al. 1977), contains eight tRNA genes. These are irregularly spaced within the DNA and encode a single tRNA 2 Arg , three tRNA Asn , one tRNA IIe and three tRNA 2 Lys . Each DNA strand contains the coding sequences for several tRNA genes, and the transcription direction differs for the various genes of the same isoacceptor. We propose that the inverted repeat secondary structure features observed by electron microscopy in the single-stranded DNA (Yen et al. 1977) are formed by tRNA genes. This finding explains the difficulty in detecting all the tRNA genes by hybridization of DNA with radioactive tRNA. These Drosophila tRNA genes do not contain intervening sequences; nor do they encode C-C-A, the 3′ terminal of mature tRNA. Computer analysis of the DNA sequences revealed a conserved undecanucleotide found only in the 5′ flanking regions of the three tRNA Lys genes; no common to all tRNA gene regions in pCIT12 was detected. pCIT12 did not contain any homology to the consensus sequence found in the 5′ flanking regions of Xenopus 5S genes (Korn and Brown 1978) or to the transcription control region found within those genes (Sakonju, Begenhagen and Brown 1980)."
https://openalex.org/W1605691134,"To further define its properties in solution, the course of denaturation of apolipoprotein A-I (apo-A-I) was studied as a function of various concentrations of guanidine hydrochloride (GdmCl) using the techniques of circular dichroism, ultraviolet difference spectroscopy, analytical ultracentrifugation, viscometry, and densitometry. At low molarities of GdmCl (0 to 0.4 M), apoA-I exhibited anomalous ellipticity changes which were dependent upon apo-A-I concentration; from ultracentrifugal studies, these changes were interpreted as related to the dissociation of protein oligomers into a new equilibrium attended by a preferential interaction with GdmCl (0.07 g/g of apo-A-I and an increase in molar volume, 197 ml). On the other hand, the frictional (1.68) and axial (5.7) ratios were similar to those in the native state. At molarities of GdmCl between 0.4 M and 6 M, apo-A-I dissociated into monomers by a cooperative denaturation process which was independent of protein concentration: both dissociation and denaturation were thermodynamically reversible with an apparent free energy of stabilization, = 3.70 kcal/mol. Between 2 and 6 M GdmC1, changes in the conformation, intrinsic viscosity, and volume of apo-A-I were noted as assessed by spectroscopic, viscometric, and partial specific volume measurements. These changes appeared related to the number of moles of GdmCl bound to apo-A-I (at 2 M GdmC1, 63 mol; at 6 M, 181 mol)."

The enzyme catalyzing this polymer-forming reaction is membrane-bound. The majority of the product is water-soluble, is excluded from Sepharose 6B, and, after longer incubations, changes to a form that co-precipitates with protein upon exposure to a denaturing agent. These properties are shared by the polyglycerol phosphate-containing membrane lipoteichoic acid isolated from whole cells of S. faecium. However, unlike the lipoteichoic acid generated in vivo, the glycerol phosphate polymer portion of the product synthesized in vitro is not substituted and, therefore, is considered a nascent lipoteichoic acid intermediate."
https://openalex.org/W1584813485,"The methyl carbon of ribothymidine in Loop IV of the tRNA of Streptococcus faecalis, Bacillus subtilis, and some other microorganisms is derived directly from 5,10-methylenetetrahydrofolate, not S-adenosylmethionine. The pure enzyme from S. faecalis also requires FADH2. We have obtained evidence that tetrahydrofolate is a product of the reaction and demonstrated that label from [5-3H]5-deazaFMNH2 is incorporated into the methyl moiety of ribothymidine. These data indicate that the enzyme uses methylenetetrahydrofolate solely as a 1-carbon donor and employs FADH2 as a reducing agent in vitro according to the following reaction: tRNA(U psi C) + CH2 = THF + FADH2 leads to tRNA(T psi C) + THF + FAD."

(1976) Biochemistry 15, 3039-3045) has been studied. RNA molecules are both initiated and elongated in vitro. The RNA transcripts have been characterized as to their size, nuclease sensitivity, 5'-terminal oligonucleotides, and coding locus on the chloroplast genome. RNA labeled in vitro at the 5' end with [gamma-32P]ATP was digested with RNase T1, RNase A, and S1 nuclease. The resulting 5'-gamma-32P-oligonucleotides were fractionated by gel electrophoresis. In each case, one or two discrete products were obtained, consistent with initiation in vitro only at defined loci. RNA labeled in vitro with [alpha-32P]ATP or CTP has been hybridized to Southern (Southern, E.M. (1975) J. Mol. Biol. 98, 503-517) transfers of restriction endonuclease fragments of chloroplast DNA. The most abundant in vitro transcripts hybridize to chloroplast DNA fragments coding for 23 S, 16 S, and 5 S rRNAs. Only the coding strands of the rRNA genes are transcribed. Non-rDNA sequences of chloroplast DNA are also selectively transcribed but at much lower levels. The transcriptionally active chromosome has proved to be an ideal biochemical preparation for the study of selective transcription of cell organelle DNA."

https://openalex.org/W1560115230,"Pure phosphoglycerate kinase from and rat muscle shows substantial differences in properties. Compared to the young enzyme, phosphoglycerate kinase isolated from animals possesses a greater stability to heat and storage, a slower reacting -SH group, an altered UV spectrum, and requires more antiserum prepared to young enzyme for 50% inactivation. Km and specific activity are unchanged. Immunotitration experiments show evidence for an age-related alteration of the enzyme in liver and brain, but not in kidney, lung, or heart. Loss of NH2- or COOH-terminal amino acids is not responsible for the observed differences in the properties of young and old muscle phosphoglycerate kinase. Both forms of the enzyme contain a blocked (presumably acylated) NH2-terminal residue and the sequence of the three COOH-terminal residues (Ala-Val-Leu-COOH) is identical. Moreover, isoelectric focusing of the two enzyme forms of both acrylamide gels and in a sucrose gradient failed to detect evidence of deamidation or other charge-altering differences. We conclude that, like enolase from aged nematodes, muscle phosphoglycerate kinase becomes altered in conformation in rats."

Contrast sensitivity is depressed relative to that of the adult for all spatial frequencies during the early postnatal weeks. Absolute sensitivity to frequencies below 5 cycles per degree approaches adult levels by 20 weeks after birth, whereas sensitivity to fine spatial detail continues to develop through 28 weeks.

Following ammonium sulfate fractionation, the material precipitating between 35 and 60% saturation was subjected to a series of affinity chromatography steps on matrices containing immobilized concanavalin A, heparan sulfate, O-desulfated heparin, and Cibacron blue, respectively. Epimerase purified by this procedure yielded two major components on sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The purified enzyme had approximately the same Kav as bovine serum albumin when chromatographed on Sepharose 6B. The activity of the purified enzyme was increased 50-fold by addition of the fraction which was not adsorbed to concanavalin A-Sepharose. The stimulating factor is likely to be a protein since it was nondialyzable, heat labile, and lost activity on digestion with trypsin."

Three different affinity ligands immobilized on Sepharose (3-amino pyridine adenine dinucleotide, glucosamine, and 8-(6-aminohexyl)-amino-ATP) were employed during different stages of enzyme purification. Antisera against purified Hex A and Hex C were raised in rabbits. Hex A, the major form in adults, and Hex B, the predominant form in larvae, showed complete immunological identity by double immunodiffusion and enzyme immunoinactivation studies. No cross-reactivity was observed between the antiserum to Hex A and Hex C or between the antiserum to Hex C and Hex A. By gel filtration chromatography and sodium dodecyl sulfate-acrylamide gel electrophoresis, all of the Drosophila hexokinases were shown to be monomers of molecular weights ranging from 40,000 to 50,000. Multiple forms of Drosophila hexokinase were studied extensively with respect to their biochemical properties including Michaelis constants, substrate and coenzyme specificities, pH-dependent activity, and thermal stability. Consistent with previous genetic evidence, the results of our studies also suggest that Hex A and Hex B (with subforms B1 and B2) are products of a single structural gene but are modified post-translationally, whereas the allelic forms of Hex C (C1 and C2) are derived from a different structural gene from that of Hex A and Hex B."
https://openalex.org/W1539158386,"Abstract 5-Nitro-2'-deoxyuridylate (NO2dUMP) is a potent mechanism-based inhibitor of dTMP synthetase. After formation of a reversible enzymeinhibitor complex, there is a rapid first order loss of enzyme activity which can be protected against by the nucleotide substrate dUMP. From studies of model chemical counterparts and the NO2dUMPdTMP synthetase complex, it has been demonstrated that a covalent bond is formed between a nucleophile of the enzyme and carbon 6 of NO2dUMP. The covalent NO2dUMPenzyme complex is sufficiently stable to permit isolation on nitrocellulose membranes, and dissociates to give unchanged NO2-dUMP with a first order rate constant of 8.9 x 10(-3) min-1. Dissociation of the complex formed with [6-3H]NO2dUMP shows a large alpha-secondary isotope effect of 19%, verifying that within the covalent complex, carbon 6 of the heterocycle is sp3-hybridized. The spectral changes which accompany formation of the NO2dUMPenzyme complex support the structural assignment and, when used to tritrate the binding sites, demonstrate that 2 mol of NO2dUMP are bound/mol of dimeric enzyme. The interaction of NO2dUMP with dTMP synthetase is quite different than that of other mechanism-based inhibitors such as 5-fluoro-2'-deoxyuridylate in that it neither requires nor is facilitated by the concomitant interaction of the folate cofactor, 5,10-CH2-H4folate, and that the covalent complex formed is unstable to protein denaturants."
https://openalex.org/W1562687679,"113Cd NMR of the 113Cd(II)-substituted zinc metalloenzymes, human and bovine erythrocyte carbonic anhydrases, is reported. The high activity isozymes, human erythrocyte carbonic anhydrase, isozyme C (HCAC) and bovine erythrocyte carbonic anhydrase, isozyme B (BCAB), are characterized by relatively narrow 113Cd resonances around 220 ppm to lowfield of Cd(ClO4)2. These resonances are relatively invariant between pH 5.5 and 10. In contrast, the low activity isozyme, human carbonic anhydrase B (HCAB), shows no detectable or extremely broad 113Cd resonance at all pH values in the absence of anion inhibitors. Binding of halide anions, Cl- or I-, to the active site cadmium ion in HCAB results in the appearance of a 113Cd resonance at 230 to 240 ppm. The initial absence of resonance in 113Cd(II)HCAB appears to reflect an intermediate rate (10^3 to 10^4 s-1) of chemical exchange of ligands at the active site 113Cd ion. This exchange may modulate the chemical shift by ~100 ppm. The exchanging ligand is most likely coordinated solvent. Exchange is interrupted by substitution of the monodentate anions which form complexes of long lifetimes. In contrast, the narrow resonance observed for the high activity isozymes appears to reflect an initially rapid (>10^5 s-1) solvent ligand exchange rate, a conclusion supported by the temperature dependence of the linewidth of the 113Cd resonance in BCAB. The extreme sensitivity of the active site 113Cd ion's chemical shift to minor changes in the coordination sphere is shown by the isolation of the bovine isozyme A for which the resonance of the 113Cd derivative undergoes an 88-ppm shift on I- binding. These findings are discussed as they relate to the currently proposed mechanisms of action for carbonic anhydrases."
https://openalex.org/W1488847709,"We introduce two new, rapid procedures. One is specifically designed for isolating alpha-actinin from skeletal and the other for isolating alpha-actinin from smooth muscle. Approximately 20 mg of greater than 95% pure alpha-actinin can be obtained/100 g of ground chicken pectoral muscle in just 4 days. The smooth muscle protocol yields 2.7 mg of greater than 99% pure alpha-actinin/100 g of ground gizzard after just 5 days. Differences in protein contaminants and in the extractability of alpha-actinin necessitated the development of separate isolation procedures for the two muscle types. Antibody prepared against the purified gizzard alpha-actinin reacted with alpha-actinin from skeletal, cardiac, and smooth muscle in immunodiffusion. Anti-alpha-actinin reacted only with alpha-actinin from crude extracts of skeletal and smooth muscle on Staph A gels. Anti-alpha-actinin stained Z-bands from skeletal muscle in indirect immunofluorescence microscopy and stress fibers from baby hamster kidney fibroblasts and mouse mammary epithelial cells in the characteristic punctate pattern observed by other workers (Lazarides, E., and Burridge, K.

In this study the relationship between this selective stimulation of phospholipid fatty acid turnover and changes in calcium uptake, cellular potassium content, and cell volume has been examined by 1) preventing the calcium-dependent loss of potassium without abolishing calcium uptake and 2) altering cellular potassium content and cell volume without increasing net uptake of calcium by utilizing the monovalent cation inonophore nigericin or increasing the osmolarity of the buffer. It has been shown that treatment of erythrocytes with A23187, nigericin, or hypertonic buffer results in a selective stimulation of fatty acid incorporation into PE. These results suggest that a mechanical or conformational change in the membrane is associated with a selective stimulation of fatty acid turnover in phosphatidylethanolamine."
https://openalex.org/W1510978460,"In Escherichia coli, amino acid starvation triggers the rapid synthesis of two guanosine polyphosphates, pppGpp and ppGpp (the 3'-pyrophosphates of GTP and GDP, respectively). Determination of the turnover rate of the ppGpp pool indicated that during serine deprivation, as opposed to other amino acid starvations, the rate of ppGpp degradation is dramatically decreased. This results in a slow but significant accumulation of this regulatory nucleotide in a relA mutant during serine starvation. Similar ppGpp accumulation can be seen during serine starvation in different serine auxotrophic mutants carrying different relA alleles. On the other hand, no ppGpp accumulation is induced in various relaxed strains by serine hydroxamate treatment."

https://openalex.org/W2163940340,"A protein that has been isolated from Limulus polyphemus amoebocyte membranes binds endotoxin. The protein was purified by two independent methods, organic solvent extraction and affinity chromatography, both followed by gel filtration. Immunologic studies confirm that the protein is a component of amoebocyte membranes. Although without enzymatic activity, the binding protein enhances Limulus lysate gelation. As a membrane-associated endotoxin binding protein, it may be involved in Limulus lysate coagulation, which is initiated by minute amounts of Gram-negative bacterial endotoxin. The protein has an apparent molecular weight of 80,000."
https://openalex.org/W1483059617,"Analysis of the binding of thiamin pyrophosphate to the 2-oxoglutarate dehydrogenaselipoate succinyltransferase multienzyme complex using pre-steady state kinetic methods revealed that the presence of 2-oxoglutarate is not necessary for binding, although it does stabilize the complex by slowing the rate of dissociation of the holoenzyme. The rate of binding of thiamin-PPi to the enzyme and the subsequent enzyme activation are not limited by a reaction at C-2 of the thiazolium ring of thiamin-PPi since no kinetic isotope effect is observed when 2-D-thiamin-PPi is substituted for the protonated cofactor. The presence of 5'-AMP, which activates the reaction producing both a V and a Km response, causes a significant increase in kon for thiamin-PPi. The AMP analog 1,N6-ethenoadenosine-5'-monophosphate (epsilon-AMP) also activates the reaction, but shows only a K effect, with no influence on V. This effector reduces Kd for the thiamin-PPi2-oxoglutarate dehydrogenase complex by increasing kon. The change in kon for thiamin-PPi in response to changes in hydrogen ion concentration shows pK values which are unaffected by the addition of AMP, in this respect resembling the steady state kinetic response of V/Km and differing from the pH profile of V. The dissociation constant of holoenzyme is relatively insensitive to pH over the range pH 6 to 9, but in the presence of AMP the Kd, which is decreased in the range from pH 7 to 8, increases sharply at higher or lower pH values."

https://openalex.org/W1598427167,"This chapter describes the isolation and purification of the heptaprenylpyrophosphate synthetase from Bacillus subtilis. Heptaprenylpyrophosphate synthetase is obtained from Bacillus subtilis, which produces menaquinone. This enzyme catalyzes the synthesis of all-trans-heptaprenyl pyrophosphate by successive condensation of four molecules of isopentenyl pyrophosphate with farnesyl pyrophosphate as a primer all-trans-Geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate can also be a primer, but neither dimethylallyl nor geranyl pyrophosphate is accepted as a primer. This enzyme consists of two essential protein components, which are separated from each other by ion exchange chromatography. Principle and procedure of the assay method are discussed in the chapter. Heptaprenylpyrophosphate synthetase resembles geranylgeranylpyrophosphate synthetase in that neither enzyme is susceptible to monovalent cations or detergents. These properties suggest that the former two operate in intracellular environments closely related to each other, probably being peripherally associated with membrane so that undecaprenyi pyrophosphate of cis, trans-mixed stereochemistry can be efficiently synthesized, and that the latter two cooperate in the cytosol to produce alltrans-C35-prenyl pyrophosphate, which is the precursor for the side chain of menaquinone occurring in B. subtilis."
https://openalex.org/W1617379619,"Kinetic studies on the unfolding of pepsinogen by urea showed that changes in absorbance and potential pepsin activity followed simple first order kinetics. Changes in these variables on refolding were more complex. A large part of the absorbance was recovered within the mixing time of these experiments, whereas the appearance of activity was a slow sigmoidal function of time. The results were interpreted to show that pepsinogen can rapidly regain a globular form, but that its activatable form is produced by a slow conformational change in the folded protein. The enthalpies of activation of this change are similar to those of the cis-trans isomerization of proline residues. If the latter reaction is involved in the folding of pepsinogen, it must occur after extensive folding has already occurred."

https://openalex.org/W1495518825,"Fourteen clones were isolated in culture from a mouse myeloma, MOPC104E. All clones had kappa and lambda types of light chain mRNAs in approximately equimolar quantity as assayed by hybridization with specific complementary DNA (cDNA). However, the myeloma produces and secretes only lambda-type light chain protein. Both kappa- and lambda-type mRNAs in these clones were indistinguishable from kappa- and lambda-type mRNAs of other myelomas with respect to (a) adsorption to oligo-(dT) cellulose, (b) molecular size (12.6 S), and (c) thermal stability of the hybrids formed with corresponding cDNA. The kappa chain mRNA of MOPC104E cells, however, was translated very inefficiently both in vivo and in vitro, whereas the lambda chain mRNA was translated efficiently. These results indicate that each cell of MOPC104E myeloma synthesizes a crippled kappa chain mRNA in addition to a normal lambda chain mRNA."
https://openalex.org/W1576089159,"Purine-nucleoside phosphorylase deficiency in humans is associated with a severe defect in thymus-derived lymphocyte function. We have used the consanguineous parents of one purine-nucleoside phosphorylase-deficient patient as a source of mutant protein since the enzyme is totally lacking in the homozygous deficient child. When analyzed by denaturing two-dimensional gel electrophoresis, purified erythrocytic purine-nucleoside phosphorylase from normal individuals has four major and two minor subunits of identical molecular weight (29,700) but different isoelectric points. Similar analysis of phosphorylase purified from the parents of the purine-nucleoside phosphorylase-deficient child reveals the presence of two additional, more alkaline subunits with molecular weights significantly greater (approximately 500) than the normal subunits. Comparison of the two-dimensional thin layer peptide maps of the complete tryptic hydrolysates of the 125I-labeled subunits demonstrates that all eight subunits have a majority of their peptides in common, and thus, the structures of all are closely related. Peptide maps of the major subunits of normal purine-nucleoside phosphorylase are all identical with each other but different in several peptides from those of the normal minor subunits. Peptide maps of the mutant subunits differ from those of the normal major subunits only in the loss of one normal peptide and the presence of two new peptides. Tryptic peptide analysis of overlapping partial proteolytic cleavage fragments of the mutant and normal major subunits of purine-nucleoside phosphorylase has been used to determine the order of the iodinated tryptic peptides in the molecule. These results indicate that the mutant subunits are altered at an internal position rather than at the termini of the protein. A likely explanation of this internal alteration is an insertion of several tandem amino acid residues, perhaps resulting from an unequal genetic crossover or an intron processing abnormality."
