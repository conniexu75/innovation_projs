https://openalex.org/W2019696120,"TRPV4 and the cellular cytoskeleton have each been reported to influence cellular mechanosensitive processes as well as the development of mechanical hyperalgesia. If and how TRPV4 interacts with the microtubule and actin cytoskeleton at a molecular and functional level is not known.We investigated the interaction of TRPV4 with cytoskeletal components biochemically, cell biologically by observing morphological changes of DRG-neurons and DRG-neuron-derived F-11 cells, as well as functionally with calcium imaging. We find that TRPV4 physically interacts with tubulin, actin and neurofilament proteins as well as the nociceptive molecules PKCepsilon and CamKII. The C-terminus of TRPV4 is sufficient for the direct interaction with tubulin and actin, both with their soluble and their polymeric forms. Actin and tubulin compete for binding. The interaction with TRPV4 stabilizes microtubules even under depolymerizing conditions in vitro. Accordingly, in cellular systems TRPV4 colocalizes with actin and microtubules enriched structures at submembranous regions. Both expression and activation of TRPV4 induces striking morphological changes affecting lamellipodial, filopodial, growth cone, and neurite structures in non-neuronal cells, in DRG-neuron derived F11 cells, and also in IB4-positive DRG neurons. The functional interaction of TRPV4 and the cytoskeleton is mutual as Taxol, a microtubule stabilizer, reduces the Ca2+-influx via TRPV4.TRPV4 acts as a regulator for both, the microtubule and the actin. In turn, we describe that microtubule dynamics are an important regulator of TRPV4 activity. TRPV4 forms a supra-molecular complex containing cytoskeletal proteins and regulatory kinases. Thereby it can integrate signaling of various intracellular second messengers and signaling cascades, as well as cytoskeletal dynamics. This study points out the existence of cross-talks between non-selective cation channels and cytoskeleton at multiple levels. These cross talks may help us to understand the molecular basis of the Taxol-induced neuropathic pain development commonly observed in cancer patients."
https://openalex.org/W2164279718,"Health authorities in several countries recently recommended the expansion of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) antibody testing, including the use of rapid tests. Several HIV rapid tests are now licensed in Europe but their sensitivity on total blood and/or oral fluid in routine healthcare settings is not known.200 adults with documented HIV-1 (n=194) or HIV-2 infection (n=6) were prospectively screened with five HIV rapid tests using either oral fluid (OF) or finger-stick whole blood (FSB). The OraQuick Advance rapid HIV1/2 was first applied to OF and then to FSB, while the other tests were applied to FSB, in the following order: Vikia HIV 1/2, Determine HIV 1-2, Determine HIV-1/2 Ag/Ab Combo and INSTI HIV-1/HIV-2. Tests negative on FSB were repeated on paired serum samples. Twenty randomly selected HIV-seronegative subjects served as controls, and the results were read blindly. Most patients had HIV-1 subtype B infection (63.3%) and most were on antiretroviral therapy (68.5%). Sensitivity was 86.5%, 94.5%, 98.5%, 94.9%, 95.8% and 99% respectively, with OraQuick OF, OraQuick FSB, Vikia, Determine, Determine Ag/Ab Combo and INSTI (p<0.0001). OraQuick was less sensitive on OF than on FSB (p=0.008). Among the six patients with three or more negative tests, two had recent HIV infection and four patients on antiretroviral therapy had undetectable plasma viral load. When patients positive in all the tests were compared with patients who had at least one negative test, only a plasma HIV RNA level<200 cp/ml was significantly associated with a false-negative result (p=0.009). When the 33 rapid tests negative on FSB were repeated on serum, all but six (5 negative with OraQuick, 1 with INSTI) were positive. The sensitivity of OraQuick, Determine and Determine Ag/Ab Combo was significantly better on serum than on FSB (97.5%, p=0.04; 100%, p=0.004; and 100%, p=0.02, respectively).When evaluated in a healthcare setting, rapid HIV tests were less sensitive on oral fluid than on finger-stick whole blood and less sensitive on finger-stick whole blood than on serum."
https://openalex.org/W1963922085,"The response to hypoxia in tissues is regulated by the heterodimeric transcription factor Hypoxia Inducible Factor-1 (HIF-1).We have created a strain of mice with inducible cardiomyocyte-specific expression of a mutated, oxygen-stable, form of HIF-1alpha. Cardiac function steadily decreased with transgene expression, but recovered after the transgene was turned off. Using long-oligo microarrays, we identified 162 transcripts more than 3-fold dysregulated in these hearts after transgene expression. Among the down-regulated genes the transcript for SERCA was reduced 46% and the protein 92%. This led us to an evaluation of calcium flux that showed diminished reuptake of cytoplasmic calcium in myocytes from these hearts, suggesting a mechanism for cardiac dysfunction.These results provide a deeper understanding of transcriptional activity of HIF in the heart, and show that enhanced HIF-1 activity is sufficient to cause contractile dysfunction in the adult heart. HIF is stabilized in the myocardium of patients with ischemic cardiomyopathy, and our results suggest that HIF could be contributing directly to the contractile dysfunction in this disease."
https://openalex.org/W2104584247,"Background The humanoid robot WE4-RII was designed to express human emotions in order to improve human-robot interaction. We can read the emotions depicted in its gestures, yet might utilize different neural processes than those used for reading the emotions in human agents. Methodology Here, fMRI was used to assess how brain areas activated by the perception of human basic emotions (facial expression of Anger, Joy, Disgust) and silent speech respond to a humanoid robot impersonating the same emotions, while participants were instructed to attend either to the emotion or to the motion depicted. Principal Findings Increased responses to robot compared to human stimuli in the occipital and posterior temporal cortices suggest additional visual processing when perceiving a mechanical anthropomorphic agent. In contrast, activity in cortical areas endowed with mirror properties, like left Broca's area for the perception of speech, and in the processing of emotions like the left anterior insula for the perception of disgust and the orbitofrontal cortex for the perception of anger, is reduced for robot stimuli, suggesting lesser resonance with the mechanical agent. Finally, instructions to explicitly attend to the emotion significantly increased response to robot, but not human facial expressions in the anterior part of the left inferior frontal gyrus, a neural marker of motor resonance. Conclusions Motor resonance towards a humanoid robot, but not a human, display of facial emotion is increased when attention is directed towards judging emotions. Significance Artificial agents can be used to assess how factors like anthropomorphism affect neural response to the perception of human actions."
https://openalex.org/W1975953151,"Background In Nigeria, hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection has reached hyperendemic levels and its nature and origin have been described as a puzzle. In this study, we investigated the molecular epidemiology and epidemic history of HBV infection in two semi-isolated rural communities in North/Central Nigeria. It was expected that only a few, if any, HBV strains could have been introduced and effectively transmitted among these residents, reflecting limited contacts of these communities with the general population in the country. Methods and Findings Despite remoteness and isolation, ∼11% of the entire population in these communities was HBV-DNA seropositive. Analyses of the S-gene sequences obtained from 55 HBV-seropositive individuals showed the circulation of 37 distinct HBV variants. These HBV isolates belong predominantly to genotype E (HBV/E) (n = 53, 96.4%), with only 2 classified as sub-genotype A3 (HBV/A3). Phylogenetic analysis showed extensive intermixing between HBV/E variants identified in these communities and different countries in Africa. Quasispecies analysis of 22 HBV/E strains using end-point limiting-dilution real-time PCR, sequencing and median joining networks showed extensive intra-host heterogeneity and inter-host variant sharing. To investigate events that resulted in such remarkable HBV/E diversity, HBV full-size genome sequences were obtained from 47 HBV/E infected persons and P gene was subjected to Bayesian coalescent analysis. The time to the most recent common ancestor (tMRCA) for these HBV/E variants was estimated to be year 1952 (95% highest posterior density (95% HPD): 1927–1970). Using additional HBV/E sequences from other African countries, the tMRCA was estimated to be year 1948 (95% HPD: 1924–1966), indicating that HBV/E in these remote communities has a similar time of origin with multiple HBV/E variants broadly circulating in West/Central Africa. Phylogenetic analysis and statistical neutrality tests suggested rapid HBV/E population expansion. Additionally, skyline plot analysis showed an increase in the size of the HBV/E-infected population over the last ∼30–40 years. Conclusions Our data suggest a massive introduction and relatively recent HBV/E expansion in the human population in Africa. Collectively, these data show a significant shift in the HBV/E epidemic dynamics in Africa over the last century."
https://openalex.org/W1965535540,"Henipaviruses are newly emerged viruses within the Paramyxoviridae family. Their negative-strand RNA genome is packaged by the nucleoprotein (N) within α-helical nucleocapsid that recruits the polymerase complex made of the L protein and the phosphoprotein (P). To date structural data on Henipaviruses are scarce, and their N and P proteins have never been characterized so far. Using both computational and experimental approaches we herein show that Henipaviruses N and P proteins possess large intrinsically disordered regions. By combining several disorder prediction methods, we show that the N-terminal domain of P (PNT) and the C-terminal domain of N (NTAIL) are both mostly disordered, although they contain short order-prone segments. We then report the cloning, the bacterial expression, purification and characterization of Henipavirus PNT and NTAIL domains. By combining gel filtration, dynamic light scattering, circular dichroism and nuclear magnetic resonance, we show that both NTAIL and PNT belong to the premolten globule sub-family within the class of intrinsically disordered proteins. This study is the first reported experimental characterization of Henipavirus P and N proteins. The evidence that their respective N-terminal and C-terminal domains are highly disordered under native conditions is expected to be invaluable for future structural studies by helping to delineate N and P protein domains amenable to crystallization. In addition, following previous hints establishing a relationship between structural disorder and protein interactivity, the present results suggest that Henipavirus PNT and NTAIL domains could be involved in manifold protein-protein interactions."
https://openalex.org/W2040620003,"Pyrethroid insecticides have been extensively used in China and worldwide for public health pest control. Accurate resistance monitoring is essential to guide the rational use of insecticides and resistance management. Here we examined the nucleotide diversity of the para-sodium channel gene, which confers knockdown resistance (kdr) in Culex pipiens pallens mosquitoes in China. The sequence analysis of the para-sodium channel gene identified L1014F and L1014S mutations. We developed and validated allele-specific PCR and the real-time TaqMan methods for resistance diagnosis. The real-time TaqMan method is more superior to the allele-specific PCR method as evidenced by higher amplification rate and better sensitivity and specificity. Significant positive correlation between kdr allele frequency and bioassay-based resistance phenotype demonstrates that the frequency of L1014F and L1014S mutations in the kdr gene can be used as a molecular marker for deltamethrin resistance monitoring in natural Cx. pipiens pallens populations in the East China region. The laboratory selection experiment found that L1014F mutation frequency, but not L1014S mutation, responded to deltamethrin selection, suggesting that the L1014F mutation is the key mutation conferring resistance to deltamethrin. High L1014F mutation frequency detected in six populations of Cx. pipens pallens suggests high prevalence of pyrethroid resistance in Eastern China, calling for further surveys to map the resistance in China and for investigating alternative mosquito control strategies."
https://openalex.org/W1994235932,"Background Ligia isopods are widely distributed in the Pacific rocky intertidal shores from central California to central Mexico, including the Gulf of California. Yet, their biological characteristics restrict them to complete their life cycles in a very narrow range of the rocky intertidal supralittoral. Herein, we examine phylogeographic patterns of Ligia isopods from 122 localities between central California and central Mexico. We expect to find high levels of allopatric diversity. In addition, we expect the phylogeographic patterns to show signatures of past vicariant events that occurred in this geologically dynamic region. Methodology/Principal Findings We sequenced two mitochondrial genes (Cytochrome Oxidase I and 16S ribosomal DNA). We conducted Maximum Likelihood and Bayesian phylogenetic analyses. We found many divergent clades that, in general, group according to geography. Some of the most striking features of the Ligia phylogeographic pattern include: (1) deep mid-peninsular phylogeographic breaks on the Pacific and Gulf sides of Baja peninsula; (2) within the Gulf lineages, the northern peninsula is most closely related to the northern mainland, while the southern peninsula is most closely related to the central-southern mainland; and, (3) the southernmost portion of the peninsula (Cape Region) is most closely related to the southernmost portion of mainland. Conclusions/Significance Our results shed light on the phylogenetic relationships of Ligia populations in the study area. This study probably represents the finest-scale phylogeographic examination for any organism to date in this region. Presence of highly divergent lineages suggests multiple Ligia species exist in this region. The phylogeographic patterns of Ligia in the Gulf of California and Baja peninsula are incongruent with a widely accepted vicariant scenario among phylogeographers, but consistent with aspects of alternative geological hypotheses and phylo- and biogeographic patterns of several other taxa. Our findings contribute to the ongoing debate regarding the geological origin of this important biogeographic region."
https://openalex.org/W2159324009,"The collection of accurate data on adherence and sexual behaviour is crucial in microbicide (and other HIV-related) research. In the absence of a ""gold standard"" the collection of such data relies largely on participant self-reporting. After reviewing available methods, this paper describes a mixed method/triangulation model for generating more accurate data on adherence and sexual behaviour in a multi-centre vaginal microbicide clinical trial. In a companion paper some of the results from this model are presented [1].Data were collected from a random subsample of 725 women (7.7% of the trial population) using structured interviews, coital diaries, in-depth interviews, counting returned gel applicators, focus group discussions, and ethnography. The core of the model was a customised, semi-structured in-depth interview. There were two levels of triangulation: first, discrepancies between data from the questionnaires, diaries, in-depth interviews and applicator returns were identified, discussed with participants and, to a large extent, resolved; second, results from individual participants were related to more general data emerging from the focus group discussions and ethnography. A democratic and equitable collaboration between clinical trialists and qualitative social scientists facilitated the success of the model, as did the preparatory studies preceding the trial. The process revealed some of the underlying assumptions and routinised practices in ""clinical trial culture"" that are potentially detrimental to the collection of accurate data, as well as some of the shortcomings of large qualitative studies, and pointed to some potential solutions.The integration of qualitative social science and the use of mixed methods and triangulation in clinical trials are feasible, and can reveal (and resolve) inaccuracies in data on adherence and sensitive behaviours, as well as illuminating aspects of ""trial culture"" that may also affect data accuracy."
https://openalex.org/W2031205304,"The GC-rich nuclease hypersensitivity element III1 (NHE III1) of the c-MYC promoter largely controls the transcriptional activity of the c-MYC oncogene. The C-rich strand in this region can form I-motif DNA secondary structures. We determined the folding pattern of the major I-motif formed in the NHE III1, which can be formed at near-neutral pH. While we find that the I-motif formed in the four 3' consecutive runs of cytosines appears to be the most favored, our results demonstrate that the C-rich strand of the c-MYC NHE III1 exhibits a high degree of dynamic equilibration. Using a trisubstituted oligomer of this region, we determined the formation of two equilibrating loop isomers, one of which contains a flipped-out cytosine. Our results indicate that the intercalative cytosine+-cytosine base pairs are not always necessary for an intramolecular I-motif. The dynamic character of the c-MYC I-motif is intrinsic to the NHE III1 sequence and appears to provide stability to the c-MYC I-motif."
https://openalex.org/W2064776261,"If an organism's juvenile and adult life stages inhabit different environments, certain traits may need to be independently adapted to each environment. In many organisms, a move to a different environment during ontogeny is accompanied by metamorphosis. In such organisms phenotypic induction early in ontogeny can affect later phenotypes. In laboratory experiments we first investigated correlations between body morphology and the locomotor performance traits expressed in different life stages of the common frog, Rana temporaria: swimming speed and acceleration in tadpoles; and jump-distance in froglets. We then tested for correlations between these performances across life stages. We also subjected tadpoles to unchanging or decreasing water levels to explore whether decreasing water levels might induce any carry-over effects. Body morphology and performance were correlated in tadpoles; morphology and performance were correlated in froglets: hence body shape and morphology affect performance within each life stage. However, performance was decoupled across life stages, as there was no correlation between performance in tadpoles and performance in froglets. While size did not influence tadpole performance, it was correlated with performance of the metamorphosed froglets. Experiencing decreasing water levels accelerated development time, which resulted in smaller tadpoles and froglets, i.e., a carry-over effect. Interestingly, decreasing water levels positively affected the performance of tadpoles, but negatively affected froglet performance. Our results suggest that performance does not necessarily have to be correlated between life stages. However, froglet performance is size dependent and carried over from the tadpole stage, suggesting that some important size-dependent characters cannot be decoupled via metamorphosis."
https://openalex.org/W2135192677,"The Arabidopsis ABC transporter Comatose (CTS; AtABCD1) is required for uptake into the peroxisome of a wide range of substrates for β-oxidation, but it is uncertain whether CTS itself is the transporter or if the transported substrates are free acids or CoA esters. To establish a system for its biochemical analysis, CTS was expressed in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. The plant protein was correctly targeted to yeast peroxisomes, was assembled into the membrane with its nucleotide binding domains in the cytosol, and exhibited basal ATPase activity that was sensitive to aluminum fluoride and abrogated by mutation of a conserved Walker A motif lysine residue. The yeast pxa1 pxa2Δ mutant lacks the homologous peroxisomal ABC transporter and is unable to grow on oleic acid. Consistent with its exhibiting a function in yeast akin to that in the plant, CTS rescued the oleate growth phenotype of the pxa1 pxa2Δ mutant, and restored β-oxidation of fatty acids with a range of chain lengths and varying degrees of desaturation. When expressed in yeast peroxisomal membranes, the basal ATPase activity of CTS could be stimulated by fatty acyl-CoAs but not by fatty acids.

https://openalex.org/W2038435586,"Schistosomiasis is the second most widespread human parasitic disease. It is principally treated with one drug, praziquantel, that is administered to 100 million people each year; less sensitive strains of schistosomes are emerging. One of the most appealing drug targets against schistosomiasis is thioredoxin glutathione reductase (TGR). This natural chimeric enzyme is a peculiar fusion of a glutaredoxin domain with a thioredoxin selenocysteine (U)-containing reductase domain. Selenocysteine is located on a flexible C-terminal arm that is usually disordered in the available structures of the protein and is essential for the full catalytic activity of TGR. In this study, we dissect the catalytic cycle of Schistosoma mansoni TGR by structural and functional analysis of the U597C mutant. The crystallographic data presented herein include the following: the oxidized form (at 1.9 Å resolution); the NADPH- and GSH-bound forms (2.3 and 1.9 Å, respectively); and a different crystal form of the (partially) reduced enzyme (3.1 Å), showing the physiological dimer and the entire C terminus of one subunit. Whenever possible, we determined the rate constants for the interconversion between the different oxidation states of TGR by kinetic methods. By combining the crystallographic analysis with computer modeling, we were able to throw further light on the mechanism of action of S. mansoni TGR. In particular, we hereby propose the putative functionally relevant conformational change of the C terminus after the transfer of reducing equivalents from NADPH to the redox sites of the enzyme."
https://openalex.org/W2107821549,"Background Nonsense-mediated mRNA decay (NMD) is a post-transcriptional RNA surveillance process that facilitates the recognition and destruction of mRNAs bearing premature terminations codons (PTCs). Such PTC-containing (PTC+) mRNAs may arise from different processes, including erroneous processing and expression of pseudogenes, but also from more regulated events such as alternative splicing coupled NMD (AS-NMD). Thus, the NMD pathway serves both as a silencer of genomic noise and a regulator of gene expression. Given the early embryonic lethality in NMD deficient mice, uncovering the full regulatory potential of the NMD pathway in mammals will require the functional assessment of NMD in different tissues. Methodology/Principal Findings Here we use mouse genetics to address the role of UPF2, a core NMD component, in the development, function and regeneration of the liver. We find that loss of NMD during fetal liver development is incompatible with postnatal life due to failure of terminal differentiation. Moreover, deletion of Upf2 in the adult liver results in hepatosteatosis and disruption of liver homeostasis. Finally, NMD was found to be absolutely required for liver regeneration. Conclusion/Significance Collectively, our data demonstrate the critical role of the NMD pathway in liver development, function and regeneration and highlights the importance of NMD for mammalian biology."
https://openalex.org/W2109581323,"Background In 2005, the Ministry of Health in Ethiopia launched a major effort to distribute over 20 million long-lasting insecticidal nets, provide universal access to artemisinin-based combination therapy (ACTs), and train 30,000 village-based health extension workers. Methods and Findings A cross-sectional, nationally representative Malaria Indicator Survey was conducted during the malaria transmission season in 2007. Multivariate logistic regression analyses were performed to assess the effect of women's malaria knowledge on household ITN ownership and women's ITN use. In addition, we investigated the effect of mothers' malaria knowledge on their children under 5 years of age's (U5) ITN use and their access to fever treatment on behalf of their child U5. Malaria knowledge was based on a composite index about the causes, symptoms, danger signs and prevention of malaria. Approximately 67% of women (n = 5,949) and mothers of children U5 (n = 3,447) reported some knowledge of malaria. Women's knowledge of malaria was significantly associated with household ITN ownership (adjusted Odds Ratio [aOR] = 2.1; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.6–2.7) and with increased ITN use for themselves (aOR = 1.8; 95% CI 1.3–2.5). Knowledge of malaria amongst mothers of children U5 was associated with ITN use for their children U5 (aOR = 1.6; 95% CI 1.1–2.4), but not significantly associated with their children U5 seeking care for a fever. School attendance was a significant factor in women's ITN use (aOR = 2.0; 95% CI 1.1–3.9), their children U5′s ITN use (aOR = 4.4; 95% CI 1.6–12.1), and their children U5 having sought treatment for a fever (aOR = 6.5; 95% CI 1.9–22.9). Conclusions Along with mass free distribution of ITNs and universal access to ACTs, delivery of targeted malaria educational information to women could improve ITN ownership and use. Efforts to control malaria could be influenced by progress towards broader goals of improving access to education, especially for women."
https://openalex.org/W2120444833,"The PGC family of transcriptional co-activators (PGC-1α [Ppargc1a], PGC-1β [Ppargc1b], and PRC [Pprc]) coordinates the upregulation of mitochondrial biogenesis, and Ppargc1a is known to be activated in response to mitochondrial damage in sepsis. Therefore, we postulated that the PGC family is regulated by the innate immune system. We investigated whether mitochondrial biogenesis and PGC gene expression are disrupted in an established model of Staphylococcus aureus sepsis both in mice with impaired innate immune function (TLR2−/− and TLR4−/−) and in wild-type controls. We found an early up-regulation of Ppargc1a and Ppargc1b post-infection (at 6 h) in WT mice, but the expression of both genes was concordantly dysregulated in TLR2−/− mice (no increase at 6 h) and in TLR4−/− mice (amplified at 6 h). However, the third family member, PRC, was regulated differently, and its expression increased significantly at 24 h in all three mouse strains (WT, TLR2−/−, and TLR4−/−). In silico analyses showed that Ppargc1a and Ppargc1b share binding sites for microRNA mmu-mir-202-3p. Thus, miRNA-mediated post-transcriptional mRNA degradation could account for the failure to increase the expression of both genes in TLR2−/− mice. The expression of mmu-mir-202-3p was measured by real-time PCR and found to be significantly increased in TLR2−/− but not in WT or TLR4−/− mice. In addition, it was found that mir-202-3p functionally decreases Ppargc1a mRNA in vitro. Thus, both innate immune signaling through the TLRs and mir-202-3p-mediated mRNA degradation are implicated in the co-regulation of Ppargc1a and Ppargc1b during inflammation. Moreover, the identification of mir-202-3p as a potential factor for Ppargc1a and Ppargc1b repression in acute inflammation may open new avenues for mitochondrial research and, potentially, therapy."

IntroductionAutophagy is an intracellular degradation system conserved among eukaryotes from yeasts to mammals. During autophagy, double membrane structures called autophagosomes sequester a portion of the cytoplasm and fuse with the vacuole (lysosome in the case of mammalian autophagy) to deliver their inner contents into the organelle lumen (1Nakatogawa H. Suzuki K. Kamada Y. Ohsumi Y. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2009; 10: 458-467Crossref PubMed Scopus (1244) Google Scholar). As the contents of autophagosomes are indistinguishable from their surrounding cytoplasm (2Baba M. Takeshige K. Baba N. Ohsumi Y. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 124: 903-913Crossref PubMed Scopus (400) Google Scholar), autophagy has long been considered to be a nonselective catabolic pathway. Recent studies, however, have provided evidence for the selective degradation of various targets by autophagy. In autophagy-deficient neuronal cells, intracellular protein aggregates accumulate and eventually lead to neurodegeneration, suggesting that autophagy selectively degrades harmful protein aggregates (3Hara T.

(37Suzuki K. Kondo C. Morimoto M. Ohsumi Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2010; 285Google Scholar) identified Atg34, an Atg19 paralog, as an additional receptor protein for Ams1 that functions only under starvation conditions. However, the molecular mechanism of specific cargo recognition by Atg19 and Atg34 has not been clarified. Previous studies have shown that the prApe1-binding domain of Atg19 is located in the region from amino acid residues 153 to 191 that contains the predicted coiled coil motif, and the Ams1-binding domain of Atg19 is located in a region within amino acid residues 192–387 (15Shintani T. Huang W.P. Stromhaug P.E. Klionsky D.J. Dev. Cell. 2002; 3: 825-837Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar).Here, we report structural and functional analyses of Atg19 and Atg34. Ams1 binding domains (ABDs) were identified in Atg19 and Atg34 by limited proteolysis and in vitro pulldown assay. In vivo studies revealed that the Atg19 ABD is specifically required for Ams1 transport to the vacuole via the Cvt pathway. Furthermore, we determined the solution structures of the ABDs of both Atg19 and Atg34 using NMR spectroscopy. Both ABD structures consist of eight β-strands that fold into a canonical immunoglobulin fold. In vivo studies showed that a histidine residue conserved in the Atg19 and Atg34 ABDs is critical for Ams1 delivery to the vacuole. These structures provide a basis for elucidating the molecular mechanism of cargo recognition during selective autophagy. IntroductionAutophagy is an intracellular degradation system conserved among eukaryotes from yeasts to mammals. During autophagy, double membrane structures called autophagosomes sequester a portion of the cytoplasm and fuse with the vacuole (lysosome in the case of mammalian autophagy) to deliver their inner contents into the organelle lumen (1Nakatogawa H. Suzuki K. Kamada Y. Ohsumi Y. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2009; 10: 458-467Crossref PubMed Scopus (1244) Google Scholar). As the contents of autophagosomes are indistinguishable from their surrounding cytoplasm (2Baba M. Takeshige K. Baba N. Ohsumi Y. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 124: 903-913Crossref PubMed Scopus (400) Google Scholar), autophagy has long been considered to be a nonselective catabolic pathway. Recent studies, however, have provided evidence for the selective degradation of various targets by autophagy. In autophagy-deficient neuronal cells, intracellular protein aggregates accumulate and eventually lead to neurodegeneration, suggesting that autophagy selectively degrades harmful protein aggregates (3Hara T.

https://openalex.org/W2034564449,"Background Heparan sulfate (HS) is an important regulator of the assembly and activity of various angiogenic signalling complexes. However, the significance of precisely defined HS structures in regulating cytokine-dependent angiogenic cellular functions and signalling through receptors regulating angiogenic responses remains unclear. Understanding such structure-activity relationships is important for the rational design of HS fragments that inhibit HS-dependent angiogenic signalling complexes. Methodology/Principal Findings We synthesized a series of HS oligosaccharides ranging from 7 to 12 saccharide residues that contained a repeating disaccharide unit consisting of iduronate 2-O-sulfate linked to glucosamine with or without N-sulfate. The ability of oligosaccharides to compete with HS for FGF2 and VEGF165 binding significantly increased with oligosaccharide length and sulfation. Correspondingly, the inhibitory potential of oligosaccharides against FGF2- and VEGF165-induced endothelial cell responses was greater in longer oligosaccharide species that were comprised of disaccharides bearing both 2-O- and N-sulfation (2SNS). FGF2- and VEGF165-induced endothelial cell migration were inhibited by longer 2SNS oligosaccharide species with 2SNS dodecasaccharide activity being comparable to that of receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitors targeting FGFR or VEGFR-2. Moreover, the 2SNS dodecasaccharide ablated FGF2- or VEGF165-induced phosphorylation of FAK and assembly of F-actin in peripheral lamellipodia-like structures. In contrast, FGF2-induced endothelial cell proliferation was only moderately inhibited by longer 2SNS oligosaccharides. Inhibition of FGF2- and VEGF165-dependent endothelial tube formation strongly correlated with oligosaccharide length and sulfation with 10-mer and 12-mer 2SNS oligosaccharides being the most potent species. FGF2- and VEGF165-induced activation of MAPK pathway was inhibited by biologically active oligosaccharides correlating with the specific phosphorylation events in FRS2 and VEGFR-2, respectively. Conclusion/Significance These results demonstrate structure-function relationships for synthetic HS saccharides that suppress endothelial cell migration, tube formation and signalling induced by key angiogenic cytokines."
https://openalex.org/W2086693919,"Missense mutations in the human C10orf2 gene, encoding the mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) helicase, co-segregate with mitochondrial diseases such as adult-onset progressive external ophthalmoplegia, hepatocerebral syndrome with mtDNA depletion syndrome, and infantile-onset spinocerebellar ataxia. To understand the biochemical consequences of C10orf2 mutations, we overproduced wild type and 20 mutant forms of human mtDNA helicase in Escherichia coli and developed novel schemes to purify the recombinant enzymes to near homogeneity. A combination of molecular crowding, non-ionic detergents, Mg2+ ions, and elevated ionic strength was required to combat insolubility and intrinsic instability of certain mutant variants. A systematic biochemical assessment of the enzymes included analysis of DNA binding affinity, DNA helicase activity, the kinetics of nucleotide hydrolysis, and estimates of thermal stability. In contrast to other studies, we found that all 20 mutant variants retain helicase function under optimized in vitro conditions despite partial reductions in DNA binding affinity, nucleotide hydrolysis, or thermal stability for some mutants. Such partial defects are consistent with the delayed presentation of mitochondrial diseases associated with mutation of C10orf2.

A combination of molecular crowding, non-ionic detergents, Mg2+ ions, and elevated ionic strength was required to combat insolubility and intrinsic instability of certain mutant variants. A systematic biochemical assessment of the enzymes included analysis of DNA binding affinity, DNA helicase activity, the kinetics of nucleotide hydrolysis, and estimates of thermal stability. In contrast to other studies, we found that all 20 mutant variants retain helicase function under optimized in vitro conditions despite partial reductions in DNA binding affinity, nucleotide hydrolysis, or thermal stability for some mutants. Such partial defects are consistent with the delayed presentation of mitochondrial diseases associated with mutation of C10orf2. Chronic disruption of mitochondrial function can result in a broad array of neuromuscular degenerative disorders known as mitochondrial diseases, including progressive external ophthalmoplegia (PEO), 2The abbreviations used are: PEOprogressive external ophthalmoplegiaadPEOautosomal dominant PEOMDSmtDNA depletion syndromeIOSCAinfantile-onset spinocerebellar ataxiaIMACimmobilized metal ion affinity chromatographyntnucleotidesATPγSadenosine 5′-O-(thiotriphosphate).

A heritable form of PEO was first mapped to a chromosomal interval near position 10q24 in a Finnish pedigree (4Suomalainen A. Kaukonen J. Amati P. Timonen R. Haltia M. Weissenbach J. Zeviani M. Somer H. Peltonen L. Nat. Genet. 1995; 9: 146-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). One molecular hallmark of PEO was the age-dependent accumulation of mtDNA deletions in somatic tissues of affected individuals, which suggested that this locus was needed for replication or maintenance of mtDNA (4Suomalainen A.

In 2001, autosomal dominant PEO with mtDNA deletions was shown to co-segregate with 11 different missense mutations in the C10orf2 gene (5Spelbrink J.N. Li F.Y. Tiranti V. Nikali K. Yuan Q.P.

Since that time, numerous reports have identified 23 additional missense mutations in C10orf2 associated with heritable mitochondrial diseases such as adPEO, hepatocerebral mtDNA depletion syndrome (MDS), and infantile-onset spinocerebellar ataxia (IOSCA) (7Van Hove J.L.

Several lines of evidence more directly link C10orf2 function to maintenance of mtDNA. The C10orf2 gene product dynamically colocalizes with mtDNA in nucleoprotein structures known as mitochondrial nucleoids (5Spelbrink J.N. Li F.Y. Tiranti V. Nikali K. Yuan Q.P. Tariq M. Wanrooij S.

Overexpression of catalytic mutants and dominant disease variants of the mtDNA helicase in cultured human or Schneider cells results in stalled mtDNA replication or depletion of mtDNA (11Wanrooij S.

However, only two of five adPEO mutants exhibited a dominant negative phenotype with mtDNA depletion in Schneider cells (12Matsushima Y. Kaguni L.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 9436-9444Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Overexpression of two adPEO variants in a mouse transgenic model recapitulated many of the symptoms observed in human PEO, including accumulation of multiple mtDNA deletions, progressive respiratory dysfunction, and cytochrome c oxidase deficiency (14Tyynismaa H. Mjosund K.P. Wanrooij S. Lappalainen I. Ylikallio E. Jalanko A. Spelbrink J.N. Paetau A. Suomalainen A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Like the replicative DNA helicases Escherichia coli DnaB, bacteriophage T7 gene product 4, bacteriophage T4 gene product 41, and the prokaryotic RepA protein, the mitochondrial enzyme is an hexameric helicase that catalyzes hydrolysis of nucleoside triphosphates to unwind DNA substrates with a 5′ to 3′ polarity (16Korhonen J.A. Gaspari M. Falkenberg M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 48627-48632Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar). Also known as Twinkle, the mitochondrial DNA helicase can function in concert with polymerase γ and the mitochondrial single-stranded DNA binding protein to synthesize multikilobase DNA products in vitro (17Korhonen J.A. Pham X.H. Pellegrini M. Falkenberg M. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 2423-2429Crossref PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar). The majority of pathogenic C10orf2 mutations cluster in a region of the protein linking the N-terminal primase-like domain and the C-terminal helicase domain (see Fig. 1). Comparison of sequence homology among superfamily 4 helicases suggests that this linker region participates in subunit interaction and facilitates the formation of functional hexamers. The existing literature contains conflicting descriptions of the specific enzymatic activities and biochemical properties of the wild type (WT) and certain mutant variants of human mtDNA helicase. Variability in protocols for protein purification and differences in DNA substrates and assay conditions make it difficult to reconcile these discrepancies. To begin to determine how biochemical defects in the mitochondrial DNA helicase may be contributing to diseases of mtDNA maintenance, we developed a scheme to overproduce wild type (WT) and mutant variants of the mitochondrial DNA helicase in E. coli and to purify the recombinant enzymes to near homogeneity. We found that the solubility and long term stability of the enzyme were significantly enhanced by a combination of molecular crowding, non-ionic detergents, Mg2+ ions, and elevated ionic strength, which has allowed the enzymatic properties of some of the less stable helicase variants to be determined. Biochemical characterization of the enzyme collection included analysis of DNA binding affinity, DNA helicase activity, the kinetics of nucleotide hydrolysis, and estimates of thermal stability. A cDNA for the human C10orf2 gene (5Spelbrink J.N. Li F.Y. Tiranti V. Nikali K. Yuan Q.P. Tariq M. Wanrooij S. Garrido N. Comi G. Morandi L. Santoro L. Toscano A. Fabrizi G.M. Somer H. Croxen R. Beeson D. Poulton J. Suomalainen A. Jacobs H.T. Zeviani M. Larsson C. Nat. Genet. 2001; 28: 223-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (698) Google Scholar) was amplified from a HeLa cDNA library (Stratagene) by PCR with 5′-TATAGAGCTCCCTCCTCGCAGACGTTACAGGAAGGAG-3′ and 5′-TATAAAGCTTTCACTTTGAACGCTTGGAGGTGTCTGGCTGG-3′ as the forward and reverse primers, respectively, and the DNA sequence was found to match that of GenBankTM accession number AF292004. To remove the predicted 42-amino acid mitochondrial targeting sequence from the N terminus (18Claros M.G. Vincens P. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 241: 779-786Crossref PubMed Scopus (1386) Google Scholar), the coding sequence was amplified with 5′-TATACATATGGAGACTCTCCAAGCCTTGGATATGCCA-3′ (forward) and 5′-TATAAAGCTTTCACTTTGAACGCTTGGAGGTGTCTGGCTGG-3′ (reverse) primers, digested with NdeI and HindIII, and transferred to the E. coli expression vector pET21a (Novagen). The sequence of the resulting plasmid, pT684D42, was confirmed and shown to encode the mature form of the mitochondrial helicase (amino acids 43–684, predicted molecular weight 72,202). A second plasmid, pT684D42C-His, was constructed to introduce an affinity tag by appending the amino acids Ala-Ala-Ala-Leu-Glu-His6 to the C terminus (predicted molecular weight 73,479). Missense mutations in C10orf2 associated with mitochondrial diseases were generated in pT684D42C-His using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). Primers used for generation of the mutant forms are listed in the supplemental material. Overnight cultures of E. coli strain BL21(DE3) CodonPlus-RIPL (Stratagene) that had been freshly transformed with each plasmid were grown at 37 °C in Luria-Bertani medium supplemented with 100 μg/ml ampicillin and 34 μg/ml chloramphenicol. Prewarmed Luria-Bertani medium (1 liter) supplemented only with 100 μg/ml ampicillin was inoculated with 11 ml of each overnight culture and incubated with rotary shaking at 37 °C. Once the optical density (600 nm) of cultures reached 0.6, flasks were chilled on ice to 20 °C, and IPTG was added to a final concentration of 1 mm. Incubation was continued at 20 °C for 18 h, after which cells were harvested by centrifugation, washed once in 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5) with 0.1 mm EDTA, frozen on liquid nitrogen, and stored at −80 °C. All steps were performed at 4 °C. Frozen pellets of induced cells (5–6 g) were thawed on wet ice and resuspended in 25 ml of a lysis buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 0.5 m NaCl, 10% glycerol, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 20 mm imidazole, 5 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm PMSF, and 1 mm ATP. The cell suspension was twice passed through a 40-ml French pressure cell (Amicon) at 18,000 p.s.i., and the resulting whole cell lysate was clarified by centrifugation at 12,000 × g for 15 min. This soluble lysate was immediately applied by peristaltic pump at 30 ml/h to a HisTrap HP column (1 ml, GE Healthcare) previously equilibrated in lysis buffer. The column was washed with 12 ml of a buffer consisting of 30 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 20% glycerol, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, 5 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm PMSF, 0.2 mm ATP (buffer T) also containing 0.50 m NaCl and 20 mm imidazole followed by a 12-ml wash with buffer T containing 0.31 m NaCl and 20 mm imidazole. Then the column was eluted with 7 ml of buffer T containing 0.31 m NaCl and 250 mm imidazole. Protein-containing fractions were applied to a HiTrap Q HP column (1 ml, GE Healthcare) equilibrated in buffer T also containing 0.31 m NaCl. Under these conditions, the enzyme remained in the unbound fraction, and was applied directly to a HiTrap Heparin HP column (1 ml, GE Healthcare) previously equilibrated in buffer T containing 0.31 m NaCl. The heparin column was washed with 10 ml of equilibration buffer and eluted with an 11-ml linear gradient of NaCl (0.31–1.0 m) in buffer T. The helicase eluted at ∼0.55 m NaCl and was frozen in small aliquots with liquid nitrogen and stored at −80 °C. Materials bound to the HiTrap Q HP column were eluted with buffer T containing 1.0 m NaCl and saved for analysis. Soluble lysates of cells induced to overexpress the untagged mitochondrial helicase were prepared as before, except that the lysis buffer consisted of 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 0.2 m NaCl, 10% glycerol, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm EDTA, 5 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, and 0.1 mm PMSF. Soluble lysates were supplemented with 1 m MgCl2 to a final concentration of 5 mm, and solid ammonium sulfate was added to 34% saturation (0.202 g/ml solution). After 30 min of slow stirring, the precipitate was collected by centrifugation at 27,000 × g for 15 min. The well drained precipitate was resuspended in a sufficient volume (4–5 ml) of buffer T to make the conductivity of the sample equivalent to buffer T also containing 0.35 m NaCl. The sample was applied to a 10-ml column of heparin-Sepharose HP (GE Healthcare) equilibrated in buffer T also containing 0.35 m NaCl. The column was washed with 50 ml of equilibration buffer and developed with a 110-ml gradient of NaCl (0.35–1.0 m) in buffer T. Fractions containing the recombinant protein eluted at ∼0.55 m NaCl, as identified by SDS-PAGE. Pooled fractions were diluted with buffer T until their conductivity matched that of buffer T containing 0.35 m NaCl. This protein fraction was passed first through a 1-ml HiTrap Q HP column equilibrated in buffer T containing 0.35 m NaCl before being applied to a 2.2-ml column of hydroxylapatite (BioGel HT, Bio-Rad) equilibrated in the same buffer. After washing with 10 ml of equilibration buffer, the HiTrap Q HP column was removed, and protein was step-eluted from the hydroxylapatite column with 4 ml of buffer T also containing 0.35 m NaCl and 0.5 m potassium phosphate (pH 7.5). The enzyme was further purified by size exclusion chromatography by passage at 1 ml/min through a column of Sephacryl S-200 HR (26 × 5.3 cm2) equilibrated in a buffer containing 25 mm HEPES-OH (pH 7.5), 20% glycerol, 1 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, 5 mm MgCl2, 0.01% Nonidet P-40, and 0.5 m NaCl. The single, symmetrical peak of highly purified protein eluted 55 ml after sample injection (0.41 column volumes). As needed, the enzyme could be concentrated by cation exchange chromatography. Protein samples were diluted or dialyzed against buffer T containing 0.2 m NaCl, and then the samples were applied to a 1 ml HiTrap SP HP column equilibrated in this buffer. After washing the column to obtain a stable baseline, the column was developed with a 10-ml linear gradient of NaCl (0.2–0.7 m) in buffer T. The enzyme eluted at ∼0.32 m NaCl and was frozen in small aliquots with liquid nitrogen and stored at −80 °C. As needed, the helicase can be concentrated successfully by ultrafiltration. Exonuclease activity was determined in reaction mixtures (15 μl) containing 25 mm HEPES-OH (pH 7.5), 5 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, 5 mm MgCl2, 50 μg/ml BSA, 1 mm ATP, 0.1 pmol of the 5′-32P-labeled oligonucleotide 5′-GTATGTTCGCCTGTAATATTGAACGTAGGTGCGA-3′, and 0.43 pmol of purified protein. Activity on a double-stranded DNA substrate was also determined with the labeled oligonucleotide hybridized to the second oligonucleotide 5′-TTATCGCACCTACGTTCAATATTACAGGCGAACATACT-3′. Reactions were incubated at 37 °C for 30 min prior to analysis on denaturing 15% polyacrylamide gels, as described previously (19Longley M.J. Ropp P.A. Lim S.E. Copeland W.C. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 10529-10539Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). DNA substrates utilized to assay DNA binding and DNA helicase activity were constructed from synthetic oligonucleotides. Three 40-nucleotide oligomers TD1 (5′-ATGCTAGCTTGGCTGTGACTTTAAACCTGTCGTGCCAGCT-3′), TD2 (5′-AGCTGGCACGACAGGTTTAAAGTCACAGCCAAGCTAGCAT-3′), and TD3 (5′-AGCTGGCACGACAGGTTTCCCGACTGGAAAGCGGGCAGTG-3′) were obtained from Oligos Etc. (Wilsonville, OR) and were quantified by absorbance at 260 nm. An internally modified version of TD1 with fluorescein covalently attached to the thymine at position 21 (TD1-F) was purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. The concentration of TD1-F was determined spectrophotometrically at 260 nm and adjusted slightly downward to compensate for intrinsic absorbance of fluorescein at 260 nm (20Heyduk T. Ma Y. Tang H. Ebright R.H. Methods Enzymol. 1996; 274: 492-503Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). TD1 was utilized directly as a single-stranded DNA substrate, whereas TD1 hybridized to the fully complementary oligonucleotide TD2 served as the double-stranded DNA substrate. Annealing TD1 and TD3 generated a forked DNA substrate with 18 nt at the 3′-end of TD1 being fully complementary to 18 nt at the 5′-end of TD3, leaving 22-nt single-stranded tails at the 5′-end of TD1 and the 3′-end of TD3. Fluorescent substrates were hybridized in a solution containing 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 50 mm NaCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, and 10 μm each of the indicated oligonucleotides by heating to 85 °C followed by slow cooling to room temperature. Immediately prior to use, the substrates were warmed to 42 °C for 5 min and held at room temperature. Steady state fluorescence anisotropy was measured with an Olis RSM1000 spectrofluorometer (Bogart, GA) equipped with a 1.24-mm slit and a temperature-controlled cell set to 22 °C. Incident light at a 480 nm excitation wavelength was vertically plane-polarized and passed through a T-format quartz fluorometer cell, and fluorescence was measured at two identical detectors fitted with 530-nm high pass filters and vertical or horizontal polarizing filters. Binding mixtures (200 μl) contained 30 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 1 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, 5 mm MgCl2, 20% (v/v) glycerol, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, and a 15 nm concentration of the specified fluorescein-conjugated oligonucleotide substrate. Changes in fluorescence polarization were measured in response to the stepwise addition of purified helicase in buffer T that also contained 0.35 m NaCl. Following a 1-min equilibration period after each addition, anisotropy data were collected in triplicate with a 10-s integration time. Changes in anisotropy were plotted against the total concentration of protein, expressed as hexamers. To correct for the ligand depletion effect caused by non-trivial concentrations of protein-DNA complex relative to the total protein concentration, binding isotherms were fit to a quadratic equation by non-linear regression analysis to calculate apparent Kd(DNA) values (21Heyduk T. Lee J.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1990; 87: 1744-1748Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). Intrinsic fluorescence of buffer components was undetectable at wavelengths relevant to fluorescein. Volume-corrected total fluorescence intensity varied less than 4% during all titrations and additions, indicating that changes in anisotropy were minimally affected by light scattering due to protein aggregation or by fluorescence quenching due to protein binding directly to the fluorescein instead of to the DNA substrate. The substrate chosen for DNA helicase assays was patterned after the oligonucleotide-based, forked DNA substrate used to characterize the T7 gp4 DNA helicase (22Notarnicola S.M. Park K. Griffith J.D. Richardson C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 20215-20224Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). T4 polynucleotide kinase was utilized to 5′-end-label oligonucleotide TD1, and the forked DNA substrate was constructed by annealing radiolabeled TD1 with the partially complementary oligonucleotide TD3. Helicase reaction mixtures (12 μl) contained 20 mm HEPES-OH (pH 7.5), 5 mm dithiothreitol, 50 μg/ml BSA, 7% glycerol, 5 mm MgCl2, 4.5 mm ATP, 40 nm [32P]TD1-TD3 forked DNA substrate, and 12 nm of the indicated protein (as hexamers). Reactions were incubated at 37 °C for the indicated times and were terminated by the addition (3 μl) of a stop solution composed of 0.1 m EDTA, 0.5% SDS, 30% glycerol, and a trace quantity of bromphenol blue. Double-stranded DNA substrates and single-stranded DNA products were resolved by native PAGE. Gels (17 × 14 × 0.075 cm) contained 62 mm Tris, 62 mm boric acid, 1.7 mm EDTA, and 12% polyacrylamide (19:1 acrylamide:bis-acrylamide ratio), and electrophoresis was performed at room temperature for 2 h at 150 V. Gels were dried onto DE81 paper (Whatman), and the relative amounts of substrate and product in each lane were quantified with a Typhoon 9400 PhosphorImager (GE Healthcare) and NIH ImageJ software. The percentage of displaced oligonucleotide was calculated as described previously (23Debyser Z. Tabor S. Richardson C.C. Cell. 1994; 77: 157-166Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Enzymatic hydrolysis of ATP was determined in reaction mixtures (20 μl) containing 20 mm Tris-Cl (pH 7.8), 4.5 mm MgCl2, 15% glycerol, 0.3 mg/ml BSA, 0.8 μCi of [α-32P]ATP (3000 Ci/mmol), 0.7 mm ATP, and the indicated quantities of helicase protein (0.2–0.4 μm monomers). As needed, enzymes were diluted in buffer T also containing 0.5 m NaCl and 0.1 mg/ml BSA. Unless otherwise indicated, 0.2 μg of activated calf thymus DNA (Invitrogen) was included in each reaction. Unlabeled ATP was varied from 0 to 5 mm for kinetic analyses. Reactions were incubated at 37 °C for 25 min, and reactions were stopped by chilling on ice followed by the addition of 0.5 μl of 0.5 m EDTA. Samples (1.6 μl) of each reaction were spotted onto polyethyleneimine-cellulose thin layer chromatography plates (Merck) and air-dried. Plates were rinsed in absolute methanol to remove buffer components and developed for 30 min by ascending TLC with a mobile phase consisting of 0.5 m LiCl, 1.0 m acetic acid. Dried plates were exposed to phosphor storage screens, and radiolabeled ATP substrate and ADP product were quantified with a Typhoon 9400 PhosphorImager (GE Healthcare) and NIH ImageJ software. Protein concentrations were determined by SDS-PAGE of multiple sample dilutions, staining with Coomassie Brilliant Blue, and quantitative digital imaging of protein bands relative to BSA standards in neighboring lanes. Polyclonal antibodies were raised in a New Zealand White rabbit against denatured, SDS-PAGE purified, affinity-tagged mitochondrial DNA helicase. Freund's complete adjuvant was included in the first immunization. For immunoblot analysis, proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE, electrotransferred to Immobilon P membranes (Millipore), and sequentially incubated with rabbit anti-helicase antiserum (1:100 dilution) and alkaline phosphatase-conjugated second antibody. Cross-reactive protein bands were visualized with the Western Blue reagent (Promega). Mitochondrial disease phenotypes co-segregate with mutations in C10orf2 (Fig. 1). Heritable clinical and molecular phenotypes include adult-onset PEO with mtDNA deletions and dominant inheritance, infantile-onset spinocerebellar ataxia with a recessive mode of inheritance, and hepatocerebral mtDNA depletion. The deletion and depletion of mtDNA that are hallmarks of these disease pedigrees may arise from defects in mtDNA replication and repair. A biochemical approach to determine the molecular mechanisms underlying dysfunctional mtDNA replication requires purified mitochondrial DNA helicases for in vitro studies. An E. coli expression system was chosen to maximize the yield of recombinant proteins and to simplify the production of mutant forms of the mitochondrial helicase. A cDNA encoding the human C10orf2 gene was amplified and placed under the control of an inducible promoter on the E. coli expression vector pET21a, and overproduction of recombinant helicase lacking the mitochondrial targeting sequence was induced with IPTG. Conditions for expression were routinely screened by SDS-PAGE analysis of whole cell lysates, and the highest production of WT enzyme was observed for the BL21(DE3) CodonPlus-RIPL host strain with a reduced temperature of induction. Analysis of whole cell lysates by SDS-PAGE showed that more than 20 mg of the 72-kDa protein (p72) could be produced from 1 liter of culture (Fig. 2A, lane 1). The His-tagged form of the enzyme was purified to apparent homogeneity by immobilized metal ion affinity chromatography (IMAC) followed by anion exchange and heparin affinity chromatography, as described under “Experimental Procedures” (Fig. 2A). Initial attempts to purify the enzyme from whole cell lysates resulted in precipitation of the recombinant protein. Trial experiments demonstrated that precipitation could be minimized by including 10% glycerol, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 5 mm MgCl2, and 0.5 m NaCl in the lysis buffer. The high concentration of NaCl also helped to release p72 from the nucleic acid debris upon clearing the lysate by centrifugation (Fig. 2A, lane 2). Aggregation of the protein was completely eliminated by raising the glycerol concentration to 20% for the chromatographic steps. Although immobilized nickel ion chromatography was remarkably efficient at capturing p72 from the soluble lysate (Fig. 2A, lane 5), contamination of this fraction with nucleic acid was revealed by agarose gel electrophoresis and staining with ethidium bromide (Fig. 2B, lane 3). Accordingly, the NaCl concentration of the IMAC elution buffer was adjusted to 0.31 m NaCl because nucleic acids are retained quantitatively by the subsequent HiTrap Q HP column under these buffer conditions (Fig. 2B, lane 5). Several low molecular weight protein contaminants and roughly 10% of the available p72 are also retained on this column, possibly through interaction with the bound nucleic acids (Fig. 2A, lane 7). The final purification step produced p72 that was >95% pure (Fig. 2A, lanes 8 and 9) and free of nucleic acids (Fig. 2B, lanes 6–8). Plasmids bearing missense variants of p72 (Fig. 1) were prepared by site directed mutagenesis, as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The 20 mutant forms of p72 exhibited chromatographic behavior that was identical to WT p72 when purified by this rapid protocol. The purity of the mutant variants was uniformly ≥95%, although the yield of each preparation varied somewhat from 0.7 to 3.1 mg of purified protein. To assess any effects of the affinity tag on the activities of the recombinant enzyme, the recombinant helicase lacking an affinity tag was also prepared, as described under “Experimental Procedures.” As observed for the affinity-tagged protein, the untagged enzyme also had a propensity to precipitate in the absence of a relatively high concentration of NaCl, and this tendency increased after removal of residual nucleic acid contaminants by passage through the HiTrap Q anion exchange column (data not shown). Nevertheless, the untagged enzyme could be purified through a series of steps that did not rely on lowering ionic strength, including ammonium sulfate precipitation, heparin affinity and hydroxylapatite chromatography, and size exclusion chromatography.

In unstressed cells, p53 is maintained at low levels and is largely inactive, mainly through the action of its two essential negative regulators, HDM2 and HDMX. p53 abundance and activity are up-regulated in response to various stresses, including DNA damage and oncogene activation. Active p53 initiates transcriptional and transcription-independent programs that result in cell cycle arrest, cellular senescence, or apoptosis. p53 also activates transcription of HDM2, which initially leads to the degradation of HDMX, creating a positive feedback loop to obtain maximal activation of p53. Subsequently, when stress-induced post-translational modifications start to decline, HDM2 becomes effective in targeting p53 for degradation, thus attenuating the p53 response. To date, no clear function for HDMX in this critical attenuation phase has been demonstrated experimentally. Like HDM2, the HDMX gene contains a promoter (P2) in its first intron that is potentially inducible by p53. We show that p53 activation in response to a plethora of p53-activating agents induces the transcription of a novel HDMX mRNA transcript from the HDMX-P2 promoter. This mRNA is more efficiently translated than that expressed from the constitutive HDMX-P1 promoter, and it encodes a long form of HDMX protein, HDMX-L. Importantly, we demonstrate that HDMX-L cooperates with HDM2 to promote the ubiquitination of p53 and that p53-induced HDMX transcription from the P2 promoter can play a key role in the attenuation phase of the p53 response, to effectively diminish p53 abundance as cells recover from stress.

https://openalex.org/W1991787050,"Persistent immune activation plays a central role in driving Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) disease progression. Whether CD4+CD25+ regulatory T cells (Tregs) are harmful by suppressing HIV-specific immune responses and/or beneficial through a decrease in immune activation remains debatable. We analysed the relationship between proportion and number of regulatory T cells (Tregs) and immune activation in HIV-infected patients interrupting an effective antiretroviral therapy (ART). Twenty-five patients were included in a substudy of a prospective multicenter trial of treatment interruption (TI) (ANRS 116). Proportions and numbers of Tregs and the proportion of activated CD4 and CD8 T cells were assessed at baseline and month 12 (M12) of TI. Specific anti-HIV CD4 and CD8 responses were investigated at baseline and M12. Non parametric univariate analyses and multivariate linear regression models were conducted. At baseline, the proportion of Tregs negatively correlated with the proportion of HLA-DR+CD8+T cells (r = −0.519). Following TI, the proportion of Tregs increased from 6.3% to 7.2% (p = 0.029); absolute numbers of Tregs decreased. The increase in the proportion of HLA-DR+CD38+CD8+T cells was significantly related to the increase in proportion of Tregs (p = 0.031). At M12, the proportion of Tregs did not negatively correlate with CD8 T-cell activation. Nevertheless, Tregs retain a suppressive function since depletion of Treg-containing CD4+CD25+ cells led to an increase in lymphoproliferative responses in most patients studied. Our data suggest that Tregs are efficient in controlling residual immune activation in patients with ART-mediated viral suppression. However, the insufficient increase in the proportion and/or the decrease in the absolute number of Tregs result in a failure to control immune activation following TI.

https://openalex.org/W2069899560,"Background Many developmental genes are still active in specific tissues after development is completed. This is the case for the homeobox gene Otx2, an essential actor of forebrain and head development. In adult mouse, Otx2 is strongly expressed in the retina. Mutations of this gene in humans have been linked to severe ocular malformation and retinal diseases. It is, therefore, important to explore its post-developmental functions. In the mature retina, Otx2 is expressed in three cell types: bipolar and photoreceptor cells that belong to the neural retina and retinal pigment epithelium (RPE), a neighbour structure that forms a tightly interdependent functional unit together with photoreceptor cells. Methodology/Principal Findings Conditional self-knockout was used to address the late functions of Otx2 gene in adult mice. This strategy is based on the combination of a knock-in CreERT2 allele and a floxed allele at the Otx2 locus. Time-controlled injection of tamoxifen activates the recombinase only in Otx2 expressing cells, resulting in selective ablation of the gene in its entire domain of expression. In the adult retina, loss of Otx2 protein causes slow degeneration of photoreceptor cells. By contrast, dramatic changes of RPE activity rapidly occur, which may represent a primary cause of photoreceptor disease. Conclusions Our novel mouse model uncovers new Otx2 functions in adult retina. We show that this transcription factor is necessary for long-term maintenance of photoreceptors, likely through the control of specific activities of the RPE."
https://openalex.org/W2146772748,"Background Accurate data on adherence and sexual behaviour are crucial in microbicide (and other HIV-related) research. In the absence of a “gold standard” the collection of such data relies largely on participant self-reporting. The Microbicides Development Programme has developed a mixed method/triangulation model for generating more accurate data on adherence and sexual behaviour. Methodology/Principal Findings Data were collected from a random subsample of 725 women using structured case record form (CRF) interviews, coital diaries (CD) and in-depth interviews (IDI). Returned used and unused gel applicators were counted and additional data collected through focus group discussions and ethnography. The model is described in detail in a companion paper [1]. When CRF, CD and IDI are compared there is some inconsistency with regard to reporting of sexual behaviour, gel or condom use in more than half. Inaccuracies are least prevalent in the IDI and most prevalent in the CRF, where participants tend to under-report frequency of sex and gel and condom use. Women reported more sex, gel and condom use than their partners. IDI data on adherence match the applicator-return data more closely than the CRF. The main reasons for inaccuracies are participants forgetting, interviewer error, desirability bias, problems with the definition and delineation of key concepts (e.g. “sex act”). Most inaccuracies were unintentional and could be rectified during data collection. Conclusions/Significance The CRF – the main source of self-report data on behaviour and adherence in many studies – was the least accurate with regard to measuring sexual behaviour, gel and condom use. This has important implications for the use of structured questionnaires for the collection of data on sexual behaviour and adherence. Integrating in-depth interviews and triangulation into clinical trials could increase the richness and accuracy of behavioural and adherence data."
https://openalex.org/W2015037376,"Human transthyretin (TTR) is a homotetrameric protein involved in several amyloidoses. Zn(2+) enhances TTR aggregation in vitro, and is a component of ex vivo TTR amyloid fibrils. We report the first crystal structure of human TTR in complex with Zn(2+) at pH 4.6-7.5. All four structures reveal three tetra-coordinated Zn(2+)-binding sites (ZBS 1-3) per monomer, plus a fourth site (ZBS 4) involving amino acid residues from a symmetry-related tetramer that is not visible in solution by NMR. Zn(2+) binding perturbs loop E-α-helix-loop F, the region involved in holo-retinol-binding protein (holo-RBP) recognition, mainly at acidic pH; TTR affinity for holo-RBP decreases ∼5-fold in the presence of Zn(2+). Interestingly, this same region is disrupted in the crystal structure of the amyloidogenic intermediate of TTR formed at acidic pH in the absence of Zn(2+). HNCO and HNCA experiments performed in solution at pH 7.5 revealed that upon Zn(2+) binding, although the α-helix persists, there are perturbations in the resonances of the residues that flank this region, suggesting an increase in structural flexibility. While stability of the monomer of TTR decreases in the presence of Zn(2+), which is consistent with the tertiary structural perturbation provoked by Zn(2+) binding, tetramer stability is only marginally affected by Zn(2+). These data highlight structural and functional roles of Zn(2+) in TTR-related amyloidoses, as well as in holo-RBP recognition and vitamin A homeostasis."
https://openalex.org/W2125865284,"Laminin alpha2 chain mutations cause congenital muscular dystrophy with dysmyelination neuropathy (MDC1A). Previously, we demonstrated that laminin alpha1 chain ameliorates the disease in mice. Dystroglycan and integrins are major laminin receptors. Unlike laminin alpha2 chain, alpha1 chain binds the receptors by separate domains; laminin globular (LG) domains 4 and LG1-3, respectively. Thus, the laminin alpha1 chain is an excellent tool to distinguish between the roles of dystroglycan and integrins in the neuromuscular system.Here, we provide insights into the functions of laminin alpha1LG domains and the division of their roles in MDC1A pathogenesis and rescue. Overexpression of laminin alpha1 chain that lacks the dystroglycan binding LG4-5 domains in alpha2 chain deficient mice resulted in prolonged lifespan and improved health. Importantly, diaphragm and heart muscles were corrected, whereas limb muscles were dystrophic, indicating that different muscles have different requirements for LG4-5 domains. Furthermore, the regenerative capacity of the skeletal muscle did not depend on laminin alpha1LG4-5. However, this domain was crucial for preventing apoptosis in limb muscles, essential for myelination in peripheral nerve and important for basement membrane assembly.These results show that laminin alpha1LG domains and consequently their receptors have disparate functions in the neuromuscular system. Understanding these interactions could contribute to design and optimization of future medical treatment for MDC1A patients."
https://openalex.org/W2043799684,"The microbial deconstruction of the plant cell wall is a critical biological process, which also provides important substrates for environmentally sustainable industries. Enzymes that hydrolyze the plant cell wall generally contain non-catalytic carbohydrate binding modules (CBMs) that contribute to plant cell wall degradation. Here we report the biochemical properties and crystal structure of a family of CBMs (CBM60) that are located in xylanases. Uniquely, the proteins display broad ligand specificity, targeting xylans, galactans, and cellulose. Some of the CBM60s display enhanced affinity for their ligands through avidity effects mediated by protein dimerization. The crystal structure of vCBM60, displays a β-sandwich with the ligand binding site comprising a broad cleft formed by the loops connecting the two β-sheets. Ligand recognition at site 1 is, exclusively, through hydrophobic interactions, whereas binding at site 2 is conferred by polar interactions between a protein-bound calcium and the O2 and O3 of the sugar. The observation, that ligand recognition at site 2 requires only a β-linked sugar that contains equatorial hydroxyls at C2 and C3, explains the broad ligand specificity displayed by vCBM60. The ligand-binding apparatus of vCBM60 displays remarkable structural conservation with a family 36 CBM (CBM36); however, the residues that contribute to carbohydrate recognition are derived from different regions of the two proteins. Three-dimensional structure-based sequence alignments reveal that CBM36 and CBM60 are related by circular permutation. The biological and evolutionary significance of the mechanism of ligand recognition displayed by family 60 CBMs is discussed."
https://openalex.org/W1990837917,"Inducible nitric-oxide synthase (iNOS) produces biologically stressful levels of nitric oxide (NO) as a potent mediator of cellular cytotoxicity or signaling. Yet, how this nitrosative stress affects iNOS function in vivo is poorly understood. Here we define two specific non-heme iNOS nitrosation sites discovered by combining UV-visible spectroscopy, chemiluminescence, mass spectrometry, and x-ray crystallography. We detected auto-S-nitrosylation during enzymatic turnover by using chemiluminescence. Selective S-nitrosylation of the ZnS(4) site, which bridges the dimer interface, promoted a dimer-destabilizing order-to-disorder transition. The nitrosated iNOS crystal structure revealed an unexpected N-NO modification on the pterin cofactor. Furthermore, the structurally defined N-NO moiety is solvent-exposed and available to transfer NO to a partner. We investigated glutathione (GSH) as a potential transnitrosation partner because the intracellular GSH concentration is high and NOS can form S-nitrosoglutathione. Our computational results predicted a GSH binding site adjacent to the N-NO-pterin. Moreover, we detected GSH binding to iNOS with saturation transfer difference NMR spectroscopy. Collectively, these observations resolve previous paradoxes regarding this uncommon pterin cofactor in NOS and suggest means for regulating iNOS activity via N-NO-pterin and S-NO-Cys modifications. The iNOS self-nitrosation characterized here appears appropriate to help control NO production in response to cellular conditions."
https://openalex.org/W2116457945,"Research in competitive games has exclusively focused on how opponent models are developed through previous outcomes and how peoples' decisions relate to normative predictions. Little is known about how rapid impressions of opponents operate and influence behavior in competitive economic situations, although such subjective impressions have been shown to influence cooperative decision-making. This study investigates whether an opponent's face influences players' wagering decisions in a zero-sum game with hidden information. Participants made risky choices in a simplified poker task while being presented opponents whose faces differentially correlated with subjective impressions of trust. Surprisingly, we find that threatening face information has little influence on wagering behavior, but faces relaying positive emotional characteristics impact peoples' decisions. Thus, people took significantly longer and made more mistakes against emotionally positive opponents. Differences in reaction times and percent correct were greatest around the optimal decision boundary, indicating that face information is predominantly used when making decisions during medium-value gambles. Mistakes against emotionally positive opponents resulted from increased folding rates, suggesting that participants may have believed that these opponents were betting with hands of greater value than other opponents. According to these results, the best ""poker face"" for bluffing may not be a neutral face, but rather a face that contains emotional correlates of trustworthiness. Moreover, it suggests that rapid impressions of an opponent play an important role in competitive games, especially when people have little or no experience with an opponent."
https://openalex.org/W1965856242,"Background Intracellular transport of cargoes including organelles, vesicles, signalling molecules, protein complexes, and RNAs, is essential for normal function of eukaryotic cells. The cytoplasmic dynein complex is an important motor that moves cargos along microtubule tracks within the cell. In mammals this multiprotein complex includes dynein intermediate chains 1 and 2 which are encoded by two genes, Dync1i1 and Dync1i2. These proteins are involved in dynein cargo binding and dynein complexes with different intermediate chains bind to specific cargoes, although the mechanisms to achieve this are not known. The DYNC1I1 and DYNC1I2 proteins are translated from different splice isoforms, and specific forms of each protein are essential for the function of different dynein complexes in neurons. Methodology/Principal Findings Here we have undertaken a systematic survey of the dynein intermediate chain splice isoforms in mouse, basing our study on mRNA expression patterns in a range of tissues, and on bioinformatics analysis of mouse, rat and human genomic and cDNA sequences. We found a complex pattern of alternative splicing of both dynein intermediate chain genes, with maximum complexity in the embryonic and adult nervous system. We have found novel transcripts, including some with orthologues in human and rat, and a new promoter and alternative non-coding exon 1 for Dync1i2. Conclusions/Significance These data, including the cloned isoforms will be essential for understanding the role of intermediate chains in the cytoplasmic dynein complex, particularly their role in cargo binding within individual tissues including different brain regions."
https://openalex.org/W2030050379,"Background Thrombus formation is a key step in the pathophysiology of acute ischemic stroke and results from the activation of the coagulation cascade. Thrombin plays a central role in this coagulation system and contributes to thrombus stability via activation of thrombin-activatable fibrinolysis inhibitor (TAFIa). TAFIa counteracts endogenous fibrinolysis at different stages and elevated TAFI levels are a risk factor for thrombotic events including ischemic stroke. Although substantial in vitro data on the influence of TAFI on the coagulation-fibrinolysis-system exist, investigations on the consequences of TAFI inhibition in animal models of cerebral ischemia are still lacking. In the present study we analyzed stroke development and post stroke functional outcome in TAFI-/- mice. Methodology/Principal Findings TAFI-/- mice and wild-type controls were subjected to 60 min transient middle cerebral artery occlusion (tMCAO) using the intraluminal filament method. After 24 hours, functional outcome scores were assessed and infarct volumes were measured from 2,3,5-Triphenyltetrazoliumchloride (TTC)-stained brain slices. Hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining was used to estimate the extent of neuronal cell damage. Thrombus formation within the infarcted brain areas was analyzed by immunoblot. Infarct volumes and functional outcomes did not significantly differ between TAFI-/- mice and controls (p>0.05). Histology revealed extensive ischemic neuronal damage regularly including the cortex and the basal ganglia in both groups. TAFI deficiency also had no influence on intracerebral fibrin(ogen) formation after tMCAO. Conclusion Our study shows that TAFI does not play a major role for thrombus formation and neuronal degeneration after ischemic brain challenge."
https://openalex.org/W2024891373,"Alternatively-spliced (AS) forms can vary protein function, intracellular localization and post-translational modifications. AS coupled with mRNA nonsense-mediated decay (NMD) can also control the transcript abundance. Here, we have investigated the genome-scale conservation of alternatively-spliced NMD candidates (AS-NMD candidates), in mammals.We mapped>12 million cDNA/EST library transcripts, comprising pooled data from both older and next-generation sequencing techniques, against genomic sequences to annotate AS-NMD candidates generated by in-frame premature termination codons (PTCs), in the human, mouse, rat and cow genomes. In these genomes, we found populations of genes that harbour AS-NMD candidates, varying in number from approximately 149 to 2,051 genes. We discovered that a highly-significant proportion (27%-35%) of AS-NMD candidate genes in mouse, rat and cow, also have human orthologs targeted for NMD. Intron retention was the most abundant type of AS-NMD, ranging from 43% to 67% of genes harbouring an AS-NMD candidate. Groupings of AS-NMD candidate genes either with or without intron retentions also have highly significant AS-NMD conservation, indicating that the trend is not due primarily to conservation of intron retentions. As a subset, the AS-NMD intron retentions are distinguished from non-retained introns by higher GC content, and codon usage similar to the usage in protein-coding sequences. This indicates that most of these alternatively spliced sequences have coded for proteins in the recent evolutionary past. In general, the AS-NMD candidate genes showed a similar pattern of Gene Ontology functional category enrichments in all four species. Genes linked to nucleic-acid interaction and apoptosis, and involved in pathways linked with cancer, were the most common. Finally, we mapped the AS-NMD candidates to mass spectrometry-derived proteomics data, and gathered evidence of truncated polypeptides for at least 10% of all human AS-NMD candidate transcripts.In summary, our analysis provides strong statistical evidence for conservation of functional AS-NMD candidature across Mammalia for a large subset of genes. However, because codon usage of AS-NMD intron retentions is similar to the usage in exons, it is difficult to de-couple conservation of AS-NMD-based regulation from conservation for protein-coding ability, for intron retentions."
https://openalex.org/W2081061936,"A central goal in auditory neuroscience is to understand the neural coding of species-specific communication and human speech sounds. Low-rate repetitive sounds are elemental features of communication sounds, and core auditory cortical regions have been implicated in processing these information-bearing elements. Repetitive sounds could be encoded by at least three neural response properties: 1) the event-locked spike-timing precision, 2) the mean firing rate, and 3) the interspike interval (ISI). To determine how well these response aspects capture information about the repetition rate stimulus, we measured local group responses of cortical neurons in cat anterior auditory field (AAF) to click trains and calculated their mutual information based on these different codes. ISIs of the multiunit responses carried substantially higher information about low repetition rates than either spike-timing precision or firing rate. Combining firing rate and ISI codes was synergistic and captured modestly more repetition information. Spatial distribution analyses showed distinct local clustering properties for each encoding scheme for repetition information indicative of a place code. Diversity in local processing emphasis and distribution of different repetition rate codes across AAF may give rise to concurrent feed-forward processing streams that contribute differently to higher-order sound analysis."
https://openalex.org/W2056761990,"Background The recognition of peptide in the context of MHC by T lymphocytes is a critical step in the initiation of an adaptive immune response. However, the molecular nature of the interaction between peptide and MHC and how it influences T cell responsiveness is not fully understood. Results We analyzed the immunological consequences of the interaction of MHC class II (I-Au) restricted 11-mer peptides of myelin basic protein with amino acid substitutions at position 4. These mutant peptides differ in MHC binding affinity, CD4+ T cell priming, and alter the severity of peptide-induced experimental allergic encephalomyelitis. Using molecular dynamics, a computational method of quantifying intrinsic movements of proteins at high resolution, we investigated conformational changes in MHC upon peptide binding. We found that irrespective of peptide binding affinity, MHC deformation appears to influence costimulation, which then leads to effective T cell priming and disease induction. Although this study compares in vivo and molecular dynamics results for three altered peptide ligands, further investigation with similar complexes is essential to determine whether spatial rearrangement of peptide-MHC and costimulatory complexes is an additional level of T cell regulation."

The present study describes crystal structures and reactivity of wild-type and active site mutant TrzN enzymes. The homodimer native enzyme structure, solved to 1.40 Å resolution, is a (βα)8 barrel, characteristic of members of the amidohydrolase superfamily. TrzN uniquely positions threonine 325 in place of a conserved aspartate that ligates the metal in most mononuclear amidohydrolases superfamily members. The threonine side chain oxygen atom is 3.3 Å from the zinc atom and 2.6 Å from the oxygen atom of zinc-coordinated water. Mutation of the threonine to a serine resulted in a 12-fold decrease in kcat/Km, largely due to kcat, whereas the T325D and T325E mutants had immeasurable activity. The structure and kinetics of TrzN are reminiscent of carbonic anhydrase, which uses a threonine to assist in positioning water for reaction with carbon dioxide. An isosteric substitution in the active site glutamate, E241Q, showed a large diminution in activity with ametryn, no detectable activity with atratone, and a 10-fold decrease with atrazine, when compared with wild-type TrzN. Activity with the E241Q mutant was nearly constant from pH 6.0 to 10.0, consistent with the loss of a proton-donating group. Structures for TrzN-E241Q were solved with bound ametryn and atratone to 1.93 and 1.64 Å resolution, respectively.

However, both TrzN and AtzA catalyze hydrolytic dechlorination reactions with atrazine and related s-triazine herbicides. X-ray structures have been determined for chlorohydrolases that act on haloaliphatic and halobenzene substrates. Haloalkane dehalogenase, haloacid dehalogenase, and 4-chlorobenzoyl-CoA dehalogenase all use an aspartate nucleophile and hydrolyze the intermediate enzyme-substrate ester to catalyze an overall hydrolytic displacement reaction (15De Jong R.M.

In contrast, TrzN and AtzA each require a divalent metal ion to catalyze hydrolytic dehalogenation and thus differ mechanistically from other well studied halidohydrolases (4Topp E. Mulbry W.M.

TrzN and AtzA are both metalloenzymes of the amidohydrolase superfamily that contain zinc(II) and iron(II), respectively (11Shapir N. Pedersen C. Gil O. Strong L. Seffernick J. Sadowsky M.J.

Science. 1991; 252: 1278-1284Crossref PubMed Scopus (442) Google Scholar) and cytosine deaminase (18Ireton G.C. McDermott G. Black M.E. Stoddard B.L. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 315: 687-697Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar), catalyze hydrolytic deamination from diazine ring systems, which is somewhat comparable to hydrolytic dechlorination from an s-triazine ring substrate. Yet, AtzA has a high degree of substrate specificity, catalyzing only dehalogenation reactions (10Shapir N. Rosendahl C. Johnson G. Andreina M. Sadowsky M.J. Wackett L.P. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 2005; 71: 2214-2220Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). In contrast, TrzN has a broader substrate specificity and displaces thiomethyl and methoxy groups from the related s-triazine herbicides ametryn and atratone (2-methoxy-4-isopropylamino-6-ethylamino-1,3,5-triazine), respectively. TrzN has been demonstrated to be present in atrazine-degrading bacteria isolated from four different continents (9Shapir N. Mongodin E.F. Sadowsky M.J. Daugherty S.C. Nelson K.E. Wackett L.P. J. Bacteriol. 2007; 189: 674-682Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). TrzN has a higher kcat/Km for s-triazine herbicides than does AtzA, making it preferable for remediation of s-triazine herbicide contamination in natural and engineered environments. Here, we investigated the structural and catalytic properties of TrzN by analyzing three crystal structures and two sets of active site mutants. The 1.4 Å crystal structure of the wild-type enzyme reveals it to be a unique member of the amidohydrolase superfamily with a four-coordinate metal center and lacking an aspartate ligand present in other proteins in the amidohydrolase superfamily (20Seibert C.M. Raushel F.M. Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 6383-6391Crossref PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar). The aspartate in TrzN is replaced by a threonine residue that is within hydrogen-bonding distance to the zinc-bound water. In this regard, TrzN resembles carbonic anhydrase (CA). 2The abbreviations used are: CAcarbonic anhydraseADDAadenosine deaminaseCYDAcytosine deaminaseGUDAguanine deaminaseMOPS4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acidCAPS3-(cyclohexylamino)propanesulfonic acid. Crystal structures also were determined with a catalytically impaired TrzN-E241Q, containing bound ametryn or atratone, respectively. The data suggests that Glu241 in TrzN acts as a proton donor, a function comparable to the conserved glutamate in several other amidohydrolases. Taken together, these data provide insights into enzyme evolution of naturally occurring, substrate-specific enzymes that act to remove anthropogenic chemicals from the environment. carbonic anhydrase adenosine deaminase cytosine deaminase guanine deaminase 4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acid 3-(cyclohexylamino)propanesulfonic acid.

Initial cultures were grown at 37 °C. When cultures reached an optical density of 0.5 at 600 nm, they were transferred to 15 °C for 30 min without shaking. Both chaperonin and TrzN expression plasmids were induced, as described previously (11Shapir N. Pedersen C. Gil O. Strong L. Seffernick J. Sadowsky M.J. Wackett L.P. J.

For protein purification, all solutions contained a base buffer of 0.1 m sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.0, with 10% glycerol. The HisTrap chelating column was washed with 60 ml buffer, followed by three washes of 30, 30, and 60 ml with 0.15, 0.18, and 0.2 m imidazole, respectively. Enzyme was eluted from the column with 30 ml of 0.5 m imidazole, which subsequently was removed from the enzyme preparation via three 4–6 h of dialysis exchanges at 4 °C. The second exchange was supplemented with 65 μm ZnSO4. Atrazine, ametryn, and atratone were provided generously by Syngenta Crop Protection (Greensboro, NC). All other s-triazines used in this study were synthesized in our laboratory as described previously (19Seffernick J.L. Johnson G. Sadowsky M.J. Wackett L.P. Appl. Environ.

Two different crystal forms of atrazine chlorohydrolase (TrzN) were grown by the hanging drop method at 25 °C: 1) wild-type TrzN with Zn2+ and 2) TrzN mutant E241Q with Zn2+. The two crystal forms were obtained using different conditions for wild-type and mutant TrzN. For the crystal form of wild-type TrzN, the protein solution contained wild-type TrzN (21 mg/ml) in 25 mm MOPS (pH 5.5) and 1 mm ZnCl2; the precipitant contained 25% PEG 3350, 0.1 m Bis-Tris (pH 5.5), 0.2 m ammonium sulfate, and 1 mm ZnCl2. For this sample, crystals appeared in 7–8 days and exhibited diffraction consistent with the space group P21, with two molecules of the protein per asymmetric unit (Table 1, column 1). Prior to data collection, the crystals were transferred for ∼15 s to a cryoprotectant solution composed of the mother liquid and 20% glycerol. For TrzN-E241Q, the protein solution contained TrzN-E241Q (6.6 mg/ml) in 25 mm MOPS (pH 5.5) and 1 mm ZnCl2. The precipitant contained 30% PEG 4000, 0.1 m sodium citrate (pH 5.6), 0.2 m ammonium acetate, and 1 mm ZnCl2. For this sample, crystals appeared in 2 weeks and exhibited a diffraction pattern consistent with space group P21, with two molecules of the protein per asymmetric unit.TABLE 1Data collection and refinement statistics for crystals of the atrazine chlorohydrolase TrzN from Arthrobacter aurescens TC1WT TrzN·Zn2+TrzN-E241Q·Zn2+·atratoneTrzN-E241Q·Zn2+·ametrynData collection Space groupP21P21P21 No. of mol. in asymmetrical units222 Cell dimensionsa, b, c (Å)57.55, 102.62, 80.5557.38, 101.62, 80.7757.40, 100.84, 80.63β104.75°104.45°104.42° Resolution (Å)1.401.641.93 No. of unique reflections176,330108,28665,334 Rmerge0.0830.0710.066 I/σI19.922.324.1 Completeness (%)99.698.698.4Refinement Resolution (Å)25.0-1.4025.0-1.6425.0-1.93 Rcryst0.1680.1890.191 Rfree0.1890.2140.228 r.m.s.d.ar.m.s.d., root mean square deviation.Bond lengths (Å)0.0060.0060.006Bond angles1.1°1.3°1.0° No. of atomsProtein695869586958Waters765431189Inhibitor01515Zn2+ ions222 PDB codebPDB, Protein Data Bank.3LS93LSC3LSBa r.m.s.d., root mean square deviation.b PDB, Protein Data Bank. Open table in a new tab The TrzN substrates atratone and ametryn are relatively insoluble. Therefore, powders of these compounds were used for soaking experiments. The crystal containing TrzN-E241Q was soaked for 1 h in cryobuffer composed of its mother liquid, 15% glycerol, and excess of the atratone powder (Table 1, column 2). Another crystal containing TrzN-E241Q was soaked for 4 h in cryobuffer composed of its mother liquid, 15% glycerol, and excess of the ametryn powder (Table 1, column 3). After incubations in their corresponding cryobuffers, the crystals of all three TrzN crystal forms (Table 1) were flash-cooled in a nitrogen stream. All 3 x-ray diffraction data sets were collected at the NSLS X4A beamline (Brookhaven National Laboratory) on an Area Detection Systems Corporation (Posway, CA) charge-coupled device detector. Diffraction intensities were integrated and scaled with programs DENZO and SCALEPACK (25Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Carter C.W.J. Sweet R.M. Abelson J.N. Simon M.I. Methods in Enzymology. Academic Pres, New York1997: 307-326Google Scholar). The data collection statistics are given in Table 1. The structures of all three TrzN crystal forms (Table 1, columns 1–3) were solved by molecular replacement, using the fully automated molecular replacement pipeline BALBES (26Long F. Vagin A. Young P. Murshudov G.N. Acta. Crystallogr. D. 2008; 64: 125-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (635) Google Scholar), using only input diffraction and sequence data. The protein part of putative cytosine deaminase (Protein Data Bank code 2PAJ) was used by BALBES as a template in all three structure determinations. Partially refined structures of all three TrzN forms (Table 1, columns 1–3) were the outputs from BALBES without any manual intervention. Subsequently, several iterative cycles of refinement were performed for each crystal form, including the model rebuilding with COOT (27Emsley P. Cowtan K. Acta. Crystallogr. D. 2004; 60: 2126-2132Crossref PubMed Scopus (23597) Google Scholar), refinement with PHENIX (28Adams P.D. Afonine P.V. Bunkoczi G.V.B.C. Davis I.W. Echols N. Headd J.J. Hung L.W. Kapral G.J.

D. 1993; 49: 129-147Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Crystallographic refinement statistics for all determined TrzN structures are provided in Table 1. The model of the wild-type TrzN was refined at 1.4 Å with an Rcryst of 0.168 and an Rfree of 0.189. The final structure contained protein residues 1–453 and one well defined Zn2+ ion in each monomer of the dimer. The model of the TrzN-E241Q-atratone complex was refined at 1.64Å with an Rcryst of 0.189 and an Rfree of 0.214. The final structure contained protein residues 1–453 and one well defined Zn2+ ion in each monomer of the dimer. The first monomer of the dimer contained a well defined atratone molecule bound in the active site. Because the density for the atratone molecule bound in the active site of the second monomer was weak, the second atratone molecule was not included in the final model. The model of TrzN-E241Q-ametryn complex was refined at 1.93 Å with an Rcryst of 0.191 and Rfree of 0.228. The final structure contained protein residues 1–453 and one well defined Zn2+ ion in each monomer of the dimer. Only the first monomer of the dimer contained an ametryn molecule bound in the active site. The electron density for ametryn was weaker than for atratone molecule in the previous structure. Final crystallographic refinement statistics for the three TrzN structures are listed in Table 1. Standard protein concentrations were determined with the Protein Assay Dye Reagent in accordance with manufacturer's instructions (Bio-Rad). Activity assays for atrazine and ametryn were conducted as described previously (11Shapir N. Pedersen C. Gil O. Strong L. Seffernick J. Sadowsky M.J. Wackett L.P. J. Bacteriol. 2006; 188: 5859-5864Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar), whereas activity assays for atratone were analyzed via high pressure liquid chromatography as described previously (12de Souza M.L. Sadowsky M.J. Wackett L.P. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 4894-4900Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Kinetic constants were calculated in 0.1 m sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.0, from initial hydrolysis rates at 7–10 different substrate concentrations, ranging from 1.5–150 mm. All samples were done in triplicate. Control samples without enzyme were analyzed in parallel, and no spontaneous activity was observed. Apparent Km and Vmax values were estimated by nonlinear regression according to the Michaelis-Menten equation: ν0 = (Vmax × [S])/(Km + [S]), using GraphPad Prism software (version 5). Steady-state rate measurements were determined at different pH values as described above with 150 mm atrazine or ametryn in the following 100 mm buffers: sodium acetate (pH 4 and 5), sodium phosphate (pH 6, 7, and 8), borate (pH 9), and CAPS (pH 10 and 11). The QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) was used to make all mutants. The following primers were used to construct the mutants: T325S, 5′-GGGTTTGGAACGAGCGGGTCCGCCAGC-3′ and 5′-GCTGGCGGACCCGCTCGTTCCAAACCC-3′; T325D, 5′-GGGTTTGGAACGGACGGGTCCGCCAGC-3′ and 5′-GCTGGCGGACCCGTCCGTTCCAAACCC-3′; T325E, 5′-CGGTTGGGTTTGGAACGGAAGGGTCCGCCAGCAACG-3′ and 5′-CGTTGCTGGCGGACCCTTCCGTTCCAAACCCAACCG-3′; E241Q, 5′-GCCTCCACACCCACTTCTACCAACCGCTCGACGC-3′ and 5′-GCGTCGAGCGGTTGGTAGAAGTGGGTGTGGAGGC-3′; and Y67F, 5′-CACCAGCACCTGTTCGAAGGCGCAATG-3′ and 5′-CATTGCGCCTTCGAACAGGTGCTGGTG-3′. Proteins in the amidohydrolase superfamily almost invariably contain one or two catalytically essential divalent metal atoms per enzyme subunit (20Seibert C.M. Raushel F.M. Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 6383-6391Crossref PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar). Using a network clustering of amino acid sequences with a cutoff of e−5, TrzN clustered with the monometallic amidohydrolases that include guanine deaminases and s-triazine-metabolizing enzymes (Fig. 2A). Results shown in Fig. 2B use a more stringent cutoff of e−38 to reveal the divergence of annotated guanine deaminases and the s-triazine-metabolizing enzymes. TrzN is shown to be closely related to the protein cluster that includes melamine deaminases (TriA and TrzA) and the other atrazine chlorohydrolase (AtzA), catabolic enzymes that are thought to have evolved their function recently (11Shapir N. Pedersen C. Gil O. Strong L. Seffernick J. Sadowsky M.J. Wackett L.P. J. Bacteriol. 2006; 188: 5859-5864Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 2B, the closest relative to TrzN is AtzB, hydroxyatrazine N-ethylaminohydrolase. However, these two proteins only share 31% sequence identity, demonstrating that TrzN is quite divergent from all other characterized amidohydrolases. The proteins represented by the light blue circles are proteins of unknown function. However, Tm0936 (accession no. 1P1M_A) from Thermotoga maritima is one protein in that cluster with a known function and catalyzes the deamination of 5-methylthioadenosine, S-adenosyl-l-homocysteine, and adenosine (30Hermann J.C. Marti-Arbona R. Fedorov A.A. Fedorov E. Almo S.C. Shoichet B.K. Raushel F.M. Nature. 2007; 448: 775-779Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar). This adenosine deaminase is thought to have evolved independently and not directly from the cluster of adenosine deaminases shown in Fig. 2A. This clustering (shown in light blue) represents proteins most closely related to the s-triazine metabolizing enzymes and may represent a lobe of the amidohydrolase superfamily with great functional plasticity. Solving the TrzN crystal structure to 1.4 Å resolution (Fig. 3) allowed a more detailed comparison with other closely related amidohydrolase superfamily members. Though reported to be monomeric in solution (11Shapir N. Pedersen C. Gil O. Strong L. Seffernick J. Sadowsky M.J. Wackett L.P. J. Bacteriol. 2006; 188: 5859-5864Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar), TrzN crystallized as a dimer. The difference in oligomeric configuration may be due to pH and ionic strength differences between crystallization conditions and those used for gel-filtration studies. The dimer consists of two separate subunits that interact along one side of the barrel. The loop and α helix region from residues 408–432, an α helix from residues 348–363, and a loop from residues 85–94 together comprise much of the dimer interface. The active sites of both subunits are accessible in the dimeric form. The N-terminal 54 amino acid residues make up two β sheets that are external to the barrel and, when looking down the axis of the (βα)8 barrel, are located behind the floor of the barrel (Fig. 3, magenta). Monometallic superfamily members often have three histidines and an aspartate residue as metal ligands scattered in conserved locations throughout the linear sequence of the protein (Fig. 4A). In those proteins, water serves as a fifth metal ligand. A fourth histidine serves as a base and interacts with a metal-coordinated water or hydroxide ion to facilitate nucleophilic attack on the substrate (31Sideraki V. Wilson D.K. Kurz L.C. Quiocho F.A. Rudolph F.B. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 15019-15028Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). The linear sequence of TrzN has the four conserved histidine residues but lacks the conserved aspartate that typically serves as a metal ligand (Fig. 4A). A threonine residue (Thr325) in TrzN aligns with the conserved aspartate. Superposition of the TrzN structure with those of three structurally defined amidohydrolase superfamily proteins showed that the functional atoms in the histidine metal ligands are nearly superimposable (Fig. 4B). Although the threonine is in the same region as the corresponding aspartate residues in other superfamily members (Fig. 4B), the threonine oxygen is 3.3 Å from the zinc and is too distant to be a metal ligand. This compares to an Asp-metal distance of 2.3–2.5 Å in the other amidohydrolases shown in Table 2. Thus, TrzN has a different metal coordination environment than other amidohydrolases. Typically, the mononuclear metal centers in the amidohydrolases are five-coordinate, whereas in TrzN, the metal is four-coordinate. Angles between metal-water-histidine ligands His63, His65, and His238 are 108.8, 120.4, and 107.6, respectively. The histidine ligand-zinc-histidine ligand angles range from 100.6–115.5 °. This geometry forms an irregular tetrahedron. Table 2 compares active site distances in TrzN with some of the most well studied mononuclear amidohydrolase superfamily members: adenosine deaminase (ADDA, Protein Data Bank code 1A4M), cytosine deaminase (CYDA, Protein Data Bank code 1K70), guanine deaminase (GUDA, Protein Data Bank code 2UZ9), and Tm0936, a protein crystallized from a structural genomics project from Thermatoga maritima (2PLM). The distances in TrzN shown in Table 2 are within the range of other amidohydrolase members with the exception of Thr325.TABLE 2Comparison of amidohydrolase superfamily member structural distancesADDA (1A4M)CYDA (1K70)GUDA (2UZ9)Tm0936 (2PLM)TrzNHis ligands to metal (three His ligands)2.2–2.52.1–2.42.3–2.42.1–2.22.0–2.1Asp ligand/Thr to metal2.42.52.32.33.3His (water-activating) to metal4.23.73.83.74.1MetalZnFeZnZnZnMetal to wateraThe appropriate oxygens in the inhibitor 6-hydroxy-1,6-dihydro purine nucleoside, transition state analog 4-hydroxy-3,4-dihydro-1H-pyrimidin-2-one and product xanthine were used in the cases of adenosine, cytosine, and guanine deaminases, respectively, as these compounds replace the active site water.2.12.03.02.02.0Asp ligand/Thr to wateraThe appropriate oxygens in the inhibitor 6-hydroxy-1,6-dihydro purine nucleoside, transition state analog 4-hydroxy-3,4-dihydro-1H-pyrimidin-2-one and product xanthine were used in the cases of adenosine, cytosine, and guanine deaminases, respectively, as these compounds replace the active site water.2.82.93.42.72.6His (water-activating) to wateraThe appropriate oxygens in the inhib"
https://openalex.org/W1982629480,"The Janzen-Connell hypothesis proposes that seed and seedling enemies play a major role in maintaining high levels of tree diversity in tropical forests. However, human disturbance may alter guilds of seed predators including their body size distribution. These changes have the potential to affect seedling survival in logged forest and may alter forest composition and diversity.We manipulated seed density in plots beneath con- and heterospecific adult trees within a logged forest and excluded vertebrate predators of different body sizes using cages. We show that small and large-bodied predators differed in their effect on con- and heterospecific seedling mortality. In combination small and large-bodied predators dramatically decreased both con- and heterospecific seedling survival. In contrast, when larger-bodied predators were excluded small-bodied predators reduced conspecific seed survival leaving seeds coming from the distant tree of a different species.Our results suggest that seed survival is affected differently by vertebrate predators according to their body size. Therefore, changes in the body size structure of the seed predator community in logged forests may change patterns of seed mortality and potentially affect recruitment and community composition."
https://openalex.org/W2075636751,"Rising antibiotic resistance among Escherichia coli, the leading cause of urinary tract infections (UTIs), has placed a new focus on molecular pathogenesis studies, aiming to identify new therapeutic targets. Anti-virulence agents are attractive as chemotherapeutics to attenuate an organism during disease but not necessarily during benign commensalism, thus decreasing the stress on beneficial microbial communities and lessening the emergence of resistance. We and others have demonstrated that the K antigen capsule of E. coli is a preeminent virulence determinant during UTI and more invasive diseases. Components of assembly and export are highly conserved among the major K antigen capsular types associated with UTI-causing E. coli and are distinct from the capsule biogenesis machinery of many commensal E. coli, making these attractive therapeutic targets. We conducted a screen for anti-capsular small molecules and identified an agent designated “C7” that blocks the production of K1 and K5 capsules, unrelated polysaccharide types among the Group 2–3 capsules. Herein lies proof-of-concept that this screen may be implemented with larger chemical libraries to identify second-generation small-molecule inhibitors of capsule biogenesis. These inhibitors will lead to a better understanding of capsule biogenesis and may represent a new class of therapeutics."
https://openalex.org/W2026122131,"Activation of NF-κB transcription factors by locally produced angiotensin II (Ang II) is proposed to be involved in chronic inflammatory reactions leading to atherosclerosis development. However, a clear understanding of the signaling cascades coupling the Ang II AT1 receptors to the activation of NF-κB transcription factors is still lacking. Using primary cultured aortic vascular smooth muscle cells, we show that activation of the IKK complex and NF-κB transcription factors by Ang II is regulated by phosphorylation of the catalytic subunit IKKβ on serine residues 177 and 181 in the activation T-loop. The use of pharmacological inhibitors against conventional protein kinases C (PKCs), mitogen-activated/extracellular signal-regulated kinase (MEK) 1/2, ribosomal S6 kinase (RSK), and silencing RNA technology targeting PKCα, IKKβ subunit, tumor growth factor β-activating kinase-1 (TAK1), the E3 ubiquitin ligase tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated factor-6 (TRAF6), and RSK isoforms, demonstrates the requirement of two distinct signaling pathway for the phosphorylation of IKKβ and the activation of the IKK complex by Ang II. Rapid phosphorylation of IKKβ requires a second messenger-dependent pathway composed of PKCα-TRAF6-TAK1, whereas sustained phosphorylation and activation of IKKβ requires the MEK1/2-ERK1/2-RSK pathway. Importantly, simultaneously targeting components of these two pathways completely blunts the phosphorylation of IKKβ and the proinflammatory effect of the octapeptide. This is the first report demonstrating activation of TAK1 by the AT1R. We propose a model whereby TRAF6-TAK1 and ERK-RSK intracellular pathways independently and sequentially converge to the T-loop phosphorylation for full activation of IKKβ, which is an essential step in the proinflammatory activity of Ang II. Activation of NF-κB transcription factors by locally produced angiotensin II (Ang II) is proposed to be involved in chronic inflammatory reactions leading to atherosclerosis development. However, a clear understanding of the signaling cascades coupling the Ang II AT1 receptors to the activation of NF-κB transcription factors is still lacking. Using primary cultured aortic vascular smooth muscle cells, we show that activation of the IKK complex and NF-κB transcription factors by Ang II is regulated by phosphorylation of the catalytic subunit IKKβ on serine residues 177 and 181 in the activation T-loop. The use of pharmacological inhibitors against conventional protein kinases C (PKCs), mitogen-activated/extracellular signal-regulated kinase (MEK) 1/2, ribosomal S6 kinase (RSK), and silencing RNA technology targeting PKCα, IKKβ subunit, tumor growth factor β-activating kinase-1 (TAK1), the E3 ubiquitin ligase tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated factor-6 (TRAF6), and RSK isoforms, demonstrates the requirement of two distinct signaling pathway for the phosphorylation of IKKβ and the activation of the IKK complex by Ang II. Rapid phosphorylation of IKKβ requires a second messenger-dependent pathway composed of PKCα-TRAF6-TAK1, whereas sustained phosphorylation and activation of IKKβ requires the MEK1/2-ERK1/2-RSK pathway. Importantly, simultaneously targeting components of these two pathways completely blunts the phosphorylation of IKKβ and the proinflammatory effect of the octapeptide. This is the first report demonstrating activation of TAK1 by the AT1R. We propose a model whereby TRAF6-TAK1 and ERK-RSK intracellular pathways independently and sequentially converge to the T-loop phosphorylation for full activation of IKKβ, which is an essential step in the proinflammatory activity of Ang II.

Through binding of the Ang II receptor subtype 1 (AT1R), Ang II controls saltwater and blood pressure homeostasis (1de Gasparo M. Catt K.J. Inagami T. Wright J.W. Unger T. Pharmacol. Rev. 2000; 52: 415-472PubMed Google Scholar). Components of the RAS are also found within several tissues where locally produced Ang II acts as a cytokine, modulating cellular responses in paracrine and autocrine fashions (2Bader M. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 2010; 50: 439-465Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar). Tissue RAS also contributes to homeostatic responses. However, deregulated and chronic production of tissue Ang II may be an important mechanism linking uncontrolled activation of local RAS to cardiovascular diseases (3Paul M. Poyan Mehr A. Kreutz R. Physiol. Rev. 2006; 86: 747-803Crossref PubMed Scopus (1333) Google Scholar, 4Lee M.A. Böhm M. Paul M. Ganten D. Circulation. 1993; 87: IV7-13PubMed Google Scholar). Regardless of the synthesis pathway, numerous studies have clearly established the effects of Ang II on vascular remodeling events such as atherosclerosis and hypertrophy, which are mediated in part by the growth and inflammatory properties of the octapeptide on vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMC) (5Zhang L. Cheng J. Ma Y. Thomas W. Zhang J. Du J. Circ. Res. 2005; 97: 975-982Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 6Zhang L. Ma Y. Zhang J. Cheng J. Du J. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc.

As such, we previously demonstrated that the hypertrophic property of Ang II in VSMC is largely dependent on the MEK-ERK signaling cascade and the incapacity of the octapeptide to down-regulate the cell cycle inhibitor p27Kip1 (7Servant M.J. Coulombe P. Turgeon B. Meloche S. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 148: 543-556Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar, 8Servant M.J. Giasson E. Meloche S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 16047-16052Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). Another important signaling pathway that is often involved in chronic inflammatory diseases is the NF-κB pathway (see Refs. 9Karin M. Proc. Am. Thorac. Soc. 2005; 2 (Discussion 394–385): 386-390Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar, 10Karin M. Greten F.R. Nat. Rev.

Cell. 2006; 124: 823-835Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (754) Google Scholar for reviews). Indeed, aberrant NF-κB regulation has been described in human atherosclerotic plaques (14Monaco C. Andreakos E. Kiriakidis S. Mauri C. Bicknell C. Foxwell B. Cheshire N. Paleolog E. Feldmann M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2004; 101: 5634-5639Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar, 15de Winther M.P. Kanters E. Kraal G. Hofker M.H. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc.

Kotsaki E. Xanthoulea S. van der Made I. Gijbels M.J. Kardakaris R. Polykratis A. Kollias G. de Winther M.P. Pasparakis M. Cell Metab. 2008; 8: 372-383Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar). This observation possibly highlights that many processes affecting the formation of atherosclerotic plaques converge to the activation of NF-κB transcription factors (15de Winther M.P. Kanters E. Kraal G. Hofker M.H. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2005; 25: 904-914Crossref PubMed Scopus (468) Google Scholar). angiotensin II Ang II AT1 receptor renin angiotensin system vascular smooth muscle cells IκB kinase ribosomal S6 kinase tumor growth factor β activating kinase-1 TNF receptor-associated factor-6 phospholipase C NF-κB inducing kinase lysophosphatidic acid G protein-coupled-receptors 1,2-bis(2-aminophenoxy)ethane-N,N,N′,N′-tetraacetic acid dimethyl sulfoxide dominant-negative. The NF-κB family is represented by five members: p50, p65(RelA), c-Rel, p52, and RelB. In resting cells, they exist as homo- or heterodimers that are sequestered in the cytoplasm in an inactive form through their association with one of several inhibitory molecules, namely IκB-α, -β, -ϵ, p105, and p100. In the classical pathway, the first phase of NF-κB activation mainly consists of the regulated degradation of IκBα and is triggered by prototypical activators such as tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α, lipopolysaccharide, IL-1β, and phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate. These stimuli induce the phosphorylation of IκBα at Ser32 and Ser36 in the N-terminal signal responsive domain by the canonical IκB kinase (IKK) complex, which is composed of two catalytic subunits called IKKα and -β, and one regulatory subunit called IKKγ. Phosphorylated IκBα is subsequently polyubiquitinated and targeted to the 26 S proteasome complex, resulting in the release and nuclear accumulation of NF-κB, which can now stimulate target gene transcription (17Vallabhapurapu S. Karin M. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2009; 27: 693-733Crossref PubMed Scopus (2022) Google Scholar). The IKK complex can also modulate the activity of the NF-κB pathway by directly targeting p65 (RelA) and c-Rel subunits (17Vallabhapurapu S. Karin M. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2009; 27: 693-733Crossref PubMed Scopus (2022) Google Scholar). Notably, we and others have shown that the signaling cascade coupling the engagement of the AT1R to an inflammatory response involving NF-κB transcription factors required activation of the IKKβ subunit (5Zhang L. Cheng J. Ma Y. Thomas W. Zhang J. Du J. Circ. Res. 2005; 97: 975-982Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 18Douillette A. Bibeau-Poirier A. Gravel S.P. Clément J.F. Chénard V. Moreau P. Servant M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 13275-13284Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Due to the importance of the IKK/NF-κB module in several pathologies, the intricacy of IKK complex activation and modulation is currently under intensive investigation (19Skaug B. Jiang X. Chen Z.J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2009; 78: 769-796Crossref PubMed Scopus (405) Google Scholar, 20Grabiner B.C. Blonska M. Lin P.C. You Y. Wang D. Sun J. Darnay B.G. Dong C. Lin X. Genes Dev. 2007; 21: 984-996Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar, 21Xia Z.P. Sun L. Chen X. Pineda G. Jiang X. Adhikari A. Zeng W. Chen Z.J.

Cell. 2009; 36: 302-314Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). Like many protein kinases, both IKKα and IKKβ contain activation loops that need to be phosphorylated to become activated (23Delhase M. Hayakawa M. Chen Y. Karin M. Science. 1999; 284: 309-313Crossref PubMed Scopus (745) Google Scholar). Replacement of these phosphoacceptor sites within the T-loop in IKKβ (Ser177/Ser181) with alanines (IKKβ(AA)) prevents kinase activation, and thus, when overexpressed, acts in a dominant-negative fashion and prevents IKK complex and NF-κB activation (23Delhase M. Hayakawa M. Chen Y. Karin M. Science. 1999; 284: 309-313Crossref PubMed Scopus (745) Google Scholar). Importantly, both serines are phosphorylated in vivo in response to pro-inflammatory stimuli (23Delhase M. Hayakawa M. Chen Y. Karin M. Science. 1999; 284: 309-313Crossref PubMed Scopus (745) Google Scholar). IKKα also becomes phosphorylated at the corresponding serines (Ser176/Ser180) during cell stimulation. However, in most cell types, IKKα phosphorylation and activation is less critical than IKKβ (24Hu Y. Baud V. Delhase M. Zhang P. Deerinck T. Ellisman M. Johnson R. Karin M. Science. 1999; 284: 316-320Crossref PubMed Scopus (707) Google Scholar, 25Li Z.W. Chu W. Hu Y. Delhase M. Deerinck T. Ellisman M. Johnson R. Karin M. J. Exp. Med. 1999; 189: 1839-1845Crossref PubMed Scopus (815) Google Scholar). In addition to phosphorylation, Lys63-linked polyubiquitination is another essential covalent modification required for IKK complex activation by membrane-bound receptors (19Skaug B. Jiang X. Chen Z.J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2009; 78: 769-796Crossref PubMed Scopus (405) Google Scholar). Lys63-linked polyubiquitination reactions are proposed to create docking platforms for the recruitment and the activation of the IKK complex (through Lys63-linked IKKγ polyubiquitination) as well as for the activation of two mitogen-activated protein (MAP)-kinase-kinase-kinase (MAPKKK) family members, namely MEKK3 and TAK1 (19Skaug B. Jiang X. Chen Z.J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2009; 78: 769-796Crossref PubMed Scopus (405) Google Scholar). These two protein kinases act as IKK-activating kinases (that induce IKKβ phosphorylation in the T-loop) (17Vallabhapurapu S. Karin M. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2009; 27: 693-733Crossref PubMed Scopus (2022) Google Scholar, 19Skaug B. Jiang X. Chen Z.J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2009; 78: 769-796Crossref PubMed Scopus (405) Google Scholar). Genetic data about the molecular links between GPCR proximal events and activation of the IKK complex now demonstrate that a complex formed by CARMA3, Bcl10, and MALT1, better known as the CBM signalosome, constitute the missing link between G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) and IKK complex activation (20Grabiner B.C. Blonska M. Lin P.C. You Y. Wang D. Sun J. Darnay B.G. Dong C. Lin X. Genes Dev. 2007; 21: 984-996Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar, 26McAllister-Lucas L.M. Ruland J. Siu K. Jin X. Gu S.

U.S.A. 2007; 104: 134-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). In this complex, the ubiquitin E3 ligase MALT1 could act as the effector protein in AT1R signaling by inducing Lys63-linked IKKγ polyubiquitination and IKK complex activation (26McAllister-Lucas L.M. Ruland J. Siu K. Jin X. Gu S. Kim D.S. Kuffa P. Kohrt D. Mak T.W. Nuñez G. Lucas P.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2007; 104: 139-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). On the other hand, in T cell receptor signaling, the E3 ubiquitin ligase TRAF6 and TAK1 act downstream of Bcl10 and MALT1 in mediating IKK complex activation (29Sun L. Deng L. Ea C.K. Xia Z.P. Chen Z.J. Mol. Cell. 2004; 14: 289-301Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (565) Google Scholar). Thus, the identification of the E3 ubiquitin ligase and the IKK-activating kinase involved in coupling the AT1R to the activation of the IKK complex is still unknown. The present study was undertaken to characterize the signaling cascades controlling the phosphorylation and activation of the IKK complex in primary VSMC exposed to Ang II. Angiotensin II was purchased from Sigma; platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF)-BB and TNF-α were purchased from BioSource (Camarillo, CA). The MEK1/2 inhibitors UO126 and PD184352, the PKCα/β inhibitor Gö6976, and the intracellular calcium-specific chelator BAPTA-AM were purchased from Calbiochem (Gibbstown, NJ). The selective RSK inhibitor BI-D1870 was kindly donated by Dr. Philippe Roux (Université de Montréal). p100 polyclonal antibody was a gift from Dr. John Hiscott (McGill University). The commercial antibodies were purchased from the following suppliers: anti-IKKα/β (SC-7607) and anti-TAK1 (SC-948) from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA); anti-TRAF6 (IMG-5654-2) from Imgenex (San Diago, CA); anti-β-actin clone AC-74 (A5316) from Sigma; phospho-TAK1 (Thr184/Thr187) antibody (number 4531), anti-TAK1 (number 4505), phospho-IKKα/β (Ser180/Ser181) antibody (number 2681), phospho-ERK1/2 (Thr202–Tyr204) antibody (number 9101), anti-ERK1/2 (number 9102), anti-PKCα (number 2056), anti-RSK1/2/3 (number 9347), and anti-NIK (number 7211) from Cell Signaling Technology (Beverly, MA). Glutathione S-transferase (GST)-IκBα (amino acids 1–54) has been described (18Douillette A. Bibeau-Poirier A. Gravel S.P. Clément J.F. Chénard V. Moreau P. Servant M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 13275-13284Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). The GST-IKKβ T-loop (amino acids 125–208) recombinant protein was produced by subcloning PCR-amplified fragments in pGEX-KG. The resulting construct was transformed in Escherichia coli and following isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) induction (1 mm for 3 h at 37 °C), purified over a glutathione-agarose column (Amersham Biosciences). The expression plasmid pTrack-FLAG-IKKβ (K44A), the pRL-TK, and the luciferase NF-κB reporter, pLuc-(PRDII)2, were provided by Dr. John Hiscott (McGill University, Montreal, QC). The pCDNA3.1-HA-AT1R plasmid was kindly donated by Dr. Stéphane Laporte (McGill University, Montreal, QC). The pCMVT-TAK1 K63W plasmid was provided by Dr. Jun Ninomiya-Tsuji (North Carolina State University, Raleigh, NC). The expression construct pCMV5-MEKK3 WT was obtained from Gary L. Johnson and purchased through Addgene (Cambridge, MA) (plasmid 12186). From this vector, the pCMV5-MEKK3 K391M plasmid was produced by site-directed mutagenesis. Low passage primary rat aortic VSMCs were obtained from Dr. Darren Richard (Hôtel-Dieu de Québec, QC, Canada) and grown in high glucose DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS). Cultures were maintained at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere of 95% air and 5% CO. All experiments were conducted on cells at passage levels 9–16. Quiescent VSMCs were obtained by incubation of 95% confluent cell cultures in serum-free high glucose DMEM, Ham's F-12 (1:1) supplemented with 15 mm Hepes (pH 7.4), 0.1% low endotoxin bovine serum albumin (Sigma), and 5 μg/ml of transferrin (Sigma) for 48 h. For experiments with pharmacological inhibitors, the cells were treated with vehicle alone or with the indicated concentrations of inhibitors for 30 min before addition of Ang II. QbI-HEK 293A cells, purchased from Q-Biogene (Carisbad, CA), were cultured in high glucose DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS. QbI-HEK 293A in 24 wells (100 000 cells/well) were transfected by calcium phosphate coprecipitation method with 50 ng of pRLTK reporter (Renilla luciferase for internal control), 100 ng of pCDNA3.1-HA-AT1R, 200 ng of NF-κB reporter (pLUC-PRDII), and an increasing amount of the dominant-negative forms of pTrack-FLAG-IKKβ K44A, pCMVT-TAK1 K63W, or pCMV5-MEKK3 K391M. Cells were harvested at 72 h posttransfection, lysed in passive lysis buffer (Promega, Madison, WI), and assayed for dual-luciferase activity with use of 10 μl of lysate according to the manufacturer's instructions. All firefly luciferase values were normalized to Renilla luciferase to control for transfection efficiency. Total RNA was isolated using TRIzol (Invitrogen), DNase-treated (Sigma), and reverse transcribed (1 μg) with the SuperScript VILO cDNA Synthesis Kit (Invitrogen, Burlington, ON) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Real time PCRs were subsequently performed using Platinum SYBR Green qPCR SuperMix-UDG (Invitrogen) with the following forward and reverse primers: rat interleukin (IL6), 5′-TCCTACCCCAACTTCCAATGCTC-3′, 5′-TTGGATGGTCTTGGTCCTTAGCC-3′; rat 18S, 5′-GGGAGGTAGTGACGAAAAATAACAAT-3′, 5′-TTGCCCTCCAATGGATCCT-3′; human IL8, 5′-CTCTCTTGGCAGCCTTCCTGATT-3′, 5′-AACTTCTCCACAACCCTCTGCAC-3′; human β-actin, 5′-AACTCCATCATGAAGTGTGACG-3′, 5′-GATCCACATCTGCTGGAAGG-3′. qPCRs were performed using the following schedule: denaturation was performed for 5 min at 95 °C with 15 s between each cycle; annealing was performed for 20 s at 55 °C for 18S, at 60 °C for β-actin, and at 65 °C for IL6 and IL8; primer extension was done for 25 s at 72 °C. VSMCs were transfected with 20 nm siRNA duplexes using Dharmafect 3 reagent. The ON-TARGET plus siRNA targeting PKCα (siRNA1, 5′-GGAGAGAGAUGACGUACGA-3′; siRNA2, 5′-GGAAUGAGUCCUUCACGUU-3′), TAK1 (siRNA1, 5′-GGUGAUAACACGCCGGAAA-3′; siRNA2, 5′-AUACCAAUGGCUCGGAUAA-3′; siRNA3, 5′-CAUAUCAGGCAACGGGCAA-3′; siRNA4, 5′-CUGAAAUAGAAGCGAGGAU-3′), TRAF6 (siRNA1, 5′-GAGAACAGAUGCCUAAUCA-3′; siRNA2, 5′-GGACAAAGUUGCCGAGAUG-3′; siRNA3, 5′-GUGUUUGGCUGUCACGAAA-3′; siRNA4, 5′-AGAGCAUGCAUGUGAGCGA-3′), RSK1 (5′-UCGAGAUUCUUCUGCGGUA-3′), RSK2 (5′-GGAAUAAGCUGUAUCGCAA-3′), RSK3 (5′-CAGAUUAGGUGCCGGACCA-3′), and IKKβ (5′-AAACCAGCAUCCAGAUUGA-3′) were purchased from Dharmacon (Lafayette, CO). After the different treatments, cells were washed twice with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), and whole cell extracts were prepared using Triton X-100 lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 50 mm sodium fluoride, 5 mm EDTA, 40 mm β-glycerophosphate, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 10−4 m phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10−6 m leupeptin, 10−6 m pepstatin A, 1% Triton X-100, 10% glycerol) for 30 min at 4 °C. Lysates were clarified by centrifugation at 13,000 × g for 10 min, and equal amounts of lysate proteins (30–60 μg) were subjected to electrophoresis on 7.5 or 12% acrylamide gels. Proteins were electrophoretically transferred to Hybond-C nitrocellulose membranes (Amersham Biosciences) in 25 mm Tris, 192 mm glycine, and 20% methanol. Immunoblot analysis for each antibody was carried out according to the manufacturer's instructions. In some Western blot experiments, cellular extracts were equally divided (μg) and used in parallel. The phosphotransferase activity of the IKK complex and TAK1 was measured as described previously (18Douillette A. Bibeau-Poirier A. Gravel S.P. Clément J.F. Chénard V. Moreau P. Servant M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 13275-13284Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Briefly, 500 μg of whole cell extracts were incubated for 4 h at 4 °C with specific antibody to IKKα/β (SC-7607) or TAK1 (SC-948) preabsorbed to protein A-Sepharose beads. The immune complexes were washed twice with lysis buffer and twice with kinase buffer (20 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 25 mm NaCl, 1 mm EGTA, 20 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol (DTT), 5 mm p-nitrophenyl phosphate, 20 mm β-glycerophosphate, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 10−4 m phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). IKK complex and TAK1 activities were assayed by resuspending the beads in 40 μl of kinase buffer containing 2 μg of GST-IκBα (amino acids 1–54) for IKK complex or GST-IKKβ T-loop (amino acids 125–208) for TAK1, 20 μm ATP, and 20 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP. The reactions were incubated at 30 °C for 60 min and stopped by the addition of 5× Laemmli's sample buffer. The samples were analyzed by SDS-gel electrophoresis. Following Coomassie staining, the gels were dried and exposed to a gel documentation device (Typhoon scanner 9410, Amersham Biosciences) for imaging and quantification. After the different treatments, VSMCs were washed with ice-cold PBS and resuspended in 200 μl of buffer A (10 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 10 mm KCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, 1 mm sodium fluoride, 20 mm β-glycerophosphate, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 10−4 m phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10−6 m leupeptin, and 10−6 m pepstatin A). The cells were incubated on ice for 15 min. Nonidet P-40 (10%) was added to a final concentration of 0.5%; the cells were vortexed vigorously and centrifuged for 30 s at 4 °C. The nuclear pellets were washed in 100 μl of buffer A and centrifuged for 30 s at 4 °C. The pellets were then resuspended in 50 μl of 20 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 0.4 m NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 10−4 m phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10−6 m leupeptin, and 10−6 m pepstatin A and incubated on ice for 20 min. Supernatants were collected after a centrifugation of 10 min at 4 °C. 10 μg of nuclear extracts were subjected to EMSA with the NF-κB oligonucleotide: 5′-ACCAAGAGGGATTTCACCTAAATC-3′ and the NF-κB 5X binding buffer (25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 5 mm EDTA, 125 μg/ml of poly(dI:dC), 5 mm DTT, 1 mg/ml of BSA, 30% glycerol). In each reaction, 500,000 cpm of [γ-32P]ATP-labeled probe was used, and bandshifts were resolved on 5% polyacrylamide gels in 0.5× TBE running buffer. Statistical analysis was performed using GraphPad Prism version 5.0 for Mac (GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA). Comparison of two groups was carried out using a two-tailed unpaired t test, and comparison of more than two groups was carried out with one-way analysis of variance and a Bonferroni post-test. Statistical significance was accepted at a p value below 0.05. The number of independent experiments is denoted by n. We and others have recently demonstrated AT1R-mediated activation of the IKK complex in primary VSMC exposed to Ang II (5Zhang L. Cheng J. Ma Y. Thomas W. Zhang J. Du J. Circ. Res. 2005; 97: 975-982Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 18Douillette A. Bibeau-Poirier A. Gravel S.P. Clément J.F. Chénard V. Moreau P. Servant M.J. J. Biol.

Other studies have rather suggested a role of the noncanonical pathway, mediated by the MAPKKK family member NF-κB-inducing kinase (NIK) and IKKα, in the proinflammatory effect of Ang II (30Choudhary S. Lu M. Cui R. Brasier A.R. Mol. Endocrinol. 2007; 21: 2203-2217Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar, 31Wu L. Iwai M. Li Z. Li J.M. Mogi M. Horiuchi M. J. Hypertens. 2006; 24: 123-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). To ascertain the role of the IKKβ subunit in the proinflammatory effect of the octapeptide, we first verified the Ang II response in a heterologous cell system overexpressing the AT1R and a dominant-negative version of IKKβ (IKKβ DN). Expression of the AT1R in 293 cells allows Ang II to strongly enhance NF-κB promoter activity, which was significantly inhibited by co-transfecting increasing amounts of IKKβ DN (Fig. 1A). IKKβ subunit was also essential for Ang II-induced il8 transcription in 293 cells (Fig. 1B) as well as rapid il6 transcription in VSMC, where the IKKβ subunit level was reduced by means of siRNA treatment (Fig. 1C). Together these data confirmed the essential role of the IKKβ subunit in the proinflammatory action of Ang II. In cultured primary B cells and mouse embryonic fibroblasts, the expression level of NIK is undetectable because it is constitutively degraded by the proteasome (32Zarnegar B.J. Wang Y. Mahoney D.J.

Activation of the noncanonical NF-κB pathway by a select group of TNF receptors such as CD40 and the lymphotoxin-β receptor is rather a long process, which first needs stabilization of NIK through degradation of the E3 ligase TRAF3 (32Zarnegar B.J. Wang Y. Mahoney D.J. Dempsey P.W. Cheung H.H. He J. Shiba T. Yang X. Yeh W.C. Mak T.W. Korneluk R.G. Cheng G. Nat. Immunol. 2008; 9: 1371-1378Crossref PubMed Scopus (464) Google Scholar). Once accumulated to a certain threshold, this MAPKKK then induces T-loop phosphorylation of IKKα, an effect that ultimately leads to the processing of p100 to p52 (19Skaug B. Jiang X. Chen Z.J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2009; 78: 769-796Crossref PubMed Scopus (405) Google Scholar). In accordance with a lack of a significant effect of Ang II in inducing IKKα phosphorylation following minutes of stimulation (see supplemental Fig. S1A and Fig. 2A), the expression level of TRAF3 was only marginally affected by Ang II treatment for up 1 h of stimulation, which correlated with the incapacity to detect significant expression of endogenous NIK and the processing of p100 (see supplemental Fig. S1, B and C). Therefore, phosphorylation of IKKβ is likely the signaling mechanism by which the AT1R (and other GPCR, see below) is coupled to the rapid induction of the NF-κB pathway. The use of an anti-phospho-IKKα/β (Ser180/Ser181) antibody in Western blot analysis revealed that Ang II induced a rapid (as early as 15 s) and sustained T-loop phosphorylation of IKKβ (Fig. 2A). The phosphosignal of IKKβ further increases after 5 and 15 min of stimulation. PDGF-BB also induced T-loop phosphorylation of IKKβ but only at times where protein kinases ERK1 and ERK2 were phosphorylated. We decided to use this assay to decipher the signaling cascades responsible for phosphorylation and activation of IKKβ. Ang II treatment of VSMC resulted in a very rapid phosphorylation of IKKβ, an effect likely mediated by the generation of second messengers such as calcium and diacylglycerol. Thus, we next verified the role of diacylglycerol/calcium-dependent PKCs (known as conventional PKCs) in IKKβ and NF-κB activation. Pretreatment of VSMC with the calcium chelator BAPTA-AM and the conventional PKC inhibitor Gö6976 abrogated the early signaling events leading to IKKβ phosphorylation (Fig. 2, B and C). The same results were observed for other agonists (thrombin and bradykinin) that bind GPCRs coupled to the Gαq-phospholipase Cβ pathway (data not shown). Importantly, the decrease in IKKβ phosphorylation caused by these treatments correlated with a significant reduction in the ability of Ang II to increase the phosphotransferase activity of IKKβ as well as the DNA binding activity of NF-κB dimers compos"

These strains have been propagated under different conditions: the FSC198 has undergone natural propagation in the environment, while the strain FSC043 has been cultivated on artificial media in laboratories. Here, we have compared the genome sequences of FSC198, FSC043, and SCHU S4 to explore the possibility that the contrasting propagation conditions may have resulted in different mutational patterns. We found four insertion/deletion events (INDELs) in the strain FSC043, as compared to the SCHU S4, while no single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) or variable number of tandem repeats (VNTRs) were identified. This result contrasts with previously reported findings for the strain FSC198, where eight SNPs and three VNTR differences, but no INDELs exist as compared to the SCHU S4 strain. The mutations detected in the laboratory and naturally propagated type A strains, respectively, demonstrate distinct patterns supporting that analysis of mutational spectra might be a useful tool to reveal differences in past growth conditions. Such information may be useful to identify leads in a microbial forensic investigation."
https://openalex.org/W2023031166,"Heterogeneous surface expression of Thy-1 in fibroblasts modulates inflammation and may thereby modulate injury and repair. As a paradigm, patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, a disease with pathologic features of chronic inflammation, demonstrate an absence of Thy-1 immunoreactivity within areas of fibrotic activity (fibroblast foci) in contrast to the predominant Thy-1 expressing fibroblasts in the normal lung. Likewise, Thy-1 deficient mice display more severe lung fibrosis in response to an inflammatory injury than wildtype littermates. We investigated the role of Thy-1 in the response of fibroblasts to the pro-inflammatory cytokine TNF-alpha. Our study demonstrates distinct profiles of TNF-alpha-activated gene expression in Thy-1 positive (Thy-1+) and negative (Thy-1-) subsets of mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEF). TNF-alpha induced a robust activation of MMP-9, ICAM-1, and the IL-8 promoter driven reporter in Thy-1- MEFs, in contrast to only a modest increase in Thy-1+ counterparts. Consistently, ectopic expression of Thy-1 in Thy-1- MEFs significantly attenuated TNF-alpha-activated gene expression. Mechanistically, TNF-alpha activated Src family kinase (SFK) only in Thy-1- MEFs. Blockade of SFK activation abrogated TNF-alpha-activated gene expression in Thy-1- MEFs, whereas restoration of SFK activation rescued the TNF-alpha response in Thy-1+ MEFs. Our findings suggest that Thy-1 down-regulates TNF-alpha-activated gene expression via interfering with SFK- and NF-kappaB-mediated transactivation. The current study provides a novel mechanistic insight to the distinct roles of fibroblast Thy-1 subsets in inflammation."
https://openalex.org/W2003380704,"Background Nanolipoprotein particles (NLPs) are discoidal, nanometer-sized particles comprised of self-assembled phospholipid membranes and apolipoproteins. NLPs assembled with human apolipoproteins have been used for myriad biotechnology applications, including membrane protein solubilization, drug delivery, and diagnostic imaging. To expand the repertoire of lipoproteins for these applications, insect apolipophorin-III (apoLp-III) was evaluated for the ability to form discretely-sized, homogeneous, and stable NLPs. Methodology Four NLP populations distinct with regards to particle diameters (ranging in size from 10 nm to >25 nm) and lipid-to-apoLp-III ratios were readily isolated to high purity by size exclusion chromatography. Remodeling of the purified NLP species over time at 4°C was monitored by native gel electrophoresis, size exclusion chromatography, and atomic force microscopy. Purified 20 nm NLPs displayed no remodeling and remained stable for over 1 year. Purified NLPs with 10 nm and 15 nm diameters ultimately remodeled into 20 nm NLPs over a period of months. Intra-particle chemical cross-linking of apoLp-III stabilized NLPs of all sizes. Conclusions ApoLp-III-based NLPs can be readily prepared, purified, characterized, and stabilized, suggesting their utility for biotechnological applications."

Consistent with this influence of differential experience, our perception of faces (e.g., preference, recognition ability) is shaped by our previous experience with different groups of individuals. Methodology/Principal Findings Here, we examined whether cultural differences in social practices influence our perception of faces. Japanese, Chinese, and Asian-Canadian young adults made relative age judgments (i.e., which of these two faces is older?) for East Asian faces. Cross-cultural differences in the emphasis on respect for older individuals was reflected in participants' latency in facial age judgments for middle-age adult faces—with the Japanese young adults performing the fastest, followed by the Chinese, then the Asian-Canadians. In addition, consistent with the differential behavioural and linguistic markers used in the Japanese culture when interacting with individuals younger than oneself, only the Japanese young adults showed an advantage in judging the relative age of children's faces. Conclusions/Significance Our results show that different sociocultural practices shape our efficiency in processing facial age information. The impact of culture may potentially calibrate other aspects of face processing."
https://openalex.org/W2108733794,"By putting effort into behaviours like foraging or scanning for predators, an animal can improve the correctness of its personal information about the environment. For animals living in groups, the individual can gain further information if it is able to assess public information about the environment from other group members. Earlier work has shown that consensus group decisions based upon the public information available within the group are more likely to be correct than decisions based upon personal information alone, given that each individual in a group has a fixed probability of being correct. This study develops a model where group members are able to improve their personal likelihood of making a correct decision by conducting some level of (costly) effort. I demonstrate that there is an evolutionarily stable level of effort for all the individuals within the group, and the effort made by an individual should decrease with increasing group size. The relevance of these results to social decision making is discussed: in particular, these results are similar to standard theoretical predictions about the amount of vigilance shown by individuals decreasing with increasing group size. However, this model suggests that these results could come about where individuals are coordinating their effort within the group (unlike standard models, which assume that all individual effort is independent of the actions of others). This ties in with experimental findings where individuals have been shown to monitor the efforts of others."

We investigated which components of the immune system are involved in tumour rejection, and whether long-term immunological memory can be obtained.During the effector phase in BALB/c mice, only depletion of CD4+ and CD8+ in combination, with or without NK cells, completely abrogated tumour protection. Depletion of single CD4+, CD8+ or NK cell populations only had minor effects. During the immunization/induction phase, combined depletion of CD4+ and CD8+ cells abolished protection, while depletion of each individual subset had no or negligible effect. When tumour rejection was studied in knock-out mice with a C57Bl/6 background, protection was lost in CD4-/-CD8-/- and CD4-/-, but not in CD8-/- mice. In contrast, when normal C57Bl/6 mice were depleted of different cell types, protection was lost irrespective of whether only CD4+, only CD8+, or CD4+ and CD8+ cells in combination were eradicated. No anti-Her2/neu antibodies were detected but a Her2/neu-specific IFNgamma response was seen. Studies of long-term memory showed that BALB/c mice could be protected against tumour development when immunized together with CpG as long as ten weeks before challenge.Her2MPtVLP immunization is efficient in stimulating several compartments of the immune system, and induces an efficient immune response including long-term memory. In addition, when depleting mice of isolated cellular compartments, tumour protection is not as efficiently abolished as when depleting several immune compartments together."
https://openalex.org/W2070335260,"If biofuels are to be a viable substitute for fossil fuels, it is essential that they retain their potential to mitigate climate change under future atmospheric conditions. Elevated atmospheric CO2 concentration [CO2] stimulates plant biomass production; however, the beneficial effects of increased production may be offset by higher energy costs in crop management.We maintained full size poplar short rotation coppice (SRC) systems under both current ambient and future elevated [CO2] (550 ppm) and estimated their net energy and greenhouse gas balance. We show that a poplar SRC system is energy efficient and produces more energy than required for coppice management. Even more, elevated [CO2] will increase the net energy production and greenhouse gas balance of a SRC system with 18%. Managing the trees in shorter rotation cycles (i.e., 2 year cycles instead of 3 year cycles) will further enhance the benefits from elevated [CO2] on both the net energy and greenhouse gas balance.Adapting coppice management to the future atmospheric [CO2] is necessary to fully benefit from the climate mitigation potential of bio-energy systems. Further, a future increase in potential biomass production due to elevated [CO2] outweighs the increased production costs resulting in a northward extension of the area where SRC is greenhouse gas neutral. Currently, the main part of the European terrestrial carbon sink is found in forest biomass and attributed to harvesting less than the annual growth in wood. Because SRC is intensively managed, with a higher turnover in wood production than conventional forest, northward expansion of SRC is likely to erode the European terrestrial carbon sink."
https://openalex.org/W1987325022,"Isogenic populations of animals still show a surprisingly large amount of phenotypic variation between individuals. Using a GFP reporter that has been shown to predict longevity and resistance to stress in isogenic populations of the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans, we examined residual variation in expression of this GFP reporter. We found that when we separated the populations into brightest 3% and dimmest 3% we also saw variation in relative expression patterns that distinguished the bright and dim worms. Using a novel image processing method which is capable of directly analyzing worm images, we found that bright worms (after normalization to remove variation between bright and dim worms) had expression patterns that correlated with other bright worms but that dim worms fell into two distinct expression patterns. We have analysed a small set of worms with confocal microscopy to validate these findings, and found that the activity loci in these clusters are caused by extremely bright intestine cells. We also found that the vast majority of the fluorescent signal for all worms came from intestinal cells as well, which may indicate that the activity of intestinal cells is responsible for the observed patterns. Phenotypic variation in C. elegans is still not well understood but our proposed novel method to analyze complex expression patterns offers a way to enable a better understanding."

Bardini M. Mariani S.A. Ferrari-Amorotti G. Neviani P. Panno M.L. Zhang Y. Martinez R. Perrotti D. Calabretta B. Blood. 2006; 107: 4080-4089Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). However, C/EBPβ was considerably less potent than C/EBPα (27Ferrari-Amorotti G. Keeshan K. Zattoni M. Guerzoni C. Iotti G. Cattelani S. Donato N.J. Calabretta B. Blood. 2006; 108: 1353-1362Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar), perhaps because C/EBPα exerts its biological functions not only via DNA binding and transcription activation of C/EBP-regulated genes but also via protein-protein interactions involving cell cycle regulators and chromatin remodeling proteins (30Wang H.

In addition, the less potent effects of C/EBPβ may also reflect the subset of genes transcriptionally regulated by C/EBPα, C/EBPβ, or both. C/EBPα and C/EBPβ have a global homology at the protein level of 34%, but the homology in their TAD at the N terminus is only 24%, whereas it increases to 71% in the C terminus, where the DBD, the leucine-zipper domain, and the basic region reside (34Guerzoni C. Ferrari-Amorotti G. Bardini M. Mariani S.A. Calabretta B. Cell Cycle. 2006; 5: 1254-1257Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). To obtain additional insights on the mechanisms underlying the different potency of C/EBPα and C/EBPβ in p210BCR/ABL expressing cells, we assessed the biological effects of 4-hydroxytamoxifen (4-HT)-regulated proteins consisting of C/EBPα-C/EBPβ hybrids or of VP16-C/EBPα or C/EBPβ DBD chimera in K562 cells. We report here that the potent effect of C/EBPα in inhibiting proliferation and inducing differentiation of BCR/ABL-expressing cells depends on the strong activity of its TAD more than on different specificities of the DBDs; in addition to a subset of genes whose expression is modulated by C/EBPα, C/EBPβ, and the chimeric proteins, expression of most C/EBP-regulated genes is influenced by their respective TAD or appears to be C/EBPα- or C/EBPβ-specific. In particular, C/EBPα modulates the expression of a subset of apoptosis and cell cycle-regulatory genes that includes FOXO3a; expression of FOXO3a is essential for the apoptosis-enhancing effect of C/EBPα but not for its roles in cell proliferation and differentiation. C/EBPα-ER and C/EBPβ-ER plasmids were previously described (26Tavor S. Park D.J. Gery S. Vuong P.T. Gombart A.F. Koeffler H.P. J. Biol.

N-C/EBPα+C/EBPβ-DBD-ER and N-C/EBPβ+C/EBPα-DBD-ER plasmids were generated as follows; a NotI site was inserted in C/EBPβ-ER plasmid with the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) at nucleotide 623 upstream of the DBD; a NotI site was eliminated in C/EBPα-ER plasmid at nucleotide 460, and a NotI site was inserted at nucleotide 810 upstream of the DBD. Each plasmid (sequenced to verify presence of mutations) was digested with NotI and BamHI to release the C/EBPα or C/EBPβ DBDs, leaving the MigRI plasmids with the N terminus of C/EBPα or C/EBPβ and the ER cassette. The C/EBPα DBD was directionally cloned into the NotI/BamHI-digested N terminus-C/EBPβ-ER-MigRI to obtain N-C/EBPβ+C/EBPα-DBD-ER plasmid, whereas the C/EBPβ DBD was directionally cloned into the NotI/BamHI-digested N terminus-C/EBPα-ER-MigRI to obtain N-C/EBPα+C/EBPβ-DBD-ER plasmid. VP16+C/EBPα-DBD-ER, VP16+C/EBPβ-DBD-ER, and VP16+K298E-DBD-ER plasmids were generated as follows; the VP16 fragment was PCR-amplified from a pVP16-Nedd4 plasmid with 5′ and 3′ primers containing flapping XhoI and NotI sites, respectively; C/EBPα-DBD-ER, C/EBPβ-DBD-ER and K298E-DBD-ER fragments were generated by PCR from N-C/EBPβ+C/EBPα-DBD-ER, N-C/EBPα+C/EBPβ-DBD-ER, and K298E-ER (27Ferrari-Amorotti G.

K562 and derivative cell lines were cultured in Iscove's modified Dulbecco's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), 100 units/ml penicillin, 0.1 mg/ml streptomycin, 2 mm l-glutamine. 293T and Phoenix cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% FBS, 100 units/ml penicillin, 0.1 mg/ml streptomycin, 2 mm l-glutamine. For retroviral infections, amphotropic Phoenix cells were transiently transfected with the indicated plasmids. The infectious supernatant was collected 48 h later and used to infect (a 48-h procedure) K562 cells. Twenty-four hours later, cells were sorted (EPICS Profile Analyzer; Coulter, Hialeah, FL) for green florescent protein (GFP) expression. For shRNAs transfection, K562 cells (100 μl at a density of 106/ml) were resuspended in nucleofector V (Amaxa, Gaithersburg, MD) solution and mixed with 5 μg of shRNA. The solution was added to Amaxa electrode cuvettes and electroporated in Amaxa Nucleofector II using program T-16. Then cells were diluted in 2 ml of Iscove's modified Dulbecco's medium and 24 h later seeded at 104/ml and treated with 0.2 μm IM. 12 h later, 250 nm 4-HT was added, and samples were collected after 24, 48, and 72 h for cell cycle and apoptosis analyses. For proliferation and cell cycle analyses, K562 cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and treated with 4-HT (250 nm; Sigma). Viable cells were counted by trypan blue exclusion. For colony formation assays, cells were pretreated (1 h) with 250 nm 4-HT and plated in methylcellulose (5 × 102/plate) in the presence of 250 nm 4-HT. Colonies were counted 6 days later. Cell cycle distribution was determined by DNA content analysis of propidium iodide-stained nuclei as described (27Ferrari-Amorotti G. Keeshan K. Zattoni M. Guerzoni C. Iotti G. Cattelani S. Donato N.J. Calabretta B. Blood. 2006; 108: 1353-1362Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Differentiation was monitored by May-Grunwald/Giemsa staining and by detection of CD11b and CD15 differentiation markers, as described (27Ferrari-Amorotti G. Keeshan K. Zattoni M. Guerzoni C. Iotti G. Cattelani S. Donato N.J. Calabretta B. Blood. 2006; 108: 1353-1362Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Images were visualized using an Olympus CK2 microscope with a 40×/0.65 numeric aperture objective and were photographed using an Olympus SC35 type 12 camera (Olympus, Melville, NY). JPEG images were viewed using Adobe Photoshop (Adobe Systems, San Jose, CA), and contrast adjustments were made. For induction of apoptosis, K562 cells were seeded at 104/ml and pretreated with 0.2 μm IM for 12 h, then 250 nm 4-HT was added to IM-treated cells, and the percentage of apoptotic cells was evaluated 24, 48, and 72 h after 4-HT addition. For RT-PCR analysis, RNA of untreated or 4-HT-treated cells was extracted using RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) according to manufacturer's protocol. Extracted RNA was digested with DNase-RNase free (Roche Applied Science) for 1 h at 37 °C and deactivated 15 min at 65 °C. RT-PCR was performed with 200 ng of RNA using the ONE STEP RT-PCR kit (Qiagen) and oligodeoxynucleotides specific for granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) receptor and for FOXO3a cDNA (supplemental Table 1). cDNA samples were adjusted to yield relatively equal amplification of HPRT transcripts. For real time quantitative-PCR, total RNA was isolated using the RNeasy Mini kit (Qiagen). Extracted RNA was digested with DNase-RNase free (Roche Applied Science) for 1 h at 37 °C and deactivated for 15 min at 65 °C. 2 μg of total mRNA were reverse-transcribed, and the resulting first-strand cDNA was used as the PCR template. All reactions were done in triplicate. Primer pairs for all analyzed genes (supplemental Table 1) were designed using the ABI Primer Express software. Real time quantitative-PCR was performed using iQ SYBR Green supermix (Bio-Rad) on a MyIQ thermocycler (Bio-Rad) and quantified using MyIQ software (Bio-Rad). HPRT, a housekeeping gene with constant expression, was used as an internal control to normalize input cDNA. For relative comparison of each gene, we used the MyIQ software that analyzes the Ct value of real-time PCR data with ΔΔCt method. 293T cells were transiently transfected using ProFection Mammalian Transfection System-Calcium Phosphate (Promega, Madison, WI) with 3 μg of reporter plasmid pTK-G-CSFR-luciferase (which contains four C/EBPα binding sites from the G-CSF receptor promoter), 3 μg of the indicated C/EBP expression plasmid, and 1/50 Renilla luciferase plasmid to account for variation in transfection efficiencies. 24 h after co-transfection, 293T cells were treated with 250 nm 4-HT for 12 h. Firefly and renilla luciferase activity was recorded on a luminometer using the Dual-Luciferase Reporter Assay System (Promega). Results are expressed as -fold activation relative to empty vector after correction for Renilla luciferase activity and are representative of three independent experiments (performed in triplicate). RNA was isolated from 4-HT- or vehicle-treated C/EBP-ER K562 cells and purified with RNeasy Column (Qiagen). 5 μg of total RNA were used to generate biotin-labeled cRNA using an oligo T7 primer in a reverse transcription reaction followed by in vitro transcription reaction with biotin labeled UTP and CTP. Ten micrograms of cRNA were fragmented and hybridized to HGU133 2.0 Plus arrays (Affymetrix, Santa Clara, CA) representing nearly 50,000 RNA transcripts and variants. Hybridized arrays were stained according to the manufacturer's protocols on a Fluidics Station 450 and scanned on an Affymetrix scanner 3000. All array images were visually inspected for defects and quality. Signal values were determined using the Gene Chip Operating System 1.0 (GCOS, Affymetrix). For each array, all probe sets were normalized to a mean signal intensity value of 100. A qualifier was considered detectable if the mean expression was greater than 50 signal units and the percentage of samples with a Present call, as determined by GCOS default settings, was greater than or equal to 25%. A qualifier was considered to be regulated if the difference between 4-HT- and vehicle-treated samples met the following criteria; 1) the qualifier was detected in at least 25% of the samples in either the vehicle or 4-HT-treated samples, 2) the -fold change was at least 2, and 3) the p value based on an t test was ≤0.05. For identification of the gene associated with specific biological processes, we used EPLtool, an automatic gene clustering tool developed by Wyeth Bioinformatics for Affymetrix qualifiers. ChIP assays were performed using the EZ-ChIP assay kit (Upstate Biotechnology, Inc.). Briefly, 3 × 107 exponentially growing K562 cells (untreated and 4-HT-treated, 24 h) were cross-linked with 1% formaldehyde, incubated for 15 min, and treated with glycine at a final concentration of 125 mm for 5 min at room temperature. Cells were then washed with ice-cold PBS and resuspended in 1 ml of lysis buffer with a protease inhibitor containing mixture and sonicated at 24% power for 12 pulses of 10 s each in a Branson Sonifer 450 (Branson Ultrasonics, Danbury, CT). Chromatin was precleared with 50 μl of protein A-agarose beads for 60 min at 4 °C with rotation, and precleared lysates were immunoprecipitated with the anti-estrogen receptor α antibody (12 μg; SRA-1010 Stressgen) at 4 °C overnight with rotation. Immunoprecipitations without antibody (no antibody control) and an anti-rabbit IgG were included with each experiment. Immune complexes were collected with 50 μl of protein A-agarose beads for 60 min at 4 °C with rotation (except for 10 μl of supernatant of the no antibody control, saved as Input) and washed with the buffer recommended in the ChIP protocol. Immune complexes were next eluted using freshly prepared elution buffer (1% SDS and 0.1 m NaHCO3). Cross-links were reversed by heating at 65 °C overnight in the presence of 0.2 m NaCl. ChIP DNA (2 μl) was next used as a template for real time quantitative-PCR using the following primers: human FOXO3a promoter primers (−655/−453), which encompass the putative C/EBP binding site TATTTCCACA at nucleotides −608 to −599 identified through both the AliBaba2 and PATCH programs; human FOXO3a promoter primers (−960/−756), which do not contain putative C/EBP binding sites as the negative control (supplemental Table 1); human G-CSFR promoter primers, which include a canonical C/EBP binding site TGTTGCAATC at nucleotide −55 as the positive control (supplemental Table 1). Recovered DNA was analyzed by real time quantitative-PCR with the primers in supplemental Table 1 to normalize ChIP-quantitative PCR data were analyzed with the Percent Input Method. Percent input was calculated by 100 × 2(CtInput − CtEnriched). Data (presented as the means ± S.D. of two or three experiments) were analyzed for statistical significance by the unpaired, 2-tailed Student's t test. p values of less than 0.05 were considered statistically significant. Activation of C/EBPα-ER in K562 cells induces granulocytic differentiation rapidly and efficiently, whereas C/EBPβ-ER had no effects (33D'Alo' F. Johansen L.M. Nelson E.A. Radomska H.S. Evans E.K.

Immunol. 2006; 7: 732-739Crossref PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar). To assess the mechanisms underlying such distinct effects, we generated retroviruses for two chimeric proteins by swapping the C terminus of C/EBPα and C/EBPβ (Fig. 1A) and stably expressed wild-type and chimeric proteins into K562 cells (Fig. 1B). After treatment with 4-HT to activate ectopic C/EBP proteins, we first assessed the effects on K562 cell proliferation by cell counts and DNA content analyses. Compared with empty vector-transduced cells, activation of C/EBPα-ER or N-C/EBPα+C/EBPβ-DBD-ER led to statistically significant inhibition of proliferation (Fig. 1C). Likewise, DNA content analysis showed a statistically significant increase of G1 phase cells and a decrease of S and G2/M phase cells only after a 72-h activation of C/EBPα-ER or N-C/EBPα+C/EBPβ-DBD-ER (Fig. 1D). We also tested the effects of the C/EBPα/β chimeric proteins on colony formation of K562 cells. Consistent with the effects on cell proliferation, activation of C/EBPα-ER or N-C/EBPα+C/EBPβ-DBD-ER markedly suppressed (∼90% inhibition compared with controls) K562 colony formation (Fig. 1E); activation of C/EBPβ-ER or N-C/EBPβ+ C/EBPα-DBD-ER also suppressed K562 colony formation, but the effect was considerably less striking (40–50% inhibition compared with controls) (Fig. 1E). The effects on differentiation were assessed by morphology and expression of granulocytic markers. Activation of C/EBPα-ER or N-C/EBPα+C/EBPβ-DBD-ER promoted granulocytic differentiation of K562 cells, whereas activation of C/EBPβ-ER or N-C/EBPβ+C/EBPα-DBD-ER induced the early appearance of metamyelocytes, as indicated by the presence of cells with “doughnut”-shaped nuclei, but the vast majority of these cells failed to undergo terminal differentiation (Fig. 2A, Table 1).TABLE 1Frequency of undifferentiated and differentiated myeloid cells in 4HT-trea"
https://openalex.org/W2007830327,"The biological communities that inhabit chemosynthetic environments exist in an ephemeral and patchily distributed habitat with unique physicochemical properties that lead to high endemicity. Consequently, the maintenance and recovery from perturbation of the populations in these habitats is, arguably, mainly regulated by larval supply and recruitment.WE USE DATA FROM THE PUBLISHED SCIENTIFIC LITERATURE TO: (1) compare the magnitudes of and variability in larval supply and settlement and recruitment at hydrothermal vents, seeps, and whale, wood and kelp falls; (2) explore factors that affect these life history processes, when information is available; and (3) explore taxonomic affinities in the recruit assemblages of the different chemosynthetic habitats, using multivariate statistical techniques. Larval supply at vents can vary across segments by several orders of magnitude for gastropods; for bivalves, supply is similar at vents on different segments, and at cold seeps. The limited information on larval development suggests that dispersal potential may be highest for molluscs from cold seeps, intermediate for siboglinids at vents and lowest for the whale-bone siboglinid Osedax. Settlement is poorly studied and only at vents and seeps, but tends to be highest near an active source of emanating fluid in both habitats. Rate of recruitment at vents is more variable among studies within a segment than among segments. Across different chemosynthetic habitats, recruitment rate of bivalves is much more variable than that of gastropods and polychaetes. Total recruitment rate ranges only between 0.1 and 1 ind dm(-2) d(-1) across all chemosynthetic habitats, falling above rates in the non-reducing deep sea. The recruit assemblages at vents, seeps and kelp falls have lower taxonomic breadth, and include more families and genera that have many species more closely related to each other than those at whale and wood falls. Vents also have the most uneven taxonomic structure, with fewer recruits represented by higher taxonomic levels (phyla, orders, classes) compared to seeps and wood and kelp falls, whereas the opposite is true at whale falls.Based on our evaluation of the literature, the patterns and regulatory factors of the early history processes in chemosynthetic environments in the deep sea remain poorly understood. More research focused on these early life history stages will allow us to make inferences about the ecological and biogeographic linkages among the reducing habitats in the deep sea."
https://openalex.org/W1990906563,"The single rate codon model of non-synonymous substitution is ubiquitous in phylogenetic modeling. Indeed, the use of a non-synonymous to synonymous substitution rate ratio parameter has facilitated the interpretation of selection pressure on genomes. Although the single rate model has achieved wide acceptance, we argue that the assumption of a single rate of non-synonymous substitution is biologically unreasonable, given observed differences in substitution rates evident from empirical amino acid models. Some have attempted to incorporate amino acid substitution biases into models of codon evolution and have shown improved model performance versus the single rate model. Here, we show that the single rate model of non-synonymous substitution is easily outperformed by a model with multiple non-synonymous rate classes, yet in which amino acid substitution pairs are assigned randomly to these classes. We argue that, since the single rate model is so easy to improve upon, new codon models should not be validated entirely on the basis of improved model fit over this model. Rather, we should strive to both improve on the single rate model and to approximate the general time-reversible model of codon substitution, with as few parameters as possible, so as to reduce model over-fitting. We hint at how this can be achieved with a Genetic Algorithm approach in which rate classes are assigned on the basis of sequence information content."
https://openalex.org/W2061766774,"During bacterial conjugation, genetic material from one cell is transferred to another as single-stranded DNA. The introduction of single-stranded DNA into the recipient cell would ordinarily trigger a potentially deleterious transcriptional response called SOS, which is initiated by RecA protein filaments formed on the DNA. During F plasmid conjugation, however, the SOS response is suppressed by PsiB, an F-plasmid-encoded protein that binds and sequesters free RecA to prevent filament formation. Among the many characterized RecA modulator proteins, PsiB is unique in using sequestration as an inhibitory mechanism. We describe the crystal structure of PsiB from the Escherichia coli F plasmid. The stucture of PsiB is surprisingly similar to CapZ, a eukaryotic actin filament capping protein. Structure-directed neutralization of electronegative surfaces on PsiB abrogates RecA inhibition whereas neutralization of an electropositive surface element enhances PsiB inhibition of RecA. Together, these studies provide a first molecular view of PsiB and highlight its use as a reagent in studies of RecA activity."
https://openalex.org/W2107036106,"Viruses have evolved to evade the host's complement system. The open reading frames 4 (ORF4) of gammaherpesviruses encode homologs of regulators of complement activation (RCA) proteins, which inhibit complement activation at the level of C3 and C4 deposition. Besides complement regulation, these proteins are involved in heparan sulfate and glycosaminoglycan binding, and in case of MHV-68, also in viral DNA synthesis in macrophages.Here, we made use of MHV-68 to study the role of ORF4 during infection of fibroblasts. While attachment and penetration of virions lacking the RCA protein were not affected, we observed a delayed delivery of the viral genome to the nucleus of infected cells. Analysis of the phosphorylation status of a variety of kinases revealed a significant reduction in phosphorylation of the protein kinase Akt in cells infected with ORF4 mutant virus, when compared to cells infected with wt virus. Consistent with a role of Akt activation in initial stages of infection, inhibition of Akt signaling in wt virus infected cells resulted in a phenotype resembling the phenotype of the ORF4 mutant virus, and activation of Akt by addition of insulin partially reversed the phenotype of the ORF4 mutant virus. Importantly, the homologous ORF4 of KSHV was able to rescue the phenotype of the MHV-68 ORF4 mutant, indicating that ORF4 is functionally conserved and that ORF4 of KSHV might have a similar function in infection initiation.In summary, our studies demonstrate that ORF4 contributes to efficient infection by activation of the protein kinase Akt and thus reveal a novel function of a gammaherpesvirus RCA protein."
