https://openalex.org/W2041988248,"THE presence of the naturally radioactive isotope potassium-40 to the extent of 0.012 per cent in potassium affords a convenient means of measuring the potassium content of humans, provided that no other radioactive elements (for example, radium) are present in the body. Of the total amount of potassium present, only some is said to be ‘exchangeable’, as measured by the method of isotopic dilution using the short-lived isotope potassium-42."

https://openalex.org/W2071525178,"DURING experiments to determine the fate of potassium cyanide contained in sewage during treatment on percolating filters, a bacterium was isolated capable of growing on silica gel medium containing only potassium cyanide as a source of nitrogen and carbon; traces of iron, copper and phosphate were also present. The organism, which consisted of Gram-positive branching filaments approximately 1µ in diameter, some of which were broken up into bacillary segments, grew on solid medium as a hard, white and powdery colony reaching a maximum of 1 mm. in diameter after incubation for seven days at 28° C. Aerial hyphæ and conidia are present (Fig. 1); but the latter are probably not true reproductive bodies as the organism is killed by drying. The organism is aerobic and a strict autotroph, growth being inhibited in culture by the presence of agar or peptone. It can utilize concentrations of cyanide up to 15 mgm. per 100 ml., but appears to grow best on cyanide concentrations of approximately 4 mgm. per 100 ml. The bacterium was difficult to culture, growth being slow and sparse; but it exhibited surprising activity, a few colonies being able to utilize more than 0.5 mgm. cyanide per day."

https://openalex.org/W199823787,"IT has long been known that cellulose and chitin are broken down by many species of both bacteria and fungi that can be isolated from soil. It is probable that the soil fauna may also be important in this respect, for it is known that earthworms and eel-worms may possess both cellulase and chitinase1. Some soil amœbae were examined to see whether they, too, possessed these enzymes."

https://openalex.org/W2024477720,"THE existence of A, B, O and AB groups in thrombocytes, corresponding to these groups in red blood cells, has been reported1,2. The identity of the A and B antigens in platelets and red blood cells has been proved by: (1) platelet agglutination with antisera; (2) cross-adsorption of isoagglutinins with thrombocytes and erythrocytes; (3) inhibition of isoagglutinins with saliva from secretors; and (4) neutralization of antisera with A- and B-group specific substances. Similar results of agglutination of platelets were reported by Ruggieri and Bolognesi3. Adsorption of A- and B-isoagglutinins with platelets was reported by Moureau and Andre4."

https://openalex.org/W2006893492,"IN the investigation briefly reported here, the collagen fibres used were from beef achilles tendon. The diffraction patterns were obtained with an evacuated camera and a rotating anode X-ray tube having a copper or chromium target. The results discussed refer only to copper Kα radiation; the chromium target was used solely for confirming intensity measurements. The observations on dry collagen were made with vacuum-dried fibres which remained in vacuo throughout the experiments, whereas wet fibres were mounted in a cell with beryllium windows and remained in a saturated atmosphere for the duration of the exposure. Photographs were obtained from which measurements were made of the intensities of twenty-five orders in the pattern for wet fibres, and twenty-three orders in the case of dry fibres. Exposure times involved may be indicated by giving the times required to give an intensity in the first order of D = 1.0 above the background. For dry achilles tendon this time was 2.5–3 hr., whereas for wet fibres the time was about thirty minutes, the apparatus running under identical conditions with the tube operated at 30 kV., 80 m.amp. The long spacing d of the dry fibres was 635 A. and for the wet fibres 670 A."

https://openalex.org/W2071088702,"THE importance of deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) and ribonucleic acid (RNA) in the physiology of a cell is very great. Very little work on cells of fungal hyphæ seems to have been done. For this purpose, very young (2–3 days old) subcultures of Polyporus ostreiformis, Polyporus adustus, Polyporus gilvus and Marasmius campanella were taken; they were fixed and stained for 15–20 min. by the method of Unna as adapted by Brachet1. The small resting nuclei of the homogeneous unexpanded type of Pinto Lopes2 became very prominent in pyronin-stained cytoplasm; nucleolus and chromatin, combined at the centre into a homogeneous mass, took brilliant green stain (DNA) surrounded by pink hyloplasm (RNA), and finally by a green outline (Fig. 1). The nucleolus, according bo Brachet3 and Caspersson4, is believed to be composed mainly of ribonucleoproteins, and Fujii5 holds that zinc, in addition, is present in nucleoli and that, upon the initiation of mitosis, zinc passes into chromosomes and possibly also into prometaphase spindle."
