https://openalex.org/W1999167944,"Crossing the boundaries in global sustainability The planetary boundary (PB) concept, introduced in 2009, aimed to define the environmental limits within which humanity can safely operate. This approach has proved influential in global sustainability policy development. Steffen et al. provide an updated and extended analysis of the PB framework. Of the original nine proposed boundaries, they identify three (including climate change) that might push the Earth system into a new state if crossed and that also have a pervasive influence on the remaining boundaries. They also develop the PB framework so that it can be applied usefully in a regional context. Science , this issue 10.1126/science.1259855"

We discovered that by synthesizing a swellable polymer network within a specimen, it can be physically expanded, resulting in physical magnification. By covalently anchoring specific labels located within the specimen directly to the polymer network, labels spaced closer than the optical diffraction limit can be isotropically separated and optically resolved, a process we call expansion microscopy (ExM). Thus, this process can be used to perform scalable superresolution microscopy with diffraction-limited microscopes. We demonstrate ExM with apparent ~70-nanometer lateral resolution in both cultured cells and brain tissue, performing three-color superresolution imaging of ~10(7) cubic micrometers of the mouse hippocampus with a conventional confocal microscope."

https://openalex.org/W1979869741,"Background Acute exacerbation (AE) of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a common cause of disease acceleration in IPF and has a major impact on mortality. The role of macrophage activation in AE of IPF has never been addressed before. Methods We evaluated BAL cell cytokine profiles and BAL differential cell counts in 71 IPF patients w/wo AE and in 20 healthy volunteers. Twelve patients suffered from AE at initial diagnosis while sixteen patients developed AE in the 24 months of follow-up. The levels of IL-1ra, CCL2, CCL17, CCL18, CCL22, TNF-α, IL-1β, CXCL1 and IL-8 spontaneously produced by BAL-cells were analysed by ELISA. Results In patients with AE, the percentage of BAL neutrophils was significantly increased compared to stable patients. We found an increase in the production rate of the pro-inflammatory cytokines CXCL1 and IL-8 combined with an increase in all tested M2 cytokines by BAL-cells. An increase in CCL18 levels and neutrophil counts during AE was observed in BAL cells from patients from whom serial lavages were obtained. Furthermore, high baseline levels of CCL18 production by BAL cells were significantly predictive for the development of future AE. Conclusions BAL cell cytokine production levels at acute exacerbation show up-regulation of pro-inflammatory as well as anti-inflammatory/ M2 cytokines. Our data suggest that AE in IPF is not an incidental event but rather driven by cellular mechanisms including M2 macrophage activation."

The recent availability of attosecond light pulses means that it is now possible to observe ultrafast processes at an atomic scale. So far, such measurements have been carried out in gases, but now Reinhard Kienberger and colleagues use attosecond pulses to probe a fundamental process in the solid state, namely the transport of electrons through a crystal. They use attosecond pulses to launch photoelectron wavepackets inside a tungsten crystal that is covered by a controllable number of magnesium layers. Measuring the time of arrival of the wavepackets at the surface as a function of the number of layers reveals free-electron-like propagation of electrons inside the magnesium layers. The study demonstrates that real-time access to atomic-scale electron transport on the surface is possible. The propagation and transport of electrons in crystals is a fundamental process pertaining to the functioning of most electronic devices. Microscopic theories describe this phenomenon as being based on the motion of Bloch wave packets1. These wave packets are superpositions of individual Bloch states with the group velocity determined by the dispersion of the electronic band structure near the central wavevector in momentum space1. This concept has been verified experimentally in artificial superlattices by the observation of Bloch oscillations2—periodic oscillations of electrons in real and momentum space. Here we present a direct observation of electron wave packet motion in a real-space and real-time experiment, on length and time scales shorter than the Bloch oscillation amplitude and period. We show that attosecond metrology3 (1 as = 10−18 seconds) now enables quantitative insight into weakly disturbed electron wave packet propagation on the atomic length scale without being hampered by scattering effects, which inevitably occur over macroscopic propagation length scales. We use sub-femtosecond (less than 10−15 seconds) extreme-ultraviolet light pulses3 to launch photoelectron wave packets inside a tungsten crystal that is covered by magnesium films of varied, well-defined thicknesses of a few ångströms4. Probing the moment of arrival of the wave packets at the surface with attosecond precision reveals free-electron-like, ballistic propagation behaviour inside the magnesium adlayer—constituting the semi-classical limit of Bloch wave packet motion. Real-time access to electron transport through atomic layers and interfaces promises unprecedented insight into phenomena that may enable the scaling of electronic and photonic circuits to atomic dimensions. In addition, this experiment allows us to determine the penetration depth of electrical fields at optical frequencies at solid interfaces on the atomic scale."

On Earth, we're accustomed to cycles of day and night, which drive a complex thermal relationship between the ground and atmosphere. Some exoplanets very close to their stars aren't so lucky and are generally assumed to be locked by tides into hemispheres of unchanging day and night. The thick atmosphere of Venus is thought to keep it from the same fate, but Leconte et al. present models showing that even a much sparser atmosphere may suffice for lower-mass stars. The non-instantaneous thermal response of the planet (when the hottest time of day is after noon) may speed up or slow down the planet. Such thermal tides may be important in assessing potential extraterrestrial habitable zones. Science , this issue p. 632"

https://openalex.org/W2139581884,"Examination of the global uranium cycle — whereby uranium from the Earth’s crust is first transported to the oceans and then returned, by subduction, to the mantle — shows that the subducted uranium is isotopically distinct from the Earth as a whole and that this signature has been stirred throughout upper mantle, arguably within the past 600 million years. Morten Andersen et al. show that uranium subducted into the mantle should be isotopically distinct, with a high 238U/235U ratio, as a result of alteration processes at the bottom of an oxic ocean, and mid-ocean-ridge basalts do indeed have a higher 238U/235U ratio than the bulk Earth, confirming the widespread recycling of uranium in the upper mantle. Whilst it has been argued that many ocean island basalts also contain a recycled component, the authors find that their uranium isotopic compositions are unperturbed from that of the bulk Earth. This suggests that that the subducted uranium in ocean island basalts was isotopically unfractionated prior to full oceanic oxidation at around 600 million years ago, reflecting the greater antiquity of the ocean island basalt source. In contrast, the uranium isotopic composition of mid-ocean-ridge basalts requires convective stirring of recycled uranium throughout the upper mantle within the past 600 million years. Changing conditions on the Earth’s surface can have a remarkable influence on the composition of its overwhelmingly more massive interior. The global distribution of uranium is a notable example. In early Earth history, the continental crust was enriched in uranium. Yet after the initial rise in atmospheric oxygen, about 2.4 billion years ago, the aqueous mobility of oxidized uranium resulted in its significant transport to the oceans and, ultimately, by means of subduction, back to the mantle1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8. Here we explore the isotopic characteristics of this global uranium cycle. We show that the subducted flux of uranium is isotopically distinct, with high 238U/235U ratios, as a result of alteration processes at the bottom of an oxic ocean. We also find that mid-ocean-ridge basalts (MORBs) have 238U/235U ratios higher than does the bulk Earth, confirming the widespread pollution of the upper mantle with this recycled uranium. Although many ocean island basalts (OIBs) are argued to contain a recycled component9, their uranium isotopic compositions do not differ from those of the bulk Earth. Because subducted uranium was probably isotopically unfractionated before full oceanic oxidation, about 600 million years ago, this observation reflects the greater antiquity of OIB sources. Elemental and isotope systematics of uranium in OIBs are strikingly consistent with previous OIB lead model ages10, indicating that these mantle reservoirs formed between 2.4 and 1.8 billion years ago. In contrast, the uranium isotopic composition of MORB requires the convective stirring of recycled uranium throughout the upper mantle within the past 600 million years."

By spatial and time-resolved delivery of reactive oxygen and nitrogen species, it allows stimulation or inhibition of cellular processes in biological systems. Our data show that both gene and protein expression is highly affected by non-thermal plasma. Nuclear factor erythroid-related factor 2 (NRF2) and phase II enzyme pathway components were found to act as key controllers orchestrating the cellular response in keratinocytes. Additionally, glutathione metabolism, which is a marker for NRF2-related signaling events, was affected.

The roles of NRF2 targets, investigated by siRNA silencing, revealed that NRF2 acts as an important switch for sensing oxidative stress events. Moreover, the influence of non-thermal plasma on the NRF2 pathway prepares cells against exogenic noxae and increases their resilience against oxidative species. Via paracrine mechanisms, distant cells benefit from cell-cell communication.

https://openalex.org/W2054890847,"The microRNA miR-21 is overexpressed in most human cancers and accumulating evidence indicates that it functions as an oncogene. Since miRNAs suppress the expression of their target genes, we hypothesized that some miR-21 targets may act as tumor suppressors, and thus their expression would be anticipated to be reduced by the high miR-21 levels observed in various human cancers. By microarray analysis and quantitative PCR we identified and validated FBXO11 (a member of the F-box subfamily lacking a distinct unifying domain) as a miR-21 target gene. FBXO11 is a component of the SKP1-CUL1-F-box ubiquitin ligase complex that targets proteins for ubiquitination and proteosomal degradation. By loss of function and gain of function studies, we show that FBXO11 acts as a tumor suppressor, promotes apoptosis and mediates the degradation of the oncogenic protein BCL6. The critical role that FBXO11 plays in miR-21-mediated tumorigenesis was demonstrated by a rescue experiment, in which silencing FBXO11 in miR-21KD cancer cells restored their high tumorigenicity. Expression of miR-21 and FBXO11 are inversely correlated in tumor tissue, and their expression correlates with patient survival and tumor grade. High FBXO11 expression correlates with better patient survival and lower tumor grade consistent with its tumor suppressor activity. In contrast high miR-21 expression, which correlates with poor patient survival and higher tumor grade, is consistent with its oncogenic activity. Our results identify FBXO11 as a novel miR-21 target gene, and demonstrate that the oncogenic miRNA miR-21 decreases the expression of FBXO11, which normally acts as a tumor suppressor, and thereby promotes tumorigenesis."
https://openalex.org/W1964986019,"Data from the electronic medical record comprise numerous structured but uncoded elements, which are not linked to standard terminologies. Reuse of such data for secondary research purposes has gained in importance recently. However, the identification of relevant data elements and the creation of database jobs for extraction, transformation and loading (ETL) are challenging: With current methods such as data warehousing, it is not feasible to efficiently maintain and reuse semantically complex data extraction and trans-formation routines. We present an ontology-supported approach to overcome this challenge by making use of abstraction: Instead of defining ETL procedures at the database level, we use ontologies to organize and describe the medical concepts of both the source system and the target system. Instead of using unique, specifically developed SQL statements or ETL jobs, we define declarative transformation rules within ontologies and illustrate how these constructs can then be used to automatically generate SQL code to perform the desired ETL procedures. This demonstrates how a suitable level of abstraction may not only aid the interpretation of clinical data, but can also foster the reutilization of methods for un-locking it."
https://openalex.org/W2161341195,"The ability of animals to sense and differentiate among thousands of odorants relies on a large set of olfactory receptors (OR) and a multitude of accessory proteins within the olfactory epithelium (OE). ORs and related signaling mechanisms have been the subject of intensive studies over the past years, but our knowledge regarding olfactory processing remains limited. The recent development of next generation sequencing (NGS) techniques encouraged us to assess the transcriptome of the murine OE. We analyzed RNA from OEs of female and male adult mice and from fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS)-sorted olfactory receptor neurons (ORNs) obtained from transgenic OMP-GFP mice. The Illumina RNA-Seq protocol was utilized to generate up to 86 million reads per transcriptome. In OE samples, nearly all OR and trace amine-associated receptor (TAAR) genes involved in the perception of volatile amines were detectably expressed. Other genes known to participate in olfactory signaling pathways were among the 200 genes with the highest expression levels in the OE. To identify OE-specific genes, we compared olfactory neuron expression profiles with RNA-Seq transcriptome data from different murine tissues. By analyzing different transcript classes, we detected the expression of non-olfactory GPCRs in ORNs and established an expression ranking for GPCRs detected in the OE. We also identified other previously undescribed membrane proteins as potential new players in olfaction. The quantitative and comprehensive transcriptome data provide a virtually complete catalogue of genes expressed in the OE and present a useful tool to uncover candidate genes involved in, for example, olfactory signaling, OR trafficking and recycling, and proliferation."
https://openalex.org/W2154913285,"The global invasion of Tephritidae (fruit flies) attracts a great deal of attention in the field of plant quarantine and invasion biology because of their economic importance. Predicting which one in hundreds of potential invasive fruit fly species is most likely to establish in a region presents a significant challenge, but can be facilitated using a self organising map (SOM), which is able to analyse species associations to rank large numbers of species simultaneously with an index of establishment. A global presence/absence dataset including 180 economically significant fruit fly species in 118 countries was analysed using a SOM. We compare and contrast ranked lists from six countries selected from each continent, and also show that those countries geographically close were clustered together by the SOM analysis because they have similar fruit fly assemblages. These closely clustered countries therefore represent greater threats to each other as sources of invasive fruit fly species. Finally, we indicate how this SOM method could be utilized as an initial screen to support prioritizing fruit fly species for further research into their potential to invade a region."
https://openalex.org/W2058384455,"DNA sequences that can form intramolecular quadruplex structures are found in promoters of proto-oncogenes. Many of these sequences readily fold into parallel quadruplexes. Here we characterize the ability of yeast Pif1 to bind and unfold a parallel quadruplex DNA substrate. We found that Pif1 binds more tightly to the parallel quadruplex DNA than single-stranded DNA or tailed duplexes. However, Pif1 unwinding of duplexes occurs at a much faster rate than unfolding of a parallel intramolecular quadruplex. Pif1 readily unfolds a parallel quadruplex DNA substrate in a multiturnover reaction and also generates some product under single cycle conditions. The rate of ATP hydrolysis by Pif1 is reduced when bound to a parallel quadruplex compared with single-stranded DNA. ATP hydrolysis occurs at a faster rate than quadruplex unfolding, indicating that some ATP hydrolysis events are non-productive during unfolding of intramolecular parallel quadruplex DNA. However, product eventually accumulates at a slow rate."

A similar reduction of Hippo signaling activity was observed after β-Spectrin knockdown in mammalian cells. We further demonstrated that β-spectrin mutations disrupt the basal actin network in follicle cells.

https://openalex.org/W2051808682,"Objectives Hypoglycemia is frequent in very low birth weight (VLBW) neonates and compromises their neurological outcome. The aim of this study was to compare real-time continuous glucose monitoring system (RT-CGMS) to standard methods by intermittent capillary blood glucose testing in detecting and managing hypoglycemia. Study design Forty-eight VLBW neonates were enrolled in this prospective study. During their 3 first days of life, their glucose level was monitored either by RT-CGMS (CGM-group), or by intermittent capillary glucose testing (IGM-group) associated with a blind-CGMS to detect retrospectively missed hypoglycemia. Outcomes were the number and duration of hypoglycemic (≤50mg/dl) episodes per patient detected by CGMS. Results Forty-three monitorings were analyzed (IGM n = 21, CGM n = 22), with a median recording time of 72 hours. In the IGM group, blind-CGMS revealed a significantly higher number of hypoglycemia episodes than capillary blood glucose testing (1.2±0.4 vs 0.4±0.2 episode/patient, p<0.01). In the CGM-group, the use of RT-CGMS made it possible (i) to detect the same number of hypoglycemia episodes as blind-CGMS (1.2±0.4 episode/patient), (ii) to adapt the glucose supply in neonates with hypoglycemia (increased supply during days 1 and 2), and (iii) to significantly reduce the duration of hypoglycemia episodes per patient (CGM 44[10–140] min versus IGM 95[15–520] min, p<0.05). Furthermore, it reduced the number of blood samples (CGM 16.9±1.0 vs IGM 21.9±1.0 blood sample/patient, p<0.001). Conclusion RT-CGMS played a beneficial role in managing hypoglycemia in VLBW neonates by adjusting the carbohydrate supply to the individual needs and by reducing the duration of hypoglycemia episodes. The clinical significance of the biological differences observed in our study need to be explored."

https://openalex.org/W1994743438,"The aim of this study was to determine the effect of human milk feeding during NICU hospitalization on neurodevelopment at 24 months of corrected age in very low birth weight infants. A cohort of 316 very low birth weight newborns (weight ≤ 1500 g) was prospectively enrolled in a follow-up program on admission to the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit of S. Orsola Hospital, Bologna, Italy, from January 2005 to June 2011. Neurodevelopment was evaluated at 24 months corrected age using the Griffiths Mental Development Scale. The effect of human milk nutrition on neurodevelopment was first investigated using a multiple linear regression model, to adjust for the effects of gestational age, small for gestational age, complications at birth and during hospitalization, growth restriction at discharge and socio-economic status. Path analysis was then used to refine the multiple regression model, taking into account the relationships among predictors and their temporal sequence. Human milk feeding during NICU hospitalization and higher socio-economic status were associated with better neurodevelopment at 24 months in both models. In the path analysis model intraventricular hemorrhage—periventricular leukomalacia and growth restriction at discharge proved to be directly and independently associated with poorer neurodevelopment. Gestational age and growth restriction at birth had indirect significant effects on neurodevelopment, which were mediated by complications that occurred at birth and during hospitalization, growth restriction at discharge and type of feeding. In conclusion, our findings suggest that mother’s human milk feeding during hospitalization can be encouraged because it may improve neurodevelopment at 24 months corrected age."
https://openalex.org/W2121536490,"Several lines of evidence support immune response in brain as a mechanism of injury in Alzheimer disease (AD). Moreover, immune activation is heightened in apolipoprotein E (APOE) ε4 carriers; inhibitors of prostaglandin (PG) synthesis show a partially protective effect on AD risk from APOE ε4; and genetic variants in triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells 2 (TREM2) are a rare but potent risk for AD. We tested the hypothesis that APOE ε4 inheritance modulates both the PGE2 pathway and TREM2 expression using primary murine microglia from targeted replacement (TR) APOE3/3 and APOE4/4 mice. Microglial cyclooxygenase-2, microsomal PGE synthase, and PGE2 expression were increased 2- to 25-fold in both genotypes by TLR activators; however, this induction was significantly (P < 0.01) greater in TR APOE4/4 microglia with TLR3 and TLR4 activators. Microglial TREM2 expression was reduced approximately 85% by all TLR activators; this reduction was approximately one-third greater in microglia from TR APOE4/4 mice. Importantly, both receptor-associated protein and a nuclear factor κ-light-chain-enhancer inhibitor blocked TR APOE4/4-dependent effects on the PGE2 pathway but not on TREM2 expression. These data demonstrate complementary, but mechanistically distinct, regulation of pro- and anti-inflammatory mediators in TR APOE4/4 murine microglia that yields a more proinflammatory state than with TR APOE3/3."

To determine if there is a correlation between severity effects in these models and underlying pathophysiological responses, we compared the time dependent changes in each of these parameters that occur during a 6 week period. Dry eye was induced in 6-week-old female C57BL/6 mice by exposing them to an Intelligently Controlled Environmental System (ICES). Sixty mice were housed in ICES for 1, 2, 4 and 6 weeks respectively. Twelve were raised in normal environment and received subcutaneous injections of scopolamine hydrobromide (SCOP) 3 times daily for 5 days. Another sixty mice were housed in a normal environment and received no treatment. Corneal fluorescein staining along with corneal MMP-9 and caspase-3 level measurements were performed in parallel with the TUNEL assay. Interleukin-17(IL-17), IL-23, IL-6, IL-1, TNF-α, IFN-γ and TGF-β2 levels were estimated by real-time PCR measurements of conjunctival and lacrimal gland samples (LGs). Immunohistochemistry of excised LGs along with flow cytometry in cervical lymph nodes evaluated immune cell infiltration. Light and transmission electron microscopy studies evaluated LGs cytoarchitectural changes. ICES induced corneal epithelial destruction and apoptosis peaked at 2 weeks and kept stable in the following 4 weeks. In the ICES group, lacrimal gland proinflammatory cytokine level increases were much lower than those in the SCOP group. In accord with the lower proinflammatory cytokine levels, in the ICES group, lacrimal gland cytosolic vesicular density and size exceeded that in the SCOP group. ICES and SCOP induced murine dry eye effects became progressively more severe over a two week period. Subsequently, the disease process stabilized for the next four weeks. ICES induced local effects in the ocular surface, but failed to elicit lacrimal gland inflammation and cytoarchitectural changes, which accounts for less dry eye severity in the ICES model than that in the SCOP model."

We aimed to identify relevant mechanisms of and search for candidate biomarkers for this endothelial damage.Human micro-vascular endothelial cells (HMEC-1) were exposed to bleomycin or cisplatin with untreated samples as control. 18k cDNA microarrays were used. Gene expression differences were analysed at single gene level and in gene sets clustered in biological pathways and validated by qRT-PCR. Protein levels of a candidate biomarker were measured in testicular cancer patient plasma before, during and after bleomycin-etoposide-cisplatin chemotherapy, and related to endothelial damage biomarkers (von Willebrand Factor (vWF), high-sensitivity C-Reactive Protein (hsCRP)).Microarray data identified several genes with highly differential expression; e.g. Growth Differentiation Factor 15 (GDF-15), Activating Transcription Factor 3 (ATF3) and Amphiregulin (AREG). Pathway analysis revealed strong associations with 'p53' and 'Diabetes Mellitus' gene sets. Based on known function, we measured GDF-15 protein levels in 41 testicular patients during clinical follow-up. Pre-chemotherapy GDF-15 levels equalled controls. Throughout chemotherapy GDF-15, vWF and hsCRP levels increased, and were correlated at different time-points.An unbiased approach in a preclinical model revealed genes related to chemotherapy-induced endothelial damage, like GDF-15. The increases in plasma GDF-15 levels in testicular cancer patients during chemotherapy and its association with vWF and hsCRP suggest that GDF-15 is a potentially useful biomarker related to endothelial damage."
https://openalex.org/W1996912302,"The heterotrimeric CCAAT-binding complex (CBC) is evolutionarily conserved in eukaryotic organisms, including fungi, plants, and mammals. The CBC consists of three subunits, which are named in the filamentous fungus Aspergillus nidulans HapB, HapC, and HapE. HapX, a fourth CBC subunit, was identified exclusively in fungi, except for Saccharomyces cerevisiae and the closely related Saccharomycotina species. The CBC-HapX complex acts as the master regulator of iron homeostasis. HapX belongs to the class of basic region leucine zipper transcription factors. We demonstrated that the CBC and HapX bind cooperatively to bipartite DNA motifs with a general HapX/CBC/DNA 2:1:1 stoichiometry in a class of genes that are repressed by HapX-CBC in A. nidulans during iron limitation. This combinatorial binding mode requires protein-protein interaction between the N-terminal domain of HapE and the N-terminal CBC binding domain of HapX as well as sequence-specific DNA binding of both the CBC and HapX. Initial binding of the CBC to CCAAT boxes is mandatory for DNA recognition of HapX. HapX specifically targets the minimal motif 5'-GAT-3', which is located at a distance of 11-12 bp downstream of the respective CCAAT box. Single nucleotide substitutions at the 5'- and 3'-end of the GAT motif as well as different spacing between the CBC and HapX DNA-binding sites revealed a remarkable promiscuous DNA-recognition mode of HapX. This flexible DNA-binding code may have evolved as a mechanism for fine-tuning the transcriptional activity of CBC-HapX at distinct target promoters."

To compare FFWO occurring at the cell surface with HIV-cell fusion through a conventional entry route, we designed an experimental approach that enabled the measurements of both processes in the same sample. The following key differences were observed. First, a very small fraction of viruses fusing with target cells participated in FFWO. Second, whereas HIV-1 fusion with adherent cells was insensitive to actin inhibitors, post-CD4/coreceptor binding steps during FFWO were abrogated. A partial dependence of HIV-cell fusion on actin remodeling was observed in CD4+ T cells, but this effect appeared to be due to the actin dependence of virus uptake. Third, deletion of the cytoplasmic tail of HIV-1 gp41 dramatically enhanced the ability of the virus to promote FFWO, while having a modest effect on virus-cell fusion. Distinct efficiencies and actin dependences of FFWO versus HIV-cell fusion are consistent with the notion that, except for a minor fraction of particles that mediate fusion between the plasma membranes of adjacent cells, HIV-1 enters through an endocytic pathway.

We measured anthropometrics and biochemical variables and we calculated a muscular fitness index as the sum of z-scores of handgrip dynamometry/weight and standing long jump, and we estimated a previously validated cardiometabolic risk index (CMRI). Linear regression models were fitted for mediation analysis to assess whether the association between muscular fitness and cardiometabolic risk was mediated by BMI.Children with normal weight (NW) had a better cardiometabolic risk profile than their overweight (OW) or obese (OB) peers after controlling for muscular fitness. Marginal estimated mean ± SE values for NW, OW and OB categories of CMRI were -0.75 ± 0.06 < 0.84 ± 0.10 < 2.18 ± 0.16 in boys and -0.73 ± 0.06 < 0.96 ± 0.10 < 2.71 ± 0.17 in girls, both p < 0.001. Children with higher levels of muscular fitness had a better cardiometabolic risk profile (CMRI marginal estimated mean ± SE 1.04 ± 0.13 > 0.05 ± 0.09 >-1.16 ± 0.13 for lower, middle and upper quartiles of muscular fitness in boys and 1.01 ± 0.16 > 0.10 ± 0.09 > -1.02 ± 0.15 in girls, both p < 0.001), but differences disappeared when controlling for BMI. BMI acted as a full mediator between muscular fitness and most cardiometabolic risk factors (Sobel test z = -11.44 for boys; z = -11.83 for girls; p < 0.001 in CMRI mediation model) and as a partial mediator in the case of waist circumference (Sobel test z=-14.86 for boys; z=-14.51 for girls; p<0.001).BMI mediates the association between muscular fitness and cardiometabolic risk in schoolchildren. Overall, good muscular fitness is associated with lower cardiometabolic risk, but particularly when accompanied by normal weight."
https://openalex.org/W2088283184,"The African sweetpotato weevil (SPW) Cylas puncticollis Boheman is one of the most important constraints of sweetpotato production in Sub-Saharan Africa and yet is largely an uncharacterized insect pest. Here, we report on the transcriptome analysis of SPW generated using an Illumina platform. More than 213 million sequencing reads were obtained and assembled into 89,599 contigs. This assembly was followed by a gene ontology annotation. Subsequently, a transcriptome search showed that the necessary RNAi components relevant to the three major RNAi pathways, were found to be expressed in SPW. To address the functionality of the RNAi mechanism in this species, dsRNA was injected into second instar larvae targeting laccase2, a gene which encodes an enzyme involved in the sclerotization of insect exoskeleton. The body of treated insects showed inhibition of sclerotization, leading eventually to death. Quantitative Real Time PCR (qPCR) confirmed this phenotype to be the result of gene silencing. Together, our results provide valuable sequence data on this important insect pest and demonstrate that a functional RNAi pathway with a strong and systemic effect is present in SPW and can further be explored as a new strategy for controlling this important pest."

Deletion of Ano6 leads to reduced skeleton size, skeletal deformities, and mineralization defects in mice. However, it remains entirely unclear how a lack of Ano6 leads to a delay in bone mineralization by osteoblasts. The Na+/Ca2+ exchanger NCX1 was found to interact with Ano6 in a two-hybrid split-ubiquitin screen. Using human osteoblasts and osteoblasts from Ano6−/− and WT mice, we demonstrate that NCX1 requires Ano6 to efficiently translocate Ca2+ out of osteoblasts into the calcifying bone matrix. Ca2+-activated anion currents are missing in primary osteoblasts isolated from Ano6 null mice. Our findings demonstrate the importance of NCX1 for bone mineralization and explain why deletion of an ion channel leads to the observed mineralization defect: Ano6 Cl− currents are probably required to operate as a Cl− bypass channel, thereby compensating net Na+ charge movement by NCX1.

Here we report the crystal structure of human otubain 2 (OTUB2) in complex with a ubiquitin-based covalent inhibitor, Ub-Br2. The ubiquitin binding mode is oriented differently to how viral otubains (vOTUs) bind ubiquitin/ISG15, and more similar to yeast and mammalian OTUs. In contrast to OTUB1 which has exclusive specificity towards Lys48 poly-ubiquitin chains, OTUB2 cleaves different poly-Ub linked chains. N-terminal tail swapping experiments between OTUB1 and OTUB2 revealed how the N-terminal structural motifs in OTUB1 contribute to modulating enzyme activity and Ub-chain selectivity, a trait not observed in OTUB2, supporting the notion that OTUB2 may affect a different spectrum of substrates in Ub-dependent pathways."
https://openalex.org/W2152299183,"One of the consequences of extensive mindfulness practice is a reduction of anxiety and depression, but also a capacity to regulate negative emotions. In this study, we explored four key questions concerning mindfulness training: (1) What are the processes by which mindfulness regulates our emotions? (2) Can mindfulness be applied to social emotions? (3) Does mindfulness training affect emotionally driven behavior towards others? (4) Does mindfulness alter physiological reactivity? To address these questions, we tested, in two experiments, the ability of mindfulness meditators to regulate interpersonal emotions (Experiment 1) and interactive behaviors (Experiment 2) as compared to naïve controls. To better understand the mechanisms by which mindfulness regulates emotions, we asked participants to apply two strategies: a cognitive strategy (mentalizing, a form of reappraisal focused on the intentions of others) and an experiential strategy derived from mindfulness principles (mindful detachment). Both groups were able to regulate interpersonal emotions by means of cognitive (mentalizing) and experiential (mindful detachment) strategies. In Experiment 1, a simple effect of meditation, independent from the implementation of the strategies, resulted in reduced emotional and physiological reactivity, as well as in increased pleasantness for meditators when compared to controls, providing evidence of baseline regulation. In Experiment 2, one visible effect of the strategy was that meditators outperformed controls in the experiential (mindful detachment) but not in the cognitive (mentalize) strategy, showing stronger modulation of their interactive behavior (less punishments) and providing evidence of a strategic behavioral regulation. Based on these results, we suggest that mindfulness can influence interpersonal emotional reactions through an experiential mechanism, both at a baseline level and a strategic level, thereby altering the subjective and physiological perception of emotions, but also biasing interactive social behavior."
https://openalex.org/W2005721346,"Greece is the only European Union member state that in 2008 included hepatitis A (HAV) vaccine in the routine national childhood immunization program (NCIP). Given that the resources allocated to public health have dramatically decreased since 2008 and that Greece is a low endemicity country for the disease, the benefit from universal vaccination has been questioned. The aim of this paper is to summarize the available epidemiological data of the disease for 1982-2013, and discuss the effects of universal vaccination on disease morbidity. Descriptive analysis, ARIMA modeling and time series intervention analysis were conducted using surveillance data of acute HAV. A decreasing trend of HAV notification rate over the years was identified (p<0.001). However, universal vaccination (~ 80% vaccine coverage of children) had no significant effect on the annual number of reported cases (p = 0.261) and has resulted to a progressive increase of the average age of infection in the general population. The mean age of cases before the inclusion of the vaccine to NCIP (24.1 years, SD = 1.5) was significantly lower than the mean age of cases after 2008 (31.7 years, SD = 2.1) (p<0.001). In the last decade, one third of all reported cases were Roma (a population accounting for 1.5% of the country's total population) and in 2013 three outbreaks with 16, 9 and 25 Roma cases respectively, were recorded, indicating the decreased effectiveness of the current immunization strategy in this group. Data suggest that universal vaccination may need to be re-considered. Probably a more cost effective approach would be to implement a program that will include: a) vaccination of high risk groups, b) universal vaccination of Roma children and improving conditions at Roma camps, c) education of the population and travel advice, and d) enhancement of the control measures to increase safety of shellfish and other foods."
https://openalex.org/W1987159215,"Genes that regulate osteoclast (OC) development and function in both physiologic and disease conditions remain incompletely understood. Shp2 (the Src homology-2 domain containing protein tyrosine phosphatase 2), a ubiquitously expressed cytoplasmic protein tyrosine phosphatase, is implicated in regulating M-CSF and receptor activator of nuclear factor-κB ligand (RANKL)- evoked signaling; its role in osteoclastogenesis and bone homeostasis, however, remains unknown. Using a tissue-specific gene knockout approach, we inactivated Shp2 expression in murine OCs. Shp2 mutant mice are phenotypically osteopetrotic, featuring a marked increase of bone volume (BV)/total volume (TV) (+42.8%), trabeculae number (Tb.N) (+84.1%), structure model index (+119%), and a decrease of trabecular thickness (Tb.Th) (-34.1%) and trabecular spacing (Tb.Sp) (-41.0%). Biochemical analyses demonstrate that Shp2 is required for RANKL-induced formation of giant multinucleated OCs by up-regulating the expression of nuclear factor of activated T cells, cytoplasmic 1 (Nfatc1), a master transcription factor that is indispensable for terminal OC differentiation. Shp2 deletion, however, has minimal effect on M-CSF-dependent survival and proliferation of OC precursors. Instead, its deficiency aborts the fusion of OC precursors and formation of multinucleated OCs and decreases bone matrix resorption. Moreover, pharmacological intervention of Shp2 is sufficient to prevent preosteoclast fusion in vitro. These findings uncover a novel mechanism through which Shp2 regulates osteoclastogenesis by promoting preosteoclast fusion. Shp2 or its signaling partners could potentially serve as pharmacological targets to regulate the population of OCs locally and/or systematically, and thus treat OC-related diseases, such as periprosthetic osteolysis and osteoporosis.—Zhou, Y., Mohan, A., Moore, D.

The endpoint was proven CAD, defined as a significant stenosis at angiography or the diagnosis of a non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction or cardiovascular death within six weeks after presentation at the ED. Twelve clinical symptoms and seven cardiovascular risk factors were collected. Potential predictors of CAD with a p-value <0.15 in the univariable analysis were included in a multivariable model. The diagnostic value of clinical symptoms and cardiovascular risk factors was quantified in women and men separately and areas under the curve (AUC) were compared between sexes.A total of 2433 patients were included. We excluded 102 patients (4%) with either an incomplete follow up or ST-elevation. Of the remaining 2331 patients 43% (1003) were women. CAD was present in 111 (11%) women and 278 (21%) men. In women 11 out of 12 and in men 10 out of 12 clinical symptoms were univariably associated with CAD. The AUC of symptoms alone was 0.74 (95%CI: 0.69-0.79) in women and 0.71 (95%CI: 0.68-0.75) in men and increased to respectively 0.79 (95%CI: 0.74-0.83) in women versus 0.75 (95%CI: 0.72-0.78) in men after adding cardiovascular risk factors. The AUCs of women and men were not significantly different (p-value symptoms alone: 0.45, after adding cardiovascular risk factors: 0.11).The diagnostic value of clinical symptoms and cardiovascular risk factors for the diagnosis of CAD in chest pain patients presenting on the ED was high in women and men.

FXII is predominantly synthesized in the liver and is composed of fibronectin type I and type II domains, two epidermal growth factor-like domains, a kringle region, a proline-rich domain, and a catalytic domain (1Stavrou E.

Negatively charged surfaces promote FXII autoactivation by inducing a conformational change in the zymogen resulting in its enhanced susceptibility to proteolytic cleavage and the formation of FXIIa. FXIIa triggers the intrinsic coagulation pathway via activation of factor XI. It initiates the classical complement pathway and converts prekallikrein to kallikrein, which in turn reciprocally activates FXII and liberates bradykinin from high molecular weight kininogen (3Renné T.

The importance of heparin, a highly sulfated GAG, in the modulation of plasma contact system activity was stressed by Hojima et al. (4Hojima Y. Cochrane C.G. Wiggins R.C. Austen K.F. Stevens R.L. In vitro activation of the contact (Hageman factor) system of plasma by heparin and chondroitin sulfate E.Blood. 1984; 63: 1453-1459Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), who reported that autoactivation and reciprocal activation of FXII critically depend on a heparin negative charge. Interestingly, heparin-initiated FXII activation promoted bradykinin, but not FXIa, formation, suggesting that heparin, via its ability to modulate FXIIa generation, stimulates the kallikrein-kinin system, whereas the intrinsic coagulation cascade remains unaffected (5Oschatz C.

Although all aforementioned receptors are structurally unrelated, with no common FXII binding sites being characterized, they are identified as glycoproteins. GPIbα, for example, contains a considerable amount of O-glycans rich in sialic acid residues, and u-PAR is subjected to extensive N-linked glycosylation (13Ploug M. Rahbek-Nielsen H. Nielsen P.F.

In view of these findings and taking into account the important role of GAGs in the modulation of FXIIa activity, we speculated that GAG may also contribute to the binding of FXIIa to the cell surface. To verify this assumption, we used a combined strategy of enzymatic digestion, metabolic inhibition, and recombinant overexpression and found that FXIIa utilizes the heparan sulfate (HS) component of proteoglycans (PGs) to bind to the surface of the cells.

Cycling conditions were 95 °C for 6 min, followed by 40 cycles of 95 °C for 20 s, 58 °C for 30 s, and 73 °C for 30 s. Due to the non-selective dsDNA binding of the SYBR Green dye, melting curve analysis and gel electrophoresis were performed to confirm the exclusive amplification of the expected PCR product. All changes in the target gene mRNA levels are presented as ΔCq, which was calculated by subtracting the Cq value of the target gene from the Cq value of the reference gene. The higher values of ΔCq correspond to higher relative expression of the gene of interest. Cells were lysed in ice-cold lysis buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 1% Triton X-100, 2.5 μm sodium pyrophosphate, 1 mm β-glycerophosphate, 1 mm Na3VO4, 1 mm PMSF, 1 μg/ml Complete protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science)). Protein lysates were separated on a 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel under reducing conditions, followed by electrotransfer to a PVDF membrane. After blocking, the membrane was probed with a mouse anti-His tag antibody (Millipore, Schwalbach, Germany; catalog no. 70796). Afterward, the membrane was incubated with peroxidase-labeled secondary antibody (Dako, Gostrup, Denmark). Final detection of proteins was performed using an ECL Plus kit (Amersham Biosciences). To determine the amounts of protein loaded on the gel, the blot was stripped and reprobed using mouse anti-β-actin (Sigma-Aldrich; catalog no. A2228) antibody. One mg of FXIIa was labeled using the EZ-Link® sulfo-NHS-biotinylation kit (Thermo Scientific, Erlangen, Germany) according to the manufacturer's instruction. Alternatively, FXIIa was labeled with Alexa Fluor® 546 dye (Life Technologies) using the APEXTM antibody labeling kit (Life Technologies) according to the instructions provided by the manufacturer. For immunocytochemical analysis, CHO cells either untreated or treated with 0.0016 IU of heparinase I overnight were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 10 min, blocked with 1% bovine serum albumin (BSA) in PBS for 1 h at room temperature, and incubated overnight at 4 °C with a mouse anti-HS antibody. Afterward, the slides were incubated with a fluorescein-conjugated secondary antibody (Dianova, Hamburg, Germany) and mounted with Vectashield mounting medium (Vector, Burlingame, CA). Nuclei were visualized by 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI; Sigma-Aldrich) staining. Controls were performed by substituting the primary antibody with a species-matched isotype control. The images were captured by a Leica DMR microscope (Leica, Heidelberg, Germany) with a ×63/1.25–0.75 numerical aperture oil objective. All images illustrated are representative of at least four other areas per section, seen on at least three independent sections. To monitor binding of FXIIa to HLF, cells were fixed and blocked as detailed above and incubated with Alexa Fluor® 546-labeled FXIIa overnight at 4 °C. Slides were analyzed by confocal laser-scanning microscopy using a ×63/1.4 numerical aperture plan apochromat oil objective (LSM 780, Carl Zeiss). Fibroblasts or CHO cells were seeded in 96-well plates, cultured overnight, and then washed several times with HEPES-Tyrode's buffer (135 mm NaCl, 2.7 mm KCl, 11.9 mm NaHCO3, 0.36 mm NaH2PO4, 14.7 mm HEPES, 50 μm ZnCl2, 1 mm MgCl2, 2 mm CaCl2, 3.5 mg/ml BSA, 3.5 mg/ml glucose, pH 7.4). Cells were incubated for 1 h at 37 °C with 2.75 μg/ml FXIIa in the absence or presence of heparin, HS, dermatan sulfate (DS), dextran sulfate (DxS), glucose (100 μg/ml each), CS-A, or CS-C (both 200 μg/ml) in HEPES-Tyrode's buffer. In some experiments, cells were preincubated for 60 min at 37 °C with various concentrations of sialidase or N-glycosidase F; for 3 min at 37 °C with various concentrations of trypsin, papain, or proteinase K; for 2, 3, or 4 days with various concentrations of β-d-xyloside or tunicamycin; for 2 days with 10 mm Na3ClO3 and/or 30 mm Na2SO4; for 2 h with 0.004 units of chondroitinase ABC; or overnight with various concentrations of heparinase I or heparinase III. Afterward, the cells were washed with HEPES-Tyrode's buffer and then incubated with goat anti-FXII antibody (Zytomed Systems, Berlin, Germany; catalog no. 206-0056). FXII binding to the cells was detected using horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-goat antibody (Dako) and the peroxidase-specific substrate 3,3′,5,5′-tetramethylbenzidine dihydrochloride (TMB; Thermo Fisher Scientific). Bound FXIIa was determined by measuring the absorbance at 450 nm using the microtiter plate reader (Molecular Devices, Biberach, Germany). Cell death was assessed by measuring the activity of cytoplasmic lactate dehydrogenase released into the cell culture medium using a cytotoxicity detection kit (Roche Applied Science) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Commercially available siRNA sequences directed against human u-PAR, HS6ST-1, and SDC-1 and a universal negative-control siRNA (all from Ambion, Austin, TX) were employed. Cells were treated with siRNAs (100 nm each) using the siLentFect lipid reagent (Bio-Rad) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The siRNA-mediated down-regulation of the target genes was assessed 24, 48, or 72 h after transfection by RT-qPCR or Western blotting. Twenty-four h after transfection, cells were seeded onto 96-well plates for a binding assay. Probe specific for mouse SDC-1 ectodomain 775-bp cDNA (232–1007 bp, X15487) was prepared by RT-PCR from mouse primary macrophages using sense primer (5′-TGCAGGATCCTGGGCAGCATGAGACGCGCGGCGCTCTGG-3′) and antisense primer (5′-CCGCTCGAGTCAGTGGTGATGGTGATGATGTCCCAGCACTTCCTTCCTGTCCAAAAGGCT-3′) containing His6 tag sequence and cloned into BamHI/SacII sites of vector pcDNA3.1(+) (Life Technologies). To reach high transfection efficiency, plasmids were transfected into HLF-1 using Lipofectamine® 2000 (Life Technologies) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Expression of His-tagged SDC-1 was confirmed by Western blotting 24 h after transfection. Eight h after transfection, cells were seeded onto 96-well plates for a binding assay. To assess FXIIa binding to GAGs a filter-binding assay was performed, where a nylon membrane was soaked with buffer A (10 mm Tris-Cl (pH 7.5), 50 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, and 1× Denhardt's solution (0.02% (m/v) Ficoll, 0.02% (m/v) polyvinylpyrrolidone, and 0.02% (m/v) BSA)) and fixed into a slot-blot apparatus. One hundred μl containing 10, 20, or 30 μg of DxS or DS; 2.5, 5, or 10 μg of heparin or HS; or 10, 20, or 40 μg of CS-A, CS-C, or CS-A/C were aspirated for 30 min through the filter and then cross-linked for 30 min by exposure to ultraviolet light (254 nm). After extensive washing with buffer A, the membrane was incubated at room temperature for 2 h with 10 μg/ml FXIIa in TBS containing 0.1% (v/v) Tween 20 (TBS-T), followed by incubation with goat antibody raised against FXII (Zytomed Systems) at 4 °C overnight. After extensive washing with TBS-T, the membrane was incubated with peroxidase-labeled secondary antibody (Dako), and FXIIa-GAG complexes were detected by enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL Plus kit, Amersham Biosciences). To demonstrate the efficiency of the GAG immobilization, the membrane was stained for 15 min with 0.1% toluidine blue (Serva, Heidelberg, Germany) in 10% (v/v) acetic acid and 40% (v/v) methanol. Heparin/GAG binding plates were coated with heparin, HS, DS, DxS, or glucose (25 μg/ml each) or with CS-A or CS-C (250 μg/ml each) according to the instructions provided by the manufacturer. The efficacy of GAG immobilization was controlled by the digoxigenin glycan detection kit (Roche Applied Science). The plates were washed three times with SAB buffer (100 mm NaCl, 50 mm sodium acetate, 0.2% Tween 20) and blocked with 1% BSA in PBS for 1 h at 37 °C. After washing the plates with SAB buffer, different concentrations of FXIIa/biot-FXIIa in SAB buffer were added into the wells, and HS, DS, DxS, CS-A, CS-C, or glucose was allowed to bind to FXIIa/biot-FXIIa for 2 h at 37 °C. After extensive washing with SAB buffer, bound FXIIa was detected using either goat anti-FXII antibody (Zytomed Systems) followed by peroxidase-labeled secondary antibody or peroxidase-labeled streptavidin (Dako). Final detection was performed using peroxidase-specific substrate, TMB. For competition experiments, the plates were coated with HS, heparin, or DS (25 μg/ml each), and serial dilutions of heparin, HS, DS, DxS, CS-A, CS-C, glucose, or unlabeled FXIIa were added simultaneously with FXIIa/biot-FXIIa into the wells. The uncoated plate was used as a control. FXIIa interaction with HS, DxS, or CS-A was determined by changes in the thermophoretic movement by means of the microscalethermophoresis binding assay (NanoTemper Technologies, Munich, Germany) as described previously (16Moreth K. Frey H. Hubo M. Zeng-Brouwers J. Nastase M.V. Hsieh L.T. Haceni R. Pfeilschifter J. Iozzo R.V. Schaefer L. Biglycan-triggered TLR-2- and TLR-4-signaling exacerbates the pathophysiology of ischemic acute kidney injury.Matrix Biol. 2014; 35: 143-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Briefly, FXIIa was labeled with the fluorophore NT-647 (Monolith NT Protein Labeling Kit, NanoTemper Technologies) in the presence of a small peptide-based inhibitor, Phe-Pro-Arg-chloromethylketone. An 11-fold titration series of HS, DxS, or CS-A (5 mm to 2.44 μm) diluted 1:1 with PBS containing 0.05% Tween 20 was prepared. The concentration of NT-647-labeled factor XIIa was kept constant at 250 nm. To enable binding, FXIIa was incubated with GAG for 30 min in the dark. The reaction was then aspirated into hydrophobic coated glass capillaries and sealed with wax. At a laser voltage of 30%, the thermophoretic movement of labeled proteins was monitored with a laser on for 30 s and off for 5 s. Fluorescence was measured before laser heating (FInitial) and after 30 s of laser-on time (FHot). Normalized fluorescence, FNorm = FHot/FInitial, represents the concentration ratio of labeled molecules. To obtain the relative change in fluorescence per mill, FNorm was plotted directly and multiplied by a factor of 10. KD was calculated with NanoTemper Software (NanoTemper Technologies) from at least three independent thermophoresis measurements. The presence of cell surface HS was detected using a 10E4 antibody. Donor or IPF HLF were seeded in 96-well plates (2 × 104 cells/well) and cultured overnight. On the following day, cells were washed with FCS-free medium and incubated with 0.001 IU of either heparinase I, II, or III in medium without FCS overnight. After the medium was removed, cells were washed with PBS and fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 10 min. Nonspecific binding sites were blocked by incubation with 0.1% BSA in PBS for 1 h. Next, cells were washed with PBS and incubated with 50 ng of 10E4 antibody at 4 °C overnight. Following the washing with PBS, cells were incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse antibody (Dako). Final detection was performed using peroxidase-specific substrate, TMB. HLF migratory potential was assessed using silicone cell culture inserts (Ibidi, Martinsried, Germany) attached to a 12-well plate. First, 5 × 104 cells were seeded into each silicone insert compartment and allowed to attach. Next, silicone cell culture inserts were removed, the gap area was photographed, and cells were treated with 0.0025 IU of heparinase I for 2 h in medium without FCS, followed by the addition of 0.7 μg of FXIIa. After 21 h, images of the gap area were taken, and the cells that had migrated into the gap area were counted using ImageJ (National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD). Comparison of multiple groups was performed by analysis of variance followed by Tukey’s post hoc test. For comparison of two groups, Student’s t test was used. p < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. Data are presented as mean ± S.D. Because FXII receptors do not share a common protein sequence motif that could serve as docking sites on the cell surface, we set out to evaluate whether their carbohydrate moieties may play a role in the FXII binding to the cell membrane. Employing a cell-based ELISA, we found that HLF robustly accommodated FXIIa on the cell surface (Fig. 1A). Pretreatment of HLF with sialidase, which hydrolyzes terminal sialic acid residues, or N-glycosidase F, which entirely cleaves off N-linked GAG chains, reduced FXIIa binding in a dose-dependent manner. This effect was potentiated when these two enzymes were applied simultaneously (Fig. 1B). In order to elucidate the role of the protein component in the association of FXIIa with HLF, the cells were preincubated with trypsin, papain, or proteinase K. Whereas pretreatment of HLF with trypsin diminished binding of FXIIa by 60% (Fig. 1C), minute amounts of papain and protease K caused cell loss, precluding the assessment of FXIIa interaction with the cell surface (data not shown). Together, these results indicate that glycoproteins/proteoglycans may be involved in the binding of FXIIa to the cell surface. We also monitored the binding of Alexa Fluor® 546-labeled FXIIa to HLF by an immunofluorescence analysis. A prominent pericellular staining, predominantly localized to cell-cell contacts and lamellopodia-like structures, was observed (Fig. 1D). Collectively, all of these experiments prompted the question of whether PG might contribute to the binding of FXIIa to the cell surface. To examine the role of PG GAG side chains in the interaction of FXIIa with HLF, the cells were treated with β-d-xyloside, an inhibitor of O-linked GAG attachment to the core protein, and thereafter the association of FXIIa with the cell membrane was studied. As illustrated in Fig. 2A, FXIIa binding was gradually decreased during incubation with increasing concentrations of β-d-xyloside. Moreover, prolonged incubation with β-d-xyloside resulted in pronounced reduction of FXIIa binding capacity (to 56% of control cells treated with the vehicle). In parallel, the impact of protein N-glycosylation on the attachment of FXIIa to HLF was investigated. Treatment of cells with tunicamycin, an inhibitor of N-linked oligosaccharide biosynthesis, resulted in a time- and concentration-dependent reduction of FXIIa binding to 50% of control cells grown in the presence of the vehicle (Fig. 2B). To exclude the possibility that the changes in FXIIa binding capacity of HLF result from cell damage caused by 4-day-long incubation of cells with 10 μm β-d-xyloside or 200 ng/ml tunicamycin, a lactate dehydrogenase cytotoxicity assay was performed. This experimental procedure revealed that β-d-xyloside and tunicamycin exhibited no cytotoxic effects on the cells (Fig. 2C). Furthermore, microscopic inspection of the cells treated for 4 days with β-d-xyloside or tunicamycin did not display any changes in the cell shape (Fig. 2D). In summary, these data suggest that PG-associated GAGs may contribute to the FXIIa binding to HLF. Previously, Badellino and Walsh (17Badellino K.O. Walsh P.N. Localization of a heparin binding site in the catalytic domain of factor XIa.Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 7569-7580Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar) provided evidence of a FXIIa interaction with immobilized heparin, a GAG structurally related to HS. Therefore, we wondered whether membrane-bound HS-PG might be involved in FXIIa accumulation on the fibroblast surface. Enzymatic digestion of surface HS by heparinase I or protein removal by trypsin treatment reduced FXIIa binding by 24 and 45%, respectively (Fig. 3A). This effect was potentiated when heparinase I and trypsin were appli"
https://openalex.org/W1967161058,"Mammographic density (MD), associated with higher water and lower fat content in the breast, is strongly related to breast cancer risk. Optical attenuation spectroscopy (OS) is a non-imaging method of evaluating breast tissue composition by red and near-infrared light transmitted through the breast that, unlike mammography, does not involve radiation. OS provides information on wavelength dependent light scattering of tissue and on absorption by water, lipid, oxy-, deoxy-hemoglobin. We propose that OS could be an alternative marker of breast cancer risk and that OS breast tissue measures will be associated with MD. In the present analysis, we developed an algorithm to estimate breast tissue composition and light scattering parameters using a spectrally constrained global fitting procedure employing a diffuse light transport model. OS measurements were obtained from 202 pre- and post-menopausal women with normal mammograms. Percent density (PD) and dense area (DA) were measured using Cumulus. The association between OS tissue composition and PD and DA was analyzed using linear regression adjusted for body mass index. Among pre-menopausal women, lipid content was significantly inversely associated with square root transformed PD (β = -0.05, p = 0.0002) and DA (β = -0.05, p = 0.019); water content was significantly positively associated with PD (β = 0.06, p = 0.008). Tissue oxygen saturation was marginally inversely associated with PD (β = -0.03, p = 0.057) but significantly inversely associated with DA (β = -0.10, p = 0.002). Among post-menopausal women lipid and water content were significantly associated (negatively and positively, respectively) with PD (βlipid = -0.08, βwater = 0.14, both p<0.0001) and DA (βlipid = -0.10, p<0.0001; βwater = 0.11, p = 0.001). The association between OS breast content and PD and DA is consistent with more proliferation in dense tissue of younger women, greater lipid content in low density tissue and higher water content in high density tissue. OS may be useful for assessing physiologic tissue differences related to breast cancer risk, particularly when mammography is not feasible or easily accessible."
https://openalex.org/W2032908421,"The erythrocyte binding ligand 140 (EBA-140) is a member of the Plasmodium falciparum DBL family of erythrocyte binding proteins, which are considered as prospective candidates for malaria vaccine development. The EBA-140 ligand is a paralogue of the well-characterized P. falciparum EBA-175 protein. They share homology of domain structure, including Region II, which consists of two homologous F1 and F2 domains and is responsible for ligand-erythrocyte receptor interaction during invasion. In this report we describe, for the first time, the glycophorin C specificity of the recombinant, baculovirus-expressed binding region (Region II) of P. falciparum EBA-140 ligand. It was found that the recombinant EBA-140 Region II binds to the endogenous and recombinant glycophorin C, but does not bind to Gerbich-type glycophorin C, neither normal nor recombinant, which lacks amino acid residues 36–63 of its polypeptide chain. Our results emphasize the crucial role of this glycophorin C region in EBA-140 ligand binding. Moreover, the EBA-140 Region II did not bind either to glycophorin D, the truncated form of glycophorin C lacking the N-glycan or to desialylated GPC. These results draw attention to the role of glycophorin C glycans in EBA-140 binding. The full identification of the EBA-140 binding site on glycophorin C molecule, consisting most likely of its glycans and peptide backbone, may help to design therapeutics or vaccines that target the erythrocyte binding merozoite ligands."
https://openalex.org/W2072313641,"A key element to delineate the biology of individual tumors is the regulation of apoptosis. In this work, we functionally characterize two breast cancer associated genes, the proteasome 26S subunit ATPase 3 interacting protein (PSMC3IP) and the epithelial-stromal interaction 1 (EPSTI1), to explore their potential apoptotic role in breast cancer. We first explore the existence of direct physical interactions with annotated BC-apoptotic genes. Based on the generated interaction network, we examine several apoptotic markers to determine the effect of PSMC3IP and EPSTI1 gene expression modulation in two different human breast cancer cell lines to suggest potential molecular mechanisms to unveil their role in the disease. Our results show that PSMC3IP and EPSTI1 are able to modulate the extrinsic apoptotic pathway in estrogen receptor positive and triple negative breast cancer cell lines, highlighting them as potential therapeutic targets."
https://openalex.org/W2150155316,"Thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) has been shown to play an important role in the regulation of triglyceride (TG) metabolism in adipose tissue. Adipose triglyceride lipase (ATGL) is a rate-limiting enzyme controlling the hydrolysis of TG. Thus far, it is unclear whether TSH has a direct effect on the expression of ATGL. Because TSH function is mediated through the TSH receptor (TSHR), TSHR knockout mice (Tshr-/- mice) (supplemented with thyroxine) were used in this study to determine the effects of TSHR deletion on ATGL expression. These effects were verified in 3T3-L1 adipocytes and potential underlying mechanisms were explored. In the Tshr-/- mice, ATGL expression in epididymal adipose tissue was significantly increased compared with that in Tshr+/+ mice. ATGL expression was observed to increase with the differentiation process of 3T3-L1 preadipocytes. In mature 3T3-L1 adipocytes, TSH significantly suppressed ATGL expression at both the protein and mRNA levels in a dose-dependent manner. Forskolin, which is an activator of adenylate cyclase, suppressed the expression of ATGL in 3T3-L1 adipocytes. The inhibitory effects of TSH on ATGL expression were abolished by H89, which is a protein kinase A (PKA) inhibitor. These results indicate that TSH has an inhibitory effect on ATGL expression in mature adipocytes. The associated mechanism is related to PKA activation."
https://openalex.org/W1982002044,"Helicobacter pylori and latent toxoplasmosis are widespread diseases that have been associated with cognitive deficits and Alzheimer’s disease. We sought to determine whether interactions between Helicobacter pylori and latent toxoplasmosis, age, race-ethnicity, educational attainment, economic status, and general health predict cognitive function in young and middle-aged adults. To do so, we used multivariable regression and multivariate models to analyze data obtained from the United States’ National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, which can be weighted to represent the US population. In this sample, we found that 31.6 percent of women and 36.2 percent of men of the overall sample had IgG Antibodies against Helicobacter pylori, although the seroprevalence of Helicobacter pylori varied with sociodemographic variables. There were no main effects for Helicobacter pylori or latent toxoplasmosis for any of the cognitive measures in models adjusting for age, sex, race-ethnicity, educational attainment, economic standing, and self-rated health predicting cognitive function. However, interactions between Helicobacter pylori and race-ethnicity, educational attainment, latent toxoplasmosis in the fully adjusted models predicted cognitive function. People seropositive for both Helicobacter pylori and latent toxoplasmosis – both of which appear to be common in the general population – appear to be more susceptible to cognitive deficits than are people seropositive for either Helicobacter pylori and or latent toxoplasmosis alone, suggesting a synergistic effect between these two infectious diseases on cognition in young to middle-aged adults."
https://openalex.org/W2129940109,"Norovirus (NoV) is a leading cause of gastroenteritis and genotype II.4 (GII.4) is responsible for the majority of nosocomial NoV infections. Our objective was to examine whether sequencing of the capsid gene might be a useful tool for the hospital outbreak investigation to define possible transmission routes. All NoV positive samples submitted from one university hospital during the 2007/8 season were selected. Genotyping of selected samples by partial polymerase gene sequencing had shown that the majority belonged to the GII.4 variant Den Haag 2006b and had identical polymerase sequences. Sequences of the capsid gene (1412 nucleotides) were obtained from the first available sample from 55 patients. From six immunocompromised patients with persistent infections a second sample was also included. As a control for a point-source outbreak, five samples from a foodborne outbreak caused by the same GII.4 variant were analyzed. Forty-seven of the inpatients (85%) were infected with the GII.4 variant Den Haag 2006b. Phylogenetic analysis of the Den Haag 2006b sequences identified four distinct outbreaks in different departments and a fifth outbreak with possible inter-department spread. In addition, a more heterogeneous cluster with evidence of repeated introductions from the community, but also possible inter-department spread was observed. In all six patients with paired sequences, evidence for in vivo evolution of the virus was found. Capsid gene sequencing showed substantial sequence variation among NoV GII.4 variant Den Haag 2006b strains from one single institution during a nine months' period. This method proved useful to understand the local epidemiology and, when used promptly, has the potential to make infection control measures more targeted."
https://openalex.org/W2019762338,"This study examined the effects of speed and leg prostheses on mediolateral (ML) foot placement and its variability in sprinters with and without transtibial amputations. We hypothesized that ML foot placement variability would: 1. increase with running speed up to maximum speed and 2. be symmetrical between the legs of non-amputee sprinters but asymmetrically greater for the affected leg of sprinters with a unilateral transtibial amputation. We measured the midline of the body (kinematic data) and center of pressure (kinetic data) in the ML direction while 12 non-amputee sprinters and 7 Paralympic sprinters with transtibial amputations (6 unilateral, 1 bilateral) ran across a range of speeds up to maximum speed on a high-speed force measuring treadmill. We quantified ML foot placement relative to the body’s midline and its variability. We interpret our results with respect to a hypothesized relation between ML foot placement variability and lateral balance. We infer that greater ML foot placement variability indicates greater challenges with maintaining lateral balance. In non-amputee sprinters, ML foot placement variability for each leg increased substantially and symmetrically across speed. In sprinters with a unilateral amputation, ML foot placement variability for the affected and unaffected leg also increased substantially, but was asymmetric across speeds. In general, ML foot placement variability for sprinters with a unilateral amputation was within the range observed in non-amputee sprinters. For the sprinter with bilateral amputations, both affected legs exhibited the greatest increase in ML foot placement variability with speed. Overall, we find that maintaining lateral balance becomes increasingly challenging at faster speeds up to maximum speed but was equally challenging for sprinters with and without a unilateral transtibial amputation. Finally, when compared to all other sprinters in our subject pool, maintaining lateral balance appears to be the most challenging for the Paralympic sprinter with bilateral transtibial amputations."
https://openalex.org/W1981459235,"Microtubule binding protein tau has a crucial function in promoting the assembly and stabilization of microtubule. Besides tuning the action potentials, voltage-gated K+ channels (Kv) are important for cell proliferation and appear to play a role in the development of cancer. However, little is known about the possible interaction of tau with Kv channels in various tissues. In the present study, tau plasmids were transiently transfected into mouse neuroblastoma N2A cells to explore the possible linkages between tau and Kv channels. This treatment led to a downregulation of mRNA levels of several Kv channels, including Kv2.1, Kv3.1, Kv4.1, Kv9.2, and KCNH4, but no significant alteration was observed for Kv5.1 and KCNQ4. Furthermore, the macroscopic currents through Kv channels were reduced by 36.5% at +60 mV in tau-transfected N2A cells. The proliferation rates of N2A cells were also improved by the induction of tau expression and the incubation of TEA (tetraethylammonium) for 48 h by 120.9% and 149.3%, respectively. Following the cotransfection with tau in HEK293 cells, the mRNA levels and corresponding currents of Kv2.1 were significantly declined compared with single Kv2.1 transfection. Our data indicated that overexpression of tau declined the mRNA levels of Kv channels and related currents. The effects of tau overexpression on Kv channels provided an alternative explanation for low sensitivity to anti-cancer chemicals in some specific cancer tissues."
https://openalex.org/W1965613405,"The adverse effects of microcystin (MC) produced by cyanobacteria have drawn considerable attention from the public. Yet it remains unclear whether MC confers any benefits to the cyanobacteria themselves. One suggested function of MC is complexation, which may influence the bioaccumulation and toxicity of trace metals. To test this hypothesis, we examined Cd toxicity to wild-type Microcystis aeruginosa PCC 7806 (WT) and its MC-lacking mutant (MT) under nutrient-enriched (+NP), phosphorus-limited (-P), and nitrogen-limited (-N) conditions. The accumulation of Cd and the biochemical parameters associated with its detoxification [total phosphorus (TP), inorganic polyphosphate (Poly-P), and glutathione (GSH) in the cells as well as intra- and extra-cellular carbohydrates] were quantified. Although the -P cyanobacteria accumulated less Cd than their +NP and -N counterparts, the different nutrient-conditioned cyanobacteria were similarly inhibited by similar free ion concentration of Cd in the medium ([Cd2+]F). Such good toxicity predictability of [Cd2+]F was ascribed to the synchronous decrease in the intracellular concentrations of Cd and TP. Nevertheless, Cd toxicity was still determined by the intracellular Cd to phosphorus ratio (Cd/P), in accordance with what has been reported in the literature. On the other hand, the concentrations of TP, Poly-P, and carbohydrates went up, but GSH concentration dropped down with the enhancement of [Cd2+]F, indicating their association with Cd detoxification. Although the inactivation of MC peptide synthetase gene had some nutrient and Cd concentration dependent effects on the parameters above, both cyanobacterial strains showed the same Cd accumulation ability and displayed similar Cd sensitivity. These results suggest that MC cannot affect metal toxicity either by regulating metal accumulation or by altering the detoxification ability of the cyanobacteria. Other possible functions of MC need to be further investigated."
https://openalex.org/W1974135811,"Phytohormones play a critical role in mediating plant stress response. They employ a variety of proteins for coordinating such processes. In Arabidopsis thaliana, some members of a Cys-rich protein family known as C1-clan proteins were involved in stress response, but the actual function of the protein family is largely unknown. We studied At5g17960, a C1-clan protein member that possesses three unique C1 signature domains viz. C1_2, C1_3 and ZZ/PHD type. Additionally, we identified 72 other proteins in A. thaliana that contain all three unique signature domains. Subsequently, the 73 proteins were phylogenetically classified into IX subgroups. Promoter motif analysis of the 73 genes identified the presence of hormone-responsive and stress-responsive putative cis-regulatory elements. Furthermore, we observed that transcript levels of At5g17960 were induced in response to different hormones and stress treatments. At1g35610 and At3g13760, two other members of subgroup IV, also showed upregulation upon GA3, biotic and abiotic stress treatments. Moreover, seedlings of independent transgenic A. thaliana lines ectopically expressing or suppressing At5g17960 also showed differential regulation of several abiotic stress-responsive marker genes. Thus, our data suggest that C1-domain-containing proteins have a role to play in plant hormone-mediated stress responses, thereby assigning a putative function for the C1-clan protein family."
https://openalex.org/W2076239628,"Comparing adaptations to noisy city environments with those to natural mountain environments on the community level can provide significant insights that allow an understanding of the impact of anthropogenic noise on invertebrates that employ loud calling songs for mate attraction, especially when each species has its distinct song, as in the case of cicadas. In this study, we investigated the partitioning strategy of cicada assemblages in city and mountain environments by comparing the acoustic features and calling activity patterns of each species, recorded using automated digital recording systems. Our comparison of activity patterns of seasonal and diel calling revealed that there was no significant temporal partitioning of cicada assemblages in either environment. In addition, there was no correlation between the acoustic distance based on spectral features and temporal segregation. Heterospecific spectral overlap was low in both city and mountain environments, although city and mountain cicada assemblages were subject to significantly different levels of anthropogenic or interspecific noise. Furthermore, for the common species found in both environments, the calling activity patterns at both seasonal and diel time scales were significantly consistent across sites and across environments. We suggest that the temporal calling activity is constrained by endogenous factors for each species and is less flexible in response to external factors, such as anthropogenic noise. As a result, cicada assemblages in city environments with low species diversity do not demonstrate a more significant temporal partitioning than those in mountain environments with high species diversity."

The main objective of this study was to identify metabolites of androstenone, 17β-estradiol and dihydrotestosterone using primary cultured pig hepatocytes as a model system. The role of 3β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (3βHSD) in regulation of steroid metabolism was also validated using trilostane, a specific 3βHSD inhibitor. Steroid glucuronide conjugated metabolites were detected by liquid chromatography time of flight mass spectrometry (LC-TOF-MS). 3βHSD enzyme was essential for metabolism of androstenone to 5α-androst-16-en-3β-ol, which then formed androstenone glucuronide conjugate. Metabolism of 17β-estradiol was accompanied by formation of glucuronide-conjugated estrone and glucuronide-conjugated estradiol. The ratio of the two metabolites was around 5∶1. 3βHSD enzyme was not involved in 17β-estradiol metabolism. 5α-Dihydrotestosterone-17β-glucuronide was identified as a dihydrotestosterone metabolite, and this metabolism was related to 3βHSD enzyme activity as demonstrated by inhibition study."

We identified 9944 patients with antiarrhythmic history who were first diagnosed as having MNLIHD between 2005 and 2010. We identified an additional 19,497 patients with antiarrhythmic history in the same period who did not develop MNLIHD and were frequency-matched using age, sex, and index year to form a control group. Five commercially available antiarrhythmic agents, amiodarone, mexiletine, propafenone, quinidine, and procainamide, were analyzed.The adjusted odds ratio (OR) of MNLIHD was 1.60 (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.45-1.77) for amiodarone users versus nonamiodarone users. In subgroup analysis, amiodarone use was significantly associated with an increased risk of MNLIHD with an adjusted OR of 18.0 (95% CI, 15.7-20.5) for patients with comorbidities compared to an OR of 2.43 (95% CI, 1.92-3.06) for those without comorbidities. After adjustment for age, sex, statins, anti-diabetes medications, non-steroidal antiinflammatory drugs, propafenone use, quinidine use, and comorbidities, the ORs were 1.49, 1.66, and 1.79 for MNLIHD associated with annual mean defined daily doses of ≤ 30, 31-145, and >145, respectively.The results of the present study indicated that amiodarone might be associated with the development of MNLIHD in a dose-dependent manner, particularly among patients with comorbidities."
https://openalex.org/W2097529891,"This paper proposes a remarkably facile staining protocol to visually investigate dynamic physiological events in insect tissues. We attempted to monitor Ca2+ dynamics during contraction of electrically stimulated living muscle. Advances in circuit miniaturization and insect neuromuscular physiology have enabled the hybridization of living insects and man-made electronic components, such as microcomputers, the result of which has been often referred as a Living Machine, Biohybrid, or Cyborg Insect. In order for Cyborg Insects to be of practical use, electrical stimulation parameters need to be optimized to induce desired muscle response (motor action) and minimize the damage in the muscle due to the electrical stimuli. Staining tissues and organs as well as measuring the dynamics of chemicals of interest in muscle should be conducted to quantitatively and systematically evaluate the effect of various stimulation parameters on the muscle response. However, existing staining processes require invasive surgery and/or arduous procedures using genetically encoded sensors. In this study, we developed a non-invasive and remarkably facile method for staining, in which chemical indicators can be orally administered (oral dosing). A chemical Ca2+ indicator was orally introduced into an insect of interest via food containing the chemical indicator and the indicator diffused from the insect digestion system to the target muscle tissue. We found that there was a positive relationship between the fluorescence intensity of the indicator and the frequency of electrical stimulation which indicates the orally dosed indicator successfully monitored Ca2+ dynamics in the muscle tissue. This oral dosing method has a potential to globally stain tissues including neurons, and investigating various physiological events in insects."
https://openalex.org/W2054042375,"Recent evidence indicates that comparison of two similar faces can aid subsequent discrimination between them. However, the fact that discrimination between two faces is facilitated by comparing them directly does not demonstrate that comparison produces a general improvement in the processing of faces. It remains an open question whether the opportunity to compare a ""target"" face to similar faces can facilitate the discrimination of the exposed target face from other nonexposed faces. In Experiment 1, selection of a target face from an array of novel foils was not facilitated by intermixed exposure to the target and comparators of the same sex. Experiment 2 also found no advantage for similar comparators (morphed towards the target) over unmorphed same sex comparators, or over repeated target exposure alone. But all repeated exposure conditions produced better performance than a single brief presentation of the target. Experiment 3 again demonstrated that repeated exposure produced equivalent learning in same sex and different sex comparator conditions, and also showed that increasing the number of same sex or different sex comparators failed to improve identification. In all three experiments, exposure to a target alongside similar comparators failed to support selection of the target from novel test stimuli to a greater degree than exposure alongside dissimilar comparators or repeated target exposure alone. The current results suggest that the facilitatory effects of comparison during exposure may be limited to improving discrimination between exposed stimuli, and thus our results do not support the idea that providing the opportunity for comparison is a practical means for improving face identification."
