https://openalex.org/W3177903130,"The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic continues to be a global health concern. The mRNA-1273 (Moderna) vaccine was reported to have an efficacy of 94.1% at preventing symptomatic COVID-19 due to infection with ‘wild-type’ variants in a randomized clinical trial. Here, we assess the real-world effectiveness of this vaccine against SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern, specifically B.1.1.7 (Alpha) and B.1.351 (Beta), in Qatar, a population that comprises mainly working-age adults, using a matched test-negative, case-control study design. We show that vaccine effectiveness was negligible for 2 weeks after the first dose, but increased rapidly in the third and fourth weeks immediately before administration of a second dose. Effectiveness against B.1.1.7 infection was 88.1% (95% confidence interval (CI): 83.7–91.5%) ≥14 days after the first dose but before the second dose, and was 100% (95% CI: 91.8–100.0%) ≥14 days after the second dose. Analogous effectiveness against B.1.351 infection was 61.3% after the first dose (95% CI: 56.5–65.5%) and 96.4% after the second dose (95% CI: 91.9–98.7%). Effectiveness against any severe, critical or fatal COVID-19 disease due to any SARS-CoV-2 infection (predominantly B.1.1.7 and B.1.351) was 81.6% (95% CI: 71.0–88.8%) and 95.7% (95% CI: 73.4–99.9%) after the first and second dose, respectively. The mRNA-1273 vaccine is highly effective against B.1.1.7 and B.1.351 infections, whether symptomatic or asymptomatic, and against any COVID-19 hospitalization and death, even after a single dose. A matched test-negative, case-control study using real-world data from a predominantly working-age population demonstrates efficacy of the mRNA-1273 vaccine to be 100% and 96.4% against the B.1.1.7 (Alpha) and B.1.351 (Beta) SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern, respectively."

Direct dehydrogenation catalysts consisting of platinum–tin alloy nanoparticles supported on alumina often must run with hydrogen dilution to avoid carbon buildup and excess tin to avoid alloy segregation. Motagamwala et al. report that platinum–tin nanoparticles interact more weakly with a silica support and the metals thus do not segregate. The use of undiluted reactants allowed the reaction to run near the thermodynamically limit of about 67% conversion with a selectivity to propylene of more than 99%. This catalyst also does not build up carbon and could run up to 30 hours without deactivation. Science , abg7894, this issue p. 217"
https://openalex.org/W3178716999,"Clinical evidence suggests the central nervous system is frequently impacted by SARS-CoV-2 infection, either directly or indirectly, although the mechanisms are unclear. Pericytes are perivascular cells within the brain that are proposed as SARS-CoV-2 infection points. Here we show that pericyte-like cells (PLCs), when integrated into a cortical organoid, are capable of infection with authentic SARS-CoV-2. Before infection, PLCs elicited astrocytic maturation and production of basement membrane components, features attributed to pericyte functions in vivo. While traditional cortical organoids showed little evidence of infection, PLCs within cortical organoids served as viral 'replication hubs', with virus spreading to astrocytes and mediating inflammatory type I interferon transcriptional responses. Therefore, PLC-containing cortical organoids (PCCOs) represent a new 'assembloid' model that supports astrocytic maturation as well as SARS-CoV-2 entry and replication in neural tissue; thus, PCCOs serve as an experimental model for neural infection."
https://openalex.org/W3177628340,"An antiviral Dicer defends stem cells Stem cells have a pivotal role in maintaining tissue architecture, integrity, and renewal. Poirier et al. demonstrate that mammalian stem cells can protect themselves from some RNA viruses by expressing an alternatively spliced isoform of the enzyme Dicer called aviD, which potentiates antiviral RNA interference (see the Perspective by Shahrudin and Ding). aviD acts by cleaving long, base-paired viral RNAs to generate small interfering RNAs that direct the sequence-specific cleavage of homologous viral RNAs. This process is reminiscent of that in insects and worms, which also use Dicer-dependent RNA interference in antiviral defense, and contrasts with mammalian differentiated cells, which generally rely on the interferon system to combat virus infection.

https://openalex.org/W3179425616,"From savory to sweet Seeing a bird eat nectar from a flower is a common sight in our world. The ability to detect sugars, however, is not ancestral in the bird lineage, where most species were carnivorous. Toda et al. looked at receptors within the largest group of birds, the passerines or songbirds, and found that the emergence of sweet detection involved a single shift in a receptor for umami (see the Perspective by Barker). This ancient change facilitated sugar detection not just in nectar feeding birds, but also across the songbird group, and in a way that was different from, though convergent with, that in hummingbirds.

https://openalex.org/W3180515730,"Astrocytes play an essential role in the development of neural circuits by positioning transporters and receptors near synapses and secreting factors that promote synaptic maturation. However, the mechanisms that coordinate astrocyte and neural maturation remain poorly understood. Using in vivo imaging in unanesthetized neonatal mice, we show that bursts of neuronal activity passing through nascent sound processing networks reliably induce calcium transients in astrocytes. Astrocyte transients were dependent on intense neuronal activity and constrained to regions near active synapses, ensuring close spatial and temporal coordination of neuron and astrocyte activity. Astrocyte responses were restricted to the pre-hearing period and induced by synergistic activation of two metabotropic glutamate receptors, mGluR5 and mGluR3, which promoted IP3R2-dependent calcium release from intracellular stores. The widespread expression of these receptors by astrocytes during development and the prominence of neuronal burst firing in emerging neural networks may help coordinate the maturation of excitatory synapses."
https://openalex.org/W3180344846,"Navigation occurs through a continuum of space and time. The hippocampus is known to encode the immediate position of moving animals. However, active navigation, especially at high speeds, may require representing navigational information beyond the present moment. Using wireless electrophysiological recordings in freely flying bats, we demonstrate that neural activity in area CA1 predominantly encodes nonlocal spatial information up to meters away from the bat's present position. This spatiotemporal representation extends both forward and backward in time, with an emphasis on future locations, and is found during both random exploration and goal-directed navigation. The representation of position thus extends along a continuum, with each moment containing information about past, present, and future, and may provide a key mechanism for navigating along self-selected and remembered paths."

A notable exception to this rule is the sea otter, a species that is orders of magnitude smaller and skinnier than the others. It is known that the sea otter's unusually thick fur helps, but Wright et al. show that they are also internally warmed by thermogenic leak from skeletal muscle, a process that elevates their metabolic rate three times above that expected for their size. This mechanism is present even in infants with immature muscles, providing these animals with internal warmth from birth. Science , abf4557, this issue p. 223"
https://openalex.org/W3178853107,"RNA-binding proteins play crucial roles in various cellular functions and contain abundant disordered protein regions. The disordered regions in RNA-binding proteins are rich in repetitive sequences, such as poly-K/R, poly-N/Q, poly-A, and poly-G residues. Our bioinformatic analysis identified a largely neglected repetitive sequence family we define as electronegative clusters (ENCs) that contain acidic residues and/or phosphorylation sites. The abundance and length of ENCs exceed other known repetitive sequences. Despite their abundance, the functions of ENCs in RNA-binding proteins are still elusive. To investigate the impacts of ENCs on protein stability, RNA-binding affinity, and specificity, we selected one RNA-binding protein, the ribosomal biogenesis factor 15 (Nop15), as a model. We found that the Nop15 ENC increases protein stability and inhibits nonspecific RNA binding, but minimally interferes with specific RNA binding. To investigate the effect of ENCs on sequence specificity of RNA binding, we grafted an ENC to another RNA-binding protein, Ser/Arg-rich splicing factor 3. Using RNA Bind-n-Seq, we found that the engineered ENC inhibits disparate RNA motifs differently, instead of weakening all RNA motifs to the same extent. The motif site directly involved in electrostatic interaction is more susceptible to the ENC inhibition. These results suggest that one of functions of ENCs is to regulate RNA binding via electrostatic interaction. This is consistent with our finding that ENCs are also overrepresented in DNA-binding proteins, whereas underrepresented in halophiles, in which nonspecific nucleic acid binding is inhibited by high concentrations of salts."
https://openalex.org/W3181773057,"Phase II clinical trials have reported that acute treatment of surgical skin wounds with the therapeutic peptide alpha Connexin Carboxy-Terminus 1 (αCT1) improves cutaneous scar appearance by 47% 9-month postsurgery. While Cx43 and ZO-1 have been identified as molecular targets of αCT1, the mode-of-action of the peptide in scar mitigation at cellular and tissue levels remains to be further characterized. Scar histoarchitecture in αCT1 and vehicle-control treated skin wounds within the same patient were compared using biopsies from a Phase I clinical trial at 29-day postwounding. The sole effect on scar structure of a range of epidermal and dermal variables examined was that αCT1-treated scars had less alignment of collagen fibers relative to control wounds-a characteristic that resembles unwounded skin. The with-in subject effect of αCT1 on scar collagen order observed in Phase I testing in humans was recapitulated in Sprague-Dawley rats and the IAF hairless guinea pig. Transient increase in histologic collagen density in response to αCT1 was also observed in both animal models. Mouse NIH 3T3 fibroblasts and primary human dermal fibroblasts treated with αCT1 in vitro showed more rapid closure in scratch wound assays, with individual cells showing decreased directionality in movement. An agent-based computational model parameterized with fibroblast motility data predicted collagen alignments in simulated scars consistent with that observed experimentally in human and the animal models. In conclusion, αCT1 prompts decreased directionality of fibroblast movement and the generation of a 3D collagen matrix postwounding that is similar to unwounded skin-changes that correlate with long-term improvement in scar appearance."
https://openalex.org/W3142867995,"TBK1 responds to microbes to initiate cellular responses critical for host innate immune defense. We found previously that TBK1 phosphorylates mTOR (mechanistic target of rapamycin) on S2159 to increase mTOR complex 1 (mTORC1) signaling in response to the growth factor EGF and the viral dsRNA mimetic poly(I:C). mTORC1 and the less well studied mTORC2 respond to diverse cues to control cellular metabolism, proliferation, and survival. Although TBK1 has been linked to Akt phosphorylation, a direct relationship between TBK1 and mTORC2, an Akt kinase, has not been described. By studying MEFs lacking TBK1, as well as MEFs, macrophages, and mice bearing an Mtor S2159A knock-in allele (MtorA/A) using in vitro kinase assays and cell-based approaches, we demonstrate here that TBK1 activates mTOR complex 2 (mTORC2) directly to increase Akt phosphorylation. We find that TBK1 and mTOR S2159 phosphorylation promotes mTOR-dependent phosphorylation of Akt in response to several growth factors and poly(I:C). Mechanistically, TBK1 coimmunoprecipitates with mTORC2 and phosphorylates mTOR S2159 within mTORC2 in cells. Kinase assays demonstrate that TBK1 and mTOR S2159 phosphorylation increase mTORC2 intrinsic catalytic activity. Growth factors failed to activate TBK1 or increase mTOR S2159 phosphorylation in MEFs. Thus, basal TBK1 activity cooperates with growth factors in parallel to increase mTORC2 (and mTORC1) signaling. Collectively, these results reveal cross talk between TBK1 and mTOR, key regulatory nodes within two major signaling networks. As TBK1 and mTOR contribute to tumorigenesis and metabolic disorders, these kinases may work together in a direct manner in a variety of physiological and pathological settings."
https://openalex.org/W3181416442,"Human-wildlife conflict has direct and indirect consequences for human communities. Understanding how both types of conflict affect communities is crucial to developing comprehensive and sustainable mitigation strategies. We conducted an interview survey of 381 participants in two rural areas in Myanmar where communities were exposed to human-elephant conflict (HEC). In addition to documenting and quantifying the types of direct and indirect impacts experienced by participants, we evaluated how HEC influences people's attitudes towards elephant conservation. We found that 99% of participants suffered from some type of indirect impact from HEC, including fear for personal and family safety from elephants and fear that elephants will destroy their home. Despite experiencing moderate levels of indirect impacts from HEC at the community level, participants expressed attitudes consistent with supporting future elephant conservation programs."
https://openalex.org/W3181538448,"Background Emerging evidence suggests that there is significant variability in the progression of frailty in aging. We aimed to identify latent subpopulations of frailty trajectories, and examine their clinical and biological correlates. Methods We characterized frailty using a 41-item cumulative deficit score at baseline and annual visits up to 12 years in 681 older adults (55% women, mean age 74·6 years). Clinical risk profile and walking while talking performance as a clinical marker of trajectories were examined. Mortality risk associated with trajectories was evaluated using Cox regression adjusted for established survival predictors, and reported as hazard ratios (HR). Proteome-wide analysis was done. Findings Latent class modeling identified 4 distinct frailty trajectories: relatively stable (34·4%) as well as mild (36·1%), moderate (24·1%) and severely frail (5·4%). Four distinct classes of frailty trajectories were also shown in an independent sample of 515 older adults (60% women, 68% White, 26% Black). The stable group took a median of 31 months to accumulate one additional deficit compared to 20 months in the severely frail group. The worst trajectories were associated with modifiable risk factors such as low education, living alone, obesity, and physical inactivity as well as slower walking while talking speed. In the pooled sample, mild (HR 2·33, 95% CI 1·30–4·18), moderate (HR 2·49, 95% CI 1·33–4·66), and severely frail trajectories (HR 5·28, 95% CI 2·68–10·41) had higher mortality compared to the stable group. Proteomic analysis showed 11 proteins in lipid metabolism and growth factor pathways associated with frailty trajectories. Conclusion Frailty shows both stable and accelerated patterns in aging, which can be distinguished clinically and biologically."
https://openalex.org/W3182500974,"Membrane proteins have a range of crucial biological functions and are the target of about 60% of all prescribed drugs. For most studies, they need to be extracted out of the lipid-bilayer, e . g . by detergent solubilisation, leading to the loss of native lipids, which may disturb important protein-lipid/bilayer interactions and thus functional and structural integrity. Relipidation of membrane proteins has proven extremely successful for studying challenging targets, but the identification of suitable lipids can be expensive and laborious. Therefore, we developed a screen to aid the high-throughput identification of beneficial lipids. The screen covers a large lipid space and was designed to be suitable for a range of stability assessment methods. Here, we demonstrate its use as a tool for identifying stabilising lipids for three membrane proteins: a bacterial pyrophosphatase ( Tm -PPase), a fungal purine transporter (UapA) and a human GPCR (A 2A R). A 2A R is stabilised by cholesteryl hemisuccinate, a lipid well known to stabilise GPCRs, validating the approach. Additionally, our screen also identified a range of new lipids which stabilised our test proteins, providing a starting point for further investigation and demonstrating its value as a novel tool for membrane protein research. The pre-dispensed screen will be made commercially available to the scientific community in future and has a number of potential applications in the field."
https://openalex.org/W3178446512,"Segmentation of retinal vessels is important for doctors to diagnose some diseases. The segmentation accuracy of retinal vessels can be effectively improved by using deep learning methods. However, most of the existing methods are incomplete for shallow feature extraction, and some superficial features are lost, resulting in blurred vessel boundaries and inaccurate segmentation of capillaries in the segmentation results. At the same time, the “layer-by-layer” information fusion between encoder and decoder makes the feature information extracted from the shallow layer of the network cannot be smoothly transferred to the deep layer of the network, resulting in noise in the segmentation features. In this paper, we propose the MFI-Net (Multi-resolution fusion input network) network model to alleviate the above problem to a certain extent. The multi-resolution input module in MFI-Net avoids the loss of coarse-grained feature information in the shallow layer by extracting local and global feature information in different resolutions. We have reconsidered the information fusion method between the encoder and the decoder, and used the information aggregation method to alleviate the information isolation between the shallow and deep layers of the network. MFI-Net is verified on three datasets, DRIVE, CHASE_DB1 and STARE. The experimental results show that our network is at a high level in several metrics, with F1 higher than U-Net by 2.42%, 2.46% and 1.61%, higher than R2U-Net by 1.47%, 2.22% and 0.08%, respectively. Finally, this paper proves the robustness of MFI-Net through experiments and discussions on the stability and generalization ability of MFI-Net."
https://openalex.org/W3179000743,"Despite advances in breast cancer treatment, residual disease driven by dormant tumor cells continues to be a significant clinical problem. Leukemia inhibitory factor receptor (LIFR) promotes a dormancy phenotype in breast cancer cells and LIFR loss is correlated with poor patient survival. Herein, we demonstrate that histone deacetylase inhibitors (HDACi), which are in phase III clinical trials for breast cancer, epigenetically induced LIFR and activated a pro-dormancy program in breast cancer cells. HDACi slowed breast cancer cell proliferation and reduced primary tumor growth. Primary breast tumors from HDACi-treated patients had increased LIFR levels and reduced proliferation rates compared to pre-treatment levels. Recent Phase II clinical trial data studying entinostat and azacitidine in metastatic breast cancer revealed that induction of several pro-dormancy genes post-treatment was associated with prolonged patient survival. Together, these findings suggest HDACi as a potential therapeutic avenue to promote dormancy, prevent recurrence, and improve patient outcomes in breast cancer."
https://openalex.org/W3180263550,"The human fetal sphenoid is reported to have a cartilaginous connecting apparatus known as the alar process (AP), which connects the ala temporalis (AT) (angle of the greater wing of the sphenoid) to the basisphenoid (anlage of the sphenoid body). However, how the AP develops in humans is unclear. In addition, although the AP is a common structure of the mammalian chondrocranium, little is known about whether it is really a fundamental feature in mammals. This study examined the histological sections of 20 human embryos and fetuses from 6 to 14 weeks of development, of 20 mouse embryos from embryonic days 12-18, and of 4 rats embryos form embryonic days 17 and 20. In addition, we reconsidered the definition of the AP by comparing humans and rats with mice. In humans, the AP was continuous with the basisphenoid but was separated from the AT by a thick perichondrium. Then, the AP-AT connection had a key-and-keyhole structure. Unlike a joint, no cavitation developed in this connection. In mice, there was no boundary between the AT and the basisphenoid, indicating the absence of the AP in the mouse chondrocranium. In rats, the AP was, however, separated from the AT by a thick perichondrium. Therefore, the AP can be defined as follows: the AP is temporally separated from the AT by a thick perichondrium or a key-and-keyhole structure during the fetal period. This is the first study that confirms the absence of the alar process in the mice skull, and its presence in other mammals skull should be further investigated."

Fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) is a highly effective therapeutic modality for RCDI. While several studies have identified bacterial species associated with resolution of symptoms in patients, characterization of the fecal microbiome at the bacterial strain level in RCDI patients before and after FMT and healthy donors, has been lacking. The aim of this study was to examine the ability of bacterial strains from healthy donors to engraft in the gastrointestinal tract of patients with RCDI following FMT.Fecal samples were collected from 22 patients with RCDI before and after FMT and their corresponding healthy donors. Total DNA was extracted from each sample and analyzed by shotgun metagenomic sequencing. The Cosmos-ID analysis platform was used for taxonomic assignment of sequences and calculation of the relative abundance (RA) of bacterial species and strains. From these data, the total number of bacterial strains (BSI), Shannon diversity index, dysbiosis index (DI), and bacterial engraftment factor, were calculated for each strain.A marked reduction (p<0·0001) in the RA of total and specific bacterial strains, especially from phylum Firmicutes, was observed in RCDI patients prior to FMT. This change was associated with an increase in the DI (p<0·0001) and in pathobiont bacterial strains from phylum Proteobacteria, such as Escherichia coli O157:H7 and Klebsiella pneumoniae UCI 34. BSI was significantly lower in this group of patients as compared to healthy donors and correlated with the Shannon Index. (p<0·0001). Identification and engraftment of bacterial strains from healthy donors revealed a greater diversity and higher relative abundance of short-chain fatty acid (SCFA)-producing bacterial strains, including Lachnospiraceae bacterium 5_1_63FAA_u_t, Dorea formicigenerans ATCC 27755, Anaerostipes hadrusand others, in RCDI patients after FMT.These observations identify a group of SCFA-producing bacterial strains from healthy donors that engraft well in patients with RCDI following FMT and are associated with complete resolution of clinical symptoms and bacterial dysbiosis."

We developed a novel olfactory threshold test called Sniff Bubble using rose odor-containing beads made with 2-phenylethyl alcohol. We aimed to define cut-off scores for this tool to help identify cognitive decline among elderly people. In total, 162 elderly people (mean age ± SD: 73.04 ± 8.73 years) were administered olfactory threshold and neurocognitive tests. For analyses, we divided the participants into two groups based on cognitive functioning, namely cognitive decline (n = 44) and normal cognition (n = 118) groups. The Sniff Bubble and YSK olfactory function test for olfactory threshold and the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-5 Disorders-Clinician Version and Korean version of the Consortium to Establish a Registry for Alzheimer’s Disease assessment packet for neurocognitive functioning were used. We used K-means cluster analyses and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analyses to identify the most appropriate cut-off value. We established a positive correlation between the Sniff Bubble and neurocognitive function test scores ( r = 0.431, p &lt; 0.001). We defined the cut-off score, using the ROC curve analyses for Sniff Bubble scores, at 3 and higher with an area under the curve of 0.759 (p &lt; 0.001). The Sniff Bubble test can adequately detect cognitive decline in elderly people and may be used clinically as the first step in the screening process."
https://openalex.org/W3181462825,"The cardiac natriuretic peptides (NPs) are well established as regulators of blood pressure and fluid volume, but they also stimulate adipocyte lipolysis and control the gene program of nonshivering thermogenesis in brown adipose tissue. The NP ""clearance"" receptor C (NPRC) functions to clear NPs from the circulation via peptide internalization and degradation and thus is an important regulator of NP signaling and adipocyte metabolism. It is well known that the Nprc gene is highly expressed in adipose tissue and dynamically regulated upon nutrition and environmental changes. However, the molecular basis for how Nprc gene expression is regulated is still poorly understood. Here, we identified the nuclear receptor transcription factor peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARγ) as a transcriptional regulator of Nprc expression in mouse adipocytes. During 3T3-L1 adipocyte differentiation, levels of Nprc expression increase in parallel with PPARγ induction. Rosiglitazone, a classic PPARγ agonist, increases, whereas siRNA knockdown of PPARγ reduces, Nprc expression in 3T3-L1 adipocytes. By using chromosome conformation capture and luciferase reporter assays, we demonstrate that PPARγ controls Nprc gene expression in adipocytes through its long-range distal enhancers. Furthermore, the induction of Nprc expression in adipose tissue during high-fat diet feeding is found to be associated with increased PPARγ enhancer activity. Our findings define PPARγ as a mediator of adipocyte Nprc gene expression and establish a new connection between PPARγ and the control of adipocyte NP signaling in obesity."
https://openalex.org/W3182208410,"Indigenous Territories (ITs) with less centralized forest governance than Protected Areas (PAs) may represent cost-effective natural climate solutions to meet the Paris agreement. However, the literature has been limited to examining the effect of ITs on deforestation, despite the influence of anthropogenic degradation. Thus, little is known about the temporal and spatial effect of allocating ITs on carbon stocks dynamics that account for losses from deforestation and degradation. Using Amazon Basin countries and Panama, this study aims to estimate the temporal and spatial effects of ITs and PAs on carbon stocks. To estimate the temporal effects, we use annual carbon density maps, matching analysis, and linear mixed models. Furthermore, we explore the spatial heterogeneity of these estimates through geographic discontinuity designs, allowing us to assess the spatial effect of ITs and PAs boundaries on carbon stocks. The temporal effects highlight that allocating ITs preserves carbon stocks and buffer losses as well as allocating PAs in Panama and Amazon Basin countries. The geographic discontinuity designs reveal that ITs’ boundaries secure more extensive carbon stocks than their surroundings, and this difference tends to increase towards the least accessible areas, suggesting that indigenous land use in neotropical forests may have a temporarily and spatially stable impact on carbon stocks. Our findings imply that ITs in neotropical forests support Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) under the Paris Agreement. Thus, Indigenous peoples must become recipients of countries’ results-based payments."
https://openalex.org/W3178805352,"Interleukins (ILs) are cytokines with crucial functions in innate and adaptive immunity. IL genes are only found in vertebrates, except for IL-16, which has been cloned in some arthropod species. However, the function of this gene in invertebrates is unknown. In the present study, an IL-16-like gene (EsIL-16) was identified from the Chinese mitten crab Eriocheir sinensis. EsIL-16 was predicted to encode a precursor (proEsIL-16) that shares similarities with pro-IL-16 proteins from insects and vertebrates. We show that caspase-3 processes proEsIL-16 into an approximately 144-kDa N-terminal prodomain with nuclear import activity and an approximately 34-kDa mature peptide that might be secreted into the extracellular region. EsIL-16 mRNA could be detected in all analyzed tissues and was significantly upregulated after immune challenge both in vitro and in vivo. T7 phage display library screening suggested potential binding activity between EsIL-16 and integrin, which was confirmed by coimmunoprecipitation assay. Interestingly, EsIL-16 promoted cell proliferation via integrin β1 in primary cultured crab hemocytes and Drosophila S2 cells. Furthermore, the interaction between EsIL-16 and integrin β1 was necessary to efficiently protect the host from bacterial infection. To our knowledge, this study revealed integrin β1 as a receptor for IL-16 and the function of this interaction in hemocyte proliferation in invertebrates for the first time. These results provide new insights into the regulation of innate immune responses in invertebrates and shed the light on the evolution of ILs within the animal kingdom."

Design Case-control study nested in a primary cohort of patients aged 40 to 99 years, using the database BIFAP during the 2002–2015 study period. From this cohort, we identified incident cases of AMI and randomly selected five controls per case, matched by exact age, gender, and index date. Adjusted odds ratios (AOR) and 95% confidence interval (CI) were computed through a conditional logistic regression. Only new users of CS or glucosamine were considered. Results A total of 23,585 incident cases of AMI and 117,405 controls were included. Of them, 89 cases (0.38%) and 757 controls (0.64%) were current users of CS at index date, yielding an AOR of 0.57 (95%CI: 0.46–0.72). The reduced risk among current users was observed in both short-term (&lt;365 days, AOR = 0.58; 95%CI: 0.45–0.75) and long-term users (&gt;364 days AOR = 0.56; 95%CI:0.36–0.87), in both sexes (men, AOR = 0.52; 95%CI:0.38–0.70; women, AOR = 0.65; 95%CI:0.46–0.91), in individuals over or under 70 years of age (AOR = 0.54; 95%CI:0.38–0.77, and AOR = 0.61; 95%CI:0.45–0.82, respectively) and in individuals at intermediate (AOR = 0.65; 95%CI:0.48–0.91) and high cardiovascular risk (AOR = 0.48; 95%CI:0.27–0.83), but not in those at low risk (AOR = 1.11; 95%CI:0.48–2.56). In contrast, the current use of glucosamine was not associated with either increased or decreased risk of AMI (AOR = 0.86; 95%CI:0.66–1.08). Conclusions Our results support a cardioprotective effect of CS, while glucosamine seems to be neutral. The protection was remarkable among subgroups at high cardiovascular risk."
https://openalex.org/W3180193659,"Purpose To evaluate the association between symptoms and signs of dry eye diseases (DED) with corneal biomechanical parameters. Methods This cross-sectional study enrolled 81 participants without history of ocular hypertension, glaucoma, keratoconus, corneal edema, contact lens use, diabetes, and ocular surgery. All participants were evaluated for symptoms and signs of DED using OSDI questionnaire, tear film break-up time (TBUT), conjunctival and corneal staining (NEI grading) and Schirmer test. Corneal biomechanical parameters were obtained using Corvis ST. Mixed-effects linear regression analysis was used to determine the association between symptoms and signs of DED with corneal biomechanical parameters. Difference in corneal biomechanical parameter between participants with low (Schirmer value ≤10 mm; LT group) and normal (Schirmer value &gt;10mm; NT group) tear production was analyzed using ANCOVA test. Results The median OSDI scores, TBUT, conjunctival and corneal staining scores as well as Schirmer test were 13±16.5 (range; 0–77), 5.3±4.2 seconds (range; 1.3–11), 0±1 (range; 0–4), 0±2 (ranges; 0–9) and 16±14 mm (range; 0–45) respectively. Regression analysis adjusted with participants’ refraction, intraocular pressure, and central corneal thickness showed that OSDI had a negative association with highest concavity radius (P = 0.02). The association between DED signs and corneal biomechanical parameters were found between conjunctival staining scores with second applanation velocity (A2V, P = 0.04), corneal staining scores with second applanation length (A2L, P = 0.01), Schirmer test with first applanation time (A1T, P = 0.04) and first applanation velocity (P = 0.01). In subgroup analysis, there was no difference in corneal biomechanical parameters between participants with low and normal tear production (P&gt;0.05). The associations were found between OSDI with time to highest concavity (P&lt;0.01) and highest displacement of corneal apex (HC-DA, P = 0.04), conjunctival staining scores with A2L (P = 0.01) and A2V (P&lt;0.01) in LT group, and Schirmer test with A1T (P = 0.02) and HC-DA (P = 0.03), corneal staining scores with A2L (P&lt;0.01) in NT group. Conclusions According to in vivo observation with Corvis ST, patients with DED showed more compliant corneas. The increase in dry eye severity was associated with the worsening of corneal biomechanics in both patients with low and normal tear production."
https://openalex.org/W3180346072,"Influenza and RSV are human viruses responsible for outbreaks in hospitals, long-term care facilities and nursing homes. The present study assessed an air treatment using ozone at two relative humidity conditions (RHs) in order to reduce the infectivity of airborne influenza. Bovine pulmonary surfactant (BPS) and synthetic tracheal mucus (STM) were used as aerosols protectants to better reflect the human aerosol composition. Residual ozone concentration inside the aerosol chamber was also measured. RSV's sensitivity resulted in testing its resistance to aerosolization and sampling processes instead of ozone exposure. The results showed that without supplement and with STM, a reduction in influenza A infectivity of four orders of magnitude was obtained with an exposure to 1.70 ± 0.19 ppm of ozone at 76% RH for 80 min. Consequently, ozone could be considered as a virucidal disinfectant for airborne influenza A. RSV did not withstand the aerosolization and sampling processes required for the use of the experimental setup. Therefore, ozone exposure could not be performed for this virus. Nonetheless, this study provides great insight for the efficacy of ozone as an air treatment for the control of nosocomial influenza A outbreaks."
https://openalex.org/W3177660183,"Cancer metastasis causes >90% of cancer deaths and remains a major treatment challenge. Here we deciphered the impact of tyrosine phosphorylation of MACC1, a causative driver for cancer metastasis, for cancer cell signaling and novel interventions to restrict cancer metastasis. We identified MACC1 as new MEK1 substrate. MEK1 directly phosphorylates MACC1, leading to accelerated and increased ERK1 activation. Mutating in silico predicted hierarchical MACC1 tyrosine phosphorylation sites abrogates MACC1-induced migration, invasion, and MET expression, a transcriptional MACC1 target. Targeting MEK1 by RNAi or clinically applicable MEK1 inhibitors AZD6244 and GSK1120212 reduces MACC1 tyrosine phosphorylation and restricts MACC1-induced metastasis formation in mice. Although MEK1 levels, contrary to MACC1, are not of prognostic relevance for CRC patients, MEK1 expression was found indispensable for MACC1-induced metastasis. This study identifies MACC1 as new MEK1 substrate for tyrosine phosphorylation decisively impacting cell motility, tumor growth, and metastasis. Thus, MAP kinase signaling is not linear leading to ERK activation, but branches at the level of MEK1. This fundamental finding opens new therapeutic options for targeting the MEK1/MACC1 axis as novel vulnerability in patients at high risk for metastasis. This might be extended from CRC to further solid tumor entities."
https://openalex.org/W3177895800,"The heavy metal Cadmium (Cd), a widespread environmental contaminant, poses serious hazards to human health and is considered a metallohormone and carcinogen. In women with uterine fibroids, there is a significant association between blood Cd levels and increased fibroid tumor size. The aim of this study was to determine if benign human uterine leiomyoma (fibroid) cells could be malignantly transformed in vitro by continuous Cd exposure and, if so, explore a molecular mechanism by which this could occur. We found when fibroid cells were exposed to 10 µM CdCl2 for 8 weeks, a robust and fast-growing Cd-Resistant Leiomyoma (CR-LM) cell culture was established. The CR-LM cells formed viable colonies in soft agar and had increased cytoplasmic glycogen aggregates, enhanced cell motility, a higher percentage of cells in G2/M phase, and increased expression of the proliferation marker Ki-67. NanoString analysis showed downregulation of genes encoding for extracellular matrix (ECM) components, such as collagens, fibronectins, laminins, and SLRP family proteins, whereas genes involved in ECM degradation (MMP1, MMP3, and MMP10) were significantly upregulated. A volcano plot showed that the top differentially genes favored cancer progression. Functional analysis by ingenuity pathway analysis predicted a significant inhibition of TGFB1 signaling, leading to enhanced proliferation and attenuated fibrosis. Prolonged Cd exposure altered phenotypic characteristics and dysregulated genes in fibroid cells predicative of progression towards a cancer phenotype. Therefore, continuous Cd exposure alters the benign characteristics of fibroid cells in vitro, and Cd exposure could possibly pose a health hazard for women with uterine fibroids."
https://openalex.org/W3182572740,"The size of the permeability transition pore (PTP) is accepted to be ≤1.5 kDa. However, different authors reported values from 650 to 4000 Da. The present study is focused on the variability of the average PTP size in and between mitochondrial samples, its reasons and relations with PTP dynamics. Measurement of PTP size by the standard method revealed its 500 Da-range variability between mitochondrial samples. Sequential measurements in the same sample showed that the PTP size tends to grow with time and Ca2+ concentration. Selective damage to the mitochondrial outer membrane (MOM) reduced the apparent PTP size by ~200-300 Da. Hypotonic and hypertonic osmotic shock and partial removal of the MOM with the preservation of the mitochondrial inner membrane intactness decreased the apparent PTP size by ~50%. We developed an approach to continuous monitoring of the PTP size that revealed the existence of stable PTP states with different pore sizes (~700, 900-1000, ~1350, 1700-1800, and 2100-2200 Da) and transitions between them. The transitions were accelerated by elevating the Ca2+ concentration, temperature, and osmotic pressure, which demonstrates an increased capability of PTP to accommodate to large molecules (plasticity). Cyclosporin A inhibited the transitions between states. The analysis of PTP size dynamics in osmotically shocked mitochondria and mitoplasts confirmed the importance of the MOM for the stabilization of PTP structure. Thus, this approach provides a new tool for PTP studies and the opportunity to reconcile data on the PTP size and mitochondrial megachannel conductance."
https://openalex.org/W3182676955,"Uremic cardiomyopathy is a common complication in chronic kidney disease (CKD) patients, accounting for a high mortality rate. Several mechanisms have been proposed to link CKD and cardiac alterations; however, the early cardiac modifications that occur in CKD that may trigger cardiac remodeling and dysfunction remain largely unexplored. Here, in a mouse model of CKD induced by 5/6 nephrectomy, we first analyzed the early transcriptional and inflammatory changes that occur in the heart. Five days after 5/6 nephrectomy, RNA-sequencing showed the upregulation of 54 genes in the cardiac tissue of CKD mice and the enrichment of biological processes related to immune system processes. Increased cardiac infiltration of T-CD4+ lymphocytes, myeloid cells, and macrophages during early CKD was observed. Next, since CC chemokine ligand-8 (CCL8) was one of the most upregulated genes in the heart of mice with early CKD, we investigated the effect of acute and transient CCL8 inhibition on uremic cardiomyopathy severity. An increase in CCL8 protein levels was confirmed in the heart of early CKD mice. CCL8 inhibition attenuated the early infiltration of T-CD4+ lymphocytes and macrophages to the cardiac tissue, leading to a protection against chronic cardiac fibrotic remodeling, inflammation and cardiac dysfunction induced by CKD. Altogether, our data show the occurrence of transcriptional and inflammatory changes in the heart during the early phases of CKD and identify CCL8 as a key contributor to the early cardiac inflammatory state that triggers further cardiac remodeling and dysfunction in uremic cardiomyopathy."

Elucidation of host genetic influences of M. ovipneumoniae nasal detection has the potential to reduce the incidence of polymicrobial pneumonia in sheep through implementation of selective breeding strategies. Nasal mucosal secretions were collected from 647 sheep from a large US sheep flock. Ewes of three breeds (Polypay n = 222, Rambouillet n = 321, and Suffolk n = 104) ranging in age from one to seven years, were sampled at three different times in the production cycle (February, April, and September/October) over four years (2015 to 2018). The presence and DNA copy number of M. ovipneumoniae was determined using a newly developed species-specific qPCR. Breed (P<0.001), age (P<0.024), sampling time (P<0.001), and year (P<0.001) of collection affected log10 transformed M. ovipneumoniae DNA copy number, where Rambouillet had the lowest (P<0.0001) compared with both Polypay and Suffolk demonstrating a possible genetic component to detection. Samples from yearlings, April, and 2018 had the highest (P<0.046) detected DNA copy number mean. Sheep genomic DNA was genotyped with the Illumina OvineHD BeadChip. Principal component analysis identified most of the variation in the dataset was associated with breed. Therefore, genome wide association analysis was conducted with a mixed model (EMMAX), with principal components 1 to 6 as fixed and a kinship matrix as random effects. Genome-wide significant (P<9x10-8) SNPs were identified on chromosomes 6 and 7 in the all-breed analysis. Individual breed analysis had genome-wide significant (P<9x10-8) SNPs on chromosomes 3, 4, 7, 9, 10, 15, 17, and 22. Annotated genes near these SNPs are part of immune (ANAPC7, CUL5, TMEM229B, PTPN13), gene translation (PIWIL4), and chromatin organization (KDM2B) pathways. Immune genes are expected to have increased expression when leukocytes encounter M. ovipneumoniae which would lead to chromatin reorganization. Work is underway to narrow the range of these associated regions to identify the underlying causal mutations."

Pigment epithelium-derived factor (PEDF) plus docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) regenerated damaged nerves by stimulating the synthesis of a new stereoisomer of Resolvin D6 (RvD6si). Here, we resolved the structure of this lipid isolated from mouse tears after injured corneas were treated with PEDF + DHA. RvD6si synthesis was inhibited by fluvoxamine, a cytochrome P450 inhibitor, but not by 15- or 5-LOX inhibitors, suggesting that the 4- and 17-hydroxy of DHA have an RR- or SR-configuration. The two compounds were chemically synthesized. Using chiral phase HPLC, four peaks of RvD6si1-4 from tears were resolved. The RR-RvD6 standard eluted as a single peak with RvD61 while pure SR-RvD6 eluted with RvD63. The addition of these pure mediators prompted a trigeminal ganglion transcriptome response in injured corneas and showed that RR-RvD6 was the more potent, increasing cornea sensitivity and nerve regeneration. RR-RvD6 stimulates Rictor and hepatocyte growth factor (hgf) genes specifically as upstream regulators and a gene network involved in axon growth and suppression of neuropathic pain, indicating a novel function of this lipid mediator to maintain cornea integrity and homeostasis after injury."

In this study, we propose to study underlying factors of COVID-19 trial completion vs . cessation, and design predictive models to accurately predict whether a COVID-19 trial may complete or cease in the future. We collect 4,441 COVID-19 trials from ClinicalTrial.gov to build a testbed, and design four types of features to characterize clinical trial administration, eligibility, study information, criteria, drug types, study keywords, as well as embedding features commonly used in the state-of-the-art machine learning. Our study shows that drug features and study keywords are most informative features, but all four types of features are essential for accurate trial prediction. By using predictive models, our approach achieves more than 0.87 AUC (Area Under the Curve) score and 0.81 balanced accuracy to correctly predict COVID-19 clinical trial completion vs . cessation. Our research shows that computational methods can deliver effective features to understand difference between completed vs . ceased COVID-19 trials. In addition, such models can also predict COVID-19 trial status with satisfactory accuracy, and help stakeholders better plan trials and minimize costs."

https://openalex.org/W3178786961,"Insulators are cis-regulatory elements that block enhancer activity and prevent heterochromatin spreading. The binding of CCCTC-binding factor (CTCF) protein is essential for insulators to play the roles in a chromatin context. The β-globin locus, consisting of multiple genes and enhancers, is flanked by two insulators 3′HS1 and HS5. However, it has been reported that the absence of these insulators did not affect the β-globin transcription. To explain the unexpected finding, we have deleted a CTCF motif at 3′HS1 or HS5 in the human β-globin locus and analyzed chromatin interactions around the locus. It was found that a topologically associating domain (TAD) containing the β-globin locus is maintained by neighboring CTCF sites in the CTCF motif-deleted loci. The additional deletions of neighboring CTCF motifs disrupted the β-globin TAD, resulting in decrease of the β-globin transcription. Chromatin interactions of the β-globin enhancers with gene promoter were weakened in the multiple CTCF motifs-deleted loci, even though the enhancers have still active chromatin features such as histone H3K27ac and histone H3 depletion. Genome-wide analysis using public CTCF ChIA-PET and ChIP-seq data showed that chromatin domains possessing multiple CTCF binding sites tend to contain super-enhancers like the β-globin enhancers. Taken together, our results show that multiple CTCF sites surrounding the β-globin locus cooperate with each other to maintain a TAD. The β-globin TAD appears to provide a compact spatial environment that enables enhancers to interact with promoter."
https://openalex.org/W3180182317,"Life-style change and anti-inflammatory interventions have only transient effects in obesity. It is not clear how benefits obtained by these treatments can be maintained longer term, especially during sustained high caloric intake. Constitutive ablation of the activin receptor ALK7 in adipose tissue enhances catecholamine signaling and lipolysis in adipocytes, and protects mice from diet-induced obesity. Here, we investigated the consequences of conditional ALK7 ablation in adipocytes of adult mice with pre-existing obesity. Although ALK7 deletion had little effect on its own, it synergized strongly with a transient switch to low-fat diet (life-style change) or anti-inflammatory treatment (Na-salicylate), resulting in enhanced lipolysis, increased energy expenditure, and reduced adipose tissue mass and body weight gain, even under sustained high caloric intake. By themselves, diet-switch and salicylate had only a temporary effect on weight gain. Mechanistically, combination of ALK7 ablation with either treatment strongly enhanced the levels of β3-AR, the main adrenergic receptor for catecholamine stimulation of lipolysis, and C/EBPα, an upstream regulator of β3-AR expression. These results suggest that inhibition of ALK7 can be combined with simple interventions to produce longer-lasting benefits in obesity."
https://openalex.org/W3180313720,"Translocations are globally a popular tool used with the intention of improving threatened species conservation and re-establishing ecosystem function. While practitioners strive for successful outcomes the failure rate of translocations continues to be high. We demonstrate how predictive modelling can contribute to more informed decision making and hence potentially improve the success rate of translocation programs. Two species, the Djoongari (Shark Bay mouse) Pseudomys fieldi and the golden bandicoot Isoodon auratus barrowensis , were introduced independently to Doole Island in the Exmouth Gulf of Western Australia. We used population viability analysis to critique the outcomes of these translocations and provide an example of how this tool can be incorporated with expert knowledge to predict likely outcomes of translocations. Djoongari did not establish on the island after seven translocations over nine years, while golden bandicoots established a population after just one release event. Retrospective population viability analysis (of data that was unavailable prior to the translocations) predicted and clarified the reasons behind the outcomes of both translocations. Golden bandicoots have considerably higher demographic plasticity than Djoongari, which were never likely to establish on the island. We conclude that the failure of the Djoongari translocation was due to interactions between sparse habitat, native predators and cyclonic storm surges, whereas golden bandicoots have demonstrated habitat flexibility and an ability to recover from multiple natural disasters. As a result we (1) remind conservation planners of the importance of quantifying likely refuges and habitat availability at release sites, (2) suggest practitioners consider how different threats (including natural disasters) may interact at potential release sites and (3) advocate for the incorporation of predictive modelling during the planning stages of translocations, particularly for conservation introductions where no precedent exists for the species’ survival at a particular location."
https://openalex.org/W3180676825,"Objective Two randomized controlled experiments investigated if writing a narrative text about a fictional person who shows disapproved of behavior in the Covid-19 pandemic influenced empathy, perspective-taking, attitude, and attribution of causes regarding that person’s behavior. Methods In both studies, a fictional scenario was described, and participants answered questions regarding empathy, perspective-taking, attitude, and attribution regarding a fictional person’s disapproved of behavior (pre-post-measurement). Participants were randomly assigned to one of two conditions. In the experimental condition, they wrote a narrative text about the fictional person. In the control condition, they wrote about an unrelated topic. Results We found that writing a narrative text increased empathy more strongly than writing about an unrelated topic; Study 1: p = 0.004, part. η 2 = 0.06, Study 2: p &lt; .001, part. η 2 = 0.19. This did not apply to perspective-taking; Study 1: p = 0.415; Study 2: p = 0.074. We also found that writing a narrative text about a fictional person resulted in a more positive attitude toward this person; Study 1: p = 0.005, part. η 2 = 0.06; Study 2: p&lt;0.001, part. η 2 = 0.10. Finally, in Study 2 we found that participants who wrote a narrative text attributed the person’s behavior to internal causes to a lesser degree; p = 0.007, part. η 2 = 0.05. Conclusion Our findings indicate that empathy and attitude are positively modifiable through narrative writing tasks. Empathy training could potentially prevent discrimination related to Covid-19.

https://openalex.org/W3178027921,"In cost-effectiveness analyses, the future costs, disutility and mortality from alternative causes of morbidity are often not completely taken into account. We explored the impact of different assumed values for each of these factors on the cost-effectiveness of screening for colorectal cancer (CRC) and esophageal adenocarcinoma (EAC).Twenty different CRC screening strategies and two EAC screening strategies were evaluated using microsimulation. Average health-related expenses, disutility and mortality by age for the U.S. general population were estimated using surveys and lifetables. First, we evaluated strategies under default assumptions, with average mortality, and no accounting for health-related costs and disutility. Then, we varied costs, disutility and mortality between 100% and 150% of the estimated population averages, with 125% as the best estimate. Primary outcome was the incremental cost per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gained among efficient strategies.The set of efficient strategies was robust to assumptions on future costs, disutility and mortality from other causes of morbidity. However, the incremental cost per QALY gained increased with higher assumed values. For example, for CRC, the ratio for the recommended strategy increased from $15,600 with default assumptions, to $32,600 with average assumption levels, $61,100 with 25% increased levels, and $111,100 with 50% increased levels. Similarly, for EAC, the incremental costs per QALY gained for the recommended EAC screening strategy increased from $106,300 with default assumptions to $198,300 with 50% increased assumptions. In sensitivity analyses without discounting or including only above-average expenses, the impact of assumptions was relatively smaller, but best estimates of the cost per QALY gained remained substantially higher than default estimates.Assumptions on future costs, utility and mortality from other causes of morbidity substantially impact cost-effectiveness outcomes of cancer screening. More empiric evidence and consensus are needed to guide assumptions in future analyses."
https://openalex.org/W3179148101,"Breast cancer is the cancer with the highest incidence of malignant tumors in women, which seriously endangers women's health. With the help of computer vision technology, it has important application value to automatically classify pathological tissue images to assist doctors in rapid and accurate diagnosis. Breast pathological tissue images have complex and diverse characteristics, and the medical data set of breast pathological tissue images is small, which makes it difficult to automatically classify breast pathological tissues. In recent years, most of the researches have focused on the simple binary classification of benign and malignant, which cannot meet the actual needs for classification of pathological tissues. Therefore, based on deep convolutional neural network, model ensembleing, transfer learning, feature fusion technology, this paper designs an eight-class classification breast pathology diagnosis model BCDnet. A user inputs the patient's breast pathological tissue image, and the model can automatically determine what the disease is (Adenosis, Fibroadenoma, Tubular Adenoma, Phyllodes Tumor, Ductal Carcinoma, Lobular Carcinoma, Mucinous Carcinoma or Papillary Carcinoma). The model uses the VGG16 convolution base and Resnet50 convolution base as the parallel convolution base of the model. Two convolutional bases (VGG16 convolutional base and Resnet50 convolutional base) obtain breast tissue image features from different fields of view. After the information output by the fully connected layer of the two convolutional bases is fused, it is classified and output by the SoftMax function. The model experiment uses the publicly available BreaKHis data set. The number of samples of each class in the data set is extremely unevenly distributed. Compared with the binary classification, the number of samples in each class of the eight-class classification is also smaller. Therefore, the image segmentation method is used to expand the data set and the non-repeated random cropping method is used to balance the data set. Based on the balanced data set and the unbalanced data set, the BCDnet model, the pre-trained model Resnet50+ fine-tuning, and the pre-trained model VGG16+ fine-tuning are used for multiple comparison experiments. In the comparison experiment, the BCDnet model performed outstandingly, and the correct recognition rate of the eight-class classification model is higher than 98%. The results show that the model proposed in this paper and the method of improving the data set are reasonable and effective."

In particular, we aim to explore the impact on the participation in cultural activities of first-generation non-European Union (EU) and non-European Economic Area (EEA) migrants, such as attendance to cinema, concerts and theatre. The second aim is to examine the impact of cultural activities on subjective well-being (SWB), measured by life satisfaction. We compare the cultural participation and life satisfaction between the treatment group that is the non-EU/EEA first-generation immigrants and the control group that consists, not only of natives and second-generation immigrants but also composes of EU/EEA first-generation immigrants who are not eligible to the programme. We will apply a sharp and a fuzzy regression discontinuity design (RDD) within a seemingly unrelated regression equations (SURE) system using the Ordered Probit method. The empirical analysis relies on data from the German Socio-Economic Panel (GSOEP) survey over the period 2015–2018. The results show that the treated subjects experience an increase in cultural participation activities and an improvement in their SWB, as a result of the EU Blue Card programme, compared to the control group. Participation in classical music performance, opera or theatre influences more the SWB compared to other cultural activities. Policies that promote labour market integration and participation in cultural activities will enable immigrants to integrate into the social norms of the host societies and improve their SWB."

All fourteen chimeric parasites produced sporozoites but sporozoites of eight lines failed to establish a liver infection, indicating a negative impact of these P . falciparum proteins on sporozoite infectivity.

Protective immunogenicity was determined by analyzing parasite liver load and prepatent period of blood stage infection after challenge. Of the six proteins only SPELD immunized mice showed partial protection. We discuss both the low protective immunogenicity of these proteins in the chimeric rodent malaria challenge model and the negative effect on P . berghei sporozoite infectivity of several P . falciparum proteins expressed in the chimeric sporozoites."
https://openalex.org/W3181068302,"After birth, the alveolar epithelium is exposed to environmental pathogens and high O2 tensions. The alveolar type II cells may protect this epithelium through surfactant production. Surfactant protein, SP-A, an immune modulator, is developmentally upregulated in fetal lung with surfactant phospholipid synthesis. Herein, we observed that the redox-regulated transcription factor, NRF2, and co-regulated C/EBPβ and PPARγ, were markedly induced during cAMP-mediated differentiation of cultured human fetal lung (HFL) epithelial cells. This occurred with enhanced expression of immune modulators, SP-A, TDO2, AhR, and NQO1. Like SP-A, cAMP induction of NRF2 was prevented when cells were exposed to hypoxia. NRF2 knockdown inhibited induction of C/EBPβ, PPARγ, and immune modulators. Binding of endogenous NRF2 to promoters of SP-A and other immune modulator genes increased during HFL cell differentiation. In mouse fetal lung (MFL), a developmental increase in Nrf2, SP-A, Tdo2, Ahr, and Nqo1 and decrease in Keap1 occurred from 14.5 to 18.5 dpc. Developmental induction of Nrf2 in MFL was associated with increased nuclear localization of NF-κB p65, a decline in p38 MAPK phosphorylation, increase in the MAPK phosphatase, DUSP1, induction of the histone acetylase, CBP, and decline in the histone deacetylase, HDAC4. Thus, together with surfactant production, type II cells protect the alveolar epithelium through increased expression of NRF2 and immune modulators to prevent inflammation and oxidative stress. Our findings further suggest that lung cancer cells have usurped this developmental pathway to promote immune tolerance and enhance survival."
https://openalex.org/W3179752739,"The neuron-specific tyrosine phosphatase striatal-enriched phosphatase (STEP) is emerging as a key regulator of excitotoxicity, which is involved in the pathogenesis of both acute and chronic neurological diseases. However, the intracellular mechanisms that are regulated by STEP to confer neuroprotection against excitotoxic insults are not well understood. The present study investigates the role of STEP in regulating neuronal release of the proinflammatory prostanoid prostaglandin E2 (PGE2), which is associated with a wide range of pathological conditions. The findings show that glutamate-mediated activation of the N-methyl-D-aspartic acid receptor in STEP-deficient neurons leads to rapid and sustained increase in the phosphorylation of p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (p38 MAPK), a signaling molecule involved in the production of inflammatory mediators. Such sustained p38 MAPK activation increases the activity of cytosolic phospholipase A2, which catalyzes the release of arachidonic acid, the initial substrate for PGE2 biosynthesis. Sustained p38 MAPK activation also induces nuclear factor-κB-mediated increase in expression of cyclooxygenase-2 that is involved in the conversion of arachidonic acid to prostanoids, resulting in enhanced biosynthesis and release of PGE2 from neurons. Restoration of STEP function with a STEP mimetic (TAT-STEP-myc peptide) significantly decreases the activation of p38 MAPK-mediated cytosolic phospholipase A2/cyclooxygenase-2/PGE2 signaling cascade. This study identifies an important mechanism involved in the neuronal release of the proinflammatory mediator PGE2 after excitotoxic insult and highlights for the first time the immunomodulatory ability of a neuronal tyrosine phosphatase."
https://openalex.org/W3181203753,"The synaptic expression of glutamate receptors of the α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methylisoxazole-4-propionic acid (AMPA) type is dynamically controlled by interaction with binding partners and auxiliary proteins. These proteins can be regulated by posttranslational modifications, including ubiquitination. In this work, we investigated the regulation of glutamate receptor interacting protein-associated protein 1 (GRASP1) by ubiquitin-dependent mechanisms and its impact on surface expression and activity of synaptic AMPA receptors. Cotransfection of GFP-ubiquitin decreased myc-GRASP1 protein levels in HEK293T cells, and this effect was inhibited upon transfection of an ubiquitin mutant that cannot be ubiquitinated on Lys48. In addition, transfection of cultured hippocampal neurons with GFP-ubiquitin reduced the dendritic levels of endogenous GRASP1 and decreased the surface expression of GluA1 AMPA receptor subunits, an effect that was partly reversed by cotransfection with GRASP1. Similarly, transfection of hippocampal neurons with GFP-ubiquitin decreased the amplitude of miniature excitatory postsynaptic currents (mEPSCs) mediated by Ca2+-impermeable AMPA receptors, and this effect was abrogated by cotransfection of GRASP1. Together, the results show a role for ubiquitination in the regulation of the postsynaptic protein GRASP1, which has an impact on the surface distribution of AMPA receptors and on their activity at the synapse."

The arterial wall is known to stiffen with age, although the underlying age-related histological and biomechanical changes remain unclear. The purpose of this study was to investigate the effect of aging by histological analysis of the arterial wall and examination of the arterial wall biomechanical properties using an inflation-extension test. Entire circular samples of the proximal and distal aorta, cranial and caudal common carotid, external iliac, femoral and median artery were collected from 6 young (6 years) and 14 old horses (≥15 years). Samples of all arteries were histologically examined and intima media thickness as well as area % of elastin, smooth muscle actin and collagen type I and III were determined. Older horses had a significantly larger intima media thickness and a significantly higher area % of smooth muscle actin compared to young horses. Samples of the proximal and distal aorta, the caudal common carotid and the external iliac artery were mechanically assessed using an in-house developed inflation-extension device with ultrasound analysis. Rupture occurred in a minority of arteries (8/78) at high pressures (between 250-300 mmHg), and mostly occurred in older horses (7/8). Pressure-area, pressure-compliance and pressure-distensibility curves were constructed. A significant difference in the pressure-area curves of the distal aorta, common carotid artery and external iliac artery, the pressure-compliance curves of the proximal aorta and carotid artery and the pressure-distensibility curve of the proximal aorta was observed between young and old horses. Results demonstrate an effect of age on the histological and biomechanical properties of the arterial wall, which might explain why arterial rupture occurs more often in older horses."

The purpose of this study was to evaluate a quantitative model for lens-status-monitoring after PPV with C3F8 gas. Our model was evaluated in rhegmatogenous retinal detachment (RRD) patients of various age and lens densitometry (LD). Methods Data between March 2018 and March 2020 were evaluated retrospectively. LD measurements of the PentacamHR® Nucleus Staging mode (PNS) were used to quantify lens opacification over time. A mixed-effect regression model was designed, to enable LD predictions at any time postoperatively. Calculations were based on patient’s age and baseline LD as dependent variables. Six patients were randomly excluded during model development, to be used for testing its power afterwards. Results 34 patients (male 19 [55.9%], female 15 [44.1%]) matched the inclusion criteria. Average age was 58.5 years (32–77;±4.3) and average follow-up was 7.2 months (3,4–23.1;±1,8). Mean baseline LD of the treated and fellow eye before surgery were 10.9% (8.7%-14.8%;±0.8) and 10.7% (8.5%-14.1%;±0.6), respectively. Using our prediction model, LD values for the six pre-selected patients closely match the observed data with an average deviation of 1.07%. Conclusions Evaluation of age and baseline LD using a mixed-effect regression model might predict cataract progression in RRD patients treated with PPV and C3F8-gas. Such a tool could be considered during cataract surgery consultation in these patients."
https://openalex.org/W3182855975,"Persons living with HIV (PLWH) receiving tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF)-based antiretroviral therapy (ART) risk suffering TDF-associated nephrotoxicity (TDFAN). TDFAN can result in short- and long-term morbidity, including permanent loss of kidney function, chronic kidney disease (CKD), and end-stage kidney disease (ESKD) requiring dialysis. Currently, there is no model to predict this risk or discern which patients to initiate TDF-based therapy. Consequently, some patients suffer TDFAN within the first few months of initiating therapy before switching to another suitable antiretroviral or a lower dose of TDF. In a prospective observational cohort study of adult Zambian PLWH, we modelled the risk for TDFAN before initiating therapy to identify individuals at high risk for experiencing AKI after initiating TDF-based therapy. We enrolled 205 HIV-positive, ART-naïve adults initiating TDF-based therapy followed for a median of 3.4 months for TDFAN at the Adult Infectious Disease Research Centre (AIDC) in Lusaka, Zambia. We defined TDFAN as meeting any of these acute kidney disease (AKD) criteria: 1) An episode of estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR)&lt; 60ml/ min/1.73m 2 within 3 months, 2) reduced eGFR by&gt; 35% within 3 months or 3) increased serum creatinine by&gt; 50% within 3 months. A total of 45 participants (22%) developed acute kidney disease (AKD) after TDF-based therapy. The development of AKD within the first 3 months of commencing TDF-based therapy was associated with an increase in baseline serum creatinine, age, baseline eGFR and female sex. We concluded that baseline characteristics and baseline renal function biomarkers predicted the risk for AKD within the first 3-months of TDF-based therapy."

It was a moment I'd been dreading for months. I'd been hired as an undergraduate field assistant to do geology work in an area with healthy populations of bears and cougars. I went into the summer not wanting to be alone in the field, fearing I'd encounter a potentially deadly animal. But bears and cougars turned out to be the least of my problems. I spent 6 weeks working alongside a male colleague who constantly belittled my abilities, leaving me mentally exhausted and questioning whether I belonged in the field. My encounter with the bear, in contrast, turned out to be empowering.



> “I realized that if a wild animal feared me, I wasn't powerless after all.” 

I grew up in the Rocky Mountains of Colorado and spent much of my childhood hiking, skiing, and otherwise exploring outdoors. I was fascinated by the mountains, streams, and canyons, so I decided to study geology at college. I loved my program and was excited when I had the opportunity to participate in summer field research. One summer, I spent nearly 3 months hiking every day and living in a rustic cabin. It was a great experience. My other summer in the field, however, was not.

I was hired to work alongside my supervisor and one other undergraduate field assistant. Before we went into the field, I overheard the student telling others I was a slow hiker and that he hoped I wouldn't show up. It wasn't the first time he had disparaged my physical or intellectual abilities. Our supervisor didn't know our history before hiring us for the project. I desperately wanted to tell him about it, but I needed the research experience and I did not want him to second-guess hiring me.

Once we were in the field, the other student never missed an opportunity to play the game of one-upmanship. He argued with me constantly. No matter what I said, he voiced an opposite position. The more it happened, the quieter I became. After a few weeks of misery, I could see that my supervisor was starting to have doubts about me, mistaking my silence for incompetence. Sensing his disappointment in me, I began to believe I wasn't cut out to be a scientist.

Although I felt deeply uncomfortable with our team dynamics, I didn't want to work alone. We were in a remote area with rugged terrain, and I worried one of us might get injured and need help. I was also uneasy about encountering the locals alone. One man we had crossed paths with earlier in the summer had muttered something about seeing a woman and joked that he thought my rock hammer was a weapon.

But when our supervisor left a few weeks early, the other student suggested we split up to cover more ground. I protested, telling him I was uncomfortable working alone. But he countered that I was paranoid. I felt I had no choice but to agree.

A week later, I spotted the bear. At first I was terrified. But when it quickly ran away, simply because I was standing there, my feelings started to change. I realized that if a wild animal feared me, I wasn't powerless after all. I went back to camp with the confidence I needed to stand up to the real threat I faced that summer: the other student.

That evening, after he criticized the way I was setting up the camp table for dinner, I threw the table legs down and told him how disgusted I was with how he'd treated me. He didn't apologize, but I felt better after getting it off my chest. I realized that in the future I need to address problems head-on rather than internalizing them and letting them affect my self-confidence.

I am now in grad school, thanks in part to a supportive female mentor. I haven't faced any other dangerous beasts, but I assume I will someday. And the next time I do confront a bear, cougar, or menacing colleague, I won't turn around and run."
