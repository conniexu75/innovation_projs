https://openalex.org/W2069247693,"Water-quality records from two nationwide sampling networks now permit nationally consistent analysis of long-term water-quality trends at more than 300 locations on major U.S. rivers. Observed trends in 24 measures of water quality for the period from 1974 to 1981 provide new insight into changes in stream quality that occurred during a time of major changes in both terrestrial and atmospheric influences on surface waters. Particularly noteworthy are widespread decreases in fecal bacteria and lead concentrations and widespread increases in nitrate, chloride, arsenic, and cadmium concentrations. Recorded increases in municipal waste treatment, use of salt on highways, and nitrogen fertilizer application, along with decreases in leaded gasoline consumption and regionally variable trends in coal production and combustion during the period appear to be reflected in water-quality changes."

The differentiation signal was found to be a simple ridge on the substrate surface that had a markedly optimum height of 0.5 micrometer. Such ridges were microfabricated on silicon wafers by using electron-beam lithography. A similar ridge, in the form of a stomatal lip, was found associated with the stomatal guard cells of the bean (Phaseolus vulgaris) leaf. Ridge elevations greater than 1.0 micrometer or less than 0.25 micrometer did not serve as effective signals. Germ tubes of the fungus were highly oriented by ridge spacings of 0.5 to 6.7 micrometers. The data indicate that the fungus is able to distinguish uniquely minute differences in leaf surface topography in order to infect the host plant."

Magnetic measurements, in both the field and the laboratory, are particularly useful for reconnaissance work because of their speed and flexibility, Quantification as well as simple diagnosis of the transformation and movement of magnetic minerals within and between the atmosphere, lithosphere, and hydrosphere is practical. Techniques of investigating intrinsic and mineral magnetic properties, in addition to paleomagnetic remanence, are described in subjects as diverse as meteorology, hydrology, sedimentology, geophysics, and ecology."
https://openalex.org/W2086317328,"Lithographic techniques were used to expose edge surfaces in layered molybdenum disulfide single crystals. This microstructuring produced ideal samples for the study of the surface morphology and electronic structure of this catalytically important material. The optical absorption that was measured at mid-gap increased by two orders of magnitude after texturing. This increase resulted from reduced molybdenum at surface defects that are located on edge planes, as shown by photoemission spectroscopy. This information cannot easily be obtained on conventional crystals with predominantly basal plane surfaces."

Analytical data on lake water sampled before and during eruptions in 1982 showed that the concentrations of polythionates decreased and sulfate increased in response to the preeruption activities of the subaqueous fumaroles. These changes were observed 2 months before the first phreatic explosion on 26 October 1982. The monitoring of polythionates and sulfate in crater lake water is a promising means of anticipating potential volcanic eruption hazards."

These recently recognized oscillations (r-modes) increase the predictability of solar changes and may improve understanding of rotation and variability in other stars. Most of the 13 periodicities ranging from 13 to 85 days that are caused by r-modes can be detected in Nimbus 7 observations of solar irradiance during 3 years at solar maximum. These modes may also bear on the classical question of persistent longitudes of high solar activity."

https://openalex.org/W2067044523,"Building a strategic defense against nuclear ballistic missiles involves complex and uncertain functional, spatial, and temporal relations. Such a defensive system would evolve and grow over decades. It is too complex, dynamic, and interactive to be fully understood initially by design, analysis, and experiments. Uncertainties exist in the formulation of requirements and in the research and design of a defense architecture that can be implemented incrementally and be fully tested to operate reliably. The analysis and measurement of system survivability, performance, and cost-effectiveness are critical to this process. Similar complexities exist for an adversary's system that would suppress or use countermeasures against a missile defense. Problems and opportunities posed by these relations are described, with emphasis on the unique characteristics and vulnerabilities of space-based systems."
