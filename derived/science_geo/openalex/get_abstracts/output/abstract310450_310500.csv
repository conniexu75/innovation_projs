https://openalex.org/W2045666611,"The proposed role of the 30-kilodalton(kD) protein of tobacco mosaic virus is to facilitate cell-to-cell spread of the virus-during infection. To directly define the function of the protein, a chimeric gene containing a cloned complementary DNA of the 30-kD protein gene was introduced into tobacco cells via a Ti plasmid-mediated transformation system of Agrobacterium tumefaciens. Transgenic plants regenerated from transformed tobacco cells expressed the 30-kD protein messenger RNA and accumulated 30-kD protein. Seedlings expressing the 30-kD protein gene complemented the Lsl mutant of TMV, a mutant that is temperature-sensitive in cell-to-cell movement. In addition, enhanced movement of the Lsl virus at the permissive temperature was detected in seedlings that express the 30-kD protein gene. These results conclusively demonstrate that the 30-kD protein of tobacco mosaic virus potentiates the movement of the virus from cell to cell."
https://openalex.org/W1987733093,"A theoretical description of the shape of a random object is presented that is analytically simple in application but quantitatively accurate. The asymmetry of the object is characterized in terms of the invariants of a tensor, analogous to the moment-of-inertia tensor, whose eigenvalues are the squares of the principal radii of gyration. The complications accompanying ensemble averaging because of random processes are greatly reduced when the object is embedded in a space of high dimensionality, d. Exact analytical expressions are presented in the case of infinite spatial dimensions, and a procedure for developing an expansion in powers of l/d is discussed for linear chain and ring-type random walks. The first two terms in such an expansion lead to results for various shape parameters that agree remarkably well with those calculated by computer simulation. The method can be extended to yield an approximate, but extremely accurate, expression for the probability distribution function directly. The theoretical approach discussed here can, in principle, be used to describe the shape of other random fractal objects as well."

Of the plant introductions tested, one inhibited indicator plant growth by 87 percent and 25 inhibited growth by 50 percent or more. The toxicity of leachates from pots containing inhibitory cucumbers to indicator plants germinated in separate containers suggested allelopathy. Incorporation of an allelopathic character into a crop cultivar could provide the plant with a means of gaining a competitive advantage over certain weeds."
https://openalex.org/W2074862894,"Small-mammal bone found in Recent carnivore droppings (scat) is identical in appearance with that in many Mesozoic and Tertiary microvertebrate fossil collections. Such fossil specimens passed into or through the digestive tracts of carnivores before being left as scat that was later reworked into sedimentary rocks. The term ""coprocoenosis"" is proposed for such an assemblage. Caution is urged in drawing conclusions about the composition of paleocommunities because carnivores can catch prey representing several different communities and leave a mixed assemblage in a particular depositional environment."
https://openalex.org/W2015451551,"The enthalpy of transformation of a high-pressure form of titanium dioxide, which has the alpha lead dioxide structure, to the rutile modification was measured by the method of ""transposed temperature-drop calorimetry."" For the reaction, titanium dioxide (alpha lead dioxide form) transforming to rutile, the change in the heat content is -0.76 +/- 0.17 kilocalorie per mole. From this value and the volume change (+ 2.8 percent) associated with the transformation, we estimate the equilibrium pressure at 294 degrees K to be 60 +/- 20 kilobars."

https://openalex.org/W2018688898,Large talus blocks litter the flat floor of Oceanographer Canyon at a depth of 1460 meters; they indicate down-axis mass transport of floor sediment at an unknown time and rate. From 1460 to 1310 meters the sidewall is covered by unconsolidated sediment lying at 35° to 40° from the horizontal. An outcrop of Pleistocene or younger sediment at 1460 meters is probably a remnant of a former fill.
https://openalex.org/W2008735052,"Lunar rock 66095 contains a hydrated iron oxide and has an unusual amount of water for a lunar rock (140 to 750 parts per million), 90 percent of which is released below 690 degrees C. The deltaof water released at these low temperatures varies from -75 to -140 per mil relative to standard mean ocean water (SMOW). The small amount of water released between 690 degrees and 1300 degrees C has a delta of about -175 +/-25 per mil SMOW. These delta values are not unusual for terrestrial water. The delta(18)O of water extracted from 110 degrees to 400 degrees C has a value of +5+/- I per mil SMOW, similar to the value for lunar silicates from rock 66095 and different from the value of -4 to -22 per mil found for samples of terrestrial rust including samples of rusted meteoritic iron. The amount of carbon varies from 11 to 59 parts per million with a delta(13)C from -20 to -30 per mil relative to Pee Dee belemnite. Only very small amounts of reduced species (such as hydrogen, carbon monoxide, and methane) were found, in contrast to the analyses of other lunar rocks. Although it is possible that most of the water in the iron oxide (goethite) may be terrestrial in origin or may have exchanged with terrestrial water during sample return and handling, evidence presented herein suggests that this did not happen and that some lunar water may have a deltaD that is indistinguishable from that of terrestrial water."
https://openalex.org/W2054387910,It had been concluded by Lange and Larimer (1973) that the morphology and mineralogy of an unusual chondrule from the Ngawi meteorite are the results of a highly energetic impact within the solar nebula. The evidence for this conclusion is examined. It is found that the chondrule does not show evidence of high relative velocities in the solar nebula. It is pointed out that arguments against chondrule production by impact on planetary surfaces on the basis of ejection velocities are not supported by laboratory experiments.

Guenther, former assistant secretary of labor for occupational safety and health, as the ""former boss"" of Marcus M. Key, director of the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH). NIOSH in fact is part of the Department of Health, Education. and Welfare."

https://openalex.org/W2028257456,"Fossil-fueled power plants typically operate below their design capacities for a large fraction of their service life. In the United States, increased fuel and capital costs attributable to this off-design operation are considerable. This article describes the reasons for off-design operation and its importance in designing and selecting new power plants. Recent studies of coal gasification combined-cycle power plants show how computer simulations of off-design performance can aid in the design process, and they suggest that such simulations can be useful in reducing the cost of building and operating new power plants."

https://openalex.org/W2026267798,The promise of superconductivity making possible large magnets that dissipate no power is now being realized. Most of the early difficulties have been overcome; hence it is now a straight-forward engineering problem to design and build a large stable supermagnet. The application of such magnets to research in high-energy physics can be expected to grow rapidly in the next few years.
